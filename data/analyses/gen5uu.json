  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>Blastoise is famous for being the best user of Rapid Spin in BW UU. Its usable bulk and decent defensive typing give Blastoise many opportunities to enter battle and clear hazards from the field. Its access to Scald gives it a chance to burn Ghost-types that try and prevent the use of Rapid Spin and possibly ruin their longevity. It can even bypass their immunity to Rapid Spin entirely with Foresight. Scald's burn chance combined with Blastoise's access to phazing moves ensure that other Pokemon won't use Blastoise as setup bait. Unfortunately, though it is a good Rapid Spin user, it is a bad bulky Water-type. The other bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, Slowbro, Milotic, and Swampert, offer better bulk and various other advantages, such as recovery, better movepools, and useful secondary typings. These Pokemon often take up Blastoise's niche and make it hard to fit on teams. Even so, Blastoise continues to find space on teams as a great spinner.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rapid Spin is the main draw of Blastoise and as such it cannot do much else. It can try a RestTalk set to increase longevity; however, with the sleep counter resetting every switch it can become a liability very quickly. With a usable base 85 Special Attack and access to the powerful Water Spout, Blastoise can attempt an offensive Choice Specs or Scarf set, but this is better left to Empoleon or Swampert which have better offenses. Blastoise can utilize Aqua Jet to inflict a small amount of damage first, but this only helps against the rare Focus Sash Pokemon or Pokemon already at very low health.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While it may be difficult to block Blastoise's Rapid Spin, defeating it isn't very difficult. Blastoise cannot often switch in for free. Strong neutral attacks that it uses to enter battle, such as Heracross's Close Combat or Rhyperior's Earthquake, wear it down very quickly as Blastoise lacks recovery. Choice Band Heracross with Guts can check Blastoise and become a major threat to the opponent's team if burned. Electric- and Grass-types are able to do massive amounts of damage with their super effective STABs and can switch in for free on a predicted Rapid Spin. Roserade in particular can enter battle and immediately start putting Spikes back on the field while shrugging off a burn with Natural Cure. Shaymin can also easily enter battle, but instead of hazards it threatens the opponent's team with powerful Seed Flares. Zapdos and Raikou both put a large offensive strain on the opponent's team with their large Special Attack stats and great Electric-type STAB, and if they switch into Blastoise for free on Rapid Spin, they can start tearing the opponent's team apart. Choice Specs Kingdra resists Scald, doesn't fear burn, and can threaten physically bulky Blastoise with a 2HKO from Draco Meteor, but is unable to do so to a specially bulky Blastoise, and switching into Dragon Tail can be painful.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The purpose of this set is to support teams by clearing entry hazards from your side of the field. Scald's burn chance wears down Ghost-types that try to block Rapid Spin, as well as cripple Pokemon that may try to set up. The burn chance makes physical attackers afraid of Blastoise and allows it to check them while it has most of its HP. Roar weakens potential switch-ins that would threaten Blastoise, such as Roserade and Raikou, by forcing them to take repeated hazard damage. Roar also prevents Blastoise from being setup bait and allows it to check Substitute boosting sweepers, most notably Substitute + Dragon Dance Kingdra. Dragon Tail is an alternative to Roar that hits Wonder Skin Venomoth more accurately and does more damage to switch-ins. However, Dragon Tail can miss and it often cannot break the opponent's Substitutes. Foresight is very useful in allowing Blastoise to Rapid Spin immediately against bulky Ghost-types, such as Cofagrigus and Dusclops, which would take many turns to KO. Toxic may be used to cripple these bulky Ghost-types, as the badly poisoned status condition ruins Pokemon intended to stay in battle many turns.</p> <p>Physical defense is maximized because Water typing lends itself to checking physical attackers. A Relaxed nature should be used with Dragon Tail to ensure that it always breaks the Substitutes of Substitute + Dragon Dance Kingdra, but otherwise Bold is preferred. Blastoise can use a special EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm or Sassy nature to check certain special threats, most notably Rain Dance Kingdra. Ice Beam can be used over Roar or Foresight to hit common Grass-type switch-ins such as Roserade and Shaymin. However, it won't OHKO and Blastoise will still be forced out of battle. Both of Blastoise's abilities are very situational. With respect to Torrent, a low health Blastoise isn't much use and the power of a boosted Scald is minimal. Rain Dish Blastoise is good against the very situational Rain Dance team as well as Rain Dance Kingdra, but the ability is otherwise useless. Blastoise likes to be paired with Pokemon that can take Grass- and Electric-type attacks. Any Grass-type resists those two types, but Roserade in particular pairs with Blastoise very well. It provides special bulk that complements Blastoise's physical bulk and its ability to set entry hazards with Spikes complements Blastoise's ability to clear them from your side of the field. Although they cannot deal with powerful Electric-type attacks, Crobat and Zapdos can easily take Grass-type attacks and they help check Fighting-types that can break through Blastoise over time with high-powered STAB moves. Both Flying-types appreciate Blastoise's ability to remove Stealth Rock from the field. Darmanitan enjoys playing without Stealth Rock on the field as it is particularly prone to passive damage. Furthermore, Blastoise can check Rhyperior, a Darmanitan counter, while Darmanitan threatens Grass-types that come in easily on Blastoise. Snorlax can stomach almost any special attack that may be flung at Blastoise, and a lack of entry hazards makes it a much safer counter to powerful special attackers, such as Raikou and Zapdos, which could break through it eventually with the assistance of hazards.</p> "

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is generally regarded as a more defensively oriented Pokemon, and with the many new toys that it received this generation, it can perform that job better than ever. While overlooked during the times on DPP, Nidoqueen was blessed with the ability Sheer Force from the Dream World to power up many of its attacks to sky high levels, even without investment. The Queen also boasts a decent defensive typing with key resistances to Fighting-, Bug-, and Rock-type moves; furthermore, it has immunity to Electric-type attacks. In addition, Nidoqueen is not affected by Thunder Wave or Toxic, and it can absorb Toxic Spikes on its own. With a good movepool containing support, phazing, and offensive moves, Nidoqueen has quite a few options to choose from that can support your team's needs. Nidoqueen, through the transition to BW2, became one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters in UU because few Pokemon can use Rapid Spin against it safely. Blastoise is 2HKOed by Earth Power or Sludge Wave and fails to OHKO with Scald. Hitmontop is 2HKOed by both attacks as well. Xatu does not ever want to switch in because even defensive variants will not enjoy taking Ice Beam. Even Cryogonal is OHKOed by Fire Blast or Focus Blast and it cannot OHKO with Ice Beam, unless it's using an offensive EV spread.</p> <p>Sadly, Nidoqueen is not without its flaws. A Base 76 Speed is average at best and a weakness to Ground-types often can hold Nidoqueen back against faster threats. Not to mention, in the fully offensive role, Nidoqueen is always outclassed by its older brother, Nidoking, which also boasts Sheer Force but has higher offensive stats. To boot, Nidoqueen has no recovery outside of Rest, Black Sludge, or Leftovers. Despite these drawbacks, Nidoqueen is a threat that should not be overlooked, and if you are looking for a solid defensive Poison-type to set up Stealth Rock or wreak some havoc as a bulky attacker, why not give Nidoqueen a chance?</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoqueen does have a few other options available. Thunderbolt can deal with bulky Water-types better, but Nidoqueen generally hits them hard enough with Earth Power or Sludge Wave. Super Fang gets an interesting note on the defensive set, as it could become a wall that can break stall, but it also has a hard time finding a moveslot. Nidoqueen also has a great physical movepool, including the elemental punches from BW2, but generally Sheer Force-boosted special attacks are more powerful. Nidoqueen could also run an effective Toxic Spikes set with similar EVs to the defensive set, but the abundance of Poison-types makes this not as reliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In general, Nidoqueen has a difficult time with Pokemon with Earthquake, such as Rhyperior or Flygon, but such Pokemon must also watch out for Earth Power or Ice Beam, respectively. Bulky Water-types, such as Milotic, wall Nidoqueen and are able to strike with Scald or Hydro Pump. Suicune is similar to Milotic and can set up Calm Minds when Nidoqueen switches. Rotom-H can use Trick, Hidden Power Ice, or Overheat to take out or disable Nidoqueen accordingly, and can take Earth Power, Ice Beam, and Fire Blast with impunity. Weavile is able to hit Nidoqueen with a STAB Ice Punch, but it must watch out for Fire Blast. Snorlax also counters Nidoqueen fairly well and can Curse or hit back with Earthquake. Even Porygon2 tanks Nidoqueen's special attacks, including Focus Blast, and can Trace Sheer Force; this will provide Porygon2 an OHKO with Ice Beam. It can also use Recover and hit other things hard with Sheer Force. Finally, other hard hitting special attackers will generally bring Nidoqueen into at least yellow health with a neutral hit.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With this set, Nidoqueen becomes an offensive force to be reckoned with while still having enough bulk to be a good check to Fighting- and Bug-type Pokemon in the tier. Thanks to Sheer Force, Life Orb recoil is canceled, effectively giving Nidoqueen a 1.7x boost to its attacks with no secondary effects. Earth Power is usually Nidoqueen's most reliable STAB, as it can OHKO Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Victini, Rhyperior, and Cobalion. Fire Blast is necessary to get past the likes of Bronzong who would otherwise wall this set. Next, Ice Beam catches Pokemon such as Flygon, Zapdos, Gligar, and Claydol off guard, but Focus Blast also can hit some other targets hard, namely Umbreon, Snorlax, and Clefable. However, be mindful of Focus Blast's low accuracy. Sludge Wave also can hit a lot for neutral damage with its STAB despite the poor coverage. Lastly, Nidoqueen can set up Stealth Rock; however, if your team already has a Stealth Rock user, Focus Blast should be put there.</p> <p>The EVs on this set allow Nidoqueen to reach 227 Speed, outrunning Xatu, Roserade, most Togekiss, and defensive Arcanine. From there, Nidoqueen can easily KO these Pokemon with a super effective move. Life Orb is the only item to be used on this set because it provides great offensive power at no cost to Nidoqueen. Modest nature is always best for this set; if you even considered running Timid nature, use Nidoking instead.</p> <p>Bronzong is a great partner for Nidoqueen because they both have good synergy with each other. Thanks to Bronzong's Levitate and good defenses, Bronzong can take on Krookodile's Earthquakes or Crunches, Flygon Choice-locked into Earthquake or Outrage (watch out for Fire Punch!), and Weavile. Like Bronzong, Pokemon such as Umbreon and Calm defensive Porygon2 are great partners because they can switch out on a Fighting-type and Nidoqueen can switch in. Snorlax is also great for team support as it can take hits from special attackers, such as Zapdos and Rotom-H, while maintaining offensive pressure and it has the ability to set up multiple Curses. Wish support is always welcome for Nidoqueen as it does not have reliable recovery, especially without Black Sludge; Togekiss and Umbreon are decent Wish users in the tier. If you aren't running Stealth Rock, Nidoqueen appreciates entry hazards, so any other support from Pokemon such as Bronzong and Roserade is welcomed.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With this set, Nidoqueen serves as one of the best counters to Fighting- and Bug-type Pokemon in the tier. Stealth Rock is the main move on the set and as a defensive Pokemon, it sets them up well. Even without investment, Earth Power is usually Nidoqueen's most reliable STAB, as it can hit other Pokemon pretty hard thanks to Sheer Force. Fire Blast is necessary to put a dent into Bronzing, who would otherwise wall this set. As another option, Ice Beam catches Flying- and Ground-types such as Flygon, Zapdos, Gligar, and Claydol off guard. The choice depends on your team's needs and what Pokemon your team struggles with more. In the last slot, Dragon Tail is usually better for Nidoqueen, as it can do some decent damage to Flygon who think that they can get a free switch. If you are really afraid of Substitute users such as Mismagius, go for Roar.</p> <p>The EVs on this set make Nidoqueen defensively oriented but also give it a little bit of Speed; these Speed EVs allow Nidoqueen to outspeed defensive Blastoise. Furthermore, don't ever consider running a Relaxed nature in conjunction with Dragon Tail, as the power drop is not worth being slower than Blastoise. A Bold nature increases your Defense without dropping Speed, so that is always the best choice. Black Sludge is the best choice for an item most of the time, but if you are really afraid of Trick, you can use Leftovers.</p> <p>Bronzong is a great partner, using Levitate and solid defenses to take on Krookodile and Flygon. Specially bulky walls, such as Umbreon, Porygon2, and Snorlax, can take attacks from Zapdos, Rotom-H, and Victini with ease, and can lure in Fighting-type attacks for Nidoqueen. As Nidoqueen has no reliable recovery, Wish support extends its lifespan considerably; Togekiss and Umbreon have good type synergy with Nidoqueen and can reliably pass Wish.</p> "

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking is one of the most feared attackers in the UU tier due to its vast movepool and good attacking stats, further increased by Sheer Force. Nidoking is also an easy Pokemon to switch in with its resistance to Stealth Rock, immunities to Thunder Wave and Toxic, and a key immunity and resistance, respectively, to Electric- and Fighting-type moves. However, Nidoking isn't without flaws, as its mediocre Speed and defensive stats often let it down against more offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Nidoking has an impressive physical movepool, which includes Earthquake, Poison Jab, and the elemental punches, but Nidoking is generally better off using special attacks. Nidoking has access to Superpower, which can be used to get past Snorlax if Focus Blast's accuracy is a concern. Finally, Nidoking can use a mixed set with Hone Claws, as it boosts Nidoking's Attack while making low accuracy attacks such as Blizzard or Thunder viable; however, it is not effective enough to be a standard option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Specially defensive behemoths such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2 are the best options to stop Nidoking, as they can switch in on most of Nidoking's attacks and retaliate back. However, one must keep in mind that Nidoking can beat them if it's carrying Focus Blast. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Suicune, and Slowking can also check Nidoking thanks to their great defenses, but they don't enjoy taking repeated hits.</p> <p>Another way of dealing with Nidoking is preying on its mediocre Speed. Its base 85 Speed is by no means great in UU, as it leaves Nidoking outsped by most offensive Pokemon in the tier such as Shaymin, Darmanitan, Flygon, and Azelf, which can force Nidoking out or simply OHKO it with their powerful attacks. Rotom-H is another annoying Pokemon for Nidoking to face, as it resists all its moves except Focus Blast and Sludge Wave while being able to outspeed and OHKO Nidoking with Overheat.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is Nidoking's flagship set, and for good reason. Between its peerless coverage, and the power that Life Orb and Sheer Force provide, Nidoking can at least 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier barring particular dedicated special walls. Earth Power is Nidoking's main attacking move, receiving STAB and destroying the plethora of Steel-, Rock-, and Fire-type Pokemon in the tier, such as Empoleon, Registeel, Rhyperior, and Arcanine. Fire Blast gives coverage on Grass-type Pokemon such as Shaymin, while also hitting Bronzong and Heracross for super effective damage, netting a 2HKO on the former while OHKOing the latter. Ice Beam is generally the best option for the third slot, hitting Flygon and Flying-type Pokemon super effectively. However, Focus Blast allows Nidoking to get past Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2, which would wall Nidoking otherwise. The final slot depends on the needs of the team; Nidoking can set up Stealth Rock if you can't afford running it on any of his teammates, but Substitute is generally the superior option, as it takes advantage of the switches forced by Nidoking and eases predictions.</p> <p>A Timid nature is recommended as it allows Nidoking to outrun Togekiss and Kingdra, as well as at least ensuring the Speed tie with non-Choice Scarf Heracross; however, a Modest nature can be used if more power is needed. Nidoking has other attacking options such as Thunderbolt and Sludge Wave. The former hits Water-types such as Milotic and Slowking, and the latter is a good secondary STAB move.</p> <p>Nidoking has trouble with faster offensive Pokemon and priority users, such as Flygon, Weavile, and Azumarill. For this reason, bulky Pokemon such as Shaymin and Calm Mind Suicune are great partners, as they are able to check those Pokemon while benefitting from Nidoking's ability to defeat special walls for them. Another good partner is Snorlax, which can take hits from special attackers such as Zapdos, Rotom-H, and Victini while maintaining offensive pressure. Although Nidoking doesn't need much support because it hits like a truck, entry hazards are always helpful due to the amount of switches Nidoking forces, which, together with its access to Stealth Rock, make Nidoking a very good Pokemon on Spikes-stacking teams.</p> "

Choice Scarf helps Nidoking overcome its biggest flaw, its lackluster Speed, as with a Choice Scarf attached, it can outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in UU, including common Nidoking checks such as Shaymin and Zapdos. Earth Power is Nidoking's primary STAB move; it lets it KO Pokemon such as Raikou and Cobalion, while Ice Beam gives Nidoking a move to hit Pokemon immune to Earth Power, such as Togekiss, Zapdos, and Flygon.</p> <p>Sludge Wave is Nidoking's secondary STAB move, and it has good neutral coverage with Earth Power. Sludge Wave allows Nidoking to revenge kill Azelf as well as Grass-type Pokemon such as Shaymin, while also being Nidoking's best option against Rotom-H. For the last moveslot, Fire Blast is preferred, as it allows Nidoking to OHKO Heracross while being able to hit Bronzong, which would wall Nidoking otherwise. However, Thunderbolt can also be used to hit most Water-types super effectively.</p> <p>Modest is the preferred nature on this set, as Nidoking still retains the necessary speed to outpace every Pokemon in the tier while gaining as much power as possible to take down bulkier foes such as Zapdos or Kingdra. Timid is an option if you are really worried about Choice Scarf Heracross, but take into account that even with a Timid nature, Nidoking can only Speed tie with Jolly Heracross.</p> <p>Without the power provided by Life Orb, Nidoking finds itself unable to take down special walls such as Porygon2 and Umbreon, and bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic are now better able to check Nidoking too. For this reason, teammates that are able to take down special walls and defensive cores in general such as Mienshao, Honchkrow, and Sleep Powder Roserade are recommended. Swords Dance Heracross is an extremely good partner for Nidoking, as it can take advantage of a Scald burn to activate Guts.</p> <p>This Nidoking set needs more support, as it will be switching more often; due to its reduced damage output, entry hazard support is highly recommended. Pokemon such as Qwilfish, Rhyperior, Bronzong, and Blastoise are good partners, as they can not only support Nidoking by setting up hazards or using Rapid Spin, but can also check faster Choice Scarf users that outrun Nidoking, such as Flygon, Darmanitan, and Krookodile.</p> "

Magic Coat can bounce back nasty things such as status, entry hazards, and Taunt. Sing can put opponents to sleep, but its very shaky accuracy makes it hardly worth using. Clefable can set up Gravity or Stealth Rock, but the former is gimmicky and the latter is best left to sturdier Pokemon.

Belly Drum does become more effective when used with Swift Swim, but priority users and fast Choice Scarf users can still outspeed Poliwrath. Unfortunately, there is no automatic Rain in UU, so manual rain support will have to be provided should you choose to go the Swift Swim/Belly Drum route. Also, even a Belly Drum set will not allow Poliwrath to get past Slowbro. Hypnosis is another option that can be run to incapacitate potential counters, but it has unreliable accuracy.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Slowbro is by far the best counter to Poliwrath, resisting everything Poliwrath can possibly throw at it and KOing Poliwrath with Psychic or Psyshock. Roserade also resists both of Poliwrath's STABs and can just set up hazards or KO Poliwrath with a Grass-type move. In addition, Roserade is immune to Poliwrath's Toxic and can simply switch out and cure its status should Poliwrath land a Hypnosis on it. Intimidate Qwilfish presents similar problems, and can easily set up Spikes against Poliwrath while using Haze to get rid of any Bulk Up boosts. Ghosts such as Dusclops and Spiritomb, as well as other walls like Weezing, can wall Poliwrath and burn it should it not have a Substitute up. Keep in mind that generally speaking, status is ineffectual against Poliwrath because of RestTalk and Substitute. In general, any Grass- or Electric-type can easily dispatch Poliwrath, especially if said Grass- or Electric-type Pokemon is faster.</p> ",

Poliwrath's defenses and typing make it effective at switching in repeatedly to phaze the opponent, Resting when it is low on health to continue shuffling. In the fourth slot, Waterfall allows Poliwrath to counter physical threats weak to Water, such as Arcanine and Rhyperior. Toxic, on the other hand, assists Poliwrath in crippling bulky threats like Slowbro and Milotic that would otherwise wall Poliwrath. It can also be used to cripple Ghost-type foes such as Dusclops and Mismagius.</p> <p>While this Poliwrath is physically bulky thanks to the EVs, it won't take many strong neutral or super effective special attacks. Therefore, Poliwrath appreciates teammates that can take Grass-, Electric-, and Psychic-typed special attacks, such as and Rotom-H. Since this Poliwrath is excellent at phazing opponents with Circle Throw, it is most effective on a team that lays hazards to fully take advantage of the forced switches. Bulk Up can also be run over Circle Throw or Waterfall to make a set similar to Suicune's Crocune set. When using Bulk Up, an alternate EV spread should be run, utilizing 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD with a Careful nature in order to maximize Poliwrath's defenses with Bulk Up. However, without Toxic, Poliwrath will not be able to defeat Slowbro or Milotic. Additionally, Ghost-types are immune to Circle Throw, so any Poliwrath running a Bulk Up RestTalk set will need to have those threats removed before it starts its boosting run.</p> "

With this set, Poliwrath can easily come in on a Water-type attack, Encore it, and then set up a Substitute while its enemy switches out. By doing so, Poliwrath can turn a Pokemon that normally walls it into setup fodder. The EVs for the set allow it to outrun 0 Speed Suicune, and hence pretty much any bulky Water-type in UU, and lock it into Scald.</p> <p>While Encore is often the preferred option to ensure Poliwrath can get up a Substitute, Bulk Up may be used to increase Poliwrath's Defense while also increasing its Attack. Toxic can also be used over Encore to help deal with Pokemon that wall Poliwrath, such as Slowbro and Spiritomb.</p> <p>While Poliwrath hits harder using its STAB moves, Rock Slide can be run over Waterfall to provide superior coverage with Focus Punch. The same can be said of Ice Punch; however, both moves are extremely lacking in power; Poliwrath cannot even 2HKO 0 / 0 Celebi with Ice Punch. Roserade is an excellent teammate, able to absorb Electric- and Grass-type attacks, crush bulky Water-type foes with its powerful STAB Grass-type attacks, and soften enemies resistant to Focus Punch with its Toxic Spikes. Any hazards, in fact, work well with Poliwrath's ability to force switches using Encore. Rotom-H is also an excellent partner for Poliwrath, resisting all of its weaknesses except Psychic and having very good synergy with it in general.</p> "

  "Victreebel": {
    "overview": "<p>Victreebel is, and always has been, one of the most powerful sun sweepers in the game. It has probably the best mixed offensive spread of any Chlorophyll user, setting it apart from the likes of Sawsbuck, Shiftry, and Tangrowth. With access to the newly buffed Growth, excellent moves such as Power Whip and Weather Ball, and with the latest, most powerful Chlorophyll user, Venusaur, now in OU, Victreebel has become an even better choice for your UU sun team. However, as always, Victreebel is held back by its frailty, as well as by the fact that the aforementioned excellent moves are illegal together. On top of this, sun teams themselves are hardly reliable. However, don't let this make you think that Victreebel is not a threat--take Victreebel lightly and you could quickly find your team in tatters.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Victreebel is quite capable of running a pure physical or special set, utilizing Swords Dance or Growth, without the need to split EVs. However, even with the splitting of EVs Victreebel rarely falls short of a KO that it might otherwise achieve. The only advantage really is that Victreebel may invest somewhat in bulk, without a defense-lowering nature, to aid in setting up. As far as other move options go, there are a few; notably, there are several special Grass-type moves. Solar Beam is probably the best, offering excellent power--with Team Preview the rare Hippopotas switch-ins can be predicted and dealt with. Energy Ball and Grass Knot will work out much weaker on average. On the physical side, Return and Sucker Punch provide the only notable coverage moves, Sucker Punch being somewhat effective but inconveniently illegal with Power Whip and Weather Ball. Victreebel also has a considerable support movepool that it cannot make use of due to its frailty, including Teeter Dance, Stun Spore, Knock Off, and Synthesis. Similarly, it could act as something of a sun supporter with Sunny Day and a Heat Rock, but altogether this is best left to bulkier Chlorophyll Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Exeggutor.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Countering Victreebel, though extremely difficult, is something you should rarely have to do. Victreebel relies on two things; the ability to use Growth once, and the weather being sunny. The latter can be circumvented with your own weather changer. If it does manage to use Growth, your options are few: Fire-types resist Victreebel's staple moves, but most of them will fall to Sludge Bomb or Hidden Power Rock after a Growth. Otherwise, you should either be looking towards extremely bulky Pokemon or revenge killing. Pokemon such as Dusclops and Cresselia can all take a +2 hit, though most of them will do little back besides perhaps stalling out sun or paralyzing Victreebel. Snorlax deserves mention in that it can take any move besides +2 Power Whip; however, it also fails to KO Victreebel in return. With regard to revenge killing, priority moves are a decent option; Ice Shard users such as Weavile destroy Victreebel, and Extreme Speed users such as Arcanine can dent Victreebel considerably. Fast Choice Scarf users--positive base 90s and up--can revenge kill Victreebel, though many, including Flygon and Zapdos, will need a Fire-type move to OHKO outright.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>After a Growth in the sun, Victreebel is almost unstoppable, hitting 578 Attack, 596 Special Attack, and 450 Speed. At this point, Victreebel will come out on top against virtually every Pokemon in UU. However, getting to this position is hardly easy--Victreebel is terribly frail, making it hard to set up a Growth, and 8 turns of sun can vanish surprisingly fast. Nonetheless, Victreebel has excellent coverage, better than that of almost any Chlorophyll Pokemon. Though Leaf Blade is the main STAB move, Weather Ball, which works out to be more powerful in the sun, is what really sets this apart, OHKOing common Pokemon such as 252/0 Hitmontop and Zapdos after a Growth. Sludge Bomb provides neutral coverage against Fire- and Flying-type opponents, including Arcanine and Victini; boosted by STAB, this also gives you a great special option outside of the sun. As for other options, you may run Power Whip over Leaf Blade; the increase in power is significant, but legality issues then plague Victreebel. Weather Ball, normally Victreebel's most powerful move, is illegal alongside Power Whip, forcing you to run Hidden Power Fire. However, you do gain advantage against some of Victreebel's checks; for example, with max Attack Victreebel can OHKO Jolly Scarf Flygon on the switch. In the fourth slot, Sleep Powder provides an excellent alternative if you are not already using sleep moves elsewhere on your team. It can potentially cripple a counter to Victreebel, while allowing it to set up a Growth uninhibited. It is worth remembering, however, that Tangrowth, though a lot slower, can probably use Power Whip / Hidden Power Fire / Sleep Powder to greater effect.</p> <p>The spread on this set is fairly flexible; the Speed EVs let Victreebel outrun neutral +1 base 100 Speed Pokemon, as well as max Speed Choice Scarf Rotom-A, in the sun. The Attack and Special Attack EVs give a fairly even split between Victreebel's offensive stats. If you choose to use Power Whip, you probably want to capitalize more on Attack; for instance, if you maximize Victreebel's Attack, it can OHKO Flygon on the switch. If you want superior overall power though, stick with Leaf Blade and Weather Ball. The nature can also be changed; currently the nature lowers Special Defense largely because most priority moves are physical, but Victreebel can set up on Special Attacks better with a Mild nature if you prefer. You can also use a Naive or Hasty nature, allowing Victreebel to outrun +1 positive-natured base 100s, but the power drop is very noticeable. As far as alternative moves go, you might consider Hidden Power in the fourth slot; Hidden Power Rock hits Fire- and Flying-types super effectively, while Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types. However, these moves are weaker when super effective than a neutral Weather Ball, and only slightly more powerful than a neutral Sludge Bomb. Sunny Day is not recommended, as Victreebel is too frail to set it up.</p> <p>When looking for teammates, sun support should be considered over everything else. Generally, bulky Pokemon carrying Heat Rock should be used; ideally they should also benefit somehow from the sun. Fire-types and other Chlorophyll Pokemon are obvious examples. Additionally, you should also be looking to aid Victreebel in setting up. Uxie, for example, can set up sun and then offer a free switch-in and setup with Memento. Otherwise, Stealth Rock is important to Victreebel too, as it does have some issues with Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon. Uxie is an excellent user here too.</p> "

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos is one of the strongest special attackers in the UU tier, and one glance at its stats should tell you why. An enormous base 125 Special Attack makes Zapdos hit like a truck, and base 100 Speed allows it to outspeed many of the common attackers in the UU tier such as Darmanitan, Heracross, and Nidoking. Furthermore, Zapdos has outstanding versatility, being able to run solid offensive, defensive, and Choice sets. Very few Pokemon are safe from Zapdos's wrath since the electric fury can attack with nearly perfect coverage in just Thunderbolt, Heat Wave, and a Hidden Power of choice.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Zapdos has its limitations. For starters, the dedicated special walls of UU, such as Umbreon and Snorlax, have no problem shrugging off even Zapdos's most powerful attacks and recovering away the damage. Also, even with Hidden Power, Zapdos will still be walled by certain Ground-type Pokemon. UU's other Electric-type powerhouse, Raikou, defeats Zapdos one-on-one and often uses Zapdos as a set-up opportunity. Finally, Zapdos loses 25% of its health just by switching into Stealth Rock, but at least has the benefit of being immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Despite its shortcomings, Zapdos is a very powerful special attacker in the UU tier and a threat that every team needs to prepare for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zapdos has very few viable options that are not listed in the above sets. Zapdos's above average (by special sweeper standards) base 90 Attack may look appealing, but in reality any attempt at a mixed attacking set leaves Zapdos too weak to break any walls that the special sweeper set can't break. The only way Zapdos can boost its Special Attack is through the move Charge Beam, which is technically viable. However, Raikou is a better boosting sweeper and Charge Beam consumes a moveslot that can be used on a coverage move or Roost. Choice Scarf with Thunderbolt, Heat Wave, a Hidden Power of your choosing, and Volt Switch can be used, but that really stretches the limits of viability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Zapdos has many checks but few counters, as with Zapdos's power and versatility (not to mention its durability!), the electric bird can be tough to take down. Swampert and Rhyperior defeat any set that doesn't include Hidden Power Grass, and Gligar and Flygon beat any Zapdos without Hidden Power Ice. Zapdos's partner in crime, Raikou, can switch in on just about any attack and begin setting up Calm Mind, but a weakened Raikou will not enjoy Heat Wave or Hidden Power. The three special walls of UU, Snorlax, Umbreon, and Porygon2, all take on standard Zapdos very well but have trouble with Choice Specs-boosted Thunderbolts. Stealth Rock and status conditions make Zapdos sad as it wants to preserve its health in order to stave off Life Orb recoil and any status problem severely hinders its effectiveness. Rotom-H resists Thunderbolt, Heat Wave, and any Hidden Power Zapdos uses, but it's weak to Stealth Rock and has questionable bulk. Nidoqueen and Nidoking don't take any damage from Thunderbolt and can shoot Zapdos out of the sky with a Sheer Force-boosted Ice Beam. Zapdos, since it's not blindingly fast and doesn't commonly boost its Speed, can be revenge killed rather easily by Choice Scarf users, such as Heracross and Darmanitan, as well.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<p>Offensive Zapdos is a textbook Life Orb attacker. The purpose of this set is to use powerful STAB, decent coverage moves, and the power boost granted by Life Orb to cause as much damage to the opponent as possible. Thunderbolt is Zapdos's most reliable Electric attack and hits hard off of Zapdos's great Special Attack. Heat Wave is a great complement to Thunderbolt since it destroys the Grass-types that would normally want to switch into Thunderbolt. Heat Wave also gives Zapdos an extra punch against Steel-type Pokemon, such as Bronzong and Registeel, and also gets an unconditional OHKO against Weavile. Hidden Power rounds out the set, and the type you choose determines which Pokemon Zapdos beats and which ones it falls short against. If Hidden Power Ice is used, then Zapdos can fell Flygon and Gligar in a single hit. However, beware that Hidden Power Ice fails to OHKO Rhyperior and leaves you helpless against Swampert. On the flip side, Hidden Power Grass defeats all but the most specially defensive Rhyperior and Swampert in a single blow but leaves Zapdos walled by Gligar and requires three hits to defeat Flygon. Roost is what separates Zapdos from other Life Orb attackers by giving Zapdos a way to recover damage from attacks and Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>This set's EVs are nothing out of the ordinary: 252 Special Attack to maximize power, 252 Speed to outpace anything slower than base 100 and to tie with Victini, Flygon, and Shaymin. Timid is the preferred nature to maximize Speed and reach the absolutely critical base 100 Speed tier, though Modest is an acceptable nature. With a Modest nature, Zapdos outspeeds everything up to and including Rotom-A and cranks its Special Attack up to a whopping 383. As far as other moves go, Volt Switch is a great momentum-grabber for Zapdos's team, but Volt Switch works better on Choice sets because they appreciate the hit-and-run nature of Volt Switch. Volt Switch is perfectly acceptable in a VoltTurn core, especially if that core contains Xatu, whose Magic Bounce ability keeps Stealth Rock off of Zapdos's side of the field. Toxic seems like a good way to get past Umbreon and Snorlax, two of Zapdos's main counters, but in practice this rarely works. Umbreon often carries Heal Bell and always carries Synchronize, so Zapdos will end up poisoned more than Umbreon will! Snorlax, even though it rarely carries Immunity, almost always carries Rest to remove damaging status such as Toxic. Hidden Power Flying seems like it has the \"best of both worlds\" as far as Hidden Powers go, but without Choice Specs boosting Zapdos's Special Attack the move still doesn't hit Gligar and Swampert hard enough to deter them and still leaves Zapdos useless against Rhyperior. Hidden Power Flying does hit Fighting-type Pokemon hard, but Thunderbolt usually is enough to get the job done and Zapdos appreciates Ice or Grass coverage. In the same vein, Substitute eases prediction, but Zapdos already doesn't rely on prediction and needs the extra coverage and Roost to maximize its worth.</p> <p>As far as teammates go, any team that wants to use Zapdos to the fullest needs a way to deal with Stealth Rock. That can be accomplished in two ways: Magic Bounce support or Rapid Spin support. Magic Bounce prevents entry hazards from going up in the first place, but the only Pokemon with access to the ability in UU is Xatu, who shares both of Zapdos's weaknesses while providing few additional resistances. Xatu is a good choice only for teams that have enough Rock and Ice resistances to justify using both Pokemon. Furthermore, Xatu doesn't destroy any of Zapdos's counters, such as Umbreon and Snorlax, meaning that you need to dedicate yet another Pokemon to defeating Zapdos's counters. Rapid Spin support commonly comes from one of three Pokemon: Blastoise, Hitmontop, and Claydol. Blastoise has decent synergy (an Ice resistance) with Zapdos, but doesn't target the bird's counters very well. Hitmontop, however, can defeat both Umbreon and Snorlax with Close Combat and resists Rock-type attacks that plague Zapdos. Claydol, though it can spin, has trouble getting past the Ghost-types that block Rapid Spin and shares and Ice weakness with Zapdos. Another great partner for Zapdos is Roserade, who gives Zapdos Spikes support which it can use to eventually break down its nemeses Umbreon and Snorlax. Fighting-types, such as Mienshao, who both maintains momentum with U-turn and bashes down Umbreon (watch out for Protect when using High Jump Kick) and Snorlax, make great partners as well.</p> "

        "name": "SubRoost",
        "description": "<p>With this set, Zapdos can both take a lot of hits and immediately pressure your opponent offensively. It can avoid a 2HKO from a majority of attackers and threaten them with high-powered attacks, forcing many switches, and leaving you opportunities to get free Substitutes, which are great for easing prediction and facilitating Pressure stalls. These things in conjunction with Roost make Zapdos an absolute terror to remove the game once it has hit the battlefield. The most common answers to Zapdos are Ice- and Rock-type attacks, however but with Pressure and its good bulk, Zapdos can easily outlast the PP of common moves like Ice Beam and Stone Edge, leaving your opponent few options to break it. Substitute also provides a dual purpose in that it staves off the one thing this Zapdos hates more than anything: status. Because of these attributes, SubRoost Zapdos makes a great candidate for use on balanced and stall teams as a defensive pivot.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is a staple on any Zapdos set, hitting everything but Ground-types for respectable damage, even without any Special Attack investment. Hidden Power Ice is an excellent coverage move alongside Thunderbolt, nailing many common Ground-type switch-ins, like such as Flygon and Nidoqueen, for super effective damage. On the other hand, Hidden Power Flying allows Zapdos to easily dispatch Swords Dance Heracross and 2HKO offensive Shaymin and Roserade, both things that Hidden Power Ice fails to do (though you'll need 252 SpA EVs in order to 2HKO specially defensive Roserade with Hidden Power Flying with Stealth Rock). Additionally, it hits all Ground-type Pokemon (outside of Rhyperior) in the UU tier for neutral damage and is only marginally weaker than a super effective Hidden Power Ice. Lastly, if Swampert or Rhyperior are exceptionally large threats to your team, Hidden Power Grass can be used to good effect. However, Electric and Grass do not have great type synergy, so this is an extremely niche option.</p> <p>The EVs listed allow Zapdos to outrun all non-Choice Scarf base 90 Pokemon with a positive nature. If you'd like to invest more, maximum Speed is recommended in order to tie with the base 100 squad of Pokemon. The rest of the EVs are invested into defenses in order to optimize Zapdos' bulk, maximizing HP while putting the rest into either Defense or Special Defense depending on your team's particular needs. A more offensive version of this set is viable and should run an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Modest nature. Leftovers should be replaced with a Life Orb. These changes leave Zapdos far less bulky but let it put even more offensive pressure on an opposing team, as common special walls such as Mew are now 2HKOed with Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes in play. Do note, however that your Zapdos' Speed will drop as a result of this change, so additional coverage against Pokemon sitting in the base 90 range, like Roserade, will need to be added to your team.</p> <p>Toxic can be used in place of Hidden Power to more effectively stall out foes with reliable recovery, but this renders Zapdos completely useless against common Poison-type Pokemon, such as Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking. Thus, it may be a good idea to pair Zapdos with a teammate that carries Toxic Spikes. A defensive Qwilfish is the best candidate for this job, as it resists Ice-type moves aimed at Zapdos and has Intimidate to soften the blow of physical Rock-type moves that might come Zapdos' way. Nidoqueen is another option, mainly because it routinely counters Raikou, which can come in on this Zapdos easily with impunity, especially if it lacks Toxic. Nidoqueen also hits all Poison-types in the tier for super effective damage with its Sheer Force-boosted STAB Earth Power and Ice Beam should they attempt to absorb your Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Specially defensive Rhyperior is one of the best Zapdos counters in general, but it is particularly effective against this set because it can utilize Rock Blast to damage Zapdos even if it has a Substitute up, while taking minuscule damage from Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Flying. Raikou also makes an excellent counter to this set, especially if this Zapdos lacks Toxic, as it can come in freely against Thunderbolt or Hidden Power, set up a Substitute, and facilitate a Calm Mind sweep. Lastly, unless you've opted to use the more offensive variant, Mew, Umbreon, and Snorlax are all hard counters to this set. Mew can shrug off Thunderbolts with Soft-Boiled, Taunt Zapdos so it you cannot use Roost or Substitute, and then begin to chip away at Zapdos' health bar with a combination of Will-O-Wisp and Psyshock. Umbreon can stall Zapdos out of all of its Thunderbolt PP with a combination of Wish and Protect, and if Zapdos paralyzes with Thunderbolt or uses Toxic, your precious Zapdos will get statused itself, all completely for naught as Umbreon will just use Heal Bell in the coming turn. Snorlax can avoid getting 3HKOed by Thunderbolt from the pivot spread and spam Body Slams to fish for a paralysis, setting up a 3HKO should Zapdos ever be fully paralyzed and miss an opportunity to Roost.</p> "

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<p>A cursory glance at Zapdos's stats wouldn't suggest \"physical wall\" at all, but one glance at Zapdos's great defensive typing and ability shows why this set works. Zapdos possesses just two weaknesses, only one of which (Rock) is a common physical type in UU. However, Rock-type attacks (read: Stone Edge) do not give Zapdos much trouble because of a great ability in Pressure. Pressure doubles the opponent's PP usage, giving Stone Edge a pitiful four uses against Zapdos. Furthermore, using Roost on an anticipated Stone Edge reduces the attack from super effective to merely neutral. However, be warned that Roost removes Zapdos's Ground immunity and replaces it with a weakness, so a savvy opponent using both Stone Edge and Earthquake will more often than not beat this set. Regardless, Zapdos can still utilize its decent physical bulk, wonderful Special Attack, and Fighting-type resistance to wall many of UU's physical attackers.</p> <p>Discharge and Thunderbolt are both great moves, and the choice between the two comes down to whether or not Discharge's 30% paralysis rate benefits your team more than Thunderbolt's added power does. If Zapdos is on a team that uses burn- and poison-inducing moves such as Toxic, Toxic Spikes, Will-O-Wisp, and Scald, then Thunderbolt is the better choice. Otherwise, Discharge is normally preferable. Roost is a very obvious choice since it nullifies Zapdos's weakness to Stone Edge and provides instant recovery in conjunction with Leftovers. The Hidden Power choice comes down to Grass vs Flying. Ice isn't a recommended option since Zapdos walls Flygon anyway, but it deserves a mention because Gligar's Immunity prevents Zapdos from wearing it down with Toxic. Grass shreds Swampert and Rhyperior, while Flying defeats Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Scrafty, and Machamp. The final slot comes down to Heat Wave versus Toxic. Heat Wave is preferable for its ability to hit Bronzong and Registeel harder, but Toxic is great for bulky Pokemon that can't be defeated with Hidden Power. If Zapdos is using Hidden Power Flying, then Toxic is your best bet for Swampert and Rhyperior.</p> <p>The EVs are straightforward. 24 Speed EVs are there to outpace Adamant Bisharp, while the rest of the EVs are used to pump up Zapdos's HP and Defense. Don't deviate from this spread much unless you really need to speed creep something, or else you sacrifice Zapdos's merely adequate bulk. In terms of team support, Rapid Spin is always useful, and the three candidates for that job are Blastoise, Hitmontop, and Claydol. Blastoise has the most overall bulk and resists Ice, Hitmontop has Intimidate, and Claydol resists Rock and is immune to Spikes, which can wear the other two down. Status problems are disastrous for Zapdos as well since it has no way of avoiding status problems and any status problem greatly cripples it. Togekiss makes a good partner here, as does Umbreon and even Roserade if you're willing to use Aromatherapy. Entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field are greatly recommended since Zapdos's ability to stop many physical attackers--especially the Fighting-types--forces many switches. Other viable moves include Roar, which forces out set-up sweepers, such as Suicune and Cofagrigus, and Hidden Power Ice which gives Zapdos a way to reliably defeat Gligar and Flygon. Substitute is nice on Zapdos, and is more viable with Hidden Power Ice. SubRoost Zapdos is a mean physical wall, but remember that Zapdos has significant Speed issues that impede its ability to really make use of Substitute.</p> "

        "description": "<p>So, Zapdos isn't hitting hard enough for you? Well, this set is the answer. Choice Specs Zapdos hits harder than the Life Orb set and maintains the same Speed that makes Zapdos great. Thunderbolt is for obvious reasons; it's Zapdos's strongest reliable attack. However, the real focal point of this set is Hidden Power Flying which, thanks to Choice Specs, finally has the power to 2HKO almost every Ground-type, making Ice and Grass obsolete. After Ground-types are eliminated, Zapdos is free to fire off Thunderbolts without much fear of being walled, though Grass-types can still sponge Thunderbolts if they have enough Special Defense investment. Grass-type Pokemon and bulky Steel-type Pokemon cannot stand up to Heat Wave though, so even Grass-types can be defeated with proper prediction. The final move on Zapdos is Volt Switch, which allows Zapdos to build momentum, especially in a VoltTurn core. A Choice Specs Volt Switch will damage special walls greatly and allow Zapdos to switch to a teammate better equipped to defeat special walls. The EVs and nature are a no-brainer, Zapdos needs to maximize Speed and Special Attack.</p> <p>Since Choice Specs Zapdos uses Volt Switch to build momentum, partners with U-turn can form a devastating VoltTurn core. Xatu, though it shares all of Zapdos's weaknesses, deserves special mention for reflecting entry hazards with its Magic Bounce ability and maintaining momentum with the move U-turn. If Xatu isn't appealing because of the shared weaknesses, then Zapdos needs either Blastoise or Hitmontop as a partner because they can use Rapid Spin. Each of the two spinners covers one of Zapdos's weaknesses: Blastoise resists Ice while Hitmontop resists Rock. Raikou is another user of Volt Switch, and the addition of Raikou to a team with Zapdos forms the fearsome double Electric core. Zapdos's superior power can muscle through the special walls of UU, weakening Pokemon such as Snorlax and Umbreon which Raikou can clean up. Raikou's great Speed and power can be great for mopping up a weakened opposing team. Stealth Rock support is greatly appreciated by Zapdos since without entry hazard support, Zapdos will need a critical hit to defeat the special walls of the tier. Spikes are also acceptable since most walls take the same amount of damage from one layer of Spikes as they do from Stealth Rock.</p> "

If Zapdos can switch in on resisted special attacks or weak neutral hits, it can fire off a powerful Thunderbolt, recover its health with Roost, or spread the ever-annoying Toxic upon its foes. Roost is the cornerstone of this set for obvious reasons: it preserves Zapdos's health. Thunderbolt is a generic attacking option, but Discharge is usually better because it can spread paralysis and facilitate a sweep by a partner. Heat Wave and Toxic are great moves on Zapdos, but only one of them should be used since Zapdos absolutely needs Hidden Power (either Ice or Grass, whichever fits Zapdos's team better) or it risks being walled by Swampert, Rhyperior, Flygon, and Gligar. Roar is a fantastic choice for a move since it deals with Calm Mind users, such as Suicune, who laugh at Zapdos's uninvested Thunderbolts.</p> <p>Partners for Zapdos are Pokemon that can take advantage of the support Zapdos provides and those that maximize Zapdos's potential. Rapid Spin support is a godsend for Zapdos since if Stealth Rock is removed (or prevented with Magic Bounce!), then Zapdos will not have to worry about entry hazard damage for the entire match. Entry hazards on the opposing team's side are welcome since Zapdos can flat-out wall so many Pokemon. If Zapdos switches in on a Pokemon that cannot touch it, then the opponent is forced to switch Pokemon, incur entry hazard damage, and take damage from one of Zapdos's attacks if you choose to attack. However, Zapdos has its shortcomings. It is not especially bulky even with near-maximum investment, and will eventually fall to extremely high-powered attacks such as Victini's V-create. Zapdos also fears status like the plague since it does not really have the option to run Substitute—while Substitute is viable on Zapdos, it will then have to give up a nice coverage option or status move. For that reason, Heal Bell and Aromatherapy support from the likes of Togekiss and Roserade are appreciated.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This is a unique set which is quite effective against the popular Fire / Water / Grass cores, using Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice to form a pseudo-BoltBeam combination. Save for Swampert, this set usually comes out on top against most Pokemon commonly found in such cores. Thunderbolt is this set's generic STAB move, and Hidden Power Ice is usually the best coverage move to use alongside it. However, Hidden Power Flying is also a good option because it receives STAB and retains good neutral coverage; for example, Spikes Roserade is always 2HKOed by Hidden Power Flying. This set can be used in two different ways: a bulkier variant with access to Roost and decent coverage, or a purely offensive variant that sacrifices recovery for even better coverage in the form of Heat Wave; Roost is superior most of the time, though.</p> <p>This set must be played in different ways throughout the match. Early-game, Zapdos should use its great 383 Special Attack in tandem with Life Orb to wear down the opponent and wreak havoc on unprepared teams. Roost must then be used to increase Zapdos's longevity. Finally, late-game, Zapdos can use Agility to avoid being revenge killed by a Choice Scarf users such as Flygon or Darmanitan, easily OHKOing them with Hidden Power Ice and Thunderbolt, respectively.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Zapdos will outrun Choice Scarf Mienshao after an Agility boost, hit like a truck due to maximum Special Attack, and be bulky enough to act as a pivot when needed. However, a 112 HP / 252 SpA / 144 Spe spread may be used in order to outrun Modest maximum Speed Kingdra in the rain, as well as Timid Choice Scarf Raikou. Zapdos can also use max Speed to outrun Jolly Heracross and Timid Nidoking. Another option is to forgo Roost for Heat Wave and use Hidden Power Grass in order to gain better coverage; however, this would require sacrificing Zapdos's defensive capabilities. Baton Pass works well along with Agility, and can be used at the cost of coverage or a loss in durability. However, Baton Pass is generally an inferior option because it diminishes this set's effectiveness as a standalone sweeper.</p> <p>This set really appreciates entry hazard and Rapid Spin support if Zapdos is on a balanced or bulky offensive team. If you are using an offensive team, the pressure of your sweepers often acts as good team support by minimizing the chances of the opponent using Rapid Spin and placing entry hazards. Good teammates for this set are physical attackers such as Hitmontop—who can also use Rapid Spin—and Machamp because they can beat many of Zapdos's counters, namely Snorlax, Umbreon, and Rhyperior.</p> "

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Legend has it that a phoenix's flame never dies out. Moltres, who was so dominant in previous generations, rises up from the ashes to grace UU once more, igniting all that come before it with its majestic powers. With an impressive base 125 Special Attack, Moltres can scorch even the bulkiest of walls by unleashing a barrage of Fire Blasts upon these unfortunate foes. With excellent bulk and access to Roost, it seems as if the phoenix truly is indestructible. However, the most recent episode of Mythbusters has proven that all it takes to slay Moltres is to toss a pebble at it. As just about every team carries a Stealth Rock user, Moltres is unable to fully spread its wings. Furthermore, with bulky Waters, such as Suicune of the North Wind, looking on, Moltres finds itself backed into tight corner. However, even with the chink in its armor revealed, Moltres is a force to be reckoned with, for if one neglects to deal with it, it will swiftly devour the opposing team in its regal flames.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Safeguard is another way to protect Moltres from status, but Substitute is generally a superior option, and Moltres will more often than not just be firing off powerful attacks left and right. Ancient Power can be used to hit Rotom-H, who resists Moltres's three most common attacks, and can threaten in return with Volt Switch. Rest can be used instead of Roost to rid Moltres of both status and damage, but the risks associated with being asleep for two turns makes it unappealing. Finally, if you're feeling gutsy, you could attempt a SunnyBeamer set to draw in and take out weakened bulky Waters, while simultaneously boosting Fire Blast's destructive potential. However, this is a gimmick at best, and Moltres would be much better off using this moveslot for Roost or Flame Charge instead.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When dealing with Moltres, the most obvious course of action would be to get Stealth Rock onto the field. Although Moltres will almost surely be paired with a spinner, Stealth Rock will still dissuade Moltres from coming in for a number of turns. Aerodactyl is an excellent choice; it can set up Stealth Rock with ease, as well as force Moltres out thanks to its Rock STAB and superior Speed. Rhyperior is another outstanding check to Moltres that brings the full package to the table. It sets up Stealth Rock, resists the Fire / Flying STAB combination, and breaks through Substitutes with Rock Blast. However, the heavy armor rhino must watch out for Hidden Power Grass itself. Swampert is in a similar boat, as it can easily tank a Fire Blast and either set up Stealth Rock or KO with a Water STAB, but it too fears Hidden Power Grass. Other notable Stealth Rock users include Bronzong, Empoleon, and Registeel, but they all struggle to take a Fire Blast.</p> <p>As far as counters go, Snorlax is probably your best bet. Thanks to its exceptional special bulk and ability, Thick Fat, Snorlax can take a Fire Blast with impunity and either Curse or fire off a powerful attack. Rotom-H resists all three of Moltres's common offensive moves and can threaten it with an Electric STAB. Bulky Waters, such as Suicune and Milotic, can take on most sets, although with Stealth Rock and Spikes support, Moltres could nab a surprise 2HKO. Pokemon that carry Flash Fire, namely Houndoom and Arcanine, are immune to Fire Blast, and can retaliate with Hidden Power Rock and Wild Charge respectively, but both must be wary of Air Slash. A number of revenge killers also fare well against the firebird. Azumarill can take out Moltres with ease with a powerful Choice Band Aqua Jet. Raikou and Zapdos can also outspeed and slay the phoenix with a powerful Thunderbolt.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The first thing that jumps out as you gaze upon Moltres's Pokedex entry is its base 125 Special Attack. Augmented by excellent STAB moves, such as Fire Blast and Air Slash, you have yourself one deadly bird. In fact, Moltres is so offensively potent, that with Stealth Rock and Spikes support, it could even 2HKO Milotic, who is actually considered one of the best Moltres checks in the tier, with Fire Blast! Moltres is certainly no glass cannon, sporting a defensive stat distribution of 90 HP / 90 Def / 85 SpD, and with decent Speed, Moltres is far more durable than its 4x Stealth Rock weakness would indicate. Fire Blast and Air Slash provide it with two formidable STABs that hit much of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Hidden Power Grass disposes of those that resist this combination, such as Rhyperior, while simultaneously disposing of troublesome bulky Waters, such as Swampert. Roost is the preferred move in the final slot, as it temporarily removes its weakness to moves such as Thunderbolt, and also cancels out recoil damage from Life Orb or Stealth Rock. However, Flame Charge can be used instead to give Moltres the jump over potential revenge killers.</p> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment capitalizes on Moltres's offensive capabilities, and 0 HP EVs enable it two switches into Stealth Rock. While a Timid nature is preferred to Speed tie opposing base 90s, a Modest nature can be used to increase Moltres's damage output. For the same reason, Life Orb is the item of choice, although if using Flame Charge instead of Roost, Leftovers can be used to provide Moltres with a form of recovery, although this greatly neuters this set's destructive power. Status, especially Thunder Wave, puts a wrench into Moltres's plans, so Substitute can be used to block status, although the recoil damage will build up. Flamethrower can be used in place of Fire Blast if one prefers accuracy over power, although Moltres loses the ability to raze entire teams with just one move.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is the bane of Moltres's existence, and as such, Rapid Spin support is mandatory. Blastoise is an excellent choice, as it resists Water-type moves directed at Moltres, and disposes of troublesome Flash Fire Pokemon, such as Arcanine and Houndoom. The duo forms two-thirds of a Fire, Water, Grass core. Hitmontop is another great teammate, as it not only provides Rapid Spin support, it also disposes of Snorlax, which walls Moltres all day long, courtesy of Thick Fat. Although Stealth Rock sends Moltres screaming like a little girl, the phoenix appreciates entry hazards support of its own; Spikes are especially helpful, as they have the potential to turn numerous 3HKOs into 2HKOs and 2HKOs into OHKOs. Roserade is one of the premier Spikes users in the tier, who also happens to take out those pesky bulky Waters that swarm around Moltres like flies. Grass- and Electric-types, such as Shaymin and Raikou, ensure that Suicune wont ruin our little pyromaniac's fun.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Much like the Life Orb variant, Choice Specs Moltres can make any Pokemon (except Snorlax I guess) think twice about switching in. Especially in the Spikes infested UU tier, Moltres can blast through even the sturdiest walls by virtue of its sky high Special Attack, potentially opening up a sweep for a teammate. Backed by decent Speed and bulk, Moltres is a force to be reckoned with. This Pokemon is certainly not welcomed by those friendly forest animals we all know and love. Although Choice Specs Moltres can send most Pokemon running for the hills upon entrance, it is not without its flaws. First of all, as with any Choice item user, Moltres is expected to switch in and out multiple times throughout the game for fear of becoming setup fodder. While this isn't much of a problem for most Pokemon, Moltres has to contend with Stealth Rock, which effectively limits the volcanic bird to two switch-ins when active. Still, with proper Rapid Spin support, Moltres can find its way around this problem and proceed to execute any walls unfortunate enough to encounter this inferno assassin.</p> <p>Fire Blast can eradicate just about any Pokemon that does not resist it. Those that do resist Fire Blast must answer to Air Slash, which is doubly annoying thanks to the 30% flinch rate. Pokemon that resist this STAB combination, such as Rhyperior, get demolished by Hidden Power Grass. Even bulky Waters, such as Suicune and Milotic, that normally come in with ease, must watch out for Choice Specs Hidden Power Grass. U-turn is a useful move for scouting switch-ins, but be aware that if Stealth Rock is up, U-turn will do more harm than good. Since Moltres is bound to force many switches, U-turn helps the entry hazard damage pile up on the opposing side. Just remember, Moltres is usually much better off using one of its vicious attacks. Just set up entry hazards, sit back, and watch the KOs pile up.</p> <p>A Choice Scarf set is viable to get the jump on faster Pokemon, and would certainly be useful for revenge killing troublesome Pokemon, such as Weavile. Keep in mind, though, that Moltres's greatest asset is its ability to make opposing walls shudder in fear, and it is much more effective firing off a barrage of powerful Specs-boosted attacks. The duty of revenge killer can be left to a less, lets just say, Rock fearing pocket monster. Of course, Flamethrower can be used instead of Fire Blast for accuracy reasons; however, you will miss out on important KOs, including a 2HKO on Milotic after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage. If you opt for a Choice Scarf, though, Flamethrower is certainly an excellent option. Overheat can be used as a one-turn howitzer, but Fire Blast is much more useful in the long run, especially since Overheat forces Moltres to switch, which it should be doing as little as possible.</p> <p>Even more so than the Life Orb set, Stealth Rock prevention is crucial to this set's survival. Hitmontop is an excellent option, as it can take out Snorlax, who would otherwise induce Moltres into fits of rage. It also has access to Foresight to ensure a successful spin, because every turn Stealth Rock remains on the field is a turn Moltres can't even poke its head out of its nest. Blastoise is another Pokemon with access to Foresight, and has great defensive synergy alongside the blazing phoenix. Moltres would also love to just spam Choice Specs Fire Blasts, so carrying a Water-type, such as Suicune, Milotic, and the aforementioned Blastoise would certainly help. They, along with Roserade, form a solid Fire, Water, Grass core, where Roserade provides the Spikes support, Blastoise provides the spin support, and Moltres provides the firepower (pun not intended). Pokemon that can dispatch bulky Waters, such as Shaymin and Zapdos, are always welcome teammates. Pokemon that provide Spikes, such as Qwilfish, are welcomed guests as well.</p> "

        "description": "<p>The phoenix is a mythical bird that never dies; legend has it that each time tragedy befalls it, it revives itself to grace the Earth once more. This set may have had some influence on that legend, for SubRoost Moltres is incredibly difficult to bring down. Moltres is generally thought of as a ferocious attacker who scorches the Earth with its mighty flames, but it also has underrated bulk. This, on top of a solid defensive typing (pretend Stealth Rock doesn't exist), as well as a solid stalling ability in Pressure, means Moltres is quite an impressive wall as well. Even with Stealth Rock in play, Moltres can often stop a number of powerful attackers in their tracks, such as Machamp, Heracross, Escavalier, and Cobalion.</p> <p>Substitute and Roost keep Moltres healthy, status free, and happy to serve you game after game. Substitute, of course, blocks Toxic, Thunder Wave, and other troublesome moves targeted at Moltres, while simultaneously acting as a buffer against potential revenge killers and easing prediction. Roost, on the other hand, provides Moltres with valuable healing, and can cancel out Stealth Rock damage should Moltres be dragged out by a rogue Roar before you have a chance to spin. In tandem with Pressure, Moltres can also attempt to Roost stall moves, such as Thunderbolt. Toxic is Moltres's status move of choice, as Moltres could easily stall out a myriad of threats between Substitute and Roost. It has excellent coverage alongside Flamethrower, Moltres's most reliable STAB move.</p> <p>224 Speed EVs allow Moltres to outpace max Speed Rotom-H and neuter it with Toxic, behind a Substitute of course. 248 HP EVs ensure maximum overall bulk, and enable 2 switches into Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense, as the majority of Moltres's targets are physically oriented. Will-O-Wisp can be used in place of Toxic, but mono Fire-coverage leaves Moltres helpless against Flash Fire versions of Houndoom and Arcanine. Air Slash can be used in place of Flamethrower, but Flamethrower is necessary to dispose of Escavalier and crew. Protect can be used to rack up status damage, but Substitute is generally a superior option, as it blocks status.</p> <p>As with any good team that employs Moltres, Rapid Spin support is a necessity. While this set is more self sufficient, and doesn't despise Stealth Rock as much as the previous two sets, you would be much better off using that turn to use Substitute or Toxic instead of Roost. As previously mentioned, Hitmontop and Blastoise are your two best choices. Both have access to Foresight; the former can take out the ever so annoying Snorlax, while the latter can take Water-type moves directed at Moltres. This set definitely needs a teammate to get rid of bulky Waters, as it does not have the offensive potential to bring them down, nor can it stall them out between Substitute and Roost. Pokemon such as Shaymin, Raikou, and Zapdos are great as always, but Roserade is still probably the best choice. This time, rather than carrying Spikes, Roserade can provide Toxic Spikes to make Moltres's life that much easier.</p> "

Feraligatr's solid typing and decent bulk complement these features well, affording it many opportunities to sweep. Unfortunately for the gator, it struggles to actually OHKO a majority of the top UU defensive threats without major entry hazard support, and is easily OHKOed by a tickle from any special Grass- or Electric-type move.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Feraligatr gets Rest and Sleep Talk along with defenses on par with Blastoise's; however it can't Rapid Spin and is generally outclassed in a defensive role by other bulky Waters.

Feraligatr can use Superpower to break through Ferroseed, but it will lower Feraligatr's Attack and Defense and therefore hinder its sweep. Lastly, Feraligatr has a decent special movepool, but sadly lacks the stats to use it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Tangrowth and Slowbro can both switch in, take any of Feraligatr's attacks, and threaten it with Power Whip or cripple it with status; however, they have to be wary of Substitute variants.

Waterfall is Feraligatr's main STAB move; it deals consistent damage, has a useful flinch chance, and receives a large boost in power should Feraligatr activate its Torrent ability. Ice Punch allows Feraligatr to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Waterfall for super effective damage. In the third slot, Earthquake grants Feraligatr neutral coverage on the myriad Water-types in UU, as well as super effective coverage on Registeel. Alternatively, Low Kick can OHKO Registeel but deals much less damage to most Water-types. The EVs for this set allow Feraligatr to outrun positive-natured base 120 Speed Pokemon such as Sceptile after one boost.</p> <p>Feraligatr, like all set-up sweepers, greatly appreciates dual screens support to afford it more opportunities to set up and sweep. Since Feraligatr outright loses to bulky Water-types like Slowbro, bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth make fantastic partners. Bulky Will-O-Wisp users, such as Weezing and Mew, put a major halt to any Feraligatr sweep as well, making Rotom-H a great partner to threaten both Water- and Grass-type Pokemon with its STAB attacks. Rotom-H can also switch in on Will-O-Wisp freely and Trick a Choice item to cripple a wall. Roserade is another good partner for Feraligatr; it can switch in easily on many of Feraligatr's counters and defeat them, particularly most Shaymin and Tangrowth, and can also set up Toxic Spikes to wear down walls. Hazard support in general is extremely useful, aiding Feraligatr's sweep by allowing it to net more KOs.</p> "

Waterfall and Return grant it perfect neutral coverage against everything in UU bar Empoleon and the rare Ferroseed, while Aqua Jet allows Feraligatr to dispatch faster, frail Pokemon which would otherwise easily revenge kill Feraligatr. For an example of the sheer power of this set, Feraligatr 2HKOes Slowbro, the premier physical wall of UU, after one Swords Dance. Waterfall also 2HKOes Empoleon after a Swords Dance, so practically nothing can wall Feraligatr after it has managed to grab a boost.</p> <p>This set also appreciates screens to facilitate setting up, especially because it can't outspeed as many Pokemon as the Dragon Dance set can. As Swords Dance Feraligatr can break through walls much more easily, faster Pokemon that can survive Aqua Jet, such as Shaymin and Roserade, are the greater worry. Teammates that can switch into Grass- and Electric-type attacks and KO Feraligatr's checks to open the way for a sweep are therefore ideal. Rotom-H is once again a good partner, Tricking Choice items onto walls and easily taking the Grass- and Electric-type attacks that plague Feraligatr. Other Pokemon that appreciate bulky Waters being eliminated pair well with this Feraligatr.

Additionally, Substitute shields Feraligatr from priority and Grass- and Electric-type attacks that would end its sweep.

With bulk uncharacteristic of offensive powerhouses, Azumarill is not flimsy either, being able to take most hits. It's also an excellent revenge killer due to STAB priority in Aqua Jet, which has excellent neutral coverage. Walling Azumarill is a difficult feat due to its access to all the coverage it needs in Ice Punch and Double-Edge. The only thing that Azumarill really has going against it is its mediocre Speed, which is mitigated by Aqua Jet. Overall, Azumarill is a top choice for a Pokemon in UU and should be considered for any team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Azumarill has a few other halfway-decent options. The shining star among these is a Substitute + Focus Punch set. A Fighting-type attack with a high 150 Base Power as well as protection from revenge killers and status seems excellent on paper, but it doesn't provide much in the way of coverage and such a set is much weaker than the Choice Band variant. A Life Orb might seem like a decent item choice so Azumarill can switch moves, but it impairs Azumarill's beloved bulk. You could run Encore over a coverage move, but Azumarill is better off attacking its foes than playing around with them. Oh, just one more note, don't use any of Azumarill's other abilities. They disfigure its beautiful might and render it a useless piece of excrement. Seriously, don't do it, or you might just find the entirety of the ladder pointing and laughing at you, a gleeful smirk etched upon their faces as they effortlessly shrug off Azumarill's assaults.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Despite Azumarill's overwhelming power, it has some weaknesses that can be easily exploited. The first of these is that it lacks a way to break some bulky Water-types. Slowbro can cripple Azumarill with a burn and wear it down with Psyshock while having Regenerator to heal off any damage taken. Suicune pretty much perpetually walls Azumarill and can use it as setup fodder. Empoleon is 3HKOed by Waterfall and Double-Edge, but it can take any other attack bar the rare Superpower. However, it is not doing much in return outside of trying to burn Azumarill. Shaymin is another excellent way to counter Azumarill, as it takes a pittance from even Waterfall and can sap Azumarill's health with Leech Seed or outright KO it with Seed Flare. The only move it has to worry about is Ice Punch.</p> <p>There are two more major Pokemon that Azumarill has trouble with—Zapdos and Cofagrigus. Offensive Zapdos is not KOed by Aqua Jet but falls to Waterfall; defensive variants can take a Waterfall but lack the firepower to OHKO Azumarill. On the other hand, Cofagrigus is basically the bane of Azumarill's existence. Mummy removes Huge Power, which leaves Azumarill useless, and Cofagrigus takes little from Aqua Jet and can comfortably tank a Waterfall. Cofagrigus can even carry Will-O-Wisp to render Azumarill fully incapable of hurting anything. It can also set up a free Trick Room, which can turn the tables on Azumarill and its team.</p> <p>If for whatever reason your team lacks one of the above Pokemon, there is no need to despair. Thanks to Azumarill's abysmal Speed, it can be worn down easily by powerful attacks if it is locked into a move other than Aqua Jet. A few examples of these are Choice Band Flygon's Outrage, Choice Band Heracross's Megahorn, and Life Orb Mienshao's Hi Jump Kick. Beating Azumarill in all actuality is not very difficult, but be sure to have a reliable method regardless—otherwise you might just be its latest victim.</p> ",

Speaking of Aqua Jet, when Azumarill's high power and STAB are taken into account, it is one of the most powerful priority attacks in all of Pokemon, capable of OHKOing offensive Pokemon like Darmanitan, Rotom-H, and Nidoking. The excellent neutral coverage it has is also arguably superior to that of all other priority moves.</p> <p>If Aqua Jet were a pistol, then Waterfall would be a nuke. Very few moves in UU can match Azumarill's Waterfall's power level, and none without drawbacks. All but the bulkiest of resists are smashed into pieces by it. However, many bulky Water resists exist in UU, so coverage moves to hit them are needed. Double-Edge is the first of these, hitting bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Milotic, Slowking, and Blastoise hard. In fact, it 2HKOes all but Slowbro after Stealth Rock damage. The other coverage move is Ice Punch, which hits Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin hard.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Azumarill to outrun Porygon2, hit hard, and take a ton of punishment. A decent alternative is to transfer the HP EVs to Speed, which allows Azumarill to outrun Blastoise and Milotic, both of which are 2HKOed by Double-Edge. However, the loss in bulk is quite noticeable, and all Azumarill really avoids with those Speed EVs is being burned by Scald, so keeping the EVs in HP is usually best. While the given moves are generally the best choices, a few other moves are viable as well. Superpower can be used to hit Cobalion, Empoleon, Registeel, and Porygon2 hard. It also OHKOes defensive Snorlax and allows Azumarill to check +1 Curse variants. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Water-types, but is really only for Slowbro because Double-Edge hits the rest hard enough. Return is a possible replacement for Double-Edge due to its lack of recoil, but the lower damage output means it won't even 2HKO its main targets.</p> <p>The best way you can support Azumarill is to take out bulky Water resists. Bulky Water-types are the first obstacle to deal with; an offensive Grass-type, such as Shaymin or Roserade, or Zapdos is recommended to defeat them. Roserade also has the option of setting up Toxic Spikes, which makes tanking hits from Azumarill all the more difficult. Since Roserade falls to Waterfall, Shaymin, Amoonguss, and Virizion are the only Grass-types you need to worry about. A Fire-type, such as Darmanitan or Arcanine, is recommended to roast them. Entry hazards are required for Azumarill to break through some walls, so Pokemon such as Accelgor, the aforementioned Roserade, and Cobalion make great partners. Wish support is also helpful to keep Azumarill in prime condition to take attacks, as it is worn down easily. However, you typically won't find the time to use it on the offensively-inclined teams you'll use Azumarill on, as the primary Wish users are all very defensive or share weaknesses with Azumarill, such as Alomomola, Umbreon, and Clefable. As has been made quite obvious, Fire / Water / Grass cores are Azumarill's preferred home. Rotom-H / Roserade / Azumarill is a stellar example. Azumarill can defeat two of Rotom-H's biggest counters, Snorlax and Umbreon, while Rotom-H breaks Shaymin. Roserade provides Spikes or potentially Toxic Spikes, counters Milotic, and soft checks Slowbro. Azumarill breaks Fire-types for Roserade. Arcanine / Shaymin / Azumarill is another core that has a bit more bulk. Essentially, if you want Fire-types gone, Azumarill is your solution. Lastly, you might want to consider Snorlax as a partner because it counters Zapdos and other Electric-types.</p> "

  "Hitmonlee": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmonlee is one of the few Pokemon in the game--let alone UU--with the ability Unburden. With its ability, Hitmonlee can double its Speed immediately and become an extremely threatening sweeper, like Yanmega and Sharpedo. That's not all Hitmonlee has going for it: it has a whopping base 120 Attack, a decent base 87 Speed, and great offensive options to utilize them with. Hitmonlee has a surprisingly high Special Defense to boot, which allows it to survive extremely powerful special attacks, such as Zapdos's Thunderbolt and Raikou's Extrasensory, and retaliate with a powerful attack of its own. Unfortunately, the fun ends there; Hitmonlee has an extremely low base Defense of 53, which makes it difficult for it to survive even resisted physical hits. However, with sufficient team support and good play, Hitmonlee can sweep whole teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Bulk Up set can be used to patch up Hitmonlee's weak Defense stat while complementing its high Special Defense; however, it does not have synergy with its two main attacking moves, High Jump Kick and Close Combat, as High Jump Kick can cause problems with a miss and Close Combat negates Bulk Up boosts. A Reckless set with Life Orb has a niche thanks to Mach Punch, but is outclassed by Mienshao as a faster and more powerful sweeper. Knock Off is an option to remove items from bulky enemies such as Eviolite Gligar and Porygon2, or Leftovers from common switch-ins such as Suicune, Slowbro, and Crobat. This gives Hitmonlee an easier time beating its checks over the course of the match. However, this sacrifices an important coverage move. Hitmonlee can fulfill a niche as a Rapid Spin user, but is generally a much better offensive Pokemon than a support Pokemon. Close Combat can be used with Limber if you want reliability with power, although it's then outclassed by the other Fighting-types in UU. Choice Band can be used for High Jump Kick spam, but not only is it outclassed by Mienshao and Heracross, it is also unhealthy to be spamming High Jump Kick with Ghost-types so common in UU.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gligar is a unique enemy, using Eviolite to become an unbreakable wall with a resistance to Fighting-type attacks, and Earthquake or Toxic to finish off 1 HP Hitmonlee. Hitmonlee therefore must enlist the help of its allies to take it out. Psychic-types, such as Slowbro, Mew, Cresselia, and Uxie, can resist a powerful Reversal and strike back with a super effective Psychic. However, they are unable to take more than one hit and must be kept healthy in order to survive. Ghost-types can also attack with Shadow Ball, as Reversal cannot touch them at all. Some of them, such as Sableye and Cofagrigus, can even use Will-O-Wisp to burn and cripple Hitmonlee for the rest of the match. Finally, Poison-types are also able to resist Fighting-type attacks and strike back with Toxic, causing Hitmonlee to be unable to live indefinitely at 1 HP. Qwilfish is especially effective here, as it can Intimidate Hitmonlee and neutralize the effects of its Liechi Berry.</p> ",

        "name": "Endure + Reversal Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>Stacked boosts have always been a force to reckon with in battle. Hitmonlee uses this principle as its strategy for success. By consuming its Liechi Berry, it is able to obtain a power boost of 150%. Using up its item also permits the activation of Unburden, doubling its Speed and allowing it to outspeed the entirety of the UU metagame, including Kingdra in rain and Choice Scarf Raikou. Finally, 1 HP Reversal is a 200 Base Power nuke that can destroy all opponents that do not resist it. All this can be triggered in just one turn by using the move Endure, the catalyst for ultimate destruction. The science behind its power is this: Reversal's 200 Base Power, equivalent to Snorlax's Self-Destruct in this generation, multiplied by 1.5x because of Liechi Berry then another 1.5x thanks to STAB, results in an eventual raw Base Power destruction of 450, which will OHKO all Pokemon that do not resist it.</p> <p>Hitmonlee is a flexible and versatile fighter, and can use various moves to break down its counters. Stone Edge is a popular choice, as it is able to bombard the Bug- and Flying-type enemies that resist Reversal; Earthquake is another hot option to take down the various Poison-types. If Earthquake is not needed, Close Combat, which is also boosted by its STAB, is an option to crush opponents while Hitmonlee is healthy. These powerful attacks are boosted by its Liechi Berry as well, therefore making no difference if they are used at 25% HP or at 1 HP. If Hitmonlee happens to consume the Liechi Berry, yet not quite at the 1 HP to unleash Reversal, it can spam the relevant coverage move to destroy enemies before it, only using Endure to maximize Reversal when absolutely necessary.</p> <p>Hitmonlee's blazing Speed lets it outspeed even the fastest foes, such as Kingdra under rain and Choice Scarf Raikou and OHKO them with Reversal. In order to lure opponents into triggering Endure, Hitmonlee can elect to feint its opponents with Fake Out, causing its opponents to let down their guard and attack Hitmonlee, only to become victims of the Endure and Reversal combination. Mach Punch is a plausible option to strike the opponent with priority, being able to bypass the priority of other Pokemon after Endure and bypass the Speed of other Pokemon before Enduring.</p> <p>Some enemies have priority to outspeed Hitmonlee, such as Azumarill, Honchkrow, Bisharp, and Houndoom, and KO it at 1 HP. Mach Punch can be used to finish off these weakened enemies. Arcanine's Extreme Speed can take down Hitmonlee in the blink of an eye, so it should be destroyed before Hitmonlee appears on the battlefield. Gligar and Qwilfish resist Reversal, and have massive Defense stats that allow them to tank multiple Reversals. To sweep, Hitmonlee will need aid from teammates to either severely weaken or remove them. Offensive Water- and Electric-types, such as Hidden Power Ice Raikou and Earthquake Swampert, can eradicate these foes with their STAB attacks. Psychic- and Ghost-types also resist Reversal. Choice Band Snorlax or Weavile, can be called upon to eliminate these threats from the field with Pursuit. Hitmonlee is helpless against opponents who drop poisoned Toxic Spikes onto the field, therefore it requires the aid of Poison-types or Rapid Spin users such as Blastoise or Claydol in removing them before entering the field.</p> "

  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>For a Pokemon that spends the majority of its life balancing on the tip of its head, Hitmontop is no pushover. This plucky little Fighting-type takes its place in UU through the combination of its bulk, Intimidate, and Rapid Spin. One of the best utility checks in the tier, Hitmontop is one of the few Pokemon that can stop Choice Scarf Heracross from sweeping through a team and still perform its other duties. However, the large number of offensive Ghost-types in UU makes it difficult for Hitmontop to use Rapid Spin if it wants to stay in one piece. Add to that the ubiquitous Flying- and Psychic-types in the tier and Hitmontop really has its work cut out for it. Hitmontop also proves itself something of a liability on more offensive teams, and cannot be haphazardly thrown onto a team despite its role as a supporting Pokemon. Despite these limitations, Hitmontop is very good at what it does.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sadly, Hitmontop is very limited in terms of what it can do in UU. The old standby TechniTop has fallen to the wayside, as too many Pokemon like Zapdos, Yanmega, and Cofagrigus can freely switch into Hitmontop's moves and deal heavy damage both to it and the rest of your team. A Bulk Up set might seem like a good idea, but it is outclassed by other Bulk Up or Curse users such as Scrafty and Snorlax, and it also lacks both the power and the bulk to do its job without excessive support. The rest of Hitmontop's movepool also has a few options that have not yet been mentioned, but they are sorely outclassed. Brick Break and Triple Kick lack the power to deal effective damage, and Triple Kick is also inconsistent in terms of both damage output and accuracy. Earthquake or Technician Bulldoze might seem like good ideas for hitting Nidoqueen and Nidoking, but they have redundant coverage with Hitmontop's STAB moves. Finally, Counter is an acceptable move if you don't mind letting Hitmontop take a few hits. It has decent surprise value, but it is neither reliable nor recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hitmontop has a lot of Pokemon that can counter it under the right circumstances, but most of them must beware of at least one move from Hitmontop. Mew is one of the few exceptions to this rule; any set with Heal Bell or a Lum Berry can switch into and destroy Hitmontop with near impunity. Togekiss can somewhat claim the same for Heal Bell sets, but less bulky sets must beware of switching into Stone Edge. Nidoqueen and Nidoking both run roughshod over Hitmontop; it is hapless to do anything against them one-on-one. Even eliminating Stealth Rock is beyond it when faced with the offensive power of the royal pains. Cofagrigus, Slowbro, Gallade, and Sableye all hate Toxic, but otherwise laugh at anything Hitmontop could do and easily set up on it. Zapdos can check Hitmontop, but it hates both Stone Edge and Toxic, particularly if it is running an offensive set. Similarly, bulky Roserade can act as a solid check to Hitmontop, but repeated switch-ins can wear it down, as Close Combat and Stone Edge deal around 35% damage. Tricking a Choice item to Hitmontop cuts down on its effectiveness, but can also create more of a problem if Hitmontop manages to make use of the boost it gives. Ultimately, Hitmontop isn't the problem so much as the support it provides. Either have something that spits on everything it can do or take it out quickly, else you <em>will regret it for the entirety of the match.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Rapid Spin",
        "description": "<p>Hitmontop's only real niche in UU is that of a bulky Rapid Spin user, and it performs its job admirably. Between Hitmontop's physical bulk, Intimidate, and its Fighting typing, it becomes capable of spinning against a large portion of the metagame. Foresight combines with Rapid Spin to make it impossible to stop Hitmontop from spinning unless your opponent is packing two Ghost-types. Unfortunately, if your opponent lacks a Ghost-type, it becomes a wasted moveslot instead. If you'd rather not take that risk, Toxic is available as a more passive option. It's good for wearing down the bulkier Ghost-types, such as Cofagrigus and Sableye, if you can predict the switch-in, and most of Hitmontop's checks and counters also hate being badly poisoned. Sucker Punch and Stone Edge are Hitmontop's coverage options. Sucker Punch complements Hitmontop's STAB and is good for picking off weakened enemies, while Stone Edge gives Hitmontop a fighting chance (no pun intended) against Flying-types, like Zapdos and Crobat, which is greatly appreciated. Close Combat rounds out the moveset as Hitmontop's most reliable STAB move; it has a good combination of high power and low risk, and the stat drops are easily mitigated both by Intimidate and timely switching.</p> <p>Most of Hitmontop's other options are either outclassed or not worth considering. Aerial Ace is nice to use against Heracross and other Fighting-types that Hitmontop will often be used to check, but forfeiting the coverage of Stone Edge or the priority of Sucker Punch isn't worth it. It also seriously lacks power without the boost from Technician. Rest is decent if you have access to Heal Bell support, but otherwise it's a terrible idea that turns Hitmontop into dead weight that the remainder of your team has to compensate for; you're probably better off sticking to Wish support or choosing to forgo extra healing moves entirely. Low Kick and Revenge are more conservative Fighting-type STABs, but they are not as consistent as Close Combat in terms of damage output. On the other end of the scale, High Jump Kick is a much riskier STAB, but has slightly more power, although it's generally not worth it. Finally, Pursuit might seem like a good idea for picking off Foresight-stricken Ghosts-types if they attempt to switch out, but they're just as likely to attack.</p> <p>Hitmontop is capable of acting as a solid utility check thanks to its extensive physical bulk and Intimidate. Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Heracross and Krookodile, Speed Boost Sharpedo, Flygon, Weavile, and even Swords Dance Cobalion are all examples of Pokemon that Hitmontop is capable of stopping. Hard-hitting Pokemon, such as Yanmega, Darmanitan, Weavile, and Zapdos, all enjoy the removal of entry hazards and appreciate Hitmontop's ability to block the aforementioned threats. Hitmontop itself also requires team support to function effectively. First and foremost are Dark-types, particularly those with access to Pursuit, like Honchkrow, Weavile, and Houndoom, which are capable of running down Ghost-types that would block Hitmontop's Rapid Spin and can also pick off Psychic-types, such as Mew and Azelf, which otherwise have a field day switching into Hitmontop and setting up. Hitmontop also has issues with Flying-types, particularly Togekiss and Crobat. Thus, a Flying-type resist is almost mandatory; Bronzong, Bisharp, and Rhyperior are all good choices for this position. Bulky Zapdos is also a decent pick because it can pick off opposing Flying-types with STAB, super effective Electric attacks and heal off any damage with Roost. Umbreon is one of the best Hitmontop partners because in addition to sponging special attacks aimed at Hitmontop, it can easily pass Wishes to keep Hitmontop healthy and heal off nasty status from Hitmontop with Heal Bell. The two have great defensive synergy as well, making them an effective defensive core.</p> "

Sceptile's movepool is considerably large, having access to a myriad of physical moves along with Swords Dance. On top of that, it possesses quite a few special moves. Sceptile can also run a very effective Substitute + Leech Seed set due to its high speed. BW has granted Sceptile the ability Unburden, which is somewhat unnecessary for Sceptile, but allows it to outspeed even Choice Scarf users after the ability has been activated.

Perhaps the only other set worth mentioning is one of Endeavor and Quick Attack combined with a Focus Sash, which allows Sceptile to defeat almost anything that is not a Ghost-type. However, with the prevalence entry hazards and Ghost-types, this strategy is rather ineffective in the UU metagame, and Sceptile has much better sets to run. Sceptile has an expansive movepool consisting of both physical and special moves, and also has an interesting support movepool with moves such as Synthesis, Safeguard, and Grass Whistle, but none of these are viable options on any of the aforementioned sets due to Sceptile's lack of bulk and moveslots.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Specially defensive Registeel isn't 2HKOed by Focus Blast and is able to cripple Sceptile with Thunder Wave or Toxic in return.

Sceptile also has access to other physical coverage moves such as X-Scissor, Crunch, Dragon Claw, Bullet Seed, Brick Break, Drain Punch, Thunder Punch, Low Kick, Pursuit, and Quick Attack, but they do not provide the same coverage that Rock Slide and Earthquake or Earthquake and Acrobatics do.

First of all, it lacks reliable recovery, which means it cannot stand up to many hits. It also has a terrible quadruple weakness to Grass, so Shaymin and Tangrowth can switch in with impunity.

Swampert is not a wall, but rather a tank; if you try to sponge neutral attacks with the mud fish, then you'll find Swampert's HP dropping to zero far too quickly. However, if you're aware of its typing and take Swampert's limitations into account, then Swampert will be a great asset to your team.</p> ",

Rest and Sleep Talk are Swampert's only form of recovery, but they leave Swampert a sitting duck for three straight turns unless Swampert comes with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support. Swampert has a decent special movepool, so a Choice Specs set is viable, but there's little point in using moves such as Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Sludge Wave, and Hidden Power when its fearsome base 110 Attack and awesome physical coverage goes farther.

Pokemon that commonly run Giga Drain or Hidden Power Grass, such as Yanmega, Zapdos, and Rotom-H, can all come in on an Earthquake or on the revenge kill and beat Swampert with either move. Burns, especially from the omnipresent Scald or from Prankster Sableye, absolutely ruin Swampert because they destroy Swampert's bulk and slash its Attack. Though Swampert has the bulk to take unboosted Scalds all day, it cannot risk a burn. Spikes also wear Swampert down and allow Pokemon such as Sharpedo or Kingdra to break through its defenses.

With the nature and EVs listed, Choice Scarf Flygon fails to 2HKO Swampert and Darmanitan can barely 3HKO Swampert after Leftovers recovery.

Swampert should use a secondary STAB in the second slot, and Scald and Waterfall are the best choices. Scald has the ability to spread burns, which is devastating for most physical attackers. Waterfall, on the other hand, comes off of Swampert's mighty base 110 Attack. However, Scald's burn can be detrimental for teams that rely heavily on inflicting other status problems. If spreading burn is what your team needs, choose Scald. Otherwise, Waterfall will deal a good amount of damage. Earthquake is Swampert's best attacking move, hitting Fire- and Steel-types such as Darmanitan, Cobalion, and Victini super effectively. In the final spot, Swampert has an array of useful support moves, but the choice usually boils down to Toxic versus Roar. If Scald is your Water-type move, then it's best to go with Roar, as Swampert already spreads status with Scald. Toxic is generally a better choice if Waterfall is your secondary STAB, but it's really a decision based on team preference.</p> <p>The purpose of the EVs is to reach a Leftovers number to recover more HP and maximize physical bulk. The remainder of the EVs are put into Attack so Earthquake can hit slightly harder. Swampert's main fault is its lack of recovery, and there are ways to remedy that weakness that can be used in the fourth slot. The first option is Protect, which gives Swampert additional Leftovers recovery, scouts for any unexpected Grass-type moves, and messes with High Jump Kick users such as Mienshao and Scrafty. Rest is the other solution, but it costs a moveslot (potentially two if Swampert uses Sleep Talk) and incapacitates Swampert for two turns. If Swampert uses Rest, it's important to have Aromatherapy or Heal Bell support from Roserade or Togekiss. Both of those Pokemon make good partners for Swampert regardless of Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. Togekiss resists Swampert's lone weakness, and Swampert resists two of Togekiss's three weaknesses. Roserade also resists Grass-type attacks and provides Spikes support, forming a formidable defensive core with Swampert. Offensively, Crobat absorbs any Grass-type attack and can help rack up entry hazard damage through U-turn or blast the opponent with a powerful Brave Bird.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Swampert epitomizes the idea of bulky offense, retaining the offensive set's bulk while cranking the Attack power up to eleven. Earthquake is the main attacking option on Swampert, being so strong that it can even attain an OHKO on Spikes Roserade. For Flying- and Grass-type Pokemon, Swampert can use the consistently powerful Waterfall and Ice Punch, the latter of which is a great coverage move that hits Pokemon weak to Ice just as hard as a neutral Earthquake. Ice Punch will always OHKO Zapdos with Stealth Rock down and has a slight chance to knock it out even without Stealth Rock damage. Superpower rounds out this set by giving Swampert a way to defeat Scrafty, regardless of the set. Stone Edge also works in the fourth slot, but Ice Punch gains equal coverage and the power boost is not worth the lower accuracy. The EVs are straightforward: the Speed EVs let Swampert outspeed Umbreon and base 60 Speed Pokemon that only invest a little in Speed so that none can switch in and stall Swampert. Attack is obviously maximized in order to pack a punch. The remainder of the EVs significantly boost Swampert's bulk, but not enough for Swampert to take powerful STAB attacks repeatedly. Furthermore, there is no Leftovers to boost Swampert's durability, so try to keep Swampert out of the line of fire.</p> <p>There isn't much to change on Choice Band Swampert. You can adjust the EVs to find a more preferable balance between bulk and Speed, but keep in mind that this set is designed to be slow and bulky. Raising Swampert's Speed much is not recommended. Wish and Stealth Rock support, especially the latter, are appreciated, as Swampert needs the extra damage to obtain key 2HKOs, such as against 252/252+ Suicune and 248/252+ Slowbro. Prediction is key, especially on the defensive side, as Swampert does have trouble switching into strong attacks. Swampert can still shrug off resisted and neutral non-STAB attacks from most Pokemon, but can't reliably take many other attacks and expect to last long. Likewise, most Pokemon have extreme difficulty taking hits from Choice Band Swampert, so if Swampert switches in safely it can shift the game's momentum in its user's favor. Choice Band Swampert has an extreme element of surprise as the most common set is the defensive Stealth Rock setter, so the opponent will be shocked when their Roserade is defeated in one hit or Zapdos can't take an Ice Punch. Swampert's favorite teammates include defensive Roserade, as it 4x resists Grass-type attacks and can set up Spikes that make Swampert a pain to switch into; Rhyperior, for setting up Stealth Rock and defeating Flying-type Pokemon reliably; and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Togekiss and Zapdos, to take Grass-type hits and build momentum for Swampert's team. Furthermore, Swampert can safely take the Electric-type moves that give Togekiss and Zapdos headaches.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Tank",
        "description": "<p>Is Swampert not hitting hard enough? Well, this set is the answer. Offensive Swampert combines Swampert's awesome base 110 Attack and great three-move coverage to hit opposing Pokemon much harder than the defensive set does. However, this additional power comes at the expense of Swampert's bulk. The first three attacks of this set are very straightforward; STAB Earthquake is fantastic coming off of Swampert's 350 Attack, able to fell offensive Roserade in one hit and cause severe damage to defensive Roserade sets. Waterfall is an obvious choice for a second move, as it provides decent power with STAB, and great coverage alongside Earthquake. Ice Punch is a great coverage move, smacking Flygon, Gligar, Zapdos, and Grass-types decently hard. However, note that the only Grass-type that's usually beaten in one hit is Roserade, so the other Grass-types can still switch into Swampert without fearing an OHKO. Unlike the defensive set's Ice Punch, this variant can terrorize Togekiss, scoring a 2HKO. The final moveslot should be dedicated to a support move such as Stealth Rock, Roar, or Toxic. Stealth Rock is great if your team otherwise lacks Stealth Rock support, turning many of your team's 2HKOs into OHKOs. However, a move such as Roar or Toxic can discourage opponents from setting up on Swampert.</p> <p>The most important distinction between this Swampert and the defensive variant is that offensive Swampert is considerably less bulky than the defensive one. Fortunately, even with that loss of bulk, this set is still able to deal with Raikou just as well as the defensive variant. Other Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Darmanitan, however, have a much easier time dealing with this set than the defensive one, as their STAB attacks do much more damage. On the other hand, other Pokemon have a much more difficult time switching into this Pokemon as it hits with so much more force than the typical defensive Swampert. For example, offensive Roserade cannot switch into Earthquake or Ice Punch as it is OHKOed 91% of the time, even without Stealth Rock. Defensive Roserade takes upwards of 65% from an Earthquake, which can be enough to pick off a weakened one hoping to use Swampert as setup fodder. Unlike the defensive set, offensive Swampert is able to 2HKO most Pokemon with two neutral hits with the exception of extremely bulky Pokemon such as Umbreon or Tangrowth. Substitute is a great move to use on this set as Swampert forces switches easily, especially on common Pokemon such as Raikou, Xatu, and Choice-locked Pokemon that cannot harm the defensive set. If Swampert decides to use Substitute, it's worth bumping the HP EVs to 252 in order to have 101 HP Substitutes that cannot be broken by Night Shade or Seismic Toss. Roserade is a perfect partner, especially the defensive Spiker set, as it can absorb attacks from Pokemon such as Zapdos. The Spikes that Roserade sets make it tough to switch into a powerhouse like Swampert. Bouffalant gets a special mention here for straight-up absorbing Grass-type attacks and using them as fuel for ridiculously powerful Head Charges. When using this variant of Swampert, it's important to predict well because this Swampert does not have the bulk to take many neutral STAB attacks.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>The UnderUsed tier is filled to the brim with bulky Water-types, and all of them fill some sort of niche the others lack; Blastoise has the valuable Rapid Spin, Slowbro and Slowking boast Fighting-type resistances and nearly endless recovery with Regenerator, Suicune has more overall bulk than all its competitors, and Empoleon and Swampert have unique typings and access to Stealth Rock. It's getting harder to see the niche Milotic holds, but it alone has access to instant recovery and spectacular Special Defense with a pure Water typing. This means that it fills a role similar to Slowking's, but it trades Regenerator for a neutrality to Heracross's Megahorn and Yanmega's Bug Buzz. Also, unlike many bulky Water-types, it has a decent base Speed. Despite having a rather weak Defense, Milotic can still be used on any team needing a check to several of the tier's top threats, but if you're looking for a hard counter, you should look elsewhere.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Milotic can run an offensive set as it has good Special Attack and Speed, but it faces competition from Suicune, which can boost its stats with Calm Mind, and Slowbro, which has worse Speed but better coverage. Refresh eliminates any status crippling Milotic without need for team support, but it's hard to fit into a moveslot and Milotic often doesn't get a chance to use extra moves, as it must often heal to be of any use to its team. Dragon Pulse can check bulky Substitute Kingdra that can tank a Dragon Tail, but Haze already does that. Hidden Power Electric allows Milotic to hit Empoleon, but it doesn't do enough damage to be worth the moveslot. Hypnosis can essentially be an OHKO move, but it's very risky due to its low accuracy. Light Screen can provide team support, but without Light Clay, the effect doesn't last very long.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Roserade fears nothing from Milotic; even a Scald burn can be healed with Natural Cure. Once it's in battle, it can start unleashing its powerful STABs or use the opportunity to set up layers of Spikes to damage Milotic's team. Shaymin is even bulkier than Roserade, and it can use Leech Seed to start draining its counters of health or use Seed Flare and hope for a Special Defense drop. Togekiss is a very effective stallbreaker: it can boost its Special Attack with Nasty Plot, heal damage with Roost, and even clear status with Heal Bell. Milotic can prolong the battle with Haze or Dragon Tail, but because it's on the defensive, it will eventually succumb to Togekiss. Raikou and Zapdos can both threaten Milotic with strong STABs, but they hate being burned by Scald and if entry hazards are on the field, Dragon Tail can increase passive damage. Virizion has a super effective Grass-type STAB, great Special Defense, and setup moves that it can use against Milotic, but physical variants must be mindful of Scald burns. The tier's great stallbreakers, Crobat, Sableye, Mew, and Swords Dance Heracross, can all break Milotic, but they all fear a Scald burn bar Guts Heracross. Snorlax can absorb hits with its high Special Defense and hit back with strong, neutral attacks, but offensive variants are crippled by Scald.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Despite having a low base Defense, Milotic's pure Water typing, which gives it neutrality to almost all common physical attacks, makes it an acceptable choice for a physical tank. Scald provides Milotic with a useful STAB move while also packing the burn chance that can cripple almost any physical attacker (Pokemon with the Guts ability being the exception). Once burned, even the strongest physical attackers, such as Mienshao, struggle to break Milotic. Recover is another vital move; it allows Milotic to stall any burned physical attacker and heal damage taken from switching into powerful physical attackers such as Darmanitan. Ice Beam lets Milotic check several important physical attackers, specifically Flygon and Tornadus, and also deals super effective damage to Grass-types that switch into it. However, the high Special Defense of UU's Grass-types and Milotic's uninvested Special Attack mean the overall effectiveness of the hit is low. Haze makes Milotic a good counter to some setup sweepers, such as Bulk Up Scrafty and Swords Dance Bisharp. Dragon Tail can be used instead to increase passive damage taken by entry hazards and phaze Pokemon that try to force Milotic out, but its low Base Power means that Milotic can no longer reliably check Substitute sweepers.</p> <p>As this set aims to take as many physical attacks as possible, its Defense is maximized. Milotic can also run a specially defensive set of 248 HP / 196 Def / 56 SpD / 8 Spe with a Calm nature to take special hits, such as Yanmega's Bug Buzz, a little better. However, the difference is so little that it usually isn't worth the extra damage Milotic now takes from Darmanitan and Victini's powerful physical Fire-type moves. Grass-types are Milotic's biggest enemy as they don't fear Scald, take very little from Ice Beam, and force Milotic out of battle with their super effective STAB moves. Roserade has a 4x resistance to Grass-types' STABs, threatens them with a super effective STAB Sludge Bomb, and can support its team with Spikes and sometimes Aromatherapy, which can heal Milotic of crippling status. Umbreon is a great special wall that can take special Grass- and Electric-type attacks easily and can also save a statused Milotic with Heal Bell. RestTalk Snorlax is a similarly great special wall, and Choice Band Snorlax can check most special attackers while adding some much-needed power to the team. Even though its Defense is maximized, Milotic still cannot switch into neutral, powerful, STAB moves, namely powerful Fighting-type attacks such as Mienshao's High Jump Kick. Cofagrigus is immune to Fighting-type attacks and serves as a secondary physical wall in case Milotic is defeated. Golurk is also immune to Fighting-type attacks, and while it cannot function as a wall due to its low bulk, it can check Electric-type Pokemon and set up Stealth Rock to support its team.</p> "

  "Dusclops": {
    "overview": "<p>Having received the lowest rank in terms of viability by community consensus, Dusclops is far too passive to be used on a standard UU team. Extremely high defenses are somewhat offset by unreliable recovery options and low HP to the point where Night Shade can KO Dusclops before its typical Rest cycle ends. However, because of its spinblocking status and somewhat niche movepool, it can be of use to stall teams where its lack of offensive presence barely hinders the team. It would also be wise to remember Dusclops's useful typing which allows it to counter the prominent Fighting-types. Before you use Dusclops, always consider other Ghosts like Sableye and Cofagrigus, both of which generally outclass Dusclops.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Seismic Toss is usable over Night Shade should you find yourself weak to some Normal-type threats like Meloetta, although Dusclops can still wear them down with Curse and Will-O-Wisp. Hidden Power Flying can be used solely to beat Heracross and Virizion, the former which can actually otherwise beat Dusclops one-on-one with a Swords Dance Guts set. Since Heracross and Virizion are so dangerous to stall, it may be worth it, although beware of Calm Mind Virizion—it can easily sponge multiple Hidden Powers after a boost because of Dusclops's poor damage output. Shadow Ball is an option to hurt Mismagius switching in, but it won't OHKO either (although Mismagius cannot OHKO back either). A RestTalk set can be used over Curse, but the fifth generation sleep mechanics make this a very poor idea; not to mention it makes Dusclops even more passive than it already is.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Even if you don't plan against Dusclops, your team probably has multiple ways to counter it. It's quite easy to counter Dusclops because it is very easy to set up on as burns and Curse just do not deal enough damage for Dusclops to ward off setup attackers, especially considering how unreliable Dusclops's moves are in most scenarios. Houndoom is among Dusclops's best counters; it happily switches in on Will-O-Wisp and proceed to rip apart Dusclops with boosted Fire moves or its secondary super effective STAB moves. Other Fire-types like Darmanitan and Victini can badly hurt Dusclops too while absorbing Will-O-Wisp, although Dusclops will be able to tank a few hits from them before crumpling. Most special attackers like Porygon-Z and Nidoking can easily beat Dusclops one-on-one and even set up on him. Any form of residual damage quickly forces Dusclops to Rest, which makes it all but completely dead weight, while if Dusclops tries to heal with Pain Split, some smart switches to low health Pokemon can deny Dusclops a chance to heal. If you need to spin past Dusclops, anything with Foresight like Hitmontop and Blastoise can get a spin, although not without suffering a burn. They won't be able to KO Dusclops but they will take away most of its value by spinning. Just keep in mind two things when attempting to counter Dusclops: it will almost never be OHKOed even by super effective STAB moves, so it may be able to dish out a burn against you should you get too cocky, and it is almost always partnered with walls to cover its weaknesses.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Curse",
        "description": "<p>Before you even think of trying this set out on your team, you should be aware that it is only even remotely effective on fully defensive teams. Curse is an almost perfect option to beat last Pokemon setup sweepers that could otherwise demolish defensive teams, namely Bulk Up Scrafty and Nasty Plot Togekiss. It is impossible to shake off the Curse damage apart from switching, which the last Pokemon cannot do, and it does too much damage for the last Pokemon to set up. Curse also works to catch Baton Pass teams which would otherwise be a problem, as they set up easily on a defensive team's passive nature. Night Shade is chosen to deal consistent damage over Seismic Toss as Dusclops can stall out Normal-types anyways with Will-O-Wisp, while Night Shade allows it to beat opposing Dusclops should you invest in Speed. Will-O-Wisp is great to cripple most physical attackers—although mind the accuracy—so Dusclops and its team can more easily stall them. Pain Split adds to Dusclops's already amazing bulk, although it is not reliable at all even with low HP. It does allow it to recover quickly after a Curse should you have to use it mid-game for any reason. Rest, on the other hand, allows Dusclops to fully restore its HP and remove status. However, if it Rests, it has no chance of spinblocking against Blastoise as it can simply constantly phaze out Dusclops to reset the sleep counter and force Dusclops to quickly lose health. For those reasons Pain Split is generally preferred. Even if Dusclops is passive, this set allows it to be the tier's best defensive counter to some major threats like Flygon and Mienshao, but constant U-turns and hazard damage will quickly take a toll on Dusclops, who is further strained from lack of Leftovers because Eviolite is necessary to raise defenses.</p> <p>Because Dusclops is already increasing its physical bulk with Will-O-Wisp, it is completely possible to shift some Defense EVs into Special Defense. Dusclops really wants to help out its team, so having hazard users like Roserade to punish switches that Dusclops might force is helpful, especially since Dusclops can keep those hazards on the field. Roserade can also heal Dusclops of any status with Aromatherapy, which works particularly well if Dusclops is using Rest. Also, Dusclops is one of the few spinblockers that can count itself as a wall, even if it's not a great one, so Dusclops's team doesn't particularly need to focus on physical defenders apart from perhaps one sturdy physical wall. Since Dusclops encourages the opponent to set up on it, it appreciates phazers like Snorlax who can also take strong special moves for Dusclops. Umbreon is also a good partner as it can heal Dusclops of any status including its own Rest with Heal Bell and can pass large Wishes to heal Dusclops should it not find time to use Rest, which is actually a large problem for Dusclops. A spinner such as Blastoise or Hitmontop is advised to prevent Dusclops from being repeatedly worn down by entry hazards.</p> "

It boasts 11 resistances and 1 immunity in exchange for 3 common weaknesses. Registeel faces competition from other Steel-types, however, including Bronzong, Cobalion, and Empoleon. To hinder Registeel even more, it lacks reliable recovery, making it able to be worn down easily. Its three weaknesses are also a big detriment, as they leave Registeel vulnerable to popular threats such as Victini and Heracross.

A Gravity set with Zap Cannon, Focus Blast, and Flash Cannon could be usable, but due to Registeel's low Special Attack and Speed, it is not very viable. A Rain Dance support set could be used, as Registeel's massive defenses will almost always allow it to set up a Rain Dance, all while negating its Fire-type weakness. Aerial Ace is an option if you're desperate to hit Heracross, but it does not serve any other purpose.

Sableye and support Mew can Taunt Registeel, preventing Stealth Rock or a status move, but must look out for Toxic on the switch. Xatu walls Registeel without Shadow Claw, as it can easily Roost off Seismic Toss damage and bounce back status and Stealth Rock. Bulky sweepers with Rest, such as Snorlax, Suicune, and Scrafty, set up on Registeel easily as it does little damage to them and Rest rids them of any status.

    "overview": "<p>At first Empoleon might receive an icy reception from new UU battlers due to its rather lackluster stats; while it possesses a respectable base 111 Special Attack, its Speed is much lower than that of common offensive juggernauts. Defensively, Empoleon faces competition from both Suicune and Milotic, who both boast better specially defensive stats. Although it might seem that Empoleon is outclassed in both offensive and defensive roles, Empoleon has all the right tools to pull off a variety of sets in the competitive UU environment. Thanks to its unique defensive typing, Empoleon can easily wall common UU threats such as Roserade; its tailor-made movepool also allows it to run a powerful sweeping set which can wash away the opponent late game. In terms of pure numerical power, Empoleon cannot hope to beat the powerhouses and bulky behemoths in the UU tier; but if given correct team support, Empoleon can become a huge thorn in your opponents side.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Empoleon doesn't have much else in its movepool. A physical attacking set is plausible thanks to Swords Dance and a STAB priority move in Aqua Jet. However, base 86 Attack isn't very high, and Empoleon will struggle against common threats and walls. RestTalk is Empoleon's only method of recovery, and can be used on the specially defensive set. However, it eats away two of Empoleon's moveslots, meaning that Empoleon will be less useful to your team. Protect lets Empoleon scout common Choice-locked users such as Darmanitan, removing the need for prediction.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In general, the best counters to Empoleon are Electric-types, as most of them do not mind Scald burns and can hit Empoleon hard with a STAB attack. Lanturn is probably the best Empoleon counter. It resists Empoleon's Water-type attacks and takes little from Grass Knot thanks to its light weight. In return, Lanturn can fry Empoleon with an Electric-type attack and even gain momentum against your team with Volt Switch. Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin resist Empoleon's powerful Water-type STAB and can even stomach a Choice Specs Ice Beam at full health. Roserade can put Empoleon to sleep, while Shaymin can Leech Seed Empoleon or hit it with Earth Power. Keep in mind though that Empoleon is only neutral to Grass-type attacks and has an excellent Special Defense stat, even without investment. Standard special walls such as Snorlax are generally good switch-ins to Empoleon as well; however they take a hefty chunk from Torrent boosted Hydro Pumps and can normally do little back to Empoleon bar phazing it out. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Slowking can wall Empoleon that do not carry Grass Knot but cannot usually do much to Empoleon aside from phazing in Suicune's case. Opposing defensive Empoleon also counter Empoleon and can Roar it away. Fast Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Raikou can outspeed a +2 Empoleon and hit it hard with powerful super effective STAB attacks.

Although Empoleon might appear to be outclassed by a whole host of UU attackers in terms of sweeping, the combination of Agility, Substitute, and Petaya Berry quickly turns Empoleon into a terrifying foe to face. Agility lets it double its lackluster Speed in one turn, meaning only priority attackers and the fastest Choice Scarf users will be able to move before Empoleon. After boosting its Speed, Empoleon can then proceed to safely use Substitute. After doing this a few times, Empoleon will be able to lower itself below 25% health and activate Petaya Berry to boost its Special Attack. Coincidentally, Empoleon's health will also be hovering in Torrent range, which further boosts its damage output. After all this has been accomplished, Empoleon will be ready to sweep. Surf is Empoleon's staple attack; after being boosted by STAB, Petaya Berry and Torrent, only dedicated special walls and resists will be able to avoid the OHKO. However, Hydro Pump can be used for its superior damage output at the cost of accuracy. With Hydro Pump, Empoleon can now OHKO Togekiss, specially defensive Zapdos, and specially defensive Escavalier after Stealth Rock while having a chance to OHKO Porygon2 and Cresselia after Stealth Rock! The remaining slot goes to a coverage move to use against Pokemon that resist Water-type attacks. Ice Beam covers Grass-types such as Shaymin and Roserade while Grass Knot takes care of Water-types such as Suicune and Swampert.</p> <p>With maximum Speed EVs, Empoleon will be able to outrun Adamant Choice Scarf Darmanitan and anything slower. The Special Attack is also maximized along with a Modest nature to dramatically increase Empoleon's damage output. However, a Timid nature can be used if Jolly Choice Scarf Heracross is a problem for your team. 30 HP IVs ensure that after using Substitute 3 times from full health, the Petaya Berry will activate. Unfortunately, Empoleon only has room for one coverage move, meaning that it will be walled by certain Pokemon no matter what. If Ice Beam is chosen, then bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Slowking will stop its sweep cold. Shaymin is thus an excellent partner for Empoleon because it threatens Water-types with a powerful Seed Flare. If Empoleon is running Grass Knot, then Victini and Togekiss are excellent teammates due to their ability to take down Grass-types such as Roserade with their STAB attacks. Priority such as Hitmontop's Mach Punch and fast Choice Scarf users such as Flygon will be able to easily finish Empoleon off after it lowers itself into Petaya Berry range. Tangrowth is therefore good teammate, as it easily walls Choice Scarf Flygon and can take priority moves. In return, Empoleon can set up on Ice- and Bug-type attacks directed at Tangrowth.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>A specially defensive set makes the most out of Empoleon's unique defensive typing which lets it wall dangerous threats such as Shaymin, Tornadus, and Kingdra. Stealth Rock is a metagame staple that Empoleon can find multiple opportunities to use thanks to the number of switches it forces. Scald is Empoleon's STAB move that scares out Fire-, Rock-, and Ground-types. Even when uninvested, it hits hard coming off a base 111 Special Attack stat. It also has a great 30% chance to burn the target, which makes physical attackers think twice before switching into Empoleon. Ice Beam allows Empoleon to severely dent common switch-ins such as Shaymin, Roserade, and Zapdos. Although it isn't likely to OHKO any of them, it will bring them down low enough so that another teammate can finish the job. Lastly, Roar is used to shuffle the opponents team and to remove greedy stat boosters such as Raikou hoping to set up on Empoleon, while also racking up entry hazard damage on your opponents team. However, Toxic can be used instead to let Empoleon beat opposing walls and win stall wars. Due to Empoleon's Steel typing, the opponent will not be able to poison Empoleon in return.</p> <p>Maximum investment in Special Defense and HP along with a Calm nature maximizes Empoleon's specially defensive capabilities, letting it take onslaughts from Shaymin and Zoroark. However, the EV spread can be tweaked to boost Empoleon's Defense at the cost of some special bulk. 252 HP / 108 Def / 148 SpD lets Empoleon take Technician Hitmontop's Close Combat and reply with a devastating Scald, which hits hard after the Special Defense drop from Close Combat and has a high chance to burn. Leftovers should be the only item considered as Empoleon would otherwise have no means of recovering its health. Instead of Ice Beam, Empoleon can use Grass Knot to obtain a stronger hit on bulky Water-types such as Slowbro at the cost of being unable to damage Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin. Lastly, Empoleon can replace Roar with the phazing move Yawn which forces switches by threatening your opponent with sleep. However, it is useless against Substitute users and cannot be used if Sleep clause is already activated. Yawn should only be considered if your team has no other sleep inducing moves.</p> <p>As Empoleon covers most special attackers, a sturdy physical wall such as Gligar is a good teammate. Not only does Gligar aptly wall most physical threats in UU, it also has perfect type synergy with Empoleon, resisting Fighting- and Ground-type attacks while being immune to Electric-type attacks. In return, Empoleon can take Water- and Ice-type attacks directed at Gligar. Zapdos also has excellent type synergy with Empoleon and can be EVed towards Defense. Grass-types in general cover many of Empoleon's weaknesses and can threaten Pokemon that Empoleon is afraid of. Shaymin, Roserade, and Tangrowth resist two of Empoleon's weaknesses while scaring out Pokemon such as Swampert. Some special attackers such as Raikou and Zapdos can beat Empoleon, so Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Krookodile are good teammates.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>With Choice Specs, Empoleon eschews the opportunity to sweep for sheer wall breaking power. With its perfect neutral coverage, Empoleon can annihilate common switch-ins. Hydro Pump is Empoleon's STAB attack and hits extremely hard with Choice Specs and a potential Torrent boost; with Torrent activated, Empoleon's Hydro Pump OHKOes Pokemon such as specially defensive Zapdos and Escavalier, and can even 2HKO defensive Roserade after Stealth Rock! Ice Beam pins down common Roserade and Shaymin switch ins, 2HKOing both. It also deals with Flygon, while being a more accurate option against the likes of Rhyperior and Gligar. Grass Knot deals with the many Water-types in the tier, comfortably 2HKOing Slowbro, Suicune, and Kingdra. As Empoleon has perfect coverage in just three moves, the last slot is used for a more reliable STAB move. Scald is useful for its 30% burn chance while Surf has slightly more power. Both have perfect accuracy and should be used when Empoleon can't afford a miss from Hydro Pump. Other offensive Empoleon sets aim to sweep through the opposition late game, but Choice Specs Empoleon seeks to punch holes in the opponents team and clear a path for late-game sweepers such as Raikou and Kingdra.</p> <p>The EV spread is the regular offensive spread; Speed is maximized so that Empoleon can outrun minimum Speed Roserade; Special Attack is also maximized so Empoleon hits as hard as possible. A Modest nature is the best option as it gives Empoleon superior wall breaking power. The Speed boost from Timid is largely irrelevant as Empoleon can already outspeed most walls. However, an alternative EV spread of 208 HP / 252 SpA / 48 Spe lets Empoleon outspeed minimum Speed Umbreon while giving it greater bulk. For example, Empoleon can now take a Choice Scarf Victini's V-Create and retaliate with a Torrent boosted Hydro Pump. Flash Cannon is an alternative STAB move that Empoleon can use to hit Pokemon such as Cryogonal and Weavile hard. However, it has largely redundant coverage and should only be considered if you are afraid of Hydro Pump consistently missing. Sleep Talk is also a move that Empoleon can run to act as a sleep absorber, countering Pokemon such as Roserade. As Empoleon can weaken most special walls, Pokemon such as Raikou and Yanmega appreciate Empoleon's presence and can easily sweep once Pokemon such as Snorlax and Zapdos have been significantly weakened. Defensively, Pokemon such as Gligar and Zapdos are good teammates as they can sponge the Fighting- and Ground-type attacks directed at Empoleon.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<p>This set blends Empoleon's decent defensive typing and high Special Attack stat to make it a formidable Stealth Rock setter, as well as allow it to maintain a great amount of offensive presence. Unlike other Stealth Rock setters, Empoleon is able to keep Stealth Rock on the field due to its ability to defeat every common Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce user. Because of this, this set functions better on offensive teams that don't have room for a spinblocker. Hydro Pump functions as Empoleon's main STAB move, as due to its high Base Power and a Modest nature, it is guaranteed to 2HKO relatively bulky Pokemon such as Cofagrigus and Hitmontop. Ice Beam accomplishes two roles on this set: eliminating Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Empoleon's STAB and defeating Xatu. Grass Knot rounds this set off by hitting bulky Water-types, such as Blastoise and Swampert, for super effective damage.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Empoleon is able to outspeed everything up to standard Hitmontop while retaining a large amount of offensive presence and bulk. An alternate EV spread of 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe or 108 HP / 252 SpA / 148 Spe can be used, with the former outspeeding minimum Speed base 85s such as Suicune and Gligar and the latter outspeeding minimum Speed Blastoise, but this would greatly detract from Empoleon's bulk, as Choice Scarf Victini now has a chance to OHKO Empoleon after Stealth Rock. Despite Leftovers being the preferred item on this set, a Chople Berry or a Shuca Berry can be useful in certain situations. For example, if Empoleon is up against a Ground- or Fighting-type, such as Nidoqueen or Life Orb Mienshao, the Shuca Berry or Chople Berry will allow Empoleon to take their respective Ground- and Fighting-type attacks and OHKO back with its STAB Hydro Pump. Surf is an option over Hydro Pump on this set due to its perfect accuracy, but it unfortunately lacks enough power to reliably 2HKO Hitmontop. Empoleon can also function as an anti-lead by using Aqua Jet over Grass Knot, a Focus Sash, and maximum Speed, as the combination of Hydro Pump and Aqua Jet is able to defeat leads such as Azelf, Crustle, and Omastar. Finally, Empoleon can use a Life Orb to boost its power, but it unfortunately counteracts its great natural bulk.</p> <p>Defensively, this set struggles against powerful Fighting-, Electric-, and Ground-types, while offensively, it struggles against bulky Water- and Grass-types. Because of this, Zapdos makes an absolutely wonderful partner for this set, as it can switch into the powerful Fighting- and Ground-type moves that Empoleon fears while also defeating a large amount of Water- and Grass-types with Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Flying, respectively. In return, Empoleon covers Zapdos's Ice- and Rock-type weaknesses and can defeat Swampert and Rhyperior, two of Zapdos's greatest counters. Crobat is another great partner for this set, as it can keep Grass- and Fighting-types, such as Virizion and Shaymin, in check with Brave Bird while also bringing Empoleon in safely with U-turn; however Crobat does share an Electric weakness with Empoleon. Roserade resists Empoleon's Electric-type weakness and can use Electric- and Water-types to set up Spikes.</p> "

        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<p>Although this set appears to be outclassed by an Empoleon that uses Petaya Berry and Substitute, it makes up for the lack of power with an extra coverage move and less reliance on Pinch Berries. Agility doubles Empoleon's Speed letting it outspeed all of the unboosted metagame and slower Choice Scarf holders. Hydro Pump is Empoleon's main STAB move and is used over Surf as Empoleon needs the extra power when trying to sweep. As Empoleon forgoes Substitute for an extra coverage move, it is no longer walled by certain types and has perfect neutral coverage on the whole tier. Ice Beam chills the Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Hydro Pump, and also serves as another way to take out Flygon. Grass Knot trips up Water-types such as Suicune and Slowbro while also reliably OHKOing Rhyperior. Agility Life Orb Empoleon is an extremely capable sweeper and can be used over the Substitute Petaya Berry set if you do not want to eliminate only either Grass- or Water-types. It also has the benefit of not requiring Empoleon to be below 25% of its HP to sweep.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Empoleon to outspeed common Choice Scarf users such as Adamant Darmanitan after an Agility, while the Special Attack EVs and Modest nature give Empoleon much needed power. However, a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Flygon and Jolly Choice Scarf Heracross. A Life Orb is necessary on this set because Empoleon cannot boost its Special Attack, and the recoil can also help lower Empoleon into Torrent range, letting it fire off insanely powerful Hydro Pumps. As Empoleon struggles to OHKO bulkier Pokemon, entry hazard support is much appreciated. Roserade and Qwilfish can set up Spikes, while Rhyperior and Gligar can set up Stealth Rock. Pokemon such as Snorlax and Umbreon can easily stop Empoleon from sweeping, so a Pokemon such as Heracross is a good teammate. Not only is Heracross a good offensive partner, it also has decent defensive synergy with Empoleon, being able to take Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Lastly, a Pokemon such as Tangrowth that can take Mach Punch and attacks from faster Choice Scarf holders such as Flygon is a good teammate for Empoleon.</p> "

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite having been dethroned by Moxie Heracross, Roserade deserves its title as the former queen of UU. Its access to great support moves in Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sleep Powder, combined with a huge base 125 Special Attack and usable base 90 Speed make it both a fearsome offensive powerhouse and a useful team supporter. It has a good ability in Natural Cure, which allows it to function as a status absorber. Because of its resistance to Water, the ability to remove a Scald burn with Natural Cure, and access to recovery moves in Giga Drain, Synthesis, and Rest, Roserade beats nearly all the bulky Water-types on its own. Unfortunately, its low HP stat and a pitiful Defense stat means it is threatened by almost any physical attack. Furthermore, it is weak to Fire, a very common offensive type in UU, and its merely decent Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to many faster threats. Despite these drawbacks, Roserade continues to be a very potent threat in UU, and is a monster to any that underestimate its power.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf allows Roserade to gain the jump on many unboosted Pokemon in the tier, such as Raikou, Weavile, and Mienshao. A SubSeed set is viable but done better by Whimsicott, whose Prankster grants it priority on Leech Seed and Substitute, or by Sceptile, who is much faster. Technician can be used with Grass Knot and Hidden Powers of 60 or 59 Base Power. With Hidden Powers of 60 Base Power, one has to reduce HP, Defense, Special Defense, and Speed IVs to 28 or 29, while 59 Base Power Hidden Powers only require reducing the Special Attack IV to 29. However, losing the utility of Natural Cure makes Technician often inferior.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Life Orb Roserade is extremely hard to counter if the person using it is competent, as the combination of Sleep Powder, Leaf Storm, and Sludge Bomb can deal out serious damage to a majority of teams. Crobat is arguably the best check to Roserade, as it can switch in on both of its STAB, outspeed it, and deliver a powerful counter-attack in Brave Bird. Snorlax has the bulk to take on all Roserade sets and demolish them with a powerful STAB Return or Body Slam. Faster attackers that can exploit Roserade's significantly lower Defense stat, such as Choice Scarf Heracross and Weavile, can come in on Spikes or after Roserade has landed a kill, and can heavily damage it or force it out. Fire-type Pokemon, such as Darmanitan, Rotom-H, and Arcanine, can switch in on Leaf Storm or Giga Drain and threaten it with their powerful STAB moves. Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzong, Bisharp, and Registeel resist both of Roserade's STAB attacks and can set up hazards or a Substitute while Roserade is forced to switch out. However, Steel-types must beware Hidden Power Fire from the offensive set, as it will still deal a hefty amount of damage to them. Xatu can use its Magic Bounce ability to switch in on Spikes or Sleep Powder and bounce them back at Roserade, effectively neutering a sweep. However, offensive Roserade's Sludge Bomb 2HKOes even specially bulky Xatu.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<p>As an illustration of just how much raw power this set has, it can potentially 2HKO Snorlax after Stealth Rock damage. STAB Leaf Storm decimates not only the common Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types it hits for super effective damage, but also many Pokemon neutral or even resistant to Grass. Sludge Bomb is a more reliable STAB, which has the benefit of nailing opposing Grass- and Fire-type Pokemon for significant damage. Reasonably bulky Pokemon such as Arcanine and Shaymin might try to switch into Roserade expecting a Grass move, only to be surprised by a 2HKO and OHKO respectively. Sludge Bomb also has a 30% chance of poisoning, which might help cripple walls. Sleep Powder makes this set incredibly difficult to counter, as otherwise reliable counters can be rendered useless if they switch into the move. Roserade can proceed to bombard the slumbering Pokemon with high-powered moves, or switch out and present a setup opportunity for a teammate. Hidden Power Fire prevents Roserade from being walled by Steel-types such as Bronzong and Cobalion while adding onto neutral coverage alongside Roserade's dual STAB. Synthesis is the recovery move of choice for sets using Life Orb as it allows Roserade to stay in battle and keeping attacking. Rest is more useful for sets using Choice Specs, as it needs to switch out after locking itself into a recovery move anyways. Switching out after using Rest allows Roserade to clear the sleep status and brings her back to perfect condition. Extrasensory can be used in the fourth slot to deal significant damage to Fighting-type switch-ins such as Heracross, while dealing more to Crobat and opposing Roserade than Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>The choice of item depends on whether Roserade plays the role of sweeper or wallbreaker. Life Orb is more suited for the general sweeping role as it has the freedom to stay in and change moves, while Choice Specs allow Roserade to perform as a powerful wallbreaker designed to hit and run. What nature you decide to use is up to your stand on the millennia-old debate of speed versus power. Timid allows Roserade to get the jump on anything slower than neutral Porygon-Z, such as Heracross without a Choice Scarf, Nidoking, and Adamant Arcanine. Modest simply makes Roserade more of a monster, and its benefit is simple: deal extra damage. Hidden Power Ice decimates other common switch-ins to Roserade, namely Crobat, Togekiss, and Zapdos. Giga Drain can be used over Leaf Storm to alleviate Life Orb recoil, but is significantly weaker and will prevent Roserade from 2HKOing Pokemon such as Snorlax. Spikes can replace Sleep Powder or Rest to bluff a defensive set, and is useful in case your team struggles with bulky walls. However, Roserade must then use Giga Drain over Leaf Storm, as Leaf Storm is illegal with Spikes. Roserade likes being paired with Pokemon that resist Flying-, Fire-, and Ice-type attacks, such as Suicune, Slowbro, and Rhyperior. Pairing Roserade with Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Qwilfish, or other Pokemon that can supply entry hazards eases Roserade's sweeps, turning many 2HKOs into OHKOs. Wish support from Umbreon or Togekiss is also appreciated by Roserade, as it keeps Roserade alive longer without having to rely on Synthesis or Rest to restore its HP.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Spikes",
        "description": "<p>Rather than attacking prowess, this set focuses on Roserade's above-average Special Defense and ability to lay hazards reliably. Even uninvested, Roserade's Special Attack is fearsome. Giga Drain is a reliable STAB that keeps Roserade's HP in supply alongside Black Sludge, and Sludge Bomb allows Roserade to provide a slight offensive pressure while having a 30% chance to poison opponents, helping to bring walls down. Rest is a last-ditch attempt to patch up Roserade's HP if Giga Drain and Black Sludge aren't getting the job done. Natural Cure also allows Roserade to heal itself of sleep upon switching out, and keeps it healthy. Synthesis can be used over Rest as it doesn't put Roserade to sleep, but it has less PP and won't recover all of Roserade's HP.</p> <p>This set's EVs are designed to maximize Roserade's Special Defense while allowing it to outpace slower Pokemon, such as Modest Empoleon and Qwilfish. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe may be used to take advantage of Roserade's high Speed stat. Aromatherapy can be used to help cure Roserade's teammates, but a cleric role is better left to bulkier Pokemon such as Umbreon and Togekiss who can take advantage of their immunities and better bulk to find opportunities to heal their team. Toxic Spikes can replace Spikes, but holds little merit due to how common other Roserade and Toxic Spikes-immune Pokemon are. Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Fire can leave a mark on Pokemon such as Crobat and Zapdos or Bronzong and Bisharp, respectively. Stun Spore can be used over Sludge Bomb if your team desires paralysis support. Pokemon such as Slowbro and Snorlax that can switch into strong and fast attackers make good teammates for Roserade, as they can give Roserade room to lay Spikes without fear of being OHKOed early on in the match. Pokemon that aren't extremely powerful and dish out a lot of close 2HKOs, such as Sharpedo and Yanmega, really appreciate Spikes support from this Roserade, as this allows them to break through walls and continue their sweeps.</p> "

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Any Pokemon that wields a 60% chance to flinch is bound to be annoying, and Togekiss is no exception. With a meaty base 120 Special Attack, two solid abilities, and a wide offensive movepool, Togekiss is a very able offensive Pokemon, thanks in particular to Nasty Plot, one of the best boosting moves in the game. It's no slouch defensively either, with 85 / 95 / 115 defenses and a decent defensive typing giving it impressive mixed bulk. These factors are complemented by a great defensive movepool, with access to Wish, Roost, and Heal Bell.</p> <p>However, a nasty weakness to the omnipresent Stealth Rock severely hampers its defensive potential. Weaknesses to common Ice- and Electric-type moves don't do it any favors either, especially because Togekiss is slower than most users of these moves. Nevertheless, incredible versatility, a phenomenal movepool, and balanced stats combine to make it one of the most threatening Pokemon in the UU tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to its incredible versatility, Togekiss has a myriad of options not mentioned above. A more offensive Nasty Plot set is usable, with Air Slash, Fire Blast, and Aura Sphere; however, Togekiss is rather slow and suffers from the mediocre Base Power of Air Slash when using a more offensive set because any counter it fails to flinch will likely cripple or KO it thanks to the lack of defensive investment. Additionally, giving up Roost makes Togekiss much more vulnerable to passive damage from Stealth Rock. Togekiss can also make use of Hustle in conjunction with Work Up and Extreme Speed to run a physical set; however, this is outclassed by other physical attackers such as Darmanitan, Heracross, and Mienshao when it is not using Extreme Speed and suffers badly from Hustle's accuracy-lowering drawback. This turns the usual frustration when facing Togekiss on its head by forcing it to miss 20% of the time.</p> <p>Togekiss can also use either a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs effectively. The former seems particularly enticing because it allows Togekiss to flinch a wider range of Pokemon, but Togekiss is too slow to outrun any other notable Choice Scarf users and too weak without a boost to KO much. It does learn Trick, however, which is useful for crippling unsuspecting walls. No matter its Choice item, the lack of Roost will always trouble Togekiss, who will only be able to switch into Stealth Rock four times without the ability to heal itself.</p> <p>Togekiss's defensive sets can also use a move from its wide offensive movepool, such as Psychic, Aura Sphere, Grass Knot, Fire Blast, or Shadow Ball, to hit problematic Pokemon. However, these are all inferior to the listed options if your team does not have particular trouble with the threat you choose to hit. Togekiss can also use Hyper Voice as a second STAB move, but this does not offer any meaningful coverage alongside Air Slash, so it should generally be avoided. Although Thunder Wave is the primary option for spreading paralysis, Body Slam can also be used, sporting a 60% chance to paralyze thanks to Serene Grace and hitting Ground-types immune to Thunder Wave. However, it does pitiful damage even with STAB, and the reliability of Thunder Wave is generally preferred.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Without a doubt, Stealth Rock is Togekiss's most hated foe. It strips the fairy-bird of 25% of its health every time it switches in, quickly wearing it down. Electric-type Pokemon such as Raikou and Zapdos are also excellent answers, easily absorbing Air Slash due to their resistance and hitting Togekiss hard with a STAB Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. As these Pokemon are naturally faster than Togekiss, it cannot flinch them either. However, neither of these will appreciate being paralyzed. Rhyperior is also a very good counter: it is immune to Thunder Wave and takes pitiful damage from even boosted Air Slash while hitting back with super effective STAB Rock-type moves. It must watch out for Aura Sphere and Grass Knot, though. Snorlax is also a pretty good answer, wearing Togekiss down with Body Slam or simply KOing it with Choice Band-boosted Return; however, it can be beaten with repeated flinches.</p> <p>If you don't carry one of these Pokemon, your best bet is simply to hit it hard and fast. Togekiss has three common weaknesses and few resistances to speak of, so Pokemon such as Choice Band Flygon and Life Orb Darmanitan can give it a lot of trouble. Weavile can easily smash Togekiss with a STAB Ice Punch; similarly, Nidoking's Life Orb, Sheer Force-boosted Ice Beam will quickly clip Togekiss's wings. Mienshao, Heracross, and Victini can also plow right through it; really, any faster physical attacker gives Togekiss a lot of trouble. Hard hitters on the special side have more trouble, but can usually still get the job done if they are strong enough.</p> ",

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<p>It might seem strange to advocate a physically defensive set on a Pokemon with special bulk as excellent as Togekiss's, but with two of its three weaknesses usually seen as special attacks, and a STAB Air Slash to maul UU's common Fighting-type Pokemon, it fulfills this role far better than its base stats might suggest. Togekiss's STAB Air Slash has great coverage in UU, and can even break through some resists. Roost allows Togekiss to heal itself of passive damage, particularly Stealth Rock, and gives it the longevity needed to handle a range of weak physical attackers such as Crobat and Hitmontop. Though uninvested, Togekiss still retains great special bulk, and with Heal Bell it has no trouble switching into Scald from bulky Water-types without fearing a burn. However, without investment in its Special Defense, it must be wary of the Ice Beam these Pokemon sometimes carry.</p> <p>Nasty Plot is the most dangerous part of this set. It transforms Togekiss from a mediocre tank into a devastating offensive threat, doubling its Special Attack after a single use. Common special walls such as Snorlax and Umbreon are quickly worn down by repeated Air Slashes, with the chance to flinch often preventing them from healing at a crucial moment. Heal Bell is the primary option in the third moveslot, allowing Togekiss to cure it and its team of status and become an excellent supporter. In particular, burns and Toxic poison quickly wear Togekiss down, so the ability to remove them makes it a much better check to Pokemon such as Toxic Hitmontop. The ability to remove paralysis is useful too, because the speed drop prevents Togekiss from flinching most opponents. Thunder Wave is a strong alternative that trades longevity and team support for instant offense; a paralyzed Pokemon hit by Togekiss's Air Slash only moves 30% of the time. Thunder Wave can still support your team, too, and is particularly appreciated by Pokemon such as Druddigon who excel when nothing can outspeed them. Unfortunately, Thunder Wave is useless against Ground-types, but many of these are reluctant to switch into Togekiss for fear of taking a possibly boosted Air Slash. Only Togekiss's nemesis, Rhyperior, fears neither.</p> <p>The given EV spread gives Togekiss the bulk to switch in and check a plethora of weaker physical attackers while retaining enough speed to beat uninvested base 85 Pokemon such as Gligar and Suicune. It is also quick enough to outrun most Nidoqueen. If you wish to use a faster spread, 96 EVs is a good benchmark, outrunning minimum Speed Roserade, Modest Empoleon, and -1 Victini. However, this is not recommended, because Togekiss will beat Roserade even without outrunning it and will struggle to defeat offensive variants of Empoleon even if it is faster thanks to Empoleon's Steel typing. 248 HP EVs are used to keep Togekiss's HP stat odd instead of even, which minimizes damage from Stealth Rock. Teams looking for Wish support may choose to use Wish and Protect over Roost and Nasty Plot, but this is not recommended because Umbreon is much better at passing Wishes, and the loss of Nasty Plot significantly impedes Togekiss's ability to break through bulkier Pokemon.</p> <p>Togekiss is excellent at forcing switches, so it appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Rhyperior, Qwilfish, and Roserade. Rhyperior is a particularly good partner because it is able to switch into and defeat the Electric-types which threaten Togekiss. Speaking of Electric-types, a solid answer to them is a must, because they will almost always have no trouble defeating Togekiss. Swampert, Snorlax, and Rhyperior are good answers to most Electric-types in the tier. Because of its hatred of Stealth Rock, Togekiss adores Rapid Spin support from the like of Hitmontop and Blastoise. Hitmontop is a particularly good partner because it can switch into and defeat Rock-type Pokemon looking to exploit Togekiss's weakness. With Intimidate, the pair can form a solid walling combination.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set takes a more conventional approach, focusing on Togekiss's fantastic base 115 Special Defense. Once again, Air Slash is a reliable STAB, with its handy 60% flinch chance allowing Togekiss to beat many things it would otherwise struggle with. Roost mitigates damage suffered from Stealth Rock and other passive sources and does a good job of keeping Togekiss healthy despite its common weaknesses. This set appreciates Heal Bell a lot as it may frequently be called on to switch into Scald from bulky Water-type Pokemon; the resulting burns hamper its longevity and the ability to remove them on a whim is very useful. However, Thunder Wave is still a solid choice, allowing Togekiss to paralyze and flinch faster special attackers that it might otherwise struggle with.</p> <p>Nasty Plot makes Togekiss a fearsome tank, doubling its Special Attack in a single turn. It serves as a vital part of Togekiss's flinching strategy by making sure every flinch counts and allows it to power through walls it would otherwise struggle with. For example, without Nasty Plot, Umbreon would effortlessly wall Togekiss, but with it, Togekiss can boost to +6 against Umbreon and nonchalantly 2HKO it with Air Slash.</p> <p>Due to its natural special bulk, Togekiss need not avoid strong attackers as much and is better suited to taking weak super effective moves. A Calm nature is chosen to bolster the Special Defense investment. 44 Speed EVs are used to outrun uninvested base 85s and consequently almost all defensive Pokemon; however, the option to invest 96 EVs and outrun minimum Speed Roserade, Modest Empoleon, and -1 Victini is available. Though, this set takes on Roserade extremely well, so this is not advised.</p> <p>As Togekiss loathes Stealth Rock, it enjoys being partnered with a Rapid Spin user such as Blastoise or Hitmontop. Xatu is another decent partner, reflecting back any hazards used while it is on the field. However, none of these Pokemon have great defensive synergy with this Togekiss variant, so another partner is advised. Swampert is a good choice, being able to tank a variety of physical hits and take on the Electric-types that plague Togekiss. It can also set up Stealth Rock to capitalize on the switches Togekiss forces. Other Electric-type counters or checks such as Snorlax and Rhyperior are also good choices, as Togekiss will lose to every UU Electric-type even with the additional Special Defense.</p> "

  "Scolipede": {
    "overview": "<p>Scolipede is the second fastest user of Spikes in the tier, but it unfortunately gets a lot of competition from Accelgor, which has much higher Speed. Scolipede also has a fairly poor defensive typing, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and Fire-type moves, and its bulk in general is pretty mediocre. From an offensive perspective, it faces a lot of competition from one of the most common Pokemon in the tier, Heracross, which has a lot more power and also has a STAB Megahorn.</p> <p>However, by combining all of these traits, Scolipede has a niche in UU as a fast, offensive user of Spikes, thanks to its high Speed and powerful Megahorn to scare off foes. While its typing is mediocre in many respects, 4x resistances to Fighting and Grass, as well as a resistance to Bug, help it combat many Pokemon in UU, especially considering its Speed allows it to outspeed threats such as Tornadus and Mienshao. Although it isn't common, Scolipede is still a great addition to teams that need its role fulfilled.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An interesting strategy to use with Scolipede is a Swords Dance set with Substitute, Swarm, and a Salac Berry to make its Megahorn nearly impossible to switch into, even with resists, while giving it +1 Speed to make it harder to revenge kill. Aqua Tail rounds out the coverage on this set. While the payoff can be large, finding a turn to set up both a Substitute and Swords Dance is difficult. Scolipede has Baton Pass and can pass Swords Dance or Agility, but with Ninjask available, using a different Bug-type Baton Passer isn't worth the trouble. Unlike Megahorn, X-Scissor won't miss, but Megahorn is so much more powerful than X-Scissor that to pass up on it is almost never a good idea. Scolipede has access to the always cool Pursuit, but with an average Attack and its tendency to attract Ghost-types more than scare them away, it is a mediocre user of the move. Finally, Scolipede has Superpower to hit Snorlax and Ferroseed very hard, but the former is already hit fairly hard by Megahorn and the latter is rare in UU, making it a lackluster option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Not surprisingly, the best way to take down Scolipede is a resistance to Megahorn, and not being weak to Earthquake also helps. Due to this, Crobat is the best counter, as its 4x resistance to Megahorn and immunity to Earthquake allows it to take hits with ease, and it can retaliate with a powerful STAB Brave Bird before Scolipede can use Rock Slide, which doesn't hit it very hard. It even has Taunt to prevent Scolipede from setting up Spikes or Swords Dance. Cofagrigus has a high defense and resists Megahorn and can either wall and burn it or use Trick Room to make Scolipede's Speed a liability. Hitmontop has an easy time with Scolipede thanks to Intimidate and a resistance to Megahorn it can hit it hard with Stone Edge or spin its Spikes away. Unless Scolipede has Aqua Tail along with Swords Dance boosts, Gligar completely walls Scolipede thanks to instant recovery and its insane physical defense; like Crobat, it also has Taunt, a resistance to Megahorn, and an immunity to Earthquake. Rhyperior is capable of OHKOing Scolipede easily, possibly even through a Focus Sash, thanks to Rock Blast, and its massive Defense means that even though it is weak to Earthquake, it will not take much damage from it—be aware that Aqua Tail does hit it for a lot more damage, however. Azelf can switch into an Earthquake, outspeed Scolipede, and OHKO it with Psychic, but it needs to be extremely careful of Megahorn, which easily OHKOes back. Finally, there is a host of Choice Scarf revenge killers, including Darmanitan, Victini, Rotom-H, and Honchkrow, which can OHKO Scolipede with ease. Darminitan and Rotom-H can switch into Megahorn while Honchkrow and Rotom-H can switch into Earthquake, but all of these Pokemon must be careful of the appropriate coverage move.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set uses almost every niche Scolipede has—Spikes, a fairly high Speed, and a good offensive move in Megahorn to pose an offensive threat. UU is not lacking in Spikes users, but its advantage over Accelgor, which is faster, is that Scolipede's Megahorn is stronger than anything that Accelgor can muster, and it also defeats Tornadus one-on-one due to a slight advantage in Speed. In general, Spikes is useful on all kinds of teams, as it helps wear down opponents on defensive teams and turns 2HKOs into OHKOs for offensive Pokemon, and due to its high speed, Scolipede will almost always get two layers of Spikes down.</p> <p>The other moves listed increase Scolipede's offensive presence. Megahorn is a powerful STAB move, and when combined with a Life Orb, it can OHKO almost everything that is weak to it, such as Mew and Shaymin, which can let Scolipede set up a layer of Spikes if these or other Pokemon weak to Megahorn switch out. Earthquake gets good coverage with Megahorn and hits Fire-types that resist Bug, such as Darmanitan and Arcanine, super effectively, and also a few Steel-types, such as Empoleon and Registeel. Rock Slide rounds off Scolipede's coverage, hitting Tornadus and Togekiss hard. However, be warned that it is rarely a good idea to stay in on most Flying-types unless they are weakened, as most can easily OHKO Scolipede while Scolipede only 2HKOes them back.</p> <p>If Scolipede is being used as a dedicated lead, a Focus Sash is a good idea, as it almost guarantees two layers of Spikes unless Scolipede is up against one of the few Pokemon that outspeed it, such as Raikou and Crobat. A Life Orb, however, is usable to increase its offensive presence, letting it get a guaranteed OHKO on Mew and Shaymin with Megahorn and hit other foes generally harder. Scolipede has access to Toxic Spikes, but there are many Pokemon in UU that can either absorb Toxic Spikes or are immune to damage from it, making it usually not worth using. In addition, Toxic Spikes are usually for stall teams, a playstyle that Scolipede is generally not suited for.</p> <p>It is advisable to pair Scolipede up with a spinblocker in order to keep Spikes up. Mismagius makes an excellent partner, as it blocks Rapid Spin and can deal massive damage to most Rapid Spinners with its STABs or coverage moves, including the three most common Rapid Spinners in UU: Blastoise, Hitmontop, and Kabutops. Cofagrigus and Sableye are other options for spinblockers, though they lack as much synergy with Scolipede. Ice-types also deal with Gligar and Crobat, two huge threats to Scolipede due to their instant recovery, typing, and Taunt. Finally, fast setup sweepers in general, such as Raikou, Azelf, and Weavile, appreciate Spikes support in order to gain KOs on bulky Pokemon that may otherwise survive their boosted attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Scolipede may seem like an odd choice, especially considering Heracross is available with more Attack, Guts, Fighting STAB, and mostly similar moves. However, Scolipede has two advantages: the ability to quickly defeat Gligar with Aqua Tail and a higher Speed that allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Mew, Roserade, and Shaymin. After a Swords Dance, it hits 558 Attack, which is enough to finish off weakened teams. Megahorn is the STAB move of choice, flattening anything that doesn't resist it. Earthquake covers most of what Megahorn cannot, wrecking Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-types that could otherwise take a Megahorn. While Aqua Tail may seem a bit redundant with Earthquake, it hits Gligar very hard, which is a Pokemon that Heracross cannot reliably defeat. It also lets Scolipede get past Rhyperior, which is capable of taking even a +2 Earthquake due to its high Defense and OHKOing back. However, Rock Slide is still a decent option, hitting Flying-types such as Tornadus, Zapdos, and Crobat hard, although one should note that catching Crobat on the switch can be difficult.</p> <p>With an average base 90 Attack, a Life Orb is preferred to give Scolipede all the power it can get. If Scolipede gets hit by paralysis or a burn it is more or less useless, so a Lum Berry is a usable alternative, though it should be noted that Scolipede is walled by most Ghosts, which are common carriers of Will-O-Wisp. Speaking of Ghost-types, partners to take them down helps Scolipede sweep teams far more easily. Dark-types such as Houndoom, Krookodile, and Weavile all make good partners, as they are capable of Pursuiting ghosts or hitting them hard with a strong Dark STAB. Note that while many Dark-types dislike Will-O-Wisp, Houndoom's access to Flash Fire means that it benefits from it. UU is also filled with many Fire-types that like to use a Choice Scarf, such as Darmanitan and Victini, making bulky Water-types nice partners. Slowbro takes Fire moves from the three well, can use Regenerator to heal, and appreciates Megahorn's destruction of Dark-type Pokemon.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Whimsicott is indeed special. It has access to the ability Prankster, as well as a plethora of support moves with which to take advantage of, such as Encore, Leech Seed, Substitute, Taunt, and Stun Spore. This makes Whimsicott an excellent support Pokemon, and an annoying one on top of that. With Prankster, Whimsicott doesn't need to invest any EVs in its Speed and can focus its EV investment on its bulk, making it even more of a pain to take down. While Whimsicott's HP stat can let it down sometimes, and it has no offensive presence at all, those factors don't really matter. Whimsicott is a great Pokemon in UU, and, trust me, it will be one of the most fun Pokemon you will ever use.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Whimsicott has several other support moves at its disposal that can be useful in some way. Cotton Spore, Tickle, Fake Tears, Memento, and Charm can help Whimsicott's teammates deal with certain Pokemon or just force switches. Tailwind can be used to boost the Speed stat of Whimsicott's team for four turns, possibly allowing an end-game sweep. Whimsicott can also use Cotton Guard to boost its own Defense stat, making it ridiculously hard to take down. Worry Seed is a gimmicky option, but can really pay off against Pokemon dependent on their abilities, such as Tinted Lens Yanmega or Magic Guard Alakazam. Switcheroo in combination with Lagging Tail or Iron Ball is also an option, but Switcheroo is illegal with Encore and Stun Spore already slows down the opponent, making Switcheroo the less favorable option. Giga Drain is Whimsicott's best form of offense; use a Bold nature if you opt for it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Whimsicott's most crucial moment is when it's at low health. This means it can't protect itself with Substitute if the opposing Pokemon doesn't care about Encore and Taunt. In fact, Whimsicott doesn't even have to be at low health if the opponent doesn't care about Whimsicott's moves, as it can just keep spamming a powerful move until Whimsicott goes down. Heracross falls into this category thanks to STAB Megahorn; worse, Guts variants are powered up by Stun Spore. In general, hard hitting attackers will easily take Whimsicott down, as Leech Seed and Leftovers will otherwise quickly restore Whimsicott's health. Another way of countering Whimsicott is to break its Substitute with a U-turn and then bring in a Pokemon that can OHKO it. Grass-types don't care about Leech Seed, and Roserade and Shaymin laugh off Stun Spore thanks to Natural Cure and can KO Whimsicott with Sludge Bomb and Air Slash, respectively. Faster Whimsicott can outspeed and Taunt, leaving the slower one helpless.</p> ",

Leech Seed in combination with Substitute is a lethal tactic, making Whimsicott hard to take down if you play it right. Taunt is a great move in the last slot, keeping status at bay as well as preventing other Pokemon from setting up. U-turn can help Whimsicott escape tricky situations or enable it to scout, while Stun Spore can paralyze the opponent, opening up a variety of opportunities for Whimsicott's teammates.</p> <p>Whimsicott can also support its teammates with Sunny Day or Trick Room, the former virtually guaranteed thanks to Prankster. Toxic can help to wear down the opponent in combination with Leech Seed, while Grass Whistle can put the opponent to sleep. Grass Whistle's shaky accuracy makes it a risky move to use though. Light Screen and Safeguard can help Whimsicott's teammates that set up by boosting their Special Defense and preventing status.</p> <p>Set-up sweepers such as Mismagius, Kingdra, and Azelf benefit from Encore, Stun Spore, and Taunt: Encore can lock the opponent into a resisted move, Stun Spore lowers the opponent's Speed stat, and Taunt prevents the opponent from using status moves and setting up itself. Alternatively, Heracross is an example of a slow sweeper that greatly benefits from Stun Spore lowering the opponent's Speed. Leech Seed keeps the aforementioned Pokemon healthy while they set up, and also helps in stalling the opponent. Furthermore, teammates that can take care of Grass-types that might stand in Whimsicott's way are appreciated. Arcanine, Heracross, and Moltres comes to mind, as they resist Grass-type moves and hit back hard with their STAB moves. Pokemon that can set up entry hazards, such as Scolipede or Nidoqueen, pairs well with Whimsicott as it forces a lot of switches.</p> "

Its access to Pursuit means it is also a very useful trapper, as it can also force out the aforementioned Pokemon. Even with these qualities, there are a number of factors that hinder Krookodile's usefulness in UU. Its typing, while solid offensively, is mediocre defensively, giving it a number of exploitable weaknesses, especially to Fighting. Its moves also have major drawbacks, with many Pokemon being immune to Earthquake, while Crunch has middling power without any boosts. Krookodile also faces notable competition from Honchkrow and Heracross as a Moxie cleaner, both of which pack more initial power.

Sableye can use its Prankster ability to move before Krookodile and render it useless with Will-O-Wisp. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Darmanitan and Mienshao outspeed and threaten to OHKO Krookodile. Sharpedo has the ability to raise its Speed with Speed Boost, outspeeding Krookodile after a single boost, and threaten back with Waterfall or Surf.

However, due to the number of Ground immunities throughout the tier, becoming locked into Earthquake can hamper a potential sweep and force Krookodile out.

Stone Edge completes the EdgeQuake coverage, hitting the various Flying- and Ice-type Pokemon in the tier hard. The last moveslot is between Pursuit or Superpower.

Faster Choice Scarf users such as Darmanitan pose a threat to Krookodile, as a super effective hit, even without STAB, tends to easily finish Krookodile off.

Exeggutor also has a niche as one of the few viable Pokemon with Harvest, which allows it to stall out entire teams with the right support. Although the severe weakness to Bug-type moves, and consequentially, a weakness to the ubiquitous U-turn, makes Exeggutor difficult to fit into just any team, it can pay off well for those teams that find room for it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Exeggutor can use Rest with a Lum Berry and Harvest to constantly keep itself healthy, but there are many threats that can OHKO Exeggutor, so this strategy is difficult to pull off. Giga Drain is an option on any offensive set, since it can heal off damage. Energy Ball is slightly more powerful than Giga Drain, but the recovery Giga Drain provides almost always outweighs the benefit of a little extra damage. If special walls are not a concern, then Psychic is a better move than Psyshock in most situations. Gravity gives perfect accuracy to Exeggutor's moves, most notably Sleep Powder and Leaf Storm. Stun Spore can be used to paralyze opponents. Exeggutor has access to dual screens, but is generally outclassed in this role by many other Pokemon. Wish can be used to pass off fairly sizable amounts of recovery to teammates, but Exeggutor has a hard time using it for itself. Synthesis provides healing, although it is useless when a weather other than sun is up. Worry Seed suppresses an opponent's ability, but as a result, the opponent becomes immune to Sleep Powder, one of Exeggutor's best moves. A Swords Dance or Curse set with Wood Hammer and Zen Headbutt can be used, but it isn't very effective due to Exeggutor's poor defensive typing and low Special Defense.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Thanks to Sleep Powder, Exeggutor is difficult to counter before Sleep Clause has been activated. However, any Pokemon with a Bug-type move, especially U-turn, poses an immediate threat to Exeggutor. Scyther is one of the most dangerous examples, since it can pound Exeggutor's team with powerful U-turns if Exeggutor doesn't sacrifice itself to take the hit. Escavalier is Exeggutor's worst nightmare if Exeggutor lacks Hidden Power Fire and has already used Sleep Powder, as its Megahorn is powerful enough to OHKO Exeggutor several times over, and it can also trap and KO a fleeing Exeggutor with Pursuit. Choice Scarf Fire-type Pokemon with a Base Speed of 90 or higher pose a serious threat to Sunny Day Exeggutor, since they can throw out boosted Fire-type attacks while outspeeding it. Weavile can put Exeggutor in a bad situation, since predicting incorrectly about whether Weavile will use Ice Shard or Pursuit can be disastrous.

Hidden Power Fire effectively becomes a STAB move in the sun and nails Grass-types hard. Psyshock also works, since many Grass-type Pokemon carry a secondary Poison typing, and it also gives Exeggutor a better chance at beating specially bulky walls. However, this leaves Exeggutor walled by Steel-types, who would normally fall to a super effective Hidden Power Fire. Sleep Powder gives Exeggutor a chance to set up Sunny Day against slower Pokemon, and can also be used on the last turn of sun to give Exeggutor a chance to set it up again and continue sweeping.</p> <p>The choice of item is an important one. Life Orb boosts power significantly, and is best when Exeggutor acts as a stand-alone sweeper. However, if Exeggutor's teammates also benefit from Sunny Day, then Heat Rock is an alternative to ensure that even if Exeggutor fails, its teammates can still pick up where it left off.</p> <p>A Modest nature is preferred, since Exeggutor does not outspeed any notable Choice Scarf Pokemon with a Timid nature. However, if neutral base 100 Speed Pokemon are a concern, Exeggutor can get the jump on them with a Timid nature. The EVs are simple, and are meant to maximize Exeggutor's offensive capability. If Life Orb is being used, a 29 HP IV reduces the recoil from it by 1 point, giving Exeggutor slightly more longevity after two attacks. Leaf Storm is an option over Solar Beam, but this reduces Exeggutor to more of a hit-and-run type of sweeper, which Lilligant does better thanks to its high Speed. Another option is Explosion, which, while weak, can get a stronger Chlorophyll sweeper out onto the field with no risk.</p> <p>Pokemon that benefit from Sunny Day make the best teammates for Exeggutor. Other Chlorophyll Pokemon, such as Victreebel and Lilligant, are obvious choices. Fire-type Pokemon also make for good partners, since they greatly appreciate the extra boost in power that Sunny Day provides to their STAB moves. Choice Scarf Pokemon, in particular, work very well. Examples include Victini and Typhlosion, both of which can throw out extremely powerful V-creates and Eruptions, respectively. Fire-type Pokemon also resist U-turn, a move that Exeggutor greatly fears. Rhyperior can set up Stealth Rock and loves having its Water-type weakness reduced by Sunny Day.</p> "

If Hidden Power Fire is not being used, switch to perfect Speed and Special Attack IVs. Exeggutor can use Wish to heal reliably, becoming even more difficult to take down. However, this comes at the cost of a way to deal with Grass-types. Ingrain foils attempts to phaze Exeggutor out and supplements Exeggutor's recovery, but it similarly forces the sacrifice of Exeggutor's coverage move. Sleep Powder allows Exeggutor to incapacitate an opponent and then set up Leech Seed or Substitute for free. Toxic is also an option to stack up residual damage.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes support is heavily recommended, since it makes Exeggutor less reliant on Leech Seed and conserves the PP of Substitute and Protect. Nidoqueen resists U-turn and benefits from having a teammate to take Water-type attacks aimed at her. Pokemon that can deal with Grass-types in general are appreciated; Fire-types such as Arcanine work well. Paralysis support is beneficial since it allows Exeggutor to move first against paralyzed opponents, and if the opponent becomes fully paralyzed, Exeggutor gains a free turn of recovery and a free turn of damage against the opponent. Sunny Day support is also helpful, as it guarantees that Harvest will recycle Sitrus Berry and also boosts the strength of Hidden Power Fire.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With access to Sleep Powder, Exeggutor is one of the best users of Trick Room available in UU. Exeggutor can come in when a Trick Room set by a teammate is about to expire, use Sleep Powder on the last turn, and then reactivate Trick Room in complete safety. Leaf Storm is Exeggutor's strongest move and goes well with this set, given its hit-and-run nature. Grass Knot does not reduce Exeggutor's Special Attack, but it also does not get KOs as consistently as Leaf Storm. Hidden Power Fire hits most Steel-types for reasonable damage, but the main target, Escavalier, underspeeds Exeggutor, so Exeggutor loses to it while Trick Room is up anyway.</p> <p>A Life Orb boosts Exeggutor's power significantly, allowing it to pose more of a threat while Trick Room is up. A Quiet nature and maximized Special Attack aid Exeggutor in this respect. Since Exeggutor wants to outspeed as many things as possible while Trick Room is up, a 0 Speed IV is ideal. Note that if Exeggutor is using Hidden Power Fire, then a 2 Speed IV must be used instead. 232 HP gives a Life Orb number, and the rest of the EVs are placed in Defense. Although Exeggutor is not abusing the ability to recycle Berries on this set, Harvest is preferred over Chlorophyll so that in the event that the sun is shining, Exeggutor will not outspeed the opponent and move second under Trick Room. Explosion, while weak, is an option to get Exeggutor off the field immediately, allowing a more powerful Trick Room sweeper to get into play unscathed.</p> <p>Teammates that benefit from Trick Room are essential. Victini can also set up Trick Room and hits very hard with V-create, which effectively makes it faster while Trick Room is up. It can also use Final Gambit to remove a problematic opponent. Cofagrigus and Dusclops are both reliable users of Trick Room, and they resist Bug-type moves, a common weakness for most users of Trick Room. Slow, hard-hitting Pokemon, such as Aggron or Escavalier, take advantage of a teammate's Trick Room well.</p> "

Psyshock provides Exeggutor with a nice secondary STAB and helps Exeggutor deal with specially bulky walls. Sleep Powder cripples almost anything that might be able to take one of Exeggutor's attacks, although using it forces Exeggutor out immediately afterward, unless the opponent has Natural Cure for its ability, giving Exeggutor a chance to put something else to sleep if played correctly. Hidden Power Fire deals with Steel-types, which resist both of Exeggutor's STAB moves.</p> <p>A Modest nature is preferred for the power it provides, but Timid is also an option to outspeed the few other Pokemon near Exeggutor's Speed tier, such as Gorebyss and 0 Spe Roserade. The EVs are straightforward, maximizing Exeggutor's offense and allowing it to outpace most walls. Hidden Power Ice can be used to nail Altaria, but since Leaf Storm still OHKOes Flygon on the switch-in, there isn't much point in using it.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is vital to this set's success, since hazards and double switching are Exeggutor's best bet for wearing down those who take little from Choice Specs assaults. A strong Pursuit user also works, as does a Pokemon with Trick. Porygon-Z can ruin foes with Trick, and together with Exeggutor it can bludgeon its way through most specially bulky walls. Pokemon that appreciate having Steel-types weakened love this set. Swellow can spam Brave Bird once Steel-types are removed, and can also sponge U-turns for Exeggutor.</p> "

  "Qwilfish": {
    "overview": "<p>Qwilfish occupies a very specialized niche in the UU metagame: it has the unique capability to check both Fire- and Fighting-type physical attackers that can run through teams with their powerful STAB attacks. True to its thorny exterior, Qwilfish can also lay down Spikes to break down opposing teams, making it one of the best utility Pokemon in the tier. One of the Balloon Pokemon's biggest weaknesses was remedied in BW2, as Intimidate and Pain Split are compatible on a single set, allowing Qwilfish to both cushion the physical attacks it switches into and recover its health fairly reliably. However, with its horrid Special Defense, Qwilfish can be struck down by most neutral or super effective special attacks. Combined with unfortunate weaknesses to Ground-, Electric-, and Psychic-type attacks, Qwilfish is by no means an unbreakable defensive threat. Still, if played to its strengths, Qwilfish makes a great check to many dangerous threats and a superb team supporter.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Qwilfish can use Swords Dance and Swift Swim on a Rain Dance team to become a powerful sweeper, but it faces heavy competition from Kabutops, Kingdra, and Ludicolo as a Swift Swim user. The ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, once Qwilfish's claim to fame for rain teams, is less important in a metagame with many grounded Poison-types, and other Swift Swim Pokemon can outpower Qwilfish without needing to Explode on the sturdiest walls.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Blastoise and Hitmontop are huge annoyances for Qwilfish because they take little damage from Waterfall and can Rapid Spin away the Spikes that Qwilfish put down. Xatu works along the same lines because of Magic Bounce, which will reflect the hazards back onto Qwilfish's side of the field. While they are unable to clear away Spikes, Swampert and Quagsire can capitalize on Qwilfish's weakness to Ground-type attacks and maim Qwilfish with Earthquake.</p> <p>In addition to these options, most special attackers can handle Qwilfish without trouble. Slower Pokemon, such as Porygon2 and Slowbro, do not mind Thunder Wave and can strike back with super effective attacks. Offensively inclined checks take more damage from either Waterfall or Poison Jab, but because few Qwilfish invest in Attack, most Pokemon can weather a few hits and knock out Qwilfish. Pokemon such as Roserade, Shaymin, Zapdos, Raikou, and Azelf fit solidly into this category. Roserade and Shaymin have powerful attacks such as Leaf Storm and Seed Flare to take out Qwilfish and have Natural Cure to guard against Qwilfish's status attempts. The latter three are more susceptible to status, but they have super effective STAB attacks that will almost certainly knock Qwilfish out in a single hit. As long as you minimize Qwilfish's chances to lay down Spikes and are able to overwhelm its weak Special Defense, Qwilfish will not cause you significant headaches.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With Intimidate, its Dream World ability, Qwilfish makes a great check to many physical threats, such as Heracross, Azumarill, and Darmanitan. Once in play, Qwilfish can proceed to set up layers of Spikes to wear down the opponent's team. Pain Split is a welcome addition from BW2, and if used at opportune times will keep Qwilfish at enough health to continue sponging powerful hits. Waterfall is Qwilfish's primary option for offense, allowing it to damage Cobalion while also hitting Fire-types super effectively. Poison Jab is another option to hit physical Kingdra, which Qwilfish struggles against otherwise, while also hitting switch-ins with a chance to poison. Finally, Haze is an effective way to check setup sweepers looking to capitalize on Qwilfish's modest offensive capabilities, such as Bulk Up Scrafty or Calm Mind Suicune. Thunder Wave is another great option to cripple almost anything it hits -- it's especially effective because most Ground-types fear a STAB Waterfall and are therefore reluctant to switch in to absorb Thunder Wave. If Qwilfish does manage to paralyze an opposing threat, it can take advantage of the flinch chance of Waterfall as well as the chance of a full paralysis, which means the opponent will have a reduced chance to hit Qwilfish at all.</p> <p>While significant Speed investment on a defensive Pokemon might seem odd, the 52 Speed EVs do serve a purpose. With the given spread, Qwilfish will outspeed Jolly Victini after it has used V-Create once. This helps Qwilfish because, while Qwilfish can avoid a 2HKO even after Stealth Rock, after prior damage Victini can take out Qwilfish in two hits due to the insane power of V-Create. Qwilfish will also outspeed Jolly Aggron and uninvested base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Roserade. For this reason, Taunt can be used in the last slot to prevent Roserade from setting up its Spikes. If none of these situations particularly concern your team, a simple 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe spread can be used to attain maximum physical bulk. Because Qwilfish invites Rapid Spin users such as Blastoise and Hitmontop to switch in and clear away hazards, Toxic can also work in the fourth slot. Once afflicted by Toxic poison, spinners will be unable to continue clearing hazards over the course of the battle. Qwilfish has access to Toxic Spikes as well as Spikes and can feasibly set them up just as easily; however, grounded Poison-types, such as Roserade and Nidoking, are quite common, so Spikes will almost always be of more use. Black Sludge is an equivalent item to Leftovers, and also will cripple any Trick users that Qwilfish switches into that lack Poison typing. If the opponent wants to use Trick again to rid themselves of Black Sludge, Qwilfish can switch in again to regain its item. However, Qwilfish will rarely switch into popular UU Trick users, and if Qwilfish were to faint before the Trick user another Pokemon could be crippled instead. Leftovers is an alternative if you're feeling edgy about Black Sludge and Trick.</p> <p>With Qwilfish laying Spikes, a spinblocker is a good teammate to keep the hazards on the field. Both Mismagius and Sableye can block Rapid Spin courtesy of their Ghost typing. Mismagius appreciates entry hazard support to aid its powerful special attacks, and Sableye can serve as a backup check to physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. As Qwilfish will fold to most special attacks, pairing it with Umbreon or Snorlax is a good idea. Umbreon in particular makes a good partner because it can use Wish heal Qwilfish if it is unable to get off a Pain Split. Qwilfish also resists both the Bug- and Fighting-type attacks that Umbreon despises.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Although Qwilfish is commonly seen as a defensively oriented threat, it can utilize its decent speed and access to useful utility moves to become a fast Spikes lead. While at first glance this set might seem outclassed by other suicide Spikers such as Scolipede, Accelgor, and Smeargle, Qwilfish stands out with its access to useful utility moves such as Taunt and Destiny Bond. Even without any defensive investment, Qwilfish's resistances to the common Fire- and Fighting-type moves and Intimidate still give it some defensive utility. Spikes is the centerpiece of this set, as Qwilfish aims to set up multiple layers of the move for its team. Taunt gives Qwilfish good utility against defensive teams, as well as preventing setup. Destiny Bond allows Qwilfish to take down an opponent once it has completed its job of laying hazards. Explosion, however, also allows Qwilfish to go out with a bang to deal damage, and allows Qwilfish to pseudo-spinblock against Blastoise or Hitmontop. Finally, Waterfall is Qwilfish's best STAB move, and provides it a way to deal some damage if needed.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Speed to ensure Qwilfish can set up entry hazards as quickly as possible. A Focus Sash is a very useful item to keep Qwilfish alive so it can set up at least one layer of Spikes. Even though Qwilfish is not going defensive with this set, Intimidate is still a useful ability, and can allow Qwilfish to make good use of its resistances to take hits from common threats such as Darmanitan, Heracross, and Mienshao. Toxic Spikes can be used over Destiny Bond or Explosion if poisoning opponents should prove useful; but with the ubiquity of threats such as Roserade and Nidoqueen, the entry hazard is hard to utilize. An alternate EV spread with maximum Attack can be used in conjunction with Explosion to deal heavy damage. Poison Jab can be used over Waterfall if you want to hit Shaymin and occasionally poison Blastoise and Slowbro; beyond that, however, Poison is a poor offensive type and is generally not worth it. Since Qwilfish lays Spikes and is generally powerless against most spinners, a spinblocker is always appreciated. Cofagrigus and Golurk are both great picks for spinblockers, and can also take advantage of the Spikes that Qwilfish sets up to deal with opponents more easily. In addition, late-game sweepers such as Heracross, Raikou, Krookodile, and Yanmega can all benefit from the Spikes support Qwilfish provides, as this can allow them to KO opposing targets more easily and continue their sweeps.</p> "

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>If you think Raikou is now considered less of a threat due to dropping from BL to UU this generation, you couldn't be more wrong. Its wide offensive movepool with coverage options such as Aura Sphere, Extrasensory, and Hidden Power, as well as access to Calm Mind all contribute to give Raikou a huge recognition in the tier as a powerful and versatile sweeper, having the ability to sweep through entire teams if you are not properly prepared to face it. Moreover, as a consequence of being considered as a legendary Pokemon, its defensive stats of 90 / 75 / 100 are not bad either, and that will result in a much easier time sweeping or taking a somewhat weak neutral attack.</p> <p>It's not all roses and candies for Raikou though. Special walls such as Snorlax can ruin its sweep, and fast Ground-types such as Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Krookodile can absorb an Electric-type move and OHKO with Earthquake. Using the event moves, namely Aura Sphere, forces Raikou to run a Rash nature, therefore reducing its speed to 329, outpacing only up to base 100 Speed Pokemon by the minimum margin. Even though Raikou has its flaws, it should never be underestimated, as with the proper support, it can shred teams apart easily.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Raikou's movepool might not be gigantic, but it still provides some additional moves to consider. Shadow Ball might seem like a good coverage option to hit Psychic- and Ghost-types, but most are hit hard enough by Thunderbolt anyway. Charge Beam can be used on the Choice set to give Raikou a way of boosting its stats, but it takes two boosts for it to hit harder than unboosted Thunderbolt, and even then, special walls such as Snorlax stop Raikou comfortably. Extreme Speed can pick off frail or weakened opponents, but it won't be doing much otherwise with Raikou's poor Attack stat and also forces Raikou to sacrifice a nature that boosts Speed, one of its biggest assets. Raikou can also help a teammate set up by running Reflect and Light Screen. A RestTalk set with Calm Mind and Thunderbolt can also be used to help Raikou have an easier time setting up due to its overall good bulk, but it is completely walled by Ground-types and is a bit unreliable. Its movepool even includes Rain Dance and Sunny Day; Raikou can thus set up weather easily with its high Speed, although Uxie outclasses it with its superior bulk. It should be noted, however, that Raikou can exploit either weather very well thanks to its access to a perfectly accurate Thunder in the rain as well as Weather Ball. Finally, Thunder Wave combined with Raikou's high Speed allow it to spread paralysis, but this job is generally better left to bulkier teammates.</p> <p>An especially notable option is Roar, which Raikou can use alongside Calm Mind to accomplish a couple different things. The first of which is winning Calm Mind wars by setting up a few times then using Roar, which leaves your opponent in a tough spot, having to deal with a boosted Raikou with an unboosted Pokemon. The second is the weakening of its counters, all of which happen to be vulnerable to Spikes, which Raikou is commonly paired with.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Despite Raikou's power, there are several reliable checks and counters to it. Sets lacking Hidden Power Grass are walled cold by Swampert: it is immune to Thunderbolt and sponges even boosted coverage attacks with ease, while OHKOing with Earthquake. Snorlax is able to take boosted Aura Spheres easily with its excellent Special Defense and can OHKO or 2HKO with Earthquake or Return, respectively. Specially Defensive Rhyperior is also able to defeat Raikou with Earthquake, especially if it lacks Hidden Power Grass, although it can also take one if it is unboosted. Fast Ground-types such as Choice Scarf Flygon and Choice Scarf Krookodile make great checks to Raikou too, as they can switch into Thunderbolt and OHKO with Earthquake, although they will still get wrecked by Hidden Power Ice. Powerful Choice Scarf users like Heracross can also easily revenge kill Raikou with a super effective Earthquake after Stealth Rock or one layer of Spikes. Bronzong can also take some of Raikou's hits and retaliate with Earthquake. Raikou is also vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards: Stealth Rock and multiple layers of Spikes severely limit its ability to switch in, while Toxic Spikes can cut short its sweep.</p> ",

With Substitute, Raikou is provided with a pseudo immunity to status conditions that make it much less useful and can set up Calm Mind multiple times with ease on weak attackers such as Ferroseed, eventually amassing a gigantic Special Attack stat. Once it has set up, Raikou can go to town with its access to a powerful STAB Thunderbolt and great secondary coverage option in Hidden Power Ice, a combination resisted by only Rotom-H, Magneton, and Lanturn.</p> <p>The EV spread listed makes sure Raikou reaches its maximum Speed, while hitting hard before getting any Special Attack boosts. Raikou can also use Air Balloon to obtain more Calm Mind boosts on Ground-types, but the loss of recovery will cut short its sweep. A bulkier EV spread of 64 HP / 224 SpA / 216 Spe is also an option; with this, Raikou may keep its Substitute intact after a Calm Mind boost in the face of support Roserade's strongest move, Sludge Bomb, although it is guaranteed to be outsped by Azelf, Ambipom, Cinccino, and opposing Raikou that run max Speed. Aura Sphere might seem like a good alternative to Hidden Power Ice to hit Snorlax hard, but it forces Raikou to run a Rash nature, meaning that it loses the ability to outspeed Pokemon with over base 100 Speed and to set up on special attackers such as Zapdos and Roserade due to the drop of the Special Defense stat. Powerful Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Heracross, and Hitmontop make great offensive partners, as they can KO Snorlax with ease. Packing a Grass-type teammate, such as Roserade, Tangrowth or Shaymin, is also advisable as Swampert is a hard counter to this set. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, are very useful in aiding Raikou when it comes to eliminating its counters. Crustle, Qwilfish, and Roserade can all set up entry hazards, but the latter fits this role like a glove because Roserade not only sets up the said Spikes, but also forces out the likes of Swampert and Rhyperior, two of Raikou's main counters, meaning they will take additional hazard damage and thus will be weaker when they switch in on Raikou.</p> "

With its blistering Speed and above average Special Attack stat, Raikou is sure to pack a punch and stick around on your team for a while. Thunderbolt is a very strong and reliable STAB move that hits extremely hard with the Life Orb boost and it's the move you will probably be using the most. Hidden Power Ice gives Raikou the famous pseudo BoltBeam combo and annihilates Flygon and Gligar, whereas Hidden Power Grass OHKOes Swampert and Rhyperior, both being top checks to the thunder tiger when it is not packing a Grass-type move. Extrasensory is there specifically for Roserade, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen, while dealing a lot of damage to the roaming Fighting-types in the tier. As for the last slot, Raikou has two very valuable options and the choice depends on the way you want to use it. Calm Mind provides Raikou an easier time sweeping by not only raising its Special Attack, but also raising its Special Defense, which allows it to set up on special attackers with ease and sweep. Volt Switch, on the other hand, helps Raikou to get away from a difficult situation, netting some good damage while scouting and gaining offensive momentum.</p> <p>The EV spread is a simple one: Special Attack and Speed are maximized to ensure optimum offensive ability. Life Orb is the preferred item for the offensive boost it brings to the table. Aura Sphere is an option over Extrasensory to hit Snorlax hard, preferably paired with Calm Mind, but it forces Raikou to run a Rash nature, allowing threats such as Cobalion and Azelf to outspeed and KO it. Tangrowth makes sure that Scarf Flygon and Scarf Krookodile don't wreck Raikou in one shot by taking their hits and retaliating with its STAB move or Hidden Power Ice. Raikou absolutely needs Snorlax out of the picture before it can start setting up; Fighting-types such as Heracross, Mienshao, and Hitmontop are thus great offensive partners. Entry hazard support from the likes of Qwilfish and Roserade helps immensely too, softening up potential counters and turning several 2HKOs into OHKOs. Raikou also appreciates having entry hazards off its side of the field, as the residual damage in conjunction with Life Orb recoil shortens its sweep; Hitmontop in particular is a fantastic choice for providing Rapid Spin support, as it also has Fighting-type STAB to finish off Snorlax.</p> "

Thunderbolt is a menace to everything that does not resist it or is immune to it and is Raikou's strongest move. Although it is not its strongest move, Volt Switch is an amazing choice as a secondary STAB move as it not only allows Raikou to get out of a sticky situation but it also deals a powerful blow to the opponent in the process. To prevent Raikou from being walled by Ground-type Pokemon, Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Grass are required, the former dealing with potential Flygon switch-ins and Gligar whereas the latter deals with Swampert and Rhyperior easily. As for the last slot, Extrasensory is Raikou's best way to deal with Roserade, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen, all of which are able to take any other of Raikou's moves and put it to sleep with Sleep Powder or retaliate with Earth Power, respectively.</p> <p>The EV spread listed provides Raikou as much power and Speed as possible in order to punch holes through the opponent's team. Aura Sphere is a good alternative to use on the set to deal with Snorlax better; however, in this scenario, Rash must be used over Timid as a nature. As Ground-types, such as Flygon, Krookodile, and Rhyperior, are immune to Electric-type attacks, they are common switch-ins to Raikou. For this reason, having a Grass-type on your team, such as Shaymin, Roserade, or Tangrowth is going to allow Raikou to perform its job a lot more easily. Due to its sheer power, Raikou will be causing a lot of switches and at the same time gaining momentum and switch initiative with Volt Switch. As such, entry hazards support is advisable, and Qwilfish and Roserade are good partners. To prevent Raikou from getting damaged by entry hazards due to switching in and out constantly, Rapid Spin support should be used. Both Hitmontop and Blastoise are good team members: the former deals with Snorlax and takes physical hits well due to Intimidate, while the latter is a better choice overall as a spinner and can take care of Ground-types easily.</p> "

Volt Switch allows Raikou to make a quick getaway when needed while dealing a very respectable amount of damage in the process. Hidden Power Ice makes Raikou an extremely good Choice Scarf Flygon and Gligar revenge killer, as Raikou outspeeds them and OHKOes Flygon whilst taking out Gligar in one shot after Stealth Rock. Raikou can run either a Rash nature when paired with Aura Sphere to hit Snorlax, Weavile, and Krookodile or a Timid nature when paired with Extrasensory to hit Roserade, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen, although the former is preferable. However, take into account that Raikou outpaces Pokemon with base 100 Speed with a Rash nature whereas it ties with Pokemon with base 115 Speed when running Timid nature while also having the ability to outspeed Modest Kingdra in the rain.</p> <p>The EV spread given lets Raikou outpace as many Pokemon as possible while dealing as much damage as it possibly can. It should be used mainly as a late-game cleaner, as it does not have the raw power of the Choice Specs set, but it's also good to rack up some damage mid-game with Volt Switch. It absolutely loves having entry hazards on the opponent's field to ensure a few more kills and to help its partners wearing your opponent's team down with switch initiative and constant damage. Roserade and Qwilfish are perfect for this job. Once again, Raikou will most likely be switching in and out often, so Rapid Spin support is advisable.

Eruption can be used in tandem with a Choice Scarf; just make sure Entei hasn't taken prior damage, as Eruption's power will be reduced. Finally, Entei can utilize a mono-attacking set with Rest, Sleep Talk, Lava Plume, and Calm Mind, which turns it into a great status absorber and boosting tank.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>For the most part, Water-types can take on any set that doesn't have Solar Beam or a boosted Hidden Power Grass. Suicune can set up Calm Mind boosts while Resting off the damage, Milotic can hit Entei with STAB Surf and restore its HP with Recover, and Azumarill can break through Entei with Huge Power-boosted Waterfall and Aqua Jet. Other examples include Blastoise, Kingdra, Slowbro, and Empoleon; all of these can ruin Entei's reign and turn it into a washout with their STAB moves. Cresselia is a good all-around wall, and Thunder Wave can really screw Entei's strategy, not to mention Calm Mind Cresselia can set up alongside boosting Entei. Rhydon and Rhyperior can take on sets that lack Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Grass, and their STAB moves will KO Entei with little trouble. Golurk has enough bulk to survive a Flare Blitz, and can hit Entei with STAB Earthquake--just watch out for Hidden Power Ice or Grass. Arcanine and Victini can beat the special sets with ease, and they must only watch out for Stone Edge on the physical ones. Umbreon and Snorlax are bulky enough to take on most sets; Umbreon can trap Entei with Mean Look, while Snorlax can use Curse to boost its Attack and Defense. Finally, Entei is weak to Stealth Rock, and a combination of residual damage and constant switching will wear it down slowly.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>What makes Entei such an amazing physical sweeper is its high Attack stat, immunity to Will-O-Wisp, and respectable bulk. Flare Blitz is Entei's most powerful move; a 120 Base Power STAB move coming off a base Attack of 115 is going to hurt anything that doesn't resist it. Extreme Speed gives Entei a priority move to pick off weakened Pokemon, and it gives Entei something to smack around faster Pokemon with. Stone Edge is the main reason to use Entei over Arcanine, as it allows Entei to hit Fire- and Flying-types, namely Moltres and opposing Arcanine, super effectively. Finally, Hidden Power Grass can KO Quagsire and Omastar, Toxic can cripple the bulkier walls which Entei can't break, and Flame Charge can be used to raise Entei's Speed to outrun most of the unboosted tier.</p> <p>The item choice is down to personal preference: Choice Band provides Entei with more power, while Life Orb allows it to switch between moves. The downside to using a Life Orb is that Entei already takes recoil damage from Flare Blitz, and the added Life Orb recoil means it won't survive for very long. Sleep Talk and Will-O-Wisp are two support options to use in the last slot, turning Entei into a sleep absorber, or giving it something to cripple physical attackers with, respectively. Iron Head and Bulldoze give Entei a move to hit Rock-types with, but those moves generally have poor coverage. Return is another physical option, though it's mainly a filler that provides neutral coverage. Due to Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed being event moves, Entei is forced to use an Adamant nature, which holds it back in the Speed department. To cover for this, a more defensive spread can be used to take hits, or a Choice Scarf can be used to outrun more threats.</p> <p>As Flare Blitz and Life Orb will be causing so much recoil, support from Rapid Spin is needed to remove Stealth Rock. Hitmontop is a great choice, as it can use Foresight to hit Ghost-types and switch into Rock-type moves aimed at Entei. Blastoise is another good partner as it can switch into Water-type moves and has access to Scald, which has the chance to burn physical attackers, such as Golurk. Entei also appreciates entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field, which weaken Pokemon that switch in and attempt to wall it.</p> <p>Pokemon that can switch into Entei's weaknesses, especially those that maintain offensive pressure, are helpful. For example, Empoleon can switch into Rock- and Water-type moves aimed at Entei and put pressure onto the opponent; unfortunately, it shares a Ground-type weakness with Entei. Flygon is another example of an offensive Pokemon that can switch into Rock- and Water-type moves, and it can also utilize U-turn to force switches.</p> "

What makes this set so great is Entei's ability to create 101 HP Substitutes, which means it can set up against the likes of Clefable. Furthermore, it also has the Speed to outrun most other walls. Calm Mind is not too shabby on a Pokemon with base 90 Special Attack, and combined with a powerful Fire-type STAB, Entei is quite the force to be reckoned with. Flamethrower provides Entei with a powerful STAB move, and Hidden Power Grass is used to hit Water- and Rock-types super effectively.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are fairly simple: 136 HP EVs ensure Entei can set up 101 HP Substitutes, and maximum Speed is used to tie with base 100 Speed Pokemon. The remaining EVs are placed in Special Attack, giving Entei some firepower. A more offensive set can be used without Substitute, and this allows Entei to invest more in its attacking stats. Stone Edge is viable with a Naive nature, and it provides excellent coverage with Entei's Fire-type STAB. Hidden Power Rock is another decent choice to hit opposing Fire-types, though Entei is forced to use a Speed IV of 30. Lava Plume can be used over Flamethrower for its higher burn rate, but Flamethrower's higher power is appreciated on an offensive set like this.</p> <p>Due to Entei's typing, it needs support in the form of Rapid Spin. Sandslash is a great choice as it can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin, set up Stealth Rock, and switch into Rock-type moves which Entei is weak to. Hitmonlee is another decent choice as it can break through Snorlax and Rock-types, and its powerful STAB moves force a lot of switches. Support from entry hazards is also helpful, especially Toxic Spikes, which help wear down Snorlax and bulky Water-types. Roserade can set up Toxic Spikes, sponge Water-type moves, and incapacitate an opponent with Sleep Powder. Claydol can set up Stealth Rock, switch into Rock-type moves, and utilize Rapid Spin to support its team.</p> <p>Without Hidden Power Rock or Stone Edge, Entei has trouble with Altaria and defensive Zapdos, so a teammate that can take them out is recommended. Aggron can set up Rock Polish and KO them with Head Smash, while Weavile can outspeed them and maim them with Ice Punch. Defensive walls, such as Snorlax and Cresselia, are troublesome too, so a way to break through them is helpful. A strong Fighting-type, such as Hitmonlee, can KO Snorlax, while Dark- and Bug-types, such as Krookodile, Scyther, Drapion, and Honchkrow, can take out Cresselia. Grass-types are also decent partners, as they can take out Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types; Lilligant and Roserade are fine choices.</p> "

Calm Mind is used to raise Entei's Special Attack and Special Defense, and turns it into an offensive powerhouse in the sun. The choice between Flamethrower or Fire Blast is down to personal preference; Flamethrower has more PP and higher accuracy, but Fire Blast provides extra power. Solar Beam helps provide coverage against Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types, and it doesn't need a turn to charge when the sun is active.</p> <p>A Life Orb provides Entei with more power right off the bat, while Heat Rock can be used to prolong the sun. Hidden Power Ice or Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit Altaria and Zapdos; however, Hidden Power Rock lowers Entei's Speed IV to 30, which means it'll lose out on the Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon. Lava Plume can be used in the third slot for a higher burn rate, though the loss in power is noticeable in the long run.</p> <p>Teammates that can set up entry hazards are appreciated. Roserade can set up Toxic Spikes and KO Entei's counters, Claydol can set up Stealth Rock and utilize Rapid Spin, and Qwilfish can set up Spikes and cripple an opponent with Thunder Wave.

Hitmontop and Claydol are decent choices, and they both have powerful STAB moves to dent the opponent with.</p> <p>Pokemon that can take advantage of the sun are decent partners. Exeggutor can abuse Chlorophyll and power through the opponent's team, while other Fire-types, such as Darmanitan, can blast through the opponent's team with sun-boosted STAB moves.

Suicune and Azumarill are great choices, and they have enough bulk to switch into powerful attacks as well. Ground-types are also decent choices thanks to their STAB Earthquake; Rhyperior also has a massively powerful STAB Stone Edge.</p> <p>Due to this set's special-attacking nature, Pokemon such as Snorlax can be troublesome. Powerful Fighting-types, such as Hitmonlee, are good choices to remove them. Grass-types, such as Shaymin and Tangrowth, can defeat the Ground-, Rock-, and Water-types that stand in Entei's way.

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Having been considered one of the best sweepers in existence two generations in a row is no small feat, and although Suicune has now fallen into UU, it can still hold its own in this environment. Its pure Water typing is amazing, as it gives it few weaknesses and a very wide range of neutral coverage with its STAB moves. Its stats are just right for it to do virtually anything it wants, from sweeping to being one of the sturdiest walls in the game. Since it possesses such an array of support moves, such as Calm Mind and Roar, it's also a great team player. However, it's not all peaches for Suicune, as many of its greatest enemies happen to be some of the most used Pokemon in the tier, including Roserade, Raikou, and Zapdos, which makes it difficult for Suicune to truly shine. Fret not, as despite these hinderances, Suicune is sure to leave its mark in any battle it takes part in.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Suicune's movepool is quite barren, but there are a few moves which have not been covered above and could be worth consideration if your team is in need of such support; namely Reflect, Toxic, and Protect. A classic Substitute + Calm Mind set with a STAB move and either Ice Beam or Hidden Power Electric for coverage can also work, but since Suicune relies so much on its HP to take hits, this could prove counterproductive. In a similar vein, a Calm Mind + Roar set can be used to set up alongside opposing stat-boosters and Roar them away once you have accumulated a few boosts yourself. Suicune may also employ Choice Scarf and Choice Specs fairly effectively, but these sets are largely outclassed by other Pokemon with higher Speed, better coverage, or more power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Suicune is difficult to beat 1-on-1 due to its awesome bulk and respectable offensive stats, but it can be done. Roserade and Shaymin are the best counters, as they are bulky enough to take Ice Beams, have Natural Cure to shrug off burns from Scald, and can hit back really hard with their STAB moves. Rotom-C also does well and commonly has Trick to cripple defensive sets, but it cares more about a Scald burn. Snorlax can check the offensive set pretty well, but it does not like getting burned at all. Zapdos and Raikou also dislike getting burned, but don't mind it as much due to being special attackers, and can hit Suicune hard with Thunderbolt. Milotic can effectively shut down most sets with Haze + Recover and cripple Suicune with Toxic. Kingdra switches in with little trouble and proceeds to set up or fire off Draco Meteors. Although, if it's a physical attacker, it will need to be a Lum or Chesto Berry variant. Hitting Suicune hard with Pokemon such as Choice Band Escavalier before it can set up too any Calm Minds usually works well too.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>While Suicune's stats almost scream out \"wall\", the most effective role it can play is that of a bulky sweeper. Its tremendous natural bulk not only allows Suicune to set up rather easily, but also take a couple of hits as it dishes out its own, which usually leads to it KOing a couple Pokemon before going down itself. The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf is the classic \"power vs. accuracy\" conundrum, as while Surf has perfect accuracy and more PP, the power drop is quite noticeable, especially against bulkier foes such as Porygon2. Calm Mind is Suicune's only way of powering up, boosting both its Special Attack and Special Defense simultaneously, making it a double-edged threat. Ice Beam gives it coverage on the Grass-types which resist its STAB moves, such as Shaymin and Roserade, while Hidden Power Electric covers opposing Water-types, such as Empoleon and Milotic.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Suicune's offensive potential and prevent Porygon2 and Porygon-Z from receiving a beneficial boost from Download as they come in. A Timid nature is preferred to ensure Suicune always outruns enemy Togekiss, as well as Speed ties with Heracross and Nidoking. Keep in mind, however, that the former two rarely run a Speed-boosting nature and the latter two have a 50% chance to outrun it anyway, so a Modest nature is more than viable. Leftovers is the primary item pick here because it has excellent synergy with Suicune's natural bulk and prevents it from becoming worn down by residual damage too quickly. The power boost that Life Orb provides is very substantial, however, and hence should be considered if your team has a way of nullifying sources of residual damage. An alternative EV spread that focuses on bulk rather than Speed of 208 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 44 Spe, which allows Suicune to outrun 0 Speed Roserade, is also viable, but at times you will find yourself missing the Speed, especially against bulky offensive teams that employ Pokemon such as Choice Band Heracross.</p> <p>This set absolutely hates Toxic Spikes and loves Spikes support, making Spikes Roserade a good partner, due to its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes upon entry and being able to lay down its own hazards. In order to avoid having Suicune take too many strong hits before it gets the chance to set up, it would be wise to pair it with a secondary Water-type; preferably one that can weaken opposing Water-type counters to ease Suicune's sweep. This makes Choice Specs Kingdra a great offensive partner, as it can soften Suicune's counters and come in on strong attacks that Suicune typically wants to avoid early game, such as Darmanitan's Flare Blitz. Offensive Slowbro performs similarly, but its weakness to U-turn makes it a bit less appealing, despite having access to Regenerator.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Ever since its inception during the ADV era, Calm Mind + RestTalk Suicune has remained one of the most popular sets in the entire game. However, the main reason why this set is less viable than it has been in the past is the change in Sleep mechanics that happened during the generational transition. This change, which forces it to stay in for three turns straight if it ever wants to wake up from its nap, has essentially taken most of Suicune's utility away, as it can no longer be used as an effective defensive pivot in the early-to-mid stages of the game. However, CroCune, as this set is affectionately known as, is still one of the more difficult late-game sweepers to deal with, as its tremendous bulk and ability to steadily boost its stats through Calm Mind, make it nigh-impossible to 3HKO. Scald is the primary STAB move for this set due to its handy 30% burn rate, making it even harder to break Suicune.</p> <p>Heal Bell or Aromatherapy support gives this set back most of its early-to-mid-game defensive utility, as it can now use Rest and switch out more freely. Toxic Spikes also greatly improve the effectiveness of this set, as they prevent opposing Calm Mind users, such as Raikou, from setting up alongside it. Roserade proves to be a very effective teammate in this regard, as it has access to both Toxic Spikes and Aromatherapy, as well as fantastic defensive synergy with Suicune. If you decide to provide said Toxic Spikes support, a Pokemon who can take out opposing grounded Poison-types and ensure the entry hazards aren't absorbed may also be a worthwhile investment. Weavile all but guarantees the removal of opposing Roserade with its strong Pursuit and can threaten Nidoking and Nidoqueen with Ice Punch. In addition, if you decide to go this route, you may want to consider using Surf over Scald for the added power and to avoid status interference.</p> "

        "description": "<p>As Suicune is one of the bulkiest Pokemon in existence, it's no surprise that despite the change in sleep mechanics that BW brought with it, it is still able to pull off a classic RestTalk set. Rest is Suicune's only method of recovering HP outside of Leftovers and passed on Wishes. The main drawback here is that in order to use Rest effectively, Suicune needs to be either able to stay in for three turns straight, allowing it to wake up and Rest again, or take little-to-no damage before switching out. Otherwise, damage will build up too quickly and Suicune will faint before accomplishing anything. Luckily, Suicune has all the right tools to make this set work: tremendous bulk, Scald, and access to Roar. Scald is a very good move on defensive Water-types such as this one, as it gives them a STAB move with nice, consistent damage that also has a very nice side effect which helps spread status around the opponent's team. Roar prevents Suicune from being set up on and allows it to take advantage of entry hazards placed by its teammates. Sleep Talk ties the set together by nearly ensuring Suicune doesn't become a sitting duck for the two turns it is asleep.</p> <p>Due to the very specific role this set plays on a team, it is recommended you stick to the given moves. However, if you find that there is too much status interference on your team, feel free to use Surf over Scald. In order to work properly, this set absolutely requires Spikes support, and due to its amazing defensive synergy with Suicune, Roserade stands out as the best choice to lay them down. Heal Bell / Aromatherapy support is very much appreciated so that Suicune doesn't get stuck being asleep if it's forced out at low HP. Roserade can provide this as well, but since it suffers from a bad case of four-moveslot syndrome, you may want to consider Togekiss, who also beats Shaymin and Roserade, two of Suicune's worst enemies. You'll also need something that can beat Raikou and Zapdos, so special walls such as Snorlax and Umbreon make good partners.</p> "

Along with Guts comes a 140 Base Power STAB move in Facade, allowing Swellow to easily destroy unprepared teams.

Moves such as Roost, Substitute, Rain Dance, and Sunny Day can be used on Swellow, but are all put to much better use on bulkier Pokemon such as Zapdos. Tailwind is a usable field effect, although Swellow is fast enough as it is. A Choice Band or Choice Scarf set is somewhat viable using Scrappy, but without Guts, Brave Bird would be the primary STAB attack, defeating the purpose of Scrappy. Work Up is usable on Swellow, used against a predicted switch to give Swellow a +1 Guts-boosted STAB Facade, which will murder everything that does not resist it, but Swellow will hardly ever find time to set up a Work Up. Furthermore, a +1 boost will be meaningless if the opponent switches to one of Swellow's very solid counters.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although Swellow hits incredibly hard, it has no real way to get past Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon. Rhyperior and Aggron get special mentions as the biggest Swellow counters in the game, taking pitiful damage from everything Swellow can dish out, and can effortlessly OHKO Swellow with their STAB Rock-type attacks, or leisurely set up using Substitute, Rock Polish, or Swords Dance. Outside Rhyperior and Aggron, Rotom is immune to Facade, resists Brave Bird, and can handle any and all of Swellow's attacks when using a bulky EV spread.

The final two moves are questionable. U-turn is incredible for scouting the opponent's switches and switching to the correct counter. Pursuit, however, is useful for trapping and killing frail Ghost-types, such as Mismagius, without taking recoil from Brave Bird.

Hitmontop makes a great teammate, being able to Rapid Spin away the Stealth Rock that plagues Swellow, while also being able to easily remove Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon. A bulky Water-type such as Suicune can deal with attacks from Rhyperior and take it down with STAB Water Attacks. They can also help check foes such as Cobalion and Escavalier.

    "overview": "<p>Volbeat is one of many mediocre Pokemon blessed with a fantastic hidden ability. With Prankster granting it priority on all non-attacking moves, including a buff to its near-signature move, Tail Glow, Volbeat finally has a chance to function competitively by passing colossal Special Attack boosts to Pokemon that can actually use them. On the downside, it still has a very poor stat distribution and lacks the tools to prevent phazing attempts on its own, which makes a successful setup rather difficult to pull off against a well-prepared team. All things considered, Volbeat's performance is directly akin to the strength and fortitude of its teammates--don't let your guard down for a second, or you may find yourself on the losing end of a sweep.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There isn't much else Volbeat can do. Thunderbolt helps it get past the many Water-type phazers of the tier, such as Milotic, Suicune, and Blastoise, and Trick can be useful in hindering walls or sweepers that trouble the team. Confuse Ray requires a lot of luck, but it helps to delay phazers and Pokemon that may threaten the Baton Pass recipient. Other than that, the options provided are the best and only ways to realize Volbeat's full potential.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There is no offensive way to prevent a Volbeat from passing its boosts without a faster priority attack or an Extreme Speed user waiting in the wings, but it is easy to phaze it out if Volbeat does not have Xatu as its partner. Roar and Whirlwhind users are abundant, the most common among those being Suicune, Zapdos, and Snorlax, none of which Volbeat can damage significantly before being forced out. Haze users such as Milotic and faster Pokemon with Prankster, such as Murkrow and Whimsicott, will also keep it at bay. Entry hazards shorten Volbeat's life span and limit the number of times it can switch in and set up. Another sigh of relief comes from the fact that regardless of how dangerous its teammates are, Volbeat can't pass Speed boosts. Because of this, revenge killing with Choice Scarf users and strong priority attacks from the likes of Arcanine, Bisharp, Azumarill, and Hitmontop are always great options to take down either Volbeat or the Baton Pass receiver.</p> ",

Little else is required of it--its mammoth +3 Special Attack boosts do all of the talking. Tail Glow turns anything that receives the boosts into an offensive monster, causing the equivalent of a Nasty Plot boost with an additional Calm Mind boost, all in one turn! This set is great at changing the flow of the battle. Volbeat can easily shift the momentum into an offensive team's favor, and can help its teammates force their way through counters. For instance, while Shaymin and Roserade are normally great switch-ins to Suicune, a +3 Ice Beam will send them packing in a hurry. In situations where Volbeat lacks a free turn to set up successfully, Thunder Wave gives it another avenue for team support, crippling faster offensive threats, while Encore can be used to keep set-up sweepers and Substitute users at bay. Bug Buzz is Volbeat's only viable attacking option, and can deal a decent chunk of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it when it's backed by a Tail Glow. Substitute can be used in place of Bug Buzz to prevent Dragon Tail from phazing it out, thus making Baton Passing easier, but it comes at the cost of making Volbeat a sitting duck for phazers that use Roar or Whirlwind.</p> <p>In this case especially, a Baton Passer is only as good as it recipients. While a +3 Special Attack boost is nothing to trifle with, there are many Pokemon in the tier waiting for a chance to squash the little bug, or even harm the recipient. When facing a Victini or Darmanitan, for example, it would be wise to have a teammate that can not only take their vicious Fire-type assaults, but utilize the boosts relayed. Though unorthodox, a specially oriented Flygon equipped with Choice Scarf can easily beat both of the aforementioned threats, while its powerful Draco Meteors take advantage of the fact that Steel-types seldom roam this tier. An offensive Suicune can also take a hit from offensive Fire-types, as well as the likes of Rhyperior and Aggron, forcing them out with its STAB Water-type attacks and severely damaging potential switch-ins. Porygon2 works similarly as a bulky offensive recipient, trading in Suicune's key resistances for superior overall bulk. Xatu is another excellent choice for Volbeat to Baton Pass to, as while the defensive synergy of the duo is lacking, Xatu can bounce back most attempts to phaze or set hazards and toss around powerful boosted attacks.</p> "

Rain Dance and Sunny Day being used first under most conditions means that even if the firefly is unlikely to make it to the next turn, it will be a huge asset to its team by ensuring the desired field condition is up and running before it goes down. U-turn allows Volbeat to safely scout switch-ins for its teammates and get out when needed, as the last thing a rain sweeper needs is to take a hit on the switch-in after being weakened by an attack from the opponent, such as Stone Edge from Rhyperior. Thunder Wave is a great supporting move overall, and should be used on any variant of Volbeat thanks to its crippling Speed drop and the ability to make any moderately fast offensive Pokemon shiver. Encore is a rather poor option on this set, as there aren't very many moves Volbeat would want to Encore with its poor durability and lack of Leftovers recovery, but it's one of the few options the little bug possesses and can at least screw over boosting sweepers in a pinch.</p> <p>This variant of Volbeat plays a vital role on weather teams, and with its use of U-turn, entry hazards will take their toll.

Claydol is especially recommended as a teammate if Volbeat is used on a sun team, as it is immune to Spikes. Support from entry hazards, such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes, can also help sway any potential weather war in your favor.</p> "

  "Crustle": {
    "overview": "<p>Pokemon that have access to multiple entry hazards and can reliably set them up are hard to find once you leave the boundaries of OU. Meet Crustle, one of two Pokemon that can lay both Spikes and Stealth Rock reliably, the other being Omastar, thanks to its ability, Sturdy. Crustle is very beneficial to offensive teams due to the hard pressure it applies to the opponent, further compelling him or her to switch out often and take additional entry hazard damage in the process. Behind Crustle lies solid Attack and Defensce stats, a pair of decent offensive STABs, and Shell Smash. However, the rest of Crustle's stats are paltry, preventing it from sweeping with Shell Smash, and outside of Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic, it has a poor supporting movepool. Despite this, Crustle is a reliable hazard setter that should always be considered when building offensively natured teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off is a viable choice in the fourth moveslot, as it strips the opponent of its item, potentially allowing a teammate to either outspeed or break through said opponent. Rock Blast can be used over Stone Edge, as its ability to hit the target multiple times allows Crustle to bypass Focus Sash users such as Yanmega and Venomoth. Shell Smash might seem like a good idea, as many opponents will expect Crustle to run the Custap lead set, but due to its poor Speed, Crustle is still outsped by many common Choice Scarf users after a boost, preventing any major damage to the opposing team. Crustle also has access to Curse, which unlike Shell Smash, is not hindered by its low Speed stat. However, Crustle is also plagued by a rather disappointing Special Defense stat and a killer weakness to Water-type attacks, preventing such a set from being of any major use.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Taunt users, such as Sableye, Tornadus, Crobat, Azelf, and Mew, are all capable of preventing Crustle from laying hazards. However, the last four need to be wary of Stone Edge and X-Scissor, as one of the two can do severe damage to each of them. Sableye, however, also has the added bonus of access to Will-O-Wisp, making it a complete stop to opposing Crustle. Qwilfish also falls into this category, as it doesn't fear a Stone Edge thanks to Intimidate and can proceed to set hazards on Crustle's side of the field. Blastoise and Hitmontop, thanks to their typing and bulk, are able to spin away any hazards laid by Crustle and not have to worry about paying dearly for it, with Toxic being the worst of their worries. Any Water-type Pokemon has an immediate advantage over Crustle, exploiting one of its three weaknesses. Pokemon that commonly run Scald, such as Swampert, Suicune, Slowbro, and Empoleon, can all beat Crustle one-on-one, as they can target its weaker Special Defense. The added chance for a burn also hurts Crustle dearly, as this potentially prevents it from getting a second layer of hazards up. Offensive Steel-types, especially Cobalion and Empoleon, can also use Crustle as setup bait, as they resist its STAB attacks and do not fear Toxic. As a last resort, once Sturdy has been activated, all priority users, including Azumarill, Arcanine, and Honchkrow, are able to pick Crustle off.</p> ",

Stealth Rock is Crustle's main go-to hazard, breaking Focus Sashes and making ally sweeps easier. Spikes performs a similar role, and thanks to Sturdy and the Custap Berry, Crustle is guaranteed at least a layer alongside Stealth Rock. Stone Edge, despite shaky accuracy, functions as Crustle's main STAB attack, OHKOing Crobat, Xatu, Zapdos, and other opposing Pokemon that happen to have a weakness to Rock-type attacks. X-Scissor provides a secondary STAB and is exceptionally useful against Azelf and other Psychic-type leads trying to prevent Crustle from laying hazards via Taunt or Magic Bounce. However, Toxic can be used over X-Scissor to provide further team support, helping break down opposing tanks and walls.</p> <p>Although it might seem counterproductive to run a lead set with its defenses brought to their lowest level, the strategy behind Crustle encourages it. When using a Lonely nature alongside the provided EV and IV investments, Crustle's attacking prowess is maximized while keeping its defenses as low as possible in hopes of activating Sturdy and its Custap Berry. Counter can be used in the fourth slot over both X-Scissor and Toxic, as it pairs exceptionally well with Sturdy and allows Crustle to knock out an opponent before getting an additional layer of hazards up. Because Crustle is a suicide lead, a spinblocker is a must, with Cofagrigus and Sableye being the most reliable. Pokemon that appreciate having multiple entry hazards to break down threats, such as Darmanitan, Sharpedo, and Mienshao, make for excellent teammates, as their own offensive presence and power will force switches and break down opposing walls, allowing for themselves or a teammate to begin a sweep.</p> "

  "Cryogonal": {
    "overview": "<p>Cryogonal is one of the few Rapid Spin users in the Underused metagame with reliable recovery. It has a very good Special Defense stat, and its ability Levitate helps make it the second best spinner in the metagame, surpassed only by Claydol. While Claydol is bulkier overall, Cryogonal has a superior offensive presence and access to reliable recovery. Cryogonal's job is mainly to hit hard, as it plays the role of a specially defensive pivot that can utilize Rapid Spin. Furthermore, its extremely high Speed allows it to function as a fast specially defensive Rapid Spin user, similar to Tentacruel in OU. Finally, Cryogonal also sports Haze, which can neutralize Baton Pass users and setup sweepers. Unfortunately, Cryogonal has a bad defensive typing, which inflicts it with multiple weaknesses yet only grants it one resistance, and its extremely poor base 30 Defense means that most unresisted physical attacks can 2HKO it. Cryogonal is also very weak to one of the entry hazards that it's supposed to remove from the field, Stealth Rock. Fortunately, Recover can help mitigate Stealth Rock damage, and Cryogonal's extremely high Special Defense means that it can actually take up to three Choice Scarf Nidoking Fire Blasts, a formidable feat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dual screens with Light Clay is possible thanks to Cryogonal's great Speed; furthermore, with its high Special Defense, it finds many opportunities to set up on special attackers and walls. Frost Breath is a situational move that bypasses the defensive stat boosts of opponents such as Raikou; however, Haze is usually the better choice in such cases. Acid Armor is an interesting move that can patch up Cryogonal's weak Defense and turn it into an unbreakable wall. Cryogonal can be used as a Rain Dance supporter, as it can Rapid Spin for rain teams and the rain mitigates its Fire-type weakness.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Cryogonal is weak to Stealth Rock, so if you can prevent it from spinning this entry hazard away, it can be worn down fairly quickly. In addition, Cryogonal can be chased out by common Choice Scarfed physical attackers such as Mienshao, Heracross, and Flygon. However, they are unable to switch in directly due to Cryogonal's surprisingly powerful offensive presence. Fighting-types are decent checks, but they should be wary of Ice Beam from the offensive set. Steel- and Fire-types in general pose problems for Cryogonal. However, they can be worn down by the offensive set's Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p>Snorlax is an extremely good counter to Cryogonal, as it has Thick Fat to nullify Ice Beam and hits hard physically. However, it is unable to prevent Cryogonal from spinning. Cobalion and Bronzong are also excellent counters, as they can set up Stealth Rock, can KO easily with their STABs, and resist Ice Beam; Cobalion is even able to outspeed and kill the offensive set. However, although Bronzong is unaffected by Hidden Power Ground, both of them might not be able to switch in safely on the offensive set's Hidden Power Fire. They also have no way of stopping Cryogonal from taking its usual best course of action and switching into an appropriate teammate so that it can spin away Stealth Rock at a later point in the game.</p> ",

With a Special Defense stat higher than that of Umbreon, Cryogonal can double as a special wall, and Recover helps it excel at that role by providing reliable recovery. Ice Beam is able to wear down opposing Pokemon and, thanks to Cryogonal's high Special Attack, is even able to OHKO or 2HKO multiple threats. These include the common Stealth Rock setter Gligar, the common Spikes setter Roserade, and the special tank Zapdos. Haze allows Cryogonal to put a stop to setup sweepers such as Togekiss and Raikou and also nullifies Baton Pass teams. Toxic is a plausible option to wear down Pokemon that can wall or set up on Cryogonal, such as Porygon2 and Snorlax. Reflect is extremely useful when dealing with physical attackers; using it on a predicted switch to a physical attacker, for example Arcanine or Heracross, can be very helpful throughout the course of a match.</p> <p>248 HP EVs give Cryogonal an HP stat that is indivisible by four, allowing it to take less damage from Stealth Rock when it switches in. You can give Cryogonal 168 Defense EVs, as this allows it to survive moderately powered physical attacks, such as a Flygon's Outrage, and OHKO back with Ice Beam. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to absorb hits from the Pokemon Cryogonal is supposed to wall.</p> <p>The removal of opposing Steel- and Fire-types is useful for Cryogonal so that it can spin more freely, and several good potential teammates such as Slowbro and Swampert, which also form a solid defensive core with Cryogonal with their high Defense, can do just that. Slowbro, Cofagrigus, and Crobat are great teammates to handle Fighting-types that switch in on Cryogonal, and they can also benefit from the removal of entry hazards from the field. Partners that can take down hazard users are useful as well so that Cryogonal can spin just once and not have to worry about entry hazards for the rest of the game. Swampert and Shaymin are recommended for their efficacy in eliminating common Stealth Rock users such as Rhyperior and Empoleon. Finally, Pokemon that really love Spikes off the field, specifically bulky grounded Pokemon such as Snorlax, Rhyperior and Umbreon, appreciate Cryogonal as a teammate. Rhyperior loves the removal of Spikes, as this allows it to check Electric-types better, and it also has the advantage of resisting the Fire-type attacks that Cryogonal hates.</p> "

With the release of Black and White, Weezing has returned to its original role as the best Fighting-type counter in UU. Weezing's Poison typing, along with its ability, Levitate, gives it a lone weakness to Psychic-type attacks, an immunity to Ground-type moves, and, more importantly, a useful Fighting-type resistance. This, coupled with Weezing's excellent Defense and access to useful moves such as Haze, Pain Split, and Will-O-Wisp, makes it the ideal addition to any team plagued by Fighting-type threats such as Hitmontop.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Explosion can put a dent in special walls that Weezing can do little to, but it won't be hitting very hard as Explosion no longer halves Defense. Weezing also has the movepool to run a special attacking set, but it doesn't hit nearly hard enough to be anything more than a surprise gimmick. Weezing can run Taunt to prevent things from setting up on it, but it won't work as well as other Taunt users due to a lack of reliable recovery, and Weezing already has Haze to eliminate stat boosts anyway. Weezing also gets Rest and Sleep Talk; however, with the sleep counter resetting upon every switch out, this tactic is not as effective as it has been in previous generations.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Psychic-type special attackers such as Mew are Weezing's prime checks, as they will destroy it with their STAB attacks. Weezing also despises faster special attackers with access to Substitute, such as Mismagius, as it has no way of damaging them. Strong special attacks in general are sufficient to break through Weezing's low Special Defense. Pokemon that don't fear burns or can get rid of the status, such as Roserade, can just switch in and set up entry hazards, though Roserade must be wary of Flamethrower. While Weezing has Haze to deter stat boosters, it can't do anything to prevent hazards or other supporting moves from being used if it doesn't opt for Taunt. Fire-types such as Victini, Arcanine, and Houndoom can easily beat Weezing, as they are immune to burns and aren't hit for super effective damage by any of Weezing's attacks; Houndoom even receives a Flash Fire boost when it switches in on Will-O-Wisp or Flamethrower.</p> ",

However, either can be replaced by Haze, which allows Weezing to stop most set-up sweepers in their tracks, even those that pack Substitute.

  "Flygon": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragon-types have always been a rare sight within the lower tiers, their excellence leaving the majority of them in the upper tiers. Dragon typing is strong offensively, as only one type resists it: Steel. Not to mention it has resistances to four common offensive types in Fire-, Water-, Grass-, and Electric-types attacks. Flygon holds a coveted spot of being one of the few viable Dragon-types in UU; it has just enough Speed to outpace common threats in UU, and enough Attack to make use of its high Base Power STAB moves. Thanks to Levitate and Ground typing, Flygon is immune to Toxic Spikes and Spikes, and resists Stealth Rock, making it a great hit-and-run attacker. Despite all of Flygon's fantastic attributes, it has a few drawbacks. Unlike its fellow UU Dragon-type Kingdra, it has no way of boosting its stats outside the mediocre Hone Claws. Defensively, Flygon's typing has a few faults to go with its strengths. While Ground typing gives Flygon a handy immunity to Electric-type attacks and resistance to Rock-type attacks, it also gives Flygon a painful 4x Ice-type weakness and rids it of Grass- and Water-type resistances. 80 / 80 / 80 defenses are mediocre at best, so while Flygon might not be frail, any powerful move can cripple or KO it. Nonetheless, Flygon is an excellent Pokemon and has certainly earned its place as a top threat of UU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flygon can attempt a mixed Life Orb set, as Draco Meteor, even with base 80 Special Attack, will KO Slowbro after an Earthquake, and do extremely heavy damage to Gligar, both prominent Flygon checks. However, with the right prediction, Choice Band Outrage can defeat everything the mixed set can, with the exception of Gligar. Moreover, the Choice Band set is generally more useful due to its lack of recoil and consistent damage. Crunch can get past Ghost-types with Levitate, but is weaker than STAB Outrage. Toxic, Roost, and Dragon Tail can be used in stalling or support sets, but Flygon's defenses are too low for this to be viable. Tailwind can help support teammates, but it peters out too quickly to be effective. Hone Claws can be used as a boosting move, but a +1 boost doesn't cut it with Flygon's average Attack stat. Thunder Punch can hit Water-types super effectively, but only deals as much damage as a neutral STAB Earthquake.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bronzong is the standard Flygon counter. Being resistant to one STAB and immune to the other, it can take on almost every Flygon. Choice Band Flygon can't even guarantee a 2HKO on Bronzong with Fire Punch, but the damage will stack up quickly if Bronzong continues to switch into that attack. Bronzong can also 2HKO Flygon with Gyro Ball with just minimal Attack investment. Bulky Water-types are effective checks to most Flygon. Flygon's only super effective move, Thunder Punch, deals less than its STAB Outrage, and most bulky Water-types can handle Flygon's Outrage and Earthquake off of its average Attack stat. They can then respond with Scald, which not only does decent damage, but also threatens a debilitating burn, or with a 4x super effective Ice Beam. However, the Choice Band-boosted Outrage will 2HKO Milotic and Blastoise without fail, and can 2HKO Suicune and Slowbro with some prior damage. Slowbro makes the best check among bulky Water-types due to Slack Off and Regenerator—should Flygon use U-turn on a predicted switch to Slowbro—healing racked up damage that would otherwise allow Flygon to get past it eventually. Regenerator is also useful in allowing Slowbro to switch into Earthquake or Outrage, then switching out immediately to an appropriate teammate. However, Choice Band U-turn—possibly in tandem with entry hazard damage— negates Regenerator's healing effect, and Slowbro too, can be worn down. Weavile is Flygon's best revenge killer, being able to OHKO it with Ice Shard should it be locked into Outrage, or Pursuit trap a Flygon fleeing Ice Shard. Gligar is not 2HKOed by any of physical Flygon's moves. It can recover off the damage using Roost, and stall Flygon out by using Toxic. Any Pokemon with reasonable bulk, such as Dusclops, can serve as a check to Flygon. However, it must be careful not to take too much residual damage, or it will risk being 2HKOed by Choice Band Flygon.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With a Choice Band equipped, Flygon becomes an excellent wallbreaker, as its great STAB coverage makes it notoriously hard for Pokemon to switch into it. Outrage is Flygon's most powerful move, denting walls and plowing through frailer Pokemon. Earthquake is almost as powerful as Outrage, and it comes with the benefit of hitting almost everything that resists Outrage for super effective damage. Earthquake can break holes in opposing teams almost as well as Outrage, and without locking Flygon in for 2-3 turns and the subsequent confusion—a notable benefit of which is switching out of would be revenge killers, such as Weavile. U-turn helps maintain momentum, allowing Flygon to scout potential switch-ins and switch out of unfavorable match-ups, provided the opposing Pokemon is slower. Fire Punch hits Bronzong, the only UU Pokemon to resist both of Flygon's STABs, for super effective damage. All but the most physically defensive of Bronzong are 2HKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Fire Punch. After Bronzong is removed, Flygon can safely use its powerful STABs without getting easily walled.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are very straightforward. Attack and Speed are maximized, ensuring Flygon hits as hard as it can, and outspeeds as much as it can. The Special Defense prevents Download Pokemon from getting their preferred Special Attack boost. As with many sets, this set faces the eternal question of power or speed when dealing with natures. Flygon's base 100 Speed is above that of many Pokemon in the tier, and requires a Jolly nature to be fully effective. However, the power offered by an Adamant nature should always be considered. Adamant secures a 2HKO against offensive Porygon2 without Stealth Rock damage, a 2HKO against defensive Slowbro—although Regenerator makes this less significant—and Suicune with Stealth Rock damage, and gives Flygon a good chance to OHKO Choice Band Snorlax.</p> <p>Although VoltTurn in UU isn't as common as in OU, Volt Switch users still pair up well with Flygon. Zapdos and Raikou make fantastic teammates, as both of them can make quick work of Slowbro with their STAB Electric-type moves; however, Raikou is usually the better choice, as Zapdos shares an Ice weakness with Flygon. Flygon's success is often largely dependent on being supported with entry hazards; Spikes and Stealth Rock put targets into Flygon's KO range, and increases the chance of a late-game sweep. Roserade makes a great partner, as it can set up Spikes, destroy bulky Water-types that try to check Flygon, and remove crippling status with Aromatherapy. Magneton is also an exceptional teammate for Flygon, removing Steel-types for Flygon to spam Outrage, rather than having the need to predict and remove them with Earthquake. Magneton can also remove Bronzong, Flygon's best check, if it is using Magnet Rise. If Magneton is used, Fire Punch loses all purpose. Hence, Stone Edge becomes a decent alternative as it hits Flying-types without locking Flygon into Outrage. Kingdra is a potent partner for a double Dragon strategy. Due to the lack of Dragon counters in UU, the damage dealt by both Dragon-types can often take down the only Steel-type on the opposing team, allowing one of them to sweep.</p> "

With great Speed and decent attacking power, Flygon can utilize a Choice Scarf to outspeed a large portion of the tier while still dealing decent damage. This allows Flygon to not only revenge kill frail sweepers, but to sweep weakened teams itself. Earthquake and Outrage make use of Flygon's great STABs, hitting most of the tier for at least neutral damage. However, it is generally inadvisable to lock Flygon into Outrage early on, as not only are Pokemon that can survive the move and retaliate likely to be around, but Ice Shard users, such as Weavile, can revenge kill it. Access to U-turn is what allows Flygon to be one of the best Choice Scarf users in the tier; being able to switch while doing damage is an asset that should never be underestimated. Fire Punch is Flygon's best option for dealing damage to Bronzong, but it cannot even 2HKO the bulky bell. Stone Edge is a decent option as it allows Flygon to hit Flying-types without resorting to Outrage.</p> <p>The EVs on this set maximize Attack and Speed while preventing Download from giving a Special Attack boost. The use of a Jolly or Adamant nature depends on your team. Adamant allows Flygon to get a power boost, but misses out on getting the jump on numerous Pokemon. Flygon is in a sensitive Speed tier, and any positive-natured Pokemon in base 87 Speed and above at +1 will fail to be outsped. Some notable examples of Pokemon that Adamant Choice Scarf Flygon does not outspeed are Choice Scarf Darmanitan, Choice Scarf Krookodile, +1 Quiver Dance Venomoth, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Furthermore, Adamant does not gain any notable OHKOes or 2HKOes that Jolly misses.</p> <p>Entry hazards are even more important to this set, as they make Flygon's job of cleaning up teams much easier. Roserade makes a great partner as it has Spikes and Aromatherapy. Moreover, Roserade's ability to counter bulky Water-types is even more valuable, as they can take Choice Scarf Flygon's attacks significantly easier than the Choice Band version. Kingdra, particularly one with Choice Specs, makes a good partner for this set. Kingdra can lure typical switch-ins for Flygon, such as Slowbro, and eliminate them with an extremely powerful Draco Meteor, opening Flygon's path so it can sweep.</p> "

With Spikes down on the opposing field, this set can be very hard for the opponent to handle without Gligar or Slowbro. Dragon Claw is the preferred Dragon move, as Outrage locks Flygon in, defeating the purpose of not using a Choice item; however, Outrage is 50% more powerful than Dragon Claw, and can still be used if the added power is really needed. Roost heals off the Life Orb recoil Flygon is sure to take over the course of the match, and thanks to Flygon being practically impervious to entry hazards, it need not use it every time it switches in. Superpower can be used over Fire Punch to allow Flygon to get past Porygon2 and Snorlax more easily, though the Attack and Defense drops will impede Flygon's ability to stay in battle. However, this is not a huge problem as Flygon's resistance to entry hazards makes switching in and out of battle relatively painless. If you are not using Outrage, Earthquake is Flygon's strongest STAB move—and even if you are, its most reliable—and almost perfectly complements Dragon Claw's coverage by hitting all Steel-types, except Bronzong, for at least neutral, and often super effective, damage.</p> <p>The EVs on this set maximize Attack and Speed while preventing a Special Attack boost from Download. Jolly is the preferred nature due to Flygon missing out on outspeeding or tying with a significant number of Pokemon otherwise. Adamant provides a little extra power, but it doesn't ensure any notable OHKOes or 2HKOes.</p> <p>Bulky Arcanine is a great partner, as it can switch into Ice-types such as Weavile that force Flygon out of battle. Darmanitan also helps Flygon by checking fast Ice-types, but trades the ability to switch into them as easily for posing a considerably greater offensive threat. Shaymin and Flygon work very well together, as Shaymin can take out Gligar and bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro, which give Flygon trouble. Their Life Orb sets complement each other well, both having reliable recovery and moderate bulk.</p> "

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Gallade is truly an awesome Pokemon, both in appearance and in its competitive value. The STAB Fighting-type attacks Close Combat and Drain Punch provide it with excellent coverage and allow it to effectively annihilate a huge number of Pokemon. One of Gallade's best traits is its ability to utterly destroy most of the tiers special walls, clearing an easier way for the rest of your team to sweep. Gallade also boasts an expansive movepool, which includes Swords Dance and Bulk Up for setup, and coverage moves such as Ice Punch, Shadow Sneak, Night Slash, and Stone Edge. To top it off, Gallade receives the Justified ability from the Dream World, allowing it to gain an Attack boost by switching into a Dark-type attack.</p> <p>Although Gallade is ridiculously strong after setting up, its Defense is paper-thin, meaning that it can be easily revenge killed, especially after a stat drop from Close Combat. Gallade is also relatively slow; it spends so much time showing off its sleek blades, that it is easily outsped by Pokemon such as Flygon, Crobat, and Rotom-A, which can easily revenge kill it. Still, Gallade is a huge threat to watch out for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As previously mentioned, Gallade's tremendously wide movepool gives it many options to choose from. Leaf Blade lets Gallade pick off bulky Ground- and Water-types, but has poor coverage alongside its Fighting-type STAB. With access to all three elemental punches, Gallade can opt for a physical BoltBeam combination, but its other coverage moves provide stronger and better coverage. Earthquake hits Nidoking and Nidoqueen super effectively, but so do STAB Psycho Cut and Ice Punch. Gallade has nifty support options such as Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, Disable, Encore, and Hypnosis; alternatively, it can attempt to run a SubDisable or SubPunch set. With so many interesting options to choose from, there are many ways you can surprise your opponent and nab a few KOs. However, keep in mind that the standard sets are generally better, as they can deal with a wider array of threats. Lastly, Gallade can utilize Trick Room with some success as it isn't too fast to begin with.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Though Gallade has outstanding Special Defense, it is extremely frail physically. Furthermore, Gallade isn't very fast to begin with, so faster Pokemon can take advantage of Gallade's low Speed and miserable Defense to revenge kill it. Flygon, Heracross, and Aerodactyl all come to mind, but thanks to Gallade's excellent coverage, they have to be wary when switching in. Physical walls often have no trouble stopping Gallade; for instance. Rhyperior, Eviolite Gligar, and other bulky Ground-types can handle Gallade with ease. However, Rhyperior must watch out as +2 Close Combat OHKOes them, while Gligar's 4x weakness to Ice-type attacks may prove fatal. Bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types that can take a Night Slash are also excellent checks to Gallade; Slowbro and Dusclops are great examples of these. Physical attackers who outspeed Gallade are great checks to it, as a reasonably strong physical attack will easily send Gallade home pronto. So long as Gallade hasn't had a Bulk Up under its belt, this is the way to go. Status will also cripple Gallade and strip it off any chance to sweep.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Reaching an Attack stat of 766 after a Swords Dance, Gallade's huge attacking power enables it to wreak havoc upon the UU tier. After a Swords Dance boost, its extremely powerful STAB Close Combat tears apart many teams. Ice Punch lets Gallade smash Flying-types into the ground while fast, frail Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Azelf and Mismagius are taken care of by Shadow Sneak.</p> <p>Each of the moves listed above has a purpose: Stone Edge can be used over Ice Punch to do more damage to Moltres, and also hits Arcanine super effectively. However, all things considered, Ice Punch is the more reliable move. Night Slash can be used over Shadow Sneak to deal greater damage to bulky Psychic-types, such as Slowbro, which otherwise completely wall Gallade.</p> <p>Gallade's excellent movepool includes moves for almost any situation, and for any Pokemon. Zen Headbutt helps it beat Weezing, the bane of most Fighting-types, while it also offers a great flinch chance and may be of use in a clutch situation. Drain Punch allows Gallade to heal off any residual damage taken, and unlike Close Combat, doesn't saddle Gallade with defense drops. Other move options it can utilize include Leaf Blade, Psycho Cut, Fire Punch, and Headbutt, but the ones listed will usually suffice, unless your team desperately needs to surprise and eliminate specific threats.</p> <p>The EVs listed are optimal, but they can be changed to meet your needs. The only reason one would choose to run max Speed is to tie with Adamant Heracross (basically Choice Band variants), but most tend to use a Choice Scarf. This is nonetheless a viable option, as the HP EVs do not provide Gallade with much significant bulk. Maximizing Speed and giving Gallade a Jolly nature also comes with the benefit of Speed tying with max Speed base 80 Pokemon and the rare Altaria. Gallade's other ability, Steadfast, might come in handy against Pokemon who use flinching moves, such as Durant, but this gimmick loses its luster when one realizes Gallade doesn't survive Togekiss's Air Slash. Finally, Gallade can choose to run Leftovers over Life Orb for added recovery, but this isn't recommended considering Gallade's bulk—or lack thereof—and the offensive nature of this set.</p> <p>Physical walls are the bane of this set, and almost every other Gallade set, too. Pokemon such as Milotic pose almost complete hard stops to Gallade. Their attacking moves hit Gallade hard through its paper-thin defenses, and Gallade can't do much in return even after a Swords Dance boost.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gallade can act as a speedy revenge killer or a late game sweeper, while Choice Band Gallade can dent almost anything it faces with STAB Close Combat. Frailer Pokemon attempting to come in on a resisted Close Combat, such as Roserade, will be promptly 2HKOed, demonstrating just how powerful Gallade is with a Choice Band. Trick allows Gallade to severely cripple an opposing wall, such as Slowbro, Dusclops, and Gligar. This grants Gallade a much easier time against the crippled wall, and also gives it the ability to switch moves. Ice Punch allows it to hit Flying-types expecting a resisted Close Combat; Zen Headbutt, on the other hand, is another strong STAB move with a neat flinch chance.</p> <p>Night Slash allows Gallade to destroy Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Mew, Dusclops, and Mismagius, who may attempt to switch into a Close Combat and either set up or try to burn Gallade with Will-O-Wisp. Furthermore, the combination of Night Slash and Close Combat have excellent neutral coverage resisted by only a few Pokemon such as Heracross. Stone Edge is a good alternative to Ice Punch, but sacrifices reliability for power. A Jolly nature can be used to let Gallade outspeed Adamant Heracross and Modest Nidoking. As Choice Scarf Gallade often lacks the power to destroy dedicated walls such as Slowbro, wallbreakers such as Nidoking are good teammates. Another strong physical attacker, such as Guts Heracross, is a good partner to Gallade. As they share common counters, they can work in tandem to weaken the opponent's physical walls, allowing one of them to easily sweep the devastated team. Bug- and Dark-type teammates can smash Psychic- and Ghost-types attempting to wall Gallade, while Grass-, Water-, and Ice-types can make short work of bulky Ground-types, such as Swampert, that trouble Choice Scarf Gallade.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>Gallade already has a high base 115 Special Defense, which makes it difficult to take down with neutral special attacks. However, a reasonably strong physical attack can easily break through Gallade's pathetic base 65 Defense. Bulk Up boosts Gallade's low Defense to a level comparable to its Special Defense, and also powers up its already good Attack to astronomical heights. Drain Punch provides Gallade with a fairly reliable method of recovery, and more importantly, functions as a fantastic STAB move that does great amounts of damage after a Bulk Up. Drain Punch also provides Gallade with some longevity, especially after a few Bulk Ups, making it extremely hard to take down. Ice Punch gives Gallade handy super effective coverage against Ground- and Flying-types, while Night Slash slices apart Ghost- and Psychic-types that take little to no damage from Drain Punch.</p> <p>X-Scissor is more powerful than Night Slash, and is hence a better option to deal with Psychic-types; however, it leaves Gallade helpless against Ghost-types. Stone Edge is an alternative to Ice Punch, with higher Base Power but lower accuracy. The given EV spread allows Gallade to outpace neutral base 100 Speed Pokemon without Speed investment. HP EVs are maximized to provide the bulk that Gallade needs to take hits more comfortably. The leftover EVs are put into Attack and an Adamant nature is used to provide additional power, but the EVs can instead be placed in Special Defense to give Gallade an easier time setting up against special attackers. Gallade absolutely abhors status, especially burn and poison. A burn essentially shuts down Gallade and takes away any chance it might have at sweeping, while bad poison from Toxic will put Gallade on a timer, significantly decreasing the number of turns Gallade can be left on the field. Eviolite Dusclops is arguably the best counter to this set. It is immune to Gallade's STAB Drain Punch, takes pittance from even a boosted Night Slash, and can follow up with Will-O-Wisp. Slowbro is in the same boat, as its immense Defense lets it take Night Slashes comfortably.</p> "

  "Venomoth": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its RUBL status, Venomoth is an extremely potent Pokemon when used correctly. It's often thought that Venomoth is a high-risk / high-reward Pokemon, but this isn't exactly the case, as it's more along the lines of a mid-risk / very high-reward. It doesn't need in-battle support to work properly, just the right teammates so it can support them instead. And while it will absolutely wreck you if you underestimate it, don't overestimate it either, because it isn't all that easy to use due to its lack of bulk, which makes it hard to set up and restricts teammate options.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Venomoth can also take a slightly more offensive route and try to sweep itself by using Substitute over Baton Pass and Tinted Lens over Wonder Skin with either an offensive or defensive EV spread. An even more offensive set that takes full advantage of Tinted Lens with Life Orb and a fully offensive spread is possible, but you're usually better off using something else if that's the case, such as Lilligant or Rain Dance Kingdra, as Venomoth is usually a bit too weak to pull off sweeps this way. Another interesting option is Substitute / Disable / Quiver Dance / Bug Buzz with Tinted Lens, as this set will really mess with people who rely on Choice Scarf users to take on Venomoth.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>This part's really tricky. Between Sleep Powder and its ability to boost its Speed, there is almost no way of ensuring Venomoth won't get a successful pass off. The only 100% sure way of preventing Venomoth from doing its job is by carrying two Choice Scarf users faster than Venomoth that can OHKO it. That isn't what I'd call effective teambuilding, though. Usually you have to predict around the Sleep Powder, ensuring your faster Choice Scarf user isn't hit by it and can get in before Venomoth gets to +2. Examples of such Pokemon are Darmanitan, Victini, Mienshao (which risks missing with Stone Edge), and Flygon (which needs Stealth Rock to OHKO). You can also deal with it by predicting the thing what it's going to pass to and try to OHKO it on its way in, but this isn't exactly reliable.</p> <p>Other answers include Xatu, which bounces back Sleep Powder, has Psyshock to OHKO, and can Thunder Wave or U-turn out of the receiver as it comes in, giving you momentum. RestTalk Snorlax has a small chance to break up the play and doesn't really care about being asleep. Choice Band Sleep Talk Crobat is the perfect sleep absorber and can OHKO with either STAB move, but it's slower after a Quiver Dance and risks picking U-turn with Sleep Talk even if it somehow gets in before the Quiver Dance. The same goes with Choice Specs Sleep Talk Yanmega. Honestly, you're better off just discouraging Venomoth from setting up by playing smart and double switching a bit and/or hoping for a short sleep or Sleep Powder miss; that's how hard it is to stop Venomoth once it's in a position to set up.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "QuiverPass",
        "description": "<p>This set is meant to set up as many Quiver Dances as possible and then Baton Pass to a teammate to have them sweep. Sleep Powder makes this pretty easy, but be sure to not use it too early, or you might find it hard to get the actual pass off. The ideal situation to set up is when your opponent is in a situation where he can't hurt Venomoth (such as being Choice-locked into a Fighting-type attack or having a weak wall out), Quiver Dance on the switch (unless they have a faster Choice Scarf user, in which case you will need to predict a bit), then use Sleep Powder or Quiver Dance, depending on what came out, then Sleep Powder or Baton Pass. Don't get too greedy though, as a short sleep will mess up the strategy. You should be using Baton Pass right after Sleep Powder most of the time so as to maximize your chances of getting a successful pass off. Bug Buzz is mostly useful when Venomoth is up against a Roar user and has already used Sleep Powder. Wonder Skin will let it avoid Roar 50% of the time, so it has a good chance of outright beating them and then passing.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Speed and bulk to make setting up as easy as possible. Lowering the Speed might seem tempting, but you definitely don't want to go below 216 EVs (which beats Heracross), and you won't get much mileage out of the EVs you save anyway, rendering that option pointless. There is not much else you can change on this set without changing its actual purpose, really. Substitute over Bug Buzz gives you protection from weaker Dragon Tail users, such as Blastoise and Slowking. Using Tinted Lens with Special Attack EVs lets Venomoth attempt a sweep itself, but Venomoth is usually just better off Baton Passing to the appropriate teammate and Wonder Skin is too good to pass up.</p> <p>Speaking of teammates, this is the most important thing when considering Venomoth for your team. It's an amazing Pokemon, but it's not used very often because of how hard it is to fit into teams. The best QuiverPass receivers in the tier are easily Nidoqueen and Togekiss. The former is quite bulky, immune to Thunder Wave and Toxic, has amazing coverage, and does not care about the most common Choice Scarf user in the tier—Mienshao. The latter is also bulky, can boost its stats further with Nasty Plot, and—more importantly—can flinch its way past anything with a Speed boost. Special Kingdra is also worth mentioning, as it'll give you a receiver to pass to should your opponent send out a Fire-type Pokemon, which are common answers to Venomoth. Here's what's tricky, though: if you only have a couple of potential receivers, a lot of the time they will either be weakened from doing their other jobs (because you should not add Pokemon to your team for the sole purpose of receiving a QuiverPass), or they simply won't want to come out against whatever your opponent has out at the time. Because of this, it's recommended that if you're planning to use Venomoth, you should have a team that is composed of at least three, four, or even five special attackers. This is what makes Venomoth so hard to use effectively—you basically need to have built the perfect team for it to fit into.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Arcanine is one of those Pokemon that has the BST and movepool to be OU, but its typing and Speed come up just short. This is actually a good thing, however, as in UU, Arcanine has the opportunity to truly shine due to its well-rounded stats, amazing coverage, and impressive versatility. These assets lead to it being able to run a very dangerous physically offensive set, a very sturdy physical wall set, or even a surprising Sunny Day set. However, it's not all peaches for Arcanine. Being affected by every type of entry hazard, with a weakness to Stealth Rock to boot, doesn't do it any favors. Nevertheless, if you play it to its strengths and provide it with the proper support, Arcanine is sure to leave its mark in every battle it takes part in.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Arcanine's well-rounded stats and wide movepool allow it to fill many roles that have not been discussed above. However, many of these are either outclassed by other Pokemon or have some fatal flaw that prevent them from being as effective as the other sets. For example, Arcanine can sport a specially defensive EV spread in order to beat Ghost-types and other assorted special attackers. A mixed offensive set is another example, as Arcanine definitely has the offenses to pull it off, but the fact is that this set does not accomplish a single thing that the pure physical attacker fails to.</p> <p>Arcanine also has a few individual moves that may be appealing to its user, namely Flame Charge, Howl, and Rest + Sleep Talk. The first two are the only way Arcanine has to boost its stats; however, the boost is quite minimal and the cost of using them is too great, as Arcanine already suffers from a bad case of four-moveslot syndrome. The latter two are an alternate way for it to recover its HP, but with the change in sleep mechanics this generation, Arcanine would be forced to stay in for prolonged periods of time in order to make proper use of them--something it is not too keen on doing. Finally, the use of Arcanine's Dream World ability, Justified, might seem like a good idea at first, but when you consider how much more useful its other two abilities are, it becomes less appealing.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Arcanine's offensive set is exceedingly hard to switch into due to its impressive coverage and strong STAB. Slowbro is the best possible initial switch-in, as it only fears Wild Charge and Crunch and has Regenerator to mitigate the damage done by a misprediction. Swampert is a close second, as it takes just under half from the strongest move Arcanine can use on it, Close Combat, and can retaliate with either one of its STABs. Other Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune can also take care of it, but they have to be much more wary of switching into a super effective Wild Charge due to their lack of Regenerator. Rhyperior is also a very solid check, as even Close Combat fails to do too much damage thanks to Solid Rock. Due to Thick Fat giving it a virtual resistance to Flare Blitz, Snorlax makes a decent answer to Arcanine lacking Close Combat. Flygon fears being 2HKOed by a combination of Close Combat followed by Extreme Speed, but otherwise makes for a great check as it outspeeds Arcanine and can hit back with its STAB Earthquake.</p> <p>Because they are much less offensively threatening, Arcanine's other sets are nowhere near as hard to switch into. The physically defensive set shares many counters with the offensive one, provided they avoid the move that is meant to catch them on the switch. For example, Rhyperior and Swampert make excellent counters if Arcanine doesn't carry Will-O-Wisp or Hidden Power Grass. Similarly, Milotic switches in fearlessly if Arcanine lacks Toxic. The Sunny Day set will probably catch you off-guard the first time you switch into it, but once the element of surprise has been lost, you should be fine. Snorlax is a hard counter to Sunny Day Arcanine, as nothing on the set even comes close to scratching it. Houndoom also works, as it is immune to Arcanine's STAB and resists Solar Beam. Flygon is an even better check, as it outspeeds Arcanine, is unlikely to be hit by Solar Beam, and can OHKO with a STAB Earthquake. Finally, as has been previously emphasized, Arcanine absolutely detests entry hazards, so there's also the option of letting them slowly wear it down for you.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is undoubtedly Arcanine's most dangerous set; not only is it incredibly strong, but it also possesses impressive coverage and strong priority to boot. If this monster gets a single free switch-in and you can predict correctly, something is definitely going down. Flare Blitz acts as the primary STAB move here; its naturally high Base Power, combined with Arcanine's above average Attack and Life Orb, make it absolutely devastating to anything that doesn't resist it, especially if Arcanine manages to get a Flash Fire boost. Extreme Speed, in addition to making it much more difficult to revenge kill, gives Arcanine an additional niche in being able to pick off weakened faster opponents, such as Flygon and Azelf. Wild Charge gives this set the ability to hurt the Water-types that commonly like to switch into it, bar Swampert. Close Combat is Arcanine's best option against Rhyperior and Snorlax and gets a harder hit on Empoleon, Houndoom, and Porygon2; it's also Arcanine's strongest move against predicted Kingdra, Flygon, and Swampert switch-ins. Morning Sun simply acts as Arcanine's reliable recovery move, but using it comes with the cost of giving up a coverage move.</p> <p>The given EVs let Arcanine outrun neutral-natured base 85s such as Heracross, Nidoking, Suicune, and Kingdra, maximize its Attack, give it a Life Orb number in HP, and prevent beneficial Download boosts for Porygon2 as it comes in. You may adjust the EVs and nature as you see fit for your team, though. For example, running a Jolly nature ensures Arcanine outpaces even positive-natured base 85s, and if you bump the Speed EVs up to 216, Arcanine also becomes faster than offensive Roserade. You may also choose to give up some power in order to increase Arcanine's bulk. A spread of 192 HP / 136 Atk / 4 SpD / 176 Spe will not only let it switch in more easily to check various threats, but also considerably decrease the recoil done by Flare Blitz and Wild Charge. Leftovers is an option if you decide to go this route, as it has good synergy with the added bulk. If you decide to stick to pure offense though, Arcanine can use a Choice Band if you dislike the Life Orb recoil and don't mind being locked into a single move; however, this fails to take advantage of Arcanine's awesome coverage. Flash Fire is the primary ability as it grants Arcanine a potential boost to its already devastating Flare Blitz, but Intimidate can help soften blows from any physical attack as Arcanine switches in, making it a very viable option.</p> <p>This set appreciates two things above all else: entry hazard removal is the first, as Arcanine already has quite a short lifespan due to the recoil it takes from Life Orb and two of its moves. Secondly, a partner that can ease the pressure put on your team by opposing Fire-types is also recommended so that Arcanine doesn't need to come in and take hits too often. Blastoise thus makes an excellent partner for Arcanine, as it can not only easily switch into various Fire-types, but also use Rapid Spin to rid the field of entry hazards. If a more offensive approach is your thing, look no further than Kabutops, which can accomplish many of the same things as Blastoise while still posing a significant offensive threat to the opponent. Roserade is another excellent partner, as it can not only switch into the Water-types that threaten Arcanine and absorb Toxic Spikes upon entry, but also lay down Spikes to make Arcanine's assaults all the more dangerous. Finally, in order to take full advantage of the holes Arcanine tears into enemy lines, you should pair it with a second physically offensive Fire-type, such as Choice Scarf Darmanitan or Victini.</p> "

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<p>While it might seem odd to give such an offensive juggernaut a defensive set, Arcanine actually makes for quite a sturdy wall, as it can easily check or counter most Heracross, physical Victini, Cobalion, Darmanitan, Escavalier, Swords Dance Mew, Weavile, opposing Arcanine, and many other dangerous physical threats. Additionally, with Sand Stream now banished from UU, Morning Sun consistently recovers half of Arcanine's HP, making this set all the more amazing.</p> <p>Flare Blitz is Arcanine's strongest move and is the most immediately threatening thing it can do to repel the Pokemon it switches into, while Flamethrower is a weaker alternative that lacks the recoil. Extreme Speed lets Arcanine pick off weakened faster threats, such as Weavile, Azelf, and Flygon, before they can do anything else. Hidden Power Grass lets Arcanine hurt bulky Water-types a bit and always 2HKOes Swampert and Rhyperior, giving Arcanine the potential to net surprise KOs on them. Doing this will sometimes mean the opposition won't have the opportunity to lay down Stealth Rock at all, greatly prolonging Arcanine's lifespan. Morning Sun is Arcanine's reliable recovery move, letting it stick around for a while so it can do its job of supporting the team. The final moveslot is dedicated to a status move: Will-O-Wisp lets Arcanine cripple many of its common switch-ins--namely Swampert, Rhyperior, and Flygon--while Toxic does the same to bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro.</p> <p>The given EVs serve to optimize Arcanine's physical bulk so that it can do its job of checking the many physically offensive behemoths in UU effectively. As you may have noticed, this set can attack either physically, specially, or even go mixed with Flare Blitz and Hidden Power Grass as its attacks, so you must pick your nature accordingly. It's worth noting that using a Relaxed nature still lets Arcanine be faster than the standard 8 Speed Milotic by 3 points without any investment. This set can also make use of Roar in order to spread hazard damage around the opposing team and phaze away setup sweepers that don't fear its offensive moves, most notably Dragon Dance Kingdra and Curse Snorlax. Intimidate is by far the most effective ability on this set as it lets Arcanine check physical threats much more easily. However, the use of Flash Fire is not exactly unheard of, as it not only gives Arcanine a potential boost to its STAB, but also lets it switch into Bisharp without giving it an Attack boost from Defiant.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is the most essential thing to make the most out of this set, as not only is Arcanine susceptible to every type of entry hazard, but it also comes with a weakness to the most common one to boot. Hitmontop therefore makes a good partner to this set, as it resists the Rock-type moves commonly aimed at Arcanine; furthermore, they form a very solid defensive core that not many physical attackers can break due to the threat of double Intimidate. Blastoise and Kabutops also work, but not as well, as they like to come in to Rapid Spin on the same threats that Arcanine counters, making them defensively redundant partners. Grass-types are also solid teammates, especially Roserade, as it can not only switch in for free on the Water-types that threaten Arcanine, but also lay down Spikes to take advantage of the switches Arcanine forces. On top of that, it even absorbs Toxic Spikes upon entry, something that Arcanine greatly appreciates.</p> "

        "name": "Sunny Day",
        "description": "<p>Arcanine makes a fantastic user of Sunny Day, mitigating its weakness to Water-type attacks, boosting its STAB Fire-type attacks, and making Morning Sun recover two-thirds of its HP. This set also gives Arcanine a great way to get past usual counters such as Rhyperior and Swampert with Solar Beam, making it very difficult to play around. Fire Blast is the primary pick for STAB here due to Arcanine's average Special Attack stat, but Flamethrower is also usable if better accuracy and PP are more up your alley. Morning Sun rounds out the set, giving Arcanine a way of recovering HP outside of Leftovers, and as stated previously, becoming even more effective while the sunlight is strong.</p> <p>While Arcanine's moveset is pretty much set in stone, every other aspect of this set is not. For example, a slightly bulkier EV spread of 248 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD is viable as it prevents even Choice Scarf Heracross from 2HKOing Arcanine with Close Combat, making switching in a bit easier. A faster spread of 72 HP / 252 SpA / 8 SpD / 176 Spe gives Arcanine the opportunity to outrun everything with base 85 Speed or lower with the appropriate nature, but at the cost of a lot of bulk. Leftovers is the recommended item, as it has good synergy with a bulky EV spread, but Life Orb is viable if you prefer power over longevity. Flash Fire is also a usable ability, as it grants Arcanine a few free switch-in opportunities and a potential boost to its Fire-type STAB move, but Intimidate is a more consistent ability, making it the primary option.</p> <p>In order for this set to work properly, you will want to pair it with a strong Pursuit user to ensure Victini can't switch into Arcanine freely. Snorlax and Houndoom are the best at this, as they can fearlessly switch into most things Victini can throw at them, bar Focus Blast, and proceed to trap it. However, other Pursuit users, such as Krookodile, work as well. Rapid Spin support is not absolutely required, but is nevertheless appreciated, as Arcanine is affected by every type of entry hazard and has a weakness to the most common one. Hitmontop fills this role excellently, as it even lures out Victini for your Pursuit user to take care of it.</p> "

  "Machamp": {
    "overview": "<p>Meet Machamp, a Pokemon who has always struck fear into the hearts of those who face it, so much so that it has been OU in some of the past generations, which goes to show how good it really is. Its main selling point nowadays is access to a perfect accuracy Dynamic Punch, thanks to its great ability, No Guard. This, in combination with its massive base 130 Attack, means it is an absolute terror to face in battle. It's not all peaches for Machamp though, as its Speed is pretty low and it only has slightly above average bulk, which means it isn't necessarily built to last. Additionally, Dynamic Punch has a measly 8 PP, which can be gone before you know it during extended battles. That said, if you don't keep this monster in mind when you build your team, you're sure to get absolutely wrecked.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Because of Machamp's wide offensive movepool, many potential sets come to mind. However, most of these tend to be outclassed by other Pokemon. For example, a Choice Band set employing Dynamic Punch, Stone Edge, Thunder Punch, and Ice Punch is feasible, but Heracross does it better thanks to its higher damage output, greater Speed, and awesome secondary STAB. In a similar vein, a Guts abuse set which uses Close Combat instead of Dynamic Punch for STAB is also possible, but again, it is outclassed by Heracross. As a Pokemon who hits extraordinarily hard but has a middling Speed stat, a Choice Scarf set might seem like a good idea; however, even with this item attached, Machamp can't even outpace Timid Mismagius, making it a poor choice. A Rest + Sleep Talk set has been the standard for Machamp in past generations, but with the change in sleep mechanics in BW, this set becomes underwhelming.</p> <p>Machamp also possesses a variety of other moves it can use, such as Earthquake, which it can use to hit Nidoking and Nidoqueen much harder than Ice Punch. Fire Punch is also usable, but the only notable target would be Escavalier, who already loses to Machamp. Bullet Punch gives it some form of priority, but between its low Base Power and lack of STAB, its damage output will be disappointing. Knock Off can be used for support, especially since two of its greatest enemies, Dusclops and Gligar, are commonly seen carrying Eviolite. Surprisingly enough, Machamp also has access to Light Screen, which it can use as a buffer to special hits aimed at it or its teammates.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because of its access to a 100% accurate Dynamic Punch, countering Machamp is usually an uphill battle. That said, bulky Ghost-types, such as Dusclops and Spiritomb, make the best counters, as they are immune to Dynamic Punch and can burn Machamp with Will-O-Wisp, effectively neutering it. Similarly, Sableye has little to fear from Machamp as it has Prankster Will-O-Wisp to burn Machamp with. Slowbro and Slowking are almost perfect counters, as they will never get hit with a full-power Payback due to their low Speed and won't fall easily to Thunder Punch. Gligar resists Machamp's STAB, has enough bulk to work through confusion, and can Roost to heal off any damage it might incur; it needs to watch out for Ice Punch though. Faster, hard hitting Psychic-types, such as Azelf, make good checks due to the sheer damage they can do to Machamp. Crobat is a shaky check, but it does quadruple resist Dynamic Punch and has STAB Brave Bird to hit back with. Nidoking and Nidoqueen resist all of Machamp's common moves and can hit back hard with Sheer Force boosted STAB moves, but they need to be wary of Ice Punch as well. Additionally, they can even lay down Toxic Spikes, which are sure to ruin any Machamp set. Zapdos resists Dynamic Punch and has Pressure to deplete Machamp's PP very quickly, but it needs to be careful of switching into Stone Edge. Suicune works similarly in terms of Pressure, but it simply has enough bulk to take a couple Dynamic Punches and is not weak to Stone Edge. Generally, if switching directly into Machamp is not an option, you can always resort to simply hitting it repeatedly with strong moves, which will eventually bring it down.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Already one of the most infuriating Pokemon to face, Substitute takes this to a whole different level by preventing easy revenge kills and forcing people to attack Machamp through confusion. Dynamic Punch is the primary STAB option here, as the 100% confusion rate makes it exceedingly hard to play around. Stone Edge provides good coverage by hitting the Flying-types who resist its STAB, such as Zapdos and Crobat, super effectively; it also has the bonus of never missing due to No Guard. Thunder Punch is used almost exclusively for Slowbro and Suicune, as the former is a hard counter to Machamp and the latter can easily wear down all its PP due to Pressure. However, in order to actually get past either one, you might have to get a bit lucky in terms on confusion. Toxic is also usable, as it does a number on a lot of Machamp's usual checks and counters, such as Slowbro, Sableye, and Spiritomb.</p> <p>The given Speed EVs ensure Machamp outpaces 0 Speed Porygon2, Swampert, and Empoleon, but more can be used to make sure you beat those who invest a bit as well. Attack is then maximized to do as much damage as possible, and the rest of the EVs are thrown into HP so that Machamp takes hits a bit better. Ice Punch is a usable move on this set, as it scores a good hit on Gligar and Nidoqueen, and is likely the only way you're breaking through them. Payback may also be used for coverage, as it hits faster Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Mismagius and Azelf, for big damage.</p> <p>Machamp appreciates being paired with Pokemon who can take Psychic- and Flying-type moves for it, such as Bronzong or Empoleon. Both of these can also set up Stealth Rock to help Machamp be even more dangerous. Additional entry hazard support is also quite useful to maximize Machamp's utility, as Dynamic Punch's confusion rate will force a lot of switches, and in turn rack up more residual damage. Roserade makes an excellent partner, as it can lay down Spikes, absorb the Toxic Spikes that Machamp hates, and even heal any status Machamp incurs through the use of Aromatherapy. Pairing Machamp with a Pokemon who can take advantage of the chaos it tends to leave in its wake is usually a good idea. One such partner would be Swords Dance Cobalion, as they share many similar counters that are sure to be very weakened once Machamp does its job.</p> "

        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>This set works best on offensive teams looking for a bulky setup sweeper who can break other offensive teams. Bulk Up is the crux of the set, allowing Machamp to amplify its damage output and physical bulk at the same time. Dynamic Punch is Machamp's choice of STAB; its primary draw on this set is that its confusion rate will allow Machamp to set up multiple Bulk Ups pretty easily. Stone Edge is a great coverage move, hitting the Flying-types that resist Machamp's STAB, such as Zapdos and Crobat, for super effective damage. Thunder Punch hits bulky Water-types hard and allows Machamp to conserve Dynamic Punch PP against them. Ice Punch provides coverage on Nidoking and Nidoqueen, while also significantly damaging Gligar.</p> <p>The given EVs simply maximize damage output while allowing Machamp to outpace 0 Speed Empoleon and Porygon2. The remainder gets thrown into HP to tank hits better. A more specially defensive EV spread can be used to set up on weaker special attackers, such as defensive Roserade and Porygon2, especially since Bulk Up will be boosting Machamp's Defense. It will also allow it to stay in on and kill Pokemon such as Raikou who come in to revenge kill Machamp. Substitute can be used over Machamp's secondary coverage move, as it allows it to avoid status and set up easily on most physical attackers. Payback hits faster Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Mismagius and Azelf, harder than anything else.</p> <p>Like any Machamp set employing Dynamic Punch, this set is bound to force many switches; therefore, you should pair it with an entry hazard setter to take advantage of this. Toxic Spikes ruin Bulk Up Machamp, so pairing it with a grounded Poison-type, such as Roserade, is a good idea. Roserade can also use Aromatherapy to get rid of any other status Machamp might incur. Steel-types also make excellent partners, as they can easily tank any Flying- and Psychic-type moves aimed at Machamp. As a bonus, most of them can also set Stealth Rock, which help Machamp rack up more damage through the switches it forces.</p> "

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowbro boasts excellent physical bulk, as well as key resistances to the Fire- and Fighting-types, giving it a strong niche in UU as an excellent physical wall and tank that can check many of UU's strongest physical attackers, such as Victini, Mienshao, and Darmanitan. Its ability Regenerator allows it to regain health upon switching out, allowing it to stay healthy enough to switch into such threats repeatedly. Thanks to its good offensive movepool and Special Attack, it can also function as a solid offensive threat, either as a wallbreaker with Choice Specs or a bulky sweeper with Calm Mind, using its immense physical bulk and solid defensive typing to find setup opportunities. However, Slowbro's typing, despite providing valuable resistances, also has several crippling weaknesses that leave it vulnerable to other popular threats such as Shaymin, Raikou, Zapdos, Roserade, and Heracross. Its middling special bulk further exacerbates this flaw against said Pokemon, something to keep in mind when using Slowbro.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Slowbro has a surprisingly extensive movepool, both offensive and supportive. It can run an offensive Trick Room set, but that's probably better left to Slowking due to its access to Nasty Plot. Slowbro can also support Trick Room teams, however uncommon they might be, tanking hits and casting the move so another Pokemon can sweep with it. However, Bronzong can probably pull that off better thanks to learning Explosion and therefore having the ability to create a free switch for something like Curse Snorlax to sweep. It can also go offensive with Life Orb instead of Choice Specs, trading losing 10% health after each move for the ability to switch moves, but since it'll be forced out to regain health anyway, the sheer power of Choice Specs is almost always better.</p> <p>Outside of the listed moves, Slowbro can run supportive moves such as Yawn—acting as a phazer by forcing the opponent to switch out—, Disable, and Psych Up on the Physical Tank set, while having offensive option such as Ice Beam, Signal Beam, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast for the Choice Specs set, though they're generally inferior options to its main coverage moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Shaymin is probably the top Slowbro counter, not fearing status thanks to Natural Cure and taking just a little over 50% from Fire Blast—unless it's coming from the Choice Specs set. It can then proceed to KO with Seed Flare or set up a Substitute on the predicted switch. Roserade only fears Psyshock and Fire Blast, but it can come in on anything else and proceed to set up Spikes, put Slowbro to sleep, or outright KO it with Giga Drain or Leaf Storm. Scrafty can usually switch in unscathed, thanks to its typing and the fact that it generally either has Lum Berry or Shed Skin to cure it from burns, and can use Slowbro as setup fodder. This is especially true for Bulk Up variants, since they normally have heavy investment in Special Defense and take little from Scald and Fire Blast, while being immune to Psyshock.</p> <p>Slowbro has many common weaknesses, but many Pokemon can't switch in on it with ease without knowing its set. Once they realize what Slowbro's running, though, it becomes easier to deal with. Mew, for example, takes little damage from most of its moves—outside of the uncommon Signal Beam and Shadow Ball—thanks to its natural bulk, but fears status and has a hard time beating Calm Mind versions if it switches in while Slowbro sets up. Still, Nasty Plot Mew can usually beat any Slowbro set one on one unless it switches in on a status move. Some Kingdra variants—such as Substitute, ChestoRest, and Lum Berry—can set up on the physical tank all day, but they fear Psyshock from the Choice Specs set and won't be able to beat the Calm Mind version if they switch while Slowbro boosts. Zapdos and Raikou fear paralysis, but they can switch in on anything Slowbro throws at them and outright KO or set up a Substitute or Calm Mind in Raikou's case. Opposing bulky Water-types Suicune and Milotic can come in on any move Slowbro has—though Suicune needs Rest to avoid being worn down— and proceed to Toxic or set up on it. As most variants are mono-attackers, they won't precisely like being Tricked a Choice Specs and Grass Knot will also hurt them, but they won't be completely crippled by either move. Finally, Virizion and Heracross fear Fire Blast and Psyshock, but they can switch in after Slowbro has beat something and proceed to set up on it or KO it. Moxie Heracross and Lum Berry-less Virizion should be wary of Scald burns, though, since a healthy Slowbro won't be OHKOed by their STABs without setup. Overall though, Slowbro is quite powerful and not easily handled, but it can be worked around by exploiting the defensive sets' lack of immediate power and the fact that it's Choice-locked when using the Choice Specs set.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This is the standard Calm Mind Slowbro, a set that's existed since the third generation, albeit with the gifts it got from the two generations that followed. Still, it plays pretty much the same way, being a physical tank capable of boosting its weaker Special Defense and its usable Special Attack stat at the same time, similarly to how CurseLax plays on the specially defensive field. The strategy is simple: switch it in on a physical move the Hermit Crab Pokemon resists—e.g. Mienshao's High Jump Kick or Darmanitan's Flare Blitz—and Calm Mind on the predicted switch to a special attacker. If Slowbro manages to get a couple of boosts behind its belly, it'll be very hard to take out, barring critical hits.</p> <p>Though Calm Mind also improves Slowbro's Special Attack, this set is not really meant to sweep as much as it's meant to be able to tank hits on both defensive sides; that said, it can work as a late-game sweeper once its counters have been weakened, just like most stat-boosters. Teams leaning towards stall really appreciate Slowbro's power, as it is a nice tank that can take both physical and special attacks—despite its five weaknesses. Scald and Psyshock are its STAB moves of choice, the former has a 30% chance to burn the target, which particularly makes physical attackers such as Snorlax easier to beat, while the latter enables Slowbro to win Calm Mind wars against Suicune and Virizion that switch in while Slowbro uses Calm Mind. Slack Off rounds out the set, giving Slowbro a way to recover HP without having to switch out and lose its boosts.</p> <p>The 16 Special Attack EVs let Slowbro OHKO standard 252/0 Roserade with Psyshock on the switch after Stealth Rock, while the rest are used to optimize physical defense to make the most of its bulk. Fire Blast can be used instead of either of Slowbro's STAB moves to hit Shaymin—and to a lesser extent, Bronzong—harder, though doing so means losing out on beating things it otherwise should, such as Arcanine, Darmanitan, and Machamp, the first two being hit harder by Scald, and the latter by Psyshock.</p> <p>As for partners, Pokemon that can absorb Toxic Spikes (however rare they might be) really help Slowbro succeed. Amoonguss and Roserade stand out, each having its perks over the other: for one, Amoonguss has much better overall bulk, Regenerator, and the rare Spore, while Roserade can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, is much faster and more powerful, can absorb status thanks to Natural Cure and can use Sleep Powder, which though not as reliable as Spore and unfortunately illegal with Spikes, does go well with its high Speed stat. Other options for a Toxic Spikes absorber include Nidoking and Nidoqueen, both being able to set up Stealth Rock and having more offensive presence due to Sheer Force. A paralysis spreader can also be useful to get around Slowbro's Speed issues. Notable ones, though gimmicky, are Whimsicott and Liepard, both having access to Prankster to get priority on Stun Spore and Thunder Wave, respectively. Double status Amoonguss is another good option for spreading paralysis, being able to cripple another Pokemon after Sleep Clause has activated. Finally, things that can lure in and take out Suicune and Milotic (especially RestTalk variants) also make good teammates for Slowbro. Special mention here goes to mixed Victini, which is amazing at luring bulky Water-types and hitting them hard with Thunderbolt or Grass Knot—or the now available Bolt Strike. However, Rotom-H can also do the trick if it predicts the switch (no pun intended).</p> "

        "name": "Physical Tank",
        "description": "<p>This set is a great asset on balanced teams that struggle with Fighting-types other than Heracross and Scrafty. Scald is the set's main move, having a notable chance to completely cripple the physical attackers Slowbro has to counter. Psyshock is a bit better than Psychic as the Fighting-types it's used for have better Special Defense on average, and Psyshock also hits Roserade on its weaker defensive stat. Slack Off offers the Hermit Crab Pokemon a means of recovery in case it can't reliably switch out. Thunder Wave can go on the last slot to paralyze faster things (like 80% of the metagame, accounting for immunities) that try to switch in on it, but Fire Blast is an option to hit Shaymin harder.</p> <p>It should be noted that Slowking has access to Dragon Tail to not be setup fodder, but Slowbro has the advantages of having higher natural physical bulk and being able to run both of its STABs on the same set, something Slowking can't do without losing either a support or a recovery move.</p> <p>16 Special Attack EVs let Slowbro KO Roserade on the switch after Stealth Rock, while the rest goes to optimizing physical defense. Ice Beam can be used to KO Flygon, but a burnt Flygon is already as good as dead (and it will usually U-turn out of Slowbro); Ice Beam can also hit Druddigon super effectively. Grass Knot is another option to hit opposing bulky Water-types harder. Yawn can also be used in the last slot, being able to phaze opponents that try to set up on Slowbro.</p> <p>Roserade and Amoonguss partner up well with this set, the former being faster and more powerful and the latter being much bulkier, forming a solid Regenerator core with Slowbro for defensive and balanced teams to fall back on. Offensive Snorlax can benefit from Slowbro's paralysis and burn spreading, allowing it to hit things hard more reliably. It should be noted that, defensively speaking, a core of Slowbro, Aromatherapy Roserade, and Snorlax is very difficult to break, but it just takes one misprediction for Heracross to sweep your team. Lastly, this set fears Toxic poison, so a cleric and a Toxic Spikes absorber can be useful. Roserade fills both niches, but Mismagius can also work on balanced teams.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Unlike the previous sets, this one capitalizes on Slowbro's good base 100 Special Attack stat, hitting 492 with a Modest nature and Choice Specs. Here, it functions well as a bulky pivot for more offensive teams, but isn't as good on defensive teams due to the big loss in bulk. Surf gets the upper hand here instead of Scald, being more powerful overall—though if you need the burn chance, Scald is perfectly usable. Psyshock is a bit better than Psychic against the things Slowbro will be using it on (notably Snorlax), but Psychic still OHKOes standard 252/240+ Roserade after Stealth Rock. Fire Blast offers coverage against Shaymin and Bronzong that try to switch in on Slowbro, and Grass Knot rounds out the set giving it coverage against the ever-present bulky Water-types. Trick is an option in the last slot, though, crippling special walls such as Snorlax and Umbreon.</p> <p>Regenerator is probably more important here than on the other sets, since Slowbro is being used as a hit-and-run Pokemon without any other form of recovery. The EVs make Slowbro a full tank, investing in HP and Special Attack. The leftover EVs go to Speed to outpace uninvested Snorlax, Amoonguss, and opposing Slowbro. An alternate spread of 248 HP / 120 Def / 140 SpA with a Modest nature can be used to prevent Life Orb Darmanitan from 2HKOing Slowbro after Stealth Rock, while still reliably OHKOing Shaymin and Bronzong after Stealth Rock, but this Slowbro isn't meant to tank repeated hits anyway, and the standard spread already reliably counters Choice Scarf Darmanitan and Choice Scarf Victini, their most-used sets. Ice Beam can be used to hit Flygon and Druddigon for super effective damage, while also hurting Shaymin. Signal Beam and Focus Blast are other coverage options, hitting Umbreon harder than anything else, while also getting coverage on opposing Slowbro and Slowking and opposing Snorlax and Empoleon, respectively, but they're otherwise weaker than the listed options.</p> <p>As for teammates, a Pokemon that can spread paralysis is a great asset to this Slowbro. While Prankster users Whimsicott and Liepard are good at it, Togekiss is also an option with Thunder Wave or Serene Grace Body Slam, and double status Amoonguss can be used to form the BroMoonguss Regenerator core. Though Slowbro's ability helps most of the times, Rapid Spin support can be useful to prevent 2HKOs from turning into OHKOs with Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Hitmontop is probably the best option, being able to switch into Heracross's Megahorn and Scrafty's Crunch with ease thanks to Intimidate, while also not sharing weaknesses with Slowbro like Blastoise and Kabutops do. Finally, while not as mandatory as the Calm Mind set since this Slowbro is pretty self-sufficient, Pokemon that can lure in and KO Suicune and Milotic, such as Expert Belt mixed Victini and Rotom-H, can also be useful.</p> "

With an exceptional base 120 Special Attack stat, Magneton can run offensive sets effectively, either by punching holes in the opposing team with Choice Specs equipped or by boosting its speed with Choice Scarf. Magneton also has decent defenses, which can be increased by Eviolite, and with an incredible number of resistances it can switch in against a wide array of attacks and set up sturdy Substitutes.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Unfortunately, Magneton is not blessed with a very diverse movepool. Discharge can be used as an alternative to Thunderbolt if the idea of a 30% chance to paralyze the opponent interests you. Toxic or Thunder Wave can be used on a set with Substitute to inflict status upon Magneton's switch-ins, but they do not have enough utility to be worth an entire moveslot. A set with Charge Beam can be used to boost Magneton's Special Attack while retaining the freedom of switching moves, but Magneton doesn't have the Speed to pull off a set like that effectively. If you intend to use Magneton for a support role, it has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, though Magneton will sorely miss the boost from Eviolite if it uses Light Clay to extend the duration of the screens.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Despite its many resistances, Magneton is burdened with weaknesses to three very common attacking types. Swampert, Rhyperior, and Nidoqueen are the most reliable counters, as they are immune to Magneton's Electric-type attacks and can respond with powerful Ground-type moves. Snorlax can shrug off most of Magneton's attacks due to its huge Special Defense stat, but must be wary of the Choice Specs set. In general, Ground-type Pokemon deal with Magneton fairly well, although they have to watch out for Magnet Rise and Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>There are also many offensive Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type Pokemon that can check Magneton. Examples of these Pokemon include Darmanitan, Flygon, Nidoking, Heracross, Scrafty, and Mienshao. Although Magneton excels at trapping Steel-types, there exist a few that Magneton cannot reliably handle. Registeel has an extremely high Special Defense stat that allows it to take multiple Thunderbolts, and often carries Seismic Toss, which is a 3HKO due to Magneton's poor HP stat. Cobalion is much faster than Magneton and can OHKO it with a STAB Close Combat, but must watch out for the Choice Scarf set. Although uncommon, opposing Magneton can trap it and deal severe damage with Hidden Power Fire.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Magneton's utility lies in its ability to trap and knock out Steel-types, which is the primary goal of this set. Substitute blocks all forms of status and scouts the opponent's actions. With Magnet Rise, Magneton can escape lethal Ground-type attacks and safely set up a Substitute. This is particularly useful against Bronzong, who would normally be able to survive two Thunderbolts and 2HKO Magneton with Earthquake. Furthermore, it makes the task of revenge killing Magneton much more difficult for Ground-type Pokemon, as most lack a secondary move to damage it.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is Magneton's most reliable STAB option, hitting everything that doesn't resist it for substantial damage. Hidden Power Ice has great coverage with Thunderbolt and allows Magneton to nail Ground-types for super effective damage. It also gives Magneton the ability to revenge kill Flygon locked into Outrage, as Outrage deals pitiful damage to Magneton.</p> <p>The HP EVs in conjunction with Eviolite ensure that Magneton will always survive Bronzong's Earthquake with enough HP to use Substitute afterward. This allows Magneton to eliminate Bronzong and still retain its Substitute, as Bronzong's Gyro Ball takes seven hits to break it. The Speed EVs provide Magneton with a Speed stat of 220, which allows it to outpace Modest Empoleon. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack to give Magneton's attacks some additional power. Alternatively, an EV spread of 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe can be used if you prefer power over survivability, but you will need to be even more careful switching into Bronzong because Earthquake will inflict considerably more damage. The choice of Hidden Power depends largely on the team Magneton is supporting, though Hidden Power Ice is generally the superior option. Nevertheless, Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Swampert and Rhyperior for more damage, but it should be noted that Rhyperior can't touch Magneton after it uses Magnet Rise anyway. Finally, Hidden Power Fire has some utility for dealing with uncommon threats such as Escavalier and enemy Magneton.</p> <p>Magneton should be paired with Pokemon that require Steel-types to be removed before they sweep. Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Flygon and Kingdra, appreciate the absence of Steel-types and concurrently attract Outrages, which Magneton can set up on. Choice Band Crobat is another great partner; it can lure Steel-types and switch directly to Magneton with U-turn, and once they're removed, can run through teams with Brave Bird. In general, offensive Flying-type Pokemon pair well with Magneton due to great type synergy and the increased chance of a sweep that Steel-type removal offers. Victini can absorb the Fighting- and Fire-type attacks aimed at Magneton, though unfortunately they share a Ground-type weakness.</p> "

Hidden Power Ice provides amazing coverage alongside Thunderbolt and is very useful for dealing with the ever-popular Flygon.

Honchkrow makes a great partner because it can sweep much more easily once Cobalion and Durant are removed, and has no trouble disposing of Registeel with Superpower. Choice Band Crobat is another good offensive partner, and the two form an effective VoltTurn core together.

        "description": "<p>This set focuses on Magneton's often overlooked base 120 Special Attack stat. Magneton possesses the second highest Special Attack stat out of all of the Electric-types in UU, and this set takes advantage of that by utilizing Choice Specs. After the boost from Choice Specs, Magneton reaches a colossal 556 Special Attack stat. Analytic further boosts the power of Magneton's moves by 30% if it moves second, allowing it to punch major holes in the opposing team with each attack. Although Magneton doesn't boast great defenses, it carries one of the best STABs for an offensive Pokemon and can find many opportunities to switch in on one of its 13 resistances. Thunderbolt is Magneton's main STAB attack and will leave craters in the opposing team after the boost from Choice Specs and Analytic. Volt Switch allows Magneton to maintain momentum while still inflicting sizable damage to its switch-ins. Flash Cannon offers decent coverage alongside Thunderbolt and OHKOes common switch-ins such as Rhyperior and Flygon. In the final slot, Hidden Power Grass rounds off the set by granting Magneton a way to get around Swampert, but Thunder is a viable option simply for its insane power. To get a better perspective of the destructive force behind Magneton's Thunder, it always 2HKOes standard RestTalk Snorlax with Stealth Rock support, and is capable of dealing up to 70% to specially defensive Umbreon and Registeel on the switch.</p> <p>The listed EVs maximize Magneton's Special Attack to give its attacks the highest damage output possible. The Speed EVs give Magneton a Speed stat of 210, which allows it to outspeed Modest Omastar and defensive Gligar. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to give Magneton some much-needed bulk. A Modest nature is used over a Timid nature because Magneton benefits more from power than Speed, and Analytic Magneton is most effective when it's slower than its opposition. Analytic is a huge factor in the effectiveness of this set, so it is not recommended to use Magnet Pull instead. Magneton does not have many other attacking options worth noting, but Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hidden Power Grass if Grass-types are more worrisome to you than Swampert. That being said, Flash Cannon is capable of OHKOing Shaymin after Stealth Rock damage and easily 2HKOes defensive Roserade.</p> <p>Magneton enjoys having teammates that can create opportunities for it to switch in with little cost and start wreaking havoc. As such, Flygon is a natural teammate for Magneton, being able to switch effortlessly into the Ground- and Fire-type attacks often aimed at Magneton. Flygon also lures in bulky Water-types and other physically defensive Pokemon that Magneton can easily dispose of. In return, Magneton can absorb the Outrages often aimed at Flygon. The two form a solid VoltTurn core, and cover each others' weaknesses very well. Crobat is in a similar position and enjoys the removal of Rock-type Pokemon, such as Rhyperior, that Magneton can lure in and eliminate. If you are using Thunder, a partner that can set up Rain Dance will be very beneficial. Tornadus does this especially well thanks to Prankster, which gives its Rain Dance +1 priority.</p> "

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Kangaskhan has three attributes that stand out: it has a name which is nearly impossible to spell, it boasts good defenses and HP, and it possesses below average attacking stats. However, what makes Kangaskhan shine is hidden beneath the surface, a very underrated yet potent ability known as Scrappy. Scrappy negates the Ghost-type immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type moves, which allows Kangaskhan to use moves such as Low Kick and Double-Edge without fear of Ghost-types switching in; Kangaskhan uses that niche to attack with impunity. What Kangaskhan lacks in power, it makes up for in utility; the ability to achieve perfect coverage between just two moves is more than enough to justify Kangaskhan a spot on a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>In BW, Kangaskhan finally got access to a boosting move in Work Up. The move boosts Attack and Special Attack by 1 stage, and is probably most effective when used in one of the last two slots of the Choice Band set. Just make sure when using Work Up, change the item, as locking yourself into a boosting move is foolish. With Kangaskhan's fantastic special movepool, a mixed set with Work Up seems appealing, but due to its horrible Special Attack stat and Tauros being able to do this better, a mixed set just isn't viable. A support set is possible, with moves such as Counter and Circle Throw, but with Kangaskhan's relatively poor defenses and lack of recovery, these moves are hard to pull off, and is best left to another Pokemon. Disable is usable, but Kangaskhan just doesn't have the ability to pull it off properly. A set of Fake Out, Endeavor, Return / Reversal, and Sucker Punch can be used, but Endeavor is slightly unreliable. However, with team support and proper prediction, it can pay huge dividends. Endure and Reversal is available, but until Salac Berry is released, it should be avoided. Kangaskhan gets Wish as an ADV event, but the lack of Scrappy, and the fact Lickilicky can do this better, makes Wish a poor choice in the long run.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The Choice Band set is difficult to counter or even check, but it can be played around, with various degrees of success. Rhyperior will never be OHKOed by Kangaskhan, and can hit back with powerful Earthquakes, but can't take repeated Hammer Arms. Steel- and Rock-types wall Kangaskhan as long as they avoid a Choice Band-boosted Fighting-type move. A bulky Hitmontop can take Kangaskhan on with Intimidate and Close Combat, but due to the lack of reliable recovery, it'll get worn down, slowly but surely. Gligar and Escavalier can counter Kangaskhan, but each need to be wary of the elemental punch they're weak to. SubPunch and Life Orb sets are easier to check, as most defensive Pokemon with reliable recovery and a decent STAB move can take Kangaskhan on, and win one-on-one. Defensive Arcanine and Zapdos can take on the SubPunch set, but both are weak to Stealth Rock, and both dislike repeated hits from Life Orb-boosted Double-Edge. Slowbro can take on any Kangaskhan set and possibly burn it with Scald and Slack Off repeatedly until Kangaskhan faints from the Life Orb recoil, or runs out of PP.</p> ",

Hammer Arm provides perfect coverage with Double-Edge. Kangaskhan also has access to Drain Punch, which can be used to counteract hazards or Pokemon which outsped and hurt it before getting KOed. However, due to its low HP regaining abilities, Hammer Arm is generally superior to Drain Punch. Aqua Tail is the only thing that can 2HKO Rhyperior running 140 HP EVs, while Earthquake deals high damage to Pokemon like Qwilfish, Nidoqueen, and Arcanine. Sucker Punch should only be used for revenge killing if you're feeling gutsy. The EVs should be obvious, max Attack and Speed for a Pokemon whose job is to outspeed and KO its opponents.</p> <p>Kangaskhan has a relatively vast movepool, allowing it to pack specific moves to beat certain counters or whatever the team might need. Life Orb can be used if Kangaskhan needs to change moves to keep momentum on its side, but a loss of 10% of its max HP each time it attacks is a downer. Victini makes an excellent partner for Kangaskhan, with its good bulk, resistance to Fighting-type attacks, and ability to take on Rock- and Steel types with Grass Knot and V-create, respectively.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Luckily Kangaskhan was blessed with the perfect moves and qualities of a SubPuncher. The ability to create 101 HP Substitutes, perfect coverage between Focus Punch and Return, and a priority move in Sucker Punch tick all the boxes when it comes to a SubPuncher. Substitute and Focus Punch are the foundation of the strategy. Switch into something that doesn't threaten you, use Substitute on the switch, and then Focus Punch. Return is there just in case you can't use Focus Punch, while Sucker Punch is for priority, which is nice to have on the set. The SubPunch set has great potential, as it can 2HKO many common UU threats, making it difficult for them to remove Kangaskhan's Substitute without getting KOed.</p> <p>Due to the lack of Attack investment, physical walls with reliable recovery, such as Tangrowth and Slowbro, can beat Kangaskhan, especially due to Regenerator and strong STAB attacks. The Speed EVs allow Kangaskhan to outspeed max Speed base 55 Pokemon and uninvested Rotom. If you need to increase Kangaskhan's Speed, a spread of 212 HP / 120 Atk / 176 Spe with a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon. However, this Speed tier is no longer as important as it was in DPP, and Kangaskhan will have a hard time beating many faster opponents. Double-Edge can be used over Return to hit Kangaskhan's switch-ins harder. Expert Belt can be used to fake a Choice Band in order to lure in Steel-types, and then dispose of them with a well-timed Focus Punch, clearing the way for a teammate to sweep. However, this strategy is unreliable, and should not be trusted completely.</p> "

  "Scyther": {
    "overview": "<p>Ever since the introduction of Scizor in GSC, Scyther has been living in the shadows of its evolution. In times since, Scyther has been penalized first by its lack of bulk, and then by the introduction of Stealth Rock, which strips away half of its health just for entering the battlefield. Even the blessing of Technician went mostly unnoticed. However, while Generation V did not bring Scizor anything of offensive value, it gave Scyther Eviolite. With this new item, Scyther attains higher defenses than its evolution. Despite this, Scyther is still relegated to UU due to its poor typing, lack of a powerful coverage or STAB priority move, and the need to rely on Eviolite to be defensive--not to mention that it still loses half of its health when switching in to Stealth Rock. Despite these flaws, its base 110 Attack, base 105 Speed, Technician, and Eviolite allow Scyther to perform many different roles, making it a viable choice in UU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scyther has many viable options to choose from, but they are usually outclassed. Pursuit can be used in tandem with Brick Break for almost perfect coverage, but this is not recommended, as Scyther does not like losing out on a STAB attack. Night Slash might have more power than Pursuit, but Pursuit is preferred for its ability to punish switches. Technician-boosted Double Hit can break through Focus Sash, Sturdy, and Substitute, but it lacks coverage and priority, making it very situational. Agility can be used to boost Scyther's already stellar Speed, but Scyther prefers the Attack boost granted by Swords Dance. Using Agility and Swords Dance together requires too much setup time, and makes Scyther's four moveslot syndrome even worse. A set utilizing Focus Sash, Reversal, and Swords Dance is quite powerful; however, with the abundance of weather, Stealth Rock, and priority, it is not such a good idea. An Adamant nature can be used to boost Scyther's Attack, but it prefers Jolly due to the demand of Speed this generation.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>With a 4x Rock weakness, Scyther will inevitably fall if Stealth Rock is floating in the fray. That said, Rock-type moves in general usually KO Scyther in one hit. Locking Scyther into Swords Dance through Encore or Trick can easily shut it down, but be careful of giving the Swords Dance sweeper variety a Choice Scarf--it can then perform like the Choice set.</p> <p>For specific Pokemon, Cofagrigus has amazing physical bulk, access to Will-O-Wisp, and the ability Mummy, all of which can shut down Scyther. Rotom, Rotom-S, and Zapdos resist Fighting-, Flying-, and Bug-type moves, and can hit Scyther with STAB Electric-type attacks. Raikou is in this boat as well, and can outrun Scyther. It should be noted that a 252 Speed event Raikou with Aura Sphere is still slower than Jolly Scyther with 252 Speed EVs. Sharpedo is another solid check--after using Protect, it is faster than Scyther thanks to Speed Boost.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>While most sweeping sets attempt to boost a maximized Attack to astronomical levels, with the goal of overpowering opponents after one turn of setup, this set plays a bit differently. The objective here is to attain multiple boosts. Eviolite, along with the HP investment, makes Scyther quite hard to bring down, allowing it to use Swords Dance multiple times, after which it can use Roost to recover health. Another approach is to bring Scyther into something nonthreatening and set up. Roost, unlike the case for other Flying-types with access to the move, is hardly disadvantageous for Scyther. Grounding the mantis adds no new weaknesses, instead removing Ice- and Electric-type weaknesses, as well as lessening the Rock-type weakness. Aerial Ace is the primary attack, as STAB and Technician boost its Base Power to 135. Brick Break is used for coverage, and has a handy side effect of breaking screens. Watch out for Rotom, Rotom-S, and Zapdos, however, as they all resist both Aerial Ace and Brick Break.</p> <p>Eviolite gives Scyther 294 in both defenses, making the item vital to this set. With the given EV spread, Scyther's HP hits 335 (one less than a multiple of 16)--a magic HP number that allows Scyther to survive two switches into Stealth Rock and / or an extra turn of weather damage. In conjunction with Roost, this increased bulk allows Scyther to attain more boosts. Maximum Speed of 339 is mandatory to take advantage of Scyther's speed tier, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into Attack, which reaches 528 after a Swords Dance. Some of the EVs can be allotted into defenses, but the mantis would lose vital speed or end up more vulnerable to passive damage.</p> <p>Bug Bite is an option for an additional STAB move; this does, however, give worse coverage, making it less effective. Substitute can block status, but Scyther loses either coverage or recovery this way. Taunt and Encore both ruin this set. Scyther also hates Trick, as Eviolite is the only thing that makes it moderately bulky. Despite its bulk, Rapid Spin support is greatly appreciated to get rid of Stealth Rock. Hitmontop is great in this regard, resisting Scyther's crippling Rock-type weakness.</p> "

Jolly works well with Swords Dance, boasting 339 Speed and 319 Attack (which hits 638 after a Swords Dance) and allowing Scyther to hit extremely hard. Aerial Ace is the main attack and is a reliable STAB move, while Brick Break provides good coverage to hit Steel-types that resist Aerial Ace such as Registeel. Bug Bite provides another powerful STAB attack, hitting opponents such as Rotom-C harder than Aerial Ace would.</p> <p>Quick Attack is a viable option for a priority move, as it provides insurance against being revenge killed, and hits hard after a Swords Dance. Entry hazard support is appreciated for securing KOs, and the ridding of Stealth Rock on your side of the field prevents it from crippling Scyther upon each switch in. Hitmontop is an exceptional partner for Rapid Spin support, as it has resistances to most of Scyther's weaknesses and is good at dealing with its counters. For example, Hitmontop easily break through most steal types with a timely Close Combat. You should always make sure that Scyther's HP stat is odd so it can survive two switches into Stealth Rock; this is the reason that the 4 remaining EVs are allotted to Defense instead of HP.

On top of that, Jynx has always been overshadowed by other Psychic-type Pokemon such as Alakazam, even with its great Special Attack stat, and this generation is no different. UU's newest additions bring about even more Psychic-type Pokemon that outclass Jynx in some way, including Mew and Azelf. Both are faster than Jynx, while Mew is bulkier, and Azelf hits much harder. Jynx is weak to Stealth Rock as well, but it has some things up its sleeve that the aforementioned Pokemon don't: Lovely Kiss, a sleep-inducing move. With Lovely Kiss, Jynx has a much easier time setting up Nasty Plot or Calm Mind while its opponent is sleeping, making it a great late-game sweeper.</p> <p>Jynx also received a new ability this generation: Dry Skin.

    "overview": "<p>Ditto has always been deemed a gimmick, ever since its RBY days. The same went for the start of Generation V, where the same old Ditto was never competitively viable. Then came the shift to BW2, and with it came a new ability for Ditto, a saving grace that would bring it from the lowest depths of NU: Imposter. Imposter transforms Ditto upon switch in, allowing it to avoid wasting a turn using Transform. This ability is what launched Ditto from a useless gimmick into a ruthless revenge killer. Ditto is a setup sweeper's worst nightmare, and when equipped with a Choice Scarf, it can outspeed and kill almost everything in UU, provided it can switch in with minimal damage.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ditto has no other options. The only aspect worth changing would be the IV spread, which helps target different users of Hidden Power on the switch in. Below is a list of Hidden Power users and the best IV spreads for beating them.</p> <ul> <li>Raikou: 31 HP / 31 Atk / 31 Def / 30 SpA / 30 SpD / 3 Spe [Lowest Speed Possible w/ Base 70] Hidden Power Ground (51.71 - 61.05%) -- guaranteed 2HKO</li> <li>Zapdos: N/A, Thunderbolt (66.66 - 78.5%) -- guaranteed 2HKO (Hits for slightly less damage than Hidden Power Ice or Rock)</li> <li>Lilligant: 31 HP / 31 Atk / 31 Def / 31 SpA / 31 SpD / 2 Spe [Lowest Speed Possible w/ Base 70] Hidden Power Ice (87.23 - 102.83%) -- 18.75% chance to OHKO</li> <li>Shaymin: (Air Slash is more common than Hidden Power) 31 HP / 31 Atk / 31 Def / 31 SpA / 31 SpD / 2 Spe [Lowest Speed Possible w/ Base 70] Hidden Power Ice (48.53 - 57.3%) -- 94.14% chance to 2HKO</li> </ul> <p>The above IV Spread for Hidden Power Ice is probably the best alternative if your team is worried about Lilligant and Shaymin. That being said, Raikou is much more commonly seen with Hidden Power than the Grass duo, so Hidden Power Ground is probably the best way to go. Theoretically, the item on the set could be changed, but this is usually ineffective because Ditto will always be relying on a Speed tie and outright losing to Choice Scarf users.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because Ditto is ever-changing, there is no true counter to it. Choice Scarf users are probably the biggest check because Ditto relies on being faster than the opponent to get a revenge kill; Choice Scarf users will always create a Speed tie, only allowing Ditto to do its job 50% of the time. Imposter will fail if the opponent has a Substitute, making users of said move obvious checks; of course, the Substitute must be set up before Ditto switches in. If not, Ditto can just outspeed and attack before the move is used. Ditto is also largely susceptible to entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes. Ditto will be switching in and out a lot and thus taking lots of entry hazard damage. This makes Ditto slightly less effective against teams that stack entry hazards.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Taking revenge on anyone who ever deemed it useless, Ditto takes its new Dream World ability to become a potent revenge killer. Armed with a Choice Scarf, Ditto can come in, outspeed, and kill almost anything, bar Substitute users and Zoroark. Any boosting sweepers must think twice if they see Ditto on the opposing team, because after they grab some boosts and a kill, Ditto can come in and not only pocket a revenge kill, but also steal the boost and turn the sweep around. For example, Ditto can steal boosts from the likes of Dragon Dance Kingdra, Dragon Dance Scrafty, Swords Dance Heracross, Nasty Plot Houndoom, and Nasty Plot Azelf, even after a single kill. Its sweeping potential doesn't stop there--Ditto can switch in and threaten a range of Life Orb attackers. Outside of its great revenge killing capabilities, Ditto can also steal entry hazards and further support moves from the opponent. Ditto can switch into the likes of Bronzong, Gligar, and Roserade and set up Stealth Rock or Spikes--although this locks Ditto into an entry hazard move, it can prove to be incredibly useful in the long run. This is obviously the only moveset that Ditto can run, but it doesn't need to worry about its own movepool because it will be using someone else's moves all of the time anyway.</p> <p>Because Ditto copies its opponent's stats (bar HP), it seems odd to put much thought into EV and IV spreads. They do have a purpose, however, as HP is the only stat not copied when Imposter takes effect and thus is maxed out. The remaining EVs only matter in one situation: Ditto switching in on Zoroark. Although this should never happen, Ditto still wants to have maxed Special Defense in case it needs to take a hit. The only effect of Ditto's IVs after Imposter takes effect is the type of its Hidden Power. This IV spread is chosen because it changes Hidden Power to a Ground-type move. This is useful in UU because there are two main users of Hidden Power: Raikou and Zapdos. Hidden Power Ground is Ditto's only way of getting past Raikou, and Zapdos is hit harder by its own Thunderbolt than any type of Hidden Power. 3 Speed IVs are are given to ensure the Base Power of Hidden Power is 70, while obtaining the lowest Speed possible. This is done for the only situation it could effect, Ditto vs. Ditto. In this situation, the faster Ditto loses because it runs out of PP first. Sassy is the nature of choice because it makes Ditto even slower and helps it take a hit from Zoroark. As for teammates, Ditto doesn't affect a team's synergy, so its team options are extremely varied. For any team that enjoys having a good revenge killer, is having trouble with setup sweepers, and has a free spot synergy wise, Ditto is a good teammate. Also, Ditto's ability to transform into the opponent's Stealth Rock user eliminates the need for a Stealth Rock user of your own. This can be a great help to free up teamslots.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its high Special Attack stat, Omastar has always been a decent Rain Dance sweeper; however, it is let down by its poor Speed and many weaknesses courtesy of its secondary Rock typing. For these reasons, Omastar was more often used as a hazard setter; it is one of the few Pokemon with access to all three of Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. BW, though, has blessed Omastar with one of the best setup moves in the entire game--Shell Smash. A move that sharply raises Attack, Special Attack, and Speed, Shell Smash was distributed to only a few select users, among whom Omastar is one of the best, because of its excellent Special Attack. Shell Smash also patches up any Speed issues that Omastar previously had, making this shellfish one of the most threatening sweepers around.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Earth Power is another option for coverage, but is somewhat redundant with Omastar's other moves. Ancient Power is Omastar's only viable secondary special STAB, but is weak, has low PP, and also provides redundant coverage. Haze is an option on the support set, but such a move is better left to Pokemon such as Milotic, which has access to instant recovery. Chople Berry prevents TechniTop's Mach Punch from OHKOing Shell Smash Omastar after a Defense drop, but it is usually not worth the drop in power. Knock Off is a great option on the support set to ruin Pokemon highly dependent on their items. Finally, Omastar receives Weak Armor from the Dream World, but it is highly situational, and Shell Armor or Swift Swim is much better in almost every single instance.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to Omastar's fantastic offensive capabilities, Empoleon is the only opponent that can actually wall it. While even Empoleon must watch out for the rare Hidden Power Electric, specially defensive variants can survive a +2 Hidden Power Electric and KO back with Grass Knot. However, Empoleon cannot directly switch into +2 Hidden Power Electric. Hidden Power Grass Milotic can survive a boosted, super effective Hidden Power and KO back, but it is a risky check at best: as it might be 2HKOed after Stealth Rock, it cannot directly switch into a super effective Hidden Power. Faster Choice Scarf users and priority users, such as Raikou and Hitmontop, can easily take Omastar out, as they either outspeed Omastar even after a boost, or completely bypass its Speed with priority.</p> ",

Hydro Pump is the preferred STAB move, as it puts absolutely massive dents in anything that doesn't resist it. Surf is a reliable alternative with less power but perfect accuracy and more PP. Ice Beam is a great coverage move and hits Grass-types hard, especially after a boost. The final move should be Hidden Power Grass, which hits other Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic, as well as Water Absorb Quagsire, who is immune to Water-type attacks.</p> <p>Life Orb is crucial to gain certain KOs, but Leftovers can be used for some passive recovery. White Herb is an option to eliminate the negative defensive drops (TechniTop's Mach Punch never OHKOes a full health Omastar without the Defense drop), but, again, Omastar loses a significant amount of power. The EV spread is standard: maximize Special Attack and Speed and use either a Timid or a Modest nature. However, an alternative spread with some HP EVs can be used to give Omastar a bit more bulk, as its base 115 Defense is quite good. A Modest nature is the preferred option to provide the most power, but a Timid nature allows +2 Omastar to outspeed neutral base 100 Speed Choice Scarf users, such as Flygon and Victini. Hidden Power Electric hits Empoleon harder than Hidden Power Grass does; however, specially defensive Empoleon always survives +2 Hidden Power Electric and can KO back with Hidden Power Grass.

Scald is a STAB move with a nice 30% chance to burn, crippling all physical attackers except for those with the Guts ability. Ice Beam is the primary move in the last moveslot to discourage Grass-types from wantonly switching in.</p> <p>The given EV spread and nature provides a Leftovers number and maximizes Omastar's Defense stat. As Choice Scarf Victini's Fusion Bolt fails to 2HKO Omastar, Omastar can either set up more entry hazards or do major damage with Scald. Surf is an option over Scald as a more powerful STAB move, but Omastar sorely misses Scald's ability to burn and cripple physical attackers. Shell Armor is the preferred ability to prevent annoying critical hits, as Swift Swim has little merit on a support set.</p> <p>Omastar's low Speed leaves it very susceptible to Taunt, so it is better suited to laying hazards mid-game rather than early-game. Therefore, a Mental Herb is a good option to deflect Taunt and allow Omastar to set up more easily. Alternatively, a fast Taunt user of your own can also aid Omastar in setting up entry hazards. Mew has access to Taunt and Will-O-Wisp to easily shut down the opposing team's supporting Pokemon, paving the way for Omastar to set up its own hazards.</p> <p>Despite Omastar's great Defense stat, it will still fall easily to special Grass- and Electric-type attacks; teammates that can sponge these attacks, such as Roserade and Shaymin, are much appreciated.

    "overview": "<p>Kabutops returns to UU as a solid Pokemon with decent Attack and Defense stats relative to the rest of the tier. Access to Swords Dance and powerful dual STABs only increases its value, turning it into a fearsome sweeper. Alternatively, it can take on a more support-oriented role, using Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin to help its team. Its Rock / Water typing is a mixed blessing here: on one hand, a 4x resistance to Fire-type moves, particularly V-create and Flare Blitz, makes it a great check to Victini and Arcanine. This also helps since Fire-type powerhouses such as Darmanitan dropped into the UU tier. However, this typing leaves it with crippling weaknesses to common Ground-, Grass-, and Fighting-type attacks, and Kabutops's below average Special Defense compounds this issue further. Negatives aside, if you need an offensive force or a support Pokemon that also packs an attacking punch, look no further than Kabutops.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aqua Tail is an option over Waterfall for extra power at the cost of accuracy, but attains no significant KOs regardless of whether Kabutops has obtained a Swords Dance or not. X-Scissor is an option to hit Grass-types harder, but most have an additional Poison typing and therefore take more from Stone Edge. Kabutops should be switching out of Grass-type Pokemon anyway. Superpower is a very powerful move that gives Kabutops excellent coverage, but the Attack and Defense drops are unappealing, especially given Kabutops's decent Defense. Low Kick too is really only useful to hit Bisharp, Empoleon, and Ferroseed harder. Return can hit Quagsire for neutral damage and retains general coverage, but Stone Edge is generally better since it hits most other threats harder. Knock Off has only situational usage in removing Eviolite; it is generally better to just hammer away at such Pokemon. Hone Claws could boost the accuracy of Aqua Tail and Stone Edge, but Swords Dance Waterfall will outdamage both. Battle Armor is an interesting ability, but without any way to boost defenses or reliable recovery, the insurance against critical hits is unneeded. Kabutops can run both Swords Dance and Rapid Spin on the same set to play the role of both sweeper and supporter, but spinning will be easier if you use a dedicated Rapid Spin set, sweeping will be easier if you run a dedicated sweeping set, and it will be a miracle if Kabutops can pull off both roles in one game.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Water Absorb Quagsire, Empoleon, Ferroseed, and Poliwrath resist or are immune to Kabutops's STAB moves. Quagsire ignores Swords Dance boosts if it has Unaware, and physically defensive variants shake off Waterfall with ease. It can also threaten Kabutops with a burn from Scald or attack it with a super effective Earthquake. Empoleon with Hidden Power Grass or Grass Knot decimate Kabutops, but must watch out for Low Kick or Superpower. Poliwrath, while uncommon, walls Kabutops cold while threatening a KO with STAB Fighting-type moves.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Slowbro, and Suicune wall Kabutops as well, shaking off Stone Edge and either phazing or potentially burning with Scald. Repeated Stone Edges from a boosted Kabutops will hurt, though. Bulky Grass-types are especially troublesome; defensive Shaymin takes little from Stone Edge and OHKOes easily with its STAB attacks. Fighting-types such as Hitmontop are bulky enough to sponge Waterfall and can KO with Close Combat or another STAB move. While bulky Ground-types such as Rhyperior can take a Waterfall or two and retaliate with Earthquake, they are unable to continually tank Kabutops's Water-type assaults, particularly in the rain. Since Kabutops is rather slow outside of rain, it is very prone to being revenge killed. Zapdos and Raikou outspeed Kabutops by a large margin and maim the shellfish with their Electric-type moves, while also having the ability to scout with Volt Switch.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on using rain support and Swords Dance to double Kabutops's Speed and Attack stats, allowing it to easily tear apart unprepared teams with its great dual STAB. Waterfall is the most reliable Water-type move in its arsenal, hitting a wide range of threats hard after the Swords Dance and rain boosts. Stone Edge allows Kabutops to hit opposing Water-, Grass-, and Dragon-types that resist Waterfall for neutral damage. This combo is enough to dent everything except Ferroseed and Quagsire, both of which tank the Water / Rock offensive combination with ease. Aqua Jet earns a place in the last slot for a variety of reasons: even if it is raining, Kabutops can circumvent its low Speed and attempt a late-game sweep as long as it has already nabbed a Swords Dance boost. The priority is also good insurance against revenge killing, allowing Kabutops to hit opponents hard before they can attack. Be sure to remember the power difference between Aqua Jet and Waterfall, however, and resist the urge to use it in situations where Kabutops comfortably outspeeds its opponent.</p> <p>The EVs provide the maximum Speed possible, as chances are you may occasionally need Kabutops outside of rain. Its base 80 Speed is usable, tying with other base 80s such as Togekiss. 252 Attack EVs ensure Kabutops will hit as hard as possible, both before and after a Swords Dance boost. The choice of a Jolly or Adamant nature is clear with rain support: Adamant for maximum power, while Jolly is viable if you want extra insurance outside of rain, outpacing Adamant Heracross and standard Arcanine. If you don't intend to provide Kabutops with rain support, an EV spread of 72 HP / 252 Atk / 184 Spe with Weak Armor is certainly viable, as after being hit by a physical move, Kabutops will be able to outspeed notable threats such as Zapdos and Mew and KO them (though some prior damage may be required). Such an approach is less favorable, however, both because it is situational and the fact that Kabutops is frail.</p> <p>Pokemon that set up Rain Dance are the primary teammates for Kabutops, as the rain boosts both its power and Speed. Accelgor is a great partner in this regard, as it has an extremely fast Rain Dance and resists the Grass-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves that Kabutops is weak to. Furthermore, the ninja bug can use U-turn to gain momentum for Kabutops to take advantage of. Amoonguss is another great choice, as it 4x resists Grass-type moves and has its Fire-type weakness covered by Kabutops. It is also bulky enough to set up Rain Dance multiple times, benefits from the rain by having the aforementioned Fire-type weakness removed, and has Spore to do one of two things: put the opponent to sleep and set up Rain Dance safely, or summon the storms first, sleep the opponent, and give Kabutops a free switch-in. Offensively, Kingdra is a good partner, as it can smash holes in the opponent's team with its own powerful dual STAB and clear the way for Kabutops to sweep. Ludicolo gets a mention too, as it eliminates most of the physical walls that Kabutops has trouble getting past with its powerful special attacks. To get an idea of how fearsome Kabutops is in the rain, take the following into account: Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin, which originally outspeed and KO Kabutops, are swiftly KOed by a +2 Adamant Life Orb Stone Edge. Unaware Quagsire with a physically defensive spread is KOed by Adamant Life Orb- and rain-boosted Waterfall as well, and cannot damage Kabutops significantly, even with Earthquake. Hitmontop takes 93.8% - 110.5% from a +1 (after Intimidate) Adamant Life Orb Waterfall, and is hardly strong enough to KO with Mach Punch alone.</p> <p>Unaware Quagsire and Water Absorb variants (if Kabutops doesn't have a boost already) are some of the best counters to Kabutops as long as there is no rain; physically defensive versions will laugh at Stone Edge and Waterfall. Roserade is therefore a good partner, as it can set up Spikes to ease Kabutops's KOs and eliminate Quagsire with its STAB Grass-type attacks. It also has decent synergy with Kabutops, 4x resisting the Grass-type moves directed at the shellfish while Kabutops can take the Flying- and Fire-type attacks directed at Roserade. That said, opposing Grass-types, especially bulky ones such as Shaymin and Ferroseed, are troubling. They take little damage from either of Kabutops's STABs, and set up on or force Kabutops out. If you aren't using rain support, strong Fire-types such as Arcanine and Rotom-H are good for taking these out. Otherwise, strong Ice-types, such as Weavile, and Flying-types, such as Crobat, are better choices. These partners (bar Rotom-H) will in turn leave you walled by most bulky Water-types, so Electric-types such as Zapdos and Raikou are useful teammates as well. The ability to scout with Volt Switch is especially helpful, as it seizes the momentum and augments Kabutops's offensive pressure.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Although a support set may seem odd for a Pokemon with such excellent offenses, Kabutops has all the tools needed to successfully pull it off. While its Rock / Water typing leaves it susceptible to Grass-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks, Kabutops does have useful resistances to Fire-, Ice-, and Flying-type moves. The 4x Fire-type resistance is especially helpful when dealing with Arcanine and Victini, two prominent physical threats in UU. Kabutops also provides further team support by spinning away hazards or setting up Stealth Rock, and has some key advantages over other users of this combo, such as Claydol, which has practically no offensive presence and thus becomes easy set-up fodder for spinblockers such as Mismagius. Kabutops can hammer Mismagius on the switch with Waterfall and KO it with Aqua Jet, taking advantage of its poor Defense and also outspeeding its Substitutes or attacks. It must be mentioned though that Kabutops will rarely be able to run both Waterfall and Aqua Jet on this set, as it badly needs the additional coverage offered by Stone Edge or Rock Slide. Water-type STAB is also helpful for hitting Golurk, whose partial Ground typing ensures that it won't enjoy the super effective move. Stone Edge is another offensive option for Kabutops, eliminating the Flying- and Ice-types that may get in the way, but its accuracy may prove disappointing; Rock Slide is a viable alternative, though the power drop is significant.</p> <p>Since Kabutops has a Fighting weakness, Pokemon that resist it, such as Gligar, make great partners. Unfortunately, Kabutops and Gligar share a Grass-type weakness, so Pokemon such as Roserade are good partners. Roserade also provides Spikes support, which complements Kabutops's Stealth Rock nicely. Offensive versions of Shaymin are also good partners, as they will appreciate hazard support and resist Grass-type moves. Since Hitmontop spins away Stealth Rock and threatens Kabutops with STAB Fighting-type moves, offensive Psychic-types such as Azelf are good partners. They must watch out for Sucker Punch, however.</p> <p>The EV spread is rather specialized: 68 Attack EVs ensure that Kabutops OHKOes Victini (and, by extension, non-Intimidate Arcanine) with Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage, while the defensive investment allows it to comfortably survive both a Life Orb Fusion Bolt and a Life Orb Close Combat from Victini and Arcanine, respectively. This makes Kabutops a great check to these Fire-types, as it resists their primary STAB move and will not fall easily to their coverage moves. Speed EVs are certainly viable, but hardly any Pokemon that outspeed Kabutops threaten it, and such a change would take away from Kabutops's bulk. The ability is a toss-up, but also a relatively unimportant issue. Swift Swim takes advantage of opposing Rain Dance teams, while Battle Armor is useful to prevent critical hits, but such an ability is not particularly useful on Kabutops, which can neither boost its defenses nor recover HP.</p> "

This is the main draw of Aerodactyl, outspeeding threats, such as Tornadus, +1 Scrafty, and non-Ice Shard Weavile, among others, and inflicting damage before they can move. Aerodactyl can either set up Stealth Rock almost guaranteed or hit its opponents hard depending on the set. However, the UU metagame is cruel to Aerodactyl, being filled with bulky Water-types and priority moves, both of which Aerodactyl struggles with, and its mediocre bulk makes it unable to take many hits. Despite these crippling flaws, Aerodactyl is still a very useful Pokemon to have in UU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aerodactyl has a decent movepool, but many of its other moves are not worth using due to its inferior defenses. One offensive move to consider is Fire Fang to hit Escavalier and Bronzong hard, though it is too weak to put much of a dent in anything else. Another is Rock Slide for better accuracy than Stone Edge, but it is significantly weaker and Aerodactyl needs all the power it can get. Hone Claws is the only way Aerodactyl can boost its Attack and fixes Stone Edge's unreliable accuracy, but a +1 boost isn't enough for Aerodactyl to sweep, especially considering it is hard for Aerodactyl to get a free turn because of its frailty. Aerodactyl can cripple walls, such as Swampert, with Toxic, but a large amount of prediction is needed for Aerodactyl to not end up fainting in the process, and most Pokemon that wall Aerodactyl are Steel-types that are immune to Toxic. Tailwind can be used, but Aerodactyl is so fast that it really doesn't need a boost and is too frail to set up repeatedly for its team. Finally, there is the combination of a Power Herb and Sky Attack, which unleashes the only decently powerful Flying-type move in Aerodactyl's moveset, being over twice as powerful as Aerial Ace. However, this is generally too gimmicky to make use of.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As far as preventing Stealth Rock, there is really no point in trying because Aerodactyl is so fast unless you have Sableye, as its Prankster lets it use Taunt before Aerodactyl can do anything. Bronzong is hands-down the best counter, resisting almost everything Aerodactyl can throw at it and is able to OHKO with Gyro Ball. Swampert is similar because it can also OHKO Aerodactyl and resists Stone Edge, but other attacks, when boosted by a Choice Band, do hurt quite a bit. Other bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Slowbro, are annoyed by Taunt, but Scald does a ton of damage to Aerodactyl, and if it burns Aerodactyl it is pretty much down for the count. Azumarill has the bulk to take a hit and can OHKO Aerodactyl with Aqua Jet before it can retaliate. Cofagrigus has excellent physical bulk and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp or use Trick Room to turn Aerodactyl's Speed into a liability. Registeel can take an Earthquake pretty well, paralyze it, and hit it hard with Iron Head. Finally, many Pokemon that wield a Choice Scarf are capable of revenge killing it. These Pokemon include Heracross and Victini, both of which can OHKO Aerodactyl with the proper move.</p> ",

Aerodactyl is the fastest Pokemon in UU that has access to Stealth Rock, which almost guarantees the valuable hazard will be set up every battle. This makes it very useful on offensive teams that need to get Stealth Rock up immediately so the team has the residual damage needed to secure many OHKOs and 2HKOs.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's great coverage comes in the form of EdgeQuake, which has almost perfect neutral coverage in UU. Stone Edge, the first move of the combo, receives a STAB boost, which makes it very powerful if it doesn't miss. Because of the excellent coverage achieved with just two moves, Aerodactyl has room to run another non-attacking move. Because Aerodactyl is very fast, it can reliably prevent other Pokemon from setting up their own entry hazards with Taunt, as well as prevent Pokemon like Roserade from hitting Aerodactyl with a crippling status move. If Taunt isn't needed, then Roost is a suitable replacement because it can heal off Life Orb damage so that Aerodactyl can continue to attack without killing itself.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Aerodactyl's offensive capabilities. Another viable EV spread is 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe with a Jolly Nature, which outspeeds unboosted Raikou and Azelf while giving Aerodactyl some bulk. However, losing out on outspeeding Weavile, Crobat, and opposing Aerodactyl might not be worth the increase in bulk. If something else on your team is running Stealth Rock, then Taunt and Roost can be used together, but at that point Crobat is usually a better option to use due to its superior bulk and defensive typing, which grants it extra resistances, notably a 4x one to Fighting-type moves.</p> <p>While the BW metagame doesn't have many dedicated leads, Aerodactyl can still function in that position and set up Stealth Rock on the first turn easily. If Aerodactyl is being used exclusively in this position, Focus Sash is a viable option to guarantee that Aerodactyl will get Stealth Rock up and be able to use Taunt to ensure that Pokemon, such as Roserade, will be unable to set their entry hazards up simultaneously. If Stealth Rock is absolutely critical for your team to function, Ghost-types, such as Sableye and Cofagrigus, are useful to prevent it from being spun away. Aerodactyl struggles with bulky Water-types, so Roserade and Shaymin are the best options to combat them, as they shrug off Scalds and have Natural Cure in case they are burned. In addition, when using Aerodactyl, take time during Team Preview to look for priority users, especially those whose moves deal super effective damage, such as Weavile and Azumarill; if you see one such Pokemon, it might be a good idea to keep Aerodactyl out of the lead position, as these Pokemon can OHKO Aerodactyl before it can even move if it doesn't have a Focus Sash.</p> "

        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Band, Aerodactyl reaches a high Attack stat of 463, which allows it to power through most of the UU tier. This, along with its blistering speed stat, allows Aerodactyl to do some serious damage. Despite this, Aerodactyl must be played with caution; with a Stealth Rock weakness, there is little room for error, so you must predict well in order for this set to be effective.</p> <p>Stone Edge is the powerful STAB move of choice; it is notable for OHKOing some of the biggest threats in UU, such as Crobat, Weavile, Tornadus, and Azelf, all of which Aerodactyl outspeeds. Earthquake has excellent coverage with Stone Edge, allowing Aerodactyl to hit most of the tier for neutral damage or better. Aqua Tail is Aerodactyl's best option against Ground-type Pokemon, such as Rhyperior and Krookodile, which can otherwise cause problems for Aerodactyl. Finally, Double-Edge is chosen for the last slot to hit Swampert and Flygon hard, as well as OHKO Mienshao. Thanks to Rock Head, Aerodactyl also suffers no recoil damage from the move.</p> <p>As tempting as it may be to run an Adamant nature, Jolly is needed to outspeed Weavile, Raikou, and Azelf, all of which Aerodactyl can OHKO with Jolly regardless. Aerial Ace is normally weak with only 60 Base Power, but thanks to STAB, it gets boosted to acceptable levels and can OHKO Heracross, Virizion, and Shaymin after Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil, as well as uninvested Scrafty after a layer of Spikes. Ice Fang is also usable to OHKO Flygon and 2HKO Gligar which are otherwise difficult to deal with. However, these are mainly situational moves, and Aerodactyl's standard moves will generally be more useful.</p> <p>Aerodactyl needs Rapid Spin support to function at its best, as it will be switching out a lot and has a Stealth Rock weakness. The best option is Hitmontop, as it resists Rock-type moves that are often aimed at Aerodactyl. Bulky Water-types are troublesome for Aerodactyl, especially those that resist Rock-type moves, such as Empoleon and Swampert, meaning that Grass-types, such as Shaymin and Tangrowth, are good partners, as they can take them down easily. In addition, Steel-types resist Stone Edge, and one of the most prominent—Bronzong—is immune to Earthquake. Fire-type Pokemon, such as Darmanitan and Victini, can destroy Steel-types with their STAB, which allows Stone Edge to be used more freely.</p> "

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Once the King of GSC OU, Snorlax took quite a few hits with each subsequent generation, finally dropping to UU along with long-time fellow OU Pokemon, Zapdos, in BW. With the rising popularity of Fighting-types, it struggles to maintain a big presence on the battlefield. Furthermore, lack of reliable recovery really hurts its durability—especially with the BW sleep mechanics. However, its amazing HP stat and great special bulk make it one of the few able to reliably check a complete offensive spectrum, taking on special powerhouses such as Nidoking or Zapdos. Snorlax is also one of the most trustworthy answers to Victini, one of the biggest threats in the metagame. With its good base 110 Attack stat, it can keep offensive pressure with ease, be it with a Choice Band or by setting up with its old Curse set.</p> <p>Taking everything previously stated into account, Snorlax continues to be a great addition to any team, countering specific prominent threats, such as Offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus or Substitute+Calm Mind Raikou, very aptly. Even though it's much less metagame-defining than it once was, it can take credit for being a staple of the Underused metagame and one of the most used Pokemon overall.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of the moves listed, Snorlax has other options it can run. It can use Rest + three attacks with Chesto Berry for instant recovery, or Belly Drum to mimic its old offensive set from GSC with two attacking moves and Rest, although neither option help it much, and the huge boost isn't worth losing half its health—especially considering Snorlax usually takes two hits before moving. Every set can run either one of Double-Edge, Return, or Body Slam as a STAB move, but each has one that goes better with Snorlax's purpose. As coverage options, it learns Seed Bomb, Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, Wild Charge, and Superpower, each nailing a different Pokemon. Snorlax also has a good special movepool, with Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, and Blizzard, for example, but its low Special Attack means it's unable to put them to good use. Finally, it has borderline-viable support moves in Toxic, Counter, Yawn, and Stockpile to aid its teammates.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While straight-out countering Snorlax isn't an easy task, Rhyperior is the closest to that position as long as Snorlax isn't running Seed Bomb, since Rhyperior doesn't mind the paralysis and doesn't take much from unboosted Earthquakes, hitting back hard with its own STAB Earthquakes. Rhyperior can also phaze Curse variants, although that isn't as reliable in the lategame. Fighting-types such as Cobalion and Heracross can switch in on some sets, but neither enjoy being paralyzed and they are hit hard by Snorlax's offensive sets. Shed Skin Scrafty doesn't mind paralysis and can set up on Snorlax, but it doesn't enjoy taking STAB Returns and it can't beat Snorlax if Scrafty switched in while it used Curse. Bulky Intimidate Scrafty, on the other hand, can even switch into Choice Band-boosted Returns and force Snorlax out, though it won't enjoy getting paralyzed by Body Slam variants. Cofagrigus needs to avoid Crunch, but can otherwise set up alongside it with Nasty Plot or Calm Mind and hit it with Hidden Power Fighting, moving first if Snorlax uses Curse. Defensive Cofagrigus can't directly harm it, but it can beat Curse variants with a combination of Will-O-Wisp and Haze, disrupting a possible sweep.</p> <p>Tricking a Choice Specs or a Choice Scarf is generally a good way of dealing with Snorlax, since only the offensive sets don't mind being locked into a move. Rotom-H and Victini are good lures for it, though the latter needs to worry about Pursuit on the way out. Those two can also lure Snorlax and use Will-O-Wisp, which can mean the end for Snorlax if it doesn't have Rest. Stallbreakers such as Mew, Crobat, and Mismagius can make short work of non-Offensive Snorlax with Taunt, preventing it from using Rest and Curse. However, they can't directly switch in without knowing the sets, since Return and Crunch, respectively, hit them hard.</p> <p>Finally, submitting Snorlax to much offensive pressure is generally a good option, since non-Rest variants become unable to stop Zapdos and Raikou, and Rest variants can be taken advantage of while asleep. Strong special attackers like Nidoking or Choice Specs Yanmega usually do a great job of wearing Snorlax down. Incoming switches need to be wary of Sleep Talk, though.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Offensive Snorlax is very useful on offensive teams, being able to switch into many special attackers and hit back hard thanks to its fully invested base 110 Attack stat. Return is the main option for a STAB move, being able to hit Pokemon such as Shaymin and Zapdos hard; Body Slam is an alternative due to the added paralysis chance, but its damage output makes it the lesser choice. Pursuit is arguably the draw of the set, allowing Snorlax to remove the Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon—Victini being the most notable target, since it fears Earthquake—that it forces out, possibly opening up a path for a partner to sweep. Earthquake lets Snorlax hit Rhyperior and Cobalion, both of which would otherwise get in nearly unscathed to set up on it. For the last slot, the best options are Crunch and Fire Punch, the former hitting Cofagrigus hard—allowing Snorlax to counter the Offensive Trick Room version—and dealing more to Slowbro and Mew than the other three moves, and the latter allowing Snorlax to get past Bronzong and Escavalier. Fire Punch is also good against Shaymin if Snorlax runs Body Slam over Return.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Snorlax's offensive presence while allowing it to avoid the OHKO from a +1 Kingdra's Outrage after Stealth Rock, the 52 Defense EVs also let it survive two Outrages from Jolly Choice Scarf Flygon around 85% of the time without Stealth Rock on the field. The rest of the EVs go into Special Defense to make better use of its great special bulk, with 4 Speed EVs to get the jump on opposing base 30s such as Slowbro and Cofagrigus. Choice Band is the main item due to the added damage output, but Leftovers allow Snorlax to last longer and let it switch moves. While the listed spread is arguably the most effective, an alternate one of 252 Atk / 88 Def / 172 SpD with an Adamant nature can work with Leftovers to ensure Snorlax isn't 2HKOed by non-Choice Band Crobat's Brave Bird after Stealth Rock damage. Thick Fat is the only ability worth using, since it allows Snorlax to be one of the best answers to Victini, one of the hardest hitting Pokemon in the tier; it also lets it be a last-minute check to physical Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Darmanitan and Choice Band Weavile.</p> <p>Double-Edge is another option for a STAB move, being more powerful than a super effective Crunch, and working decently alongside Snorlax's massive HP stat. Without Leftovers though, Snorlax won't be able to check special attackers such as Zapdos and Raikou as well due to the recoil, therefore Return is usually a better option. Ice Punch can be used in the last slot to beat Gligar, though the latter is faster and can therefore Roost in Snorlax's face. It can work when combined with Leftovers and Body Slam paralysis, though. Seed Bomb is also an alternative to hit Rhyperior harder and beat Swampert one on one. Protect is a great option with Leftovers, giving it extra recovery and scouting for Choice users, especially notable against Fighting-types such as Heracross and Mienshao. Finally, Self-Destruct could be an option due to it being a 200 Base Power STAB move capable of OHKOing Slowbro. However, it faces legality issues with Pursuit, the primary of this set.</p> <p>When looking for partners, Fighting-types such as Heracross and Mienshao deserve a mention, since they appreciate the removal or weakening of Ghost- and Psychic-types. As Snorlax's only weakness is Fighting, a Pokemon that can absorb those moves with ease also works well. The best examples are Choice Specs Slowbro and Offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus, since they make good switches into Fighting-types and are good on offensive teams. Finally, to guarantee Snorlax will be able to tank hits for most of the match, Rapid Spin support is recommended. Hitmontop and Blastoise are the best for the job, but they are hard to fit into offensive teams, so Magic Bounce Xatu is an option to prevent hazards from being set and keeping the momentum.</p> "

        "description": "<p>A staple of the GSC era of Snorlax dominance, Curse Snorlax continues to be a threat. Taking a more offensive approach to the classic set, this set forfeits Rest in order to get three-move coverage. As such, it shouldn't be seen as a last-Pokemon sweeper but as an early wallbreaker by setting up on the special attackers it easily checks, mainly Zapdos and Raikou. Curse boosts Snorlax's great Attack and passable Defense stats at the cost of its already low Speed stat. Return is the STAB move of choice, with Crunch to hit Ghost-types, Mew, and Slowbro harder. The last move is for specific Pokemon: Earthquake hits Cobalion and Rhyperior harder, while Fire Punch helps against Bronzong and Escavalier, still hitting Cobalion super-effectively.</p> <p>The EVs allow Snorlax to always survive Choice Scarf Mienshao's High Jump Kick and Choice Scarf Heracross's Close Combat after one Curse boost, at the same time avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Band Flygon's Outrage, and always take two Thunderbolts from Choice Specs Zapdos. The rest goes into Snorlax's Attack stat to grant it more offensive presence. Adamant is the preferred nature for more power, hitting hard with Return even before setting up. Seed Bomb can be used to beat Rhyperior more reliably, since the latter avoids being 2HKOed by +1 Earthquake without investing into its Defense stat. It also disposes of Blastoise or Swampert that could try to Toxic or Roar Snorlax away. Self-Destruct can work as a secondary STAB move, getting a kill on stuff that prevent a teammate from sweeping, hitting incredibly hard after one Curse: to get a frame of reference, it deals roughly the same amount of damage to Rhyperior as Earthquake, it has a good chance of beating max Defense Blastoise before the latter can Roar Snorlax out, and it can even OHKO Slowbro with Spikes support.</p> <p>Depending on Snorlax's last move, it will struggle with specific threats. If it goes for Earthquake, Bronzong and Escavalier will wall it, so Fire-types like Victini or Rotom-H are good partners to deal with those walls. However, if it chooses Fire Punch, it won't stand a chance against Rhyperior and defensive Empoleon—offensive variants dislike boosted Returns—so Shaymin or Choice Specs Slowbro with Trick will be good teammates; the latter will also be able to deal with the Fighting-types that force Snorlax out, specifically Mienshao and Cobalion. Since this set's purpose is to smash things after a boost, having a secondary special tank is a good idea. Rhyperior is excellent in that regard, as it can bait Zapdos and Raikou into using Hidden Power, letting Snorlax switch in more safely. Nidoqueen can perform similarly, and also switch into Heracross and Scrafty with ease. Finally, Spikes support helps Snorlax greatly. Qwilfish and Roserade are the best for that position, the latter absorbing Scalds from bulky Water-types, such as Suicune.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This acts as the old Curse Snorlax that dominated a huge part of GSC OU, taking a more defensive approach. This Snorlax has been renowned as one of the most resilient last-Pokemon sweepers, since its sole weakness makes it harder to KO on the special side while it boosts its physical defense. While it isn't as good as it once was, considering the offensive nature of the metagame, it can still prove to be a threat. Body Slam is the STAB of choice for the paralysis chance, helping Snorlax boost more reliably. Earthquake and Crunch are the options for coverage, the former hitting Rhyperior and Cobalion, and the latter helping against Cofagrigus and Slowbro. Rest allows Snorlax to set up without fear on Zapdos and Raikou, since Snorlax can survive three hits before having to use Rest.</p> <p>The EV spread turns Snorlax into an amazing special tank, avoiding the 3HKO from Life Orb Modest Zapdos and Timid Choice Specs Raikou, while also taking two Surfs from Life Orb Kingdra in Rain. Additionally, the 188 Defense EVs allow it to survive two V-Creates from Jolly Choice Band Victini after Stealth Rock damage. Snorlax can also survive a High Jump Kick from Reckless Choice Scarf Mienshao at +1. Chesto Berry is an option over Leftovers to get instant recovery with Rest, although Leftovers are generally better in the long-run. Double-Edge can work over Body Slam with a spread of 80 HP / 176 Atk / 96 Def / 156 SpD and an Adamant nature, since with Rest, Snorlax doesn't mind the recoil much. Sleep Talk can be used to act as a mono-attacker, provided Snorlax has heavy Pursuit support to take care of Ghost-types. Fire Punch hits all Steel-types, while also beating Shaymin more reliably.</p> <p>Since this set struggles with Cobalion and Rhyperior—the former setting up on Snorlax and the latter phazing it with Dragon Tail—especially if it isn't running Earthquake, Slowbro makes for a good partner, as it can take little from their moves and even set up on them. Cleric support can be used if Snorlax is forced to Rest early and can't stay in, giving it a second chance to set up. Roserade and Togekiss are good options, the former forcing Rhyperior out and being able to set up Spikes or put a Pokemon to sleep, and the latter taking advantage of the removal or weakening of Electric-types. Finally, if not running Crunch, a Pursuit user is helpful to damage Ghost-types that don't mind Earthquake: Guts Heracross and Houndoom are the best options, absorbing Will-O-Wisps due to their abilities.</p> "

Even with the revised sleep mechanics, Snorlax is a viable Rest + Sleep Talk user due to its great natural bulk and access to Whirlwind to phaze away things trying to set up on it. Body Slam is the only attacking move needed, possibly spreading paralysis even while asleep. Whirlwind forces Pokemon out to rack up hazard damage; it works great alongside Body Slam and Sleep Talk, since the latter bypasses Whirlwind's negative priority when Snorlax is up against a paralyzed opponent. Rest gives it a form of recovery, while Sleep Talk means it won't be a sitting duck while asleep.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Snorlax to survive two V-creates from Choice Band Victini, while also not being 3HKOed by Modest Life Orb Zapdos's and Choice Specs Raikou's Thunderbolt. If you dislike the idea of a mono-attacking set, Crunch can be used instead of Sleep Talk or Whirlwind to hit Ghost-types such as Mismagius, while also dealing decent damage to Slowbro and Cofagrigus.</p> <p>Since this set is amazing at racking up residual damage, hazard setters are mandatory. Roserade and Qwilfish are good partners, both laying Spikes reliably while also resisting Fighting-type moves. Roserade can also run Aromatherapy, which could be helpful should Snorlax forgo Sleep Talk. Since neither can switch into coverage moves from Fighting-types, a main answer to them as well as Rhyperior is of need. Slowbro and Cofagrigus are both great physical walls to take those on, while having enough offensive presence to not become setup fodder. Slowbro can even take advantage of the paralysis spreading to get a late-game sweep with Calm Mind.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>After residing in Uber for the DPP era, Mew finds itself in the odd position of being demoted two tiers to the UU tier. While Mew still has its classic movepool that features every TM and move tutor move in the game, it cannot make up for its bland Psychic typing and decent, but not outstanding, stat distribution. In UU however, Mew is one of the most versatile Pokemon, as it can take on almost every role and position. With access to a wide variety of boosting moves, such as Nasty Plot, Swords Dance, Calm Mind, and Bulk Up, Mew can turn into a powerful sweeper. Mew can also run an equally dangerous support set that can act as a stallbreaker, while continuously walling dangerous threats and shutting them down with Will-O-Wisp. While Mew doesn't have the power of the tier's strongest sweepers or the bulk of the tier's sturdiest walls, it can more than make up for it with its astounding versatility that makes Mew a great pick on any team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With such a wide movepool and excellent base stats, it should come as no surprise that Mew has plenty of other viable options. Choice Specs and Choice Band can turn Mew into a deadly wallbreaker that can take advantage of its many coverage moves to hit most walls super effectively. On the other hand, a Choice Scarf lets Mew outspeed all of the unboosted metagame and revenge kill a huge amount of threats with its outstanding coverage. It can also use Transform as a gimmick to steal the opponent's boosts. Choice Scarf Mew can easily be catered to your team's needs; shoring up any weaknesses and vulnerabilities to certain sweepers. A dedicated lead set consisting of Stealth Rock, Explosion, and Taunt can be used to quickly set up Stealth Rock and prevent the opponent from doing the same. However, the dedicated lead set is often not as useful due to Team Preview, and can be better done by Azelf who has a similar moveset and stronger offensive stats. Of course, these are just a couple of the options Mew can run, Mew can learn any TM and move tutor move, so if it exists, Mew can use it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to Mew's versatility, countering it largely depends on the set it's running. Once Mew has revealed what moves it has, the appropriate counter or check can be brought in. Choice Scarf wielding revenge killers, such as Heracross, Krookodile, and Darmanitan, can shut down both the Nasty Plot and Swords Dance sets, but have to be wary of Sucker Punch on the latter. However, it's because of Mew's power that none of the above should risk directly switching into it. Weavile and Zoroark outspeed Mew naturally and are immune to its STAB attacks while being able to hit Mew super effectively with their own. Sableye, through virtue of its typing and movepool, can easily shut down support Mew with Taunt, while also being able to completely wall Swords Dance Mew. Unfortunately, Nasty Plot Mew is unfazed by burn and can easily destroy Sableye. Slowbro can check Swords Dance Mew by paralyzing it, thus making it easier to revenge kill, but it is soundly beat by Nasty Plot Mew. Slowking fares decently against most Mew variants, but can be OHKOed by a +2 Giga Drain and can do little but Dragon Tail or fish for Scald burns against Taunt. Cofagrigus beats most Mew variants but cannot stomach a Nasty Plot boosted Dark Pulse; it can otherwise remove boosts with Haze and set up Trick Room and Nasty Plot to turn the tables against Mew.</p> ",

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>Hampered by limited distribution and unsuitable candidates, Nasty Plot is a move that's rarely used in the UU metagame. That isn't to say it is bad in any way; Nasty Plot is a powerful boosting move that instantly doubles the Special Attack stat of the user. For a Pokemon that has as wide a movepool as Mew, this extra power can be devastating. After a boost or two, Mew's decent base 100 Special Attack stat is skyrocketed to explosive levels. Psyshock is Mew's way to break through special walls, being able to hit them on their weaker Defense stat; however, the stronger Psychic can be used if you know your team can easily clear out special walls for Mew to sweep. Fire Blast is a powerful Fire-type move with excellent coverage. It annihilates common Steel-types such as Escavalier and Bronzong, both of which can easily take Mew's Psychic STAB. When using Fire Blast, Giga Drain is recommended, as it can drain bulky Water-types that would otherwise take a few boosts to break, while also offsetting Life Orb Recoil. When using Fire Blast and Giga Drain for coverage, bulky Normal- and Psychic-type Pokemon, such as Snorlax, Porygon2, and opposing Mew, become more of a problem. Instead, one can switch to Aura Sphere. Aura Sphere also provides good coverage with Mew's Psychic STAB, and hits Dark- and Normal-types hoping to switch into battle. Dark Pulse complements Aura Sphere and lets Mew defeat Ghost- and fellow Psychic-types.</p> <p>A Timid nature is used to let Mew hit the all important base 100 Speed bracket where threats such as Zapdos reside. The 4 Special Defense EVs are used so Porygon2 and Porygon-Z cannot obtain Special Attack boosts upon switching in. A bulkier EV spread of 240 HP / 128 SpA / 4 SpD / 136 Spe with a Timid nature takes advantage of Mew's respectable bulk to set up much more easily while boasting similar power. Life Orb is the main item, as despite Mew's ability to double its Special Attack, it often lacks power without boosts, necessitating the Life Orb. However, Leftovers is still viable, especially on bulkier EV spreads that can take hits while setting up. Lum Berry is also viable, being especially useful against walls that rely on status to slow down Mew. Pokemon such as Slowbro and Suicune who attempt to Toxic stall Mew will find themselves against a +2 healthy Mew once Lum Berry has been activated. Because Nasty Plot Mew has incredible coverage against most special walls, partners that appreciate these walls being removed, such as Raikou, are especially good teammates for Mew. It is also a good idea to plan for whatever your Mew cannot break: if you're using Fire Blast and Giga Drain, Mew can be paired with a bulky Fighting-type, such as Swords Dance Heracross and Virizion, to break Snorlax, Porygon2, or any Dark-type, and if you're using Aura Sphere and Dark Pulse, Mew can be paired with a strong Fire-type, such as Darmanitan and Victini, to break Bronzong.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Mew can pull off a destructive Nasty Plot set, it can be equally deadly with a Swords Dance set. While its base 100 Attack seems to put Mew at a disadvantage compared to more powerful sweepers such as Mienshao and Darmanitan, Mew makes up for its offensive shortfalls with superior bulk and excellent versatility. What makes Mew a powerful sweeper is its excellent movepool and unpredictability. An opponent expecting a special attacking or defensive Mew will quickly find themselves exposed after letting Mew obtain a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>However, that isn't to say that Mew relies entirely on its unpredictability; even a known Swords Dance Mew can become a dangerous threat if left unchecked. Zen Headbutt is a powerful STAB move which, in conjunction with Mew's decent Speed, has a good chance to flinch the opponent. Drain Punch complements Mew's STAB, being able to pulverize Dark-types that shrug off Mew's Psychic-type assaults. Its ability to heal Mew should not be underestimated, as it allows Mew to restore health lost when setting up as well as mitigate Life Orb recoil. This passive recovery along with Mew's natural bulk means Mew is far more bulky than other common sweepers such as Mienshao and Weavile. Lastly, Mew rounds out its coverage with Sucker Punch, which hits Psychic-types that resist Zen Headbutt and Drain Punch. A powerful priority move in Sucker Punch lets Mew strike first against common Choice Scarf holders, such as Mismagius and Flygon, as well as beating Pokemon that naturally outspeed Mew. With perfect coverage, health regeneration, and priority, Mew is an extremely self-sufficient sweeper.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and maximum Speed allow Mew to outspeed base 85 Speed Pokemon, such as Heracross, Nidoking, Kingdra, and Rotom-A. The power from an Adamant nature is preferred as Mew is already fast and Sucker Punch is a significant perk of the set. An Adamant nature allows Mew to OHKO Flygon after just two switches into Stealth Rock with Sucker Punch, and has a good chance to 2HKO Suicune without hazards with Zen Headbutt. However, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed threats such as Arcanine and Life Orb Darmanitan, and Speed tie with Shaymin and Zapdos. A few EVs are placed in Special Defense so Download Porygon2 and Porygon-Z are stuck with a useless Attack boost when switching in. The choice between Life Orb and Leftovers depends mostly on how you want Mew to be played. Drain Punch somewhat reduces Life Orb recoil and allows Mew to hit hard with little drawback. However, the combination of Drain Punch recovery and Leftovers keeps Mew alive against heavy harassment that would otherwise prevent Mew from sweeping. If you opt to use a more offensive EV spread, then Life Orb is the recommended choice, but bulkier EV spreads prefer Leftovers.</p> <p>Although Mew has perfect coverage and immense power with Swords Dance, it still struggles against incredibly bulky walls and Pokemon who can dodge Sucker Punch. Cofagrigus can take Mew's attacks well enough to burn it with Will-O-Wisp and can hit it super effectively. Sableye can wall Mew by virtue of its typing which renders Zen Headbutt and Drain Punch useless. Sableye can then burn Mew and stall it out with Recover. Faster Pokemon that use Substitute can outpredict Mew by setting up a Substitute when Mew uses Sucker Punch, or hit Mew first if Mew doesn't use its priority move.</p> "

Taunt also prevents slower Pokemon, such as slower variants of Togekiss, from boosting their stats, and even lets Mew stop popular Stealth Rock users, such as Swampert and Bronzong, from setting up entry hazards. Mew then uses Will-O-Wisp; this cripples any physical attacker that isn't a Fire-type, and even special attackers hate the passive damage that they cannot heal because of Taunt. Soft-Boiled keeps Mew healthy while its opponent slowly succumbs to passive damage, and also allows Mew to wall powerful Pokemon, such as Choice Specs Raikou, Zapdos, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen.

However, this set can use a spread of 252 HP / 80 SpD / 176 Spe with a Timid nature to outspeed Roserade and OHKO with Psyshock. Snorlax is a good partner for this Mew as it can switch into Victini and Yanmega, two huge threats to Mew, and fight back with strong physical moves. Umbreon lacks the ability to beat Yanmega, but it retains the ability to check Victini and also resists Dark-type attacks. Nidoqueen checks Heracross, which can be problematic if it sneaks into battle, and can set up entry hazards to deal even more damage to stall teams. If used on a more offensive team, Mew should be paired with a fast and powerful sweeper that takes advantage of crippled walls. Mew can switch into the Poison-type Pokemon, such as Crobat and Nidoqueen, that stop Heracross and Mienshao from sweeping and threaten them with super effective STAB Psyshock. Mew can cripple special walls such as Snorlax and Umbreon to open up sweep for a special sweeper such as Raikou or Zapdos. Mew can also cripple bulky Water-type Pokemon standing in the way of a Darmanitan or Victini sweep, but Scald burns can ruin its longevity.</p> "

  "Crobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Say hello to Crobat, a Pokemon banished to BL in the past two generations, hinting at just how good it really is. Its good defensive typing and decent bulk allow it to act as a very good check to a lot of the metagame's most prominent threats, such as Roserade, Shaymin, Mienshao, Scrafty, and Heracross. Crobat also performs excellently as a stallbreaker, thanks to a combination of Taunt, Roost, and its great Speed. A decent Attack stat and the high Base Power of Brave Bird also allow it to deal heavy damage without the need for much investment. Crobat's poor offensive movepool and a weakness to Stealth Rock let it down at times, but fret not, as this speedy bat is still one of the best at what it does, and as long as you know its limitations, it will not let you down.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to Crobat's limited movepool, it is lacking in the form of alternatives. That said, there are a couple of interesting toys in its repertoire which can surprise the opposition. For example, a Nasty Plot set using Sludge Bomb, Heat Wave, and Giga Drain will definitely surprise your opponent and has a very limited number of safe switch-ins. However, the main problem with this set is that they often find themselves outclassed by other Pokemon who simply hit harder and have better coverage, such as Azelf.</p> <p>Haze can be utilized in order to halt slower stat boosters, such as Bulk Up Machamp, but as you may have noticed already, Taunt is usually enough in these situations. Whirlwind can also be used, as it is sure to shuffle the opponent's team around and rack up some residual damage in the process. However, this move's negative priority nullifies Crobat's greatest advantage: its Speed. Screech is also an option, as it can force switches on opponents who don't want to be hit with Brave Bird while their Defense is halved. While a set employing Acrobatics and Flying Gem might seem like a good idea at first, one must consider that Brave Bird will outdamage Acrobatics 100% of the time and that the lack of Black Sludge recovery will wear down Crobat much faster. Finally, Crobat's Dream World ability, Infiltrator, isn't very useful when it's doing most of its damage through Toxic or Super Fang, and it also has Taunt to stop the opponent from setting up screens anyway. It could prove to be much more useful on more offensive sets, however.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Countering Crobat usually comes down to hitting it hard enough so that it cannot Roost off the damage. With that in mind, Bronzong is the optimal counter, as it is immune to Toxic, resists Brave Bird, and has Gyro Ball to seriously hurt Crobat. Zapdos can tank pretty much any of Crobat's moves and Roost off any damage while threatening it back with Electric-type STAB. Rotom-H can also utilize its Electric-type STAB to scare away Crobat, but both need to be wary of Toxic. Bulky Water-types, especially Slowbro with its ability, Regenerator, and STAB Psyshock, fear very little from Crobat and can burn it with Scald or hit it hard with Ice Beam. Rhyperior doesn't fear anything Crobat can throw at it and can use the opportunity to set up Stealth Rock or simply blast Crobat with its Rock-type STAB. Bisharp and Registeel can easily come in on anything Crobat throws at them and proceed to set up as Crobat retreats. If all else fails, you can always resort to revenge killing the speedy bat through the use of a hard-hitting Choice Scarf user, such as Victini or Darmanitan.</p> ",

        "name": "Stallbreaker",
        "description": "<p>This set works wonders on offensive and balanced teams in need of a solid response to stall teams. Its fantastic typing and nicely placed stats also allow it to check many prominent offensive threats, such as Roserade and various Fighting-types--most notably Mienshao, Heracross, and especially Scrafty, who remains slower than Crobat even after it uses Dragon Dance. This means that no matter what type of team you face, Crobat will always be useful in battle.</p> <p>Brave Bird is Crobat's best STAB move, and thanks to its high Base Power, it will do a good amount of damage to just about anything that doesn't resist it. Taunt allows Crobat to do its job as a stallbreaker by preventing the opponent from using non-damaging moves. Roost lets Crobat stick around for a while and somewhat alleviates its weakness to Stealth Rock. U-turn is a quality move on Crobat, as a lot of the time it forces switches, allowing you to grab the momentum of the battle. Toxic can be used because it hits a lot of Crobat's counters on the switch, such as Zapdos, Slowbro, and other bulky Water-types, and with Taunt preventing recovery, they are bound to get worn down pretty quickly. Finally, Super Fang is the only move Crobat has to damage Steel- and Rock-types, and much like Toxic, can also be used to wear down Pokemon until they are in Brave Bird's KO range.</p> <p>This set's EVs give Crobat enough Speed to outrun all base 115 Speed Pokemon, such as Azelf, allow it to OHKO 0/0 Scrafty with Stealth Rock damage factored in, prevent a beneficial Download boost for opposing Porygon2 and Porygon-Z, and the remainder get put in HP to optimize Crobat's bulk. The given spread is not set in stone though; you can always play around with it to suit your team's needs. For example, a bulkier spread of 252 HP / 116 Atk / 4 SpD / 136 Spe sacrifices Crobat's ability to OHKO 0/0 Scrafty in exchange for more bulk, while a stronger spread of 136 HP / 232 Atk / 4 SpD / 136 Spe guarantees the 2HKO on +1 Bulk Up Scrafty.</p> <p>Leftovers is an option over Black Sludge if you're worried about Crobat being on the receiving end of a Trick and then having another member of your team end up with the Black Sludge. Although it's very unlikely that the Trick user will have the opportunity to use it twice, so Black Sludge is usually the better choice. Hypnosis is also an option in the fourth moveslot, as it can potentially shut down one of Crobat's counters, especially when you consider the BW sleep mechanics. However, this option is generally unappealing because of its extremely shaky accuracy.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support from Blastoise, which can tank Ice-type moves while luring out Grass-types for Crobat to switch in on, is very much appreciated due to Crobat's weakness to Stealth Rock. As this set is completely walled by Steel-types, having a partner who can take advantage of them is a very good idea. One such partner would be Victini, which can easily come in on most Steel-types and blast them with its Fire-type STAB move of choice.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Band attached, Crobat eschews its role as a defensive pivot and instead uses its speed and newfound power to become a swift, deadly assassin. Brave Bird is the core of the set, functioning as a powerful STAB move which allows Crobat to outspeed and OHKO a vast majority of offensive Pokemon in the tier. It also deters all but the most physically bulky Pokemon from safely switching in. U-turn allows Crobat to maintain momentum, and punishes physically bulky Pokemon by damaging them and then bringing them face-to-face with a counter. Cross Poison, while a poor move with limited coverage, is nonetheless Crobat's only option for covering the ubiquitous Electric-type Pokemon in UU. Note that Cross Poison's use is highly situational, as even a resisted Brave Bird 2HKOs offensive variants of Zapdos and Raikou after Stealth Rock. Super Fang is an option to strip 50% from the health of Bronzong, Rhyperior, Magneton, Registeel, and other physically bulky Pokemon which Crobat cannot otherwise harm. These Pokemon typically lack reliable recovery, giving the move substantial utility. The final slot is highly situational. Sleep Talk may seem like an odd choice, but several of the Pokemon Crobat enjoys switching into are Grass-types, and commonly pack Sleep Powder. Given the sleep mechanics in the current generation, Sleep Talk could be the difference between a useful Pokemon and death fodder. Roost is an option to alleviate the residual damage Crobat will be accumulating from Stealth Rock and Brave Bird recoil. It is best used to save Crobat from near-death, as using Roost will cost a substantial amount of momentum.</p> <p>Neither of Crobat's abilities are more than incidentally useful, but the choice is nevertheless worth discussing. Infiltrator allows Crobat to ignore Reflect, which could be very useful against dual screen hyper offense teams that rely on it to shield their frail sweepers. Inner Focus, on the other hand, dissuades Mienshao and Ambipom from using Fake Out, and also allows Crobat to beat Togekiss even while paralyzed. The choice of nature also has trade-offs: Jolly allows Crobat to outrun every Pokemon in the tier without Speed boosts, and a few Pokemon even with Speed boosts (such as slower variants of Dragon Dance Kingdra). Adamant, on the other hand, secures important OHKOs, such as against +1 Bulk Up Scrafty and max HP Togekiss after Stealth Rock. It also secures 2HKOs against physically defensive Slowbro and Swampert. The inability to outrun any Pokemon above base 115 Speed with an Adamant nature is a marked disadvantage, however.</p> <p>Crobat does not have many other options as its physical movepool is abysmal. Steel Wing might be tempting, but it barely scratches the Rock-types one would want to use it against. Giga Drain, on the other hand, scores a solid 2HKO on Rhyperior, Omastar, and Kabutops. All of these Pokemon would likely switch out before taking the second hit, however, and Giga Drain does very little to every other Pokemon likely to switch into Crobat. Pursuit is an option to damage fleeing Pokemon, but will do pitiful damage to any enemy that does not switch. Quick Attack is good for evading Sucker Punch and getting some damage on opposing sweepers that have boosted past what even Crobat can catch, but it's an incredibly weak move in general.</p> <p>Crobat enjoys exploiting its immunity to Ground and its 4x resistances to Fighting- and Grass-type attacks. Crobat's resistances allow it to switch in to some of the most common Pokemon in the tier, including Roserade, Hitmontop, Shaymin, Heracross, and Mienshao. Be wary of the coverage moves these Pokemon commonly carry, however. Crobat's minimal defensive investment means that moves like Stone Edge, Psychic, and Hidden Power Ice will do massive damage. Swampert is a natural teammate for Crobat, being able to switch easily into the Rock- and Electric-type attacks that plague Crobat. Crobat, in return, easily stomachs any Grass-type attack aimed at Swampert. Crobat also enjoys Rapid Spin support, and pairs well with both Blastoise and Hitmontop. It should be noted that Crobat does not have the power to sweep through healthy teams by itself, so it appreciates being paired with powerful attackers that can weaken the opposing team to the point where Crobat can use its speed to clean up. Flygon is a natural fit, if one does not mind the shared Ice-type weakness, as is Sharpedo.</p> "

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<p>Lanturn's unique-for-the-metagame Water / Electric typing coupled with Volt Absorb allows it to be a good check to several special attackers such as Zapdos and Rotom-H. Its high base 125 HP also means that it can take some physical hits well despite its low Defense. Lanturn also has access to good support moves such as Thunder Wave and Heal Bell, which give it a defined role in the bulky UU metagame. Lanturn can also go offensive with Choice Specs, scaring away Pokemon immune to Electric such as Rhyperior with the threat of Hydro Pump. However, its weaknesses to Grass- and Ground-type moves, which are common coverage options on many Pokemon, and its lack of reliable recovery mean that it can be worn down pretty easily. Lanturn also has poor offensive presence when uninvested, which means that threats such as Substitute + Calm Mind Raikou can set up on it. Overall, its best roles are as a cleric for defensive and balanced teams and as a slow Volt Switch user for more offensive teams thanks to its Thunder Wave immunity and good dual STAB types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There isn't much else Lanturn can run with great effectiveness. A RestTalk set can be utilized; with RestTalk, Lanturn can absorb status ailments, launch an attack, and heal itself quite easily. While asleep, Lanturn can proceed to use Sleep Talk to dish out decent damage while having the potential to burn incoming switch-ins. While Suicune and Milotic might seem to outclass it as a RestTalk user, Lanturn's unique typing and ability allow it to stand strong in the face of virtually all special attackers, including Zapdos. A combination of Substitute and Charge Beam is another option, but it will rarely work due to Lanturn's mediocre Special Attack and low Speed. Lanturn can run a parafusion set with Water Pulse and Thunder Wave, but this is ineffective because switching is not common in UU due to the tier's lack of Choice item users. However, parafusion complements paraflinch variants of Togekiss very nicely, forming a solid paralysis-spreading core to aid slower sweepers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When one thinks of counters to Lanturn, Grass-types immediately spring to mind. Roserade and Shaymin are the best counters due to Natural Cure, which allows them to switch in without any fear. Virizion poses an immediate threat as well, being able to swiftly KO Lanturn with STAB Leaf Blade.</p> <p>Hitting Lanturn with physical attacks is generally the way to go. Heracross can take hits relatively well from Lanturn and deal hefty damage with either of its STAB attacks, and the threat of Guts means that Lanturn has to be wary of possibly inflicting it with a status condition. Gligar and Flygon both outpace Lanturn and can scare it out with a super effective Earthquake; however, these two cannot reliably take a hit in return.</p> <p>While Lanturn does have Heal Bell to ward off status ailments, the move has limited PP, and there are limited opportunities to safely use it in the fast-paced BW UU metagame. Because of this, status conditions can put a lot of pressure on Lanturn, so inflicting it with one is ideally the best way for stall teams to remove it from the battle. In a similar vein, due to Lanturn's lack of a reliable recovery move, bulky walls such as Umbreon and Clefable can take anything in Lanturn's arsenal and stall it out with ease.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Tank",
        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Lanturn's great Special Defense stat. Pair this with its great defensive typing and Volt Absorb, and you'll find yourself a stellar tank. Scald can cripple incoming counters such as Virizion. What makes Volt Switch such a great move on Lanturn is its low Speed, meaning that it almost always will move last, giving a free switch to a teammate. The third slot is a toss-up between Heal Bell and Toxic. The former move allows Lanturn to play more of a team support role by providing multiple chances for wallbreakers to wreak havoc on the opposing team. Toxic is a great asset to have on board when dealing with opposing Lanturn, other bulky Water-types such as Suicune, and Raikou. However, you must be wary of Substitute + Calm Mind variants of Raikou and Suicune, which will find it easy to set up Substitute on a failed Toxic attempt and subsequently boost with Calm Mind. Thunder Wave cripples the majority of the UU metagame pretty hard, as many of its Pokemon sport rather decent Speed, leaving slower teammates such as Rhyperior and Scrafty less vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster threats. Most of these threats are special attackers, meaning that Lanturn's great Special Defense will allow it to get the job done.</p> <p>The combination of HP and Special Defense EVs allows Lanturn to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Zapdos's Hidden Power Grass. This spread has its drawbacks, such as being unable to survive Leaf Blade from Life Orb Virizion, as referenced below. However, it generally isn't a good idea to stay in on Virizion, and Lanturn will have taken prior damage the majority of the time. There is little use in investing in its Special Attack, so the remainder is thrown into its Defense to help take hits from the likes of Choice Scarf Heracross slightly better. Protect is a decent alternative to either Thunder Wave or Heal Bell to punish Mienshao's Hi Jump Kick and scout for Choice item users in general.</p> <p>252 Atk Life Orb Virizion Leaf Blade vs. 204 HP / 96 Def Lanturn: 398-471 (90 - 106.5%) -- 37.5% chance to OHKO</p> <p>252 Atk Life Orb Virizion Leaf Blade vs. 52 HP / 252 Def Lanturn: 330-390 (81.6 - 96.5%) -- guaranteed 2HKO after Leftovers recovery</p> <p>Pokemon that lack many relevant resistances appreciate the slow Volt Switch that Lanturn provides, such as Rhyperior and Weavile. Lanturn typically lures in Grass-types such as Roserade, Shaymin, and Virizion, so Fire-types, especially those that sport a pivoting move such as U-turn, and Crobat make for good partners, as they have great synergy with Lanturn both offensively and defensively, being able to force out its counters after Lanturn brings them in with Volt Switch. One can take advantage of this turn and further gain momentum by using U-turn on a predicted switch. Entry hazards are very beneficial when using Lanturn, as its impressive bulk can help it force quite a few switches; Roserade and Bronzong are Pokemon that spring to mind, as both have great synergy with Lanturn and are able to set up entry hazards.</p> "

        "name": "Rain Dance",
        "description": "<p>Lanturn's ability to summon rain with Rain Dance and fend off stray Electric-type attacks with Volt Absorb allows it to fit onto rain teams with ease. Lanturn often finds it easy to set up Rain Dance on Fire-, Water-, and Electric-types, and its naturally good special bulk and typing grant it the ability to reliably bring the rain and set it up repeatedly if need be. Its relatively extensive movepool allows it to directly utilize the rain and further support the team, making Lanturn rather invaluable to rain teams. Lanturn's low base Speed and access to Volt Switch allow it to act as a fantastic pivot that also provides rain support, enabling it to provide a safe switch to a rain sweeper. The third moveslot is a matter of utility. Thunder is a powerful STAB move to spam under rain, frying opposing bulky Water-types that try to wall your team's rain sweepers, while Heal Bell grants the team cleric support, cleansing your team of annoying status conditions. Raw power versus perfect accuracy is what the final moveslot is all about. Hydro Pump is Lanturn's strongest move and will be sure to leave a dent on almost anything that it hits in the rain. Surf is another alternative that also receives a power boost from rain but has lower Base Power in exchange for perfect accuracy.</p> <p>The given EV spread is pretty straightforward. 152 Speed EVs enable Lanturn to outpace minimum Speed Gligar and Suicune, which is pretty vital considering that the former, if given the chance, can prevent Lanturn from setting up rain by either Taunting it or potentially putting Lanturn out of commission with Earthquake.</p> <p>0 Atk Gligar Earthquake vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Lanturn: 264-312 (67.51 - 79.79%) -- guaranteed 2HKO</p> <p>A Modest nature and 252 Special Attack EVs allow Lanturn to and hit hard with its STAB attacks under rain, and the remaining EVs are dedicated to its Special Defense. Damp Rock maximizes the number of turns that rain is up. This might seem inferior to Leftovers at first glance, but in practice, the three extra turns will prove much more valuable to your rain sweepers and will often be the difference between a win and a loss.</p> <p>Water-type rain sweepers such as Omastar, Kabutops, and Kingdra are great teammates for Lanturn. Lanturn can switch in freely on Electric-type attacks aimed at these three powerhouses and replenish its HP with Volt Absorb, which is vital in ensuring its longevity, as it lacks Leftovers. Ludicolo is another strong choice due to its resistance to the Ground-type attacks that Lanturn is weak to, meaning that Ludicolo can be manually switched in without the aid of Volt Switch to sponge a Ground-type attack. Despite Lanturn's ability to potentially set up rain several times during the battle, it is important to have a secondary weather inducer on board to remove some pressure from Lanturn. Great partners include Bronzong and Zapdos, both of which have excellent defensive synergy with Lanturn, as they are immune to Ground-type attacks and resist Grass-types attacks. Tornadus also has amazing synergy with Lanturn and can take advantage of rain with its perfectly accurate Hurricane; it is also able to set up a Prankster-prioritized Rain Dance.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Although Lanturn's middling Special Attack might make this set seem like an odd choice, Lanturn is a perfectly viable candidate for a Choice Specs special attacker. Its bulk and typing allow it to come in on a number of special threats, particularly Moltres and Suicune, and proceed to launch reasonably powerful attacks. Volt Absorb also gives it a way to recover HP by switching into Electric-type attacks from the likes of Raikou and Zapdos, which is useful to keep Lanturn healthy. Even though Lanturn's power can still be a bit lacking, it is bulky enough to use its moves multiple times. Lanturn's main advantage over Slowking in this role is its Electric typing, which grants it a good STAB type to use against opposing bulky Water-types.</p> <p>Hydro Pump is very unexpected on a Pokemon known for its defensive prowess, so it often possesses the element of surprise. It OHKOes defensive Nidoqueen in addition to offensive Zapdos after Stealth Rock, which neither Scald nor Surf can accomplish all of the time. Volt Switch is the most notable move in Lanturn's arsenal due to its below-average Speed stat, allowing it to switch out to other teammates while grabbing momentum. Ice Beam is the only way that Lanturn can deal with Grass-types that roam the tier as well as Druddigon, having a slight chance to OHKO the Choice Band set after Stealth Rock. Thunderbolt serves as a powerful and reliable option to hit Water-types and doesn't force Lanturn to switch out of a favorable position.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Lanturn to outpace Gligar and defensive Togekiss. Surf can be used instead of Scald; however, you forgo the chance to bluff a defensive set in addition to getting some timely burns on some of Lanturn's most common switch-ins. Discharge works in a similar fashion to Scald and can be used instead of Thunderbolt; however, the drop in power is noticeable.</p> <p>Poison-types such as Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking have great synergy with Lanturn and can get rid of the much-dreaded Toxic Spikes, and the former two can lay down entry hazards to aid Lanturn's path of destruction. Special tanks such as Umbreon and Snorlax are troubling for Lanturn, so utilizing Fighting-types such as Scrafty and Heracross can be much appreciated. More subtle ways to bait and remove those two tanks are possible, such as using one or two hard-hitting mixed attackers or setup sweepers such as Raikou and Cofagrigus to severely weaken them, thereby paving the way for Lanturn. Togekiss can switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Lanturn, while Lanturn can absorb any Electric-type attacks thrown at Togekiss from Raikou and Zapdos in return.</p> "

Its access to reliable recovery and U-turn also allow it to do its job more effectively, as it can prevent hazards, but also not lose momentum in the match. However, Xatu's typing is a detriment against it defensively, and leaves it vulnerable to prominent entry hazard setters such as Rhyperior. Its weakness to Stealth Rock also means that it may also need Rapid Spin support to function at its fullest. Xatu is also fairly one-dimensional, and can be easy to play around. As long as you know how to alleviate Xatu's faults, it can prove a useful member of your team.</p> ",

Grass Knot can be used to catch Rhyperior and Swampert, common switch-ins to Xatu, off guard and deal the pair some heavy damage. However, once those two are off the field, Grass Knot becomes a waste of a moveslot. Heat Wave and Giga Drain provide decent offensive coverage, but Xatu isn't typically designed for offense, a task better left to Pokemon such as Azelf, who has similar coverage and has better Special Attack and Speed stats. A Calm Mind set utilizing Calm Mind, Stored Power, Roost, and Hidden Power Fighting is possible, as it increases Xatu's two best stats. Xatu can usually find the time to set it up, but lacks solid Defense and Speed stats to make it worthwhile. A Choice set can be used with either Choice Scarf or Choice Specs, as it can be used to somewhat damage an opponent or hinder a setup Pokemon via Trick, but is outclassed by stronger and faster Pokemon such as Azelf, Raikou, and Victini.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Despite preventing it from being placed on your side of the field, Stealth Rock really hurts Xatu's staying power, removing 25% of its health per switch-in, forcing Xatu to worry more about recovering its health rather than supporting its teammates. Strong Choice item users such as Darmanitan and Heracross, pose dangers to Xatu, as they threaten with powerful STAB moves in Flare Blitz and Megahorn, respectively. Every Electric-type Pokemon in the UU tier -- Zapdos, Raikou, and Rotom-H -- can come in on basically anything but Thunder Wave or Toxic and heavily threaten Xatu with STAB Thunderbolt. Setup sweepers that are immune to or have a way to cure themselves from the effects of Thunder Wave or Toxic, such as Scrafty or Togekiss, can set up on Xatu and threaten it with powerful attacks. Rhyperior carries Stealth Rock but doesn't allow Xatu to switch in for free thanks to Rock Blast. Krookodile can trap Xatu with Pursuit and is immune to both Thunder Wave and Psychic. Krookodile can also threaten it with Crunch and Stone Edge if need be.

Roost restores Xatu's rather low HP, increasing its staying power immensely. U-turn works as a great scouting move that allows you to bring a counter in against opposing threats and create momentum for your team.

        "description": "<p>While Xatu's other sets focus on using its typing and Magic Bounce defensively, this set uses its decent Special Attack and movepool to defeat nearly every common entry hazard setter in the tier. This set functions much better on offensive teams, as it does not ruin momentum like Blastoise and Hitmontop do and can pose a threat itself. Psyshock functions as Xatu's primary STAB move, as it can defeat many common hazard setters, such as Nidoqueen and Qwilfish. If using a Modest nature, it is the preferred move over Psychic due to its ability to 2HKO offensive Snorlax after Stealth Rock. However, if using a Timid nature, Psychic is the preferred option, as it will always OHKO standard Nidoqueen, unlike Psyshock. Grass Knot is a key move on this set, as it allows Xatu to defeat the two best Stealth Rock setters in the tier: Rhyperior and Swampert. Heat Wave is used for the purpose of severely denting Steel-types as well as OHKOing on the switch. In fact, it is powerful enough to 2HKO Bronzong and 3HKO Registeel 100% of the time. Finally, Roost is used to mitigate Life Orb recoil and potentially Stealth Rock damage that Xatu has taken.</p> <p>Using the given EV spread, Xatu is able to outspeed everything up to maximum Speed base 90s. The choice between a Modest and a Timid nature depends on your personal preference. If outspeeding threats such as Timid Nidoking, Jolly Heracross, and Timid Roserade is essential, then a Timid nature is preferred. If 2HKOing Snorlax after Stealth Rock is mandatory, then a Modest nature takes precedence. U-turn is an option on this set, as it allows Xatu to escape from special walls such as Porygon2 and Umbreon and bring in a Fighting-type partner. However, using U-turn forces Xatu to give up one of its coverage moves or Roost, all of which are vital to this set's success.</p> <p>This set struggles against Empoleon, as it is not 2HKOed by Heat Wave and can 2HKO Xatu at worst with Ice Beam. This set also struggles against certain special walls such as Porygon2 and Umbreon due to Xatu's limited power, as well as common offensive Pokemon such as Zapdos. Therefore, Xatu's best partners are divided into two groups: Pokemon that can deal with these threats, and offensive Pokemon that benefit from the prevention of Stealth Rock. Rhyperior and Swampert can both check offensive Pokemon such as Zapdos, Victini, and Raikou. Offensive Pokemon that benefit from the prevention of Stealth Rock include Yanmega, Victini, Darmanitan, Zapdos, and Weavile. Darmanitan, Zapdos, and Victini in particular benefit from Xatu's ability to lure and defeat Rhyperior and Swampert with Grass Knot.</p> "

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>Quagsire returns for another round of competitive battling, this time with even more herpin' and derpin' thanks to Unaware. This ability allows the mudfish to ignore the opponent's stat boosts, both positive and negative. UU is a bit more tempered than OU, so Quagsire finds its niche in countering pretty much every offensive Pokemon in the tier, barring Grass-types or a critical hit. Water / Ground typing and decent defenses also let it stop most Electric-types, as they typically use Hidden Power Ice as a coverage move and don't have access to a Grass-type move. Access to instant healing in Recover is like adding powdered coffee to the curry, giving Quagsire reliability and survivability. Unfortunately, as with many walls, it is crippled by Toxic and Toxic Spikes, and cannot do much to mitigate that. Furthermore, Quagsire will still fall to powerful moves or Grass-type attacks such as Hydro Pump from Sharpedo or Hidden Power Grass from Milotic and must therefore be played with relative caution. Nonetheless, this mudfish truly shines on teams troubled by setup sweepers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Quagsire is not at all short of other moves it can use. Counter, while rather gimmicky, allows Quagsire to KO opponents that cannot OHKO it. However, this approach means the mudfish will be taking hits, and with its low Speed, it will not have time to Recover the damage off in preparation for the next foe. Safeguard is an option to protect teammates from status, but is mostly a waste of a moveslot since Quagsire usually has better things to do. A RestTalk set is certainly viable on Quagsire, but Pokemon with better defenses such as Suicune are better at this role. Encore might provide teammates a free turn of setup, but it is sadly ineffective on Quagsire due to its low Speed, and Shadow Tag Wynaut is a better Encore user anyway. Water Absorb is another ability Quagsire can explore, but the ability to shut down setup sweepers is perhaps Quagsire's greatest niche in the UU metagame. Acid Spray also becomes useful with Water Absorb; with Unaware, the Special Defense drops would be ignored. However, Quagsire's low base 65 Special Attack makes this strategy gimmicky and largely ineffective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Grass-types are the number one counters to Quagsire, resisting its dual STAB and retaliating with 4x super effective attacks. Roserade is an excellent example, as it can set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes as Quagsire flees. RestTalk users such as Milotic check Quagsire pretty well too, as they aren't crippled by Toxic and can phaze Quagsire out. Various offensive threats will beat Quagsire as well: strong STAB moves such as Close Combat from Heracross, Outrage from Dragon-types, or Hydro Pump from Sharpedo will still be able to KO. Thus, players must be wary of indiscriminately switching Quagsire into any attack; this mudfish is not invincible.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Quagsire makes an excellent user of Curse due to its ability, Unaware. This allows it to set up on many of the boosting sweepers in UU, such as Weavile, Spiritomb, and various Calm Mind users. Curse makes Quagsire even harder to take down by boosting its uninvested Defense, and increases its usable base 85 Attack to threatening levels. The Speed drops are inconsequential, since it is extremely slow anyway. Recover distinguishes it from other Curse users such as Snorlax, by allowing Quagsire to restore HP reliably. Earthquake is Quagsire's main STAB move, providing a reliable form of offense. It also hits Electric-types super effectively, which is great since most are walled handily by Quagsire. The last slot is a toss-up between Stone Edge and Waterfall. If you desire the excellent neutral coverage that EdgeQuake provides, Stone Edge is the better choice, as it hits Levitating Pokemon, such as Rotom-F, and Flying-types, such as Zapdos, that Earthquake would otherwise miss, providing the best overall coverage. However, Waterfall is still a valid choice. A reliable second STAB move, it hits the many Ground-types, such as Rhyperior and Golurk, for super effective damage.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes are a huge issue for Quagsire, so partners such as Roserade are great to remove them. It can also lay down its own Toxic Spikes, which complements this Curse set's survivability, and Roserade 4x resists Quagsire's dreaded Grass-type weakness. Roserade even takes down opposing Quagsire, which is not particularly troubled by this set, and can threaten a burn with Scald or poison with Toxic. Since Quagsire is neutered by status, clerics such as Roserade and Shaymin are good teammates. They can also help sponge powerful special attacks from the likes of Mismagius and Nidoking, which can take down Quagsire. Opposing Grass-types are a huge issue as well, threatening Quagsire with their super effective attacks, so Fire-types such as Darmanitan and Victini pair well with Quagsire to eliminate them and switch in on resisted attacks.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes bulk, with full investment in HP and Special Defense to make Quagsire a great mixed wall after a few turns of setup. A more offensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD is possible, but this is not recommended for a few reasons. First of all, Quagsire's Attack, even invested, is too low for the investment to be justified. Secondly, it severely detracts from Quagsire's special bulk, which is almost a necessity for Quagsire to stick around.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Quagsire is a great answer to most non-Choice Band physical attackers thanks to Unaware. Recover helps it in this role, allowing it to heal off the damage from attacks that fail to OHKO or 2HKO, such as Weavile's Ice Punch. Scald spreads burns, crippling most physical attackers. However, it should not be used in an offensive manner, as coming off a base 65 Special Attack means it will be very weak. While Toxic might seem counterproductive with Scald, it certainly earns its keep in the third slot. It is useful when predicting defensive switch-ins that might want to use Quagsire as setup fodder. Earthquake is the best option for the last slot; it is a reliable STAB move and hits Electric-type Pokemon such as Electivire that generally cannot do anything to Quagsire.</p> <p>Since Quagsire is using both special and physical attacks, a Relaxed nature with the given EVs is best to maximize physical bulk; the fact that it lowers Speed hardly matters, as Quagsire is very slow to begin with. Alternatively, you can use a specially defensive set to counter most special attackers (without a Grass-type move, of course), especially Electric-types such as Jolteon, Zapdos, and Raikou. This choice wholly depends on your team. Stockpile over Earthquake is viable, but this leaves Quagsire nearly hopeless against Taunt, and strong moves will still KO. Yawn can be used as a phazing move over Toxic, but is a lesser option because of Sleep Clause. Swagger is a decent choice over Earthquake if Quagsire uses Toxic, as it will be able to stall out the opponent with confusion and steady damage from Toxic while ignoring the Attack boosts with Unaware. However, it is rather unreliable and easily PP stalled.</p> <p>Entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field are rather useful for Quagsire, as Unaware will force the opponent to switch when Quagsire cannot be taken down. Roserade is once again a great teammate, setting up entry hazards and tanking Grass-type moves. Zapdos provides nice support to Quagsire by both taking Grass-type moves and frying opponents with Heat Wave. Your own Water-types will like the opponent's Electric-types removed; Swords Dance Samurott and Feraligatr will put pressure on the opponent when fast, threatening Electric-types are gone.</p> "

However, Umbreon's sparse movepool and terrible offensive stats prevent it from filling any other role. Fighting-type Pokemon are common in UU, and they constantly threaten Umbreon. Furthermore, Umbreon's lack of offensive pressure means that many setup sweepers, such as Nasty Plot Togekiss, can use it as setup bait. Still, Umbreon is the best at what it does, and it can ensure its teammates stay healthy throughout the match.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Umbreon can try to sweep with Curse, but it's outclassed in this role by Scrafty and Snorlax. Even with a Curse under its belt, Umbreon is threatened by strong Fighting-types. They can still deal significant damage with their STAB moves, and they resist Umbreon's Dark-type STAB. Mean Look can be used to trap an opponent and Toxic stall it, but Umbreon will often trap a switch-in and the turn will have been wasted. Inner Focus is next to useless, as the primary flinch user, Togekiss, can boost its Special Attack with Nasty Plot to overwhelm Umbreon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Umbreon is checked by most Fighting-types and many Steel-types. Mienshao and Heracross can both switch into Umbreon and hit it with powerful STAB moves. Scrafty can switch into Umbreon and set up with Dragon Dance or Bulk Up. Cobalion receives an Attack boost when hit with Foul Play, and can set up Swords Dance or Stealth Rock. Durant and Escavalier can both stomach a hit from Foul Play and the former can start a sweep with Hone Claws, while the latter can use powerful STAB moves. Bisharp can use Umbreon as setup bait for Swords Dance, and it can also set up a Substitute to ease prediction. Any setup sweeper that doesn't fear Foul Play can set up on Umbreon if it lacks Toxic. Although it can't KO Umbreon, Roserade can switch into it and start setting up Spikes layers. Taunt users, such as Crobat and Gligar, can prevent Umbreon from healing and can slowly weaken it. Qwilfish has access to both Taunt and Spikes as well as Pain Split, and can thus use Umbreon as setup fodder. Strong physical attackers can take advantage of Umbreon's lower Defense stat, but they must watch out for Foul Play, which can deal significant damage if they don't resist it.</p> ",

Umbreon can switch into many special attackers in the tier and can comfortably use one of its team-supporting moves. Wish can restore 197 HP to a teammate and keeps Umbreon's team in a good fighting condition. Foul Play is Umbreon's best attacking option, as even special attackers like Raikou and Zapdos have higher Attack stats than Umbreon. Furthermore, Foul Play can deal significant damage to physical attackers that try to exploit Umbreon's lower Defense stat. It OHKOes Darmanitan after Stealth Rock damage, 2HKOes all Flygon, and can even score a solid 3HKO on Choice Scarf Heracross. The ability to remove status with Heal Bell is very useful, as it can give a crippled sweeper a second chance to sweep. This also works very well with Synchronize, as Umbreon can heal its status condition after inflicting it on the opponent. However, Umbreon can trade the ability to clear status for the ability to inflict it with Toxic. Between Wish and Protect, Umbreon can quickly build up Toxic damage and wear down Pokemon that can't deal significant damage to it. Yawn can shuffle the opponent's team and can render a Pokemon useless for the remainder of the match. Protect allows Umbreon to scout the opponent's next move, take better advantage of Wish and Yawn by negating the charging turn, and build up Toxic damage. However, if your opponent predicts your Protect turn, they could use it to set up a sweep.</p> <p>The EVs on this set allow Umbreon to be a reasonably effective special wall, which is how it switches into battle to support its team. Pursuit can be used in the third moveslot to trap special attackers with a weakness to Dark-type attacks, such as Victini and Azelf, but Umbreon's poor Attack makes this ineffective. Moonlight can be used to instantly restore HP, but it detracts from Umbreon's role as a team supporter. Umbreon should be paired with Pokemon that resist the Fighting-type attacks that are often aimed at it. Crobat is one of the safest switches into the common Fighting-types of the tier, Heracross and Mienshao. Defensive Ghost-types like Sableye and Cofagrigus also counter Fighting-types effectively and can drain the offensive pressure Fighting-types put on Umbreon. Slowbro and Mew can check Fighting-types, but they also lose to Heracross, one of the biggest threats in the tier. Using Umbreon alongside a Fighting-type of your own is also effective, as Steel-types such as Cobalion and Bisharp may try to take advantage of their Dark-type resistance to start a sweep, and the former can even gain an attack boost via Justified if it switches into Foul Play. Heracross is a good partner as it can provide some much needed offensive pressure for Umbreon's team.</p> "

However, there are a few specially offensive threats in UU, most notably Kingdra, that make Slowking worth looking into. With a specially oriented EV spread, Slowking becomes one of the most foolproof Kingdra switch-ins in the tier, and can also provide a reliable answer to Azelf, Nasty Plot Mew, offensive Nidoqueen, and Nidoking.</p> <p>Aside from the ability to tank such powerful moves as Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Kingdra, Dragon Tail is the one useful thing Slowking has over Slowbro. Phazing is one of the most traditional, and fundamental strategies of bulky Water-types--handy for blowing away enemies untroubled by their lower powered attacks, and critical against foes with means of getting around status like the aforementioned Kingdra. While Slowbro's lack of a phazing attack sometimes leaves it a liability, Slowking excels in utility where it lacks in physical brawn.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Many of Slowking's alternative options are done better by Slowbro, whose physical bulk makes it a better fit for the metagame. However, it does receive several moves, such as Trick Room and Nasty Plot, that Slowbro does not, which it can use effectively, both separately and together. Slowking can also take a more offensive approach by utilizing Choice Specs along with a moveset of Surf, Psyshock, Grass Knot, and Fire Blast, but again, its more physically defensive cousin does this job better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Countering Slowking is all about knowing which set it's running; even though its not very threatening offensively, it could easily cripple a few of your Pokemon if you let it. The physically defensive set shares many of its checks with Slowbro. Specifically, Shaymin and Roserade make excellent counters, especially if Slowking lacks a coverage move. Raikou can switch in as long as it avoids status, and proceed to set up with Substitute and possibly even Calm Mind. Zapdos also dislikes status, but it can demolish Slowking with its obscenely strong STAB Thunderbolt. More specially defensive variants of Slowking might take you by surprise by being able to tank a Thunderbolt or Seed Flare though, so you have to be careful. Heracross is another excellent check, as it can switch in relatively easily and destroy Slowking with its powerful Megahorn. Toxic Spikes are also a huge thorn in Slowking's side, as they prevent it from staying in for prolonged periods of time, and ensure it won't be able to stall out any of your Pokemon.</p> ",

Instead, it trades this physical bulk for access to Dragon Tail and the ability to take on powerful special attackers which Slowbro cannot. Scald is Slowking's obligatory STAB move; it deals consistent damage and has a handy 30% burn rate. Dragon Tail is one of the main reasons to use Slowking over Slowbro, and is very useful for those free turns where Slowking forces a switch. It also throws out foes like Suicune, Kingdra, or Togekiss that use moves like Rest or Heal Bell to get rid of status as they boost. Slack Off provides additional recovery in case Regenerator is not enough. Thunder Wave spreads paralysis for Slowking's teammates to take advantage of, and allows it to cripple many of the Pokemon it'll be switching into.</p> <p>The given EVs and nature allow Slowking to always break 4/0 Kingdra's Substitutes with Dragon Tail, and then maximize Slowking's physical bulk. Psyshock is a decent alternative in the fourth moveslot, as it gives Slowking a means of badly injuring the common Roserade. Specifically, it OHKOes offensive variants and does upwards of 80% to defensive ones. As another alternative, Fire Blast hits several common switch-ins to Slowking, namely Shaymin and Roserade, decently hard, and also maims threats such as Cobalion and Escavalier. It's worth noting that you should never even consider forgoing Dragon Tail on this set, otherwise you'll literally be using a statistically inferior Slowbro.</p> <p>Although it might seem as though Slowking can take on offensive behemoths such as Life Orb Darmanitan and Choice Band Victini, it simply does not have the physical bulk to do so. Instead, this Slowking is meant to provide utility, and abuse Regenerator to scout against a wide variety of threats and handle them jointly with the appropriate teammates. Rhyperior thus makes an excellent partner to this set, as it can easily defeat the aforementioned threats, take advantage of the paralysis Slowking spreads, and lay down Stealth Rock for Slowking to take advantage of with Dragon Tail. Escavalier is another great partner to this set as it can take advantage of paralyzed opponents, easily switch into and take out Roserade with Pursuit, and tank Kingdra's Draco Meteor so that Slowking doesn't have to.</p> "

This set steers away from the traditional role of bulky Water-types as physical tanks, and instead opts to check special attackers such as Nidoking and Azelf. Dragon Tail is vital for this purpose, as it allows Slowking to phaze away Dragon Dance Kingdra; phazing is generally useful to have as well. Scald gives Slowking a reliable STAB move with a handy 30% burn rate, which helps patch up its weaker defensive stat. Slack Off gives Slowking greater staying power and keeps it healthy throughout the game, while Thunder Wave spreads paralysis for Slowking's teammates to take advantage of. Alternatively, Fire Blast provides good coverage as it fends off Grass-type switch-ins by hitting Shaymin and Roserade for about 50%. At the same time, it gives Slowking a good move to combat other dangerous threats, such as Escavalier and Cobalion.</p> <p>The given EVs guarantee Slowking can accomplish the following things: survive any two consecutive Dragon attacks from all special Kingdra after accounting for Stealth Rock and one round of Leftovers, break 4/0 Kingdra's Substitutes with Dragon Tail, and survive +1 Outrage from maximum Attack Kingdra after Stealth Rock. If Slowking is instead hit with an unboosted Outrage on the switch-in, it will be 2HKOed, but thanks to Regenerator, it can switch out to a Steel-type and regain most of the lost HP. It's worth noting that even with a Speed-hindering nature, Slowking still outspeeds Escavalier, which allows Slowking to roast it with Fire Blast before it can move. Slowking can also opt to run Psyshock in the fourth moveslot for a good secondary STAB; as it hits Roserade super effectively on its weaker defensive stat, Psyshock discourages it from switching in.</p> <p>Keep in mind that this set fills a completely different niche to the typical bulky Water-type, and should be sure to steer clear of powerful physically offensive behemoths, such as Darmanitan and Flygon. Because of this, Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Bronzong, who can take on the aforementioned threats, make for excellent partners. Offensively, Pokemon that appreciate the paralysis support Slowking provides are also good partners. Machamp is one such Pokemon, and as a bonus, it will gladly switch into Bug-type attacks, such as Megahorn, aimed at Slowking.</p> "

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>Blessed with a base 125 Attack stat and two great abilities in Guts and Moxie, Heracross is a wrecking ball that can demolish unprepared teams. Heracross's famous dual 120 Base Power STAB moves, Close Combat and Megahorn, are a big part of what makes this stag beetle so dangerous. Heracross has always been one of the best revenge killers in the UU metagame, and now with Moxie it has become one of the best late-game sweepers too. From a Choice Scarf set to a Swords Dance set, Heracross has a large amount of options for a Pokemon that only hits physically. However, a middling base 85 Speed and a dependence on the inaccurate Stone Edge for coverage mean this wrecking ball will sometimes come up short. Nevertheless, Heracross is one of the biggest threats in the UU tier and is to be underestimated at your own peril.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heracross can run a classic RestTalk set from the days of old, utilizing a more defensive spread, but it is less effective than the other sets listed. For those who don't want to use Swords Dance or Substitute but also don't want to get locked into one move, Heracross can run 4 attacks with a Toxic Orb or a Life Orb. Finally, Heracross can use Bulk Up with a defensive EV spread, but getting Bulk Up boosts is harder than getting Swords Dance boosts; Heracross can also use Bulk Up + RestTalk using Megahorn as its only attack, but due to the many Fighting-types and generally mediocre coverage, it won't get you very far.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although Heracross's hard counters are hard to come by, there are a few, along with quite a few checks. Heracross's best counter is Gligar; this ever-present thorn in Heracross's side can take anything that Heracross can dish out and nullify the damage with Roost, slowly wearing Heracross down. While Gligar gives Heracross trouble, it is also hard walled by Dusclops and Cofagrigus, whose Will-O-Wisp can cripple Heracross that use Moxie. Flying-types such as Zapdos, Crobat, and Yanmega can take Heracross's STAB attacks but get hit hard by Stone Edge. Nidoking and Nidoqueen resist all of Heracross's common moves except for Earthquake and can retaliate with a Sheer Force boosted Fire Blast. Qwilfish is another check to Heracross, resisting its STAB moves coupled with Intimidate to further weaken Heracross's attacks. Arcanine also has Intimidate to soften Heracross's blows, so physically defensive variants can check Heracross and hit back with a STAB Flare Blitz, but it must be wary of Stone Edge. Weezing can take anything that Heracross could care to dish out bar a +2 Facade with Guts activated and has Fire Blast to hurt Heracross with. With the Choice sets, prediction is the best counter. When all other options are gone, Heracross can be revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users such as Victini and Darmanitan.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Using a Choice Scarf, Heracross becomes one of the best revenge killers in the UU metagame, and with Moxie it can double as a potent late-game sweeper. Heracross's two powerful STAB moves, Close Combat and Megahorn, are part of the reason Heracross is such a wrecking ball, being able to 2HKO most of the tier with just those moves. Stone Edge is a brilliant coverage move for Heracross, as it allows it to hit the pesky Flying-types such as Zapdos and Crobat that resist its STAB moves. While using Earthquake with Close Combat might seem redundant due to their similar coverage, it actually hits Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Qwilfish, all of which don't mind tanking hits from the other three moves on this set. However, by employing Sleep Talk over Earthquake, Heracross can absorb Sleep-inducing moves from Pokemon such as Roserade, which is especially great when Heracross opts to use Guts. Keep in mind, however, that in order for this to work, you not only need to run into a Sleep inducer, but predict when the move will be used and give up Earthquake's coverage, so it's in your best interest to weigh the pros and cons carefully.</p> <p>Heracross's EVs are dumped into Attack and Speed for maximum damage output and Speed. While an Adamant nature provides some extra power, a Jolly nature gives Heracross the Speed to outpace Adamant Choice Scarf Darmanitan and Krookodile. Pursuit is an option on this set to trap weakened Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Azelf and Victini, but it is a horrible move to get locked into in the current metagame due to the plethora of Fighting-types. Night Slash can be used to hit the bulky Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus and Golurk that would normally wall it, but they are quite uncommon in UU so the opportunity cost might not be worth it. Aerial Ace may seem like an odd choice, but it could come in handy against opposing Heracross.</p> <p>Moxie is generally the preferred ability on the Choice Scarf set as it allows Heracross to keep on garnering boosts, making it more efficient as a late-game sweeper, but Guts can also be used, not only benefiting from status but getting an Attack boost from a burn that would normally cripple it. Heracross is a great partner for Victini because it is capable of taking out its two counters: Snorlax and Porygon2. Heracross appreciates a teammate to take out Gligar as it is completely walled by it; bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Milotic are good for this job. Cofagrigus and Golurk also give Heracross trouble, so Pokemon such as Shaymin, who can give both of them a great deal of trouble, make for good partners.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Heracross has access to Swords Dance, one of the best boosting moves in the game, and can make use of it to become a fearsome sweeper against slower teams. Megahorn and Close Combat are dangerous to most of the metagame unboosted, and at +2 almost nothing can withstand them. Stone Edge is the best coverage move for Heracross as it clips the wings of pesky Flying-types that resist its STAB moves, such as Zapdos and Crobat.</p> <p>While the purpose of the given EVs is obvious, Heracross can also run a potent defensive Swords Dance set with an EV spread of 208 HP / 136 Atk / 20 Def / 144 Spe. Using Heracross's often-unexplored bulk and defensive typing, this set aims to check most Fighting-types in the metagame. Although this Heracross might appear to lack power, an Adamant nature and the aforementioned EV spread provides more power than 252 Attack EVs and a neutral nature. The speed given is enough to outspeed Adamant Honchkrow. The bulk really helps Heracross out, allowing it to survive revenge killing attempts from the likes of Flygon and Sharpedo; it even has the capacity to stand its ground against a Heat Wave from Life Orb Zapdos and retaliate with a powerful Stone Edge.</p> <p>An Adamant nature can be used for extra power, but a Jolly nature gets the jump on Timid Togekiss. Guts is the best ability on this set due to Heracross not being fast enough to properly take advantage of Moxie. Heracross finds it hard to sweep due to its lackluster Speed, but provides team support by destroying walls and aiding its teammates to sweep through the opponent's team; that said, if all Pokemon that outspeed Heracross are taken out and Heracross gets up a Swords Dance, it is nigh impossible to stop it. As with all offensive Pokemon, Heracross appreciates hazard support; with Stealth Rock up Heracross gets the guaranteed OHKO on both physically defensive Milotic and physically defensive Arcanine with a +2 Close Combat. Heracross can be used alongside Mienshao to beat your opponent's Fighting-type checks by simply overwhelming them. Paralysis support from teammates such as Slowbro and Togekiss is also worth some serious consideration, as when used properly, can open up opportunities for Heracross to sweep faster teams.</p> <p>Leftovers is typically used to give Heracross some longevity in the face of the defensive teams it's meant to break. However, you may opt to use a Toxic Orb instead and Facade over Stone Edge to give Heracross enough power to absolutely destroy the entire UU metagame, but this sacrifices any semblance of longevity Heracross could ever hope to maintain and is typically not worth it, as Swords Dance alone already provides it with enough power to beat even the mightiest of physical walls, Gligar.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>A Choice Band further improves Heracross's amazing Attack stat, allowing to destroy almost everything without the need to set up. STAB Close Combat and Megahorn give Heracross great coverage and incredible power to go with the Choice Band. Stone Edge is by far the best coverage move for Heracross, hitting most of the Pokemon that resist its STAB moves super effectively. Sleep Talk helps both Heracross and your team against sleep-inducers, turning Heracross into a sleep absorber that can fire off Guts-boosted attacks. However, Earthquake can be used over Sleep Talk to get powerful hits on Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Qwilfish; although none of them will enjoy Choice Band boosted hits from its other moves anyway.</p> <p>The EVs give Heracross the most Attack and Speed it can achieve. Pursuit is an option to trap Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Azelf and Mismagius, but it is not a good move to get locked into, and if your opponent knows Heracross is holding a Choice Band, they may very well stay in and beat Heracross rather than switching out. Night Slash hits Ghost-types such as Golurk and Cofagrigus hard but has little use otherwise.</p> <p>Guts is the superior ability on this set because Heracross isn't fast enough to take advantage of Moxie and Guts gives it a huge boost if it manages to get statused. However, Moxie has its merits if you pair Heracross with a teammate that can take care of or paralyze faster threats, such as Togekiss. Any teammates that benefit from the removal of Porygon2 and Snorlax, such as Victini and Raikou, can benefit from Heracross's presence on the team. Gligar, the ever present thorn in Heracross's side, hard walls Heracross even with the boost from Choice Band, so a bulky Water-type such as Slowbro makes for a good partner.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of the many switches caused by Heracross to set up a Substitute and smash the switch-in with the appropriate move. Close Combat and Megahorn's coverage and power are the reasons why this set is viable, allowing Heracross to hit most of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Stone Edge hits most of the Pokemon that Close Combat and Megahorn do not hit very hard. If you manage to set up a Substitute late-game, Heracross has a clear shot at sweeping a weakened team as the Moxie boosts stack.</p> <p>The EVs are tailored for maximum damage output and Speed. An Adamant nature can be used to achieve more power, but a Jolly nature allows Heracross to jump the gun on Timid Togekiss. Heracross can use a Salac Berry over Leftovers to pick up a Speed boost late-game, further aiding its sweeping capabilities. It can also use an Expert Belt to bluff a Choice item and give it a bit more power if it's hitting a foe super effectively. Focus Punch can be used over Close Combat to recreate the classic SubPunch strategy; while it's not as reliable since it's not always guaranteed that you'll have a Substitute up, it brings immense power to the table.</p> <p>When using this Heracross set it's advised to have Rapid Spin support, as the set hates entry hazards, especially Spikes. It is absolutely necessary to have a teammate to take out Gligar lest Heracross become dead weight on your team. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Slowbro are best suited for this role. Blastoise can also do this job and has the added advantage of providing Rapid Spin support. Like Gligar, Golurk and Cofagrigus also need to be taken out; Weavile is a good teammate for this job. Guts and Toxic Orb in conjunction with Substitute throws all hopes of longevity out of the window, but if you manage to get a Substitute up, Heracross can wreck the opponent's team while they try to break the Substitute.</p> "

  "Houndoom": {
    "overview": "<p>Although it might seem like it doesn't pack enough power, Houndoom is still a viable Pokemon to use in the tier. Its unique typing and its amazing ability in the form of Flash Fire provide Houndoom with an amazing offensive STAB combination, and gives it the ability to resist or be immune to Victini's STAB moves and proceed to either trap it with Pursuit or strike first with Sucker Punch. It also has access to stat boosting moves such as Nasty Plot, which doubles Houndoom's Special Attack in a pinch, making it a force to be reckoned with. It also has decent offensive stats: 90 / 110 / 95 is a gift for Houndoom, giving it a bit more unpredictability due to the ability of going mixed or purely specially offensive. 95 base Speed is a benchmark that guarantees Houndoom will outspeed Heracross, Roserade, and Nidoking, threatening them all with its STAB moves, although it gets outpaced by the common base 100 Speed Pokemon running around in the tier, such as Shaymin, Zapdos, and Flygon. It also has access to priority moves such as Sucker Punch, meaning it can stand up to powerful threats and strike before them or score a quick revenge kill. However, Houndoom has a very limited and effective movepool, almost reduced to its STAB moves. Moreover, it is extremely frail, thus going down easily to a super effective move. In addition, Houndoom is weak to the most common types present in the tier. Despite its flaws, with the correct support, Houndoom can still punch holes in the opponent's team if they don't pack a safe check.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Houndoom has a niche in the metagame, outspeeding Heracross, the most common Pokemon in the tier, and outpaces every Pokemon not running a Choice Scarf and hits them with its unique STAB combination. A Sunny Day set alongside Solar Beam can also be used to increase Houndoom's Fire-type power while having a superior option to deal with Water-types. Flame Charge increases Houndoom's Speed by one stage, fixing its middling Speed problem. However, that is going to take a slot on its moveset, meaning Houndoom will lose some offensive coverage in the process. Will-O-Wisp has a certain surprise factor, burning the opponent when they expect an offensive move. Magic Coat is even more uncommon and its main use is to bounce back entry hazards and status inflicting moves, both very threatening to Houndoom. Foul Play is a powerful Dark-type physical move that can be used over Crunch, but it relies on the opponent's Attack stat, so Crunch is generally better. A combination of Rest with its ability Early Bird is Houndoom's only way of recovering its health, but Houndoom will often be unable to take any hits in the first place.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types are and always will be Houndoom's worst nightmare. Pokemon such as Suicune, Blastoise, and Milotic can all take one hit and retaliate with a super effective Water-type move. Snorlax is a very viable choice to deal with Houndoom; it resists Houndoom's Fire-type STAB thanks to its Thick Fat ability and takes close to nothing from Houndoom's other moves, all the while dealing massive amounts of damage with Body Slam or straight knock Houndoom out with Earthquake. Porygon2 can trace Houndoom's Flash Fire to make its Fire-type STAB moves useless and then it can proceed to take Dark Pulses and either inflict status on Houndoom or go for a more offensive approach in the form of Tri Attack or Discharge. Hitmontop can take most of Houndoom's attacks and strike back with Close Combat, or \"outspeed\" and OHKO with Mach Punch. Azumarill can wash away Houndoom with an Aqua Jet. Arcanine can also sponge any of Houndoom's Fire-type moves and pose a threat with both Close Combat and Extreme Speed. Due to Houndoom's middling Speed, it is very vulnerable to revenge killing. Faster Pokemon or Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Mienshao, and Darmanitan can OHKO Houndoom with Earthquake, High Jump Kick, and Superpower, respectively.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>While Houndoom doesn't have a stellar Attack stat, it's still perfectly capable of functioning as a powerful mixed attacker. Being immune to Psychic-type moves is a huge bonus for Houndoom and this set makes use of that factor. With Pursuit in its arsenal, Houndoom becomes the ultimate threat to Mismagius and Psychic-types, such as Azelf, Meloetta, Xatu, Mew, and Victini, trapping them when they think they can safely switch out. However, we all know that Pursuit is not that strong if the opponent decides to stay in. That's where Sucker Punch kicks in: it not only fixes Houndoom's middling Speed, but also creates an intense mindgame alongside Pursuit where mispredicting will end up badly for the opponent. Fire Blast is Houndoom's best option as a Fire-type STAB move and hits very hard, even without heavy investment, taking out threats such as Heracross and Roserade. Crunch is a more consistent Dark-type attack when compared to Pursuit and Sucker Punch which eases prediction, whereas Hidden Power Grass hits bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, Blastoise, and Milotic, for super effective damage and destroys Rhyperior and Swampert, who are both taking close to nothing from any of Houndoom's other attacks.</p> <p>Since Houndoom is not going to be taking physical hits and it needs its Special Attack stat, Hasty nature is preferred to raise Houndoom's Speed to the max. It already has a decent Special Attack, so the remaining EVs are mainly allocated into Attack to take full potential of most of the moves listed. In the last slot, Dark Pulse can be used over Crunch to make sure Houndoom packs a Dark-type STAB move which hits on the special side. Overheat can be used over Fire Blast for more immediate power, but it often requires a switch when it needs to strike again with the same move. This problem is further compounded by the fact that Houndoom is vulnerable to every kind of entry hazard and has a weakness to Stealth Rock. Therefore, Rapid Spin support is highly recommended. Hitmontop can take on Fighting- and Rock-type Pokemon due to its defensive typing and Intimidate, and Blastoise can take hits from Water-types and put up a threat to Rock-types like Rhyperior. Entry hazard support is also advisable in order to make some KOs possible, mainly Victini. For this reason, Stealth Rock plays a huge role in Houndoom's sweep. Bronzong and Swampert are good partners. Roserade is also a good option, as it beats Water-types with ease and sets up Spikes.</p> "

With this move, Houndoom reaches 638 Special Attack at +2, which means it's going to hit hard no matter what. Fire Blast is Houndoom's Fire-type move of choice. Dark Pulse is Houndoom's strongest Dark-type move and it also gives a 20% chance of flinching your opponent. Both moves combined provide Houndoom with a very good offensive coverage, only resisted by opposing Houndoom and Sharpedo. Hidden Power Fighting strikes both resisters, Porygon2, and Snorlax hard, whereas Hidden Power Grass is there for bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Blastoise, and Milotic plus hitting Rhyperior on the spot.</p> <p>The EV spread is pretty straightforward: Special Attack and Speed are maximized to increase Houndoom's sweeping potential as much as possible. If you are looking to use Houndoom as an effective stallbreaker, Taunt can be used in the last slot to shut down status inducing moves and Substitute users. Rapid Spin support is mandatory: both Hitmontop and Blastoise are good options, the former takes care of Rock- and Fighting-types while the latter faces Water-types and Rhyperior better. Stealth Rock and Spikes are also important for Houndoom, as they weaken the opponent's team very quickly to the point where Houndoom can come in after setting up and clean up the remaining Pokemon of the opponent's team without too much effort. Bronzong, Swampert, and Roserade fit this role perfectly.</p> "

A lot of Kingdra's lethality is due to its ability to use Rain Dance, doubling its Speed thanks to Swift Swim, as well as Dragon Dance, boosting both Kingdra's Attack and Speed stats, two highlights in a shallow movepool. These two moves allow Kingdra to outspeed much of the UU tier and sweep with a powerful STAB combination resisted only by Empoleon, giving Kingdra a place as one of the most dangerous sweepers in the tier. Kingdra is a Pokemon you must prepare for if you want a successful UU team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Hidden Power Electric wherever applicable to ensure a super effective hit on Ferroseed along with a super effective hit on Empoleon. However, Ferroseed's usage is fairly low, and should not warrant that much attention. Ice Beam can be used to hit Grass-and Flying-types hard, but the coverage offered alongside its Dragon-type STAB is relatively redundant. Kingdra is capable of running a mixed set consisting of Outrage, Draco Meteor, Waterfall, and Hydro Pump, but splitting its offenses is generally not recommended. Kingdra could run a Choice Band set of Outrage, Waterfall, Return, and Iron Head, but Flygon is a better Choice Band user, as its movepool supports a Choice Band better than Kingdra's does. A support set with moves such as Yawn, Clear Smog, and Scald is possible, as Kingdra has the bulk to pull it off, but lacks viable recovery.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Flygon is one of the most capable checks to Kingdra, as it threatens variants below +2 Speed, easily outspeeding and KOing with Outrage. Both Empoleon and Ferroseed hard counter any sets lacking Hidden Power Electric or Fighting, respectively, and the former can phaze Kingdra while the latter can set hazards up on it. Toxic Spikes can limit Kingdra's staying power and force it to use Rest prematurely, making it easier to break down; Roserade and Qwilfish can set them up. Strong attacks from faster Pokemon, such as Superpower from Choice Scarf Darmanitan, put a hefty dent in Kingdra's HP, making it vulnerable to priority moves. Milotic and Cofagrigus have the bulk to take on just about anything Kingdra can throw at it while recovering any damage taken with Recover or Pain Split, and Hazing away boosts, however the latter will not want to be taking a Draco Meteor or Hydro Pump. Specially attacking sets, bar the Choice Specs set to a certain extent, are shut down by the likes of Snorlax and Porygon2. Arguably the most reliable check for a setup Kingdra, Imposter Ditto, can use Kingdra's boosts against it, outspeed it, and revenge kill it with its own attacks, but if Kingdra is behind a Substitute, it will die before it can KO.</p> ",

With new status inducers such as Amoonguss, and constant threats such as Sableye and Xatu becoming increasingly popular in the tier, the use of Substitute gives Kingdra more than enough time to set up and become a powerhouse. While behind a Substitute, Kingdra can use Dragon Dance to increase its Attack and Speed. With the EV distribution, two Dragon Dances will ensure that Kingdra outspeeds the entire tier, leaving it free to smash the opponent with Waterfall or Outrage, both of which are powerful STAB moves that gain near perfect coverage throughout the tier, with only Empoleon and Ferroseed resisting the combination.</p> <p>If you don't fear status and are willing to rely on Substitute alone to block it, Leftovers may be used over a Lum Berry to recover Kingdra's HP. Sniper is a viable option over Swift Swim because Rain Dance teams are fairly scarce in the Underused tier. This allows Kingdra to basically guarantee an OHKO with a critical hit because the multiplier is boosted from 2x to 3x. However, while Rain Dance teams are scarce in UU, Rain Dance Kingdra is not, so using Sniper over Swift Swim means you don't Speed tie with opposing Kingdra in rain. As Empoleon is the number one go-to check to Kingdra in the Underused tier, Kingdra appreciates having it removed by Electric- or Fighting-type partners such as Raikou or Heracross, respectively. Entry hazard support from Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzong is also appreciated, as it breaks any potential Focus Sashes and allows for more collective damage to be spread if Kingdra should ever find itself unboosted or at +1. Rapid Spin support from Cryogonal or Hitmontop is vital for this set if Lum Berry is being used, as Kingdra's HP will be in low supply as it is, and won't want to be losing 37% of its overall HP upon switching in.</p> "

Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor are the STAB moves that are going to be generally spammed, as the two of them gain near perfect coverage throughout the tier.

The same goes for Empoleon, who is the number one hard counter to this set, as it has very good Special Defense and resists both of Kingdra's STABs. A strong Electric- or Fighting-type such as Raikou or Heracross respectively, are great teammates to help Kingdra out with Empoleon.

While setting up both moves in one match is often unfeasible, it allows you to pick and choose which move will give you the best chance at sweeping. In addition, this set acts as an effective lure for some Pokemon; when Kingdra uses Rain Dance, Pokemon such as Snorlax who are sent in because they are good checks to special Rain Dance will instead get destroyed by this set's physical attacks. It's much more immediately powerful than other sets, especially the ChestoRest set, but is much more vulnerable to status. The Speed boosts from both Rain Dance and a Dragon Dance leave Kingdra nigh impossible to keep up with, and priority moves are one of the few options for damaging this set. After a Rain Dance and a single Dragon Dance, Waterfall becomes a very devastating move, crushing anything that doesn't resist it. Much goes the same for Outrage, obliterating anything that isn't a Steel-type. Draco Meteor is a viable option over Rain Dance, as even with no investment, it will still be heavily damaging Pokemon like Slowbro or other physically defensive Pokemon that can stomach an Outrage or two.</p> <p>If using Draco Meteor over Rain Dance, a Lonely or Naughty nature should be used so it can hit as hard as possible without investment. Sniper is a viable option over Swift Swim if Rain Dance is not being used, powering up Kingdra's critical hits. Prankster Sableye is a major issue for this set, and appreciates having a strong sweeper immune to Will-O-Wisp such as Victini or Darmanitan remove it. This variant of Kingdra pairs well with another cleaner, such as Choice Scarf Moxie Heracross, as it will tear holes in the opposing team, leaving Heracross to quickly pick up the pieces and gain Attack boosts.

Hydro Pump functions similarly as a powerful STAB move, but doesn't suffer from the drop in Special Attack like Draco Meteor does. Dragon Pulse is a powerful backup STAB move that can be used to pick off weakened opponents instead of wasting Kingdra's Special Attack stat to Draco Meteor. Hidden Power Electric is a handy coverage move that deals considerable damage to the bulky Water-types in the tier and the occasional Flying-type that Kingdra finds itself up against, but unless they resist Draco Meteor, two Hidden Powers will always be outdamaged by two Draco Meteors. Surf is an acceptable STAB option over either Hydro Pump or Hidden Power Electric, being used much how Dragon Pulse is, which is to damage opponents while preserving Hydro Pump's low PP or if you can't afford a miss.</p> <p>Because of the scarcity of Rain Dance throughout the Underused tier, Sniper is a perfectly usable option over Swift Swim, boosting up Kingdra's critical hits to absurdly powerful levels. A Timid nature may be used to tie other positively natured base 85 Speed Pokemon, such as Nidoking or Heracross, but will see a hefty drop in overall power. Signal Beam may be used over Dragon Pulse or Hidden Power Electric to gain additional coverage on Pokemon such as Shaymin or Azelf, but is generally not recommended as the STAB Draco Meteor will be hitting harder. Because of its power, this set doesn't need to rely on having special walls removed, rather just weakened. All variants of Porygon2 are 2HKOed by Hydro Pump, and Snorlax takes around 40% from Hydro Pump. Entry hazard support from Rhyperior and Qwilfish is still appreciated, as it turns many 2HKOs into OHKOs.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With status moves being in high supply in the Underused tier, a ChestoRest set greatly aids Kingdra in pulling off a sweep. The goal of this set is to accumulate as many boosts as possible, use Rest to heal whatever damage or status Kingdra may have taken, then begin smashing your opponent. This set excels late-game when most Steel-types are weakened or removed, and other strong threats are out of play, but can be used early on to open holes for other sweepers. Dragon Dance boosts Kingdra's Attack and Speed stats, turning it into a very capable sweeper, outspeeding the entire tier after two boosts. Backed by STAB, Waterfall and Outrage accumulate a lot of power after two or more Dragon Dance boosts, proceeding to OHKO or 2HKO nearly the entire tier. Rest, as mentioned, recovers HP and eliminates status, giving Kingdra a new lease on a sweep.</p> <p>Waterfall can be dropped for Sleep Talk so that Kingdra can gain additional opportunities to Rest and set up on Pokemon such as Slowbro, but this leaves Kingdra walled by Steel-types. Sniper can be used in place of Swift Swim simply because of how rare Rain Dance teams are and that the Speed boost may not be found; this powers up Kingdra's critical hits, decimating anything they touch. This set greatly appreciates having Empoleon and users phazing moves removed by powerful attackers such as Raikou or Heracross, as Empoleon walls this set cold and generally carries Roar, removing Kingdra's boosts. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Roserade and Bronzong is also greatly appreciated, as it weakens many of Kingdra's checks, and allowing for easier sweeps.</p> "

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>When someone takes the term \"bulky attacker\" too far, Porygon2 is the result. Although Eviolite allows it to achieve some of the best defensive stats in the game, it seems as though it were destined to use that bulk in a tanking role. As a supporter, its extremely shallow supporting movepool, lack of Leftovers recovery, and lack of resistances all work against it, but it can function as a very bulky utility counter nonetheless, especially if it gains a good ability with Trace. As an attacker, its good Special Attack and access to Normal / Ice / Electric coverage allow it to pose a significant threat to the opponent, even more so if it gains a boost through Download or Analytic. Opponents should do everything in their means to wear Porygon2 down, or to scare it off with powerful Fighting-type attacks, before it dishes out too much damage. Porygon2 might have failed at going to space, but it will certainly not disappoint in the more down-to-earth UU metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of the typical moves, Porygon2's movepool is rather redundant for attacking, and rather lacking for supporting. Shadow Ball can be used to fight Ghost-types, along with Hidden Power Fighting for Rock- and Steel-types. If Calm Mind users such as Suicune are a problem, Psych Up can be used to steal their boosts. Charge Beam can boost Special Attack, and is especially useful with Analytic, but the power loss against the usual targets of Discharge and Thunderbolt--namely Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune--should be considered. As it sports a mere 50 Base Power, Charge Beam only outdamages the other Electric-type moves at +2. Nonetheless, it is usable against defensive Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Porygon2 is generally weak to five things: gradual damage, Ghost-types, Steel-types, stat boosters with high Special Defense, and moves that remove its Eviolite (Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo).</p> <p>Gradual damage can come in many forms: Stealth Rock, Spikes, burn damage, Toxic damage, and even repeated attacks. Porygon2 has no Leftovers recovery to combat all this, causing its user's stylus or mouse cursor to twitch ever more nervously toward that Recover button. What's worse is that some Pokemon have enough special bulk to set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes on Porygon2 with little worry. These include the likes of Roserade and Scolipede.</p> <p>The obvious problem that Porygon2 has with Ghost- and Steel-types is that they resist Tri Attack, and many of them are not weak against its coverage moves. Porygon2 can do very little against Dusclops and Sableye. The former can remove 39% of Porygon2's health per turn with burn damage and Seismic Toss, stall out Porygon2's attacks with Pressure, and even run RestTalk to nullify Toxic. Sableye can also be a nuisance, as it combines Prankster with Recover, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp to kill off Porygon2 slowly. Registeel is immune to Toxic and can itself inflict Toxic on Porygon2; Empoleon is similar as even a Download-boosted Discharge does not 2HKO it.</p> <p>Porygon2 is setup bait for a handful of specially bulky sweepers. Mismagius is the most notable, as it is immune to Tri Attack and can set up on Porygon2 with both Substitute and Calm Mind. Cobalion also resists Tri Attack and can set up Swords Dance or Calm Mind boosts. Despite the fact that Tri Attack hits them neutrally, Raikou and Suicune are also great candidates, though the latter might want to tread carefully around Download-boosted Discharge. Snorlax can set up Curse on Porygon2, but without Curse, it has trouble doing much other than forcing Porygon2 out with Whirlwind.</p> <p>Of course, another option is just to smash Porygon2's face in with powerful Fighting-type attacks or moves boosted by Choice Band or Choice Specs. Choice Band Flygon is a good minimum here; even if Porygon2 is defensive and Flygon doesn't 2HKO it, Porygon2 cannot just attack it with Ice Beam, as that will leave Porygon2 at low HP itself. Choice Band Escavalier is a fine candidate, while Victini does not even need a Choice Band to destroy Porygon2, as it can blast Porygon2 with a fairly accurate Focus Blast or smash it with a very powerful V-create. Darmanitan is also strong enough that even the Choice Scarf variant will send Porygon2 running for its programmer. Finally, Fighting-types such as Heracross, Hitmontop, and Machamp are obvious candidates for duck-breaking. Special attackers should also not be forgotten; Rotom-H's Overheat will definitely leave a dent, while Choice Specs-boosted attacks from Pokemon about as strong as Yanmega (or stronger) will also do the job with the help of residual damage. Check for Trace before sending in Houndoom or Arcanine; in the event that Porygon2 has Trace, aim Hidden Power Fighting or Close Combat at it.</p> <p>If all else fails, I heard that some Porygon2 stop functioning when you tell them that pi is exactly 3.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Porygon2 is one of the best tanks in UU thanks to its incredible bulk and the firepower to back it up. A Download boost sends Porygon2's STAB Tri Attack above the power of Machamp's Dynamic Punch; while an Analytic boost is weaker, it still puts Tri Attack's power in the area of Swampert's Earthquake and Snorlax's Return. If such comparisons are not your cup of tea, perhaps a more direct approach will provide a clearer demonstration of Porygon2's destructive potential after a Download boost.</p> <ul> <li>Tri Attack vs. 252/0 Machamp 54.9% - 65.1% <li>Tri Attack vs. 4/0 Heracross 64.6% - 75.8%</li> <li>Tri Attack vs. 252/0 Hitmontop 56.3% - 66.4%</li> <li>Discharge vs. 252/4 Suicune 54% - 63.9%</li> <li>Discharge vs. 252/4 Slowbro 75.1% - 88.8%</li> <li>Discharge vs. 252/4 Blastoise 65.7% - 77.3%</li> <li>Discharge vs. 252/252 Empoleon 47.8% - 56.5%</li> <li>Ice Beam vs. 208/48 Rhyperior 52% - 61.22%</li> <li>Ice Beam vs. 252/136 Roserade 69.8% - 82.1%</li> <li>Ice Beam vs. 248/228 Zapdos 60.6% - 71.5%</li> </ul> <p>Even without much investment into Defense or Special Defense, Porygon2 is very difficult to take down, which forces the opponent to rely on persistently chipping away at its HP or using very powerful moves, particularly Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Heracross. Even switching into reasonably powerful attackers, such as Nidoking and Choice Scarf Flygon, is a piece of cake for Porygon2.</p> <p>Here is the lowdown on Download: just as it is important to watch what you download on the Internet, it pays to know what Porygon2 can switch into if it wants to grab that precious Special Attack boost. Slowbro, Nidoqueen, and Rhyperior are obvious targets, but there are more subtle examples; Nidoking has base 75 Special Defense, which is lower than its base 77 Defense. Some other UU Pokemon, such as Suicune and Blastoise, have roughly even defenses but are typically EVed to be physically defensive. Still others have exactly even defenses; while some more savvy players will know to invest a point into Special Defense to thwart Porygon2's downloading antics, many players neglect to do this. Of course, all of this fishing for specific targets can be avoided by using the more calculus-friendly Analytic for your power (series) expansion needs, though it misses some of the guaranteed 2HKOs demonstrated in the above damage calculations.</p> <p>The EVs are fairly straightforward. Porygon2 has little need to increase its Speed, but it needs investment in HP and Special Attack to make the magic happen. As mentioned earlier, both Download and Analytic have their drawbacks; Download grants more power but limits the targets that Porygon2 can switch into in order to grab a power boost. On the other hand, while Porygon2 is slow enough to use Analytic to good effect, a good number of Pokemon are slower still, and minimizing Speed means that Porygon2 is outrun by Machamp and Azumarill, who can massacre it with Dynamic Punch and Superpower, respectively.</p> <p>Some other considerations are worth making. As Analytic Porygon2 wants to be slower than the opponent, Thunderbolt is more appealing than Discharge; this also happens to compensate for the power loss relative to a Download-boosted Discharge. Trace is a decent alternative ability as well, if Flash Fire users such as Houndoom are a problem to the rest of the team.</p> <p>Despite all of the awesomeness that has been described, Porygon2 does have its weaknesses. Gradual damage from burn, Toxic, and entry hazards will take its toll, and force Porygon2 to use Recover. Ghost-types, Steel-types, and Calm Mind users are especially dangerous, as the former two resist Tri Attack while not being weak to Porygon2's coverage moves, and Calm Mind blunts Porygon2's damage as well. Snorlax can also comfortably wall Porygon2. Without a boost from Download or Analytic, some of the threats mentioned in the damage calculation list become more dangerous. Finally, there are some truly powerful enemies, such as Victini, Darmanitan, and Houndoom, as well as Fighting-types such as Heracross, Cobalion, Machamp, and Hitmontop, that can take huge chunks off of Porygon2, if not OHKO it.</p> <p>Entry hazards are great for helping Porygon2--especially the Analytic variant--secure some of its KOs. Roserade and Qwilfish are excellent for setting up Spikes as they resist Fighting-type attacks and are immune to Toxic, both of which are commonly used against Porygon2. Gligar is a great Stealth Rock user and a very good teammate, as its incredible physical bulk and Flying typing let it sponge the powerful physical attacks of UU, especially Fighting-type ones. Rhyperior, though it shares a Fighting-type weakness with Porygon2, is nonetheless a very good teammate, as it can set up Stealth Rock, lure in Slowbro and Suicune so that Porygon2 can switch into them, and do a number to most Steel-types. Using Rapid Spin to remove the opponent's entry hazards, or Magic Bounce to prevent them, is also worth considering. Blastoise, Hitmontop, and Xatu are good users of these; the first two are very hardy (Hitmontop even has Intimidate to sponge those usually physical Fighting-type moves), while Xatu doubly resists Fighting.</p> <p>Powerful attackers that resist Fighting synergize well with Porygon2 to help with the wallbreaking effort. Zapdos and Victini are good examples of such Pokemon; both can be very threatening thanks to their high Special Attack stats. Rotom-H does not resist Fighting but plays a similar role to Zapdos. However, all three falter against Snorlax. On the physical side, Heracross is ideal, as Guts allows it to benefit from switching into Will-O-Wisp from Sableye, Dusclops, and defensive Mismagius, and nearly OHKO Sableye even with Megahorn. Heracross can also deal with Snorlax. All of the aforementioned teammates can also deal with Steel-types.</p> <p>If Porygon2 uses Download, physical attackers can lure in physically defensive Pokemon. Fire-types such as Darmanitan, Arcanine, and Victini are ideal for this, as they lure in both Rhyperior and Slowbro.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive Duck",
        "description": "<p>This set takes Porygon2's immense bulk and makes it even more extreme. The goal of this variant of Porygon2 is to force switches and spread status by walling a wide variety of Pokemon. Its uninvested Special Attack stat and BoltBeam coverage are decent enough to maintain an offensive presence as well. Trace might sound like a stupid matrix operation, but it bolsters Porygon2's defensive capabilities by allowing it to \"borrow\" some great abilities from unsuspecting foes. Trace Magic Bounce to inflict Xatu with its own Toxic, or use Rhyperior's Solid Rock to sponge the attacks of its Fighting-type buddies more easily. Use Shaymin's Natural Cure to fix that time you switched into Toxic, or switch into the powerful Fire-type STABs of Houndoom and Arcanine by copying their Flash Fire.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Porygon2 take on many of the powerful physical attackers in UU, while increasing its Special Defense somewhat to help against special attackers. It is good to assume that Porygon2 will take about 25% in residual damage as it switches in and tries to counter a Pokemon, whether that be from Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes, three layers of Spikes, a combination of entry hazards and a small amount of damage, or any similar situation. After accounting for this 25%, Porygon2 avoids being 2HKOed by attacks such as Choice Band Azelf's Zen Headbutt, Leftovers Rhyperior's Earthquake, and Life Orb Ambipom's Low Kick. Furthermore, it is not 3HKOed by Crobat's Brave Bird, and better sponges Choice Scarf Honchkrow's Brave Bird. An alternative is to use a Calm nature with the same spread, which allows Porygon2 to avoid a 2HKO from powerful special attacks such as Choice Specs Slowbro's Psychic.</p> <p>Still, the EVs are fairly flexible and can be tailored to take on specific threats. A full-on physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe Bold helps Porygon2 completely wall and defeat Choice Band users such as Flygon and Krookodile, and also enables it to sponge all of Azumarill's attacks bar Superpower. Extra Special Defense is less useful, but a fully specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe Calm does let Porygon2 deal with Choice Specs Yanmega more effectively. Another possibility is a more mixed spread of 252 HP / 112 Def / 144 SpD Calm, which allows Porygon2 to survive the 2HKO from Mismagius's +2 Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>Porygon2 does have several disadvantages as a wall. Lack of Leftovers recovery is a huge thorn in Porygon2's side. Passive damage from sources such as Stealth Rock and Spikes slowly steal HP from Porygon2, and even weaker attacks leave their mark, however small. Worse still is that Porygon2 is setup bait against bulky Pokemon in general, Toxic Spikes users and Calm Mind users in particular. Taunt renders Porygon2 helpless as well; notable users include Crobat, Cobalion, and Mismagius. Because of all this, Porygon2 should be considered carefully and used as glue for a team that really needs it, rather than as a Pokemon to build a team around.</p> <p>That said, Nidoqueen, Gligar, and Qwilfish are great teammates defensively, as they laugh at most physical attacks--Fighting-type ones in particular--and can set up entry hazards. Nidoqueen can also break walls with its Sheer Force-boosted attacks. Roserade can switch into Fighting-type moves as well, but is frailer physically, making it a somewhat riskier choice. Nonetheless, it can use Dusclops, an opponent that Porygon2 can do virtually nothing to, as setup bait for Spikes. Roserade is also a good switch-in to Empoleon, another Pokemon that Porygon2 has issues with due to its high special bulk. Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce are certainly helpful as well; Xatu and Hitmontop are both good at taking Fighting-type moves, while Blastoise has good all-around bulk and should last a while.</p> <p>One can also look into more offensive teammates that can switch into Fighting-type attacks aimed at Porygon2, as well as powerful attacks like Rotom-H's Overheat. Cofagrigus, Golurk, and Mismagius are completely immune to Fighting-type moves, and can easily obliterate walls that Porygon2 cannot break, with the exception of Snorlax. Sweepers such as Azelf, Togekiss, Nidoking, and Zapdos can switch in on Fighting-type attacks with ease. It is also recommended to have a revenge killer in reserve, as several offensive powerhouses can break through Porygon2 if it has been weakened beforehand. Rhyperior can check Rotom-H while setting up Stealth Rock. In addition, it fares well against Snorlax and Darmanitan due to its titanic physical bulk and resistance to their STAB moves. Take caution, though, as it shares Porygon2's weakness to Fighting.</p> <p>Some other teammates can still be considered. Smeargle can set up whatever it wants to for its team, Spikes and Shell Smash being just two examples, and go to Porygon2 for defensive backup; in this case, the shared Fighting weakness hardly matters here due to Smeargle's frailty. Heracross can switch into Toxic or Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Sableye and Dusclops and proceed to wreck faces, while also dealing with Snorlax.</p> "

        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>The most notable setup move available to Porygon2 happens to fit this determined duck like a glove. Porygon2 is rather renowned for being an effective Trick Room supporter and attacker, thanks to good offensive prowess and the bulk to use Trick Room over and over again. Trick Room generally requires a lot of flexibility to use, which Porygon2 has; it can bomb the opponent with BoltBeam coverage, switch to a sweeper, or use hit-and-run tactics. To get a good idea of how dangerous Porygon2 can be, picture someone strapping a jet pack on Andre the Giant.</p> <p>All this said, having only two moveslots for attacks hurts considerably, as this set has to sacrifice either its STAB Tri Attack or one of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. Tri Attack is a strong STAB that, after a Download boost, exceeds even the power of Machamp's Dynamic Punch, and losing it will make Porygon2 less effective against some opponents, such as Rotom-H and Kingdra. On the other hand, ditching Ice Beam will leave Porygon2 less effective against Flygon and Rhyperior, while forgoing Thunderbolt makes Water-types such as Suicune a pain to take down.</p> <p>The typical \"offensive Trick Room\" spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD Quiet is great for Porygon2, but more defensive EVs are also viable in order to make Porygon2 a better supporter. Analytic is obviously off the table here as Porygon2 aims to go first, so feel free to use Download for power or Trace to better deal with such opponents as Arcanine and Houndoom.</p> <p>Some especially dangerous threats Porygon2 should be wary of include opposing Victini, whose V-create allows it to take advantage of Porygon2's Trick Room. Substitute users are naturally a huge pain as they burn precious Trick Room turns. Sableye is also a dangerous time-waster due to Prankster-boosted Will-O-Wisp and Recover.</p> <p>Fellow Trick Room users are a great help to keep Trick Room going. In particular, look for teammates that resist Fighting, such as Slowbro, Slowking, Victini, Dusclops, Cresselia, and Duosion. Slowbro in particular provides a great switch-in to opposing Victini's V-create, while allied Victini hardly cares about anything that Sableye throws out, other than perhaps Foul Play. Bronzong is also a good Trick Room user, as it only has one weakness. Slow, bulky powerhouses in general make great Trick Room sweepers. Rhyperior can also switch into and check Raikou, Rotom-H, and Victini (though all three could carry Hidden Power Grass or, in Victini's case, Grass Knot), as well as foil Substitute users with Rock Blast.</p> "

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Smeargle is one of the most curious and interesting Pokemon in UU. At first sight, its abysmal stats may make you wonder why anyone would ever use Smeargle. That question is answered by Smeargle's ability to learn almost every move in the game, which gives it a plethora of options and makes it incredibly difficult to counter. With a little skill, it can catch opponents completely by surprise. However, with minuscule Attack and Special Attack stats, Smeargle is often limited to using passive, non-attacking moves, leaving it vulnerable to Taunt. With its horrible defensive stats, almost any attack can OHKO or 2HKO Smeargle, and it won't be outspeeding much of the metagame either. At times, you may even wonder if you started the match with a score of 6-5! Despite this, by playing carefully and intelligently, Smeargle can become a blessing for your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Smeargle can literally use any and all sets that you can think of. Unfortunately, its horrible stats prevent it from doing most of them effectively. All viable alternative moves that the Spikes set could pull off are already listed under Additional Comments. Other Pokemon will often outclass Smeargle for the role of a certain set. For example, Smeargle could run a dual screen set, and while access to Spore gives it an advantage, Pokemon such as Uxie and Cresselia have much more bulk, and therefore do the job better. You are free to experiment by coming up with your own sets, but the two sets listed above are usually the best way to go.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>With its frail defenses, just about any Pokemon can OHKO or 2HKO Smeargle. However, almost every single Smeargle set you will encounter will use Spore, which can be detrimental to your team and is tricky to get around. One solution is to have a Pokemon who can use Taunt and is faster than Smeargle, such as Aerodactyl and Crobat. Taunt not only prevents Smeargle from using Spore, it also forces the painter out since it rarely carries an attacking move. Priority attacks can also screw Smeargle over. Hitmontop and Ambipom can destroy Smeargle's Focus Sash with Fake Out and then use a priority move for the kill. A more specialized solution would be to use Pokemon that do not mind Spore, such as RestTalk users or Pokemon with the Insomnia ability, such as Honchkrow. Otherwise, sacrifice your least valuable Pokemon to take the sleep and then send out another teammate to knock out Smeargle.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Despite being relatively slow, Smeargle's access to Spore makes it a reliable suicide spiker. This set is quite simple to use; simply send out Smeargle as your lead Pokemon. Focus Sash should prevent Smeargle from being knocked out on the first turn, so use Spore on the foe, and proceed to set up as many layers of Spikes as possible. If another Pokemon uses Taunt or a status move on Smeargle, however, then Smeargle might be forced to switch out. To remedy this, Magic Coat is listed to punish such Pokemon. Smeargle may also have time to set up additional hazards, such as Stealth Rock, as well. This reduces the need of having another Pokemon to set up Stealth Rock on your team, and with two different entry hazards on the foe's side, Smeargle's offensive teammates will have a field day. However, after using Spore and setting up a few layers of Spikes, Smeargle becomes a liability to your team. In order to maximize its usefulness, you may wish to use Endeavor over Stealth Rock on the fourth moveslot instead.</p> <p>Maximum Speed is used on this Smeargle to ensure that it can outspeed as many Pokemon as possible. Since this set is not carrying any offensive moves, it would be silly to invest EVs in Attack or Special Attack, so the remaining EVs go to Defense and HP. Do note that, although this set works great as a lead, it should never be brought out as a lead if you see that your opponent has Xatu on Team Preview, as Xatu can easily reflect Smeargle's attacks back at it with Magic Bounce.</p> <p>Spikes Smeargle can fit on just about any team, but it is best appreciated on heavy offense or bulky offense teams, who can net important OHKOs and 2HKOs with Spikes damage. However, this set must have a spinblocker to ensure that the foe does not use a Pokemon with Rapid Spin to eliminate your precious entry hazards. Golurk and Spiritomb are two very good options, as in addition to being bulky, the two can use their good offensive stats to threaten foes. If you wish to use an even bulkier spinblocker, then Eviolite Dusclops is your Pokemon. However, it must be noted that both Dusclops and Smeargle are completely shut down by Taunt. Smeargle also has a ton of alternate moves it can use on the fourth moveslot of this set. For example, you can run Toxic Spikes along with Spikes to destroy walls, Encore to prevent Smeargle from becoming setup bait, or Taunt to prevent Pokemon from phazing Smeargle out with Roar or Whirlwind.</p> "

Empoleon can Roar Ludicolo out and burn precious rain turns.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Ludicolo has a great movepool that is backed by a decent base 90 Special Attack. In the rain, his Speed is doubled, thanks to Swift Swim, and Hydro Pump--or Surf, but the power drop is really noticeable--becomes incredibly powerful by effectively gaining another STAB boost, which makes Ludicolo a very fast and powerful sweeper. The other moves are self-explanatory: Giga Drain is used for a second STAB and pseudo-recovery move, and Ice Beam is used because of its fantastic coverage alongside Ludicolo's STABs. Rain Dance is used in the last slot in order to change the weather and renew Swift Swim, but Rain Dance support from Damp Rock Uxie or Azelf is still recommended.</p> <p>The EV spread is very simple: max Speed to let Ludicolo outspeed most of the metagame under rain and max Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature is probably the better choice in order to hit harder, but a Timid nature lets Ludicolo outspeed positive-nature Choice Scarf base 109 Pokemon.</p> <p>This set appreciates entry hazards for breaking potential Focus Sashes and Pokemon with the Sturdy ability, while also assisting Ludicolo in getting more KOs. Donphan is a good partner for Ludicolo; not only do they have nice type synergy, but Donphan also helps by taking the physical hits that Ludicolo is not fond of and providing Rapid Spin support, adding to Ludicolo's survivability. Registeel can also fit the job of laying down Stealth Rock. It and Ludicolo have good synergy together, and Registeel can set up hazards and cripple opponents with status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, making Ludicolo's job easier.</p> <p>Special walls are always Ludicolo's worst nightmare. Registeel and Lanturn can take a hit and cripple Ludicolo with Thunder Wave, but for that to work, another Pokemon has to go down since they both get 2HKOed by Hydro Pump, and Hydro Pump + Giga Drain, respectively. Lanturn can be a good partner for Ludicolo, since she can absorb the opponent's Thunder Wave and, with rain set up, deal a lot of damage with Hydro Pump and Thunder.</p> "

Taking advantage of the best Attack boosting move in the game (and the only boosting move he learns other than Hone Claws), and Ludicolo's great movepool, this set can be very dangerous. It does need Rain Dance support though, since Ludicolo has no way of setting it up himself without Rain Dance because he requires a moveslot for a Swords Dance. Waterfall is the only decent physical Water-type move Ludicolo learns, so it's a must have. The choice between Seed Bomb and Bullet Seed is up to personal preference. Seed Bomb is a reliable move, but Bullet Seed can break Substitutes that your opponents set up in order to stall out your rain turns. Ice Punch can deal with common Pokemon that resist Ludicolo's STAB moves, but Rain Dance can help continue Ludicolo's sweep.</p> <p>The EV spread is pretty simple: max Speed allows Ludicolo to outspeed the large majority of the UU metagame in the rain and max Attack lets him hit as hard as possible. An Adamant nature seems to be the best option considering Ludicolo's not-so-great Attack stat, but Jolly lets Ludicolo outspeed Choice Scarf base 109 Speed Pokemon.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is a common need for sweepers in order to make their job easier, and Ludicolo is not an exception. Bronzong and Cobalion are solid partners for Ludicolo, as they both have nice synergy with him and can set up those entry hazards Ludicolo loves.</p> <p>Eviolite Dusclops and Ferroseed can work around this set pretty easily. Dusclops, with its amazing Defense stat and the boost from Eviolite, can take Ludicolo's hits with relative ease, and counter with a Will-O-Wisp, which makes Swords Dance Ludicolo completely useless, and recover some health with Pain Split or Rest. Ferroseed resists Ludicolo's dual STAB attacks, is neutral to Ice Punch, and can cripple Ludicolo with Thunder Wave, making his ability useless and making Ludicolo vulnerable to getting revenge killed.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Meet Ninjask: a Pokemon that, in the same vein as Billy Ray Cyrus, enjoyed a few brief moments in the spotlight before fading into relative obscurity. Unfortunately for Ninjask, the BW reunion tour isn't exactly sold out; while a massive base 160 Speed stat is still incredible, the BW UU metagame contains many irksome additions for the cicada. Nonetheless, with access to Substitute, Swords Dance, and of course, Baton Pass, Ninjask's limited but useful movepool allows it to perform virtually the same role it always has. Although some of Ninjask's signature toys (namely Speed Boost) were distributed among the needy, so to speak, Ninjask still stands as a zippity user of Baton Pass, capable of bugging even the smartest of opposition when played correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ninjask certainly has a dearth of options other than those listed. U-turn is an interesting move that completely contradicts the set, as Ninjask loses any boosts upon switching out. Ninjask receives STAB on Aerial Ace, but it is only better than X-Scissor situationally. Toxic could be employed to catch a bulkier Pokemon off guard as they switch in, but it struggles to find a place in the set. Hone Claws is almost always inferior to Swords Dance, and Final Gambit is a gimmicky option that has better users. Speaking of gimmicks, Ninjask could use a Mental Herb as a safeguard from Taunt, but since it can only benefit Ninjask once, it is really more of a minor annoyance to the opponent than anything.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ninjask's FireRed and LeafGreen Pokedex entry reads, \"This Pokemon is so quick, it is said to be able to avoid any attack.\" Unfortunately for the little guy, this couldn't be further from the truth. Ninjask struggles to pass any boosts at all when facing anything with Taunt. Priority-wielding Pokemon, such as Ice Shard Weavile, can become a real threat if you do not play your cards right. Bulkier walls are not to be dealt with by Ninjask; rather, it should Baton Pass to an actual threat as soon as possible. Perhaps the easiest way to counter Ninjask is through simply negating all of its hard work entirely; any form of phazing can quickly eliminate all the boosts Ninjask has racked up. Lastly, Shell Smash and Baton Pass is, in most ways, a superior strategy that allows the user to render any boosts Ninjask can attain as rather unsubstantial. Perhaps one day Ninjask will give birth to a teen-pop sensation, at which point it will find its way into the limelight once more.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>An old adage states, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Ninjask's absurd Speed allows it to set up on almost any Pokemon lacking Taunt. Swords Dance is vital to this set, as Speed Boost and Swords Dance work in conjunction to pass as many boosts to the next Pokemon as quickly as possible. Substitute is also an important move, as it allows Ninjask to attain more boosts in safety. Furthermore, passing a Substitute along with the boosts provided by Ninjask can often mean the difference between a swift victory and a wasted slot on the team. While Ninjask is not one to be sweeping, X-Scissor prevents it from becoming complete Taunt bait, and also may score a surprise kill if Ninjask can net a super effective hit. Protect is an option in the last slot, as it allows Ninjask to bypass Fake Out. While it does make Ninjask more vulnerable to Taunt in theory, it guarantees that Ninjask will be able to secure at least one Speed Boost and still Baton Pass to the next Pokemon in line safely.</p> <p>Focus Sash is the primary item, as it allows Ninjask to live at least one hit and then Baton Pass any boosts it accquired. However, if you do not intend to ever lead with Ninjask, Leftovers could possibly see some use, as it ensures Ninjask will be able to safely switch into Stealth Rock twice; it is still generally inferior to Focus Sash. The listed EV spread gives Ninjask maximum longevity and Attack while still outspeeding max Speed base 120s, such as Sceptile. Alternatively, 112 Speed EVs allow Ninjask to beat max Speed base 125 foes, namely Weavile, and 156 Speed EVs allow Ninjask to beat max Speed 130 Pokemon, specifically Crobat, Jolteon, and Aerodactyl. If you opt to use Protect over X-Scissor, an Impish nature should be used and the EVs in Attack should be transferred to Defense.</p> <p>Slower, more physically inclined sweepers that can benefit from both Speed Boost and Swords Dance are the best teammates. Rhyperior, Mamoswine, Azumarill, and Heracross are all fantastic candidates for this. Since Drought has been banned, Sunny Day could also be used in the last slot with the item Heat Rock. With a few Speed Boosts, Swords Dance, Sunny Day, and a Substitute, Victini becomes even scarier than before. Arcanine works in a similar way, but is generally inferior (though a Swords Dance-boosted Extreme Speed is pretty fearsome).</p> "

  "Hariyama": {
    "overview": "<p>Life has not been kind to this old-time sumo wrestler. No Guard Dynamic Punch Machamp severely limited Hariyama's OU usage in the DPP era; a generation later, the sheer number of Fighting-types introduced in BW has left it scrambling to hold its own, even in BW UU. When trying to abuse Guts, Hariyama faces competition from none other than the mighty Heracross, which boasts marginally higher Attack, an excellent secondary STAB, as well as significantly greater Speed, while Gallade and Gurdurr also make for excellent Bulk Up users thanks to their access to Drain Punch and priority. Hitmontop's utility in the form of Intimidate and Rapid Spin, Machamp's ability to inflict confusion, as well as Cobalion's superb set of resistances may also be preferred by certain teams. Nonetheless, Hariyama has two outstanding stats, Attack and HP, as well as two excellent abilities, namely Guts and Thick Fat. While the former grants it immense power and the ability to break through all bar the most dedicated of walls, the latter lets it comfortably check the users of powerful Ice- and Fire-type moves that pervade the tier, especially when utilizing Rest or Bulk Up to make itself virtually impossible to take down. As should be obvious, this wrestler is far from a washed-up has-been; whether you're looking for a parashuffler, a defensive pivot, or a wallbreaker on steroids, be sure to keep Hariyama in mind.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scroll through Hariyama's list of moves, and one that will likely catch your eye is Belly Drum. However, Hariyama entirely lacks the Speed to pull this off; while Bullet Punch mitigates this somewhat, it has extremely poor coverage, and bulky Water-types--Unaware Quagsire in particular--will easily throw a monkey wrench into Hariyama's work. Wherever you see Force Palm, you can consider Brick Break, Cross Chop, as well as Low Kick, but their disadvantages are: a less useful secondary effect, far worse accuracy, and greatly reduced reliability, respectively. Rock Slide can also replace Stone Edge if accuracy is a concern, but it's worth noting that the latter's main draw over Ice Punch is its higher Base Power. The Normal-type attack Smelling Salts, Hariyama's signature move, has 120 Base Power against a paralyzed target and can be utilized alongside Force Palm, but is gimmicky and largely ineffective. Other competitively viable moves in its moveset include Knock Off, Seismic Toss, and Toxic, but Hariyama's base 120 Attack is superb even without investment, so the listed options are generally superior. Perhaps the most feasible option not given a set is one that utilizes Hariyama's released Dream World ability, Sheer Force. However, Hariyama's most powerful attacks, Close Combat and Stone Edge, do not gain the 30% power boost, and moves that Hariyama must forgo include Thunder Punch and Fire Punch, which are Platinum-only tutor moves. Ice Punch, on the other hand, is legal on Sheer Force Hariyama, making a set of Close Combat / Ice Punch / Rock Slide / filler worthy of consideration.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Thanks to their immense bulk, usually augmented by access to reliable recovery, resistance to Fighting-type attacks, as well as super effective STAB moves, bulky Psychic-types are generally the best counters to Hariyama. While there are a multitude of these, including Cresselia and Uxie, Slowbro can be especially problematic as Regenerator makes it much harder to wear down over the course of a match. Taunt users play havoc with more defensive Hariyama variants by preventing them from using Sleep Talk, Bulk Up, or Substitute. Nidoqueen and Claydol are common Pokemon that resist both parts of Hariyama's standard attacking combination: Fighting- and Rock-type attacks; this duo and Gligar wall all Hariyama that do not run Ice Punch, and even some that do. Physically defensive behemoths such as Tangrowth and Zapdos can suffice in a pinch, with the latter being able to remove its weaknesses to Ice- and Rock-type moves by using a faster Roost. On the offensive side, Choice Band Crobat annihilates Hariyama with Brave Bird; however, it takes a massive amount of damage in doing so, and can only switch in on Close Combat. Tornadus does a number on Hariyama with its STAB Hurricane and Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics, while Togekiss can break through Hariyama if it gets lucky with Air Slash flinches. Due to its rather underwhelming Speed, Hariyama is also not too difficult to revenge kill; Choice Band Victini's V-create, Guts Swellow's Brave Bird, Alakazam's Psychic, and Choice Scarf Medicham's Psycho Cut are just a few of the attacks that will either OHKO Hariyama from full health, or with a little prior damage.</p> ",

        "name": "Guts",
        "description": "<p>Boasting a stellar base 120 Attack and the Guts ability, it should come as no surprise that Hariyama pulls off an offensive set best. Its execution couldn't be simpler: use Fake Out on Hariyama's first turn to activate Toxic Orb, and proceed to KO foes with STAB Guts Close Combat, an attack so powerful it 2HKOes even bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Blastoise, Suicune, and physically defensive Quagsire. Stone Edge provides powerful super effective coverage on the Flying-types that resist Close Combat, while Bullet Punch enables Hariyama to bypass its low Speed, allowing it to shave about a third of health off Choice Scarf revenge killers such as Flygon and Krookodile. Although the coverage Hariyama gains through the combination of Fighting- and Rock-type moves is by no means shabby, it admittedly isn't that great in the UU tier, where Claydol and Nidoqueen, which resist both moves, abound. Ice Punch is therefore an excellent alternative; not only does it give Hariyama perfect neutral coverage, it hits the aforementioned Claydol and Nidoqueen super effectively, and with Stealth Rock support and minor prior damage, achieves the OHKO on Eviolite Gligar. However, one ought to note that due to the STAB boost, Close Combat is more than twice as powerful as Ice Punch; therefore, Ice Punch is only the better option against Pokemon that both resist Fighting-type moves and are weak to Ice-type moves, such as Roserade and Nidoking, or that are doubly weak to Ice-type attacks, such as Flygon and the aforementioned Gligar.</p> <p>As is standard for an offensive Pokemon, Attack investment is maximized, with an Adamant nature taking full advantage of Hariyama's huge Attack stat. 84 Speed EVs allow Hariyama to outpace uninvested base 60 Speed Pokemon, such as Empoleon, Clefable, and Weezing, and the rest are invested into Defense for maximum bulk. The only other item worth considering is Flame Orb, which does less damage than Toxic Orb if Hariyama stays in for 4 turns or more. However, especially without investment, Hariyama isn't the bulkiest Pokemon around, and due to its mediocre Speed, it tends to function as more of a hit-and-run attacker.</p> <p>While most other bulky Water-types are 2HKOed by Close Combat, Slowbro is the bane of this set; it resists Close Combat and takes a pittance from Stone Edge, is not easily worn down due to Slack Off and Regenerator, and can pick off Hariyama with STAB Psychic. Roserade packs a powerful STAB Leaf Storm and can also lay Toxic Spikes, which drastically reduce Slowbro's walling capability. If their shared weakness to Psychic-type moves is problematic, however, Shaymin and Rotom-C are alternative sources of strong Grass-type attacks, and the latter can also pose a terrible annoyance with Volt Switch. Heracross is another excellent switch-in to Slowbro. It can take advantage of the opportunity to fire off a powerful Close Combat or Megahorn, and it can furthermore work in tandem with Hariyama to wear down their common counters, opening the way for one of them to sweep. While they are less common, bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Uxie, Cresselia, Dusclops, and Spiritomb can also prove problematic to take down. Strong Ghost- or Dark-type attackers can easily patch up this weakness; Weavile, Spiritomb, Krookodile, and Honchkrow pack powerful Pursuits, while Mismagius and Houndoom can take advantage of the forced switch to set up a Nasty Plot boost and wreak havoc.</p> "

        "description": "<p>If the previous set aimed to make full use of Hariyama's base 120 Attack, this set strives to do the same for its highest stat, HP, by turning Hariyama into an immense thorn in the opponent's side. Hariyama's immense bulk means it is not easily knocked out. Its Thick Fat ability also makes it an excellent check to Fire-type attackers. Force Palm's lovely secondary effect enables Hariyama to spread paralysis, while Whirlwind prevents foes boosting up on it and shuffles the opponent's team around, racking up entry hazard damage. Rest, while not the ultimate recovery move, is the best form of regaining health Hariyama can muster. It's far from terrible, though; Sleep Talk bypasses Whirlwind's negative priority, allowing it to phaze out slower foes without taking damage.</p> <p>Unlike most other walls, EV investment in Hariyama's HP is minimal--just enough to give it a Leftovers number--because its HP stat is enormous relative to its Defense and Special Defense stats. Its Special Defense is maximized as most attackers it will be walling, namely Rotom-H and Houndoom, are specially based. Nonetheless, a physically defensive nature can be utilized in order to better counter Darmanitan. This also ensures that Choice Scarf Flygon will only 3HKO with either Outrage or Earthquake; otherwise, with a neutral nature, all would be guaranteed KOs. Moreover, if the aforementioned Ice- and Fire-type attacks aren't a concern, the Guts ability is an option; it activates while Hariyama is asleep, giving Force Palm a nice boost. Alternatively, if one isn't worried about Hariyama being a sitting duck while asleep, Stone Edge, Ice Punch, or Payback can be used over Sleep Talk for coverage. Knock Off makes Hariyama an even greater nuisance; although it has the bulk to pull this off, it is hard-pressed to free up a moveslot.</p> <p>Above all, this variant of Hariyama must be used with entry hazard support. Of the three, Stealth Rock has the greatest distribution, so there are many options; Registeel and Empoleon resist both Hariyama's weaknesses, while in return, Hariyama resists the weaknesses of Psychic-types such as Uxie and Azelf. Roserade is among the most reliable Spikes user in the tier, and can provide cleric support as well. Alternatives for this extremely useful but specific form of support include Altaria and Togekiss.</p> "

        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>Combining the offense of the first set with the bulk of the second, this set capitalizes on Hariyama's access to the move Bulk Up. A single use of the move gives Hariyama the equivalent of a Guts boost, while also buffing its Defense, making it ridiculously difficult to take down. While Gallade and Gurdurr may appear to be superior Bulk Up users thanks to receiving Drain Punch, Force Palm's secondary effect is useful as well, patching up Hariyama's low Speed and ensuring that it moves first; the paralysis support it provides also makes Hariyama much more of a team player. As always, Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus that resist Hariyama's STAB, while Ice Punch rounds out coverage nicely, hitting Gligar, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Golurk for super effective damage.</p> <p>As the three attacks listed give Hariyama perfect neutral coverage, there aren't very many other options. Payback isn't slashed because it tends to work against Force Palm; an unboosted Payback does as much damage to Ghost- and Psychic-types as a neutral Stone Edge does, and even without paralysis, these bulky walls rarely outspeed Hariyama. However, if hitting Uxie is important, or if you want a guaranteed OHKO on Alakazam at +0, and all Mismagius and Azelf, Payback is worthy of consideration.</p> <p>The EVs are straightforward: maximum Attack investment and a boosting nature allow Hariyama to hit hard, while the rest of the EVs are placed into Special Defense as Bulk Up boosts Hariyama's Defense. Feel free to shift Attack investment to Defense in order to set up on relatively weak physical attackers such as Claydol, Spiritomb, Registeel, and Donphan, but Hariyama must still watch out for Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Roar respectively. While the power boost won't go unnoticed, Hariyama generally can't afford to forgo its only form of recovery by using Life Orb. Guts, on the other hand, is definitely viable. In particular, it will be useful against the aforementioned status users, as well as bulky Ghost-types such as Dusclops, who will likely attempt to burn a boosting Hariyama.</p> <p>Strong Psychic- and Flying-type attackers fare well against this set. Slowbro and Uxie can all sponge hits well and retaliate with Psychic or Psyshock, and although Alakazam must watch out for Force Palm's paralysis chance, it can take even a +2 Force Palm and retaliate with Psychic. However, the OHKO is not guaranteed, even with Life Orb. Tornadus's Hurricane will OHKO, but its Flying Gem Acrobatics may not. With some luck, Togekiss can break through with Air Slash, and Choice Band Crobat will OHKO Hariyama even after the latter has gained a Bulk Up boost. Rhyperior and Empoleon are excellent counters to the aforementioned Flying-types, and can conveniently set up Stealth Rock to punish them for switching in; similarly, powerful Pursuit users such as Spiritomb, Weavile, and Krookodile can help to remove bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types.</p> "

        "name": "SubPunch",
        "description": "<p>This set adopts a different tack in order to combine Hariyama's offensive and defensive capabilities. Focus Punch is so monstrously powerful that a neutral hit outdamages a super effective Stone Edge, as is the case for a resisted hit and a neutral Stone Edge. Hariyama's Substitutes are no pushovers either; among the attacks they can sponge include Scald from bulky Water-types such as Blastoise, Milotic, and Suicune, Seismic Toss and Night Shade from foes such as Registeel, Dusclops, as well as Choice Scarf Darmanitan's U-turn. Thanks to Thick Fat, neutral-natured Houndoom will also more often than not fail to break Hariyama's Substitutes with Fire Blast. This surprising bulk often provides Hariyama with an additional turn of Leftovers recovery, and allows it to fire off yet another mighty Focus Punch.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, Stone Edge is the stronger attack only against Pokemon both weak to Rock-type attacks and resistant or immune to Fighting-type moves, such as Zapdos, Sigilyph, Xatu, and of course, all Ghost-types. However, Focus Punch will fail if Hariyama is hit the turn it is used, making Stone Edge the superior move if Hariyama isn't protected by a Substitute. In the last slot, Bulk Up and Payback both have their merits; the former comes in handy against opponents that Stone Edge just barely fails to OHKO, such as Crobat and Victini, as well as some variants of Zapdos and Mismagius, while the latter gains OHKOs on Alakazam, Azelf, and Mismagius.</p> <p>There isn't much need for a complicated EV spread; 252 Attack EVs along with a boosting nature maximizes Hariyama's damage output, while the rest buffer it against the previously mentioned special attacks. Again, some EVs can be reallocated into Defense, but doing so is not recommended, as most attacks Hariyama will be setting up on are specially based. Additionally, Hariyama will need all the power it can get, especially if you elect to forgo Bulk Up for Payback. Ice Punch is a more reliable option against Flying-types that wall Focus Punch, but it is not listed for a few good reasons. Firstly, it is significantly weaker; in contrast to Stone Edge, with which the KO is guaranteed, Ice Punch may not 2HKO Zapdos after Stealth Rock damage. Secondly, it does not even come close to 2HKOing its main target, Nidoqueen--Gligar and Golurk are rare, while Nidoking is frail--who has no problems breaking its Substitute with Earth Power. Guts is less of an option on this set than on the previous one because Substitute protects Hariyama against status, and also drains away its HP, which may cause it to die a premature death should it get burned or poisoned.</p> <p>Bulky Psychic-types pose the biggest issues to this variant; Uxie and Slowbro are barely scratched by either Focus Punch or Stone Edge, and can swiftly eliminate Hariyama with Psychic or Taunt it and set up on it, respectively. As with the first set, powerful Pursuit users such as Weavile and Spiritomb can severely punish these Psychic-types for coming in, Mismagius and Houndoom can take superb advantage of the free set-up opportunity, and so can Heracross, making them excellent choices.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Despite possessing lower stats and a shallower movepool than other metagame staples, Sableye remains a very viable choice in the UU tier after the transition to BW2. Prankster, Sableye's Dream World ability, is the key to its success, giving it access to priority on key moves, such as Will-O-Wisp, Recover, and Taunt. Combined with zero weaknesses and two handy immunities, Sableye can be a thorn in the side of physical attackers, set-up sweepers, and support Pokemon alike. In addition, recent changes are almost exclusively beneficial for the Darkness Pokemon. Sableye is able to take on Fighting-types Mienshao and Scrafty easily, and the increasingly popular Moxie Heracross is not nearly as threatening to Sableye as its Guts counterpart. Sableye also gained interesting moves such as Gravity in BW2, increasing its already vast support options. However, Sableye struggles to handle special attackers and the most powerful physical threats, so using Sableye effectively requires a strong defensive backbone to overcome some of its shortcomings. Still, with team support and some prediction, Sableye makes a great addition to teams looking for insurance against physical attackers and stall teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Prankster is central to Sableye's success, and with a large support movepool Sableye can use many other moves reliably. Sableye can make use of the Substitute and Torment combination, which will make many attackers rip their hair out trying to land a meaningful hit on Sableye. However, Sableye will struggle to take down opponents quickly with just Night Shade or Will-O-Wisp damage. Sableye is a decent Calm Mind user with Dark Pulse, now compatible with Prankster through move tutors, to surprise the special attackers that like to try to bring Sableye down; however, not being able to run both Taunt and Will-O-Wisp together on one set makes consistent results from the Calm Mind set unlikely. Sableye is able to use other moves such as Confuse Ray, Captivate, Trick, Psych Up, and Mean Look somewhat effectively, but is usually better off with the moves listed in the analysis. Finally, Sableye can be a valuable addition to a team based on a specific field condition with access to Sunny Day, Rain Dance, and Gravity. Prankster almost guarantees that Sableye can use the respective move to aid benefiting sweepers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Sableye may seem like a tough nut to crack with priority burn and recovery, there are multiple reliable methods to take it down. Fire-types such as Victini, Darmanitan, and Arcanine can come in on any attack except for Foul Play and take out Sableye in a single blow. Other lesser seen Fire-types such as Houndoom and Rotom-H can switch in with impunity because they do not fear Foul Play. While Guts Heracross has a high Attack stat, it can also switch in without fear because of its resistance to Foul Play. Heracross can then annihilate Sableye with Megahorn, profiting from potential burns due to its ability. Xatu is a good counter to Sableye because of Magic Bounce, which will reflect Sableye's attempts to status or Taunt Xatu. Xatu can then easily set up Reflect to sponge Foul Play. From there, it is a bit of a stalemate unless Xatu runs Toxic, which will bring down Sableye over time.</p> <p>In addition to these options, most strong special attackers can take care of Sableye without much trouble. As Sableye cannot buffer their special attacks, Pokemon such as Roserade and Raikou can handle Sableye without issue and do not mind being burned. Another of Sableye's shortcomings is that it does not take on bulky Water-types very well without Toxic because of Scald's burn chance, so Suicune, Blastoise, and Milotic can all work against Sableye if needed.</p> ",

Recover helps Sableye to continually take hits, and due to Prankster it will move first almost all of the time, meaning the opponent must be doing more than fifty percent damage to Sableye to have a chance at beating it with power alone. Priority Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, and chips away at the opponent's health. Taunt helps Sableye in a variety of ways, preventing status, opposing Taunt, stat boosting moves, and recovery moves. Foul Play or Night Shade occupies the last slot, in case Sableye is Taunted or needs to deal damage more quickly than Will-O-Wisp can provide. Foul Play gives Sableye a weapon against Victini and Darmanitan looking to switch in on any of Sableye's other moves, while Night Shade is a more consistent option.</p> <p>The EVs provide Sableye with balanced defensive capabilities, with an emphasis on Sableye's Special Defense because of Sableye's access to priority burns to bolster its Defense. The Defense EVs allow Sableye to take on the UU newcomers Scrafty and Mienshao without trouble through a cycle of Will-O-Wisp and Recover, using Taunt if necessary to stop set-up. A Calm nature is ideal because neither of Sableye's main attacking options utilize Sableye's own Attack stat, and the benefit of minimizing possible confusion damage is preferred. With such a large support movepool, Sableye can use multiple other moves in the last slot. Knock Off allows Sableye to operate while Taunted, and disrupts item dependent Pokemon, for example ridding defensive Pokemon such as Umbreon of Leftovers or sweepers such as Azelf of Life Orb. Toxic in the last slot helps Sableye wear down special attackers such as Blastoise and Slowbro more effectively than if they had been burned. Substitute works well for stalling because between priority Substitutes and Recovers, the opponent will struggle to get good hits on Sableye. However, many of these alternate options leave Sableye relying on status damage to drain the opponent's health.</p> <p>To help Sableye bring down opponents more quickly than with burn damage alone, entry hazards aid it immensely. Many of Sableye's counters are also very vulnerable to entry hazards, such as Zapdos and Houndoom. Qwilfish and Gligar can supply Spikes and Stealth Rock, respectively, while also serving as backup checks to physical attackers that Sableye cannot handle. In return, Sableye can block Rapid Spin by way of its Ghost-typing to keep the entry hazards on the field. While Sableye is adept at taking on the majority of physical attackers in UU, strong special attackers are another story. Snorlax can handle special juggernauts such as Zapdos, Shaymin, and Nidoking, and also appreciates the Fighting-type immunity that Sableye brings to the table.</p> "

Unfortunately, Head Smash is really the only thing Aggron has going for it, and it has a lot of things going against it. Abysmal Speed, a horrendous defensive typing with two 4x weaknesses, and lack of special bulk all make it difficult for Aggron to survive for long in battle. However, if Aggron can find an opportunity to use Head Smash, it will usually pay off.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aggron can take advantage of its low Speed and other ability, Sturdy, to OHKO nearly any attacker with Metal Burst. Unfortunately, this keeps it from using Head Smash effectively. Aggron also has a decent selection of support moves, including Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Thunder Wave. Aggron can use a Hone Claws set to increase Head Smash's accuracy, but it is generally too slow to pull it off effectively. A set utilizing Substitute and Focus Punch to soften up Pokemon that resist Head Smash, such as Steelix and Registeel, is also an option. With entry hazard support, Aggron can also take advantage of Dragon Tail or Roar to soften up Pokemon that attempt to switch into it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Hitmontop can switch into Head Smash and can revenge kill the Autotomize set with Mach Punch, but it should be wary of Heavy Slam, which can 2HKO after Spikes even after an Intimidate. Bulky physical walls that resist Head Smash also check Aggron effectively, especially Steelix and Nidoqueen, both of which threaten Aggron with STAB Earthquake. Because of its special frailty, nearly any Pokemon with a super effective special move threatens Aggron. Many Pokemon that threaten Aggron also outspeed it, such as Suicune with at least 52 EVs invested in Speed, so it is not very difficult to revenge kill.</p> ",

Head Smash deals devastating amounts of damage, and Aggron's Rock Head ability blocks recoil, allowing Aggron to use the attack with no risks, save for Head Smash's accuracy. This set focuses on abusing Head Smash, while the rest of the moves cover the Pokemon that resist it. Heavy Slam is a secondary STAB move, and it provides coverage on Fighting-types that resist Head Smash, such as Hitmontop. Earthquake deals with most Steel-types, including Registeel and Empoleon. Aqua Tail nails Ground-types, such as Golurk, Nidoqueen, and Claydol, while Superpower is Aggron's strongest move against Steelix, Empoleon, and Registeel.</p> <p>Although Aggron is incredibly slow, a Jolly nature is recommended for getting the jump on walls that don't invest in Speed, such as minimum Speed Suicune and Milotic. Adamant is still a perfectly acceptable choice, though, since the increase in power is noticeable.

Victini also hits hard physically and can set up Trick Room for Aggron to run amuck in. Teammates that cover Aggron's weaknesses are also important, especially its Fighting and Ground-type weaknesses. Zapdos resists both types and can scare off the Water-types that threaten Aggron, although it struggles against Quagsire and Swampert if it lacks Hidden Power Grass.

A Life Orb boosts power significantly, but using a Chople Berry makes it easier for Aggron to set up. Substitute is an option for blocking status, especially burns and paralysis, while also providing a safety net against attacks.</p> <p>This set appreciates entry hazard support. For example, Spikes support gives Aggron a chance to OHKO offensive Suicune with Head Smash. Roserade makes a great partner, resisting some of Aggron's most common weaknesses while also providing Spikes. Mew can also provide Stealth Rock and burn opponents with Will-O-Wisp, making it easier for Aggron to set up. On that note, dual screen support is recommended. Uxie can set up both Reflect and Light Screen and has other support options that benefit Aggron, including Stealth Rock, Memento, and Yawn. This set greatly fears Choice Scarf users, so a Wynaut holding Eviolite is appreciated for trapping and killing them. Priority users are also a problem, especially Hitmontop and Azumarill.

  "Medicham": {
    "overview": "<p>Medicham's most notable quality is its great ability, Pure Power, which doubles its otherwise pitiful Attack stat to a monstrous 480. Combine that with a 130 Base Power STAB in High Jump Kick and you have a seriously threatening Pokemon on your hands. Its secondary STAB move, Psycho Cut, has decent coverage with Fighting and does not contact the opponent, preventing abilities such as Mummy and Flame Body from triggering. Medicham is most notable for being able to deal serious damage to all of Heracross's counters, meaning it partners well with one of the best Pokemon in UU. Unfortunately, while Medicham has a great Attack stat, the rest of its stats are nothing to write home about; its base 80 Speed and defensive typing are disappointing to say the least. For these reasons, many of its potential sets are outclassed by Heracross and Mienshao, but Medicham still has a niche as a powerful wallbreaker that can rip huge holes in teams if you manage to bring it in safely.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Medicham's stats and typing don't allow it to do much else. Choice Scarf works just fine if you need a fast Fighting-type that beats Crobat and Gligar. However, Choice Scarf Medicham is outclassed by Heracross, which can sweep more easily; Mienshao, which is faster and has Regenerator; and Flygon, which has more opportunities to switch in. You could try a Life Orb if you'd like to switch attacks, but it misses out on some key KOs. Fake Out and / or Bullet Punch can be used to give Medicham priority for emergencies. It's important to note that Bullet Punch and Psycho Cut are illegal together, so if you opt to run Bullet Punch, you are stuck with Zen Headbutt for STAB, which makes physical contact with Pokemon such as Cofagrigus. Other options include Bulk Up, Drain Punch, and Recover, but Medicham is simply too frail to take advantage of these moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Sableye is Medicham's worst nightmare, as it is immune to both of Medicham's STAB attacks. It can survive any one hit from Medicham and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, which prevents Medicham from doing much of anything. Sableye sometimes even packs its own Trick, so Tricking it a Choice Band doesn't always work. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Cresselia, Uxie, Xatu, and Mew, take little from either of Medicham's STABs. All of them can be EVed to outspeed Choice Band versions, but none like to be Tricked a Choice Band. Xatu also hates elemental punches. Mew can potentially be 2HKOed by Choice Band High Jump Kick, but it would have to be very poorly EVed to both be outsped and fall in two hits. The common support Mew can burn Medicham with Will-O-Wisp and then Recover off the damage.</p> <p>Other than the above Pokemon, Medicham doesn't have any traditional \"counters\" that can switch into everything it has, but it can be played around with checks. Cofagrigus is a good start, as if Medicham doesn't predict and use Psycho Cut, its ability will be changed to Mummy, and it will become worthless until it switches out. Dusclops can avoid 2HKOs from all of Medicham's attacks thanks to Eviolite. Mimagius and Golurk aren't too bulky, but they are immune to High Jump Kick. Bronzong can take any attack other than High Jump Kick and KO with Gyro Ball.</p> <p>Once Medicham locks itself into a move, it is a lot less threatening, as numerous Pokemon can take one of Medicham's attacks, outspeed, and KO with a neutral STAB attack. Additionally, Medicham isn't easy to bring in, so continuous offensive volleys will prevent your opponent from doing so.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Medicham's best and only viable set in UU uses a Choice Band to boost its high Attack to a ludicrous 720 with an Adamant nature. This gives Medicham the power to break through almost every Pokemon in UU with the right attack. High Jump Kick has the most damage potential of any move Medicham carries; at 130 Base Power before STAB, it does heavy damage even to Pokemon that resist it. One needs to be extremely careful about the recoil, however, as an untimely Ghost-type or Protect will send Medicham crashing down. Psycho Cut is a safer move to spam, since Dark types aren't going to be risking coming in on High Jump Kick, and a lot of common responses to Fighting-types take heavy damage from it. Most notably, it 2HKOes offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus, and since Psycho Cut does not make contact, Medicham doesn't have to worry about Mummy. Psycho Cut also scores an OHKO on Mismagius, as well as Crobat, which 4x resists High Jump Kick.</p> <p>Medicham's last two slots are for coverage against other Fighting resists, many of which give trouble to other Fighting-types such as Heracross. Ice Punch scores an OHKO on Flying-types, including Gligar, Xatu, and all but the bulkiest of Zapdos after Stealth Rock. A well-predicted Ice Punch can clear the way for a Heracross sweep quite easily, turning the tide of a battle. The last attack is largely personal preference. Trick cripples the Psychic-types that wall Medicham, such as Slowbro and Mew. Thunder Punch 2HKOes Slowbro, but between Regenerator and the dangers of a Choice locked Electric-type attack, it's not always as effective as it could be.</p> <p>Here are just a few calculations that demonstrate Medicham's offensive prowess and ability to clean up Heracross's checks.</p> <ul> <li>High Jump Kick vs. 252/252+ Bronzong: 81.95 - 96.74% <li>Psycho Cut vs. 252/136+ Cofagrigus 42.5 - 50.62%</li> <li>Psycho Cut vs. 252/4 Cofagrigus: 51.87 - 61.25%</li> <li>Psycho Cut vs. 252/252+ Nidoqueen 94.27 - 111.45%</li> <li>-1 Psycho Cut vs. 252/236+ Qwilfish 80.83 - 95.2%</li> <li>Ice Punch vs. 252/252+ Eviolite Gligar 92.21 - 108.98%</li> <li>Ice Punch vs. 248/236+ Zapdos 69.45 - 81.98%</li> <li>Thunder Punch vs. 248/244+ Slowbro 56.99 - 67.17%</li> </ul> <p>The main choice to make is between an Adamant and Jolly nature. Adamant boosts Medicham's Attack to extraordinary levels, securing KOs on a multitude of slower threats, but Jolly lets Medicham outrun neutral natured Heracross, Kingdra, Nidoking, and Roserade. You can run Bullet Punch effectively in the last slot, as it does 35% minimum to Heracross while dispatching Weavile, but since Bullet Punch is illegal with Psycho Cut, using it forces you to run Zen Headbutt. This wouldn't be so bad except Zen Headbutt is a contact move, so you instantly lose to Cofagrigus.</p> <p>The main support Medicham needs is entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock. Entry hazards push many Pokemon into KO range, and Stealth Rock limits the amount of times Flying-types can tank a High Jump Kick. Cobalion is a good Stealth Rock setter and has access to Volt Switch, which can help bring Medicham in safely. Empoleon synergizes perfectly with Medicham and can support it by setting up Stealth Rock, burning foes with Scald, and providing free switch-in opportunities with Yawn. Uxie can set up Stealth Rock, U-turn as a Dark type switches in to bring in Medicham for free, and spread paralysis to slow down the opposition; however, the two share common weaknesses. Unlike many Pokemon reliant on hazards, Medicham doesn't require spinblocking support, since Rapid Spin is a great opportunity to bring Medicham in.</p> <p>Medicham does not have an easy time switching in, so anything that can help patch that weakness is a blessing for it. U-turn, Volt Switch, Baton Passing Substitute, dual screens, and double switching are all great ways to bring Medicham in. Psychic-types and to a lesser extent Ghost-types are huge thorns in Medicham's side, so Pursuit support from the likes of Snorlax and Houndoom is much appreciated. Both of these Pokemon resist Ghost, which is Medicham's most major weakness. Houndoom can also come in for free on support Mew and immediately threaten it with a powerful Pursuit. Unfortunately, neither Pokemon can handle all of Mew's best sets, so using multiple Pokemon to beat all of Mew's common sets is recommended.</p> "

  "Sharpedo": {
    "overview": "<p>Before BW, Sharpedo was hopelessly outclassed as a Water-type, its good offenses and Speed offset by its poor defensive typing and incredible frailness. However, it received one of the best offensive abilities in the game from the Dream World: Speed Boost. Now, Sharpedo is a sight to behold, and its scary base 120 Attack and good base 95 Special Attack are more threatening than ever before. That same poor defensive typing from last generation is now one of Sharpedo's greatest assets, because the only common Pokemon in the UU metagame that resists both of Sharpedo's STAB moves is Empoleon. Sharpedo is versatile as well, with attacking stats and a movepool that allow it to either go all-out physically or use a specially attacking set. As counters to the physical set are beaten by the special set, and vice versa, Sharpedo is difficult to deal with before you figure out the set, and it has very few 100% safe switch-ins.</p> <p>Not all is bright and cheery for Sharpedo in UU, though. It's still ridiculously frail thanks to its 70 / 40 / 40 defenses, and it is susceptible to common priority, such as Hitmontop's Mach Punch and Arcanine's Extreme Speed. Even resisted hits from the likes of Honchkrow and Bisharp leave a large dent in Sharpedo, and when combined with a couple turns of recoil damage, they can bring Sharpedo to its doom. A common characteristic of Speed Boost users is their overreliance on Protect to gain Speed boosts, and Sharpedo is no different. This makes Sharpedo notoriously easy to play around, as most users of Sharpedo are cautious when it comes to attaining Speed boosts. Sharpedo's good mixed attacking stats aren't as good as they appear in the UU metagame, as Sharpedo has to OHKO everything in order to attain a sweep, and this simply isn't possible against most UU teams due to the bulky nature of the metagame. Many Pokemon can take a hit from Sharpedo and retaliate just as strongly. Sharpedo is definitely a threat to prepare for; however, its many flaws hold it back from becoming a top-tier threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Sharpedo doesn't have any other notable moves at its disposal, it can run an effective mixed set with the moves it has. A specially based mixed set of Hydro Pump, Dark Pulse, and Earthquake makes for a wonderful Empoleon lure; an EV spread of 136 Atk / 252 SpA / 120 Spe along with a Naughty nature allows Sharpedo to lure in and KO Empoleon with the combination of Hydro Pump and Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage. However, Ice Beam is far superior to Earthquake on a special attacking set, as the latter option makes Sharpedo less effective overall just so it can accomplish a single goal. While that might prove effective if your team is based around Rain Dance Kingdra, it's hardly Sharpedo's optimal set.</p> <p>Sharpedo can also use a Choice Band to power up its moves a little more. However, Sharpedo relies on its coverage to sweep, so locking it into a single move isn't worth the extra power. In addition, Sharpedo can't use Protect well when holding a Choice item, rendering it unable to get the Speed boost it needs in some situations. Sharpedo's only usable boosting move is Agility, but it's completely inferior to just using Speed Boost. Substitute can help Sharpedo avoid status and guard against revenge killers, but Sharpedo is pressed for moveslots as it is, and it's already the fastest thing around after it gets a couple of boosts. Likewise, Taunt is an option, but Sharpedo is too frail to use it effectively, and Substitute is the better option to avoid status. The only other coverage moves Sharpedo has access to are Double-Edge and Return; however, they offer almost the exact same coverage as Sharpedo's Dark-type STAB, and thus shouldn't be used.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Sharpedo can be tough to counter before you know its set, there are a few Pokemon that can take it on no matter what set it's using. Porygon2 is one of the best all-around counters to Sharpedo that there is, as it is ridiculously bulky both physically and specially, has access to Recover, and can OHKO Sharpedo with either Thunderbolt or Discharge. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Milotic, and Blastoise are in a similar boat, as they all resist Sharpedo's Water-type attacks and don't take much from either Crunch or Dark Pulse. Milotic is the most dependable option here, as it has reliable recovery and can potentially burn Sharpedo with Scald or just stall it out with Recover while Sharpedo falls to Life Orb recoil. Suicune can set up Calm Mind boosts on Sharpedo while using Rest to heal semi-reliably, and more defensive versions can also wear it down with Scald. Blastoise can use Toxic to put Sharpedo in its place, although it can be worn down easily due to its lack of recovery. Snorlax is a good check to both sets as well; it hard counters the special set while only fearing Waterfall flinches from the physical set, can heal semi-reliably with RestTalk, and 2HKOes Sharpedo with Body Slam if it doesn't paralyze Sharpedo first. If all else fails, Life Orb Arcanine's Extreme Speed does a minimum of 80% to Sharpedo, which is enough to faint it after a turn of Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>The physical set is best checked by bulky Grass- and Flying-types that can take a Crunch and hit back. Shaymin is one of Sharpedo's best Grass-type checks, especially if Sharpedo lacks Ice Beam, as it can take Crunch with ease and OHKO in return with Seed Flare. Togekiss is another strong check to Sharpedo that lack Ice Beam, and can paralyze it after first taking a hit. It can then stall out Life Orb recoil by using Roost or paralyze Sharpedo and use Serene Grace Air Slash flinches to greatly hamper it from even getting an attack off. Whether or not it is physically defensive, Zapdos too can take one of Sharpedo's physical STAB moves and KO with Thunderbolt. Defensive Hitmontop is the best direct counter to physically attacking Sharpedo though, as it can reduce Sharpedo's damage output with Intimidate and OHKO it with Close Combat. Even if it's weakened, Hitmontop can still do a number with STAB Mach Punch before it dies.</p> <p>Umbreon is one of the best counters to the special set, as it can take any of Sharpedo's attacks with ease and stall it out with Wish and Protect, or use Toxic to cripple it tremendously. Swampert is also a pretty good check, as it can take a hit and hit back with Earthquake, although it can be 2HKOed by Hydro Pump. Kingdra 4x resists Hydro Pump and can take a Dark Pulse before OHKOing with Draco Meteor. Escavalier can take on the special set as well, for it is only 2HKOed by Hydro Pump and can KO with Megahorn in return. Specially defensive Escavalier can sometimes avoid even the 2HKO from Hydro Pump while still KOing with Megahorn. Bulk Up Scrafty is also a solid check to specially based Sharpedo, because maximum investment in Special Defense enables it to always avoid the 2HKO from Hydro Pump without hazards on the field; it can then OHKO Sharpedo with Drain Punch while recovering most of the health lost. Dragon Dance variants aren't bad checks either, but they must be careful when using High Jump Kick because there is always the threat of Protect.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>A physically attacking set is Sharpedo's best way of attempting a sweep in the UU metagame. Speed Boost is the key to the set, and it makes Sharpedo progressively harder to beat. This set is threatening to offensive teams in particular, as they are usually frail and can't outspeed Sharpedo once it gets a few Speed boosts under its belt. In fact, Sharpedo is useful on offensive teams of its own, since it can be an effective late-game cleaner on its own against offense as well as act as a revenge killer for extremely fast threats, or against stall can clean up after its teammates have weakened the defensive core.</p> <p>Protect is the most important move on the set, and it ensures that Sharpedo can get that extra boost if necessary. It usually never hurts to be safe, especially if you're not sure whether or not your opponent's Flygon or Darmanitan is carrying a Choice Scarf. It's especially useful against Fake Out users, and Sharpedo isn't a bad check to either of them. While it's good to be liberal with Protect, there's no need to allow your opponent to get a setup opportunity when they're slower than Sharpedo, as you can't allow Slowbro to get a free chance to heal.</p> <p>Waterfall and Crunch are Sharpedo's most powerful physical STAB moves, getting wonderful coverage in UU. Waterfall hits mainly Fire- and Ground-types, including Darmanitan, Arcanine, Krookodile, Rhyperior, Nidoking, and Houndoom. Crunch takes out the many Psychic- and Ghost-types in UU, such as Azelf, Cofagrigus, Slowbro, Mismagius, and Xatu. However, their coverage overlaps on threats that that are hit super effectively or neutrally by both moves, such as Victini and Claydol, as well as Crobat and Zapdos, respectively. As the two moves have equal Base Power, your decision between the two should come down to prediction. If you think that your opponent will leave his or her Pokemon in, Waterfall is the better choice for its flinch chance; however, if you predict a switch, Crunch is the superior option because it has a chance to inflict a Defense drop. Earthquake rounds out the set by hitting Steel-types that would ordinarily get in Sharpedo's way, such as Registeel and Cobalion. It is especially useful for Empoleon, the only UU Pokemon that resists both of Sharpedo's STAB moves.</p> <p>Maximum Attack investment along with an Adamant nature allows Sharpedo to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment enables Sharpedo to outspeed everything with base 80 Speed or below before a boost, the most noteworthy example being Togekiss. However, you could always elect to give Sharpedo less Speed as well. After a boost, 152 Speed EVs let it outrun Crobat, and 120 EVs let it beat out Weavile; at +2, 84 Speed EVs enable it to outspeed Choice Scarf Flygon. However, Sharpedo is so frail that the added bulk does nearly nothing to improve its chances of surviving a priority attack, so you might as well just invest fully in Speed. Life Orb is a necessity for Sharpedo, as it needs all the power it can get while not being locked into a single move. Items that don't have recoil--such as Expert Belt and Splash Plate--are inferior; Sharpedo isn't going to miss the extra HP, as it can't take a hit anyway. Aqua Jet is an option on this set over Waterfall to hit Hitmontop, Honchkrow, and Bisharp before they can hit Sharpedo with priority of their own, but it's an inferior choice as it deals pitiful damage, and Arcanine will hit first with Extreme Speed anyway.</p> <p>Entry hazards are crucial to Sharpedo's success, as Pokemon such as Heracross, Mew, and Nidoqueen are all put into KO range with full hazards. Roserade, Scolipede, and Gligar can all set up hazards reliably, and as such are good teammates. Sharpedo struggles with the plethora of bulky Water-types in UU not named Slowbro, so fine partners are Pokemon that can wear them down enough for Sharpedo to sweep. Kingdra and Darmanitan are checked by bulky Water-types and, along with Sharpedo, can hopefully break their common counters so that one of them can sweep. Shaymin can switch into Swampert, Milotic, and Suicune with ease and eliminate them with Seed Flare, while Sharpedo can get rid of Arcanine and Darmanitan in return. Zapdos can take out Milotic and Suicune, and can also switch into bulkier Fighting-types, such as Machamp and Heracross, both of which can take a hit from Sharpedo and pulverize it. In return, Sharpedo can deal with Rhyperior, one of Zapdos's best counters. A Fighting-types of your own is a good teammate too, as it can deal with Porygon2, which is arguably the best counter to this set.</p> "

It's also very helpful to scout for priority from the likes of Arcanine and Hitmontop while completely blocking Fake Out.

However, you should still be wary of giving your opponent a free turn to set up.</p> <p>As stated before, one of the main reasons that this set can break stall more easily than the physical attacker is its more powerful Water-type STAB move.

For example, Hydro Pump is a guaranteed OHKO against both Cobalion and Porygon-Z with one layer of Spikes up (or in the latter's case, just Stealth Rock will suffice), while Surf can sometimes fail to OHKO Azelf after Stealth Rock damage! However, Surf is the better choice for those who prefer reliability, and it isn't as inferior as one might think on teams that can easily stack hazards. Dark Pulse is a secondary STAB move that gets wonderful coverage in tandem with Sharpedo's Water-type STAB move; specifically, it hits Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Slowbro, Cofagrigus, and Mismagius. Lastly, Ice Beam is one of Sharpedo's greatest assets from a special attacking standpoint, as it allows Sharpedo to hit the common Flying- and Grass-types, especially the relatively bulky Zapdos, Togekiss, Shaymin, and Roserade. It also gets the OHKO on Flygon, which Hydro Pump just misses out on; this is very important considering Choice Scarf Flygon is most offensive teams' best answer to Sharpedo.</p> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Sharpedo to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. A Modest nature is chosen since Sharpedo really needs the extra power, and it is already fast enough to outspeed non-Choice Scarf versions of Togekiss. However, you can run less Speed to slightly increase Sharpedo's bulk and defend against priority. For example, Sharpedo can use either 152 or 120 Speed EVs to outrun Crobat and Weavile respectively after a single Speed boost, while 84 Speed EVs allow Sharpedo to outspeed base 100 Choice Scarf users after two Speed boosts. However, this typically isn't recommended because Sharpedo is ridiculously frail even with investment, and it's better off trying to outspeed as many things with as few boosts as possible. Life Orb is the preferred item choice on this set, as Sharpedo desperately needs the power boost but doesn't mind the health reduction. Hidden Power Grass is a viable choice on this set to hit bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, Milotic, and Swampert, which Sharpedo traditionally struggles with. It is especially helpful against the latter, but it doesn't usually have a place in the set because it can only go over Protect, and Protect is much more useful because offensive teams are a lot more common in UU than stall teams are.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is a top priority when using Sharpedo, as hazards allow it to function better against offense and stall alike. Scolipede, Qwilfish, and Gligar can all set up hazards for Sharpedo and can take on Fighting-types as well. As Sharpedo can't break Suicune, Milotic, or Swampert, both Shaymin and Roserade are excellent partners that can switch into them with ease. Roserade has the ability to set up Spikes in its spare time, while Shaymin is a more reliable switch-in to Swampert because it doesn't fear Earthquake. Sharpedo also struggles against Snorlax, Porygon2, and Umbreon due to their incredible bulk and access to recovery (although Snorlax can only use Rest). As such, Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Machamp, and Heracross are all great partners that can deal with them appropriately, while Sharpedo can use Dark Pulse to get rid of the Psychic- and Ghost-types that resist Fighting-type attacks. Kingdra is an interesting choice for a teammate, because--unlike all of the aforementioned Pokemon--it doesn't break down Sharpedo's counters easily; in fact, Kingdra and Sharpedo are both plagued by bulky Water-types and Snorlax. However, they are good teammates because they can weaken each other's checks; if one of them can weaken a check such as Empoleon, the other can break through and sweep the opponent's team.</p> "

  "Altaria": {
    "overview": "<p>Since its introduction two generations ago, Altaria hasn't changed much. It pulls off both offensive and defensive roles quite effectively in UU. The key to its success lies in its access to Dragon Dance and STAB Dragon-type moves, allowing it to pose as an offensive threat despite its low Attack stat, and its defenses, which allow it to obtain multiple boosts easily. Altaria also has the Natural Cure ability along with great moves such as Heal Bell and Roost, allowing it to support its team. Overall, Altaria is a solid Pokemon in the Underused tier with multiple possibilities that should not be overlooked.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Cotton Guard is a good move that can greatly raise Altaria's defense, and it could be used to try to stall. Sing is a sleep-inducing move, which is always useful, but its terrible accuracy makes it unreliable. Altaria can set up Sunny Day or Rain Dance for weather-based teams, and it can usually survive long enough to set up multiple times in a match.</p> <p>Altaria could hit Fighting-types with Aerial Ace, but the move is quite weak even with STAB. Agility could also be used for the Speed boost, but Altaria's offensive stats are just too weak to use unboosted attacks. A Choice Specs set is possible, as Altaria learns Dragon Pulse, Draco Meteor, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Hidden Power, but Kingdra and even Flygon hit harder. Altaria gets Feather Dance, which can help against physical threats by lowering their Attack. Haze is yet another move that Altaria could use to get rid of stat boosts. Finally, Rest and Sleep Talk could be used nicely together for healing, and Natural Cure makes it much safer, as this means that the new sleep mechanics don't hurt Altaria.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ice-types like Weavile can threaten to KO Altaria, making them major problems for any set. Steel-types can deal with any set without Earthquake or Fire Blast easily. Escavalier makes a better check, taking a neutral Earthquake with ease. Powerful bulky Water-types can take a hit and use Ice-type attacks in return, but need to watch out for a possible Toxic. Lastly, other Dragon-types such as Kingdra and Flygon can outspeed and deal massive damage to Altaria.</p> ",

Dragon Dance is Altaria's choice to boost its stats, reaching 393 Attack and 388 Speed with an Adamant nature after a single use. Outrage deals the most damage out of Altaria's physical Dragon-type moves, making it the primary option. Earthquake is Altaria's best coverage move, denting Steel-types that resist Outrage. Finally, Roost is used as Altaria's way to heal damage taken while sweeping, and its ability to take hits and heal off damage shouldn't be underestimated.</p> <p>Adamant is the preferred nature since Altaria needs all the power it can get, but Jolly is an option for outspeeding base 130 Speed Pokemon such as Aerodactyl and Crobat after just one Dragon Dance. Fire Blast could be used over Roost to hit Escavalier, which is hit neutral by Earthquake, but Escavalier isn't common enough to be worth a moveslot. Altaria appreciates other Dragon-types as teammates, as they can wear down their similar counters and allow one another to sweep. Kingdra and Flygon are good Dragon-types to consider. Magneton is a good teammate as well, as it can trap and KO Escavalier, which can be troublesome otherwise. Lastly, Hitmontop can be a good check to Ice-types such as Weavile that could stop Altaria's sweep with Ice Shard.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Unlike the previous set, which aims to deal damage quickly, this set attempts to use Altaria's natural defenses to gain multiple boosts before sweeping with a reliable move. Dragon Dance and Roost are the crux of this set, allowing Altaria to set up and heal. Dragon Claw is chosen over Outrage, as Dragon Claw is much more reliable, not forcing Altaria to be locked in or become confused. In the last slot, Heal Bell is an option to heal status that Altaria may take while setting up, but the move has problems with low PP. Safeguard has much higher PP and can protect Altaria and its teammates from status for five turns. It can't get rid of a status that's already there though, making it a bit risky. Altaria mostly sets up on Fire- and Grass-type Pokemon here, but it can also do so on Fighting-types that lack Stone Edge or even Water-types with low Special Attack, as Altaria can actually heal off their damage by using Roost on an incoming Ice Beam.</p> <p>Altaria can invest some EVs in Attack at expense of its Special Defense, but this is not recommended due to the importance of its defenses on this set. Magneton again makes a solid teammate, trapping and KOing Steel-types that can easily get in Altaria's way with their resistance to Dragon-type moves. Hitmontop works as well, dealing with Ice-types wanting to get in an Ice Shard. Grass-types such as Shaymin are good teammates as well, providing a bit of backup against bulky Water-types, especially those with Roar, such as Suicune.</p> "

Dragon Pulse is Altaria's most reliable STAB move and has decent neutral coverage, but it won't hit very hard at all. Heal Bell is a very useful move to rid Altaria's team of status and isn't too widespread, allowing Altaria to fill a useful niche. Roost is its all-important healing move, letting it stay around for a good amount of time. Perish Song is preferred in the last slot as a way to phaze the opponent, though Altaria itself must switch after use or else it will be KOed. Toxic is another option to inflict deadly poison on bulkier Pokemon, wearing them down for teammates to finish off. Flamethrower can also be used to hit Steel-types that resist Dragon Pulse.</p> <p>Roar is an alternative phazing move that works immediately if that is desired, although many other Pokemon can use that move to greater effect. Pokemon with Ice-type moves are the biggest threat to this Altaria. Examples of these are Nidoking and Weavile. Technician Hitmontop can use Mach Punch on Weavile which allows it to work well with Altaria. Snorlax is an option for a teammate that easily walls Nidoking, as Nidoking is almost always using specially-based sets. Snorlax can even take an Earthquake from a mixed set as well. Escavalier is another good teammate, able to take the moves Weavile uses and KOing with Iron Head. Steel-types in general have great synergy with Altaria, as together they combine to resist every type but Electric.</p> "

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Crawdaunt was never a very good Pokemon in past generations. It had strong STABs and a high base Attack, but its pathetic base 55 Speed stat kept it from doing pretty much anything useful. However, its first ray of light came when it obtained Dragon Dance as an HGSS Egg move. This allowed Crawdaunt to finally raise its Speed and possibly even attempt a sweep. Although the power of the metagame around it has risen dramatically, Crawdaunt has only improved in the shift to BW. It received the Adaptability ability from the Dream World, raising its STAB modifier from 1.5x to 2x. Combined with the excellent coverage of Water- and Dark-type STABs, Crawdaunt now has the raw power to smash through many teams in UU after a Dragon Dance. Although Feraligatr might seem to outclass Crawdaunt in a sweeping role, Crawdaunt boasts a secondary Dark-type STAB to dispose of walls. However, Crawdaunt still has its fair share of problems on the defensive side. Its paper-thin defenses mean that priority moves spell trouble for our dancing lobster friend, especially considering that Crawdaunt's secondary Dark typing give it a weakness to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. In addition, even after a Dragon Dance, Crawdaunt can be revenge killed by fast Pokemon thanks to its abysmal Speed. Overall, if you need a sweeper for a UU team, it's always worth giving Crawdaunt a look.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While there are a few other sets that Crawdaunt can employ, most of them fall flat due to its terrible Speed. A Choice Band set can be used for huge power immediately, but unlike the Dragon Dance set it can't switch moves and is revenged very easily since it has no way to boost its Speed. Swords Dance gives Crawdaunt simply massive power. Almost nothing in UU can avoid an OHKO from a Crawdaunt with +2 Attack. However, it also suffers from the problem of having awful Speed, allowing it to be easily revenge killed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Priority is an excellent way of checking Crawdaunt due to its awful defenses. Hitmontop is amazingly adept at this, OHKOing Crawdaunt with a STAB Mach Punch and even packing Intimidate to cushion the blow on its way in. While Arcanine can pick off weakened Crawdaunt with Extreme Speed, if the lobster is still in good health, it can take the hit and massacre Arcanine with a STAB Water-type attack. Even after one Dragon Dance, Raikou and Azelf that run Speed-boosting natures outspeed Crawdaunt and can easily OHKO it with Electric- and Grass-type moves. If Crawdaunt does not use Superpower, Ferroseed and Empoleon can soak up anything that Crawdaunt can throw at them easily. In addition, Tangrowth can take a boosted Crunch easily and retaliate with a STAB Grass-type move. Lastly, the extremely rare Poliwrath takes negligible damage from anything Crawdaunt can do and phazes it out with STAB Circle Throw.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set makes use of the move Dragon Dance to raise Crawdaunt's Speed and Attack. After one boost, it outspeeds Pokemon with a base Speed of 105 and reaches 508 Attack, enabling it to break through many UU teams. Coupled with Crawdaunt's excellent dual 160 Base Power STAB moves, this crustacean will have very few troubles sweeping given the proper support.</p> <p>The moves employed on this set are fairly straightforward. Dragon Dance is the basis of the set, boosting Crawdaunt's Attack and Speed to prime it for a sweep. Waterfall and Crunch are Crawdaunt's main attacks, with their awesome combined coverage capable of hitting almost every Pokemon in UU for neutral damage. However, the last slot is a much more difficult choice to make. Superpower is the primary option, enabling Crawdaunt to massacre Ferroseed and Empoleon, which would otherwise wall it. However, Taunt shuts down walls and prevents them from hitting Crawdaunt with a crippling status effect or setting up hazards or stat boosts. Substitute also stops Crawdaunt from being affected by status, and has the added bonus of allowing Crawdaunt to scout for moves its opponent may be able to stop it with.</p> <p>The EVs on this set could hardly be more simple, enabling Crawdaunt to outspeed Pokemon with a base Speed of 105 after a Dragon Dance, and giving it maximum attack power to help it blast through teams. The leftover 12 EVs go into Crawdaunt's HP, giving it a bit of help with taking stray resisted attacks. A Jolly nature enables Crawdaunt to outspeed all Pokemon with a base Speed of up to 105 after a boost, but if you really want extra power, an Adamant nature is usable. A Life Orb is the suggested item because Crawdaunt needs all the power it can get, and it isn't bulky at all so an item such as Leftovers does it no good. Crabhammer can be used for a slight increase in Base Power, but Waterfall's accuracy and flinch chance are far more useful.</p> <p>The best teammates for this set are those that eliminate Crawdaunt's counters and help it sweep. Strong Ground-types can take on both Empoleon and Raikou, the former beating Crawdaunt without Superpower and the latter outspeeding it even after a Dragon Dance. Flygon and Swampert are both good choices, but must be wary of Empoleon's Scald and can both be taken out by the appropriate Hidden Power from Raikou. Checks for Hitmontop and Arcanine are necessary to use with Crawdaunt. In addition, a user of the move Rain Dance can be quite beneficial to Crawdaunt, as rain boosts Waterfall's Base Power to a ridiculous 270.</p> "

  "Claydol": {
    "overview": "<p>Claydol has been a rather decent supportive Pokemon throughout two generations, always pulling its weight for its team. However, things have changed for this ancient Pokemon. With threats lurking in each corner, more powerful than the next, Claydol can't hold on its own anymore. Crippling weaknesses to the common Ice-, Grass-, Water-, Bug-, Ghost-, and Dark-type moves make it unable to switch in with ease. The lack of any reliable recovery move outside of Rest prevents Claydol from taking repeated hits, which can make it hard for Claydol to accomplish its task several times in one game. However, one can't just overlook Claydol's good qualities, of which it has plenty. While its HP stat can be a bit disappointing at times, Claydol's great defensive stats make up for it. 105 / 120 defenses give Claydol great mixed defensive capabilities, and when coupled with its useful resistances to Electric-, Fighting-, Rock-, Psychic-, and Ground-type moves, Claydol is able to to take on certain threats in the tier with somewhat ease. However, the main reason one should ever use Claydol in the first place is its access to the highly coveted Rapid Spin. With most of the more reliable and better Rapid Spin users residing in OU, Claydol is one of few viable users of the move in the UU tier. The ability to keep entry hazards off the field in this Spikes-flooded metagame while being able to remove Stealth Rock from the field for the many Fire- and Bug-type Pokemon in the tier is a godsend to any team. Claydol is also unique in that it is the only spinner in the game who is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and resists Stealth Rock, which makes Rapid Spinning an easier task for Claydol to do. This, coupled with the ability to support its team with both Stealth Rock and dual screens as well, make Claydol a solid support Pokemon in UU, even though it has its drawbacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Claydol has a wide array of moves in its movepool, but not all of them are highly usable. Psyshock and Psychic does give Claydol a secondary STAB move to use besides Earthquake, though they don't provide any additional coverage other than hitting Heracross for super effective damage. However, Claydol shouldn't be taking Heracross on in the first place, making Ice Beam or Toxic much more viable choices. Claydol can provide weather support by utilizing Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but there are often better candidates for that role than Claydol; the same goes for Reflect and Light Screen. Claydol can also provide Trick Room support, but this playstyle is almost as weak as weather. Other gimmicky support options include Trick used in conjunction with Choice Scarf, Magic Coat, and Gravity, but there will always be better options for Claydol to use. Calm Mind does build up the mixed bulk Claydol already possesses while also increasing its power, but Claydol's disappointing Special Attack makes it much worse than it should be, while it has a really bad HP stat in comparison to other Calm Mind users and no recovery outside of Rest. RestTalk won't do much either as Claydol's STAB moves are either resisted by or ineffective against several Pokemon in the tier. However, it does have a good special movepool. Explosion can be used, though it is incredibly weak and has only any real use, if so slightly, on the dual screens set to maximize the turns offensive Pokemon can abuse it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Even though Claydol is reasonably bulky, the UU tier is filled with powerful attackers that can take advantage of its common weaknesses. There are plenty of Ghost-types in the tier, and they are some of Claydol's worst enemies for several reasons. The first reason, and arguably the biggest, is that they can easily prevent Claydol from spinning away entry hazards simply by switching in on Rapid Spin. Not only has Claydol wasted a turn, it can hardly do anything back to these Ghost-types and is often forced to switch out, giving the opponent a chance to set up. Mismagius and Sableye are the two most prominent Ghost-type counters to Claydol. They both have access to Taunt, making them able to shut down Claydol quite easily by preventing it from using Stealth Rock, Toxic, and dual screens. Furthermore, they will usually take little damage from Claydol's offensive moves as well, while Mismagius is even immune to Earthquake and can avoid being hit by Toxic by using Substitute. Last but not least is Cofagrigus. Cofagrigus can easily set up both Trick Room and Nasty Plot against Claydol by utilizing its great bulk; even a Cofagrigus with just one Nasty Plot boost can sweep an entire team. The only real damage Claydol can do against Cofagrigus is by limiting its time on the field with the use of Toxic.</p> <p>While not as menacing as the Ghost-types, the Dark-types in the tier can cause severe trouble and damage to Claydol as well. Zoroark and Houndoom can easily 2HKO specially defensive Claydol with a combination of Sucker Punch and Dark Pulse, or even OHKO weakened ones. They can even proceed to set up with Nasty Plot, but they need to be careful of Earthquake, especially Houndoom, as it will put a severe dent into both of them, if not outright KO Houndoom. Weavile can OHKO the same Claydol with ease by using Ice Punch, while it also have the opportunity to set up with Swords Dance. The physically defensive version of Claydol will have a much easier time against Weavile, while Sucker Punch from Houndoom and Zoroark won't do nearly as much. However, their Dark Pulses will do much more damage now, possibly resulting in an OHKO. Scrafty can easily set up on Claydol with Bulk Up, using Shed Skin and Rest to stop any attempts to Toxic it. It can then proceed to easily KO Claydol with a boosted STAB Crunch. Heracross and Escavalier are also two really good candidates. They take little damage from Claydol's offensive moves and certainly don't mind Toxic; their STAB-boosted Megahorns will easily OHKO Claydol. Rhyperior is in a similar situation, as it takes little damage from even super effective moves thanks to Solid Rock. Its Megahorn won't nearly as hard the former two's, but will still put a huge dent into Claydol. Repeated U-turns from the likes of Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Flygon will also wear down Claydol in time until it goes down. Water- and Grass-types, such as Slowbro, Azumarill, Shaymin, and Roserade, will always threaten any Claydol, dealing huge amounts of damage to it while not taking nearly the same in return. Xatu is one of the biggest blocks to Claydol. Not only does it take little to no damage from Ice Beam and Earthquake, it also bounces back both Stealth Rock and Toxic thanks to Magic Bounce.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Claydol is one of the few viable Rapid Spin users in the UU tier, and this set capitalizes on that factor. While Claydol does face competition from Hitmontop, it has some things going for it that Hitmontop lacks. The main factor is its ability, Levitate, which allows Claydol to switch unharmed into Spikes and Toxic Spikes, unlike Hitmontop. Even though Hitmontop has better initial Defense factoring in Intimidate, as well as better offenses, this more than makes up for it. Second in line is Stealth Rock. Hitmontop, along with all other Rapid Spin users beneath it, lack the ability to set up any entry hazard, so Claydol has much better utility and can give much better support to its team in general. For its offensive options, Claydol doesn't have many useful moves to choose from, though two stand out. Earthquake is a great, reliable STAB move that allows Claydol to hit Pokemon such as Raikou hard. Ice Beam works great in conjunction with Earthquake, allowing it to hit Flying-types that avoid Earthquake, such as Zapdos and Togekiss, for decent damage. Toxic is still a good option for wearing down certain opponents, especially opposing walls and setup sweepers, such as Calm Mind Raikou.</p> <p>An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Relaxed or Bold nature, depending on what moves Claydol uses, is perfectly viable. However, it should be noted that the specially defensive spread is more suited for Claydol, as Claydol can then better take on certain threats, such as Raikou. The physically defensive spread does make better use of Claydol's Rock- and Fighting-type resistances, but Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Heracross also carry powerful super effective moves against Claydol, making it the lesser choice. Earth Power can be used over Earthquake to do more damage to physically bulky Pokemon, such as Cobalion, Rhyperior, and Slowbro, but it's a much worse choice against the Pokemon Claydol should be capable of handling, such as Calm Mind Raikou. If you decide to use it, go with a Calm or Bold nature instead, depending on what EV spread you're using. Claydol lacks a recovery move, which makes its job of spinning multiple times in a match much harder. This makes Rest somewhat viable, as it brings Claydol back to full health, while also removing any troublesome status. However, Rest puts Claydol in an awful position, making it even bigger setup bait for several Pokemon while it's asleep. This is a bit of a turn-off for using Rest, but it's unfortunately Claydol's only recovery move.</p> <p>Cleric and Wish support are great for Claydol, especially if it does use Rest. Pokemon such as Umbreon and Roserade can use Heal Bell and Aromatherapy respectively to cure Claydol of status ailments; Umbreon can also pass relatively huge Wishes to Claydol to restore its health. In addition, Umbreon resists Claydol's Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses, while Claydol covers Umbreon's Fighting-type one; however, they do share a weakness to Bug-type moves. Roserade has decent type synergy with Claydol, resisting Grass- and Water-type moves, but they share an Ice-type weakness with each other. Suicune and Victini make great teammates for Claydol as well. Suicune resists Ice- and Water-type moves, while Victini resists Grass- and Ice-type moves. In return, Claydol covers Suicune's Electric-type weakness, as well as Victini's Ground- and Rock-type weaknesses. Obviously, one should also pair Claydol with Pokemon that really need Rapid Spin support. Yanmega, Darmanitan, and Zapdos are all weak to Stealth Rock and hence appreciate Claydol's support.</p> "

  "Ambipom": {
    "overview": "<p>Ambipom is no longer the Pokemon it was in DPP. Team Preview has diminished its usefulness as a scouting lead, and in the UU metagame, it finds itself struggling to compete with the stronger Pokemon that now inhabit the tier. Even Ambipom's niche as a fast offensive Normal-type is at stake, as it now faces competition from Cinccino for this title. As dire as things might be for Ambipom, its strong priority in Fake Out and better coverage still help to differentiate it from Cinccino, which is otherwise the superior Pokemon of the two. Fortunately for Ambipom, it also remains one of the faster Pokemon in UU, and the combination of Fake Out and Return can still dispose of frail or weakened Pokemon with ease, while its coverage moves together with the threat of Switcheroo have the potential to take would be counters by surprise. Be warned, though, that Ambipom is not the type of Pokemon you can just throw onto a team and expect instant improvements; in fact, doing so will usually have the opposite effect.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The moves listed in the above sets are those that Ambipom will get the most use out of; however, its relatively wide movepool grants it quite a few alternative options. Fire Punch does a decent amount of damage to Bronzong and can combat the rare Escavalier. Aerial Ace hits Fighting-types such as Hitmontop hard and is boosted by Technician, but outside of this, its coverage is redundant. Thunder Wave, Knock Off, and Taunt are all good support moves, but Ambipom's poor bulk means that it will have difficulty using the moves effectively. Ambipom is also able to boost its stats via Hone Claws, Agility, and Nasty Plot; however, once again, Ambipom's frailty means it is often hard-pressed to find an opportunity to use such moves without taking heavy damage. Lastly, while a moveset of nothing but Fake Out and Last Resort may look appealing, it requires far too much support to be worthwhile and is easily walled otherwise.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ambipom can hit hard, but it doesn't hit excessively hard. As such, Pokemon that have immunities and resistances to its STAB moves, as well as those that possess natural bulk, make good counters to it. Sableye stands out as a great counter, as it is immune to both Ambipom's Normal- and Fighting-type moves and can shrug off its Dark- and Ghost-type coverage moves. Sableye can burn Ambipom with Will-O-Wisp, Recover off any damage done, and seriously hurt it with Foul Play. Bulky Steel-types such as Bronzong, Registeel, and Cobalion can cause Ambipom problems, with Cobalion being able to OHKO with its Fighting-type move of choice. However, with the exception of Bronzong, these Pokemon should be wary of Low Kick as it will leave a mark, especially on Cobalion that do not invest in Defense. Rhyperior is in a similar category as the Steel-types, but it doesn't have to fear Low Kick as much thanks to Solid Rock and its gargantuan defense. It does have to watch out for the odd Seed Bomb though, as it will 2HKO. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Milotic and Slowbro all make fine switch-ins and have the potential to burn Ambipom with Scald. Beat Up with a full team will hurt Slowbro, but Regenerator can offset the damage done. Switcheroo is a danger to all defensive Pokemon, so they should proceed with extra caution against the Choice Band set.</p> <p>If taking hits is not an option, faster Pokemon with strong or super effective moves are a good way to check Ambipom. Pokemon that fit this bill include Crobat, Weavile, and Choice Scarf Heracross. Strong priority from the likes of Azumarill, Arcanine, and Honchkrow can also put Ambipom away swiftly. Ambipom is winning no awards defensively, so most neutral hits send it to the grave soon enough.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Strong priority, coverage, and Speed are what Ambipom has going for it, and this set looks to utilize these elements to the fullest. Ambipom's Fake Out is a useful tool for revenging weakened faster Pokemon and maintaining offensive momentum. The combination of Technician-boosted Fake Out and STAB Return will do significant damage to Pokemon lacking bulk or a resistance to it. Low Kick looks to deals with Rock- and Steel-types that would shrug off Normal-type assaults, while Beat Up does away with Ghost-types that are immune to the rest of Ambipom's moves. Low Kick's variable Base Power works well with Technician, as Technician boosts it against foes it hits for low Base Power, while it still maintains high power against heavier Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Registeel. Beat Up is Ambipom's best shot at damaging defensive juggernauts such as Cofagrigus and Slowbro, cleanly 2HKOing Offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus with a team of at least five remaining Pokemon and having a chance to 2HKO defensive Slowbro after Stealth Rock with a full team of six. While lacking the benefits of Beat Up, Shadow Claw is a more reliable alternative and still fares well against Ghost-types such as Mismagius.</p> <p>Life Orb is the item of choice here, as it allows Ambipom to maintain coverage while striking as hard as possible. The given EVs maximize Ambipom's Attack and Speed, while the leftover EVs are placed in Special Defense to avoid giving Pokemon with the Download ability a Special Attack boost. Low Sweep is an option over Low Kick, providing a potentially useful Speed drop. However, be aware that Low Sweep strengthens the power of Gyro Ball, most notably from Bronzong, a common Ambipom switch-in. Seed Bomb is also an option over Low Kick, as it is able to 2HKO Rhyperior and OHKO Swampert, which usually take Ambipom's other moves with relative ease.</p> <p>As with all offensive Pokemon, hazards enhance Ambipom's efficacy. Qwilfish makes a fine teammate for Ambipom, as it can switch in comfortably on the Fighting-types that Ambipom tends to draw and lay Spikes. Roserade can also support with Spikes and can set up with ease on bulky Water-types that love to switch into Ambipom as well as defensive Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus. Swampert is a good source of Stealth Rock and can sponge hits directed at Ambipom thanks to its great bulk and typing. Offensively, Ambipom works well with Heracross, which can deal with problematic Pokemon such as Rhyperior while Ambipom is able to lure and severely injure Cofagrigus, which Heracross has an incredibly hard time breaking through. Mienshao is in a similar boat to Heracross, but it can also help break through Gligar, which Ambipom struggles to beat, with a timely Hidden Power Ice.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set works well due to the popularity of Ambipom's Life Orb set. Pokemon expecting to sponge a Fake Out will take a powerful Choice Band-boosted Return to the face. As this set has no priority to fall back on, it is very reliant on Ambipom's Speed in order to do work. Return is its main weapon, with Low Kick providing coverage against Rock- and Steel-types. The last two moves are where it gets interesting. Beat Up is a great option for keeping Ghost-types at bay. Pursuit, however, is an interesting choice, as it gives Ambipom the opportunity to trap Pokemon such as Mismagius Choice-locked into Shadow Ball. Outside of this, however, a weak Dark-type move is a dangerous thing to be locked into, so exercise caution when using it. Switcheroo is undoubtedly the ace up Ambipom's sleeve. It has the ability to cripple the many defensive Pokemon that commonly switch into Ambipom, such as Suicune, Cofagrigus, and Slowbro. Be careful about using Switcheroo against physically based Ambipom counters such as Rhyperior, however, as this strategy can end up backfiring. U-turn is a usable alternative, allowing Ambipom to take advantage of the switches that it causes to maintain offensive momentum by gaining a more favorable match-up.</p> <p>The given EVs bolster Ambipom's Attack and Speed as much as possible, while the remaining EVs are placed in Special Defense to deny Download Pokemon a Special Attack boost. Entry hazards are very much appreciated. Qwilfish and Roserade make great partners for their ability to set up and sponge hits from Fighting-types and bulky Water- or Ghost-types, respectively. Bronzong is a novel choice for Stealth Rock as it can weather hits in Ambipom's stead while throwing out Toxic to break down defensive Pokemon, making them easier to run through later on. Offensively, this Ambipom pairs well with Azumarill because of its ability to hamper bulky Water-types by leaving them stuck with a Choice Band. Azumarill, which usually struggles to get past bulky Water-types, will have a far easier time with them Choice-locked and unable to counter it properly. In return, Azumarill easily deals with Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Gligar, which tend to cause Ambipom problems. Rotom-H works well as an offensive partner too and, when Ambipom is using U-turn, can form a VoltTurn duo with it. Rotom-H zaps bulky Water-types and fries problematic Steel-types such as Bronzong and Registeel, while Ambipom breaks through Umbreon and Snorlax in return.</p> "

  "Drifblim": {
    "overview": "<p>Drifblim is a very peculiar Pokemon. At first glance, it may appear to be a unique and incredible Pokemon with multiple options to choose from. This stems mostly from Drifblim's colossal base 150 HP stat, decent Speed and offensive stats, and vast movepool. However, any presumptions made about Drifblim in that respect are unfortunately false. While it does possess a sizable support movepool, it's largely outclassed by its Ghost-type brethren because it does not have reliable recovery or good defenses. With a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, Drifblim will also be hard-pressed to find a chance to switch in. In terms of being played as an offensive Ghost-type, Drifblim faces fierce competition from Mismagius, which has much higher Speed and Special Attack stats as well as Nasty Plot. All is not lost for Drifblim, though, as it does have a few tricks up its sleeve. With access to Calm Mind, Will-O-Wisp, Baton Pass, a great ability in Unburden, and workable bulk and Speed, Drifblim can be a very good Pokemon if played correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Drifblim has a respectable movepool, it is the perfect example of a jack of all trades, master of none.</p> <p>A weather support set is possible and can work very well with Drifblim's movepool, but such a set is a bit underwhelming when compared to other weather starters. Of course, being a Ghost-type, Drifblim has access to the always annoying double status strategy, which can be effective if played correctly; however, Drifblim has much better things to do than spread status around. Pain Split can be used in order to give Drifblim a semi-reliable method of healing itself, but due to its high base HP stat, Drifblim won't be able to make much use out of Pain Split unless it's extremely low on health. A more committed support set is definitely possible with Drifblim's movepool, but it faces fierce competition from Cofagrigus and Dusclops, which boast better defensive capabilities and methods of healing.</p> <p>Drifblim's offensive movepool is large enough that a Charge Beam or even non-boosting set is possible, but Calm Mind is generally better due to Drifblim's more defensive nature. A purely offensive set would also be outclassed by Mismagius, which has access to Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Flying and Recycle are other possible options for the ChestoRest set for extra STAB coverage and virtually infinite instant recovery, respectively. However, both are situational and don't hold as much use as the recommended and additional options already mentioned.</p> <p>Drifblim's Dream World ability, Flare Boost, boosts its Special Attack stat by 1.5 when it is burned. However while Flare Boost is unique to Drifblim, it's not even close to holding more use than Unburden or even Aftermath. This is because Drifblim will be losing HP every turn without a reliable method of healing itself, making him an inferior Mismagius.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Drifblim's checks and counters are very straightforward: Dark-types and special sponges.</p> <p>Porygon2, Snorlax, and Registeel have no problems switching into Drifblim, walling and either outstalling or setting up on it. Suicune and Spiritomb can Calm Mind alongside Drifblim and will quickly stall out his PP with Pressure. However, neither Pokemon can directly switch into Drifblim and defeat it, requiring either Roar or very good luck with Sleep Talk. Umbreon can come in effortlessly and accumulate many Curse boosts. Drifblim exposes itself to the threat of Pursuit users such as Escavalier and Heracross, making them excellent checks as well. Bisharp doesn't mind switching into a Thunderbolt or Calm Mind, setting up a Swords Dance or two and mauling Drifblim with one of its extremely powerful Sucker Punches or Pursuits. Krookodile doesn't mind switching into Drifblim either and not only outpaces it but also traps it with Pursuit. Mandibuzz can switch into everything Drifblim can toss out, barring a boosted Thunderbolt, and phaze it with Whirlwind. Forcing Drifblim to use its Chesto Berry early will undoubtedly make it much easier to counter, so one should keep this in mind if it ever shows up.</p> ",

        "name": "AcroBlimp",
        "description": "<p>As the popularity of Spikes-stacking in UU continues to increase, the need for spinblockers rises accordingly. Drifblim serves a unique purpose among its Ghost-type counterparts: preventing Foresight Hitmontop from using Rapid Spin. Most opponents attempt to remove entry hazards as quickly as possible--a tendency you can use to your advantage. After your Roserade sets up Spikes or Toxic Spikes, the opponent will likely send in Hitmontop to use Rapid Spin. Drifblim can switch into Rapid Spin directly, nullifying the opponent's attempt to remove Stealth Rock and Spikes from the field, or it can switch into Foresight. Desperate to use Rapid Spin and unaware of Drifblim's offensive capabilities, many opponents will use Rapid Spin the turn after using Foresight, expecting it to be successful due to Foresight's effect; to their dismay, Drifblim outspeeds and OHKOes their defensive Hitmontop with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Drifblim performs similarly well against other spinners such as Claydol and Foresight-less Blastoise; however, Drifblim cannot spinblock against a healthy Foresight Blastoise due to its inability to OHKO with Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics.</p> <p>Surprisingly, Drifblim functions equally well as an offensive Pokemon. Acrobatics is deceptively strong--it OHKOes frailer foes such as Houndoom and 2HKOes bulkier offensive Pokemon such as Flygon and Kingdra. Because Acrobatics is Drifblim's only attack, Steel-types pose a significant threat to this set's effectiveness; however, Drifblim can take many of them down through proper use of Substitute and Will-O-Wisp. After burn's Attack cut, Drifblim's Substitutes withstand Bronzong's Gyro Ball and Registeel's Ice Punch; accompanied by burn damage, Acrobatics KOes Bronzong and Registeel before they can KO in return. Be especially wary of Empoleon and Magneton: Empoleon forces Drifblim out of play with Roar and Magneton forces Drifblim to switch or use Destiny Bond. In addition to maiming Steel-types, Will-O-Wisp slices through offensive Pokemon and increases the likelihood of Drifblim surviving an attack with a Substitute intact. Outside of providing protection against Steel-types, stalling for burn damage, and dodging Sucker Punch, Substitute blocks Toxic from defensive Gligar, Sleep Powder from defensive Roserade, and Night Shade from Dusclops. After using Substitute against one of these Pokemon, Drifblim can either burn them with Will-O-Wisp or KO them with Acrobatics, activating Unburden. With Unburden's Speed boost, Drifblim can deal significant damage to subsequent Pokemon with Acrobatics or Destiny Bond. Destiny Bond takes out slower revenge killers as well as Pokemon that wall this set such as Zapdos and Empoleon.</p> <p>With the designated Attack EVs, Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics deals a minimum of 100% damage to defensive Hitmontop. Coincidentally, the Attack EVs guarantee 2HKOs against offensive Flygon and offensive Kingdra after Stealth Rock. The given Speed EVs allow Drifblim to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Flygon and Jolly Choice Scarf Victini, two common revenge killers, after Unburden's Speed boost. The remaining 104 EVs go into Defense, giving Drifblim's Substitutes a better chance of surviving a burned RestTalk Snorlax's Crunch. The Defense EVs are also helpful for switching into U-turn, taking Heracross's Megahorn, and surviving weak priority attacks. There is only one other viable alternatives for the last moveslot: Hypnosis. Hypnosis nets Drifblim one or two free turns in which it can set up a Substitute or KO the opposing Pokemon; however its accuracy prevents it from being a primary option.</p> <p>As this set's purpose is to prevent the opponent from using Rapid Spin, you should pair Drifblim with a Stealth Rock user or Spikes Roserade. Offensive teams and defensive teams benefit equally from Drifblim's ability to spinblock; offensive teams appreciate the extra kick afforded to their attacks by Spikes and Stealth Rock, and defensive teams appreciate the passive damage caused by the opponent's constant switching. Drifblim does not require specific defensive partners; simply pair Drifblim with Pokemon, such as Cobalion and Registeel, that resist its weaknesses.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "ChestoRest",
        "description": "<p>The idea here is to stack up as many Calm Mind boosts as possible and use Rest once Drifblim takes a considerable amount of damage. This will cause Drifblim to use up its Chesto Berry and activate Unburden, doubling its Speed and giving it a very good shot at sweeping. Shadow Ball is Drifblim's most reliable STAB attack and is fairly easy to complement in coverage due to it having only two resistances and one immunity. In regards to coverage, Thunderbolt is the best option in the last slot, as it lets Drifblim hit bulky Water-types such as Empoleon and Suicune (which can Calm Mind alongside Drifblim) for heavy damage and Dark-, Steel-, and Normal-types for at least neutral damage.</p> <p>This set is best left to sweeping later in the game, but running a support option in the fourth slot is also viable.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Drifblim will outpace +1 Speed Yanmega and Sharpedo once Unburden is activated. This is very important, as it significantly reduces the chance that either Pokemon will be able to revenge kill Drifblim if they carry Protect. Unfortunately, Drifblim with Hidden Power Fighting will never outpace Choice Scarf Krookodile as said Hidden Power requires an imperfect Speed IV. Drifblim's high base HP makes investment into said stat almost unnoticeable, so more focus is placed on Drifblim's Defense. Because Drifblim is running Calm Mind, its Defense stat is maxed out to complement the Special Defense boosts. The remaining EVs are delegated to Drifblim's Special Attack for much needed power; with 267 Special Attack and a Modest nature, Drifblim can 3HKO Suicune with an unboosted Thunderbolt and OHKO Victini with Shadow Ball after a single boost. Drifblim has a plethora of options to choose from, but only a few are usable on this set. Hidden Power Fighting partners up with Shadow Ball well in terms of coverage, making it a solid option. However, keep in mind that Porygon2 and Snorlax can still wall Drifblim. Will-O-Wisp is also usable because it works in tandem with Calm Mind, allowing Drifblim to tank hits from both physical and special attackers; however, keep in mind that Will-O-Wisp will not help with threats such as Snorlax, which can Rest away the burn and Whirlwind Drifblim; Houndoom, which is immune to burn; and most importantly, Heracross, which receives a deadly Attack boost from the burn due to Guts. Drifblim's movepool is without a doubt large, but because of how this set functions, there aren't many extremely helpful moves to choose from, so keep this in mind if one is considering any alterations.</p> <p>Like any dedicated special attacker not running Psyshock, this set has problems with special walls, sponges, and tanks such as Porygon2, Snorlax, and Registeel. Drifblim's typing is a double-edged sword, granting it an immunity to Ground-, Normal-, and Fighting-type attacks but leaving him with a Stealth Rock weakness. To remedy this problem, Hitmontop can be used as Drifblim's partner. While there isn't much type synergy between the two, Hitmontop complements Drifblim well by spinning away entry hazards and scaring away most of the Pokemon that can outright wall Drifblim. Nidoqueen is also a fairly good choice for a teammate because it has access to Toxic Spikes and decent synergy with Drifblim. Similarly, Cobalion can switch into Porygon2, Snorlax, and Registeel, fearing only the occasional status attack or Earthquake from the last two (which is unlikely to be used on Drifblim); it can then proceed to set up a Swords Dance, and break down walls that would otherwise give Drifblim problems. In return, Drifblim can set up on the Pokemon that give Cobalion troubles, namely Dusclops and Slowbro.</p> <p>This set should be played defensively early in the game and more aggressively as the game progresses; keep this in mind at all times. There are many Pokemon that don't mind switching into Drifblim and scaring it away. Drifblim certainly isn't the strongest Pokemon either, so one should be more focused on weakening its threats, giving it a much better shot at sweeping. Pokemon with super effective moves such as Weavile and Raikou can be worn down with entry hazards and unboosted attacks, respectively; bulkier threats such as Snorlax and Eviolite Ferroseed must be slowly worn down over time or lured into an unexpected KO. Regardless of how bulky a threat to Drifblim is, it must be weakened over the course of the game so Drifblim has enough breathing room to stack up a few Calm Minds and sweep.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>A lot has changed since the beginning of BW UU, and Mismagius finds its old niches taken up by newer Ghost-types. Cofagrigus or Sableye make better spinblockers and bulky Ghost-types, the former thanks to a significant bulk advantage, and the latter has the ability to effectively stallbreak by having priority on moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Recover, and Taunt. Mismagius holds on to the small niche of a fast setup sweeper, which no other Ghost-type can do as effectively. That's not Mismagius's only advantage. It has the ability Levitate, which when combined with Ghost typing, gives three immunities for potential free switches and set up attempts. Thanks to the consequential Spikes immunity and the lack of Stealth Rock weakness, Mismagius is the most hazard-resistant Ghost-type in UU. While hazard stacking teams make Cofagrigus's life hard, Mismagius will never have to lose more than an eighth of its health to hazards. It might not be as solid of a counter as Cofagrigus is, but Mismagius can still check powerful Fighting-types like Heracross and Mienshao with its immunity to their STAB, while still providing an offensive presence.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>There aren't many other options Mismagius can effectively run aside from those listed. A Choice Scarf set is very fast, but it lacks the raw power of other Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao. Most of its moves are not very good to be locked into either.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Umbreon can shut Mismagius down, as it can tank Hidden Power Fighting and threaten with Payback. Snorlax with Crunch can tank Hidden Power Fighting even better and OHKO back. Some Snorlax can also Whirlwind away Mismagius's boosts if it lacks Taunt. Weavile, Sharpedo, Zoroark, and Choice Scarf Krookodile are faster and can easily OHKO it, but they have to watch for Substitute sets that can dodge the Dark-type move and hit with Hidden Power Fighting, and they aren't safe switching into her. Fast Choice Scarf users such as Darmanitan, Victini, and Flygon can check Nasty Plot Mismagius, but again they have to be careful switching into it as STAB Shadow Ball can hurt. Azumarill can revenge kill Mismagius with a powerful Aqua Jet after a few turns of Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage. Crobat is naturally faster than Mismagius and can threaten it with a powerful STAB Brave Bird, and bulkier sets can even switch in without fear. Dark-types with Sucker Punch such as Houndoom, Honchkrow, and Bisharp can play mind games, threatening with Sucker Punch if Mismagius attacks, or a powerful move if it Nasty Plots again. Substitute sets can negate this to an extent, but Mismagius has a hard time breaking though Honchkrow without Thunderbolt.</p> ",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<p>This set embodies Mismagius's niche. This set is meant to get into battle after a KO or take advantage of one of Mismagius's three immunities, set up a Nasty Plot quickly, then finish off weakened teams with blazing Speed and boosted attacks. Mismagius's strongest move is its STAB Shadow Ball, which becomes very formidable after a boost. It is the main move used in sweeping teams, as after some residual damage, it is very hard to survive. Hidden Power Fighting provides perfect coverage with Shadow Ball, hitting Normal-, Dark-, and Steel-types for super effective damage. While its Base Power isn't very high, after a boost it still manages to finish off most Pokemon that resist Ghost-type attacks. It can also achieve the impressive feat of 2HKOing Porygon2, Umbreon, and Snorlax with some hazards. However, the latter two can threaten with physical Dark-type moves that can ruin Mismagius. Thunderbolt allows Mismagius to break through Togekiss, whose special bulk and neutrality to Fighting-type attacks make it hard to scratch. It deals more damage to Empoleon than Hidden Power Fighting, and allows Mismagius to OHKO it with just one layer of Spikes or a little residual damage. Taunt is a viable move in the last slot, as it allows Mismagius to prevent support Pokemon from crippling her with status, or healing off damage. It also allows it to set up on RestTalk Snorlax, but it must still beware Crunch.</p> <p>The EVs are very simple; Mismagius just needs to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Substitute can be used in the fourth slot to ease prediction in case a faster check tries to switch into battle. When it hides behind a Substitute, Mismagius has a clear shot at them with Shadow Ball or Hidden Power Fighting, or it can switch safely out of Pursuit. Substitutes will wear Mismagius down quickly combined with Life Orb recoil, so Leftovers can be used instead of Life Orb for more Substitutes at the cost of needed offensive power. Will-O-Wisp can also be used in the fourth slot to cripple any physical attacker, but the support move is a little out of place on a set dedicated to sweeping.</p> <p>Like any sweeper, Mismagius loves entry hazards. Mismagius cleans up the opposing team, so hazards and residual damage are absolutely necessary so it can do its job. Scolipede makes a great teammate for these purposes; thanks to its high Speed, it is easily able to set up multiple layers of Spikes which will chip away at the opponent's Pokemon throughout the battle. That gives Mismagius a much easier sweep late-game. Offensively, Swords Dance Cobalion makes a great partner for Mismagius. Cobalion attracts bulky waters and Gligar to the field to stop its sweep, and Mismagius has no qualms switching into weak Scalds or Earthquake thanks to its special bulk and Ground-type immunity. Inversely, Cobalion loves switching into Snorlax and Umbreon, and gets a Justified boost from their Dark-type attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<p>Mismagius is often seen being used offensively due to its high Speed and Special Attack and access to neat setup options in Nasty Plot and Calm Mind; however, Mismagius is equipped with the necessary qualities to make it a viable defensive Ghost-type. Unlike Cofagrigus and Sableye, Mismagius packs significantly more Speed, better special bulk, and Levitate to minimize the entry hazard damage both Cofagrigus and Sableye are vulnerable to. Furthermore, Mismagius boasts a wide variety of support moves that Cofagrigus, and to an extent Sableye, lack. Because of this, Mismagius deals with a variety of offensive threats, such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Mienshao, Rhyperior, and Heracross, very well.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp is the primary status move of choice, as it cripples a whole slew of physical threats that can prove troublesome to Mismagius and its teammates, and further improves Mismagius's walling capabilities. On the other hand, Thunder Wave differentiates Mismagius from its fellow Ghost-types and can be used to neuter troublesome opponents, particularly faster threats such as Crobat, Cobalion, and Raikou. Heal Bell is another move exclusive to Mismagius as a Ghost-type and helps rid itself and its teammates of harmful status effects. However, if cleric support is not necessary, Mismagius makes a great user of Taunt due to its high Speed. This makes it a great stallbreaker, but keep in mind that Mismagius faces stiff competition with Sableye as a stallbreaker because of Sableye's Prankster ability and access to a more reliable recovery move. As a final alternative, Mismagius is the only notable Ghost-type to claim Perish Song, which is a decent option over the previous two moves, as it is able to dispose of sweepers that cannot be handled easily, such as Curse Snorlax and Calm Mind Suicune. Lastly, Pain Split is Mismagius's only form of reliable recovery, and Shadow Ball provides it with a decent STAB attack to avoid being Taunt bait.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Mismagius to outpace neutral-natured max Speed Kingdra, Heracross, and Nidoking to burn or Taunt them before they make a move, and the rest of the EVs are dumped into HP and Defense to take on physical hits better outside of a Will-O-Wisp burn; the Defense EVs specifically provide a Defense jump point. It's also possible to use an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature to outpace max Speed base 100s such as Victini, which seeks enjoyment switching into Will-O-Wisp. Also, Protect can be used over Pain Split if you prefer to capitalize on burn damage and stall Perish Song turns.</p> <p>As Mismagius fits nicely on bulky offense teams, it's recommended to utilize Pokemon that allow Mismagius to take advantage of its strengths, namely its Fighting immunity and status and cleric support. Curse Snorlax works really well because it lures in Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Heracross that Mismagius can switch into and potentially burn; Snorlax also appreciates the Heal Bell support should he be running Rest as well. Since Mismagius often lures in Dark- and Steel-types such as Umbreon and Cobalion, Hitmontop works great to dispose of them relatively easily with Close Combat; it benefits from Heal Bell as well should it have been crippled with burn or poison status. Finally, given that Mismagius performs well as a spinblocker, entry hazard support is recommended. Rhyperior and Aggron can use Stealth Rock, and their Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses are handily taken care of by Mismagius. Aggron also has access to Thunder Wave, making it and Mismagius a decent paralysis-spreading core should Mismagius use Thunder Wave itself, which in turn allows Pokemon such as Bulk Up Scrafty, Swords Dance Heracross, and Nasty Plot Porygon-Z to take advantage of the crippled opposition. In terms of Spikes support, Omastar is a great option that also appreciates Mismagius covering its Ground- and Fighting-type weaknesses.</p> "

This set can come in on slow special attackers, set up a Substitute to dodge status and ease prediction, then start setting up Calm Minds.

The suggested spread maximizes power and Speed again, but bulkier spreads are viable. 112 HP EVs ensure that U-turn from the likes of Jolly Choice Scarf Darmanitan and Flygon will never break its Substitute. 224 HP EVs guarantee against Adamant Darmanitan, and gives its Substitute a fighting chance against Blastoise's Scald without a Calm Mind boost. Not even maximum investment can guarantee the Substitute will survive a Scald from UU's plethora of bulky Water-types. Overall, Mismagius's physical bulk is impossible to save, and her special bulk is already getting a boost.</p> <p>This set appreciates type synergy more as it comes in and out of battle. Cobalion becomes even more solid a partner, as it resists both of Mismagius's weaknesses, and in turn Mismagius is immune to two of Cobalion's three weaknesses. The pair can trade places throughout the match, setting up and weakening each other's counters. While it doesn't have the same type synergy as Cobalion, Swords Dance Heracross is a great offensive partner for Mismagius. It can still come into Mismagius's full stops like Snorlax and Umbreon, and during the switch it can prepare to devastate the opposing team with Swords Dance. This set cannot deal a lot of damage quickly, but that is exactly what Swords Dance Heracross does well. Its massive power will protect Mismagius's team against tough stall teams.</p> "

  "Honchkrow": {
    "overview": "<p>Looks can be deceiving, but that's not the case with Honchkrow. Being the mob boss-looking bird that it is, it looks like it would have some pretty high stats to take advantage of. Honchkrow's base 125 Attack stat is the best thing about it, and when used in combination with powerful STAB moves such as Brave Bird and Sucker Punch, it makes life very difficult for those who play against it. Dropping down from BL last generation, Honchkrow has only gotten better in this generation because of its Dream World ability: Moxie. Honchkrow can also use moves such as Superpower and Heat Wave with Moxie, making it even more threatening. This is nothing but good news for Honchkrow, but bad news for the rest of the metagame, as the Rock- and Steel-types that were once strong checks to Honchkrow, such as Registeel and Rhyperior, now fare much worse against it. Sacrificing Pokemon to Honchkrow is now much more dangerous, because it can completely sweep teams after it gets an Attack boost or two.</p> <p>That being said, Honchkrow has some pretty crippling flaws. While it boasts one of the most powerful priority attacks in the game in STAB Sucker Punch, it is extremely reliant on the move to hit faster opponents, of which there are many in the UU metagame. Zapdos, Raikou, Shaymin, Cobalion, and others are all faster than Honchkrow, and have enough bulk to take a Sucker Punch and hit Honchkrow back hard. While this issue can be somewhat fixed with paralysis support, Honchkrow's over-reliance on the move makes it rather predictable. Also, Honchkrow's only noteworthy defensive stat is its high HP; while it helps to mitigate Brave Bird recoil, Honchkrow's poor defenses leave it unable to take a hit, and it will fall to most decently-powered STAB attacks. This means that Honchkrow has to KO everything in its path in order to sweep, which is a tough task before any Attack boosts are attained. While Honchkrow has a very threatening movepool, it suffers heavily from four-moveslot syndrome, making it unable to use all the right moves in all the right places. Nevertheless, Honchkrow is a major threat in today's metagame that every team should have a solid answer to.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Honchkrow has a bunch of other options it can utilize, but most of them aren't any good. Honchkrow has a couple of moves that can boost its Special Attack such as Nasty Plot and Calm Mind. Nasty Plot would be better suited for Honchkrow because of its awful bulk, and you'd probably want to use a mixed Nasty Plot set to incorporate Sucker Punch, because otherwise, Honchkrow can't take on faster opponents at all. That being said, a bulky Calm Mind set consisting of Calm Mind, Dark Pulse, Rest, and Sleep Talk employs the conventional mono-attacker, but RestTalk is bad in BW due to the sleep mechanics. While Moxie is clearly the better ability, Honchkrow can take some slack off of its teammates with Insomnia, making it a good check to threats such as Roserade and Lilligant that use Sleep Powder along with their Grass-type STAB attacks. Perish Song and Mean Look form a lethal combination, but Honchkrow typically won't last long enough to stall out the turns for Perish Song. Payback might seem like a good choice due to Honchkrow's low Speed, but Honchkrow can't take a hit in the first place, and it will be extremely weak against slower opponents. Honchkrow has the movepool for a defensive set; Thunder Wave, Toxic, Haze, and Whirlwind would make for a great set, but for now that role is done better by something with better defenses.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Zapdos is generally the best all-purpose counter to Honchkrow, with physically defensive variants obviously being ideal. Physically defensive Zapdos has the bulk to switch into Brave Bird easily, and can use Roost to avoid Sucker Punch before it KOes with Discharge or Thunderbolt. Even offensive Zapdos is a strong check to Honchkrow, as it can take a Life Orb-boosted Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock. Rhyperior is a similarly strong check, as it can take all of Honchkrow's attacks comfortably bar Hidden Power Grass; it's not even 2HKOed by a Life Orb Superpower thanks to its immense physical bulk paired with Solid Rock. It can even use Rock Blast to beat Substitute variants of Honchkrow. Gligar is immensely bulky with Eviolite, and can even take two Life Orb Brave Birds after Stealth Rock. If Gligar can land a timely Toxic, it can force Honchkrow to its doom; Taunt has a similar effect by preventing Honchkrow from using Roost, so it succumbs to Brave Bird recoil.</p> <p>When attempting to check Honchkrow, the main order of business is finding a way to avoid Sucker Punch. Of course, faster Pokemon that resist the move such as Cobalion and Heracross are ideal when dealing with Honchkrow, but Choice Scarf Honchkrow gives both of them a run for their money. Shaymin, Raikou, and Crobat are other Pokemon that have the bulk to take a Life Orb Sucker Punch and retaliate, but in Shaymin's case, it must be carrying Hidden Power Ice to significantly damage Honchkrow. Mismagius is a good check that can use Will-O-Wisp to burn Honchkrow, thus avoiding Sucker Punch despite its weakness to it. It can also use Substitute to put Honchkrow into a checkmate position, but like many of Life Orb Honchkrow's checks, it loses to the Choice Scarf set. Porygon2 is a decent check to Honchkrow that can't really switch in, but can beat Honchkrow all the same; it can take a Life Orb Superpower thanks to Eviolite, and then KO Honchkrow with Discharge, Thunderbolt, or Ice Beam; it's also a full stop to the Choice Scarf set, as the standard defensive set can avoid the 2HKO from Superpower. Because the Choice Scarf set lacks the raw power of the Life Orb set, bulky Water-types are good checks as well. Milotic, Suicune, and Swampert can all check Honchkrow somewhat effectively thanks to their well-placed stats; the former can use Toxic to stall Honchkrow out, while the latter two can use Ice Beam or Ice Punch to bring it down. While having one of the aforementioned checks to Honchkrow will certainly help you, sometimes you'll just have to play around it to win. You can try to force it into using Brave Bird and making it take a lot of recoil damage, or stall out Sucker Punch's PP by using non-attacking moves. The main thing to remember is that Honchkrow must be stopped before it can acquire too many Attack boosts, because it can snowball into an OHKO machine very quickly.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>This is Honchkrow's flagship set, striking fear into the hearts of every player and threatening offense and stall alike. Once Honchkrow can get a kill or two, it becomes almost impossible to stop as it can destroy every Pokemon that doesn't resist Brave Bird, kill all fast offensive Pokemon with Sucker Punch, and obliterate all Rock- and Steel-types with Superpower. If you can open up a spot on your team to fit Honchkrow, its downfall will be by its own hand most of the time, as opposed to your opponent's. Honchkrow hits brutally hard, and you can't allow it to kill anything on your team, as otherwise, you'll fall prey to the mighty bird. Brave Bird and Sucker Punch are the two main moves on the set, making use of Honchkrow's semi-unique STAB combination. Generally speaking, Brave Bird finds more use against slower opponents, as they tend to be bulkier, while Sucker Punch finds more use against faster ones. Brave Bird is capable of 2HKOing almost all physical walls in UU that don't resist it, with Gligar being the rare exception. Sucker Punch is also a very good move for Honchkrow, as it can KO most faster threats with the move before they can hit, especially the numerous fast Psychic- and Ghost-types in UU such as Azelf and Mismagius.</p> <p>While Brave Bird and Sucker Punch form the core threat of Moxie Honchkrow, Superpower is a fancy toy that is very beneficial as well. What would seem to be solid counters to Honchkrow, such as Empoleon, Rhyperior, Registeel, and Bronzong, are all hit hard by Superpower, leaving them unable to stop Honchkrow's sweep. Superpower is also useful against Snorlax and Porygon2, with the former causing Honchkrow to take ridiculous amounts of recoil if using Brave Bird, and the latter boasting extremely high Defense due to Eviolite. However, Heat Wave is another long-lost friend for Honchkrow, and can be used as well, most notably hitting threats such as Cobalion, Escavalier, and Ferroseed harder. It's generally not necessary though, as the latter two are hit hard by Brave Bird anyway, and Cobalion outspeeds Honchkrow and takes little from Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Instead of Heat Wave, Roost is the preferred option in the last slot. While it will rarely be of use, it is wonderful for healing off the damage taken from Life Orb and Brave Bird, and no other move is generally needed anyway. It is best used when your opponent tries to play around Sucker Punch and tries to lure Brave Bird, but with Roost you can stay one step ahead. Substitute is a good move in Honchkrow's repertoire that works well in conjunction with Roost, as it is good for avoiding status and decreasing Honchkrow's reliance on Sucker Punch. However, Substitute can also be used with Heat Wave to break walls effectively. Heat Wave is the better option in tandem with Substitute because Superpower makes Honchkrow's sweep harder to attain in a shorter period of time, and also makes Honchkrow's already frail Substitutes easier to break. Pursuit is another good option in the last slot as an easy way to get Honchkrow's sweep started, as Honchkrow can trap a weakened Xatu or Slowbro to get its first Attack boost, and then it will be all downhill for your opponent from there. However, if you don't use Roost, then Honchkrow's sweep will often be cut short by Life Orb and Brave Bird recoil.</p> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed is the optimal EV distribution if you're not using Heat Wave; Honchkrow is most effective when it's as fast as possible while hitting as hard as possible. Note that only 196 Speed EVs are needed to outspeed uninvested base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Xatu and Arcanine, but maximum Speed is better as the remaining EVs wouldn't add much bulk, and that way you can avoid the Speed creep with Xatu and Arcanine as well as opposing Honchkrow. However, if using Heat Wave, feel free to subtract EVs from Speed and Special to leave about 60 EVs to be placed in Special Attack, slightly increasing the power of Heat Wave. Life Orb is the preferred item on the set and provides a sizable boost to all of Honchkrow's moves. The added recoil generally isn't an issue thanks to Roost, which makes it an absolute necessity if not using Substitute. If you are going to use Substitute, though, Leftovers is an option to reduce the damage taken from Substitute, Brave Bird, and possibly Stealth Rock. It helps with this problem to some degree, but not enough to drastically enhance the set's performance.</p> <p>Needless to say, Honchkrow has some other moves that it can use on the set from its wide movepool. Taunt is the first thing that can be of some use, and like Substitute, protects Honchkrow from status. It works especially well in combination with Sucker Punch, as it forces the opponent to attack, making the move unavoidable except by switching. However, the health lost in order to create Substitutes can be easily replenished by using Roost, and Substitute allows Honchkrow to shield itself against revenge killers that can take a Sucker Punch, such as Cobalion. Night Slash is another good option that Honchkrow can make use of; it is especially useful against slower Pokemon such as Slowbro that are hit super effectively by it, but can use a status move to avoid Sucker Punch altogether. It doesn't find a place on the set most of the time though, as Honchkrow has more important moves to use. Hidden Power Grass is viable to hit Rhyperior and Swampert, but Rhyperior commonly invests heavily in Special Defense, and Swampert takes a lot of damage from Brave Bird in the first place.</p> <p>Paralysis support is the most important thing that Honchkrow asks of its teammates. Several Pokemon can take a Sucker Punch, but are also naturally faster than Honchkrow, such as Raikou, Cobalion, and Crobat. Therefore, good teammates are those that can inflict paralysis upon them, such as Slowbro, Togekiss, Registeel, and Snorlax. Entry hazards are also appreciated to aid Honchkrow in its sweep; not only does it make several Pokemon much more vulnerable to Sucker Punch, it lessens the recoil taken from Brave Bird against slower opponents. Roserade, Scolipede, Rhyperior, and Qwilfish are all good hazard users, and Honchkrow can help them by trapping Xatu with Pursuit. Of course, a Xatu of your own would be a wise choice, as Honchkrow is weak to Stealth Rock and can't afford to take any more residual damage than it already does. Magneton is a good partner that pretty much eliminates the need for Superpower, because it can trap nearly all of the Steel-types in the metagame, giving Honchkrow a free sweep most of the time. Flygon functions similarly as a partner, as it lures in Steel-types to take an Outrage, but can hit them all hard with Earthquake, or even Fire Punch for Bronzong.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Honchkrow's main problem is that it isn't particularly fast, nor particularly bulky. This makes it very reliant on Sucker Punch to do its dirty work, and sometimes it just can't get the job done before a couple of Attack boosts are gained. This set attempts to fix Honchkrow's Speed problem, as, by holding a Choice Scarf, Honchkrow can outspeed the entire metagame. Honchkrow doesn't function like a typical Choice Scarf user that revenge kills Speed-boosting sweepers, because it's not fast enough to outspeed Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Kingdra, Quiver Dance Venomoth, or anything that's been passed a Shell Smash. This set functions more similarly to other Choice Scarf users with Moxie, such as Krookodile and Heracross, trying to set up a Moxie sweep by outspeeding the opponent and hitting them with a powerful STAB move. For Honchkrow, this move is none other than Brave Bird, its most powerful STAB move. It gets good neutral coverage on most of the metagame, and along with Night Slash as a secondary STAB move, is only resisted by Steel-type Pokemon.</p> <p>To hit Steel-types, look no further than Superpower. It's great for hitting threats such as Empoleon, Cobalion, and Registeel, as well as Rock-types such as Rhyperior. The Attack drop from Superpower is remedied by Moxie; as long as Honchkrow keeps killing things with it, its Attack will never drop. In the last slot, Drill Peck is the primary option to provide Honchkrow with a Flying-type STAB move without recoil, and can be used to clean effectively once Superpower has broken through all of the Rock- and Steel-types. It's as powerful as Brave Bird after only a single Attack boost, and overall is a better move to use late-game so Honchkrow doesn't kill itself with Brave Bird recoil. Pursuit is another good option in that slot, as due to its newfound Speed, Honchkrow can trap several Pokemon that it couldn't before, such as Azelf and Mismagius. However, it doesn't really add to the set's purpose. Hidden Power Grass is another option over Drill Peck, and is more of a revenge killing move, as one of the few Speed-boosting sweepers that Honchkrow can outspeed is Rock Polish Rhyperior, and Hidden Power Grass hits it hard. It serves no other purpose, however, because Swampert and other bulky Water-types take a lot of damage from Brave Bird.</p> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed enable Honchkrow to hit as hard as possible and be as fast as possible. A Jolly nature is necessary here, as with an Adamant nature, Honchkrow can only Speed tie with Pokemon with base 115 Speed such as Azelf and Raikou. On the other hand, a Jolly nature can not only allow Honchkrow to outspeed them, but also to outspeed Weavile and Crobat. Needless to say, if you're going with Hidden Power Grass, use a Naive nature instead. Sucker Punch is typically one of Honchkrow's staple moves, but isn't advised on this set because Honchkrow already outspeeds most of the metagame while holding a Choice Scarf, and being locked into Sucker Punch is a surefire way to allow threats to set up. Heat Wave can be used as a way to hit certain threats harder, such as Cobalion, Bronzong, and Escavalier. However, its uses are more related to wallbreaking as opposed to sweeping, especially when being locked into the move. Hidden Power Ice also finds use on this set, although it's really only good against Gligar; this set can't hope to break the flying scorpion without a couple of Attack boosts, and Hidden Power Ice is a surefire 2HKO.</p> <p>Once again, entry hazard support is critical to this set's success, making KOs easier due to the lack of a Life Orb boost, and reducing the recoil taken from Brave Bird. Qwilfish, Rhyperior, Roserade, and Cobalion are all prime choices to set up Stealth Rock or Spikes. Magneton is another great partner that is more helpful to this set than the previous one, as Honchkrow must be locked into Superpower in order to break through Steel-types and has to switch out again to use its other moves. Magneton can trap and kill almost every Steel-type in the tier, including Bronzong. Because this set doesn't hit as hard as the Life Orb set, Shaymin is a good partner that can switch into UU's many bulky Water-types, such as Blastoise, Milotic, and Suicune, and defeat them for Honchkrow. Stealth Rock is a top priority to get off the field, as Stealth Rock damage and Brave Bird recoil can quickly add up; Blastoise, Kabutops, and Hitmontop are your best choices. Likewise, Wish support can also remedy this issue, with Pokemon such as Umbreon and Togekiss being good choices.</p> "

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzong's outstanding base 116 Defense and Special Defense stats, combined with its unique typing in the tier which grants it eight resistances and two immunities, make it an impressive tank. Bronzong takes powerful attacks from all-out attackers such as Cinccino, Flygon, and Weavile with ease, and it heavily damages them with Gyro Ball in return. Bronzong also has a handful of support moves such as Stealth Rock, Hypnosis, and Gravity. In addition, Bronzong can even play an offensive role with Trick Room because it OHKOes Pokemon such as Nidoking and Raikou. Unfortunately, Bronzong's downfall is lack of reliable recovery, making it worn down by multiple attacks. Nonetheless, Bronzong is an astounding wall and can aid your team with proper support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bronzong has quite a few other options that it could use. For example, a Calm Mind set is quite usable, but because UU is such an offensive metagame, Bronzong gets worn down too quickly to utilize this set. An offensive Trick Room set with Earthquake, Explosion, and Gyro Ball is quite appealing, as it can OHKO many offensive threats such as Raikou and Nidoking. A Rain Dance support set can be used as it negates Bronzong's Fire-type weakness while assisting Swift Swim users to sweep. Trick with Lagging Tail or a Choice item can surprise your opponent and effectively hinder a Pokemon. As Bronzong has no reliable recovery, a RestTalk set could be used, but Bronzong usually won't get the chance to wake up due to threats such as Darmanitan and Victini pressuring it to switch out. Bronzong has access to Heavy Metal, but it should never be used because Bronzong's other abilities give it more defensive utility. Finally, Bronzong has other attacking moves such as Zen Headbutt, Rock Slide, and Payback. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Fighting-types hard, but its base power is significantly lower than Gyro Ball's in most situations. Rock Slide gives Bronzong a way to damage SubRoost Zapdos, but its low base power makes its useless in most situations. Payback can be used to deal acceptable damage to Mew, but it has no further use.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because Bronzong's main job is to set up and start walling, there are numerous Pokemon that can stop Bronzong in its tracks. Fire-types such as Victini, Darmanitan, and Rotom-H severely threaten Bronzong, as their STAB moves can OHKO Bronzong. Xatu's Magic Bounce bounces back Stealth Rock and Toxic, although Bronzong fortunately can't be poisoned. However, Xatu cannot do much to Bronzong outside of Night Shade and the rare Heat Wave. Crobat can prevent Bronzong from setting up Stealth Rock and dual screens and can heal Gyro Ball damage with Roost, but struggles to do much damage in return. Mew and Sableye can prohibit Bronzong from setting up Stealth Rock and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Furthermore, Baton Pass Mew can Taunt Bronzong and set up with Nasty Plot, Swords Dance, or Rock Polish before passing its boosts to a recipient such as Nidoking or Flygon. Swords Dance Heracross can set up in Bronzong's face, and being poisoned only increases its power. The uncommon Magnet Rise Magneton does a great job of taking out Bronzong, as long as it doesn't switch in on an Earthquake. Finally, bulky sweepers, such as Suicune, Scrafty, and Togekiss, can set up in Bronzong's face and can heal any damage dealt and any status inflicted.</p> ",

        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<p>Bronzong's main job is to set up Stealth Rock. Its wonderful defensive typing allows it many opportunities to switch into battle, such as against Snorlax, Rhyperior, Flygon, Tornadus, or Shaymin. Because of its great bulk and only having one weakness, it's so difficult to KO that it can easily put Stealth Rock on the field. Gyro Ball is a staple on Bronzong, as its low Speed stat often makes Gyro Ball's Base Power 150. It allows Bronzong to 2HKO dangerous threats such as Flygon, Heracross, and Krookodile. Toxic is great for crippling walls such as Blastoise, Hitmontop, Porygon2, and Slowbro. It also prevents bulky setup Pokemon, such as Calm Mind Slowbro, from setting up on Bronzong. Thanks to Bronzong's immunity to Toxic, it can win many stall wars while taking little damage in return. Finally, Earthquake rounds off Bronzong's moveset, as it allows Bronzong to hit Fire- and Electric-types such as Arcanine and Raikou for super effective damage.</p> <p>A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs allow Bronzong to maximize Gyro Ball's power. A physically defensive spread is preferable so that Bronzong can take as many hits as possible from physical attackers, such as Rhyperior, Flygon, and Krookodile, but a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with Sassy nature can be used to take special hits better from common Pokemon such as Raikou, Porygon-Z, Roserade, and Yanmega. Bronzong can also utilize an attacking spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with a Brave nature, and Explosion instead of Toxic on more offensive teams. This set deals significantly more damage than other sets and Explosion ensures that Pokemon such as Kingdra can't use Bronzong as setup bait, which is invaluable for offensive teams. Heatproof may seem tempting to use because Bronzong becomes neutral to Fire-type attacks, but it's generally inferior to Levitate as it allows Bronzong to be immune, rather than weak, to Ground-type moves and avoid Spikes damage. Heavy Metal should never be used because Bronzong's other abilities give it more defensive utility. Hidden Power Ice is an option to hit Gligar and other Flying-types for some heavy damage while still being able to 2HKO Flygon. Protect can be used instead of Toxic to scout Fire-types using a Choice item, and it provides Bronzong with a little extra health from Leftovers. As Bronzong lacks reliable recovery, a Wish passer such as Umbreon or Togekiss is recommended to extend its longevity. Bronzong pairs very well with bulky Water-type Pokemon, such as Slowbro, Slowking, Suicune, and Swampert. They can take Fire-type attacks aimed at Bronzong, while Bronzong can take Grass-type attacks aimed at them. Slowking, Suicune, and Swampert are also notable for their ability to phaze, as Bronzong's weak offensive presence allows Pokemon to set up on it. Swampert can also check SubRoost Zapdos, which Bronzong struggles to damage.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Dual Screen",
        "description": "<p>This set focuses on setting up dual screens so that Bronzong's teammates can set up and sweep much more easily. Light Clay is a mandatory item for Bronzong because it allows Reflect or Light Screen to stay up an extra three turns, which can be crucial in some situations. An uninvested STAB Gyro Ball coming from Bronzong still packs quite a punch, as it can do significant damage to Flygon, Virizion, and Yanmega. Earthquake is the ideal choice in the last slot, as it hits Electric-, Fire-, and Steel-types such as Cobalion, Raikou, and Victini exceptionally hard. However, Stealth Rock can also be used in that slot if Bronzong's team lacks a Pokemon that carries it, but it is hard to find the time to set up both screens and Stealth Rock, and the lack of Earthquake means that Bronzong is defenseless against Electric-, Fire-, and Steel-type Pokemon.</p> <p>A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs are used again to maximize Bronzong's Gyro Ball damage output. A physically defensive spread is the preferred spread as the Pokemon Bronzong traditionally walls, such as Krookodile, Rhyperior, and Flygon, are physical attackers; however, because this set is focused on setting up protective screens rather than walling, a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Sassy nature would be about as effective. Bronzong can also use a more offensive set of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with a Brave nature and Explosion in the last moveslot. It has the bulk to set up even without defensive investment, and it can use Explosion to give a sweeper a free switch into battle, while at the same time dealing significant damage to the opponent. Hypnosis seems appealing, but the 60% accuracy can be unreliable. You may even opt to use Toxic, as walls such as Blastoise, Mew, and Porygon2 may try to stall out your screens. Dual screen Bronzong should be paired with many powerful setup sweepers, as the screens give them the opportunity they need to start sweeping. Nasty Plot Azelf, Dragon Dance Kingdra, Nasty Plot or Swords Dance Mew, Swords Dance Weavile, Dragon Dance Scrafty, or even a Pokemon from lower tiers such as Shell Smash Omastar or Dragon Dance Feraligatr can get crucial turns needed to set up from Bronzong's dual screens.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can work against Pokemon that are immune to or don't care about Will-O-Wisp. However, Will-O-Wisp is generally the better choice, due to the crippling effect it has on physical attackers. Hypnosis can also be worth a shot to give Spiritomb's team some sleep support, but it has awful accuracy. Confuse Ray is an option to confuse a foe, but it's very situational. Spiritomb also has access to Memento to support its teammates. Spiritomb has some other attacking options at its disposal as well. Shadow Ball is a strong secondary STAB move that can be used, but Dark Pulse is generally better since no Pokemon are immune to Dark-type moves. Psychic hits Fighting-types, such as Heracross, for super effective damage, but other than that it is fairly useless. Icy Wind can provide team support by lowering the opponent's Speed stat. Ominous Wind and Silver Wind share the same effect of possibly raising all Spiritomb's stats by one stage, but each has some attributes over the other. Ominous Wind receives a STAB boost, making it more powerful than Silver Wind, but Silver Wind hits Dark-types for super effective damage. Spiritomb also has access to Nasty Plot, but Calm Mind is generally better, as it also boosts its Special Defense, which is usually better for a Pokemon with low Speed and solid defenses.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Heracross takes little damage from Shadow Sneak, resists Spiritomb's Dark-type moves, and it doesn't care about Will-O-Wisp. It hits Spiritomb really hard with Megahorn, especially after a Guts boost from Will-O-Wisp, scoring a 2HKO. It needs to be careful of Psychic though, especially if it has used Close Combat before. Escavalier shares about the same traits as Heracross; it resists both Spiritomb's Ghost- and Dark-type moves, and it hits even harder with Megahorn. Will-O-Wisp is a problem for it, though. Empoleon shares the same resistances as Escavalier and is one of the two best checks to the Calm Mind set, as it can phaze it out with Roar. It needs be careful of Hidden Power Fighting if Spiritomb has enough boosts though. Cobalion is another Steel-type that can easily dispose of Spiritomb. With its typing, it has a 4x resist against Spiritomb's Dark-type moves, and it receives an Attack boost from them thanks to Justified. Cobalion also resists Spiritomb's Ghost-type moves and has access to Taunt, making it the best counter to the Calm Mind set.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With the above moves, Spiritomb makes one of the best checks to Psychic- and Ghost-types in the tier. With its above average Attack stat and Choice Band, Spiritomb hits extremely hard. Shadow Sneak is a reliable STAB and priority move. Pursuit combined with Shadow Sneak can force any Psychic- or Ghost-type Pokemon in the tier into playing a deadly guessing game. With some good prediction, Spiritomb is able to KO a Pokemon whether or not it stays in. Pursuit also takes care of frail U-turn users such as Ambipom. Sucker Punch is mostly used to hit way harder than Shadow Sneak, but is less reliable, so it should be used carefully. Finally, Trick is used if Spiritomb is about to faint or if there is a troublesome wall that needs to be taken care of; it also renders certain walls useless.</p> <p>Though Infiltrator would work wonders with this set, it should be noted that it is illegal with Trick, and without Trick, Spiritomb loses out on a way to shut down common physical walls. Hitmontop makes an excellent partner, luring out spinblockers such as Cofagrigus or Mismagius, which Spiritomb can then trap and finish off. This will make it easier for Hitmontop to use Rapid Spin, and Pokemon such as Yanmega benefit from the removal of Stealth Rock. Defensive behemoths such as Rhyperior, Tangrowth, and Suicune are huge problems for Spiritomb. Shaymin and other hard hitting Grass-types can easily take of Rhyperior, but need to be careful of Megahorn. Fire-type Pokemon can easily finish off Tangrowth, and Moltres is an excellent choice, since it also benefits from Stealth Rock being removed. Electric-type Pokemon such as Zapdos, Raikou, or Jolteon can easily dispose of Suicune with their Electric-type attacks; they're more or less in the same boat as Grass-types in this case. Heracross is also a huge problem as it resists Spiritomb's Dark-type moves and takes little damage from Shadow Sneak. Moltres can take care of Heracross, as it resists Megahorn; however, it needs to be careful of Stone Edge. Heracross makes a great partner for Spiritomb, taking care of pesky Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon, while Spiritomb takes care of Psychic-type Pokemon.</p> "

It also works great as a spinblocker, as Spiritomb has no weaknesses. Dark Pulse is Spiritomb's main attacking option; it is a reliable move that no Pokemon are immune to. Will-O-Wisp cripples physically offensive Pokemon, making Spiritomb even stronger in said area. Pursuit lets Spiritomb check Psychic- and Ghost-types. The move in the last slot is up to one's own preference. Pain Split and Rest give Spiritomb some kind of recovery, although they are both rather unreliable. Rest gives instant recovery while also recovering status. However, Pain Split doesn't put Spiritomb to sleep, meaning it won't be a sitting duck. Unfortunately, Pain Split makes Spiritomb vulnerable to status. Shadow Sneak is an option if recovery is not needed, as, in combination with Pursuit, it helps trap Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Infiltrator can be used to bypass the rare Safeguard, and it also helps Spiritomb's Dark Pulse and Pursuit if Light Screen and Reflect is active, but Pressure is superior as it helps stall out the opponent's PP. Sleep Talk can be used in combination with Rest, making Spiritomb able to do something while sleeping. Sucker Punch can be used over Shadow Sneak to give Spiritomb a more powerful priority move, but it is unreliable against Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Mismagius and Mew. It works better against Pokemon with only attacking moves. The listed EVs give the best defensive stats. 140 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature give the same Special Defense stat as with 252 Special Defense EVs and a Bold nature, meaning that Spiritomb receives a higher Defense stat.</p> <p>Other Ghost-type Pokemon make good partners if opposing Hitmontop try to use Foresight and spin away entry hazards from their side of the field. This means that you can switch back and forth while Hitmontop is unable to use Rapid Spin. Roserade makes an excellent partner, as it has access to Aromatherapy. With Aromatherapy, Spiritomb doesn't have to worry about status if carrying Pain Split. If Spiritomb carries Rest, it doesn't have to worry about being a sitting duck while asleep. Spiritomb is no problem for bulky versions of Arcanine. Dark Pulse does little damage, while Arcanine is immune to Will-O-Wisp. Suicune or Kingdra can take care of Arcanine. Heracross is a huge problem, resisting Dark Pulse and receiving an Attack boost from Will-O-Wisp. Moltres can take care of Heracross, resisting Megahorn, but needs to be careful of Stone Edge.</p> "

Rest is used to recover the damage taken while setting up, as well as getting rid of status. With Sleep Talk, Spiritomb can continue to boost or attack while asleep. While no Pokemon is immune to Dark Pulse, there are some new additions to the UU tier that cause problems. Empoleon, with its high Special Defense and resistance to Dark Pulse, can stand in Spiritomb's way, while Cobalion receives an Attack boost every time Dark Pulse hits. This makes Hidden Power Fighting a good choice over Sleep Talk. It also hits Dark-type Pokemon that resist Dark Pulse super effectively.</p> <p>Infiltrator can be used on this set as well as it bypasses Light Screen, which can be useful. However, Pressure is generally better as Spiritomb can PP stall the last Pokemon on a team thanks to its above-average defenses. Pain Split is an option over Rest if you opt to use Hidden Power Fighting over Sleep Talk. A Bold nature with 252 Defense EVs is used to give Spiritomb maximum physical bulk, as Special Defense is not even needed thanks to Calm Mind. For this set to work to its fullest potential, phazers such as Empoleon and Suicune need to be removed. Heracross and Zapdos can take care of those two. Also, Hitmontop with Foresight might be a problem, so Psychic-types, such as Mew or Azelf, help to take care of him. Fighting- and Ground-type Pokemon, such as Heracross and Rhyperior, help if Spiritomb lacks Hidden Power Fighting, as they can take care of Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon, such as Zoroark, Cobalion, and Empoleon, that might get in the way. Toxic Spikes also helps in the long run. Roserade and Nidoqueen can set them up, and Spiritomb is immune to Psychic-type moves, which they are weak to.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Drapion is certainly an odd Pokemon. With 70 / 110 / 75 defenses, Drapion is pretty bulky, especially since it only has one weakness. With a movepool that consists of Toxic Spikes, Taunt, and Whirlwind, Drapion can be a great supporter for a team. Offensive sets are also viable, as it has good base 90 Attack and base 95 Speed stats, as well as Swords Dance to become a powerful sweeper. However, Drapion has its faults. First of all, with no reliable recovery, Drapion cannot tank the onslaughts in the UU metagame for long. In addition, with Sableye and its priority Will-O-Wisp roaming the tier, Drapion is prone to status. Nevertheless, with all the benefits Drapion can bring, it should always be considered when making a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Drapion doesn't get many other viable options aside from those already listed. Poison Jab and Cross Poison are two Poison-type STAB attacks Drapion can use; however, Poison has very poor offensive coverage, and it doesn't help beat anything that Drapion's other attacks can't. Scope Lens can be used to abuse Sniper; this also makes Night Slash a viable alternative over Crunch. However, relying on critical hits isn't exactly a reliable tactic. Acupressure can be used to raise a random stat by two stages, but Swords Dance is more reliable as it always raises Drapion's Attack. Air Balloon can be used to help remedy Drapion's lone weakness to Ground, but once it's popped, Drapion will be left without an item for the rest of the match. A Sleep Talk set can be used, especially since Drapion has no reliable way to heal itself, but Drapion isn't bulky enough to pull it off. Finally, a Choice Scarf can be used to turn Drapion into a revenge killer, but base 90 Attack generally isn't powerful enough.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Drapion has quite a few checks and counters it must usually run from. Ground-type Pokemon--especially Krookodile, who resists Drapion's Dark-type STAB--can easily OHKO Drapion with their STAB Ground-type attacks. However, Ground-type Pokemon should take caution when switching into offensive Drapion, as the right coverage move can deal a lot of damage to them. Steelix takes little damage even from Earthquake, and can either phaze Drapion out with Dragon Tail or Roar or directly attack it with Earthquake. Rhyperior fears Aqua Tail, but can OHKO Drapion with Earthquake. Sableye can use Taunt to break down the defensive set or Will-O-Wisp to shut down offensive ones. Weezing and Spiritomb both take little damage from Drapion's attacks and can use Will-O-Wisp to burn Drapion; however, they must be wary of Taunt. Hitmontop can use Rapid Spin to clear any hazards Drapion sets up, and has Intimidate to lower Drapion's Attack. Finally, Bronzong takes little damage from any attack, and can attack Drapion with either Earthquake or STAB Gyro Ball.</p> ",

Drapion can easily set up a layer of Toxic Spikes before switching out, which can break apart offensive teams or wear down stall teams. With Taunt, Drapion can stop opponents, especially Bronzong and Golurk, from setting up hazards. Whirlwind helps phaze opponents or spread poison after Toxic Spikes are laid. Finally, Crunch prevents Drapion from becoming Taunt bait in addition to hitting Roserade hard, should it come in to absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>With a Careful nature and maximum Special Defense, Drapion becomes a special tank, able to take many attacks that are not super effective. Alternatively, an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Imprish nature can be used to maximize Drapion's Defense instead. Another choice is to run an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature; this can be used so Drapion outspeeds faster threats, such as Spikes Roserade, allowing it to Taunt Roserade before more hazards are set up. This also makes Drapion a fast Toxic Spikes user, which is very useful in setting up hazards before being Taunted, or using Taunt on defensive Pokemon becfore they can set up. It also has the benefit of going first with Whirlwind, ifit faces another phazer. Knock Off can be useful to get rid of items as opposing Pokemon switch into Drapion. Rest is also nice to use if your team includes a cleric, such as Miltank or Shaymin. However, as this can be very risky, Wish support is another way to keep Drapion's health up. Earthquake can also be viable on this set, though it won't do much outside of hitting Fire-types, such as Arcanine, harder.</p> <p>Togekiss makes a great partner, as it can switch into Ground-type attacks with impunity and obliterate Steel-types with Fire Blast. Hitmontop is a problem for this set, as it has Intimidate, as well as Rapid Spin to remove hazards, so having a Mew to beat Hitmontop is useful. Furthermore, a spinblocker such as Dusclops or Mismagius works well with Drapion, as it allows Drapion to keep the hazards it sets up. Also, both Dusclops and Mismagius can use Will-O-Wisp to weaken the opponent's Pokemon,allowing Drapion to take even more hits.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With decent offensive stats, Drapion can pull off an attacking set to great effect. Pursuit is the main reason for an offensive Drapion, as it can nail Pokemon such as Mew for good damage as they switch out. Earthquake hits Steel-type Pokemon, such as Bisharp and Empoleon super effectively, while Aqua Tail hits Ground-type and Fire-type Pokemon, such as Rotom-H and Nidoking. Finally, the last slot depends on what the team needs Drapion to accomplish. Crunch gives Drapion a solid STAB attack, which means it doesn't have to rely on Pursuit for STAB; however, Drapion can get at least one layer of Toxic Spikes before being forced to switch out, which is useful for breaking teams down--it also facilitates its teammates' sweeps. It can also be used to fake a defensive set, which might result in a surprise KO.</p> <p>Sniper is the preferred ability for offensive Drapion, as the increased critical hit ratio is useful when trying to sweep a team. Also, to ensure that a Drapion sweep is easier to accomplish, Attack and Speed are maximized to deal as much damage as possible. The choice of item should depend on the team. Choice Band is useful as it provides a greater power boost than Life Orb does, making it a great stallbreaker. However, Life Orb allows Drapion to switch moves, which works well on more offensive teams that try to hit the opponent as fast as possible. Taunt can be used on the Life Orb set to prevent opponents from inflicting status on Drapion, making a sweep easier.</p> <p>Both Drapion variants need support. Entry hazards help soften up the opposing team, making it easier for Drapion to nab KOs. Pokemon with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy, such as Clefable and Lanturn, are a must for Drapion as well, as they can cure Drapion of status inflicted by Pokemon such as Prankster Sableye. Hitmontop can be problematic too, as it has Intimidate to cut Drapion's Attack, as well as Rapid Spin to remove hazards. As such, a Mew to beat Hitmontop is useful. Milotic and Tangrowth are problems for this set.; therefore, Shaymin and Roserade are great partners, as they can check Milotic, and Roserade has STAB Sludge Bomb to beat Tangrowth. Pokemon such as Suicune and Azumarill, who check Ground-type Pokemon are also helpful. Fire-type Pokemon such as Rotom-H also work well with Drapion, as they destroy Steel-type Pokemon that give Drapion trouble.</p> "

After a Swords Dance, Drapion hits 558 Attack, which is enough power to pull off a sweep. Crunch is a reliable STAB attack that has great coverage in the UU metagame, hitting the many Psychic-type and Ghost-type Pokemon in the tier super effectively. Earthquake has great coverage along with Crunch, as it eliminates the Steel-type Pokemon that resist Crunch, such as Bisharp. The last moveslot is up to what Drapion needs to accomplish. Aqua Tail hits Ground-type Pokemon such as Krookodile and Rhyperior hard, which is crucial as both of these Pokemon can OHKO Drapion. However, Taunt can stop opposing Pokemon, such as Bronzong, from setting up on Drapion while avoiding status, which makes its sweep easier.</p> <p>Like the physical attacker set, Sniper is the preferred ability for Swords Dance Drapion, as the increased critical hit ratio is useful when trying to sweep a team. Again, Attack and Speed are maximized so Drapion can deal as much damage as possible. After a Swords Dance, Life Orb increases Drapion's damage output, which is useful when Drapion attempts a sweep.</p> <p>Drapion becomes a great sweeper after a Swords Dance; however, it still needs support to make a sweep easier. A way to get rid of opposing Ground-type Pokemon, such as Flygon and Choice Scarf Krookodile, greatly benefits Drapion. As such, Suicune, Azumarill, Shaymin, and Roserade, all make good teammates. Roserade, in particular, can set up Spikes to soften up the opponent's team. Speaking of entry hazards, Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock also make great partners for Swords Dance Drapion. Bronzong is a great example, as it is immune to Ground-type attacks, and can set up Stealth Rock with relative ease. Fire-type Pokemon, such as Rotom-H, work well with Drapion too, as their STAB moves incinerate Steel-type Pokemon that give Drapion trouble. Again, clerics such as Clefable or Lanturn are necessary, as they can heal Drapion of status. Alternatively, a Pokemon with Guts, such as Heracross, or a RestTalk user, such as Dusclops, can come in and absorb status thrown in Drapion's direction; Heracross gets a special mention, as it can use the Guts boost to heavily damage the opponent, especially since Prankster Sabelye is very annoying to Drapion. Hitmontop also a problem, so having a Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mew to check it is also a great teammate to have.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Weavile is the textbook definition of a late-game Pokemon, as it is capable of sweeping large portions of the UU metagame, which is mostly due to its blistering 125 base Speed. This allows Weavile to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame—only Meloetta-P and Crobat are faster. Weavile's base 120 Attack lets it tear opposing teams in two thanks to its STAB moves, Ice Punch and Night Slash. However, its super-thin 70 / 65 / 85 Defenses still hold it back. Also, Weavile's typing leaves it with a crippling Stealth Rock weakness, which prevents it from switching in and out of a match effectively, and a weakness to the most common type in UU, Fighting-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Pickpocket can be used to possibly nab viable one-time use items, such as a Focus Sash, Dark Gem, or Lum Berry from the opponent if physical contact is made. It is recommended that the bulkier EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe is used if you opt for Pickpocket, as the extra bulk can help Weavile last longer. A set consisting of a Focus Sash, Swords Dance, and Beat Up can be used; however, it's a fairly predictable set and Weavile is usually treated as if it is already carrying a Focus Sash. Agility can be used in tandem with an Adamant nature on the Swords Dance set over Swords Dance and a Jolly nature, making Weavile the fastest thing to step foot in the tier, but it will miss out on many OHKOs that Weavile can net once it sets up with Swords Dance and it requires more support than the original Swords Dance set. Brick Break can be used to guarantee set damage against all Normal-, Rock-, Steel-, and Ice-types, allowing Weavile to do more damage against lighter foes such as Ambipom and Durant. However, Low Kick still does more damage against heavier foes, specifically Snorlax and Rhyperior, and Weavile's STAB attacks are usually enough to typically hit Pokemon harder than Brick Break.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-type Pokemon, most notably Suicune and Swampert, sponge Weavile's attacks with extreme ease and can threaten it with Scald or Roar. Beefy Steel-types, such as Bronzong and Escavalier, can all take Low Kick relatively well and threaten Weavile with their STAB move of preference. However, despite resisting both of Weavile's STABs, Registeel cannot afford to switch in on either a Low Kick or a Swords Dance. Outspeeding Weavile with a Choice Scarf user, such as Mienshao, Victini, Rotom-H, Heracross, or Darmanitan, is a solid way of checking Weavile, as they immediately threaten it with their powerful STAB attacks. However, both Mienshao and Heracross take severe damage from a +2 Ice Shard, with the former being OHKOed and the latter taking about 67%. In a pinch, Intimidate users, such as Arcanine, Hitmontop, and Qwilfish, may be used to check Weavile, reducing its Attack stat. Qwilfish also has the added benefit of carrying Thunder Wave, potentially crippling Weavile for the remainder of the match. However, both Qwilfish and Arcanine must be wary of a +1 Night Slash. Hitmontop, on the other hand, carries a super effective STAB and won't be bothered much by +1 Ice Shard, as many Weavile do not carry Ice Punch. Azumarill and Sharpedo are also stable checks to Weavile, as Azumarill OHKOes with Aqua Jet and Sharpedo outspeeds Weavile after a single Speed Boost. However, Sharpedo can only switch in on variants without a Swords Dance boost, as Ice Shard may be able to knock Sharpedo out once at +4.</p> ",

With maximum Speed investment, Weavile is capable of outspeeding all unboosted Pokemon bar Crobat, making it one of the fastest Pokemon available to the tier. Swords Dance brings Weavile's already potent Attack stat to monstrous levels, allowing it to 2HKO and even OHKO many top defensive threats, such as Cofagrigus, Gligar, and Rhyperior. Ice Shard holds a lot of utility in the second slot, as it allows Weavile to check and OHKO Choice Scarf Flygon, which would otherwise outspeed and significantly threaten Weavile, while also allowing it to pick off weakened opponents. After a Swords Dance, Ice Shard OHKOes and 2HKOes many other opposing threats, even those using Choice Scarf. Night Slash acts as Weavile's Dark-type STAB move of choice, allowing it to tear opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types apart. Night Slash also has solid neutral coverage in UU, so it's useful for powering through the opposition mid-sweep. Low Kick occupies the fourth slot to flatten opposing Steel- and Rock-types with the former resisting Weavile's dual STAB, as their cumbersome weight means they'll be taking a lot of damage after a Swords Dance, potentially opening up the opposition for a game-clinching sweep. Low Kick is also effective at removing Snorlax, which stomachs Weavile's STAB attacks with relative ease due to its supreme bulk.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is a must in order to outspeed positively-natured base 115s, such as Raikou and Azelf. A bulkier EV spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe can be used to give Weavile the chance to set up on stray Ice Beams or Shadow Balls, but now Weavile can only tie with opposing Crobat. If Life Orb recoil isn't your cup of tea, an Expert Belt can be used instead. However, there will be a noticeable drop of damage done to neutrally-hit opponents. Ice Punch can be used over Ice Shard in favor of more damage output, as it is Weavile's strongest physical Ice-type STAB attack, but prevents Weavile from beating the multiple Choice Scarf users that would otherwise outspeed and beat Weavile. Pokemon capable of keeping the field free of entry hazards, specifically Stealth Rock, make for excellent partners, as Weavile cannot afford to continuously switch in on them. Xatu, Blastoise, and Hitmontop all make for great choices, with the latter of the two also resisting Fire- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Weavile. Victini can be used to lure in Pursuit users wielding a Choice Band, such as Snorlax, and give Weavile a free turn to set up Swords Dance. The removal of bulky Water-types also makes Weavile's life easier, making Zapdos and Shaymin useful teammates, as their powerful STAB attacks will make quick work of any opposing Water-type. Powerful attackers that can freely switch in on or lure bulky Water-types, specifically Choice Specs Kingdra, Arcanine, and Choice Band Heracross, are also capable of heavily damaging them, giving Weavile room to pull off a sweep.</p> "

Pursuit allows Weavile to put opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Mismagius and Azelf into a checkmate situation, preventing them from switching and doing heavy amounts of damage and 2HKOing both without Stealth Rock damage or the bonus damage from switching. Ice Shard is Weavile's main STAB, allowing it to bust faster opposing threats, such as Choice Scarf Flygon or Choice Scarf Zapdos, wide open. Low Kick is handy for breaking through opposing Rock-, Ice-, and Steel-type opponents that would otherwise resist Pursuit or Ice Shard, potentially opening holes throughout the opposition's defenses. The last slot is more preference-based, as both Ice Punch and Night Slash are acceptable options. Ice Punch deals more damage to slower Flying-, Grass-, and Ground-types than Ice Shard does, but Night Slash is capable of inflicting more damage against opposing Fire-types. Night Slash also guarantees the OHKO on many of the Ghost- and Psychic-types that Pursuit is designed to trap, but when the opponent decides not to switch.</p> <p>A bulkier spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe can be used in order to take weaker ineffective attacks better while still maintaining the jump on positively-natured base 115s. The choice in item is a personal preference, with Choice Band allowing Weavile to deal more damage and embrace a revenge killer role while Life Orb gives Weavile free reign over its moves at the cost of HP. Do note that if you choose Choice Band, Rapid Spin or Magic Bounce support is mandatory. Teammates capable of keeping entry hazards away from Weavile, such as Blastoise, Hitmontop, and Xatu, all make for great partners. Depending on your choice of move in the fourth slot, Weavile will require some custom support. If you opted for Ice Punch, teammates capable of removing bulky Water- and Fire-type Pokemon are greatly appreciated. Kingdra, Zapdos, and Rhyperior are all capable of removing at least one of those two types from battle. If Night Slash was chosen, partners capable of removing Fighting-types will be desired. Cofagrigus, Slowbro, and Togekiss are all good candidates for removing Fighting-types and can help ease Weavile's need to come in and defeat the opposition.</p> "

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhyperior is, to say the least, a peculiar Pokemon. While its HP, Defense, and Attack stats are out of this world, its Special Defense and Speed leave much to be desired. When you see a Pokemon with base 140 Attack, you already know it's going to hit extremely hard and Rhyperior is no exception. Having both Rock and Ground typing means STAB on the EdgeQuake combination, which is a huge plus for Rhyperior's arsenal. It also packs a wide movepool: it has access to boosting moves, such as Swords Dance and Rock Polish, support moves, such as Stealth Rock and Toxic, and a plethora of offensive moves of different types. However, although the offensive coverage provided by Rhyperior's typing is amazing, the same can't be said about its resistances. Being a Rock / Ground type means Rhyperior has a huge weakness to Water- and Grass-types and is hit for super effective damage by the common Ground- and Fighting-type moves in the tier. However, don't let this fool you, as Rhyperior can partially mitigate these issues with its extremely useful ability in the form of Solid Rock, which reduces the power of super effective moves by 25%. If you know Rhyperior's weaknesses and play around them, you will find it extremely easy to incorporate the Drill Pokemon in any team with positive results.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rhyperior doesn't have too many other options that are worth using. An exception goes to Fire Punch, which hits Bronzong harder than any other move while also hitting Grass-types as hard as Ice Punch. Protect can also be used to scout your opponent's moveset, especially if they are holding a Choice item, force Mienshao to hit itself with High Jump Kick, and gain what could be a crucial turn of Leftovers recovery. Rhyperior can perform very well under the effects of Trick Room and Tailwind, removing its Speed problems for a few turns. A set of Substitute + Swords Dance can be used, but Rhyperior's low Speed is fatal. Due to its sheer power and bulk, Rhyperior is an extremely viable Baton Pass receiver, taking entire teams apart with the proper support.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gligar can take every single hit from Rhyperior aside from a Choice Band-boosted Ice Punch and can recover its HP with Roost and hit back with Earthquake or poison Rhyperior, crippling it for the rest of the match. Slowbro is in the same boat as Gligar, only fearing Megahorn. It also has Water-type attacks at its disposal that take out Rhyperior with ease, has access to instant recovery in the form of Slack Off, and can always switch out to regain even more HP due to Regenerator. Bronzong takes close to no damage from Rhyperior's STAB moves, and Megahorn doesn't dish out as much damage as desired. Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, Blastoise, and Milotic can take a hit, outspeed, and retaliate with Scald or Surf. Bulky Grass-types, such as Shaymin and Tangrowth, resist Earthquake and destroy Rhyperior with a STAB move, but Megahorn will seriously damage them. Porygon2 can trace the Solid Rock ability or get a Special Attack boost from Download, take a hit due to its bulk backed up by Eviolite, and threaten Rhyperior with Ice Beam or Toxic. Faster and potent special attackers, such as Nidoking, Roserade, Kingdra, Nidoqueen, and Lilligant, can take out Rhyperior as easily as taking a walk in the park due to Rhyperior's low Special Defense stat. Choice Scarf users, such as Flygon, Heracross, Shaymin, and Krookodile, can pose a threat to Rock Polish Rhyperior, cutting its sweep short. Rhyperior has great vulnerability to Rapid Spin users, such as Hitmontop and Blastoise, which can very easily Rapid Spin the Stealth Rock away from the opponent's side.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>If you look at Rhyperior's stat distribution, you'll have a huge let down when you take a look at its Special Defense stat. However, with some EV investment, Rhyperior can surprise you in that aspect. Its typing and HP stat, when combined with some Special Defense EVs, make Rhyperior one of the best Raikou and Zapdos checks in the tier, unless they carry Hidden Power Grass. The same goes for Togekiss, Honchkrow, and Victini, although the latter to a lesser extent due to the possibly of it having Grass Knot. Base 130 Defense backed up by base 115 HP means Rhyperior will be able to take physical hits without being heavily invested, giving it the capacity to take on physical threats such as Darmanitan and Honchkrow. Stealth Rock is a good asset for any team, and Rhyperior makes good use of it. Earthquake is standard on Rhyperior's moveset, being both its strongest and most reliable Ground-type move and hitting like a truck. Rock Blast has the amazing ability to attack through Substitutes, an invaluable aspect to beat Honchkrow, whereas Stone Edge is often more powerful due to its higher fixed Base Power. Dragon Tail hits Flygon switching in on a predicted Earthquake, helps shuffle the opponent's team, racks up nice damage in conjunction with Stealth Rock, and might be a handy last resort against a setup sweeper.</p> <p>The EV distribution lets Rhyperior take special hits as well as possible while also hitting a Leftovers number. An Adamant nature with 16 EVs provides Rhyperior a little bit more power and leaves a good amount of EVs left to invest in its bulk. An alternative spread of 208 HP / 252 Atk / 48 SpD can be used for a more offensive approach. It should be noted that Rhyperior needs 52 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature to OHKO Empoleon. Roar can be used over Dragon Tail in the last slot if you prefer Rhyperior having the ability to force out the opponent when it has a Substitute up to it being able to hit the opponent when under the effects of Taunt. Megahorn is a good alternative over Rhyperior's Rock-type STAB move to hit Grass-types harder. Ice Punch is a direct answer to Gligar which walls Rhyperior's entire set otherwise, while also nailing Flygon and Virizion on the switch. Toxic is a good surprise weapon to cripple some opponents such as Slowbro and Porygon2, but it's not as effective as it once was due to the fact that one of its main targets, Gligar, now almost always carries Immunity. Bulky Water- and Grass-types, such as Slowbro, Blastoise, Milotic, Suicune, Azumarill, and Shaymin can all threaten Rhyperior with their STAB move once they get onto the battlefield. Porygon2 can trace Rhyperior's Solid Rock ability and threaten it with a super effective Ice Beam or poison it with Toxic, severely crippling it for the rest of the battle. Cofagrigus, being a defensive powerhouse, can take any of Rhyperior's hits, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and use Rhyperior's absurdly high HP stat against it by recovering a huge portion, if not all, of its health by using Pain Split. Hitmontop resists Rhyperior's Rock-type STAB and can take any of its other hits due to Intimidate, retaliating with Close Combat or poisoning Rhyperior with Toxic. Bronzong can take any of Rhyperior's moves as if they were nothing and strike back with a super effective Gyro Ball, hit hard with a super effective Earthquake, or poison Rhyperior with Toxic. As for teammates, Rhyperior benefits from the use of Roserade, since it can take Water- and Grass-type moves with ease and set up Spikes on the opponent's side of the field, making Rhyperior's shuffling moves increase in effectiveness. Zapdos and Rotom-H resist Grass-type moves and can take Grass-types and Bronzong out with Heat Wave and Overheat respectively, while destroying Water-types with their Electric-type STAB moves. Crobat enjoys having Grass-types around and can Taunt Cofagrigus, thus shutting it down completely, while completely walling Hitmontop. Raikou dents Water-types with its STAB and can potentially earn a free switch for Rhyperior with Volt Switch. Houndoom can function as a backup plan against Cofagrigus, while also dealing with Grass-types easily. Having a spinblocker around is also helpful to keep entry hazards on the field seeing as Rhyperior struggles against both Hitmontop and Blastoise, the best spinners in the tier. Cofagrigus and Sableye are good options.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>We all know Rhyperior has a sky-high Attack stat, so why not make use of it? That's right, Choice Band Rhyperior! 624 Attack right off the bat is nothing to mess around with, especially when it's Rhyperior we're talking about. The STAB EdgeQuake combo provides amazing coverage, hitting every Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage except for Bronzong, Flygon, Virizion, and Claydol. Stone Edge is the Rock-type STAB move of choice, hitting the Flying-types, such as Zapdos, Togekiss, and Xatu, and Levitate Pokemon, such as Rotom-H and Azelf, that are immune to Ground-type moves hard. Earthquake is directed at Fire-types, such as Arcanine, Victini, and Darmanitan, Electric-types, such as Raikou, and Steel-types, such as Registeel, Bisharp, and Cobalion. However, due to the amount of Flying-types and levitating Pokemon in the tier, being locked into Earthquake can have huge drawbacks, giving the opponent a free switch in for any of these Pokemon. Megahorn decimates Grass-types, such as Shaymin and Tangrowth, and Psychic-types, such as Slowbro, Mew, and Meloetta. Ice Punch is there for Flygon, Virizion, and Gligar, although its accuracy helps out against Grass-types when Megahorn's power is unnecessary. Rock Blast can be used to be more effective against Substitute users, mainly Honchkrow and Zapdos. It is important to note that most of Rhyperior's moves have imperfect accuracy, meaning one miss can turn the table around, leaving the opponent with a lot more HP than it should have as well as possibly leaving Rhyperior with way less HP, potentially cutting Rhyperior's time on the field short.</p> <p>The listed EV spread ensures that Rhyperior outpaces Swampert, Clefable, uninvested Empoleon, and Bulk Up Scrafty while also having a good amount of bulk. An alternative spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Def / 124 Spe can be used to guarantee Rhyperior doesn't go down to four Seismic Tosses or Night Shades and give Rhyperior more leeway to take on physical attackers, such as Darmanitan, Honchkrow, and Choice Scarf Flygon when it's not locked into Earthquake. Another EV spread of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 SpD gives Rhyperior a bit more survivability against special hits, even surviving a Hidden Power Grass from both Zapdos and Raikou and OHKOing them back with Stone Edge and Earthquake respectively. Aqua Tail and Avalanche are possible options, but Ice Punch is more reliable overall. Due to Rhyperior's sheer power, there's not a Pokemon in UU that is safe from being knocked out by Rhyperior once it has been a bit weakened. Slowbro, Bronzong, Gligar, Qwilfish, Flygon, Hitmontop, and Nidoqueen can switch into Rhyperior with caution (when predicted correctly) and force it out afterwards. Shaymin deals with all the aforementioned Pokemon with the exception of Bronzong, though Flygon poses a threat with both U-turn and Outrage. Zapdos deals with Rhyperior's common switch-ins and makes the opponent think twice about using Earthquake with Flygon, giving Rhyperior the upper hand in the prediction game in this scenario. Free switches are extremely appreciated, since Rhyperior will be needing as much HP as possible to do its job. For this reason, Flygon, Azelf, Zapdos, and Raikou can make good use of U-turn or Volt Switch to get Rhyperior in safely. Pokemon that lure resisted physical hits, such as Roserade, Shaymin, and Togekiss, are also good options. They also resist some of Rhyperior's weaknesses, especially Grass-type moves.</p> "

        "name": "Rock Polish",
        "description": "<p>Rhyperior is not known as a fast paced Pokemon. However, it has a way to remedy this: Rock Polish. At +2 Speed, Rhyperior reaches a Speed stat of 392, only being outpaced by Crobat fully invested in Speed, making it an extremely efficient late-game sweeper. Earthquake is Rhyperior's best move to spam and hits incredibly hard. Stone Edge gives Rhyperior the powerful EdgeQuake combo, giving the Drill Pokemon good offensive coverage. Megahorn hits Grass-types very hard, especially Shaymin, as well as hitting Slowbro for super effective damage and hitting Flygon on the spot. Even after Rhyperior doubles its Speed stat, it is still outsped by base 70 Speed Pokemon with a Speed boosting nature holding a Choice Scarf. Unfortunately, most Choice Scarf users stand above that mark. For this reason, all Choice Scarf users must be removed from the battlefield in order to give Rhyperior the spotlight it deserves.</p> <p>The EV spread makes sure Rhyperior outpaces Modest Choice Scarf Togekiss after a Rock Polish boost. Life Orb is invaluable on this set to guarantee some KOs. Leftovers could be used to add survivability or Lum Berry to prevent Rhyperior from getting statused, but the power drop is very noticeable. Aqua Tail can be used to over Megahorn to beat Gligar and opposing Rhyperior. Ice Punch deals with Gligar and Virizion better than any of the other moves listed above. Substitute is a nifty choice, easing prediction and letting Rhyperior have a pseudo-immunity to status conditions. An Adamant nature can be used over Jolly nature to increase Rhyperior's power, but it then loses the ability to outspeed key Pokemon. Choice Scarf users, such as Krookodile, Flygon, Heracross, Shaymin, and Nidoking can block Rhyperior's sweep with ease by taking it out with a super effective move. Suicune, Tangrowth, Porygon2, Gligar, and Slowbro can take a hit and retaliate with a super effective move to knock out Rhyperior. Roserade, Shaymin, and Zapdos can prove to be helpful to eliminate the aforementioned threats with the exception of Porygon2. Heracross fixes this problem while also being able to dent Slowbro, Tangrowth, Shaymin, and Krookodile. Weavile is a good offensive partner to have around due to the fact that it beats Rhyperior's bulky checks with its STAB moves with the exception of Suicune, while revenge killing the Choice Scarf users with Ice Shard. Entry hazards support is mandatory to help out Rhyperior in getting additional KOs. Roserade and Bronzong are good options.</p> "

  "Tangrowth": {
    "overview": "<p>As a physically defensive Pokemon, Tangrowth faces stiff competition from a variety of Pokemon in UU, including Slowbro and Shaymin. At the same time, it is fairly unique in what it does; with good offensive stats, impressive physical bulk surpassed only by some Rock- and Steel-types and Cresselia, and the great support moves that Grass-types tend to have, Tangrowth is blessed with enough versatility to function as a hard-hitting wall or a bulky sweeper. Defensively, its typing is a double-edged sword, having five weaknesses, but also key resistances to Water and Ground. In addition to this, Tangrowth has plenty of ways to recover HP, including Regenerator, Leech Seed, Giga Drain, and Synthesis, allowing it to continue to frustrate physical attackers throughout the fight. However, these advantages are counterbalanced rather cruelly by its cripplingly low Special Defense and Speed stats, and the fact that Regenerator Tangrowth cannot learn Synthesis. Like a good rope, Tangrowth may not ward off fires very well, but one can depend on it to hold in the face of physical brutality, and to dish some back out.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For all of Tangrowth's versatility, its stiff competition leaves it few alternatives without being outclassed by a different Pokemon. A specially defensive EV spread has its uses but takes away from the prime reason to use Tangrowth: its physical walling ability. Even with Regenerator, its packed moveset makes it difficult to justify niche support options, such as Block. Tangrowth can also try a SubSeed set with 100+ HP Substitutes, but Jumpluff and Whimsicott offer the Speed (and Prankster on the latter) that is generally more desired in a SubSeeder. Reflect would be an excellent move, but lack of Light Screen kills its viability. Poison Jab and Sludge Bomb are powerful against Grass-types, but they provide otherwise mediocre coverage. Leaf Guard could be good on a staller in a sun team, but lack of permanent sun kills its viability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Shaymin is one of the best counters to Tangrowth because it resists most of Tangrowth's moves, can remove any status by switching out, and has enough bulk to take several hits from Hidden Power Ice. Plus, it establishes the threat of Seed Flare on whatever switches in. Swellow is another great counter because Flame Orb or Toxic Orb protects it from paralysis and sleep, and it can drill through Tangrowth's physical defense with a powerful Brave Bird. Heracross works similarly, threatening a powerful Megahorn. Sigilyph uses Tangrowth as a setup opportunity while using Magic Guard to ignore Leech Seed, using a Flame Orb to make itself immune to Sleep Powder, and possibly using Psycho Shift to burn Tangrowth. While Fire-types are decent checks in general, Rotom-H deserves a special mention, not only because of its immunity to Earthquake, but also thanks to its lack of the painful 4x weakness to Rock-type attacks that Moltres and Charizard have due to their additional Flying typing. Defensive Arcanine is another good counter because Intimidate cuts Tangrowth's Attack, making it difficult to beat even with Earthquake. Poison-types are also worth a mention; Crobat and Nidoking can be especially dangerous if they manage to avoid Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p>Tangrowth's counters largely depend on its choice of coverage move. Flygon, Crobat, and Roserade can take advantage of a lack of Hidden Power Ice, while Fire-types such as Victini switch in freely if Tangrowth is not running Earthquake.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Tangrowth's mammoth physical bulk is well-suited to a physically defensive set. It can take two of just about any neutral physical attack in UU, and even some super effective ones, and live to fight back. Choice Band Azumarill fails to 2HKO with Ice Punch, Rhyperior fails to 2HKO with Megahorn, and even Medicham requires a Life Orb or Choice Band to guarantee a 2HKO with High Jump Kick. To make matters worse for unwary physical attackers, Tangrowth has an easy time recovering HP through Leech Seed or Giga Drain, and can even switch out to heal one third of its HP. Between Regenerator, HP-draining moves, and excellent physical walling prowess, Tangrowth can serve as a very long-lasting tank.</p> <p>Tangrowth also has a formidable arsenal of moves of all three flavors. Its physical weapons include Power Whip and Earthquake to hit Steel- and Fire-types, such as Registeel, Empoleon, Bisharp, and Houndoom. On the special side, it has Giga Drain and Hidden Power Ice for assaulting Grass- and Dragon-types, such as Shaymin and Flygon. It also receives a wide array of status moves, including Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, Knock Off, and Leech Seed. This versatility gives Tangrowth a major advantage over other physical walls, making Tangrowth somewhat unpredictable. Regenerator also lets Tangrowth excel against Choice Band and Choice Scarf attackers because, if necessary, it can switch to a better counter to the opponent's move without worrying too much about healing.</p> <p>The move choices have a large impact on how Tangrowth plays. Giga Drain's main lure is the HP recovery and the ability to beat Slowbro, but Power Whip 2HKOes Milotic, Slowking, and offensive Suicune. The STAB move choice also has an effect on the corresponding coverage move and the nature. Use an Impish or Bold nature if Tangrowth's moves are entirely physical or special, and use a Relaxed nature if its moveset is mixed. As for support moves, Sleep Powder and Leech Seed tend to be the best options. Nonetheless, Stun Spore is decent if paralysis support is needed, Synthesis can make Tangrowth play more like a wall, and Knock Off can remove Eviolite from troublesome NFE Pokemon, such as Dusclops.</p> <p>Tangrowth's main issues are opposing Grass-types, such as Shaymin, and slow, bulky Pokemon that take advantage of moves that it doesn't run. Heracross and Rotom-H tend to do very well against Grass-types; the former scares off most Grass-types with its powerful STAB Megahorn, and benefits from status moves with Guts, while the latter resists most of the common coverage moves that Grass-types utilize, and terrorizes Sigilyph as well. Both can also switch into attempts to burn Tangrowth. Tangrowth also benefits significantly from Stealth Rock support, since many of its offensive predators, such as Victini and Swellow, are weak against it. One should also look into Water-, Steel-, and Rock-type teammates for their defensive typing synergy with Tangrowth. Rhyperior, Aggron, and Cobalion can serve as wallbreakers, while Omastar and Empoleon can set up entry hazards. Water-types are especially useful to counter some of the more persistent Fire-types, such as defensive Arcanine.</p> "

        "name": "Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>Tangrowth's offensive side can be likened to a desert slave driver, setting up on physical attackers and proceeding to punish their insolence with a boosted Power Whip. Any resistance through fire or iron is swiftly squelched with Earthquake, leaving only Flying-types, Rotom-H, and opposing Grass-types as holes in this two-move offensive combination. Unfortunately, this leaves Tangrowth with only one moveslot, and must choose between Rock Slide to deal with the former two, and Hidden Power Fire for the latter. Tangrowth's naturally low Speed necessitates the desert sun to beat down on the land for optimal sweeping ability. As such, the most prominent foe will typically be the eight-turn time limit, though the occasional appearance of Snover among the opposition will cause issues as well.</p> <p>Tangrowth is highly favored among UU sun sweepers due to having great offensive stats and a high Defense stat to help it to set up. Most other sun sweepers, such as Shiftry and Victreebel, are rather frail, so they have a hard time finding a good opportunity to set up. Nonetheless, like the others, Tangrowth suffers from moveslot and typing issues that tend to plague Grass-types. Thus, Tangrowth, and the sun team in general, should be played intelligently and precisely to ensure success.</p> <p>Move alternatives are few. Since Tangrowth really needs all of its moveslots for attacking and setting up, a status move is not a very good idea, and neither is Sunny Day. A special moveset is a plausible alternative, but the lack of an alternative to Growth and lack of good special coverage moves should be considered carefully. If OHKOing Gligar is a pressing concern, then Hidden Power Ice can be used. The choice between Swords Dance and Growth is a matter of reliability versus the potential to have a +2 Hidden Power Fire; Snover should be taken very seriously when making this choice.</p> <p>Sunny Day support should generally come from multiple support Pokemon. There are many options for Sunny Day support, whether they be fast supporters that grab control of the match, such as Crobat and Azelf, or defensive supporters that can take enough hits for repeated Sunny Day replenishment, such as Registeel and Arcanine. Paralysis support from the likes of Registeel and Cresselia can be helpful, too, since the sun may run out. Registeel can also provide Stealth Rock support, which is very important for landing KOs. Consequently, a Ghost-type, such as Mismagius and Golurk, can be useful to block Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Rhyperior is a good teammate if Tangrowth is running Hidden Power Fire, since it will give most Flying-types problems, and it can also use Stealth Rock or even Sunny Day. If Rock Slide is being used, Fire-types, such as Arcanine, Rotom-H, and Houndoom, can cover Tangrowth against Grass-types, while benefiting from the sun themselves. Rotom-H in particular resists most typical coverage moves from the likes of Shaymin. Water-types, such as Suicune and Milotic, are beneficial teammates despite having weakened STAB moves in the sun, as they can check defensive Arcanine.</p> <p>Trick Room is a quirky alternative to Sunny Day that is plausible for Tangrowth to exploit thanks to its low Speed. However, it does not power up Growth or Hidden Power Fire, and there is no way to extend Trick Room's duration to eight turns, so Sunny Day is generally preferred. Obviously, do not use Chlorophyll if this is your intent.</p> "

  "Yanmega": {
    "overview": "<p>Although the transition to BW2 hasn't brought anything new for Yanmega, the truth is that it is still considered one of the best revenge killers in the tier and a very potent special sweeper. This fact is supported by its two abilities: Tinted Lens eliminates the opponent's resistances to Yanmega's moves, making its attacks even more powerful than they already were and lowering the effectiveness of its primary checks, whereas Speed Boost increases Yanmega's Speed to sky-high levels, causing Yanmega to outspeed every Pokemon in the tier after two boosts. Moreover, Yanmega's Bug- and Flying-type STAB moves are only resisted by Zapdos, Empoleon, Rotom-H, and Registeel, and its typing lets it get relatively safe switch-ins on a lot of attacks, mainly Grass-, Ground-, Bug- , and Fighting-type moves. This makes it excellent at capitalizing on Heracross, the number one Pokemon in UU, locking itself into the wrong move.</p> <p>However, every Pokemon has its flaws: Yanmega has a terrible quadruple weakness to Stealth Rock that limits its longevity throughout the battle unless you pack a Rapid Spin user on your team. It also has a relatively shallow movepool and is very frail on the special side, going down to any strong special move. Overall, even though one might say Yanmega is outclassed by Sharpedo, it is a very threatening Pokemon that can rip teams apart if not prepared for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As previously mentioned, Yanmega has a very limited movepool. Hypnosis can be used to put one opponent to sleep, but its shaky accuracy leaves much to be desired. Ancient Power and Silver Wind have a 10% chance of getting a boost in every stat, but are weaker than Hidden Power Rock and Bug Buzz. Substitute is Yanmega's only way of avoiding status conditions and can prove to be useful as Yanmega forces a lot of switches, but its severe weakness to Stealth Rock limits the use of this move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is and always will be Yanmega's worst nightmare, as it will simply remove 50% of Yanmega's health just by coming onto the battlefield. Snorlax and Registeel are Yanmega's best counters, as they can take two Choice Specs Bug Buzzes after Stealth Rock damage and strike back with Return or Fire Punch or cripple with Thunder Wave, respectively. Zapdos resists both of Yanmega's STAB moves and OHKOes with any Electric-type move. Empoleon also resists Yanmega's STAB moves and can retaliate with Scald or Ice Beam, dealing massive amounts of damage. Crobat outspeeds unboosted Yanmega and can take one hit and retaliate with Brave Bird. Bulky special attackers such as Raikou can also take one hit and KO Yanmega easily with a super effective move. If Yanmega stands at +1 Speed, a faster Choice Scarf user, such as Flygon, Victini, Mienshao, or Raikou, can easily revenge kill it. Weavile and Honchkrow can also revenge kill Yanmega with Ice Shard and Sucker Punch, respectively.</p> ",

Steel- and Flying-types might seem like good switch-ins for Yanmega, but all but Registeel do so only to be 2HKOed by a Bug Buzz, leaving Registeel and Snorlax as the only Pokemon that can avoid a 2HKO from Bug Buzz after Stealth Rock damage. The same effect, although to a lesser degree, is seen when using Air Slash, Yanmega's secondary STAB move, which has the nifty bonus of flinching 30% of the time. Psychic is useful to hit Crobat, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking for super effective damage or any Fighting-type if you don't trust Air Slash's 95% accuracy. As Yanmega doesn't have the greatest movepool, the last slot has two decent options in the form of U-turn and Sleep Talk. The former provides Yanmega with a quick getaway move and way to gain momentum and scout your opponent's initial switch-in. Alternatively, the latter makes Yanmega a very useful sleep absorber and one of the best switch-ins to Roserade, as it can take the Sleep Powder and threaten Roserade with one of the other moves in its arsenal.</p> <p>Because Yanmega is in a very competitive Speed tier, a Timid nature is preferred to let it outpace Jolly Heracross and Timid Nidoking, while Speed tying with Jolly Darmanitan. However, if one is looking for absurd power, Modest can be chosen to hit as hard as possible.</p> <p>Snorlax and Registeel must be eliminated in order to maximize Yanmega's effectiveness. For this reason, Heracross is a very good partner for Yanmega, as it smashes both sturdy walls with Close Combat. On the other hand, Yanmega can open up massive holes in the opponent's team, which Heracross enjoys and takes advantage of. Entry hazards are absolutely necessary for Yanmega to succeed, as they enable a lot of 2HKOs, such as specially defensive Zapdos and Empoleon. Rhyperior can set up Stealth Rock and take Rock-type moves aimed at Yanmega, while Roserade and Qwilfish can lay down Spikes effectively throughout the game. Since it is Choice-locked, Yanmega will be switching in and out often, so Rapid Spin support is mandatory. Blastoise can take Fire- and Ice-type moves thrown at Yanmega, Hitmontop soaks up Rock-type moves incredibly easily due to its resistance and ability Intimidate, and Kabutops forms a good synergy core with Yanmega, as the fossil takes Fire-, Flying-, and Ice-type moves and lures Grass-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves, perfect for Yanmega to take advantage of.</p> "

With Protect, Yanmega receives an automatic boost at the end of the turn without incurring any harm, meaning Yanmega will most likely outspeed the opposing Pokemon after using it. As stated previously, Yanmega's STAB moves in the form of Bug Buzz and Air Slash offer good coverage in the tier and hit very hard when backed up by Life Orb. Hidden Power Rock hits Fire-types, such as Arcanine, Darmanitan, and Rotom-H, and Flying-types, such as Zapdos and Crobat, for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Ground still hits Fire-types, but also the number one check to Yanmega, Registeel, for super effective damage. Giga Drain, however, destroys Swampert, Rhyperior, and bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Blastoise, while also healing Yanmega.</p> <p>As Yanmega is boosting its Speed at the end of every turn, a Modest nature is recommended to maximize its attacking power. Yanmega has a few viable options to run in the last slot: Psychic hits Crobat, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen for super effective damage, while Shadow Ball dents Cofagrigus and Mismagius. Roost is also viable to increase Yanmega's survivability, but is best used with its other ability, Tinted Lens. Heracross helps out Yanmega by removing its biggest nemeses, Snorlax and Registeel, while dealing with Empoleon, Crobat, and Zapdos accordingly after being weakened. Rapid Spin support is crucial, as Yanmega packs a quadruple weakness to Stealth Rock. Blastoise, Hitmontop, and Kabutops can perform the job easily and have good synergy with Yanmega. Finally, this set is very effective as a late-game sweeper. As such, entry hazards are required in order to weaken the opposing team. Rhyperior can lay down Stealth Rock, whereas Roserade and Qwilfish can put up Spikes on the opponent's field.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Unlike its younger brother Porygon2, Porygon-Z is made for sweeping, as its above-average offensive stats tower over its meager defensive stats. However, Porygon-Z is still overlooked for more powerful or faster sweepers such as Victini or Raikou despite having everything it needs to be a top-tier threat. With access to Agility, Nasty Plot, and two very useful abilities in Adaptability and Download, Porygon-Z is one of the underrated threats in the Underused tier, and should always be considered when building a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Porygon-Z has a fairly wide movepool, containing moves such as Psychic, Signal Beam, Thunderbolt, and Shadow Ball, but none of these add any useful coverage, as an Adaptability Tri Attack will be hitting as hard, if not harder, than these four options would in a super effective scenario. Analytic can be used, as Porygon-Z sits at a Speed tier that allows for a decently-sized portion of the tier to outspeed it, but its other abilities Download and Adaptability are usually much better and Porygon-Z lacks the bulk to be attacking last.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Beating a set-up Porygon-Z can be rather difficult, as nothing can repeatedly switch in on its barrage of Tri Attacks and coverage moves. One way of beating Porygon-Z is by outspeeding it; Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienshao and Choice Scarf Darmanitan outspeed all variants except if it is at +2 Speed and threaten back with High Jump Kick and Flare Blitz respectively. Spiritomb functions as a niche counter for Porygon-Z, taking damage from only Dark Pulse or Shadow Ball while threatening back with Pursuit or Sucker Punch. Bisharp resists both Tri Attack and Dark Pulse and can threaten Porygon-Z with a powerful STAB Sucker Punch, but fears Hidden Power Fighting. Snorlax and Porygon2 are capable of stomaching hits from the Agility set, and can even take hits from other sets, but must be wary of Choice Specs or Nasty Plot variants, as they hold the power to 2HKO the specially defensive titans. Umbreon and specially defensive Rhyperior function as decent checks to Porygon-Z, but will eventually fall from the onslaught of attacks if they cannot KO Porygon-Z fast enough.</p> ",

With the given EVs a single Agility enables Porygon-Z to outspeed Choice Scarf Mienshao, the fastest Pokemon in the Underused tier. Potentially empowered by a Special Attack boost courtesy of Download, Porygon-Z can become a menace with only a single turn of setup. Tri Attack functions as STAB and carries a handy chance to cause three different types of status: burn, paralysis, and freeze. Dark Pulse is used to hit the Ghost-type Pokemon found throughout the Underused tier such as Mismagius and Cofagrigus for super effective damage, while Hidden Power Fighting rounds off Porygon-Z's coverage, giving a solid super effective hit against Steel-type opponents such as Empoleon and Cobalion. It's all about setting up at the right time with Agility Porygon-Z: it's quite frail, it needs to find a time to set up, and it often needs to get a Download boost to sweep teams if they're not sufficiently weakened. However, once it is properly setup, it is a complete monster.</p> <p>Because this set does not hit nearly as hard as most other Porygon-Z sets, it appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Roserade, allowing it to dish out as much damage as possible. This set also appreciates having teammates such as Cobalion and Mienshao eliminate the likes of Snorlax and Porygon2, as the lack of raw power makes it harder for Porygon-Z to break through the premier special walls of the tier. In addition to beating Snorlax and Porygon2, Cobalion can also set up Stealth Rock for Porygon-Z. Porygon-Z also wants to be paired with relatively bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia, Snorlax and Cofagrigus, as it lacks any viable source of bulk, and does not want to be taking any strong attacks whatsoever.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Much like the Agility set, a Choice Scarf may be used to patch up Porygon-Z's Speed, turning it into an adept revenge killer. However, this set does not sacrifice power as much as the Agility set does, as Adaptability turns Tri Attack into a menacing 160 Base Power move when factoring in STAB. This enables Porygon-Z to muscle its way past just about anything that doesn't resist the powerhouse of a move. Dark Pulse provides coverage against Ghost-types, such as Cofagrigus and Mismagius, that might attempt to switch in on Tri Attack and begin their setup. Hidden Power Fighting prevents Steel-type Pokemon, such as Registeel and Bisharp, from flat-out walling Porygon-Z. Trick is a sneaky move that cripples slower setup Pokemon such as Bronzong and Gligar, rendering them next to useless throughout the remainder of the match. Because of the sheer power in an Adaptability-boosted Tri Attack, this Porygon-Z variant has the potential to beat its common switch-ins, Porygon2 and Snorlax.</p> <p>Thunderbolt can be used over Trick for additional coverage against the Water- and Flying-types found in the Underused tier, but an Adaptability-boosted Tri Attack will be doing only slightly less damage. Also, common Pokemon such as Flygon, Swampert, and Rhyperior are immune to Electric-type attacks and giving any of those Pokemon a free turn can be deadly. Pokemon such as Roserade and Gligar make for good teammates, as they can both set up the entry hazards that Porygon-Z appreciates having its opponents switch into, and they can both take Fighting-type attacks aimed at Porygon-Z as well. Porygon-Z also likes having bulky teammates such as Milotic and Rhyperior available, as Porygon-Z more or less implodes once touched by a powerful attack, and wants teammates that can take those hits. Download may be used over Adaptability to possibly give a boost to Poygon-Z's other attacks, but much like on the Internet, downloading things can be harmful, and the boost is not always guaranteed. A Modest nature may be used in place of a Timid nature to secure more powerful hits against Porygon-Z's switch-ins, but due to the popularity of Choice Scarf Heracross, it is recommended that Porygon-Z run maximum speed.</p> "

With Adaptability, Tri Attack becomes a very powerful move. To show exactly how powerful it is, here's how it fares against some of the specially defensive Pokemon in the Underused tier:</p> <ul> <li>Tri Attack vs. 252/80 Porygon2 50.8%-59.89% <li>Tri Attack vs. 208/176+ Snorlax 41.33%-48.73%</li> <li>Tri Attack vs. 252/252+ Umbreon 45.17%-53.29%</li> <li>Tri Attack vs. 248/236+ Zapdos 60.57%-71.54%</li> <li>Tri Attack vs. 252/136+ Roserade 69.75%-82.71%</li> <li>Tri Attack vs. 248/176+ Slowking 53.94%-63.61%</li> </ul> <p>This means that Porygon2, Zapdos, Roserade, and Slowking are all 2HKOed no matter what, and Umbreon is 2HKOed with Stealth Rock on the field. This leaves very few safe switch-ins to Porygon-Z. Dark Pulse annihilates any Ghost-type Pokemon that is gutsy enough to step in front of a Tri Attack, such as Cofagrigus or Sableye, and Hidden Power Fighting rounds off the coverage, reducing Steel-type Pokemon such as Empoleon or Bisharp to dust. Trick is a nasty move that cripples setup sweepers and walls, making them easier for your team to plow through.</p> <p>A Timid nature may be used over a Modest nature to gain the jump on neutral-nature Roserade or neutral base 100 Speed Pokemon, but reduces Porygon-Z's wallbreaking power. Like the Choice Scarf set, Thunderbolt can be used over Trick for extra coverage, but is not recommended as Choice Specs Tri Attack already nukes so much of the tier and really hurts whatever Thunderbolt would be targeted at. Entry hazard and paralysis support from Pokemon such as Roserade, Claydol, and Xatu are appreciated by this slower variant of Porygon-Z, allowing it to outspeed and destroy the opposing team. Porygon-Z pairs nicely with bulky Pokemon such as Cresselia and Snorlax, as it cannot stomach any hits at all.

It also provides an easy to spam move, 2HKOing or OHKOing the majority of the Underused tier. Dark Pulse and Hidden Power Fighting provide excellent coverage and dispatch the Ghost- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Cofagrigus or Registeel that would normally scoff at Tri Attack.

This variant of Porygon-Z appreciates Stealth Rock support from Pokemon such as Claydol or Gligar, as it helps break any stray Focus Sashes, enabling Porygon-Z to sweep undisturbed. Paralysis support from Pokemon such as Xatu or Rotom-H is also appreciated, especially if a Modest nature is being used, as it allows Porygon-Z to outspeed and nuke faster threats. Porygon-Z still wants to be put on a team with bulky Pokemon such as Cofagrigus and Porygon2, as it lacks solid bulk and won't be taking powerful attacks exceptionally well.

    "overview": "<p>With the transition from DPP to BW, the Rotom formes traded their Ghost typings for that of their respective signature moves, leaving Rotom as the only Electric / Ghost Pokemon. Its unique typing grants it resistances and immunities to common attacking types such as Electric, Fighting, Bug, and Ground. This in turn gives Rotom numerous opportunities to switch in and pose a nuisance, which it excels at thanks to moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Trick, and Volt Switch. Rotom's stats don't disappoint either: it has relatively good Speed, decent Special Attack, and moderate defenses. Altogether, Rotom is a great Pokemon, and with proper investment can shine in a variety of roles, both offensive and defensive.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom has a few other offensive options worth considering. A RestTalk set can be used along with Will-O-Wisp and Thunderbolt in the last two slots; the EVs and nature should be taken from the Physically Defensive set. A SubCharge set is also an option, considering Rotom is immune to Seismic Toss. Access to Pain Split makes it even more effective, but Rotom generally lacks the bulk to be an effective slow boosting threat. Defensively, Rotom can use Spite, but it's more of a gimmick and is rather situational. Finally, Rotom receives Rain Dance and Sunny Day, and thanks to its decent Speed stat can pull it off fairly reliably, but it is neither an exceptional weather supporter nor weather abuser.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Faster Ghost- and Dark-type Pokemon with strong STAB attacks can easily OHKO offensive Rotom and Taunt defensive variants, rendering them useless. Houndoom in particular receives a Flash Fire boost from Will-O-Wisp, outspeeds Rotom, and can do massive damage with any of Dark Pulse, Pursuit, and Sucker Punch. Bisharp possesses STAB Sucker Punch, Honchkrow has Pursuit in addition to Sucker Punch (but must watch out for Rotom's Electric-type STAB attacks), Weavile outspeeds Rotom and packs powerful Dark-type moves in Pursuit and Night Slash, and finally, Krookodile laughs at both of Rotom's STAB attacks. However, none of the above Pokemon will appreciate being burnt. Mismagius can put up a Substitute to block status, outspeed Rotom, and OHKO it with Shadow Ball, but can't switch in safely as it is weak to Rotom's Shadow Ball. Special walls can take hits from Rotom all day, heal off the damage, and cripple Rotom with status moves, slowly stalling it out, while specially defensive tanks such as Snorlax can comfortably sponge a hit and retaliate with a super effective Crunch or Pursuit. The aforementioned duo are rendered useless by Trick, however, and take significant damage from Pain Split due to their huge HP stats. While not a dedicated special wall, Steelix deserves a mention for nonetheless being an excellent Rotom check; a resistance to Ghost-type moves and an immunity to Electric-type ones allows it to come in on Choice variants with ease and cripple Rotom with status.</p> ",

With immunities to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, as well as a neutrality to Stealth Rock, Rotom can switch in and out many times while taking minimal damage. However, this is not the only factor that makes Rotom's Choice sets very effective: when equipped with a Choice item, Rotom becomes a very potent threat. With a Modest nature and a Choice Scarf, Rotom reaches a Speed stat of 421, while Timid Choice Specs Rotom attains a sky-high Special Attack stat of</p> <ol> <li></li> </ol> <p>Aside from being a solid STAB attack, Volt Switch is an excellent momentum-grabbing move, which racks up damage and scouts the opponent's switch-in. Thunderbolt is another option for greater power, and can grant Choice Scarf Rotom an easier endgame sweep. However, be careful about recklessly using either of these moves, as Ground-types and Pokemon such as Volt Absorb Jolteon, who are immune to Electric-type moves, will leave Rotom no choice but to switch out with its metaphorical tail between its legs. Shadow Ball, Rotom's secondary STAB attack, has good synergy with its Electric-type STAB, as few commonly seen Pokemon resist both moves. Rounding out Rotom's arsenal, Hidden Power Fighting grants unresisted coverage alongside Rotom's dual STAB, hitting Steelix, Magneton, Krookodile, and the rare Ferroseed super effectively. Despite being super effective, however, even Choice Specs Hidden Power Fighting will scarcely dent the likes of Snorlax, hence the last move, Trick. With a little prediction, this nifty move can easily render most walls and bulky Ground-types, such as Gligar and Quagsire, virtually useless.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass can replace Hidden Power Fighting to surprise the aforementioned bulky Ground-types, Rhyperior in particular, but Trick often deals with them just as effectively. If choosing Hidden Power Ice, Rotom should also utilize Choice Scarf and a Timid nature in order to revenge kill Adamant Choice Scarf Flygon and all Choice Scarf Nidoking. Maximum Speed investment also allows Choice Scarf Rotom to outspeed all +2 Gorebyss and neutral-natured +1 Sharpedo, making it an option worth considering if these threats are troublesome. On the other hand, a Modest nature gives all Rotom a much-needed boost to its unremarkable base 95 Special Attack. Discharge and Thunder are alternative primary STAB moves, but the former's power drop is undesirable on an offensive Rotom, while the latter's accuracy is poor outside of rain, and there are better Rain Dance abusers out there. Finally, Will-O-Wisp, though odd on a Choice set, may be useful to cripple physically based Ground-types who switch in looking to catch Rotom locked into Volt Switch, if Trick isn't your cup of tea.</p> <p>While Rotom's three attacks have excellent coverage together, neither of its STABs are particularly good attacking types to be locked into: the numerous Ground-types in UU, such as Rhyperior, Flygon, and even Nidoking, laugh at Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, and thanks to their high offensive stats, can pose a significant threat to your team. Normal-types, particularly Snorlax and Clefable, take no damage from Shadow Ball and can retaliate with crippling status or a super effective Crunch; Dark-types, such as Weavile, Bisharp, and Krookodile can also switch into Shadow Ball and decimate Rotom with a powerful STAB Pursuit. There are many ways to handle the individual Ground-type threats; bulky Water- and Grass-types, such as Slowbro, Suicune, Roserade, and Shaymin, generally fare well. Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop, Machamp, and Heracross, are good options to help your team counter the latter threats, but Rotom must tread carefully so as to avoid eating a boosted Pursuit.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With 50 / 77 / 77 defenses, Rotom is hardly exceptional defensively. However, its access to a move that halves a foe's Attack, as well as one that recovers health, grants it the potential to be a good physical wall and a significant threat to the opposition. Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split are the two aforementioned moves; the former inflicts the burn status, drastically decreasing the damage output of enemy physical attackers, while Pain Split gives Rotom some form of recovery, especially when used on high HP foes such as Snorlax. Thunderbolt is Rotom's main STAB attack due to its high Base Power, but Discharge is a viable option for a greater chance of paralysis. Bear in mind, though, that it might activate at the wrong time, paralyzing a threat you would rather have burnt. Shadow Ball offers Rotom a way to hit the physically attacking Ground-types it can wall, which are immune to Thunderbolt and Discharge, and gets a STAB boost as well. Toxic is another option to consider in the fourth moveslot as it enables Rotom to cripple special attackers, who typically don't mind being burnt.</p> <p>The EV spread and nature maximize Rotom's physical bulk, enabling it to better switch into physical attackers in order to burn them. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature can be used, as Will-O-Wisp shores Rotom up on the physical side; however, the former option is preferred as Snorlax is far superior at walling special threats. Thunder Wave can be run over Shadow Ball or Toxic to provide yet another form of status support. Will-O-Wisp should never be replaced, though.</p> <p>Physically defensive Rotom pairs nicely with a Normal-type special wall, such as Clefable or Snorlax, to supplement it on its weaker defensive side. Rotom covers their Fighting-type weakness with an immunity, and the former two provide Rotom with Wish support, which will be especially useful mid- and late-game, when the effectiveness of Pain Split will likely be reduced. Physical Fire-type attackers and Guts users, such as Victini, Darmanitan, Arcanine, and Heracross, can be problematic too, because Rotom cannot neuter them with Will-O-Wisp.

This set's execution is simple but effective: put up Reflect or Light Screen depending on the opponent, and when both screens are up, Volt Switch out to bring a sweeper in safely. Will-O-Wisp is a fantastic move to use alongside Volt Switch as it allows Rotom to burn Ground-types, most of whom are physically inclined; it also enables even this less defensive Rotom to completely wall most physical threats behind Reflect. Lastly, Shadow Ball is a good option for players more concerned about Taunt. Bear in mind, however, that Azelf has far better offenses, Uxie has superior utility in Heal Bell, Yawn, and Memento, Xatu has the Magic Bounce ability, while Cresselia has unparalleled bulk. Therefore, when looking to Rotom as a dual screener, be sure to play to its advantages, namely Volt Switch, Will-O-Wisp, resistances to Steel- and Bug-type moves, as well as spinblocking capability.</p> <p>Dual Screens Rotom doesn't have many other options. The EV spread and nature shouldn't be altered: maximum Speed investment, as well as a boosting nature, allow Rotom to outspeed as many opposing Pokemon as possible, while the rest of the EVs grant it the best overall bulk possible by maximizing its poor HP. Light Clay extends the duration of both Reflect and Light Screen, providing maximum support for Rotom's teammates. Though generally not recommended, Leftovers can be used over Light Clay for some form of recovery. Pain Split can also be run in the last slot to grant Rotom an alternative form of healing without the need to forgo Light Clay.</p> <p>The most important teammates for any dual screener are frail, powerful Pokemon that can abuse the protection the screens grant them. Shell Smash Baton Pass users, namely Gorebyss and Smeargle, come to mind here. Cobalion can come in on Dark- and Ghost-type attacks aimed at Rotom, possibly gaining an Attack boost in the process, and set up Swords Dance or Calm Mind. This makes Cobalion an excellent partner for this Rotom variant, as dual screens go a long way in mitigating Cobalion's lack of priority, making it much harder to revenge kill.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>When looking at Rotom-H, the first thing that comes to mind is it's a floating microwave oven wearing oven mitts. At second glance, you realize it's the only Levitating Fire-type, which means it's immune to Ground-type moves but its Stealth Rock weakness is not increased. Its unique typing also grants it seven resistances and only two weaknesses, along with an amazing STAB combination resisted by very few Pokemon in the Underused metagame. It also has nice defenses, which allow it to survive weak super effective moves such as from uninvested Blastoise and Milotic. However, Rotom-H does have its drawbacks, being weak to Stealth Rock and having to rely on Overheat for a STAB move, which only adds to the hazard damage it's going to have to take by forcing it to switch out. It also has four-moveslot syndrome, as it can't run Volt Switch and Thunderbolt together without losing important coverage on certain Pokemon.</p> <p>With all of that taken into account, Rotom-H can actually perform really well with the right support. Its amazing STAB combination makes most bulky Water-types hesitant to switch in, it has good support moves in Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Toxic, and it has a form of recovery in Pain Split, allowing it to take advantage of its normal switch-ins. Additionally, its ability to run three different sets with good results make it hard for the opponent to predict correctly, since it can punish the counters to one with Will-O-Wisp, Trick, or a super effective coverage move. It also has the added benefit of checking many prominent special attacking threats, such as Tornadus, Zapdos, Nidoking, and Yanmega. Overall, Rotom-H is a very good Pokemon, something that should be considered for any team needing its abilities.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-H has several different options it can run. For starters, a RestTalk set gives it better recovery and takes advantage of its good coverage between two moves, however sleep mechanics make it unviable. Rotom-H can run a Substitute+Pain Split set, but being essentially forced to run Overheat makes Rotom-H have to switch out much more often. Discharge is an option over Volt Switch and Thunderbolt on all of its sets, but it's mostly a lesser choice due to the loss of momentum from the former and more power from the latter. Additionally, the things that switch in on it usually won't mind the paralysis anyway; that's why Thunder Wave is also generally worse than Will-O-Wisp. Toxic can be used instead of Will-O-Wisp, since none of Rotom-H's common switch-ins like being badly poisoned. However, since it has a much wider distribution, it's a weaker alternative. Rotom-H also has access to Shadow Ball and Signal Beam to beat Psychic-types, just like the other electric appliances. However, Overheat is initially more powerful against them, except for Slowbro and Slowking, both of which are weak to Electric-type moves anyway.</p> <p>Finally, although gimmicky, Rotom-H can run a Trick+Flame Orb set, being able to cripple its usual switch-ins, such as Snorlax, Swampert, Rhyperior, and Flygon, due to the fact that the item doesn't activate on Fire-types and can therefore be used to feign a Choice item. A Tricked Flame Orb has the added benefit of not being curable by using Rest or having a cleric as a partner, unlike Will-O-Wisp; however, since it's one-time use and requires perfect prediction, it's usually not worth it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to the different sets it can run and how it can punish its switch-ins with ease, it's hard to counter Rotom-H. That said, Rhyperior, Swampert, Flygon, and Quagsire resist Overheat and are immune to Electric-type moves, so they can switch in on its STABs with ease. However, none of them like being crippled with a burn from Will-O-Wisp, and Rotom-H can also deal with them with a Hidden Power of choice. Hidden Power Grass beats all of them bar Flygon, which dislikes Hidden Power Ice and also can't switch in with ease on a Choice Specs Overheat. Snorlax takes little damage from Overheat thanks to its immense special bulk and Thick Fat, while Volt Switch actually does the same amount of damage. It can also threaten to Pursuit it on the switch out. However, non-Choice Band versions hate being tricked a Choice item, and Will-O-Wisp will force it to Rest or completely cripple those that do have a Choice Band.</p> <p>With that in mind, it's not really hard to deal with Rotom-H due to Overheat's massive drawback. With the right prediction, those that resist or are immune to the move, such as Kingdra or Snorlax, can actually use Rotom-H as setup fodder. Additionally, since it can be forced out with ease, the best way to deal with it is to ensure Stealth Rock is laid on the field.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs makes Rotom-H's Overheat hit weaker resists like Flygon extremely hard. Volt Switch gives it good momentum and also packs some firepower, while Thunderbolt hits much harder and allows it to beat bulky Water-types more reliably. Hidden Power Grass is the coverage move of choice, helping Rotom-H deal with Rhyperior, Swampert, and Quagsire OHKOing them on the switch. Trick allows it to cripple Snorlax, Umbreon, and Porygon2, three Pokemon that take little from its STAB moves.</p> <p>This set is mostly used on offensive teams due to hitting like a truck, but it can also work as a pivot for bulky offense and semi-stall. Choice Specs augments Rotom-H's offensive presence, allowing it to 2HKO most of the Underused metagame even with the power drop from Overheat. A Timid nature allows it to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Heracross and Nidoking, without losing much power, but a Modest nature can work; however, it will not turn 2HKOs into OHKOs, just improve the chances. Rotom-H can run a more defensive spread to act as a tank, with 252 HP EVs and a Modest nature. However, it loses its ability to counter Nidoking reliably. Thanks to its seven resistances and one immunity, Rotom-H gets a lot of opportunities to switch in, such as on a Choiced Earthquake or U-turn from Flygon or Thunderbolt or Volt Switch from Raikou or Zapdos. Substitute versions of Raikou beat it one on one, though. Besides the given moves, Rotom-H can also run Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers. It can be used instead of Hidden Power Grass—since neither Rhyperior nor Swampert enjoy being burnt—or Trick, to force Snorlax to Rest. Rotom-H can also run Hidden Power Ice over Hidden Power Grass to beat Flygon and Druddigon that try to switch in on it, but Overheat already does a lot to them, and Hidden Power Grass is overall better.</p> <p>As for teammates, since Rotom-H is a hit-and-run Pokemon with a Stealth Rock weakness, it needs Rapid Spin support to perform effectively. Notable ones are Blastoise and Hitmontop, the former resisting Water and the latter Rock. It should be noted, however, that both take precious momentum from your team, so you can always run Xatu instead, which can bounce back Stealth Rock due to its ability and form a nice VoltTurn core with Rotom-H. In order to beat Rhyperior and Swampert, a Grass-type Pokemon can help. Shaymin is probably the best one at doing that, taking little from their moves, but Virizion is also an option as it also resists Rock; it's much frailer on the physical side, though. Finally, since this Rotom-H is mostly used as a wallbreaker, Pokemon that enjoy the removal or weakening of things like Gligar and Slowbro, such as Choice Scarf Darmanitan, make great partners for it.</p> "

Overheat packs less power without Choice Specs, but it still OHKOes many fast threats such as Mienshao, Weavile and Choice Scarf Heracross. Volt Switch takes advantage of this set's Speed to switch out unscathed to something that takes advantage of the other Pokemon and allows Rotom-H to maintain momentum. Thunderbolt does have more power, though, so it's a viable alternative. Hidden Power Grass hits Swampert and Rhyperior hard, but it should be noted that it's not always going to score the OHKO, so it can be taken advantage of for a free switch-in for something else. Trick rounds out the set, allowing Rotom-H to cripple Snorlax and Umbreon, among others, and force them to do little for the rest of the match.</p> <p>The EV spread is fairly self-explanatory, with the remaining 4 EVs dropped into Special Defense to give Porygon2 and Porygon-Z an Attack boost instead of a Special Attack one. While a Modest nature helps compensate for the lack of immediate power, Timid is needed to outpace and revenge kill Jolly Choice Scarf Heracross and Timid Choice Scarf Nidoking. Hidden Power Ice can be used over Hidden Power Grass to revenge kill Choice Band Flygon—especially if it's locked into Outrage—, but it's a lesser option outside of that. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are nice options for crippling threats such as Choice Band Rhyperior and Swampert and non-Substitute Raikou, respectively, allowing teammates to deal with them more easily; however, Rotom-H can easily run into problems if it uses these, since being locked into a non-attacking move gives free switches to threats such as Guts Heracross. As for teammates, since Rotom-H is used as a revenge killer it can fit on both offensive and balanced teams. However, being Stealth Rock weak and being forced out with ease due to Overheat mean Rapid Spin support is almost mandatory. Blastoise and Hitmontop are good options for this, each resisting one of Rotom-H's weaknesses. If you can't fit them into your team due to the loss of momentum they force, Magic Bounce Xatu can be used, forming a speedy VoltTurn core with Rotom-H. Spikes stacking also works well with this Rotom-H, since its offensive presence keeps Rapid Spinners on their toes. Roserade and Qwilfish both do a decent job at this, while also being able to switch in on Water-type moves aimed at Rotom-H from Pokemon that switched in on Overheat, such as Slowbro and Suicune; Roserade has the added benefit of easily beating them.</p> "

It sacrifices the power from Choice Specs and Speed from Choice Scarf for durability and the ability to cripple its usual switch-ins without having to predict correctly. Overheat is the main STAB move, still hitting decently hard. Volt Switch is the secondary move and hits bulky Water-types hard while gaining momentum. Thunderbolt is stronger, but since Water-types will usually switch into Overheat, its power will be severely diminished and could lead to Rotom-H's defeat. Of the few Pokemon that resist Rotom-H's STAB combination—Swampert, Rhyperior, and Flygon being the most worth mentioning— none like to eat a Will-O-Wisp to the face; Hidden Power Grass is a nice alternative to dealing with the first two, but again, if they switch into Overheat, even the 4x modifier will not be enough. Pain Split rounds out the set, offering Rotom-H a semi-reliable recovery move that can be used to take advantage of the high HP of the Pokemon that it draws out, notable ones being Swampert, Rhyperior, Snorlax and Umbreon.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Rotom-H's offensive prowess, with a Timid nature to outspeed Life Orb Nidoking, Timid Togekiss, and non-Choice Scarf Heracross, as well as Kingdra—allowing it to Volt Switch out of the latter. The 4 EVs in Special Defense give Porygon2 and Porygon-Z that switch in on it an Attack boost. Rotom-H can also run a more defensive spread, with enough Speed to outpace Adamant Honchkrow and a Modest nature, using Will-O-Wisp to get around the threat of Sucker Punch. Life Orb can be used over Leftovers to deal more damage, pairing well with Pain Split. Rotom-H can run other status moves, such as Thunder Wave and Toxic, to cripple faster threats that don't mind burns much. However, since most of its switch-ins are immune to or don't mind Thunder Wave and Toxic can be run by many other Pokemon, Will-O-Wisp is usually the better option. Additionally, both moves can be counterproductive against Umbreon due to Synchronize, since it usually has Heal Bell to cure itself from status while leaving Rotom-H poisoned or paralyzed—that's not a problem for Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>As for partners, Rapid Spin support is nice but not as mandatory as with the Choice sets. Hitmontop and Blastoise are the best options. Xatu can also work due to Magic Bounce preventing Stealth Rock from being set up, though it requires prediction, especially against Rhyperior, which is the most threatening hazard user for Rotom-H. Since Snorlax walls Rotom-H completely, Fighting-types such as Mienshao and Heracross make great teammates due to Volt Switch, while Hitmontop can also work due to Intimidate.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>In a tier dominated by Water-, Electric-, and Ground-types, such as Suicune, Slowbro, Raikou, and Rhyperior, Rotom-C stands out as a great check to many of them. It is one of the best Water-type counters in the game, with its Electric and Grass STABs providing super effective coverage against any Water-type. Unfortunately, with pros come cons, and while Rotom-C resists some of the main offensive types in the UU metagame, it is also weak to other common offensive types including Ice, Fire and Bug.</p> <p>Rotom-C's movepool gives it a number of offensive and defensive options. Rotom-C functions well as a Choice Scarf user thanks to its base 86 Speed, which is a cut above base 85s such as Heracross. Rotom-C's immunity to Earthquake also comes in handy, as this means it can switch in and out freely with Volt Switch. The ability to use Trick complements Choice sets well, as it can either cripple opposing walls and render them useless or ease prediction by Tricking an offensive enemy. However, if Choice items are not your cup of tea, then Rotom-C can also elect to run a non-Choiced set with Pain Split. Rotom-C also has access to niche status moves, such as Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, to cripple opponents, a combination of moves which other Electric- and Grass-types rarely have. Finally, Volt Switch allows Rotom-C to gain momentum by ensuring the correct switch, making it a useful partner to offensive threats. In conclusion, Rotom-C is a very good Pokemon and is capable of succeeding more than decently with just the right amount of support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave can be used over Will-O-Wisp as a status move to cripple fast enemies if physical attackers aren't a problem for the team. Charge Beam is an alternative option to facilitate a late-game sweep if used correctly. Shadow Ball can be used as an extra coverage option to attack the numerous Ghost- and Psychic-types in the tier, such as Mew, Mismagius, Cofagrigus and more, dealing similar super effective damage to a neutral Leaf Storm but not causing a -2 Special Attack drop. A ChestoRest set can give Rotom-C another chance at life to help the team. This is possible on the bulky set to restore Rotom-C to full health. A RestTalk set can be used instead to give better recovery to Rotom-C. It can also be used as a sleep fodder for the team, but that is better left to other superior sleep fodders such as Suicune. It is possible to run a SubSplit set, but Leaf Storm's -2 Special Attack drop makes it difficult to keep Rotom-C on the field for long, which reduces staying power and makes it unviable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Several notable checks to Rotom-C include Fire-types, such as Arcanine and Victini, which can tank Leaf Storms and Hidden Powers and retaliate with a STAB Fire move, which can usually OHKO Rotom-C. Fast Ice-types, such as Weavile, serve as temporary checks that can OHKO with a STAB Ice move but are unable to switch in on Leaf Storm. Escavalier, Durant, and Ferroseed resist Rotom-C's STAB moves and can OHKO back, but can be dealt with a 4x effective Hidden Power Fire. Roserade can take Leaf Storms and Thunderbolts and set up on Rotom-C or even OHKO with a Sludge Bomb, while being bulky enough to take two or three super effective Hidden Powers. To deal with such checks, it is possible to repeatedly use the appropriate coverage move to deal super effective damage to them or just switch out either conventionally or with Volt Switch.</p> <p>Hard counters to Rotom-C include Rotom-H and Snorlax. Rotom-H resists all of the attacks Rotom-C can throw at it and OHKOes with Overheat while not minding Trick. Snorlax has massive HP and Special Defense, allowing it to wall Rotom-C, and can dent it with Return or catch it on the Volt Switch with Pursuit. Tricking a Choice Specs onto Snorlax can cripple it for the match, however. In such cases, the preferred method is still to Volt Switch out and let an appropriate teammate deal with Snorlax, as Rotom-C does not always want to lose its Choice item.</p> ",

Meanwhile, Volt Switch can be used to gain momentum on the opponent by switching out to counter whatever your foe just switched in, although if you predict a Ground-type switch-in, you can use Leaf Storm to, more often than not, OHKO it.</p> <p>Trick can be used to nullify a dedicated special wall's utility, and because special tanks, such as Snorlax and Porygon2, make for good switch-ins to Rotom-C, it is relatively easy to predict a switch. Rotom-C's dual STABs, although deadly to Water-types, are unfortunately resisted by Grass-types. A Hidden Power on Rotom-C can be used to relieve this burden, but most Grass-types are only 2HKOed by Hidden Power and can take action against Rotom-C. Fret not, as Volt Switch on Rotom-C does just the job by allowing you to switch out to an appropriate Grass-type counter.</p> <p>Math dictates that a STAB neutral Thunderbolt does more damage than a super effective Hidden Power.

Rotom-C is able to support Spikes stackers thanks to its offensive presence, being able to annihilate common spinners such as Blastoise, Claydol, and even Hitmontop. An exceptional Spikes user that pairs well with Rotom-C is Qwilfish, as it resists the Bug-, Ice-, Poison-, and Fire-type moves that are dangerous for Rotom-C, while Rotom-C provides Electric and Ground resistances.</p> "

Thunderbolt can be used to dish out more damage to enemy Pokemon, but Volt Switch permits switching to a more suitable teammate, thereby keeping momentum.

A good candidate for fighting Fire-types is Blastoise, which also has the ability to spin away Stealth Rock from the field, which causes irritating residual damage to Rotom-C. Offensive threats which appreciate the removal of bulky Water-types —for example, Slowbro and Suicune—make good partners to Rotom-C, thanks to Volt Switch's ability to gain momentum.

This set works better on more balanced teams, as it sacrifices power and speed for bulk, semi-reliable recovery, and the ability to switch moves, while also packing a status move to support its team. Leaf Storm is the main offensive move used as usual, but it is hard to use on this set, since it will be extremely weakened after the first use.

    "overview": "<p>Do not be fooled by Uxie's miniature size: 75 / 130 / 130 defenses make the tiny pixie incredibly sturdy. In addition, Uxie is quite fast for a wall, which can be useful in certain scenarios. Uxie's plethora of support moves, such as Yawn, Thunder Wave, the infamous dual screen + Memento combination, Trick, Rain Dance, and Trick Room also makes it a great supportive Pokemon for your team. However, Uxie faces stiff competition for this role with its fellow Psychic-type brethren, particularly Cresselia, because the pixie lacks a reliable means of recovery. This also hinders Uxie's walling capacity since it cannot take on repeated blows. Those that are super effective are especially troubling, and with its pitiful Special Attack, Uxie cannot do much in return, making it very vulnerable to Taunt. Nevertheless, Uxie is an interesting Pokemon who is always full of tricks and surprises.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Uxie has a few more options that it can use. One fun set to use is a TrickScarf set. Defensive Pokemon love to switch into and set up on Uxie, but Tricking a Choice Scarf onto them will teach them a lesson. An offensive Calm Mind set may work, but Uxie will have stiff competition with its fellow Psychic-types such as Slowbro, who have access to recovery. As for alternate moves, Knock Off is fun to use on a unsuspecting Dusclops, but does not have much use outside of that. Uxie can opt to run Toxic in place of Yawn, but without a reliable means of recovery, it should not attempt to take down stall teams in the first place.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Uxie absolutely hates Taunt, especially if they are from a faster Pokemon, such as Crobat, Cobalion, Ambipom, Houndoom, and Aerodactyl. Crobat will have to watch out for Psychic, though. Pokemon who can set up a Substitute before Uxie can attack or inflict a status condition will generally have the upper hand. One example is Mismagius, who is a lot faster than Uxie, can set up a Substitute, and proceed to use Nasty Plot. Another example would be Zapdos, who can stall Uxie with a combination of Substitute, Roost, Toxic, and its Pressure ability. Speaking of stall, Uxie also has issues with defensive Pokemon if it does not run Yawn or Toxic. Cresselia and Registeel both have more than enough bulk to laugh off Uxie's attacks and can proceed to status it or set up. In addition, Uxie lacks a reliable means of recovery, so powerful or super effective moves from Pokemon such as Escavalier, Mismagius, and Houndoom can quickly wear it down.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Like most of its Psychic-type cousins, Uxie can set up both Reflect and Light Screen, a tactic commonly referred to as \"dual screening\". However, Uxie's immense bulk and movepool, including its ace in the hole, Memento, sets it apart from its fellow dual screen users. In conjunction with both Light Screen and Reflect, Memento's ability to harshly lower the foe's offensive stats nearly guarantees that a frail sweeper will survive even the strongest of attacks, and since Uxie sacrifices itself in the process, said sweeper can be safely brought into the field. Memento is also a great emergency option to get a frail Pokemon in if Uxie does not have enough time to set up both screens. However, in some cases it may be the best to keep Uxie alive for as long as possible, such as against stall teams, since Memento is useless against most walls and defensive Pokemon. Therefore, U-turn is viable as an alternate option. Yawn is listed in the last moveslot to give Uxie and its teammates an easier time setting up. However, this would leave Uxie vulnerable to Pokemon who can Taunt it, so Psychic is a good alternative to prevent the pixie from becoming Taunt bait.</p> <p>The EV spread here is quite simple: maximum HP and Defense allow Uxie to sponge attacks with ease, especially behind screens. However, feel free to alter this spread to make Uxie take on special attackers better. In addition, one may wish to take advantage of Uxie's Speed by using a spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Timid nature. With Uxie's natural bulk and dual screens, it can afford to move EVs from Defense to Speed. If, for whatever reason, the moves listed in the fourth moveslot are unappealing, Uxie can run Heal Bell to aid its teammates, or Thunder Wave to further cripple enemy offensive teams.</p> <p>When choosing Uxie as a dual screens user, it is important to know that it faces stiff competition from other Pokemon, most notably Azelf, who boasts a higher Speed stat, offensive stats, and a better offensive movepool; and Cresselia, who has more bulk and access to recovery moves. Uxie's advantages over these two Pokemon is that it has a plethora of support moves to choose from, most notably Heal Bell, and is bulky yet fast, making it a speedy wall. Keep these factors in mind when choosing a dual screens supporter for your team.</p> <p>Dual screen Uxie is best appreciated by offensive teams, particularly those that rely on heavy offense. As such, it would be best to pair Uxie up with frail sweepers. Houndoom, for example, will almost certainly have an easier time setting up behind Reflect and Light Screen, and can switch into any Dark-type attacks that hurt Uxie. SmashPassers such as Smeargle and Gorebyss will also appreciate dual screens, because Shell Smash will lower their already below-average defensive stats if they do not use White Herb. This also allows the SmashPassers to forgo White Herb with another item.</p> <p>Although Uxie can be a monster to take down if both screens are set up, Pokemon who can Taunt it, such as Crobat and Aerodactyl, will almost always shut it down. Opposing Pokemon can also set up on Uxie while it is busy setting up dual screens. Smeargle, for example, can Spore Uxie and proceed to set up. One way to prevent this is to pair Uxie up with Magic Bounce Xatu, although having two Psychic-type Pokemon on the same team may leave some large weaknesses to Ghost- and Dark-type moves.</p> "

Uxie should be brought in against a Pokemon that cannot deal to much damage to it. From there, it should cause as much chaos as possible. Stealth Rock is a very notable move for this set because it is no longer a TM move, causing compatibility issues with many BW Pokemon. Fortunately, Uxie is saved from this dilemma, and should lay down the entry hazard as early as possible. After that, Uxie can use U-turn to scout the enemy team and scoot away to an appropriate match-up, or cripple the foe with Thunder Wave. Although not listed on the set, Uxie can use Toxic instead of Thunder Wave to take care of any defensive walls that may trouble it. Psychic gives Uxie an attacking option and is its best bet against any Crobat that may try to Taunt it. However, Psychic may not be too appealing with Uxie's uninvested base 75 Special Attack stat, so you may want to choose Heal Bell instead to rid Uxie's teammates of nasty status conditions. Yawn is also an option for the third moveslot, phazing out a troublesome Pokemon and racking up entry hazard damage.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Defense allows Uxie to absorb blows and live long enough to support its teammates. Frail Spikes users such as Roserade, Smeargle, and Scolipede will thus appreciate having Uxie as a teammate. Another viable move option which Uxie can use is Magic Coat. Magic Coat will instantly relieve Uxie's fear of being Taunted or set up upon by bouncing those moves right back at them, although it requires some prediction.</p> <p>Since Support Uxie can fit on almost any team, there are no specific teammates that it needs. Uxie will also rack up entry hazard damage fairly quickly, so a Rapid Spinner helps. Hitmontop has good synergy with Uxie, since it resists Uxie's weakness to Bug and Dark-type attacks, and the pixie resists Hitmontop's Psychic-type weakness. Uxie cannot do much to opposing walls and defensive Pokemon, so teammates that can demolish them are a godsend to Uxie. One way to do this is by having Pokemon who can lay down Toxic Spikes--Scolipede, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, and Roserade excel at this. As a bonus, Uxie can easily take on any Psychic-type attacks aimed at them. Pokemon who can use Taunt to shut down opposing walls, such as Houndoom and Crobat, also make good partners. Another way to destroy opposing bulky Pokemon is by having hard-hitters such as Heracross and Choice Band Escavalier on Uxie's team.

Although one might immediately compare Uxie to Mew, who has overall better bulk, slightly better Speed, as well as better offenses, it lacks the Ground-type immunity Uxie sports, making Mew vulnerable to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Calm Mind boosts Uxie's already great Special Defense, and raises its Special Attack to threatening levels. Substitute blocks dangerous status such as paralysis and Toxic poison, and after a few Calm Mind boosts, Uxie's Substitutes are sturdy enough to withstand most special attacks, even some super effective ones. Psychic is Uxie's most powerful attack, and can destroy anything that does not resist it after a few boosts. Thanks to Uxie's immense bulk, it isn't too difficult to accumulate many boosts. Thunderbolt complements Psychic nicely, landing neutral hits on most things that either resist or are immune to Psychic, with the exception of Krookodile and Steelix, both of which are relatively uncommon in the UU metagame. Psyshock is a viable alternative over Psychic in order to do more damage to special walls, but its lower Base Power makes it less appealing.</p> <p>The given EV spread along with a Timid nature allows Uxie to outspeed Rotom, which is arguably the most important thing Uxie needs to outrun, and provides a little more bulk with the 96 HP EVs; the remaining EVs are put into Special Attack in order to ensure that Uxie isn't completely useless without any boosts. An alternate EV spread that maximizes HP and Defense along with a Bold nature can be used in order to take hits better while setting up, but the loss of power and Speed is extremely noticeable. Leftovers should be the only option for this set, as Uxie has no other form of recovery, and appreciates any replenished health, no matter how little. Giga Drain is an option over Thunderbolt in order to hit Krookodile and provide a form of pseudo-healing, but its low Base Power and inferior coverage usually isn't worth it.</p> <p>As this set aims to attempt a sweep rather than to support the rest of the team, Uxie actually needs assistance from the team in order to be successful. Teammates that are able to set up entry hazards, the most useful being Toxic Spikes as it can wear down the opponent while Uxie sets up, are extremely useful. Qwilfish is an excellent teammate, as it can set up both Toxic Spikes and Spikes, as well as having the ability Intimidate, and access to useful support moves such as Taunt, Thunder Wave, and Haze. Teammates that can get rid of Krookodile and other Dark-types in general are needed, as the latter are immune to Psychic. Bulky Fighting-types such as Hitmontop, Machamp, Cobalion, and Hariyama fit the bill nicely.</p> "

        "name": "Field Supporter",
        "description": "<p>Field effects such as rain, sun, and Trick Room can be quite devastating if used properly. However, there are currently no Pokemon in UU who can permanently set them up, so teams that rely on these effects require Pokemon who can manually use the move and quickly switch out to an appropriate sweeper. Uxie's movepool, access to U-turn, sheer bulk, and Speed--even when uninvested--therefore makes it a great candidate to set up these moves. Stealth Rock is a major boon towards Uxie's teammates, as it helps them to net vital OHKOs and 2HKOs, which is important considering that they have a limited amount of time before the appropriate field effect disappears. Psychic gives Uxie an attacking option and prevents it from becoming complete Taunt bait. Heal Bell is a viable alternate option, as it further aids teammates by ridding them of status, most notably Toxic, which, when combined with potential entry hazard damage and Life Orb recoil, can wear down sweepers fairly quickly.</p> <p>If Uxie is setting up either rain or sun, then Damp Rock or Heat Rock is a given, as it increases the duration of the respective field effects. Trick Room has no such item, so Uxie should opt to use Leftovers instead. In addition, on a Trick Room team, Uxie should use a Relaxed nature instead of a Bold nature and have 0 IVs in Speed. The EVs are, once again, quite simple, and allow Uxie to live long enough to set up the appropriate field effect several times throughout the match.</p> <p>It is best to have at least one or two other Pokemon on Uxie's team that can set up the same field condition, so your sweepers do not find themselves on limited time. For rain teams, Registeel is a good rain dancer since it loves having its Fire-type weakness reduced. Empoleon is another good dancer, and as a bonus, gains double-STAB on Water-type attacks due to its typing. Cresselia and Arcanine are good Pokemon to set up Sunny Day since they can now recover more health with Moonlight and Morning Sun. As for Trick Room, some good options would be Dusclops, Slowbro, and Cresselia. However, these Pokemon share similar weaknesses with Uxie, so be sure to keep this fact in mind while constructing a Trick Room team. In addition to these Pokemon, Uxie should also be paired up with appropriate sweepers. Rain teams can opt to go with Kingdra, Gorebyss, Kabutops, Ludicolo, and Omastar. Sun teams love to have Sawsbuck, Shaymin, Tangrowth, and Charizard. Common sweepers on Trick Room teams include Escavalier, Rhyperior, Aggron, Slowbro, and Golurk. One important factor to keep in mind is that these Pokemon only have a set amount of turns to sweep, so stall teams and defensive Pokemon may be troublesome. However, rain and sun teams should not have too much of a problem since many of their sweepers gain double STAB on moves, and Trick Room team sweepers often have monstrous strength.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mesprit is the classic example of a \"jack of all trades, master of none.\" At a first glance, Mesprit's good stats and wide movepool might make it seem like a powerful and reliable utility Pokemon. And it is, to a certain extent. The problem with Mesprit is that there's usually another Pokemon that does what it does better. In particular, Mesprit faces stiff competition from three other small and cute Psychic-type fairies: Azelf, Uxie, and Mew. Azelf is far better suited to offense, Uxie is a top-notch defensive Pokemon, and Mew's higher Speed, HP, and nigh limitless movepool make it the superior choice in many occasions.</p> <p>However, Mesprit does have its perks. Its access to Healing Wish and lower Speed than the other Psychic-types make it a fantastic Trick Room supporter. Similarly, a Ground-type immunity, courtesy of Levitate, gives it another way to distinguish itself from Mew, which for the most part runs sets that don't clash with Mesprit's. If you make sure that Mesprit isn't outclassed by its brethren, the little sprite will undoubtedly serve you well.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mesprit has an expansive movepool; unfortunately, when Mesprit differs from the listed sets it tends to become outclassed by other Pokemon. Knock Off is an excellent move in the fifth generation, and can cripple the many Eviolite users such as Dusclops and Gligar. Other sets that Mesprit can use to good effect are those with Choice items and Trick. A Choice Band set with Zen Headbutt, the elemental punches, U-turn, and Trick is often unexpected, but faces competition from other physically oriented Psychic-types such as Medicham or Gallade. Choice Specs is also perfectly viable, with moves such as Psychic or Psyshock, BoltBeam coverage, and Trick. Mesprit can also pull off a dual screens set, but is largely outclassed by Uxie, which also has access to Memento. A Calm Mind set is also an option, but faces stiff competition from Mew. Mesprit's lack of a reliable recovery move apart from Rest also hurts it in this regard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Since Mesprit normally focuses on using special attacks, the big squishy special walls, Snorlax, can take it on without any trouble. Mesprit can use Psyshock to strike at its weaker Defense, but it's often a futile effort, since Snorlax can boost its Defense with Curse. Dark-types are also a threat to Mesprit, since they can trap Mesprit with their STAB Pursuit and remove it from battle. Of these, Weavile and Houndoom are the most dangerous. Finally, Escavalier doesn't care about anything Mesprit can do to it apart from Fire Punch, thanks to its Steel typing and tremendous bulk, and can either remove it with Pursuit or smash it with its STAB Megahorn.</p> ",

With a Quiet nature and no Speed IVs, Mesprit reaches a rubbish 148 Speed, which is enough to outspeed almost the entire metagame under Trick Room. The main attraction of this set is that Mesprit can function well as a stand-alone sweeper, and when it's on its last dregs, it can throw out a Healing Wish, completely restoring a teammate. That's not to say that Mesprit can't also function on a dedicated Trick Room team. Just be careful to make sure that you don't waste too many turns attacking when another Pokemon on your team could be doing a better job.</p> <p>Unlike other Trick Room users, Mesprit does not need to waste a turn switching into hard hitters because it has the capability to do so itself. Psychic is Mesprit's main STAB move, and a powerful one at that. It will always OHKO offensive Roserade, and will nearly always knock out specially defensive versions after Stealth Rock. Thunderbolt is the secondary offensive move on the set, as it provides excellent coverage with Mesprit's STAB Psychic; hitting all but Krookodile, Steelix, and Claydol for at least neutral damage. Healing Wish is what sets Mesprit apart from other Trick Room supporters, since it allows Mesprit to fully restore a teammate to peak performance. If sacrificing Mesprit is undesired, U-turn is a perfectly viable option, allowing for either a fast or a slow scout, depending on whether or not Trick Room is up. Both moves have their merits, but without Healing Wish, Mesprit loses one of its few niches.</p> <p>Mesprit greatly appreciates entry hazard support; although it's a strong Pokemon, it has nowhere near the firepower of other Trick Room supporters. Our little pink friend can set up Stealth Rock by sacrificing a moveslot for it, generally Thunderbolt or Healing Wish. This is usually an inferior choice though, since Mesprit needs as much coverage as it can get, and Healing Wish is a key supporting move. Therefore, a teammate such as Claydol, who can also set up both Trick Room and Stealth Rock, is recommended. An even more colorful option (excuse the pun) is Kecleon, which has low Speed and access to Recover, Trick Room, and Stealth Rock. Mesprit's EV spread is the same as any Trick Room-oriented Pokemon: maximum HP and power, and the lowest Speed possible.</p> <p>Mesprit is walled by a large amount of special walls. Snorlax and Cresselia take very little from Mesprit's attacks and can easily heal off the damage. Fortunately, all of these walls are extremely susceptible to Heracross, which can OHKO all of them with its STAB Close Combat or Megahorn. The icing on the cake is that many of these walls will resort to statusing Mesprit with Toxic, so if Heracross can switch in on it, it will gain a 50% Attack boost courtesy of Guts.</p> "

        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<p>Mesprit can also take on a supporting role. It distinguishes itself from Azelf by not being suicide-oriented, and it differs from Uxie by actually having an offensive presence. This Mesprit set is designed to be able to switch in and counter the vast array of Ground- and Fighting-types that dominate the UU metagame, and set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is mandatory on practically every team. Mesprit is an ideal candidate to set it up, because it possesses great bulk, and thus it can set it up multiple times during a match if need be. Of course, Mesprit isn't limited to just setting up Stealth Rock. Its STAB Psychic can crush many of the common Fighting-types in UU, such as Machamp and Hitmontop, who can't really do much back to Mesprit. It also deters Hitmontop from coming in to spin Stealth Rock away, because once Hitmontop has been KOed, Mesprit can simply set it up again. Grass Knot allows Mesprit to also counter the top Ground-types in Rhyperior and Mamoswine. As long as Mesprit avoids a Megahorn from the former, it can switch in on their Earthquakes, taking no damage thanks to Levitate, and always OHKO the former with Grass Knot, even without Stealth Rock support. In order to OHKO Mamoswine, Mesprit will need Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Ice Beam is also a viable move in order to deal more damage to the lighter Ground-types, such as Flygon and Gligar, none of which can really hurt Mesprit without Toxic. U-turn in the last slot allows Mesprit to gain momentum for its team, and allows it to switch out of predicted Pursuit-using switch-ins without taking damage.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Mesprit to tank powerful physical hits. Since Mesprit acts as a physical wall, having a special counterpart can form a highly effective defensive core. Snorlax can work in such a role, but in a more offensive vein: it can reliably Pursuit and eliminate the powerful special attackers, such as Mismagius, that Mesprit fears.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Mesprit also has the ability to pull off an excellent weather support set. This is particularly effective due to the banning of hail and sand. While it may seem that this set faces stiff competition from Uxie, this is not the case, because Mesprit can use Healing Wish and take advantage of the weather it sets up, thanks to a superior offensive movepool and stats.</p> <p>Mesprit's weather of choice is Rain Dance. This is mainly due to the vast number of powerful Swift Swimmers that reside in the tier, including but certainly not limited to Kingdra, Omastar, Kabutops, and Ludicolo. Rain Dance halves the power of Fire-type moves, effectively giving Mesprit a resistance to them. Water-type moves get a boost as well, meaning that the many Swift Swimmers can abuse their STAB moves to a destructive degree. Another interesting aspect of Rain Dance is that it gives both Thunder and Hurricane 100% accuracy, meaning that Pokemon like Jolteon and Tornadus can also comfortably fit into rain teams. Psychic is Mesprit's STAB move, and thanks to full Special Attack investment, will be hitting most Pokemon that don't resist it hard. Thunder allows Mesprit to abuse the rain itself, and provides excellent coverage with its STAB Psychic; a 30% chance to paralyze the opponent is also very nifty. The last slot allows Mesprit to bring in its teammates to start a sweep of their own. Healing Wish completely restores a teammate to peak performance, which is extremely valuable to rain sweepers, who will quickly get worn down, but can only be used at the cost of Mesprit's life. While U-turn can be used multiple times, Mesprit loses its niche with Healing Wish.</p> <p>Mesprit can just as easily pull off a Sunny Day set (albeit with less power), with maximum Attack EVs, an Adamant nature, Fire Punch, and Zen Headbutt over the maximum Special Attack EVs, Modest Nature, Thunder, and Psychic. The set functions virtually identically, but Mesprit will support Grass- and Fire-types. The Grass-types, such as Sawsbuck or Lilligant, can abuse Chlorophyll, doubling their Speed, and set up with Swords Dance or Quiver Dance, respectively. Fire-type powerhouses, such as Darmanitan, Victini, and Charizard, can abuse their massively powerful Flare Blitzes and Fire Blasts.</p> "

It has a great boosting move in Nasty Plot, as well as outstanding coverage, which allows Azelf to function as a powerful special sweeper. Azelf is also one of the best leads in the UU metagame, as its high Speed and access to useful support moves such as Stealth Rock, Taunt, and Reflect allow it to support its team while still posing a legitimate threat. However, Azelf's low defenses mean that it will often fold to most powerful attacks. Its defensive typing is also very poor, giving it weaknesses to three common attacking types in UU. However, Azelf is still a threat that must not go underestimated.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set could be used for a powerful hit-and-run attacker, but Azelf is very frail, and the prospect of being locked into Psychic against Weavile or other Dark-types is very risky and is typically not recommended. Hidden Power Fighting and Shadow Ball are viable options on the Nasty Plot set, but take away coverage. Substitute eases the need for predictions, but is not recommended because of Azelf's paper-thin defenses and the lack of Pokemon it could set a Substitute up on. A Choice Scarf set consisting of Trick, Explosion, Zen Headbutt, and Ice Punch can be used, but it receives stiff competition from other Choice Scarf users, such as Flygon and Raikou.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Dark-types, especially Weavile and Houndoom, are immune to Azelf's STAB attacks and pack Pursuit and other powerful Dark-type attacks to shut it down.

Yanmega and Sharpedo typically have Speed Boost and Protect, and are able to outspeed Azelf after a single boost and threaten it with STAB Bug Buzz and Crunch, respectively. Snorlax fears nothing but boosted Psyshocks, and has Rest, Whirlwind, Body Slam, and Crunch to shut down Azelf. Porygon2 can weather just about anything but boosted Hidden Power Fighting and can paralyze Azelf, set up Trick Room to use Azelf's Speed against it, or KO with Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, or Tri Attack.

This is because Nasty Plot boosts Azelf's Special Attack, allowing it to break through a lot of threats when backed by its blistering Speed stat. Psychic is the STAB move of choice, as it breaks through anything that doesn't resist it and that doesn't have high special bulk. Fire Blast allows Azelf to get past Steel-type Pokemon such as Registeel and Empoleon, Pokemon that resist Azelf's STAB Psychic and that would otherwise phaze or set up on it. It also helps against Weavile and Bisharp, two of the Dark-type Pokemon that tend to switch in on Psychic. Thunderbolt allows Azelf to muscle past the bulky Water-type Pokemon found in the tier, barring Swampert, and adds decent coverage alongside Psychic and Fire Blast. Thunderbolt is also useful for preventing Azelf from being walled by Houndoom, as it is immune to Psychic and Fire Blast thanks to its typing and ability. If opting for Psyshock over Psychic so that targets such as Snorlax and Porygon2 won't interrupt Azelf's sweep, one should also use Grass Knot over Thunderbolt to ensure that bulky Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Swampert cannot come in, tank Psyshock, and beat Azelf.</p> <p>Psyshock can be used over Psychic to gain more overall damage on special walls such as Snorlax and Porygon2, but it does less damage in most other situations. In the same sense, Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast if the low PP and shaky accuracy is unappealing to you. An Expert Belt can be used over Life Orb if the drop in HP is unfavorable, but its lower damage output will be noticeable, as not every move will get a boost every time it is used. Shadow Ball can be used in order to hit very specific targets such as Xatu or Cofagrigus if your team struggles with them, but really reduces Azelf's coverage options, leaving it even more vulnerable to Dark-type Pokemon such as Krookodile or Houndoom.</p> <p>Azelf greatly wants entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Empoleon and Qwilfish, as they help Azelf get past Focus Sashes, making for easier sweeps. They also weaken opponents, which turns many of Azelf's 2HKOs into OHKOs, such as boosted Thunderbolt against Suicune.

Fire Blast gains super effective coverage on the Steel- and Ice-types found in UU, such as Bronzong or Weavile. Shadow Ball is useful against the array of opposing Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon found throughout the tier, such as Xatu or Cofagrigus. The last slot is based on preference. Stealth Rock is great for team support and damaging opponents as they switch in, U-turn is handy for scouting the opponent and providing your team with momentum, and Grass Knot is handy for punishing heavier Pokemon such as Rhyperior, Swampert, and Golurk, opening holes in the opposing team for Azelf's teammates to take advantage of.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is also highly useful in the fourth slot, as it prevents Houndoom from completely walling Azelf and does considerable damage to the plethora of bulky Water-type Pokemon found in the tier. Psyshock is a valid option over Psychic in order to do more damage against the likes of Porygon2 and Snorlax, but tends to be weaker in most other situations. Azelf is typically better off letting a teammate such as Heracross or Scrafty remove the special walls before it begins tearing the opposing team up.

Stealth Rock is great for general team support, damaging the opponent upon switching in, and breaking any stray Focus Sashes that might delay the sweep of a teammate.</p> <p>Light Clay is used to lengthen the effects of Light Screen and Reflect from 5 turns to 8, giving your team more than enough time to set up and begin sweeping. Jolly should be used with U-turn, but otherwise Timid is better to reduce Foul Play and confusion damage.

Zen Headbutt gains STAB, which will deal decent damage to most of the tier, but being locked into this move can terminate Azelf, as UU has its fair share of Pursuit users, most of which are Dark-types.

Ice Punch hits the handful of Grass- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Shaymin and Gligar for super effective damage, rounding out coverage with Zen Headbutt and Fire Punch.

With a vast support movepool consisting of dual screens, Thunder Wave, Toxic, Trick Room, and of course, its signature move, Lunar Dance, Cresselia can easily flutter its way onto any team. Colossal bulk, as well as a fantastic ability in Levitate, allows Cresselia to reach for the moon, shutting down many prominent UU attackers.

One could even use Cresselia as a \"counter-stallbreaker\" by using Magic Coat to deflect Taunt. Unfortunately, Magic Coat is largely prediction based, and there are more reliable options for preventing status. Charge Beam can be used to boost Cresselia's Special Attack as well, but Calm Mind makes much better use of its bulk. Lunar Dance is an option on just about any set, although it works best on the dual screens set, when Cresselia's survival is unimportant.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Escavalier is the bane of Cresselia's existence. Its typing and above average bulk allow it to shrug off any of Cresselia's attacks with ease, it is unaffected by Toxic, and it doesn't particularly mind Thunder Wave. It can, however, send Cresselia running (floating?) for the hills by virtue of its STAB Megahorn. Similarly, Heracross can also demolish Cresselia with Megahorn, but it must watch out for Psychic itself. Dark-types are immune to Psychic and either smother the lunar being with a powerful STAB move, or strike down a fleeing Cresselia with Pursuit; Weavile, Bisharp, and Houndoom can all send Cresselia running home crying, but the most effective of them all is Spiritomb, who is immune to Hidden Power Fighting as well as Psychic. Speaking of Spiritomb, Ghost-types, such as Mismagius, can also take out Cresselia with a boosted Shadow Ball.</p> <p>At the end of the day, though, Cresselia's defensive stats are unmatched, so it is better to not try brute forcing your way through it. Taunt users can throw a wrench into Cresselia's plans, shutting down not only its means of recovery, but its ability to status dangerous threats as well. Cresselia is excruciatingly difficult to break through with unboosted attacks, but \"unboosted\" is the key word, and Cresselia just screams set-up bait for the likes of ChestoRest Kingdra and Snorlax. Finally, Cresselia can be overwhelmed by constant offensive pressure. If Her Lunar Majesty is not given an opportunity to heal, she will inevitably fall to a flurry of powerful attacks.</p> ",

With access to instant recovery in Moonlight, Cresselia becomes a nearly insurmountable obstacle for these otherwise dangerous threats. Although this set invests primarily in physical bulk, Cresselia's natural special bulk allows it to sponge powerful special attacks as well. Psychic is a decently powerful STAB move to extirpate Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop and Machamp. Beware, though, that Heracross can dig Cresselia a shallow grave with Megahorn. Hidden Power Fighting is the coverage move of choice, as it deals decent damage to Dark-type switch-ins, such as Bisharp, and is also Cresselia's best option against Cobalion. However, Ice Beam eliminates the likes of Flygon. Thunder Wave and Toxic are both excellent options for shutting down opposing offensive Pokemon; Thunder Wave debilitates fast, frail sweepers, whereas Toxic cripples bulky set-up sweepers.</p> <p>Cresselia can opt to run both Thunder Wave and Toxic, but this makes it more difficult to finish off dangerous threats. Cresselia is also greatly hindered by status itself; Toxic, in particular, forces it to switch out. Rest is a viable option to deal with these issues, although current sleep mechanics make this unreliable. Reflect can be used to shut down almost every physical attacker in the tier, although STAB Megahorn will still do a number on Cresselia. Light Screen can also be used to provide insurance against powerful special attackers. Similarly, Cresselia can opt for an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Def with a Calm nature, functioning similarly to other special walls in the tier but with the added benefit of handling many physical threats very well. However, most offensive threats in the metagame are physically oriented, so physical Defense investment is still preferred.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Dark-types are the bane of Cresselia's existence. Ironically, the very Pokemon Cresselia exists to eliminate, Fighting-types, such as Hitmontop, make great teammates, as they can easily beat down those shady characters. While we're on the topic of irony, Dark-types, such as Weavile, also make great teammates for their ability to take out pesky Ghost-types. A powerful Fire-type, such as Rotom-H or Darmanitan can roast powerful Bug-types, such as Heracross and Escavalier, who threaten Cresselia with their powerful Megahorns. Although Cresselia's defensive stats are phenomenal, it can still be overwhelmed by intense offensive pressure. Therefore, it is recommended to pair Cresselia with other sturdy walls, such as Registeel and Milotic, to lessen its workload.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Cresselia has impressive bulk, no doubt, and it certainly makes a great check to a horde of powerful attackers, but Cresselia can easily make use of those titanic defenses to support the team in another manner: dual screens. The lunar maiden can withstand the most savage blows, and should have no problem getting up Reflect and Light Screen. The fact that these moves augment its already impressive defensive stats doesn't hurt either, and Cresselia can easily set up dual screens multiple times throughout the match.</p> <p>Light Clay is the item of choice, as it gives the best mileage out of your screens. Although Leftovers is tempting given Cresselia's fantastic bulk, Cresselia can survive an encounter with even the most powerful of attackers, and those extra three turns of screens are much more beneficial. However, what separates Cresselia from the crowd is its signature move, Lunar Dance. This move sacrifices Cresselia, but in return, heals a teammate to full HP, and cures them of all status ailments. Not only does this give a battered sweeper a second lease of life, it also potentially provides the sweeper with a free set-up opportunity; in essence, Lunar Dance is the ultimate momentum move, and can shift the tides of a game. The last slot is dedicated to an offensive move to ensure Cresselia is not a sitting duck (pun not intended) when Taunted. Psychic is preferred, as it is Cresselia's most powerful move, although Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Dark-type switch-ins.</p> <p>Thunder Wave can be used instead of either Lunar Dance or Psychic, but replacing the former takes away one of Cresselia's greatest assets, while replacing the latter leaves Cresselia prone to Taunt. Moonlight is an option to improve Cresselia's longevity, but realistically, you should be using Lunar Dance on the way out. Leftovers can be used to improve Cresselia's survivability as well, but Cresselia should focus on providing screens for its teammates rather than surviving. The EV spread gives Cresselia the ability to tank hits from both sides, although one could alter the spread based on preference.</p> <p>Although Cresselia is a defensive Pokemon, this set functions best on an offensively oriented team. Dual screens give frail sweepers an easier time setting up, while Lunar Dance could potentially grant them a second opportunity to sweep. Of course, this set is greatly hampered by status, especially Toxic, due to the lack of recovery. One could opt for either a Wish passer or a cleric to keep Cresselia happy. However, as mentioned before, this set works best on high octane offensive teams, so it may be difficult to fit those onto the team. A more feasible option is to pair it with a Pokemon such as Heracross, who can nab an Attack boost from status moves and wreak havoc behind screens.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Although Cresselia's main boon is its bulk, it can still run a Calm Mind set to pose an offensive presence. However, Calm Mind is honestly more useful for driving its Special Defense to untouchable levels. After just one Calm Mind boost, Cresselia becomes a nearly impenetrable fortress, though it needs multiple boosts before it can pose any sort of offensive threat. This set is best used as a stallbreaker, Cresselia can set up massive Substitutes that block status and are incredibly difficult to break for the offensively challenged walls commonly found on stall teams. Psyshock is the preferred STAB move, as Cresselia often has difficulty winning Calm Mind wars due to its unimpressive Special Attack, however Psychic does more immediate and consistent damage in the long run. Hidden Power Fighting is the recommended coverage move, as it hits Dark- and Steel-types, who laugh at Psyshock. Ice Beam can be used to hit Pokemon such as Flygon and Rhyperior harder, but is generally inferior to Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Speed while retaining solid bulk. A more defensive EV spread can be used, but the extra Speed is helpful for speed tying opposing base 85s, most notably Heracross. You could also opt to invest in Special Attack, but Cresselia would need multiple boosts to sweep regardless. Moonlight or Rest can be used in place of Substitute, but the former makes Cresselia prone to status while the latter is unreliable. Due to its lackluster Special Attack, Cresselia has difficulty winning Calm Mind wars, so a powerful physical attacker such as Heracross and Weavile can be used to take them out. Although most Cresselia sets function as team supporters, this set is more selfish so to speak, and functions well as a stand alone sweeper.</p> "

  "Shaymin": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier that is filled with noxious Poison-types, industrial Steel-types, and suffocating Fire-types, the nature-loving Shaymin has its work cut out for it. As a Grass-type, Shaymin is forced to compete against the immensely popular Roserade, who has access to Sleep Powder, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. However, Shaymin has many advantages over its competition and indeed the whole tier. Its signature move Seed Flare has no nasty side effect such as the Special Attack drop associated with Leaf Storm. In fact, Seed Flare has a wonderful side effect of cutting your opponent's Special Defense in half, and has a large chance of doing so. Another way Shaymin differentiates itself from its competition is its access to numerous high-powered special moves such as Psychic and Earth Power. Shaymin also boasts a base 100 stat spread across the board allowing it to take even some super effective hits. However, Shaymin's Grass typing leaves it exposed to common attacking types such as Flying-, Bug-, and Fire-type attacks. Shaymin also has trouble getting past Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, especially since its coverage moves are not amazingly strong. While Shaymin may not have access to Sleep Powder or Spikes like its fellow Grass-type Roserade, its excellent coverage and straight base 100 stats make it a major contender in the UU arena.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shaymin's coverage moves and base 100 stat spread mean that it can effectively use a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs. With a Choice Scarf equipped, Shaymin becomes an excellent revenge killer, being able to outspeed common threats such as Dragon Dance Kingdra and Choice Scarf Togekiss. However, Shaymin's base 100 Special Attack isn't amazing, and its lack of power really shows when Shaymin isn't using a boosting item. However, Choice Specs boosts Shaymin's attacks to terrifying levels, allowing Shaymin to wipe out walls such as Snorlax and Umbreon. Unfortunately, Grass-type attacks are resisted by a whopping 7 types, while Shaymin's main coverage move, Earth Power, has no effect on Flying-types and Levitate users. As Rotom-H, Zapdos, and Venomoth are all big threats to Shaymin, Hidden Power Rock can be used to hit them hard. While it doesn't OHKO them, Shaymin can easily weaken them enough for a teammate to sweep. Shaymin's base 100 Attack stat is just as high as its Special Attack stat, and it can be further boosted with Swords Dance. Unfortunately, a physical attacking Shaymin isn't helped by its meager physical movepool that consists of only Seed Bomb, Zen Headbutt, and Return as viable options. While it is not quite a supporter, Shaymin can be useful to its team in ways besides attacking. With Aromatherapy, Shaymin can heal its teammates from untimely switch-ins to status attacks (stray Thunder Waves and Scald burns come to mind). Healing Wish augments this function by allowing Shaymin to fully heal a chosen teammate's HP and status ailments at the cost of its own life. This is useful once Shaymin depletes Seed Flare's PP or is otherwise no longer useful in battle. Do keep in mind that Healing Wish takes effect before the incoming teammate suffers damage from entry hazards; this gives dangerous Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon, such as Darmanitan, a second chance to rip the enemy team apart!</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although Shaymin can cover almost every UU threat with its expansive special movepool, it cannot run all its coverage moves at once. Depending on what coverage moves it runs, there are different Pokemon that can counter Shaymin. If Shaymin runs Psychic, Pokemon like Honchkrow can check Shaymin, only fearing repeated Seed Flares. If Hidden Power Ice is used, then Bronzong, Escavalier, and Heracross become excellent switch-ins to Shaymin. The latter two are especially dangerous as they can impale Shaymin with a powerful STAB Megahorn. Using Air Slash leaves Shaymin open to bulky Flying-types, such as Zapdos and Togekiss, who can either set up on Shaymin or just annihilate it with a super effective attack. The biggest counters to Shaymin are specially defensive Zapdos, Togekiss, and Rotom-H as they can sponge even super effective Hidden Powers and hit Shaymin super effectively. However, all three of these counters are weak to Stealth Rock, so their ability to wall Shaymin will be extremely restricted after numerous switch ins. Popular special walls, such as Snorlax and Umbreon, are also good checks to Shaymin by virtue of their immense special bulk. However, they are shaky counters at best as they lose if Shaymin achieves a Special Defense drop with Seed Flare. They are both also very susceptible to the SubSeed set as their large HP stats provide ample recovery for Shaymin and its teammates. Another way to beat Shaymin is to revenge kill it and prey on its numerous weaknesses to common attacking types. Choice Scarf users such as Victini and Darmanitan can outspeed and OHKO Shaymin with powerful STAB attacks; however, they will be severely weakened if not OHKOed if they switch into Earth Power. Yanmega fears Hidden Power Ice and Air Slash, but can outspeed Shaymin after Speed Boost activates and OHKOes with a Life Orb-boosted Bug Buzz. Although Shaymin normally views Suicune, Slowbro, and Rhyperior as excellent switch in opportunities, they can also deal heavy damage to Shaymin with Ice Beam, Fire Blast, and Megahorn, respectively.</p> ",

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>A Life Orb set makes the most of Shaymin's unique coverage and powerful STAB attack. Although its base 100 Special Attack isn't amazing, it is more than adequate, especially with such a powerful signature move. With its resistances to common Water-, Ground-, and Grass-type attacks, Shaymin finds many opportunities to switch in and unleash its powerful attacks. Seed Flare is Shaymin's STAB move of choice; not only does it have the same Base Power as moves such as Hydro Pump and Thunder, it also comes with a secondary effect that sends shivers down the spines of walls. The 40% chance to halve your opponent's Special Defense lets Shaymin get past even the bulkiest of walls like Snorlax and Umbreon. Earth Power allows Shaymin to hit the Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types that resist Seed Flare; otherwise, excellent Shaymin switch-ins such as Victini and Cobalion are swiftly removed with correct prediction. Psychic patches up Shaymin's coverage, especially against threats like Crobat and Heracross who both resist or are immune to Seed Flare and Earth Power. Psychic is also the strongest move Shaymin has to hit the omnipresent Roserade. However, Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Flying- and Dragon-types, such as Zapdos, Togekiss, and Flygon, super effectively; while Air Slash deals with Grass-types, such as opposing Shaymin, and has a chance to flinch the opponent. As Shaymin can already hit most of UU with just three moves, it can opt to use a support move in the last slot. Synthesis and Rest both provide Shaymin with a means of restoring HP lost to entry hazards, Life Orb, and stray hits Shaymin is forced to take. Synthesis is a reliable recovery move that grants Shaymin 50% of its HP back with every use, but Rest is a viable alternative as it fully restores Shaymin's HP and removes status. Upon switching out, Shaymin can remove its sleep condition thanks to Natural Cure. Although this Shaymin is being used in an offensive manner, keep in mind that it still has excellent 100 / 100 / 100 defenses which let it take even weak super effective hits if need be, and retaliate with its powerful Life Orb-boosted assaults.</p> <p>Shaymin's Speed is maximized and a Timid nature is used to ensure that Shaymin can at least Speed tie with other Pokemon with base 100 Speed such as Victini. Special Attack is also maximized to allow Shaymin to hit as hard as possible. Even with maximum investment, base 100 Special Attack can only go so far in a tier where attacking stats over 140 are commonplace; to help boost Shaymin's power, a Life Orb should always be used as the item. Although the health gained back from an item such as Leftovers is appealing, without a power boost, Shaymin is too weak to be a threat to most teams. Although the listed moves give Shaymin the best coverage, there are other move options that are viable. Hidden Power Fire incinerates Escavalier and does excellent damage to Bronzong, especially after a Special Defense drop from Seed Flare. It also obtains coverage on Bug- and Grass-types which resist Seed Flare. Leech Seed can act as a more offensive way for Shaymin to regain health, and is especially useful against bulky walls, such as Snorlax and Umbreon, who normally have high HP stats for Shaymin to take advantage of.</p> <p>As Shaymin is a Grass-type, it fits in well on standard Fire / Water / Grass cores, where its teammates can cover its weaknesses. Water- and Fire-types like Slowbro and Victini can take Fire-, Ice-, and Bug-type attacks for Shaymin. In return, Shaymin sponges Water- and Grass-type assaults. A Rock- or Steel-type, such as Rhyperior and Registeel, can take Flying-type attacks for Shaymin, and they can also set up Stealth Rock, which helps Shaymin against Pokemon such as Togekiss and Zapdos.</p> "

        "name": "Leech Seed",
        "description": "<p>Shaymin can also use a classic strategy in SubSeed to continuously weaken the opponent and restore Shaymin's health. However, Shaymin's excellent offensive presence compared to Pokemon like Whimsicott means that it can run a viable offensive Leech Seed set. While most SubSeed users are dependent on Leech Seed to do damage, Shaymin wields a powerful Seed Flare that can slice through most of the metagame and forces numerous switches for Shaymin to take advantage of. Leech Seed saps the HP from common walls such as Snorlax who often switch into Shaymin; their high HP stats mean that Shaymin and its teammates can potentially recover a lot of health. As Grass-types wall the SubSeed combination as well as resist Seed Flare, Shaymin must use a coverage move to prevent itself from being walled. Psychic hits the most common Grass-type, Roserade, hard, while also taking down common switch-ins to Shaymin, such as Crobat. Air Slash and Hidden Power Ice allow Shaymin to still hit Roserade without being totally helpless against opposing Shaymin. Protect can be used instead of Substitute as it helps Shaymin safely steal more of the opponent's health with Leech Seed, as well as make proper predictions against Choice item users significantly easier. However, be careful when using Protect, as it gives your opponent an opportunity to set up a Substitute or use boosting moves.</p> <p>Although this Shaymin works by using Leech Seed followed Protect or Substitute, it still invests fully in offenses. Shaymin's excellent base 100 Special Attack and Speed stats distinguish it from other SubSeed users, such as Whimsicott and Tangrowth, who don't hit as hard. However, an alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe keeps Shaymin's Speed while maximizing bulk. A Timid nature lets Shaymin keep up with the important base 100 Speed tier which includes dangerous threats such as Flygon and Victini. The choice of item on this set largely depends on how you want to use Shaymin; Leftovers lets Shaymin stall almost infinitely with Leech Seed and Substitute, gradually sapping away the opponent's health. On the other hand, Life Orb is more useful if you want Shaymin to be more offensive and instead use Leech Seed recovery to offset Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>The best teammates for Shaymin are those that can cover its numerous weaknesses. A Water- and Fire-type are great teammates for Shaymin as they have excellent synergy together. Pokemon such as Empoleon, Slowbro, Victini, and Arcanine are all noteworthy options. Entry hazards also benefit Shaymin greatly, as Leech Seed forces many switches. Registeel and Gligar can both set up Stealth Rock, while Qwilfish can set up Spikes. Toxic Spikes are also useful as they help Shaymin stall. Leech Seed and poison damage will quickly take its toll on the opponent's team.</p> "

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>V-create's comically high-Base Power augmented by Victini's good stats across the board, ability to pivot, and access to Bolt Strike to hit Water-type switch-ins make Victini the single most potent physical attacker in the metagame. Moreover, with a wide special attacking movepool, Victini also has the capability to run mixed and even fully special attacking sets, letting it pick and choose its counters at will and lending it a dangerous air of unpredictability. Access to Trick further complicates matters, as a wrong prediction will often lead to one of Victini's already limited counterplay options being crippled for the rest of the match. Victini also boasts useful resistances to Fighting-, Grass-, and Steel-type attacks, allowing it to come in freely from full on a myriad of common threats such as Bronzong and Roserade. Despite this, Victini's greatest strengths can prove to be quite double-edged. V-create's stat drops can be quite lethal if it is used too recklessly, leaving Victini vulnerable to being revenge killed by threats it would normally outpace with ease such as Nidoqueen and Choice Scarf Heracross. Victini's middling Speed means that it can often be revenge killed by faster attackers such as Tornadus, Raikou, Mienshao, and Choice Scarf Flygon depending on its choice of set. Victini's weaknesses to common Ground-, Water-, and Rock-type attacks can be problematic for getting it in. Additionally, its weakness to Dark-type attacks leaves it vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped by the likes of Snorlax and Weavile. Lastly, Victini's weakness to entry hazards limits its longevity and opportunities to switch in, leaving it reliant on spinners like Blastoise and the rare Hitmontop.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Specs can be used for more upfront power with no recoil on fully specially offensive sets, but its reliability can be quite suspect, as it is entirely reliant on your ability to predict effectively. Life Orb is an option on the mixed set to fully maximize power, but Victini is already susceptible to residual damage as is, and it also is a strict disadvantage if predictions are missed. Will-O-Wisp effectively cripples counterplay options such as Snorlax, Rhyperior, and non-Refresh Blastoise, but the move's low accuracy can make it risky. Sleep Talk can be used on either Choice item set to absorb sleep but only offers the mildest of situational use. Final Gambit on Choice Scarf sets with maximum HP and Speed investment can be used to functionally almost guarantee a revenge kill or trade, but it jeopardizes Victini's offensive capabilities otherwise. Glaciate can be used on the mixed set to OHKO Flygon outright and have a high chance to do so to Gligar after Stealth Rock, but it doesn’t have much utility outside of that.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Snorlax: Snorlax is the tier’s most reliable Victini answer, able to take most hits with ease from full thanks to its high defensive stats in conjunction with Thick Fat and potentially Pursuit trap it.

Furthermore, they are also susceptible to being turned into momentum drains, giving Victini's teammates favorable positions either through a double switch or U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Druddigon, Kingdra, and Flygon can all take on physical variants of Victini to varying degrees but are still vulnerable to being worn down over time or outright taken out by variants running special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Choice Scarf Mienshao and Choice Scarf Raikou can reliably offensively check all Victini variants. Victini's Speed tier also renders it vulnerable to a plethora of attackers such as Weavile and Mismagius if it has used V-create or is not running Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Victini's lack of reliable recovery and weakness to entry hazards give it limited chances to switch in if Stealth Rock or Spikes go up early.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Pursuit trapping from the likes of Weavile, Houndoom, and Choice Scarf Krookodile can potentially remove Victini from the game entirely, especially if it has used V-create.</p> ",

Grass Knot covers most Fire-resistant foes, such as Rock- and Water-types in Rhyperior and Blastoise. U-turn takes advantage of the threat of Victini to get teammates like Rotom-C in freely.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although her offensive movepool is quite shallow, Lilligant has a few neat niche support options. The main one is Aromatherapy, which can aid in setting up against walls, but Lum Berry already covers that and mono-Grass is terrible coverage, not to mention that Shaymin and Roserade fill the post of cleric support much better. Healing Wish is a rare move that Lilligant has access to, having the ability to give a teammate a second chance. Lastly, a set consisting of Sunny Day, Sleep Powder, Leaf Storm or Solar Beam, and Hidden Power Rock, Fire, or Ice holding a Heat Rock is viable as an offensive sun setter for sun teams. There honestly is little left in Lilligant's shallow movepool that could hold any possible use.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Lilligant has quite a few good countermeasures. RestTalk Snorlax is perhaps the premier counter, taking little damage even from a boosted Petal Dance and phazing Lilligant out with Whirlwind or exploiting its low Defense stat with Return. Crobat is a decent check, boasting a 4x resistance to Lilligant's STAB, but must watch out for Hidden Power Rock, being OHKOed after a single Quiver Dance. Priority from the likes of Hitmontop and Bisharp is a great way to prey on Lilligant's low defenses. Choice Scarf Krookodile, Mienshao, Darmanitan, and Victini can all revenge kill +1 Lilligant. Honchkrow can switch in on Lilligant's STAB and KO with Brave Bird. Other counters depend on the Hidden Power of choice. If Lilligant lacks Hidden Power Rock, Fire-types, such as Arcanine, Victini, and Darmanitan, as well as Flying-types, such as Zapdos and Togekiss, do well against her. If she lacks Hidden Power Fire, Escavalier, Registeel, Heracross, and Cobalion do well against her. One must never let Lilligant obtain many boosts, however, as with them these counters are all but insignificant little pests to the monstrous flower that is Lilligant.</p> ",

        "name": "Quiver Dance",
        "description": "<p>Meet Quiver Dance Lilligant, the flower that could be. Speaking of Quiver Dance, the move is simply amazing, boosting Lilligant's two best stats and bolstering her mediocre Special Defense to acceptable levels. After a Quiver Dance or two and with her counters removed, there's no question that she can pull off a sweep. Sleep Powder helps with setting up, as incapacitating a foe gives her a free turn to set up or, if something that can counter her is still alive, bring in the appropriate teammate for free. The ease with which Lilligant can set up means that she is one of the few of the large group of frail setup sweepers that can actually switch in instead of coming in from a slow U-turn or after sacking something.</p> <p>Both of Lilligant's STAB choices have their own advantages and disadvantages, so the decision must be carefully made. Giga Drain is preferred due to its decent power and that it actually heals Lilligant every time it is used. It also lacks a lock-in, giving Lilligant the freedom to put something to sleep, set up some more, hit a resist with Hidden Power, or switch to a teammate if she cannot handle an opposing Pokemon. However, although being locked into a Grass-type move is not exactly preferable, the additional power from Petal Dance is helpful against certain Pokemon, and Lilligant will not be confused afterwards due to Own Tempo. Here are some calculations that help demonstrate the uses of the additional power provided by Petal Dance, assuming one boost, a Modest nature, and a Life Orb:</p> <ul> <li>+1 Petal Dance vs. 4/0 Zapdos 63.6% - 74.8%</li> <li>+1 Petal Dance vs. 4/0 Arcanine 70.1% - 82.2%</li> <li>+1 Petal Dance vs. 4/0 Cobalion 75.2% - 88.5%</li> <li>+1 Petal Dance vs. 4/0 Heracross 64.6% - 75.8%</li> <li>+1 Petal Dance vs. 252/252+ Umbreon 56.6% - 67%</li> <li>+1 Petal Dance vs. 252/0 Bronzong 48.2% - 56.8%</li> </ul> <p>The last thing to worry about as far as moveset is concerned is Hidden Power. The Hidden Power choice should be tailored to what support Lilligant has. Hidden Power Rock is by far preferred to hit Darmanitan, Victini, Zapdos, Crobat, and Arcanine. It might be helpful to use Petal Dance in conjunction, as Steel-types will have trouble taking boosted Petal Dances provided Stealth Rock is on the field, and Grass + Rock coverage sadly misses out on hitting Steel-types. Hidden Power Rock hits Zapdos and Togekiss in particular, which take little from Petal Dance. Hidden Power Fire is another option that may be used to hit Bronzong, Heracross, Roserade, Shaymin, Cobalion, and Bisharp hard, especially without any sort of boost.</p> <p>The EVs are quite simple, with max Speed allowing Lilligant to tie with Roserade and max Special Attack for the highest possible damage output. Alternatively, the Speed EVs can be dropped to 224, enough to outspeed Rotom-H, which should be considered particularly if running Hidden Power Rock, as then Lilligant has trouble doing very much damage to Roserade without numerous boosts. The remaining 32 EVs should be placed in either HP or Special Defense in this case. A Modest nature is by far preferable for the additional damage output, but a Timid nature may be used to outspeed max Speed Roserade as well as most Yanmega, Adamant Victini, and Modest Shaymin.</p> <p>The choice of item is quite simple: either sustained extra power from Life Orb or a one-time save from status with Lum Berry. While the additional power from Life Orb is by far preferred, Lum Berry means that Lilligant gets a free pass against paralysis and Toxic Spikes. As far as abilities are concerned, Chlorophyll is useful if Lilligant is on a sun team or to beat opposing sun, but Own Tempo is useful in its own right for preventing confusion from Petal Dance. The only other move option that should be considered is Hidden Power Ice, which is like a semi-hybrid of Hidden Power Rock and Fire in that it hits Flying-types like the former and Grass-types like the latter, as well as hitting Flygon and OHKOing Gligar without any boosts. Due to Lilligant's rather desolate movepool, there is little else that could possibly be run.</p> <p>As Lilligant will always miss out on a few Pokemon due to having to pick between Hidden Powers, proper support to remove these threats is needed. If lacking Hidden Power Rock, a Pokemon like Aerodactyl to remove Flying-types and a Water-type, such as Kingdra or Blastoise, to remove Fire-types should be considered. If lacking Hidden Power Fire, Magneton, Darmanitan, or Victini should be considered to remove Steel-types. Entry hazards are vital to Lilligant's success, putting many targets into KO range and wearing down her counters. Scolipede and Qwilfish can set up Spikes and Cobalion, which has excellent type synergy with Lilligant, can set up Stealth Rock. Sun support is helpful due to Chlorophyll doubling Lilligant's Speed under it; Arcanine and Uxie are the best choices for the job. Fire-types resist all of Lilligant's main weaknesses, so bulkier Fire-types such as Victini and Arcanine make great partners. Lilligant definitely needs some key support to work, but carrying the right support makes Lilligant a very dangerous sweeper and an excellent addition to any team.</p> "

  "Darmanitan": {
    "overview": "<p>Darmanitan is one of the strongest Pokemon in the UU metagame, boasting not only a giant base 140 Attack stat but also a Sheer Force boost on many powerful moves. It resides in a good Speed tier, comfortably ahead of notable Pokemon such as Heracross, Roserade, Krookodile, and Adamant Arcanine. However, Darmanitan suffers from a weakness to Stealth Rock, and its most powerful move, Flare Blitz, deals heavy recoil damage. Furthermore, its frailty, weakness to common attacking types, and lack of good resistances means it's hard to switch Darmanitan into battle. Its sweeps are impeded by a few Pokemon that can switch in without care and take any hit from it, and many of those Pokemon can even heal to prevent gradual weakening. Even so, Darmanitan has one of the most powerful attacks in the game and is definitely a force for which one should prepare.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Darmanitan only has a couple effective sets, it has a huge movepool. Encore can lock defensive Pokemon into a support move and prevent them from walling Darmanitan. Yawn can cripple a potential counter and possibly remove it from the battle due to the resetting sleep mechanics. Will-O-Wisp can ruin physical attackers that might switch into Darmanitan, such as Rhyperior and Swampert. Darmanitan can try a Substitute + Focus Punch set, but it lacks the power of its other sets. Belly Drum is very risky, but also very powerful, and it can turn Darmanitan into a powerful sweeper. Zen Mode is an interesting gimmick, but the low Speed makes it very bad.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Slowbro is the number one counter to Darmanitan as it resists Darmanitan's STAB and takes almost no damage from any of its coverage moves once Regenerator is taken into account. Slowking works similarly, but its lower Defense stat means it'll be forced to use Slack Off more often. Suicune and Milotic are two other defensive Water-types that can take hits from Darmanitan with relative ease. However, Suicune lacks a reliable recovery move, which means that it will eventually resort to using Rest. Similarly, Swampert can switch into Darmanitan a finite number of times before entry hazards and U-turn wear it down to Flare Blitz's KO range. Rhyperior also resists Darmanitan's Fire-type moves, and can take a hit from Superpower and/or Earthquake thanks to Solid Rock and its huge Defense stat. Flygon can always serve as a good check to Darmanitan, as it will never be OHKOed by any of Darmanitan's moves (barring a critical hit or prior damage), outspeeds, and OHKOes with its STAB Earthquake. Due to the huge threat Darmanitan poses to nearly every team, it's always a good idea to pack at least one Pokemon that can revenge kill it. Azumarill can do so with its STAB Aqua Jet, while common Choice Scarf users, such as Mienshao, can simply outspeed and OHKO.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is by far Darmanitan's most dangerous set. Its massive Attack stat combined with Sheer Force and Life Orb boosts rips through slower teams. Flare Blitz is Darmanitan's power move. It deals massive damage even to Pokemon with a Fire-type resistance and plows through any Pokemon without one. Rock Slide gets acceptable coverage beside Flare Blitz, hitting opposing Fire-types for super effective damage. With the Sheer Force boost, Rock Slide is almost as powerful as Earthquake and Stone Edge, and because it gets the Sheer Force boost, Darmanitan will not take recoil damage from Life Orb when using it. This reduces the passive damage Darmanitan takes, as well as allowing it to bluff a Choice set. Superpower rounds off Darmanitan's coverage by hitting Rock-types, such as Rhyperior, as well as bulky Normal-types such as Snorlax and Porygon2. U-turn allows Darmanitan to keep momentum by switching out of hard counters, while also dealing super effective damage to Slowbro, who could easily switch in otherwise.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Darmanitan the highest possible Speed and power, while preventing Download Pokemon from grabbing a Special Attack boost. A Jolly nature makes Darmanitan faster than many important Pokemon, such as Adamant Arcanine, Timid Roserade, Porygon-Z, and Swords Dance Heracross. However, an Adamant nature increases Darmanitan's already monstrous Attack and makes it even more difficult for Pokemon to switch into it. Earthquake can be used over Rock Slide as it still hits Fire-types for super effective damage and allows Darmanitan to hit Rock-types hard without lowering its stats unlike Superpower. Fire Punch can be used as a STAB move without recoil, but it is significantly weaker than Flare Blitz. Darmanitan can use Choice Band instead of Life Orb, but the extra power generally isn't worth the inability to switch moves. Darmanitan should be paired with a Pokemon that beats the bulky Water-types that wall it. Roserade beats almost every bulky Water-type one-on-one and even provides Spikes support to help Darmanitan break the opponent's team. Raikou and Zapdos threaten bulky Water-types as well and can force them out, providing an opportunity to sweep or start blasting the opponent's team with powerful Electric-type attacks. If your team lacks the offensive pressure to keep Stealth Rock off the field, a Rapid Spin user is necessary to keep Darmanitan from losing a quarter of its health just from switching into battle. Blastoise is arguably the best spinner, and Xatu can bounce Stealth Rock back with Magic Bounce.</p> "

Flare Blitz is incredibly powerful with a Sheer Force boost added to its already high Base Power, and offensive teams often lack a good switch-in to it. U-turn allows Darmanitan to keep momentum on its side and does decent damage to Slowbro, who would otherwise be a great switch-in to Darmanitan. Rock Slide gets decent coverage beside Flare Blitz, hitting for super effective damage on both Fire-types that resist Flare Blitz and Flying-types without inflicting recoil damage. Earthquake gets even better coverage with Flare Blitz, as it hits both Rock-types and Fire-types that resist Darmanitan's Fire-type STAB for super effective damage. Superpower also hits Rock-types hard and comes with the benefit of breaking bulky Normal-types such as Snorlax and Porygon2. Fire Punch can be used alongside Earthquake as a reliable STAB without recoil. However, Darmanitan then lacks a reliable way to beat Snorlax.</p> <p>The EVs for this set maximize Darmanitan's offensive power, while giving Download Pokemon, such as Porygon2 and Porygon-Z, a less favorable Attack boost. A Jolly nature is very important, as it allows Darmanitan to outspeed Choice Scarf Heracross, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. However, an Adamant nature does increase Darmanitan's monstrous power even more, and is worth a mention. Choice Scarf Darmanitan runs through offensive teams, so it appreciates Pokemon that can break defensive teams. Swords Dance Heracross, defensive Nasty Plot Togekiss, and Mew can all set up and break through defensive teams. Rapid Spin support is needed if your team cannot keep Stealth Rock off the field. As the best spinner, Blastoise makes a great teammate, or Xatu can be used to keep hazards off the field with Magic Bounce. Darmanitan can break through teams easier with hazards and appreciates Spikes in particular, as its counters are generally grounded. Roserade not only sets Spikes but also handles bulky Water-types that would otherwise counter Darmanitan.</p> "

  "Scrafty": {
    "overview": "<p>Scrafty stands out as the only fully evolved Pokemon with a Dark / Fighting typing, meaning it gets neutral coverage against everything in UU bar Heracross with its STAB moves alone. In addition to this, it gets two useful abilities, Shed Skin and Moxie, with the former preventing status moves such as Will-O-Wisp from crippling it and the latter allowing it to gain extra Attack boosts easily. With 65 / 115 / 115 defenses, it can also set up Dragon Dance or Bulk Up easily. However, don't think Scrafty doesn't have any flaws. Its base 90 Attack leaves much to be desired, making its damage output low without any Attack boosts. Its base 58 Speed doesn't make this any better, as this leaves it prone to fast Pokemon such as Crobat and Choice Scarf Heracross. However, despite these flaws Scrafty is a very threatening sweeper that every team should be prepared for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Besides what's already listed, Scrafty does not have many other viable options. Stone Edge is notable for doing more damage to Crobat on the switch than Ice Punch or Zen Headbutt, and also does more damage to all other Flying-types bar Gligar. Head Smash always OHKOes Crobat after Stealth Rock, something Stone Edge doesn't always do, even with Stealth Rock. However, Head Smash's recoil means it hurts Scrafty more than it helps it. Taunt prevents Roar users such as Suicune from phazing Scrafty and also blocks status moves, although it is not good coverage-wise. Substitute is an option to allow it to set up on Dragon Tail users such as Blastoise and Milotic, although these Pokemon may instead use Roar or Haze, respectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Crobat is your best bet at taking care of Scrafty. Assuming Crobat's standard 176 HP EV spread, it can switch in on any of Scrafty's unboosted attacks, including Ice Punch and Zen Headbutt, outspeed even after Scrafty has used one Dragon Dance and scare it off with Brave Bird. To top it off, Crobat can even use Roost to recover from damage taken while switching in on Scrafty's attacks. If Scrafty does not use Ice Punch, Gligar walls it to no end thanks to its massive Defense with Eviolite, its resistance to High Jump Kick, and its neutrality to Crunch. RestTalk Suicune can force Scrafty out with Roar, but be aware that Suicune will likely take massive damage from a +1 High Jump Kick in the process. Intimidate Hitmontop can take Scrafty's High Jump Kick as well as any of its other moves and retaliate with Close Combat.</p> <p>Due to its meager base 58 Speed, Scrafty is outsped by any viable Choice Scarf user, making it easy to revenge kill. Heracross and Mienshao are both notable for this due to their Fighting-type STAB moves to use against it, and Choice Scarf Mienshao outspeeds Scrafty even after it has used Dragon Dance twice. Pokemon such as Weavile and Crobat outspeed a boosted Scrafty even without a Choice Scarf, although Weavile cannot safely switch in on Scrafty and none of Weavile's Fighting-type attacks will KO Scrafty without it being weakened first.</p> ",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>With such a low Speed stat, it is only natural that a Dragon Dance set would be considered. With one Dragon Dance boost, Scrafty hits 354 Speed, which allows it to outspeed threats such as Cobalion, Mienshao, and Zapdos, which otherwise it wouldn't be able to. High Jump Kick is the preferred Fighting-type STAB move, as it will deal a lot of damage to anything that doesn't resist it after a Dragon Dance boost; however, Drain Punch is more reliable and provides some healing. Crunch is used in order to get past the Ghost- and Psychic-types who resist High Jump Kick and Drain Punch, and also allows it to hit almost every Pokemon in UU for at least neutral damage. For the last move, Ice Punch hits Zapdos and Gligar for super effective damage, while Zen Headbutt can be used to hit Heracross on the switch. It is worth noting that either move will also deal heavy damage to Crobat.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Scrafty should always use as much Attack and Speed as possible, with the leftover EVs placed into Special Defense in order to prevent Download users from gaining a Special Attack boost. It should also always use a Jolly nature, as otherwise at +1 it would lose out on outspeeding Cobalion, Mienshao, and Zapdos. If Moxie is used as the ability, Lum Berry is the preferred item choice, as this gives it a one-time insurance policy against any status move, especially Will-O-Wisp. However, if using Shed Skin as the ability, Life Orb should be used in order to increase Scrafty's damage output. An advantage to using Shed Skin is that it works however many times you want it to, albeit slightly unreliably, while Lum Berry only works once.</p> <p>Although Dragon Dance boosts its subpar Speed to a respectable level, there are still a handful of Pokemon that outspeed Scrafty after it has used Dragon Dance. The most notable examples are Crobat and Choice Scarf Heracross. Gligar walls Heracross thanks to its massive bulk with Eviolite and resistance to both of its STAB moves, and can also support Scrafty's team further by providing Stealth Rock support. Gligar also sponges any hit from Crobat, although it cannot do much back. Zapdos is another great choice for a partner due to its resistance to Brave Bird, allowing it to take down Crobat with Thunderbolt, and it also serves as a decent check to Heracross if necessary. Because many Fighting-type attacks will be aimed at Scrafty, using a Ghost-type Pokemon on your team, such as Cofagrigus or Mismagius, is a good idea in order to switch in on these attacks.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>Scrafty has access to another boosting move as well: Bulk Up. By utilizing Bulk Up, Scrafty sponges any non-super effective move with ease and can simultaneously deal lots of damage in return. In fact, with two Bulk Up boosts, it can even take a Life Orb-boosted High Jump Kick from Mienshao, a testament to how bulky it is. To add on to this, Scrafty boasts nearly unresisted STAB coverage, giving it a huge advantage over other users of Bulk Up. However, Shed Skin truly is Bulk Up Scrafty's ace in the hole. With Shed Skin, it gains a chance of waking up from Rest early, reducing the consequences of using the move. For its STAB moves, Drain Punch is used instead of High Jump Kick because survivability is preferred over power on this set, and Crunch allows it to cover Pokemon such as Mismagius and Slowbro.</p> <p>The given EV spread is intended to improve Scrafty's Special Defense, allowing it to take special attacks. If your team does not need the additional coverage from Crunch, Dragon Tail is an option to allow Scrafty to phaze, giving it the ability to rack up entry hazard damage on the opponent. If Dragon Tail is used, an EV spread of 252 HP / 232 SpD / 24 Spe gives Scrafty just enough Speed to prevent Swampert from phazing it out.</p> <p>Although Bulk Up improves Scrafty's physical bulk considerably, Mienshao can still OHKO it with High Jump Kick after a single Bulk Up boost, and any Heracross deals heavy damage to it with Close Combat while resisting both Drain Punch and Crunch. Gligar works as a teammate, as it walls Heracross, while Slowbro is another good teammate that can handle Mienshao. Ghost-types can also switch in on the Fighting-type attacks that scare off Scrafty, so Pokemon such as Cofagrigus are also good teammates here.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Scrafty is most commonly seen as a setup sweeper, but it can take a more unconventional route with a Choice Band set. This variant of Scrafty is capable of hitting hard right off the bat and using its solid bulk, decent defensive typing, and Intimidate to good use, which opens up more switch-in opportunities for Scrafty. Another perk that makes this set worthwhile is that it can lure in phazers, such as Blastoise and Swampert, and traditional checks to Scrafty, such as Crobat and Heracross, and damage them heavily. High Jump Kick is the main attack used, as it is Scrafty's strongest STAB attack, and with a Choice Band boost, it is capable of 2HKOing defensive Swampert as well as OHKOing standard Kingdra. Crunch is a secondary STAB that hits opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types that brush off High Jump Kick such as Cofagrigus and Slowbro, respectively. In the third slot, Scrafty can opt for Ice Punch, hitting Gligar for major damage while also covering other Flying-types. However, Stone Edge is a good alternative that maintains coverage on Flying-types and can nab KOs on offensive Zapdos as well as stallbreaker Crobat. In the last slot, Drain Punch is preferred, as it is a reliable STAB for when Scrafty can't afford to miss and provides a way to recover lost health. Zen Headbutt is another alternative that allows Scrafty to hit Poison-types and Heracross, which resists Scrafty's STABs.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Scrafty's Attack while allowing it to outspeed minimum Speed base 60s, such as Swampert and Porygon2. The rest of the EVs are invested in bulk, with four placed in Special Defense to prevent Porygon2 and Porygon-Z from getting a Special Attack boost from Download. While neither of them want to switch into Scrafty, it is better to not give them that boost so they don't become big threats when Scrafty is locked into an unfavorable move in Porygon2's case, or low on health in Porygon-Z's case. An Adamant nature is needed on this variant of Scrafty, seeing as it gains valuable KOs with the nature, such as against Heracross with Zen Headbutt and Crobat with Stone Edge. Intimidate is the preferred ability because it gives a nice buffer against physical attacks. Neither Moxie nor Shed Skin is as beneficial as Intimidate on this variant of Scrafty, as it is too slow to take advantage of Moxie boosts and while Shed Skin heals Scrafty of deliberating status, Intimidate is generally more useful overall, considering that it allows Scrafty to come into physical attackers with more ease. An alternative spread of 32 HP / 252 Atk / 224 Spe allows Scrafty to outspeed and 2HKO Gligar switch-ins with Ice Punch before they can Roost; however, this drastically reduces Scrafty's bulk, lowering its longevity and switch-in opportunities. Head Smash is an option over Ice Punch and Stone Edge, as it allows Scrafty to OHKO Togekiss and physically defensive Zapdos after Stealth Rock, but the heavy recoil is undesirable.</p> <p>Scrafty really appreciates entry hazard support, given that even with a Choice Band, it sometimes lacks the raw power to muscle past some defensive Pokemon. With Stealth Rock on the opposing side, Scrafty can OHKO SubRoost Zapdos with Stone Edge and guarantee an OHKO on Heracross with Zen Headbutt. With Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, Qwilfish is 2HKOed by Zen Headbutt, and offensive Trick Room Cofagrigus is OHKOed by Crunch. Rhyperior makes for a great partner, being able to set up Stealth Rock and combat Togekiss. Qwilfish is another great partner, being able to lure in Psychic-type attacks, a Fighting resistance for Scrafty, and set up layers of Spikes. Pokemon that appreciate physical walls such as Slowbro, Cofagrigus, and Golurk removed make excellent partners for Scrafty. Several examples are Choice Scarf Mienshao, Heracross, and Darmanitan. In general, any Pokemon that appreciates the elimination of bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types is an excellent partner with Scrafty. Raikou and Zapdos make fantastic partners as well, considering they can easily deal with Togekiss and Tornadus and can also use Volt Switch to bait in their counters, such as Snorlax, Porygon2, and Umbreon, for Scrafty to easily deal with. Lastly, Scrafty loves paralysis support, as it patches up Scrafty's low Speed and keeps it from being revenge killed as easily. Togekiss is an excellent Pokemon for the job, as it has well rounded bulk that allows it to easily spread paralysis around.</p> "

Unless your team has some extremely hard hitters, or a Dark-type, it will be nigh impossible to stop Sigilyph. This is thanks to its great typing, movepool, and stats that go hand-in-hand with its ability, Magic Guard. Its typing provides it with an invaluable quadruple resistance to the growing population of Fighting-type moves and a nifty immunity to Ground-type attacks; this allows Sigilyph to gain plenty of switch-in opportunities and wall a number of dangerous UU Pokemon. Its movepool contains a reliable recovery move in Roost; boosting moves, such as Calm Mind and Cosmic Power; and many coverage options, such as Heat Wave and Ice Beam. It is commonly seen running the classic bulky sweeper set, which is known for making its opponents bald as they rip their hair out in pure frustration. It can also run the most durable offensive set of its kind that performs just as well. Its ability, Magic Guard, is really what makes Sigilyph a Pokemon worth writing home about, as an immunity to common forms of passive damage, such as Toxic and Stealth Rock, is extremely helpful and what makes Sigilyph so difficult to break past.</p> <p>At this point, you might be wondering why is Sigilyph not banned to Ubers; the reason lies in the fact that common Pokemon aren't really forced out by it, especially specially offensive Pokemon that can hit it hard, such as Raikou, Zapdos, and Zoroark. Dark-types are also the bane of almost all Sigilyph. Phazing is another strategy Sigilyph hates to face, as it comes into the field wanting to stay there for a long time before either fainting or switching out. However, you should never underestimate Sigilyph unless you would like it to sweep you.</p> ",

Sigilyph can utilize support moves such as dual screens, Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Whirlwind, but it is outclassed by Xatu in using them. Hypnosis, however, is a move that is somewhat unique to Sigilyph, being able to shut a Pokemon down and providing opportunities for set up, although it is still very unreliable, and Sigilyph has a hard time finding a moveslot to spare for it. As far as offensive options go, it can make use of Charge Beam as another way to boost its Special Attack while doing a bit of damage in the process, but Calm Mind is almost always a superior option due to the fact that it barely does any damage anyway. Sigilyph can use a Choice item on the offensive set, but they have their own issues. Life Orb outclasses Choice Specs, as its residual damage it cut out by Magic Guard, and it also gives Sigilyph the ability to freely switch moves. Choice Scarf makes Sigilyph a good revenge killer, but Sigilyph's Special Attack and the Base Power of its moves are somewhat lacking by UU standards. Sigilyph can also attempt gimmicky sets such as Trick Room and Gravity, but they end up being a little too gimmicky to be viable. As for abilities, Tinted Lens is actually decent, but so much not on a Pokemon that has access to the far more superior Magic Guard, as Sigilyph enjoys the immunity to forms of residual damage, such as Stealth Rock and Toxic, more than being able to hit most resistances for neutral damage. While Wonder Skin allows Sigilyph to avoid some forms of status, Flame Orb does that more reliably and Sigilyph would once again prefer the immunity to residual damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Sigilyph has entirely different checks depending on the set it runs. The bulky sweeper set's archenemies are Dark-types. Sableye is probably the best Dark-type to take care of Sigilyph, as it has priority Taunt to stop Sigilyph's boosting and recovery, is immune to Stored Power, has Recover to mitigate burn damage, and can strike it hard with a super effective STAB Foul Play. Hitting it with insanely powerful attacks so it can't Roost off the damage or continue boosting in fear of being KOed is another excellent way of checking Sigilyph. One of the best candidates for this is Victini, as it hits extremely hard with a STAB V-create. Raikou and Zapdos are also good at this job thanks to their Electric-type STAB and good Special Defense. Pokemon that are capable of phazing are also great; Calm Mind Suicune is a perfect example, as it can boost alongside Sigilyph and Roar it out granted it runs both moves.</p> <p>The offensive set is surprisingly easier to check and counter. Specially defensive Umbreon can stop it because it is only 5HKOed at best, giving it more than enough time to strike Sigilyph down with STAB Foul Play or Payback. Snorlax can also take any attack thrown at it and then OHKO back with a Choice Band-boosted Crunch. If you decide against running both Air Slash and Hidden Power Fighting, then Dark-types (especially Sharpedo) become even bigger threats, as they can easily switch in and threaten to severely hurt or even outright OHKO it. Sigilyph is also easily revenge killed by any decently powerful Pokemon after some prior damage.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is Sigilyph's bread-and-butter set. Its fantastic typing gives Sigilyph plenty of opportunities to set up. It also has a pseudo-immunity to status thanks to its ability, Magic Guard. The game plan for this set is simple; come in on something that Sigilyph forces out (preferably a wall) and boost as it switches. If the switch-in is a physical attacker, then burn it with Psycho Shift; if not, then continue boosting, Roost whenever you feel necessary, and once you're certain you've gotten enough boosts sweep with Stored Power. However, for this game plan to work, you must have any and every Dark-type on the opponent's team removed, as they are immune to Sigilyph's only attacking move, Stored Power.</p> <p>Cosmic Power is the boosting move of choice, as it turns Sigilyph into an unbreakable tank save for critical hits. Calm Mind, on the other hand, provides Sigilyph with a way to boost its Special Attack while simultaneously boosting its Special Defense. Calm Mind is listed because Sigilyph can cripple most physical attackers by passing them its burn with Psycho Shift. Speaking of Psycho Shift, this move occupies the second slot because it is capable of passing the burn (or any status condition not named sleep or freeze) Flame Orb causes onto the foe, crippling it with residual damage. Stored Power is the STAB move of choice, as it gains more power the more Sigilyph boosts, with or without Calm Mind. After it is fully boosted, Stored Power reaches a whopping 240 Base Power, which is enough to dent the most frightening specially defensive Pokemon of UU, Snorlax, comfortably 2HKOing it (this turns into an OHKO if Sigilyph is using Calm Mind). Roost is Sigilyph's reliable recovery move, preventing the opponent from whittling down Sigilyph's health. Roost also temporarily removes Sigilyph's weaknesses to Electric-, Ice-, and Rock-type attacks.</p> <p>The EVs above allow Sigilyph to survive neutral Heracross and Mienshao's Stone Edges, after which Sigilyph can burn them to allow it to survive the second one. Just make sure that Heracross is running Moxie and not Guts, as the burn would then actually benefit it. Furthermore, Sigilyph can survive Life Orb Virizion's Stone Edge and avoid a 2HKO from Choice Scarf Darmanitan's Flare Blitz at +1; you will have to use Cosmic Power again after the first hit though.</p> <p>Toxic Orb can be used over Flame Orb for more passive damage on the opponent, though be warned of the fact that Sigilyph will no longer be able to handle physical attackers quite as well. Toxic Orb also doesn't affect Steel- and Poison-types, unlike Flame Orb, which is only ineffective against Fire-type opponents. Likewise, if you have Toxic Spikes support on your team, then Leftovers is a great substitute over Flame Orb, although Sigilyph won't be able to evade sleep and freeze status conditions in that case. Air Slash can be used over Stored Power to be able to land a hit on Dark-types. However, Stored Power has more power in the long run and is capable of seriously denting or outright KOing the majority of the tier. If you do choose to run Air Slash, make sure that you're using Calm Mind as your boosting move, as Air Slash's power is pathetic otherwise. Psychic or Psyshock can be used for more immediate power, but they aren't recommended, as this Sigilyph should never have to attack as soon as it enters the field.</p> <p>Fighting-types are the best partners for Sigilyph, as they're capable of ridding the opponent's team of Dark-type Pokemon, which are immune to Sigilyph's only attacking move. The best options are Cobalion and Scrafty because of their quadruple resistance to Dark-type attacks and capability of forming a good bulky boosting core with Sigilyph. Cobalion even gets a boost from tanking Dark-type attacks thanks to its ability Justified. Snorlax is an excellent partner for taking care of troublesome special attackers that make Sigilyph's life stressful. Rhyperior is another good candidate because it is immune to Electric-type attacks and resists Rock-type moves, both of which are super effective against Sigilyph. Rhyperior can even hit Ice-type Pokemon for super effective damage with its STAB Rock Blast or Stone Edge. Sigilyph in return can come in on the Grass-types that threaten Rhyperior.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Sigilyph's great mixture of durability and power makes it a unique offensive Pokemon in the UU metagame. Its ability, Magic Guard, is what makes this set good, as it enables Sigilyph to be very resilient on the battlefield while dishing out powerful attacks thanks to its decent base 103 Special Attack. Psyshock is generally Sigilyph's STAB move of choice because it gets a noticeably stronger hit on specially defensive tanks, such as Snorlax. Psychic, on the other hand, can be used for raw power and has a rare but useful chance of lowering the foe's Special Defense. Air Slash can be used as Sigilyph's secondary STAB; it gets a harder hit on Scrafty, a Pokemon Sigilyph would otherwise fear. Ice Beam, however, hits similar targets to that of Air Slash and also gets an OHKO on Flygon and Gligar; although if Sigilyph runs Ice Beam, its completely walled by Slowbro and Slowking. Heat Wave occupies the third slot for getting a super effective hit on Steel-types, such as Bronzong and Registeel. Roost is an excellent option for the last slot, as it provides reliable recovery and gives Sigilyph even more durability. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fighting gets a super effective hit on Dark-types and Empoleon. Make sure you run at least one of Hidden Power Fighting and Air Slash, as otherwise Pokemon such as Umbreon and Sharpedo will wall it to hell and back.</p> <p>The EVs above are standard for many special attackers; however, an alternate spread of 56 HP / 252 SpA / 200 Spe will give Sigilyph a higher chance of surviving Choice Scarf Heracross's Stone Edge while also allowing it to avoid a 2HKO from Life Orb Shaymin's Seed Flare (assuming no drops). However, Sigilyph will desperately miss outspeeding positive base 95s, such as Arcanine. Life Orb is the item of choice here, as it grants Sigilyph some much-desired power; the recoil that would normally be taken is negated thanks to Magic Guard. Hidden Power Fighting can be used over Air Slash or Ice Beam in the second slot or Heat Wave in the third slot to make room for Roost if you must have both. Energy Ball and Shadow Ball are other coverage options Sigilyph has access to, but they only hit a small range of Pokemon and generally don't provide more coverage than the options listed above. Calm Mind is a great boosting move that can be used in the last slot; however, Sigilyph will lose out on coverage and healing, and this variant has a much harder time setting up. Tinted Lens is another ability that Sigilyph has access to; while it may seem useful on this set at first, don't be fooled, as an immunity to residual damage outclasses the need to hit Pokemon that 2x resist its Psychic-type attacks neutrally.</p> <p>Sigilyph's preferred teammates come straight down to the coverage moves it uses. If it opts not to use Air Slash, then Slowbro and Slowking effortlessly wall it, making Shaymin and Roserade good partners, as they can quickly rid them from the field. If you use Roost over Hidden Power Fighting, then Dark-types can come in and threaten it. For this reason, Fighting-types are excellent partners, as most of them can practically switch in for free and land powerful STABs; they can also threaten Snorlax and Umbreon, Pokemon that give Sigilyph trouble no matter what moves it runs. Sigilyph's awkward Speed tier just begs revenge killers to come in and dispose of it, so bulky Choice Scarf users of your own are great options; examples of these include Heracross, Raikou, and Victini. Last but not least, Sigilyph greatly appreciates entry hazard support to allow it to achieve KOs on certain Pokemon, such as specially defensive Togekiss. Rhyperior is an awesome partner in this regard as it threatens Pokemon that tend to be able to harm Sigilyph while being able to set up Stealth Rock.</p> "

  "Cofagrigus": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier dominated by powerful Fighting-types, such as Heracross and Mienshao, Cofagrigus stands out as a great check to many of them. Breaking through Cofagrigus with physical attacks is very difficult with its gargantuan base 145 Defense and it can even take some special attacks due to its usable base 105 Special Defense. Base 95 Special Attack combined with access to Trick Room and Nasty Plot means that it can run a sturdy special sweeper set that is very difficult to stop. The icing on the cake is Cofagrigus's unique ability, Mummy, which helps weaken Pokemon with powerful abilities such as Azumarill. However, it has its flaws: base 58 HP hinders its walling abilities and the UU tier is filled with not only Fighting- but also Dark-types. Despite this, Cofagrigus is a great addition to many teams that need a reliable response to Fighting-types or a good spinblocker.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With access to Calm Mind and titanic bulk, a bulky Calm Mind set seems usable. Sadly, lack of reliable recovery hurts Cofagrigus and the set is generally outclassed by the offensive Trick Room set. Curse, Destiny Bond, Heal Block, and Magic Coat are all support options it can use, but they're all gimmicky at best. Offensively, Cofagrigus has Grass Knot and Energy Ball to hit Swampert and Rhyperior, but a burn hurts them enough. Hex is a Ghost-type move that has 100 Base Power when the opponent's Pokemon is suffering from a status condition, but Shadow Ball is generally better because it is more reliable and has more PP.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best counters to offensive Cofagrigus are Togekiss and Calm Mind Meloetta. Both are immune to Shadow Ball and laugh at Hidden Power Fighting due to their high special bulk and neutrality to the move; the former can set up Nasty Plots on Cofagrigus and Roost off any damage, while the latter can set up Calm Minds and KO it with Shadow Ball. They both have access to Heal Bell, so they can even beat the defensive set with ease. Choice Band Snorlax with Crunch can take a Hidden Power with its supreme bulk and destroy Cofagrigus with Crunch or Pursuit, but the defensive set can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Offensive Roserade can switch in on Trick Room or Nasty Plot and OHKO with Leaf Storm and can heal a burn with Natural Cure. Milotic has Dragon Tail and Haze to stop offensive Cofagrigus and can take a +2 Shadow Ball. Furthermore, Will-O-Wisp activates Marvel Scale, increasing Milotic's Defense. Strong Sucker Punch users such as Honchkrow and Bisharp can revenge kill Cofagrigus by bypassing Trick Room, and they usually have Substitute to block Will-O-Wisp from the defensive set. When Trick Room runs out, powerful Dark- and Ghost-types can revenge kill Cofagrigus with their STAB attacks.</p> <p>The defensive set is much easier to counter. Fire-types, such as Arcanine and Darmanitan, can switch in on a Will-O-Wisp on Shadow Ball and hit hard with their Flare Blitzes. Victini works too, but is weak to Shadow Ball and should be careful switching in. Specially based Dark-types such as Zoroark and Houndoom don't care much about a burn and are resistant to Shadow Ball, so they are good checks. In general, hitting Cofagrigus hard on the switch and hitting it with status are good ways to bring it down.</p> ",

Thanks to a combination of good bulk and perfect coverage, Cofagrigus has all it needs to be a very sturdy and powerful special sweeper. Even uninvested, its bulk is good enough that it can still check Fighting-types and weak attackers and use them to set up a sweep. Nasty Plot boosts its Special Attack to a respectable 634, while Trick Room makes Cofagrigus \"faster\" than many other Pokemon. Shadow Ball is a reliable and powerful STAB attack and has perfect coverage with Hidden Power Fighting. The chosen item is Leftovers, as the passive recovery helps Cofagrigus set up a sweep.</p> <p>The EV spread is standard for a Trick Room sweeper: Special Attack is maximized for power, while HP is maximized so that Cofagrigus remains bulky. A Quiet nature with 2 IVs in Speed is used so that Cofagrigus is as slow as possible, while ensuring Hidden Power Fighting has 70 Base Power. 2 IVs in Attack help reduce damage inflicted by confusion and the move Foul Play.</p> <p>As for teammates, Cofagrigus appreciates those that can set up entry hazards, as this will help him break through the opponent's team. Rhyperior, Empoleon, and Roserade are good teammates because they lure out Fighting-type Pokemon on which Cofagrigus can set up. Umbreon and the rarer Clefable are great defensive teammates for Cofagrigus. They can heal Cofagrigus via Wish or Heal Bell, have perfect type synergy with him, and can lure out Fighting-types. As for offensive teammates, Choice Band Snorlax and offensive Porygon2 with Download are some of the best due to their good synergy and ability to utilize Trick Room due to their low Speed stats. Lastly, a good wallbreaker such as Nidoking or Porygon-Z can damage special walls to make Cofagrigus's life easier.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Cofagrigus's stat distribution just screams defensive wall. While it is not as threatening or used as the offensive Trick Room set, this set sees usage on full stall teams that need a very sturdy spinblocker and Fighting-type counter. With its base 145 Defense and Ghost typing, it can easily check all the Fighting-types in UU with the exception of Scrafty. it can also check most physical attackers in general due to its ability to cripple them with a burn via Will-O-Wisp. Will-O-Wisp is also good for luring Snorlax, a very common switch-in to the Offensive set. With its base 95 Special Attack, it is not setup fodder either and can still hit hard with its STAB Shadow Ball. Pain Split is Cofagrigus's only usable form of recovery, and while it is not very reliable, it allows Cofagrigus to heal against Pokemon with high HP stats such as Snorlax. Haze is used in the last slot to prevent sweepers such as Swords Dance Heracross and Substitute + Bulk Up Gallade from setting up sweeps while also checking Baton Pass chains. However, if you don't need that, Knock Off is an option to remove Leftovers and Life Orbs.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Defense because Cofagrigus is meant to check Fighting- and Bug-types such as Heracross and Cobalion. RestTalk provides a more reliable method of recovery, but it means that you have to drop Haze or Knock Off, so use them only if you have another Hazer on the team. Cofagrigus's best friend here is Umbreon: it has a very good synergy with the Coffin Pokemon and can heal it with Wish and Heal Bell. Clefable can do this as well, but is not as bulky as Umbreon. Special sponges like Snorlax and Porygon2 work well at taking strong special attacks, while Cofagrigus can switch in on Fighting-type moves directed at them. Finally, because Cofagrigus lures out Dark-types, bulky Steel-types, such as Registeel and Empoleon, make good teammates.</p> "

  "Carracosta": {
    "overview": "<p>Balanced attacking stats, decent STAB coverage, access to Shell Smash, and two usable abilities in Sturdy and Solid Rock turn Carracosta into a potent sweeper. With these abilities, a stellar base 133 Defense stat, and great physical coverage, Carracosta easily sets itself apart from Omastar as a Shell Smash user and Kabutops as a Choice Band user. It's not all good news for Carracosta, though; its vulnerability to the common Fighting-, Ground-, Electric-, and Grass-type attacks hampers its ability to sweep completely, even with Solid Rock. The fossil is also painfully slow; even though Shell Smash helps remedy this to an extent, he is still easily outsped. Despite these drawbacks, Carracosta is still a great Pokemon and is a good choice for any team that needs a powerful and reliable sweeper.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A special set consisting of Ice Beam, Focus Blast, Hidden Power, and Surf or Hydro Pump is plausible, but Omastar outclasses Carracosta at this due to its higher Special Attack stat, and Carracosta is more threatening as a physical attacker. Bulldoze and Smack Down are both interesting options that each have unique benefits, but both are situational, and therefore should be avoided, unless it offers important team support. Carracosta also has a decent support movepool at its disposal, including Knock Off, Rain Dance, and Toxic. However, Carracosta's common weaknesses, and lack of recovery prevent a defensive or supportive set from being truly viable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There are several simple ways to easily prevent Carracosta's onslaught. Bulky Grass-types, such as Ferroseed and Tangrowth, can come in and hit Carracosta with their super effective STAB attacks. Bulky Water-types, particularly Suicune and Slowbro, can easily handle most Carracosta. Slowbro does need to watch out for the rare Crunch, however. Speedy Special attackers can easily beat Carracosta, especially if previous attacks or entry hazards have broken Sturdy. Zapdos and Sceptile are great examples of quick, powerful sweepers who easily OHKO Carracosta. Phazers with Roar or Dragon Tail check the Shell Smash set and break Sturdy if hazards are up. Finally, defensive Pokemon, such as Weezing, Dusclops, and Cofagrigus can cripple Carracosta with Will-O-Wisp. Sableye gets a special mention due to its priority Will-O-Wisp and its ability to Taunt Carracosta, preventing it from using Shell Smash; however, Sableye must be wary of Aqua Jet.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Shell Smash",
        "description": "<p>This set is self-explanatory; come in on a resisted attack or non-damaging move, use Shell Smash, and tear your opponent's team apart with Carracosta's great coverage. Waterfall is the obligatory STAB move of choice, as it not only deals massive damage, but also has a pretty useful chance to flinch. Stone Edge complements Waterfall beautifully, because it provides a way to hit Pokemon that resist Waterfall, such as Roserade, for neutral damage. In the last slot, Carracosta can either use Aqua Jet for priority to check faster threats, such as Choice Scarf Flygon and Krookodile, as it is still relatively slow even after a Shell Smash boost, or use Earthquake to hit Empoleon and Ferroseed, both of which resist its STAB combination. White Herb negates the defense drops that Shell Smash causes and pairs very well with Solid Rock, allowing Carracosta to maintain its bulk.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Carracosta the ability to outspeed positive base 100 Speed Pokemon after a Shell Smash. Carracosta can run Surf or Hydro Pump instead of Waterfall, since its base 83 Special Attack is nothing to scoff at, especially after a Shell Smash boost. However, a special Water-type attack does not offer much coverage outside of what Waterfall already hits, and splitting the EVs for a mixed set removes some of Carracosta's potency. Crunch can be used in the last slot if one is desperate to get super-effective damage on Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Mismagius, but it only has 10 more Base Power than STAB Stone Edge against targets hit super effectively, so it isn't really worth it.</p> <p>Even after a Shell Smash boost, Carracosta is still outrun by faster Pokemon. Therefore, Carracosta needs support to work properly. Uxie and Cresselia pair well with Carracosta, sporting an immunity to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, as well as the ability to provide dual screen and paralysis support. Entry hazards make the armored turtle's job much easier; pairing Carracosta with a hazard setter, such as Qwilfish or Roserade, will greatly facilitate a Carracosta sweep.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Using a Choice Band turns Carracosta into a powerful physical sweeper without having to set up. Waterfall deals massive damage, but since this set doesn't use Shell Smash to boost Carracosta's Attack, Aqua Tail can be used, as it hits harder than Waterfall, at the cost of a little accuracy. Stone Edge gives Carracosta a great STAB option, and when combined with Waterfall, gives a combination that only Empoleon and Ferroseed resist. In the third slot, Earthquake hits Steel-types such as Empoleon while Crunch nails Psychic- and Ghost-types, such as Uxie, hard. Aqua Jet is a great move for this set, providing Carracosta with a priority attack to nail faster Pokemon, such as Arcanine and Krookodile. Solid Rock is the ability of choice here as it gives Carracosta more chances to switch in. Wish, Aromatherapy, and Rapid Spin support all help keep Carracosta healthy, and your own entry hazards make it easier for Carracosta to KO its opponent.</p> <p>Sturdy can be used over Solid Rock to guarantee at least one hit if Carracosta is at full health. However, Solid Rock lets Carracosta switch in more easily and benefits Carracosta more than Sturdy in the long run. Solid Rock, along with Carracosta's better coverage and higher Defense stat, is what sets it apart from Kabutops. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge if you prefer higher accuracy, but the loss in power means that Carracosta loses out on certain KOs. Body Slam provides excellent type coverage alongside its Water-type STAB, and its decent paralysis rate is helpful too.</p> <p>Because Carracosta is so slow, Pokemon that can spread paralysis are greatly appreciated. Ferroseed is a perfect example, as it can use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis, it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and it has access to Leech Seed, helping Carracosta to restore its health. Registeel can cripple opponents with Thunder Wave, switch into Grass-type attacks aimed at Carracosta, and set up Stealth Rock to weaken the opponent. Status absorbers, such as Clefable, also work well, as they can switch into Will-O-Wisp. Bronzong can set up Stealth Rock, cripple an opponent with Hypnosis, and set up Trick Room to remedy Carracosta's poor Speed. Qwilfish and Roserade are decent teammates as well; both can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes and the latter can cripple an opponent with Sleep Power.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Unlike the large majority of the Pokemon of the fifth generation, Archeops has phenomenal stats that fit its role well. With Attack that approaches overkill, Speed that is uncannily high for a Rock-type, high Special Attack, and a fantastic offensive typing, Archeops is well-suited for its role as a sweeper. Its movepool, while not expansive, provides nearly perfect coverage with the \"EdgeQuake\" combination. Looking at Archeops, it is evident that Game Freak earnestly tried to make a speedy, menacing Rock-type sweeper. However, they may have overestimated its strength. Archeops's great power is very cruelly balanced out by its ability, Defeatist. Whenever Archeops loses more than half of its health, its ability halves its attacking stats and effectively neuters it for the rest of the match. A weakness to Stealth Rock and lack of any resistances to the most common priority moves in the tier only serve to compound the issues that Defeatist creates. Nevertheless, even with its debilitating ability, Archeops can succeed in UU by sheer offensive might.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice is one of the most viable of Archeops's options, allowing it to KO Gligar with little effort. Knock Off can be used to make Eviolite users like Porygon2, Dusclops, and the aforementioned Gligar far less useful for the rest of the match and also allows Archeops to do serious damage to them with its STAB moves. Taunt can be used to disable a variety of walls and cripple Baton Pass teams, but forces the opponent to attack Archeops, which is not something that is desired. A special set with Hidden Power Rock, Focus Blast, Earth Power, and a filler move can be used but lacks power. Expert Belt serves as a sort of intermediate between Choice Band and Flying Gem - Archeops retains the ability to switch between moves while gaining a valuable 20% power boost, though it lacks access to an effective Flying-type STAB attack and will have to rely more heavily on Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. Choice Scarf can be used, but Archeops ends up starved for the offensive might of other sets. However, its high base Speed allows it to outspeed most of the tier with a Choice Scarf, so it is not something to wholly ignore. One can always consider using Sitrus Berry or other one-use Items instead of Flying Gem on the Acrobatics set. Generally speaking, the power provided by Flying Gem is the best match for Archeops's style of play; an item like Sitrus Berry will leave Acrobatics with a weak Base Power until it is consumed. With regard to nature, Archeops always has the option to run an Adamant nature to further boost its Attack. However, with Adamant, it falls behind Pokemon with 100 base Speed and a positive nature, which is a severe blow to Archeops's already limited survivability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While few Pokemon can switch into Archeops, it is not a difficult Pokemon to force out. While Archeops possesses the power to 2HKO the majority of foes it will face in UU, most of those foes need only one turn to beat it into Defeatist range or KO it outright. With Defeatist activated, Archeops becomes rather useless, which makes it critical for Archeops to pick its battles wisely--it will often be forced to predict properly to beat foes by catching them with the correct move on the switch-in. Registeel is not 2HKOed by Earthquake without prior damage, meaning it can always force Archeops out at least once; Registeel's Iron Head easily knocks Archeops into Defeatist range. Archeops must also be weary of faster foes like Raikou, Weavile, and UU's many Choice Scarf users. While Hitmontop must be switched in carefully to avoid Flying-type moves, it knocks Archeops into Defeatist range with Technician Mach Punch. Weavile and Azumarill destroy Archeops with their STAB priority moves, but both take great damage switching into Archeops's STAB attacks. Porygon2 is strong enough to survive two hits from Acrobatics (even if the Flying Gem is intact) and is similarly unafraid of the Choice Band set if it invests in defense.</p> ",

By using Flying Gem, Archeops' Acrobatics has incredible power and does more damage than any Brave Bird in the tier. Even after the Flying Gem is consumed, Acrobatics is still a potent move, with 110 Base Power. Stone Edge is Archeops' secondary STAB. While the accuracy is often aggravating, a 100 Base Power STAB move with the Rock-type's awesome offensive coverage is not to be underestimated. Earthquake has great coverage alongside both Flying- and Rock-type attacks and removes the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Acrobatics. However, one must keep in mind that Steel- and Rock-types are often able to survive an Earthquake and heavily injure or outright KO Archeops in return, so Earthquake is best used preemptively to strike predicted switch-ins. U-turn fills the final moveslot and allows Archeops to play the role of a scout while also getting some quick damage in.</p> <p>The EVs and nature are standard fare, maximizing Archeops's Speed and power. Putting the remaining 4 EVs into Defense instead of HP allows Archeops to switch into Stealth Rock twice without activating Defeatist.</p> <p>Hone Claws is an option that can replace U-turn, but considering Archeops's frailty and the dangers associated with Defeatist, the benefits of Hone Claws are rarely worth missing a valuable chance to attack. This is not to say that the boosts can't be impressive--a +1 Flying Gem Acrobatics can OHKO a max HP Cobalion with Spikes support.</p> <p>Because every precious bit of HP needs to be preserved, Archeops benefits greatly from the presence of a teammate with Rapid Spin. Hitmontop and Claydol are both good choices because they provide bulk and invaluable Rock-type resistances; Claydol is immune to Electric-type attacks as well. Magic Bounce Xatu functions similarly in its ability to keep Stealth Rock off of the field. In the event that Archeops takes a bit too much damage, Wish and Leech Seed can give it a second chance. Otherwise, Reflect and Light Screen support allow it to take hits with greater ease.</p> <p>Having teammates weak to Ground-type moves can also be effective, providing invaluable opportunities for Archeops to switch into battle. Raikou, Nidoking, and Rhyperior can all work towards this goal and allow Archeops to switch in unscathed. Rhyperior is special in that it draws in the same Pokemon as Archeops, allowing them to jointly weaken their counters and muscle through the enemy team.</p> "

With the loss of Acrobatics, Stone Edge becomes Archeops' main move, but still hits incredibly hard against any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Earthquake still fulfills its role of providing invaluable coverage, especially against Steel-types. U-turn plays a greater role on this set, allowing Archeops to hit hard before switching out, avoiding the danger of being locked into the wrong move. The last slot is left to filler. Despite its low Base Power, Aerial Ace dismantles bulky Fighting-types like Hitmontop, which are traditionally problematic for Rock-type sweepers. On the other hand, Crunch deals severe damage to Mew, Dusclops, and Golurk. Psychic-type Pokemon are everywhere in UU, and Crunch can beat them without relying on Stone Edge's accuracy.</p> <p>A few moves can also be used in the last slot. Quick Attack is Archeops's only priority move, but it is weak and provides little coverage. Even with the Choice Band, being locked into a 40 Base Power Normal-type move is a severe liability. Acrobatics hits with about 92% of the power of Aerial Ace, but becomes more useful in the event that Archeops is hit by Knock Off.</p> <p>Much like the previous set, anything that prevents, diminishes, or heals damage done to Archeops is a terrific boon. Pokemon with Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce Xatu become even more important for Archeops, as it needs to switch more frequently when locked into a single move. Again, Leech Seed, Wish, Reflect, and Light Screen are very useful to run.</p> <p>Just as with the Acrobatics set, Rhyperior and other Pokemon weak to Ground-type moves are good partners because can create opportunities for Archeops to switch in.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Zoroark is a very unique Pokemon; its signature ability, Illusion, allows it to masquerade as the last Pokemon in the player's party. Although Team Preview theoretically hurts this strategy, it does not say when or even if Zoroark will be used in the battle. Zoroark is also very powerful in terms of offense, wielding a base 105 Attack and a base 120 Special Attack. In addition, Zoroark learns both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, allowing it to boost either of its offensive stats. With 105 base Speed, it outspeeds positive natured base 100s, while also forcing a Speed tie with Mienshao and Mismagius. However, Zoroark's biggest downfall is its very poor bulk; it can barely switch in on neutral hits, and has trouble facing down priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Mach Punch. As such, Zoroark is a difficult Pokemon to use effectively. Although it may be viewed as a gimmicky Pokemon, it is very deadly when used properly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zoroark learns Pursuit, which may seem appealing to trap Pokemon such as Victini and Mismagius. However, Zoroark lacks the stats to effectively use Pursuit, making Weavile and Honchkrow better options. By using Taunt, Zoroark prevents the opponent from going for non-attacking moves, making Sucker Punch much more effective. However, Zoroark is so frail that if the opponent does decide to attack the turn it uses Taunt, Zoroark is likely to get OHKOed. Calm Mind boosts both Zoroark's Special Attack and its Special Defense, but its poor defenses make Nasty Plot a better option. Zoroark does have the Attack stat to use a Swords Dance set, but it does not have the physical movepool to pull off an effective one. Although Zoroark has the coverage to pull off an Agility set, this set is weak and Zoroark is already fast enough without Agility. Extrasensory can hit Fighting-types, but it has poor coverage and doesn't hit much outside of Hitmontop, Machamp, and Mienshao.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When Illusion is in effect, countering Zoroark is virtually impossible unless you see something like a Flygon taking Spikes damage. When disguised as Heracross, Cofagrigus and Dusclops get smashed by Dark Pulse or Night Daze on a switch in, while Gligar gets crippled by Trick. Even if the opponent predicts the Pokemon in question to be Zoroark in disguise, Hitmontop will be crippled by Trick. However, once its disguise has been discovered, beating Zoroark is very easy. Specially defensive Togekiss can take any attack from Zoroark and cripple it with Thunder Wave. Hitmontop is another great switch-in, safely taking any attack bar Extrasensory and OHKOing with Close Combat. Snorlax won't enjoy taking a Focus Blast, but it can switch in on any other attack and deal massive damage to Zoroark with its STAB; RestTalk variants of Snorlax 2HKO with Body Slam while offensive variants OHKO with Return after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>If you can't counter Zoroark, it can be checked by faster Pokemon. Cobalion outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Zoroark and OHKOes with Close Combat, allowing Cobalion to set up Swords Dance as Zoroark flees. In addition, if Cobalion switches in on Dark Pulse or Night Daze, it gets an Attack boost thanks to Justified. Be aware, however, that Cobalion cannot switch in on Focus Blast or Flamethrower. In addition, Zoroark is very easy to revenge kill with Choice Scarf users, particularly Heracross and Mienshao as they resist Sucker Punch.</p> ",

Not only does it hit 508 Special Attack with the boost from Choice Specs, it can now also cripple the likes of Gligar and Hitmontop, making these Pokemon significantly easier to handle. Although both Dark Pulse and Night Daze will hit anything that doesn't resist it very hard, it is generally better to use the former over the latter due to having perfect accuracy. However, Night Daze has slightly more power, and the accuracy drop it may inflict could be useful. With threats like Snorlax, Empoleon, Scrafty, and Umbreon weak to Fighting, Focus Blast grants Zoroark the ability to hit them for massive damage. Although Flamethrower generally provides redundant coverage alongside Focus Blast, it is Zoroark's strongest option against common UU Pokemon such as Bronzong and Roserade.</p> <p>Because Zoroark's defenses are terrible, its EV spread should simply maximize Special Attack and Speed, the only two stats it can make any good use of. If bulky Water-types are a problem for you, Zoroark can use Grass Knot over Flamethrower to hit them, at the cost of having no way of hitting Heracross. Using Grass Knot over Focus Blast may seem like a solution to this problem, but without Focus Blast, Zoroark has no way of hitting Pokemon like Snorlax and Empoleon.</p> <p>When considering a Pokemon to disguise Zoroark as, it is ideal to use a Pokemon that takes the same entry hazards damage as Zoroark. In addition, it should be able to lure defensive Pokemon, such as Cofagrigus or Gligar, that Zoroark can OHKO or cripple with Trick. Choice Scarf Heracross therefore makes a great partner as Zoroark can OHKO Cofagrigus with Dark Pulse and cripple Gligar with Trick. Zoroark will have trouble with Choice Scarf Mienshao and opposing Choice Scarf Heracross as both outspeed and OHKO it. Using a Cofagrigus of your own helps with this problem as it can switch in on both threats with ease and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp; in addition, Mummy nullifies their abilities, which is especially important in the case of Heracross.</p> "

Dark Pulse or Night Daze are used for STAB alongside Sucker Punch, due to the fact that Sucker Punch fails if the opponent does not attack. Focus Blast provides Zoroark with nearly unresisted coverage, giving it an option to hit Snorlax, Empoleon, and Umbreon; in addition, Focus Blast OHKOes any Scrafty that does not invest in its Special Defense. Flamethrower gives Zoroark an option for hitting Pokemon such as Heracross and Bronzong. However, if you have these threats covered already, Grass Knot is a solid option worth considering over Flamethrower in order to get a harder hit on Pokemon such as Suicune and Swampert.</p> <p>The EV spread simply maximizes Special Attack and Speed; maximizing Zoroark's Speed allows it to tie with Mienshao and Mismagius, and investing in extra Attack EVs does not give Sucker Punch any notable KOs.

In addition, while disguised as Heracross, Zoroark can lure Pokemon such as Gligar and Cofagrigus that trouble Heracross. Fighting-type Pokemon carrying Choice Scarf will be difficult for Zoroark to handle, as they outspeed and OHKO it. To make matters worse, Fighting-types resist Sucker Punch.

At +2, Zoroark reaches 678 Special Attack, which, when coupled with Life Orb, makes it incredibly difficult to wall; not even Snorlax can wall it, as it is OHKOed by a +2 Focus Blast after Stealth Rock. Dark Pulse should be the only STAB move ever used on this set, as missing is undesirable. In addition, the extra power from Night Daze is not as relevant with Nasty Plot boosts. Focus Blast lets Zoroark hit everything bar Heracross at least neutrally when combined with Dark Pulse, while also allowing it to get past Pokemon such as Snorlax, Umbreon, and Scrafty. Flamethrower is Zoroark's strongest option against Bronzong, Roserade, and Heracross, while Substitute is another option worth considering due to the fact that Zoroark will force many switches thanks to Illusion. In addition, Substitute gives Zoroark a buffer against enemy attacks.</p> <p>When Substitute is used over Flamethrower, it is preferred to use Leftovers as Zoroark's held item instead of Life Orb. With Substitute and Life Orb chipping away at Zoroark's health, it will go down very quickly. However, having to use Leftovers will cause a notable drop in Zoroark's damage output. When using Flamethrower, Zoroark should always use Life Orb as its held item because if it doesn't OHKO the opponent, its sweep will likely be cut short.</p> <p>Zoroark's disguise should be able to force out plenty of Pokemon, as this is the best way to grant Zoroark opportunities to set up.

In addition, while many players may attempt to use Choice Scarf Heracross to revenge kill Zoroark, this strategy will backfire against Choice Scarf Zoroark. Night Daze is a little more valuable on this set than it is on other sets because the extra damage output may be incredibly useful when attempting to revenge kill an opposing Pokemon, but it is still generally better to use Dark Pulse due to its perfect accuracy. However, Night Daze may drop the opponent's accuracy, which can come in handy if Zoroark cannot OHKO the opposing Pokemon. Focus Blast attains near-perfect coverage alongside its STAB, and allows Zoroark to revenge kill Scrafty. Although Flamethrower has redundant coverage alongside Focus Blast, it allows Zoroark to hit Heracross for super effective damage. In the last slot, Trick is generally more useful as it can cripple defensive Pokemon such as Cofagrigus, Dusclops, and Gligar; however, by using Trick, the opponent may be able to sweep more easily later. Because of this, U-turn can be used to gain momentum when the opposing Pokemon switches out.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used on this set as it hits Gligar super effectively, but it has poor coverage otherwise. Unlike other Zoroark sets, this set is not weak to Choice Scarf Heracross, as Zoroark outspeeds and KOs it with Flamethrower after a little prior damage. However, Choice Scarf Mienshao may still be a problem, as it ties with Zoroark and OHKOes with High Jump Kick. Cofagrigus handles Mienshao with ease due to its immunity to High Jump Kick and its massive Defense stat. Zoroark will be a much more effective revenge killer if disguising it as Pokemon that encourage whatever you want to revenge kill to stay in. Disguising it as Slowbro encourages special attackers, such as Roserade, to stay in, allowing Zoroark to revenge kill it with Flamethrower. On the other hand, although disguising it as Snorlax may seem like a terrible idea as both Snorlax and Zoroark are weak to Fighting-type attacks, disguising it as Snorlax encourages Heracross and Scrafty to stay in, allowing Zoroark to revenge kill both Pokemon.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Cinccino does not look very threatening. Speed is its only decent stat, and it also suffers from a poor movepool with no viable way of hitting Steel-type Pokemon. However, Skill Link turns Cinccino from a mediocre Pokemon to a threat that all UU teams should be prepared for. Skill Link allows Cinccino to effectively utilize its multi-hit moves, as they will always hit 5 times, with the added benefit of breaking Substitutes and Focus Sashes while continuing to attack. So, what is this cute little thing doing in RU? The answer to this is simple; it is walled by common Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzong and Cobalion, and it is easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users due to its poor defenses. Regardless of its flaws, however, Cinccino can give headaches to teams that lack Steel-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Unfortunately, Cinccino doesn't have any other options that are worth using. Although Return is much more accurate than Tail Slap, it is noticeably weaker and Cinccino needs all the power it can get. Cinccino learns Aqua Tail, but it has better options to hit anything Aqua Tail covers. Work Up can be used to boost its mediocre Attack stat, but Cinccino doesn't have the resistances or bulk to set up. Wake-Up Slap is its best option against Steel-types, but 60 Base Power simply doesn't cut it. Although Technician may look appealing to boost Wake-Up Slap, Skill Link is what makes Cinccino worth using at all, so it should just stick to abusing Skill Link.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steel-types give Cinccino a run for its money. Bronzong has massive physical bulk and resists all of Cinccino's attacks bar U-turn, and Gyro Ball will do massive damage to Cinccino. Cobalion can easily tank any hit and OHKO Cinccino with Close Combat, while Registeel takes hits from Cinccino all day and cripples it with Thunder Wave. Although Bisharp is not as bulky as the other Steel-types mentioned, it can hit Cinccino hard with Sucker Punch. In addition, bulky Ghost-types will trouble Cinccino thanks to their immunity to Tail Slap. Cofagrigus and Dusclops easily take any hit from Cinccino, while they can use Will-O-Wisp to weaken it. Thanks to its Prankster ability, Sableye can burn Cinccino before it even gets the chance to attack. Hitmontop can also take it on thanks to Intimidate and STAB Close Combat. Aside from beating it with defensive Pokemon, it's also easy to revenge kill thanks to its virtually nonexistent bulk.

Rock Blast is its best option against the likes of Zapdos, potentially hitting it through Substitute, while Bullet Seed lets it handle Rhyperior and is its strongest option against bulky Water-types.

Additionally, Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage could lead to Cinccino being weakened more quickly than usual, which a Choice Band avoids. As Cinccino has trouble beating Steel-types, its best teammates are those who can handle Steel-types. Victini can beat any Steel-type bar Empoleon, as well as bulky Ghost-types such as Cofagrigus. Magneton is another excellent teammate as it can trap Steel-types thanks to its Magnet Pull ability.</p> "

This also gives it a ton of defensive utility as a counter to many of the metagame's most prominent threats, including Weavile, Roserade, and Mismagius, all of which it can put into a checkmate position due to its strong Pursuit. It's not all fun and games though, as Escavalier is so slow that even notoriously lazy Pokemon like Snorlax and Slowbro outpace it. On top of that, it has no coverage moves to speak of, making it complete setup fodder for threats such as Cobalion.

However, it does have access to a few noteworthy moves that it could put to good use under the right circumstances. Substitute is most noteworthy, as Escavalier's typing and bulk will often force a ton of switches, allowing it to set up quite often. Swords Dance and Reversal might seem appealing, but the fact is, Escavalier's Speed is so terrible that it will never get a chance to use them properly. Finally, Focus Blast can serve as a way of at least attempting to damage Aggron and Steelix, but is otherwise completely useless due to the snail's pathetic Special Attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although its huge Attack stat and STAB Megahorn might make it look quite scary, Escavalier can do massive damage if the opponent doesn't keep it in mind when building his or her team. Bold Zapdos, Cobalion, Gligar, Dusclops, Impish Arcanine, Steelix, and Moltres are all solid counters to any Escavalier set. Be careful of switching them in recklessly though, as some of the aforementioned Pokemon hate Toxic from the defensive set, and others lack means of recovering HP. Anything with a moderately powerful Fire-type move is a good check, including, but not limited to Darmanitan, Victini, and Nidoking. Users of Will-O-Wisp are also good checks, as Escavalier loses almost all of its utility once it is burned.

This set's purpose is twofold: first, it can tear huge holes into enemy lines simply by using Megahorn repeatedly, as even Pokemon that resist it will take huge amounts of damage. Second, Escavalier can use its strong Pursuit to trap and KO frail threats, such as Flygon, Weavile, and Mismagius. Iron Head serves as a backup STAB move for Pokemon that are hit super effectively by it or resist Megahorn, such as Rhyperior and Machamp, respectively. Return is only here because Escavalier's movepool is quite poor, but it does net a neutral hit on threats such as Arcanine and Zapdos, something neither of Escavalier's STAB moves can do.</p> <p>The given EV spread serves to optimize Escavalier's bulk and maximize its Attack, the remaining EVs tossed into Special Defense to prevent Download Porygon2 from receiving a beneficial boost as it comes in. You may choose to give up some bulk in order to make it faster than Snorlax and Slowbro, but Escavalier appreciates every bit of bulk it possesses, so only do this if you find it to be absolutely necessary. Swarm is the preferred ability here, as it has the potential to make the metallic snail's Megahorn virtually unstoppable, but Shell Armor's ability to protect it from critical hits is very useful as well. Unfortunately for Escavalier, its movepool is scarce, leaving it with little to play around with, despite its fourth moveslot being almost a complete filler. Double-Edge is an option, as it'll do more damage to Zapdos and Fire-types and has a wide range of neutral coverage. However, the recoil is unappealing since Escavalier relies so much on its HP to take hits. Rock Smash, despite how ridiculous it sounds, 2HKOes Cobalion 50% of the time. Knock Off also works, especially since two of its counters, Gligar and Dusclops, rely entirely on Eviolite to be effective. The use of Sleep Talk allows Escavalier to absorb Sleep inducing moves, such as Roserade's Sleep Powder. Another, less obvious option is to forego the use of Choice Band altogether in favor of giving Escavalier a means of recovering HP through Rest + Chesto Berry or even Leftovers. This works out fantastically due to its great typing, bulk, and virtually free fourth moveslot. It's also worth noting that given a Life Orb, a Brave nature, 0 Speed IVs, and possibly even Reversal, Escavalier becomes one of the most fearsome sweepers a dedicated Trick Room team can employ.</p> <p>Since Escavalier is so susceptible to hazard damage stacking up, keeping Spikes off the field by pairing it with a Rapid Spin user will greatly increase its longevity. Blastoise does especially well here, as it will gladly come in on the Fire-type moves aimed at the metallic snail. Offensively, Choice Scarf Heracross makes a fantastic partner, as Escavalier is sure to weaken the enemy Pokemon that resist Megahorn, opening up an opportunity for a Heracross sweep later in the game. Houndoom also makes for a good offensive partner, as it not only has Flash Fire to absorb all Fire-type moves aimed at the snail, but can also Pursuit enemy Victini, leaving Escavalier with one less counter to worry about. Snorlax works in a similar manner, but it also has the added benefit of easily defeating some of Escavalier's other counters, namely Zapdos.</p> "

Megahorn acts as Escavalier's main form of offense, and despite the minimal Attack investment, it will still hit very hard due to its naturally high Base Power. Iron Head is the snail's secondary STAB move, letting it hit Pokemon such as Crobat, Togekiss, and Heracross. Pursuit is included here because one of Escavalier's main functions is to check various Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Mismagius, Cofagrigus, and Flamethrower-less Azelf, and having this move usually puts them in a checkmate position. Toxic gives Escavalier a means of crippling many of its common switch-ins, such as Zapdos and bulky Water-types, but has very limited use outside of that. Rest can be used over either Pursuit or Toxic, as when it is combined with Chesto Berry, it gives the metallic snail a means of recovering HP, which it otherwise cannot do outside of Leftovers.</p> <p>The given EV spread optimizes Escavalier's ability to take special hits from the threats it is supposed to beat. The remaining EVs get tossed into Attack in order to let Escavalier do slightly more damage to its targets. This variant of Escavalier can use either one of its abilities effectively. Swarm makes Escavalier much more dangerous when its HP dips under one-third, but Shell Armor protects it from critical hits, and we all know how a well-timed critical hit can ruin even the best plan, so it is worth considering. Knock Off deserves a special mention here, as Gligar and Duscops, two Pokemon who normally have no trouble countering Escavalier, rely entirely on their Eviolite to function well. Pokemon with the ability Flash Fire make excellent teammates to Escavalier, as they can not only switch into its only weakness for free, but also benefit from doing so. Houndoom is especially noteworthy, as it can nearly guarantee the removal of Victini, one of Escavalier's most prominent checks. Blastoise is a good partner, as it can also come in on Fire-types and spin away the hazards that Escavalier dislikes.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss doesn't have a lot of other options it can use effectively. That said, there are some tricks it can pull off. Venoshock is one that stands out the most, as when used in conjunction with either Toxic or Toxic Spikes it can be very lethal against the opposing team. However, this is very situational and such strategy requires significant support. Growth is a useful boosting move to enhance Amoonguss's average offensive stats, making it a bigger threat. Unfortunately, Amoonguss's low Speed cripples it to the point where it won't find much time to successfully set up. Grass Knot is decent, and can hit Suicune for significantly more damage, but Giga Drain is much more reliable. Body Slam can work to paralyze an opponent while dealing decent damage, but Stun Spore is much more reliable. Foul Play is very interesting, and the ability to catch incoming Darmanitan and Victini can be useful in some situations. This however is difficult to fit in a moveslot. Finally, Amoonguss has access to Rain Dance and Sunny Day to support weather oriented teams, and is quite bulky to boot. However, you're often better off using Azelf or Bronzong, which either have a better typing or stronger offensive stats, to utilize these moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Of the things that can check or counter Amoonguss, the ones that stand out most are the ones that don't mind falling for Spore. The most notable of these is Xatu. Thanks to Magic Bounce, it can reflect back Spore and overall prevent Amoonguss from doing much of any value. Roserade doesn't exactly mind Spore thanks to Natural Cure, and is capable of incapacitating Amoonguss with Sleep Powder before it reacts. Users of Sleep Talk, such as Snorlax, Yanmega, Crobat, Heracross, and Escavalier can all put hurt on Amoonguss even while asleep. That aside, thanks to the number of weaknesses Amoonguss has, there are a number of Pokemon that can take Amoonguss down. Fire-types such as Arcanine, Darmanitan, and Victini can remove Amoonguss quickly from the battlefield. Honchkrow, Crobat, and Togekiss also don't care about Amoonguss at all. Mew, Azelf, Meloetta, and Weavile are also good Pokemon to take Amoonguss on. Taunt and Substitute are both great ways to stop Amoonguss, as it cannot pull off a Spore afterwards. Bisharp is a great example as it doesn't mind much of anything else Amoonguss has to offer, barring Hidden Power Fire on the offensive set, and can use it as setup fodder. Finally, if needed, you can use Trick on Amoonguss to essentially render it useless for the remainder of the match.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is Amoonguss's flagship set, which it pulls off quite decently. Thanks to good bulk and resistances allowing it to take on threats such as Zapdos, Mienshao, and Kingdra, this set can be a good fit on more defensive teams. While it faces stiff competition as a defensive Grass-type from Roserade, Amoonguss stands out with its perfectly accurate Spore, Regenerator, and good physical defense. Spore is the big selling point of this set, completely incapacitating an opponent. With the new sleep mechanics, this is essentially eliminating said Pokemon from the match. Giga Drain is the primary STAB move, dealing a decent amount of damage and restoring HP. Clear Smog is the preferred move in the next moveslot, as although extremely weak, it resets stat changes, allowing Amoonguss to deter setup chances. Sludge Bomb is, however, acceptable if the extra power is preferred over resetting stat boosts. Finally, Stun Spore is the chosen move to cripple opponents with paralysis after one Pokemon has fallen to Spore. However, Synthesis can be used as reliable recovery.</p> <p>The EV spread invests maximum HP and Defense to allow Amoonguss to more reliably check threats such as Kingdra and Mienshao, still leaving Amoonguss with enough special bulk to take on Raikou. A specially defensive EV spread can be used to more reliably check special variants of Kingdra as well as Raikou and Zapdos. However, this also leaves Amoonguss more prone to Heracross. Leftovers is the chosen item for its consistent recovery. Regenerator is the preferred ability as a means of free recovery should Amoonguss be forced out of the battle.</p> <p>Slowbro is an excellent teammate for Amoonguss, resisting most attacks that Amoonguss fears and vice versa. Slowbro also forms a Regenerator core with Amoonguss as they both sport the ability. Additionally, entry hazard support from the likes of Qwilfish or Bronzong is helpful, as Amoonguss may force some switches. Finally, a Dark-type such as Bisharp can be helpful to keep opposing Psychic-types at bay. Bisharp in particular benefits from Amoonguss being able to take on its common counters, such as Fighting-types.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Despite an average 85 Special Attack, Amoonguss can effectively take on an offensive role. This set hits decently hard, standing out from its main competitors with Spore being able to incapacitate an opponent as well as Regenerator being able to heal off Life Orb damage. Its decent bulk along with its typing also ensure that it will be able to last long enough to be able to dent an opposing team. Spore is again used to basically eliminate an opponent from the match with the fifth generation sleep mechanics. Giga Drain is the preferred STAB move here, hitting for solid damage while also proving Amoonguss with recovery. Sludge Bomb is essential secondary STAB; it hits Grass-types hard while hitting neutrally against incoming Fire-types such as Darmanitan. Hidden Power Fire is the preferred coverage move here to hit Steel-types such as Bisharp and Cobalion for heavy damage. Stun Spore, however, can be used in order to cripple an opponent, making up for Amoonguss's low Speed stat.</p> <p>Maximum is invested into Special Attack to hit as hard as possible. 120 HP EVs give an HP stat that works best with the Life Orb. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to add overall bulk. Regenerator is the ability of choice here as a form of recovery should Amoonguss be forced out; it also works well with Life Orb wearing Amoonguss down. A Life Orb is the preferred item for its additional power as Amoonguss is playing an offensive role. Hidden Power Rock is a notable option that can be used over Hidden Power Fire in order to hit Victini, but Victini can be incapacitated with Spore and Hidden Power Fire has more general utility.</p> <p>As with the previous set, Slowbro makes for a great teammate, sporting both good defensive and offensive synergy with Amoonguss, and it can also set up Trick Room, which works well with Amoonguss's low Speed stat. Spikes support from the likes of Crustle or Qwilfish is useful to help Amoonguss attain more needed KOs that it may otherwise miss out on. As Victini may be troublesome, Houndoom or Arcanine is useful to keep opposing Victini at bay while being able to maim bulky Steel-types that trouble Amoonguss. Finally, a weapon against Psychic-types such as Azelf or Mew is useful. Bisharp and Escavalier are both good examples of these, and can keep Psychic-types in check.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>UU is filled with bulky Water-types, all fighting for the same spot on a team. Alomomola must compete with many others for that spot and does its best to differentiate itself. Its offensive stats are lower than those of many other bulky Water-types, and it lacks coverage moves many enjoy. However, it offers a service to teams that no other Water-type in the UU metagame can: Wish passing. Alomomola's gargantuan Wishes restore a lot of health for many Pokemon, which makes it a good team supporter. Aside from Wish passing, Alomomola has Regenerator, a great ability that it shares with Slowbro. Alomomola's lack of a Psychic typing is a mixed blessing; it trades a useful Fighting resistance for a neutrality to U-turn, Pursuit, and of course, Heracross's Megahorn. Alomomola actually has the best overall physical bulk of all bulky Water-types in the UU metagame, which it can take advantage of with Wish and Regenerator. Overall, while it may not have the offensive presence of other bulky Water-types, it has a unique and useful niche in the UU metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Alomomola has a few other useful moves, but they are all hard to fit on a set. Light Screen can patch up its low Special Defense and provide more team support. Refresh can clear pesky status and make Alomomola less reliant on a teammate to do the job. Soak is a gimmicky move that can weaken Pokemon by removing STAB, and opens Steel- and Poison-types to Toxic. Healing Wish can fully heal a Pokemon by sacrificing Alomomola, but it is generally inferior to just Wish passing.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Roserade resists Scald, is immune to Toxic, threatens super effective STAB Grass moves, and can set up Spikes on Alomomola. Shaymin also resists Alomomola's STAB, shakes off Toxic with Natural Cure, and can start spamming Seed Flare. Scald does little to Raikou, so it can come in and try to either set up on Alomomola or start attacking without a boost. Zapdos also can come in easily and start throwing around powerful STAB Thunderbolts, but it and Raikou must be wary of switching in on Toxic or a Scald burn. Swords Dance Heracross utilizes Guts to make Toxic a blessing and can boost to get past Alomomola's massive bulk. Crobat is immune to Toxic and can use Taunt, Brave Bird, and Roost to stop Alomomola's attempts at stall. Almost any setup sweeper can use Alomomola as a chance to set up a sweep, as it has very little offensive presence.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The goal of this set is to provide your team with healing via Wish, as well as security against many physical attackers. Alomomola can reliably switch into almost any physical attacker that lacks a boosting move, including Choice Scarf Heracross, Weavile without Swords Dance, Darmanitan, Victini, and even Choice Band Flygon. Once in, Alomomola can use Wish then switch out, healing itself with Regenerator and a teammate with Wish. Staying in for too long is dangerous, as Alomomola can easily become setup bait due to its weak offenses. Wish's gargantuan health boosts can keep teammates healthy and are a great boon for balance or semi-stall teams. Protect allows Alomomola to scout the opponent's moves, grab a Wish without taking two hits, and stall out Toxic or burn damage. Toxic helps Alomomola stall the many physical attackers it walls and weakens the opponent's team if it hits a potential attacker, such as Raikou or Zapdos, on the switch. Scald, though it comes off Alomomola's weaker attacking stat, prevents it from being complete setup bait for physical setup sweepers.</p> <p>Alomomola's typing and stats favor physical defense, so that is maximized in order to wall physical attackers. Leftovers provides great passive recovery when combined with Regenerator and Protect and is easily the best item for the set. Snorlax is a great partner because it can take any special attack and has the ability to phaze with Whirlwind, which Alomomola lacks. Umbreon and Roserade are also great partners as they both have great Special Defense as well. Umbreon has higher Special Defense, but Roserade offers resistances to both Alomomola's weaknesses, namely Electric- and Grass-type attacks. Roserade can also set up Spikes, which complements Alomomola's ability to force out physical attackers as they will repeatedly take passive damage. Both can clear status conditions, which Alomomola greatly appreciates as Toxic and burn both reduce its longevity.</p> "

  "Galvantula": {
    "overview": "<p>Game Freak has created yet another fast-but-frail Electric-type, but unlike the others, Galvantula has a few tricks up its sleeve (claws?) to set it apart from the rest of the pack. The name of the game is Thunder; a move that is otherwise useless outside of rain due to its piss-poor accuracy, but sees use due to Galvantula's semi exclusive ability, Compound Eyes. Compound Eyes raises Thunder's accuracy to nice a 91%, which ends up giving Galvantula some serious firepower. On top of having an awesome Thunder, it gets incredible coverage; it hits everything in UU for at least neutral damage. Unfortunately, Galvantula is not without its drawbacks. The main catch is that Galvantula's defenses downright suck. One good hit and it's finished, and to add insult to injury, it has a Stealth Rock weakness! Despite this, Galvantula is ultimately a good Pokemon that moves fast and hits hard. If you can manage to set up entry hazards, your opponent will struggle trying to get a handle on this electric spider.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If you're desperate, Choice Scarf is always an option for Galvantula, but Raikou and Zapdos are perpetually better at pulling it off. Disable can have its uses, but Galvantula can't afford to take any stray hits and it's almost always better off attacking instead. Sucker Punch can be used to pick off weakened threats that are faster than Galvantula, and it's admittedly an unexpected tactic that can prove useful at times. Still, Galvantula is naturally fast, and its Sucker Punch is not too threatening coming off a base 77 Attack stat with no investment. Spider Web can trap foes, but it is just as flawed as Disable; Galvantula should never waste any turns by not attacking. Electroweb is Galvantula's signature move, but unfortunately, the only thing cool about this move is its name. Don't expect to get much mileage out of any of these moves: they're in Other Options for a reason!</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>No matter what you do, Snorlax will stop Galvantula in its tracks with its patented special tanking skills. It can seriously cripple Galvantula with Body Slam or Return (or outright OHKO if it's running a Choice Band), and it can even outmaneuver Galvantula and trap it with Pursuit. Other than that, there isn't another Pokemon in UU that 100% counters Galvantula. Standard Electric-type checks such as Rhyperior, Swampert, and Gligar will fall against the right coverage move. Even the omnipresent Flygon can't switch in willy-nilly because on top of Hidden Power Ice OHKOing it, Bug Buzz does heavy damage to it. This makes Galvantula sound unstoppable, but in reality, there are multiple ways of stopping it outside of outright countering it. Strong priority moves will usually kill it as its defenses are dirt poor. Extreme Speed from offensive Arcanine and Aqua Jet from Azumarill both do heavy damage to Galvantula, which makes them excellent checks down the line as the battle goes on. Strong Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Krookodile are also good at getting a handle on Galvantula because they can OHKO Galvantula with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage. The above two Pokemon should avoid directly switching in however, unless you know an Electric-type move is coming. If you can stack entry hazards against the player using Galvantula, they'll have a hard time using it due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and pitiful defenses.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Thunder with a Compound Eyes boost to its accuracy is the ultimate trump card, and it lets Galvantula strike down foes with the fury of Zeus himself. Absolutely nothing in UU likes taking a 120 Base Power STAB Electric-type move, and despite Galvantula's relatively humble Special Attack stat, Thunder will be doing some major damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Bug Buzz complements Thunder by getting excellent damage against most of the Electric-type resists that reside in UU. Bug Buzz is another useful tool that Galvantula has over other Electric-types, because they mostly rely on Hidden Power for coverage against Electric-type resists. Hidden Power Ice provides Galvantula with even more coverage (pseudo BoltBeam) and is absolutely required for dealing with Flygon and Gligar. The former is still hit hard by Bug Buzz, but Flygon commonly sport Choice Scarf, so taking them out in one shot is preferred. Gligar can comfortably sponge Galvantula's attacks and ends up turning it into a liability by setting up hazards or getting a chance to Roost, so using Hidden Power Ice can deter it from getting in any free turns. As if those two coverage moves alone weren't enough, Galvantula also gets Energy Ball, which allows it to put the hurt on Swampert and Rhyperior. Energy Ball might seem redundant given the above coverage moves, but consider the fact that Swampert is rarely 2HKOed by Bug Buzz, and while Rhyperior may take super effective damage from Hidden Power Ice, it's not nearly enough to put it down. On the other hand, Substitute over Energy Ball will ruin teams that solely rely on checks to deal with Galvantula. The loss in coverage means that Swampert and Rhyperior are more of a threat, so a greater reliance on entry hazards is needed to wear them down.</p> <p>Galvantula can opt to use Choice Specs for a major boost in power. That great power comes with a price: the inability to switch moves. On top of making Galvantula noticeably easier to counter, donning a Choice Specs will force you switch Galvantula out more, which isn't a good idea considering its weakness to Stealth Rock. An Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice set, but there are a few things to consider before doing so. Galvantula isn't nearly common enough in UU to pull off a bluff, and you're better of using Life Orb and its extra power anyway. It's so frail that the recoil from Life Orb is a non-factor. Volt Switch is an option for the players who want their Galvantula to act as pseudo scout, and is particularly useful on a Choice set. Galvantula can use Charge Beam as an attack to finish off weakened Pokemon while simultaneously boosting its own Special Attack. As a bonus, Compound Eyes turns Charge Beam into a 100% accurate move, so you only really have to worry about whether or not Charge Beam will end up boosting your attack. With that said, Charge Beam is a mediocre option at best, and should not be seriously considered.</p> <p>Despite having a large number of things going for it, life isn't all good for the itzy bitzy spider. Snorlax and its mammoth special tanking ability will halt Galvantula in its tracks every single time. Snorlax can smash Galvantula with Body Slam or even deal heavy damage with Pursuit as it flees. If you see Snorlax in Team Preview, steer clear until you're ready to take it on. Strong Fighting-types are appreciated as partners because they can put Snorlax in its place. Heracross and Machamp are good at crushing Snorlax with their strong STAB Fighting-type moves (just watch out for Choice Band Body Slam / Return). The key to doing well with Galvantula is littering the battlefield with entry hazards to wear down the opposing team and using Galvantula as a cleaner late-game. Opposing teams will jump over hoops trying to check Galvantula in these conditions. Roserade or Qwilfish with Spikes and a Stealth Rock user of your choice are excellent at creating the perfect battle condition for Galvantula. Rapid Spin support is recommended if you want to preserve Galvantula as Stealth Rock and Life Orb will quickly eat away at Galvantula's life otherwise. Blastoise gets top honors because it's the undisputed best Rapid Spin user in the tier, and it can check a few Pokemon that give Galvantula trouble such as Choice Scarf Flygon and a healthy Rhyperior.</p> "

Ferroseed's main issue stems from its terrible base 50 Attack, leaving it to become setup bait to even some of the bulky Water-types it's supposed to counter. Despite this flaw, thanks to its great typing and support movepool, Ferroseed can be a great supporter in UU.</p> ",

Gravity is useful on dedicated teams that need it, but Ferroseed's other support options largely outclass it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Ferroseed has great defenses and typing, Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon, Heracross and Victini in particular, can destroy it easily. Boosting sweepers, Cobalion and Suicune for instance, can also set up on Ferroseed and proceed to sweep.

Spikes is a superb supporting move, limiting the number of times the opponent can switch while also helping many sweepers obtain OHKOs that they would miss otherwise. If your team already has a Spikes user, you may run Stealth Rock in its place. Leech Seed is used as Ferroseed's main form of recovery, and it also discourages Pokemon from setting up on Ferroseed. Thunder Wave is the primary option in the third slot, crippling fast setup sweepers, such as Cobalion and Weavile, trying to use it as fodder, and enabling a sweep for your own slower sweepers, particularly Togekiss. Protect is a possible secondary option that allows Ferroseed to scout opposing Choice users and gain Leech Seed recovery. In the last slot, Gyro Ball is used to hit many sweepers relatively hard and prevents Ferroseed from being crippled by Taunt.</p> <p>Although the main spread is specially defensive, one may opt to use either a physically defensive spread or split EVs for a mixed wall. Toxic is a viable option over Gyro Ball to cripple many walls and quickly end an opponent's sweep due to the fact that Ferroseed's Gyro Ball is not powerful enough. Because this set is meant to set up entry hazards, a spinblocker, namely Dusclops or Mismagius, is useful to prevent the entry hazards from being spun away. Pokemon that enjoy entry hazard support, such as Weavile, make great partners for Ferroseed, as do phazers such as Suicune and Donphan, who can rack up entry hazard damage on the opponent. Bulky Water-types, particularly Slowbro, make great partners for Ferroseed, as they can take the powerful Fire- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Ferroseed, while it can take the Electric- or Grass-type attacks aimed at said Water-type. Due to Ferroseed's weak offenses, a revenge killer is recommended, as practically everything can use Ferroseed as setup bait.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>In a tier home to many powerful Electric-types, such as Zapdos, Raikou, and Rotom-H, you would be forgiven for wondering why one would even consider using the seemingly inferior Eelektross. However, Eelektross's unique qualities, namely its colorful movepool that most Electric-type Pokemon would kill for, lack of weaknesses thanks to Levitate, and its ability to attack both physically and specially, help to differentiate it from its fellow electrical brethren. Eelektross is not without faults though, as it is painfully slow, especially for an Electric-type, and it lacks reliable recovery, which puts a real damper on its longevity and ability to take advantage of its above-average bulk. In spite of this, Eelektross has the potential to pose a real threat to any UU team. Its incredible coverage moves along with the stats to use them effectively mean that you will often be hard pressed to find a safe switch-in for it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although the moves already listed are the ones that you will almost always want to be using, one of Eelektross's prides and joys is its impressive movepool, and it would be unfair not to at least highlight its other usable options. Acid Spray can be used to gain a pseudo-Nasty Plot boost or force switches. Charge Beam is Eelektross's only method of boosting its Special Attack, though it is a somewhat unreliable and very weak method of doing so. Discharge has a higher paralysis rate than Thunderbolt, but Eelektross requires all the help it can get when it comes to special attacking power, so the latter is generally a better pick. Fire Punch can be used on physical sets to have an easier time against Bronzong. Knock Off, Light Screen, and Roar are all decent support moves which Eelektross can get some mileage out of, but better Pokemon exist for the use of such moves. Super Fang breaks down sturdier walls that Eelektross struggles with, but you will be hard pressed to find a good spot for it on most movesets. U-turn and Volt Switch can be used to scout switch-ins, but Eelektross is better off attacking most of the time. Zap Cannon can work in conjunction with Coil, but it is mostly inefficient, and outside of the accuracy boost, the two moves do not synergize well. Avoid using Choice items on Eelektross, as its strengths lie in its fantastic coverage and ability to switch between moves, making it difficult to straight up wall. Lastly, if you're feeling comedic you can always give Magnet Rise a whirl; throw an Air Balloon into the mix, and Eelektross will give Rotom-S a real run for its money!</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Against the specially oriented offensive set, as long as Superpower is not present, specially defensive Pokemon such as Umbreon and Snorlax are safe bets, taking little from its attacks and retaliating with Toxic, Payback, or Foul Play in Umbreon's case or a Normal-type move of choice in Snorlax's. Porygon2 is in a similar category as these two, but its superior physical bulk means it does not even fear Superpower as much. Swampert does well against Coil sets, being able to Roar away any accumulated boosts if Eelektross lacks Dragon Tail or fish for a burn with Scald. Gligar can beat sets without Hidden Power Ice and Toxic stall Eelektross. Gligar can take on most Coil sets too, but a boosted Aqua Tail will hurt. Registeel can take pretty much anything Eelektross can throw at it, as not even Flamethrower will hurt it that much, and from there it can cripple with status and whittle away at Eelektross's HP with Seismic Toss. Offensively, Rotom-H stands out as a fine check, resisting most, if not all, of Eelektross's moves. It can roast Eelektross with its powerful STAB Overheat, or it can burn with Will-O-Wisp against Coil sets. It will have to be wary of Aqua Tail though. Flygon is another good offensive check, able to take anything Eelektross can muster save for Hidden Power Ice and retaliate with Outrage. Raikou can use specially based Eelektross as bait to start setting up Calm Minds, but will lose to Coil Eelektross if it attempts anything of the sort against it.</p> <p>Although relatively bulky for an offensive Pokemon, Eelektross can be taken out of commission by strong attacks such as Close Combat, Seed Flare, and V-create. Eelektross lacks reliable recovery, so repeated attacks will eventually dispose of it. Toxic also helps immensely.</p> ",

Thunderbolt is the STAB of choice here, powering through any non-defensive Pokemon that does not resist it. Flamethrower keeps Grass-types away, while roasting Bronzong hoping to sponge Thunderbolt. Giga Drain helps to stave off the likes of Rhyperior and Golurk, netting a clean 2HKO on both while OHKOing Swampert with ease, and the additional healing it provides adds to its usefulness. However, if you feel that Rhyperior is a real thorn in your side, Grass Knot is a great alternative as it will OHKO the standard tank set 100% of the time. The final move depends on which additional Pokemon you wish to take on with Eelektross. Superpower is the recommended choice as it allows Eelektross to heavily injure Snorlax, UU's premier special wall, while also dealing good damage to Umbreon, who, like Snorlax, does not fear any of the other moves on this set. Hidden Power Ice is definitely an option though, as it is Eelektross's best shot at reasonably damaging Nidoking and Nidoqueen as well as the rare Druddigon, and it OHKOes Flygon and Gligar, both of whom can otherwise tank or wall this set respectively. Effective execution of this moveset relies on both good timing and prediction, in particular when utilizing Superpower. Avoid using Superpower recklessly—instead, try to wear down counters first, then anticipate the right moment to strike.</p> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item as it suits the offensive nature of the set, providing useful boosts on neutral hits. Expert Belt allows for somewhat more longevity, but outside of super effective hits, the power is rather lackluster. The listed EVs are geared to maximize offense, while investing a little in bulk to improve Eelektross's ability to take hits and giving enough Speed to outrun defensive base 60 Speed Pokemon when running a Modest nature. Sets with Superpower should be run with a Quiet nature. Mild is an option if the Speed drop of Quiet is unfavorable, allowing Eelektross to outspeed defensive Pokemon such as Empoleon, Swampert, and Porygon2. While the Speed to outpace and strike Porygon2 with a Superpower first is appealing, the reduced Defense that comes with a Mild nature is a hindrance to an otherwise naturally bulky Pokemon such as Eelektross, and Porygon2 can still potentially beat Eelektross with good prediction. Eelektross suffers in the Speed department, so paralysis support is useful in turning it into an even bigger threat. Good inducers of paralysis and teammates for Eelektross include Togekiss and Slowbro. Togekiss can administer paralysis via Thunder Wave or Body Slam. Togekiss tends to struggle with Steel-types, which Eelektross can hit hard with a timely Flamethrower. Slowbro, on the other hand, can tank most physical attacks aimed at Eelektross while dishing out Thunder Waves when the opportunity arises. Slowbro can also set up Trick Room to support Eelektross on teams based around that strategy. As with most offensive Pokemon, Eelektross very much appreciates entry hazards. Qwilfish is a great teammate as it has access to Thunder Wave and Spikes, and it enjoys having Eelektross take Ground-type attacks aimed at it and maim the common Blastoise that otherwise Rapid Spins with ease on Qwilfish. Offensively, Pokemon that benefit from having special walls in pieces pair well with Eelektross. Raikou will appreciate the damage done and can use it to pave the way towards a sweep. Victini is another good candidate, as it desperately needs Snorlax out of the way in order to go to town, and a weakened Umbreon is always helpful for it.</p> <p>An alternative faster spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Hasty or Timid nature, depending on whether you are running Superpower or not (shift the 4 Attack EVs to Special Defense if running Timid), can be used in order to outspeed a number of key defensive walls such as Gligar and Suicune. Use only Life Orb with the faster spreads, as Expert Belt will not provide enough power. A spread of 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD with a 0 Speed IV should be used when running Eelektross on a Trick Room team.</p> "

        "description": "<p>The users of Coil are few and far between, and even less common are those that can use the move well. Fortunately, Eelektross just so happens to be one of the best. After a few Coils, Eelektross will not only become a threat offensively, but a pain to break on the defensive side too. Thunder Punch, while disappointing in Base Power, is the key STAB move here. Wild Charge boasts more power, but its recoil runs counter to the more conservative nature of the set. Drain Punch is incredibly useful, aiding coverage and providing some much needed healing while proving useful against Pokemon such as Cobalion, Snorlax, Umbreon, and Registeel. Dragon Tail is handy in that it repels attempts to phaze Eelektross via Roar or Whirlwind while also doubling as a phazing method of your own should the need arise. Aqua Tail should not be written off, however, as it allows Eelektross to hold its own against Ground-types, such as Gligar, Rhyperior, and Claydol, while also beating Rotom-H whose auspicious typing grants it the ability to otherwise wall Eelektross with ease. Regardless of which fourth move you decide to choose, the icing on the cake is that the imperfect accuracy of both moves is patched up after just one use of Coil.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and the given EVs maximize Eelektross's ability to sponge special hits as it attempts to boost its physical defenses while providing the offensive kick to start dealing serious damage after just one Coil. As this set aims to stick around for a while and accumulate boosts, Leftovers is a perfect fit. Paralysis support is always helpful for Eelektross, but what this set really dislikes is status, namely Toxic and burns, so a way to either handle or sponge status is required to get the most out of it. Togekiss is a fine teammate in this regard, being able to support with Heal Bell, while Eelektross can weather Electric-type attacks aimed at Togekiss. Umbreon can also Heal Bell, and it can also pass Eelektross Wishes to restore lost HP. Roserade and Shaymin both have access to Aromatherapy to help Eelektross out as well. Roserade gets a particularly strong mention for its ability to also provide hazards that Eelektross can take advantage of. Taking a more offensive slant, Swords Dance Heracross is a fantastic partner, absorbing status that Eelektross attracts and benefiting from it thanks to Guts. Swords Dance Heracross is also able to overcome Gligar, which this Eelektross has difficulties with, while Eelektross deals with Flying-types, such as Zapdos and Crobat, which Heracross detests. Darmanitan also teams up well offensively with Eelektross. Darmanitan's immense offensive power can be used to smash through the opposition, while Eelektross can switch in on Earthquakes thrown Darmanitan's way and can bait out and injure counters, such as Rhyperior, with a boosted Aqua Tail while using its STAB Electric-type moves to keep Water-types at bay.</p> "

Accelgor maintains a usable base 100 Special Attack stat with decent coverage options and is able to punish Rapid Spin users that try to switch in on it. However, the rest of Accelgor's stats are deplorable, and it carries a crippling Stealth Rock weakness. Despite its frailty and weakness to Stealth Rock, Accelgor is an underrated threat that is capable of setting up on many Pokemon while being able to throw its weight around, and should be considered when building offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydration and Rest can be used on teams that include Rain Dance Kingdra or Tornadus, but Accelgor will be hard-pressed to find something to safely Rest against. Moves such as Acid Armor, Encore, Recover, and Substitute all provide tenuous answers to Accelgor's terrible defenses, but due to the offensive nature of the Underused tier, Accelgor will find it next to impossible to make any use out of them. Accelgor also has access to Sludge Bomb and Energy Ball, which are the only other offensive moves worth noting in Accelgor's shallow movepool.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Beating Accelgor is extremely easy if Stealth Rock is on the field, as the 25% cut in HP is a death sentence to it, giving even weaker Pokemon the opportunity to KO Accelgor. Prankster Taunt users, specifically Sableye and Tornadus, are solid shut-downs to the suicide Spiker set, bypassing Accelgor's impressive Speed stat and preventing it from using Spikes. However, they must watch out for the all-out attacker set, as Accelgor will blow through them with its powerful attacks. Snorlax and Porygon2 are exceptionally reliable checks to Accelgor, as their saturated special bulk allows them to tank hits from Accelgor all day while dealing severe damage back. Mismagius and other Ghost-types don't fear any of Accelgor's moves, can switch in with impunity, and can deliver hefty amounts of damage via Shadow Ball and other coverage moves. Faster Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Raikou, Flygon, Darmanitan, and Heracross, can outspeed Accelgor and carry strong STAB or coverage moves capable of crushing it. Hitmontop is also a solid check to Accelgor, as it can basically switch in for free and spin away Spikes. However, Hitmontop must watch out for the odd Final Gambit, as it will be OHKOed.</p> ",

The given EVs maximize Accelgor's phenomenal Speed while making good use of its base 100 Special Attack, allowing it to do some damage to the opposition. Spikes is the main reason why you'd ever want to use Accelgor, as it provides excellent team support by removing up to 25% of a grounded opponent's HP. Bug Buzz provides some offensive STAB, dealing sufficient damage to targets such as Shaymin, Weavile, and Azelf. Focus Blast provides decent coverage alongside Bug Buzz, allowing Accelgor to muscle its way through Steel-, Fighting-, and Fire-type opponents, such as Registeel, Hitmontop, and Arcanine. The last slot is preference-based, as Yawn can force a switch, giving Accelgor more time to set up a second layer of Spikes. Alteratively, U-turn allows Accelgor to scout the opposing team and gives it the chance to deploy Spikes later in the match.</p> <p>The choice of Accelgor's ability is a safety preference thing, as Sticky Hold prevents Trick users from breaking Accelgor with ease, while Unburden ensures that Accelgor will be outspeeding anything bar priority moves, almost guaranteeing a second layer of Spikes. However, if Focus Sash fails to activate, so will Unburden. Final Gambit may be considered in the fourth slot, as it allows Accelgor to sacrifice itself against Rapid Spin users, prevent a Rapid Spin, and bring in a new Pokemon to check the spinner, thus ensuring that the hazards are not removed. However, if opting for Final Gambit, Accelgor should run max HP in order to deal as much damage to the opposing spinner as possible. Giga Drain is also a viable option for Accelgor in the fourth slot, as it hits Blastoise for solid damage while keeping Accelgor relatively healthy.</p> <p>If opting for U-turn in the fourth slot, a Pokemon with access to Rapid Spin, such as Blastoise or Hitmontop, makes for a great teammate, as it will prevent multiple layers of hazards from accumulating, which would heavily reduce Accelgor's already shaky staying power. Raikou, Darmanitan, and Zapdos make for good teammates, as they can muscle their way past Prankster Sableye and Prankster Tornadus, who otherwise shut this set down with ease. Because of Accelgor's non-existent defenses, bulkier teammates that can take hits aimed at Accelgor are greatly appreciated. Houndoom and Arcanine can absorb Fire-type attacks aimed at Accelgor, while a generally bulky Pokemon, such as Suicune, Snorlax, and Cofagrigus, can help stomach other hits. Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Cofagrigus, Golurk, and Mismagius, also make for excellent teammates, as they can block opposing Rapid Spins that would otherwise render Accelgor's efforts useless. Pokemon with grounded checks, such as Raikou and Zapdos, also benefit from being paired with Accelgor, as its multiple layers of Spikes helps wear down opposing Swampert and Rhyperior. Both Raikou and Zapdos also have the advantage of keeping the most popular spinner, Blastoise, off the field with their Electric-type STAB.</p> "

Bug Buzz is its STAB move, dealing hefty chunks of damage to Psychic-, Dark-, and Grass-type Pokemon, such as Slowbro, Sableye, and Roserade.

Accelgor appreciates being paired up with a Weavile or Houndoom, as it struggles to get past many Ghost-type Pokemon due to its shallow movepool.

Its Attack stat matches that of the mighty Heracross, but its STAB, High Jump Kick, is actually stronger than Close Combat, meaning Mienshao actually out-damages Heracross. To make matters even better, two of its abilities make High Jump Kick even scarier. On one hand, we have Regenerator, which ensures that Mienshao can afford to miss and not die from recoil. On the other, we have Reckless, which takes an already obscenely powerful move and boosts it by another 20% to an astounding 156 Base Power. On top of all this, its decent base 95 Special Attack allows it to also use special moves to defeat its would-be counters, such as Gligar. However, its defenses are downright terrible, sitting at a mere 65 / 60 / 60; even resisted STAB attacks will do a considerable amount of damage. Mienshao also has to rely on inaccurate moves for damage; something you must keep in mind when using this monster.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Because of Mienshao's rather eclectic movepool, filler moves such as Knock Off, Taunt, Reflect, and Toxic can be used if desired in many of Mienshao's fourth slots. A specially attacking set running Aura Sphere, Grass Knot, Hidden Power, and a filler move can be used as an effective lure, catching many of its common checks off-guard. In the same manner, a Calm Mind set might seem tempting, but is far less effective than standard physical sets, and therefore isn't recommended. Mienshao also has access to Payback, which might seem useful for getting past threats such as Cofagrigus and Slowbro, but its above-average Speed stat is too fast to effectively use the move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ghost-types, especially Cofagrigus and Sableye, are the best switch-ins to any Mienshao set, as they are immune to High Jump Kick, take paltry damage from Mienshao's other attacks, and can burn Mienshao, rendering it useless for the rest of the match. Bulky Pokemon that carry a resistance to Mienshao's Fighting-type STAB, such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Qwilfish, are also great checks to Mienshao, as they can effectively stomach most anything Mienshao throws their way. Gligar also makes an effective shutdown to Mienshao, but will be 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ice, which most sets run. Pokemon such as Crobat and Zapdos can take an unboosted High Jump Kick with ease, but must be weary of a super effective Stone Edge being hurled their way. Pokemon found in lower tiers, such as Amoonguss, can beat Mienshao through sleep or paralysis.

This has led to Mienshao undeniably becoming one of the better Choice Scarf users in the tier, on par with the likes of Flygon and Darmanitan, with its only drawback being the unreliability of its two main attacks. High Jump Kick is Mienshao's foremost STAB move; it's ridiculously powerful even unboosted, especially if you opt for Reckless. U-turn acts as an effective offensive pivot and momentum grabber, working in tandem with Regenerator to restore Mienshao's HP. Stone Edge offers coverage on Pokemon such as Crobat and Zapdos. In the fourth slot, Aerial Ace provides an additional check to one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier, Heracross, as well as a way to revenge kill Virizion, Roserade, and opposing Mienshao without relying on High Jump Kick. However, Hidden Power Ice attains coverage on Gligar, which would otherwise turn Mienshao into dead weight by continuously switching into its other attacks with impunity.</p> <p>The EVs maximize offenses and Speed. An alternate spread of 252 Atk / 40 SpA / 216 Spe is also usable, as it buffs Hidden Power slightly without missing out on outspeeding anything important. A Naive nature should be used if running Hidden Power, keeping the move as strong as possible with only minimum investment. The choice between Reckless and Regenerator comes down to the argument of power and sustainability; do you need Mienshao to decimate opponents with the click of a button, or would you rather be more conservative and have a backup plan in case Mienshao misses with High Jump Kick? Keep in mind that Reckless does some nifty things, such as ensuring an OHKO versus 0/0 Flygon after Stealth Rock. If neither Aerial Ace or Hidden Power Ice prove to be effective, Toxic can be run in the fourth slot to help Mienshao's teammates break through sturdy walls.</p> <p>Because Mienshao is designed to primarily function as a revenge killer, it doesn't really require teammates. However, Dark- or Ghost-type Pokemon, such as Bisharp or Cofagrigus, are effective teammates for Mienshao as they can eliminate opposing Ghost-type Pokemon that can otherwise freely switch in on High Jump Kick. Pokemon that benefit from Mienshao pivoting out of the likes of Slowbro and Sableye, such as Raikou and Tornadus, can also make good teammates for Mienshao, as they can use the momentum shift to generate opportunities to set up and begin their sweeps.</p> "

U-turn lets Mienshao chip away at its counters while giving you momentum and has excellent synergy with Regenerator. Stone Edge lets it deal with many foes that resist its STAB, primarily Zapdos, Xatu, and Crobat. Hidden Power Ice gets around Gligar, one of Mienshao's would-be counters, as it is able to finish it off over 90% of the time assuming it switches into High Jump Kick while Stealth Rock is on the field.</p> <p>The choice between Mienshao's two great abilities, Regenerator and Reckless, comes down to longevity versus a considerable increase in power to Mienshao's STAB. While Regenerator helps it stay alive for a very long time, Reckless does some cool things, such as ensuring a 2HKO on 252/252+ Swampert after Stealth Rock damage. The given EV spread simply maximizes Mienshao's fantastic offensive capabilities, but you can choose to drop this set's Speed down to 330 (using 216 EVs) with no consequence other than giving up the Speed tie against opposing Mienshao and the odd Mismagius. However, the added bulk or Special Attack that it would get out of doing so isn't usually worth it. If Gligar isn't an issue for you, Mienshao can also use other moves such as Grass Knot and Fake Out over Hidden Power Ice. Keep in mind, however, that Grass Knot fails to OHKO 252 HP Rhyperior (as does Reckless High Jump Kick) and Swampert, nor does it 2HKO Slowbro. Fake Out is even less useful, as it lacks any sort of boost and gives your opponent an opportunity to virtually switch something in for free. Should you choose not to use special moves on this set, you should use a Jolly nature and move the 4 Special Attack EVs to Special Defense to prevent Download users from getting Special Attack boost, should they come in to revenge kill Mienshao. Choice Band is also a usable item on this set, but keep in mind that Regenerator will more than make up for Life Orb recoil and that Choice Band fails to boost Mienshao's special moves.</p> <p>This set works fairly well on almost any balanced or offensive team, and there are a few partners that work especially well with it. Due to its frailty, Mienshao will appreciate opportunities to come in without receiving any damage, which makes slower U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Gligar and Rotom-C, good partners. The latter is especially useful, as it takes advantage of a couple of Mienshao's counters, namely Slowbro and Slowking. Choice Scarf Moxie Heracross is a great offensive partner, as Mienshao usually weakens its counters enough to allow it to sweep late-game.

Druddigon also gets access to Glare, making it a more than viable addition to a team looking for a reliable paralysis inducer. It does have its problems though, as its lack of reliable recovery coupled with only average defensive stats mean that Druddigon can get worn down and defeated fairly quickly. Another problem is that while it does have a great Attack stat, it doesn't have the Speed or movepool necessary in order to sweep properly. That being said, Druddigon's bulk, unique mono-Dragon typing, high Attack stat, and access to support moves such as Stealth Rock and Glare make it a worthy replacement over Flygon or Kingdra for many teams.</p> ",

Life Orb can be used over Choice Band, but the drop of power and the diminishing HP is noticeable. Toxic can be used over Dragon Claw on the paralysis shuffler set, but it will get more use out of having a reliable attack. The same goes for using both Roar and Dragon Tail on the same set, as this makes Druddigon a great phazer and can prevent any manner of setup, be it Taunt or Substitute. Druddigon also receives gimmicky options such as Torment and Protect, which can annoy the opponent and force more switches if you like, but this is far less effective than paralysis shuffling. Hone Claws can also be used as a way of boosting Druddigon's Attack stat without locking it into a single move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Druddigon's counters are entirely dependent on the set. For the paralysis shuffler set, the best course of action is to either use Taunt or Substitute. Substitute prevents your Pokemon from being shuffled by Dragon Tail and blocks Glare, while Taunt stops Stealth Rock, Glare, and Roar. Suicune in general is a good counter to Druddigon with its huge bulk and access to Ice Beam, as well as always being faster. If you can get them in unharmed, both Kingdra and Flygon will KO Druddigon with Outrage (Flygon doesn't KO with Dragon Claw against the paralysis shuffler). Porygon2 can status Druddigon and hit it with Ice Beam, making a decent counter for both sets. Steel-types are good counters to Druddigon in general, but against the Choice Band set you definitely have to be wary of Earthquake. The Choice Band set can be predicted around though, as Outrage has the side effect of being locked into it and Earthquake can be sponged by Flying-type Pokemon. Sucker Punch fails if the opponent doesn't attack as well, so Druddigon can be used as setup bait quite easily.</p> ",

Sucker Punch is there for priority, and can be used primarily as a way to bypass Druddigon's terrible Speed. It also helps by KOing fast sweepers such as Azelf and Raikou easily, and can even pick off Heracross if it has used Close Combat.

Sheer Force and Fire Punch can be used but are overall less effective than Earthquake and Mold Breaker. As far as teammates go, this set is great at getting past most opposing walls, so a Pokemon that can benefit from this would be in your best interest. Heracross can be a good teammate as it appreciates having common physical walls such as Bronzong, Blastoise, and Slowbro weakened, allowing it to possibly start up a Moxie sweep. In fact, most strong physical attackers benefit from Druddigon's presence simply because there aren't many that can take a barrage of attacks from such a combination. On top of this, Spikes and Stealth Rock are very beneficial thanks to their ability to turn 2HKOs into OHKOs and 3HKOs into 2HKOs, so Scolipede becomes a good teammate. Bronzong resists all of Druddigon's weaknesses and can set up Stealth Rock while wearing down the enemy with Toxic.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set is surprisingly effective at coming in on physical attackers, setting up Stealth Rock, and shuffling the team around for extra hazard damage. When coupled with Rough Skin, this makes for an annoying way for passive damage to be put onto the opponent's Pokemon, and can help wear down Pokemon to the point where a sweep can be initiated. Dragon Tail racks up extra residual damage on the foe by forcing switches as well as hitting it, whilst Roar is more useful for its perfect accuracy and hitting through Substitute. Glare paralyzes the enemy, possibly prolonging Druddigon's and its teammates' lives, as well as letting Druddigon gain the much-needed advantage in Speed. Dragon Claw is there as a fourth move in order to dish out extra damage, and serves as a reliable STAB move. Leftovers is the preferred item here, but Rocky Helmet can be used if you want to spread more damage at the cost of survivability.</p> <p>The EVs above maximize Druddigon's physical bulk, letting it take physical hits effectively from anything that isn't super effective against it. You can place more EVs in Attack if you want, but this is not recommended as a Druddigon in this role best serves as a shuffler, not an attacker. As you can probably imagine, this set loves entry hazards on the opposing side of the field, so a Spikes user and a Ghost-type Pokemon are necessary to really make the most out of this set. Scolipede can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and can deal heavy damage to Kingdra and Flygon with Megahorn. Qwilfish is a good teammate as it resists Ice as well, whereas Dusclops can take any hit aimed at Druddigon while performing well as a bulky spinblocker. Finally, Steel-types make for good teammates thanks to their resistance to Dragon-type attacks.</p> "

  "Golurk": {
    "overview": "<p>Golurk is one of the Pokemon that gained a lot of new toys in the transition to BW2. The addition of Stealth Rock and the elemental punches to its movepool only makes Golurk more diverse than it once was. It stands out from the rest of its fully-evolved Ghost-type brethren with a unique Ground / Ghost typing, bringing with it STAB Earthquake as well as a titanic base 124 Attack. A great ability in Iron Fist complements its decent physical movepool, boosting a number of its moves including Shadow Punch and Fire Punch. These qualities allow Golurk to hit like a truck while also having moderate utility in Stealth Rock and spinblocking. Its typing also provides many neat resistances, allowing it to take on the likes of Heracross and Mienshao with ease.</p> <p>Unfortunately, like any other Pokemon, Golurk does suffer from quite a few drawbacks that hold it back. The biggest problem with Golurk is its poor base 55 Speed. Additionally, its bulk, while good, is not great, meaning a couple of hits can take it down relatively easily; this is compounded by its lack of reliable recovery and its myriad of weaknesses to common attacking types, such as Water, Grass, and Dark, which limit its ability to survive on the battlefield.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Golurk has quite a few other options in its movepool other than those listed above. Hammer Arm might seem like a good option because it is boosted by Iron Fist, but it has redundant coverage with Earthquake. Rock Polish is a decent way to attempt to transform Golurk into a sweeper; however, Golurk is too slow to utilize it effectively. A SubPunch set is powerful, but Machamp and Heracross do it better; moreover, using Substitute on a tank is counterproductive. A Choice Band set with Earthquake, Shadow Punch, Fire Punch, Ice Punch or Thunder Punch, and an EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe, is also a possibility, and packs the power to OHKO or 2HKO the majority of the tier, but again, Golurk is too slow to pull it off effectively. Dynamic Punch seems like a good option as Golurk has No Guard, but Machamp outclasses it at this role, courtesy of having STAB on Dynamic Punch and a higher Attack stat. Last but not least, Golurk has Stone Edge; however, while it does provide near perfect coverage with Earthquake, it is generally outclassed by Ice Punch.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Dark-types, such as Scrafty, Weavile, and Krookodile, stand out as the best checks to Golurk. All three can hurt Golurk with their Dark-type STAB, while Weavile and Krookodile in particular can use Pursuit predicting Golurk to switch out. Bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Swampert, are not 2HKOed by any of Golurk's attacks and can retaliate with Scald or Waterfall. Roserade, Shaymin, and Virizion all threaten Golurk with their Grass-type STAB, but must be wary of an incoming Fire Punch, and Roserade of an Earthquake as well. Gligar also walls most Golurk to no end, but if it has Ice Punch, Gligar is in for trouble. Mismagius can outspeed Golurk and KO it with Shadow Ball, but can't switch in on Shadow Punch. Finally, Togekiss and Zapdos take little from any of Golurk's attacks, except Ice Punch and Stone Edge, and can use Air Slash and Hidden Power Ice, respectively, to damage it significantly.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<p>This is Golurk's best and only viable set in UU. Thanks to its decent 89 / 80 / 80 bulk, great resistances to Bug- , Rock-, and Poison-type attacks, as well as immunities to Normal-, Fighting-, and Electric-type onslaughts, Golurk can hold its own defensively despite being so slow. Golurk's own 124 base Attack ensures it is not a sitting duck either and allows it to fulfill its role as an offensive tank.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is the main move on this set, providing invaluable team support by limiting the opponent's switch-ins. Golurk is particularly good at setting it up, as not only do its resistances give it ample opportunities to do so, but its Ghost typing also allows it to spinblock, keeping Stealth Rock on the field. Earthquake is the obvious Ground-type STAB move of choice. Fire Punch is the needed coverage move; it complements Earthquake by hitting Grass-types, Heracross, and Bronzong super effectively, all of which resist or are immune to Earthquake. Shadow Punch is the second STAB move; it 2HKOes Slowbro, while also hitting Azelf and Mismagius for serious damage on the switch-in.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes HP and Attack to ensure Golurk can be a solid tank, providing much needed bulk and firepower. The remaining 4 EVs are invested into Special Defense to make sure that the odd Porygon2 does not obtain a Special Attack boost from Download. Leftovers is the preferred item here for its consistent recovery, which is needed for any tank. An Adamant nature is chosen here to provide the highest Attack stat attainable in order to KO certain targets. Alternatively, a more defensive EV spread is usable to make Golurk bulkier, but it generally needs all the Attack possible to be successful; for example, without max Attack, Golurk cannot KO Heracross with Fire Punch. Ice Punch and Thunder Punch are both decent options over Fire Punch to deal with Gligar and Suicune, respectively, but neither is too useful otherwise.</p> <p>Life Orb is usable if you want more power; however, the loss of HP is really detrimental to Golurk's role as a tank. Potential teammates for Golurk include Mienshao and Zapdos, as they can deal with Dark-types and Water-types, respectively. Crobat is also a decent choice to force out any Roserade, Shaymin, or Virizion that choose to switch in on Golurk.</p> "

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Before reading this overview, please take a second to see that Bisharp looks like a complete and utter badass. After taking a minute to bask in its glory, we can get to the analysis. Looks aside, Bisharp boasts the coveted Steel typing, granting it resistances to many common attacks. This is a major advantage for Bisharp, as we have seen many times before that a Steel typing can take a bad Pokemon and make it good, and take a good Pokemon and make it great. A high base Attack of 125 makes Bisharp an offensive powerhouse, which, when combined with Swords Dance, makes it even more menacing. Add a STAB Sucker Punch, one of the strongest priority moves in the game, and Bisharp is a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>That being said, Bisharp does have its flaws. Bisharp's low base Speed makes it so that anything that is faster and takes little damage from Sucker Punch can revenge kill it. Sucker Punch, although somewhat making up for this low Speed stat, is fairly unreliable, with many Pokemon being able to avoid it and cripple Bisharp with status, restore their HP, and so on. Bisharp also has unfortunate weaknesses to Fighting, Ground, and Fire, very common types in the UU tier. Bisharp is further harmed by the ever-increasing popularity of Fighting-types in UU, as even the weakest of Fighting-type moves will send it running for cover. Despite these flaws, if a Swords Dance boost is obtained, Bisharp becomes a monster and is very hard to stop if the opponent is not prepared.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bisharp has a fairly sparse movepool. That being said, it still has a few other tricks up its sleeve. Pursuit is a move that stands out, allowing Bisharp to trap and KO opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types. With access to Stealth Rock, a support set is a viable option. Bisharp should then use a more defensive EV spread along with the moves Stealth Rock, Sucker Punch, and Thunder Wave, among other useful support moves. This sort of set would allow Bisharp to showcase its high Defense stat and many resistances. Psycho Cut might be considered to deal with Fighting-types, but Iron Head deals around as much damage to them. A Choice set might seem a good idea for immediate power, however, a Choice-locked Sucker Punch is never a good idea due to its unreliability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Cobalion stands out as Bisharp's greatest counter, as it can come in on any move, outspeed, and murder Bisharp with its STAB Close Combat. Bisharp can only OHKO in return if it is at +2 and carries Low Kick. Bulky Water-types, such as Swampert and Milotic, can switch in on Swords Dance, take any one of Bisharp's boosted attacks, and hit hard in return with their attacking move of choice or, alternatively, use Haze or Dragon Tail to get rid of any boosts. Most Fighting-types in the UU tier can outspeed Bisharp or at least use Mach Punch, their super effective STAB moves easily dealing with Bisharp. Notable examples include the aforementioned Cobalion and Heracross. Because Sucker Punch is unreliable, exploiting it with Substitute is also ideal; Raikou and Mienshao are both excellent at doing this. Hitmontop seems like another good choice, but it needs to be careful, however, as Defiant causes Intimidate to boost Bisharp's Attack rather than dropping it.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>The goal of this set is simple. Begin by obtaining a Swords Dance boost. Throughout the following few turns, murder everything. It's really that simple. Swords Dance boosts Bisharp's Attack stat to legendary levels, allowing it to power through almost every Pokemon in the tier. Sucker Punch is used as Bisharp's main attack, boasting STAB and priority, as well as hitting extremely hard after a boost. While unreliable, it is an invaluable tool for Bisharp to threaten the many Pokemon that could otherwise revenge kill it.</p> <p>Substitute partners well with Sucker Punch, letting Bisharp take advantage of the turns where the opponent tries to avoid getting hit with Sucker Punch by using a non-damaging move, hence ending any mind games that may ensue after Bisharp has received a boost. In addition, having a Substitute up encourages the enemy to attack and break it, allowing for more opportunities to use Sucker Punch successfully. Low Kick is the best choice for the last move, achieving almost perfect neutral coverage in UU alongside Sucker Punch, missing out only on Heracross. Iron Head is a possibility for the last moveslot, being just as strong as Sucker Punch after STAB and much more reliable. In addition, after a Swords Dance, Iron Head obtains numerous KOs, assuming the opponent does not resist it and Bisharp outspeeds or is behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Maximum EVs are invested into Attack to allow Bisharp to obtain the highest possible damage output. An Adamant nature is chosen to hit even harder, especially considering that a Jolly nature does not allow Bisharp to outspeed anything noteworthy. 204 Speed EVs are used to outspeed defensive Arcanine and other base 95s, which is a good benchmark to hit. The remaining EVs are thrown into HP so Bisharp can better take advantage of its 100 base Defense and numerous resistances. Alternatively, the Speed EVs can be dropped to 128, which outruns 4 Speed Gligar, or to none, allowing Bisharp to invest more in HP. However, this leaves Bisharp outsped by numerous Pokemon and thus much easier to revenge kill. Low Kick is a better move than Brick Break, as it hits almost all of the Pokemon Brick Break covers for the same or greater damage. Notably, it lets Bisharp OHKO Registeel and Cobalion after a Swords Dance.</p> <p>Life Orb is a decent item choice, allowing Bisharp to hit even harder than it already does, but Leftovers is usually the better option, as Bisharp will be using Substitute quite often, and Leftovers heals off some of the health lost by each use of Substitute. If Life Orb is used, Night Slash is a solid alternative to Substitute, hitting Pokemon that try to use non-damaging moves with zero risk, though the real reason it is used over Substitute is that Substitute would use up too much HP in conjunction with Life Orb. Crobat, Cofagrigus, and Zapdos are good offensive partners, dealing with the Fighting-types that are troublesome to Bisharp with great ease. Roserade is also a good teammate, being able to deal with opposing bulky Water-types that give Bisharp issues and laying down Spikes that supplement Bisharp's sweep.</p> "

  "Bouffalant": {
    "overview": "<p>With an excellent base Attack stat of 110, access to Reckless, and an exclusive recoil move in Head Charge, Bouffalant can hit extremely hard. Bouffalant can also use Swords Dance to boost its Attack stat to sky-high levels, letting it hit even harder. It takes care of the most common physical walls in the tier, at worst 2HKOing them, and can outspeed and Taunt them, preventing them from doing much back. While Reckless makes Bouffalant the powerhouse that it is, it also has access to Sap Sipper, giving it immunity Grass-type moves, including Leech Seed and, crucially, to the most common sleep-inducing move, Sleep Powder. With this, Bouffalant also receives a welcome boost to its Attack stat.</p> <p>In addition to these assets, Bouffalant has great bulk too, with base 95 in all three defensive stats; therefore it takes little damage from weak attacks, and with screen support, takes minimal damage even from the strongest moves. Despite these strengths, Bouffalant is weak to the common Fighting-type moves and is pretty slow, often ending up a sitting duck while setting up. Even with these minor flaws, Bouffalant is still a great wallbreaker and can sweep late-game.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bouffalant doesn't have much else to use. Other moves it has access to are Retaliate, Iron Head, Poison Jab, Stone Edge, and Rock Slide, but they are inferior to the listed moves and don't cover anything the others don't. It can utilize its bulk to support a team, with access to both Sunny Day and Rain Dance, as well as Toxic, but there are several Pokemon that do this better. It also has access to Rest as its only form of recovery.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>To counter Bouffalant, it's best to send out a faster Pokemon while it's setting up or if a Pokemon has fainted. Heracross can easily KO Bouffalant if Reflect isn't up, but it can't switch into a boosted Head Charge. Dusclops is a fine counter to Bouffalant and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, but can't do much if Bouffalant Taunts it. Escavalier resists Head Charge and, if it carries a Choice Band and Bouffalant has suffered some damage, can OHKO with Megahorn. However, it's still 2HKOed by Head Charge, even with max HP. Cobalion also resists Head Charge, and can OHKO Bouffalant with Close Combat or Focus Blast, if Bouffalant has taken some damage before, but it needs to be wary of Earthquake.</p> ",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Although Swords Dance may imply that this set is meant to sweep, it lacks the Speed to do so. Instead, Bouffalant can break slower Pokemon and walls, KOing them with ease with a Reckless-boosted Head Charge. Any Pokemon foolish enough to switch into a Head Charge from Bouffalant is going to bite the grass, and even if it resists the move, it is still going to take a lot of damage. The other moves complement Head Charge well. Earthquake hits Rock- and Steel-types that resist Head Charge, while Wild Charge hits Mismagius and Aerodactyl, who resist Head Charge and Earthquake.</p> <p>Taunt renders walls who try to status Bouffalant useless, as they aren't powerful enough to do any significant damage back to Bouffalant. Megahorn hits Mew really hard, while also hitting Slowbro and Tangrowth slightly harder than Head Charge; it is capable of OHKOing Slowbro after a Swords Dance. You can also opt to use Sap Sipper over Reckless to gain immunity to the most common sleep-inducing move, Sleep Powder, and other Grass-type moves, which will raise Bouffalant's Attack stat. You can use Return over Head Charge if you opt to use Sap Sipper to avoid the recoil damage.</p> <p>The EVs listed let Bouffalant hit as hard and last as long as possible. Technician Hitmontop won't be able to OHKO Bouffalant with Mach Punch, even without EV investment in Defense, only 2HKOing it with some luck. Close Combat, however, OHKOes Bouffalant. An alternate EV spread of 132 HP / 252 Atk / 124 Spe can be used to outspeed some faster defensive Pokemon, such as Walrein and Hitmontop. If you want to outspeed Milotic, use 212 Speed EVs instead. To showcase Bouffalant's offensive capabilities, here are some damage calculations, all with the listed EVs, Reckless, and Swords Dance boost.</p> <ul> <li>Head Charge vs. 252/252+ Suicune 74.5% - 87.6% <li>Head Charge vs. 252/252+ Slowbro 78.6% - 92.6%</li> <li>Head Charge vs. 252/252+ Zapdos 95.8% - 112.7%</li> <li>Head Charge vs. 252/252+ Snorlax 93.7% - 110.1%</li> <li>Head Charge vs. 252/252+ Hitmontop 112.5% - 132.6%</li> <li>Head Charge vs. 252/252+ Tangrowth 70.3% - 82.7%</li> <li>Head Charge vs. 252/252+ Milotic 97.7% - 114.7%</li> </ul> <p>Since you are faster than all of these Pokemon bar Suicune, Zapdos, Hitmontop, and Milotic, you will be able to Taunt them and get a Swords Dance boost. The choice of item is up to preference. Leftovers lets Bouffalant recover the recoil damage from Head Charge, while Lum Berry, the preferred choice, keeps you safe from status. Life Orb can also be used to hit harder, but it will wear Bouffalant down really quickly. As far as support goes, dual screens from Pokemon such as Uxie and Cresselia help Bouffalant to last longer. Psychic-types such as the aforementioned Pokemon make excellent teammates for Bouffalant, resisting the Fighting-type moves it is weak to. Behind screens, even Choice Band Heracross can't OHKO Bouffalant at full health. Entry hazards can help Bouffalant score some extra OHKOs. Roserade is a great teammate for Bouffalant, as it resists Fighting-type moves and can set up Toxic Spikes. In addition to screens, Uxie can set up Stealth Rock. Bulky Ghost- and Flying-types, such as Dusclops and Zapdos, help take Fighting-type moves directed at Bouffalant. Dark-types, such as Weavile and Zoroark, can help take down Ghost-types, which are immune to Head Charge. Zoroark's Illusion ability can help early on in the battle, letting it disguise itself as Bouffalant to lure out Ghost-types that predict a Head Charge.</p> <p>This set can also be used on a Trick Room team, with no alterations needed to the moveset. However, a Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs is needed to make Bouffalant as slow as possible. Even though Bouffalant becomes faster than most Pokemon with Trick Room in effect, it's still outrun by Pokemon such as Slowbro and Escavalier. Although Slowbro can't do much to Bouffalant, Escavalier can hit it hard. Pokemon that are good at setting up Trick Room are needed. Uxie and Slowbro do this well, and they also resist Fighting-type moves.</p> "

Earthquake covers the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Head Charge, while Pursuit and Wild Charge hit Mismagius and Aerodactyl, who resist both Head Charge and Earthquake. Pursuit also punish fleeing opponents, especially frail sweepers. Megahorn is mostly a filler move, but hits Slowbro and Tangrowth slightly harder than Head Charge.</p> <p>The EVs do the same as for the Swords Dance set, except Bouffalant won't last as long without Leftovers, and without Lum Berry, is vulnerable to status.

This allow Bouffalant to knock both of them out before they can do anything to it. If you want to outspeed Milotic, move 212 EVs to Speed. Support in form of entry hazards is needed, as Bouffalant won't hit as hard without Swords Dance. Once again, Roserade is a great teammate, as it can use Spikes and resists the Fighting-type moves to which Bouffalant is weak to. Screen support can help Bouffalant take some hits that would KO it otherwise. Uxie or other Psychic-types that can set up dual screens are good teammates as well, as they also resist Fighting-type moves. Bulky Flying- and Ghost-types make great teammates, as they can take super effective Fighting-type moves directed at Bouffalant.

Its great ability, Defiant, makes Braviary a menace, raising its Attack when one of its stats is lowered, making Pokemon with Intimidate as an ability think twice about switching in. However, Braviary is still burdened by its middling Speed and lackluster base 75 defenses. Despite its flaws, Braviary is very strong and should be considered when building a team in UU.</p> ",

However, that's the only thing that Rock Slide and Sheer Force does for Braviary, making it a waste of a slot. Defiant is the superior ability anyways, preventing Braviary from being crippled by Intimidate users. Shadow Claw could be used in certain situations over U-turn if your team struggles against Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon. Braviary has access to moves such as Substitute, Roost, Toxic, and Sky Drop and could play a more defensive, supporting role, but due to its typing, it is better off sticking to offense. Tailwind could be used over U-turn on the wallbreaker set if a Life Orb is chosen as the item, patching up Braviary's middling Speed. However, it won't be easy for Braviary to set up, as many threats in UU carry a Rock-, Electric-, or Ice-type coverage move that will seriously hurt it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is one of the better checks to Braviary, as it will discourage Braviary from switching in. Bulky Pokemon that resist Brave Bird and Return, such as Rhyperior, Bronzong, Registeel, and Empoleon, are also excellent checks, as they don't mind having to take Superpower either. Other bulky Pokemon, such as Slowbro, Dusclops, Cofagrigus, and Gligar, can all cause problems for Braviary through status, such as burn or poison. Defensive Zapdos serves as a solid check to variants lacking the rare Rock Slide, taking only roughly 50% from Choice Scarf Braviary's Return. Sableye can utilize Prankster Will-O-Wisp and burn Braviary before getting wrecked by a STAB Brave Bird, crippling it for the rest of the match.

With Stealth Rock on the field, Braviary will be hard-pressed to get its job done, as the 25% cut in HP can cost it dearly. Therefore, Claydol, Blastoise, and Hitmontop make for excellent partners because they can spin away Stealth Rock, keeping Braviary safe when it switches in. Pokemon capable of removing Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon are also great teammate choices. Magneton and Fighting-types such as Cobalion and Mienshao are capable of beating Steel-types, with the Fighting-types also helping against Rock-types. Entry hazard support from Rhyperior, Registeel, Qwilfish, and/or Roserade is also appreciated, as the additional residual damage can turn many of Braviary's 2HKOs into OHKOs.</p> "

  "Mandibuzz": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being an NU Pokemon, Mandibuzz has a potent niche in UU. It has a good defensive typing, which allows it to resist many common attacking types, and when combined with great defenses and a good movepool, it means Mandibuzz is a viable mixed wall. Its movepool includes good options like Roost and Toxic, and Overcoat makes it immune to weather damage. However, these benefits come with a drawback, which is Mandibuzz's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock. Rapid Spin support is mandatory for Mandibuzz, and it should be paired up with Pokemon to help sponge Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks. Overall, Mandibuzz is an effective wall in the UU tier, and its ability to take on threats such as Azelf and Mismagius is much appreciated by any team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mandibuzz can go with a Nasty Plot set, but this is outclassed by so many other Pokemon with higher Special Attack and Speed. You can also try out a Mean Look + Toxic set, but this is way too situational to be effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steel-types in general completely wall Mandibuzz as they are immune to Toxic and have a high base Defense to take Brave Bird. A good example is Cobalion; it can set up a Swords Dance or a Calm Mind and sweep, as only Whirlwind threatens it, but Cobalion can just come back in. Magic Guard or Magic Bounce users also wall Mandibuzz since Toxic is bounced back at Mandibuzz. Xatu can completely set up on Mandibuzz, either with dual screens or Calm Mind. Strong super effective STAB moves also easily kill Mandibuzz: Rhyperior can rip apart Mandibuzz with STAB Stone Edge and the Rotom formes carry a strong STAB Thunderbolt to take it down. Mandibuzz doesn't appreciate Toxic either; it severely reduces its walling capabilities. Faster Taunt users also shut Mandibuzz down. Finally, having Stealth Rock on the field will cripple Mandibuzz, as most Pokemon can take it down when it has taken some prior damage.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>Due to its typing, Mandibuzz is better suited to being a special wall than a physical wall. It can switch in on a variety of special sweepers such as Mismagius and wall them thanks to recovery in Roost. This, together with Toxic, allows Mandibuzz to outstall many opposing Pokemon. It can even use Taunt to force those Pokemon to switch. Whirlwind is used to phaze set-up sweepers away. Brave Bird is an option though if you don't want Mandibuzz to be Taunt bait. U-turn is an option as well, to bring in a safe switch-in, but you will need Rapid Spin support.</p> <p>Knock Off is an option, since it cripples most walls and Eviolite users. You can use Torment as well, so opponents can't 2HKO Mandibuzz with their strongest attacks. A Dark-type STAB attack can be used, but it provides less coverage than Brave Bird. The HP EVs give an odd HP stat, which ensures that you can switch in four times with Stealth Rock up. Special Defense is maxed out and the remaining EVs are put into Defense. You can use Mandibuzz as a mixed wall with the following spread: 248 HP / 216 Def / 44 SpD, which enables Mandibuzz to function as an emergency check to any out-of-hand threats. The Specially Defensive set outclasses this set though, because of Mandibuzz's typing.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is welcome from Pokemon such as Hitmontop, otherwise Mandibuzz will lose a quarter of its health every time it switches in. Heal Bell support is recommended, as Mandibuzz doesn't appreciate status. While Registeel can be kept in check with Taunt, most Steel-types such as Cobalion and Escavalier are problematic as they don't mind Mandibuzz's STAB attacks and are immune to Toxic. Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Suicune are capable of handling most Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon. Fighting-type Pokemon can also take on the aforementioned Steel-types thanks to their STAB attacks. With Taunt and Roost, Mandibuzz is capable of stalling out certain dedicated walls such as Slowbro. Pokemon that struggle against these Pokemon partner well with Mandibuzz for this reason. Faster users of Taunt are also troublesome for Mandibuzz.</p> "

  "Durant": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its small size, Durant is a major powerhouse. A base 109 Attack stat coupled with Hustle gives Durant a stat over 500 right away with an Attack boosting nature, which leaves many Pokemon walking cautiously when it enters the field. Durant is also blessed with Hone Claws, which helps it patch up the loss of accuracy Hustle causes; Hone Claws also raises Durant's Attack stat in the process, giving it an Attack of over 700 after just one boost. Not only does Durant hit hard, but it also hits fast. A blazing fast base 109 Speed stat leaves base 105 Speed Pokemon, as well as Cobalion and Galvantula, in the dust as Durant plows through the opposition. Durant is also blessed with a good typing. Defensively, its Steel typing gives Durant good resistances, especially useful when coupled with a base 112 Defense stat, while offensively, its Bug typing gives it a great STAB; the two combined gives Durant only one crippling weakness to Fire-type moves. However, it's not all roses for this little ant. Durant has utterly awful special stats, meaning it can't even take a resisted special move well at all, while using a special move is out of the question. Durant's shallow physical movepool is a letdown as well, as it's left with only four viable moves: X-Scissor, Iron Head, Superpower, and Rock Slide. However, due to its fantastic offensive stats, Hustle, Hone Claws, and good typing, Durant makes for a very dangerous offensive threat which you should always be prepared to deal with.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Durant's movepool is extremely sparse, so there aren't many other options to choose from. First of all, Durant has various other physical moves, such as Thunder Fang, Aerial Ace, Crunch, and Shadow Claw. While Thunder Fang and Crunch will hit Water- and Ghost-types harder than anything else, respectively, they don't provide any additional coverage, and these Pokemon can be disposed of by Durant's STAB moves. Aerial Ace is Durant's best answer to Heracross, but it doesn't provide any additional coverage other than that, and Iron Head will usually do; after entry hazards, it will always OHKO Heracross. Thunder Wave and Toxic are two decent ways to spread status around the opponent's team, but Durant usually can't give up on a moveslot for these moves as it will lose a lot of much-needed coverage. Rock Polish is Durant's last notable option, and allows it to outspeed the entire tier with just one boost. However, Durant doesn't need more Speed, while the extra power from either Hone Claws or Choice Band is much more appreciated.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to its immense power, Durant can be hard to bring down, but it's not unstoppable. Sending in a Pokemon to finish off Durant when it has KOed one your Pokemon is the easiest way to take it out. Choice Scarf-wielding Fire-types are Durant's worst enemies, and they will set fire to its dream of sweeping an entire team. Victini and Darmanitan are by far the most common ones, and just a touch of their strong Fire-type moves will be enough to bring Durant down. While Victini can't switch in on X-Scissor at all and it is 2HKOed by Iron Head if Stealth Rock is up, it can safely switch in on Superpower due to the Attack drop Durant will suffer. As you might have noticed by now, Speed is a huge factor when countering Durant. Almost all faster Pokemon, especially specially oriented ones, are good checks to Durant. Raikou is a prime example that easily outspeeds Durant and is able to blast it with a powerful Thunderbolt for an outright KO. Azelf is another great example, and even has access to Flamethrower to melt through Durant's metal plates.</p> <p>Overwhelming Speed is not the only answer to Durant. Incredible bulk and useful resistances to Durant's moves are also great assets in taking it down. In particular, Zapdos is a great threat to Durant. Offensive versions of Zapdos can't easily switch in on Durant, especially Hone Claws variants, as Durant can outspeed and 2HKO it with most of its moves, while Rock Slide is a surefire KO. However, Zapdos can revenge kill Durant Choice-locked into X-Scissor, Iron Head, or Superpower with its powerful STAB Thunderbolt, as it easily survives any of the aforementioned moves even with Stealth Rock on the field. Physically defensive variants have an even easier time against Durant, especially Choice Band variants, which it can actually switch in on. Even after Stealth Rock damage, +1 Hone Claws Durant can fail to OHKO Zapdos 50% of the time, which allows Zapdos to swiftly dispose of Durant and possibly Roost of the damage afterward. Gligar is another huge issue for Durant. Even at +1, Durant needs Life Orb, Iron Head, and Stealth Rock up to even come close to 2HKOing it. If Durant lacks Iron Head or is locked into a resisted move, Gligar is a full stop to Durant and can just Roost of the pitiful damage Durant does to it. Suicune, with its great defensive prowess, can become a nuisance for Durant; it can't switch in on a +1, Life Orb-boosted X-Scissor, however, it can survive one and possibly burn Durant to reduce its power or just simply KO it if Durant has suffered any prior damage. Nidoqueen resists three out of four of Durant's moves and easily OHKOes with Flamethrower. Even Iron Head is not a sure answer to Nidoqueen, as it can survive a +1 Iron Head and KO Durant back. Cofagrigus is another great road block for Durant. Not only can it easily survive an Iron Head and burn Durant with Will-O-Wisp, its ability, Mummy, removes Hustle, and makes Durant much less threatening; to avoid Mummy, Durant must resort to using the much weaker Rock Slide to damage Cofagrigus, which won't do much at all. Durant that lack Superpower are completely stopped by Cobalion, Steelix, and Registeel, who can set up with Swords Dance or Curse, cripple Durant with Thunder Wave, or just Roar it out, respectively. Furthermore, even if Durant carries Superpower, it's not a guaranteed OHKO.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Hone Claws",
        "description": "<p>This set is all about switching in when an opportunity arises, setting up, and then hitting incredibly hard and fast. Hone Claws only raises the user's Attack stat by one stage, and is Durant's only option for boosting. While the single-stage boost might seem lacking at first glance, it's almost like Hone Claws was designed for this Pokemon. Hustle already boosts Durant's Attack stat to 475, while Hone Claws patches the loss of accuracy Hustle brings; one boost from Hone Claws and Durant sits at normal accuracy levels and an Attack stat of 712, enough to tear nearly everything apart. X-Scissor is the best Bug-type move at Durant's disposal; while it might seem pretty weak at first glance, it has enough power to hit anything that doesn't resist it for massive damage; it's also more reliable compared to Heracross's Megahorn, which is a godsend for Durant. Rock Slide covers some of the deadliest forces in the tier; both Zapdos and Darmanitan resist Durant's other moves and Rock Slide will easily KO both of these after a Hone Claws boost. Iron Head is Durant's secondary STAB, and hits several Pokemon in the tier that can withstand both X-Scissor and Rock Slide. Gligar, one of the sturdiest walls in the tier, is 2HKOed by a boosted Iron Head, while Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Rhyperior, and Heracross are OHKOed. Superpower is Durant's only option for taking down Steel-types. While Empoleon is 2HKOed by +1 Life Orb X-Scissor, other Steel-types such as Cobalion, Registeel, and Steelix can withstand several blows from the little ant's other moves due to their superior physical Defense.</p> <p>There aren't many other viable options Durant can use, as it needs the listed moves to cover the most threats. Substitute can be used with the right team support to ease prediction and setting up. Stone Edge is a more powerful, albeit less reliable, option for Durant to use, hitting opponents much harder on the switch, as well as having a better chance to OHKO physically defensive Zapdos when Stealth Rock is absent. The choice between Life Orb and Lum Berry should be determined by your personal preference. While Life Orb is needed to get the OHKOs and 2HKOs against sturdier opponents such as Gligar, Empoleon, and Cobalion, Lum Berry can prove a useful asset to rid Durant of any unwanted status, such as burn from Scald or paralysis from Thunder Wave. Leftovers is also an option to keep Durant healthy throughout the game. Any entry hazard support is a godsend for Durant, as it will make KOing certain walls much easier for it. Claydol and Nidoqueen are great options for setting up Stealth Rock, which will help Durant net OHKOs and 2HKOs against Pokemon such as Gligar, Empoleon, and physically defensive Zapdos. Claydol can also provide useful Rapid Spin support; while Durant is immune to Toxic Spikes, Spikes will wear it down and make it much more easier to KO. Roserade and Qwilfish can provide excellent Toxic Spikes and Spikes support for Durant. While Spikes won't help much against aerial foes, they will make Pokemon such as Suicune, Cobalion, and Slowbro much easier to take down, especially if Durant lacks Life Orb.</p> <p>Now comes the main issue with this Durant: its lack of coverage. If Durant lacks Superpower, almost every Steel-type in the tier will have a field day with it, by either totally crippling it and walling it to hell and back, or just setting up on it. Magneton can trap most Steel-types and KO them with its powerful Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire. Even though Cobalion outspeeds Magneton, a Choice Scarf will patch up the latter's lower Speed stat nicely. Slowbro is also a full stop to Cobalion, and thus pairs nicely with Durant; Cobalion can even fail to 2HKO Slowbro with X-Scissor at +2, which shows how greatly Slowbro's defensive capabilities can aid Durant. Other teammates that pair up nicely with Durant to take care of Steel-types are the many powerful Fire-types in the tier; Houndoom, Victini, and Darmanitan can turn all Steel-types into crisps. While these Fire-types can greatly aid Durant, they are also some of its greatest enemies. Victini and Darmanitan commonly wield Choice Scarves and can all outspeed Durant, making the two defensive behemoths, Snorlax and Porygon2, great teammates for Durant. Snorlax has access to Thick Fat to halve the damage it takes from Fire-type attacks, while Porygon2 can Trace Flash Fire from Houndoom and Arcanine to make their STAB moves obsolete. If, however, you choose to use Superpower over Iron Head, other problems pop up. Nidoqueen resists all of Durant's moves if it lacks Iron Head, and can easily dispose of Durant with a super effective Flamethrower. Gligar is also a big, big problem, as Rock Slide pales in comparison to Iron Head as a means of taking it down. Gligar can then proceed to easily stall out Durant with Roost and repeated Earthquakes. Pokemon such as Krookodile, Suicune, Kingdra, and even Roserade are therefore great teammates. Nidoqueen is no match for these four, while Suicune, Kingdra, and Roserade can hit Gligar extremely hard. It should be noted that Nidoqueen is only 2HKOed by Iron Head, so one should pack a Pokemon to take care of it regardless of Durant's choice of moves, as a healthy Nidoqueen can come in after a teammate has gone down and spell doom for Durant.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Choice Band allows Durant to bypass the turn of setup that Hone Claws requires, and lets it hit hard right from the start. Using Choice Band also means Durant gets much better coverage as it doesn't have to give up a slot for Hone Claws. However, Choice Band does not do anything about Hustle's accuracy drop, so one must be wary about potential misses. X-Scissor is Durant's best move; it provides great STAB and coverage, and will hit a huge part of the tier incredibly hard. Rock Slide covers most Fire- and Flying-types; Zapdos is the biggest target of this move as it resists the other three. Iron Head is a great secondary STAB move and covers threats that the other moves just can't, such as Gligar and Nidoqueen. Superpower is Durant's best option against Steel-types; all Steel-types in the tier are at worst 2HKOed by Durant's Superpower. Superpower is also the easiest way for Durant to dispose of Snorlax.</p> <p>Entry hazards help this variant of Durant a lot, particularly in taking down bulkier opponents such as Suicune, Milotic, and Registeel. It can also keep the opponent from switching, and allow Durant to revenge kill it much more easily. Nidoqueen, Qwilfish, and Roserade are all good candidates for setting up entry hazards. These three can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, while Nidoqueen can also set up Stealth Rock. It should be noted, however, that Roserade shares a Fire-type weakness with Durant, so proper team support is needed when using it. Rapid Spin support is also highly appreciated due to the hit-and-run nature of this set. Claydol is great option for this, as it can also set up Stealth Rock and take several special moves directed at Durant. Choice Scarf-wielding Fire-types in general are huge problems. Snorlax and Porygon2 are good checks to Victini due to their typing and abilities, while Flash Fire Pokemon such as Houndoom and Arcanine can switch in on Fire-type moves directed at Durant. The lack of Life Orb leaves Durant's Iron Head unable to 2HKO Gligar and only able to 2HKO Nidoqueen at best, and both takes pitiful damage from its other moves. Therefore, Water-types such as Suicune, Slowbro, and Kingdra make good teammates. All three can hit both Gligar and Nidoqueen quite hard with their Water-type moves, while taking little damage in return.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Despite UU being a tier filled with Fighting-types, Cobalion has no trouble distinguishing itself from the rest with its unique typing, which grants it a good number of resistances--including a 4x resistance to Stealth Rock and immunity to poison--on top of its excellent physical bulk, good speed, and access to Swords Dance, Calm Mind, and Stealth Rock. On the other hand, it has problems taking special attacks due to its bad Special Defense. Its Steel typing has notable drawbacks in a metagame full of Fighting-type moves, and its offenses can be somewhat lacking. Nonetheless, Cobalion remains a potent threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Cobalion has a variety of options not covered in the sets. For example, it can opt for a Choice set instead of relying on set-up moves for power; Choice Specs offers a stronger Volt Switch and Hidden Power Ice while Choice Band doesn't have to rely on Focus Blast's shaky accuracy. Work Up is usable on a mixed attacking set, but is generally not recommended due to Cobalion's lacking offenses. Aerial Ace can be used to deal with Heracross who don't carry a Choice Scarf, and Quick Attack finishes weakened opponents, but is very weak and will rarely be strong enough to KO anything.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Slowbro is easily Cobalion's best counter; the Swords Dance set's best option against it is a boosted X-Scissor--which will still barely 2HKO. Gligar beats physical sets without Hidden Power Ice, but Iron Head variants can get past it with flinches. Nidoking and Heracross can take almost all hits from Cobalion and OHKO back. Iron Head can help, but Choice Scarf versions leave Cobalion no chance. Choice Scarf users in general almost always have STAB attacks that hit Cobalion super-effectively; Darmanitan and Mienshao easily OHKO while Flygon and Krookodile come close. Hitmontop has Intimidate and takes physical hits well, meaning it beats physical sets without Substitute easily. Suicune and Blastoise can take boosted Close Combats and either hit back to weaken Cobalion or simply phaze it with Roar.

Hidden Power Ice allows Cobalion to get past Gligar, who would otherwise wall it. X-Scissor hits Slowbro super effectively, but can only 2HKO it with a Life Orb, giving it a turn to cripple Cobalion with Thunder Wave.</p> <p>The given EVs maximize Cobalion's Attack and Speed, both of which are essential when trying to sweep.

Iron Head can be used as a secondary STAB, but is generally less useful than Hidden Power Ice and X-Scissor. Taunt and Substitute are also good options to avoid status moves. Taunt prevents the opponent from setting up while Substitute allows Cobalion to beat Hitmontop. If using Hidden Power Ice, a Naive nature is preferred; otherwise use Jolly. This set's best counters are Slowbro and Gligar, depending on the choice of move, meaning Grass-types, such as Shaymin, who can switch into and threaten the two pair well with it.

Hidden Power Ghost hits Slowbro as well as Ghost-types super effectively, while Hidden Power Ice is useful for dealing with Gligar and Zapdos. Flash Cannon is the secondary STAB, but its coverage is mostly redundant with Hidden Power Ice, making it more useful in combination with Hidden Power Ghost. Substitute is used to avoid status moves and sponge weaker special attacks after a boost without fading.</p> <p>The EV spread focuses on having as much Speed and Special Attack as possible, but an alternative spread of 68 HP / 140 SpA / 68 SpD / 232 Spe can be used to guarantee that Slowbro cannot break a Substitute with either Scald or Psyshock after a boost. Taunt is an option over Substitute to avoid status moves without losing health and prevent the opponent from setting up. This set loses to either Victini or Zapdos depending on its Hidden Power, so Snorlax makes an excellent partner.

It suffers from a massive weakness to Flying, meaning that Pokemon such as Tornadus and Crobat can come in on both of Virizion's STABs and proceed to eliminate it with Hurricane or Brave Bird. Its STABs don't have great coverage, so it must beware of that. Moreover, although Virizion sports a massive base 129 Special Defense, it also has mediocre base 72 Defense, so it can be hit hard by any physical attack.

X-Scissor is a decent option on the Swords Dance set to get rid of Mew and Azelf, but is generally inferior to Stone Edge. Aerial Ace is also a usable option to hit Heracross, but is not very useful otherwise. Energy Ball is a strong Grass-type move that can be useful on the Calm Mind set, but is inferior to Giga Drain, which trades a little less power for recovery. Like the other Swords of Justice, Virizion has access to their signature move Sacred Sword, which is an acceptable alternative over Close Combat if the defense drops are undesirable; however, it is considerably weaker. Checks and Counters =================== Crobat is the number one counter to Virizion: it resists both of Virizion's STABs and can retaliate with a powerful Brave Bird. However, it cannot switch into a Hidden Power Ice and Rock or Stone Edge. Heracross and Victini resist Virizion's STABs as well, and can retaliate with Close Combat and V-create, respectively, however, Victini will need to watch out for Stone Edge or Hidden Power Rock. Zapdos can come in safely on Virizion's STABs and hit back with Heat Wave, but must be wary of switching in on Hidden Power Ice and Rock or Stone Edge. Amoonguss and Cresselia wall Virizion to no end and can cripple it with Spore or Thunder Wave, respectively, while Amoonguss can clear all of Virizion's stat boosts with Clear Smog.

Its Grass typing allows it to get past most bulky Water-types that other Fighting-types have trouble with, namely Slowbro and Swampert. It also sports excellent 91 / 72 / 129 bulk to be able to set up on threats such as Raikou, Blastoise, and Snorlax and sweep effectively. Swords Dance boosts Virizion's Attack to a high level. Leaf Blade is the first STAB; it provides decent coverage while also hitting most bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Suicune super effectively. Close Combat is a strong Fighting-type STAB that can hurt anything that doesn't resist it, such as Registeel and Empoleon. Last but not least, Stone Edge is a coverage move to get around Tornadus and Crobat, Pokemon that take little from Virizion's other attacks.</p> <p>Maximum EVs are invested into Attack and Speed in order to ensure that Virizion attains its maximum potential as a sweeper. Life Orb is the preferred item to boost Virizion's power; however, Virizion appreciates nether being worn down by recoil nor being crippled by a burn, so Lum Berry is an option to get past Sableye as well as setting up on Scald. Alternatively, one can drop Stone Edge and use Hidden Power Ice along with a Hasty Nature and an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe to hit Gligar. Entry hazards are essential to this set's success. Qwilfish and Roserade can set up Spikes while Registeel, Bronzong, and Rhyperior are good at setting up Stealth Rock. However, these are also this set's enemy; therefore, Blastoise and Claydol are both fine picks to spin them away. Rhyperior is a good ally to deal with Flying-types such as Tornadus and Crobat, which would otherwise threaten Virizion with their STAB. A Dark-type such as Honchkrow or Bisharp is also a decent ally to deal with Mew and Azelf.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>Virizion utilizes Calm Mind very well, as it can take on bulky Water-types pretty well thanks to its Grass / Fighting typing. Calm Mind is the key move, boosting both of Virizion's special stats to high levels. Giga Drain is the primary STAB, and provides reliable recovery while also a reasonably powerful attack. Focus Blast is the Fighting STAB of choice; although it's inaccurate, it is very powerful, and deals with Steel-types. Hidden Power Rock is the preferred coverage move in the last slot, as it defeats Victini and Crobat, two important targets that resist Virizion's STABs. Hidden Power Ice is usable as well, hitting Roserade, Shaymin, and opposing Virizion super effectively while maintaining coverage on Crobat.</p> <p>236 EVs are invested into Speed to outspeed positive-natured base 105s, as due to Hidden Power Rock cutting Speed by one point, Virizion is unable to Speed tie with Cobalion and opposing Virizion. If Hidden Power Ice is used, then an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe is preferred to tie with opposing base 108s. A Life Orb is the preferred item, as it grants more firepower, and the residual damage can be patched up by Giga Drain. Leftovers is a usable alternative if staying power is preferred; however, Virizion will usually want the extra power Life Orb provides. Rhyperior is a recommended ally, as it can take on Victini and Crobat, as well as set up Stealth Rock. Additionally, a Dark-type such as Bisharp or Krookodile is helpful to eliminate Psychic-types such as Azelf and Mew, both of which can use Psyshock to eliminate Virizion. Finally, a Pokemon capable of setting up Spikes, such as Roserade or Qwilfish, can be immensely helpful to allow Virizion to attain some important KOs, most notably on Snorlax, Suicune, and Mew.</p> "

  "Tornadus": {
    "overview": "<p>With the inclusion of its Therian Forme, Tornadus was almost completely outclassed in OU, and its usage suffered accordingly. However, in UU, Tornadus has the ability to wreak almost everything in the tier. This is largely due to its excellent Special Attack and its unique Speed stats that allow it to outspeed and destroy a majority of the tier, especially one that is filled with Fighting-types that are weak to its STAB. However, Tornadus is not limited to special attacking, as its Attack stat is almost just as good, which allows it to get past special walls, such as Snorlax and Umbreon, with ease, setting it apart from most other special attackers in the tier. Its access to Prankster also means Tornadus is well suited for a supporting role, giving it one of the fastest Taunts in the game and a prioritized Rain Dance.</p> <p>With all the power that Tornadus packs, it makes sense that it is crippled by a few flaws. While Tornadus's Hurricane is one of the most powerful moves in the tier, its 70 accuracy before a Rain Dance can be incredibly annoying. Additionally, with a Stealth Rock weakness and mediocre bulk, Tornadus will oftentimes find itself struggling to stay alive throughout a battle. Furthermore, its attacking prowess is held back by a shallow movepool that leaves it open to certain threats, such as Raikou and Zapdos.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tornadus has a somewhat barren movepool that leaves it without many other options. Focus Blast can be used for a special Fighting-type move, but Superpower will do more to Umbreon and Snorlax, and Focus Blast has an infuriatingly mediocre accuracy. Tornadus can hit Zapdos hard with Hidden Power Ice, but it generally isn't worth giving up a moveslot for. Air Slash is a more accurate alternative to Hurricane, but since Tornadus can easily set up Rain Dance to fix the accuracy issues and Air Slash is a lot less powerful, this isn't worth it. When rain isn't a factor, Heat Wave will help get past Bronzong, and even in the rain it will still hit it harder than any of Tornadus's other moves. Choice Specs may seem plausible due to its brutal Special Attack stat, but its most powerful moves, Focus Blast and Hurricane, only have 70% accuracy in this case, which is not enough to depend on. Finally, Tornadus can raise its Speed with Agility or Tailwind, but because Tornadus is fast enough already, this is usually a poor choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>With high mixed attacking stats, Tornadus is difficult to counter. However, Tornadus struggles against almost any Electric-type Pokemon, including Raikou, Zapdos, and Rotom-H. Raikou can outspeed and OHKO it, Zapdos resists its STAB and all of its common coverage moves, and Rotom-H is only hit hard by Superpower, which it can survive without a problem. Bronzong is one of the few Steel-type Pokemon that is hit neutrally by Superpower and can wall Tornadus while doing massive damage back with Gyro Ball. Aerodactyl can take a Hurricane, outspeed Tornadus, and OHKO it with Stone Edge. If Tornadus doesn't have Grass Knot, Rhyperior is capable of taking a Superpower and then destroying it with its Rock STAB. Registeel may take quite a bit from Superpower, but it can still wear it down with Iron Head and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Weavile cannot take a hit from Tornadus, but it can outspeed it and OHKO it with Ice Punch. Kingdra and Kabutops can outspeed Tornadus in the rain and proceed to OHKO it with a Rain-boosted Waterfall.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>With its fearsome mixed attacking stats and a speed stat that surpasses most of the tier, Tornadus can easily go on the offensive route. In a tier where Flying is only resisted by a few Pokemon—and also in one that is filled with many dangerous Fighting-types, such as Heracross, Mienshao, and Scrafty—Tornadus's STAB is extremely useful and difficult to switch into. Due to Prankster, Tornadus will almost always use Rain Dance first, hindered only by faster priority moves or faster Prankster Taunts. When in the rain, Hurricane never misses, which allows Tornadus to fire off its STAB with impunity, putting major dents into the opponent's team. Grass Knot destroys Rhyperior, which can take both Hurricane and Superpower with ease. It is also useful for dealing a lot of damage to bulky Water-types like Milotic that can tank a Hurricane and take advantage of the rain to hit Tornadus harder. Grass + Flying coverage is also surprisingly useful in UU, being resisted only by Steel-type Pokemon, which are somewhat uncommon within the tier, and a few Electric-types, such as Zapdos and Rotom-H. Even then, Superpower lays a smack down on Steel-types, such as Registeel. In addition, Umbreon and Snorlax, two of the most specially bulky Pokemon in UU, take massive damage from a super effective Superpower despite the lack of investment in Attack.</p> <p>Though setting up Rain Dance isn't required for Tornadus, a miss can be very devastating due to its frailty, so you may as well try to set up Rain before using Hurricane. Setting up Rain Dance may be tricky at times, but the main way to get it up is by forcing an opponent out, which is generally a Fighting-type, such as Mienshao or / and Scrafty, or a Grass-type, such as Shaymin and Tangrowth. Tornadus sorely misses out on a good move to use against Electric-types, such as Raikou and Zapdos; the former is capable of outspeeding and OHKOing it while the latter resists Tornadus's three-move coverage. Snorlax can take hits from these Pokemon for quite a while and do massive damage to them with an Earthquake or a Body Slam, but if Raikou and Zapdos aren't running Hidden Power Grass, then Swampert and Rhyperior can easily defeat them due to their immunity to their Electric STAB.</p> <p>Rain Dance doesn't last very long on this set, but regardless, Swift Swim Pokemon, such as Kingdra and Kabutops, can devastate teams under the rain thanks to the Speed boost. In case Tornadus happens to faint or if Tornadus is sent out for a last-ditch Rain Dance, then these Pokemon can take advantage of the remaining turns. Blastoise can Rapid Spin Stealth Rock away for Tornadus, and it can also get extra healing in the rain thanks to Rain Dish. Although Tornadus gets Superpower, it generally cannot depend on this to get past bulky Steel-types, such as Registeel, and it only hits Bronzong for neutral damage, and the Defense drop can be devastating. Victini and Darmanitan can easily OHKO any Steel-type that comes in their way, but note that if it is raining then this may not happen, so be careful when using Rain Dance.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>Although Tornadus is usually a Hurricane-spamming machine, Tornadus is perfectly capable of going the physical attacking route. Tornadus has a base 115 Attack Stat, which is nearly as high as its Special Attack and still one of the highest in the tier. As a result, this set is not only one of surprise value, but it can also threaten to be a lethal physical attacker, as it is one of the only Pokemon in UU that gets a good physical Flying STAB. Bulk Up is the only way for Tornadus to increase its attack, but thanks to Prankster, it can set up before the opponent can Taunt it. In addition, while the defense boost from Bulk Up usually doesn't help, it can aid Tornadus in taking a physical attack so then it isn't KOed as easily while it sets up. Acrobatics is the main STAB option, and thanks to the Flying Gem and STAB, it hits very hard. Superpower hits Steel-types and Rhyperior hard, and while it may seem counterproductive with Bulk Up, the power from Brick Break doesn't do nearly enough damage to these Pokemon. Both Taunt and Substitute prevent the opponent from inflicting crippling status, such as burn or paralysis. Taunt prevents phazing Tornadus out and ridding it of its boosts, while Substitute acts as a buffer to give Tornadus more time for setting up.</p> <p>While Bulk Up's defense boost can help a little bit, the goal is not to make it take hits better, but it is instead to increase its attack since Tornadus is rather frail. The Flying Gem is almost required for Tornadus, as it lets Tornadus unleash a powerful Acrobatics on the initial hit, and it reaches its full effectiveness without an item. Tornadus has no other even decent physical STAB, so a Life Orb serves no purpose on this set. If you don't want to lose Bulk Up boosts with a Fighting-type move, then Brick Break is the next best option, although it won't be doing much to Steel-types without a substantial amount of boosts. Despite attacking physically rather than specially, Tornadus still struggles with Electric-types. Because of this, bulky Ground-types, such as Rhyperior and Swampert, or special tanks, such as Snorlax, are good partners for Tornadus, though Ground-types must be wary of Hidden Power Grass. Rhyperior's Rock Blast is a pain for this set, as it can break through a Substitute and keep attacking, and Rhyperior can take even a Superpower thanks to its massive bulk. Because of this, Water-types, such as Suicune and Miltoic, make good teammates.</p> "

        "name": "Rain Dance",
        "description": "<p>While this may look similar to an offensive set, the point of this set is to set up Rain Dance quickly rather than sweeping. Despite being frail, the reason why Tornadus is useful for setting up rain is because it has access to Prankster, meaning that it cannot be Taunted by anything other than a speedy Whimsicott, which is uncommon. It also means it is the fastest Pokemon in the game at setting up rain, which gives it an important niche. Despite the main goal of this set and the lack of a boosting item, its Hurricane still tears holes in the opponent's team, and Superpower still does plenty to the opponent's Steel- and Dark-types, such as Snorlax, and Umbreon repectively. Taunt is also helpful, as it makes sure that the opponent cannot inflict a status on both Tornadus and your rain abuser.</p> <p>A bulkier spread can be used if Tornadus is dependent on setting up Rain Dance for the team since Tornadus will almost always do it first, but it is still generally too frail and, instead, enjoys taking advantage of the rain itself. A Damp Rock is used to extend the amount of turns the rain will last, ensuring that its teammates can take advantage of the rain that it summons. Grass Knot can be used for Rhyperior and heavier, bulkier Water-types like Suicune and Milotic, as Superpower and Hurricane don't hit any of them very hard, but it generally isn't worth giving up a moveslot. Because the goal is to make sure that you set up Rain Dance, Swift Swim users, such as Kabutops and Kingdra, can take advantage of the rain and blast through teams thanks to the boost to their Speed and their Water STAB. Since Tornadus will be switching out a lot, Blastoise is a good partner, as it can Rapid Spin Stealth Rock away and appreciates the boost to its Water STAB and potentially healing with Rain Dish. Electric-type Pokemon are tough for Tornadus to handle, so using Snorlax, Rhyperior, or Swampert will aid Tornadus in defeating these Pokemon. Due to how hard it can be to handle bulky Water-types and Rhyperior, using Roserade or Shaymin's STAB Grass moves are useful, as it will make quick work of them.</p> "

  "Meloetta": {
    "overview": "<p>Meloetta is quite an interesting Pokemon. At first, it seems like your generic Psychic-type, with high Special Attack and Special Defense. However, Meloetta does have some tools to set it apart from the rest of the crowd. The first thing one notices is that it has a very cool signature move in Relic Song. This can be played very interestingly, alternating between formes to play mind games with your opponent, thanks to its Pirouette forme having a Fighting typing and base 128 Attack. Meloetta also sports a Normal-typing, which means Cofagrigus and Mismagius have little to hurt it. It also sports a very wide movepool including Calm Mind, Psychic, Thunderbolt, and much more, allowing it to run many sets.</p> <p>Meloetta does have its flaws, though. It has a disappointing base 90 Speed stat, which means it gets outrun frequently. It also has a Dark-type weakness, which mean Pursuit and Sucker Punch spell doom for it, and has to set up or run Choice Specs to be a threat. Nonetheless, Meloetta is a very versatile and unpredictable Pokemon and is not to be taken lightly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thanks to Meloetta's diverse movepool, it has many options at its disposal. Relic Song is a very cool move that provides a lot of surprise factor, the ability to switch into its Pirouette forme, which is strong and speedy as well as sporting a Fighting-type, is very interesting. This allows Meloetta to utilize Close Combat to hurt its normal counters otherwise. With this, a mixed set of Relic Song, Close Combat, Psychic, and Thunderbolt, is very possible and can build up pressure with Spikes support, but this is generally inferior to Meloetta's other sets. However, if you really love keeping up offensive pressure, this set can perform well. That aside, Meloetta also has other offensive options such as Energy Ball, which can be used to hurt Swampert but is generally inferior to Grass Knot and Thunderbolt. It also has Thunder if you're running manual rain, but it's horribly inaccurate and is inferior to Thunderbolt in general. Return could be used if you're brave enough to use Pirouette forme Meloetta, but it doesn't provides decent coverage. Meloetta also has a decent physical movepool consisting of Zen Headbutt, Stone Edge, the elemental punches, and Shadow Claw, but you're better off using special sets. A specially defensive set with options such as Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Perish Song is possible, but it's outclassed by Snorlax, which has Whirlwind to phaze and recovery in Rest. Finally, Charge Beam is an option for troll factor, with Serene Grace raising its Special Attack boosting chance to 100%, but you're better off running Calm Mind for boosting.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Meloetta absolutely hates the presence of Dark-types; Krookodile, Weavile, and Zoroark can all outspeed and KO it, while Honchkrow and Bisharp can take it out with Sucker Punch. Meloetta is also hindered by the presence of Escavalier, which can take Meloetta's onslaughts pretty well and retaliate with a powerful Megahorn or Pursuit. If Meloetta is not using Shadow Ball, Cresselia walls it to no end and can cripple it with Thunder Wave or even set up its own Calm Minds. Snorlax is a thorn in Meloetta's side as well, with its huge special bulk allowing it to survive numerous hits and phaze with Whirlwind, undoing all of Meloetta's Calm Mind boosts. Heracross can smash Meloetta with Megahorn, which also grants it a free Attack boost, but it must be wary of Psychic. Togekiss can take many onslaughts from Meloetta and retaliate with Thunder Wave and Air Slash. Finally, thanks to Meloetta's middling Defense stat, powerful physical attackers such as Darmanitan and Mienshao can hit it very hard with their attacks.</p> ",

Meloetta also sports the best special stats of all Calm Mind users in UU, allowing it to use Calm Mind very effectively.</p> <p>Calm Mind is the boosting move of choice, providing bulk and firepower. Psychic provides STAB and hits Fighting-types for heavy damage. Psyshock is also usable to get around Snorlax. Shadow Ball is the main coverage move, hitting Mew and Azelf for serious damage. Focus Blast is the final coverage move, hitting Dark-types such as Weavile and Krookodile for heavy damage. Thunderbolt is a more accurate alternative and hits Sableye and Honchkrow hard. Do note, however, that if one decides to use Thunderbolt, Krookodile will be an issue. Grass Knot is also a decent coverage move to defeat Rhyperior, Swampert, and Krookodile. Houndoom and Bisharp will, however, pose a threat if Grass Knot is chosen.</p> <p>A Timid nature is preferred to get past threats such as Timid Togekiss and Nidoking. A Life Orb is the preferred item on this set, because it allows Meloetta to hit hard right off the bat if setting up is too risky. Leftovers is also a viable option if being able to stay in longer is preferred over extra firepower.</p> <p>For this set to succeed, the ability to eliminate Dark-types is very important. A Fighting-type such as Mienshao is immensely helpful for eliminating threats such as Bisharp, Krookodile, and Weavile. Crobat is also a useful teammate to get around Heracross, who commonly runs Scarf and can KO with Megahorn.

With its amazing coverage, Normal typing to take on Cofagrigus and Mismagius, and great all round stats, it easily stands out from Mew and Azelf.</p> <p>Psychic is the primary STAB move, hitting numerous targets for good damage thanks to its power. Focus Blast is a powerful coverage move, smashing Steel-types, such as Registeel and Empoleon, as well as Snorlax for much needed damage.

Thunderbolt is also a very good coverage move, hitting Slowbro harder than Shadow Ball and also hurting Suicune, who otherwise can take all of Meloetta's other attacks. Finally, Trick is a very useful move to cripple Pokemon such as Bronzong and Porygon2, which become instantly useless due to losing bulk and being locked into a single move. U-turn is also useful if scouting and keeping offensive pressure is needed over crippling targets.</p> <p>A Timid nature is chosen to outspeed Pokemon such as Timid Nidoking and Togekiss, as Meloetta does not need the additional power due to the boost provided by Choice Specs. A Choice Specs is the chosen item for the ability to hit hard right off the bat, which is the main purpose of this set. Grass Knot is also a usable coverage move over Shadow Ball if Swampert is an issue.</p> <p>Due to this set not setting up at all, Honchkrow and Bisharp demolish it completely with Sucker Punch, as Meloetta will always be attacking. Additionally, Pursuit users such as Weavile and Krookodile can trap Meloetta if it is locked into Psychic.

Psychic or Psyshock provide much needed STAB, with a choice between either more power or the ability to get past Snorlax and opposing Calm Mind users. Hyper Voice is an option in the final slot for a secondary STAB and provides decent neutral coverage, as well as 2HKOing Umbreon after two Calm Minds. Thunderbolt is also a decent option if Psychic is the chosen STAB, getting around Suicune as well as hurting Sableye. Focus Blast is also a usable coverage move to hurt Steel-types such as Registeel, while still denting Snorlax, but be aware that it is very inaccurate.</p> <p>The selected EV spread invests 172 EVs into HP to allow enough HP to build very sturdy Substitutes, while providing enough Special Attack to hit hard with. 104 EVs are invested into Speed to provide Meloetta with enough Speed to outpace Honchkrow, the biggest threat to Meloetta. Leftovers is the chosen item to recover HP to allow more Substitutes. A Modest nature is chosen to attain needed 2HKO's on targets such as Umbreon and Snorlax, and this set does not require Speed.</p> <p>As this set heavily relies on Substitute, Cinccino beats it with ease, as it can smash through any Substitute that Meloetta puts up with Tail Slap. Fast Dark-types like Weavile and Krookodile can defeat Meloetta with their Dark STAB before it gets going. For this reason, Heracross or Mienshao are important teammates, as their ability to hit these Pokemon very hard is greatly appreciated. A Ground-type like Nidoqueen or Krookodile can deal with Raikou to allow Meloetta to avoid a Calm Mind war.</p> "
