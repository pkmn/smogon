        "description": "<p>Venusaur is a great sun sweeper because of its ability Chlorophyll, good Special Attack, and good movepool consisting of moves like Growth and Weather Ball. Weather Ball turns into a Fire-type move in the sun that can take care of Corviknight and Aegislash. Giga Drain is used to enable Venusaur to take care of Water- and Ground-types such as Keldeo, Toxapex, and Gastrodon while giving it a way to recover from Life Orb recoil. Sludge Bomb is used to OHKO Fairy-types such as Togekiss and can take care of Hydreigon and Kyurem-B after a single use of Growth. Growth should be used under sun to turn Venusaur into a dangerous sweeper. Earth Power is a niche option that can be used to hit Poison-type Pokemon such as Salazzle and Drapion. Venusaur should try to set up Growth on a predicted switch or on a passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Toxapex. It should also come in on via a U-turn or Memento from Whimsicott or on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex. A Modest nature allows it to net an OHKO on Aegislash and Corviknight.</p> <p>Whimsiscott is a mandatory teammate because of its access to Prankster Sunny Day and its ability to get Venusaur in safely with U-turn or Memento. Shiftry is a great partner to pair with Venusaur because of its Dark typing and Chlorophyll, allowing it to take care of Psychic-types that Venusaur can struggle with such as Jirachi and Indeedee. Shiftry can also take care of Dragapult with Sucker Punch. Celebi also goes great with Venusaur because it can help pressure Fighting-types such as Bulletproof Kommo-o and use Weather Ball to help Venusaur sweep in the Steel-type matchup. Celebi can also greatly help in the Poison-type matchup with Earth Power and Psychic. Ferrothorn is great to pair with Venusaur due to its access to entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes and ability to come in on Ice-type attacks from Cloyster and Alolan Ninetales and physical attacks such as Dracovish's Psychic Fang. Virizion is a great revenge killer that also deals with threats like Snorlax, Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Centiskorch against Normal-, Dark-, Ice-, and Bug-type matchups respectively. It can also take care of Alolan Ninetales with Smart Strike and act as an emergency Sunny Day settler if Whimsicott gets KOed.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Charizard isn't a great option, as it is outclassed by special attackers like Volcarona, Blacephalon, and Heatran. However, thanks to its great Speed, high Special Attack, and Solar Power with sun support, Charizard makes a below-average Choice Scarf user. It's able to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Dragapult and threaten them with its powerful attacks. Furthermore, Charizard's great Speed combined with its access to Dragon Pulse notably separates it from other Fire-types, as it helps tremendously with the Dragon matchup. However, Charizard faces competition with Blacephalon as a Choice Scarf user. Its Flying typing is beneficial because it grants immunity to Ground-type attacks, but most Ground-types tend to run Rock coverage anyway and it leaves Charizard even more vulnerable to Stealth Rock. Flamethrower is used in situations where Charizard can't afford missing such as against Choice Scarf Excadrill, which can sweep Fire pretty easily without Charizard to revenge kill it. Fire Blast is the more powerful option, best suited when Charizard wants to deal as much damage as possible against bulky Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini. Dragon Pulse is what separates Charizard from other Fire-types, as it muscles past Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Dragalge. Focus Blast hits bulky Pokemon that resist its Fire STAB moves such as Hydreigon, Heatran, and Rhyperior. Solar Beam is an option to hit Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon and Slowbro, but the types these Pokemon are on have weather in rain and sand, respectively, which can make Solar Beam unreliable. Due to how powerful its Fire attacks are under sun, it should either break holes in the opposing team early so its teammates can clean up or be preserved for a late-game sweep. Charizard is also great at revenge killing threats such as Dracozolt and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Torkoal is an amazing teammate because it sets up sun for Charizard with Drought, can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, and can set its own Stealth Rock to chip Pokemon like Dragapult to support Charizard's wallbreaking. Cinderace revenge kills faster Choice Scarf users like Dragapult and Latias with Sucker Punch and also checks special walls like Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Dragalge. Gunk Shot Cinderace, Sludge Bomb Volcanion, and Flash Cannon Heatran are great to check Fairy-types Charizard is threatened by like Azumarill and Tapu Fini. Volcanion absorbs Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Araquanid and checks Ground- and Rock-types like Hippowdon, Rhyperior, and Stakataka with Steam Eruption. Incineroar, Volcarona, and Heatran check Psychic-types like Tapu Lele, Latios, and Galarian Slowking. Incineroar provides momentum with Parting Shot or U-turn and is also a great check for Ghost-types like Spectrier and Dragapult thanks to its Dark typing. Furthermore, Knock Off hinders recovery on Pokemon running Leftovers and Black Sludge like Tapu Fini and Dragalge, respectively, for Charizard. Rotom-H and Victini are nice checks to Water-types like Toxapex and Mantine with their respective Electric coverage.</p> "

However, Alolan Raichu's underwhelming Special Attack makes it unable to OHKO walls like Tyranitar in sand, Heatran, and Ferrothorn, even with a Life Orb. Outside of Electric Terrain, Alolan Raichu is outsped by many threats like Spectrier, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.

Focus Blast heavily damages Dark-, Steel-, and Ice-types such as Zarude, Tyranitar, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem. Knock Off is useful for removing Galarian Slowking's Assault Vest, making it much easier to deal with for Electric teams. Grass Knot can be used over Knock Off to super effectively hit Water-types that are immune to Rising Voltage such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad and threaten Ground-types like Hippowdon. Nasty Plot can be used over Knock Off or Grass Knot to make Alolan Raichu a fearsome setup sweeper, taking advantage of Pokemon it forces out such as Pelipper and Amoonguss. However, replacing Grass Knot makes Alolan Raichu less effective in the Water and Ground matchups. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Alolan Raichu outspeed foes like Hydreigon, Volcarona, and Garchomp outside of Electric Terrain.</p> <p>Because of Alolan Raichu's mediocre bulk, it appreciates Volt Switch support from teammates like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W to bring it in safely. Tapu Koko is needed to set Electric Terrain for Alolan Raichu, letting it outspeed extremely fast threats thanks to Surge Surfer. Additionally, Tapu Koko can take on Dragon-types that Alolan Raichu struggles with, like Latias and Latios, thanks to its Dragon immunity and Dazzling Gleam and weaken shared checks such as Galarian Slowking, which Alolan Raichu can capitalize on in the late-game. Zeraora is a fantastic physical wallbreaker, pressuring troublesome specially defensive walls like Blissey and Galarian Slowking.

    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Nidoking is Ground's best special wallbreaker due to its various coverage moves boosted by Sheer Force and Life Orb, which let it break past physically defensive walls such as Skarmory, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn that are otherwise difficult for the type to break through. Nidoking also helps against types like Fairy, Flying, Steel, and Grass, as they lack sturdy defensive switch-ins to it. Its part-Poison typing provides useful defensive utility by letting it switch in on Fairy-type attacks and remove Toxic Spikes. It is additionally the only way for Ground teams to set Toxic Spikes themselves. However, while Nidoking can pressure many physically defensive walls, its Speed tier leaves it outsped and KOed by a plethora of offensive Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele, Excadrill, and Hydreigon, to name a few. Nidoking's mediocre bulk also makes it difficult to come in on Pokemon that it can deal with but can wear it down, such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu. This frailty also makes it vulnerable even to revenge killers lacking super effective moves such as Spectrier.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Nidoking is one of the best wallbreakers that Poison has to offer thanks to its powerful combination of Life Orb and Sheer Force. Its role as a wallbreaker is very important in the Steel matchup, as Earth Power + Flamethrower demolishes Steel teams after Heatran's Air Balloon has been popped. Nidoking also offers Poison an Electric immunity to prevent Volt Switch spam from Electric-types like Regieleki and Tapu Koko. Its access to BoltBeam coverage allows Nidoking to apply more pressure on Flying teams, which is nice, since Stealth Rock cannot pressure Flying much because of how often it uses Heavy-Duty Boots. Nidoking is, however, slower than many faster threats like Excadrill, Cinderace, and Keldeo and weak to Water-, Ice-, and Ground-type moves like Scald, Ice Beam, and Earthquake. These flaws mean, Nidoking can only come in on certain passive walls or slower Pokemon like Galarian Weezing, Skarmory, and Toxapex.</p> ",

Fire Blast over Flamethrower notably 2HKOes specially defensive Celesteela, but it is less reliable. Substitute is an option to make Nidoking harder to revenge kill, but it is very hard to fit.</p> <h1>Poison</h1> <p>Sludge Wave can be used to notably hit Clefable, because, otherwise, Nidoking may be at risk of losing its item from Knock Off.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ground</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Specially defensive walls such as Blissey and defensive Rotom-W can tank multiple hits from Nidoking and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Powerful revenge killers such as Alolan Raichu, Barraskewda, and Spectrier can force out Nidoking easily by threatening an OHKO with their STAB moves.

Ice-types like Kyurem, Weavile, and Mamoswine can KO Nidoking with Ice-type moves bar Ice Shard, which requires prior chip damage.

Blissey can set up Stealth Rock and generate momentum with Teleport, while Snorlax can set up Curse and recover off damage with Rest. Slowking can also generate momentum with Teleport or deal chip damage with Scald, while Mandibuzz can remove Nidoking's Life Orb with Knock Off and recover with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Naturally faster threats like both Urshifu formes, Tapu Lele, and Excadrill, and Choice Scarf users like Galarian Darmanitan and Heracross have no problem KOing Nidoking.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<p>Earth Power is the preferred STAB move, as it covers walls such as Heatran, physically defensive Gastrodon, and Tyranitar. Flamethrower provides great coverage against Steel- and Grass-types such as Skarmory, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu, hitting them for massive damage. Ice Beam nails Flying- and Dragon-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Garchomp, as well as potential switch-ins like Landorus-T, Latias, and Hydreigon. It also deals with Cradily better than Earth Power. Thunderbolt hits additional Flying-types that are neutral to Ice Beam such as Mantine, Pelipper, and Celesteela super effectively. Toxic Spikes can be used over Earth Power to support the team and quickly wear down grounded foes such as Porygon2. However, Nidoking's poor bulk gives it limited opportunities to set Toxic Spikes, and Earth Power is needed to break through Heatran. Sheer Force works well in tandem with Life Orb, preventing Nidoking from being worn down by Life Orb recoil and stacking damage boosts. A Timid nature allows Nidoking to outspeed the likes of Tapu Bulu and Heatran.</p> <p>Teammates such as Mamoswine, Landorus-T, and Excadrill appreciate Nidoking's ability to deal with threats like Skarmory and Celesteela. Hippowdon is a good partner, as its Sand Stream and Stealth Rock support wears down foes quickly for Nidoking. Additionally, its good bulk lets it come in on physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Garchomp, and Galarian Zapdos. Excadrill breaks through troublesome specially defensive walls such as Blissey and Slowking for Nidoking, beats Psychic- and Ice-types that it struggles against such as Tapu Lele, Alolan Ninetales, and Kyurem, and provides Rapid Spin support. Under Hippowdon's sand, Excadrill can also outspeed a handful of other offensive threats for Nidoking such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Dragapult, and Spectrier. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a Water immunity for Nidoking; Gastrodon's Recover makes it more reliable against threats like Barraskewda, Keldeo, and Tapu Fini, and Seismitoad can check the highly dangerous Azumarill. Mamoswine is a powerful wallbreaker that can revenge kill some faster threats that give Nidoking trouble such as Latias, Dragapult, and Thundurus-T with Ice Shard. Choice Scarf Landorus-T is able to revenge kill additional fast foes such as Spectrier, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona while providing entry hazard removal with Defog. Its Ground immunity is also useful to handle threats such as Excadrill and Garchomp. Bulk Up + Gravity Landorus-T is another option to make Nidoking's Earth Power more spammable while helping in matchups like Poison. Choice Scarf Krookodile can act as a dangerous revenge killer against Ghost- and Psychic-types like Spectrier, Victini, and Latios. Krookodile also provides an immunity against Psychic-type attacks directed at Nidoking.</p> "

Both Earth Power and Flamethrower are needed to deal with Steel's defensive cores members: Aegislash, Heatran, and Celesteela, but, Thunderbolt or Ice Beam is needed to pop Heatran's Air Balloon. Thunderbolt is useful for hitting Water- and Flying-types like Mantine and Slowbro, whereas Ice Beam helps with Ground-, Grass-, and Flying-types like Hippowdon, Appletun, and defensive Zapdos. Stealth Rock allows Nidoking to compress the role of entry hazard setter, but the presence of Heavy-Duty Boots reduces the need for hazards. Maximized Speed EVs allow Nidoking to Speed tie an opposing Nidoking and outpace Diggersby and Togekiss.</p> <p>Nidoking offers the entire team its Electric immunity, but Toxapex appreciates it more than other teammates due to its weakness to Electric. Toxapex's bulk and Scald allow it to switch into physical attackers that threaten Nidoking like Barraskewda and Cinderace while also shutting down setup sweepers like Weavile and Cloyster with Haze. Galarian Weezing provides a Dragon immunity, which is important to switch into a Draco Meteor or Dragon Darts that could KO Nidoking, while also having utilities like Defog to get rid of entry hazards, Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes to spread status, and Pain Split for longevity. Nidoking is weak to Psychic, so adding a Psychic-immune teammate like Skuntank or Drapion helps with Pokemon like Latias, Alakazam, and Tapu Lele. The former has Defog and Sucker Punch to revenge kill Psychic- and Ghost-types like Blacephalon and Alolan Raichu, while the latter has useful utilities like Knock Off, which removes Heavy-Duty Boots and makes Stealth Rock more effective and Whirlwind to phaze setup sweepers like Jirachi and Spectrier. Amoonguss is the best check to Ground-type Pokemon, notably Mold Breaker Excadrill, which threatens Nidoking and most of its teammates with Earthquake. Amoonguss also helps break Steel teams, as it has Spore to give Nidoking opportunities to come in while also forming a Regenerator core with Toxapex; together, they help Nidoking deal with Ground-, Rock-, and Water-type Pokemon like Excadrill, Rhyperior, Terrakion, and Urshifu-R. Nihilego runs Choice Scarf to revenge kill Pokemon like Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Victini and appreciates Nidoking's ability to threaten Steel-types it cannot properly deal with, like Ferrothorn and Aegislash. It has nice coverage moves like Thunderbolt, Dazzling Gleam, Power Gem, and Grass Knot, which improve quite a few matchups like Flying, Dragon, Fire, and Ground. Gengar is an option over Nihilego and supports Drapion or Skuntank in dealing with Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Slowbro with Shadow Ball, and it also deals with bulky Pokemon like Toxapex and Aegislash. Galarian Slowking's ability to sponge Psychic-type attacks that KO Nidoking from Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Latias is appreciated, and it forms a triple Regenerator core with Toxapex and Amoonguss, making Poison teams harder to break.</p> "

Moonblast can be used to help deal with Dark- and Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Garchomp, and it also wears down Swampert, which can wall Clefable's coverage moves. Moonblast also allows Clefable to threaten Dragon teams, which do not mind Clefable's coverage moves. Life Orb turns Clefable into a fearsome threat, allowing it to consistently 2HKO Toxapex, Celesteela, and Drapion at +1. Magic Guard also nullifies its recoil. Alternatively, Leftovers makes Clefable harder for types such as Grass, Dark, and Water to handle due to its increased longevity. 16 Speed EVs let Clefable outspeed defensive variants of Celesteela, while the remaining EVs maximize its physical bulk to better deal with threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Rillaboom, and Zeraora.</p> <p>Klefki's dual screens make it an ideal partner for Clefable, as these allow Clefable to set up more easily, as well as staying in to damage threats such as Choice Band Excadrill and Rillaboom. Klefki also provides a Poison immunity to come in against threats such as Nihilego, debilitates Clefable answers such as Gengar and Mantine with Thunder Wave and Toxic, and sets Spikes to wear down the opposing team. Tapu Bulu and Clefable both wear down their shared checks in Toxapex, Celesteela, and Melmetal. Tapu Bulu also sets Grassy Terrain to improve Clefable's longevity, deals with Swampert, Clear Smog Gastrodon, and Regieleki for it, and pressures Heatran for Clefable not running Thunderbolt. This allows Clefable to sweep Steel teams late-game. Tapu Lele checks Poison-types like Nidoking and Dragalge, allows Clefable to deal with Scizor by setting Psychic Terrain, and deals with Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Kyurem, especially if Clefable doesn't have Moonblast. Clefable repays this by wearing down Steel-types such as Aegislash and Corviknight, which wall Tapu Lele. Tapu Koko pivots Clefable into passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, is a fast teammate that deals with Urshifu-R, Weavile, and Cinderace, and can deal with Water-types such as Mantine, Slowking, and Toxapex for Clefable not running Thunderbolt. Azumarill appreciates its checks in Mantine, Volcanion, and Ferrothorn being worn down, as this allows it to clean types such as Flying, Fire, and Steel late-game. In return, Azumarill deals with Alolan Marowak, Galarian Slowking, and Nidoking, which Clefable struggles against. Alternatively, Calm Mind Tapu Fini forms a special wallbreaking core with Clefable and relieves it from having to use Moonblast, as Tapu Fini deals with Dragon-, Ground-, and Fire-types such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Heatran. Mimikyu is a Swords Dance sweeper that deals with Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Spectrier, Gengar, and Hatterene. Alolan Ninetales appreciates Clefable's ability to take out Celesteela and Toxapex, (AC) as this allows Alolan Ninetales to clean Flying and Water teams late-game, and can also provide support with Grudge.</p> "

A Choice Scarf allows it to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Zarude, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar, making it one of the best revenge killers for Ghost-type teams.</p> <p>Gengar has a unique role in absorbing Toxic Spikes, as Ghost teams don't have reliable entry hazard removal to prevent teammates like Galarian Corsola and Mimikyu from being worn down. Galarian Corsola takes on and burns physical attackers such as Excadrill and Zeraora, and it softens up the opposing team for Gengar by setting Stealth Rock. Bulky foes such as Toxapex and Gastrodon can be pressured by Calm Mind Spectrier, which can also spread burns with Will-O-Wisp, wearing down special walls like Drapion and Celesteela. Swords Dance Aegislash deals with Hatterene and Clefable, and it appreciates Gengar removing fast threats such as Zarude and Hydreigon for it. Mimikyu can beat Sucker Punch users like Bisharp and removes Dark-types such as Galarian Moltres, which pose a threat to Gengar and its teammates. Setting Spikes, Froslass helps wear down Pokemon like Toxapex and Heatran to allow Gengar to sweep late-game. Dragapult can handle troublesome Dragon-types like Kyurem and Garchomp, as well as pressuring Volcarona, which can use Gengar as setup fodder.</p> "

Sludge Wave threatens Grass- and Fairy-types such as Rillaboom, Togekiss, Primarina, and Clefable. It also massively damages any unresisted foe such as Hydreigon or Indeedee, both of which can otherwise take or ignore Shadow Ball. Focus Blast provides very important coverage against Tyranitar, Diggersby, and Incineroar. Thunderbolt pressures Water-types such as Keldeo and Toxapex, as well as Flying-types such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Mantine. Trick can cripple bulky walls such as Chansey, which is otherwise hard to wear down. Gengar's Special Attack and Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature and Choice Specs allow it to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. It's also very frail, so it should be brought in against resisted attacks or predicted switches.</p> <p>Dragapult serves as an efficient late-game cleaner with Dragon Dance, being able to clean teams easily and outspeed almost the entire metagame after a boost. Choice Scarf Dragapult can also be used to revenge kill fast threats such as Zeraora, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Swift Swim Kingdra. Mimikyu is a great late-game cleaner, as its ability Disguise allows it to blanket check many Pokemon and pick off weakened foes in tandem with Swords Dance and Shadow Sneak. Its unique Ghost / Fairy typing also helps it play a crucial role in revenge killing Dark-types for the team. Galarian Corsola provides a defensive backbone for the team thanks to its good bulk, which allows it to annoy physical attackers with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Strength Sap. In addition, its access to Stealth Rock makes Gengar a more consistent wallbreaker. Aegislash is incredibly versatile, as it can be a specially defensive wall with SubToxic, wearing down special attackers such as Jirachi and Celebi, or a Swords Dance wallbreaker. Additionally, it can check other Fairy-types that Choice Specs Gengar has trouble revenge killing, such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Jellicent provides a useful Water immunity for Ghost teams, keeping Dracovish, Keldeo, and Barraskewda in check. Alolan Marowak and SubCM Chandelure are powerful wallbreakers that easily handle Ice, Grass, and Steel teams. Alolan Marowak provides a useful Electric immunity for Ghost teams thanks to its ability Lightning Rod. Chandelure can also punish Sucker Punch users such as Bisharp and Skuntank, which are huge threats to Ghost teams.

Neutralizing Gas allows it to hinder Pokemon that rely on their abilities to function well, nullifying Crawdaunt's Adaptability, Jirachi's Serene Grace to reduce its flinch chance, and even Hatterene's Magic Bounce to set up Toxic Spikes. Additionally, its ability nullifies Levitate, making Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Hydreigon vulnerable to its Toxic Spikes. Finally, Neutralizing Gas also allows Galarian Weezing to prevent Regenerator users such as Amoonguss and Toxapex from healing by switching out, allowing Fairy teams to make significant progress against Poison teams. Sludge Bomb allows it to target Pokemon such as Azumarill as well as poison walls such as Mantine and Mandibuzz. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Diggersby and Zeraora. Toxic Spikes cripples foes such as Dragapult and Urshifu-R, allowing its teammates like Azumarill, Mimikyu, and Togekiss to sweep easily. Pain Split allows Galarian Weezing to regain health throughout the match and wear down the foe. Black Sludge is especially useful due to Pain Split not always being reliable. Maximum HP and Defense EVs alongside a Bold nature make Galarian Weezing as physically bulky as possible, allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Zeraora and Diggersby.</p> <p>All of Galarian Weezing's offensive teammates appreciate its ability to set up Toxic Spikes, which allows them to break through Pokemon such as Swampert and Porygon2. Galarian Weezing can also help teammates set up more easily by crippling physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Its secondary Poison typing also allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes for its teammates. Tapu Lele can take on Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss with Psychic for Galarian Weezing. Additionally, it can threaten a majority of Defog users with Thunderbolt and Moonblast, like Mantine and Mandibuzz. Tapu Bulu can take on and pressure Ground- and Water-type Pokemon like Garchomp, Swampert, and Urshifu-R. Tapu Koko can deal with Flying-type Pokemon such as Celesteela.

Galarian Weezing also helps against opposing Terrain, allowing teammates like Skuntank to use priority without Psychic Terrain and helping other revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gengar and Choice Scarf Drapion to beat Alolan Raichu by overriding its Electric Terrain. Seeing as Poison teams are typically weak to Ground-type Pokemon such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Band Mamoswine, and Diggersby, Levitate is extremely crucial. Furthermore, Galarian Weezing's Fairy typing allows it to switch into Dark- and Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Dragapult and beat them in return with Strange Steam. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Mimikyu and Tyranitar. A physically defensive spread is used to more easily check massive threats in Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance Garchomp. Clear Smog or Flamethrower can be used over Defog if the team has Skuntank to fill the Defog role. The former prevents setup sweepers from setting up on Galarian Weezing for free, and the latter hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Seeing as it relies on Pain Split for recovery, Galarian Weezing should be carefully preserved throughout a match in order to switch into Ground-type attacks as well as Defog away hazards. This means it should avoid switching into strong attacks such as Pelipper's Hurricane and Heliolisk's Thunderbolt.</p> <p>The entire Poison team appreciates Galarian Weezing's Ground immunity. Salazzle is one of the best partners for Galarian Weezing, as it can beat Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Corviknight. Toxapex, Vileplume, and Drapion form a good defensive core with Galarian Weezing. Toxapex can switch into a myriad of attacks such as Bisharp's Iron Head and Aegislash's Flash Cannon, as well as neuter setup sweepers with Haze and scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Galarian Darmanitan. Vileplume can switch into Mold Breaker Excadrill's Earthquake and remove pressure by checking Ground-type Pokemon with its defensive typing, Giga Drain, and Strength Sap. Skuntank provides a crucial Psychic immunity, meaning it can switch into and pick off Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Alolan Raichu, and Indeedee with Sucker Punch. Skuntank can also run Defog, freeing up Galarian Weezing to run Clear Smog or Flamethrower. Other offensive Pokemon such as Toxitricity and Gengar are able to beat faster threats such as Pelipper, Corviknight, and Obstagoon that Galarian Weezing struggles against.</p> "

Seismic Toss allows Chansey to not be completely passive, which lets it wear down opposing special attackers very quickly and break most Substitutes. These two moves paired with the amazing recovery of Soft-Boiled allow Chansey to wear down types that rely on their special attackers, namely Electric, Poison, and Psychic. Teleport can be used on its last slot to help Chansey act as a great pivot and get its offensive teammates in safely, or it can use Toxic to put opposing offensive Pokemon on a timer and make it harder for your opponent to keep them in. Its ability in Natural Cure also allows it to absorb status ailments for its offensive teammates and works well with Teleport when scouting for status moves.

Because Water teams are typically good at setting Stealth Rock against Flying, it is important to give Gyarados Heavy-Duty Boots in order to make sure it is as healthy as possible when attempting to sweep. While often used to handle Water, Gyarados is effective in other matchups too; for example, Ground teams have no defensive answer to the perfect Water + Grass coverage that Gyarados uses. While Gyarados is very powerful against Fire teams, keep in mind that sun halves Waterfall's damage output, it will find much more success if Torkoal is either removed or weakened before attempting to sweep. Intimidate is preferred in order to give Gyarados more opportunities to set up, as the matchups it is most effective in only require a single Attack boost, but Moxie is another option to make sweeping slightly easier if Gyarados can find a KO.</p> <p>Gyarados is fairly self-sufficient in its particular matchups and doesn't rely on its teammates for too much. However, Xatu's dual screens make it much easier to set up.

While Gyarados does not require Defog support, Mandibuzz can still act as a support Pokemon with its slow U-turn to bring it in safely on setup fodder.

Volt Switch is used to grab momentum, (RC) mainly against types that don't commonly carry an Electric immunity such as Psychic, Fairy, Ghost, and Dark. Heat Wave hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Aegislash, and along with Volt Switch, makes Zapdos able to break through Steel teams.

Magnezone's ability to trap Excadrill is amazing for Zapdos, as it can spam Volt Switch and beat Steel teams with it removed. Magnezone's defensive typing is also notable to take on Ice- and Rock-type attacks from the likes of Weavile and Tyranitar as well as Dragon Dance Dragapult. Alolan Raichu's Knock Off removes Galarian Slowking's Assault Vest in the matchup against Poison teams, allowing Zapdos to 2HKO the entire team with Hurricane.

    "overview": "<h1>Flying</h1> <p>Galarian Zapdos stands out as a good wallbreaker for Flying teams thanks to its good Attack stat, excellent coverage, and part-Fighting typing, which allows it to help against matchups such as Dark, Steel, and Normal. Close Combat, Brave Bird, and Blaze Kick or Stomping Tantrum hit almost the entire metagame for neutral damage, and it is able to pivot against checks like Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Zapdos with U-turn. Defiant is useful to pressure Defoggers such as Mandibuzz, Galarian Weezing, and Corviknight, preventing them from removing entry hazards off the field. It also takes advantage of Intimidate from Landorus-T, becoming almost unwallable after an Attack boost. However, Galarian Zapdos is outsped and revenge killed by many threats such as Weavile, Blacephalon, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Spectrier due to its only average Speed stat. While Galarian Zapdos is good at wallbreaking, it can easily be worn down in a match through Brave Bird recoil and Stealth Rock damage. Each of its moves can be easy to switch into, meaning that Steel-type core of Aegislash + Heatran + Celesteela can deal with it if they predict correctly. Lastly, using Galarian Zapdos comes at the cost of not being able to run Zapdos.</p> <h1>Fighting</h1> <p>Galarian Zapdos's high Attack stat combined with its excellent STAB combination and a great ability in Defiant allows it to act as a fearsome wallbreaker on Fighting-type teams. Its typing allows it to help in the Bug-, Fighting-, and Grass-type matchups, notably checking Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Rillaboom. Its STAB combination allows to hit a large portion of the metagame for neutral or super effective damage, while U-turn pivots out of tough matchups and maintains momentum. However, its reliance on Brave Bird to beat troublesome Pokemon such as Toxapex and Galarian Weezing wears it down quickly, thus affecting its wallbreaking potential. Despite its fine Speed tier allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Mimikyu and Nidoking while Speed tying with Pokemon such as Choice Band Victini, it can be easily revenge killed by faster threats such as Alolan Ninetales, Tornadus-T, and Zeraora or Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Darmanitan and Tapu Lele.</p> ",

Aegislash can scout for its moves with King's Shield and can also badly poison it with Toxic. However, it has to be careful of Galarian Zapdos locked into Blaze Kick, as Defiant can give it an Attack boost if Aegislash uses King's Shield.

Blaze Kick is mainly used to hit Aegislash, which otherwise completely walls Galarian Zapdos. Stomping Tantrum can be used as a more powerful alternative to hit both Aegislash and Heatran super effectively, but it risks being Choice-locked against Skarmory and Celesteela. U-turn lets Galarian Zapdos pivot against checks such as Slowbro and Galarian Corsola and bring in a teammate to deal with them. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Galarian Zapdos to outspeed threats like Hydreigon, Kyurem, Mimikyu, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Landorus-T is an invaluable teammate, as it switches into Electric-type attacks from foes like Zeraora and Tapu Koko, provides Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and U-turn support, and can revenge kill foes like Dragapult and Spectrier with Choice Scarf.

In return, Galarian Zapdos can pressure walls that give Landorus-T trouble such as Celesteela, Galarian Weezing, and Swampert, as well as Defoggers like Corviknight and Mandibuzz thanks to Defiant. Celesteela or Corviknight can be used to provide a switch-in against Psychic-, Ice-, and Fairy-type attacks from foes like Latias, Kyurem, and Alolan Ninetales. Skarmory can also be used as an excellent physically defensive wall, shutting down threatening physical attackers such as Weavile, Mamoswine, and Urshifu-R more easily. In addition, it provides Spikes support, making Galarian Zapdos more difficult to switch into. Mantine provides a useful Water immunity, handling threats that can overpower Galarian Zapdos like Barraskewda and Kingdra. Thundurus-T is also a useful way to deal with Water teams, as it can defeat the entirety of it with Thunderbolt + Grass Knot while being hard to stop after a Nasty Plot and Agility boost. Galarian Moltres is a great tool against Psychic, Ghost, and Poison teams, notably dealing with answers to Galarian Zapdos such as Slowbro, Galarian Corsola, and Galarian Weezing.

Keldeo can help Galarian Zapdos in dealing with physical walls like Hippowdon and Skarmory a bit better, and it appreciates Galarian Zapdos's ability to deal with special walls such as Blissey and Slowking. Choice Scarf Terrakion can clean through teams weakened by Galarian Zapdos and also helps in dealing with Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T, which would otherwise trouble Galarian Zapdos, or weakening shared checks with a Swords Dance set. Choice Scarf Buzzwole can clean through teams weakened by Galarian Zapdos thanks to Beast Boost while also having Earthquake and Leech Life to beat Electric- and Psychic-types like Zeraora and Choice Specs Latios.

Using its good defensive typing, Celebi can take Water-type attacks such as Seismitoad and Keldeo's Hydro Pump under rain, and in return it appreciates Mew's ability to Taunt Defoggers such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Pelipper in order to keep its Stealth Rock on the field.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its decent bulk, typing, and Speed, Cosmic Power Mew is an excellent late-game wincon on Psychic teams, finding setup opportunities against matchups such as Steel, Water, and Electric. Stored Power's Base Power is boosted as Mew sets up Cosmic Power and when Weakness Policy is triggered, allowing it to overwhelm bulky Psychic-resistant Pokemon like Corviknight. Taunt denies defensive counterplay in the form of Toxic, Whirlwind, and Haze from users such as Aegislash, Hippowdon, and Toxapex, respectively; it also prevents bulky setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Corviknight and Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Clefable from boosting alongside Mew. On the other hand, Body Press lets Mew KO Dark-types such as Bisharp, Hydreigon, and Weavile without as much help from its teammates. Weakness Policy takes advantage of the opposing team's need to strike Mew with super effective moves to take it down before it has accumulated Cosmic Power boosts, allowing it to OHKO Zeraora if it uses Knock Off on Mew after a Cosmic Power, and takes advantage of Mew's weakness to U-turn, which is commonly used by pivots such as Landorus-T and Corviknight. Alternatively, Lum Berry may be used to deal with faster Toxic users such as Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T. Maximum Speed with a Timid nature lets Mew outspeeds threats such as Urshifu-R and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Tapu Lele is an excellent teammate, as it handles Dark- and Dragon-types that overwhelm Mew even after a Cosmic Power boost, such as Choice Band Weavile, Zarude, and Dragapult. Slowbro checks strong physical attackers such as Barraskewda and Excadrill for Mew and can utilize a Colbur or Kasib berry to deal with Dark- or Ghost-types, respectively. Trick users such as Victini, Latias, and Jirachi can lure and debilitate defensive walls, such as Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and Mantine, which check Mew if it's not running Taunt. Victini also KOes Steel-types like Celesteela and Aegislash which give Mew a hard time if not running Taunt. Choice Scarf Jirachi and Latias can also utilize Healing Wish, allowing Mew to try to set up a second time once the opposing team has been weakened. Galarian Slowking is a specially defensive wall that checks Aegislash and removes Toxic Spikes for Mew on switch-in. Hatterene bounces back entry hazards and checks Dark-types such as Galarian Moltres and Zarude. Hatterene also benefits from Body Press Mew, as Hatterene is walled by Steel-types, and in return deals with Toxapex that variants of Mew without Taunt are vulnerable to.</p> "

Focus Blast is used to check Steel- and Dark-types like Heatran and Tyranitar. Thunderbolt hits Water- and Flying-types like Crawdaunt, Mantine, and Celesteela. A Colbur Berry allows Mew to take Bisharp's Sucker Punch while helping with other Dark-type attacks.

Tapu Lele is a strong wallbreaker that can set Psychic Terrain for Mew, protecting it from priority and boosting its Psychic, while Hatterene can keep entry hazards off the field with Magic Bounce.

Toxic is great on Crobat, as it allows Poison to make progress against Pokemon it struggles to break through such as Landorus-T, Mantine, and Kyurem.

Knock Off can OHKO targets that comfortably tank Aqua Jet, like Amoonguss, Aegislash, and Gastrodon, after a Belly Drum. It also has the added utility of removing items, like Toxapex's Black Sludge or Mantine's Heavy-Duty Boots. Substitute is used to avoid status conditions and set up on defensive Pokemon like Torkoal and defensive Aegislash when Azumarill is behind Light Screen. Brick Break can also be used, as it hits Pokemon like Melmetal for more damage. Play Rough is an option for targets that survive both Knock Off and Aqua Jet, like Hydreigon. 4 HP EVs allow Azumarill to trigger its Sitrus Berry after a Belly Drum every time. The Speed EVs allow it to outpace most defensive Pokemon like Aegislash and Celesteela. It is a good idea to set up Belly Drum with dual screens active or in front of a passive Pokemon, since Azumarill usually only gets once chance to use it. You also don't want to use Belly Drum if Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain will still be active, since it prevents Aqua Jet from being used.</p> <p>Klefki is an invaluable teammate because of its dual screens—allowing Azumarill to set up more easily, Spikes, and Steel typing providing a Poison immunity and resistance to Ice.

Clefable's utility options in Stealth Rock and Knock Off cripples foes and makes it easier for Azumarill to sweep as well. Tapu Bulu is great because it can beat Electric-types like Rotom-W and Alolan Raichu. It can revenge kill threats like Zapdos and Thundurus-T with a Choice Scarf or break through defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Toxapex with Substitute + Swords Dance. Tapu Koko is a great offensive pivot that provides STAB Thunderbolt and Dazzling Gleam to hit troublesome Water- and Dragon-types like Mantine, Toxapex, Latios, and Kyurem for Azumarill.

Heavy Slam is vital to check foes like Tapu Bulu and Clefable, which can trouble Steelix with their own setup, and also catches Whimsicott switching in to lock Steelix into a setup move with Encore. Body Press capitalizes on Iron Defense boosts to deal with Pokemon like Zarude, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Darmanitan. Steelix uses Substitute to block Leech Seed users like Ferrothorn, which interfere with its Leftovers recovery, and Iron Defense makes it much more difficult to break. Additionally, Substitute punishes foes like Weavile, Zarude, and Rillaboom switching out of Steelix, as it grants free Iron Defense setup or chip damage with Heavy Slam or Body Press.</p> <p>Steelix provides neutralities against Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu, Zarude, and Rillaboom and Ice-type Pokemon like Weavile, Arctozolt, and Galarian Darmanitan. Furthermore, Steelix can switch into common Toxic users like Klefki and Blissey for its teammates. Landorus-T is a reliable Ground-immune and Fighting-resistant teammate that can switch into Excadrill and Garchomp. Mamoswine is greatly appreciated for checking opposing Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoking, and Garchomp, as well as threatening Dragon- and Flying-types like Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Galarian Zapdos. Garchomp is an incredibly powerful wallbreaker that checks troublesome Pokemon like Volcarona and Victini. Gastrodon is extremely important to Ground teams for its Water immunity against Pokemon such as Kingdra, Barraskewda, and Volcanion. Nidoking is a potent special wallbreaker that breaks past Pokemon like Corviknight, Thundurus-T, and Tornadus-T with coverage moves in Thunderbolt and Ice Beam. Furthermore, it greatly pressures Aegislash and Kommo-o, which use Steelix as setup fodder.</p> "

With a spammable Technician-boosted STAB move in Bullet Punch and useful coverage in Knock Off and Superpower, Scizor is able to greatly threaten common types such as Fairy, Ice, Flying, and Dragon. Scizor's typing and access to reliable recovery in Roost allow it to check Psychic-, Fairy-, and Poison-types that Bug teams can often struggle against, such as Tapu Lele and Nihilego. However, Scizor's coverage is very one-dimensional, causing it to struggle in other matchups such as Water, Electric, and Fire. Furthermore, it is reliant on Bullet Punch for its damage output against faster targets, meaning that it can be easily revenge killed by Pokemon that resist Steel such as Heatran and Urshifu-R.

It also helps against threats such as Choice Scarf Weavile and Excadrill that can clean Rock-teams late-game.

Gastrodon is also an option in lieu of Swampert, as it is able to check prominent threats to Mantine's team such as Tapu Koko while also having reliable recovery. Slowking is able to switch into powerful Psychic-types like Latios and Choice Specs Tapu Lele, which can otherwise overpower Mantine. Urshifu-R and Keldeo also appreciate Mantine switching in on certain Psychic- and Fairy-type special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Hatterene that threaten them. In return, they can defeat foes such as Bisharp and Terrakion, respectively, for Mantine. Wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt and Tapu Fini appreciate Mantine's Defog, which allows them to enter the field safely to defeat walls that pressure Mantine such as Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and Chansey. Mantine also enjoys having Lanturn on its team, as it provides an Electric immunity and Heal Bell support while also taking on Choice Specs Zapdos more reliably and providing slow Volt Switch support to the team. However, it should be noted that Lanturn is primarily seen on stall teams. Setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Tapu Fini, Cloyster, and Suicune welcome Mantine's ability to remove Toxic Spikes, which jeopardize their ability to set up.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Steel</h1> <p>Skarmory's typing allows it to easily find itself a spot in Steel teams for providing the much-needed Ground immunity and Fighting neutrality. Skarmory has access to Spikes, making it the primary setter for its team while freeing up Ferrothorn to run more utility options such as Thunder Wave and Stealth Rock. Its high Defense stat and great typing allow Skarmory to check various physically offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Urshifu-R with the help of Roost, Rocky Helmet, and Toxic. Moreover, having access to Roost and Toxic sets Skarmory apart from its competitors in Celesteela and Corviknight. Skarmory is an easy target for Electric-types such as Zapdos and Zeraora, which can grab momentum against Skarmory with their respective coverage. Furthermore, Skarmory can be trapped and eliminated by Magnezone, which enables a safer win route for Bulk Up Zeraora, and it is also vulnerable to Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Victini, Blacephalon, and Volcarona, which all pose a threat to it. Skarmory's Special Defense is low, making it weak to common special attackers in the tier such as Blacephalon, Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Being unable to touch any Ghost-type Pokemon outside of Toxic causes Skarmory to lose momentum heavily, especially against Substitute users such as non-Choice Specs Aegislash, Dragapult, and Spectrier, which all force it out.</p> <h1>Flying</h1> <p>Often appearing on balance teams, Skarmory's incredible Defense stat allows it to check many physical attackers such as Melmetal and Bisharp for its teammates. Due to its excellent typing, Skarmory can provide a key neutrality to Ice-type attacks, allowing it to check powerful Ice-types such as Mamoswine and Weavile. Skarmory's access to Spikes, Whirlwind, and Roost allows it to carve out a niche for itself on Flying teams. As a result of its low HP and Special Defense, Skarmory is unable to tank resisted hits from special attackers such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Choice Specs Tapu Lele and can be worn down by walls using special attacking moves like Scald from Toxapex. Skarmory faces competition from Corviknight and Celesteela, as they both share the same typing. Corviknight and Celesteela can tank both physical and special attacks, while Skarmory is relegated to tanking physical attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Skarmory serves as the primary Spikes setter for its team, allowing offensive teammates such as Bisharp and Excadrill to wallbreak more consistently throughout the game. Body Press synergizes well with Skarmory's bulk and is especially helpful in the mirror matchup against Pokemon such as Bisharp, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran on the switch, as well against Dark-types such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Roost helps Skarmory to stay healthy throughout the match against foes such as Urshifu-R, Excadrill, and Tyranitar. Whirlwind is used to prevent setup from Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragapult while also generating passive chip damage if Spikes were set beforehand. Toxic can be used over Whirlwind to cripple Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Mantine. Rocky Helmet complements Skarmory's physical bulk and typing excellently, as contact move users such as Urshifu-R and Weavile as well as U-turn and Flip Turn users such as Landorus-T, Scizor, Swampert, and Barraskewda will all be worn down by it. Sturdy allows Skarmory to set Spikes or use Toxic on a foe that can knock it out from full health if necessary. Furthermore, Sturdy allows Skarmory to deal damage against troublesome Pokemon that threaten Steel teams, such as Hydreigon. An Impish nature and maximum HP and Defense investment make Skarmory as tanky as possible against the aforementioned physical threats such as Urshifu-R, Excadrill, and Landorus-T.</p> <p>Having access to Spikes makes Skarmory a valuable teammate, as it allows its offensive teammates such as Excadrill, Aegislash, Melmetal, and Bisharp to have an easier time against common walls such as Toxapex, Porygon2, and Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn is one of the best teammates for Skarmory, as the duo form an effective entry hazard-stacking core with Ferrothorn's Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Skarmory can make up for Ferrothorn's weakness to Fighting, while Ferrothorn takes care of Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W for Skarmory and provides a resistance to Water. Heatran provides the much-needed Fire immunity against Pokemon like Blacephalon and Hydreigon, while Skarmory can take on Ground-type attacks such as Earthquake from Garchomp and Excadrill. Furthermore, Heatran's common moves in Toxic and Magma Storm can deal immense chip damage when combined with Skarmory's Spikes. Excadrill takes care of Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zeraora if it is holding a Choice Scarf and can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin to preserve Skarmory's Sturdy. Aegislash makes a good partner for Skarmory, as it relieves the pressure from Skarmory to handle Fighting-type attacks. This is especially important against Choice-locked foes such as Urshifu-R, which will have to avoid being heavily punished by Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Furthermore, Aegislash helps greatly against Psychic-types such as Hatterene and Tapu Lele, which Skarmory generally struggle against. Bisharp's ability in Defiant also deters Defog from Pokemon such as Mantine and Zapdos, and its typing allows it to shine against Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Galarian Slowking, Slowking, Galarian Corsola, and Spectrier.</p> "

Whirlwind can be used over it to phaze opposing setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Dragon Dance Dragapult. In conjunction with Skarmory's bulk it can be used to shuffle opposing teams, slowly damaging them via Spikes. Body Press uses Skarmory's enormous Defense stat to hit threats such as Galarian Darmanitan and Tyranitar. Roost provides Skarmory with reliable recovery, allowing it to preserve Sturdy as well as consistently providing an answer to foes such as Cloyster and Excadrill. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers as well as pivots that use Flip Turn and U-turn by taking a chunk of their HP. Leftovers allows Skarmory to gain passive recovery, which it in turn gives it more chances to use its ability Sturdy. Sturdy is Skarmory's best ability, as it can allow Skarmory to survive attacks from foes such as Heliolisk and Volcarona when at full HP, and it can proceed to OHKO the former with Body Press. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature allows Skarmory to be as bulky as possible, as well as boosting the power of Body Press.</p> <p>Mantine is an excellent teammate for Skarmory, as its superb Special Defense allows it to wall special attackers such as Volcarona, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Hydreigon. In return, Skarmory is able to handle foes like Dragonite and Dragapult. Skarmory appreciates the presence of Landorus-T to OHKO threats such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos. Landorus-T can also switch in on foes such as Zapdos after it has been Choice-locked into Thunderbolt. Skarmory then reciprocates this by acting as a switch-in to physical attackers such as Mamoswine that would otherwise OHKO Landorus-T with Icicle Crash. Defensive Zapdos can provide a key neutrality to Electric-type attacks as well as act as a special wall, taking attacks from foes such as Tapu Koko under Electric Terrain. Moreover, it can run a Toxic + Substitute set to wear down opposing walls such as Mandibuzz that Skarmory would find hard to deal with. Skarmory can then assist Zapdos by taking on potent physical attackers such as Swords Dance Terrakion that Zapdos would otherwise fall to. Zapdos can also run a Choice Specs set that appreciates Skarmory's ability to wear down foes such as Slowking with Spikes. Teammates such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres appreciate the presence of Spikes on the field, with the former potentially OHKOing foes such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Mew and the latter becoming a much more potent sweeper, being able to guarantee an OHKO on foes such as Slowking. In return, Galarian Zapdos is able to prevent foes from removing Spikes via Defog carelessly due to Defiant. Galarian Moltres is able to check the fearsome Spectrier that would otherwise OHKO Skarmory after it has been inflicted with a status condition. Thundurus-T and Dragonite are also good teammates for Skarmory, as both are helped by Spikes chipping away at their respective checks, and the former can absorb Electric-type attacks for it. Knock Off users such as Tornadus-T allow teammates to take advantage of Skarmory's entry hazards, as it can force foes that normally run Heavy-Duty Boots such as Victini and Cinderace to switchin less often. Moreover, Tornadus-T can use Taunt on opposing Defog users such as Mantine and Corviknight to prevent them from ridding the field of Skarmory's Spikes.</p> "

Foul Play acts both as a countermeasure for Pokemon like Scizor and Azumarill that would otherwise use Porygon2 as setup bait and as an attacking move to hit other powerful physical threats like Alolan Marowak and Excadrill. Ice Beam gives Porygon2 good coverage to deal with Dragon threats like Hydreigon and Noivern more easily as well as certain other offensive threats like Diggersby and Hawlucha. Toxic allows Porygon2 to wear down defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Gastrodon that may otherwise attempt to switch in. Teleport is another option to be considered, as it allows Porygon2 to bring in frail offensive Normal-type threats like Diggersby, Heliolisk, and Indeedee-M safely and create momentum.

Ditto makes for a good partner due to its ability to punish offensive setup sweepers that may use Porygon2 as setup fodder like Belly Drum Azumarill, Swords Dance Excadrill, and Bulk Up Urshifu-S. Ditto and Porygon2 also work well together due to their ability to PP stall Poison and Water teams by copying Regenerator from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Heliolisk provides Porygon2 with an easier time against Water due to its great ability in Dry Skin for absorbing powerful Water-type attacks from wallbreakers like Dracovish. Bewear appreciates Porygon2's ability to mitigate its low Speed by paralyzing faster Pokemon like Hydreigon and Kyurem with Discharge.

Protect adds passive recovery via Leftovers and works with Substitute and Pressure to PP stall foes; Protect also allows Suicune to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, and Latios. Substitute can also be used to block status conditions such as poison and burn that would nullify Suicune's passive recovery and therefore prevent it from effectively PP stalling. It can create a Substitute for free on Pokemon like defensive Celesteela. Suicune's HP investment allows it to form a Substitute with 101 HP, which doesn't break after one Night Shade or Seismic Toss from Galarian Corsola or Blissey.</p> <p>Toxapex is able to provide Toxic Spikes support, which helps Suicune stall out its foes. In addition, it can stop setup sweepers like Bisharp with Haze. Swampert provides an Electric immunity to the team and phazes setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Dragapult with Roar. Furthermore, Swampert can set Stealth Rock, which helps Suicune wear down opposing teams. Urshifu-R is good to break past many potential checks to Suicune, such as Water-immune Pokemon such as Cradily, Seismitoad, and Mantine, with Close Combat and Thunder Punch. Tapu Fini provides a Dragon immunity while also setting up Misty Terrain, which prevents Suicune from becoming statused, and threatening Suicune's Dragon-type checks like Latios and Hydreigon. In turn, Suicune can assist Tapu Fini by spreading burns and PP stalling its checks such as Skuntank. Choice Scarf Tapu Fini also helps to weaken foes with Trick and Knock Off. Mantine not only removes hazards like Toxic Spikes, but also offers a Ground immunity. In addition, it provides a key neutrality to Grass. Mantine also has Haze to stifle setup Pokemon like Belly Drum Azumarill and Volcarona. Slowking assists Suicune and the team by filling the role of a specially defensive pivot, bringing in Suicune with ease and countering Pokemon it struggles against such as Toxapex and Toxicroak. Teammates with Heal Bell like Vaporeon help with Suicune's vulnerability to status chip damage.</p> "

Weavile enhances the matchup against Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Garchomp, while Tyranitar handles Kyurem for Weavile. Mandibuzz forms a solid defensive backbone with Tyranitar for Dark teams. As it takes neutral damage from Bug- and Fighting-type attacks, Mandibuzz can take on such attacks directed at Tyranitar, while Tyranitar can comfortably tank BoltBeam coverage with its excellent special bulk. Moreover, Mandibuzz provides Toxic and Defog; the former allows Tyranitar to run Thunder Wave freely and the latter prevents entry hazards from damaging Tyranitar. Hydreigon is a fantastic wallbreaker that can handle Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as well as directly switching into Water- and Grass-type moves for Tyranitar. Mandibuzz and Hydreigon also provide Ground immunities for Tyranitar. Bisharp breaks past Fairy-types such as Clefable and Klefki and threatens Defog users such as Mantine and Zapdos due to Defiant, helping keep Stealth Rock up.

It can also act as a Fighting-type check with its good typing in Ghost / Dark, giving it a immunity to this type while also being immune to Rapid Spin. It can also cripple physical attackers that threaten Dark teams such as Mamoswine with Will-O-Wisp. Using Knock Off it can get rid of important items such as Black Sludge and Leftovers from certain Pokemon, helping it stallbreak more efficiently. Sableye runs a fully defensive spread to increase its overall defense, being able to take hits from Galarian Zapdos and Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Sableye pairs well with Tyranitar and Mandibuzz, covering for Sableye's average defenses and taking care of powerful attackers such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Bisharp respectively, forming a good defensive core. Mandibuzz can Defog hazards away so Sableye can enter more comfortably onto the field. Also, a teammate such as Toxic Spikes Drapion helps it by spreading status, but note that Sableye would then not be able to burn Pokemon like Mamoswine when they are already poisoned. Wallbreakers such as Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Grimmsnarl are also good teammates for Sableye, being able to clean more easily with Sableye preventing hazards being set and wearing down the enemy team. Bisharp and Drapion also help in the Fairy matchup, which is a matchup problematic for Dark. Grimmsnarl also helps Sableye versus other Dark teams due to Dark-type's immunity to Prankster.</p> "

This, along with reliable recovery in Recover, makes it hard to beat for many teams alike. Generally, Taunt should be used to block setup, recovery, entry hazards, and status, and should be used in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off to break down many different Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Corviknight, and more. Be aware that Prankster Will-O-Wisp is especially useful for crippling faster offensive threats that Ghost teams hate dealing with such as Excadrill, Barraskewda, and Dracozolt. Maximum HP and Special Defense investment ensures Sableye is as specially bulky as possible, and it can cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp just fine.</p> <p>The entire Ghost team appreciates Sableye's ability to block entry hazard setters from setting entry hazards using Taunt, seeing as Ghost teams typically do not carry entry hazard control. Galarian Corsola aids Sableye defensively, as it is also able to cripple Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp and take on more threatening wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Diggersby and Excadrill more comfortably with its sturdy bulk. Offensive Ghost-type Pokemon like Gengar, Polteageist, Mimikyu, Dragapult, and Aegislash appreciate Sableye's ability to stallbreak and soften up the opposition, making it easier for them to sweep.</p> "

It provides immense utility due to it having both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, the latter of which especially benefits its Fire-type teammates. Yawn deters setup sweepers such as Dragonite while also forcing out Water-types like Urshifu-R, which can let Torkoal get off a crucial last-second Rapid Spin.

It is especially effective against the former, notably beating Toxapex if it is carrying Psychic. Mixed-attacking Victini helps against Ground and Dragon teams, with Glaciate + Energy Ball making it very uncomfortable to switch into. Also, Choice Band Victini's V-create becomes a nuke under sun, 2HKOing Mantine. Choice Scarf Blacephalon provides a fast attacker that also takes advantage of sun. Volcanion provides a Water immunity and a temporary Ground immunity with Air Balloon, which is very useful against Water and Ground teams. Heatran is a great partner for Torkoal, as Heatran can fit Flash Cannon to threaten Fairy and Rock teams because Torkoal sets Stealth Rock instead. Furthermore, Toxapex becomes easier to trap, as it does less damage under sun. Moltres provides a more reliable Ground immunity than Air Balloon Volcanion while also providing Defog support and pivoting with U-turn. Incineroar switches into special attackers better under sun, which weakens Water-type attacks from threats such as Volcanion, Toxapex, and Rotom-W.

Crabhammer is the strongest Water-type STAB move backed by Adaptability, cleanly OHKOing the likes of physically defensive Hippowdon and 2HKOing physically defensive Mandibuzz and defensive Corviknight. Aqua Jet makes up for Crawdaunt's low Speed and additionally allows it to pick off weakened or frail Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu, Gardevoir, Galarian Darmanitan, and Zeraora. Close Combat serves as a stronger means of hitting Ferrothorn as well as threatens Normal teams, as no Normal-type can switch into it. Alternatively, Crunch allows Crawdaunt to maintain the 2HKO on an itemless Toxapex. Crawdaunt should be brought into the battle to wallbreak with pivoting moves such as U-turn or through double switches, as it cannot switch into attacks due to its lackluster bulk.

Draco Meteor is its strongest move and OHKOes Pokemon such as Thundurus-T and Hydreigon while heavily damaging Slowbro and Zarude -- but be aware that Choice Scarf Zarude forces Latios out. Psyshock is used over Psychic to hit foes such as Swampert, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey harder than Psychic would. Mystical Fire is a great coverage option to dismantle Steel-types, notably OHKOing Ferrothorn and 2HKOing Celesteela after a Calm Mind boost. In tandem with Levitate, Mystical Fire also allows Latios to threaten non-Mold Breaker Excadrill. With Soul Dew, Latios gains the extra power it needs after a boost to 2HKO bulky Pokemon with Psyshock, such as Gastrodon.</p> <p>Victini helps dismantle threats Latios can't handle, such as Aegislash and Galarian Moltres, while also being able to debilitate Heatran with Trick. It also pivots Latios in against bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro and Toxapex, which Latios breaks through easily. Galarian Slowking can take on Heatran by itself with Earthquake and switch into special attackers such as Choice Specs Kingdra and Tapu Koko. Slowbro can switch into physical attackers Latios is forced out by, such as Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, Barraskewda, and Mamoswine. Jirachi is useful for Psychic, as the chip damage it provides via Stealth Rock can help Latios break through bulky Pokemon more easily; it also switches into Fairy-types that force out Latios such as Tapu Lele and Clefable. If running Choice Scarf, Jirachi can also deal with Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and provide Healing Wish utility. Hatterene helps combat Dark-types such as Rest Galarian Moltres, and it provides Trick Room to help defeat faster Dark-types such as Choice Scarf Zarude and Weavile. Hatterene deters entry hazards thanks to Magic Bounce. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele helps deal with threats like Bisharp, Weavile, and Dragapult, while Choice Specs Tapu Lele can help defeat Tyranitar, which Latios can't break through on its own. Mew can shut down bulkier Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Landorus-T with Will-O-Wisp in tandem with Taunt and Knock Off, which Latios heavily appreciates, while also setting Spikes or Stealth Rock. Indeedee is a niche teammate that provides a Ghost immunity, notably checking Spectrier, while providing Healing Wish utility; however, it is worth nothing that other Ghost-types have coverage for it.</p> "

It also has a good Speed tier, which allows it to outspeed and OHKO threats such as Urshifu-R, Nidoking, and Hydreigon. Furthermore, its decent bulk and neutrality to Fighting allow it to take a hit in a pinch and be a good answer to Tapu Lele. However, its Special Attack is quite lackluster, as Jirachi fails to OHKO bulky Pokemon such as Kyurem, Hippowdon, and Toxapex even with Choice Specs. Because of this, Jirachi needs support from wallbreakers like Bisharp and Melmetal to remove specially defensive Pokemon, such as Galarian Slowking, and Pokemon that resist its attacks like Heatran.</p> ",

This strategy pairs well with Thunder Wave, which slows foes for Jirachi to flinch through and increases the chance they can't move, as well as punishing switch-ins such as Victini, Volcarona, and Celesteela. U-turn lets Jirachi escape threats like Landorus-T, Aegislash, and Magnezone, which take advantage of it, or Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Heatran, which Jirachi can't win against.

There is no set Speed for Jirachi; 96 Speed EVs outspeed Adamant Mamoswine and Modest Togekiss, but 32 Speed EVs are still enough to outspeed and threaten Jolly Dragon Dance Tyranitar.</p> <p>Slowbro is an excellent partner for Jirachi, as it checks Ground- and Fire-types such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Cinderace and also pivots Jirachi in against Fairy- and Ice-types such as Tapu Bulu and Kyurem with Teleport. Also, if Jirachi utilizes a Kasib Berry, Slowbro is free to use a Colbur Berry, letting it check Dark-types such as Bisharp and Weavile too. Victini loves Jirachi luring in Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Magnezone, takes advantage of Jirachi chipping and slowing teams with Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave, and works with Jirachi to pressure types such as Ice and Fairy. Choice Specs Tapu Lele appreciates Jirachi spreading paralysis, which allows it to outspeed and steamroll types such as Water and Fairy. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele deals with Dragon- and Dark-types such as Dragpult, Hydreigon, and non-Choice Scarf Zarude, aside from setting Psychic Terrain to neutralize Sucker Punch users like Cinderace and Bisharp. Galarian Slowking shares Jirachi's duties in dealing with special attackers, with Galarian Slowking walling Kingdra, Heatran, and Volcanion and Jirachi dealing with Psychic-types such as Tapu Lele and Hatterene.

While Tapu Lele is generally the better Choice Scarf user when it comes to late-game cleaning and revenge killing, Choice Scarf Jirachi is still a decent pick, as it notably eases matchups like Fairy and Ice while providing tremendous utility and pivoting. Iron Head with Serene Grace lets Jirachi potentially luck through threats such as Hydreigon and non-Choice Scarf Dragapult, and it deals with Ice- and Fairy-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Tapu Lele. U-turn lets it pivot against switch-ins such as Heatran, Slowbro, and Corviknight. Trick debilitates walls such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela, which in turn creates setup opportunities for its teammates, especially in matchups like Poison and Steel. Healing Wish lets Jirachi support a teammate in case Jirachi has been chipped down too much or is unneeded in the matchup, such as against Steel, Water, and Fire.

In return, it wears down opposing teams due to its near-unwallable coverage. Calm Mind Latios appreciates being brought in against passive defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro and Corviknight and loves Healing Wish, which gives it another chance to wallbreak. In return, Latios provides a Ground immunity, breaks down types such as Poison and Flying, and deals with troublesome foes such as Choice Band Urshifu-R, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Victini deals with all Steel-types that wall Jirachi except for Heatran, and it appreciates Healing Wish support to threaten Steel and Grass teams a second time. Slowbro can switch into strong physical attackers such as Barraskewda, Excadrill, and Garchomp, which threaten Jirachi. Hatterene may be considered over Tapu Lele, as Jirachi provides revenge killing and cleaning; Hatterene deals with fast Dark-type threats, such as Zarude and Galarian Moltres, while also pressuring types such as Electric and Water. Defensive setup sweepers such as Agility + Calm Mind Latias and Cosmic Power Mew are also great teammates, as they help in matchups such as Electric, Ground, and Flying, and they also appreciate Jirachi's Healing Wish support.</p> "

Alternatively, Corviknight can be used over Skarmory, as it allows Jirachi to come in safely with a slow U-turn while also checking Fighting-types with Brave Bird. Celesteela can also be the Ground-immune partner, as it can threaten Steel-types that wall Jirachi such as Ferrothorn with Flamethrower.

This is very beneficial for its teammates, as Gastrodon can prevent Water-type moves from being spammed and force the opponent to play around it. Its access to Recover also gives it a huge edge over Seismitoad, since it can consistently wall the aforementioned threats without being too affected by chip damage. A neutrality to Ice allows Gastrodon to repeatedly take hits from threats to Ground teams such as Weavile, Galarian Darmanitan, and Mamoswine as well. Storm Drain's Special Attack boost can also help make Gastrodon less passive, allowing it to fire off powerful Scalds. However, replacing Seismitoad means that Gastrodon can be taken advantage of by a huge threat in Azumarill, which is able to OHKO it with Knock Off after a Belly Drum boost, proceeding to possibly sweep the rest of the entire team. Gastrodon is typically passive and can be almost completely useless against foes like Substitute Hydreigon, Substitute Kyurem, Tapu Bulu, and Zarude.

Toxic is able to cripple many switch-ins and foes that Gastrodon wouldn't be able to deal with otherwise such as Latios, Latias, Rotom-W, and Mantine. Recover is mandatory to heal off damage from threats like Barraskewda, Keldeo, and Kingdra, letting it consistently check them.

Keldeo helps against Normal-, Ice-, and Steel-types such as Blissey, Kyurem, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn that wall Gastrodon with Secret Sword. Primarina helps with Dark-, Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Keldeo thanks to its Fairy-type STAB moves, as well as beating passive defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Toxic Aegislash with Substitute and Calm Mind.

Levitate provides Bronzong with a Ground immunity and lets it take on foes such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Dragonite. A Colbur Berry can be used over Leftovers, letting Bronzong absorb a hit from threats like Bisharp and Weavile and punish them in return. However, forgoing Leftovers lessens oits longevity.</p> <p>All of Bronzong's teammates appreciate it setting Stealth Rock, but it lets Victini in particular net KOes more easily. Bronzong can also switch in on Ground-type moves like Garchomp's Earthquake for it. Victini in return can threaten Steel-types that Bronzong struggles with, like Celesteela or Aegislash. Other offensive Pokemon like Latios and Tapu Lele greatly appreciate Stealth Rock. Tapu Lele can beat troublesome Dark-types like Crawdaunt and Hydreigon. Latios's STAB Draco Meteor and Psyshock let it tear apart cores of Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Drapion on Poison as well as Pelipper, Toxapex, and Swampert on Water. Galarian Slowking forms a good defensive core with Bronzong, soaking up special attacks from the likes of Tapu Koko, Aegislash, and Heatran. Slowbro also works well defensively with Bronzong. Slowbro's Water typing lets it switch into Water- and Fire-types moves from Pokemon like Barraskewda and Victini. Bronzong can then beat Pokemon like Tapu Bulu or Kyurem for Slowbro. Mew makes up for Bronzong's passivity, as it can break through defensive cores on types like Steel, Water, and Flying with the combination of Taunt + Knock Off. Calm Mind Hatterene appreciates Bronzong weakening opposing Pokemon with Stealth Rock and Toxic, giving it an easier time late-game. Nasty Plot Celebi can beat Water- and Ground-types that Bronzong is unable to dent. Bronzong helps Celebi by switching in on Poison- and Flying-type moves from Pokemon like Nihilego and Zapdos.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Garchomp is a powerful wallbreaker and setup sweeper thanks to Swords Dance and Scale Shot. Swords Dance allows Garchomp to destroy defensive teams, while Scale Shot allows it to gain Speed and clean through more offensive teams. It can easily set up with Swords Dance thanks to its good natural bulk. Garchomp's Speed tier allows it to excel as a cleaner and wallbreaker, taking on threats such as Urshifu-R, Kyurem, Mimikyu, Mew, and Tapu Fini. Its Dragon typing helps it tank Water- and Grass-type attacks from threats such as Rillaboom and Urshifu-R, which potentially allows Garchomp to stop a sweep. While its Speed tier and Dragon typing offer a lot, they still leave Garchomp vulnerable to common threats such as Weavile, Zarude, and Latios and compound a Ground team's natural weakness to Ice-type attacks.</p> <h1>Dragon</h1> <p>Garchomp's well rounded stat distribution, STAB coverage, and access to Stealth Rock play a pivotal role on Dragon teams and their naturally aggressive playstyle. Its Ground typing is very much appreciated against Steel- and Poison-types such as <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/aegislash/monotype/\">Aegislash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/melmetal/monotype/\">Melmetal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/nidoking/monotype/\">Nidoking</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/toxapex/monotype/\">Toxapex</a> while also preventing Volt Switch pivoting from Electric-types in <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/rotom-wash/monotype/\">Rotom-W</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/zapdos/monotype/\">Zapdos</a>.

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance allows Garchomp to become a dangerous wallbreaker by letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Tapu Fini with Earthquake and Kyurem with Scale Shot and beating walls such as Amoonguss and Celesteela with more ease. Scale Shot boosts Garchomp's Speed, allowing it to revenge kill faster threats such as Tapu Koko, but it drops Garchomp's Defense and makes it vulnerable to priority attacks such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Stone Edge targets Flying-types such as Zapdos, Galarian Moltres, Mantine, and Mandibuzz. Fire Fang hits Grass- and Steel-types such as Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela; the latter two are not phased by Garchomp's other attacks. Life Orb allows Garchomp to be a stronger wallbreaker and gives it crucial rolls such as OHKOing bulky Tapu Fini with Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake. Alternatively, Lum Berry can be used to give Garchomp a safer chance to set up against status users such as Blissey, Amoonguss, and Toxapex. Rough Skin allows Garchomp to better handle physical threats such as Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Hippowdon provides residual damage chip on foes such as Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu with Stealth Rock and sand and makes it easier for Garchomp to break through them. Excadrill benefits from Hippowdon's sand thanks to Sand Rush and can aid Garchomp by revenge killing Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and clearing entry hazards. Garchomp and Excadrill also benefit from each other breaking down shared checks such as Slowbro and Mandibuzz, allowing the other an easier time sweeping. Gastrodon and Seismitoad offer Garchomp a Water immunity. Gastrodon is the more sustainable option, as it provides a more consistent switch-in to threats such as Barraskewda due to it having reliable recovery, while Seismitoad can deal with threats like Belly Drum Azumarill. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can revenge kill threats such as Dragapult and Tapu Koko, while Gravity Landorus-T allows both itself and Garchomp to check Celesteela, Skarmory, and Corviknight without relying on Fire Fang. Mamoswine takes on Flying-, Dragon-, and Grass-types such as Landorus-T, Latios, and Amoonguss with its powerful Ice-type attacks while also being able to revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragapult for Garchomp. Additionally, Mamoswine can remove items such as Slowbro's Heavy-Duty Boots and Tapu Lele's Choice Scarf, opening up avenues Garchomp to beat them. Nidoking can help Garchomp take on the Steel and Flying matchups, hitting all Steel-types with Earth Power + Flamethrower and all Flying-types with BoltBeam coverage, and take pressure off it. Nidoking can break through Pokemon such as Celesteela, Corviknight, and Skarmory for Garchomp; in return, Garchomp can break past special walls such as Blissey. Choice Scarf Krookodile helps in the Ghost and Psychic matchups, allowing Garchomp to become more threatening by removing faster threats such as Spectrier, Dragapult, Latias, and Alakazam.</p> "

Latias is an ideal teammate for it given its affinity to remove entry hazards for Dragon team while also providing Healing Wish support to restore its health and status if need be. <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/kyurem/monotype/\">Kyurem</a> is useful to Pressure stall many defensive and utility-based foes such as <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/blissey/monotype/\">Blissey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/mew/monotype/\">Mew</a> while also utilizing Freeze-Dry to counteract difficult Water-types in <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/gastrodon/monotype/\">Gastrodon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/pokemon/tapu-fini/monotype/\">Tapu Fini</a>.</p> "

Dark Pulse is an option that allows Lucario to take on Aegislash, which can otherwise use Lucario as setup fodder. Life Orb allows Lucario to increase its damage output. Its EV spread and a Modest nature allow it to hit as fast and hard as possible. Lucario prefers to run a Modest nature to boost the power of its Vacuum Wave. Lucario should set up on Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Sableye that will try to cripple it with Foul Play and Will-O-Wisp, respectively.

Terrakion is a great Choice Scarf user due to it outpacing Choice Scarf Excadrill and Gardevoir and being able to take on Fire-types like Charizard and Chandelure. Keldeo is also very helpful for Lucario due to it taking down Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon like Hippowdon, Excadrill, and Charizard while also stopping Toxapex using Recover, Haze or Toxic Spikes thanks to Taunt. Scrafty is needed, as it provides a useful Psychic immunity to the team, uses its ability Shed Skin to soak status for its teammates, which helps Lucario with not being burned, and takes on Ghost-type Pokemon such as Aegislash and Sableye for the team.

Toxapex is a general wall that deals with threats such as Cinderace and Mimikyu, and it can provide Toxic Spikes, which makes Whirlwind less passive if Drapion lacks Toxic Spikes itself. Crobat and Galarian Weezing are partners immune to Ground that remove entry hazards, with the former able to cripple Substitute users like Kyurem, Hydreigon, and Bulk Up Landorus-T with Toxic, and the latter threatening Dragon- and Dark-types such as Dragonite, Hydreigon, and Galarian Moltres. Nidoking provides an immunity to Electric, checks threats like Regieleki and Tapu Koko, pressures Steel- and Flying-types such as Heatran, Corviknight, and Mantine, and optionally sets Stealth Rock to wear down opposing teams. Nihilego can switch into and pressure Hydreigon and Galarian Moltres in a pinch, appreciates Drapion wearing down its checks in Celesteela and Slowking, and can clean Flying and Fire teams late-game with a Meteor Beam or Choice Scarf set.</p> "

Toxic Spikes also allows offensive teammates such as Hydreigon and Grimmsnarl to break opposing teams more consistently. Furthermore, Drapion's part-Poison typing absorbs the opposing Toxic Spikes. Toxic should be used in cases where the opposing team has no Pokemon immune to it, such as Fairy-types, and against fast threats and setup sweepers to limit their effectiveness, and Toxic Spikes should be used against types that lack proper entry hazard removal such as Grass.</p> <p>With its part-Poison typing and acceptable offensive stats, Drapion can handle most Fairy-type Pokemon, thus making it a good teammate to most Dark-type Pokemon. Offensive Pokemon such as Bisharp and Hydreigon make good teammates to Drapion, as they benefit well from Toxic Spikes, which allows the aforementioned Pokemon to break opposing teams more consistently. Furthermore, Hydreigon can switch into Ground-type attacks thanks to its Levitate, and Bisharp's part-Steel typing gives Drapion a bit of freedom with checking Fairy-types. With its access to Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave, Tyranitar performs a good hazard-stacking and status-spreading core with Drapion. Mandibuzz is another decent teammate with its capability of switching into Ground-type attacks for Drapion and forms a good core with it thanks to their neutrality to Fighting-type attacks. Having Drapion also frees Mandibuzz from having to run Toxic.</p> "

Azumarill also helps Togekiss by removing Rock-type Pokemon like Nihilego and Tyranitar with its strong Water-type attacks and specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking with Knock Off. Togekiss greatly appreciates fast pivots that can bring it in on a predicted switch. U-turn or Volt Switch Tapu Koko is especially good at this, as it invites walls such as Ferrothorn for Togekiss to take advantage of and provides a fast Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock from being set. Clefable provides Stealth Rock, which chips down Togekiss's targets and allows it to pick off defensive Pokemon more easily. Tapu Bulu handles Electric- and Rock-types like Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, and Tyranitar.

Mamoswine's typing, in combination with its ability Thick Fat, allows it to switch into Ice-type moves from Alolan Ninetales, Kyurem, Cloyster, or Arctozolt. Mamoswine, however, is fairly slow, so it must rely on Ice Shard to deal with faster foes. Its typing is horrible defensively, and its bulk is only average, which reduces the number of opportunities it gets to wallbreak.

An Assault Vest set with an investment such as 4 HP / 184 Atk / 136 SpD / 184 Spe with an Adamant Nature may be considered to better check Kyurem and act as a buffer against threats such as Tapu Lele and Zapdos, but the reduced Attack hampers Mamoswine's potential to clean types such as Dragon late-game and the reduced Speed lets Tapu Bulu now outspeed and threaten Mamoswine out. A Choice Scarf set with a Jolly nature may be considered to surprise threats such as Zapdos and Kyurem, and also outspeed the entire unboosted metagame bar Regieleki.

Toxapex is a good defensive Pokemon that pairs well with Rotom-W because of its ability to absorb status from Pokemon such as Drapion and Mandibuzz, and it can pivot into stronger attacks such as Roserade's Leaf Storm and Lucario's Focus Blast for Rotom-W. It can also use Haze to prevent setup sweepers such as Hydreigon and Reuniclus from getting out of hand.</p> "

Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Seismitoad, and Gastrodon are all easily set up on by Rotom-C, and other Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Excadrill have trouble revenge killing it due to Substitute. Nasty Plot allows Rotom-C to serve as a setup sweeper by beating Pokemon such as Hatterene, Bisharp, and Excadrill after a boost, while Subsitute also allows it to set up on status users such as Seismitoad, Pokemon that are unable to deal significant damage to Rotom-C such as Toxapex, and forced switches, as well as helping against Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Thunderbolt is valuable coverage that hits Pokemon such as Corviknight and Toxapex for super effective damage, as well as Pokemon like Aegislash, Bisharp, Jirachi, Salazzle, and Galarian Weezing neutrally. Leaf Storm is Rotom-C's stronger STAB attack that hits the aforementioned Ground-type Pokemon and can beat bulkier Pokemon, such as Mew, Hatterene, and Gardevoir, with a Nasty Plot boost. Although its bulk is not the best, Rotom-C can serve as an answer to certain offensive Pokemon using its typing, such as Barraskewda and Seismitoad under rain, but shouldn't set up on other hard-hitting offensive Pokemon such as Indeedee and Dragapult that threaten to OHKO or heavily dent it.</p> <p>The entirety of Electric appreciates Rotom-C's ability to serve as a reliable answer to Ground-type Pokemon, seeing as Electric teams struggle immensely against them otherwise. In return, Sticky Web setters such as Galvantula and Vikavolt are good partners for Rotom-C, as they patch up its middling Speed and allow it to outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Specs Indeedee, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Choice Specs Gengar, and Mimikyu, paving the way for it to sweep. Choice Band Zeraora is a fantastic wallbreaker that can take on faster Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Cinderace, and Dragapult and forms an offensive core with Rotom-C. Zeraora's ability to wallbreak early-game and beat Dragon- and Steel-type Pokemon with Play Rough, Plasma Fists, and Close Combat is fantastic for Rotom-C to sweep weakened teams or vice versa. Toxtricity is another special attacker that can beat Grass-type Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Vileplume, and Roserade for Rotom-C. Alolan Raichu is a powerful wallbreaker that can outspeed and beat threats such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Choice Scarf Gengar, and Choice Scarf Excadrill for Rotom-C under Electric Terrain. Pincurchin can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes as well as use Memento to weaken the opponent and bring Rotom-C in for it to set up and sweep. Morpeko is amazing against Psychic and Ghost teams and can bring Rotom-C in with Parting Shot while the stat drops help it set up. Morpeko can also break screens, which limit Rotom-C’s sweeping potential, with Psychic Fangs.</p> "

Use Substitute on passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex to avoid status and set up with Nasty Plot. Thunderbolt makes Rotom-C able to take on Flying-types such as Corviknight and Mandibuzz. Dark Pulse is used for neutral damage and greatly helping with Ferrothorn, Seismitoad, and Excadrill and Ghost- and Psychic-types like Aegislash and Celebi.

Rotom-C loves entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Roserade to sweep more easily mid- to late-game and in particular likes Ferrothorn thanks to its Steel typing allowing it to come in on Ice-type attacks. Appletun forms a good defensive core with Ferrothorn because its Dragon typing and Thick Fat makes it able to come in on Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult and Charizard. Virizion makes a great partner due to its ability to take on Charizard and Centiskorch with Stone Edge, OHKO Alolan Ninetales with Smart Strike and Steel-type Pokemon like Excadrill. Leech Seed users such as Ferrothorn, Appletun, and Whimsicott are good partners for Rotom-C, as they wear down opposing Pokemon for it while helping it set up by providing it with more passive recovery. Whimsicott can be used for its Substitute + Leech Seed to chip Pokemon down and make it easier for Rotom-C to clean up. Whimsicott's Fairy typing and access to Moonblast also help greatly in the Dragon- and the Dark-type matchup with pressuring and taking care of Hydreigon and Grimmsnarl. Whimsicott can also use Heat Rock and Sunny Day to make Venusaur and Celebi turn into dangerous sweepers that greatly help in the Steel-type matchup, taking care of Pokemon that Rotom-C has trouble with such as Duraludon with Growth-boosted Weather Ball or Nasty Plot-boosted Earth Power .</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Steel</h1> <p>Heatran is a key Pokemon for Steel teams thanks to Flash Fire's ability to absorb Fire-type attacks such as V-create from Victini. Heatran has excellent typing with decent defensive stats, which contributes to its good special bulk. Heatran also has access to a variety of utility options; Toxic and Lava Plume allow it to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Mantine, Galarian Corsola, and Rotom-W, Taunt allows it to block utility moves like Leech Seed, Stealth Rock, and Recover from slower Pokemon such as Celesteela, Galarian Corsola, and Toxapex, and Stealth Rock lets Ferrothorn dedicate its slot to Spikes. However, Heatran's Fire typing compounds Steel teams' natural weaknesses; it stacks the Ground-type weakness for its team against foes like Garchomp and creates a weakness against Water-types such as Barraskewda. Heatran also has mediocre Speed and is forced to switch out against fast physical threats such as Urshifu-R, Barraskewda, Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Heatran lacks proper recovery and is reliant on Leftovers, which directly affects its longevity during the battle as it doesn't like taking hits from other Pokemon.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Lava Plume is Heatran's most spammable STAB attack that comes with a 30% chance to burn the foe, which can be used to cripple Toxapex. Earth Power is used mainly for opposing Heatran and hits Toxapex as well as Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu and Tapu Koko. Toxic cripples foes that Heatran cannot reliably beat, like Mantine, Slowbro, and Porygon2. Heatran's excellent typing and natural bulk make it one of the best Stealth Rock setters, as it forces a lot of switches. However, Taunt allows it to be an effective stallbreaker if another teammate is carrying Stealth Rock. A specially defensive spread with a Calm nature gives Heatran a better matchup against foes such as Tornadus-T and Latios. Leftovers mitigates Heatran's lack of natural recovery. Flash Fire is the preferred ability, as it allows Heatran to absorb Fire-type attacks.</p> <p>Heatran's presence is appreciated by every Steel-type, as it is the only reliable answer to Fire-types such as Victini. Ferrothorn is one of Heatran's best teammates; Heatran can take Fire-type attacks for Ferrothorn, while Ferrothorn can take Water-type attacks for it and threaten Water-types with Power Whip. In addition, Ferrothorn's Spikes synergizes with Lava Plume and Toxic to accrue chip damage on foes, while Taunt from Heatran prevents Defog from foes like Mantine and maintains Spikes. Celesteela, Skarmory, and Corviknight all make good partners for Heatran, as their typing allows them to switch into Ground-type coverage directed at Heatran. Moreover, Celesteela heals Heatran with Leech Seed and helps against checks such as Swampert, Skarmory provides Spikes and Whirlwind for passive damage while Heatran deters Defog with Taunt, and Corviknight's Pressure allows the duo to make better progress against bulky teams. Excadrill removes entry hazards that harm Heatran, as it already has limited recovery. Moreover, Excadrill can absorb Electric-type attacks for Heatran from foes like Choice Specs Tapu Koko, check opposing Heatran, and, with a Choice Scarf set, clean weakened teams. Aegislash takes care of Fighting-type coverage such as Focus Blast from Tapu Lele and Alakazam. Moreover, Toxic + Substitute Aegislash contributes to Heatran's stallbreaking. Bisharp helps Heatran stallbreak with Knock Off, removing crucial items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Mantine and Pelipper and Eviolite from Porygon2 and Galarian Corsola. Bisharp also contributes to Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups effectively by threatening faster Pokemon such as Victini, Latios, Gengar, and Dragapult with Sucker Punch and getting free Knock Offs against slower Pokemon such as Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, and Galarian Corsola. Assault Vest Melmetal can take a few hits from specially offensive Pokemon that threaten Heatran, such as Tapu Lele. Calm Mind Jirachi can take advantage of Pokemon that Heatran cannot reliably beat, such as Toxapex and Mantine, while also taking on Dragon-types like Kyurem and Hydreigon.</p> "

Flash Fire-boosted Eruption is hard to check, threatening even walls such as Gastrodon, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex.

It also has Rapid Spin, which allows Excadrill to clear entry hazards off the field; this gives Ground teams their only and reliable form of entry hazard removal.

Its ability, Mold Breaker, is extremely useful, as it allows Excadrill to spam Earthquake without being bothered by Levitate users like Rotom-W and Galarian Weezing. However, Excadrill is slower than most Choice Scarf users and gets forced out by those that carry super effective coverage such as Blacephalon, Tapu Lele, and Galarian Darmanitan. Furthermore, Excadrill struggles to deal with physical walls such as Slowbro and Galarian Corsola, which means that it needs support from teammates like Aegislash and Bisharp to break down certain defensive cores.</p> ",

Iron Head targets Ice- and Fairy-types such as Avalugg, Alolan Ninetales, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele. X-Scissor is used to take on Zarude and Celebi while also dealing with other Dark- and Psychic-types such as Hydreigon and Slowbro. Rock Slide targets Flying-types such as Zapdos, Galarian Moltres, and Mantine.

Maximum Speed investment allows Excadrill to outspeed threats such as Tapu Bulu, Adamant Diggersby, and Choice Specs Pelipper. An Adamant nature paired with a Choice Band allows Excadrill to OHKO threats such as Keldeo after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Slowbro with X-Scissor. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed threats such as +1 Adamant Dragapult and Choice Scarf Weavile in sand. Excadrill should be safely brought in to take advantage of the sand with methods such as Eject Button Hippowdon or by bringing it on resisted attacks such as Latias's Draco Meteor.</p> <p>All of Excadrill's teammates appreciate its ability to take on Ice-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types, clear entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and act as a revenge killer in sand against threats such as Barraskewda, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Hippowdon is a mandatory partner for Excadrill, as it sets sand and Stealth Rock, as well as being able to bring in Excadrill safely with Eject Button. Hippowdon can also take on physical threats such as Dragon Dance Dragapult, Zeraora, and Bisharp for Excadrill. Gastrodon and Seismitoad offer Excadrill an immunity to Water-type attacks such as Mantine's Scald and Barraskewda's Waterfall. Gastrodon offers a more defensive presence thanks to Recover, while Seismitoad checks Azumarill, which would otherwise beat Excadrill. Swords Dance Garchomp wears down shared checks like Celesteela with Fire Fang, takes on Mantine with Stone Edge, and can become dangerous setup sweeper with Scale Shot, which makes handling Pokemon like Spectrier much easier. Landorus-T provides a Ground immunity, allowing it to switch into Hippowdon's Earthquake; it is also a great revenge killer that can take on weakened threats such as Zeraora, Spectrier, and Urshifu-R with its Choice Scarf set. Gravity Landorus-T can threaten Pokemon such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight for Excadrill, as well as taking on Steel teams in their entirety if it carries Bulk Up and Substitute. Nidoking can beat Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela with Earth Power + Flamethrower or Flying-types such as Mantine, Pelipper, Corviknight, and Dragonite with Thunderbolt + Ice Beam. Mamoswine is a great late-game cleaner that can pick off weakened threats such as Garchomp, Dragapult, and Hydreigon with Ice Shard while also being able to remove items such as Slowking's Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off.</p> "

Substitute takes advantage of foes locked into a Water-type move such as Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Choice Band Barraskewda, as well as passive, status-reliant Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Toxapex. Power Whip deals heavy damage to Water-types, notably KOing Azumarill after it has used Belly Drum, Crawdaunt after Stealth Rock damage, and Urshifu-R after a Close Combat Defense drop.

        "description": "<p>By virtue of the stacked boosts from Choice Band and Gorilla Tactics onto its already amazing Attack stat, Galarian Darmanitan is an obscenely powerful wallbreaker. Icicle Crash is able to destroy walls that don't resist it, like Clefable, and even frailer Ice-resistant Pokemon on the switch-in, such as Crawdaunt. Fire Punch and Flare Blitz serve as coverage to nail Steel- and Ice-types that resist Icicle Crash; the former one is preferred, as it already OHKOes Corviknight and Ferrothorn without recoil damage. However, the latter scores KOs versus Levitate Bronzong, +1 Corviknight, Mamoswine, and Aegislash after contact with King's Shield. Earthquake nails Toxapex and Torkoal and is Galarian Darmanitan's best way to damage Snorlax. U-turn takes advantage of the number of switches Galarian Darmanitan forces, generating momentum for the team while hitting reasonably hard. A Jolly nature is vital to outrun Kommo-o and tie with other base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Indeedee.</p> <p>Because this Galarian Darmanitan forgoes the Speed boost from Choice Scarf, it becomes vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Hydreigon and Dragapult. Other Choice Scarf revenge killers that can beat them, like Weavile and Galarian Mr. Mime, are, thus, great partners. Entry hazards are also an issue for Galarian Darmanitan, since they reduce its lifespan greatly, especially if it's running Flare Blitz; therefore, Rapid Spin users such as the aforementioned Galarian Mr. Mime and Avalugg are mandatory teammates. Alolan Ninetales provides Aurora Veil support for Galarian Darmanitan, making it more useful against offensive teams by taking hits better and KOing faster, frailer enemies back. Swords Dance Weavile and Cloyster appreciate Galarian Darmanitan's capability to break walls for a late-game sweep. Froslass, Mamoswine, and Piloswine can lay down Spikes and Stealth Rock, respectively, softening defensive Pokemon like Toxapex for Galarian Darmanitan.</p> "

Calm Mind plus Iron Defense and reliable recovery make it incredibly hard to break by any team once it starts getting a few boosts. Magic Guard further boosts this combination by making it immune to entry hazards and residual damage, most notably poison, which would otherwise inhibit its entire function. Stored Power is its primary attack, which scales incredibly over time as Reuniclus gains more stat boosts. However, be wary of using Reuniclus, as with Stored Power being its only attack, it cannot do much in a battle without first having some stat boosts and is left walled by any Dark-type. It is important to take advantage of passive Pokemon that do not threaten Reuniclus at all by using it as an opportunity to set up with either Calm Mind or Iron Defense.</p> <p>As Reuniclus is completely ineffective if there is any Dark-type Pokemon on the opponent's team, it is crucial that Dark-types be eliminated before even attempting to set up with Reuniclus. Therefore, Pokemon such as Hatterene, Gardevoir, and Gallade are all crucial for their STAB Fairy- and Fighting-type attacks to take down opposing Dark-types. Pokemon with Fire-type coverage such as Indeedee also greatly benefit Reuniclus, as they can help take down Steel-types that resist Reuniclus's only attack. Indeedee also provides a Ghost-type immunity, which Reuniclus can struggle to take on before setting up.</p> "

Its Poison typing absorbs Toxic Spikes, which is useful since Grass teams lack a good entry hazard remover.

Unfortunately, Amoonguss is forced out by Pokemon carrying super effective coverage such as Hydreigon, Zapdos, and Heatran and special attackers like Nihilego, Spectrier, and Kingdra. Furthermore, Amoonguss easily becomes bait for setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres and Volcarona and hazard setters like Klefki and Mew after it has used Spore on a foe already.

Galarian Weezing can switch into powerful Dragon-type attacks for Amoonguss, such as Hydreigon's Draco Meteor. Galarian Weezing also switches into Ground-type attacks that Amoonguss cannot, such as Choice Band Diggersby's Earthquake, as well as cripple physical attackers such as Terrakion with Will-O-Wisp. Skuntank provides a switch-in to Psychic-type attacks and can check dangerous threats to Amoonguss with Sucker Punch, such as Alolan Raichu and Dragapult.

Gengar can, in return, cripple walls for Amoonguss like Toxapex by using Trick, making them near deadweight. Salazzle keeps faster foes in check and can check Pokemon such as Excadrill with Flamethrower, taking the burden off Amoonguss to switch into its Earthquake. Salazzle can also significantly improve the Poison- and Steel-type matchup by crippling foes such as Corviknight and Toxapex with Toxic thanks to its ability Corrosion. Scolipede is a powerful setup sweeper that can break through walls such as Chansey with Megahorn and threaten Psychic teams very effectively thanks to Speed Boost and its ability to OHKO or 2HKO all Psychic-type Pokemon. While not incredibly viable, Toxtricity can take on Flying-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Mantine, and Mandibuzz with Overdrive, which otherwise wall Amoonguss.</p> "

Choice Scarf Excadrill benefits from Bisharp's ability to weaken or outright remove bulky Pokemon, such as Slowbro and Toxapex, as this allows Excadrill to clean types such as Dragon, Psychic, and Poison late-game. Choice Specs Jirachi deals with Fighting-types such as Kommo-o and Urshifu-R, and it is fast enough to threaten Nidoking and Hydreigon for Bisharp.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Braviary's great Attack stat, above-average Speed tier with a Choice Scarf, and access to high-Base Power moves in Brave Bird and Close Combat make it a powerful revenge killer for Normal teams. It can also serve as a late-game cleaner once its checks are severely weakened or fainted. Brave Bird is Braviary's main STAB attack, denting most non-resistant targets and picking off slower, weakened threats such as Mimikyu and Barraskewda outside of rain. Close Combat complements Brave Bird, as it hits Steel- and Rock-types like Bisharp and Tyranitar that resist its STAB attacks; however, it should be used cautiously, since it is much weaker without a STAB boost and can turn Braviary into setup fodder for the likes of Corviknight and Aegislash. A fast Defog provides Normal teams with a form of entry hazard removal, while U-turn takes advantage of forced switches to keep up momentum. Defiant is Braviary's only useful ability, allowing it to gain valuable Attack boosts by switching into the opponent's Defogger.</p> <p>Physical walls such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Mandibuzz stop Braviary in its tracks, so it appreciates having powerful wallbreakers like Choice Band Diggersby and Choice Specs Indeedee as teammates. Diggersby in particular can also use sets with Spikes, which pressures the opponent into using Defog and giving Braviary a Defiant boost. In return, Braviary takes out faster threats like Dragapult and blows away entry hazards from the field. Ditto is another good partner because it forms a revenge killing duo with Braviary versus offensive teams and serves as a backup switch-in to defensive Pokemon that Braviary can't break. With its part-Electric typing, good coverage, and Dry Skin, Heliolisk can pressure Steel-, Ground-, and Water-type teams for Braviary, enabling it to be more effective in said matchups. Lastly, Obstagoon and Snorlax synergize well with Braviary by absorbing much-hated status and dealing with some of its checks, namely Aegislash, Galarian Corsola, and Corviknight.</p> "

Its Flying typing gives Normal teams an incredibly valuable Ground-type immunity and Fighting-type neutrality, and it gives Braviary a powerful STAB Brave Bird to hit opposing Fighting-types super effectively. Roost allows Braviary to effectively wall offensive foes like Rillaboom and Heracross while keeping itself healthy to keep taking hits for its teammates. Defog most notably removes Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web that would heavily cripple the offensive capabilities of Braviary's teammates. This works well with U-turn, allowing Braviary to create immediate offensive presence by pivoting in threatening teammates. Maximum HP investment and 240 Defense EVs allow Braviary to take physical hits like Excadrill's Iron Head, Cinderace's High Jump Kick, and Mimikyu's unboosted Play Rough. 16 EVs in Speed allows Braviary to outrun Belly Drum Azumarill and do major damage to it with Brave Bird, since it survives an Aqua Jet. Its spread paired with Heavy-Duty Boots and an Impish nature allows Braviary to be a very consistent and effective physical wall that can Defog in front of most threats.</p> <p>Braviary enables all of Normal's offensive Pokemon by pivoting them in with U-turn and removing troublesome entry hazards with Defog. Diggersby, for example, greatly appreciates Braviary's pivot support and removal of Toxic Spikes, as being poisoned can make it hard for Diggersby to stay as a consistent threat throughout the match. Other examples include Heliolisk and Bewear, which pressure Water- and Dark-types like Keldeo and Bisharp more easily with hazards gone; Obstagoon and Indeedee, which terrorize the opponent far more consistently with Sticky Web and Stealth Rock gone; and Snorlax, which cherishes Braviary's ability to take Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Zeraora. In return, these offensive Pokemon remove many of the threats that would force Braviary out. Chansey particularly appreciates Braviary's ability to remove hazards, as its inability to run Heavy-Duty Boots makes it harder for it to switch into attacks when hazards are present. Braviary in turn appreciates Blissey's own pivot support and its ability to take special hits like Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and Volcarona's +1 Fire Blast or Flamethrower. Ditto is also a great teammate for Braviary, as it can check out-of-control setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Excadrill.</p> "

Foul Play punishes physical setup sweepers such as Dragapult and Dragonite, and it also deters threats such as Victini and Excadrill from staying in.

In return, Mandibuzz checks Ground-types like Excadrill and Garchomp, which helps the aforementioned Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Drapion. Another good teammate can be found in Sableye, as it not only takes pressure off of Mandibuzz as a Fighting-type switch-in, but it can deal with Iron Defense Kommo-o and Body Press Corviknight too.

Superpower lets Durant hit Steel-types such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn, while Rock Slide targets Flying- and Fire-types such as Mandibuzz and Centiskorch, preventing these Pokemon from reliably switching in and checking Durant.

Durant should try to inflict as much damage as possible once switched in, using First Impression to hit faster threats for high damage and using Superpower or Rock Slide to deal with potential defensive switch-ins, such as Lucario and Charizard. Durant's ability to dispose of fast threats is greatly appreciated by defensive teammates such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Ferrothorn's Grass typing and access to Leech Seed allow it to check Water-types such as Seismitoad and Gyarados that Durant can struggle with and it can also use Stealth Rock or Spikes to weaken Pokemon such as Dracovish so that Durant can KO them with First Impression.

Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Galarian Corsola, Slowbro, and Porygon-2. U-turn allows Landorus-T to preserve momentum, escaping common unfavorable switch-ins such as Amoonguss, Zarude, and Galarian Weezing.</p> <p>Mamoswine checks Ice-types that threaten Landorus-T, like Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales. Gastrodon absorbs Water-type moves from Urshifu-R and Barraskewda. Excadrill can remove Stealth Rock for Landorus-T with Rapid Spin and takes on threats like Tapu Bulu, Zarude, and Keldeo under sand. It can partially deal with Ice-types because of its Steel typing, and it resists Dragon- and Psychic-type attacks. Nidoking can break through physical walls such as Skarmory, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, which are hard to remove with Landorus-T. Garchomp can provide exceptional wallbreaking with its Swords Dance sets against Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Celesteela.</p> "

As a stallbreaker, Keldeo punishes walls like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and defensive Seismitoad by stopping their dangerous passive moves like Toxic, Haze, Recover, and entry hazards with Taunt. With Calm Mind, it can set up to beat these walls while also letting Keldeo KO Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Corviknight. These boosts with Calm Mind also allow it to break Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Mew, and Aegislash with Hydro Pump. Scald can be used as an alternative to Hydro Pump due to its more reliable accuracy and chance to burn opposing Pokemon; however, the caveat to using this move is that it is significantly weaker than Hydro Pump without Calm Mind boosts. Keldeo's STAB move in Focus Blast allows it to break Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types like Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Hydreigon, Indeedee, and Snorlax that Water teams would otherwise have a tough time getting through. Keldeo runs maximum EVs in both Speed and Special Attack so that it can maximize its offensive presence and outspeed key Pokemon like Hydreigon and Indeedee. This offensive presence is supported by Leftovers, which allows Keldeo to become more threatening when it sets up and also recovers health.</p> <p>Keldeo forms a very strong offensive core with Pokemon like Primarina and Crawdaunt. Primarina appreciates Keldeo's ability to stallbreak and allows it to clean late-game with its Calm Mind set. Crawdaunt can also switch into Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Reuniclus and use its powerful Knock Off and Liquidation to break teams down. While Keldeo's ability to be an oppressive offensive threat is incredibly valuable, it still needs support from a lot of other Pokemon to achieve this goal. Defensive Pokemon in Seismitoad and Toxapex provide the team with an Electric immunity and a Grass neutrality, respectively. Seismitoad also provides Stealth Rock support while Toxapex offers support through Toxic, Toxic Spikes, spreading Scald burns, and wearing down opposing Pokemon to make it easier for Keldeo to break through them. Rotom-W is also a great partner, as it is able to switch into Flying-type attacks from the likes of Corviknight and Togekiss and can answer back with its own STAB Electric-type moves. It also provides Defog support to prevent Keldeo from being worn down by Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, and other entry hazards. Pelipper can assist Keldeo by getting rid of key Grass-type Pokemon like Vileplume and Virizion with its STAB Hurricane, as well as support Keldeo with Drizzle, bolstering the power of Keldeo's Hydro Pump. Cloyster is another teammate that helps deal with Grass-types as well as Dragon- and Flying-types for Keldeo and appreciates its ability to keep Stealth Rock and other hazards off the field with Taunt. Lastly, Araquanid is a great support Pokemon, as it can not only threaten Psychic-types like Gardevoir, but also use Sticky Web to allow Keldeo to threaten more Pokemon, namely Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Indeedee.</p> "

This along with its STAB Aura Sphere eviscerating most Normal- and Steel-types like Indeedee, Bewear, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp makes it extremely hard to switch into. Secret Sword is a good alternative to Aura Sphere if the little extra power and the ability to hit the Defense stat as opposed to the Special Defense stat is preferred, which is key in dealing with Pokemon like Snorlax. Keldeo also uses Icy Wind to hit some would-be threats on the switch such as Noivern, Vileplume, and Dragapult, and Scald to have a more reliable Water-type STAB move when needed. In order for it to maximize its offensive presence, Keldeo runs full EV investment in both Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature. This boost in Speed allows it to outspeed key Pokemon like Mimikyu, Modest Alolan Raichu, and non-Choice Scarf Jirachi naturally.</p> <p>Keldeo's offensive presence and ability to break open holes in the opposing team make it great as a partner for setup sweepers like Gyarados and Cloyster.

Crawdaunt and Primarina are offensive partners that can help out Keldeo by getting rid of annoying Psychic- and Dragon-types, respectively, while switching into their respective types. Crawdaunt in particular, while able to greatly improve the Steel matchup alongside Keldeo, also helps check Jellicent which completely walls Keldeo. Rotom-W is also a very invaluable teammate for Keldeo, as it can take Flying-type attacks from the likes of Corviknight and Togekiss and threaten them out with its own Electric-type STAB move and pivot using Volt Switch. It can also use a Substitute + Nasty Plot set that can break Pokemon like Jellicent and Toxapex, as well as provide support through Defog, which prevents Keldeo from getting worn down from hazards. Seismitoad allows Keldeo to have Stealth Rock support as well as providing it a switch-in to Electric-type attacks. Toxapex also helps take Grass-type attacks for Keldeo as a defensive pivot while using Toxic or Toxic Spikes to help wear down the opposing team. Pelipper sets rain, which gives Keldeo ludicrous amounts of power with its Hydro Pump and allows partners like Dracovish to help clean teams that were weakened by Keldeo's wallbreaking power.

STAB Shadow Ball is great, since only two types resist or are immune to it, making it very difficult to switch into, and it's able to 2HKO bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Flash Cannon is Aegislash's secondary STAB attack and is primarily used against Pokemon weak to Steel or against Pokemon that resist or are immune to Shadow Ball such as Indeedee and Grimmsnarl. Steel Beam is Aegislash's most powerful attack at the cost of cutting half of its HP, which is why it should only be used when Aegislash needs to OHKO a threat such as omni-boosted Kommo-o or Mandibuzz. Aegislash has high Attack despite having a Modest nature, which allows it to effectively run Shadow Sneak so it can revenge kill weakened threats such as Keldeo, Chandelure, and Alolan Raichu. Stance Change is part of the reason why Aegislash is such a great wallbreaker, because it can take a hit before changing to Blade forme and use a powerful attack. Maximum investment in HP allows Aegislash to take attacks such as Choice Specs Shadow Ball from Dragapult in Shield forme due to its amazing bulk. Alternatively, maximum Speed can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Crawdaunt and Corviknight. Aegislash should be used to wallbreak early- to mid-game and clear the way for its teammates to win.</p> <p>Corviknight is a great partner, as it covers Aegislash's Ground weakness and makes a great pivot to attacks that threaten Aegislash such as Indeedee's Mystical Fire and Gengar's Shadow Ball. Ferrothorn gets up entry hazards to weaken the opposing team and put them in range of Aegislash's attacks. It also works well with Aegislash in dealing with Choice Specs Keldeo, as Ferrothorn resists Water-type attacks and can scout with Protect, while Aegislash is immune to Fighting-type attacks.

It can use Substitute on Pokemon that can't break through it, such as Jirachi and Celebi, and use Shadow Ball to deal damage or Toxic on a predicted switch. Toxic works well with King's Shield and Substitute to stall out the opposing Pokemon. King's Shield is also incredibly useful for scouting Choice item users such as Keldeo and Zeraora, switching to Shield forme so Aegislash can take attacks such as Shadow Ball from opposing Choice Specs Dragapult and Aegislash and OHKO them, as well as regain health with Leftovers and stall out weather. Shadow Ball threatens some common Toxic switch-ins such as Jirachi, Hatterene, and Celebi and does decent damage to Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Full investment in HP and Special Defense is used to maximize Aegislash's special bulk and allow it to take attacks such as Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump from Pelipper and unboosted Weather Ball from Venusaur in sun.</p> <p>Corviknight and Ferrothorn form a great defensive core with Aegislash, as they're able to cover a lot of each other's weaknesses. Aegislash can check Pokemon that threaten the other two, such as Dragapult and Choice Specs Aegislash, and provides a valuable Fighting immunity. Corviknight is able to switch in on Ground-type attacks that threaten Aegislash and check Fighting-types that annoy Ferrothorn with Brave Bird. Ferrothorn switches in on strong Water-type attacks that the other two can't take very well such as Choice Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump, which Ferrothorn and Aegislash are able to beat thanks to their shared ability to scout its move with Protect or King's Shield. Ferrothorn also provides Leech Seed support for additional recovery and sets up entry hazards. Choice Scarf Duraludon is a good partner because it's able to revenge kill Hydreigon and is great against Dragon-type teams. Choice Scarf Excadrill is another great revenge killer and deals with threats such as Chandelure and Zeraora. Jirachi is capable of handling Keldeo thanks to its STAB Psychic, breaking Corviknight and Toxapex with the combination of Calm Mind, Psychic, and Thunderbolt, and supporting Aegislash with Healing Wish. Bisharp is a strong wallbreaker and is especially good against Psychic- and Ghost-type teams together with Aegislash.</p> "

Shadow Claw is Aegislash's main STAB move and serves to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types. Shadow Sneak serves as a STAB priority move that helps to cover its horrendous Speed stat and revenge kill weakened foes. Close Combat is used in order to hit Steel-, Rock-, and Normal-types such as Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Indeedee. Weakness Policy takes advantage of Aegislash's ability to take powerful hits and boost its Attack to help it sweep more easily.

Other late-game sweepers such as Choice Scarf Excadrill are also good partners for Aegislash, being able to clean remaining Pokemon after an Aegislash sweep. Aegislash fails to defeat Dark-type Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, so having a teammate that can take advantage of them like Bulk Up Corviknight is nice, too.</p> "

Stone Edge combats Pokemon like Mantine, Kyurem, and Volcanion, which are either immune or resistant to Liquidation and don't mind Grass Knot.

Its Poison typing also allows Dragalge to take Fairy-type attacks from foes like Tapu Fini and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and remove opposing Toxic Spikes. With its typing and immense Special Defense, Dragalge can blanket check special attackers such as Tapu Koko, Nihilego, and Galarian Moltres, although Choice Specs Aegislash, for example, can 2HKO it. Adaptability-boosted Gunk Shot deals solid overall damage, nails the aforementioned Fairy-types, and threatens Calm Mind users such as Clefable and Hatterene because it's physical. Dragalge's low Speed lets it put Flip Turn to excellent use, bringing in teammates such as Kyurem and Hydreigon safely against Pokemon it underspeeds, such as Toxapex, that like to spread status. Protect scouts Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele, Jirachi, and Gengar, while providing an extra turn of Black Sludge recovery and Toxic Spikes damage. 24 Speed IVs along with a Sassy nature allow Dragalge to underspeed Toxapex, thus sponging its status-inflicting moves such as Scald and Toxic before pivoting with Flip Turn, while outspeeding Hatterene outside of Trick Room to 2HKO it.</p> <p>Substitute users such as Kyurem and Hydreigon appreciate Toxic Spikes greatly, as it continually helps them break through types like Normal, Fairy, and Ground more consistently. Furthermore, Dragalge can act as a slow pivot for the two with Flip Turn. In return, Kyurem can crush Water-types that don't fear Dragalge such as Gastrodon and Toxapex with Freeze-Dry, while Hydreigon provides a Psychic immunity, and it takes advantage of Steel- and Poison-types such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex that switch into Dragalge. Choice Scarf Dragapult is an excellent revenge killer that threatens foes like Kingdra in rain, Choice Scarf Weavile, and Dragon Dance Dragapult with its almost unresisted STAB combination. Toxic Spikes from Dragalge enables Dragapult's Hex and puts defensive checks of Dragon Dance Dragapult, such as Kasib Berry Slowbro and Hippowdon, on a timer. Furthermore, its Ghost typing lets Dragapult spinblock against foes like Excadrill and Torkoal to keep Toxic Spikes up. Garchomp also benefits from Dragalge's slow pivoting abilities, taking advantage of Pokemon such as Toxapex and Klefki, which come in on Dragalge. Garchomp can also utilize a Choice Scarf set to threaten Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Cinderace, and Zeraora. Latias provides a Ground immunity and runs Healing Wish, which lets Dragalge have a second chance in checking Tapu Lele or Tapu Fini. Duraludon is another good partner for Dragalge, as the duo forms a good defensive backbone thanks to Duraludon's good physical bulk. Thanks to its Steel typing, Duraludon can switch into Choice Scarf Jirachi's Iron Head and threaten it with Thunder Wave, and it handles Physical Fairy- and Ice-types such as Azumarill, Mimikyu, Choice Scarf Cloyster, and Weavile. Dragonite provides a Ground immunity to check Mold Breaker Excadrill, and it can either take advantage of Toxic Spikes wearing down walls with a Dragon Dance set or provide Defog support with a defensive set.</p> "

Grass Knot lets it pressure Ground-type teams and in combination with its STAB Electric-type move, it becomes a headache for Water-type teams to deal with, making such matchups relatively easier for Normal-type teams to handle.

Glare mainly allows it to spread status well due to only Electric-type Pokemon being immune to it. Thunderbolt permits it to threaten Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Toxapex, Mantine, and Corviknight. Grass Knot grants Heliolisk the ability to target Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, Mamoswine, and Rhyperior.

Substitute allows Heliolisk to take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Mantine, Toxapex, and specially defensive Aegislash. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Heliolisk to ignore entry hazards that will hinder it such as Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes. However, Leftovers can be used to passively regain health, giving it more opportunities to set up a Substitute. Dry Skin grants Heliolisk an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to switch into attacks such as Dracovish's Fishious Rend and Azumarill's Aqua Jet, which can otherwise devastate Normal teams. Maximum EVs in Special Attack and Speed ensure it is as powerful as possible and faster than Pokemon such as Keldeo. Heliolisk should try to set up a Substitute against Water teams, especially on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mantine or Pokemon Choice-locked into a Water-type attack such as Choice Scarf Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. Substitute then allows it to severely threaten Water teams. Outside of the Water and Flying matchups, Heliolisk's main job is to be spreading paralysis with Glare, which can be done more easily if it's behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Heliolisk supports its offensive teammates with Glare, allowing them to outspeed threats such as Hydreigon. Blissey is a fantastic partner, as it can switch into a plethora of attacks for it such as Rotom-H's Overheat and Indeedee's Expanding Force. In addition, Blissey can set Stealth Rock for Heliolisk, allowing it to break past Pokemon such as Keldeo and Togekiss more easily. Finally, it can also pivot with Teleport to bring in Heliolisk safely. Ditto is a great way to check faster Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Cinderace. Braviary is an important teammate when Heliolisk is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can clear hazards off the field, which is crucial for Heliolisk due to its weakness to Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web. This is especially important against Water teams. Diggersby, Bewear, and Obstagoon can break through special walls for Heliolisk such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Tyranitar. Diggersby can also take on Fire- and Poison-type Pokemon such as Torkoal, Incineroar, and Salazzle. Obstagoon can help Heliolisk in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups by taking on Pokemon such as Mew and Alolan Marowak. Bewear is the best check to threats such as Urshifu-S, as Fluffy alongside a Chople Berry can make that matchup manageable.

The HP investment allows Noivern to always avoid the OHKO from Adamant Cloyster's Ice Shard, as well as letting it switch into Choice Specs Dragapult's Thunderbolt more comfortably, while still having enough Speed to outspeed common Choice Scarf users like Gengar, Terrakion, and Charizard. Infiltrator is particularly good for ignoring Aurora Veil and screens from Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Duraludon, as well as for hitting Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Hydreigon, and Salazzle behind a Substitute, improving Noivern's revenge killing capabilities.</p> <p>Choice Specs Charizard is a great teammate for Noivern, as it can beat Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight that Noivern struggles against, as well as break walls such as Toxapex and Tyranitar. In return, Noivern can outspeed and revenge kill Dragon-type Pokemon such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Choice Scarf Dracovish Charizard has trouble with. Corviknight can use Defog to remove Stealth Rock to keep Noivern healthy and bring it in safely in the Dragon matchup with U-turn, as well as being able to switch into Ice- and Fairy-type attacks such as Weavile's Icicle Crash and Gardevoir's Moonblast. Alternatively, its access to Taunt and Bulk Up allows it to beat defensive Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Aegislash. Togekiss can switch into Choice Scarf Dragapult, which would otherwise outspeed Noivern and beat it with Draco Meteor, as well as break down bulky defensive walls like Toxapex, Galarian Corsola, and Ferrothorn with Nasty Plot. In return, Noivern can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dracovish, Choice Specs Dragapult and Arcanine that give Corviknight and Togekiss trouble.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Ground</h1> <p>Thanks to Thousand Arrows, Zygarde-10% is an extremely unique Pokemon that can break through typical checks to Ground-types such as Celesteela, Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Corviknight and remove their Ground immunity for the team. This allows it to completely excel against types such as Flying, Electric, and Fire and improve the matchup against Steel teams, as these types rely on Ground-immune Pokemon. Additionally, its good Speed tier allows it to outpace threats such as non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Tapu Lele, and it has good offensive utility in Extreme Speed. Unfortunately, Zygarde-10% is very frail, limiting its ability to stay in on attacks like Celesteela's Heavy Slam, Skarmory's Body Press, and Rotom-W's Hydro Pump without taking heavy damage before KOing them with Thousand Arrows. While Zygarde-10%'s Dragon / Ground typing is menacing for an offensive Pokemon, it struggles to break through generally bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Slowbro due to its only average Attack stat.</p> ",

Slowbro and Amoonguss are also especially hard to wear down due to Regenerator. However, walls don't like taking a Toxic from Zygarde-10% if they aren't immune, as they are then constantly worn down during the match.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Ice-types like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Weavile can OHKO Zygarde-10% with their Ice-type STAB moves, while Avalugg can switch into it almost freely but risks taking a Toxic from it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Zygarde-10% has trouble getting past bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Tapu Bulu, since they can take its STAB moves with ease and force it out with their own STAB moves.

Outrage dents Pokemon like Pelipper, Appletun, Araquanid, and Celebi that are neutral or resistant to Thousand Arrows while providing valuable STAB coverage and helping greatly in the Dragon matchup. However, being locked into Outrage makes Zygarde-10% even more vulnerable to powerful attackers like Dragapult and bulky walls like Amoonguss, since it becomes unable to switch out for a few turns. Extreme Speed allows Zygarde-10% to revenge kill faster weakened threats such as Alolan Raichu and Barraskewda. It can use Toxic to lure in and cripple bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Galarian Corsola attempting to wall it in the long run. Maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Choice Specs Latios, while Choice Band is recommended to maximize its damage output and power. Zygarde-10% should be brought in through predicted switches or once a teammate has fainted, since it will likely take a lot of damage from powerful attacks such as Tapu Lele's Psychic, Nidoking's Earth Power, and Keldeo's Scald.</p> <p>Teammates such as Excadrill and Mamoswine appreciate Zygarde-10%'s ability to make their Ground-type moves more spammable by removing the Ground immunity from Flying-types such as Celesteela and Skarmory.

Excadrill can also remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to increase Zygarde-10%'s longevity and use Sand Rush to handle faster threats Zygarde-10% cannot take care of. Mamoswine is also useful for defeating problematic foes such as Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu, outspeeding and picking off faster foes like Dragapult with Ice Shard and removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Eviolite from prominent Pokemon such as Blissey, Mandibuzz, Porygon2, and Galarian Corsola with Knock Off. Hippowdon can deal chip damage on foes by setting Stealth Rock and sand, and it can preserve Zygarde-10%'s poor bulk by switching into most powerful attackers such as Dragonite, Terrakion, and Bisharp. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a valuable Water immunity against Urshifu-R and Barraskewda. Nidoking is good for absorbing Toxic Spikes, setting its own, and using Flamethrower to KO Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu.

Swampert is essential, as it switches into Electric-type attacks from Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Zapdos, provides utility in Stealth Rock and Roar, and brings Volcanion into Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu with Flip Turn. Slowking is a specially defensive wall that can switch into attacks from Nidoking and support Volcanion's wallbreaking with Future Sight and Teleport. Toxapex checks Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Dragapult with Poison Jab and Toxic, removes held items such as Eviolite from Porygon2 and Galarian Corsola with Knock Off to ease Volcanion's wallbreaking, and helps wear down Grass-types with the aforementioned Poison Jab and Toxic.

Haze is crucial to the set, as it prevents Toxapex from losing to the setup sweepers that it excels at checking, such as the aforementioned Dragapult as well as Zarude, Dragonite, and Volcarona. A physically defensive EV spread is used to allow Toxapex to wall the aforementioned physical attackers, which would otherwise be hard to switch into.</p> <p>Toxapex pairs well with other defensive Pokemon to form defensive backbones for Water teams. Swampert and Gastrodon are two Pokemon that can switch into Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Thundurus-T, while Toxapex can switch into Grass-type Pokemon such as Zarude and Tapu Bulu in return. Slowking is another great Pokemon that pairs well with Toxapex thanks to its resistance to Psychic and even better special bulk, which allow it to come in on attacks such as Tapu Lele's Psychic and Substitute Kyurem's Freeze-Dry. It also has Regenerator, just like Toxapex, allowing the Water user to outstall opposing defensive cores just by switching in and out between the two Pokemon. Volcanion is a good partner that beats Steel-types such as Celesteela, Melmetal, Klefki, and Ferrothorn for Toxapex, and it can Defog away the entry hazards Ferrothorn gets up for free against Toxapex. It also forms a good Fairy-breaking core with Toxapex by offensively threatening Pokemon such as Clefable with Sludge Bomb. Toxapex's defensive backbones pair will with many offensive Pokemon, but Urshifu-R in particular is a really good partner for Toxapex, as it can commonly take on Pokemon that punish Toxapex's passivity such as Ferrothorn, Arctozolt, Kyurem, Galarian Moltres, and Hydreigon.</p> "

Spectrier is a great wincon and can beat defensive cores like Toxapex + Swampert on Water and Amoonguss + Galarian Weezing on Poison thanks to its decent bulk and Substitute + Calm Mind set. Gengar is great for absorbing Toxic Spikes, revenge killing fast Pokemon like Weavile and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu, and alternatively, wallbreaking through Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Aegislash thanks to Choice Specs. Choice Scarf Blacephalon can outspeed and OHKO threats like Tapu Koko and Zarude with its STAB Fire Blast. It can also beat Steel-types Mimikyu struggles against even with Drain Punch.</p> "

Iron Defense lets Kommo-o shrug off attacks from non-Choice Band Melmetal, Excadrill, and non-Choice Band Weavile. It also boosts Body Press, allowing Kommo-o to deal with Steel-, Normal-, and Dark-types such as Ferrothorn, Porygon2, and Mandibuzz. Earthquake deals with Aegislash, which is immune to Body Press. Alternatively, Flamethrower gives Kommo-o a better matchup against Corviknight, Whimsicott, and Tapu Bulu; however, it has a chance of not breaking specially defensive Aegislash's Substitute. Substitute lets Kommo-o avoid Toxic and Leech Seed from Aegislash and Ferrothorn, respectively. It also takes advantage of forced switches against types such as Steel, Ground, and Normal, allowing Kommo-o to whittle down its checks such as Choice Specs Jirachi and Nidoking. Bulletproof blocks Shadow Ball from Aegislash, and Leftovers allows Kommo-o to remain healthy throughout the match. 200 Speed EVs with a positive nature let Kommo-o outspeed Modest Galarian Moltres, while 52 Special Defense EVs let its Substitute withstand specially defensive Heatran's Earth Power.</p> <p>Kommo-o is setup fodder for Fairy-types such as Clefable, Calm Mind Tapu Fini, and Hatterene, so Dragalge, which checks these threats, is an excellent teammate for it. Dragalge also sets Toxic Spikes, which wears down checks such as Sableye and Porygon2, and can pivot Kommo-o in safely against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, which try to take advantage of Dragalge. Nasty Plot Hydreigon provides a Psychic immunity, is an excellent wallbreaker that deals with walls such as Toxapex and Bulk Up Corviknight that Kommo-o struggles against, and works well with it to break down Ground- and Steel-type teams. Choice Scarf Dragapult deals with faster threats such as Swift Swim Kingdra, Latias, and Garchomp, which break through Kommo-o, and pivots it in against walls such as Ferrothorn, Porygon2, and Celesteela. SubRoost Kyurem heavily pressures types such as Flying, Ground, and Water, and it deals with Kommo-o's checks in Nidoking, Toxapex, and Sableye. In return, Kommo-o removes specially defensive walls such as Tyranitar, Cradily, and Ferrothorn; this synergy allows it or Kyurem to clean types such as Dark and Grass late-game. Garchomp sets Stealth Rock, pressures types such as Steel alongside Kommo-o, and can put walls such as Sableye on a timer with Toxic. Latias provides Healing Wish, which gives Kommo-o a second chance to set up if it has been greatly worn down or statused, making Kommo-o much harder to deal with.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Electric</h1> <p>Tapu Koko is Electric's most essential Pokemon due to its ability Electric Surge, providing all teammates with a boost to their Electric-type STAB attacks. Its part Fairy typing along with Dazzling Gleam is also incredibly useful to deal with Dragon- and Dark-types such as Latias, Latios, Hydreigon, and Urshifu-S, which would otherwise be difficult to beat for Electric teams. A stellar Speed tier also allows Tapu Koko to outspeed the likes of Cinderace, Tapu Lele, Choice Band Victini, and Urshifu-S, helping it set Electric Terrain and wallbreak easier. Another benefit from Electric Terrain is that grounded Pokemon cannot fall asleep; this prevents foes like Amoonguss from putting Tapu Koko and its teammates to sleep with Spore. However, Tapu Koko can be outsped by many Choice Scarf users such as Weavile, Blacephalon, and Excadrill and other faster Pokemon like Dragapult, Barraskewda, and Kingdra under rain. This forces it to take massive damage from them or switch out. Its mediocre bulk also leaves it vulnerable to priority moves and unable to consistently switch into powerful attacks, making it easily pressured during a match.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Good coverage in Thunderbolt + Grass Knot + Dazzling Gleam allows Tapu Koko to serve as a good answer to Flying and Water teams while putting work in other matchups such as Dark, Ground, and Psychic. Electric Surge-boosted Thunderbolt is particularly useful for taking down a huge threat to Fairy teams in Celesteela, which would be problematic to deal with otherwise. A high Speed stat ensures Tapu Koko outspeeds a majority of the unboosted metagame, which means it's only revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Dracovish, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T or a handful of naturally faster Pokemon like Barraskewda and Dragapult. However, Tapu Koko's terrible bulk makes it unable to switch into Pokemon like Celesteela and prone to getting revenge killed by priority attacks like Urshifu-R's Aqua Jet and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Tapu Koko faces a lot of overlap on Fairy teams, as they can typically deal with Flying and Water teams, so Tapu Koko can be rather hard to justify over Pokemon like Togekiss or Alolan Ninetales. Tapu Koko is also stopped by many Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Tapu Bulu, and Excadrill, which makes it hard for it to make progress in certain matchups.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p>A utility set with Taunt and U-turn can be used to prevent defensive Pokemon like Blissey, Clefable, Galarian Corsola, and Celebi from recovering or using other status moves. However, Tapu Koko loses out on being a great wallbreaker with Choice Specs, which can make it more reliant on its teammates to wear down foes. Expert Belt can be utilized to let Tapu Koko excel against types like Water and Dark without being locked into a specific move. It will lose out on extra damage output with Choice Specs, however, especially against foes that aren't weak to any of Tapu Koko's moves. Calm Mind is also an option over a move like Volt Switch to turn Tapu Koko into a decent setup sweeper, but its poor bulk can make it difficult for Tapu Koko to set up at times.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set can be used in order to punish types like Fairy, Psychic, Ghost, and Fire, which don't typically carry an Electric immunity, with Volt Switch. However, being Choice-locked means Tapu Koko will have more trouble playing around the Water and Flying matchups where it cannot switch between coverage options and is rendered useless against Baneful Bunker Toxapex and Protect Celesteela. Expert Belt can be used over Life Orb in order to avoid recoil; however, without Life Orb, Tapu Koko fails to 2HKO Pokemon like Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Thundurus-T and lets them switch in more easily. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to avoid Toxic Spikes in the Water matchup. However, Toxic Spikes Toxapex is rather uncommon and forgoing Life Orb means forgoing certain 2HKOs. A Calm Mind + Roost set can be used to target types like Psychic, Electric, and Ghost under dual screens. However, this means dropping a coverage move, which hinders Tapu Koko in the Flying and Water matchups. Taunt can be used to stop entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn, setup sweepers like Volcarona, defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Blissey from recovering, and Toxic Aegislash from spreading status at the cost of giving up a coverage move or Roost. U-turn can be used to pivot against Electric immunities at the cost of dropping a coverage move or Roost, and it should not be used with Life Orb.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Electric</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Fast revenge killers such as Dragapult, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Kingdra under rain are able to outspeed and dent Tapu Koko due to its mediocre bulk.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Tapu Koko struggles to take priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Extreme Speed, and Shadow Sneak from foes such as Urshifu-R, Dragonite, Zygarde-10%, and Mimikyu, as they can take advantage of Tapu Koko's mediocre bulk, especially if it's weakened.</p> <p><strong>Electric Immunities: Pokemon that are immune to Electric-type moves such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp are able to prevent Electric moves from being spammed, making Tapu Koko reliant on itself or its teammates to beat them or wear them down before breaking through the opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Dragalge, and Galarian Slowking are able to consistently take hits from Tapu Koko and retaliate by wearing it down. Dragalge is also able to set up Toxic Spikes in front of Tapu Koko, while Galarian Slowking can recover any damage inflicted by Tapu Koko due to Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, Celebi, Cradily, and Tapu Bulu resist Tapu Koko's Electric STAB moves and can take multiple hits from it due to their good bulk while being able to threaten it back with their STAB moves. Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu in particular are able to disrupt Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain due to Grassy Surge, while Rillaboom is able to outspeed Tapu Koko under Grassy Terrain with Grassy Glide.

Volt Switch allows it to pivot out of checks such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, rack chip damage on foes, and bring in a teammate to deal with these checks. Dazzling Gleam breaks through Dragon- and Dark-types such as Latias, Latios, Hydreigon, Zarude, and Urshifu-S. Grass Knot provides excellent coverage against Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Swampert, and Seismitoad, which would be able to consistently switch into Tapu Koko and block its Volt Switch. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Tapu Koko to outspeed Cinderace, Alakazam, and non-Choice Scarf Weavile while Speed tying with Spectrier. Tapu Koko should usually be led with early-game to set up Electric Terrain so it can make Electric-type moves more spammable against the opposing team. It should also wallbreak mid- or late-game once its offensive teammates have weakened the opposing team.</p> <p>Alolan Raichu heavily benefits from Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain due to its ability Surge Surfer, allowing it to outspeed almost the entire metagame, including Choice Scarf Excadrill, Swift Swim Kingdra, and Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Its Psychic typing can also be helpful against Poison-types like Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Nidoking. Zeraora is an excellent physical wallbreaker that can help against specially defensive foes like Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Tyranitar, forming a good offensive core with Tapu Koko to take on types like Dark, Psychic, Dragon, and Ghost together. Rotom-W and Zapdos both provide useful Ground immunities for Tapu Koko; Rotom-W is able to defeat or force out Mamoswine and Sand Rush Excadrill while resisting Fire-type attacks from Choice Scarf Victini and Blacephalon, which Tapu Koko particularly struggles against. Zapdos can deal with Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, Tapu Bulu, and Zarude with Heat Wave and its useful typing while getting rid of problematic entry hazards such as Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, and Toxic Spikes. Air Balloon Magnezone can trap troublesome Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Excadrill with Magnet Pull. Regieleki also heavily benefits from Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain, as its boosted Rising Voltage 2HKOes even foes that resist it like Ferrothorn, Zarude, and Kyurem while OHKOing Dragapult when aided by Choice Specs. Its absurdly high Speed stat also allows Regieleki to outspeed even popular Choice Scarf users like Nihilego, Blacephalon, and Galarian Darmanitan.</p> "

It is also the best option to hit neutral targets like Spectrier and Zapdos due to it being boosted by Electric Surge. Grass Knot hits Ground-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Mamoswine. The combination of Thunderbolt + Grass Knot breaks Water teams entirely by hitting the vast majority of Pokemon for super effective damage. Dazzling Gleam ensures Thundurus-T and Landorus-T cannot switch in for free against Fairy in fear of getting 2HKOed. It also hits Dragon-type Pokemon like Garchomp, Latios, and Kyurem, which Thunderbolt and Grass Knot can't beat. Roost increases Tapu Koko's longevity and mitigates Life Orb recoil, letting it heal throughout the match and come in on weaker attacks like Toxapex's Scald and defensive Zapdos's Discharge. A Timid nature allows Tapu Koko to outspeed Pokemon such as Alakazam and Weavile while Speed tying with Spectrier. Life Orb ensures that Tapu Koko OHKOes Celesteela with Thunderbolt and 2HKOes Landorus-T and Thundurus-T with Dazzling Gleam and prevents it from being Choice locked.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu supports Tapu Koko defensively by switching into Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Krookodile. In return, Tapu Koko can beat Pokemon like Celesteela and Tornadus-T, which would otherwise check Tapu Bulu. They both synergize offensively to reliably take on Water and Flying teams. The combination of Stealth Rock and Knock Off makes Clefable an amazing teammate by further helping Tapu Koko in the Flying matchup. Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Zapdos and Mantine means Tapu Koko can put in work by forcing switches while punishing the same Defoggers with Thunderbolt. Klefki patches up Tapu Koko's poor bulk with its ability to set dual screens. It can also set Spikes to punish types like Ground and Water alongside Tapu Koko forcing switches. Azumarill's ability to revenge kill a faster and dangerous threat in Excadrill and beat Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Slowking after a Belly Drum boost is appreciated by Tapu Koko. Choice Specs Tapu Lele supports Tapu Koko by breaking Pokemon like Blissey and Amoonguss, which wall Tapu Koko, with Psyshock. Grimmsnarl can help against Psychic and Ghost teams alongside Tapu Koko, providing synergy against the matchups. Try to not let Tapu Koko get badly poisoned by Pokemon such as Toxapex and Celesteela, as that will hinder its ability to stay in for long durations of time when it needs to swap between moves. Be wary of Choice Scarf Rotom-W's Trick, as giving Tapu Koko a Choice Scarf means it cannot switch moves against Water anymore.</p> "

Psychic Terrain boosts the power of Psychic-type STAB moves, especially teammates' Expanding Force, while invalidating priority moves like Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Aqua Jet from users such as Bisharp, Aegislash, Mimikyu, and Azumarill. This greatly benefits Tapu Lele's faster teammates and lets it beat Azumarill. Tapu Lele has a few great coverage options to deal with its typical checks, such as Thunderbolt for Celesteela and Corviknight, Focus Blast for Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Tyranitar, and Shadow Ball for Ghost-types like Aegislash. However, even with Psychic Terrain's protection, Tapu Lele's average Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by numerous naturally faster Pokemon such as Zeraora, Volcarona, Gengar, and Nihilego that it would desire to outspeed. Tapu Lele's poor physical bulk also makes it difficult for it to consistently switch into attacks and set up Psychic Terrain for its teammates.</p> <h1>Fairy</h1> <p>Tapu Lele serves as a unique wallbreaker for Fairy teams thanks to its ability Psychic Surge, which strengthens its Psychic-type moves while also blocking priority moves from foes like Scizor, Weavile, and Dragonite. Moreover, Tapu Lele's STAB combination is very good against many matchups, and, with the help of wallbreaker teammates like Azumarill and Tapu Bulu, it can easily clean late-game. Coverage options such as Focus Blast and Thunderbolt can help Tapu Lele against Pokemon that it cannot beat normally, such as Heatran, Celesteela, and Mantine. However, its Speed tier is middling; even with a Choice Scarf, Tapu Lele is slower than other common Choice Scarf users such as Gengar, Blacephalon, and Weavile. This Speed, combined with its bad defenses, means Tapu Lele cannot reliably switch into threats and is oftentimes limited to revenge killing or accepting heavy hits. This also leaves Tapu Lele weak to the aforementioned Choice Scarf users. Lastly, Psychic Terrain also blocks teammate priority moves, such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak.</p> ",

Thunderbolt can break through bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Slowking, Slowbro, and Celesteela, letting this set wreck Water and Flying teams with the combination of Psychic and Thunderbolt. Shadow Ball can be used over Thunderbolt to help against Ghost-types like Aegislash as well as foes like Jirachi, attempting to switch in on Tapu Lele's other attacks.

Slowbro is a great physical wall that resists Fire-type attacks such as Cinderace's Pyro Ball and Victini's V-create for Tapu Lele while guaranteeing it safe entry with Teleport. Slowbro can also carry Thunder Wave, slowing down foes like Volcarona and Hydreigon for Tapu Lele. Jirachi provides Stealth Rock support, slows down foes like Nihilego and Hydreigon with Thunder Wave, has the combination of Serene Grace and Iron Head to slowly wear down foes, and brings Tapu Lele in safely with U-turn. Additionally, a Choice Scarf set lets Jirachi outspeed threats like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and non-Choice Scarf Dragapult, which are huge threats to Tapu Lele. Celebi is an alternative Stealth Rock setter over Jirachi thanks to its part-Grass typing, allowing it to force out Water- and Ground-types like Swampert, Seismitoad, Hippowdon, and Excadrill, the latter being a big threat for Psychic teams. Additionally, it can absorb status aliments with Natural Cure, provide U-turn and Healing Wish support, and use Recover for great longevity. Latias is able to remove problematic entry hazards such as Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, and Stealth Rock for Tapu Lele with Defog while providing a natural immunity to Ground-type attacks like Sand Rush Excadrill's Earthquake, Nidoking's Earth Power, and Garchomp's Earthquake. It can also provide Healing Wish support. Alakazam is a dedicated revenge killer that can KO an abundance of threats such as Choice Scarf Weavile, Barraskewda, Scolipede, and Drapion with its high Speed tier, Counter, Focus Sash, and Magic Guard, which prevents any form of residual damage, making it more effective in this role.</p> "

Zen Headbutt may be used over High Horsepower, as it allows Tapu Bulu to threaten Galarian Weezing and Amoonguss. Similarly, Stone Edge allows it to heavily damage Flying-types such as Zapdos, but losing High Horsepower leaves Tapu Bulu unable to OHKO Aegislash and Toxapex at +2. Substitute may be used to take advantage of forced switches and evade status, but the reduced coverage is detrimental to its ability to break down Steel and Poison teams.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p>High Horsepower can be used over Zen Headbutt to help defeat Galarian Slowking and Aegislash while getting higher damage off immediately on Heatran; however, Grass teams value the ability to defeat Galarian Weezing more. Stone Edge can be used over, again, Zen Headbutt to hit bulky Flying-type Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Mantine. Substitute can alsoreplace it to ease prediction and become much more threatening while boosted versus Steel teams, although as aforementioned, the coverage from Zen Headbutt is appreciated more.

High Horsepower threatens Steel- and Poison-types such as Aegislash, Dragalge, and Toxapex. Close Combat deals with other Steel-types such as Celesteela, Melmetal, and Ferrothorn, and it also allows Tapu Bulu to pick off weakened defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz. Babiri Berry allows it to lure in and remove Excadrill for Fairy teams, while Life Orb allows it to OHKO Toxapex and Melmetal at +2 with High Horsepower and Close Combat, respectively. Alternatively, Leftovers turns Tapu Bulu into a bulky sweeper that can be difficult for teams such as Fairy, Electric, and Water teams to take down, as it stacks with Grassy Terrain and Horn Leech recovery. 232 Speed EVs let it outspeed and remove offensive variants of Celesteela and Tyranitar, as well as common defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W and specially defensive Heatran.</p> <p>Klefki is an excellent teammate for Tapu Bulu, as it sets dual screens to help Tapu Bulu set up safely, sets Spikes to wear down the opposing team, and can wall and paralyze Poison-types such as Nihilego and Gengar for it. In return, Tapu Bulu provides Grassy Terrain to dampen Earthquake and takes on Ground-types such as Excadrill and Swampert. Calm Mind Clefable is a bulky special setup sweeper that works well with Tapu Bulu, as both wear down defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, Heatran, and Toxapex, allowing one of them to eventually overwhelm teams such as Steel and Water teams. Azumarill deals with Fire-types such as Victini and Blacephalon, and it can use a Belly Drum set to break down types such as Poison and Steel late-game. Calm Mind Tapu Fini is a bulky special setup sweeper that loves Tapu Bulu's ability to wear down Ferrothorn, Dragalge, and Celesteela, and in return it deals with Heatran, Hydreigon, and Dragonite. Tapu Koko checks fast threats such as Galarian Moltres and Weavile, can pivot Tapu Bulu in against bulky defensive Pokemon that it can threaten such as Swampert, Galarian Slowking, and Ferrothorn, and deals with Flying-types such as Celesteela and Crobat. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele deals with faster Poison- and Dragon-types such as Nidoking and Kyurem, and it appreciates Tapu Bulu dealing with defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, Tyranitar, and Slowking, as this allows Tapu Lele to clean types like Flying, Dark, and Water late-game. Hatterene is a bulky Calm Mind sweeper that provides entry hazard control in the form of Magic Bounce, which stops Toxapex's Toxic Spikes from wearing down Tapu Bulu, allowing it to pressure teams such as Water and Poison teams more consistently. Hatterene also appreciates Tapu Bulu's ability to remove Pokemon that wall it such as Magnezone and specially defensive Tyranitar, allowing it to sweep types such as Electric and Dark late-game.</p> "

Life Orb gives Tapu Bulu a boost to damage without much drawback, as the recovery from Horn Leech in tandem with Grassy Terrain allows it to ignore the recoil.

Choice Scarf Zarude provides valuable revenge killing for Grass teams and defeats Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten Tapu Bulu, such as Victini and Tapu Lele, while pivoting on bulky Pokemon it lures in such as Ferrothorn, which Tapu Bulu can beat. Ferrothorn is great in making the defensive backbone of a Grass team, switching into ce- and Bug-type moves from Pokemon such as Weavile and Golisopod, as well as setting an entry hazard in either Stealth Rock or Spikes. Cradily is able to switch into special-attacking Pokemon such as Zapdos, Galarian Moltres, and Kyurem, which can all prove troublesome to Grass, while also providing Stealth Rock to help Tapu Bulu break through teams more easily.

Leech Life is mandatory to deal with Psychic- and Grass-types like Alakazam, Celebi, and Rillaboom and is also a way to provide passive recovery during the match. Ice Punch hits Flying- and Dragon-types like Landorus-T, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Garchomp. Earthquake can be used in the fourth moveslot to not be completely walled by Poison- and Steel-types that resist Buzzwole's STAB moves, like Toxapex and Aegislash. 252 EVs in Speed alongside a Jolly nature and Choice Scarf allow it to outpace threats like Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu, Tapu Koko, and Alakazam.</p> <p>Cobalion is a great partner for Buzzwole, as it is one of the best Stealth Rock setters for Fighting teams.

Cobalion also helps against Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Mimikyu and can paralyze faster threats like Choice Scarf Latias for Buzzwole. Keldeo handles physically defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Hippowdon. Terrakion is a powerful setup sweeper and great teammate for Buzzwole, as Buzzwole appreciates its ability to weaken opposing teams so that it can act as a deadly sweeper late-game.

It can also overpower defensive walls like Hippowdon, Celesteela, and Skarmory, allowing Buzzwole to sweep. Toxicroak is a good partner to improve the matchup against Fairy and Water teams, which can be a big problem to deal with for Fighting teams. Lastly, Swords Dance Guts Heracross can act as a wallbreaker and deal with defensive walls like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Amoonguss.

  "Celesteela": {
    "overview": "<h1>Flying</h1> <p>Celesteela's stellar defensive typing, handy resistances, and impressive mixed bulk make it a potent defensive pivot for Flying teams, allowing it to check physical and special threats and soft check Pokemon like Kyurem. Its Steel typing allows it to check Rock- and Ice-type threats such as Terrakion, Tyranitar, Nihilego, and Weavile. It also has quite the colorful movepool, ranging from options such as Leech Seed, Toxic, Flamethrower, Meteor Beam, and Autotomize, letting it run defensive or offensive sets. Even as a defensive wall, Celesteela has offensive potential with Heavy Slam and Flamethrower, letting it beat Pokemon such as Dragonite and Bisharp, which its competitors like Defog Corviknight fail to do. However, Celesteela lacks a reliable recovery move unlike Corviknight, which can also act as a wincon with Bulk Up or provide Defog support. A lack of a reliable recovery move and its over reliance on Leech Seed + Protect on its defensive set can be taken advantage of by setup sweepers like Bisharp, Garchomp, and Aegislash. Additionally, it also makes it unable to recover against Grass-types, making it harder for it to beat certain bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss. It also cannot stomach ridiculously strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Urshifu-R and Choice Specs Aegislash. Celesteela is also easily shut down by stallbreakers like Mew and Mandibuzz.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>Celesteela's Flying type is invaluable for Steel teams to switch into Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Landorus and Excadrill while also being neutral to Fighting for Pokemon like Buzzwole and Terrakion. It can pair with Heatran and Aegislash to form the fabled triple immunity core—three immunities on top of Steel's Poison immunity—which many types have trouble dealing with. Good bulk along with the combination of Leech Seed, Toxic, and Protect allows Celesteela to wear down and hugely hinder most teams. It beats a majority of opposing walls like Mantine and Gastrodon, wearing them down while being immune to Toxic itself. On the off chance it KOes an opposing Pokemon, Celesteela can take advantage of the increase in Defense from Beast Boost to be an even greater wall. Though Celesteela is the best Flying-type choice for Steel teams overall, it faces competition from Skarmory and Corviknight, which both have reliable recovery and other distinguishing traits. Corviknight is an invaluable defensive pivot, has Defog, and can stall out Stealth Rock with Pressure. Skarmory offers much greater physical bulk to deal with Urshifu-R and Weavile, Pokemon Celesteela might struggle against in the long run, and can set entry hazards. Further, Celesteela's typing leaves it vulnerable to Fire- and Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Victini and Thundurus-T.</p> ",

A specially defensive set can also be used to better deal with threats like Choice Specs Kyurem and Nidoking.</p> <h1>Steel</h1> <p>A fully specially defensive set allows Celesteela to better take on Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Nidoking, and Galarian Moltres, though it becomes less useful against physical threats such as Mamoswine and Terrakion.

Fairy-, and Ice-types like Tyranitar, Tapu Lele, and Weavile and also hits neutral targets like Nidoking, Tapu Koko, and Dragapult decently hard. Flamethrower is important, as it allows Celesteela to deal with Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and opposing Celesteela.

Physically defensive Celesteela can struggle to take on strong special attackers like Galarian Moltres, Hydreigon, and Heatran, so Pokemon like Mantine should be used to form a pair with it, as it can check such Pokemon while also covering Water- and Fire-types like Urshifu-R and Volcarona. Galarian Moltres is a great setup sweeper and wallbreaker that can break down passive defensive walls for Celesteela like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Slowbro. Zapdos is another great teammate, as it can run a variety of sets to support it; the specially defensive set forms a defensive core with it, while the more threatening Choice Specs set simply blasts away Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Ferrothorn, making it easier for Celesteela to defensively threaten opposing teams. Galarian Zapdos can take care of opposing Steel-types for Celesteela, especially when Flamethrower is not used on the set.

Leech Seed is Celesteela's only form of healing outside of Leftovers and is therefore vital for keeping it healthy, as well as whittling down potential switch-ins like Heatran and Zapdos. Protect lets Celesteela scout Choice item users like Victini and Galarian Darmanitan and gain additional opportunities for healing from Leech Seed and Leftovers. Flamethrower deals meaningful damage to Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon that it might otherwise struggle against, notably Ferrothorn, Zarude, and opposing Celesteela, stopping the first two from setting up freely against it. Toxic is an option over Flamethrower to pressure opposing walls like Hippowdon and Mantine, as well as potential switch-ins expecting Heavy Slam like Volcarona and Zeraora. It also synergizes with Protect for building Toxic damage while healing. Maximum HP and Defense investment, with an Impish nature, allows Celesteela to best fit its role as a physical wall to handle Pokemon like Terrakion and Mamoswine. A Relaxed nature is used with Flamethrower to avoid weakening either of its attacking moves.</p> <p>Nearly the entire roster of Steel-types appreciates Celesteela's Ground immunity and Fighting neutrality, as well as the passive recovery from Leech Seed. Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Aegislash with Protect or King's Shield can pair with Celesteela to severely hinder Choice item Pokemon from making progress. Heatran pairs great with Celesteela to check opposing Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn, switch into potential Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Victini, provide Stealth Rock support, and phaze setup sweepers like Hydreigon and Togekiss with Roar. An offensive set with Magma Storm + Taunt can be used to trap and eliminate other walls like Toxapex that threaten Celesteela. Excadrill and Ferrothorn both can switch into Electric-type attacks. Excadrill also offers entry hazard removal, and Choice Scarf Excadrill can revenge kill threats like Cinderace and Zeraora, while Swords Dance Excadrill is a potent sweeper that can be a huge threat to certain types like Poison and Electric. Ferrothorn also brings setup, and its resistance to Water helps it to take care of bulky Water-types like Swampert and Slowking for Celesteela, especially if Celesteela lacks Toxic. Ferrothorn itself appreciates Celesteela's neutrality to Fighting. Aegislash and Celesteela are able to form an anti-Fighting core with their immunity and neutrality, respectively, to deal with Pokemon that normally pose a large threat to Steel-type teams like Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos. Bisharp threatens certain switch-ins like Slowking, removes Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers to allow Celesteela to better punish switches, and deals with numerous threats for Steel-type teams like Victini and Alolan Raichu. Melmetal is a bulky offensive threat, great at forcing progress, that strongly benefits from Leech Seed's recovery, as it has no reliable healing. Jirachi can be a powerful offensive option to threaten Water-, Dragon-, and Poison-types like Toxapex, Kommo-o, and Hydreigon, which all give Celesteela trouble one way or another.</p> "

Choice Scarf lets it revenge kill Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Thundurus-T, which are otherwise threats to Fire teams. However, Blacephalon has pitiful bulk and finds it really hard to come into battle. Due to its poor bulk, even resisted attacks tend to take a good chunk of its health. Due to its typing, Blacephalon is weak to common priority moves like Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Aqua Jet from Pokemon such as Bisharp, Aegislash, and Azumarill, which makes it easy to check. A lacking movepool also makes it more predictable for opposing teams.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p>Blacephalon is gifted with one of the game's highest Special Attack stats, a great ability in Beast Boost, and a great secondary typing in Fire, making it a fierce sweeper. Beast Boost and Choice Scarf allow it to snowball through many teams and be one of the best revenge killers in the tier, outspeeding key threats to Ghost teams like Zeraora and Dragapult as well as Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T. However, Blacephalon is extremely frail and is threatened by any super effective priority move such as Aqua Jet, Sucker Punch, or Shadow Sneak from users like Azumarill, Bisharp, and Mimikyu. Furthermore, Blacephalon's poor bulk gives it very limited opportunities to safely switch into the field. Blacephalon can at times be difficult to fit on Ghost teams because it faces competition from other strong revenge killers and wallbreakers like Gengar and Spectrier. It can also struggle to break through bulky Pokemon like Heatran and Mantine, which easily prevent it from sweeping.

A Substitute + Calm Mind set is also an option to take on specific teams like Normal, but Cinderace already does a good job of beating such types, and Blacephalon's low bulk grants fewer opportunities to set up.</p> <h1>Ghost</h1> <p>A Calm Mind + Substitute set can help Blacephalon get past specially defensive walls, but it has very low bulk, so the Special Defense boost isn't hugely helpful. However, Blacephalon forces out most Grass- and Ice-types like Zarude and Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, which allows it to set up as they switch and opens up new KO opportunities. This set also helps greatly in matchups like Steel and Normal; however, the low usage of Normal and Heatran having to be severely chipped in the Steel matchup leaves it less preferred. Another option is Choice Specs over the Choice Scarf, but losing the Speed boost opens Blacephalon up to OHKOs from Choice Scarf users like Galarian Darmanitan and Krookodile, or naturally faster foes such as Gengar, Spectrier, Weavile, and Dragapult.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Fire</h1> <p><strong>Priority moves: Blacephalon is often easily dealt with by common super effective priority moves like Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, Aqua Jet, and Accelerock from Pokemon such as Bisharp, Mimikyu, Azumarill, and Lycanroc.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls like Mantine, Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, Blissey, and Tyranitar can easily take Blacephalon's attacks.

Its access to Outrage is particularly useful for the Dragon matchup, which is very threatening to Electric teams. It is able to either act as an immediately powerful wallbreaker with Choice Band or a threatening setup sweeper with Bulk Up. However, despite Zeraora's great Speed tier, it is outsped and revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Blacephalon, Galarian Darmanitan, and Excadrill.

Its great natural bulk allows it to tank a variety of attacks, such as Garchomp's Earthquake, and then dish out massive damage. Iron Fist increases the power of its Double Iron Bash, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch, further improving its wallbreaking prowess. Superpower, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch all allow Melmetal to target various Pokemon that Double Iron Bash isn't as effective against. Even with all these great qualities, its poor Speed means it will usually need to be healthy to tank an attack and do damage, making it more vulnerable to burns and reducing its overall effectiveness. Its special bulk is quite poor, allowing many strong special attackers such as Hydreigon and Nidoking to easily take it out with their super effective STAB attacks.

Volcanion provides Water immunity and can deal with major threats such as Belly Drum Azumarill. Dual screens Rotom-H gives Cinderace an easier time setting up while also providing Ground immunity with Levitate, and it can also target Flying-types such as Mantine with its Nasty Plot set.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Corviknight is an amazing Defogger for Flying teams because of its excellent defensive typing, bulk, and ability in Pressure. Its Steel typing allows it to comfortably take Rock- and Ice-type moves, which would typically be problematic, such as Tyranitar's and Terrakion's Stone Edge, Cloyster's Icicle Spear,and Mamoswine's Icicle Crash; it also provides Corviknight with a variety of resistances, allowing it to switch in on other Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Excadrill. Its Steel typing also gives it a Toxic immunity, meaning Corviknight can take on defensive Stealth Rock setters such as Hippowdon, Shuckle, Piloswine, and Seismitoad that may carry the move. Pressure is particularly good on this set, as it means Corviknight can PP stall Stealth Rock users and keep entry hazards off the field more easily in conjunction with Defog. Body Press hits Pokemon such as Bisharp, Cloyster, Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Tyranitar for super effective damage, allowing Corviknight to check these Pokemon reliably. U-turn is important for Corviknight, as it can grab momentum against Pokemon it can't beat like Toxapex and Aegislash and bring in a teammate to more reliably take them on. Throughout the game, Corviknight should aim to find opportunities where it can comfortably use Defog or grab momentum using U-turn by switching in on Pokemon it walls. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Corviknight to check the aforementioned Pokemon in Mamoswine, Weavile, Cloyster, Excadrill, and Bisharp with more reliability while also boosting the power of Body Press to check these threats.</p> <p>Because Flying teams are typically weak to Stealth Rock, all of Corviknight's teammates appreciate its incredible reliability as a Defogger to keep entry hazards off the field. Choice Scarf Charizard is a great teammate for Corviknight, as it can outspeed and beat threats to Corviknight such as Choice Scarf Duraludon, Hydreigon, Aegislash, and Heliolisk; Charizard also appreciates Corviknight's Defog due to its 4x Stealth Rock weakness. Choice Scarf Noivern is another teammate that can outspeed and beat Dragon-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dracovish and Choice Specs Dragapult. Corviknight's U-turn is also good for bringing Charizard and Noivern in comfortably in matchups such as Steel and Dragon, respectively. Togekiss is a great setup sweeper that can break through Pokemon with Nasty Plot in conjunction with Thunder Wave and Air Slash, such as Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Dragapult, that Corviknight can't get past. Mantine can be used as a secondary Defogger, switching into a variety of strong special attacks with its good special bulk and defensive typing, such as Seismitoad's and Keldeo's Hydro Pump, Choice Scarf Dragapult's and Charizard's Fire Blast, and Choice Specs Aegislash's Shadow Ball, working together with Corviknight to form a good defensive core that can remove hazards for the rest of the team.</p> "

        "name": "Bulk Up (Steel)",
        "description": "<p>Corviknight's great bulk, amazing defensive typing, and access to Bulk Up make it a dangerous threat in the metagame that can be problematic to take down for unprepared teams. It's a staple for Steel teams because its typing gives it a very important Ground immunity that lets it check threats such as Excadrill as well as taking neutral damage from Fighting-type attacks. Special Defense investment is crucial because it allows Corviknight to comfortably switch into attacks such as Gengar's Shadow Ball and Flygon's Flamethrower. Mirror Armor is used to take on common Mystical Fire users, such as Hatterene, Indeedee, and Gardevoir, and lower their Special Attack. Mirror Armor can also help it avoid Special Defense drops from attacks like Shadow Ball. Bulk Up boosts Corviknight's already decent Defense, making it more difficult to take down, and increases its offensive pressure by boosting its Attack, allowing Brave Bird to break defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Hippowdon more easily. Brave Bird is its best STAB move and hits threatening Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Kommo-o that take very little from its other attacking options for super effective damage. Alternatively, it can use Power Trip, which becomes very strong after a couple of boosts, to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively at the cost of not being able to take on Fighting-types as effectively. Roost, paired with Leftovers, gives Corviknight a form of recovery to support its bulky setup and increase its longevity. Taunt prevents Toxapex from using Haze, Hippowdon from phazing Corviknight with Whirlwind, Ferrothorn from setting up entry hazards, and other Pokemon from recovering, setting up, or using their own Taunt. Due to its great bulk, Corviknight can afford to switch into threatening attacks, as its main role is to apply defensive pressure. It should find opportunities to use Bulk Up against passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and against Pokemon that don't threaten to 2HKO it such as Choice Scarf Terrakion.</p> <p>Ferrothorn forms a great defensive core with Corviknight and provides an important resistance to Water for Steel teams, as they're threatened by powerful attacks such as Seismitoad's Hydro Pump. Ferrothorn can also use Leech Seed and set up entry hazards to soften up the opposing team to make it easier for Corviknight to sweep. Excadrill covers Corviknight's weakness to Electric-type attacks, such as Zeraora's Plasma Fists, and can threaten Electric- and Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Charizard with its Mold Breaker Earthquake and Rock Slide, respectively, as well as revenge killing threats such as Hydreigon and SubToxic Salazzle. Choice Scarf Duraludon is another great partner that can revenge kill troublesome Pokemon such as Dragapult and Hydreigon and use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis on the opposing team to give Corviknight an easier time dealing with otherwise faster foes. Aegislash appreciates Corviknight's Ground immunity and in return can wallbreak the opposing team to weaken Corviknight's checks. Aegislash's Fighting immunity allows it to check threats such as Terrakion, and its good bulk also lets it survive some attacks that threaten Corviknight, such as Hydreigon and Dragapult's Fire Blast, whose users Aegislash can OHKO in return. Jirachi is a good option for breaking Water teams with its great coverage, notably being able to threaten Keldeo and Toxapex with its STAB-boosted Psychic. Melmetal is a very powerful and bulky wallbreaker that can soften up the opposing team to allow Corviknight to set up more easily and win. Lucario and Bisharp can also break holes in the opponent's team by setting up with Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, respectively, and they're great against Dark- and Psychic-type teams.</p> "

Corviknight's natural bulk makes it fairly easy to activate Weakness Policy and then use Agility and Bulk Up, turning Power Trip into a menacing attack. Roost allows Corviknight to set up more easily. After a few boosts, Power Trip allows Corviknight to sweep types like Psychic, Steel, and Flying. Corviknight's EV spread outpaces Tapu Koko after Agility, and the rest of its EVs are dumped into HP and Special Defense, letting it tank strong special attacks such as Kyurem's Freeze-Dry and Tornadus-T's Heat Wave.</p> <p>Corviknight forms an \"immunity core\" with Aegislash and Heatran: the three of them cover Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks, respectively. Heatran can also burn physical attackers like Zeraora with Lava Plume, giving Corviknight more opportunities to set up. Melmetal can help Corviknight break through walls such as Toxapex and Hippowdon, which can undo its setup progress with Haze or Whirlwind. Additionally, Melmetal's Double Iron Bash can target Fairy- and Dark-type Pokemon that resist Corviknight's Power Trip, such as Galarian Moltres on Flying teams. Excadrill provides an Electric immunity and handles threats such as Tapu Koko. Ferrothorn can stack entry hazards alongside Heatran and wear down the opposing team with Leech Seed, allowing Corviknight to clean late-game. Ferrothorn also provides a resistance to Water, which it uses to check threats such as Tapu Fini. Also, Choice Specs Jirachi can help break through tough Poison-type Pokemon like Amoonguss and Toxapex with Psychic, and Dark-type Pokemon like Hydreigon with Moonblast, all of which can threaten Corviknight. On hyper offense teams, Klefki can provide dual screens support to make it easier for Corviknight to set up.</p> "

Dual screens support is great for Psychic teams, as it not only makes Orbeetle's teammates harder to revenge kill but also aids setup sweepers in setting up much more efficiently. Sticky Web, on the other hand, slows down faster threats like Choice Scarf Weavile and Gengar, allowing teammates like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Jirachi to deal with such threats much more easily and to threaten opposing teams better. Orbeetle should be used early-game so that it can provide essential support to the team to have momentum going; however, when faced against teams with Magic Bounce users like Hatterene and Xatu, it's best not to set up Sticky Web recklessly, as it can backfire. U-turn should be used to switch into an appropriate teammate after Orbeetle has set screens or Sticky Web. Frisk allows Orbeetle to scout for items on the opposing teams. Maximum HP and Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Orbeetle as fast as possible to outspeed Pokemon like Rotom-H and Mamoswine while surviving as many hits as possible doing so.

Spikes allows it to help chip opposing Pokemon on the switch in to help offensive teammates like Barbaracle and Tyranitar sweep. Fire Blast takes care of troublesome Steel- and Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Celebi. Heavy Slam allows Coalossal to greatly damage Fairy-types like Togekiss, Hatterene, and Mimikyu. Rapid Spin gives Rock teams a way to remove hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes in matchups such as Poison and Bug that could stop a teammate from sweeping. Flame Body is very good against physical attackers such as Jirachi and Bisharp to hinder them with a burn. Use Coalossal early-game to get down Spikes to make it easier for its teammates to sweep.

Barbaracle is an excellent teammate to take care of Ground-types such as Seismitoad and Mamoswine with Grass Knot and Liquidation, and it appreciates Coalossal to break Dugtrio's Focus Sash with Spikes. Shuckle can form a hazard stacking duo with Coalossal to further support setup Pokemon, setting Stealth Rock and Sticky Web to help its teammates such as Shell Smash Barbaracle, Swords Dance Terrakion, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar sweep. Tyranitar is also useful for setting sand that helps Coalossal stomach special attacks even better. Rhyperior is great for taking care of Corviknight with Smack Down + Earthquake, which Coalossal struggles to deal with. Terrakion can greatly help with taking care of Excadrill, Urshifu-S, and Hydreigon with Close Combat. Lycanroc-D helps to handle Poison-types such as Toxapex and can use Accelerock to finish off Pokemon like Volcarona and Scolipede.

This is backed by its great coverage moves in Close Combat, Psychic Fangs, and Crunch, allowing it to hit a multitude of different threats such as Kyurem, Amoonguss, and Slowking. Flip Turn grants rain teams with more pivoting, allowing the archetype to have a lot of momentum.

Psychic Fangs grants Barraskewda coverage against Poison- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, Keldeo, and Urshifu-R. Crunch can be used over Psychic Fangs to target Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latios, Dragapult, and Jellicent. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to chip foes such as physically defensive Rotom-W, allowing it to KO it later with Waterfall, and maintain momentum. Swift Swim allows Barraskewda to outpace threats such as Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T in rain. Maximum Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature allows Barraskewda to outspeed Tapu Koko and Spectrier outside of rain while outpacing +2 Adamant Dragapult in rain. An Adamant nature can be used to 2HKO Toxapex with Psychic Fangs and 2HKO Mandibuzz in rain with Waterfall.

Swampert sets Stealth Rock, provides an Electric immunity, takes on Electric-types like Zeraora outside of rain with Earthquake, and brings Barraskewda in safely with Flip Turn. Slowking provides a reliable switch-in into Psychic-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Psychic, helps Barraskewda pressure Poison- and Water-types like Toxapex with Future Sight, and safely brings in Barraskewda with Teleport. Slowking also acts as a nice sponge for special attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor. Kingdra is Barraskewda's best partner, targeting matchups where Barraskewda struggles such as Dragon, taking on Grass-types like Amoonguss and Zarude with Hurricane, and generating momentum with Flip Turn.

        "description": "<p>Hatterene is a bulky Calm Mind user on Psychic teams that massively threatens types such as Dark and Dragon, and it disrupts offensive archetypes such as rain Water, Ice, and Electric that Psychic teams may struggle to keep up against. Additionally, thanks to Magic Bounce, it can deter entry hazards for Psychic teams, which otherwise have poor entry hazard control. Psyshock hits special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Dragalge hard, while Psychic lets Hatterene pressure Toxapex better. Draining Kiss allows Hatterene to hit Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Galarian Moltres and Kyurem hard. Additionally, it provides Hatterene with recovery, making it harder to revenge kill. Trick Room takes advantage of its naturally low Speed. Calm Mind + Trick Room allows Hatterene to very easily take on teams that are weak to its STAB attacks, and it can flip the matchups against Electric and rain Water teams, which typically rely on their high Speed. The EVs and a Relaxed nature make it as slow as possible for Trick Room. Leftovers helps Hatterene set up.</p> <p>Hatterene's teammates appreciate it both deterring entry hazards and soft checking Dark-type Pokemon. As Hatterene is walled by Steel-types such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn, Victini, a teammate that pressures both, is a great choice. Victini also loves Hatterene keeping Stealth Rock off the field, allowing it to preserve its health to wallbreak with a Choice Band set. Slowbro is a fantastic defensive pivot that can provide Psychic teams breathing room against threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Weavile. Slowbro also generates momentum for the team through Teleport, safely bringing in a teammate while regaining health thanks to Regenerator. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele forms an offensive core with Hatterene and cleans up types such as Dragon and Dark once Hatterene has worn down or eliminated Dragalge or Tyranitar, for example. Choice Scarf Jirachi can take on Fairy- and Ice-type Pokemon that can threaten Hatterene, such as opposing Hatterene and Galarian Darmanitan, with Iron Head. Jirachi can also provide Hatterene with a new lease on life through Healing Wish or pivot it in safely with U-turn. Galarian Slowking absorbs Toxic Spikes for Hatterene, which is especially useful because Hatterene is unlikely to switch into common setters like Dragalge, and is a decent specially defensive wall that keeps threats such as specially defensive Aegislash and Heatran at bay. Choice Scarf Latias picks off fast threats such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon, non-Choice Scarf Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Zarude and provides Healing Wish support. Stallbreaker Mew with a Kasib Berry can cripple physical attackers such as Zeraora and Tyranitar with Will-O-Wisp, lure in and remove Blacephalon and Dragapult with Knock Off, and get rid of bulky Pokemon's Leftovers with Knock Off, allowing Hatterene to sweep more easily.</p> "

Rest and Sleep Talk are used together to give Grimmsnarl a form of recovery, allowing Grimmsnarl to set up more consistently. With Rest, Grimmsnarl makes a good sponge to status conditions such as burn and Toxic poison as well. Spirit Break is used to deal significant damage against types such as Dragon and Fighting and in mirror matchups. The Special Attack drop from Spirit Break also allows Grimmsnarl to take on specially offensive Pokemon that it struggles against, such as Duraludon, pairing well with Bulk Up boosting its Defense. Prankster complements Grimmsnarl's whole set, as it allows Grimmsnarl to almost always move first, helping Dark-type teams with handling powerful foes such as Zeraora and Dracozolt. However, Sleep Talk rolls often are too unreliable to handle Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Duraludon, and Gardevoir, so it is recommended to not take any risks against foes that can naturally beat Grimmsnarl. Leftovers grants Grimmsnarl additional passive recovery. A specially defensive EV spread is used because Grimmsnarl's physical stats are already boosted by Bulk Up.</p> <p>Hydreigon acts as a solid wallbreaker with its excellent coverage and firepower, eliminating threats such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight for Grimmsnarl, and both Pokemon drastically improve the Dragon-type matchup. Drapion sets up Toxic Spikes for Grimmsnarl, forcing opposing Pokemon to switch more often, thus allowing Grimmsnarl to set up more consistently. With a Choice Scarf set, Drapion also drastically improves the Fairy-type matchup. Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock, which can negate Focus Sash and Sturdy of foes like Duraludon to prevent them from revenge killing Grimmsnarl. With its good special bulk, Tyranitar can also handle specially offensive Fairy-type threats for Grimmsnarl, such as Ribombee and Gardevoir. Bisharp's part Steel typing allows it to handle slow Fairy-types such as Clefable and Hatterene. It can also beat opposing RestTalk Grimmsnarl and has a powerful STAB priority in Sucker Punch that helps with taking on fast threats such as Arctozolt. Mandibuzz provides Defog support to Grimmsnarl, which allows Grimmsnarl to switch in and set up more safely. With Toxic, it can also cripple threats such as Hippowdon that prevent Grimmsnarl from setting up. Mandibuzz also provides a handful of neutralities to types such as Bug and Fighting and a Ground-type immunity for teammates such as Tyranitar and Drapion.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Grimmsnarl is capable of serving as an effective setup sweeper using Bulk Up when paired with Rest's recovery and Sleep Talk giving it the ability to set up and attack while asleep. Prankster is amazing for this set, as it gives priority to Grimmsnarl's Bulk Up along with Rest and Sleep Talk; this helps tremendously against offensive Pokemon, as it allows Grimmsnarl to boost, heal, and use Darkest Lariat if picked by Sleep Talk first. Darkest Lariat's the chosen attack, as its ability to hit through Defense boosts allows Grimmsnarl to serve as a solid answer to opposing setup sweepers that boost Defense, such as Corviknight and Snorlax. Darkest Lariat is also effective against Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Bronzong, Reuniclus, Gengar, and Aegislash, while also hitting other Steel-type Pokemon such as Excadrill and Corviknight, which Fairy teams appreciate. Though Rest does give it recovery, be aware that Sleep Talk is not always reliable, so Rest should be used on an as-needed basis. As it has a poor unboosted Defense stat, Grimmsnarl should try to set up on defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight, Bronzong, and Seismitoad rather than wallbreakers such as Mamoswine, Galarian Darmanitan, and Diggersby.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Hatterene are good partners for Grimmsnarl, as they can all take down Poison-type Pokemon such as Vileplume and Toxapex that Grimmsnarl often struggles with. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can also beat faster wallbreakers such as Barraskewda, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Mamoswine that give Grimmsnarl issues before it sets up, and it can provide Healing Wish support if Grimmsnarl gets worn down. Because Grimmsnarl forces switches frequently, Clefable's ability to set up Stealth Rock for Grimmsnarl allows it to break apart teams more easily. Mimikyu and Grimmsnarl form a good core that can work together to beat Ghost and Psychic teams with their super effective attacks. Mimikyu can also take on Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Gengar that Grimmsnarl struggles with, while it and Togekiss appreciate Grimmsnarl's ability to serve as a status sponge against status inducers such as Galarian Corsola and Seismitoad with Rest.</p> "

Taunt enables Obstagoon to stallbreak defensive Pokemon by disabling their forms of recovery and prevents opposing entry hazards from going up, which Normal usually has trouble removing. Facade and Knock Off hit any non-resistant Pokemon hard after the Guts boost.

Alternatively, Choice Specs Dragapult can wallbreak against paralyzed foes without fear of being revenge-killed. Choice Specs or SubRoost Kyurem KOes or severely weakens walls like Toxapex and Slowbro, and Ground- and Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Nidoking, and Mantine. Dragalge forms a hazard-stacking core with Duraludon and is a specially defensive wall that can take on threats that Duraludon isn't bulky enough to switch into, such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Fini, and Thundurus-T. As Duraludon sets Stealth Rock for the team, Garchomp is now free to use offensively oriented sets such as Choice Scarf and Swords Dance to deal with Steel- and Poison-types Duraludon struggles with, such as Heatran and Toxapex. Latias deals with Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Choice Band Galarian Zapdos, clears entry hazards, and provides Duraludon a second chance to deal with Weavile and Dragapult with Healing Wish. Calm Mind Latios is a niche wallbreaker that eases matchups like Poison and Flying, where Duraludon is of limited use, and is fast enough to compensate for Duraludon's poor Speed. Dragonite provides another immunity to Ground for threats like Mold Breaker Excadrill and can use a variety of sets to support Dragon teams, including Dragon Dance and Defensive.</p> "

Dragon Darts is the main attacking move, allowing Dragapult to OHKO Dragonite and Swift Swim Kingdra at +1 and clean most types late-game, especially Dragon. Phantom Force can remove Ghost-, Psychic-, and Steel-types that resist Dragon Darts such as Aegislash, Tapu Lele, and Excadrill. Substitute allows Dragapult to set up on passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Slowbro without fear of status and circumvents Sucker Punch. Leftovers restores health after Substitute and lets Dragapult attempt to sweep or wallbreak multiple times in a match. Infiltrator stops dual screens and Substitute from blocking its sweep. An Adamant nature gives Dragapult a high chance to OHKO Kyurem and Garchomp without a Dragon Dance boost, and it ensures KOs against threats like Excadrill and Tapu Koko at +1. A Jolly nature may be considered to Speed tie with opposing non-Choice Scarf Dragapult, outspeed Jolly Sand Rush Excadrill at +1, and threaten Spectrier without boosts.</p> <p>Hydreigon is a fantastic teammate for Dragon Dance Dragapult, as it can overwhelm physical walls such as Slowbro, Amoonguss, and Celesteela with Nasty Plot. It also can help Dragapult overwhelm Ghost and Psychic teams while also covering for it's weakness to priority moves such as Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch. Dragapult repays this by covering for Hydreigon's Bug and Fighting weaknesses. Dragalge provides Toxic Spikes and Flip Turn to wear down the opposing team and pivot Dragapult in safely, as well as checking Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Clefable that Dragapult struggles with. Kyurem can remove bulky Flying-, Ground-, and Water-types like Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Tapu Fini with its Choice Specs or SubRoost sets. Garchomp sets Stealth Rock, provides an Electric immunity, and can directly wear down the opposing team for Dragapult. Choice Scarf Latias is a great revenge killer that aids in the Fighting and Poison matchups and can provide Healing Wish support to give Dragapult a second chance to sweep or wallbreak.</p> "

Shadow Ball allows Dragapult to pick off weakened threats such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and clean against types such as Psychic and Flying late-game. U-turn allows Dragapult's teammates to take advantage of the switches it forces, as well as dent Dark-types such as Tyranitar and Zarude that like to switch in on Dragapult. Thunder Wave cripples switch-ins like Celesteela, setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres, and Sucker Punch users such as Cinderace, giving Dragapult's teammates an easier time handling these threats. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to deal with common Substitute users such as Kyurem, Hydreigon, and opposing Dragapult. A Hasty nature with Choice Scarf allows Dragapult to outspeed threats such as Adamant Dragon Dance Dragapult, Zeraora, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Choice Scarf Weavile.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Dragpult lacks the wallbreaking and sweeping prowess of Dragon Dance sets, so wallbreakers such as Kyurem and Hydreigon are greatly appreciated, as are physical setup sweepers like Dragonite, Kyurem, and Garchomp. Hydreigon covers for Dragapult's Ghost and Dark weaknesses and can break down Steel, Psychic, Ghost, and Poison teams by threatening walls such as Ferrothorn, Slowbro, Aegislash, and Toxapex, which Dragapult struggles with. Kyurem can remove bulky Flying-, Water-, and Ground-types such as Mantine, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini with a Choice Specs or SubRoost set. Dragalge provides a special pivot that can sponge attacks from Clefable and Tapu Fini while adding utility with Toxic Spikes. Garchomp is a good wallbreaker and threatens Flying, Poison, and Dragon teams with a Swords Dance set, or it provides Stealth Rock and phazing to wear down the opposing team with a defensive set.

        "description": "<p>With its blistering speed, solid offensive stats, and vast arsenal of moves to choose from, Dragapult serves as a powerful revenge killer and wallbreaker on Dragon teams. Few foes can withstand its Choice Specs-boosted STAB moves in Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball, and those that do are likely to feel threatened by its coverage moves in Thunderbolt and Fire Blast. Thunderbolt can take on foes such as Corviknight and Toxapex, while Fire Blast is great for checking Steel-types like Ferrothorn. Dragapult can also opt to use U-turn over Fire Blast as a means to pivot out of unfavorable matchups, such as against Grimmsnarl and Tyranitar. Infiltrator is often Dragapult's ability of choice in order to bypass Substitute users, though Clear Body also has its merits in preventing Sticky Web from dropping its Speed.</p> <p>Despite being a powerful pressure tool in the face of many Pokemon, Dragapult is rather frail and has a poor defensive typing. Against threatening attackers such as Grimmsnarl and Mimikyu, Duraludon partners well with Dragapult, as it threatens them with Flash Cannon. Conversely, teammates such as Hydreigon and Kommo-o can offensively threaten the various Dark-, Dragon-, Ghost-, and even some Ice-types that would otherwise take advantage of Dragapult's frail nature. Hydreigon especially has a unique dynamic with Dragapult, as the former resists priority that would normally threaten Dragapult such as Shadow Sneak from Aegislash and Sucker Punch from Bisharp, while the latter is immune to the priority that Hydreigon is threatened by, such as Extreme Speed or Vacuum Wave from Lucario. This synergy, when combined with their raw power can dominate Steel teams. Dracovish and Dracozolt use their insane physical prowess and incredible STAB moves to assist Dragapult in creating a terrifying wallbreaking core that is capable of 2HKOing the entire metagame. Noivern assists Dragapult through its ability to remove entry hazards.</p> "

Draco Meteor is its most powerful STAB move and allows it to revenge kill threats such as Choice Scarf Duraludon and Choice Scarf Charizard. Shadow Ball allows Dragapult to revenge kill Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Gengar. Fire Blast lets it hit Steel- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, Alolan Ninetales, and Galarian Darmanitan for super effective damage. U-turn allows Dragapult to pick up momentum when it forces a switch. Clear Body is the preferred ability, as it allows Dragapult to take on Sticky Web teams easier and lets it still revenge kill threats such as Zeraora and Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Alternatively, Infiltrator allows it to hit through Substitutes and screens, making matchups such as Ice easier. The 4 Defense EVs enable Dragapult to always take a +2 Ice Shard from Jolly Cloyster when at full HP.</p> <p>All of Dragapult's teammates appreciate its ability to act as a revenge killer, especially in matchups where Dragon teams can struggle such as against Fairy and Electric teams. Hydreigon can take on Steel-type Pokemon with Fire Blast that Dragapult struggles to break, such as Bisharp and Corviknight, taking some pressure off Dragapult and forming an anti Psychic- and Ghost-type core that deals with Pokemon like Aegislash. Choice Scarf Duraludon forms a speed control core with Dragapult, can set up Stealth Rock, and take on Fairy-type Pokemon such as Grimmsnarl and Togekiss that Dragapult struggles to break. Kommo-o can also set up Stealth Rock and check Tyranitar and Snorlax, Pokemon that would otherwise wall Dragapult's attacks. Defog Noivern can clear hazards for Infiltrator Dragapult. Kommo-o and Noivern can also use Taunt to prevent foes from recovering HP or setting hazards, which is especially useful in matchups against Cloyster. Noivern also forms a U-turn core with Dragapult, being able to generate momentum for the team.

Using coverage along with its STAB attacks, it's able to take advantage of various matchups like Steel, Water, Dragon, and Ground. Fire Blast, Flamethrower, and Thunderbolt hit Steel- and Water-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight, Gyarados, and Toxapex for super effective damage. Fire Blast is preferred in order to deal greater damage against Corviknight, while Flamethrower can be used for the consistency. Infiltrator can be used for Substitute users such as Whimsicott and Hydreigon, while Clear Body is useful against teams that carry Sticky Web. Dragapult should generally try to find opportunities where it can wallbreak with little drawback, which is easy to do with its high Speed.</p> <p>Dragapult pairs well with offensive Pokemon such as Polteageist, Gengar, Mimikyu, and Aegislash to break past shared checks and sweep teams. For example, Mimikyu can work together with Dragapult to beat Dragon, while Polteageist and Dragapult can both pose a huge threat to Water. Choice Scarf Gengar can outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Excadrill that Dragapult dislikes dealing with, and Aegislash appreciates Dragapult's early- to mid-game wallbreaking so that it can try to sweep teams late-game and can cover some of Dragapult's weaknesses using its Steel typing. Dragapult also appreciates defensive Pokemon such as Runerigus, Galarian Corsola, and Sableye. The former two can lay down entry hazards for it to have an easier time wallbreaking and serve as good pivots for Dragapult, while Sableye itself can use Knock Off, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp to soften up opposing teams. Froslass is a useful partner for Dragapult because of its ability to set Spikes, allowing it to wallbreak more efficiently, and its ability to deny opposing hazards with Taunt.</p> "

Draco Meteor is Dragapult's strongest attack that hits a variety of neutral targets hard while also being particularly useful for beating Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Duraludon, and Hydreigon. Shadow Ball hits Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Gengar, Mimikyu, Gardevoir, and Hatterene for super effective damage, making Dragapult great in the Ghost mirror matchup in particular. Fire Blast allows Dragapult to revenge kill Steel-, Ice-, and Grass-type Pokemon such as Excadrill, Weavile, and Venusaur with more ease. U-turn is amazing for grabbing momentum against forced switches or against bulky Pokemon such as Corviknight, Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Toxapex that give Dragapult trouble. Infiltrator is the preferred ability, as it allows Dragapult to revenge kill Substitute users such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon effectively as well as ignoring Aurora Veil and dual screens from Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Grimmsnarl, allowing Dragapult to revenge kill Pokemon with more ease on their respective types. 4 EVs in Defense ensure that it never gets OHKOed by Jolly Cloyster's +2 Ice Shard.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola is an excellent teammate because of its ability to set Stealth Rock as well as serve as a defensive pivot for Dragapult. Stealth Rock is particularly good for putting Pokemon such as Weavile, Choice Scarf Charizard, Alolan Ninetales, and Chandelure in range of Dragapult's attacks as well as breaking Focus Sash against Pokemon such as Cloyster and Dugtrio. Chandelure is a good partner for Dragapult because of its ability to break down bulkier Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash and Corviknight with its strong Fire STAB attacks as well as use Substitute to take on Sucker Punch users such as Bisharp and Shiftry. Choice Specs Gengar and Aegislash are both wallbreakers that can beat bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Toxapex as well as take on Fairy-types like Togekiss and Clefable for Dragapult. Swords Dance Aegislash can also beat Pokemon like Tyranitar and Snorlax for Dragapult. Mimikyu and Dragapult work together to take on Dragon teams effectively with their super effective coverage while Mimikyu can also beat Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Mandibuzz for it. Froslass is a decent teammate on hyper offensive teams because of its ability to use Taunt on Sticky Web setters such as Galvantula and Araquanid that hinder Dragapult's revenge killing capabilities as well as use Spikes to continuously wear down teams in conjunction with Dragapult's ability to force switches and grab momentum with U-turn.</p> "

Dragon Dance allows Dragapult to OHKO threats such as Diggersby and Zeraora and 2HKO Toxapex with Dragon Darts after a single boost as well as outspeed Adamant Excadrill in sand and Kingdra in the rain, and after using Dragon Dance twice, it can outspeed Hawlucha after Unburden. Dragon Darts is its main STAB attack and can severely dent any Pokemon that does not resist it. Phantom Force hits Pokemon that resist Dragon Darts such as Excadrill and Hatterene. Substitute allows Dragapult to avoid status moves from Pokemon such as Toxapex and grants it more opportunities to set up Dragon Dance. Sucker Punch can be used to gain an advantage over opposing Dragon Dance Dragapult and attack before Cinderace's Sucker Punch, Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, and Rillaboom's Grassy Slide. Dragon Fang notably allows Dragon Darts to OHKO offensive Volcarona, but Leftovers is an option that gives Dragapult more opportunities to set up Substitute. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs alongside an Adamant nature allow Dragapult to move as fast and strike hard. 4 Defense EVs allow it to always survive +2 Jolly Cloyster's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola is the best partner Dragon Dance Dragapult can ask for many reasons; the first is its ability to set Stealth Rock up, allowing Dragapult to serve as a setup sweeper more effectively. It can also cripple physical attackers such as Tapu Bulu with Will-O-Wisp alongside Strength Sap, potentially provide Dragapult free turns to set up Dragon Dance through Cursed Body, and serve as a general physical pivot into Pokemon such as Cinderace for Dragapult. Mimikyu forms a physical setup core with Dragapult, as it can take on Dark- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, Urshifu-R, and Terrakion for Dragapult with its STAB and coverage moves in Play Rough and Drain Punch as well as revenge kill Pokemon such as Hatterene under Trick Room thanks to its ability Disguise. Aegislash provides a specially defensive wall that can pivot into Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type attacks such as Duraludon's Draco Meteor, Primarina's Moonblast, and Avalugg's Avalanche thanks to its Steel typing. It can also act as a Choice Specs wallbreaker or physical setup sweeper, allowing it to take on Pokemon like Corviknight and Chansey for Dragapult. Dragapult appreciates Choice Specs Gengar's ability to punch holes in walls such as Mandibuzz, Galarian Weezing, Skarmory, and Tyranitar with its coverage moves. Choice Scarf Gengar, on the other hand, can act as a revenge killer against Pokemon such as Zeraora for unboosted Dragapult. Jellicent can, like Galarian Corsola, cripple physical walls with Strength Sap and Will-O-Wisp while also preventing slower Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex from setting entry hazards with Taunt. Alolan Marowak and Chandelure most simply can break through Steel-type Pokemon for Dragapult. Substitute Chandelure, in particular, can take on Pokemon, such as Bisharp, while Alolan Marowak is a strong Swords Dance attacker able to soften physically defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Braviary for Dragapult to sweep more easily.</p> "

Power Whip deals immediate damage to Water-types such as Urshifu-R, Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Swampert. Taunt shuts down passive foes such as Galarian Corsola and Toxapex by preventing them from using status moves like Strength Sap and Haze. Drain Punch is an alternative over Taunt, hitting Steel- and Dragon-types like Bisharp, Kyurem, and Hydreigon super effectively. Jungle Healing gets rid of status ailments such as burn and Toxic poison while providing Zarude with useful longevity. Chople Berry enables Zarude to survive Fighting-type attacks from many threats such as Choice Scarf Terrakion, Keldeo, and Barraskewda and KO them back with Power Whip. Leftovers is another option over Chople Berry to provide passive recovery, letting Zarude heal off much more damage in conjunction with Jungle Healing. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Zarude to outspeed foes like Mimikyu, Garchomp, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Mandibuzz handles threats such as Scizor and Dragonite for Zarude due to its good bulk and typing allowing it to take multiple Fighting- and Bug-type attacks. It can also get rid of entry hazards for Zarude with Defog and pivot out with U-turn, giving it opportunities to use Bulk Up. Tyranitar's amazing special bulk coupled with Sand Stream allows it to take on threatening special attackers such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Alolan Ninetales. Its Sand Stream and Toxic support can also wear down foes quickly, which Zarude appreciates. Hydreigon is a mandatory wallbreaker for Zarude, as it's able to pressure many physically defensive walls such as Skarmory, Avalugg, and Bewear that give Zarude and the rest of Dark teams trouble. It can also pressure Dragon- and Fire-types such as Dragalge, Kyurem, and Torkoal for Zarude. Drapion can deal with Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu, Clefable, and Alolan Ninetales, which Zarude finds difficult to beat, and provide Toxic Spikes support. Weavile is also a neat revenge killer for Zarude thanks to its Ice typing, taking out Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Latias while picking off weakened foes like Tapu Koko with Ice Shard. It also covers Flying-types like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite.</p> "

U-turn lets Zarude preserve momentum, pivoting out of switch-ins such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Corviknight.</p> <p>Zarude is walled by Flying-types such as Zapdos and Dragonite, so Weavile makes for an excellent teammate, as it deals with these threats with a Choice Band or Swords Dance set. Zarude can lure in and pivot out of bulky walls like Toxapex, Skarmory, Celesteela, Mantine, and Amoonguss, turning them into setup fodder for Pokemon such as Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon. Specially defensive Tyranitar checks special attackers like Blacephalon, Volcarona, and Hatterene and sets Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team. Zarude can pivot Dragon Dance Tyranitar into bulkier Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Kyurem to facilitate its sweep. Mandibuzz checks physical attackers such as Dragonite, Tapu Bulu, and Buzzwole, utilizes Defog to improve Zarude's longevity, and pivots it in safely with U-turn. Drapion deals with Fairy-types such as Clefable and Hatterene, sets Toxic Spikes to wear down types such as Electric and Ice, and absorbs Toxic Spikes for it.</p> <h1>Grass</h1> <p>Zarude is the premier revenge killer and setup sweeper for Grass-type teams. Thanks to its Speed and bulk, it greatly improves the Steel-, Psychic-, and Ghost-type matchups. Its also an excellent late-game cleaner with a Choice Scarf set due to its wide movepool and Speed, only being outsped by a few revenge killers like Choice Scarf Weavile and Blacephalon. However, Choice Scarf Zarude has trouble breaking past physically defensive Pokemon like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn, while Bulk Up Zarude struggles with common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Dragapult. Zarude's coverage also makes it hard to break through some physical walls such as Skarmory and setup sweepers such as Hatterene and Corviknight, which can be threatening for Grass teams.</p> "

Its ability Transistor combined with its gargantuan Speed stat, decent Special Attack, high-power Rising Voltage, and Choice Specs makes Regieleki a formidable wallbreaker that can shred apart teams with no Electric-type immunity; even bulky resistant Pokemon and dedicated special walls like Kyurem and Blissey swiftly get 2HKOed. It does well against types like Fighting, Dark, Psychic, and Ghost that have trouble taking on Electric-type attacks. However, Regieleki suffers from having a very sparse movepool that does not include proper coverage moves to hit Ground-types for decent damage and, as a result, is left walled by Ground-type Pokemon. This forces the Regieleki user to think twice before attacking, since a Ground-type Pokemon could switch into it for free. It also has a horrendous bulk, which makes it prone to being KOed by any decent offensive Pokemon, especially priority users such as Bisharp, Dragonite, Rillaboom, and Crawdaunt. Regieleki faces a ton of overlap for improving matchups, as Electric teams are naturally good against types without immunities. It's a niche choice at best due to this.</p> ",

Thunderbolt is a safe move to use outside of Electric Terrain and also hits non-grounded Pokemon like Latias for good damage. Volt Switch lets it keep up momentum for the team and bring in a teammate against Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Cradily when Electric Terrain is not active. Ancient Power lets Regieleki hit certain Pokemon like Lightning Rod Alolan Marowak for a 2HKO, letting Regieleki beat it on the switch. It is also Regieleki's best attack to hit Landorus-T. Rapid Spin can be used over Ancient Power to compress roles on offensive Electric-type teams. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid Nature makes it as fast as possible, letting it outspeed fast Pokemon like Choice Scarf Latios. Choice Specs boosts Regieleki's decent Special Attack to greater heights, making its attacks harder to tank.</p> <p>Tapu Koko is a crucial teammate, as it provides Regieleki with Electric Terrain, which further boosts the power of its moves—especially Rising Voltage. Tapu Koko can also deal with Dragon- and Dark-type Pokemon for Regieleki such as Garchomp and Hydreigon as well as Ground-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon with Grass Knot. Teammates like Zeraora and Alolan Raichu greatly benefit from Regieleki's wallbreaking capabilities, as it's able to blow past Pokemon that check those two such as defensive Zapdos, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, Blissey, and specially defensive Drapion. In return, Zeraora provides Knock Off support and can use its Choice Band set to form a wallbreaking core with Regieleki. Alolan Raichu, on the other hand, can capitalize on Regieleki's wallbreaking ability to clean teams late-game and take care of Ground-type Pokemon like Gastrodon, Swampert, and Hippowdon with Grass Knot, which Regieleki dislikes facing. Rotom-W and Zapdos provide a good defensive backbone and pair of Ground immunities for Regieleki to rely on while also providing Defog support to keep it healthy and not slowed down by Sticky Web. Defensive Zapdos with Static also checks problematic Pokemon like Grassy Glide Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu for Regieleki and takes care of them with Heat Wave.
