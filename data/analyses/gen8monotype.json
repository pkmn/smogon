        "description": "<p>Shiftry has decent Attack and fairly decent Speed with incredible wallbreaking potential thanks to Swords Dance, Black Glasses, and Dark-type STAB moves and is strictly seen on Sunny Day variant Grass teams. Shiftry is great for Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups and beats common threats such as Dragapult and Indeedee. Substitute is useful for avoiding moves like Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Strength Sap from Pokemon such as Galarian Corsola, Mew, and Toxapex; with Substitute up, Shiftry can get a free Swords Dance and wall break. The combination of Sucker Punch and Substitute makes it difficult for revenge kills from Pokemon like Trace Gardevoir or Gengar to happen. Chlorophyll doubles its Speed, making Shiftry a fiercer wallbreaker to eliminate. Knock Off is useful for inflicting massive damage and removing the item of anything that tries to switch in against it, while Sucker Punch is useful for KOing faster sweepers such as Dragapult and Gengar. Maximum Speed investment allows Shiftry to outspeed Choice Scarf Charizard and Salazzle in sun, and maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature permits Shiftry to reach its full wallbreaking potential.</p> <p>Whimsicott and Virizion are viable options to set up Sunny Day, allowing Shiftry to outspeed Pokemon such as Mew and Jirachi because of Chlorophyll. Whimsicott is a better Sunny Day setter that helps with Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-types thanks to Moonblast; Choice Scarf Virizion is useful for outspeeding threats like Alolan Ninetales, Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and Choice Scarf Charizard and has access to Smart Strike, Stone Edge, and Close Combat, which is useful for the Ice-type matchup. Appletun is one of the only Grass-types that can properly tank Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Dragapult. Venusaur is another Pokemon that takes advantage of sun and can use Life Orb and Growth or Choice Specs and helps in the Fairy- and Steel-type matchup because of Weather Ball and Sludge Bomb. Ferrothorn is one of the best defensive utilities that has access to entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes; it is useful for tanking attacks from offensive Pokemon like Weavile and Cloyster and is very crucial for the Ice-type matchup. Rotom-C cripples Pokemon with Choice Scarf and Trick, which is incredibly useful for against Pokemon such as Corviknight, Mew, and Toxapex. Finally, Celebi gets Stealth Rock, which allows Ferrothorn to run Spikes, and has a number of coverage moves such as Psychic and Earth Power which helps fend off Poison- and Fighting-type Pokemon better.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Venusaur is a great sun sweeper because of its ability Chlorophyll, good Special Attack, and good movepool consisting of moves like Growth and Weather Ball. Weather Ball turns into a Fire-type move in the sun that can take care of Corviknight and Aegislash. Giga Drain is used to enable Venusaur to take care of Water- and Ground-types such as Keldeo, Toxapex, and Gastrodon while giving it a way to recover from Life Orb recoil. Sludge Bomb is used to OHKO Fairy-types such as Togekiss and can take care of Hydreigon and Kyurem-B after a single use of Growth. Growth should be used under sun to turn Venusaur into a dangerous sweeper. Earth Power is a niche option that can be used to hit Poison-type Pokemon such as Salazzle and Drapion. Venusaur should try to set up Growth on a predicted switch or on a passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Toxapex. It should also come in on via a U-turn or Memento from Whimsicott or on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex. A Modest nature allows it to net an OHKO on Aegislash and Corviknight.</p> <p>Whimsiscott is a mandatory teammate because of its access to Prankster Sunny Day and its ability to get Venusaur in safely with U-turn or Memento. Shiftry is a great partner to pair with Venusaur because of its Dark typing and Chlorophyll, allowing it to take care of Psychic-types that Venusaur can struggle with such as Jirachi and Indeedee. Shiftry can also take care of Dragapult with Sucker Punch. Celebi also goes great with Venusaur because it can help pressure Fighting-types such as Bulletproof Kommo-o and use Weather Ball to help Venusaur sweep in the Steel-type matchup. Celebi can also greatly help in the Poison-type matchup with Earth Power and Psychic. Ferrothorn is great to pair with Venusaur due to its access to entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes and ability to come in on Ice-type attacks from Cloyster and Alolan Ninetales and physical attacks such as Dracovish's Psychic Fang. Virizion is a great revenge killer that also deals with threats like Snorlax, Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Centiskorch against Normal-, Dark-, Ice-, and Bug-type matchups respectively. It can also take care of Alolan Ninetales with Smart Strike and act as an emergency Sunny Day settler if Whimsicott gets KOed.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Charizard isn't a great option, as it is outclassed by special attackers like Volcarona, Blacephalon, and Heatran. However, thanks to its great Speed, high Special Attack, and Solar Power with sun support, Charizard makes a below-average Choice Scarf user. It's able to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Dragapult and threaten them with its powerful attacks. Furthermore, Charizard's great Speed combined with its access to Dragon Pulse notably separates it from other Fire-types, as it helps tremendously with the Dragon matchup. However, Charizard faces competition with Blacephalon as a Choice Scarf user. Its Flying typing is beneficial because it grants immunity to Ground-type attacks, but most Ground-types tend to run Rock coverage anyway and it leaves Charizard even more vulnerable to Stealth Rock. Flamethrower is used in situations where Charizard can't afford missing such as against Choice Scarf Excadrill, which can sweep Fire pretty easily without Charizard to revenge kill it. Fire Blast is the more powerful option, best suited when Charizard wants to deal as much damage as possible against bulky Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini. Dragon Pulse is what separates Charizard from other Fire-types, as it muscles past Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Dragalge. Focus Blast hits bulky Pokemon that resist its Fire STAB moves such as Hydreigon, Heatran, and Rhyperior. Solar Beam is an option to hit Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon and Slowbro, but the types these Pokemon are on have weather in rain and sand, respectively, which can make Solar Beam unreliable. Due to how powerful its Fire attacks are under sun, it should either break holes in the opposing team early so its teammates can clean up or be preserved for a late-game sweep. Charizard is also great at revenge killing threats such as Dracozolt and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Torkoal is an amazing teammate because it sets up sun for Charizard with Drought, can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, and can set its own Stealth Rock to chip Pokemon like Dragapult to support Charizard's wallbreaking. Cinderace revenge kills faster Choice Scarf users like Dragapult and Latias with Sucker Punch and also checks special walls like Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Dragalge. Gunk Shot Cinderace, Sludge Bomb Volcanion, and Flash Cannon Heatran are great to check Fairy-types Charizard is threatened by like Azumarill and Tapu Fini. Volcanion absorbs Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Araquanid and checks Ground- and Rock-types like Hippowdon, Rhyperior, and Stakataka with Steam Eruption. Incineroar, Volcarona, and Heatran check Psychic-types like Tapu Lele, Latios, and Galarian Slowking. Incineroar provides momentum with Parting Shot or U-turn and is also a great check for Ghost-types like Spectrier and Dragapult thanks to its Dark typing. Furthermore, Knock Off hinders recovery on Pokemon running Leftovers and Black Sludge like Tapu Fini and Dragalge, respectively, for Charizard. Rotom-H and Victini are nice checks to Water-types like Toxapex and Mantine with their respective Electric coverage.</p>"

It has fantastic coverage options in Psychic to nail Poison-types such as Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Nidoking, Grass Knot to defeat Water-types that are immune to Rising Voltage like Gastrodon, Swampert, and Seismitoad, and Focus Blast for troublesome Dark- and Steel-types like Hydreigon, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn. However, Alolan Raichu's underwhelming Special Attack makes it unable to OHKO walls like Tyranitar in sand, Heatran, and Ferrothorn, even with a Life Orb. Outside of Electric Terrain, Alolan Raichu is outsped by many threats like Spectrier, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Alolan Raichu's very poor bulk makes it unable to come into attacks freely while making it susceptible to priority users like Urshifu-R, Crawdaunt, Dragonite, and Rillaboom.</p>",

Galarian Slowking 2HKOes Alolan Raichu with Sludge Bomb, Blissey can wear it down with Seismic Toss, and Celebi can wear it down with Giga Drain. However, Galarian Slowking and Blissey have to be careful of the rare Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from Life Orb, entry hazards, and Toxic poison wear down Alolan Raichu.</p> <p><strong>Electric-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Since Alolan Raichu relies on Rising Voltage to sweep teams, Electric-resistant Pokemon such as Latias, Latios, and Tapu Bulu are huge threats to it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Barraskewda outspeed and OHKO Alolan Raichu if Electric Terrain is not active. Because Alolan Raichu is extremely frail, priority users such as Urshifu-R, Crawdaunt, Dragonite, and Rillaboom can also take it out with no problem.

Psychic nails Poison-types such as Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Nidoking and hits Electric-resistant foes like Dragapult, Landorus-T, and Thundurus-T for good damage. Focus Blast heavily damages Dark-, Steel-, and Ice-types such as Zarude, Tyranitar, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem. Knock Off is useful for removing Galarian Slowking's Assault Vest, making it much easier to deal with for Electric teams. Grass Knot can be used over Knock Off to super effectively hit Water-types that are immune to Rising Voltage such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad and threaten Ground-types like Hippowdon. Nasty Plot can be used over Knock Off or Grass Knot to make Alolan Raichu a fearsome setup sweeper, taking advantage of Pokemon it forces out such as Pelipper and Amoonguss. However, replacing Grass Knot makes Alolan Raichu less effective in the Water and Ground matchups. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Alolan Raichu outspeed foes like Hydreigon, Volcarona, and Garchomp outside of Electric Terrain.</p> <p>Because of Alolan Raichu's mediocre bulk, it appreciates Volt Switch support from teammates like Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Rotom-W to bring it in safely. Tapu Koko is needed to set Electric Terrain for Alolan Raichu, letting it outspeed extremely fast threats thanks to Surge Surfer. Additionally, Tapu Koko can take on Dragon-types that Alolan Raichu struggles with, like Latias and Latios, thanks to its Dragon immunity and Dazzling Gleam and weaken shared checks such as Galarian Slowking, which Alolan Raichu can capitalize on in the late-game. Zeraora is a fantastic physical wallbreaker, pressuring troublesome specially defensive walls like Blissey and Galarian Slowking. In return, Alolan Raichu can deal with threatening physical walls such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Amoonguss. Choice Specs Zapdos is useful to heavily pressure types like Grass, Ground, and Dragon thanks to its powerful Hurricane, letting it beat foes like Rillaboom, Tapu Bulu, and Garchomp for Alolan Raichu. Rotom-W can remove entry hazards with Defog and deal with foes like Cinderace, Blacephalon, and Barraskewda thanks to its typing. Magnezone's Steel typing lets it handle threats like Dragon Dance Dragapult, Nihilego, and Latias with ease while trapping and taking on problematic Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Excadrill with its Air Balloon set.</p>"

  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<h3>Ground</h3> <p>Nidoking is Ground's best special wallbreaker due to its various coverage moves boosted by Sheer Force and Life Orb, which let it break past physically defensive walls such as Skarmory, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn that are otherwise difficult for the type to break through. Nidoking also helps against types like Fairy, Flying, Steel, and Grass, as they lack sturdy defensive switch-ins to it. Its part-Poison typing provides useful defensive utility by letting it switch in on Fairy-type attacks and remove Toxic Spikes. It is additionally the only way for Ground teams to set Toxic Spikes themselves. However, while Nidoking can pressure many physically defensive walls, its Speed tier leaves it outsped and KOed by a plethora of offensive Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele, Excadrill, and Hydreigon, to name a few. Nidoking's mediocre bulk also makes it difficult to come in on Pokemon that it can deal with but can wear it down, such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu. This frailty also makes it vulnerable even to revenge killers lacking super effective moves such as Spectrier.</p> <h3>Poison</h3> <p>Nidoking is one of the best wallbreakers that Poison has to offer thanks to its powerful combination of Life Orb and Sheer Force. Its role as a wallbreaker is very important in the Steel matchup, as Earth Power + Flamethrower demolishes Steel teams after Heatran's Air Balloon has been popped. Nidoking also offers Poison an Electric immunity to prevent Volt Switch spam from Electric-types like Regieleki and Tapu Koko. Its access to BoltBeam coverage allows Nidoking to apply more pressure on Flying teams, which is nice, since Stealth Rock cannot pressure Flying much because of how often it uses Heavy-Duty Boots. Nidoking is, however, slower than many faster threats like Excadrill, Cinderace, and Keldeo and weak to Water-, Ice-, and Ground-type moves like Scald, Ice Beam, and Earthquake. These flaws mean, Nidoking can only come in on certain passive walls or slower Pokemon like Galarian Weezing, Skarmory, and Toxapex.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>Sludge Wave can be used over Earth Power to 2HKO defensive Pokemon that can tank the rest of Nidoking's moves easily such as Rotom-W and Moltres. However, forgoing Earth Power means Nidoking can't break through Heatran, limiting its effectiveness in the Steel matchup. Fire Blast over Flamethrower notably 2HKOes specially defensive Celesteela, but it is less reliable. Substitute is an option to make Nidoking harder to revenge kill, but it is very hard to fit.</p> <h4>Poison</h4> <p>Sludge Wave can be used to notably hit Clefable, because, otherwise, Nidoking may be at risk of losing its item from Knock Off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Specially defensive walls such as Blissey and defensive Rotom-W can tank multiple hits from Nidoking and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Powerful revenge killers such as Alolan Raichu, Barraskewda, and Spectrier can force out Nidoking easily by threatening an OHKO with their STAB moves. Priority users such as Rillaboom and Mamoswine can outspeed and KO Nidoking with little to no chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves</strong>: Super effective moves from foes faster than Nidoking such as Tapu Lele, Urshifu-R, and Latios can heavily pressure it. Nidoking must also be wary of super effective attacks from slower foes such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Swampert, as it fails to OHKO them.</p> <h4>Poison</h4> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Nidoking does not appreciate its item being removed and it being weakened by Knock Off users like Clefable and Tornadus-T.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Priority moves like Aqua Jet and Ice Shard from Pokemon like Crawdaunt, Azumarill, and Mamoswine can KO Nidoking if their users are running a damage-boosting item like Choice Band or Life Orb, or after some prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Fast Ground-type Pokemon like Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp threaten Nidoking out with Earthquake. They also fear switching into Nidoking, though, since they are at risk of being hit by Ice Beam. Water-types like Keldeo, Urshifu-R, and Barraskewda can KO Nidoking with their Water-type STAB moves but do not always appreciate switching in risking a Thunderbolt. Ice-types like Kyurem, Weavile, and Mamoswine can KO Nidoking with Ice-type moves bar Ice Shard, which requires prior chip damage. However, yet again, they fear switching in, this time due to Earth Power or Flamethrower.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon like Piloswine, Blissey, and Snorlax can sponge all of Nidoking's attacks. Piloswine can KO Nidoking with Earthquake and set Stealth Rock for chip damage, while Blissey and Snorlax can recover from and switch into its moves whenever due to their high bulk. Blissey can set up Stealth Rock and generate momentum with Teleport, while Snorlax can set up Curse and recover off damage with Rest. Slowking can also generate momentum with Teleport or deal chip damage with Scald, while Mandibuzz can remove Nidoking's Life Orb with Knock Off and recover with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Naturally faster threats like both Urshifu formes, Tapu Lele, and Excadrill, and Choice Scarf users like Galarian Darmanitan and Heracross have no problem KOing Nidoking.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Earth Power is the preferred STAB move, as it covers walls such as Heatran, physically defensive Gastrodon, and Tyranitar. Flamethrower provides great coverage against Steel- and Grass-types such as Skarmory, Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu, hitting them for massive damage. Ice Beam nails Flying- and Dragon-types such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Garchomp, as well as potential switch-ins like Landorus-T, Latias, and Hydreigon. It also deals with Cradily better than Earth Power. Thunderbolt hits additional Flying-types that are neutral to Ice Beam such as Mantine, Pelipper, and Celesteela super effectively. Toxic Spikes can be used over Earth Power to support the team and quickly wear down grounded foes such as Porygon2. However, Nidoking's poor bulk gives it limited opportunities to set Toxic Spikes, and Earth Power is needed to break through Heatran. Sheer Force works well in tandem with Life Orb, preventing Nidoking from being worn down by Life Orb recoil and stacking damage boosts. A Timid nature allows Nidoking to outspeed the likes of Tapu Bulu and Heatran.</p> <p>Teammates such as Mamoswine, Landorus-T, and Excadrill appreciate Nidoking's ability to deal with threats like Skarmory and Celesteela. Hippowdon is a good partner, as its Sand Stream and Stealth Rock support wears down foes quickly for Nidoking. Additionally, its good bulk lets it come in on physical attackers such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Garchomp, and Galarian Zapdos. Excadrill breaks through troublesome specially defensive walls such as Blissey and Slowking for Nidoking, beats Psychic- and Ice-types that it struggles against such as Tapu Lele, Alolan Ninetales, and Kyurem, and provides Rapid Spin support. Under Hippowdon's sand, Excadrill can also outspeed a handful of other offensive threats for Nidoking such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Dragapult, and Spectrier. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a Water immunity for Nidoking; Gastrodon's Recover makes it more reliable against threats like Barraskewda, Keldeo, and Tapu Fini, and Seismitoad can check the highly dangerous Azumarill. Mamoswine is a powerful wallbreaker that can revenge kill some faster threats that give Nidoking trouble such as Latias, Dragapult, and Thundurus-T with Ice Shard. Choice Scarf Landorus-T is able to revenge kill additional fast foes such as Spectrier, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona while providing entry hazard removal with Defog. Its Ground immunity is also useful to handle threats such as Excadrill and Garchomp. Bulk Up + Gravity Landorus-T is another option to make Nidoking's Earth Power more spammable while helping in matchups like Poison. Choice Scarf Krookodile can act as a dangerous revenge killer against Ghost- and Psychic-types like Spectrier, Victini, and Latios. Krookodile also provides an immunity against Psychic-type attacks directed at Nidoking.</p>"

It appreciates Flamethrower for consistency to help with Steel-, Bug-, and Grass-types like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Buzzwole, and Tapu Bulu, whereas Fire Blast is nice for picking up more KOs against bulkier Steel-types like Celesteela and Corviknight. Both Earth Power and Flamethrower are needed to deal with Steel's defensive cores members: Aegislash, Heatran, and Celesteela, but, Thunderbolt or Ice Beam is needed to pop Heatran's Air Balloon. Thunderbolt is useful for hitting Water- and Flying-types like Mantine and Slowbro, whereas Ice Beam helps with Ground-, Grass-, and Flying-types like Hippowdon, Appletun, and defensive Zapdos. Stealth Rock allows Nidoking to compress the role of entry hazard setter, but the presence of Heavy-Duty Boots reduces the need for hazards. Maximized Speed EVs allow Nidoking to Speed tie an opposing Nidoking and outpace Diggersby and Togekiss.</p> <p>Nidoking offers the entire team its Electric immunity, but Toxapex appreciates it more than other teammates due to its weakness to Electric. Toxapex's bulk and Scald allow it to switch into physical attackers that threaten Nidoking like Barraskewda and Cinderace while also shutting down setup sweepers like Weavile and Cloyster with Haze. Galarian Weezing provides a Dragon immunity, which is important to switch into a Draco Meteor or Dragon Darts that could KO Nidoking, while also having utilities like Defog to get rid of entry hazards, Will-O-Wisp and Toxic Spikes to spread status, and Pain Split for longevity. Nidoking is weak to Psychic, so adding a Psychic-immune teammate like Skuntank or Drapion helps with Pokemon like Latias, Alakazam, and Tapu Lele. The former has Defog and Sucker Punch to revenge kill Psychic- and Ghost-types like Blacephalon and Alolan Raichu, while the latter has useful utilities like Knock Off, which removes Heavy-Duty Boots and makes Stealth Rock more effective and Whirlwind to phaze setup sweepers like Jirachi and Spectrier. Amoonguss is the best check to Ground-type Pokemon, notably Mold Breaker Excadrill, which threatens Nidoking and most of its teammates with Earthquake. Amoonguss also helps break Steel teams, as it has Spore to give Nidoking opportunities to come in while also forming a Regenerator core with Toxapex; together, they help Nidoking deal with Ground-, Rock-, and Water-type Pokemon like Excadrill, Rhyperior, Terrakion, and Urshifu-R. Nihilego runs Choice Scarf to revenge kill Pokemon like Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Victini and appreciates Nidoking's ability to threaten Steel-types it cannot properly deal with, like Ferrothorn and Aegislash. It has nice coverage moves like Thunderbolt, Dazzling Gleam, Power Gem, and Grass Knot, which improve quite a few matchups like Flying, Dragon, Fire, and Ground. Gengar is an option over Nihilego and supports Drapion or Skuntank in dealing with Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Slowbro with Shadow Ball, and it also deals with bulky Pokemon like Toxapex and Aegislash. Galarian Slowking's ability to sponge Psychic-type attacks that KO Nidoking from Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Latias is appreciated, and it forms a triple Regenerator core with Toxapex and Amoonguss, making Poison teams harder to break.</p>"

Magic Guard is especially useful, as it allows Clefable to serve as a status sponge for the rest of the team against Pokemon such as SubToxic Aegislash and Toxapex. It also means Clefable can come in freely against Spikes when going against types like Grass and Steel. Both these traits are very valuable due to Fairy teams commonly lacking entry hazard removal, making traditional teams susceptible to hazards like the aforementioned Spikes and Toxic Spikes.

Healing Wish can also be used over Knock Off in order to support an offensive teammate later on in the game. However, Knock Off's utility is generally a lot more valuable. Babiri Berry may be considered to take Scizor's Bullet Punch at +2 and Choice Band Excadrill's Iron Head, retaliating with Flamethrower.

Knock Off cancels out passive recovery from various Pokemon like Celesteela, Dragalge, Toxapex, Aegislash, and Tyranitar by removing Leftovers, softening them up for later on in the game, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots users like Mandibuzz and Mantine so that they take damage from Clefable's Stealth Rock.

Stealth Rock is also great in the Electric matchup in particular, as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu can OHKO Choice Specs Zapdos with Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage, and it helps Tapu Koko pressure Flying more easily by chipping down faster checks like the aforementioned Choice Scarf users that try to switch in. In return, Tapu Bulu can provide Clefable with passive recovery with Grassy Terrain, and Tapu Koko can threaten Defoggers like Mantine and Corviknight that may try to remove Clefable's Stealth Rock with Thunderbolt, as Clefable usually cannot threaten them itself. Klefki forms a good hazard stacking core with Clefable and can support its subpar bulk with its dual screens. Mimikyu can check Pokemon such as Hatterene, Aegislash, and Thundurus-T that set up on Clefable due to its passiveness with Disguise. Tapu Lele can beat Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Dragalge for Clefable. Azumarill appreciates Stealth Rock, as it allows it to OHKO Celesteela with more ease after Belly Drum.</p>"

Its ability in Magic Guard stops entry hazards and status from wearing it down. Calm Mind, in conjunction with Soft-Boiled, allows Clefable to accrue several boosts against Pokemon that cannot significantly damage it such as Ferrothorn, SubToxic Aegislash, and SubRoost Kyurem. Thunderbolt deals with Water- and Flying-types such as Mantine, Celesteela, and Volcanion, and it also wears down Haze and Roar users such as Toxapex and Heatran. Flamethrower deals with Steel- and Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Rillaboom. Moonblast can be used to help deal with Dark- and Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Garchomp, and it also wears down Swampert, which can wall Clefable's coverage moves. Moonblast also allows Clefable to threaten Dragon teams, which do not mind Clefable's coverage moves. Life Orb turns Clefable into a fearsome threat, allowing it to consistently 2HKO Toxapex, Celesteela, and Drapion at +1. Magic Guard also nullifies its recoil. Alternatively, Leftovers makes Clefable harder for types such as Grass, Dark, and Water to handle due to its increased longevity. 16 Speed EVs let Clefable outspeed defensive variants of Celesteela, while the remaining EVs maximize its physical bulk to better deal with threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Rillaboom, and Zeraora.</p> <p>Klefki's dual screens make it an ideal partner for Clefable, as these allow Clefable to set up more easily, as well as staying in to damage threats such as Choice Band Excadrill and Rillaboom. Klefki also provides a Poison immunity to come in against threats such as Nihilego, debilitates Clefable answers such as Gengar and Mantine with Thunder Wave and Toxic, and sets Spikes to wear down the opposing team. Tapu Bulu and Clefable both wear down their shared checks in Toxapex, Celesteela, and Melmetal. Tapu Bulu also sets Grassy Terrain to improve Clefable's longevity, deals with Swampert, Clear Smog Gastrodon, and Regieleki for it, and pressures Heatran for Clefable not running Thunderbolt. This allows Clefable to sweep Steel teams late-game. Tapu Lele checks Poison-types like Nidoking and Dragalge, allows Clefable to deal with Scizor by setting Psychic Terrain, and deals with Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Kyurem, especially if Clefable doesn't have Moonblast. Clefable repays this by wearing down Steel-types such as Aegislash and Corviknight, which wall Tapu Lele. Tapu Koko pivots Clefable into passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, is a fast teammate that deals with Urshifu-R, Weavile, and Cinderace, and can deal with Water-types such as Mantine, Slowking, and Toxapex for Clefable not running Thunderbolt. Azumarill appreciates its checks in Mantine, Volcanion, and Ferrothorn being worn down, as this allows it to clean types such as Flying, Fire, and Steel late-game. In return, Azumarill deals with Alolan Marowak, Galarian Slowking, and Nidoking, which Clefable struggles against. Alternatively, Calm Mind Tapu Fini forms a special wallbreaking core with Clefable and relieves it from having to use Moonblast, as Tapu Fini deals with Dragon-, Ground-, and Fire-types such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Heatran. Mimikyu is a Swords Dance sweeper that deals with Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Spectrier, Gengar, and Hatterene. Alolan Ninetales appreciates Clefable's ability to take out Celesteela and Toxapex, as this allows Alolan Ninetales to clean Flying and Water teams late-game, and can also provide support with Grudge.</p>"

Hatterene also can bounce back entry hazards for Alolan Ninetales thanks to Magic Bounce, which also allows it to keep up Aurora Veil against Defog users such as Galarian Weezing and Pelipper. Other teammates such as Gardevoir and Primarina appreciate the Aurora Veil, as it allows them to spam their attacks with little drawback. Gardevoir especially helps Alolan Ninetales, as it can take advantage of opposing weather teams thanks to Trace and its Choice Scarf to revenge kill their sweepers with ease, such as Excadrill and Barraskewda. Clefable is another support Pokemon available to Aurora Veil teams, being able to support them with Thunder Wave and Healing Wish or set up Stealth Rock, allowing its teammates to break through the foe's team with more ease.

Reversal hits extremely hard when Focus Sash is consumed, allowing Dugtrio to do significant damage to Normal- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Obstagoon and Mamoswine. Sucker Punch allows Dugtrio to hit common Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Darmanitan and Dracovish, and common priority users such as Mamoswine. Screech can be used as an alternative to further complement its physical presence, allowing Dugtrio to trap foes more consistently by reducing their Defense.

Hippowdon makes another decent teammate for Dugtrio with its access to Sand Stream and Stealth Rock; the cumulated passive chip damage allows Dugtrio to trap more consistently throughout the match. With its great bulk, Hippowdon can also pivot for Dugtrio after it traps and removes a threat and a revenge killer is sent out by the opponent. Mamoswine is a good offensive teammate with nearly unresisted coverage that allows it to punch many holes in opposing teams; this allows Mamoswine and Dugtrio to complement each other excellently.

Sludge Bomb picks off weakened Fairy- and Grass-types such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Zarude. Focus Blast takes down Steel- and Dark-types, such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Tyranitar. Dazzling Gleam is also a more accurate way to nail Dark-types, and it hits certain ones like Hydreigon and Galarian Moltres better. A Choice Scarf allows it to outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Zarude, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar, making it one of the best revenge killers for Ghost-type teams.</p> <p>Gengar has a unique role in absorbing Toxic Spikes, as Ghost teams don't have reliable entry hazard removal to prevent teammates like Galarian Corsola and Mimikyu from being worn down. Galarian Corsola takes on and burns physical attackers such as Excadrill and Zeraora, and it softens up the opposing team for Gengar by setting Stealth Rock. Bulky foes such as Toxapex and Gastrodon can be pressured by Calm Mind Spectrier, which can also spread burns with Will-O-Wisp, wearing down special walls like Drapion and Celesteela. Swords Dance Aegislash deals with Hatterene and Clefable, and it appreciates Gengar removing fast threats such as Zarude and Hydreigon for it. Mimikyu can beat Sucker Punch users like Bisharp and removes Dark-types such as Galarian Moltres, which pose a threat to Gengar and its teammates. Setting Spikes, Froslass helps wear down Pokemon like Toxapex and Heatran to allow Gengar to sweep late-game. Dragapult can handle troublesome Dragon-types like Kyurem and Garchomp, as well as pressuring Volcarona, which can use Gengar as setup fodder.</p>"

      "Choice Specs (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Gengar is a potent pick as a wallbreaker on Ghost teams thanks to its high Special Attack and Speed stat along with excellent coverage options and a good typing. Sludge Wave threatens Grass- and Fairy-types such as Rillaboom, Togekiss, Primarina, and Clefable. It also massively damages any unresisted foe such as Hydreigon or Indeedee, both of which can otherwise take or ignore Shadow Ball. Focus Blast provides very important coverage against Tyranitar, Diggersby, and Incineroar. Thunderbolt pressures Water-types such as Keldeo and Toxapex, as well as Flying-types such as Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Mantine. Trick can cripple bulky walls such as Chansey, which is otherwise hard to wear down. Gengar's Special Attack and Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature and Choice Specs allow it to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. It's also very frail, so it should be brought in against resisted attacks or predicted switches.</p> <p>Dragapult serves as an efficient late-game cleaner with Dragon Dance, being able to clean teams easily and outspeed almost the entire metagame after a boost. Choice Scarf Dragapult can also be used to revenge kill fast threats such as Zeraora, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Swift Swim Kingdra. Mimikyu is a great late-game cleaner, as its ability Disguise allows it to blanket check many Pokemon and pick off weakened foes in tandem with Swords Dance and Shadow Sneak. Its unique Ghost / Fairy typing also helps it play a crucial role in revenge killing Dark-types for the team. Galarian Corsola provides a defensive backbone for the team thanks to its good bulk, which allows it to annoy physical attackers with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Strength Sap. In addition, its access to Stealth Rock makes Gengar a more consistent wallbreaker. Aegislash is incredibly versatile, as it can be a specially defensive wall with SubToxic, wearing down special attackers such as Jirachi and Celebi, or a Swords Dance wallbreaker. Additionally, it can check other Fairy-types that Choice Specs Gengar has trouble revenge killing, such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Jellicent provides a useful Water immunity for Ghost teams, keeping Dracovish, Keldeo, and Barraskewda in check. Alolan Marowak and SubCM Chandelure are powerful wallbreakers that easily handle Ice, Grass, and Steel teams. Alolan Marowak provides a useful Electric immunity for Ghost teams thanks to its ability Lightning Rod. Chandelure can also punish Sucker Punch users such as Bisharp and Skuntank, which are huge threats to Ghost teams. Froslass acts as a fast Spikes setter on hyper offensive teams that can prevent entry hazards from the opposing team thanks to Taunt.</p>"

It is particularly useful against threats with priority like Mimikyu and Bisharp. Drapion is able to switch into the super effective Psychic-, Dark-, and Ghost-type attacks that are used against Gengar. Roserade helps it handle Ground-type Pokemon while also setting Spikes, which makes Gengar's late-game cleaning easier. Toxtricity can bring Gengar in with Volt Switch and beat Pokemon like Corviknight and Toxapex that would otherwise come in and wall Gengar. Toxicroak breaks the special walls, like Snorlax, that would otherwise hinder Gengar's sweep. Galarian Weezing provides a Ground immunity and can remove entry hazards with Defog, allowing Gengar to come in more freely during the game. Moreover, it serves as another Dark-resistant teammate to support Gengar. Vileplume helps Gengar by checking Excadrill, which greatly threatens Poison-type teams. Salazzle also aids Gengar by threatening Steel-type teams and withering down other types with a Substitute + Toxic set.</p>"

Its low HP stat makes Pain Split a form of semi-reliable recovery. Its part-Poison typing provides a neutrality to Poison-type attacks, allowing it to switch into attacks such as Drapion's Poison Jab and excel in the Fairy matchup. Nonetheless, its special bulk is not great, allowing many special attackers to take advantage of it such as Spectrier, Kyurem, and Volcarona. Additionally, its low Speed means that many Taunt users such as Tornadus-T, Cobalion, Corviknight, and Mew outspeed it and prevent it from using its utility moves, nearly shutting it down.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Galarian Weezing has found its place on Fairy teams as a physically defensive pivot that sets Toxic Spikes for the team and absorbs them while being able to neutralize physical attackers such as Diggersby and Azumarill with Will-O-Wisp. Neutralizing Gas allows it to hinder Pokemon that rely on their abilities to function well, nullifying Crawdaunt's Adaptability, Jirachi's Serene Grace to reduce its flinch chance, and even Hatterene's Magic Bounce to set up Toxic Spikes. Additionally, its ability nullifies Levitate, making Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Hydreigon vulnerable to its Toxic Spikes. Finally, Neutralizing Gas also allows Galarian Weezing to prevent Regenerator users such as Amoonguss and Toxapex from healing by switching out, allowing Fairy teams to make significant progress against Poison teams. Sludge Bomb allows it to target Pokemon such as Azumarill as well as poison walls such as Mantine and Mandibuzz. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Diggersby and Zeraora. Toxic Spikes cripples foes such as Dragapult and Urshifu-R, allowing its teammates like Azumarill, Mimikyu, and Togekiss to sweep easily. Pain Split allows Galarian Weezing to regain health throughout the match and wear down the foe. Black Sludge is especially useful due to Pain Split not always being reliable. Maximum HP and Defense EVs alongside a Bold nature make Galarian Weezing as physically bulky as possible, allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Zeraora and Diggersby.</p> <p>All of Galarian Weezing's offensive teammates appreciate its ability to set up Toxic Spikes, which allows them to break through Pokemon such as Swampert and Porygon2. Galarian Weezing can also help teammates set up more easily by crippling physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. Its secondary Poison typing also allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes for its teammates. Tapu Lele can take on Poison-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss with Psychic for Galarian Weezing. Additionally, it can threaten a majority of Defog users with Thunderbolt and Moonblast, like Mantine and Mandibuzz. Tapu Bulu can take on and pressure Ground- and Water-type Pokemon like Garchomp, Swampert, and Urshifu-R. Tapu Koko can deal with Flying-type Pokemon such as Celesteela. Additionally, Tapu Koko can provide Taunt utility to prevent Defog users such as Zapdos from removing Galarian Weezing's Toxic Spikes. Mimikyu can take on Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten Galarian Weezing like Tapu Lele and Alakazam with its Ghost-type STAB moves. Azumarill sets up with Belly Drum to break past bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Chansey. Azumarill can also threaten Ground-type Pokemon such as Excadrill for Galarian Weezing. Choice Scarf Alolan Ninetales can take on Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T with Blizzard. Klefki can form a hazard-stacking core with Galarian Weezing by setting Spikes and can set dual screens to allow Galarian Weezing to tank attacks more easily.</p>"

Having a Defog user is especially important for Poison as a balance type because it prevents teams from being overwhelmed by Spikes. Galarian Weezing also helps against opposing Terrain, allowing teammates like Skuntank to use priority without Psychic Terrain and helping other revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gengar and Choice Scarf Drapion to beat Alolan Raichu by overriding its Electric Terrain. Seeing as Poison teams are typically weak to Ground-type Pokemon such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Choice Band Mamoswine, and Diggersby, Levitate is extremely crucial. Furthermore, Galarian Weezing's Fairy typing allows it to switch into Dark- and Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Dragapult and beat them in return with Strange Steam. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers such as Mimikyu and Tyranitar. A physically defensive spread is used to more easily check massive threats in Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance Garchomp. Clear Smog or Flamethrower can be used over Defog if the team has Skuntank to fill the Defog role. The former prevents setup sweepers from setting up on Galarian Weezing for free, and the latter hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Seeing as it relies on Pain Split for recovery, Galarian Weezing should be carefully preserved throughout a match in order to switch into Ground-type attacks as well as Defog away hazards. This means it should avoid switching into strong attacks such as Pelipper's Hurricane and Heliolisk's Thunderbolt.</p> <p>The entire Poison team appreciates Galarian Weezing's Ground immunity. Salazzle is one of the best partners for Galarian Weezing, as it can beat Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Bisharp, and Corviknight. Toxapex, Vileplume, and Drapion form a good defensive core with Galarian Weezing. Toxapex can switch into a myriad of attacks such as Bisharp's Iron Head and Aegislash's Flash Cannon, as well as neuter setup sweepers with Haze and scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Galarian Darmanitan. Vileplume can switch into Mold Breaker Excadrill's Earthquake and remove pressure by checking Ground-type Pokemon with its defensive typing, Giga Drain, and Strength Sap. Skuntank provides a crucial Psychic immunity, meaning it can switch into and pick off Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Alolan Raichu, and Indeedee with Sucker Punch. Skuntank can also run Defog, freeing up Galarian Weezing to run Clear Smog or Flamethrower. Other offensive Pokemon such as Toxitricity and Gengar are able to beat faster threats such as Pelipper, Corviknight, and Obstagoon that Galarian Weezing struggles against.</p>"

One of these forms of utility is its access to Stealth Rock, which can allow it to assist its teammates by chipping down opposing threats, making it easier to revenge kill them. Seismic Toss allows Chansey to not be completely passive, which lets it wear down opposing special attackers very quickly and break most Substitutes. These two moves paired with the amazing recovery of Soft-Boiled allow Chansey to wear down types that rely on their special attackers, namely Electric, Poison, and Psychic. Teleport can be used on its last slot to help Chansey act as a great pivot and get its offensive teammates in safely, or it can use Toxic to put opposing offensive Pokemon on a timer and make it harder for your opponent to keep them in. Its ability in Natural Cure also allows it to absorb status ailments for its offensive teammates and works well with Teleport when scouting for status moves. Chansey invests its EVs in bulk and Defense so that it can take physical hits better, especially from weaker revenge killers like Choice Scarf Excadrill.</p> <p>Every other Pokemon on Normal appreciates Chansey's ability to wall special attackers like Hydreigon, Indeedee-M, and Hatterene. Offensive Pokemon like Indeedee-M, Diggersby, Bewear, Obstagoon, and Heliolisk especially appreciate its Teleport support, as they can immediately threaten the opposing team with their dangerous power once switched in. Indeedee-M can force out dangerous Fighting-types like Conkeldurr and Keldeo with a Choice Scarf while also breaking down opposing walls like Toxapex and Amoonguss thanks to Expanding Force's power. Diggersby, Obstagoon, and Bewear coming in for free can also be a huge boon against opposing bulky teams, as they give most defensive cores in the game a very hard time. Heliolisk also appreciates Teleport pivoting greatly, as it can threaten to KO Keldeo, which is a massive threat to Chansey thanks to its Secret Sword and also has a great matchup against opposing Water-type teams. Outside of Teleport, Porygon2 is Chansey's preferred partner thanks to its ability to wear down physical attackers and complete the Eviolite defensive core. This physical wall appreciates Chansey's ability to wear down special attackers that threaten Porygon2, and in return it walls the physical attackers like Mimikyu that threaten Chansey. Ditto is also a great Pokemon on Normal that can beat out certain setup sweepers or wallbreakers that try to take advantage of Chansey's passive nature, such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar and Shell Smash Cloyster.</p>"

After a Dragon Dance, Gyarados OHKOes almost every Water-type with Power Whip and can beat Toxapex one-on-one. Because Water teams are typically good at setting Stealth Rock against Flying, it is important to give Gyarados Heavy-Duty Boots in order to make sure it is as healthy as possible when attempting to sweep. While often used to handle Water, Gyarados is effective in other matchups too; for example, Ground teams have no defensive answer to the perfect Water + Grass coverage that Gyarados uses. While Gyarados is very powerful against Fire teams, keep in mind that sun halves Waterfall's damage output, it will find much more success if Torkoal is either removed or weakened before attempting to sweep. Intimidate is preferred in order to give Gyarados more opportunities to set up, as the matchups it is most effective in only require a single Attack boost, but Moxie is another option to make sweeping slightly easier if Gyarados can find a KO.</p> <p>Gyarados is fairly self-sufficient in its particular matchups and doesn't rely on its teammates for too much. However, Xatu's dual screens make it much easier to set up. Gyarados fits best on teams that use one or two Pokemon to cover each matchup, so Pokemon like Corviknight that are extremely effective against types, such as Steel, that it struggles with are especially useful. While Gyarados does not require Defog support, Mandibuzz can still act as a support Pokemon with its slow U-turn to bring it in safely on setup fodder. Because Gyarados is almost entirely walled by Grass-types, it is essential to have a very solid answer that can counter them, such as Charizard or Togekiss.</p>"

Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Gyarados from being hindered from Stealth Rock, as Water-type teams do not run entry hazard removal.</p> <p>Gyarados is unable to set up against Pokemon with Electric- or Rock-type coverage, which makes Seismitoad an excellent partner. In exchange, Gyarados is able to remove its Grass-type threats.

The two also have the advantage of eliminating Ice-types with Freeze-Dry, which otherwise prevent Gyarados from setting up, like Lapras. Toxapex is a great partner, as it can take hits for Gyarados and cripple the foe with status such as burn or poison.

Thick Fat makes Snorlax a valuable asset for Normal teams, allowing it to check Fire- and Ice-types such as Chandelure and Galarian Darmanitan, which Normal teams otherwise struggle to switch into.

Magnezone's defensive typing is also notable to take on Ice- and Rock-type attacks from the likes of Weavile and Tyranitar as well as Dragon Dance Dragapult. Alolan Raichu's Knock Off removes Galarian Slowking's Assault Vest in the matchup against Poison teams, allowing Zapdos to 2HKO the entire team with Hurricane. Zeraora is a physical wallbreaker that beats Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Tyranitar, and Blissey for Zapdos; in return, Zapdos deals with physical walls like Amoonguss and Hippowdon for Zeraora. Tapu Koko forms a good wallbreaking core with Zapdos that is very good against types like Ground, Water, and Dragon.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Flying</h3> <p>Galarian Zapdos stands out as a good wallbreaker for Flying teams thanks to its good Attack stat, excellent coverage, and part-Fighting typing, which allows it to help against matchups such as Dark, Steel, and Normal. Close Combat, Brave Bird, and Blaze Kick or Stomping Tantrum hit almost the entire metagame for neutral damage, and it is able to pivot against checks like Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Zapdos with U-turn. Defiant is useful to pressure Defoggers such as Mandibuzz, Galarian Weezing, and Corviknight, preventing them from removing entry hazards off the field. It also takes advantage of Intimidate from Landorus-T, becoming almost unwallable after an Attack boost. However, Galarian Zapdos is outsped and revenge killed by many threats such as Weavile, Blacephalon, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Spectrier due to its only average Speed stat. While Galarian Zapdos is good at wallbreaking, it can easily be worn down in a match through Brave Bird recoil and Stealth Rock damage. Each of its moves can be easy to switch into, meaning that Steel-type core of Aegislash + Heatran + Celesteela can deal with it if they predict correctly. Lastly, using Galarian Zapdos comes at the cost of not being able to run Zapdos.</p> <h3>Fighting</h3> <p>Galarian Zapdos's high Attack stat combined with its excellent STAB combination and a great ability in Defiant allows it to act as a fearsome wallbreaker on Fighting-type teams. Its typing allows it to help in the Bug-, Fighting-, and Grass-type matchups, notably checking Pokemon such as Buzzwole and Rillaboom. Its STAB combination allows to hit a large portion of the metagame for neutral or super effective damage, while U-turn pivots out of tough matchups and maintains momentum. However, its reliance on Brave Bird to beat troublesome Pokemon such as Toxapex and Galarian Weezing wears it down quickly, thus affecting its wallbreaking potential. Despite its fine Speed tier allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Mimikyu and Nidoking while Speed tying with Pokemon such as Choice Band Victini, it can be easily revenge killed by faster threats such as Alolan Ninetales, Tornadus-T, and Zeraora or Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Darmanitan and Tapu Lele.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p>Choice Scarf lets Galarian Zapdos outspeed fast foes like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Zeraora, and Dragapult; however, it loses a significant amount of damage output without Choice Band, limiting its role as a wallbreaker. A Substitute + Bulk Up set may also be used to let Galarian Zapdos set up on foes like Ferrothorn, Mandibuzz, and Amoonguss and become more dangerous in matchups such as Dark and Steel.</p> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be used to outspeed foes such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Keldeo, and Alakazam, but Fighting teams already have access to better Choice Scarf users in Terrakion and Buzzwole, the former having a higher Speed tier and the latter being able to boost its Attack stat with Beast Boost. A Bulk Up set alongside Substitute or Agility with Thunderous Kick and Brave Bird can be utilized, but Choice Band's immediate power is preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Slowbro, Galarian Corsola, and Skarmory can deal with Galarian Zapdos and take advantage of it being Choice-locked into one of its STAB moves. Slowbro can burn it with Scald and force it out with Future Sight, Galarian Corsola cripples it with Will-O-Wisp and Strength Sap, and Skarmory can phaze it with Whirlwind. However, Slowbro can be 2HKOed by Brave Bird, Galarian Corsola can be 2HKOed by Brave Bird after minor chip damage, and Skarmory fears switching into Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Victini, Alolan Raichu, and Spectrier outspeed and threaten Galarian Zapdos with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Stealth Rock wears down Galarian Zapdos every time it switches in, making it unable to wallbreak more consistently. Galarian Zapdos is also significantly worn down by Brave Bird recoil, making it unable to spam the move freely.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn limits Galarian Zapdos's wallbreaking, Toxic puts it on a timer, and paralysis leaves it outsped by slower foes like Hydreigon, Nidoking, and Kyurem.</p> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Galarian Zapdos is prone to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Alakazam, and Choice Scarf Darmanitan; however, they can't directly switch into Galarian Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Galarian Zapdos is pretty vulnerable to status effects, with burn greatly lowering its damage, paralysis making it easy to revenge kill, and poison further hurting its longevity.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash</strong>: Aegislash can be tough to break past for Galarian Zapdos, as it can easily come in on its STAB moves. Aegislash can scout for its moves with King's Shield and can also badly poison it with Toxic. However, it has to be careful of Galarian Zapdos locked into Blaze Kick, as Defiant can give it an Attack boost if Aegislash uses King's Shield. Galarian Corsola on Ghost-type teams and Heatran on Steel-type teams can help Aegislash against Blaze Kick.</p>",

Both of these moves can be very hard to switch into, as even physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Clefable, and Skarmory get 2HKOed. Blaze Kick is mainly used to hit Aegislash, which otherwise completely walls Galarian Zapdos. Stomping Tantrum can be used as a more powerful alternative to hit both Aegislash and Heatran super effectively, but it risks being Choice-locked against Skarmory and Celesteela. U-turn lets Galarian Zapdos pivot against checks such as Slowbro and Galarian Corsola and bring in a teammate to deal with them. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Galarian Zapdos to outspeed threats like Hydreigon, Kyurem, Mimikyu, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Landorus-T is an invaluable teammate, as it switches into Electric-type attacks from foes like Zeraora and Tapu Koko, provides Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and U-turn support, and can revenge kill foes like Dragapult and Spectrier with Choice Scarf. Stealth Rock is especially useful to wear down foes and give Galarian Zapdos opportunities to gain Defiant boosts because of Defog. In return, Galarian Zapdos can pressure walls that give Landorus-T trouble such as Celesteela, Galarian Weezing, and Swampert, as well as Defoggers like Corviknight and Mandibuzz thanks to Defiant. Celesteela or Corviknight can be used to provide a switch-in against Psychic-, Ice-, and Fairy-type attacks from foes like Latias, Kyurem, and Alolan Ninetales. Skarmory can also be used as an excellent physically defensive wall, shutting down threatening physical attackers such as Weavile, Mamoswine, and Urshifu-R more easily. In addition, it provides Spikes support, making Galarian Zapdos more difficult to switch into. Mantine provides a useful Water immunity, handling threats that can overpower Galarian Zapdos like Barraskewda and Kingdra. Thundurus-T is also a useful way to deal with Water teams, as it can defeat the entirety of it with Thunderbolt + Grass Knot while being hard to stop after a Nasty Plot and Agility boost. Galarian Moltres is a great tool against Psychic, Ghost, and Poison teams, notably dealing with answers to Galarian Zapdos such as Slowbro, Galarian Corsola, and Galarian Weezing. Tornadus-T is a great offensive pivot that can bring in Galarian Zapdos safely with U-turn while helping against types like Psychic and Ghost thanks to Knock Off.</p>"

STAB Close Combat complements Brave Bird nicely, helping it hit Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon like Celesteela, Jirachi, and Tyranitar. Thunderous Kick can be used over Close Combat to avoid Defense drops and deal with physical walls like Klefki and Mandibuzz a bit better. U-turn helps Galarian Zapdos pivot out of tough matchups or pick off weakened Pokemon while maintaining momentum alongside Pokemon like Volt Switch Cobalion and Flip Turn Keldeo. Blaze Kick acts as coverage to hit Pokemon like Aegislash and Zapdos better. Defiant is a great ability that allows it to punish Intimidate and Defog users such as Landorus-T and Galarian Weezing, respectively. Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature helps Galarian Zapdos outspeed threats such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele, non-Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, and Mimikyu, while maximum Attack investment along with Choice Band makes it a fearsome wallbreaker.</p> <p>Galarian Zapdos does a great job at weakening teams for cleaners such as Buzzwole and Terrakion. It should avoid directly switching into walls, as they could inflict status conditions that greatly harm its wallbreaking potential, or into most attacks, which can hurt its longevity when combined with Brave Bird recoil. Fighting teams appreciate its ability to switch into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks like Close Combat and Earthquake from Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Excadrill, respectively. Cobalion acts as a great partner for Galarian Zapdos with its ability to switch into Fairy- and Ice-type attacks, provide Stealth Rock support, and provide Thunder Wave support so it can outspeed threats like Dragapult, Latios, and Tornadus-T. It can also bring Galarian Zapdos in with Volt Switch, and, in return, it appreciates Galarian Zapdos switching into Fighting- and Ground-type attacks. Keldeo can help Galarian Zapdos in dealing with physical walls like Hippowdon and Skarmory a bit better, and it appreciates Galarian Zapdos's ability to deal with special walls such as Blissey and Slowking. Choice Scarf Terrakion can clean through teams weakened by Galarian Zapdos and also helps in dealing with Flying-types such as Zapdos and Tornadus-T, which would otherwise trouble Galarian Zapdos, or weakening shared checks with a Swords Dance set. Choice Scarf Buzzwole can clean through teams weakened by Galarian Zapdos thanks to Beast Boost while also having Earthquake and Leech Life to beat Electric- and Psychic-types like Zeraora and Choice Specs Latios. Hawlucha can be used alongside Galarian Zapdos for dual Flying-type STAB move spam.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Dragon</h3> <p>Dragonite is a powerful wallbreaker and setup sweeper thanks to its high Attack stat and access to Dragon Dance. Its Multiscale ability paired with Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to check many Pokemon, since it can withstand nearly any attack from full HP. It has solid coverage options in Earthquake and Fire Punch to hit Pokemon such as Heatran and Celesteela, respectively, and access to a strong priority move in Extreme Speed to pick off weakened foes. However, Extreme Speed can't fully compensate for Dragonite's mediocre Speed even after setting up. At +1, it is left outsped by fast Pokemon such as Zeraora and Dragapult if running an Adamant nature, and many Choice Scarf users even with Jolly. Once it has revealed its moveset, it becomes easier to check, as, if it's lacking Earthquake, it gets walled by Heatran and neutered by Haze Toxapex, whereas without Fire Punch it can't touch Pokemon such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Dragonite may also struggle to find safe opportunities to switch in because it risks getting its Multiscale broken.</p> <h3>Flying</h3> <p>Multiscale allows Dragonite to tank most unboosted hits from full health, and Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it from getting chipped by Stealth Rock; this endurance makes Dragonite a fearsome setup sweeper. Extreme Speed allows it to revenge kill faster offensive threats to Flying-type teams, such as Alolan Raichu and Kingdra. Flying-type teams also appreciate its part-Dragon typing, which gives it many notable resistances, including Water and Fire against Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Volcarona, and Victini. It also gives a neutrality to Electric. However, Dragonite has very limited opportunities to safely switch into the field due to the risk of breaking Multiscale. It is susceptible to status conditions such as burn and poison, which easily break Multiscale. Dragonite also struggles with breaking through walls such as Slowbro, Galarian Weezing, and Galarian Corsola, as they can threaten to burn it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Dragon</h4> <p>Dragonite can use a Choice Band set for immediate power and a fourth coverage move; however, without Heavy-Duty Boots, Dragonite can't preserve its Multiscale if Stealth Rock is up and, as a result, loses a lot of utility.</p> <h4>Flying</h4> <p>Choice Band is an alternative set that gives immediate power; however, this leaves Dragonite and Multiscale susceptible to Stealth Rock. Roost over Extreme Speed or a coverage move is another plausible set, but the trade results in less damage output and potency overall. An Adamant nature can be opted for on sets that utilize Fire Punch over Earthquake, as outspeeding Tapu Koko after a Dragon Dance boost is no longer necessary.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Dragon</h4> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Due to Dragonite's 4x weakness to Ice, Pokemon that carry Ice-type coverage pose huge threats to it, and STAB Ice-type attacks can sometimes even OHKO it through Multiscale.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Dragonite doesn't run any coverage for Fairy-types, so naturally it has a hard time dealing with Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing and Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Dragonite hates getting inflicted with any status because it severely hinders its sweeping capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Dragonite may struggle getting past many physical walls such as Hippowdon, Galarian Corsola, and Mandibuzz because they're bulky enough to take a boosted attack and threaten it in various ways.</p> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Dragonite is susceptible to being burned or poisoned, since the former halves its Attack and both break its Multiscale, making it harder to set up.

Extreme Speed allows Dragonite to pick off weakened Pokemon without taking damage and deal with fast threats such as Weavile and Tapu Koko.

Thundurus-T is a complementary setup sweeper to Dragonite, since it can deal with foes such as Tapu Fini, but it can also act as a reliable revenge killer and great offensive pivot when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Zapdos can Pressure stall and reliably pivot to eventually put bulkier foes such as Slowking in a weakened position. Choice Specs Zapdos and Dragonite deal with each other's threats well.

Taunt denies defensive counterplay in the form of Toxic, Whirlwind, and Haze from users such as Aegislash, Hippowdon, and Toxapex, respectively; it also prevents bulky setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Corviknight and Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Clefable from boosting alongside Mew. On the other hand, Body Press lets Mew KO Dark-types such as Bisharp, Hydreigon, and Weavile without as much help from its teammates. Weakness Policy takes advantage of the opposing team's need to strike Mew with super effective moves to take it down before it has accumulated Cosmic Power boosts, allowing it to OHKO Zeraora if it uses Knock Off on Mew after a Cosmic Power, and takes advantage of Mew's weakness to U-turn, which is commonly used by pivots such as Landorus-T and Corviknight.

Fire Blast is extremely important, as it allows Mew to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight, Aegislash, and Bisharp for super effective damage, therefore making it amazing in the Steel matchup when set up. Focus Blast is used to check Steel- and Dark-types like Heatran and Tyranitar. Thunderbolt hits Water- and Flying-types like Crawdaunt, Mantine, and Celesteela. A Colbur Berry allows Mew to take Bisharp's Sucker Punch while helping with other Dark-type attacks. Generally, Mew should find passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight to set up on and force out with its attacks.</p> <p>Stealth Rock is particularly notable for securing the OHKO on Corviknight at +2 with Fire Blast, as well as breaking Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Cloyster that could otherwise stop Mew. Tapu Lele is a strong wallbreaker that can set Psychic Terrain for Mew, protecting it from priority and boosting its Psychic, while Hatterene can keep entry hazards off the field with Magic Bounce. Trick users such as Victini, Latias, and Jirachi can lure and debilitate defensive walls, such as Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and Mantine.</p>"

Brave Bird is Crobat's primary STAB move and allows it to hit foes such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos, Tapu Bulu, and Tornadus-T, which Poison struggles to deal with long-term. Toxic is great on Crobat, as it allows Poison to make progress against Pokemon it struggles to break through such as Landorus-T, Mantine, and Kyurem. Additionally, paired with Infiltrator, it allows Crobat to use Toxic against prominent Substitute users such as Bulk Up Landorus-T, SubRoost Kyurem, and Nasty Plot Hydreigon. Defog allows Crobat to keep entry hazards off the field, allowing its slower defensive teammates such as Amoonguss and Galarian Slowking to remain healthy throughout the course of the battle. 184 Speed EVs allow Crobat to outspeed Tornadus-T, which lets Crobat catch it with a Toxic or Brave Bird, while the rest of the EVs are put into HP and Special Defense so Crobat can get off a Toxic on SubRoost Kyurem.</p> <p>Amoonguss appreciates Crobat's Defog, as it can continuously regenerate health with Regenerator and doesn't have to worry about being overwhelmed when helping Crobat by switching into physical attackers Poison struggles with such as Garchomp and Zeraora. Nidoking serves as an excellent teammate, as it also appreciates Crobat's entry hazard removal and deals with Steel- and Electric-types that Crobat can't do anything to such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Koko. Drapion and Skuntank are both very helpful to Crobat and Poison in general, as they provide a mandatory Psychic immunity, being able to switch into the likes of Hatterene and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Galarian Slowking is a secondary switch-in to Psychic-type moves from Latios and Jirachi; it also deals with special attackers such as Alolan Ninetales and Heatran and can combat Kyurem by itself after Crobat has poisoned it. Toxapex finds itself supporting Poison teams by dealing with setup users such as Swords Dance Weavile, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Swords Dance Aegislash with Haze. Finally, Nihilego helps defeat Galarian Moltres, as it is able to take both of its attacks and threaten it with Power Gem.</p>"

What sets Lanturn apart from the other Electric-immune Pokemon like Swampert is the fact that it is able to check Pokemon that would otherwise threaten the aforementioned foes, such as Grass Knot Thundurus-T and Choice Specs Zapdos. Volt Absorb helps out tremendously in the Electric matchup and against teams that utilize Volt Switch. Volt Absorb can also be used as a form of recovery with correct prediction. Volt Switch allows Lanturn to pivot out and gain momentum. Toxic wears down foes such as Swampert and Thundurus-T, which Lanturn is otherwise helpless against. Heal Bell helps prevent Lanturn and its teammates from being worn down by Toxic users such as Toxapex. Protect allows Lanturn to gain some health back using Leftovers, accumulate Toxic damage, and scout Choice-locked foes such as Landorus-T.</p> <p>An Electric-immune Pokemon is useful to practically every Pokemon on a Water team that is not immune to Electric. While Lanturn's main niche historically has been on defensive Water teams, it can be used on other kinds of teams, such as balanced or offensive ones. Pelipper makes for an ideal partner for Lanturn, as it has an immunity to Ground-type moves and can switch into strong physical attacks that otherwise threaten Lanturn. In return, Lanturn can help preserve Pelipper with its immunity to Electric-type moves. Toxapex makes for an ideal partner for Lanturn, as it can deal with Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Water teams, such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu, and can remove Toxic Spikes. Lanturn's Volt Absorb synergizes well with Mantine, as it allows for an easy switch-in to Mantine's quadruple Electric weakness, while Mantine is immune to Ground-type moves that are super effective against Lanturn. Mantine can also remove entry hazards with Defog, allowing Lanturn to switch into Electric-types with more ease. Other Electric-immune teammates, such as Swampert and Quagsire, are ideal, as they can take on Pokemon that threaten Lanturn's weak Defense stat, such as Zeraora. Sap Sipper Azumarill makes for an ideal partner on stall Water teams, as it provides Lanturn with a Grass immunity and pressures Nasty Plot Hydreigon. Slowking can switch into special attacking Pokemon that threaten Lanturn, such as Nidoking, Substitute + Roost Kyurem, and Tapu Lele. Crawdaunt can benefit from Lanturn's ability to wear foes down, as Lanturn allows it to have an easier time to pull off a late-game sweep against types like Poison, Dark, and Steel. Suicune can also function well when paired with Lanturn thanks to Suicune's ability to sweep late-game. Tapu Fini can prevent Lanturn from being poisoned with Misty Surge, and Calm Mind sets can check Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Kommo-o for Lanturn. Urshifu-R is a tremendous wallbreaker that can take care of bulky Pokemon that threaten Lanturn, such as Excadrill, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Kyurem. Lanturn can also bring Urshifu-R in safely via Volt Switch. Lanturn pairs well with offensive Pokemon such as Barraskewda, as they make up for Lanturn's passivity, and Lanturn's Volt Switch can be used to bring in these Pokemon safely.</p>"

U-turn allows it to switch into the desired teammate after setting up dual screens without losing much momentum for the team. Xatu should be preserved, as Magic Bounce is crucial for Flying-type teams and its Speed tier lets it repeatedly set up dual screens throughout the game.

It can also damage Steel-types like Melmetal and Ferrothorn with Superpower. Due to its low stats and reliance on Aqua Jet, Azumarill gets revenge killed easily by any Pokemon that doesn't mind Aqua Jet, like Zarude or Tapu Lele. Its Speed leaves it slower than some defensive Pokemon like Rotom-W and Mew, letting them burn or cripple Azumarill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>Azumarill can run a Jolly nature to outrun Pokemon like Adamant Azumarill and Rotom-W.

Unlike other setup sweepers, Azumarill usually only has one chance to set up, since it costs half of Azumarill's health.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All status conditions greatly hamper Azumarill's ability to make progress. A burn renders its attacks much weaker, paralysis lets Pokemon like Melmetal outrun it, and being poisoned forces Azumarill to take even more residual damage on top of entry hazards and often Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killlers</strong>: Pokemon that can outspeed Azumarill and also survive or nullify Aqua Jet, like Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu—which aren't OHKOed even at +6—are able to revenge kill Azumarill easily.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Terrain</strong>: Psychic Terrain from Azumarill's common teammate, Tapu Lele, prevents it from using Aqua Jet, a key part of its arsenal.

Knock Off can OHKO targets that comfortably tank Aqua Jet, like Amoonguss, Aegislash, and Gastrodon, after a Belly Drum. It also has the added utility of removing items, like Toxapex's Black Sludge or Mantine's Heavy-Duty Boots. Substitute is used to avoid status conditions and set up on defensive Pokemon like Torkoal and defensive Aegislash when Azumarill is behind Light Screen. Brick Break can also be used, as it hits Pokemon like Melmetal for more damage. Play Rough is an option for targets that survive both Knock Off and Aqua Jet, like Hydreigon. 4 HP EVs allow Azumarill to trigger its Sitrus Berry after a Belly Drum every time. The Speed EVs allow it to outpace most defensive Pokemon like Aegislash and Celesteela. It is a good idea to set up Belly Drum with dual screens active or in front of a passive Pokemon, since Azumarill usually only gets once chance to use it. You also don't want to use Belly Drum if Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain will still be active, since it prevents Aqua Jet from being used.</p> <p>Klefki is an invaluable teammate because of its dual screens—allowing Azumarill to set up more easily, Spikes, and Steel typing providing a Poison immunity and resistance to Ice. Spikes support is incredibly important for Azumarill, allowing it to always OHKO Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn after a Belly Drum. Clefable's utility options in Stealth Rock and Knock Off cripples foes and makes it easier for Azumarill to sweep as well. Tapu Bulu is great because it can beat Electric-types like Rotom-W and Alolan Raichu. It can revenge kill threats like Zapdos and Thundurus-T with a Choice Scarf or break through defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Toxapex with Substitute + Swords Dance. Tapu Koko is a great offensive pivot that provides STAB Thunderbolt and Dazzling Gleam to hit troublesome Water- and Dragon-types like Mantine, Toxapex, Latios, and Kyurem for Azumarill. Tapu Lele can beat Poison- and Dragon-types like Nidoking, Hydreigon, and Latias with its STAB Psyshock and Moonblast. Nasty Plot Togekiss can remove troublesome Poison- and Grass-types like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, Ferrothorn, and Rillaboom.

Knock Off can remove items like Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon, and it also beats the likes of Slowking and Aegislash. Superpower lets Azumarill deal hefty damage to Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Melmetal.</p> <p>Klefki is an incredible teammate, providing dual screens and a switch-in to Ice-, Grass-, and Poison-type attacks, as well as Spikes, which Azumarill heavily appreciates to pick up KOs more easily. Clefable's Stealth Rock and Knock Off are equally helpful for Azumarill. It also has Magic Guard, letting it act as a status absorber for Azumarill. Its Rocky Helmet allows it to chip down Pokemon like Celesteela, making it easier for Azumarill to break past them. Tapu Koko's U-turn can help Azumarill find opportunities to break through the opposing team. Choice Band Azumarill and Tapu Koko form a good offensive core, as Azumarill can beat Ground-types that come in on Tapu Koko, like Hippowdon and Excadrill, and Tapu Koko beats troublesome Dragon-, Water-, and Flying-types, like Hydreigon, Mantine, and Corviknight. Tapu Lele and Azumarill can break many defensive cores together with their powerful attacks. Tapu Lele can handle Poison- and Dragon-types like Dragalge, Toxapex, and Latios, while Azumarill can beat targets like Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and Slowking. However, Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge can sometimes prevent Azumarill from using Aqua Jet. Tapu Bulu enjoys Azumarill revenge killing Pokemon like Volcarona and Choice Scarf Blacephalon. In return, Tapu Bulu can beat Electric-type Pokemon like Rotom-W and Tapu Koko. It also beats Water-types like Mantine and Seismitoad. Togekiss beats Grass's and Poison's defensive cores with Substitute + Nasty Plot, that Azumarill has trouble breaking through.

Being part-Steel-type lets Steelix deter Toxic for the team and irritates teams like Grass, Fairy, and Dragon teams with Iron Defense. Heavy Slam is vital to check foes like Tapu Bulu and Clefable, which can trouble Steelix with their own setup, and also catches Whimsicott switching in to lock Steelix into a setup move with Encore. Body Press capitalizes on Iron Defense boosts to deal with Pokemon like Zarude, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Darmanitan. Steelix uses Substitute to block Leech Seed users like Ferrothorn, which interfere with its Leftovers recovery, and Iron Defense makes it much more difficult to break. Additionally, Substitute punishes foes like Weavile, Zarude, and Rillaboom switching out of Steelix, as it grants free Iron Defense setup or chip damage with Heavy Slam or Body Press.</p> <p>Steelix provides neutralities against Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu, Zarude, and Rillaboom and Ice-type Pokemon like Weavile, Arctozolt, and Galarian Darmanitan. Furthermore, Steelix can switch into common Toxic users like Klefki and Blissey for its teammates. Landorus-T is a reliable Ground-immune and Fighting-resistant teammate that can switch into Excadrill and Garchomp. Mamoswine is greatly appreciated for checking opposing Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoking, and Garchomp, as well as threatening Dragon- and Flying-types like Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Galarian Zapdos. Garchomp is an incredibly powerful wallbreaker that checks troublesome Pokemon like Volcarona and Victini. Gastrodon is extremely important to Ground teams for its Water immunity against Pokemon such as Kingdra, Barraskewda, and Volcanion. Nidoking is a potent special wallbreaker that breaks past Pokemon like Corviknight, Thundurus-T, and Tornadus-T with coverage moves in Thunderbolt and Ice Beam. Furthermore, it greatly pressures Aegislash and Kommo-o, which use Steelix as setup fodder.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<h3>Bug</h3> <p>Scizor is an essential sweeper for Bug teams due to its solid bulk, Steel typing, and access to recovery in Roost giving it ample setup opportunities with Swords Dance. With a spammable Technician-boosted STAB move in Bullet Punch and useful coverage in Knock Off and Superpower, Scizor is able to greatly threaten common types such as Fairy, Ice, Flying, and Dragon. Scizor's typing and access to reliable recovery in Roost allow it to check Psychic-, Fairy-, and Poison-types that Bug teams can often struggle against, such as Tapu Lele and Nihilego. However, Scizor's coverage is very one-dimensional, causing it to struggle in other matchups such as Water, Electric, and Fire. Furthermore, it is reliant on Bullet Punch for its damage output against faster targets, meaning that it can be easily revenge killed by Pokemon that resist Steel such as Heatran and Urshifu-R. Scizor's exploitable 4x weakness to Fire also limits its ability to switch into defensive Pokemon carrying Fire coverage such as Celesteela and Galarian Slowking.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Bug</h4> <p>Life Orb can be used over Metal Coat for more damage at the cost of longevity. Dual Wingbeat is an option that does more neutral damage than Bullet Punch thanks to Technician and hits Amoonguss, Urshifu-R, and Substitute users like Kyurem, while Psycho Cut can cover Poison-types like Toxapex. However, these are usually less useful than Roost or Superpower. A Choice Band set can be used for more initial power, but it makes Scizor much easier to play around once the set is known.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Bug</h4> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Toxapex take negligible damage from Scizor's boosted attacks and can get rid of its boosts through phazing moves or Haze.</p> <p><strong>Steel-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Water-, Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-types, including Urshifu-R, Volcanion, Zapdos, and Celesteela, do not fear Scizor's Bullet Punch and threaten Scizor with their powerful attacks or super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn from Pokemon like Galarian Corsola and Sableye is crippling for Scizor because it forces it to have multiple Swords Dance boosts to deal significant damage.

Volcarona is the primary partner for Scizor, as it can help deal with Steel-types such as Skarmory while also being able to sweep most types, including Poison and Electric, after Scizor breaks through them. In return, Scizor can handle Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Nihilego. Sticky Web support from Araquanid and Shuckle can help make up for Scizor's middling Speed, and Araquanid also provides a switch-in to Fire-types. Stealth Rock and Spikes support from Shuckle, Armaldo, and Golisopod can ease Scizor's wallbreaking by spreading chip damage, and Golisopod additionally provides utility against defensive teams through Knock Off and Taunt. Galvantula and Vikavolt can break Water-types that Scizor struggles against such as Toxapex and Gastrodon. Guts Heracross can threaten Steel-types such as Heatran and Celesteela for Scizor while also threatening Rotom-W.

Sticky Web allows Shuckle to slow down almost all Pokemon, being especially useful against those that rely on their Speed to be threatening like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Spectrier, and Alolan Raichu. It also helps against threats such as Choice Scarf Weavile and Excadrill that can clean Rock-teams late-game. In addition, it improves the matchup against types with poor entry hazard control such as Steel, Ghost, and Fairy. Encore prevents Shuckle from becoming setup fodder by locking foes like Cinderace or Aegislash into a setup move, giving a teammate that is able to deal with them a free switch. Encore can also annoy Defoggers, letting Shuckle's teammates come in safely and setup. Knock Off allows Shuckle to remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from foes like Tornadus-T and Landorus-T. Mental Herb prevents foes such as Froslass and Spectrier from taunting Shuckle, ensuring it can set up entry hazards at least once. Custap Berry can be used instead to ensure that Shuckle can set up both Stealth Rock and Sticky Web against strong foes without Taunt. Sturdy allows Shuckle to usually set up entry hazards at least once. Shuckle's EVs make it as physically bulky as possible in order to live Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</p> <p>All of Shuckle's offensive teammates benefit from its Stealth Rock and the speed control it provides. Choice Band Tyranitar loves Shuckle's Sticky Web, as it allows Tyranitar to defeat foes it would otherwise lose against, such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Choice Specs Gengar. Barbaracle outspeeds and defeats Sand Rush Choice Band Excadrill and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Weavile when supported with Sticky Web after a Shell Smash, allowing it to clean types such as Ground and Ice. It also becomes harder to revenge kill because Sticky Web slows down grounded Choice Scarf users. Nihilego is another setup sweeper that appreciates the entry hazards Shuckle sets, allowing Nihilego to devastate Water, Flying, Ground, and Fairy. Specifically, Nihilego can defeat Barraskewda, Swampert, and Corviknight with Shuckle's entry hazards in play. Choice Scarf Terrakion checks threats such as Cinderace, Zeraora, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Choice Scarf Heatran before Sticky Web has been set. It also acts as a strong revenge-killer, as it removes sweepers such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Excadrill, improving the Dark and Steel matchups.

Mantine's Flying typing provides a key neutrality to Grass as well as an immunity to Ground; this makes it effective against foes such as Swampert and Choice Scarf Excadrill locked into Earthquake, which its teammates appreciate. It's held back by its its 4x weakness to Electric, making it susceptible to Pokemon such as Victini and Nidoking that carry Electric-type coverage. Mantine's passivity also leads to a tremendous loss of momentum whenever it enters the field.

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<h3>Steel</h3> <p>Skarmory's typing allows it to easily find itself a spot in Steel teams for providing the much-needed Ground immunity and Fighting neutrality. Skarmory has access to Spikes, making it the primary setter for its team while freeing up Ferrothorn to run more utility options such as Thunder Wave and Stealth Rock. Its high Defense stat and great typing allow Skarmory to check various physically offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Urshifu-R with the help of Roost, Rocky Helmet, and Toxic. Moreover, having access to Roost and Toxic sets Skarmory apart from its competitors in Celesteela and Corviknight. Skarmory is an easy target for Electric-types such as Zapdos and Zeraora, which can grab momentum against Skarmory with their respective coverage. Furthermore, Skarmory can be trapped and eliminated by Magnezone, which enables a safer win route for Bulk Up Zeraora, and it is also vulnerable to Fire-type attacks from Pokemon such as Victini, Blacephalon, and Volcarona, which all pose a threat to it. Skarmory's Special Defense is low, making it weak to common special attackers in the tier such as Blacephalon, Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Being unable to touch any Ghost-type Pokemon outside of Toxic causes Skarmory to lose momentum heavily, especially against Substitute users such as non-Choice Specs Aegislash, Dragapult, and Spectrier, which all force it out.</p> <h3>Flying</h3> <p>Often appearing on balance teams, Skarmory's incredible Defense stat allows it to check many physical attackers such as Melmetal and Bisharp for its teammates. Due to its excellent typing, Skarmory can provide a key neutrality to Ice-type attacks, allowing it to check powerful Ice-types such as Mamoswine and Weavile. Skarmory's access to Spikes, Whirlwind, and Roost allows it to carve out a niche for itself on Flying teams. As a result of its low HP and Special Defense, Skarmory is unable to tank resisted hits from special attackers such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Choice Specs Tapu Lele and can be worn down by walls using special attacking moves like Scald from Toxapex. Skarmory faces competition from Corviknight and Celesteela, as they both share the same typing. Corviknight and Celesteela can tank both physical and special attacks, while Skarmory is relegated to tanking physical attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>In offensive structures, using Skarmory as a suicide lead with both Spikes and Stealth Rock paired with a Custap Berry allows it to set up entry hazards for its offensive teammates at the beginning of the game and apply pressure more easily.</p> <h4>Flying</h4> <p>224 HP EVs allow Skarmory to always be at full HP after two turns of Leftovers recovery after Stealth Rock damage, thus enabling it to use Sturdy. However, this spread reduces Skarmory's overall physical bulk and makes it easier to KO.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Skarmory's only attacking move is Body Press, which is blocked by every Ghost-type Pokemon in the metagame and causes Skarmory to be forced out, especially if it's lacking Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types can all force out Skarmory with their respective STAB moves. Zapdos and Rotom-W can remove Spikes with Defog, while Magnezone threatens Skarmory with trapping. However, Magnezone must be careful to not take a hit from Body Press on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Skarmory has no way of handling offensive Fire-types such as Blacephalon, Volcarona, and Heatran, and these Pokemon can easily take advantage of Skarmory. However, the former two need to be careful about Toxic and the latter must be aware of Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Hydreigon, Kyurem, Dragapult, Gengar, and Spectrier can easily break through Skarmory due to its low Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Fast Taunt users such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Fini, and Heatran can block Skarmory from using Spikes, Whirlwind, and Roost.</p> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Hatterene</strong>: While preventing Skarmory from setting Spikes with Magic Bounce, Hatterene can also use Skarmory as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Due to Skarmory's low HP and Special Defense, it is 2HKOed from resisted special attacks from foes such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Foes such as Mandibuzz and Bulk Up Corviknight are able to inflict Taunt on Skarmory, preventing it from not only setting Spikes but also healing itself via Roost.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Skarmory serves as the primary Spikes setter for its team, allowing offensive teammates such as Bisharp and Excadrill to wallbreak more consistently throughout the game. Body Press synergizes well with Skarmory's bulk and is especially helpful in the mirror matchup against Pokemon such as Bisharp, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran on the switch, as well against Dark-types such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Hydreigon. Roost helps Skarmory to stay healthy throughout the match against foes such as Urshifu-R, Excadrill, and Tyranitar. Whirlwind is used to prevent setup from Pokemon such as Garchomp and Dragapult while also generating passive chip damage if Spikes were set beforehand. Toxic can be used over Whirlwind to cripple Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Mantine. Rocky Helmet complements Skarmory's physical bulk and typing excellently, as contact move users such as Urshifu-R and Weavile as well as U-turn and Flip Turn users such as Landorus-T, Scizor, Swampert, and Barraskewda will all be worn down by it. Sturdy allows Skarmory to set Spikes or use Toxic on a foe that can knock it out from full health if necessary. Furthermore, Sturdy allows Skarmory to deal damage against troublesome Pokemon that threaten Steel teams, such as Hydreigon. An Impish nature and maximum HP and Defense investment make Skarmory as tanky as possible against the aforementioned physical threats such as Urshifu-R, Excadrill, and Landorus-T.</p> <p>Having access to Spikes makes Skarmory a valuable teammate, as it allows its offensive teammates such as Excadrill, Aegislash, Melmetal, and Bisharp to have an easier time against common walls such as Toxapex, Porygon2, and Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn is one of the best teammates for Skarmory, as the duo form an effective entry hazard-stacking core with Ferrothorn's Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Skarmory can make up for Ferrothorn's weakness to Fighting, while Ferrothorn takes care of Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Rotom-W for Skarmory and provides a resistance to Water. Heatran provides the much-needed Fire immunity against Pokemon like Blacephalon and Hydreigon, while Skarmory can take on Ground-type attacks such as Earthquake from Garchomp and Excadrill. Furthermore, Heatran's common moves in Toxic and Magma Storm can deal immense chip damage when combined with Skarmory's Spikes. Excadrill takes care of Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zeraora if it is holding a Choice Scarf and can remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin to preserve Skarmory's Sturdy. Aegislash makes a good partner for Skarmory, as it relieves the pressure from Skarmory to handle Fighting-type attacks. This is especially important against Choice-locked foes such as Urshifu-R, which will have to avoid being heavily punished by Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Furthermore, Aegislash helps greatly against Psychic-types such as Hatterene and Tapu Lele, which Skarmory generally struggle against. Bisharp's ability in Defiant also deters Defog from Pokemon such as Mantine and Zapdos, and its typing allows it to shine against Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Galarian Slowking, Slowking, Galarian Corsola, and Spectrier.</p>"

      "Defensive Spikes (Flying)": {
        "description": "<p>Toxic allows Skarmory to punish opposing Defoggers such as Rotom-W and Heavy-Duty Boots Zapdos as they try to switch into it. Whirlwind can be used over it to phaze opposing setup sweepers such as Bisharp and Dragon Dance Dragapult. In conjunction with Skarmory's bulk it can be used to shuffle opposing teams, slowly damaging them via Spikes. Body Press uses Skarmory's enormous Defense stat to hit threats such as Galarian Darmanitan and Tyranitar. Roost provides Skarmory with reliable recovery, allowing it to preserve Sturdy as well as consistently providing an answer to foes such as Cloyster and Excadrill. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers as well as pivots that use Flip Turn and U-turn by taking a chunk of their HP. Leftovers allows Skarmory to gain passive recovery, which it in turn gives it more chances to use its ability Sturdy. Sturdy is Skarmory's best ability, as it can allow Skarmory to survive attacks from foes such as Heliolisk and Volcarona when at full HP, and it can proceed to OHKO the former with Body Press. Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Bold nature allows Skarmory to be as bulky as possible, as well as boosting the power of Body Press.</p> <p>Mantine is an excellent teammate for Skarmory, as its superb Special Defense allows it to wall special attackers such as Volcarona, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Hydreigon. In return, Skarmory is able to handle foes like Dragonite and Dragapult. Skarmory appreciates the presence of Landorus-T to OHKO threats such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos. Landorus-T can also switch in on foes such as Zapdos after it has been Choice-locked into Thunderbolt. Skarmory then reciprocates this by acting as a switch-in to physical attackers such as Mamoswine that would otherwise OHKO Landorus-T with Icicle Crash. Defensive Zapdos can provide a key neutrality to Electric-type attacks as well as act as a special wall, taking attacks from foes such as Tapu Koko under Electric Terrain. Moreover, it can run a Toxic + Substitute set to wear down opposing walls such as Mandibuzz that Skarmory would find hard to deal with. Skarmory can then assist Zapdos by taking on potent physical attackers such as Swords Dance Terrakion that Zapdos would otherwise fall to. Zapdos can also run a Choice Specs set that appreciates Skarmory's ability to wear down foes such as Slowking with Spikes. Teammates such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres appreciate the presence of Spikes on the field, with the former potentially OHKOing foes such as Slowbro, Slowking, and Mew and the latter becoming a much more potent sweeper, being able to guarantee an OHKO on foes such as Slowking. In return, Galarian Zapdos is able to prevent foes from removing Spikes via Defog carelessly due to Defiant. Galarian Moltres is able to check the fearsome Spectrier that would otherwise OHKO Skarmory after it has been inflicted with a status condition. Thundurus-T and Dragonite are also good teammates for Skarmory, as both are helped by Spikes chipping away at their respective checks, and the former can absorb Electric-type attacks for it. Knock Off users such as Tornadus-T allow teammates to take advantage of Skarmory's entry hazards, as it can force foes that normally run Heavy-Duty Boots such as Victini and Cinderace to switchin less often. Moreover, Tornadus-T can use Taunt on opposing Defog users such as Mantine and Corviknight to prevent them from ridding the field of Skarmory's Spikes.</p>"

Flip Turn allows Kingdra to take advantage of common switch-ins like Toxapex, pivoting to teammates that can handle it like Barraskewda. Ice Beam is an option over Hurricane so that Kingdra can hit Flying-types like Galarian Moltres super effectively. However, it is less powerful than Hurricane against other targets. Kingdra can also run a Timid nature to outpace Regieleki, Choice Scarf Weavile, and Adamant Dragon Dance Dragapult at +1. However, if Kingdra is not running a Modest nature, it loses the ability to potentially 2HKO Ferrothorn under rain. Mystic Water and Dragon Fang are also options to allow Kingdra to switch moves and hit hard, and unlike Life Orb they don't reveal its item.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Kingdra is a decent Swift Swim user for Water teams utilizing rain, as it helps in various matchups such as Electric, Grass, and especially Dragon. Draco Meteor threatens bulky walls such as Dragalge and Amoonguss. Dragon Pulse is used to deal with foes that resist Water such as Kyurem, as well as other foes like Galarian Slowking. Hydro Pump allows Kingdra to 3HKO Galarian Slowking and gives it a chance to 2HKO Ferrothron under rain. Hurricane can be run over Hydro Pump to let Kingdra hit Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu super effectively. Maximum Speed investment allows Kingdra to outspeed threats like Choice Scarf Latios and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T.</p> <p>As Kingdra relies on Swift Swim to do its job, Pelipper is an amazing teammate for it. If Kingdra opts to run Hurricane, Pelipper can run a defensive set with Heavy-Duty Boots rather than a Choice Specs set. Barraskewda can break down walls like Galarian Slowking, as well as threats such as Regieleki and Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain when rain is active. Urshifu-R is also an option, as it can pressure shared checks like Mantine and Galarian Moltres. It also ravages Ferrothorn and Kyurem, foes that would otherwise pose a huge threat to the team. Eject Button Toxapex supports Kingdra by crippling foes like Porygon2 and Chansey with Toxic and Knock Off. It also walls revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Dragapult. Slowking allows Kingdra to enter the field safely through Teleport, as well as providing Future Sight support to help wear down foes like Galarian Slowking. Swampert provides Stealth Rock support and can pivot Kingdra in via Flip Turn. It can also phaze Substitute Kyurem by using Roar. Late-game sweepers such as Crawdaunt, Cloyster, and Keldeo can be run alongside Kingdra, as they appreciate the holes Kingdra can punch in many teams. They also are able to deal with foes such as Chansey and Ferrothorn, which give Kingdra trouble. Volcanion is also an excellent teammate, as it can switch into and defeat Fairy-types like Tapu Fini, as well as Grass-types such as Ferrothorn.</p>"

Recover provides Porygon2 with a reliable form of healing for it to continually switch into attacks from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Excadrill and Mimikyu. Foul Play acts both as a countermeasure for Pokemon like Scizor and Azumarill that would otherwise use Porygon2 as setup bait and as an attacking move to hit other powerful physical threats like Alolan Marowak and Excadrill. Ice Beam gives Porygon2 good coverage to deal with Dragon threats like Hydreigon and Noivern more easily as well as certain other offensive threats like Diggersby and Hawlucha. Toxic allows Porygon2 to wear down defensive Pokemon like Mandibuzz and Gastrodon that may otherwise attempt to switch in. Teleport is another option to be considered, as it allows Porygon2 to bring in frail offensive Normal-type threats like Diggersby, Heliolisk, and Indeedee-M safely and create momentum. Discharge can be an option to run over Toxic as good coverage for hitting Flying- and Water-type threats like Corviknight and Pelipper with a sizable chance to paralyze notable threats for Normal teams such as Calm Mind Keldeo and Bulk Up Urshifu-R, which would otherwise use Porygon2 as setup fodder. Trace is generally the preferred ability due to the potential of copying abilities like Natural Cure from Chansey, Regenerator from Toxapex and Amoonguss, and Intimidate from Krookodile, all of which increase Porygon2's survivability. Maximum investment in HP and Defense with a Bold nature is used to have Porygon2 perform its best as a physical wall against threats like Excadrill and Scizor.</p> <p>Most if not all Pokemon on Normal appreciate Porygon2's ability to deal with physical threats. Blissey in particular forms an excellent defensive core with Porygon2 due to being especially weak to offensive physical threats. Porygon2 in return appreciates Blissey's role as a special wall to help deal with strong special threats that itself cannot hold off like Kingdra in rain and Volcarona. If Porygon2 is running Teleport, frail offensive threats like Diggersby and Indeedee-M appreciate its ability to bring them in safely without leaving them open to attacks and status moves. Braviary helps Porygon2 deal with hard-hitting threats that have Fighting-type coverage like Heracross and Rillaboom. Porygon2 is especially susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, particularly Toxic Spikes, due to their ability to quickly wear down Porygon2 and reduce its ability of switching into attacks reliably. As a result, Porygon2 along with the entire Normal team appreciates Braviary's ability of keeping hazards off through the use of Defog. Ditto makes for a good partner due to its ability to punish offensive setup sweepers that may use Porygon2 as setup fodder like Belly Drum Azumarill, Swords Dance Excadrill, and Bulk Up Urshifu-S. Ditto and Porygon2 also work well together due to their ability to PP stall Poison and Water teams by copying Regenerator from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Heliolisk provides Porygon2 with an easier time against Water due to its great ability in Dry Skin for absorbing powerful Water-type attacks from wallbreakers like Dracovish. Bewear appreciates Porygon2's ability to mitigate its low Speed by paralyzing faster Pokemon like Hydreigon and Kyurem with Discharge. Porygon2 in return gains a partner to help deal with Steel- types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn that it would otherwise have a hard time dealing with.</p>"

Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Suicune is extremely vulnerable to entry hazards, status, and other chip damage leaving it unable to reliably switch into attacks. In addition, having Scald as its only offensive move makes it vulnerable to Water-immune Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Mantine. Furthermore, Suicune's heavy reliance on Leftovers makes it extremely vulnerable to Knock Off.</p>",

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<h3>Dark</h3> <p>Tyranitar easily finds itself a spot on Dark teams thanks to its access to Stealth Rock. Setting sand enhances its natural bulk, allowing Tyranitar to act as a special sponge against threats such as Dragapult, Galarian Moltres, Zapdos, and Kyurem. It also comes with a variety of utility options; Thunder Wave is great against faster threats such as Dragapult and Weavile, while Toxic helps when facing common walls Tyranitar struggles against, such as Swampert. Its typing allows it to check Flying- and Fire-types, most notably Togekiss, Galarian Moltres, Zapdos, Heatran, Blacephalon, and Victini. However, despite being a solid special tank, Tyranitar's typing stacks up its team's Fighting weakness while also creating weaknesses to common types such as Water and Ground. Due to its mediocre Speed, Tyranitar is outsped by the vast majority of the metagame, giving foes a chance to do serious damage. Tyranitar also lacks any form of recovery and is weak to residual damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p>Tyranitar has no other options.</p> <h4>Rock</h4> <p>Tyranitar can viably run a set with Dragon Dance over Fire Punch, though Corviknight, Celesteela, and Skarmory can easily exploit this set. In addition, Tyranitar is a better wallbreaker than sweeper for Rock teams because it can pave the way for other sweepers like Barbaracle to sweep. It can also run a special set using Dark Pulse, Earth Power, Fire Blast, and Ice Beam to surprise foes such as Skarmory. However, this set isn't very good due to Tyranitar's mediocre Special Attack stat, as well as Nihilego taking care of Special special Tyranitar's targets, anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Skarmory and Toxapex can comfortably take on Tyranitar and threaten it with moves like Body Press and Scald, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Due to its mediocre Speed, Tyranitar is easily revenge killed by many Pokemon such as Urshifu-R, Terrakion, Keldeo, Zeraora, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Tyranitar doesn't appreciate status conditions like Toxic and burn, as they negate its Leftovers and limit its overall longevity in the field.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Stealth Rock allows Tyranitar's offensive teammates such as Zarude, Weavile, and Hydreigon to break through teams more consistently. Rock Blast is its preferred STAB move, allowing Tyranitar to take on Substitute Kyurem and Galarian Moltres more reliably. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster threats such as Dragapult, while Toxic cripples Pokemon Tyranitar cannot beat reliably such as Swampert. Heavy Slam allows Tyranitar to take on Tapu Lele and the uncommon Hatterene. Sand Stream sets sand, which boosts Tyranitar's Special Defense, allowing it to tank hits from foes such as Zapdos and Kyurem better.</p> <p>Zarude makes a phenomenal partner for Tyranitar, as it can cover two of Tyranitar's most crucial weaknesses: Ground- and Water-types such as Swampert, Hippowdon, and Toxapex. In return, Tyranitar can deal with Flying-types such as Galarian Moltres and Zapdos. Weavile enhances the matchup against Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Garchomp, while Tyranitar handles Kyurem for Weavile. Mandibuzz forms a solid defensive backbone with Tyranitar for Dark teams. As it takes neutral damage from Bug- and Fighting-type attacks, Mandibuzz can take on such attacks directed at Tyranitar, while Tyranitar can comfortably tank BoltBeam coverage with its excellent special bulk. Moreover, Mandibuzz provides Toxic and Defog; the former allows Tyranitar to run Thunder Wave freely and the latter prevents entry hazards from damaging Tyranitar. Hydreigon is a fantastic wallbreaker that can handle Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as well as directly switching into Water- and Grass-type moves for Tyranitar. Mandibuzz and Hydreigon also provide Ground immunities for Tyranitar. Bisharp breaks past Fairy-types such as Clefable and Klefki and threatens Defog users such as Mantine and Zapdos due to Defiant, helping keep Stealth Rock up. Drapion aids Tyranitar with checking Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Hatterene. Drapion also has Toxic Spikes, which can be used to cripple types without proper hazard removal options such as Grass, Dragon, and Fairy.</p>"

        "description": "<p>A fierce wallbreaker, Tyranitar plays an important role on Rock teams in beating defensive foes such as Corviknight, Slowbro, and Ferrothorn. Stone Edge is used for its high Base Power and effectiveness against Flying teams. It's also the safest move to use against Poison, Flying, and Electric teams, as their defensive cores cannot easily switch into it. Despite having less power, Crunch is more reliable than Stone Edge and can threaten many Ghost- and Psychic-type walls, such as Galarian Corsola and Slowbro, as well as Dragapult and Latios. Earthquake allows Tyranitar to hit Steel- and Electric-types such as Heatran and Tapu Koko, as well as Toxapex. In conjunction with Earthquake, Fire Punch pressures Steel-type teams and prevents Tapu Bulu, Zarude, and Ferrothorn from coming in on Tyranitar, gaining momentum with their setup or utility moves. The given EV spread allows Tyranitar to survive Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Moonblast while still outpacing Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>All of Tyranitar's teammates appreciate its ability to set sand. Shuckle can slow foes down with Sticky Web and chip them via Stealth Rock, both of which let Tyranitar break through teams more easily. Terrakion and Tyranitar form a deadly wallbreaking core together, with Terrakion dealing with foes such as Bisharp and Excadrill for Tyranitar, and Tyranitar handling Ghost-types and Psychic-types such as Galarian Corsola, Dragapult, and Slowbro. Nihilego is an excellent partner due to it taking on Corviknight and Urshifu-R, which beat Tyranitar. In return, Tyranitar is able to take care of Slowking and Galarian Slowking, as well as Steel-types such as Klefki and Aegislash, all of which wall Nihilego. Rhyperior can gang up on Steel- and Flying-types with Tyranitar and provide an Electric immunity. Barbaracle appreciates Tyranitar getting rid of foes such as Slowking, Slowbro, and Aegislash, which Barbaracle has trouble defeating. Coalossal is a decent partner for Tyranitar, as it can not only chip foes via Spikes, but also use Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards, which prevent Tyranitar from being as effective. Furthermore, it can burn foes like Scizor and Melmetal with Flame Body.</p>"

Nasty Plot turns Celebi into a dangerous sweeper, that can dismantle troubling matchups such as Poison and Steel. Giga Drain allows it to have passive recovery and mitigates Life Orb's recoil damage. Psychic helps greatly in the Poison- and the Fighting-type matchup, as Celebi can take care of Toxapex and Kommo-o with it. Earth Power is used to hit most Steel- and Poison-types such as Excadrill and Skuntank. Weather Ball can be used over Earth Power on sun teams to hit Corviknight and Ferrothorn when sun is active. Celebi should try to come in on passive attacks such as Toxapex's Scald, on a predicted switch, via U-turn, or after a teammate faints. Nasty Plot should be used on Pokemon it can threaten out such as Toxapex and Keldeo. Having 252 Special Attack EVs and Life Orb allows Celebi to be as powerful as possible, and 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow it to outpace Lucario and Speed tie with Jirachi.</p> <p>Celebi loves Stealth Rock support from Ferrothorn, as it makes it easier for Celebi to sweep mid- to late-game and can swap into faster Poison-type Pokemon like Gengar. Celebi also appreciates Ferrothorn's Steel typing to take physical attacks or Ice-type attacks from Pokemon like Mamoswine and Alolan Ninetales. Appletun is another key member that forms a defensive core with Ferrothorn and can come in on Fire-type attacks thanks to its Dragon typing and Thick Fat. Choice Scarf Virizion provides great speed control and can OHKO Alolan Ninetales with Smart Strike, use its Fighting-type STAB moves greatly in the Dark-type matchup to take care of Hydreigon and Bisharp, and handle Choice Scarf Charizard with Stone Edge. Virizion can also serve on sun teams as a secondary Sunny Day setter if Whimsicott is eliminated. Rotom-C is another good teammate to help take care of Flying-types such as Togekiss and can use Nasty Plot, Substitute, and Dark Pulse to greatly help out in the Ghost-type matchup. Whimsicott is another good member, especially if Celebi is running Weather Ball, thanks to its Prankster-boosted Sunny Day, allowing Celebi to sweep Steel teams with Weather Ball. Whimsicott is also able to switch into Dragon-type attacks for Celebi and hit back with Moonblast. Shiftry is good to pair with Celebi because it helps greatly with the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchup, using its STAB attacks to take care of troubling Pokemon like Indeedee and Chandelure. In return, Celebi takes care of threats to Shiftry such as Lucario and Toxapex. Venusaur is a nice partner because it can help greatly with Fairy-types such as Togekiss as well as threats to Celebi like Bisharp and Aegislash with Weather Ball when sun is active.</p>"

In addition, Swampert has access to a wide variety of utility moves, including Stealth Rock and Roar. It is also able to take hits in order to reliably set Stealth Rock multiple times during a battle. Its Water / Ground typing may turn out to be its eventual downfall, as Swampert is 4x weak to Grass-type attacks from Rillaboom, Tapu Koko, and Thundurus-T. Swampert suffers from constantly tanking hits from foes due to having no reliable recovery and therefore has little longevity. This prevents it from switching in and out of battle constantly, making Defog users a nuisance. Swampert can generate momentum with Flip Turn, preventing it from becoming passive.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>A set with Rindo Berry and Mirror Coat is able to catch threats such as Alolan Raichu, Tapu Koko, and Thundurus-T off guard. However, it severely reduces Swampert's HP, making it harder to bring it onto the field. Furthermore, this set can be scouted for with any chip damage. Toxic can be run over Roar in order to put bulkier walls such as Mantine and Mandibuzz on a timer; however, this prevents Swampert from phazing setup sweepers such as Hydreigon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mantine and Rotom-W are immune or resistant to both of Swampert's offensive moves, in addition to having the ability to get rid of Stealth Rock via Defog.

Roar not only takes advantage of the aforementioned Stealth Rock, but it allows Swampert to phaze setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Dragonite, preventing it from becoming setup fodder. Flip Turn takes advantage of Swampert's little Speed investment to allow the player to gain momentum by having switch advantage. Swampert's EVs allow it to survive a Grass Knot from Choice Specs Tapu Koko and KO it back with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Almost all Water-type Pokemon benefit from the presence of Swampert on the team, as it is able to shield the rest of the team from Electric-type moves such as Rising Voltage and Thunderbolt, as well as set Stealth Rock. Notable mentions of Pokemon that benefit from Swampert being on a team are Pelipper and Mantine, as they both have a 4x weakness to Electric-type moves. Pelipper and Mantine can also switch into Ground-type moves to prevent Swampert from taking unnecessary damage. Pelipper can set rain for Swift Swim teammates that Swampert can pivot in via Flip Turn, and Mantine can use Defog for its teammates. Due to the aforementioned immunity, Swampert and Toxapex form a defensive backbone together, with Toxapex being able to take on physical attackers for Swampert such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Dragonite. Toxapex can also absorb Toxic Spikes and Toxic for Swampert. Swampert assists wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Keldeo and Barraskewda. These wallbreakers are able to take care of walls such as Blissey, Porygon2, and Skarmory, which Swampert struggles against due to its passive nature. Choice Specs Keldeo especially is an amazing teammate for Swampert, as Flip Turn can bring it in to obtain KOs on both physical and special walls such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela. Choice Scarf Urshifu-R heavily benefits from the presence of Swampert, as it not only provides an aforementioned immunity to Electric but a special wall to take the special hits that Urshifu-R cannot. In turn, Urshifu-R can handle Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Ferrothorn for Swampert, as well as being able to revenge kill threats such as Tapu Koko and Zeraora. Tapu Fini prevents Swampert from being statused and can help Swampert avoid entry hazard damage with Defog. Tapu Fini also deals with Dragon-types that can wall Swampert such as Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Latios. Slowking also appreciates the aforementioned immunity as well, and Swampert appreciates a switch-in for certain special attackers such as Tapu Lele. Suicune is an excellent partner for Swampert due to its ability to stall out many bulkier Pokemon that Swampert would otherwise be unable to hit such as Celesteela. Slowking can form a pivoting core with Swampert, bringing in teammates like Barraskewda safely and then having them wreak havoc.</p>"

Scald is another STAB option to hit other weather setters and Electric-types such as Hippowdon, Tyranitar, and Tapu Koko on the switch, as well as spreading burns.

Urshifu-R appreciates rain making its Surging Strikes even harder to switch into, and it helps break past walls such as Ferrothorn. Crawdaunt is a wallbreaker that can help break through defensive cores in types like Psychic and Poison while also threatening frailer Pokemon with rain-boosted Aqua Jet. Slowking switches into Freeze-Dry users such as Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales for Pelipper. Toxapex alleviates pressure on Pelipper to check difficult Grass-types like Rillaboom, Zarude, and Tapu Bulu.

Generally, Taunt should be used to block setup, recovery, entry hazards, and status, and should be used in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off to break down many different Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Corviknight, and more. Be aware that Prankster Will-O-Wisp is especially useful for crippling faster offensive threats that Ghost teams hate dealing with such as Excadrill, Barraskewda, and Dracozolt.

Mixed-attacking Victini helps against Ground and Dragon teams, with Glaciate + Energy Ball making it very uncomfortable to switch into. Also, Choice Band Victini's V-create becomes a nuke under sun, 2HKOing Mantine. Choice Scarf Blacephalon provides a fast attacker that also takes advantage of sun. Volcanion provides a Water immunity and a temporary Ground immunity with Air Balloon, which is very useful against Water and Ground teams. Heatran is a great partner for Torkoal, as Heatran can fit Flash Cannon to threaten Fairy and Rock teams because Torkoal sets Stealth Rock instead. Furthermore, Toxapex becomes easier to trap, as it does less damage under sun. Moltres provides a more reliable Ground immunity than Air Balloon Volcanion while also providing Defog support and pivoting with U-turn.

        "description": "<p>With a high base Attack stat in conjunction with a phenomenal ability in Adaptability, Choice Band Crawdaunt serves as a hard-hitting wallbreaker for Dark teams. Knock Off is Crawdaunt's most powerful and most spammable Dark-type STAB move, allowing it to remove items from targets. Crabhammer is the strongest Water-type STAB move backed by Adaptability, cleanly OHKOing the likes of physically defensive Hippowdon and 2HKOing physically defensive Mandibuzz and defensive Corviknight. Aqua Jet makes up for Crawdaunt's low Speed and additionally allows it to pick off weakened or frail Pokemon such as Alolan Raichu, Gardevoir, Galarian Darmanitan, and Zeraora. Close Combat serves as a stronger means of hitting Ferrothorn as well as threatens Normal teams, as no Normal-type can switch into it. Alternatively, Crunch allows Crawdaunt to maintain the 2HKO on an itemless Toxapex. Crawdaunt should be brought into the battle to wallbreak with pivoting moves such as U-turn or through double switches, as it cannot switch into attacks due to its lackluster bulk. Maximum Attack investment in conjunction with an Adamant nature while holding a Choice Band allows Crawdaunt to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment allows Crawdaunt to outspeed defensive Rotom-W and defensive Mandibuzz.</p> <p>Tyranitar is able to provide Stealth Rock support, which wears the opposing team down and allows Crawdaunt to wallbreak more easily. Tyranitar can also cripple threats such as Mew, Gardevoir, and Indeedee-M with Thunder Wave, allowing Crawdaunt to outspeed them and making up for its lackluster Speed tier. Mandibuzz can switch into Pokemon such as Flygon, Virizion, and Excadrill that threaten Crawdaunt greatly, Defog away entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web that hinder Crawdaunt, and allow Crawdaunt to safely get into the battle with U-turn. Weavile and Bisharp appreciate Crawdaunt's wallbreaking abilities, as they all share similar checks. Weavile is able to beat Dragon-types such as Kommo-o and Noivern, while Bisharp is able to defeat Fairy-types such as Galarian Weezing and Hatterene. Additionally, Crawdaunt is able to wallbreak and punch holes through teams early-game, allowing Bisharp to sweep late-game. Dual screens Grimmsnarl makes up for Crawdaunt's poor bulk, allowing it to take hits more easily, while Bulk Up Grimmsnarl appreciates Crawdaunt's wallbreaking capabilities weakening Pokemon like Toxapex and allowing it to sweep more easily. Drapion is able to threaten Fairy-types such as Primarina, Togekiss, and Whimsicott, which all threaten Crawdaunt, in addition to providing Toxic Spikes support for Crawdaunt to wallbreak more easily. Incineroar is able to switch into Grass- and Fairy-type attacks and can provide Crawdaunt with a slow U-turn to enter the battle safely.</p>"

      "Choice Band (Water)": {
        "description": "<p>Crawdaunt is an incredible wallbreaker that fits on both balance and rain teams and can break through teams of many types such as Poison, Water, and Psychic. Knock Off is its most spammable move and can 2HKO walls like Toxapex and Slowbro, which can annoy rain sweepers, as well as removing important items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite. Crabhammer offers more power and threatens Dark-resistant walls like Galarian Weezing, Mandibuzz, and Clefable. Close Combat is a good coverage move for Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Melmetal. Crunch can be used instead to guarantee high, reliable damage after Knock Off removes a foe's item. It's especially helpful against bulky archetypes such as Poison and Water stall teams, notably 2HKOing Toxapex and Amoonguss even after they lose their items. Aqua Jet helps Crawdaunt compensate for its low Speed, pick off weakened foes, and potentially OHKO Gengar, Nihilego, Thundurus-T, and Choice Specs Tapu Koko after Stealth Rock in rain. An Adamant nature with maximum Speed EVs is enough to outpace slower Pokemon like Clefable, Swampert, uninvested Rotom-W, and Mantine.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Slowking, Slowbro, and Rotom-W that can pivot Crawdaunt into annoying walls are great teammates; Slowbro and Slowking can also provide Future Sight support, which helps Crawdaunt break through Poison teams, especially if it isn't running Crunch. Swampert provides an immunity to Electric, Stealth Rock support, and Flip Turn to pivot Crawdaunt in safely. Toxapex can check Grass-, Fairy- and Fighting-types, such as Tapu Bulu, Clefable, and Terrakion, and carry Eject Button on rain teams to pivot Crawdaunt in against slower threats. Pelipper is a reliable Defog user and activates rain, which can allow Crawdaunt to spam Aqua Jet and Crabhammer, 2HKOing Pokemon such as Amoonguss. Urshifu-R can overwhelm Steel-types if Crawdaunt is lacking Close Combat, threaten Ice-types such as Kyurem, and use U-turn to avoid losing momentum by bringing Crawdaunt into Psychic-types such as Slowbro. As Crawdaunt is slow, faster teammates such as Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini can clean up teams late-game.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Grass</h3> <p>Cradily is a great support option for Grass teams because of its utility options in Stealth Rock and Toxic, part-Rock typing that provides neutrality to Flying- and Fire-type attacks, and ability in Storm Drain to absorb Water-type attacks. Its part-Rock typing in conjunction with its high Special Defense and reliable recovery betters its ability to take on special attackers like Volcarona, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T. It forms a great defensive core with Amoonguss and Ferrothorn, with all covering each others' weaknesses fairly well. However, Cradily's typing leaves it susceptible to threats like Fighting-, Steel-, and Ice-types like Terrakion, Scizor, Galarian Darmanitan, and Glastrier. Its poor offensive stats give setup sweepers like Excadrill, Rillaboom, and Dragapult opportunities to set up with ease.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Grass</h4> <p>Earthquake is an option over Toxic to hit Poison- and Steel-types like Dragalge, Nidoking, Heatran, and Magnezone, but be aware of Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain being active. Heavy-Duty Boots is another effective way to keep Cradily healthy, since Grass normally doesn't run entry hazard removal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Grass</h4> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types like Galarian Weezing and Toxapex are immune to Toxic and aren't bothered by Cradily's Rock Blast. They can also hinder its recovery with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Cradily should be cautious of status, particularly Toxic and burns, because the former limits it as a reliable defensive switch-in and the latter halves the damage of Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Celesteela, Excadrill, and Aegislash can easily take Rock Blast repeatedly, are immune to Toxic, and can KO Cradily with their Steel-type attacks. Setup sweepers like Bisharp and Scizor can additionally set up. However, Earthquake can deal with Pokemon like Heatran and Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Zeraora and Choice Band Rillaboom can OHKO Cradily with their STAB attacks or super effective coverage moves, while special wallbreakers like Choice Specs Hydreigon can heavily dent Cradily.</p>",

Kyurem, in particular, can stall out other Rock-type STAB moves due to Pressure. Toxic allows Cradily to cripple potential switch-ins, bulkier Pokemon like Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Porygon2 that can recover off damage from Rock Blast, and setup sweepers like Hydreigon that may try using it as setup bait. Cradily can reliably stall foes with Toxic thanks to Recover. Storm Drain allows Cradily to pivot into Water-type attacks and prevents Scald burns from Pokemon like Toxapex. Maximum Special Defense and HP investment along with a Careful nature gives Cradily the best matchup against special attackers like Volcarona and Kyurem.</p> <p>All of Cradily's teammates appreciate its ability to set up Stealth Rock, which allows sweepers like Rillaboom and Zarude to secure KOs mid- or late-game and hampers threatening Fire- and Flying-types. Rillaboom and Zarude can take care of Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp with their Fighting-type attacks, while Cradily can get rid of threats like Volcarona and Togekiss with Rock Blast. Choice Band Rillaboom can break past defensive cores that threaten Cradily such as Toxapex + Pelipper and Galarian Slowking + Slowbro. Rillaboom also sets Grassy Terrain for Cradily, giving it passive recovery, and is able to get rid of Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Zapdos and Mantine with Knock Off, resulting in Stealth Rock wearing down teams more effectively. Bulk Up Zarude can pressure defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Blissey, which easily wall Cradily or threaten it with Toxic, and KO Psychic- and Ghost-types like Victini and Dragapult. Ferrothorn forms a defensive core with Cradily, setting Spikes and dealing with Ice- and Fairy-types like Alolan Ninetales, Cloyster, and Tapu Lele with Gyro Ball. Its part-Steel typing gives a neutrality against Bug-type attacks and allows it to pivot into Toxic. Ferrothorn also deals with physical attackers like Excadrill for Cradily, while Cradily deals with special attackers like Nidoking in return. Amoonguss absorbs Toxic Spikes that could hinder Cradily's recovery, spreads status ailments with Spore, Stun Spore, and poison from Sludge Bomb, and switches into Fighting-type attacks from Terrakion and Keldeo that could OHKO Cradily. Celebi and Whimsicott can also deal with Fighting-types that threaten Cradily with Psychic and Moonblast, respectively. Whimsicott also helps in the Dark- and Dragon-type matchups, as it can KO Pokemon like Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Dragapult with Moonblast and provides an immunity to Dragon. Rotom-C can get rid of Flying-types like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Taunt Mandibuzz with Thunderbolt, which Cradily fails to do much against, and break through defensive cores that overpower Cradily with Nasty Plot. Choice Scarf Rotom-C can also revenge kill faster Pokemon like Garchomp and Alolan Ninetales and bring Cradily safely into the field with Volt Switch.</p>"

Latias is a great Choice Scarf user that can revenge kill Pokemon like Dragonite after a Dragon Dance without Multiscale intact, 2HKO threats like Tapu Koko, and threaten fast Choice Scarf users like Terrakion, Nihilego, and Buzzwole. Latias also has utility options like Healing Wish and Defog, which let it fulfill a more supportive role. Levitate lets it serve as a Ground immunity and prevents it from being worn down by entry hazards. However, Latias faces competition with Latios as a revenge killer, as it has a better Special Attack and the ability to OHKO Choice Scarf Heracross and Terrakion without prior chip damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p>Mystical Fire can be used over Defog to help Latias defeat foes such as Ferrothorn, Tapu Bulu, and Scizor; however, its Defog support is more desirable. Trick can be used to hinder bulkier Pokemon that easily switch into Latias such as Celesteela and Slowking. A non-Choice Scarf set with Calm Mind and Stored Power can be used to help combat Electric-type teams more effectively.</p> <h4>Dragon</h4> <p>Trick over Psychic or Draco Meteor can be an option to hinder special walls such as Blissey, Mantine, and Celesteela; however, it is hard to justify using it over either of these options, as losing Psychic prevents Latias from taking care of Choice Scarf Buzzwole and Heracross, while dropping Draco Meteor makes Latias unable to revenge kill boosted Dragonite and Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Dragon</h4> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Latias fails to do meaningful damage to Steel-types because they resist both of its attacks.

Dragapult can also outpace and take care of Latias if it is running Choice Scarf or after a Dragon Dance. Mamoswine is also able to take care of a weakened Latias with Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Walls like Blissey and Mantine are able to tank both of Latias's attacks and wear it down with attacks such as Seismic Toss, Scald, and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Paralysis makes Latias unable to outpace Dragapult and Weavile, while Toxic puts it on a timer.</p>",

Psychic is a more reliable STAB option that allows Latias to take care of troublesome Fighting- and Poison-types like Terrakion, Galarian Weezing, and Choice Specs Gengar. Healing Wish can be used to fully heal threatening setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragapult. Levitate lets Latias come in on Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Hippowdon and makes it immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Latias to outpace Choice Scarf users like Terrakion and Buzzwole, Speed tie with Choice Scarf Latios, and outpace naturally faster threats like Dragapult and Weavile.</p> <p>All teammates appreciate Latias's Healing Wish and Defog support. Hydreigon greatly helps against troublesome Steel-types such as Aegislash, Excadrill, and Skarmory. Garchomp is useful for Stealth Rock support to secure the OHKO on Terrakion and Heracross. Garchomp can also take care of Steel-types such as Excadrill and Heatran, wall Regieleki, and take out Volcarona with Stone Edge or a boosted Scale Shot. Dragapult is very helpful in the Ghost and Psychic matchups, as it handles Gengar, Spectrier, and Tapu Lele. It can also sweep in the Dragon mirror matchup after one Dragon Dance. Kyurem is a notable partner, as it tears apart Water- and Ground-types that Latias has trouble beating, like Tapu Fini, Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon. Dragonite is a fearsome setup sweeper that greatly helps with troublesome Fairy-, Flying-, Steel-, and Dark-types like Tapu Koko, Mantine, Heatran, and Drapion. In return, Dragonite loves Latias's ability to take care of Terrakion and Buzzwole. Dragalge is great in the Fairy and Water matchups, as it can come in on Fairy-type attacks from Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko and use Toxic Spikes to make the Fairy and Normal matchups much easier. Dracovish excels at forcing switches and tearing apart defensive cores that Latias fails to do much against, such as Blissey + Porygon2 and Celesteela + Mantine + Zapdos, with its powerful STAB attacks and coverage moves like Stone Edge. In return, Latias threatens Keldeo and Toxicroak, which give it problems. Duraludon is also an option to provide Stealth Rock and take care of troublesome Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Clefable.

Psychic is Latias's second attack of choice, as it 2HKOes Tapu Koko and Toxapex. Psyshock can also be used over Psychic to pick off Volcarona after Quiver Dance and Nihilego. Defog removes entry hazards for its teammates such as Victini and Galarian Slowking, which eases pressure on them. Healing Wish in tandem with Choice Scarf allows Latias to fully heal a teammate such as Hatterene without fear of being outpaced.</p> <p>Victini helps Latias by beating Steel-types that Latias can't beat, such as Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Aegislash, and appreciates Latias's Healing Wish. Hatterene can help defeat Dark-type Pokemon such as Zarude and Galarian Moltres thanks to its Fairy typing, Calm Mind, and Trick Room, while Latias can use Healing Wish to let it set up again if need be. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele  is also a Fairy-type, and it revenge kills Pokemon such as non-Choice Scarf Weavile and Zarude for Psychic teams, alongside setting Psychic Terrain to help defeat Bisharp. Choice Specs Tapu Lele can also work alongside Latias to help defeat Pokemon such as Slowking and Landorus-T. Slowbro switches into Excadrill and Cinderace, alongside taking on Dragapult or Weavile if it's holding Kasib Berry or Colbur Berry, respectively. Galarian Slowking helps by switching into special attackers that can threaten Latias, such as Kingdra and opposing Tapu Lele. Jirachi provides an entry hazard for Psychic in Stealth Rock, can help combat Ice-types that threaten Psychic teams such as SubRoost Kyurem, and can take Dragon-type attacks such as Kingdra's Draco Meteor. While not directly supporting Latias, Mew provides strong general utility for Psychic teams by debilitating foes with Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp, which helps its teammates break through teams more easily. Indeedee can also be a niche teammate to help switch into Ghost-type moves, notably from Spectrier and Blacephalon.</p>"

Psyshock is used over Psychic to hit foes such as Swampert, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey harder than Psychic would. Mystical Fire is a great coverage option to dismantle Steel-types, notably OHKOing Ferrothorn and 2HKOing Celesteela after a Calm Mind boost.

Furthermore, its decent bulk and neutrality to Fighting allow it to take a hit in a pinch and be a good answer to Tapu Lele. However, its Special Attack is quite lackluster, as Jirachi fails to OHKO bulky Pokemon such as Kyurem, Hippowdon, and Toxapex even with Choice Specs. Because of this, Jirachi needs support from wallbreakers like Bisharp and Melmetal to remove specially defensive Pokemon, such as Galarian Slowking, and Pokemon that resist its attacks like Heatran.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p>Ice Punch or Fire Punch may be considered over Trick or Healing Wish with Choice Scarf to threaten Landorus-T and Garchomp or Ferrothorn. However, this comes at the cost of reduced utility. Toxic may be considered on specially defensive sets over Thunder Wave, as it allows Jirachi to wear down answers such as Porygon2, Slowbro, and Mandibuzz more quickly, opening them up for teammates such as Victini. However, this should only be considered if Jirachi is using Leftovers, as Toxic + Iron Head will not check Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Blacephalon. Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature may be considered on specially defensive sets to outspeed and threaten Mimikyu, Kyurem, and Choice Specs Tapu Lele at the cost of reduced bulk.</p> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>Aura Sphere can be used over Energy Ball to damage Ferrothorn, Magnezone, Heatran, and Tyranitar, which otherwise take negligible damage from this set; however, Steel teams can scout and punish Jirachi by switching to Aegislash, Celesteela, or Corviknight. A Calm Mind set with Moonblast, Psyshock, and Thunderbolt makes Jirachi a good wallbreaker and wincon against Poison; however, Jirachi rarely finds an opening to set up in other matchups. Trick can be used with Choice Specs to cripple specially defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Slowking, and Galarian Slowking, but losing a coverage move is detrimental to Jirachi's effectiveness.

This strategy pairs well with Thunder Wave, which slows foes for Jirachi to flinch through and increases the chance they can't move, as well as punishing switch-ins such as Victini, Volcarona, and Celesteela. U-turn lets Jirachi escape threats like Landorus-T, Aegislash, and Magnezone, which take advantage of it, or Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Heatran, which Jirachi can't win against.

Trick debilitates walls such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela, which in turn creates setup opportunities for its teammates, especially in matchups like Poison and Steel. Healing Wish lets Jirachi support a teammate in case Jirachi has been chipped down too much or is unneeded in the matchup, such as against Steel, Water, and Fire. Alternatively, Stealth Rock lets Jirachi still perform its role as an entry hazard setter, taking advantage of slower, passive Pokemon such as Blissey, Galarian Weezing, and Clefable, which tend to switch out on it.</p> <p>Due to Jirachi running Choice Scarf, teammates such as Tapu Lele and Latias are free to run other sets, or they can be done away entirely. Choice Specs Tapu Lele appreciates Jirachi's ability to lure in Toxapex, revenge kill Weavile and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, and flinch down Hydreigon. In return, it wears down opposing teams due to its near-unwallable coverage. Calm Mind Latios appreciates being brought in against passive defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro and Corviknight and loves Healing Wish, which gives it another chance to wallbreak. In return, Latios provides a Ground immunity, breaks down types such as Poison and Flying, and deals with troublesome foes such as Choice Band Urshifu-R, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn. Victini deals with all Steel-types that wall Jirachi except for Heatran, and it appreciates Healing Wish support to threaten Steel and Grass teams a second time. Slowbro can switch into strong physical attackers such as Barraskewda, Excadrill, and Garchomp, which threaten Jirachi. Hatterene may be considered over Tapu Lele, as Jirachi provides revenge killing and cleaning; Hatterene deals with fast Dark-type threats, such as Zarude and Galarian Moltres, while also pressuring types such as Electric and Water. Defensive setup sweepers such as Agility + Calm Mind Latias and Cosmic Power Mew are also great teammates, as they help in matchups such as Electric, Ground, and Flying, and they also appreciate Jirachi's Healing Wish support.</p>"

Moonblast deals with Dark- and Dragon-types such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o. Thunder OHKOes Mantine, 2HKOes Slowking and specially defensive Celesteela, and has a high chance to paralyze the opponent's switch-in thanks to Serene Grace. Thunderbolt provides better accuracy at the cost of not being able to OHKO Mantine and the reduced probability to spread paralysis. Energy Ball helps Jirachi break Water and Ground teams by threatening Swampert, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad. A Timid nature lets Jirachi outspeed Kyurem, Urshifu-R, Hydreigon, and Nidoking.</p> <p>Teammates such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn, which provide entry hazards to chip the opposing team, are excellent partners to Jirachi. Skarmory also provides a Ground immunity, checks fast physical attackers such as Terrakion, and phazes physical setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill with Whirlwind. Alternatively, Corviknight can be used over Skarmory, as it allows Jirachi to come in safely with a slow U-turn while also checking Fighting-types with Brave Bird. Celesteela can also be the Ground-immune partner, as it can threaten Steel-types that wall Jirachi such as Ferrothorn with Flamethrower. Ferrothorn checks Ground- and Water-types such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Barraskewda, and it provides passive recovery to Jirachi in the form of Leech Seed. Heatran provides a Fire immunity and spreads Toxic to chip down defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Slowbro. It can also phaze special setup sweepers such as Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon with Roar, as well as taking most special attacks aimed at Jirachi. Aegislash appreciates Jirachi removing Poison-types and aids it in the Flying and Water matchups by softening the opposing team with Toxic. Excadrill provides an Electric immunity and can outspeed and check Fire- and Steel-types such as Volcanion, Victini, and Heatran when using a Choice Scarf set. Bisharp forms a good offensive core with Jirachi, as it threatens Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Aegislash and Victini with Sucker Punch, while Jirachi helps Bisharp sweep by removing Fighting- and Dark-types such as Urshifu-R and Hydreigon. Bisharp and Excadrill also take advantage of Jirachi's wallbreaking power to clean up late-game once bulky Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss have been sufficiently chipped or removed. Melmetal punches holes in the opponent's team early-game and has enough bulk to remove troublesome Pokemon such as Cinderace, Azumarill, and Tyranitar.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<h3>Ground</h3> <p>Due to Storm Drain and its solid mixed bulk, Gastrodon provides a vital Water immunity for Ground teams, allowing it to wall troublesome Pokemon like Barraskewda, Rotom-W, and Keldeo. This is very beneficial for its teammates, as Gastrodon can prevent Water-type moves from being spammed and force the opponent to play around it. Its access to Recover also gives it a huge edge over Seismitoad, since it can consistently wall the aforementioned threats without being too affected by chip damage. A neutrality to Ice allows Gastrodon to repeatedly take hits from threats to Ground teams such as Weavile, Galarian Darmanitan, and Mamoswine as well. Storm Drain's Special Attack boost can also help make Gastrodon less passive, allowing it to fire off powerful Scalds. However, replacing Seismitoad means that Gastrodon can be taken advantage of by a huge threat in Azumarill, which is able to OHKO it with Knock Off after a Belly Drum boost, proceeding to possibly sweep the rest of the entire team. Gastrodon is typically passive and can be almost completely useless against foes like Substitute Hydreigon, Substitute Kyurem, Tapu Bulu, and Zarude. Despite having solid mixed bulk, Gastrodon can be exploited by many powerful wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Rillaboom, and Crawdaunt due to Knock Off.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>Clear Smog is an option on Gastrodon's moveset to get rid of stat boosts from Pokemon like Volcarona and Calm Mind Tapu Fini. However, replacing a move like Toxic can make it more difficult to wear down foes, forcing Gastrodon to rely on mediocre damage output. Float Stone is also an alternative item to weaken Grass Knot from foes like Alolan Raichu, Tapu Koko, and Thundurus-T. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to prevent Gastrodon from being overwhelmed by entry hazard damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and Zarude are all able to force out or OHKO Gastrodon with their STAB moves. Zarude in particular is also able to remove any status condition that Gastrodon can inflict on it with Jungle Healing.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Gastrodon is pressured by many powerful wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Choice Specs Dragapult, Gengar, and Crawdaunt, as they are able to force massive damage on it.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Hydreigon, Bulk Up Zarude, Calm Mind Spectrier, and Swords Dance Tapu Bulu are able to completely overwhelm Gastrodon and the rest of the team once they have set up.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Substitute users such as Kyurem, Hydreigon, Spectrier, and Tapu Bulu are able to set up in front of Gastrodon, forcing it to switch out into another teammate before they get multiple boosts.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Foes that carry Toxic such as Celesteela, Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Zapdos are able to wear down Gastrodon each turn, forcing it to use Recover more during a match and leaving it chipped so it can be KOed more easily.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>While Earth Power is useful because of Gastrodon's higher Special Attack, Earthquake is preferred over it to break Keldeo and Dragapult's Substitute. Scald can cripple many physical attackers such as Weavile, Bisharp, Galarian Darmanitan, and Dragonite due to its decent burn chance. Toxic is able to cripple many switch-ins and foes that Gastrodon wouldn't be able to deal with otherwise such as Latios, Latias, Rotom-W, and Mantine. Recover is mandatory to heal off damage from threats like Barraskewda, Keldeo, and Kingdra, letting it consistently check them. Leftovers gives Gastrodon extra recovery in order to preserve its health better. A physically defensive spread allows Gastrodon to take hits from foes like Secret Sword Keldeo, Barraskewda, and Weavile better. Avoid getting Gastrodon too weakened by moves or status conditions like Toxic, since it will be unable to consistently wall Pokemon and may get KOed by Water-type Pokemon with other STAB moves like Urshifu-R and Kingdra.</p> <p>Hippowdon forms a decent defensive core with Gastrodon, as its Sand Stream and access to Stealth Rock make it capable of wearing down foes easily. Excadrill is an excellent offensive partner that can pressure foes that give Gastrodon trouble like Latias, Zarude, Tapu Lele, Kyurem, and Tapu Bulu and function even more effectively under Hippowdon's sand. It can also remove troublesome entry hazards for Gastrodon with Rapid Spin. Mamoswine is able to revenge kill fast Dragon-, Grass-, and Flying-types that give Gastrodon trouble such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, Zarude, and Thundurus-T with Ice Shard, making it a useful wallbreaker. Nidoking is particularly useful for its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes for Gastrodon and KO problematic foes like Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Skarmory due to its excellent coverage and good power with Life Orb and Sheer Force. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can outspeed and revenge kill wallbreakers that Gastrodon struggles against such as Spectrier, Tapu Lele, and Gengar while removing entry hazards for it with Defog. Swords Dance Garchomp is a great wallbreaker that breaks past bulky foes such as Slowking, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela with Fire Fang while providing a useful Grass neutrality for Gastrodon. Choice Scarf Krookodile is an option to deal with Psychic- and Ghost-types that Gastrodon dislikes dealing with such as Tapu Lele, Celebi, Dragapult, and Spectrier.</p>"

Earthquake allows Gastrodon to effectively damage Electric-type Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Zeraora that otherwise threaten Water-type teams, as well as breaking Substitutes from Pokemon such as Keldeo, Primarina, Dragapult, Jirachi, and Aegislash. Scald is useful for burning physical attackers like Excadrill, Scolipede, and Hawlucha, whereas Toxic can badly poison a number of Pokemon such as an opposing Gastrodon, Galarian Corsola, and Araquanid. Recover and Leftovers allow Gastrodon to stay healthy to continue spreading status ailments and serve as a defensive pivot. However, Float Stone with maximum Special Defense investment is nice for taking on Grass Knot Heliolisk and Alolan Raichu, while Heavy-Duty Boots is valuable for avoiding entry hazard damage, particularly Toxic Spikes. Storm Drain is useful to avoid Scald burns from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mantine, while Sticky Hold is great for Knock Off users such as Bisharp, Crawdaunt, and Weavile. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows it to better take on physical attackers such as Zeraora and Excadrill.</p> <p>The entire team appreciates Gastrodon's role in absorbing Electric-type attacks; therefore, it fits on more balanced teams with Pokemon like Toxapex, Azumarill, Slowking, and Mantine. Toxapex is a glue on every Water team, as it provides utility with Knock Off, Toxic, and Toxic Spikes, and it can spread status effects just like Gastrodon. Azumarill offers a nice immunity to Grass-type attacks from Pokemon like Rillaboom and Ferrothorn and pairs well with Gastrodon, since that is its only weakness. Slowking helps with special attackers like Hatterene, Togekiss, Substitute Kyurem, and Psychic-type Pokemon that may try to use Expanding Force under Psychic Terrain against Gastrodon , while Mantine prevents special attackers like Volcarona, Hatterene, and Chandelure from setting up and sweep with Haze. In return, Gastrodon helps with physical attackers along with Toxapex thanks to their amazing Defense stats. Keldeo helps against Normal-, Ice-, and Steel-types such as Blissey, Kyurem, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn that wall Gastrodon with Secret Sword. Primarina helps with Dark-, Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Keldeo thanks to its Fairy-type STAB moves, as well as beating passive defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Toxic Aegislash with Substitute and Calm Mind. Rotom-W is a nice revenge killer to Flying- and Water-type teams with Thunderbolt and offers a Ground immunity along with entry hazard removal with Defog.</p>"

Poison Jab does a fantastic job of handling Grass-types such as Appletun and the aforementioned Psychic-types. Sucker Punch is used to punish Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Dragapult, Jirachi, and Alolan Raichu. However, it must be used with caution in the Psychic matchup, as Jirachi's common teammate Indeedee-M blocks Skuntank from using Sucker Punch with Psychic Terrain. Defog gets rid of entry hazards while freeing Galarian Weezing from running it and removing Electric Terrain and Psychic Terrain. Protect is used to scout for moves from Choice-locked Pokemon such as Jirachi and Excadrill while also providing an additional turn of Black Sludge recovery. Aftermath is picked to punish foes that heavily depend on contact moves, such as Dracovish, Bisharp, Jirachi, and Weavile, and common U-turn users such as Dragapult and Celebi.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing is a good partner with its ability Levitate, allowing it to be immune to Ground-type attacks from foes such as non-Mold Breaker Excadrill, Seismitoad, and Hippowdon. Galarian Weezing also provides Will-O-Wisp support, which can be used to cripple physically offensive Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Weavile. In return, Skuntank frees Galarian Weezing from running Defog, which creates space for coverage options such as Flamethrower and Fire Blast. Vileplume forms a solid defensive core with Skuntank with its physical bulk and Strength Sap. Moreover, with its Ground neutrality, Vileplume provides a switch-in to Mold Breaker Excadrill by always taking two unboosted attacks, and with Skuntank's Defog, Vileplume switches into Excadrill even more safely. Toxapex is a fantastic defensive pivot for many offensive Pokemon such as non-Taunt Keldeo, Dracovish, and Mimikyu. Between Toxic, Baneful Bunker, and Toxic Spikes, Toxapex comes with great potential to spread poison, which can be further exploited with Skuntank's Protect. Salazzle benefits well from Skuntank, as Skuntank can Defog entry hazards for Salazzle. This allows Salazzle to use the combination of Substitute + Toxic relatively safely and to threaten Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Aegislash with its Flamethrower. Furthermore, Salazzle can take out Choice Scarf Excadrill if it's behind Substitute. In return, Salazzle takes advantage of defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Mandibuzz, which Skuntank struggles against. Skuntank also helps with Toxic damage accumulation with its Protect. With its good coverage, Gengar takes out Pokemon that have the potential to exploit Skuntank, such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. In return, Skuntank can switch into Ghost-type attacks for Gengar. Drapion can be used as a fast teammate to take out other Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Gardevoir. Furthermore, its Knock Off can remove items from foes such as Galarian Corsola, Corviknight, and Toxapex.</p>"

Toxic can also set offensive Pokemon like Dragonite and Garchomp on a timer, limiting their chances to break through Bronzong and its teammates. Levitate provides Bronzong with a Ground immunity and lets it take on foes such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Dragonite.

Other offensive Pokemon like Latios and Tapu Lele greatly appreciate Stealth Rock. Tapu Lele can beat troublesome Dark-types like Crawdaunt and Hydreigon. Latios's STAB Draco Meteor and Psyshock let it tear apart cores of Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Drapion on Poison as well as Pelipper, Toxapex, and Swampert on Water.

Mew makes up for Bronzong's passivity, as it can break through defensive cores on types like Steel, Water, and Flying with the combination of Taunt + Knock Off. Calm Mind Hatterene appreciates Bronzong weakening opposing Pokemon with Stealth Rock and Toxic, giving it an easier time late-game.

Garchomp's Speed tier allows it to excel as a cleaner and wallbreaker, taking on threats such as Urshifu-R, Kyurem, Mimikyu, Mew, and Tapu Fini. Its Dragon typing helps it tank Water- and Grass-type attacks from threats such as Rillaboom and Urshifu-R, which potentially allows Garchomp to stop a sweep. While its Speed tier and Dragon typing offer a lot, they still leave Garchomp vulnerable to common threats such as Weavile, Zarude, and Latios and compound a Ground team's natural weakness to Ice-type attacks.</p> <h3>Dragon</h3> <p>Garchomp's well rounded stat distribution, STAB coverage, and access to Stealth Rock play a pivotal role on Dragon teams and their naturally aggressive playstyle.

Scale Shot boosts Garchomp's Speed, allowing it to revenge kill faster threats such as Tapu Koko, but it drops Garchomp's Defense and makes it vulnerable to priority attacks such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Stone Edge targets Flying-types such as Zapdos, Galarian Moltres, Mantine, and Mandibuzz. Fire Fang hits Grass- and Steel-types such as Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela; the latter two are not phased by Garchomp's other attacks. Life Orb allows Garchomp to be a stronger wallbreaker and gives it crucial rolls such as OHKOing bulky Tapu Fini with Swords Dance-boosted Earthquake. Alternatively, Lum Berry can be used to give Garchomp a safer chance to set up against status users such as Blissey, Amoonguss, and Toxapex. Rough Skin allows Garchomp to better handle physical threats such as Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Hippowdon provides residual damage chip on foes such as Tapu Fini and Tapu Bulu with Stealth Rock and sand and makes it easier for Garchomp to break through them. Excadrill benefits from Hippowdon's sand thanks to Sand Rush and can aid Garchomp by revenge killing Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and clearing entry hazards. Garchomp and Excadrill also benefit from each other breaking down shared checks such as Slowbro and Mandibuzz, allowing the other an easier time sweeping. Gastrodon and Seismitoad offer Garchomp a Water immunity. Gastrodon is the more sustainable option, as it provides a more consistent switch-in to threats such as Barraskewda due to it having reliable recovery, while Seismitoad can deal with threats like Belly Drum Azumarill. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can revenge kill threats such as Dragapult and Tapu Koko, while Gravity Landorus-T allows both itself and Garchomp to check Celesteela, Skarmory, and Corviknight without relying on Fire Fang. Mamoswine takes on Flying-, Dragon-, and Grass-types such as Landorus-T, Latios, and Amoonguss with its powerful Ice-type attacks while also being able to revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragapult for Garchomp. Additionally, Mamoswine can remove items such as Slowbro's Heavy-Duty Boots and Tapu Lele's Choice Scarf, opening up avenues Garchomp to beat them. Nidoking can help Garchomp take on the Steel and Flying matchups, hitting all Steel-types with Earth Power + Flamethrower and all Flying-types with BoltBeam coverage, and take pressure off it. Nidoking can break through Pokemon such as Celesteela, Corviknight, and Skarmory for Garchomp; in return, Garchomp can break past special walls such as Blissey.

Since Lucario is a setup sweeper, try to set it up on Pokemon it can force out or Pokemon that can't touch it such as Galarian Corsola.</p> <p>All of its teammates appreciate its ability to take on Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon, as well as being able to revenge kill faster threats such as Excadrill with priority Vacuum Wave. Duraludon and Ferrothorn are Steel teams' main entry hazard setters and support Lucario by making its sweep easier. Corviknight can provide Lucario with a Ground-type immunity and can take on Ghost-type Pokemon for Lucario if it decides to not run Dark Pulse with Bulk Up + Power Trip. Aegislash, Excadrill, Durant, and Bisharp all appreciate its ability to help them break past physical walls; in return, they can take on Pokemon that Lucario struggles with such as Dragapult. Additionally, Bisharp and Aegislash can also help Lucario check faster threats with their priority moves in Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak, respectively. Excadrill also can clear entry hazards for Lucario with Rapid Spin and take on Electric-type Pokemon such as Dracozolt.</p>"

Meteor Mash is to help net KOs against slower Fairy-type Pokemon such as Togekiss and Clefable. Extreme Speed is used to be able to hit Pokemon like Salazzle and Dracovish. Lucario should try to set up on a predicted switch, on a passive Pokemon, or on a Pokemon it threatens out.

    "overview": "<h3>Ground</h3> <p>Hippowdon is an invaluable teammate on sand-based Ground teams thanks to its ability to automatically set sand, notably supporting a dangerous teammate in Excadrill. On top of that, its good physical bulk and useful utility options in Stealth Rock, Slack Off, and Whirlwind make it a good check to physical attackers like Garchomp, Dragapult, and Cinderace. However, Hippowdon's weaknesses to Water, Grass, and Ice leave it susceptible to attackers like Barraskewda, Rillaboom, and Kyurem. It's also overwhelmed by powerful special attackers like Tapu Lele, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Hydreigon due to its average Special Defense. Due to its reliance on Earthquake in order to deal damage, Hippowdon is typically passive and taken advantage of Taunt users like Zarude and Tapu Fini while being unable to damage Flying-types like Landorus-T, Corviknight, and Celesteela.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>Yawn can be used over Whirlwind to force out threats such as Celesteela, Corviknight, and Zapdos that can switch in with impunity while still helping against setup sweepers like Dragonite and Mimikyu. Toxic is another option over Whirlwind, punishing non-Poison-immune walls such as Mantine, Swampert, and Mandibuzz much more effectively; however, the utility from Whirlwind is generally more appreciated.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Because of Hippowdon's average special bulk, it is vulnerable to powerful special wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Spectrier, and Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers such as Zarude, Calm Mind + Taunt Tapu Fini, and Taunt Mew can easily shut down Hippowdon by forcing it to use Earthquake while preventing it from recovering with Slack Off or phazing setup attempts with Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic cripples Hippowdon by putting it on a timer, leaving it unable to check threats more consistently. Burn negates Leftovers recovery and significantly reduces the power of Earthquake, making Hippowdon more passive against foes like Scizor and Garchomp.</p>",

Slack Off allows it to wall threats like Cinderace more consistently and set sand more times throughout a match. Whirlwind phazes threatening setup sweepers such as Dragonite, Garchomp, and Mimikyu while being able to wear down foes in conjunction with sand and Stealth Rock damage. Forgoing Leftovers will slightly reduce Hippowdon's longevity, but Eject Button can be used over it to safely pivot out into a teammate like Excadrill once sand has been set up, allowing it to sweep more easily. Maximum HP investment with an Impish nature allows Hippowdon to take on threats like Bisharp, Excadrill, and Dragon Dance Dragapult more easily. 128 Special Defense EVs let it survive Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor and Tapu Koko's Grass Knot at full health. Hippowdon should be preserved in matchups like Fairy and Ice to set sand so that a teammate like Excadrill can sweep.</p> <p>Excadrill is a mandatory teammate for Hippowdon, as it greatly benefits from the sand that it sets thanks to Sand Rush. It can outspeed threats like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Choice Scarf Weavile, and Tapu Lele under sand, remove troublesome entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and deal with threatening Ice-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types such as Kyurem, Latias, and Tapu Bulu. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a Water immunity; Gastrodon's Recover lets it consistently check threats like Weavile and Barraskewda, while Seismitoad is useful to specifically check Azumarill. Nidoking can deal with troublesome Grass- and Flying-types for Hippowdon such as Ferrothorn, Tapu Bulu, Celesteela, and Mantine, as well as Steel teams, thanks to its amazing coverage. Additionally, it absorbs Toxic Spikes due to its part-Poison typing. Mamoswine is a fearsome wallbreaker that is especially useful in the Flying and Dragon matchups, as it deals with threats like Mandibuzz, Hydreigon, and Latias thanks to its Ice Shard.

Rest in conjunction with Sleep Talk may be considered over Poison Jab and Protect, as this turns Drapion into an extremely bulky roadblock that can be difficult for Psychic and Ghost teams to handle, but Sleep Talk's inconsistency makes this set undesirable. Brick Break may be considered to remove dual screens from Fairy and Dark teams, making Tapu Bulu, Galarian Moltres, and Hydreigon easier to revenge kill while also dealing heavy damage to Bisharp. However, Brick Break has narrower utility than Drapion's other moves. A stallbreaker set with Swords Dance, Taunt, Substitute, and Knock Off lets Drapion take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Ferrothorn, making it an offensive threat against Poison, Psychic, and Steel teams, as it only needs Knock Off to fulfill its role in Poison teams. However, Drapion can't become as immediately threatening as one expects from Swords Dance sweepers, and the lack of Poison Jab hurts its ability to threaten Tapu Bulu and Hatterene. A Choice Scarf set with Knock Off, Poison Jab, Toxic Spikes, and Earthquake or Ice Fang may be used, allowing it to offensively deal with threats such as Tapu Lele, Spectrier, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and/or Garchomp.

Knock Off, Battle Armor, and a slightly better Speed tier differentiate Drapion from Skuntank, at the cost of not having priority in Sucker Punch and better Special Defense. Knock Off forces progress on the opposing team by removing key items like Black Sludge, Light Clay, and Leftovers from Toxapex, Klefki, and Celesteela, respectively, and it also lets Drapion deal with Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Slowking, Alolan Raichu, and Aegislash. Poison Jab pressures Fairy-types like Hatterene, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele, which greatly threaten Poison teams. Protect scouts Choice-locked foes such as Tapu Lele and Excadrill, and it lets Black Sludge recover more health. Taunt shuts down Future Sight + Teleport sequences from Slowbro and Slowking, forcing the opponent to risk their switch-in losing its item. It also prevents Rotom-W and Braviary from removing entry hazards using Defog, annoys defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Galarian Corsola, and Celesteela, and prevents Bisharp and Clefable from using Drapion as setup fodder. Toxic Spikes takes advantage of switches Drapion forces against types like Fairy and Ghost and lets its teammate, Toxapex, run more useful moves. Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers like Spectrier, Hydreigon, and Galarian Moltres, and it's also particularly effective at wearing down teams in conjunction with Toxic Spikes. 56 Speed EVs let it outspeed and use Taunt on Adamant Bisharp and defensive variants of Rotom-W, while the remaining EVs maximize its special bulk to better check threats such as Hatterene and Gengar.</p> <p>Drapion's Special Defense is inferior to Skuntank's, so secondary switch-ins to Latios, Choice Specs Jirachi, and Tapu Lele are highly recommended, making Galarian Slowking an excellent teammate. Galarian Slowking also wears down Heatran and Clefable for it, and it's a great special wall that checks other special attackers such as Nihilego and Kyurem for Poison teams. Amoonguss deals with Ground- and Water-type threats like Choice Scarf Excadrill, Garchomp, and Urshifu-R, and in return it loves Drapion's ability to stop Future Sight + Teleport sequences, which heavily pressure it. Toxapex is a general wall that deals with threats such as Cinderace and Mimikyu, and it can provide Toxic Spikes, which makes Whirlwind less passive if Drapion lacks Toxic Spikes itself. Crobat and Galarian Weezing are partners immune to Ground that remove entry hazards, with the former able to cripple Substitute users like Kyurem, Hydreigon, and Bulk Up Landorus-T with Toxic, and the latter threatening Dragon- and Dark-types such as Dragonite, Hydreigon, and Galarian Moltres. Nidoking provides an immunity to Electric, checks threats like Regieleki and Tapu Koko, pressures Steel- and Flying-types such as Heatran, Corviknight, and Mantine, and optionally sets Stealth Rock to wear down opposing teams. Nihilego can switch into and pressure Hydreigon and Galarian Moltres in a pinch, appreciates Drapion wearing down its checks in Celesteela and Slowking, and can clean Flying and Fire teams late-game with a Meteor Beam or Choice Scarf set.</p>"

Poison Jab is used to handle Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Gardevoir. Toxic can be used to cripple bulky Pokemon on the switch, such as Hippowdon, and Toxic Spikes helps Dark against some types, such as Fairy and Dragon. Toxic Spikes also allows offensive teammates such as Hydreigon and Grimmsnarl to break opposing teams more consistently. Furthermore, Drapion's part-Poison typing absorbs the opposing Toxic Spikes. Toxic should be used in cases where the opposing team has no Pokemon immune to it, such as Fairy-types, and against fast threats and setup sweepers to limit their effectiveness, and Toxic Spikes should be used against types that lack proper entry hazard removal such as Grass.</p> <p>With its part-Poison typing and acceptable offensive stats, Drapion can handle most Fairy-type Pokemon, thus making it a good teammate to most Dark-type Pokemon. Offensive Pokemon such as Bisharp and Hydreigon make good teammates to Drapion, as they benefit well from Toxic Spikes, which allows the aforementioned Pokemon to break opposing teams more consistently. Furthermore, Hydreigon can switch into Ground-type attacks thanks to its Levitate, and Bisharp's part-Steel typing gives Drapion a bit of freedom with checking Fairy-types. With its access to Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave, Tyranitar performs a good hazard-stacking and status-spreading core with Drapion. Mandibuzz is another decent teammate with its capability of switching into Ground-type attacks for Drapion and forms a good core with it thanks to their neutrality to Fighting-type attacks.

However, Toxicroak's Speed is quite lackluster, as it finds itself unable to outspeed and remove threats such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem, and Mimikyu without Thunder Wave support from Cobalion.

    "overview": "<h3>Electric</h3> <p>Magnezone's Magnet Pull allows it to serve as an effective trapper for Electric teams, taking advantage of threatening Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Choice-locked Excadrill by setting up on them with Iron Defense and eliminating them with Body Press. Its Steel typing provides many useful resistances to types like Dragon, Poison, Psychic, and Ice, allowing it to handle foes like Dragon Dance Dragapult, Nihilego, Latias, and Alolan Ninetales with ease. However, Magnezone is held back by its subpar Speed stat, leaving it vulnerable to attackers such as Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, and Victini. Due to Magnezone's weaknesses to Fire and Fighting, it is unable to properly check Pokemon that it otherwise would such as Heatran, Rillaboom, and Tapu Lele because they carry coverage against it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Electric</h4> <p>A Choice Specs set can be used to turn Magnezone into a powerful wallbreaker, being more successful in matchups such as Poison and Fairy; however, teammates such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos already carry Choice Specs, making it undesirable. Leftovers can be used over Air Balloon to provide Magnezone with longevity; however, forgoing Air Balloon makes it unable to deal with Ground-types like Excadrill and Mamoswine. Magnet Rise is an option to make Magnezone completely immune to Ground-type attacks, even after Air Balloon has been popped.</p> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be used to revenge kill and threaten faster Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Volcanion, and Galarian Moltres; however, such a role is more suited to Magneton due to its higher Speed, letting it outspeed faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Tornadus-T. Steel Beam can be used to do massive amounts of damage to Ground-types like Gastrodon; however it comes at the cost of cutting Magnezone's HP in half which wears it down very quickly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Electric</h4> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Generally powerful wallbreakers such as Spectrier, Kingdra, and Crawdaunt can easily break through Magnezone with their powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Volcarona</strong>: Volcarona is able to easily come into Magnezone's attacks, force it out with its Fire-type moves, and set up on it with Quiver Dance, becoming a major threat to Electric teams.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Walls such as Galarian Slowking and SubToxic Aegislash are very annoying for Magnezone to deal with, as it cannot make much progress against them. Galarian Slowking can 2HKO Magnezone with Flamethrower, while Aegislash wears it down with Shadow Ball and can set Substitute in front of it.</p>",

Body Press synergizes incredibly well with Iron Defense, as it takes advantage of the boosts from it to hit hard. It also hits Steel- and Normal-types such as Excadrill, Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Porygon2 super effectively. Flash Cannon hits foes that are resistant to Body Press like Dragapult, Tapu Bulu, Alolan Ninetales, and Hatterene. Substitute lets Magnezone set up in front of the previously mentioned foes, making it hard for special attackers like Nidoking, Tapu Lele, and Hydreigon to revenge kill it. It also lets Magnezone avoid status from foes like Gastrodon and Leech Seed from Ferrothorn. Discharge can be used instead for a way to nail Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex, Pelipper, Mantine, and Celesteela. Air Balloon is needed to let Magnezone act as an emergency check to Ground-types like Excadrill and Mamoswine. The given EV spread allows Magnezone to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt. It also survives Excadrill's Earthquake after an Iron Defense boost if Air Balloon has been popped. Make sure to preserve Air Balloon if the opponent has Excadrill so Magnezone can successfully trap and remove it.</p> <p>Powerful wallbreakers such as Tapu Koko, Choice Specs Zapdos, and Regieleki appreciate Magnezone trapping Steel-types such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn, making their STAB moves much more spammable against Steel teams. Tapu Koko deals with Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types that Magnezone struggles against such as Galarian Zapdos, Hydreigon, and Garchomp thanks to its Fairy-type STAB attack. Additionally, it defeats Ground-types like Hippowdon, Swampert, and Seismitoad with Grass Knot. Zeraora deals with specially defensive walls that Magnezone fails to take on with Body Press, such as Galarian Slowking and SubToxic Aegislash. Alolan Raichu can outspeed almost the entire metagame under Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain, handling fast threats such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Choice Scarf Terrakion, Spectrier, and Volcarona for Magnezone. Additionally, it removes troublesome Poison- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss, Keldeo, and Buzzwole with Psychic and takes on Ground-types such as Swampert and Gastrodon with Grass Knot. Zapdos and Rotom-W both appreciate Magnezone acting as an emergency check to Ground-types like Excadrill and Mamoswine with Air Balloon. Choice Specs Zapdos defeats Grass-types that can pressure Magnezone such as Rillaboom, Celebi, and Tapu Bulu while also nailing Dragon- and Ground-types such as Swampert, Kommo-o, and Hippowdon with its powerful Hurricane. Rotom-W provides useful resistances against Fire- and Water-type attacks, preventing Pokemon such as Blacephalon, Cinderace, and Barraskewda from breaking through Magnezone and the rest of the team.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Thanks to Magnet Pull and STAB Electric-type attacks, Magnezone is able to trap and eliminate Steel-types such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight for physical attackers like Excadrill, Melmetal, and Bisharp. Thunderbolt helps Magnezone deal with the problematic aforementioned Flying-types while also dealing with Water-type Pokemon such as Toxapex and defensive Pelipper. Flash Cannon gives Magnezone a strong STAB move against Pokemon like Hydreigon, Amoongus, Landorus-T, and Nidoking that resist Thunderbolt. Volt Switch helps to keep momentum and bring in a teammate while also letting Magnezone pivot out of incoming special sponges like Galarian Slowking, Chansey, and Dragalge. Toxic catches Thundurus-T, Swampert, and Gastrodon switching in and puts them on a timer. A Modest nature can be used for extra power,but it misses out on outspeeding Pokemon like Adamant Bisharp and Arctozolt.</p> <p>Magnezone provides slow Volt Switch support to bring teammates in safely and helps to improve the matchup against opposing Steel-type teams. In return, physical attackers such as Excadrill, Bisharp, and Melmetal deal with special walls like Galarian Slowking and Chansey. Bisharp also compensates for Magnezone's slow Speed with priority Sucker Punch. Aside from taking care of Steel- and Flying-type Pokemon, Magnezone also guarantees damage on defensive Heatran, which makes it possible for teammates like Excadrill and Heatran to clean Steel-type teams. Heatran and Ferrothorn are good teammates, as the former can cover it against Fire-type Pokemon like Victini, Volcarona, and Blacephalon, while the latter can check Water-type Pokemon like Swampert, and Seismitoad, with STAB Power Whip. Ground-immune Pokemon like Skarmory and Celesteela can take on Ground-types like Excadrill, Garchomp, and Landorus-T that threaten Magnezone. Additionally, Skarmory also provides entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes and can phaze away setup sweepers like Dragonite, Aegislash, and Garchomp. Celesteela can weaken opposing teams with Leech Seed and Protect, making it easier for Magnezone to beat opposing teams. Aegislash can not only switch into Fighting-type moves from Galarian Zapdos and Urshifu-R for the team, but also gradually weaken Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Ferrothorn with its SubToxic set. Corviknight can provide U-turn support to bring Magnezone in against Steel-types to trap and eliminate them; this helps Corviknight run boosting sets more efficiently, as its checks such as Celesteela and Toxapex are taken care of by Magnezone.</p>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<h3>Fairy</h3> <p>Togekiss is an effective stallbreaker on Fairy teams that helps break down defensive types like Poison, Grass, and Steel. Its ability Serene Grace synergizes with Air Slash, allowing it to threaten defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowking, Amoonguss, Galarian Weezing, and Cradily. Furthermore, its Flying typing gives the team a secondary check to Grass- and Ground-types alongside Tapu Bulu, as it can check Rillaboom, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. After Nasty Plot, Togekiss becomes a threatening wallbreaker to slower and more defensive teams. However, Togekiss struggles to find a place on Fairy teams due to its mediocre physical bulk and middling Speed. Togekiss is often restricted from switching in freely, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and Fairy teams tend to lack Defoggers due to their preference to stack entry hazards with Klefki and Clefable. However, this can be mitigated by using Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>A Choice Scarf set makes Togekiss's Air Slash more annoying while still providing utility in the form of Defog and Trick. However, this set is highly inconsistent and struggles to deal meaningful damage.

However, this set still has trouble beating Heatran without several flinches, since it resists Air Slash and has Roar to phaze Togekiss.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn negates Leftovers recovery on Togekiss and makes it unable to effectively stallbreak, paralysis lowers its Speed and renders the flinch chance of Air Slash useless, and Toxic puts Togekiss on a timer. Be especially wary of Crobat's Toxic, which goes through Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock limits Togekiss's ability to switch in and take advantage of passive Pokemon with Substitute and Nasty Plot. However, this weakness can be covered by using Heavy-Duty Boots instead of Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Physical Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Choice Band Zeraora, Weavile, and Choice Band Victini outspeed Togekiss and OHKO it with a super effective move.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Ice Shard from Choice Band Mamoswine and Bullet Punch from Life Orb Scizor OHKO Togekiss after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran can freely switch in to Togekiss's Fire-type coverage and threaten it with Toxic. However, Heatran is 2HKOed by +2 Aura Sphere.</p> <p><strong>Melmetal</strong>: Melmetal is not OHKOed by unboosted Fire Blast or Flamethrower, can survive +2 Fire Blast if holding an Assault Vest, and can OHKO Togekiss with Double Iron Bash even through Substitute.

        "description": "<p>Air Slash punishes slower Pokemon attempting to take on Togekiss such as Toxapex, Slowking, and Blissey. Fire Blast OHKOes Steel-types like Ferrothorn, while Flamethrower can be used for better accuracy at the cost of damage. Substitute allows Togekiss to set up on passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Toxapex and Amoonguss without fear of getting statused. Aura Sphere can be used over Substitute to threaten Heatran and Tyranitar, which otherwise wall this set. Nasty Plot increases Togekiss's wallbreaking power and allows it to OHKO Celesteela, Melmetal, and Tyranitar. If running Fire Blast, a Modest nature may be considered to OHKO Aegislash and Magnezone. Leftovers synergizes with Air Slash's ability to make foes flinch and improves Togekiss's longevity. Alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots can be used on sets with three attacks to improve Togekiss's ability to switch in.</p> <p>Klefki is an excellent partner to Togekiss, as it can set up dual screens to make Togekiss extremely hard to take down and set Spikes to pressure the opposing team. Dual screens also enable Belly Drum Azumarill, another setup sweeper that can be used in tandem with Togekiss to decimate Steel and Poison matchups. Azumarill also helps Togekiss by removing Rock-type Pokemon like Nihilego and Tyranitar with its strong Water-type attacks and specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking with Knock Off. Togekiss greatly appreciates fast pivots that can bring it in on a predicted switch. U-turn or Volt Switch Tapu Koko is especially good at this, as it invites walls such as Ferrothorn for Togekiss to take advantage of and provides a fast Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock from being set. Clefable provides Stealth Rock, which chips down Togekiss's targets and allows it to pick off defensive Pokemon more easily. Tapu Bulu handles Electric- and Rock-types like Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, and Tyranitar. Tapu Lele takes on faster Poison-types such as Nidoking and can take advantage of Togekiss's wallbreaking to clean late-game with Choice Scarf.</p>"

It also performs as a strong wallbreaker due to its nearly unresisted STAB combination. Mamoswine's typing, in combination with its ability Thick Fat, allows it to switch into Ice-type moves from Alolan Ninetales, Kyurem, Cloyster, or Arctozolt. Mamoswine, however, is fairly slow, so it must rely on Ice Shard to deal with faster foes. Its typing is horrible defensively, and its bulk is only average, which reduces the number of opportunities it gets to wallbreak. Lastly, Mamoswine's reliance on Choice Band to wallbreak effectively makes it easier to play around and take advantage of through scouting.</p>",

Never-Melt Ice may be considered over Choice Band to switch moves; however, the drop in power prevents Mamoswine from 2HKOing Celesteela with Icicle Crash after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage, OHKOing Thundurus-T with Ice Shard, and OHKOing Amoonguss with Icicle Crash. An Assault Vest set with an investment such as 4 HP / 184 Atk / 136 SpD / 184 Spe with an Adamant Nature may be considered to better check Kyurem and act as a buffer against threats such as Tapu Lele and Zapdos, but the reduced Attack hampers Mamoswine's potential to clean types such as Dragon late-game and the reduced Speed lets Tapu Bulu now outspeed and threaten Mamoswine out. A Choice Scarf set with a Jolly nature may be considered to surprise threats such as Zapdos and Kyurem, and also outspeed the entire unboosted metagame bar Regieleki. However, Mamoswine will be outsped by all the other relevant Choice Scarf users and its damage output is lackluster without a Choice Band.</p> <h4>Ice</h4> <p>Mamoswine is capable of utilizing Focus Sash + Oblivious to function as a Stealth Rock lead, but it doesn't have the immediate power that Choice Band provides and it faces competition as a Stealth Rock setter from Piloswine.

Earthquake deals with Steel- and Water-types that resist Icicle Crash such as Aegislash and Toxapex. Superpower heavily dents Pokemon that are not bothered by the first two moves, such as Porygon2, Cloyster, Air Balloon Heatran, and Ferrothorn. Knock Off may be considered over Superpower to cripple physical walls such as Slowbro, Galarian Corsola, and Rotom-W. Ice Shard allows Mamoswine to revenge kill weakened threats such as Hydreigon, Galarian Moltres, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. It also lets it clean up Flying and Dragon teams late-game when their walls have been sufficiently chipped. A Choice Band allows Mamoswine to OHKO walls such as Amoonguss, Zapdos, and Toxapex with the appropriate STAB move.

Gastrodon provides a Water immunity, can spread Toxic to wear down the opposing team, and can take special attacks aimed at Mamoswine. Alternatively, Seismitoad may be considered as the Water-immune partner, as it can check Azumarill, which usually poses a huge threat for Ground teams. Landorus-T provides Gravity support to allow Mamoswine to break through checks such as Rotom-W and Celesteela that can normally wall it. Swords Dance Garchomp can work alongside Mamoswine to break through their shared checks such as Slowbro and Kyurem when facing Psychic and Dragon teams. Nidoking deals with physical walls such as Slowbro and Ferrothorn that Mamoswine struggles with.

Ice Shard provides priority and aids in revenge killing the likes of Agility Galarian Moltres, Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T. Superpower grants Mamoswine the ability to break past bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Porygon2. Heavy Slam can be used to reliably defeat setup sweepers such as Hatterene and Clefable. Knock Off is a great utility option that allows Mamoswine to get rid of important items such as Eviolite from Chansey, Porygon2, and Piloswine as well as recovery items from Ferrothorn and Slowbro.

Cloyster values Mamoswines immunity to Electric-type moves from Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Alolan Raichu, while also setting Spikes to support Mamoswine's wallbreaking by providing chip damage against foes. Aurora Veil Alolan Ninetales allows Mamoswine to tank more hits and wallbreak for a prolonged period of time; Alolan Ninetales also checks threats such as Urshifu-R and Kommo-o. Galarian Darmanitan can use Flare Blitz to KO Ferrothorn for non-Superpower Mamoswine and also lures Ground-immune Steel-types like Corviknight and Celesteela.

Against Steel, Rotom-H should look to set up Substitute against Ferrothorn in order to beat more Pokemon with Overheat. Substitute is also good because it enables Rotom-H to set up in front of Bisharp's Sucker Punch and force Aegislash to change to Blade forme to take it on, allowing Rotom-H to deal with these Pokemon more consistently especially against Steel teams. Thunderbolt hits Pokemon such as Toxapex and Corviknight for super effective damage while OHKOing Pokemon such as Indeedee and Gengar after a Nasty Plot boost without having to rely on Overheat along with its Special Attack drops. Maximum Speed combined with a Timid nature allows Rotom-H to outspeed Pokemon like Indeedee-F, Mamoswine, and Diggersby as well as other Pokemon like Choice Scarf Duraludon if Sticky Web is set.</p> <p>The entirety of Electric teams appreciates Rotom-H's ability to beat Steel teams effectively. Galvantula and Vikavolt set Sticky Web for Rotom-H, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Duraludon, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Salazzle. Alolan Raichu is a good revenge killer under Electric Terrain, being able to take on Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Excadrill, which check Rotom-H. The latter is extremely important, as it can beat Rotom-H with Earthquake if it is not behind a Substitute. Pincurchin sets Spikes and Toxic Spikes, wearing down the opposing team for Rotom-H, and can slow down Pokemon like Gengar with Thunder Wave and give Rotom-H setup opportunities with Memento. Zeraora is a great physical wallbreaker, being able to take on special walls like Snorlax and Tyranitar with its high Attack paired with Choice Band as well as Dragon-type Pokemon like Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Dracovish with Play Rough. In return, Rotom-H can break past a lot of the Pokemon Zeraora struggles with such as Galarian Corsola, Torkoal, and Vileplume with Nasty Plot. Toxtricity is another special sweeper with Shift Gear that works together with Rotom-H to take on types like Psychic, Grass, Fairy, Ice, and Poison. Morpeko can break dual screens using Psychic Fangs to help Rotom-H wallbreak and bring Rotom-H in safely using Parting Shot. It can also beat Pokemon like Gastrodon and Seismitoad with Seed Bomb for Rotom-H.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp is good for burning physical attackers such as Bisharp and Mimikyu while Toxic is important for allowing Rotom-W to beat Pokemon such as Seismitoad and Gastrodon that would wall it otherwise, making it even better against Ground teams.

Rotom-W also pairs well with Vikavolt, which provides a secondary Ground-type immunity. Heliolisk can also pair well with Rotom-W due to its immunity to Water-type attacks, which also relieves the pressure from Rotom-W to deal with strong Water-type Pokemon.

Substitute allows Rotom-W to set up on more passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Pelipper, Mandibuzz, and Jellicent, posing a huge threat to types such as Water, Ghost, and Dark. Thunderbolt and Hydro Pump are Rotom-W's STAB moves, with Hydro Pump being especially strong under rain. Thunderbolt hits everything on Water bar Seismitoad and the uncommon Gastrodon, and Hydro Pump beats them both if they are Swift Swim and Sticky Hold, respectively. Dark Pulse is an alternative option over Hydro Pump in order to hit Pokemon such as Celebi, Seismitoad, and Ferrothorn. Generally, Rotom-W should try to look for opportunities to punch holes in the opposition early- to mid-game for other sweepers like Barraskewda and Seismitoad to sweep late-game, since Rotom-W won't be sweeping by itself most of the time. A Timid nature along with maximum Speed investment is used to outspeed Pokemon such as Gyarados and Togekiss that can be problematic to deal with otherwise.</p> <p>Pelipper's Drizzle is great for boosting Rotom-W's Hydro Pump, and Pelipper can bring in Rotom-W safely with U-turn. Keldeo primarily is an amazing partner for Rotom-W because it can beat Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Hydreigon that would otherwise be problematic, while Keldeo appreciates Rotom-W's ability to beat Flying-type Pokemon such as Togekiss and Corviknight for it. Other offensive Pokemon like Seismitoad, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Dracovish appreciate Rotom-W's role as a early- to mid-game wallbreaker in order to sweep teams late-game. Rotom-W also appreciates said Pokemon to beat Pokemon that it can't, such as Ferrothorn, while outspeeding faster Pokemon such as Indeedee, Hydreigon, and Dragapult. Toxapex is a good partner for Rotom-W because of its access to Toxic Spikes, which helps with types such as Normal, Psychic, and Fairy. Toxapex is also great as a defensive pivot, being able to switch into attacks such as Ferrothorn's Power Whip for Rotom-W. Araquanid is a good partner for Rotom-W because of its ability to set Sticky Web and slow down faster Pokemon such as Mew, Indeedee, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir for it to outspeed.

Defog prevents the team from being overwhelmed with entry hazards, especially Spikes and Sticky Web; Levitate is especially great with Defog, as it allows Rotom-W to avoid all hazards bar Stealth Rock. Spikes is obnoxious to deal with because it chips almost all of Rotom-W's teammates down, and Sticky Web slows down offensive Pokemon such as Barraskewda, Dracovish, Keldeo, and Seismitoad, making sweeping relatively harder. Will-O-Wisp is used to cripple physical attackers such as Bisharp and Mimikyu, while Thunder Wave can be used to slow down faster Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Duraludon and Dragapult for the team. Volt Switch should be used liberally to grab momentum, whether against Pokemon Rotom-W can't outright beat such as Reuniclus and Snorlax, faster Pokemon, or forced switches. Rotom-W should generally look for opportunities to pivot into resisted attacks such as Seismitoad's Hydro Pump and Togekiss's Air Slash so it can use Defog safety and grab momentum. However, it does lack a form of reliable recovery, so be careful when switching it into stronger attacks and preserve its HP.</p> <p>The entire Water team appreciates Rotom-W's ability to remove hazards. Pokemon such as Pelipper and Toxapex in particular hate getting chipped by Stealth Rock and Spikes, as it limits their ability to switch in and do their job well. Offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo, Crawdaunt, Dracovish, Barraskewda, and Cloyster also hate taking chip damage and struggle with Sticky Web, as they rely on their Speed stats to consistently threaten the opposing team. Rotom-W can also pivot into stronger attacks for the aforementioned offensive Pokemon and can use Volt Switch in order to grab momentum, giving them a safe switch. In return, many of these offensive Pokemon can use the safe switch in to beat Pokemon that Rotom-W can't such as Ferrothorn, Indeedee, Hydreigon, and Dragapult. Rotom-W appreciates Pokemon such as Dracovish, Pelipper, Seismitoad, and Mantine, as they are able to threaten Celebi for it. Toxapex is a good defensive Pokemon that pairs well with Rotom-W because of its ability to absorb status from Pokemon such as Drapion and Mandibuzz, and it can pivot into stronger attacks such as Roserade's Leaf Storm and Lucario's Focus Blast for Rotom-W.

Nasty Plot allows Rotom-C to serve as a setup sweeper by beating Pokemon such as Hatterene, Bisharp, and Excadrill after a boost, while Substitute also allows it to set up on status users such as Seismitoad, Pokemon that are unable to deal significant damage to Rotom-C such as Toxapex, and forced switches, as well as helping against Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Thunderbolt is valuable coverage that hits Pokemon such as Corviknight and Toxapex for super effective damage, as well as Pokemon like Aegislash, Bisharp, Jirachi, Salazzle, and Galarian Weezing neutrally. Leaf Storm is Rotom-C's stronger STAB attack that hits the aforementioned Ground-type Pokemon and can beat bulkier Pokemon, such as Mew, Hatterene, and Gardevoir, with a Nasty Plot boost. Although its bulk is not the best, Rotom-C can serve as an answer to certain offensive Pokemon using its typing, such as Barraskewda and Seismitoad under rain, but shouldn't set up on other hard-hitting offensive Pokemon such as Indeedee and Dragapult that threaten to OHKO or heavily dent it.</p> <p>The entirety of Electric appreciates Rotom-C's ability to serve as a reliable answer to Ground-type Pokemon, seeing as Electric teams struggle immensely against them otherwise. In return, Sticky Web setters such as Galvantula and Vikavolt are good partners for Rotom-C, as they patch up its middling Speed and allow it to outspeed Pokemon such as Choice Specs Indeedee, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Choice Specs Gengar, and Mimikyu, paving the way for it to sweep. Choice Band Zeraora is a fantastic wallbreaker that can take on faster Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Cinderace, and Dragapult and forms an offensive core with Rotom-C. Zeraora's ability to wallbreak early-game and beat Dragon- and Steel-type Pokemon with Play Rough, Plasma Fists, and Close Combat is fantastic for Rotom-C to sweep weakened teams or vice versa. Toxtricity is another special attacker that can beat Grass-type Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Vileplume, and Roserade for Rotom-C. Alolan Raichu is a powerful wallbreaker that can outspeed and beat threats such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Choice Scarf Gengar, and Choice Scarf Excadrill for Rotom-C under Electric Terrain. Pincurchin can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes as well as use Memento to weaken the opponent and bring Rotom-C in for it to set up and sweep. Morpeko is amazing against Psychic and Ghost teams and can bring Rotom-C in with Parting Shot while the stat drops help it set up.

Use Substitute on passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex to avoid status and set up with Nasty Plot. Thunderbolt makes Rotom-C able to take on Flying-types such as Corviknight and Mandibuzz. Dark Pulse is used for neutral damage and greatly helping with Ferrothorn, Seismitoad, and Excadrill and Ghost- and Psychic-types like Aegislash and Celebi.

Rotom-C loves entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Roserade to sweep more easily mid- to late-game and in particular likes Ferrothorn thanks to its Steel typing allowing it to come in on Ice-type attacks. Appletun forms a good defensive core with Ferrothorn because its Dragon typing and Thick Fat makes it able to come in on Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult and Charizard. Virizion makes a great partner due to its ability to take on Charizard and Centiskorch with Stone Edge, OHKO Alolan Ninetales with Smart Strike and Steel-type Pokemon like Excadrill. Leech Seed users such as Ferrothorn, Appletun, and Whimsicott are good partners for Rotom-C, as they wear down opposing Pokemon for it while helping it set up by providing it with more passive recovery. Whimsicott can be used for its Substitute + Leech Seed to chip Pokemon down and make it easier for Rotom-C to clean up. Whimsicott's Fairy typing and access to Moonblast also help greatly in the Dragon- and the Dark-type matchup with pressuring and taking care of Hydreigon and Grimmsnarl. Whimsicott can also use Heat Rock and Sunny Day to make Venusaur and Celebi turn into dangerous sweepers that greatly help in the Steel-type matchup, taking care of Pokemon that Rotom-C has trouble with such as Duraludon with Growth-boosted Weather Ball or Nasty Plot-boosted Earth Power.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Steel</h3> <p>Heatran is a key Pokemon for Steel teams thanks to Flash Fire's ability to absorb Fire-type attacks such as V-create from Victini. Heatran has excellent typing with decent defensive stats, which contributes to its good special bulk. Heatran also has access to a variety of utility options; Toxic and Lava Plume allow it to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Mantine, Galarian Corsola, and Rotom-W, Taunt allows it to block utility moves like Leech Seed, Stealth Rock, and Recover from slower Pokemon such as Celesteela, Galarian Corsola, and Toxapex, and Stealth Rock lets Ferrothorn dedicate its slot to Spikes. However, Heatran's Fire typing compounds Steel teams' natural weaknesses; it stacks the Ground-type weakness for its team against foes like Garchomp and creates a weakness against Water-types such as Barraskewda. Heatran also has mediocre Speed and is forced to switch out against fast physical threats such as Urshifu-R, Barraskewda, Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Heatran lacks proper recovery and is reliant on Leftovers, which directly affects its longevity during the battle as it doesn't like taking hits from other Pokemon.</p>",

Earth Power is used mainly for opposing Heatran and hits Toxapex as well as Electric-types such as Alolan Raichu and Tapu Koko. Toxic cripples foes that Heatran cannot reliably beat, like Mantine, Slowbro, and Porygon2. Heatran's excellent typing and natural bulk make it one of the best Stealth Rock setters, as it forces a lot of switches. However, Taunt allows it to be an effective stallbreaker if another teammate is carrying Stealth Rock. A specially defensive spread with a Calm nature gives Heatran a better matchup against foes such as Tornadus-T and Latios. Leftovers mitigates Heatran's lack of natural recovery. Flash Fire is the preferred ability, as it allows Heatran to absorb Fire-type attacks.</p> <p>Heatran's presence is appreciated by every Steel-type, as it is the only reliable answer to Fire-types such as Victini. Ferrothorn is one of Heatran's best teammates; Heatran can take Fire-type attacks for Ferrothorn, while Ferrothorn can take Water-type attacks for it and threaten Water-types with Power Whip. In addition, Ferrothorn's Spikes synergizes with Lava Plume and Toxic to accrue chip damage on foes, while Taunt from Heatran prevents Defog from foes like Mantine and maintains Spikes. Celesteela, Skarmory, and Corviknight all make good partners for Heatran, as their typing allows them to switch into Ground-type coverage directed at Heatran. Moreover, Celesteela heals Heatran with Leech Seed and helps against checks such as Swampert, Skarmory provides Spikes and Whirlwind for passive damage while Heatran deters Defog with Taunt, and Corviknight's Pressure allows the duo to make better progress against bulky teams. Excadrill removes entry hazards that harm Heatran, as it already has limited recovery. Moreover, Excadrill can absorb Electric-type attacks for Heatran from foes like Choice Specs Tapu Koko, check opposing Heatran, and, with a Choice Scarf set, clean weakened teams. Aegislash takes care of Fighting-type coverage such as Focus Blast from Tapu Lele and Alakazam. Moreover, Toxic + Substitute Aegislash contributes to Heatran's stallbreaking. Bisharp helps Heatran stallbreak with Knock Off, removing crucial items such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Mantine and Pelipper and Eviolite from Porygon2 and Galarian Corsola. Bisharp also contributes to Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups effectively by threatening faster Pokemon such as Victini, Latios, Gengar, and Dragapult with Sucker Punch and getting free Knock Offs against slower Pokemon such as Slowbro, Galarian Slowking, and Galarian Corsola. Assault Vest Melmetal can take a few hits from specially offensive Pokemon that threaten Heatran, such as Tapu Lele. Calm Mind Jirachi can take advantage of Pokemon that Heatran cannot reliably beat, such as Toxapex and Mantine, while also taking on Dragon-types like Kyurem and Hydreigon.</p>"

Eruption takes advantage of Heatran attacking first, threatening Tapu Koko, non-Choice Scarf Zarude, and Nidoking. Flash Fire-boosted Eruption is hard to check, threatening even walls such as Gastrodon, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex. Flamethrower is a consistent STAB move in case Heatran gets damaged; it also cleans Grass and Steel teams late-game. Earth Power picks off weakened Fire-types like Cinderace and Victini. Dragon Pulse threatens Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Hydreigon. Flash Cannon is Heatran's best option against Cradily and Fire-neutral Ice-types such as Kyurem and Thick Fat Mamoswine.</p> <p>Heatran provides a Fire-type immunity for its team and can revenge kill threats like Nidoking and Mamoswine. Substitute + Toxic Aegislash is a good teammate, as it deters Galarian Zapdos, Thundurus-T, and Choice Band Zeraora from using Fighting-type moves. Additionally, it wears down walls such as Mantine and Slowbro for Heatran. Celesteela, Corviknight and Skarmory are immune to Ground-type attacks, which lets them check threats to Heatran such as Excadrill and Garchomp. Ferrothorn deals with Water-types such as Barraskewda and Tapu Fini, chips Garchomp and Landorus-T with Leech Seed, and sets up entry hazards. Excadrill uses Rapid Spin so that Heatran can stay healthy enough to utilize Eruption. Additionally, Excadrill can use Swords Dance + Earthquake to remove Toxapex, one of Heatran's strongest checks. Melmetal checks Zeraora, which is still faster than Heatran, and breaks specially defensive walls such as Chansey and Slowking.

Air Balloon grants a one-time immunity to Ground-type attacks, which allows it to check Stakataka and Mamoswine. Magma Storm, in conjunction with Taunt, allows Heatran to trap and break through walls such as Toxapex and Chansey, which are otherwise difficult for Fire teams to break through.

Choice Scarf Blacephalon is capable of defeating Slowking, which Heatran struggles against, and it appreciates Heatran weakening specially defensive walls with Magma Storm chip damage. Choice Band Victini forms a wallbreaking core with Heatran, as it can do immense damage to threats such as Landorus-T and Excadrill with V-Create as well as pressure troublesome Water-types like Mantine with Bolt Strike. Volcanion is mandatory on Fire teams due to its ability to absorb Water-type attacks from Tapu Fini, Barraskewda, and Azumarill. Additionally, Volcanion is capable of using Defog to get rid of Stealth Rock, which Fire teams are prone to. Moltres is capable of switching into Fighting-type attacks from Galarian Zapdos and Buzzwole while also providing Defog to remove entry hazards. Torkoal allows Heatran to use Flash Cannon over Stealth Rock and boosts Magma Storm with Drought. Incineroar is able to pivot Heatran in with Parting Shot and supports Heatran's wallbreaking ability by removing held items with Knock Off.

Its threat is bolstered by Victini's decent natural Speed, allowing it to threaten nearly all defensive Pokemon. With Bolt Strike, Victini helps Fire in Flying and Water matchups, dealing with slower Flying- and Water-type Pokemon that can handle V-create outside of sun such as Moltres, Mantine, Toxapex, and Slowbro. Victini's ability to generate momentum with U-turn is yet another asset for Fire teams. However, a ton of offensive threats such as Terrakion, Blacephalon, and Zygarde-10% can outspeed and OHKO Victini with their STAB attacks.

Shuca Berry may be considered in conjunction with Glaciate, as this allows Victini to lure and defeat Dragon Dance Dragonite and Garchomp in a one-on-one, while also defeating threats such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Victini to deal with threats such as Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, non-Choice Scarf Zarude, and Tapu Koko. Heavy-Duty Boots Victini can run a variety of moves over U-turn or Substitute to improve its matchup against certain types. Scorching Sands snipes Heatran, and Will-O-Wisp cripples Sucker Punch users such as Bisharp and switch-ins such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon. Encore locks Pokemon such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn into undesirable moves. Glaciate allows Victini to threaten Flying and Ground teams better due it beating checks such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, Expanding Force threatens Toxapex, and Energy Ball heavily damages Gastrodon and Swampert, allowing Victini to use its coverage to threaten Water teams more freely. However, these more situational options worsen Victini's performance in other matchups. Blue Flare may be used over V-create to circumvent the latter's Speed drop, letting Victini sweep Steel teams much more easily, but Psychic teams highly value V-create due to its physical nature. Brick Break may be used over U-turn on Choice item sets to remove dual screens from types such as Dark and Fairy, as well as 2HKOing Heatran after Stealth Rock damage. However, U-turn is generally preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Gengar, Garchomp, Terrakion, and Barraskewda are examples of Pokemon that outspeed and easily OHKO Victini.</p> <p><strong>Fire-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Since Victini primarily wallbreaks with V-create, Pokemon that resist Fire such as Gastrodon can switch into Victini.

Volcarona can break through checks to Victini such as Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Swampert with its Psychic and Giga Drain. Victini can threaten special walls such as Blissey in return. Rotom-H beats Mantine on Flying teams to give Victini freedom to spam V-create, switches into strong Electric-types such as Regieleki and Tapu Koko, and provides support in Defog and dual screens. Heatran uses its Rock neutrality and Dragon resistance to check threats to Victini such as Nihilego and Latias. Choice Scarf Blacephalon appreciates Victini's wallbreaking, allowing it to easily clean late-game. In return, Choice Scarf Blacephalon can take on troublesome Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Spectrier, Slowbro, and Choice Specs Latios. Volcanion is a powerful special wallbreaker that can break past physical walls such as Mandibuzz and Toxapex as well as check Azumarill for Victini. Parting Shot Incineroar can form a momentum-generating core with Victini, allowing Fire teams to always keep momentum on their side. Incineroar can also remove items such as Toxapex's Black Sludge with Knock Off and deal with Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon. Lightning Rod Alolan Marowak can be used as an emergency source of Electric immunity to prevent threats like Choice Specs Tapu Koko and Regieleki from steamrolling through the type.</p>"

V-create deals with all Steel-types except Heatran and dents switch-ins such as Landorus-T that aim to take on Victini's coverage moves. Bolt Strike threatens Water-types such as Toxapex and Mantine, and it also chips down Heatran, which helps Victini eventually overpower Steel teams. U-turn allows Victini to pivot out of switch-ins such as Swampert and Slowbro, allowing it to gain momentum for its teammates. Toxic cripples switch-ins such as Swampert and Hippowdon, while Substitute lets Victini take advantage of forced switches and avoid status, allowing it to wear down its checks such as Heatran and become harder to revenge kill. Heavy-Duty Boots gives Victini longevity, especially helping it threaten bulkier types such as Steel and Poison. Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Victini to outspeed and pivot out of threats such as Mimikyu, Landorus-T, and Kyurem.</p> <p>Slowbro is a great partner for Victini, as it deals with faster Water- and Ground-types such as Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Excadrill that threaten Victini, as well as pivots it in with Teleport. Calm Mind Latios breaks through bulky physical walls such as Hippowdon, Toxapex, and Slowbro for Victini, and it appreciates Victini pressuring Steel-types such as Heatran and Jirachi, which Latios struggles with. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele sets Psychic Terrain to neutralize priority users such as Azumarill and Bisharp, and it also threatens Dark- and Dragon-types such as non-Choice Scarf Weavile and Hydreigon. Hatterene benefits from Victini's ability to remove Steel-types that wall it, and in turn it checks Dark- and Dragon-types such as Galarian Moltes and Kyurem for Victini. Jirachi sets Stealth Rock and slows down the opposing team for Victini with Thunder Wave. Galarian Slowking is a great special wall that can deal with faster threats such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Volcarona. Cosmic Power Mew benefits from Victini pressuring Steel-types such as Bisharp and Aegislash, and it acts as a good late-game wincon in matchups such as Ground and Water, which Victini struggles with.</p>"

V-create is an extremely strong nuke that obliterates all Steel-types except Heatran, and it hits anything that doesn't resist it hard. Bolt Strike threatens switch-ins to V-create such as Heatran, Mantine, and Toxapex, and it OHKOes bulkier variants of Galarian Moltres. U-turn allows Victini to escape unfavorable matchups from switch-ins such as Slowbro and Gastrodon. Trick cripples the aforementioned physical walls, defensive Pokemon such as Heatran and Aegislash, and bulky setup sweepers such as Cosmic Power Mew once Victini's wallbreaking prowess is unneeded.</p> <p>Choice Band Victini is prone to getting worn down by entry hazards, so teammates that provide entry hazard control such as Latias and Hatterene are greatly appreciated. Latias also deals with faster threats, such as Garchomp, for Victini and provides Healing Wish to give it a second chance to wallbreak. Hatterene can devastate faster teams such as rain Water, Dark, and Electric, which Victini cannot handle, and appreciates Victini's ability to obliterate Steel-types such as Melmetal. Victini paves the way for Choice Scarf Tapu Lele to clean opposing teams late-game, and Tapu Lele also provides Psychic Terrain to neutralize priority users such as Bisharp and Azumarill for it. Galarian Slowking is a strong specially defensive pivot and can support Victini's wallbreaking prowess with Future Sight, heavily pressuring possible switch-ins such as Swampert and Toxapex. Mew and Jirachi provide Spikes and/or Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing team for Victini, and they cripple the opposing team with Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Ground</h3> <p>Sand Rush alongside its phenomenal Attack stat allows Excadrill to become a potent revenge killer for Ground teams, taking on threats such as Zarude, Keldeo, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu under sand. Excadrill's decent natural bulk allows it to live attacks such as unboosted Galarian Moltres's Fiery Wrath, Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball, and Hydreigon's Flamethrower. Excadrill's part-Steel typing allows it to take neutral damage from Ice- and Grass-type attacks such as Weavile's Ice Shard and Tapu Koko's Grass Knot and resist Dragon- and Psychic-type attacks such as Latias's Draco Meteor and Psychic. It also has Rapid Spin, which allows Excadrill to clear entry hazards off the field; this gives Ground teams their only and reliable form of entry hazard removal. However, Excadrill relies on sand to outpace most offensive threats such as Choice Specs Zapdos, Victini, Tapu Lele, Blacephalon, and Nidoking, leaving it easily revenge killed outside of sand.</p> <h3>Steel</h3> <p>Excadrill is an effective revenge killer and late-game cleaner for Steel teams, making it extremely valuable in the Electric, Poison, Psychic, and Fire matchups. Its ability, Mold Breaker, is extremely useful, as it allows Excadrill to spam Earthquake without being bothered by Levitate users like Rotom-W and Galarian Weezing. However, Excadrill is slower than most Choice Scarf users and gets forced out by those that carry super effective coverage such as Blacephalon, Tapu Lele, and Galarian Darmanitan. Furthermore, Excadrill struggles to deal with physical walls such as Slowbro and Galarian Corsola, which means that it needs support from teammates like Aegislash and Bisharp to break down certain defensive cores.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>Swords Dance + Rapid Spin can be used on both Sand Rush and Mold Breaker Excadrill. It allows Excadrill to act as a sweeper outside of sand thanks to Rapid Spin allowing it to outspeed Pokemon such as Kyurem. Mold Breaker can be used to target Levitate users such as Rotom-W, Hydreigon, and Latios with Earthquake. A Choice Scarf set can be used on sand less Ground teams to allow Excadrill to act as a revenge killer without the boost from sand or Rapid Spin and take on threats such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele. Shadow Claw can be used to take on Psychic teams, allowing Excadrill to 2HKO Pokemon such as physically defensive Bronzong.</p> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>An Occa Berry or Chople Berry may be used over Leftovers on the Swords Dance set to survive a Fire- or Fighting-type move, allowing Excadrill to lure in and KO Pokemon like Zapdos, Blacephalon, Zeraora, and Thundurus-T, but the lack of Leftovers recovery hurts Excadrill's longevity in other matchups. Shed Shell may also be used over Leftovers to prevent Excadrill from getting trapped by Magnet Rise Air Balloon Magnezone, but it is useless in other matchups. Using these items over Leftovers also allows Excadrill to bluff a Choice Scarf set, which can be favorable in Psychic and Electric matchups, as its Choice Scarf set threatens to outspeed and KO Victini and Zeraora.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Ground-immune and -resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are immune to or resist Earthquake present a problem to Excadrill. However, Pokemon like Landorus-T, Galarian Moltres, and Zarude have to watch out for its other STAB and coverage moves in Iron Head, Rock Slide, and X-Scissor, respectively. The only Pokemon that truly wall all of Excadrill's coverage are Celesteela, Corviknight, and Skarmory; the former can wall its attacks and wear it down with Leech Seed + Protect, and the latter two can threaten it with Body Press in return.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive walls such as Rotom-W, Porygon2, Galarian Corsola, and Hippowdon can easily take all of Excadrill's attacks and either cripple it with status or threaten it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Revenge killers such as Spectrier, Garchomp, Cinderace, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu outspeed and revenge kill Excadrill outside of sand. Dragon Dance Dragapult also only needs one Dragon Dance to outpace Excadrill in sand, and Choice Scarf Weavile outspeeds Adamant Excadrill in sand.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Being burnt severely hinders Excadrill's performance as a wallbreaker, as it can no longer break past defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Amoonguss or OHKO offensive threats such as Choice Specs Zapdos, even after Stealth Rock. Whimsicott and Zapdos can paralyze Excadrill with Stun Spore and Static respectively, preventing it from outspeeding threats such as Zarude and Zeraora.</p> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro, Celesteela, and Hippowdon take minimal damage from Excadrill's attacks and threaten it with their own super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Victini, Zarude, and Landorus-T outspeed Excadrill and can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone</strong>: Excadrill has to be wary of getting trapped and KOed by Magnezone in Electric matchups as Excadrill may be forced to lock into Rock Slide to KO Zapdos. Magnezone can even hold an Air Balloon to render Excadrill's Earthquake ineffective. However, Magnezone is less threatening if Excadrill is using a Swords Dance set.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn from Galarian Corsola and Scald users like Slowbro severely reduces Excadrill's offensive potential.</p>",

Iron Head targets Ice- and Fairy-types such as Avalugg, Alolan Ninetales, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele. X-Scissor is used to take on Zarude and Celebi while also dealing with other Dark- and Psychic-types such as Hydreigon and Slowbro. Rock Slide targets Flying-types such as Zapdos, Galarian Moltres, and Mantine. Sand Rush allows Excadrill to outspeed threats such as Blacephalon, Zeraora, Zarude, and Choice Specs Dragapult under sand. Maximum Speed investment allows Excadrill to outspeed threats such as Tapu Bulu, Adamant Diggersby, and Choice Specs Pelipper. An Adamant nature paired with a Choice Band allows Excadrill to OHKO threats such as Keldeo after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Slowbro with X-Scissor. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed threats such as +1 Adamant Dragapult and Choice Scarf Weavile in sand. Excadrill should be safely brought in to take advantage of the sand with methods such as Eject Button Hippowdon or by bringing it on resisted attacks such as Latias's Draco Meteor.</p> <p>All of Excadrill's teammates appreciate its ability to take on Ice-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types, clear entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and act as a revenge killer in sand against threats such as Barraskewda, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu. Hippowdon is a mandatory partner for Excadrill, as it sets sand and Stealth Rock, as well as being able to bring in Excadrill safely with Eject Button. Hippowdon can also take on physical threats such as Dragon Dance Dragapult, Zeraora, and Bisharp for Excadrill. Gastrodon and Seismitoad offer Excadrill an immunity to Water-type attacks such as Mantine's Scald and Barraskewda's Waterfall. Gastrodon offers a more defensive presence thanks to Recover, while Seismitoad checks Azumarill, which would otherwise beat Excadrill. Swords Dance Garchomp wears down shared checks like Celesteela with Fire Fang, takes on Mantine with Stone Edge, and can become dangerous setup sweeper with Scale Shot, which makes handling Pokemon like Spectrier much easier. Landorus-T provides a Ground immunity, allowing it to switch into Hippowdon's Earthquake; it is also a great revenge killer that can take on weakened threats such as Zeraora, Spectrier, and Urshifu-R with its Choice Scarf set. Gravity Landorus-T can threaten Pokemon such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight for Excadrill, as well as taking on Steel teams in their entirety if it carries Bulk Up and Substitute. Nidoking can beat Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela with Earth Power + Flamethrower or Flying-types such as Mantine, Pelipper, Corviknight, and Dragonite with Thunderbolt + Ice Beam. Mamoswine is a great late-game cleaner that can pick off weakened threats such as Garchomp, Dragapult, and Hydreigon with Ice Shard while also being able to remove items such as Slowking's Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off.</p>"

Rapid Spin allows Excadrill to remove only the opponent's entry hazards, which synergizes with Steel's tendency to stack entry hazards. Iron Head deals with Fairy- and Ice-types such as Tapu Bulu and Kyurem. Toxic may be used to punish defensive Pokemon like Mew and Slowbro. A Choice Scarf allows Excadrill to outspeed a majority of the metagame and remove threats like Zeraora, Dragapult, and Victini.</p> <p>Ferrothorn is a good teammate, as it covers Excadrill's weaknesses to Ground and Water by checking Hippowdon and Kingdra and it sets up entry hazards to chip foes. Aegislash provides a Fighting immunity and can punish physically defensive walls such as Slowbro and Mantine with Toxic. Heatran offers a Fire immunity and can trap and remove bulky walls such as Mew and Porygon2 that Excadrill struggles with. Celesteela provides a Ground immunity and threatens Grass- and Steel-types such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn. Alternatively, Corviknight or Skarmory could be considered as the Ground-immune partner, as they both threaten Fighting-types such as Galarian Zapdos and Kommo-o. Melmetal heavily damages bulky walls such as Amoonguss and Toxapex, which allows Excadrill to clean Psychic and Poison teams late-game. Jirachi threatens physical walls such as Slowbro, Amoonguss, and Celesteela for Excadrill and can wear down Poison and Water teams with its Choice Specs set. Bisharp deals with faster, frailer Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Victini and Blacephalon with Sucker Punch and can break down walls such as Slowbro and Porygon2 with its Swords Dance set.</p>"

Rock Slide allows Excadrill to OHKO threats such as Thundurus-T, Zapdos, and Crobat after a Swords Dance. Iron Head may be considered instead, as it allows Excadrill to clean late-game in the Fairy and Dragon matchup and hit common switch-ins such as Landorus-T harder. Rock Blast can be considered to break the Substitutes of Kyurem and Galarian Moltres, but it is less consistent than Rock Slide. Rapid Spin allows Excadrill to boost its Speed, pick off weakened Pokemon, and take advantage of forced switches, allowing it to outspeed would-be answers such as Victini, Zeraora, and Gengar. Leftovers prolongs Excadrill's longevity, allowing it to set up and threaten opposing teams multiple times in a match.</p> <p>Ferrothorn checks threats such as Tapu Fini and Hippowdon for Excadrill and sets up entry hazards to chip the opposing team. Specially defensive Aegislash can tank weak special attacks from physically defensive walls such as Slowbro and Porygon2 and punish them with Toxic while also providing a Fighting immunity. Heatran provides a switch-in to Fire-type attacks and can utilize a Choice Scarf set to make up for Excadrill's reduced Speed, allowing it to outspeed and KO threats such as Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu and Victini. Celesteela, Corviknight, and Skarmory provide a Ground immunity and utility in the form of Leech Seed, pivoting, and entry hazards, respectively. Choice Scarf Magnezone can trap and KO opposing Steel-types such as Celesteela, Corviknight, and Skarmory and Water-types such as Urshifu-R and Keldeo, all of which Excadrill struggles with.</p>"

Substitute takes advantage of foes locked into a Water-type move such as Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Choice Band Barraskewda, as well as passive, status-reliant Pokemon such as Rotom-W and Toxapex. Power Whip deals heavy damage to Water-types, notably KOing Azumarill after it has used Belly Drum, Crawdaunt after Stealth Rock damage, and Urshifu-R after a Close Combat Defense drop. Power Whip also deters Calm Mind Tapu Fini and Keldeo from using Seismitoad as setup fodder. Earthquake threatens Poison- and Steel-types such as Toxapex, Dragalge, and Magnezone. Knock Off deals with Ghost-types and removes items from switch-ins such as Tapu Bulu, Zapdos, and Zarude. 104 Speed EVs with an Adamant nature allow Seismitoad to beat Adamant Crawdaunt and Adamant Azumarill, while the defensive investment lets it survive Close Combat from Choice Band Urshifu-R.</p> <p>Status, especially Toxic, hinders Seismitoad's ability to pivot against predicted Water-type moves from Urshifu-R and Kingdra.

Seismitoad's offensive presence makes it a great fit for sand teams, as Choice Band Sand Rush Excadrill appreciates Seismitoad's ability to remove Azumarill and Rotom-W, and in return outspeeds and removes threats such as Kyurem, Zarude, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele. Landorus-T provides a Ground-type immunity and can take Grass-type attacks from Zarude and Choice Specs Jirachi. Mamoswine deals with Flying- and Grass-types such as Galarian Moltres, Zapdos, and Tapu Bulu. It also switches into Freeze-Dry from Alolan Ninetales and Kyurem.

Furthermore, Barraskewda can take on faster Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Gengar under rain. Other wallbreakers such as Keldeo are appreciated as partners as they break down shared checks with Seismitoad and can beat faster Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Indeedee outside of rain.

U-turn allows it to bring in its teammates to take advantage of the sun. Encore prevents Whimsicott from becoming setup bait for sweepers such as Bulk Up Corviknight. Memento does the same thing as U-turn; however, it allows Whimsicott to safely bring in a setup sweeper such as Venusaur with a free opportunity to set up. Heat Rock increases the number of sun turns and Prankster gives Sunny Day and Memento priority.

Weather Ball users such as Venusaur and Celebi especially appreciate the sun, as it makes the move Fire type to nail Steel-type Pokemon such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Choice Scarf Virizion acts as a revenge killer that takes on threats such as Choice Scarf Charizard and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan for the team. It also provides a way to take on the most common hail and sand setters in Alolan Ninetales and Tyranitar thanks to its coverage in Smart Strike and Close Combat. Alongside Whimsicott, Ferrothorn makes up the support for weather-based Grass teams as the team's way of setting entry hazards, allowing the teams sweepers to more easily muscle through the opposing team.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock Lead (Dark)": {
        "description": "<p>Krookodile is a valuable lead for hyper offensive Dark teams thanks to the massive utility options it has to offer for its teammates, notably Stealth Rock and Taunt. Taunt is used to shut down Defoggers such as Mandibuzz and Mantine as well as slower entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Hippowdon, Toxapex, and Skarmory. Knock Off has the benefit of removing items from bulky threats such as Porygon2, Mandibuzz, and Blissey, making them easier to deal with. Earthquake lets it threaten Pokemon such as Torkoal, Klefki, and Cobalion. It also discourages fast sweepers like Volcarona and Scolipede from safely setting up on it and beating the majority of the team. Intimidate is a fantastic ability, as it weakens problematic foes like Terrakion and Zeraora, which can handle Dark-type teams easily with their STAB and coverage moves. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows it to outspeed slower foes such as Lucario, Kommo-o, and Rotom-C. Focus Sash lets Krookodile set Stealth Rock without getting OHKOed by powerful attacks such as Moonblast from Jirachi or Focus Blast from Alakazam. It's recommended to lead with Krookodile at the start of match, so it can set up Stealth Rock more efficiently with its Focus Sash intact. Magic Bounce users such as Xatu and Hatterene should also be dealt with before attempting to set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Setup sweepers and wallbreakers such as Dragon Dance Tyranitar, Bulk Up Urshifu-S, Hydreigon, and Bisharp appreciate Krookodile's entry hazard support to wear down the opposing team and its ability Intimidate. Taunt is especially useful because it prevents most Pokemon from setting up entry hazards and defensive threats like Toxapex and Corviknight from fully recovering their health. Bisharp can also handle a huge threat in Hatterene, which deflects Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Urshifu-S appreciates Stealth Rock damage on opponents, since it can specifically OHKO Zeraora with Sucker Punch and Hatterene with Wicked Blow after a Bulk Up boost. Drapion's part-Poison typing is very useful, as it can set Toxic Spikes and form a hazard-stacking core with Krookodile. Zarude is helpful against troublesome Water-types such as Keldeo and Primarina, as they are both able to use Substitute and force Krookodile to damage them. Krookodile cannot prevent faster leads such as Ribombee, Galvantula, and Cobalion from setting up entry hazards, so Mandibuzz getting rid of them with Defog is appreciated.</p>"

Icicle Crash allows it to beat Ground- and Dragon-types like Hippowdon and Dragapult. Flare Blitz provides great coverage for Bug- and Steel-types like Frosmoth and Corviknight. U-turn is a solid option for safely bringing in a teammate on a predicted switch. Superpower allows Galarian Darmanitan to OHKO defensive Pokemon like Tyranitar and Snorlax.

Entry hazard removers such as Avalugg and Galarian Mr. Mime serve as helpful teammates for keeping Galarian Darmanitan healthy throughout a match. Vanilluxe offers Aurora Veil support to bolster Galarian Darmanitan's survivability, especially against Choice Scarf users that outspeed it such as Gengar as well as priority users like Bisharp and Aegislash, while also being able to break through defensive Water-types like Rotom-W and Toxapex with Freeze-Dry.

Icicle Crash is able to destroy walls that don't resist it, like Clefable, and even frailer Ice-resistant Pokemon on the switch-in, such as Crawdaunt. Fire Punch and Flare Blitz serve as coverage to nail Steel- and Ice-types that resist Icicle Crash; the former one is preferred, as it already OHKOes Corviknight and Ferrothorn without recoil damage. However, the latter scores KOs versus Levitate Bronzong, +1 Corviknight, Mamoswine, and Aegislash after contact with King's Shield. Earthquake nails Toxapex and Torkoal and is Galarian Darmanitan's best way to damage Snorlax. U-turn takes advantage of the number of switches Galarian Darmanitan forces, generating momentum for the team while hitting reasonably hard. A Jolly nature is vital to outrun Kommo-o and tie with other base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Indeedee.</p> <p>Because this Galarian Darmanitan forgoes the Speed boost from Choice Scarf, it becomes vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Hydreigon and Dragapult. Other Choice Scarf revenge killers that can beat them, like Weavile and Galarian Mr. Mime, are, thus, great partners. Entry hazards are also an issue for Galarian Darmanitan, since they reduce its lifespan greatly, especially if it's running Flare Blitz; therefore, Rapid Spin users such as the aforementioned Galarian Mr. Mime and Avalugg are mandatory teammates. Alolan Ninetales provides Aurora Veil support for Galarian Darmanitan, making it more useful against offensive teams by taking hits better and KOing faster, frailer enemies back. Swords Dance Weavile and Cloyster appreciate Galarian Darmanitan's capability to break walls for a late-game sweep. Froslass, Mamoswine, and Piloswine can lay down Spikes and Stealth Rock, respectively, softening defensive Pokemon like Toxapex for Galarian Darmanitan.</p>"

Calm Mind plus Iron Defense and reliable recovery make it incredibly hard to break by any team once it starts getting a few boosts. Magic Guard further boosts this combination by making it immune to entry hazards and residual damage, most notably poison, which would otherwise inhibit its entire function. Stored Power is its primary attack, which scales incredibly over time as Reuniclus gains more stat boosts. However, be wary of using Reuniclus, as with Stored Power being its only attack, it cannot do much in a battle without first having some stat boosts and is left walled by any Dark-type. It is important to take advantage of passive Pokemon that do not threaten Reuniclus at all by using it as an opportunity to set up with either Calm Mind or Iron Defense.</p> <p>As Reuniclus is completely ineffective if there is any Dark-type Pokemon on the opponent's team, it is crucial that Dark-types be eliminated before even attempting to set up with Reuniclus. Therefore, Pokemon such as Hatterene, Gardevoir, and Gallade are all crucial for their STAB Fairy- and Fighting-type attacks to take down opposing Dark-types. Pokemon with Fire-type coverage such as Indeedee also greatly benefit Reuniclus, as they can help take down Steel-types that resist Reuniclus's only attack. Indeedee also provides a Ghost-type immunity, which Reuniclus can struggle to take on before setting up.</p>"

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<h3>Grass</h3> <p>Amoonguss is a great pivot for Grass teams because of Regenerator and its defensive typing providing a Bug neutrality and resistances to check physical attackers like Heracross and Azumarill. Furthermore, its Fighting resistance is great because Grass teams have common Fighting weaknesses like Ferrothorn, Cradily, and Zarude. Its Poison typing absorbs Toxic Spikes, which is useful since Grass teams lack a good entry hazard remover. Its access to Spore cripples opposing Pokemon, giving teammates like Zarude and Rillaboom opportunities to come in. Unfortunately, Amoonguss is forced out by Pokemon carrying super effective coverage such as Hydreigon, Zapdos, and Heatran and special attackers like Nihilego, Spectrier, and Kingdra. Furthermore, Amoonguss easily becomes bait for setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres and Volcarona and hazard setters like Klefki and Mew after it has used Spore on a foe already. Finally, it has a hard time making progress against defensive Grass-types like Ferrothorn and opposing Amoonguss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Grass</h4> <p>Clear Smog is an option to prevent setup sweepers like Clefable and Tapu Fini from using Amoonguss as setup fodder. Stun Spore slows down fast Pokemon like Latios, Choice Scarf Heatran, and Galarian Zapdos to help offensive teammates like Zarude and Rillaboom revenge kill more easily. A pinch Berry like Occa Berry or Payapa Berry has a use in surviving a Fire- or Psychic-type attack from Cinderace or Tapu Lele, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Grass</h4> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Many Steel-types like Celesteela, Heatran, and Melmetal take very little damage from Amoonguss and can retaliate with their respective attacks; however, they don't appreciate switching into Spore.</p> <p><strong>Dragon types</strong>: Kyurem, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Hydreigon can threaten Amoonguss with powerful special attacks. Kyurem and Hydreigon can notably use Substitute and avoid Amoonguss's Spore.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users like Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Mew can cripple Amoonguss from using status moves. They can also use Amoonguss as setup fodder after using Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Electric Terrain and Misty Terrain</strong>: Electric Terrain and Misty Terrain prevent grounded Pokemon like Alolan Raichu and Klefki from being affected by Spore.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: If Amoonguss isn't wearing Heavy-Duty Boots, it makes it difficult to switch into physical attackers like Excadrill on Steel and Zarude on opposing Grass, both types which are known for stacking Stealth Rock and Spikes. Will-O-Wisp also factors in longevity when switching into attacks.</p>",

Heavy-Duty Boots is used to help with durability, since Grass teams don't run entry hazard removal; however, Black Sludge is an alternative.</p> <p>All of Amoonguss's teammates, especially its offensive teammates in Zarude and Rillaboom, appreciate its Spore to give them opportunities to come in and ability to absorb Toxic Spikes. Amoonguss forms a defensive core alongside Ferrothorn and Cradily, and both notably can check Ice-types like Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales and provide entry hazard support. Ferrothorn's typing allows it to check Psychic-, Dragon-, and Flying-types such as Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Dragonite. It also has utilities like Thunder Wave, Toxic, and Knock Off to cripple defensive Pokemon like opposing Ferrothorn and Skarmory that Amoonguss relies on teammates to get rid of. Cradily checks special attackers like Zapdos, Volcarona, and Heatran and Substitute users like Hydreigon, Galarian Moltres, and Togekiss with Rock Blast. Whimsicott checks Fighting-, Dragon-, and Dark-types like Guts Heracross, Dragonite, and Mandibuzz along with Substitute users like Galarian Moltres and Kommo-o. Zarude and Rillaboom gets rid of defensive Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Aegislash thanks to their Fighting + Dark coverage.

Spore allows Amoonguss to put threats such as Diggersby and Excadrill to sleep and avoid becoming set up bait against setup sweepers such as Bisharp. Giga Drain allows Amoonguss to target Ground- and Water-type Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Krookodile, Seismitoad, and Keldeo. Foul Play allows Amoonguss to punish physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor and Pokemon weak to Dark such as Dragapult. Stomping Tantrum is an option to punish Salazzle, a pain to face for Poison teams, but it is not good in any other matchup. Synthesis gives Amoonguss a reliable form of recovery and also allows it to switch into Choice Scarf Excadrill through the match continually. Black Sludge gives Amoonguss a form of passive recovery, and Regenerator allows Amoonguss to excel as a defensive pivot. Its EVs and Bold nature allow Amoonguss to avoid a 2HKO from physical attacks such as Choice Scarf Excadrill's Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Toxapex and Amoonguss form the Regenerator core on Poison teams. Toxapex also provides Amoonguss with a switch-in to Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Pokemon such as Charizard and Weavile. In return, Amoonguss can tank Electric-type attacks for Toxapex, such as Zeraora's Plasma Fists. Galarian Weezing can switch into powerful Dragon-type attacks for Amoonguss, such as Hydreigon's Draco Meteor. Galarian Weezing also switches into Ground-type attacks that Amoonguss cannot, such as Choice Band Diggersby's Earthquake, as well as cripple physical attackers such as Terrakion with Will-O-Wisp. Skuntank provides a switch-in to Psychic-type attacks and can check dangerous threats to Amoonguss with Sucker Punch, such as Alolan Raichu and Dragapult. Both can also clear entry hazards for Amoonguss with Defog. Amoonguss can put foes to sleep for Gengar with Spore, allowing Gengar to break through the opposing team more easily. Gengar can, in return, cripple walls for Amoonguss like Toxapex by using Trick, making them near deadweight. Salazzle keeps faster foes in check and can check Pokemon such as Excadrill with Flamethrower, taking the burden off Amoonguss to switch into its Earthquake. Salazzle can also significantly improve the Poison- and Steel-type matchup by crippling foes such as Corviknight and Toxapex with Toxic thanks to its ability Corrosion. Scolipede is a powerful setup sweeper that can break through walls such as Chansey with Megahorn and threaten Psychic teams very effectively thanks to Speed Boost and its ability to OHKO or 2HKO all Psychic-type Pokemon. While not incredibly viable, Toxtricity can take on Flying-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Mantine, and Mandibuzz with Overdrive, which otherwise wall Amoonguss.</p>"

Having Sticky Web set up is important for Electric-type teams because it helps against threatening Choice Scarf users such as Weavile, Gengar, and Gardevoir and hinders setup sweepers like Cloyster and Barbaracle. Galvantula is also a good attacker because it can land Thunder consistently thanks to Compound Eyes. Thunder is able to 2HKO common Defoggers such as Galarian Weezing and Rotom-W while also threatening anti-hazard leads such as Xatu. Bug Buzz is used for Pokemon that can tank Thunder such as Hydreigon, Mew, Rotom-C, and Alolan Raichu. String Shot slows opposing Pokemon, which makes it easier for Galvantula's teammates to outspeed and check threatening sweepers, such as Excadrill. Energy Ball can be used instead of String Shot to offer Galvantula coverage against Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad. Galvantula should be wary of Magic Bounce users such as Hatterene and Defiant users such as Bisharp, as they can take advantage of Sticky Web. A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment allow Galvantula to outspeed Pokemon such as Mew and Speed tie Cobalion. Focus Sash is used so Galvantula can survive any attack and set up Sticky Web or attack.</p> <p>Powerful wallbreakers and sweepers such as Zeraora, Toxtricity, and Rotom-H make for great teammates, as they take full advantage of Galvantula's Sticky Web. Specifically, Alolan Raichu outspeeds a Jolly Barraskewda outside of rain after Sticky Web. A Choice Band Zeraora is also a huge threat to Dark-, Dragon-, and Normal-type teams once Sticky Web is set because it can outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Dragapult and OHKO them with Close Combat and Play Rough, respectively. When Sticky Web is up, Toxtricity does well against Poison- and Fairy-type teams, as it can outspeed Pokemon such as Salazzle and Alolan Ninetales and do tons of damage. Rotom-H is a great option that takes advantage of Galvantula's Sticky Web, especially against Steel- and Grass-type teams, dealing with Pokemon such as Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Celebi that Electric teams can struggle against. Finally, Pincurchin's entry hazard stacking abilities, when combined with Galvantula's Sticky Web, can heavily damage grounded foes upon entry.

Thunder Wave could be useful to cripple a switch in and can help Ferrothorn's average speed teammates like Rillaboom, Zarude, and Celebi to sweep more easily. While this could be handy, Ferrothorn has trouble sacrificing one of its moves for it. Stealth Rock is an additional entry hazard to compress onto Ferrothorn, but this is rarely needed, as Cradily runs Stealth Rock, and not running Cradily alongside Ferrothorn can prove to be detrimental. Protect is useful to scout Choice-locked foes to see their intentions and to increase longevity with Leftovers but has little other use. Iron Defense can take advantage of Ferrothorn's already absurd Defense and make Body Press even more threatening, but once again, Ferrothorn has trouble finding room for it. Toxic is another option to consider over Thunder Wave to whittle down setup sweepers or to better deal with many of the metagame's passive walls like Galarian Corsola and Rotom-W, but since Cradily also runs Toxic, there isn't much reason for it.</p>",

      "Defensive Utility (Grass)": {
        "description": "<p>Ferrothorn is a staple on Grass teams due to its phenomenal defensive typing, access to Spikes, Steel-type STAB options to handle Hatterene not carrying Mystical Fire and Ice-types, notably Kyurem, and a plethora of other utility moves. Spikes is valuable for Grass in order to help its wallbreakers like Rillaboom and Celebi to sweep late-game while also breaking opposing Focus Sash and chipping away at common defensive pivots like Galarian Slowking and Blissey. Leech Seed provides Ferrothorn with further recovery in tandem with Leftovers, as well as a means to stall out opposing walls such as Toxapex, Chansey, and Mantine. Iron Head hits Fairy- and Ice-types and can notably OHKO Alolan Ninetales through Aurora Veil. It's also particularly useful to prevent Kyurem from being able to stall it out. Body Press gives Ferrothorn a way to fight back against opposing Steel-types, making Ferrothorn the best counter for most Substitute Melmetal sets for Grass teams. Body Press can make it trickier for opponents to switch Hydreigon into Ferrothorn. Knock Off gives Ferrothorn a way to dissuade common Defog users like Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Braviary from switching in with the threat of removing Leftovers from the former and Heavy-Duty Boots from the latter two. Knock Off can also be valued in general for its item removal, particularly against Toxapex and Amoongus in the Water or Poison stall matchup. Maximum Defense EVs and an Impish nature let Ferrothorn wall and check common physical attackers like Weavile and Golisopod. Leftovers is the preferred item, as without it, Ferrothorn would have to rely almost solely on Leech Seed for more longevity.</p> <p>Cradily is perhaps the best teammate for Ferrothorn defensively, using its great special bulk and Rock typing to tank special Fire-type attacks with ease, as well as common Fire-type coverage from Nidoking and Zapdos, while Ferrothorn shrugs off most physical Steel-, Ice-, and Bug-type attacks from threats such as Bisharp, Arctozolt, and Golisopod in return. Cradily also gets access to Stealth Rock and forms a viable entry hazard stacking core with Ferrothorn. Amoonguss’s Poison typing, good bulk, and excellent ability in Regenerator completes this trio and gives Ferrothorn a solid Fighting-resistant teammate to fall back on, while Ferrothorn gives Amoonguss a Psychic-resistant teammate and a Flying neutrality. Amoonguss can also use Spore to put a Pokemon to sleep that would threaten Ferrothorn like Zeraora, Urshifu-R, or Mimikyu carrying Drain Punch, and it can use Foul Play to check Dragapult and Aegislash. Whimsicott’s Prankster ability and access to Encore allow it to switch in on a foe that's trying to set up in front of Ferrothorn like Volcarona, Dragonite, or Spectrier and force it out while also racking up damage from entry hazards from the switches that Encore forces. Whimsicott's Fairy typing coupled with Moonblast can additionally make it a check to Fighting- and Dragon-types that may force Ferrothorn to switch out, like Buzzwole, Galarian Zapdos, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. At worst, it can provide additional Knock Off support against threats like Zapdos or Stun Spore against Tornadus and other Flying-types. Its U-turn can help Ferrothorn to come in more easily as well. Rillaboom appreciates the hazards that Ferrothorn sets up, which makes it easier to sweep late-game, especially against potential cleaners like Galarian Darmanitan and Alolan Raichu. It can also take advantage of a foe with Ferrothorn's Leech Seed to set up more easily. Access to High Horsepower and Superpower is also valuable coverage for Ferrothorn, as Rillaboom can notably check specially defensive Heatran and makes for a great teammate against Ice teams due to Superpower and Grassy Glide. Furthermore, Rillaboom's Grassy Surge provides Ferrothorn with even more passive recovery and reduced damage from Ground-type attacks. Celebi is a special attacker that can deal with Magnezone and Volcanion, which could give Ferrothorn a hard time. Celebi packs another Fighting resistance and also appreciate Ferrothorn's hazards that help it clean late-game. Choice Scarf Zarude can check threatening Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Victini and Spectrier, as well as break other Steel-types like Heatran with Close Combat. Rotom-C is a powerful special attacker that can break physical walls like Toxapex and Corviknight in addition to providing an immunity to Ground-type attacks.</p>"

Stealth Rock is a great utility move to chip away at the opposing team. Spikes is another option if another Pokemon on the team already has Stealth Rock. Maximum investment in Defense is for consistently dealing with physical threats to Steel-type teams such as Barraskewda, Mamoswine, and Crawdaunt. Ferrothorn is primarily a utility Pokemon and is used to switch in on attacks and apply defensive pressure to the opponent.</p> <p>Jirachi is a good partner for Ferrothorn as they form a core that can overwhelm Water-type teams thanks to Jirachi's access to Thunderbolt, Energy Ball and Psychic. Aegislash is a good partner because its Ghost typing gives it an immunity to Fighting-type attacks that threaten Ferrothorn and allows it to block Rapid Spin. Aegislash also benefits from Ferrothorn's entry hazards because it can use Shadow Sneak to pick off weakened foes. Bisharp is another good partner that punishes entry hazard removal because of its Defiant ability, which gives it a +2 Attack boost if the foe uses Defog. Corviknight forms a great defensive core with Ferrothorn and provides a Ground immunity. Excadrill is a great revenge killer and is an offensive check to Fire-types that threaten Ferrothorn and Steel-type teams in general.

Knock Off lets Bisharp remove items such as Leftovers from Ferrothorn, Choice Scarf from Ditto, and Eviolite from Porygon2. Bisharp's Steel typing comes in very handy for Dark teams, as it grants a neutrality to Fairy and allows Bisharp to take on slower Fairy-types like Clefable with Iron Head. Bisharp relies on Sucker Punch to make up for its low Speed stat, but there are threats that can OHKO Bisharp without fearing Sucker Punch such as Tapu Koko and Hydreigon.</p>",

One is advised to use Life Orb with Jolly to actually OHKO Tapu Bulu, as well as specially defensive Heatran and, potentially, Victini. A Choice Scarf set with Stone Edge, Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and Iron Head may be considered, as it notably outspeeds and picks off threats such as Victini, Cinderace, and Tornadus-T. However, Bisharp's subpar Speed leaves it outsped by all relevant Choice Scarf users and some naturally fast Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko and Zeroara. This necessitates a second Choice Scarf user or another way to handle these threats, such as Swords Dance Excadrill or Melmetal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Bisharp dislikes certain status conditions, as burns prevent it from breaking through walls such as Toxapex and paralysis prevents it from outspeeding threats such as Azumarill.</p> <p><strong>Tapu Lele</strong>: Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain blocks Sucker Punch, and it can even OHKO Bisharp with Focus Blast or Choice Specs-boosted Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Faster Substitute users such as Kommo-o block Sucker Punch and take advantage of Bisharp's low Speed.</p> <p><strong>Sucker Punch-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Hydreigon can take Sucker Punch without a problem and even OHKO Bisharp with their attacking moves.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance helps Bisharp break through troublesome walls such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Iron Head covers Fairy-types like Clefable and Dark-resistant foes such as Tyranitar. Sucker Punch makes up for Bisharp's mediocre Speed and targets faster threats such as Barraskewda and Volcarona. Maximum Speed investment helps Bisharp outspeed threats to Dark teams like Galarian Weezing and Azumarill.</p> <p>Tyranitar deals with special Fire-types that Bisharp can't handle like Volcarona and sets Stealth Rock, letting Bisharp potentially activate Defiant against Defoggers such as Mantine. Similarly, Grimmsnarl's dual screens force Defog usage while also giving Bisharp an easier time setting up; Grimmsnarl also checks Fighting-types. Zarude covers Bisharp's Ground weakness and can take care of bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon as well as bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini. Weavile and Galarian Moltres pair well with Bisharp, as they can deal with threats to it such as Landorus-T and Keldeo, respectively. Hydreigon and Bisharp form a great wallbreaking core, since Hydreigon deals with foes like Corviknight and Bisharp handles Ice-types such as Choice Specs Kyurem. Mandibuzz checks Fighting- and Ground-types like Kommo-o and Excadrill while also bringing Bisharp in safely with U-turn. Sableye is another good option because it provides a Fighting immunity and it can shut down checks to Bisharp such as Corviknight with its stallbreaking set.</p>"

      "Swords Dance (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Bisharp is an excellent setup sweeper for Steel teams. It deals with problematic Pokemon such as Blacephalon and Victini with its priority in Sucker Punch, and it has the sheer power to break down types such as Poison and Steel after a Swords Dance. Also, Defiant greatly synergizes with the tendency of Steel teams to stack entry hazards making Bisharp a very effective tool to deter Defog users such as Latias and Rotom-W. Knock Off makes progress against common walls such as Toxapex, Galarian Corsola, and Mantine, and it weakens Bisharp checks such as Celesteela, Body Press Corviknight, and Hydreigon as they switch in, removing their Leftovers. Iron Head greatly synergizes with Knock Off, dealing with Fairy-types such as Galarian Weezing and Clefable that resist Knock Off and do not mind losing their item. Sucker Punch circumvents Bisharp's low Speed, dealing with threats such as Nidoking, Excadrill, and Thundurus-T. Maximum Speed with an Adamant nature lets Bisharp outspeed most walls, including Mantine and specially defensive Heatran, while also outspeeding bulky threats such as Clefable, Volcanion, and Bulk Up Tapu Bulu. Black Glasses boosts Knock Off and Sucker Punch, the moves Bisharp will use most often, allowing it to OHKO Magnezone and Heatran at +2 with Knock Off. It also lets Sucker Punch pick off Victini with the slightest amount of chip damage. Alternatively, Life Orb lets Bisharp OHKO even Colbur Berry Slowbro and Toxapex with Knock Off, after a Swords Dance, Stealth Rock, and a layer of Spikes. It also boosts Iron Head, but Bisharp really just uses Knock Off and Sucker Punch most of the time, and Life Orb cuts into its longevity.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Skarmory pair extremely well with Bisharp, since Defiant deters response Defogs and benefits from them, and hazards also wear down walls such as Toxapex and Hippowdon, which normally check Bisharp. Ferrothorn also checks Barraskewda and wears down bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Slowbro and Hippowodon. Heatran is a Fire-immune teammate that also doubles as a temporary check to non-Earth Power Hydreigon, which can take advantage of Bisharp. In return, Bisharp deals with Galarian Slowking and opposing Heatran, which prevent Heatran from making progress. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Heatran deals with Tapu Koko and non-Choice Scarf Zarude, and it puts pressure on Bisharp's checks such as Toxapex, Cinderace, and Hydreigon. Ground-immune partners such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight are also appreciated, as these check threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Band Excadrill. Celesteela can also utilize Air Slash to deal with Iron Defense Kommo-o and trade with Urshifu-R, or it can use an Autotomize set, which takes advantage of Bisharp's ability to remove Galarian Slowking and Heatran. Corviknight provides pivoting in U-turn, allowing Bisharp to get more setup opportunities. Aegislash helps Bisharp overwhelm walls such as Gastrodon and Mantine with sets such as SubToxic and Choice Specs. Choice Scarf Excadrill benefits from Bisharp's ability to weaken or outright remove bulky Pokemon, such as Slowbro and Toxapex, as this allows Excadrill to clean types such as Dragon, Psychic, and Poison late-game. Choice Specs Jirachi deals with Fighting-types such as Kommo-o and Urshifu-R, and it is fast enough to threaten Nidoking and Hydreigon for Bisharp.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Braviary's great Attack stat, above-average Speed tier with a Choice Scarf, and access to high-Base Power moves in Brave Bird and Close Combat make it a powerful revenge killer for Normal teams. It can also serve as a late-game cleaner once its checks are severely weakened or fainted. Brave Bird is Braviary's main STAB attack, denting most non-resistant targets and picking off slower, weakened threats such as Mimikyu and Barraskewda outside of rain. Close Combat complements Brave Bird, as it hits Steel- and Rock-types like Bisharp and Tyranitar that resist its STAB attacks; however, it should be used cautiously, since it is much weaker without a STAB boost and can turn Braviary into setup fodder for the likes of Corviknight and Aegislash. A fast Defog provides Normal teams with a form of entry hazard removal, while U-turn takes advantage of forced switches to keep up momentum. Defiant is Braviary's only useful ability, allowing it to gain valuable Attack boosts by switching into the opponent's Defogger.</p> <p>Physical walls such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Mandibuzz stop Braviary in its tracks, so it appreciates having powerful wallbreakers like Choice Band Diggersby and Choice Specs Indeedee as teammates. Diggersby in particular can also use sets with Spikes, which pressures the opponent into using Defog and giving Braviary a Defiant boost. In return, Braviary takes out faster threats like Dragapult and blows away entry hazards from the field. Ditto is another good partner because it forms a revenge killing duo with Braviary versus offensive teams and serves as a backup switch-in to defensive Pokemon that Braviary can't break. With its part-Electric typing, good coverage, and Dry Skin, Heliolisk can pressure Steel-, Ground-, and Water-type teams for Braviary, enabling it to be more effective in said matchups. Lastly, Obstagoon and Snorlax synergize well with Braviary by absorbing much-hated status and dealing with some of its checks, namely Aegislash, Galarian Corsola, and Corviknight.</p>"

      "Defensive (Normal)": {
        "description": "<p>On Normal balance teams, defensive Braviary acts as a great pivot and Defogger. Its Flying typing gives Normal teams an incredibly valuable Ground-type immunity and Fighting-type neutrality, and it gives Braviary a powerful STAB Brave Bird to hit opposing Fighting-types super effectively. Roost allows Braviary to effectively wall offensive foes like Rillaboom and Heracross while keeping itself healthy to keep taking hits for its teammates. Defog most notably removes Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web that would heavily cripple the offensive capabilities of Braviary's teammates. This works well with U-turn, allowing Braviary to create immediate offensive presence by pivoting in threatening teammates. Maximum HP investment and 240 Defense EVs allow Braviary to take physical hits like Excadrill's Iron Head, Cinderace's High Jump Kick, and Mimikyu's unboosted Play Rough. 16 EVs in Speed allows Braviary to outrun Belly Drum Azumarill and do major damage to it with Brave Bird, since it survives an Aqua Jet. Its spread paired with Heavy-Duty Boots and an Impish nature allows Braviary to be a very consistent and effective physical wall that can Defog in front of most threats.</p> <p>Braviary enables all of Normal's offensive Pokemon by pivoting them in with U-turn and removing troublesome entry hazards with Defog. Diggersby, for example, greatly appreciates Braviary's pivot support and removal of Toxic Spikes, as being poisoned can make it hard for Diggersby to stay as a consistent threat throughout the match. Other examples include Heliolisk and Bewear, which pressure Water- and Dark-types like Keldeo and Bisharp more easily with hazards gone; Obstagoon and Indeedee, which terrorize the opponent far more consistently with Sticky Web and Stealth Rock gone; and Snorlax, which cherishes Braviary's ability to take Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Zeraora. In return, these offensive Pokemon remove many of the threats that would force Braviary out. Chansey particularly appreciates Braviary's ability to remove hazards, as its inability to run Heavy-Duty Boots makes it harder for it to switch into attacks when hazards are present. Braviary in turn appreciates Blissey's own pivot support and its ability to take special hits like Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and Volcarona's +1 Fire Blast or Flamethrower. Ditto is also a great teammate for Braviary, as it can check out-of-control setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Excadrill.</p>"

In addition, it provides a valuable neutrality to Fighting, taking pressure off of Sableye. Foul Play punishes physical setup sweepers such as Dragapult and Dragonite, and it also deters threats such as Victini and Excadrill from staying in. U-turn allows Mandibuzz to act as a slow pivot, safely bringing in teammates such as Weavile and Hydreigon to take advantage of Pokemon such as Kyurem and Toxapex, which come in on it. Toxic debilitates opposing walls such as Swampert and Hippowdon. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Mandibuzz to switch in freely without fear of taking Stealth Rock damage. 16 Speed EVs allow Mandibuzz to outspeed Belly Drum Azumarill and heavily damage it with Foul Play.</p> <p>All of Mandibuzz's teammates appreciate it bringing them in safely and preventing entry hazards like Stealth Rock from wearing them down. As a result of its part-Flying type, Mandibuzz offers a neutrality to Bug and Fighting, which teammates such as Hydreigon, Zarude, and Tyranitar appreciate. Weavile appreciates Mandibuzz removing Stealth Rock, allowing it to come in more frequently. In return, Weavile can take care of foes such as Galarian Moltres, which would otherwise use Mandibuzz as setup fodder. Hydreigon and Zarude can take care of Steel- and Water-types for Mandibuzz, notably Ferrothorn and Urshifu-R, respectively. Specially defensive Tyranitar can take on special attackers like Tapu Lele, Hatterene, and Choice Specs Zapdos that threaten Mandibuzz. Bisharp forces progress against the opposing team by removing items, checks Fairy-types like Hatterene, and appreciates Mandibuzz's ability to pivot it in safely. Drapion deals with Tapu Lele and provides Toxic Spikes, which synergizes with Mandibuzz's ability to force switches. In return, Mandibuzz checks Ground-types like Excadrill and Garchomp, which helps the aforementioned Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Drapion. Another good teammate can be found in Sableye, as it not only takes pressure off of Mandibuzz as a Fighting-type switch-in, but it can deal with Iron Defense Kommo-o and Body Press Corviknight too. All of these Pokemon can also absorb Knock Off for Mandibuzz, lest it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

Superpower lets Durant hit Steel-types such as Excadrill and Ferrothorn, while Rock Slide targets Flying- and Fire-types such as Mandibuzz and Centiskorch, preventing these Pokemon from reliably switching in and checking Durant. Iron Head gives Durant a reliable attack that does not lower its stats, while Crunch can be used to threaten Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Jellicent.</p> <p>Durant should generally avoid switching into strong attackers directly due to its poor bulk, instead utilizing predicted double switches or switching in after a teammate is KOed. Durant should try to inflict as much damage as possible once switched in, using First Impression to hit faster threats for high damage and using Superpower or Rock Slide to deal with potential defensive switch-ins, such as Lucario and Charizard. Durant's ability to dispose of fast threats is greatly appreciated by defensive teammates such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Ferrothorn's Grass typing and access to Leech Seed allow it to check Water-types such as Seismitoad and Gyarados that Durant can struggle with and it can also use Stealth Rock or Spikes to weaken Pokemon such as Dracovish so that Durant can KO them with First Impression. Corviknight provides a Ground immunity and can take advantage of Durant's checks such as Toxapex and Aegislash with Taunt. Melmetal is a monstrously powerful wallbreaker that can use its wide movepool to break past Pokemon such as Toxapex and Corviknight that can easily switch into Durant. Aegislash is a bulky attacker that can utilize Toxic or Choice Specs to wear down or break through teams for Durant to clean late-game, while also pressuring Ghost-types that resist First Impression, such as Gengar, with Shadow Ball. In exchange, Durant can threaten Dark-types such as Bisharp and Hydreigon that can try to take advantage of Aegislash. Choice Scarf Duraludon can alleviate pressure from Durant in checking fast threats and can Draco Meteor and Thunderbolt to KO Pokemon such as Dragapult and Pelipper for Durant. Bisharp can utilize Swords Dance and Knock Off to break past bulky Pokemon such as Toxapex and Sableye, allowing Durant to pose a larger threat to teams late-game, as well as Sucker Punch to threaten faster offensive teams in conjunction with Durant.</p>"

A Modest nature can be used to OHKO Ferrothorn without a Nasty Plot boost, but the drop in Speed leaves Hydreigon vulnerable to Kyurem, Excadrill, and Nidoking. A Choice Specs set with Fire Blast, Draco Meteor, Dark Pulse, and Flash Cannon allows Hydreigon to immediately wallbreak and help in Ground, Steel, Ghost, Psychic, and Fairy matchups. A Choice Scarf set may also be considered, as it can OHKO Galarian Darmanitan with Fire Blast and Alolan Ninetales with Flash Cannon, but Hydreigon will struggle to break bulkier Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Gastrodon.

Roost allows Volcarona to keep itself healthy and set up easily against types like Electric, Ghost, Dragon, and Psychic without getting worn out. Bug Buzz allows Volcarona to threaten Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Tyranitar, which can shrug off other attacks from it. It also has the added benefit of hitting Pokemon behind Substitute like Heliolisk and Seismitoad. Volcarona should seek opportunities to set up against Pokemon that do not threaten it like Mew and Galarian Weezing. It should be used mid- or late-game once its checks and counters like Incineroar, Snorlax, and specially defensive Toxapex are taken out or weakened enough. Maximum Special Attack EVs optimize its overall damage output, while maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Volcarona to Speed tie with other base 100 Speed Pokemon and outspeed slower Pokemon like Excadrill, Indeedee-M, and Hydreigon. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Volcarona is not susceptible to any form of entry hazard, which can otherwise undermine its ability as a setup sweeper.</p> <p>Physical attackers like Cinderace, Darmanitan, and Alolan Marowak appreciate Volcarona taking on physical walls like Slowbro and Seismitoad. In return, they threaten special walls like Tyranitar if Volcarona is not running Bug Buzz and take on Dark teams as a whole. Torkoal is the premier support Pokemon and a great partner, as it provides Volcarona with important Drought support; this not only allows it to hit much harder with sun-boosted Fire Blast, but it also reduces the damage from Water-type moves, giving it the opportunity to set up against Pokemon like Rotom-W. Yawn support from Torkoal lets Volcarona set up more easily against an asleep foe. Incineroar with its Knock Off and Taunt utility can weaken defensive cores of Normal- and Poison-type teams, letting Volcarona wreak havoc after a Quiver Dance boost. Charizard can wallbreak in sun thanks to its ability Solar Power and take on Pokemon like Choice Scarf Dracovish, which Volcarona cannot handle without setting up. Additionally, they form a good core against Dragon-type teams. Rotom-H can provide Volcarona with dual screen support, which lets Volcarona set up much more easily, or it can use a Nasty Plot set to weaken shared checks like Toxapex and Mantine. Salazzle can cripple troublesome Pokemon like Mantine, Jellicent, and specially defensive Toxapex, which can prove to be a pain otherwise for Volcarona.</p>"

Mantine makes itself useful due to its immunity to Water, assisting Thundurus-T by switching into the majority of Water teams, while stopping setup sweepers such as Keldeo with Haze and removing Stealth Rock, which Thundurus-T is weak to. Choice Band Galarian Zapdos helps break through bulky Pokemon that force Thundurus-T out, such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking, and can also pivot with U-turn on bulky Pokemon that Thundurus can defeat such as Toxapex and Slowbro.

Besides the aforementioned targets, Choice Scarf allows Landorus-T to outspeed and remove threats such as Slush Rush Arctozolt under hail, Zeraora, and Nihilego.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Landorus-T is unfortunately outsped by faster Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Lele, Galarian Darmanitan, and Latias, so Pokemon that can switch into them such as Corviknight and Celesteela are greatly appreciated. Galarian Moltres appreciates it baiting in defensive Pokemon such as Slowbro and Amoonguss that Galarian Moltres can set up on. Landorus-T running Choice Scarf lets Galarian Zapdos and Thundurus-T run non-Choice Scarf sets such as Choice Band and Heavy-Duty Boots, respectively. Choice Band Galarian Zapdos pressures slower teams such as Poison and Steel, while Heavy-Duty Boots Thundurus-T can devastate teams such as Water, Poison, and Flying due to its colorful coverage. Dragon Dance Dragonite is a strong setup sweeper that covers for Landorus-T's vulnerability to Water and can break down Steel, Water, and Electric teams late-game. Tornadus-T wears down the opposing team, provides Defog, and spreads status with a utility set. Zapdos takes advantage of physical walls such as Slowbro and Ferrothorn with a Choice Specs set, or it can function as a defensive pivot that wears down opposing defensive Pokemon such as Rotom-W and opposing Landorus-T.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Bulk Up Landorus-T is a great asset to Ground teams because it checks Poison and Steel teams effortlessly, and it's nearly unbreakable for physical attackers once set up. Substitute lets Landorus-T set up on passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Amoonguss. Gravity allows Landorus-T to threaten Pokemon immune to Earthquake such as Celesteela, Crobat, and Galarian Weezing. The given EV spread allows Landorus-T's Substitute to withstand Amoonguss's Giga Drain or Foul Play and outspeed Choice Band Victini post-V-create, Scizor, and Aegislash.</p> <p>Landorus-T's typing gives it a Grass neutrality and a Ground immunity, which helps it cover for teammates such as Gastrodon, Excadrill, and Nidoking. In return, Excadrill threatens Tapu Bulu, Kyurem, and Weavile in sand, which are extremely threatening to Landorus-T and Ground teams as a whole. Nidoking is a special wallbreaker that can deal with Skarmory, Tapu Bulu, and Slowbro, which are otherwise difficult to handle. Mamoswine can sponge Ice-type moves from Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales, and it can remove threats like Hydreigon, Dragapult, and Landorus-T. Gastrodon and Seismitoad provide a Water immunity and can check Rotom-W, Pelipper, and Tapu Fini. Hippowdon provides residual damage on foes such as Tapu Fini and Amoonguss with Stealth Rock and sand, helping Landorus-T to break through them. Garchomp is an effective teammate, as it can set up with Swords Dance and deal with the likes of Kyurem, Amoonguss, and Celesteela while also benefiting from Landorus-T's Gravity.</p>"

Earthquake specifically lets Landorus-T check Adamant Alolan Sandslash in hail, Toxapex, and Nidoking. Stone Edge lets it check Ice- and Flying-type threats like Alolan Ninetales and Thundurus-T. Knock Off cripples common switch-ins such as Galarian Corsola, Slowbro, and Porygon2. U-turn allows Landorus-T to preserve momentum, escaping common unfavorable switch-ins such as Amoonguss, Zarude, and Galarian Weezing.</p> <p>Mamoswine checks Ice-types that threaten Landorus-T, like Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales. Gastrodon absorbs Water-type moves from Urshifu-R and Barraskewda. Excadrill can remove Stealth Rock for Landorus-T with Rapid Spin and takes on threats like Tapu Bulu, Zarude, and Keldeo under sand. It can partially deal with Ice-types because of its Steel typing, and it resists Dragon- and Psychic-type attacks. Nidoking can break through physical walls such as Skarmory, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, which are hard to remove with Landorus-T. Garchomp can provide exceptional wallbreaking with its Swords Dance sets against Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Celesteela.</p>"

Kyurem's high Special Attack, alongside great coverage, allows it to be extremely useful in the Water, Electric, and Flying matchups. However, Pokemon like Volcarona and Scizor can use Kyurem as setup bait to sweep. Unfortunately, Kyurem's Speed leaves it slower than threats such as Cinderace, Galarian Zapdos, and Zeraora.</p>",

Similarly, a Choice Scarf set may be considered, as it lets Kyurem outspeed and OHKO would-be checks like Tapu Koko, Keldeo, and Dragapult, but common Choice Scarf users such as Blacephalon and Latios still outspeed it, and the drop in power and longevity reduces its ability to break through defensive cores.</p> <h4>Dragon</h4> <p>Chople Berry may be used to let Kyurem lure in and remove threats such as Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos, but because Dragon teams have poor entry hazard control, the chip damage from entry hazards hinders Kyurem's ability to readily pressure passive teams. Leftovers may be used on Dragon Dance sets to increase Kyurem's stalling ability but again leaves it worn down by entry hazards.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Melmetal</strong>: Melmetal can take an Earth Power from Kyurem and OHKO it behind Substitute using Double Iron Bash.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Band Urshifu-R, Garchomp, Latios, and Dragapult outspeed Kyurem and OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Although Kyurem can avoid status with Substitute, it is still vulnerable on the turn it enters the field. Toxic puts Kyurem on a timer, which reduces its ability to check defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Blissey effectively. Be wary of Toxic from Crobat, as it goes through Substitute due to Infiltrator. Paralysis cripples Kyurem's ability to threaten offensive teams, as it makes Kyurem's middling Speed even worse.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Celesteela and Tyranitar can switch into Kyurem and break its Substitute, but the former must be concerned about getting PP stalled, and the latter must be wary of taking chip damage from Earth Power.</p>",

Freeze-Dry allows Kyurem to pressure Water-types such as Toxapex, Pelipper, and Gastrodon, breaking through bulky Water-type cores to allow its teammates to sweep late-game. Ice Beam is a great move to use against Flying and Ground teams and allows Kyurem to 2HKO Pokemon such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Draco Meteor is a very strong option that hits any unresisted foe for massive damage, such as Rotom-H and Torkoal. Earth Power allows Kyurem to nail threats such as Aegislash and Bisharp.

Kyurem appreciates Choice Scarf Dragapult as a teammate, as it is able to outspeed and OHKO faster threats such as Hydreigon, Barraskewda, and Kingdra.

As a stallbreaker, Keldeo punishes walls like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and defensive Seismitoad by stopping their dangerous passive moves like Toxic, Haze, Recover, and entry hazards with Taunt. With Calm Mind, it can set up to beat these walls while also letting Keldeo KO Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Corviknight. These boosts with Calm Mind also allow it to break Pokemon like Mandibuzz, Mew, and Aegislash with Hydro Pump. Scald can be used as an alternative to Hydro Pump due to its more reliable accuracy and chance to burn opposing Pokemon; however, the caveat to using this move is that it is significantly weaker than Hydro Pump without Calm Mind boosts. Keldeo's STAB move in Focus Blast allows it to break Steel-, Dark-, and Normal-types like Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Hydreigon, Indeedee, and Snorlax that Water teams would otherwise have a tough time getting through. Keldeo runs maximum EVs in both Speed and Special Attack so that it can maximize its offensive presence and outspeed key Pokemon like Hydreigon and Indeedee. This offensive presence is supported by Leftovers, which allows Keldeo to become more threatening when it sets up and also recovers health.</p> <p>Keldeo forms a very strong offensive core with Pokemon like Primarina and Crawdaunt. Primarina appreciates Keldeo's ability to stallbreak and allows it to clean late-game with its Calm Mind set. Crawdaunt can also switch into Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Reuniclus and use its powerful Knock Off and Liquidation to break teams down. While Keldeo's ability to be an oppressive offensive threat is incredibly valuable, it still needs support from a lot of other Pokemon to achieve this goal. Defensive Pokemon in Seismitoad and Toxapex provide the team with an Electric immunity and a Grass neutrality, respectively. Seismitoad also provides Stealth Rock support while Toxapex offers support through Toxic, Toxic Spikes, spreading Scald burns, and wearing down opposing Pokemon to make it easier for Keldeo to break through them. Rotom-W is also a great partner, as it is able to switch into Flying-type attacks from the likes of Corviknight and Togekiss and can answer back with its own STAB Electric-type moves. It also provides Defog support to prevent Keldeo from being worn down by Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, and other entry hazards. Pelipper can assist Keldeo by getting rid of key Grass-type Pokemon like Vileplume and Virizion with its STAB Hurricane, as well as support Keldeo with Drizzle, bolstering the power of Keldeo's Hydro Pump. Cloyster is another teammate that helps deal with Grass-types as well as Dragon- and Flying-types for Keldeo and appreciates its ability to keep Stealth Rock and other hazards off the field with Taunt. Lastly, Araquanid is a great support Pokemon, as it can not only threaten Psychic-types like Gardevoir, but also use Sticky Web to allow Keldeo to threaten more Pokemon, namely Heliolisk and Choice Scarf Indeedee.</p>"

This along with its STAB Aura Sphere eviscerating most Normal- and Steel-types like Indeedee, Bewear, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp makes it extremely hard to switch into. Secret Sword is a good alternative to Aura Sphere if the little extra power and the ability to hit the Defense stat as opposed to the Special Defense stat is preferred, which is key in dealing with Pokemon like Snorlax. Keldeo also uses Icy Wind to hit some would-be threats on the switch such as Noivern, Vileplume, and Dragapult, and Scald to have a more reliable Water-type STAB move when needed. In order for it to maximize its offensive presence, Keldeo runs full EV investment in both Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature. This boost in Speed allows it to outspeed key Pokemon like Mimikyu, Modest Alolan Raichu, and non-Choice Scarf Jirachi naturally.</p> <p>Keldeo's offensive presence and ability to break open holes in the opposing team make it great as a partner for setup sweepers like Gyarados and Cloyster. Keldeo also helps get rid of prominent Grass-types like Appletun and Vileplume with Icy Wind. Crawdaunt and Primarina are offensive partners that can help out Keldeo by getting rid of annoying Psychic- and Dragon-types, respectively, while switching into their respective types. Crawdaunt in particular, while able to greatly improve the Steel matchup alongside Keldeo, also helps check Jellicent which completely walls Keldeo. Rotom-W is also a very invaluable teammate for Keldeo, as it can take Flying-type attacks from the likes of Corviknight and Togekiss and threaten them out with its own Electric-type STAB move and pivot using Volt Switch. It can also use a Substitute + Nasty Plot set that can break Pokemon like Jellicent and Toxapex, as well as provide support through Defog, which prevents Keldeo from getting worn down from hazards. Seismitoad allows Keldeo to have Stealth Rock support as well as providing it a switch-in to Electric-type attacks. Toxapex also helps take Grass-type attacks for Keldeo as a defensive pivot while using Toxic or Toxic Spikes to help wear down the opposing team. Pelipper sets rain, which gives Keldeo ludicrous amounts of power with its Hydro Pump and allows partners like Dracovish to help clean teams that were weakened by Keldeo's wallbreaking power.

Secret Sword defeats Pokemon that would otherwise switch into its Water-type attacks easily, such as Volcanion, Gastrodon, and Chansey. Scald is used alongside Hydro Pump to avoid risking a miss when Hydro Pump's power isn't needed, compensate for Hydro Pump's lacking PP, and burn foes that can switch into Keldeo such as Kommo-o and Dragonite. Flip Turn allows Keldeo to maintain momentum and take advantage of common switch-ins such as Toxapex, Slowking, and Galarian Slowking. Icy Wind can be used over Flip Turn to ease Keldeo's matchup against the aforementioned Dragon-types in Kommo-o and Dragonite, helping Fighting teams deal with them and shutting down their setup opportunities with Dragon Dance by reducing their Speed.</p> <p>Cobalion provides a Fairy and Psychic neutrality and can deal with Pokemon such as Clefable and Hatterene, albeit in a limited fashion, as its bulk leaves much to be desired. It also provides utility with Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave.

Choice Band Galarian Zapdos is a threatening wallbreaker that muscles past Pokemon that Fighting struggles to combat, such as Slowbro, Celesteela, and Toxapex. Choice Scarf Terrakion provides a revenge killer, late-game cleaner, and way to defeat Flying-type Pokemon such as Thundurus-T and Zapdos. It also outspeeds and beats Electric-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko.

Flash Cannon is Aegislash's secondary STAB attack and is primarily used against Pokemon weak to Steel or against Pokemon that resist or are immune to Shadow Ball such as Indeedee and Grimmsnarl. Steel Beam is Aegislash's most powerful attack at the cost of cutting half of its HP, which is why it should only be used when Aegislash needs to OHKO a threat such as omni-boosted Kommo-o or Mandibuzz. Aegislash has high Attack despite having a Modest nature, which allows it to effectively run Shadow Sneak so it can revenge kill weakened threats such as Keldeo, Chandelure, and Alolan Raichu. Stance Change is part of the reason why Aegislash is such a great wallbreaker, because it can take a hit before changing to Blade forme and use a powerful attack. Maximum investment in HP allows Aegislash to take attacks such as Choice Specs Shadow Ball from Dragapult in Shield forme due to its amazing bulk. Alternatively, maximum Speed can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Crawdaunt and Corviknight. Aegislash should be used to wallbreak early- to mid-game and clear the way for its teammates to win.</p> <p>Corviknight is a great partner, as it covers Aegislash's Ground weakness and makes a great pivot to attacks that threaten Aegislash such as Indeedee's Mystical Fire and Gengar's Shadow Ball. Ferrothorn gets up entry hazards to weaken the opposing team and put them in range of Aegislash's attacks. It also works well with Aegislash in dealing with Choice Specs Keldeo, as Ferrothorn resists Water-type attacks and can scout with Protect, while Aegislash is immune to Fighting-type attacks. Ferrothorn can also support Aegislash with its Leech Seed and let it recover back some HP. Melmetal forms a very powerful offensive core with Choice Specs Aegislash, being able to break through the majority of the metagame. Choice Scarf Excadrill is a good revenge killer capable of dealing with threats such as Chandelure and Rotom-H. Bisharp works well with Aegislash in overwhelming Psychic- and Ghost-type teams and is also valuable in other matchups thanks to its ability to revenge kill threats such as Alolan Raichu, Dragapult, Venusaur in sun, and Seismitoad in rain with Sucker Punch. Choice Scarf Duraludon can revenge kill Dragon-types that Aegislash has trouble with such as Hydreigon and Dragapult. Jirachi can check Keldeo with Psychic, provide Healing Wish support for Aegislash, and run Trick Room to allow Aegislash to take advantage of its mediocre Speed. Bronzong is another option for Trick Room-oriented teams.</p>"

      "SubToxic (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its great defensive typing and amazing bulk in Shield forme combined with Toxic, Substitute, and its signature move King's Shield, Aegislash is able to annoy teams with Toxic stall while also applying offensive pressure with Shadow Ball due to its naturally high Special Attack. It can use Substitute on Pokemon that can't break through it, such as Jirachi and Celebi, and use Shadow Ball to deal damage or Toxic on a predicted switch. Toxic works well with King's Shield and Substitute to stall out the opposing Pokemon. King's Shield is also incredibly useful for scouting Choice item users such as Keldeo and Zeraora, switching to Shield forme so Aegislash can take attacks such as Shadow Ball from opposing Choice Specs Dragapult and Aegislash and OHKO them, as well as regain health with Leftovers and stall out weather. Shadow Ball threatens some common Toxic switch-ins such as Jirachi, Hatterene, and Celebi and does decent damage to Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Full investment in HP and Special Defense is used to maximize Aegislash's special bulk and allow it to take attacks such as Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump from Pelipper and unboosted Weather Ball from Venusaur in sun.</p> <p>Corviknight and Ferrothorn form a great defensive core with Aegislash, as they're able to cover a lot of each other's weaknesses. Aegislash can check Pokemon that threaten the other two, such as Dragapult and Choice Specs Aegislash, and provides a valuable Fighting immunity. Corviknight is able to switch in on Ground-type attacks that threaten Aegislash and check Fighting-types that annoy Ferrothorn with Brave Bird. Ferrothorn switches in on strong Water-type attacks that the other two can't take very well such as Choice Specs Keldeo's Hydro Pump, which Ferrothorn and Aegislash are able to beat thanks to their shared ability to scout its move with Protect or King's Shield. Ferrothorn also provides Leech Seed support for additional recovery and sets up entry hazards. Choice Scarf Duraludon is a good partner because it's able to revenge kill Hydreigon and is great against Dragon-type teams. Choice Scarf Excadrill is another great revenge killer and deals with threats such as Chandelure and Zeraora. Jirachi is capable of handling Keldeo thanks to its STAB Psychic, breaking Corviknight and Toxapex with the combination of Calm Mind, Psychic, and Thunderbolt, and supporting Aegislash with Healing Wish. Bisharp is a strong wallbreaker and is especially good against Psychic- and Ghost-type teams together with Aegislash.</p>"

Shadow Claw is Aegislash's main STAB move and serves to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types. Shadow Sneak serves as a STAB priority move that helps to cover its horrendous Speed stat and revenge kill weakened foes. Close Combat is used in order to hit Steel-, Rock-, and Normal-types such as Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Indeedee. Weakness Policy takes advantage of Aegislash's ability to take powerful hits and boost its Attack to help it sweep more easily. Aegislash can be used early-game to weaken the opposing team to give its teammates the capability to sweep late-game, or as a late-game sweeper with its priority move in Shadow Sneak being able to KO weakened threats.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters like Spikes Ferrothorn or Stealth Rock Duraludon helps Aegislash to sweep more easily late-game. Bisharp is also a good teammate, because the combination of both is very difficult for Ghost and Psychic teams to handle, as they can wear them down with their priority moves. Other late-game sweepers such as Choice Scarf Excadrill are also good partners for Aegislash, being able to clean remaining Pokemon after an Aegislash sweep. Aegislash fails to defeat Dark-type Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, so having a teammate that can take advantage of them like Bulk Up Corviknight is nice, too.</p>"

Liquidation dismantles threats such as Choice Scarf Terrakion, Nidoking, and Mamoswine. Due to Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad tanking Barbaracle's STAB moves, Grass Knot is run to utilize the Special Attack boosts from Shell Smash to muscle past them. Stone Edge combats Pokemon like Mantine, Kyurem, and Volcanion, which are either immune or resistant to Liquidation and don't mind Grass Knot. The given EV spread maximizes Barbaracle's Speed, which allows it to outpace Choice Scarf users such as Urshifu-R, Landorus-T, and Galarian Zapdos after a Shell Smash. A Naive nature maximizes Speed without hindering Grass Knot's power.</p> <p>Barbaracle can quickly sweep Ground teams due to Liquidation and Grass Knot. Shuckle can set up Stealth Rock to provide chip damage on foes and Sticky Web to slow down threats that would otherwise threaten Barbaracle, such as Excadrill in sand and Choice Scarf Weavile, letting it clean Ground and Ice teams. Tyranitar supports Barbaracle with sand to chip foes like Polteageist and Cloyster, rendering their Focus Sashes useless, and boost Barbaracle's Special Defense. Additionally, Tyranitar breaks past walls that annoy Barbaracle like Slowbro, Bronzong, and Galarian Corsola with a Choice Band set. Choice Scarf Terrakion deals with Choice Scarf Zarude, Ferrothorn, and Cinderace. Nihilego takes care of physically defensive walls that Barbaracle struggles against like Slowbro, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Furthermore, Nihilego checks Grass-types like Zarude and Tapu Bulu. Rhyperior blanket checks many physical attackers like Excadrill, Cinderace, and Weavile because of its ability Solid Rock and good bulk.

Because teams like Psychic and Ground teams have Poison-types that absorb Toxic Spikes, a set with Rest, Sleep Talk, Gunk Shot, and Flip Turn may be considered for more longevity. However, Toxic Spikes goes a long way against types such as Normal and Fairy, easing would-be difficult matchups for Dragon teams. Payapa Berry may be used to properly check Tapu Lele and Volcarona, which may otherwise remove Dragalge with their Psychic-type attacks, but the lack of Black Sludge recovery makes it easier to wear down.</p>",

Its Poison typing also allows Dragalge to take Fairy-type attacks from foes like Tapu Fini and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and remove opposing Toxic Spikes. With its typing and immense Special Defense, Dragalge can blanket check special attackers such as Tapu Koko, Nihilego, and Galarian Moltres, although Choice Specs Aegislash, for example, can 2HKO it. Adaptability-boosted Gunk Shot deals solid overall damage, nails the aforementioned Fairy-types, and threatens Calm Mind users such as Clefable and Hatterene because it's physical. Dragalge's low Speed lets it put Flip Turn to excellent use, bringing in teammates such as Kyurem and Hydreigon safely against Pokemon it underspeeds, such as Toxapex, that like to spread status. Protect scouts Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Tapu Lele, Jirachi, and Gengar, while providing an extra turn of Black Sludge recovery and Toxic Spikes damage. 24 Speed IVs along with a Sassy nature allow Dragalge to underspeed Toxapex, thus sponging its status-inflicting moves such as Scald and Toxic before pivoting with Flip Turn, while outspeeding Hatterene outside of Trick Room to 2HKO it.</p> <p>Substitute users such as Kyurem and Hydreigon appreciate Toxic Spikes greatly, as it continually helps them break through types like Normal, Fairy, and Ground more consistently. Furthermore, Dragalge can act as a slow pivot for the two with Flip Turn. In return, Kyurem can crush Water-types that don't fear Dragalge such as Gastrodon and Toxapex with Freeze-Dry, while Hydreigon provides a Psychic immunity, and it takes advantage of Steel- and Poison-types such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex that switch into Dragalge. Choice Scarf Dragapult is an excellent revenge killer that threatens foes like Kingdra in rain, Choice Scarf Weavile, and Dragon Dance Dragapult with its almost unresisted STAB combination. Toxic Spikes from Dragalge enables Dragapult's Hex and puts defensive checks of Dragon Dance Dragapult, such as Kasib Berry Slowbro and Hippowdon, on a timer. Furthermore, its Ghost typing lets Dragapult spinblock against foes like Excadrill and Torkoal to keep Toxic Spikes up. Garchomp also benefits from Dragalge's slow pivoting abilities, taking advantage of Pokemon such as Toxapex and Klefki, which come in on Dragalge. Garchomp can also utilize a Choice Scarf set to threaten Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan, Cinderace, and Zeraora. Latias provides a Ground immunity and runs Healing Wish, which lets Dragalge have a second chance in checking Tapu Lele or Tapu Fini. Duraludon is another good partner for Dragalge, as the duo forms a good defensive backbone thanks to Duraludon's good physical bulk. Thanks to its Steel typing, Duraludon can switch into Choice Scarf Jirachi's Iron Head and threaten it with Thunder Wave, and it handles Physical Fairy- and Ice-types such as Azumarill, Mimikyu, Choice Scarf Cloyster, and Weavile. Dragonite provides a Ground immunity to check Mold Breaker Excadrill, and it can either take advantage of Toxic Spikes wearing down walls with a Dragon Dance set or provide Defog support with a defensive set.</p>"

Its above average Speed lets it outspeed common Pokemon like Indeedee and pivot out on them with Volt Switch to a suitable teammate if it cannot deal with them, allowing it to maintain momentum for the team. Grass Knot lets it pressure Ground-type teams and in combination with its STAB Electric-type move, it becomes a headache for Water-type teams to deal with, making such matchups relatively easier for Normal-type teams to handle. Focus Blast lets it beat Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Excadrill that normally can switch into Heliolisk. Its ability Dry Skin is quite handy too, as it lets it pivot on defensive Pokemon like Toxapex. Maximum Speed investment makes Heliolisk as fast as possible, and maximum Special Attack investment with a Choice Specs bolsters its damage output. Expert Belt can be used to bluff a Choice item and boost super effective damage, as it synergizes well with its coverage.</p> <p>Snorlax and Braviary are good teammates for Heliolisk, as they both appreciate it dealing with troublesome Steel-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Excadrill. In return, Thick Fat Snorlax checks Fire-type Pokemon for Heliolisk, and Choice Scarf Braviary can beat Fighting-type Pokemon like Gallade for it. Choice Scarf Braviary and Heliolisk form a threatening VoltTurn core, too. Choice Band Diggersby appreciates Volt Switch support from Heliolisk, giving it more chances to wallbreak and deal with Pokemon like Ferrothorn with Fire Punch, relieving the pressure from Heliolisk. Indeedee can wallbreak for Heliolisk and provide it with Psychic Terrain, allowing Heliolisk to revenge kill Pokemon like Lucario for the team.

Glare allows it to paralyze faster threats such as Kingdra under rain and Choice Scarf Cobalion when Heliolisk is behind a Substitute. Glare mainly allows it to spread status well due to only Electric-type Pokemon being immune to it. Thunderbolt permits it to threaten Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Toxapex, Mantine, and Corviknight. Grass Knot grants Heliolisk the ability to target Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, Mamoswine, and Rhyperior. The combination of Thunderbolt and Grass Knot allows Heliolisk to threaten every Water-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Substitute allows Heliolisk to take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Mantine, Toxapex, and specially defensive Aegislash. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Heliolisk to ignore entry hazards that will hinder it such as Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes. However, Leftovers can be used to passively regain health, giving it more opportunities to set up a Substitute. Dry Skin grants Heliolisk an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to switch into attacks such as Dracovish's Fishious Rend and Azumarill's Aqua Jet, which can otherwise devastate Normal teams. Maximum EVs in Special Attack and Speed ensure it is as powerful as possible and faster than Pokemon such as Keldeo. Heliolisk should try to set up a Substitute against Water teams, especially on passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mantine or Pokemon Choice-locked into a Water-type attack such as Choice Scarf Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. Substitute then allows it to severely threaten Water teams. Outside of the Water and Flying matchups, Heliolisk's main job is to be spreading paralysis with Glare, which can be done more easily if it's behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Heliolisk supports its offensive teammates with Glare, allowing them to outspeed threats such as Hydreigon. Blissey is a fantastic partner, as it can switch into a plethora of attacks for it such as Rotom-H's Overheat and Indeedee's Expanding Force. In addition, Blissey can set Stealth Rock for Heliolisk, allowing it to break past Pokemon such as Keldeo and Togekiss more easily. Finally, it can also pivot with Teleport to bring in Heliolisk safely. Ditto is a great way to check faster Pokemon such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Cinderace. Braviary is an important teammate when Heliolisk is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can clear hazards off the field, which is crucial for Heliolisk due to its weakness to Toxic Spikes and Sticky Web. This is especially important against Water teams. Diggersby, Bewear, and Obstagoon can break through special walls for Heliolisk such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Celebi, and Tyranitar. Diggersby can also take on Fire- and Poison-type Pokemon such as Torkoal, Incineroar, and Salazzle. Obstagoon can help Heliolisk in the Psychic- and Ghost-type matchups by taking on Pokemon such as Mew and Alolan Marowak. Bewear is the best check to threats such as Urshifu-S, as Fluffy alongside a Chople Berry can make that matchup manageable. In return, Heliolisk can slow down faster Pokemon such as Hydreigon with Glare for them.</p>"

With White Herb, it can set up Unburden in front of any Pokemon that isn't a Ghost-type with Close Combat, and use either Acrobatics or Brave Bird to hit most of the tier very hard. Brave Bird is especially useful in matchups like Ghost, where activating White Herb is impossible due to everything being immune to Close Combat. Swords Dance is used to further boost its power in front of walls such as Ferrothorn on Steel.

The HP investment allows Noivern to always avoid the OHKO from Adamant Cloyster's Ice Shard, as well as letting it switch into Choice Specs Dragapult's Thunderbolt more comfortably, while still having enough Speed to outspeed common Choice Scarf users like Gengar, Terrakion, and Charizard. Infiltrator is particularly good for ignoring Aurora Veil and screens from Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Duraludon, as well as for hitting Pokemon such as Whimsicott, Hydreigon, and Salazzle behind a Substitute, improving Noivern's revenge killing capabilities.</p> <p>Choice Specs Charizard is a great teammate for Noivern, as it can beat Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight that Noivern struggles against, as well as break walls such as Toxapex and Tyranitar. In return, Noivern can outspeed and revenge kill Dragon-type Pokemon such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Choice Scarf Dracovish Charizard has trouble with. Corviknight can use Defog to remove Stealth Rock to keep Noivern healthy and bring it in safely in the Dragon matchup with U-turn, as well as being able to switch into Ice- and Fairy-type attacks such as Weavile's Icicle Crash and Gardevoir's Moonblast. Alternatively, its access to Taunt and Bulk Up allows it to beat defensive Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Snorlax, and Aegislash. Togekiss can switch into Choice Scarf Dragapult, which would otherwise outspeed Noivern and beat it with Draco Meteor, as well as break down bulky defensive walls like Toxapex, Galarian Corsola, and Ferrothorn with Nasty Plot. In return, Noivern can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dracovish, Choice Specs Dragapult and Arcanine that give Corviknight and Togekiss trouble.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Ground</h3> <p>Thanks to Thousand Arrows, Zygarde-10% is an extremely unique Pokemon that can break through typical checks to Ground-types such as Celesteela, Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Corviknight and remove their Ground immunity for the team. This allows it to completely excel against types such as Flying, Electric, and Fire and improve the matchup against Steel teams, as these types rely on Ground-immune Pokemon. Additionally, its good Speed tier allows it to outpace threats such as non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Tapu Lele, and it has good offensive utility in Extreme Speed. Unfortunately, Zygarde-10% is very frail, limiting its ability to stay in on attacks like Celesteela's Heavy Slam, Skarmory's Body Press, and Rotom-W's Hydro Pump without taking heavy damage before KOing them with Thousand Arrows. While Zygarde-10%'s Dragon / Ground typing is menacing for an offensive Pokemon, it struggles to break through generally bulky Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Slowbro due to its only average Attack stat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>Iron Tail is an option over Toxic to decimate Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu and Clefable attempting to switch in. However, this makes it more difficult for Zygarde-10% to weaken bulky walls, and Iron Tail's low accuracy makes it inconsistent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Mandibuzz, Slowbro, and Amoonguss are all able to tank Zygarde-10%'s attacks with ease and punish it with Foul Play, potentially burning it with Scald, or putting it to sleep with Spore, respectively. Slowbro and Amoonguss are also especially hard to wear down due to Regenerator. However, walls don't like taking a Toxic from Zygarde-10% if they aren't immune, as they are then constantly worn down during the match.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Weavile can OHKO Zygarde-10% with their Ice-type STAB moves, while Avalugg can switch into it almost freely but risks taking a Toxic from it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Zygarde-10% has trouble getting past bulky Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Tapu Bulu, since they can take its STAB moves with ease and force it out with their own STAB moves. Tapu Bulu must be wary of Iron Tail, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Powerful Attackers</strong>: Dragapult, Zeraora, and Choice Scarf attackers like Latias and Jirachi are all common revenge killers that can KO Zygarde-10%.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: While Extreme Speed is useful, it can only KO weakened threats. As such, Mamoswine's Ice Shard, Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed can all pressure Zygarde-10% into switching out or being KOed in order to switch to another teammate.</p>",

Outrage dents Pokemon like Pelipper, Appletun, Araquanid, and Celebi that are neutral or resistant to Thousand Arrows while providing valuable STAB coverage and helping greatly in the Dragon matchup. However, being locked into Outrage makes Zygarde-10% even more vulnerable to powerful attackers like Dragapult and bulky walls like Amoonguss, since it becomes unable to switch out for a few turns. Extreme Speed allows Zygarde-10% to revenge kill faster weakened threats such as Alolan Raichu and Barraskewda. It can use Toxic to lure in and cripple bulky Pokemon such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, Mandibuzz, and Galarian Corsola attempting to wall it in the long run. Maximum Speed investment allows it to outspeed Hydreigon, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Choice Specs Latios, while Choice Band is recommended to maximize its damage output and power. Zygarde-10% should be brought in through predicted switches or once a teammate has fainted, since it will likely take a lot of damage from powerful attacks such as Tapu Lele's Psychic, Nidoking's Earth Power, and Keldeo's Scald.</p> <p>Teammates such as Excadrill and Mamoswine appreciate Zygarde-10%'s ability to make their Ground-type moves more spammable by removing the Ground immunity from Flying-types such as Celesteela and Skarmory. In return, Excadrill can KO Fairy- and Ice-types such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Alolan Ninetales, and Galarian Darmanitan, especially under Hippowdon's sand. Excadrill can also remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to increase Zygarde-10%'s longevity and use Sand Rush to handle faster threats Zygarde-10% cannot take care of. Mamoswine is also useful for defeating problematic foes such as Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu, outspeeding and picking off faster foes like Dragapult with Ice Shard and removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Eviolite from prominent Pokemon such as Blissey, Mandibuzz, Porygon2, and Galarian Corsola with Knock Off. Hippowdon can deal chip damage on foes by setting Stealth Rock and sand, and it can preserve Zygarde-10%'s poor bulk by switching into most powerful attackers such as Dragonite, Terrakion, and Bisharp. Gastrodon and Seismitoad both provide a valuable Water immunity against Urshifu-R and Barraskewda. Nidoking is good for absorbing Toxic Spikes, setting its own, and using Flamethrower to KO Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu. The pair takes on Steel teams well because Nidoking has excellent coverage in Earth Power and Flamethrower, while Zygarde-10% can force switches with Thousand Arrows.</p>"

This allows Volcanion to freely utilize its STAB moves against Steel and Flying teams, alongside letting it Defog on entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon. However, Heavy-Duty Boots is preferred on Volcanion because Stealth Rock quickly whittles it down, leaving it unable to deal with Steel-type teams. Solar Beam can also be a niche pick for Volcanion to help get rid of foes such as Swampert and Gastrodon in sun.</p> <h4>Water</h4> <p>Volcanion can use a simpler EV spread such as 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD or 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe to be a bulkier or faster wallbreaker. With maximum Speed, Volcanion can outpace Adamant Mamoswine, Adamant Diggersby, and Modest Heatran. Earth Power is a viable option to hit Pokemon like Toxapex, Dragalge, and opposing Volcanion, but Sludge Bomb is usually more beneficial, as Tapu Fini and Mantine force it out otherwise. Toxic cripples common switch-ins such as Slowking, Gastrodon, and Mantine, although it's hard to fit. Dropping Defog forces a teammate like Tapu Fini, Mantine, or Rotom-W to use it instead.</p>",

Steam Eruption also threatens to burn foes as well, deterring physical attackers such as Dragonite and Urshifu-R from switching into it. Flamethrower alongside it leaves Volcanion difficult for most teams to switch into, allowing it to dismantle Steel, Fairy, and Flying teams by hitting Ferrothorn, Klefki, and Celesteela, respectively. Sludge Bomb lets Volcanion threaten Tapu Fini and revenge kill Azumarill after it has used Belly Drum. Earth Power deals with Fire- and Poison-types such as Heatran, Volcanion, and Toxapex, which Fire teams struggle against. 96 Speed EVs lets Volcanion outspeed Adamant Azumarill and revenge kill it with Sludge Bomb, while 168 EVs in HP allow Volcanion to survive an Earthquake from Choice Scarf Excadrill, as well as letting i to deal with threats such as Galarian Zapdos and specially defensive Landorus-T in a pinch.</p> <p>Cinderace serves as a great teammate, as it helps get through bulkier Pokemon that Volcanion can't always take on itself such as Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Tapu Fini. Heatran also assists Volcanion by providing substantial bulk, giving a way to trap Mantine and Toxapex, and setting Stealth Rock. Volcarona works well with Volcanion, as it can take on many Electric-type Pokemon once boosted with Quiver Dance such as Zeraora, and it shuts down Steel teams once Volcanion has removed Heatran. Victini helps by being an incredibly strong wallbreaker, helping Fire get past troublesome bulkier Pokemon, such as Landorus-T and Mantine, while also providing pivoting in U-turn. Alolan Marowak provides an Electric immunity with Lightning Rod, helping Volcanion by dealing with Tapu Koko. Finally, Moltres provides a Ground immunity, which lets it take Choice Scarf Excadrill's and Hippowdon's Earthquakes; Moltres also spreads Toxic to wear down bulky Water-types such as Mantine, Slowbro, and Slowking, and it provides pivoting in U-turn.</p>"

Flamethrower has near-perfect coverage with Steam Eruption, checking threats such as Ferrothorn, Zarude, and Amoonguss. Sludge Bomb targets troublesome Fairy-types such as Azumarill, Tapu Fini, and Clefable, which either resist or have recovery to shrug off Steam Eruption and Flamethower. Defog lets Volcanion be an offensive entry hazard remover, forcing out hazard setters such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. 176 Speed EVs allow Volcanion to outpace Choice Specs Aegislash, while the HP EVs let it combat Tapu Bulu and Zarude better.</p> <p>Volcanion provides excellent entry hazard removal for teammates that lack recovery or are prone to hazard-stacking teams, such as Urshifu-R, Toxapex, and Cloyster. Swampert is essential, as it switches into Electric-type attacks from Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Zapdos, provides utility in Stealth Rock and Roar, and brings Volcanion into Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu with Flip Turn. Slowking is a specially defensive wall that can switch into attacks from Nidoking and support Volcanion's wallbreaking with Future Sight and Teleport. Toxapex checks Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Dragapult with Poison Jab and Toxic, removes held items such as Eviolite from Porygon2 and Galarian Corsola with Knock Off to ease Volcanion's wallbreaking, and helps wear down Grass-types with the aforementioned Poison Jab and Toxic. Choice Scarf Urshifu-R breaks past threats such as Kyurem and is fast enough to eliminate threats that outpace Volcanion, such as Choice Scarf Krookodile and Terrakion. Rotom-W appreciates Volcanion's Defog freeing up a moveslot for Pain Split, and in return it can switch into troublesome Ground-type attacks from the likes of Sand Rush Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Landorus-T. Golisopod provides Spikes and removes threatening Grass-types like Zarude and Rillaboom with First Impression. Additionally, Golisopod supports Volcanion with its Ground resistance and deals with walls such as Slowbro and Galarian Slowking. Tapu Fini can make up for Volcanion's middling Speed with a Choice Scarf set, letting it remove threats like Hydreigon and Garchomp. Cloyster appreciates Volcanion's hazard removal preserving its Focus Sash, and in return it breaks past Dragon-types like Latias, Dragapult, and Kommo-o.

Toxic allows Incineroar to cripple walls such as Hippowdon and Mandibuzz, allowing its teammates to quickly wear them down. Taunt prevents entry hazards from slower setters such as Stealth Rock from Ferrothorn and Toxic Spikes from Pincurchin and stops walls such as Toxapex from recovering off damage and spreading status. Parting Shot allows Incineroar to safely pivot in a wallbreaker such as Choice Band Arcanine or Choice Scarf Charizard for the team. Alternatively, U-turn still allows Incineroar to act as a slow pivot and cannot be blocked by Taunt. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Incineroar to pivot in even when hazards are up, allowing it to tank more attacks such as Dragapult's Draco Meteor. Intimidate further allows Incineroar to act as a pivot by enabling it to switch into physical attackers such as Tyranitar, Corviknight, and Mimikyu.

Torkoal's sun can allow Incineroar to more readily switch into Water attacks such as Toxapex's Scald and Gyarados's Waterfall. Incineroar again can take on special attackers for Torkoal such as Choice Specs Aegislash, Indeedee, and Hatterene, which all threaten easily Torkoal due to its pitiful Special Defense. Charizard provides a Ground immunity for Incineroar, while Incineroar can proactively cripple walls with Toxic and Taunt, such as Toxapex and Galarian Corsola, which can otherwise wall Charizard. Incineroar can also switch into Choice Scarf Dragapult for Charizard, which is the only faster Pokemon than Charizard in the Dragon matchup. Cinderace and Rotom-H also form a pivoting core with Incineroar, as each of them can generate momentum with their pivoting moves. Additionally, Rotom-H can take on Water-type Pokemon such as Gyarados for Incineroar with Thunderbolt. Cinderace can also take on Dark-type Pokemon for Incineroar with High Jump Kick, such as Hydreigon and Tyranitar. Arcanine additionally can revenge kill Pokemon that get out of hand for Incineroar, such as Cloyster, thanks to Choice Band-boosted Extreme Speed.</p>"

Swampert and Gastrodon are two Pokemon that can switch into Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Thundurus-T, while Toxapex can switch into Grass-type Pokemon such as Zarude and Tapu Bulu in return. Slowking is another great Pokemon that pairs well with Toxapex thanks to its resistance to Psychic and even better special bulk, which allow it to come in on attacks such as Tapu Lele's Psychic and Substitute Kyurem's Freeze-Dry.

Thanks to Water Bubble, it checks threats such as Volcarona and Heatran, which greatly trouble Bug teams. Liquidation deals with Calm Mind and Quiver Dance users such as Spectrier and Volcarona, and it generally threatens Fire-types. Mirror Coat takes advantage of Araquanid's excellent Special Defense, allowing it to retaliate against threats that don't mind Liquidation such as Thundurus-T and Volcanion. Toxic debilitates switch-ins such as Slowbro, Mantine, and Gastrodon. Magic Coat can be used over Toxic, as it bounces back Taunt, Leech Seed, and Stealth Rock from Cobalion, Celesteela, and Garchomp, allowing Araquanid to set Sticky Web uncontested and maximize its longevity. 156 Speed EVs let Araquanid outspeed and beat non-Air Slash Celesteela one-on-one, while maximum HP EVs allow it to survive attacks such as Choice Specs Tapu Koko's Volt Switch, Hurricane from Tornadus-T, and non-Choice Band Victini's Bolt Strike.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Scizor, Volcarona, and Heracross make great teammates for Araquanid, as these all benefit from Sticky Web and a Fire resistance. Swords Dance Scizor deals with Ice- and Rock-type threats such as Kyurem and Tyranitar, can clean types such as Dragon and Fairy, and uses Sticky Web to outspeed Heatran. Volcarona greatly appreciates Araquanid dealing with Heatran and Victini, as this allows it to sweep types such as Steel and Psychic late-game. Guts Heracross deals with walls such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Galarian Corsola, and Sticky Web allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, removing threats such as Dragapult, Choice Band Victini, and Choice Scarf Heatran. Araquanid setting Sticky Web frees a moveslot for Galvantula, allowing it to run Agility. Thanks to Sticky Web, Galvantula even outspeeds Swift Swim Barraskewda at +2, making it a potent late-game wincon against Water and Flying teams. Galvantula also appreciates Araquanid's ability to heavily damage Thundurus-T and pressure Ground-types like Landorus-T. Choice Scarf Buzzwole deals with threats such as Cinderace and Excadrill, and Sticky Web lets it clean frailer types such as Electric, Dragon, Dark, and Fire, which have limited defensive counterplay against it.</p>"

Its ability Water Bubble not only boosts its Water-type moves, making Liquidation hit much harder, but it also makes it immune to burns from Scald and Will-O-Wisp, making it harder for defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Sableye to deal with it. With Liquidation, Araquanid is also able to deal with Magic Bounce users like Hatterene, which can block Sticky Web. Leech Life lets Araquanid threaten Dark- and Psychic-type Pokemon like Hydreigon and Indeedee while also healing itself. Magic Coat allows it to bounce back status moves like Taunt against common lead Pokemon such as Froslass and Kommo-o. It is also useful against Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Mirror Coat allows Araquanid to beat threats to Water-type teams, like Duraludon, Heliolisk, Noivern, Hatterene, and Choice Specs Dragapult. Maximum Attack investment optimizes its overall damage output.

Before sending in Salazzle, you should try to get rid of any hazards, as it gets chipped especially heavily by Stealth Rock. It's best to avoid strong attacks because Salazzle doesn't have amazing bulk, even with maximized HP.

Salazzle can also it to outspeed fast threats such as Keldeo and Hydreigon in order to beat them with Substitute + Protect after they have been badly poisoned by Toxic. Protect + Substitute enables Salazzle to wear down Pokemon once they have been crippled by Toxic. Protect is also used to scout against common Choice item users like Excadrill and Galarian Darmanitan, as well as to gain more passive recovery using Black Sludge. Sludge Wave lets Salazzle take on Fairy-types like Hatterene and Rest Grimmsnarl that do not mind Toxic. Salazzle should try to come in once entry hazards are gone to avoid getting worn down by Spikes and severely chipped by Stealth Rock. It should not try to switch into strong attacks because of its poor bulk and should instead be brought in through U-turn and Volt Switch. Salazzle should try to use Substitute on a predicted switch in order to get more opportunities to spread status. Having 252 HP EVs maximizes Salazzle's poor bulk in order to spread status comfortably, while having 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature makes Salazzle able to outpace fast Pokemon such as Keldeo, Terrakion, Gengar, and Alolan Ninetales.</p> <p>Salazzle appreciates Torkoal and Ninetales because of their ability to set sun with Drought and therefore weaken Water-type attacks like Toxapex's Scald for Salazzle. The former can use Yawn to make it easier for Salazzle to come in, Rapid Spin to get rid of hazards, and Stealth Rock to help damage foes to make it easier for Salazzle to stall them out, while the latter can use Hypnosis to help Salazzle come in and can use Solar Beam to take care of Ground- and Water-types such as Seismitoad and Mamoswine. Cinderace, Arcanine, and Darmanitan are all fast physical attackers that appreciate Salazzle badly poisoning walls such as Galarian Corsola, Toxapex, and Mandibuzz that give them trouble, and they can all beat Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Snorlax for Salazzle in return. Cinderace is able to use Sucker Punch to help wear down fast Pokemon like Dragapult, use U-turn to bring in Salazzle safely, and use Court Change to move hazards to the other side of the field for Salazzle. Choice Scarf Darmanitan can outspeed and beat faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Zeraora, and Choice Scarf Excadrill, and it can also bring in Salazzle safely with its fast U-turn. Choice Scarf Charizard can be used to help in the Dragon-type matchup, as it can take care of most Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Dracovish once sun and Stealth Rock are up with Dragon Pulse. Choice Band Arcanine can be used, as it can use Extreme Speed to take care of weakened Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Keldeo, and Alolan Raichu for the team mid- to late-game.

Darkest Lariat hits Psychic- and Ghost-types that attempt to switch in on Drain Punch, such as Mew and Aegislash, while ignoring defensive stat boosts, meaning that Bewear can face off against non-Taunt Corviknight. Bulk Up lets Bewear greatly threaten Steel-types, while Substitute allows it to set up without fearing moves such as Toxic from Aegislash and Leech Seed from Ferrothorn. Toxic can be run over Darkest Lariat to pressure walls that don't mind Bewear's boosted attacks, such as Slowbro and Hippowdon, while Roar lets it force out these walls alongside Amoonguss and Celesteela, which are immune to Toxic. Pain Split is an option to provide Bewear more instant recovery. Leftovers is standard, but Rocky Helmet can be run to punish contact moves such as Weavile's Triple Axel or Melmetal's Double Iron Bash. 60 Speed EVs let Bewear outspeed Corviknight, while the rest of the EVs go into making it as bulky as possible.

In return, Bewear can break through Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Assault Vest Melmetal, which shrug off Heliolisk's attacks. Chansey, Porygon2, and Braviary can all safely pivot Bewear into a foe it can set up against such as Ferrothorn. Chansey can soak up status that would limit Bewear, take on special attackers such as Tapu Lele, Choice Specs Jirachi, and Hydreigon, and set Stealth Rock. In return, Bewear can defeat Pokemon that Chansey draws in, such as Terrakion and Melmetal. Porygon2 can spread paralysis through Discharge, while checking Flying- and Dragon-types such as Landorus-T and Dragonite with Ice Beam. Braviary removes entry hazards, helping Bewear switch in repeatedly and have better longevity. Diggersby and Obstagoon are threats that help Bewear break through Steel teams while also dealing with physically defensive walls such as Toxapex and Slowbro. Snorlax is a good soft check to Fire- and Ice-types that give Bewear trouble such as Blacephalon, Victini, and Kyurem. It can also set up on Fairy-types that force Bewear out. In return, Bewear can pressure Steel-types that can stop Snorlax's sweep such as Ferrothorn. Finally, Ditto can copy and punish setup sweepers with Imposter, such as Bulk Up Zeraora, Galarian Moltres, and Swords Dance Garchomp.</p>"

Leech Life makes up for Golisopod's lack of recovery and also helps defeat the aforementioned Grass-type sweepers, alongside Psychic-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Celebi. 172 Speed EVs allow Golisopod to outspeed Celesteela, so it can remove its Leftovers with Knock Off before potentially being forced out by Emergency Exit.</p> <p>Swampert is an excellent teammate on any Water team thanks to its ability to switch into Electric-type attacks from Zapdos and Regieleki.

Volcanion can also be used to deal with Grass- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Aegislash, which are troublesome defensive Pokemon for Water teams to handle. Due to Golisopod's Spikes being rendered completely useless against Flying teams, Cloyster and Rotom-W make for excellent teammates, as they can easily dismantle Flying teams with Shell Smash and Nasty Plot, respectively. Slowking can switch into Psychic-type attacks from Tapu Lele, Ground-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp, and also Kyurem's Freeze-Dry.

Offensively, Mimikyu improves the matchup against offensive types like Electric, Psychic, and Ghost; however, it struggles with common defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Hippowdon, and thus it functions best as a late-game cleaner once its teammates have broken down the opposing defensive core. Mimikyu is also very susceptible to passive damage from entry hazards, status, and Life Orb recoil, and it heavily relies on Disguise being unbroken to pose an offensive threat.</p> <h3>Ghost</h3> <p>Mimikyu is a great late-game cleaner and sweeper with its access to priority and STAB Play Rough, allowing it to check Dark-types like Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon. Disguise lets Mimikyu get a free Swords Dance, allowing it to get past defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Heatran and revenge kill faster Pokemon like Dragapult and Victini more easily. Its speed tier lets Mimikyu outspeed Pokemon like Kyurem and Galarian Moltres but leaves it vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Galarian Zapdos, and Zarude that it cannot KO with Shadow Sneak. Its low Attack means Mimikyu has an overreliance on a boost to deal damage. Even with a Swords Dance boost, Mimikyu is unable to 2HKO and break through defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Celesteela. Disguise also does not prevent Mimikyu from getting statused by Pokemon like Klefki and Gastrodon, and when combined with the chip from Life Orb and Disguise breaking, Mimikyu gets worn down a lot throughout the match.</p>",

Breaking its Disguise makes it lose some of its health too, and every time Mimikyu attacks, Life Orb recoil chips away at its HP. All these bits of chip stack up over the course of a battle and heavily limit its future chances to make progress.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Being paralyzed leaves Mimkyu slower for many more Pokemon to revenge kill it, such as Mamoswine and Tapu Lele.

It also takes advantage of forced switches against types such as Steel, Ground, and Normal, allowing Kommo-o to whittle down its checks such as Choice Specs Jirachi and Nidoking. Bulletproof blocks Shadow Ball from Aegislash, and Leftovers allows Kommo-o to remain healthy throughout the match. 200 Speed EVs with a positive nature let Kommo-o outspeed Modest Galarian Moltres, while 52 Special Defense EVs let its Substitute withstand specially defensive Heatran's Earth Power.</p> <p>Kommo-o is setup fodder for Fairy-types such as Clefable, Calm Mind Tapu Fini, and Hatterene, so Dragalge, which checks these threats, is an excellent teammate for it. Dragalge also sets Toxic Spikes, which wears down checks such as Sableye and Porygon2, and can pivot Kommo-o in safely against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, which try to take advantage of Dragalge. Nasty Plot Hydreigon provides a Psychic immunity, is an excellent wallbreaker that deals with walls such as Toxapex and Bulk Up Corviknight that Kommo-o struggles against, and works well with it to break down Ground- and Steel-type teams. Choice Scarf Dragapult deals with faster threats such as Swift Swim Kingdra, Latias, and Garchomp, which break through Kommo-o, and pivots it in against walls such as Ferrothorn, Porygon2, and Celesteela. SubRoost Kyurem heavily pressures types such as Flying, Ground, and Water, and it deals with Kommo-o's checks in Nidoking, Toxapex, and Sableye. In return, Kommo-o removes specially defensive walls such as Tyranitar, Cradily, and Ferrothorn; this synergy allows it or Kyurem to clean types such as Dark and Grass late-game. Garchomp sets Stealth Rock, pressures types such as Steel alongside Kommo-o, and can put walls such as Sableye on a timer with Toxic. Latias provides Healing Wish, which gives Kommo-o a second chance to set up if it has been greatly worn down or statused, making Kommo-o much harder to deal with.</p>"

  "Tapu Koko": {
    "overview": "<h3>Electric</h3> <p>Tapu Koko is Electric's most essential Pokemon due to its ability Electric Surge, providing all teammates with a boost to their Electric-type STAB attacks. Its part Fairy typing along with Dazzling Gleam is also incredibly useful to deal with Dragon- and Dark-types such as Latias, Latios, Hydreigon, and Urshifu-S, which would otherwise be difficult to beat for Electric teams. A stellar Speed tier also allows Tapu Koko to outspeed the likes of Cinderace, Tapu Lele, Choice Band Victini, and Urshifu-S, helping it set Electric Terrain and wallbreak easier. Another benefit from Electric Terrain is that grounded Pokemon cannot fall asleep; this prevents foes like Amoonguss from putting Tapu Koko and its teammates to sleep with Spore. However, Tapu Koko can be outsped by many Choice Scarf users such as Weavile, Blacephalon, and Excadrill and other faster Pokemon like Dragapult, Barraskewda, and Kingdra under rain. This forces it to take massive damage from them or switch out. Its mediocre bulk also leaves it vulnerable to priority moves and unable to consistently switch into powerful attacks, making it easily pressured during a match.</p> <h3>Fairy</h3> <p>Good coverage in Thunderbolt + Grass Knot + Dazzling Gleam allows Tapu Koko to serve as a good answer to Flying and Water teams while putting work in other matchups such as Dark, Ground, and Psychic. Electric Surge-boosted Thunderbolt is particularly useful for taking down a huge threat to Fairy teams in Celesteela, which would be problematic to deal with otherwise. A high Speed stat ensures Tapu Koko outspeeds a majority of the unboosted metagame, which means it's only revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Dracovish, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T or a handful of naturally faster Pokemon like Barraskewda and Dragapult. However, Tapu Koko's terrible bulk makes it unable to switch into Pokemon like Celesteela and prone to getting revenge killed by priority attacks like Urshifu-R's Aqua Jet and Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Tapu Koko faces a lot of overlap on Fairy teams, as they can typically deal with Flying and Water teams, so Tapu Koko can be rather hard to justify over Pokemon like Togekiss or Alolan Ninetales. Tapu Koko is also stopped by many Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Tapu Bulu, and Excadrill, which makes it hard for it to make progress in certain matchups.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Electric</h4> <p>A utility set with Taunt and U-turn can be used to prevent defensive Pokemon like Blissey, Clefable, Galarian Corsola, and Celebi from recovering or using other status moves. However, Tapu Koko loses out on being a great wallbreaker with Choice Specs, which can make it more reliant on its teammates to wear down foes. Expert Belt can be utilized to let Tapu Koko excel against types like Water and Dark without being locked into a specific move. It will lose out on extra damage output with Choice Specs, however, especially against foes that aren't weak to any of Tapu Koko's moves. Calm Mind is also an option over a move like Volt Switch to turn Tapu Koko into a decent setup sweeper, but its poor bulk can make it difficult for Tapu Koko to set up at times.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>A Choice Specs set can be used in order to punish types like Fairy, Psychic, Ghost, and Fire, which don't typically carry an Electric immunity, with Volt Switch. However, being Choice-locked means Tapu Koko will have more trouble playing around the Water and Flying matchups where it cannot switch between coverage options and is rendered useless against Baneful Bunker Toxapex and Protect Celesteela. Expert Belt can be used over Life Orb in order to avoid recoil; however, without Life Orb, Tapu Koko fails to 2HKO Pokemon like Zapdos, Landorus-T, and Thundurus-T and lets them switch in more easily. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to avoid Toxic Spikes in the Water matchup. However, Toxic Spikes Toxapex is rather uncommon and forgoing Life Orb means forgoing certain 2HKOs. A Calm Mind + Roost set can be used to target types like Psychic, Electric, and Ghost under dual screens. However, this means dropping a coverage move, which hinders Tapu Koko in the Flying and Water matchups. Taunt can be used to stop entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn, setup sweepers like Volcarona, defensive Pokemon like Zapdos and Blissey from recovering, and Toxic Aegislash from spreading status at the cost of giving up a coverage move or Roost. U-turn can be used to pivot against Electric immunities at the cost of dropping a coverage move or Roost, and it should not be used with Life Orb.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Electric</h4> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Fast revenge killers such as Dragapult, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Kingdra under rain are able to outspeed and dent Tapu Koko due to its mediocre bulk.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Tapu Koko struggles to take priority moves such as Aqua Jet, Extreme Speed, and Shadow Sneak from foes such as Urshifu-R, Dragonite, Zygarde-10%, and Mimikyu, as they can take advantage of Tapu Koko's mediocre bulk, especially if it's weakened.</p> <p><strong>Electric Immunities</strong>: Pokemon that are immune to Electric-type moves such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp are able to prevent Electric moves from being spammed, making Tapu Koko reliant on itself or its teammates to beat them or wear them down before breaking through the opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Dragalge, and Galarian Slowking are able to consistently take hits from Tapu Koko and retaliate by wearing it down. Dragalge is also able to set up Toxic Spikes in front of Tapu Koko, while Galarian Slowking can recover any damage inflicted by Tapu Koko due to Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, Celebi, Cradily, and Tapu Bulu resist Tapu Koko's Electric STAB moves and can take multiple hits from it due to their good bulk while being able to threaten it back with their STAB moves. Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu in particular are able to disrupt Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain due to Grassy Surge, while Rillaboom is able to outspeed Tapu Koko under Grassy Terrain with Grassy Glide. Ferrothorn also gets opportunities to set up entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes in front of Tapu Koko.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p><strong>Ground- and Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: Ground- and Grass-type Pokemon like Excadrill, Landorus-T, Tapu Bulu, and Ferrothorn are good answers to Tapu Koko due to their ability to come in on its attacks and either wall or revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Getting badly poisoned by Pokemon like Toxapex and Celesteela means Tapu Koko has as a harder time switching between coverage options in the Water and Flying matchups it capitalizes on.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Blissey and Galarian Slowking wall Tapu Koko due to their high special bulk and beat it with Toxic and Sludge Bomb, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority Users</strong>: Revenge killers like Barraskewda under rain, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, as well as priority users like Urshifu-R, Dragonite, and Crawdaunt, can easily pick off Tapu Koko due to its lackluster bulk.</p>",

      "Choice Specs (Electric)": {
        "description": "<p>The combination of Tapu Koko's Electric Surge, decent coverage, and good Speed tier make it an effective wallbreaker with Choice Specs. Volt Switch allows it to pivot out of checks such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar, rack chip damage on foes, and bring in a teammate to deal with these checks. Dazzling Gleam breaks through Dragon- and Dark-types such as Latias, Latios, Hydreigon, Zarude, and Urshifu-S. Grass Knot provides excellent coverage against Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Gastrodon, Swampert, and Seismitoad, which would be able to consistently switch into Tapu Koko and block its Volt Switch. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Tapu Koko to outspeed Cinderace, Alakazam, and non-Choice Scarf Weavile while Speed tying with Spectrier. Tapu Koko should usually be led with early-game to set up Electric Terrain so it can make Electric-type moves more spammable against the opposing team. It should also wallbreak mid- or late-game once its offensive teammates have weakened the opposing team.</p> <p>Alolan Raichu heavily benefits from Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain due to its ability Surge Surfer, allowing it to outspeed almost the entire metagame, including Choice Scarf Excadrill, Swift Swim Kingdra, and Choice Scarf Blacephalon. Its Psychic typing can also be helpful against Poison-types like Amoonguss, Dragalge, and Nidoking. Zeraora is an excellent physical wallbreaker that can help against specially defensive foes like Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Tyranitar, forming a good offensive core with Tapu Koko to take on types like Dark, Psychic, Dragon, and Ghost together. Rotom-W and Zapdos both provide useful Ground immunities for Tapu Koko; Rotom-W is able to defeat or force out Mamoswine and Sand Rush Excadrill while resisting Fire-type attacks from Choice Scarf Victini and Blacephalon, which Tapu Koko particularly struggles against. Zapdos can deal with Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, Tapu Bulu, and Zarude with Heat Wave and its useful typing while getting rid of problematic entry hazards such as Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, and Toxic Spikes. Air Balloon Magnezone can trap troublesome Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Excadrill with Magnet Pull. Regieleki also heavily benefits from Tapu Koko's Electric Terrain, as its boosted Rising Voltage 2HKOes even foes that resist it like Ferrothorn, Zarude, and Kyurem while OHKOing Dragapult when aided by Choice Specs. Its absurdly high Speed stat also allows Regieleki to outspeed even popular Choice Scarf users like Nihilego, Blacephalon, and Galarian Darmanitan.</p>"

      "3 Attacks + Roost (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>Thunderbolt hits Flying- and Water-type Pokemon like Celesteela, Corviknight, Mantine, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini. It is also the best option to hit neutral targets like Spectrier and Zapdos due to it being boosted by Electric Surge. Grass Knot hits Ground-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and Mamoswine. The combination of Thunderbolt + Grass Knot breaks Water teams entirely by hitting the vast majority of Pokemon for super effective damage. Dazzling Gleam ensures Thundurus-T and Landorus-T cannot switch in for free against Fairy in fear of getting 2HKOed. It also hits Dragon-type Pokemon like Garchomp, Latios, and Kyurem, which Thunderbolt and Grass Knot can't beat. Roost increases Tapu Koko's longevity and mitigates Life Orb recoil, letting it heal throughout the match and come in on weaker attacks like Toxapex's Scald and defensive Zapdos's Discharge. A Timid nature allows Tapu Koko to outspeed Pokemon such as Alakazam and Weavile while Speed tying with Spectrier. Life Orb ensures that Tapu Koko OHKOes Celesteela with Thunderbolt and 2HKOes Landorus-T and Thundurus-T with Dazzling Gleam and prevents it from being Choice locked.</p> <p>Tapu Bulu supports Tapu Koko defensively by switching into Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Krookodile. In return, Tapu Koko can beat Pokemon like Celesteela and Tornadus-T, which would otherwise check Tapu Bulu. They both synergize offensively to reliably take on Water and Flying teams. The combination of Stealth Rock and Knock Off makes Clefable an amazing teammate by further helping Tapu Koko in the Flying matchup. Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Zapdos and Mantine means Tapu Koko can put in work by forcing switches while punishing the same Defoggers with Thunderbolt. Klefki patches up Tapu Koko's poor bulk with its ability to set dual screens. It can also set Spikes to punish types like Ground and Water alongside Tapu Koko forcing switches. Azumarill's ability to revenge kill a faster and dangerous threat in Excadrill and beat Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Slowking after a Belly Drum boost is appreciated by Tapu Koko. Choice Specs Tapu Lele supports Tapu Koko by breaking Pokemon like Blissey and Amoonguss, which wall Tapu Koko, with Psyshock. Grimmsnarl can help against Psychic and Ghost teams alongside Tapu Koko, providing synergy against the matchups. Try to not let Tapu Koko get badly poisoned by Pokemon such as Toxapex and Celesteela, as that will hinder its ability to stay in for long durations of time when it needs to swap between moves. Be wary of Choice Scarf Rotom-W's Trick, as giving Tapu Koko a Choice Scarf means it cannot switch moves against Water anymore.</p>"

  "Tapu Lele": {
    "overview": "<h3>Psychic</h3> <p>Tapu Lele is one of Psychic's most essential Pokemon due to its ability Psychic Surge, sky-high Special Attack, and excellent STAB combination that targets troublesome Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Mandibuzz, Dragonite, and Latios. Psychic Terrain boosts the power of Psychic-type STAB moves, especially teammates' Expanding Force, while invalidating priority moves like Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Aqua Jet from users such as Bisharp, Aegislash, Mimikyu, and Azumarill. This greatly benefits Tapu Lele's faster teammates and lets it beat Azumarill. Tapu Lele has a few great coverage options to deal with its typical checks, such as Thunderbolt for Celesteela and Corviknight, Focus Blast for Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Tyranitar, and Shadow Ball for Ghost-types like Aegislash. However, even with Psychic Terrain's protection, Tapu Lele's average Speed tier leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by numerous naturally faster Pokemon such as Zeraora, Volcarona, Gengar, and Nihilego that it would desire to outspeed. Tapu Lele's poor physical bulk also makes it difficult for it to consistently switch into attacks and set up Psychic Terrain for its teammates.</p> <h3>Fairy</h3> <p>Tapu Lele serves as a unique wallbreaker for Fairy teams thanks to its ability Psychic Surge, which strengthens its Psychic-type moves while also blocking priority moves from foes like Scizor, Weavile, and Dragonite. Moreover, Tapu Lele's STAB combination is very good against many matchups, and, with the help of wallbreaker teammates like Azumarill and Tapu Bulu, it can easily clean late-game. Coverage options such as Focus Blast and Thunderbolt can help Tapu Lele against Pokemon that it cannot beat normally, such as Heatran, Celesteela, and Mantine. However, its Speed tier is middling; even with a Choice Scarf, Tapu Lele is slower than other common Choice Scarf users such as Gengar, Blacephalon, and Weavile. This Speed, combined with its bad defenses, means Tapu Lele cannot reliably switch into threats and is oftentimes limited to revenge killing or accepting heavy hits. This also leaves Tapu Lele weak to the aforementioned Choice Scarf users. Lastly, Psychic Terrain also blocks teammate priority moves, such as Azumarill's Aqua Jet and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p>Psyshock is an option over Psychic to deal significant damage to Blissey attempting to switch in. Choice Scarf allows Tapu Lele to outspeed foes such as Tapu Koko, Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Gengar that would otherwise outspeed it; however, Tapu Lele loses a significant amount of damage output without Choice Specs, and other teammates like Latias already carry Choice Scarf.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p>Choice Specs can be used over Choice Scarf for immediate power in exchange for Speed. Shadow Ball can be used over Thunderbolt to hit Aegislash and Jirachi super effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Psychic</h4> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Tapu Lele is prone to being revenge killed and KOed by faster Pokemon such as Zarude, Hydreigon, Gengar, Nihilego, and Volcarona. However, they cannot switch into either of Tapu Lele's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Tapu Lele relies on having the right coverage move to defeat Steel-types, so it can easily be defeated by Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal if it's not running Focus Blast, Aegislash if it's not running Shadow Ball, and Celesteela if it's not running Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Offensive Ghost-types such as Mimikyu, Dragapult, Gengar, Spectrier, and Blacephalon can all effectively revenge kill Tapu Lele with their STAB moves. Aegislash is also able to check any variant of Tapu Lele without Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Tapu Lele has some difficulty breaking through specially defensive walls such as Blissey, Celesteela, Heatran, and Aegislash, since it will need the right coverage move in order to beat them. However, if these walls do switch into a super effective move, then they will take lots of damage.</p> <h4>Fairy</h4> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon</strong>: Despite Tapu Lele running Focus Blast to get past Steel-types, the attack itself is unreliable due to low accuracy and PP, and Steel-types such as Aegislash and Jirachi don't mind it much. Moreover, Steel-types that often run Protect, such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn, can scout for Tapu Lele's chosen move and pivot accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killing</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Keldeo, Dragapult, and Urshifu-R can outspeed Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and threaten it. Other faster threats include Excadrill in sand, Barraskewda in rain, and Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, Aegislash, and Jirachi can easily take hits from Tapu Lele and stall it out with status effects such as poison.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon</strong>: Tapu Lele is threatened by Dark-types since it risks locking itself into Psychic. Pokemon such as Weavile, Bisharp, Drapion, and Tyranitar can all take advantage of Tapu Lele, but they have to be cautious of Moonblast and Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Tapu Lele is reliant on its Choice Scarf to cover up its mediocre Speed tier; therefore, it must avoid paralysis spreaders such as Zapdos and Tyranitar. However, the aforementioned Pokemon need to be careful with Tapu Lele, as they take considerable damage from it.</p>",

Focus Blast deals significant damage to Steel- and Dark-types such as Ferrothorn, Melmetal, Heatran, and Tyranitar, which are otherwise solid checks to Tapu Lele. Thunderbolt can break through bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Slowking, Slowbro, and Celesteela, letting this set wreck Water and Flying teams with the combination of Psychic and Thunderbolt. Shadow Ball can be used over Thunderbolt to help against Ghost-types like Aegislash as well as foes like Jirachi, attempting to switch in on Tapu Lele's other attacks. It also greatly helps in the Psychic mirror matchup. Avoid consistently switching into attacks so Tapu Lele can be kept healthy to wallbreak. If Psychic Terrain or a Fairy-type STAB move is mandatory for a battle, then Tapu Lele should always be kept alive. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Tapu Lele to outspeed Nidoking and Duraludon, while Choice Specs makes it a fearsome wallbreaker.</p> <p>All teammates appreciate Tapu Lele's wallbreaking capabilities and benefit from its Psychic Terrain. Victini is an excellent partner for Tapu Lele, as it can break through specially defensive foes such as Blissey as well as Steel-types like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn with V-create, while Tapu Lele has Focus Blast to deal with Heatran. Slowbro is a great physical wall that resists Fire-type attacks such as Cinderace's Pyro Ball and Victini's V-create for Tapu Lele while guaranteeing it safe entry with Teleport. Slowbro can also carry Thunder Wave, slowing down foes like Volcarona and Hydreigon for Tapu Lele. Jirachi provides Stealth Rock support, slows down foes like Nihilego and Hydreigon with Thunder Wave, has the combination of Serene Grace and Iron Head to slowly wear down foes, and brings Tapu Lele in safely with U-turn. Additionally, a Choice Scarf set lets Jirachi outspeed threats like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and non-Choice Scarf Dragapult, which are huge threats to Tapu Lele. Celebi is an alternative Stealth Rock setter over Jirachi thanks to its part-Grass typing, allowing it to force out Water- and Ground-types like Swampert, Seismitoad, Hippowdon, and Excadrill, the latter being a big threat for Psychic teams. Additionally, it can absorb status aliments with Natural Cure, provide U-turn and Healing Wish support, and use Recover for great longevity. Latias is able to remove problematic entry hazards such as Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, and Stealth Rock for Tapu Lele with Defog while providing a natural immunity to Ground-type attacks like Sand Rush Excadrill's Earthquake, Nidoking's Earth Power, and Garchomp's Earthquake. It can also provide Healing Wish support. Alakazam is a dedicated revenge killer that can KO an abundance of threats such as Choice Scarf Weavile, Barraskewda, Scolipede, and Drapion with its high Speed tier, Counter, Focus Sash, and Magic Guard, which prevents any form of residual damage, making it more effective in this role.</p>"

Moonblast allows Tapu Lele to take on Dragon-types such as Kyurem, Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Latios. Focus Blast deals damage to Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Bisharp, as well as Tyranitar. Thunderbolt hits Mantine and Celesteela.

Klefki is another excellent supporting partner thanks to its plethora of excellent utility moves; Spikes contributes majorly to weakening the opposing team, Thunder Wave cripples faster Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion, Keldeo, and Urshifu-R, and dual screens support makes it even more difficult for opposing threats to handle Tapu Lele, especially late-game. Clefable is a decent support option because it can provide Stealth Rock to weaken the opposing team. Clefable can also use Knock Off to rid bulky Pokemon such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn of their passive recovery, meaning these Pokemon get worn out after multiple switches, and threaten them with Flamethrower. Mimikyu is an excellent revenge killer and one-time blanket check to most Pokemon thanks to its ability Disguise, and it is helpful against Psychic teams, which benefit from Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain. Tapu Koko can take on Flying-types such as Celesteela and Mantine for Tapu Lele and pivot it in with Volt Switch. Togekiss can help against Steel-types such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn with Flamethrower. Togekiss also provides Heal Bell support against status conditions such as paralysis and Toxic poison and can use Defog. Galarian Weezing is excellent against opposing Fairy-type teams, and it provides Toxic Spikes for Tapu Lele to break through bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2 even better.</p>"

Zen Headbutt may be used over High Horsepower, as it allows Tapu Bulu to threaten Galarian Weezing and Amoonguss. Similarly, Stone Edge allows it to heavily damage Flying-types such as Zapdos, but losing High Horsepower leaves Tapu Bulu unable to OHKO Aegislash and Toxapex at +2. Substitute may be used to take advantage of forced switches and evade status, but the reduced coverage is detrimental to its ability to break down Steel and Poison teams.</p> <h4>Grass</h4> <p>High Horsepower can be used over Zen Headbutt to help defeat Galarian Slowking and Aegislash while getting higher damage off immediately on Heatran; however, Grass teams value the ability to defeat Galarian Weezing more. Stone Edge can be used over, again, Zen Headbutt to hit bulky Flying-type Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Mantine.

Calm Mind Clefable is a bulky special setup sweeper that works well with Tapu Bulu, as both wear down defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, Heatran, and Toxapex, allowing one of them to eventually overwhelm teams such as Steel and Water teams. Azumarill deals with Fire-types such as Victini and Blacephalon, and it can use a Belly Drum set to break down types such as Poison and Steel late-game. Calm Mind Tapu Fini is a bulky special setup sweeper that loves Tapu Bulu's ability to wear down Ferrothorn, Dragalge, and Celesteela, and in return it deals with Heatran, Hydreigon, and Dragonite. Tapu Koko checks fast threats such as Galarian Moltres and Weavile, can pivot Tapu Bulu in against bulky defensive Pokemon that it can threaten such as Swampert, Galarian Slowking, and Ferrothorn, and deals with Flying-types such as Celesteela and Crobat. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele deals with faster Poison- and Dragon-types such as Nidoking and Kyurem, and it appreciates Tapu Bulu dealing with defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela, Tyranitar, and Slowking, as this allows Tapu Lele to clean types like Flying, Dark, and Water late-game. Hatterene is a bulky Calm Mind sweeper that provides entry hazard control in the form of Magic Bounce, which stops Toxapex's Toxic Spikes from wearing down Tapu Bulu, allowing it to pressure teams such as Water and Poison teams more consistently. Hatterene also appreciates Tapu Bulu's ability to remove Pokemon that wall it such as Magnezone and specially defensive Tyranitar, allowing it to sweep types such as Electric and Dark late-game.</p>"

Horn Leech allows Tapu Bulu to remain healthy while also taking on Pokemon such as Clefable and Porygon2. Close Combat defeats threatening Steel-type Pokemon after a Swords Dance boost, such as Ferrothorn and specially defensive Heatran, and also heavily pressures Celesteela. Zen Headbutt allows Tapu Bulu to take on Poison-type foes after a Swords Dance boost such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Galarian Weezing, allowing it to muscle past Poison teams, which its teammates appreciate. Life Orb gives Tapu Bulu a boost to damage without much drawback, as the recovery from Horn Leech in tandem with Grassy Terrain allows it to ignore the recoil. Grassy Terrain also boosts Horn Leech, and it gives recovery and boosts Grass-type moves for the rest of the team. Maximum Speed EVs outspeed offensive Celesteela, Volcanion, and Adamant Bisharp, which can all be troublesome for Grass teams.</p> <p>Rillaboom provides Grassy Terrain alongside Tapu Bulu for the rest of its team, and it can remove Leftovers from bulky Pokemon that take a +2 hit from Tapu Bulu, such as Celesteela and Corviknight, with Knock Off. Also, its Grassy Glide threatens offensive Pokemon such as Galarian Darmanitan and Nidoking, which can help Tapu Bulu break through teams without being forced out. Choice Scarf Zarude provides valuable revenge killing for Grass teams and defeats Psychic-type Pokemon that threaten Tapu Bulu, such as Victini and Tapu Lele, while pivoting on bulky Pokemon it lures in such as Ferrothorn, which Tapu Bulu can beat. Ferrothorn is great in making the defensive backbone of a Grass team, switching into Ice- and Bug-type moves from Pokemon such as Weavile and Golisopod, as well as setting an entry hazard in either Stealth Rock or Spikes. Cradily is able to switch into special-attacking Pokemon such as Zapdos, Galarian Moltres, and Kyurem, which can all prove troublesome to Grass, while also providing Stealth Rock to help Tapu Bulu break through teams more easily. Amoonguss switches into physical attackers that can threaten the rest of Grass such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Mimikyu, provides utility in Spore and Clear Smog to stop setup sweepers such as Zarude and Dragonite, and can absorb Toxic Spikes.</p>"

Scald deals with Steel- and Ground-types such as Corviknight and Nidoking, and it threatens to burn incoming physical attackers such as Celesteela, which Tapu Fini can then use as setup fodder. Draining Kiss hits Dragon-types like Dragapult and Hydreigon super effectively and lets Tapu Fini regain health. Taunt allows Tapu Fini to thwart Haze attempts from foes like Toxapex and Mantine. Substitute can be used over Taunt to prevent foes like Toxic Victini from statusing it once Misty Terrain runs out, in addition to blocking Celesteela's Leech Seed. It also lets Tapu Fini safely damage offensive checks such as Thundurus-T, and it prevents Clear Smog Gastrodon from clearing Tapu Fini's boosts. 184 Defense EVs ease the matchup against Celesteela and Dragonite, and 8 Special Attack EVs guarantee Scald 2HKOes Thundurus-T when Tapu Fini is at +1. 8 EVs in Special Defense prevent Gastrodon from breaking its Substitute with Earth Power. 56 Speed EVs let Taunt Tapu Fini outspeed Jolly Azumarill to prevent it from using Belly Drum, as well as Mantine to stop its Haze.</p> <p>Klefki is a superb teammate for Tapu Fini, as not only does it set dual screens to let Tapu Fini set up more easily, but it is also immune to Poison. It can also set Spikes to assist Tapu Fini's sweep attempts. Tapu Bulu is also a great teammate, as it can deal with Toxapex and Mantine, both of which cause trouble for Tapu Fini. However, the latter is only problematic if using Substitute. Tapu Bulu can also deal with troublesome Steel- and Poison-types, such as Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking, with Close Combat and High Horsepower. Tapu Lele is another solid option, as it threatens Poison- and Water-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Mantine with Psychic and Thunderbolt, all while pressuring Kyurem and drawing in Dragalge to chip it. Tapu Koko threatens Water-types and Cinderace and brings Tapu Fini in against foes such as Landorus-T with U-turn. Clefable is a strong utility option, providing Knock Off and Stealth Rock support while threatening Steel-types such as Ferrothorn with Flamethrower. Azumarill is also a good teammate for Tapu Fini, as it can remove items from foes like Tornadus-T and Thundurus-T, making them prone to Stealth Rock wearing them down.

Toxapex deals with Choice Scarf Zarude and Tapu Bulu, which give Tapu Fini trouble.

Its part-Rock typing contributes to Poison a lot by threatening Fire-type Pokemon like Volcarona, Victini, and Alolan Marowak with Power Gem and Meteor Beam. Nihilego's coverage moves in Thunderbolt, Grass Knot, and Dazzling Gleam allow it to also check Pokemon like Corviknight, Seismitoad, and Dragapult. Although Nihilego is an amazing revenge killer with both of its sets, it's vulnerable to Water-, Steel-, and Ground-type attacks and priority users like Urshifu-R , Crawdaunt, and Scizor. Its poor physical bulk makes it take a chunk from physical attacks like Knock Off from both offensive and defensive Pokemon.</p>",

Choice Band Galarian Zapdos is a good partner for Buzzwole, as it acts as a powerful wallbreaker early- and mid-game while also being able to bring in Buzzwole safely with U-turn. It can also overpower defensive walls like Hippowdon, Celesteela, and Skarmory, allowing Buzzwole to sweep. Toxicroak is a good partner to improve the matchup against Fairy and Water teams, which can be a big problem to deal with for Fighting teams. Lastly, Swords Dance Guts Heracross can act as a wallbreaker and deal with defensive walls like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Amoonguss. Furthermore, it can also switch into status moves directed at Buzzwole.</p>"

  "Celesteela": {
    "overview": "<h3>Flying</h3> <p>Celesteela's stellar defensive typing, handy resistances, and impressive mixed bulk make it a potent defensive pivot for Flying teams, allowing it to check physical and special threats and soft check Pokemon like Kyurem. Its Steel typing allows it to check Rock- and Ice-type threats such as Terrakion, Tyranitar, Nihilego, and Weavile. It also has quite the colorful movepool, ranging from options such as Leech Seed, Toxic, Flamethrower, Meteor Beam, and Autotomize, letting it run defensive or offensive sets. Even as a defensive wall, Celesteela has offensive potential with Heavy Slam and Flamethrower, letting it beat Pokemon such as Dragonite and Bisharp, which its competitors like Defog Corviknight fail to do. However, Celesteela lacks a reliable recovery move unlike Corviknight, which can also act as a wincon with Bulk Up or provide Defog support. A lack of a reliable recovery move and its over reliance on Leech Seed + Protect on its defensive set can be taken advantage of by setup sweepers like Bisharp, Garchomp, and Aegislash. Additionally, it also makes it unable to recover against Grass-types, making it harder for it to beat certain bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss. It also cannot stomach ridiculously strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Urshifu-R and Choice Specs Aegislash. Celesteela is also easily shut down by stallbreakers like Mew and Mandibuzz.</p> <h3>Steel</h3> <p>Celesteela's Flying type is invaluable for Steel teams to switch into Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Landorus and Excadrill while also being neutral to Fighting for Pokemon like Buzzwole and Terrakion. It can pair with Heatran and Aegislash to form the fabled triple immunity core—three immunities on top of Steel's Poison immunity—which many types have trouble dealing with. Good bulk along with the combination of Leech Seed, Toxic, and Protect allows Celesteela to wear down and hugely hinder most teams. It beats a majority of opposing walls like Mantine and Gastrodon, wearing them down while being immune to Toxic itself. On the off chance it KOes an opposing Pokemon, Celesteela can take advantage of the increase in Defense from Beast Boost to be an even greater wall. Though Celesteela is the best Flying-type choice for Steel teams overall, it faces competition from Skarmory and Corviknight, which both have reliable recovery and other distinguishing traits. Corviknight is an invaluable defensive pivot, has Defog, and can stall out Stealth Rock with Pressure. Skarmory offers much greater physical bulk to deal with Urshifu-R and Weavile, Pokemon Celesteela might struggle against in the long run, and can set entry hazards. Further, Celesteela's typing leaves it vulnerable to Fire- and Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Victini and Thundurus-T.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p>An offensive set with Autotomize, Meteor Beam, and Power Herb can be used to act as a threatening cleaner; however, such a set is mostly confined to offensive Flying-type teams and suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, having to choose between Air Slash, Flash Cannon, Giga Drain, and Flamethrower. A specially defensive set can also be used to better deal with threats like Choice Specs Kyurem and Nidoking.</p> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>A fully specially defensive set allows Celesteela to better take on Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Nidoking, and Galarian Moltres, though it becomes less useful against physical threats such as Mamoswine and Terrakion. Specially offensive Meteor Beam + Autotomize sets can heavily threaten and sweep teams with Beast Boost, though they have severe four-moveslot syndrome and will find themselves ineffective in certain matchups depending on what coverage is run.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Flying</h4> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers like Urshifu-R, Nidoking, and Choice Specs Spectrier can easily break apart Celesteela and prevent it from checking physical attackers.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: As a defensive Pokemon, Celesteela is susceptible to Knock Off and residual damage from burns and Stealth Rock that can wear it down over time.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon like Mew, Mandibuzz, and Drapion can shut down Celesteela and remove its item with Knock Off, denying its recovery and making it vulnerable to being worn out throughout the match.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Celesteela struggles to get past certain defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Rotom-W, all of which can leave Celesteela crippled with a burn or paralysis.</p> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Hard-hitting Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Nidoking output too much damage for Celesteela to heal off and don't immediately fear its moves.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon like Taunt Mandibuzz and Mew can prevent Celesteela from using its status moves while whittling it down with attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: While Celesteela is immune to Toxic, Pokemon that can inflict other status like Toxapex and Klefki severely hinder its passive recovery with Leech Seed and Protect.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Walls with Regenerator like Amoonguss—if lacking Flamethrower—and Toxapex can stall out Celesteela's movepool by repeatedly switching in and out. Toxic helps Celesteela against some walls like Mantine and Gastrodon, but the earlier two are immune, as are others like Corviknight.</p>",

Protect is needed to safely get Leech Seed's recovery and scout against Pokemon like Galarian Darmanitan and Choice Specs Tapu Koko. Heavy Slam is important to deal with threatening Rock-. Fairy-, and Ice-types like Tyranitar, Tapu Lele, and Weavile and also hits neutral targets like Nidoking, Tapu Koko, and Dragapult decently hard. Flamethrower is important, as it allows Celesteela to deal with Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and opposing Celesteela. Toxic allows Celesteela to wear down walls such as Swampert, Slowking, Mandibuzz, Mantine, and Hippowdon, making it much easier for Celesteela's offensive teammates like Thundurus-T, Dragonite, and Galarian Zapdos to shine.</p> <p>The entirety of Flying-type teams benefit from Celesteela's presence. Ice- and Rock-weak Pokemon like Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Zapdos appreciate Celesteela taking on threats like Mamoswine and Tyranitar. In return, Landorus-T covers Electric-type attacks and deals with threats like Tapu Koko and Zeraora. Thundurus-T also covers Electric-type attacks for Celesteela while threatening Water-type teams for it. Physically defensive Celesteela can struggle to take on strong special attackers like Galarian Moltres, Hydreigon, and Heatran, so Pokemon like Mantine should be used to form a pair with it, as it can check such Pokemon while also covering Water- and Fire-types like Urshifu-R and Volcarona. Galarian Moltres is a great setup sweeper and wallbreaker that can break down passive defensive walls for Celesteela like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Slowbro. Zapdos is another great teammate, as it can run a variety of sets to support it; the specially defensive set forms a defensive core with it, while the more threatening Choice Specs set simply blasts away Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Ferrothorn, making it easier for Celesteela to defensively threaten opposing teams. Galarian Zapdos can take care of opposing Steel-types for Celesteela, especially when Flamethrower is not used on the set. In return, Galarian Zapdos appreciates Celesteela weakening teams for it.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Heavy Slam, bolstered by Celesteela's sky-high weight, hits a majority of Pokemon like Hydreigon and Terrakion for decent damage. Leech Seed is Celesteela's only form of healing outside of Leftovers and is therefore vital for keeping it healthy, as well as whittling down potential switch-ins like Heatran and Zapdos. Protect lets Celesteela scout Choice item users like Victini and Galarian Darmanitan and gain additional opportunities for healing from Leech Seed and Leftovers. Flamethrower deals meaningful damage to Steel- and Grass-type Pokemon that it might otherwise struggle against, notably Ferrothorn, Zarude, and opposing Celesteela, stopping the first two from setting up freely against it. Toxic is an option over Flamethrower to pressure opposing walls like Hippowdon and Mantine, as well as potential switch-ins expecting Heavy Slam like Volcarona and Zeraora. It also synergizes with Protect for building Toxic damage while healing. Maximum HP and Defense investment, with an Impish nature, allows Celesteela to best fit its role as a physical wall to handle Pokemon like Terrakion and Mamoswine. A Relaxed nature is used with Flamethrower to avoid weakening either of its attacking moves.</p> <p>Nearly the entire roster of Steel-types appreciates Celesteela's Ground immunity and Fighting neutrality, as well as the passive recovery from Leech Seed. Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Aegislash with Protect or King's Shield can pair with Celesteela to severely hinder Choice item Pokemon from making progress. Heatran pairs great with Celesteela to check opposing Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn, switch into potential Fire-type attacks from Pokemon like Victini, provide Stealth Rock support, and phaze setup sweepers like Hydreigon and Togekiss with Roar. An offensive set with Magma Storm + Taunt can be used to trap and eliminate other walls like Toxapex that threaten Celesteela. Excadrill and Ferrothorn both can switch into Electric-type attacks. Excadrill also offers entry hazard removal, and Choice Scarf Excadrill can revenge kill threats like Cinderace and Zeraora, while Swords Dance Excadrill is a potent sweeper that can be a huge threat to certain types like Poison and Electric. Ferrothorn also brings setup, and its resistance to Water helps it to take care of bulky Water-types like Swampert and Slowking for Celesteela, especially if Celesteela lacks Toxic. Ferrothorn itself appreciates Celesteela's neutrality to Fighting. Aegislash and Celesteela are able to form an anti-Fighting core with their immunity and neutrality, respectively, to deal with Pokemon that normally pose a large threat to Steel-type teams like Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos. Bisharp threatens certain switch-ins like Slowking, removes Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers to allow Celesteela to better punish switches, and deals with numerous threats for Steel-type teams like Victini and Alolan Raichu. Melmetal is a bulky offensive threat, great at forcing progress, that strongly benefits from Leech Seed's recovery, as it has no reliable healing. Jirachi can be a powerful offensive option to threaten Water-, Dragon-, and Poison-types like Toxapex, Kommo-o, and Hydreigon, which all give Celesteela trouble one way or another.</p>"

Its good bulk allows it to set up Trick Room at least once and remove threats to Rock, such as Rillaboom and Scizor. While Stakataka can plow through more offensive teams, such as Dragon and Fairy teams, it struggles against teams that sport physical walls such as Toxapex and Hippowdon, which stall it out without a boost from Beast Boost. Due to this, it requires the support of special wallbreakers such as Nihilego and Omastar to pave the way for it to sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Rock</h4> <p>Earthquake can be used over Heat Crash to hit Electric-types super effectively and hit threats like Melmetal and Toxapex harder, but it comes at the cost of being walled by Amoonguss and Ferrothorn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Rock</h4> <p><strong>Kommo-o</strong>: Kommo-o is immune to Gyro Ball thanks to Bulletproof, resists Stakataka's other standard moves, and threatens it with Body Press.

Gyro Ball threatens Fairy-types, such as Tapu Bulu and Clefable, and faster Pokemon that do not resist it such as Dragapult and Hydreigon due to Stakataka's extremely low Speed. Heat Crash threatens Steel- and Grass-types that take minimal damage from Gyro Ball, like Ferrothorn and Amoonguss. Stone Edge nails Water- and Flying-types such as Rotom-W and Mantine. 15 Defense IVs with a Lonely nature make Stakataka's Defense equal to its Attack, which allows it to get an Attack boost when it KOes a foe and potentially snowball. Air Balloon allows Stakataka to switch into and set up Trick Room on Ground-types like Garchomp and Choice Scarf Excadrill.</p> <p>Tyranitar is a valuable partner thanks to its ability to check special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Kyurem, boost Stakataka's Special Defense through sand, and set Stealth Rock to help chip opposing Pokemon. Rhyperior helps check Fighting-types like Buzzwole and Terrakion, as well as Poison- and Electric-types. Nihilego breaks through physical walls such has Hippowdon and Galarian Corsola with its powerful special attacks, paving the way for Stakataka to sweep. Diancie helps versus Fighting- and Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Galarian Zapdos, and it can also set Trick Room to help Stakataka clean. Coalossal is also a valuable teammate, providing Spikes support and spreading burns to help Stakataka set up Trick Room.

  "Blacephalon": {
    "overview": "<h3>Fire</h3> <p>High Special Attack, good Speed, a good STAB combination, and Beast Boost to steamroll teams make Blacephalon a threatening revenge killer for Fire teams. Choice Scarf lets it revenge kill Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zeraora, and Thundurus-T, which are otherwise threats to Fire teams. However, Blacephalon has pitiful bulk and finds it really hard to come into battle. Due to its poor bulk, even resisted attacks tend to take a good chunk of its health. Due to its typing, Blacephalon is weak to common priority moves like Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Aqua Jet from Pokemon such as Bisharp, Aegislash, and Azumarill, which makes it easy to check. A lacking movepool also makes it more predictable for opposing teams.</p> <h3>Ghost</h3> <p>Blacephalon is gifted with one of the game's highest Special Attack stats, a great ability in Beast Boost, and a great secondary typing in Fire, making it a fierce sweeper. Beast Boost and Choice Scarf allow it to snowball through many teams and be one of the best revenge killers in the tier, outspeeding key threats to Ghost teams like Zeraora and Dragapult as well as Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T. However, Blacephalon is extremely frail and is threatened by any super effective priority move such as Aqua Jet, Sucker Punch, or Shadow Sneak from users like Azumarill, Bisharp, and Mimikyu. Furthermore, Blacephalon's poor bulk gives it very limited opportunities to safely switch into the field. Blacephalon can at times be difficult to fit on Ghost teams because it faces competition from other strong revenge killers and wallbreakers like Gengar and Spectrier. It can also struggle to break through bulky Pokemon like Heatran and Mantine, which easily prevent it from sweeping. Blacephalon also has a sizable entry hazard weakness, being weak to Stealth Rock and losing its Choice Scarf Speed boost to Sticky Web. This limits its revenge killing opportunities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p>Blacephalon can also utilize a Choice Specs set to wallbreak, as teams will struggle to take on its already-high Special Attack after the boost; however, Fire teams greatly appreciate the Speed ceiling that Blacephalon brings to the type with a Choice Scarf. A Substitute + Calm Mind set is also an option to take on specific teams like Normal, but Cinderace already does a good job of beating such types, and Blacephalon's low bulk grants fewer opportunities to set up.</p> <h4>Ghost</h4> <p>A Calm Mind + Substitute set can help Blacephalon get past specially defensive walls, but it has very low bulk, so the Special Defense boost isn't hugely helpful. However, Blacephalon forces out most Grass- and Ice-types like Zarude and Choice Band Galarian Darmanitan, which allows it to set up as they switch and opens up new KO opportunities. This set also helps greatly in matchups like Steel and Normal; however, the low usage of Normal and Heatran having to be severely chipped in the Steel matchup leaves it less preferred. Another option is Choice Specs over the Choice Scarf, but losing the Speed boost opens Blacephalon up to OHKOs from Choice Scarf users like Galarian Darmanitan and Krookodile, or naturally faster foes such as Gengar, Spectrier, Weavile, and Dragapult.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Fire</h4> <p><strong>Priority moves</strong>: Blacephalon is often easily dealt with by common super effective priority moves like Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, Aqua Jet, and Accelerock from Pokemon such as Bisharp, Mimikyu, Azumarill, and Lycanroc.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Mantine, Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, Blissey, and Tyranitar can easily take Blacephalon's attacks. They can proceed to status or weaken Blacephalon or set up Stealth Rock in the case of Blissey and Tyranitar. However, some of them need to be wary of Trick.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users like Latios, Gengar, Dragapult, and Terrakion can outspeed Blacephalon and easily KO it.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Thunder Wave greatly hampers Blacephalon's revenge killing potential, making it vulnerable to opposing slower Pokemon. Klefki and Grimmsnarl can easily land Thunder Wave with Prankster.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Forms of residual damage like Toxic, Stealth Rock, and Spikes make Blacephalon worn out and easier to handle for opposing teams.</p> <h4>Ghost</h4> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Hydreigon and Tyranitar are immune to or resist all of Blacephalon's attacks, and many of them can take a hit and KO back.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Priority Users</strong>: Blacephalon is very weak to both revenge killers and priority users such as Choice Scarf Latios and Mimikyu, respectively, due to its extremely low bulk.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Blacephalon can struggle to blow past special walls like Blissey and Heatran; try to get rid of them before Blacephalon comes onto the field.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Blacephalon is crippled severely by status conditions. Paralysis leaves it easily revenge killed by otherwise slower Pokemon like Tapu Lele, while poison limits its effectiveness as a reliable Choice Scarf user. As Ghost teams don't carry reliable entry hazard control, Blacephalon is extremely vulnerable to entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, limiting the number of times it can switch into the field safely.</p>",

Fire Blast may be used over Flamethrower—notably to OHKO Tapu Koko without sun support —but is less reliable. Trick is important to debilitate bulky walls that can take on Blacephalon throughout the battle such as Mantine, defensive Heatran, and Blissey.

Defensive Heatran can support Blacephalon by taking on Dragon-type Pokemon like Latios for it, easing so me pressure by checking threats like Nihilego, and eliminating walls like Mantine and Toxapex.

Additionally, it can take on other Ground-types like Mamoswine and Seismitoad with Air Balloon.</p>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Plasma Fists is Zeraora's most powerful move, targets Water- and Flying-types like Slowking, Mantine, and Corviknight, and hits especially hard after a Bulk Up boost. Close Combat beats Dark-, Normal-, and Steel-types such as Hydreigon, Diggersby, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Knock Off removes items like Eviolite from threats like Galarian Corsola and Porygon2 and provides useful coverage against other Ghost- and Psychic-type foes like Dragapult, Aegislash, and Jirachi. Due to Zeraora's low physical bulk, it should get opportunities to set up on walls that it forces out like Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Celesteela.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Tapu Koko, Choice Specs Zapdos, and Alolan Raichu appreciate Zeraora taking on troublesome specially defensive walls like Blissey and Galarian Slowking while being a good setup sweeper against Dark, Steel, and Normal. Tapu Koko is a good teammate, as it deals with Dragon-types that Zeraora heavily struggles with like Garchomp and Choice Scarf Latias thanks to Dazzling Gleam. Additionally, it beats Ground-types like Hippowdon, Swampert, and Gastrodon with Grass Knot and sets Electric Terrain. Choice Specs Zapdos defeats Grass-, Dragon-, and Ground-types that Zeraora fails to take on such as Rillaboom, Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon thanks to its powerful Hurricane, making it an excellent wallbreaker. Alolan Raichu can outspeed and revenge kill dangerous foes to Zeraora such as Choice Scarf Nihilego, Choice Scarf Excadrill, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Additionally, it is also able to beat Ground-types like Swampert and Gastrodon thanks to its access to Grass Knot as well as troublesome Poison-types for Zeraora such as Amoonguss, Dragalge, Nidoking, and Galarian Weezing. Rotom-W provides Defog support and checks Water- and Fire-types like Kingdra, Barraskewda, and Cinderace. Lastly, Magnezone is a useful teammate to deal with Steel-types that Bulk Up Zeraora has trouble breaking through like Excadrill, Ground-types like Mamoswine and Seismitoad with Air Balloon, and Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Galarian Weezing.</p>"

  "Melmetal": {
    "overview": "<h3>Steel</h3> <p>Melmetal is a frightening wallbreaker on Steel teams thanks to its sky-high Attack stat and its ability in Iron Fist allowing it to be a fearsome wallbreaker. Its great natural bulk allows it to tank a variety of attacks, such as Garchomp's Earthquake, and then dish out massive damage. Iron Fist increases the power of its Double Iron Bash, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch, further improving its wallbreaking prowess. Superpower, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch all allow Melmetal to target various Pokemon that Double Iron Bash isn't as effective against. Even with all these great qualities, its poor Speed means it will usually need to be healthy to tank an attack and do damage, making it more vulnerable to burns and reducing its overall effectiveness. Its special bulk is quite poor, allowing many strong special attackers such as Hydreigon and Nidoking to easily take it out with their super effective STAB attacks. Additionally, Melmetal needs to be carefully added onto Steel teams, as, it is best in matchups that Steel already excels in. Further, between the defensive core and various other options to target weaker matchups, which space is already very limited on Steel teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>Superpower may be used on the Assault Vest set over Ice Punch to deal with Ferrothorn, but this comes at a cost of not being able to immediately OHKO Thundurus-T and Landorus-T. A set consisting of Substitute, Acid Armor, Body Press, and Double Iron Bash allows Melmetal to be a late-game sweeper once special attackers such as Nidoking and Hydreigon have been removed, allowing it to clean types such as Ground, Dark, and Dragon late-game. 44 Speed EVs allow Melmetal to outspeed and flinch down Gastrodon, but the reduced bulk or damage output is significant, and Melmetal is unlikely to obtain three flinches in a row to take it down. Choice Band Melmetal can opt to run 224 Speed EVs to outspeed specially defensive Tyranitar, Swampert, and physically defensive Celesteela. However, the reduced bulk means Melmetal gets OHKOed by Victini and Choice Band Urshifu-R. Protective Pads may be used, as it lets Melmetal freely use Double Iron Bash without fear of contact effects, but losing Assault Vest means that it cannot check boosted threats such as Hydreigon and Clefable, and it's still being vulnerable to Scald burns from Toxapex and Slowbro.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Steel</h4> <p><strong>Super Effective Special Attacks</strong>: Special super effective attacks such as Heatran's Magma Storm, Nidoking's Earth Power, and Thundurus-T's Focus Blast are capable of OHKOing Melmetal. Most of Melmetal's bulk comes from its Defense stat, so it can be worn down by strong special attacks fairly quickly; however, these foes do need to be careful, as Double Iron Bash or a coverage move can do a good chunk of damage to them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Since Melmetal will mainly be clicking Double Iron Bash, Pokemon that resist Steel and can tank it such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Skarmory are bothersome; however, they do need to be careful of Melmetal's coverage moves such as Superpower and Thunder Punch.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Pokemon capable of inflicting Melmetal with a burn such as Galarian Corsola with Will-O-Wisp and Toxapex with Scald can cripple it, as its only value comes from its monumental Attack stat.</p>",

      "Choice Band (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Double Iron Bash is very powerful and can be used to fish for a flinch. Since Double Iron Bash strikes twice, it can take on many Pokemon with defensive abilities such as Mimikyu and Dragonite, as well as effectively hit Substitute users such as Kyurem. Ice Punch allows Melmetal to hit Flying- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Garchomp. Earthquake allows it to hit Electric-, Poison-, and Steel-type Pokemon for super effective damage such as Alolan Raichu, Toxapex, and Aegislash. Superpower hits Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and other Pokemon such as Rotom-W that can switch into its other attacks. Thunder Punch nails Water- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Slowbro, Mantine, and Celesteela. 12 EVs in Speed allow Melmetal to outpace uninvested Toxapex. Melmetal is a powerful wallbreaker; therefore, it is best to bring it in safely to wallbreak. When Melmetal is in battle, most of the time it should attack with Double Iron Bash, unless one of its coverage moves will hit the foe or a predicted switch-in harder.</p> <p>Magnezone can trap Steel-type Pokemon for Melmetal such as Celesteela in Flying teams, allowing Melmetal to fairly easily click Double Iron Bash. The two also form a great wallbreaking core, as Magnezone can break physical walls for Melmetal such as Skarmory, and Melmetal can break past special walls for Magnezone such as Blissey. Aegislash, Celesteela, and Heatran form an immunity core that covers all of Melmetal's weaknesses, which gives it a solid backbone to fall back on. The immunity core can also wear down the opposing team, allowing Melmetal to break through its foes more easily late-game. Ferrothorn helps Melmetal by providing it with a Water resistance, entry hazard support in Spikes or Stealth Rock, and Leech Seed support. Ferrothorn can also break past Pokemon that wall Melmetal such as Swampert and Gastrodon. Excadrill provides an Electric immunity, entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin, and a way to take on Pokemon such as Rotom-W, which would otherwise wall Melmetal, thanks to Mold Breaker Earthquake. Excadrill can also help Melmetal break down shared checks such as Mandibuzz and Swampert with a Swords Dance-boosted attack. Bisharp can take care of Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon for Melmetal such as Victini and Blacephalon with Sucker Punch. It can also remove items such as Toxapex's Black Sludge, allowing Melmetal to break through foes with more ease.</p>"

      "Assault Vest (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Melmetal functions as an emergency check against special setup sweepers such as Hydreigon, Galarian Moltres, and Clefable, which heavily threaten Steel teams. Double Iron Bash obliterates Fairy- and Ice-type threats such as Tapu Bulu, Clefable, and Kyurem and also lets Melmetal deal with Substitute users such as Hydreigon, Galarian Moltres, and Spectrier. Earthquake hits with Steel- and Poison-types such as Heatran, Magnezone, and Toxapex that resist Double Iron Bash. Thunder Punch punishes Water- and Flying-types such as Slowbro, Celesteela, and Corviknight, while Ice Punch handles Ground- and Flying-types such as Landorus-T and Thundurus-T. 12 Speed EVs allow Melmetal to outspeed and flinch down Toxapex with Double Iron Bash, while the remaining EVs are dumped into Attack and Special Defense to maximize its offensive prowess and special bulk. In addition to checking the aforementioned threats, Assault Vest lets Melmetal survive super effective attacks from threats such as Heatran, Nidoking, and Kyurem in a pinch and OHKO back. Melmetal is also able to check Dragonite, Dragapult, and Barraskewda due to its decent physical bulk.</p> <p>Heatran is an excellent teammate, as it checks Fire-types such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon and Volcarona and wears down the opposing team with Toxic and Stealth Rock. Although Melmetal can survive hits from threats such as Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos, it prefers to preserve its health to check more threatening special attackers such as Volcanion, Galarian Moltres, and Hydreigon. As such, checks to these physical threats such as Ferrothorn, Aegislash, and Corviknight are greatly appreciated. Ferrothorn checks Water- and Ground-types such as Barraskewda and Hippowdon while also setting entry hazards to wear down the opposing team. Leech Seed also gives Melmetal a form of passive recovery. Aegislash provides a Fighting immunity, which makes Choice-locked Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos, Zeraora, and Urshifu-R think twice before using Fighting-type moves. It also wears down walls such as Slowbro, Mantine, and Ferrothorn. In return, Melmetal deals with Dark-types such as Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon which take advantage of Aegislash. Ground-immune partners such as Celesteela, Corviknight, and Skarmory deal with Excadrill, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. Celesteela also handles Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and pressures Dragon teams, while Skarmory sets entry hazards and phazes threats like Bulk Up Landorus-T. Corviknight can take advantage of Melmetal's ability to remove special attackers such as Nidoking and Galarian Moltres, as this allows it to sweep with Iron Defense, Bulk Up, and Power Trip sets. Excadrill is an Electric-immune partner that checks Tapu Koko and Regieleki and provides entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin, allowing Melmetal to preserve its health to properly check Hydreigon and Galarian Moltres. Bisharp can use Knock Off to remove Rocky Helmet and Leftovers from Melmetal's checks, such as Toxapex and Celesteela, and deals with fast threats such as Victini, Blacephalon, and Alolan Raichu. Jirachi utilizes special sets to deal with Fighting- and Water-types such as Urshifu-R, Kommo-o, Bewear, and Gastrodon.</p>"

      "Substitute (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Substitute Melmetal takes advantage of its great wallbreaking power, which lets it exploit switches it forces against teams such as Poison, Psychic, and Steel. Furthermore, Substitute also lets it avoid Leech Seed and status from walls such as Ferrothorn, Slowbro, and Galarian Corsola. Thunder Punch threatens Water- and Flying-types such as Slowbro and Corviknight reasonably well. Alternatively, Thunder Wave alongside Double Iron Bash lets Melmetal paraflinch physical walls such as Celesteela and Toxapex. Earthquake deals with Steel- and Poison-types such as Jirachi and Toxapex, which tend to come in and scout its moves. Toxic is an alternative that wears down Ground- and Electric-types such as Swampert, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W, which don't take much damage from its STAB or coverage moves. 12 Speed EVs let Melmetal outspeed and utilize Substitute against walls such as Toxapex and Galarian Corsola, while the given bulk investment ensures its Substitute survives Amoonguss's Foul Play or Slowbro's Scald.</p> <p>Due to Melmetal's ability to force switches, teammates that can stack entry hazards such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Skarmory are ideal. Ferrothorn also checks Ground- and Water-types such as Swampert and Barraskewda and can utilize Knock Off to remove Rocky Helmet from Slowbro and Toxapex, letting Melmetal freely use Double Iron Bash. Heatran takes on Fire-type moves from Victini, Clefable, and opposing Heatran and can phaze threats such as Nasty Plot Hydreigon and Galarian Moltres. Alternatively, Heatran can utilize a Choice Scarf set to surprise threats such as Tapu Bulu and Nidoking. Corviknight is a Ground-immune partner that pivots Melmetal in against Pokemon it can take advantage of, such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Klefki. It also checks Fighting-types such as Choice Scarf Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos and can utilize Bulk Up or and Iron Defense sets to take on Iron Defense Kommo-o, all while allowing Corviknight to sweep teams such as Ground and Dark late-game. Skarmory sets entry hazards and can phaze setup sweepers like Bulk Up Landorus-T and Swords Dance Tapu Bulu, while Celesteela provides passive recovery with Leech Seed and can pressure Iron Defense Kommo-o with Air Slash. Aegislash provides a Fighting immunity, which lets it check threats like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Tapu Lele and wear down opposing walls such as Celesteela and Galarian Slowking with a Choice Specs or SubToxic set. Choice Scarf Excadrill deals with Choice Scarf Heatran, Rotom-W, and Nidoking and appreciates Melmetal's ability to wear down its checks in Slowbro and Celesteela. Alternatively, Swords Dance Excadrill benefits from Melmetal's ability to wear down roadblocks such as Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Amoonguss, allowing it to sweep Steel and Poison teams late-game. Choice Specs Jirachi deals with Poison-, Dragon-, and Water-types such as Nidoking, Hydreigon, and Gastrodon and appreciates Melmetal's ability to pressure defensive cores.</p>"

Grassy Glide under Grassy Terrain gains priority and can be used against faster Pokemon that can threaten the team like Alolan Ninetales, Mamoswine, Weavile, and Galarian Darmanitan. Superpower increases Rillaboom's coverage, allowing it to hit or even OHKO defensive Steel-types such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Knock Off gets rid of items from Pokemon that would normally switch into Rillaboom like Toxapex, Galarian Corsola, and Skarmory, as well as hitting Pokemon that resist its other attacks like Aegislash and Galarian Slowking. High Horsepower can also be used over Knock Off to increase Rillaboom's coverage and allow it to hit Poison-types like Toxapex. Life Orb allows Rillaboom to 2HKO or even OHKO threats like Gengar and Corviknight with the appropriate coverage moves after a Swords Dance boost. Maximum EVs in Speed allow Rillaboom to outspeed threats like specially defensive Heatran and Adamant Mamoswine.</p> <p>Ferrothorn can provide Spikes support, which can help chip away at the enemy team, making it easier for Rillaboom to sweep.

Amoonguss is a good partner for Rillaboom, as it can switch into many special attacks such as Gengar's Sludge Wave and remove Toxic Spikes to keep Rillaboom healthy. Cradily can set Stealth Rock for Rillaboom, allowing it to take out Pokemon such as Corviknight with +2 Superpower. Additionally, its Rock typing allows it to check Flying- and Fire-type threats to Grass teams such as Choice Specs Zapdos, Galarian Moltres, and Volcarona with Rock Blast and Recover. Zarude can check Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon for Rillaboom such as Tapu Lele and Dragapult; this is especially important for Rillaboom, as Zarude's ability to beat Tapu Lele allows Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain to become uninterrupted by Psychic teams. Additionally, its Choice Scarf set can take on +1 Quiver Dance Volcarona with Rock Slide. Celebi can take on troublesome Poison-type Pokemon for Rillaboom like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Nidoking with its Nasty Plot set, while Earth Power can also take on Dark-types such as Drapion and Skuntank. Whimsicott can take on Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-type Pokemon for Rillaboom such as Urshifu-S, Galarian Moltres, Kyurem, and Buzzwole. Additionally, Whimsicott can prevent threatening setup Pokemon such as Volcarona and Calm Mind Tapu Lele from becoming problematic by locking them into the setup move with Encore.

Life Orb and Choice Band further boost Cinderace's attacking power. However, without Heavy-Duty Boots, Cinderace becomes weak to chip damage from Stealth Rock. High Jump Kick can replace Low Kick, as it OHKOes Pokemon like Blissey and Kyurem, but it can get countered by Protect. Cinderace also has access to utility moves such as Court Change and U-turn. Court Change is a unique move that, besides generally stealing dual screans and transferring entry hazards to the other side, can specifically mitigate Fire teams' weakness to Stealth Rock. U-turn helps Cinderace escape bad matchups such as Dragonite, Hippowdon, Galarian Corsola, and Garchomp, bringing in the right teammate to deal with them, while also helping setup partners like Volcarona to come in safely.</p>",

Its Steel typing allows it to comfortably take Rock- and Ice-type moves, which would typically be problematic, such as Tyranitar's and Terrakion's Stone Edge, Cloyster's Icicle Spear,and Mamoswine's Icicle Crash; it also provides Corviknight with a variety of resistances, allowing it to switch in on other Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Excadrill. Its Steel typing also gives it a Toxic immunity, meaning Corviknight can take on defensive Stealth Rock setters such as Hippowdon, Shuckle, Piloswine, and Seismitoad that may carry the move. Pressure is particularly good on this set, as it means Corviknight can PP stall Stealth Rock users and keep entry hazards off the field more easily in conjunction with Defog. Body Press hits Pokemon such as Bisharp, Cloyster, Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Tyranitar for super effective damage, allowing Corviknight to check these Pokemon reliably. U-turn is important for Corviknight, as it can grab momentum against Pokemon it can't beat like Toxapex and Aegislash and bring in a teammate to more reliably take them on. Throughout the game, Corviknight should aim to find opportunities where it can comfortably use Defog or grab momentum using U-turn by switching in on Pokemon it walls. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Corviknight to check the aforementioned Pokemon in Mamoswine, Weavile, Cloyster, Excadrill, and Bisharp with more reliability while also boosting the power of Body Press to check these threats.</p> <p>Because Flying teams are typically weak to Stealth Rock, all of Corviknight's teammates appreciate its incredible reliability as a Defogger to keep entry hazards off the field. Choice Scarf Charizard is a great teammate for Corviknight, as it can outspeed and beat threats to Corviknight such as Choice Scarf Duraludon, Hydreigon, Aegislash, and Heliolisk; Charizard also appreciates Corviknight's Defog due to its 4x Stealth Rock weakness. Choice Scarf Noivern is another teammate that can outspeed and beat Dragon-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Dracovish and Choice Specs Dragapult. Corviknight's U-turn is also good for bringing Charizard and Noivern in comfortably in matchups such as Steel and Dragon, respectively. Togekiss is a great setup sweeper that can break through Pokemon with Nasty Plot in conjunction with Thunder Wave and Air Slash, such as Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Dragapult, that Corviknight can't get past. Mantine can be used as a secondary Defogger, switching into a variety of strong special attacks with its good special bulk and defensive typing, such as Seismitoad's and Keldeo's Hydro Pump, Choice Scarf Dragapult's and Charizard's Fire Blast, and Choice Specs Aegislash's Shadow Ball, working together with Corviknight to form a good defensive core that can remove hazards for the rest of the team.</p>"

It's a staple for Steel teams because its typing gives it a very important Ground immunity that lets it check threats such as Excadrill as well as taking neutral damage from Fighting-type attacks. Special Defense investment is crucial because it allows Corviknight to comfortably switch into attacks such as Gengar's Shadow Ball and Flygon's Flamethrower. Mirror Armor is used to take on common Mystical Fire users, such as Hatterene, Indeedee, and Gardevoir, and lower their Special Attack. Mirror Armor can also help it avoid Special Defense drops from attacks like Shadow Ball. Bulk Up boosts Corviknight's already decent Defense, making it more difficult to take down, and increases its offensive pressure by boosting its Attack, allowing Brave Bird to break defensive Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Hippowdon more easily. Brave Bird is its best STAB move and hits threatening Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Kommo-o that take very little from its other attacking options for super effective damage. Alternatively, it can use Power Trip, which becomes very strong after a couple of boosts, to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively at the cost of not being able to take on Fighting-types as effectively. Roost, paired with Leftovers, gives Corviknight a form of recovery to support its bulky setup and increase its longevity. Taunt prevents Toxapex from using Haze, Hippowdon from phazing Corviknight with Whirlwind, Ferrothorn from setting up entry hazards, and other Pokemon from recovering, setting up, or using their own Taunt. Due to its great bulk, Corviknight can afford to switch into threatening attacks, as its main role is to apply defensive pressure. It should find opportunities to use Bulk Up against passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and against Pokemon that don't threaten to 2HKO it such as Choice Scarf Terrakion.</p> <p>Ferrothorn forms a great defensive core with Corviknight and provides an important resistance to Water for Steel teams, as they're threatened by powerful attacks such as Seismitoad's Hydro Pump. Ferrothorn can also use Leech Seed and set up entry hazards to soften up the opposing team to make it easier for Corviknight to sweep. Excadrill covers Corviknight's weakness to Electric-type attacks, such as Zeraora's Plasma Fists, and can threaten Electric- and Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Charizard with its Mold Breaker Earthquake and Rock Slide, respectively, as well as revenge killing threats such as Hydreigon and SubToxic Salazzle. Choice Scarf Duraludon is another great partner that can revenge kill troublesome Pokemon such as Dragapult and Hydreigon and use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis on the opposing team to give Corviknight an easier time dealing with otherwise faster foes. Aegislash appreciates Corviknight's Ground immunity and in return can wallbreak the opposing team to weaken Corviknight's checks. Aegislash's Fighting immunity allows it to check threats such as Terrakion, and its good bulk also lets it survive some attacks that threaten Corviknight, such as Hydreigon and Dragapult's Fire Blast, whose users Aegislash can OHKO in return. Jirachi is a good option for breaking Water teams with its great coverage, notably being able to threaten Keldeo and Toxapex with its STAB-boosted Psychic. Melmetal is a very powerful and bulky wallbreaker that can soften up the opposing team to allow Corviknight to set up more easily and win. Lucario and Bisharp can also break holes in the opponent's team by setting up with Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, respectively, and they're great against Dark- and Psychic-type teams.</p>"

Additionally, Melmetal's Double Iron Bash can target Fairy- and Dark-type Pokemon that resist Corviknight's Power Trip, such as Galarian Moltres on Flying teams. Excadrill provides an Electric immunity and handles threats such as Tapu Koko. Ferrothorn can stack entry hazards alongside Heatran and wear down the opposing team with Leech Seed, allowing Corviknight to clean late-game. Ferrothorn also provides a resistance to Water, which it uses to check threats such as Tapu Fini. Also, Choice Specs Jirachi can help break through tough Poison-type Pokemon like Amoonguss and Toxapex with Psychic, and Dark-type Pokemon like Hydreigon with Moonblast, all of which can threaten Corviknight. On hyper offense teams, Klefki can provide dual screens support to make it easier for Corviknight to set up.</p>"

Dual screens support is great for Psychic teams, as it not only makes Orbeetle's teammates harder to revenge kill but also aids setup sweepers in setting up much more efficiently. Sticky Web, on the other hand, slows down faster threats like Choice Scarf Weavile and Gengar, allowing teammates like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Jirachi to deal with such threats much more easily and to threaten opposing teams better. Orbeetle should be used early-game so that it can provide essential support to the team to have momentum going; however, when faced against teams with Magic Bounce users like Hatterene and Xatu, it's best not to set up Sticky Web recklessly, as it can backfire. U-turn should be used to switch into an appropriate teammate after Orbeetle has set screens or Sticky Web. Frisk allows Orbeetle to scout for items on the opposing teams. Maximum HP and Speed EVs with a Timid nature make Orbeetle as fast as possible to outspeed Pokemon like Rotom-H and Mamoswine while surviving as many hits as possible doing so. Light Clay increases the number of turns Reflect and Light Screen stay on the field.</p> <p>All of Orbeetle's teammates appreciate it providing dual screens and Sticky Web support. Setup Pokemon like Calm Mind Hatterene, Nasty Plot Mew, Necrozma, and Reuniclus appreciate Orbeetle's support to set up more easily. Stallbreaker Mew can help prevent Pokemon like Corviknight and Pelipper from removing Sticky Web and dual screens. Other offensive Pokemon like Choice Scarf Jirachi and Gardevoir can outspeed faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Dragapult and Gengar with Sticky Web support. A wallbreaker like Indeedee benefits from the support provided by Orbeetle, granting it more chances to wreck havoc on the opposing team. Celebi can also be used for Stealth Rock and Healing Wish support, and it can also take on Water- and Ground-type Pokemon like Seismitoad and Excadrill for the team.</p>"

Spikes allows it to help chip opposing Pokemon on the switch in to help offensive teammates like Barbaracle and Tyranitar sweep. Fire Blast takes care of troublesome Steel- and Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Celebi. Heavy Slam allows Coalossal to greatly damage Fairy-types like Togekiss, Hatterene, and Mimikyu. Rapid Spin gives Rock teams a way to remove hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes in matchups such as Poison and Bug that could stop a teammate from sweeping. Flame Body is very good against physical attackers such as Jirachi and Bisharp to hinder them with a burn. Use Coalossal early-game to get down Spikes to make it easier for its teammates to sweep. It is also useful mid-game to help get rid of troublesome entry hazards. 252 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs with a Sassy nature let Coalossal take hits from Mew and Hatterene.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Terrakion, Rhyperior, and Tyranitar appreciate Coalossal removing entry hazards like Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes that could stop them from sweeping. Barbaracle is an excellent teammate to take care of Ground-types such as Seismitoad and Mamoswine with Grass Knot and Liquidation, and it appreciates Coalossal to break Dugtrio's Focus Sash with Spikes. Shuckle can form a hazard stacking duo with Coalossal to further support setup Pokemon, setting Stealth Rock and Sticky Web to help its teammates such as Shell Smash Barbaracle, Swords Dance Terrakion, and Dragon Dance Tyranitar sweep. Tyranitar is also useful for setting sand that helps Coalossal stomach special attacks even better. Rhyperior is great for taking care of Corviknight with Smack Down + Earthquake, which Coalossal struggles to deal with. Terrakion can greatly help with taking care of Excadrill, Urshifu-S, and Hydreigon with Close Combat. Lycanroc-D helps to handle Poison-types such as Toxapex and can use Accelerock to finish off Pokemon like Volcarona and Scolipede. Lunatone can also be a good partner, as it can come in on Ground-type attacks due to Levitate and take care of troubling Pokemon like Toxapex thanks to its Psychic typing.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>Barraskewda is the premier Swift Swim user on rain-based Water teams due to its blazing high Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire metagame in rain, and ability to hit hard. Due to these traits, Barraskewda is useful in a plethora of matches, namely Electric and other matchups such as Dark, which it can take on by itself. This is backed by its great coverage moves in Close Combat, Psychic Fangs, and Crunch, allowing it to hit a multitude of different threats such as Kyurem, Amoonguss, and Slowking. Flip Turn grants rain teams with more pivoting, allowing the archetype to have a lot of momentum. However, Barraskewda has pretty poor defensive stats, meaning it can be easily revenge killed by faster threats outside of the rain such as Dragapult and common priority such as Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak.</p>",

Psychic Fangs grants Barraskewda coverage against Poison- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, Keldeo, and Urshifu-R. Crunch can be used over Psychic Fangs to target Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Latios, Dragapult, and Jellicent. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to chip foes such as physically defensive Rotom-W, allowing it to KO it later with Waterfall, and maintain momentum. Swift Swim allows Barraskewda to outpace threats such as Alolan Raichu in Electric Terrain, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Thundurus-T in rain. Maximum Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature allows Barraskewda to outspeed Tapu Koko and Spectrier outside of rain while outpacing +2 Adamant Dragapult in rain. An Adamant nature can be used to 2HKO Toxapex with Psychic Fangs and 2HKO Mandibuzz in rain with Waterfall. Barraskewda and its teammates can continually spam Flip Turn and their pivoting moves, allowing rain teams to continually generate momentum and bring in Barraskewda safely.</p> <p>All of Barraskewda's teammates appreciate it taking on threats such as Alolan Raichu, Zeraora, and +2 Volcarona in rain and generating momentum with Flip Turn. Pelipper enables Swift Swim, making it a mandatory teammate for Barraskewda. Physically defensive Pelipper can take on threats such as Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu with Hurricane, bring Barraskewda in safely with U-turn, provide a reliable Ground immunity, and clear entry hazards for it with Defog. Urshifu-R is a powerful wallbreaker that can eliminate Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, clearing a path for Barraskewda in the Steel matchup. It can also help Barraskewda break down shared checks such as Iron Defense Corviknight with Surging Strikes and deal with bulky Water-types such as Mantine and Pelipper with Thunder Punch. Swampert sets Stealth Rock, provides an Electric immunity, takes on Electric-types like Zeraora outside of rain with Earthquake, and brings Barraskewda in safely with Flip Turn. Slowking provides a reliable switch-in into Psychic-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Psychic, helps Barraskewda pressure Poison- and Water-types like Toxapex with Future Sight, and safely brings in Barraskewda with Teleport. Slowking also acts as a nice sponge for special attacks such as Latios's Draco Meteor. Kingdra is Barraskewda's best partner, targeting matchups where Barraskewda struggles such as Dragon, taking on Grass-types like Amoonguss and Zarude with Hurricane, and generating momentum with Flip Turn. Like Kingdra, Choice Scarf Tapu Fini can help out in the Dragon matchup without being reliant on rain, cripple walls such as Porygon2 with Trick, and clear entry hazards with Defog. Crawdaunt can put in work in the Psychic and Ghost matchups, claiming an OHKO each time it is brought in safely, as well as disrupting opposing progress in the Water mirror by taking out Slowking and Toxapex.</p>"

Volt Switch allows Toxtricity to act as a pivot that can be used when predicting a Pokemon that resists the two aforementioned moves to come into the field such as Ferrothorn.

Furthermore, due do its very middling Speed, Sticky Web support from Vikavolt is greatly needed in order for it to outspeed opposing Pokemon. Finally, slow pivot support from Pokemon like Rotom-W immensely benefits Toxtricity, allowing it to be brought in safely and gain KOs, as its mediocre defenses disallow it from taking on many attacks. Both Vikavolt and Rotom-W's ability in Levitate helps Toxtricity by allowing them to deal with Ground-type attacks for it as well.</p>"

Sludge Wave is primarily used against Fairy- and Grass-type Pokemon, as otherwise, Boomburst is its most powerful attack. Volt Switch allows Toxtricity to pivot and give its teammates safe switches in or put its foe in range of its attack the next time it switches in. Toxtricity's part-Electric typing makes it very valuable against Water- and Flying-type teams and allows it to break Corviknight, which is otherwise a threat to Poison. Its Speed and bulk are mediocre, hence it prefers switching in on passive Pokemon that can't do too much damage or being brought in on a predicted switch.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing covers Toxtricity's big weakness to Ground-type attacks and can remove entry hazards that hinder Toxtricity's longevity with Defog. Drapion is immune to Psychic-type attacks that threaten Toxtricity and can set up Toxic Spikes to weaken the opponent's team to support Toxtricity's wallbreaking. Drapion also has access to STAB Knock Off, which provides useful utility in removing the foe's item. Gengar is a great revenge killer that can handle faster threats such as Hydreigon and Galarian Darmanitan. Salazzle helps break Steel-type Pokemon, notably Ferrothorn, which are problematic for Poison teams to deal with. It can also annoy many teams with its Corrosion-boosted Toxic combined with Substitute and Protect, and it pivots into Toxapex. Defensive Vileplume is a great partner for checking Mold Breaker Excadrill thanks to its typing, which lets it take neutral hits from Ground, and access to Strength Sap and Sleep Powder, which allow it to consistently check it. Toxapex acts as a great pivot to strong attacks that threaten Toxtricity such as Charizard's Fire Blast and Weavile's Icicle Crash.</p>"

Giga Drain does more damage to Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types and lets Polteageist heal some HP. White Herb gets rid of the Defense drops from Shell Smash to give Polteageist a better chance of surviving an attack while setting up. Focus Sash is another option; however, Ghost teams don't tend to run entry hazard removal, making it inconsistent. Even at +2 Speed, Polteageist doesn't outspeed Choice Scarf Gengar and some weather sweepers such as Sand Rush Excadrill and Swift Swim Barraskewda, making Weak Armor is the preferred ability for the additional +2 boost in Speed if Polteageist gets hit with a physical attack. However, even though it has good Special Defense, Polteageist's low HP and Defense mean it can't set up so easily in front of powerful attackers. It's also susceptible to priority moves such as Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Aqua Jet. Polteageist should be used as a late-game sweeper or to dent teams early-game.</p> <p>Dragapult is a great teammate because it can set up Reflect and Light Screen to let Polteageist set up much more easily.

Galarian Corsola and Runerigus can set up Stealth Rock for even more damage to the opposing team, supporting Polteageist's late-game sweep. Runerigus can also use Memento to give Polteageist easy setup opportunities.

Psyshock hits special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Dragalge hard, while Psychic lets Hatterene pressure Toxapex better. Draining Kiss allows Hatterene to hit Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Galarian Moltres and Kyurem hard. Additionally, it provides Hatterene with recovery, making it harder to revenge kill. Trick Room takes advantage of its naturally low Speed. Calm Mind + Trick Room allows Hatterene to very easily take on teams that are weak to its STAB attacks, and it can flip the matchups against Electric and rain Water teams, which typically rely on their high Speed. The EVs and a Relaxed nature make it as slow as possible for Trick Room. Leftovers helps Hatterene set up.</p> <p>Hatterene's teammates appreciate it both deterring entry hazards and soft checking Dark-type Pokemon. As Hatterene is walled by Steel-types such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn, Victini, a teammate that pressures both, is a great choice. Victini also loves Hatterene keeping Stealth Rock off the field, allowing it to preserve its health to wallbreak with a Choice Band set. Slowbro is a fantastic defensive pivot that can provide Psychic teams breathing room against threats such as Choice Scarf Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Weavile. Slowbro also generates momentum for the team through Teleport, safely bringing in a teammate while regaining health thanks to Regenerator. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele forms an offensive core with Hatterene and cleans up types such as Dragon and Dark once Hatterene has worn down or eliminated Dragalge or Tyranitar, for example. Choice Scarf Jirachi can take on Fairy- and Ice-type Pokemon that can threaten Hatterene, such as opposing Hatterene and Galarian Darmanitan, with Iron Head. Jirachi can also provide Hatterene with a new lease on life through Healing Wish or pivot it in safely with U-turn. Galarian Slowking absorbs Toxic Spikes for Hatterene, which is especially useful because Hatterene is unlikely to switch into common setters like Dragalge, and is a decent specially defensive wall that keeps threats such as specially defensive Aegislash and Heatran at bay. Choice Scarf Latias picks off fast threats such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon, non-Choice Scarf Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Zarude and provides Healing Wish support. Stallbreaker Mew with a Kasib Berry can cripple physical attackers such as Zeraora and Tyranitar with Will-O-Wisp, lure in and remove Blacephalon and Dragapult with Knock Off, and get rid of bulky Pokemon's Leftovers with Knock Off, allowing Hatterene to sweep more easily.</p>"

Rest and Sleep Talk are used together to give Grimmsnarl a form of recovery, allowing Grimmsnarl to set up more consistently. With Rest, Grimmsnarl makes a good sponge to status conditions such as burn and Toxic poison as well. Spirit Break is used to deal significant damage against types such as Dragon and Fighting and in mirror matchups. The Special Attack drop from Spirit Break also allows Grimmsnarl to take on specially offensive Pokemon that it struggles against, such as Duraludon, pairing well with Bulk Up boosting its Defense. Prankster complements Grimmsnarl's whole set, as it allows Grimmsnarl to almost always move first, helping Dark-type teams with handling powerful foes such as Zeraora and Dracozolt. However, Sleep Talk rolls often are too unreliable to handle Steel- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Duraludon, and Gardevoir, so it is recommended to not take any risks against foes that can naturally beat Grimmsnarl. Leftovers grants Grimmsnarl additional passive recovery.

Drapion sets up Toxic Spikes for Grimmsnarl, forcing opposing Pokemon to switch more often, thus allowing Grimmsnarl to set up more consistently. With a Choice Scarf set, Drapion also drastically improves the Fairy-type matchup. Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock, which can negate Focus Sash and Sturdy of foes like Duraludon to prevent them from revenge killing Grimmsnarl. With its good special bulk, Tyranitar can also handle specially offensive Fairy-type threats for Grimmsnarl, such as Ribombee and Gardevoir. Bisharp's part Steel typing allows it to handle slow Fairy-types such as Clefable and Hatterene. It can also beat opposing RestTalk Grimmsnarl and has a powerful STAB priority in Sucker Punch that helps with taking on fast threats such as Arctozolt. Mandibuzz provides Defog support to Grimmsnarl, which allows Grimmsnarl to switch in and set up more safely.

        "description": "<p>Grimmsnarl is capable of serving as an effective setup sweeper using Bulk Up when paired with Rest's recovery and Sleep Talk giving it the ability to set up and attack while asleep. Prankster is amazing for this set, as it gives priority to Grimmsnarl's Bulk Up along with Rest and Sleep Talk; this helps tremendously against offensive Pokemon, as it allows Grimmsnarl to boost, heal, and use Darkest Lariat if picked by Sleep Talk first. Darkest Lariat's the chosen attack, as its ability to hit through Defense boosts allows Grimmsnarl to serve as a solid answer to opposing setup sweepers that boost Defense, such as Corviknight and Snorlax. Darkest Lariat is also effective against Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Bronzong, Reuniclus, Gengar, and Aegislash, while also hitting other Steel-type Pokemon such as Excadrill and Corviknight, which Fairy teams appreciate. Though Rest does give it recovery, be aware that Sleep Talk is not always reliable, so Rest should be used on an as-needed basis. As it has a poor unboosted Defense stat, Grimmsnarl should try to set up on defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight, Bronzong, and Seismitoad rather than wallbreakers such as Mamoswine, Galarian Darmanitan, and Diggersby.</p> <p>Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Hatterene are good partners for Grimmsnarl, as they can all take down Poison-type Pokemon such as Vileplume and Toxapex that Grimmsnarl often struggles with. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can also beat faster wallbreakers such as Barraskewda, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Mamoswine that give Grimmsnarl issues before it sets up, and it can provide Healing Wish support if Grimmsnarl gets worn down. Because Grimmsnarl forces switches frequently, Clefable's ability to set up Stealth Rock for Grimmsnarl allows it to break apart teams more easily. Mimikyu and Grimmsnarl form a good core that can work together to beat Ghost and Psychic teams with their super effective attacks. Mimikyu can also take on Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Gengar that Grimmsnarl struggles with, while it and Togekiss appreciate Grimmsnarl's ability to serve as a status sponge against status inducers such as Galarian Corsola and Seismitoad with Rest.</p>"

An above-average Speed tier means Obstagoon is also a useful attacker against offensive teams, being able to outspeed and OHKO threats such as Crawdaunt, Gallade, and Diggersby. Taunt enables Obstagoon to stallbreak defensive Pokemon by disabling their forms of recovery and prevents opposing entry hazards from going up, which Normal usually has trouble removing. Facade and Knock Off hit any non-resistant Pokemon hard after the Guts boost. Close Combat rounds off this set, allowing Obstagoon to have a better presence against Steel and Dark by nailing Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Bisharp. Flame Orb is used to activate Guts, also letting Obstagoon act as a status absorber.</p> <p>All of Obstagoon's teammates naturally benefit from its presence, as it can absorb much-hated status with Guts. Wallbreakers like Choice Band Diggersby, Choice Specs Indeedee, and Heliolisk are able to weaken or beat defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Corviknight for Obstagoon, therefore taking pressure off it versus bulkier teams. Particularly, Diggersby can also set up Spikes to further increase Obstagoon's effectiveness, while Heliolisk can check most Water-types, notably Keldeo, with its coverage for the team. Choice Scarf users like Ditto and Braviary are excellent partners because they can revenge kill threats like Hydreigon and Keldeo, respectively. In return, Obstagoon deals with the likes of Toxapex and Aegislash for them. Lastly, Snorlax appreciates Obstagoon's capability to take on the aforementioned walls to sweep late-game with its Curse set.</p>"

Earthquake is a great STAB move that prevents Runerigus from being too passive. Will-O-Wisp allows Runerigus to threaten physical attackers such as Grimmsnarl and Dracozolt. Memento is an option for Runerigus to give teammates such as Polteageist and Mimikyu an opportunity to set up freely. Maximum HP investment and maximum Defensive investment allows Runerigus to check physical attackers such as Mimikyu and Excadrill and gives it the opportunity to set up entry hazards against them.</p> <p>Froslass is a great partner for Runerigus, as together they form an entry hazard-stacking core versus the opponent. Offensive teammates such as Gengar, Mimikyu, Aegislash, and Dragapult all appreciate Runerigus being able to set Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, as it wears the opposing Pokemon down for them.

In the same vein, Hatterene defeats bulky Dark-types Indeedee-M has trouble against, namely Tyranitar. Indeedee-M also falls short of OHKOing defensive threats like Hippowdon and Seismitoad, so entry hazard support from the likes of Bronzong and Mew is essential. Gallade's part-Fighting typing enables it to take on certain Steel- and Dark-types that are troublesome for Indeedee-M to deal with.

Dragon Claw is used to hit Dragon-type Pokemon and Pokemon that resist or are immune to Bolt Beak, such as Grass-type Pokemon and Seismitoad. Outrage can be used along with Dragon Claw, as it has more base power but locks Dracozolt. Earthquake can be used as an alternative move to deal with Pokemon like Excadrill outside of sand and Aegislash. Fire Fang helps with Steel-type Pokemon that resists Bolt Beak, such as Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Vikavolt is a fantastic teammate, as it can set up Sticky Web for Dracozolt.

Vikavolt also carries Grass-type coverage in Energy Ball, which is useful to break past common walls Dracozolt struggles against, such as Hippowdon and Seismitoad. The slow Volt Switch from Vikavolt also helps Dracozolt to come in safely to the field. Toxtricity forms an excellent offensive core with Dracozolt, as it can severely weaken the opposing team with a Choice Specs set and its Sludge Wave can handle Fairy- and Grass-types. Pincurchin provides a handful of utility options to Dracozolt. It can set up Electric Terrain, which boosts the power of Bolt Beak even further.

Morpeko can form an offensive core with Dracozolt while providing utility options such as Parting Shot and Rapid Spin. Its access to Seed Bomb allows it to break past Ground-type Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad, Parting Shot can be used to pivot while reducing offensive stats of opposing Pokemon, and Rapid Spin removes entry hazards to prevent getting Dracozolt crippled.</p>"

Hydreigon can also take advantage of Duraludon's ability to spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, letting Hydreigon paraflinch defensive walls such as Toxapex and Galarian Slowking with Dark Pulse.

Froslass is a useful partner for Dragapult because of its ability to set Spikes, allowing it to wallbreak more efficiently, and its ability to deny opposing hazards with Taunt.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Using its already high Speed stat coupled with Choice Scarf, Dragapult is an incredible revenge killer on Ghost teams that can reliably outspeed and check a variety of fast threats such as Choice Scarf Gengar, Excadrill under sand, and Choice Scarf Charizard. Draco Meteor is Dragapult's strongest attack that hits a variety of neutral targets hard while also being particularly useful for beating Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Duraludon, and Hydreigon. Shadow Ball hits Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Gengar, Mimikyu, Gardevoir, and Hatterene for super effective damage, making Dragapult great in the Ghost mirror matchup in particular. Fire Blast allows Dragapult to revenge kill Steel-, Ice-, and Grass-type Pokemon such as Excadrill, Weavile, and Venusaur with more ease. U-turn is amazing for grabbing momentum against forced switches or against bulky Pokemon such as Corviknight, Snorlax, Tyranitar, and Toxapex that give Dragapult trouble. Infiltrator is the preferred ability, as it allows Dragapult to revenge kill Substitute users such as Kyurem-B and Hydreigon effectively as well as ignoring Aurora Veil and dual screens from Pokemon such as Alolan Ninetales and Grimmsnarl, allowing Dragapult to revenge kill Pokemon with more ease on their respective types. 4 EVs in Defense ensure that it never gets OHKOed by Jolly Cloyster's +2 Ice Shard.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola is an excellent teammate because of its ability to set Stealth Rock as well as serve as a defensive pivot for Dragapult. Stealth Rock is particularly good for putting Pokemon such as Weavile, Choice Scarf Charizard, Alolan Ninetales, and Chandelure in range of Dragapult's attacks as well as breaking Focus Sash against Pokemon such as Cloyster and Dugtrio. Chandelure is a good partner for Dragapult because of its ability to break down bulkier Steel-type Pokemon such as Aegislash and Corviknight with its strong Fire STAB attacks as well as use Substitute to take on Sucker Punch users such as Bisharp and Shiftry. Choice Specs Gengar and Aegislash are both wallbreakers that can beat bulky Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Toxapex as well as take on Fairy-types like Togekiss and Clefable for Dragapult. Swords Dance Aegislash can also beat Pokemon like Tyranitar and Snorlax for Dragapult. Mimikyu and Dragapult work together to take on Dragon teams effectively with their super effective coverage while Mimikyu can also beat Dark-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Mandibuzz for it. Froslass is a decent teammate on hyper offensive teams because of its ability to use Taunt on Sticky Web setters such as Galvantula and Araquanid that hinder Dragapult's revenge killing capabilities as well as use Spikes to continuously wear down teams in conjunction with Dragapult's ability to force switches and grab momentum with U-turn.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Dragapult is a fantastic setup sweeper that takes advantage of its high natural Speed, outspeeding all of the unboosted metagame after a single turn, which makes it not only tricky to wall but also much harder to effectively revenge kill. Dragon Dance allows Dragapult to OHKO threats such as Diggersby and Zeraora and 2HKO Toxapex with Dragon Darts after a single boost as well as outspeed Adamant Excadrill in sand and Kingdra in the rain, and after using Dragon Dance twice, it can outspeed Hawlucha after Unburden. Dragon Darts is its main STAB attack and can severely dent any Pokemon that does not resist it. Phantom Force hits Pokemon that resist Dragon Darts such as Excadrill and Hatterene. Substitute allows Dragapult to avoid status moves from Pokemon such as Toxapex and grants it more opportunities to set up Dragon Dance. Sucker Punch can be used to gain an advantage over opposing Dragon Dance Dragapult and attack before Cinderace's Sucker Punch, Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, and Rillaboom's Grassy Slide. Dragon Fang notably allows Dragon Darts to OHKO offensive Volcarona, but Leftovers is an option that gives Dragapult more opportunities to set up Substitute. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs alongside an Adamant nature allow Dragapult to move as fast and strike hard. 4 Defense EVs allow it to always survive +2 Jolly Cloyster's Ice Shard.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola is the best partner Dragon Dance Dragapult can ask for many reasons; the first is its ability to set Stealth Rock up, allowing Dragapult to serve as a setup sweeper more effectively. It can also cripple physical attackers such as Tapu Bulu with Will-O-Wisp alongside Strength Sap, potentially provide Dragapult free turns to set up Dragon Dance through Cursed Body, and serve as a general physical pivot into Pokemon such as Cinderace for Dragapult. Mimikyu forms a physical setup core with Dragapult, as it can take on Dark- and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Bisharp, Urshifu-R, and Terrakion for Dragapult with its STAB and coverage moves in Play Rough and Drain Punch as well as revenge kill Pokemon such as Hatterene under Trick Room thanks to its ability Disguise. Aegislash provides a specially defensive wall that can pivot into Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type attacks such as Duraludon's Draco Meteor, Primarina's Moonblast, and Avalugg's Avalanche thanks to its Steel typing. It can also act as a Choice Specs wallbreaker or physical setup sweeper, allowing it to take on Pokemon like Corviknight and Chansey for Dragapult. Dragapult appreciates Choice Specs Gengar's ability to punch holes in walls such as Mandibuzz, Galarian Weezing, Skarmory, and Tyranitar with its coverage moves. Choice Scarf Gengar, on the other hand, can act as a revenge killer against Pokemon such as Zeraora for unboosted Dragapult. Jellicent can, like Galarian Corsola, cripple physical walls with Strength Sap and Will-O-Wisp while also preventing slower Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex from setting entry hazards with Taunt. Alolan Marowak and Chandelure most simply can break through Steel-type Pokemon for Dragapult. Substitute Chandelure, in particular, can take on Pokemon, such as Bisharp, while Alolan Marowak is a strong Swords Dance attacker able to soften physically defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Braviary for Dragapult to sweep more easily.</p>"

    "overview": "<h3>Water</h3> <p>Urshifu-R is a great wallbreaker for Water teams thanks to its excellent Attack as well as Surging Strikes and Close Combat. Surging Strikes in particular allows Urshifu-R to hit through Defense boosts from Magnezone and Mimikyu's Disguise. Unseen Fist allows Urshifu-R to prevent opposing Pokemon from scouting what move it will use. This allows it to break through types like Steel, where Aegislash and Ferrothorn cannot use Protect and see whether Urshifu-R will use Close Combat or Surging Strikes. It also has moves like U-turn to pivot and Thunder Punch to hit Pokemon that resist both of its STAB moves, like Mantine and Pelipper. However, Urshifu-R has an average Speed tier and is unable to outspeed threats like Zapdos and Zarude. This means Urshifu-R sees competition from Keldeo, which is able to outspeed and dent these Pokemon. Its mediocre Speed doesn't hinder its wallbreaking power, though. Pokemon like Rocky Helmet Skarmory and Iron Barbs Ferrothorn can also punish Urshifu-R for using Surging Strikes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p>Choice Scarf can be used over Choice Band, allowing Urshifu-R to be a solid revenge killer and outspeed Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Zarude, but it takes away Urshifu-R's damage output. Urshifu-R can also run coverage moves like Ice Punch, which hits Dragon-types like Dragonite and Dragalge, and Poison Jab, which hits Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu. However, this usually comes at the cost of Urshifu-R dropping a more important move like U-turn or Aqua Jet. Bulk Up can be used to prevent Urshifu-R from being Choice-locked, but it forces Urshifu-R to use up a turn and drop Aqua Jet or Thunder Punch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Water</h4> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn reduces Urshifu-R's power, paralysis lowers its speed and lets more threats outspeed and KO it, and Toxic decreases Urshifu-R's wallbreaking turns.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Slowbro, Galarian Corsola, Amoonguss, and Toxapex take very little from Urshifu-R's STAB moves and can punish it in return with status.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Thundurus-T outspeed and OHKO Urshifu-R with a super effective move.</p> <p><strong>Contact Damage</strong>: Pokemon that punish contact moves like Skarmory and Ferrothorn are annoying for Urshifu-R to deal with, as Surging Strikes forces it to take a lot of chip damage when hitting these targets.</p>",

Surging Strikes hits Pokemon Close Combat can't dent, like Landorus-T, Aegislash, and Galarian Slowking. It also allows Urshifu-R to break Pokemon that can boost their Defense, like Iron Defense Corviknight, and break Shuckle's Sturdy, which lets Urshifu-R KO it before it sets any entry hazards. Aqua Jet allows Urshifu-R to pick off weakened foes or revenge kill faster Pokemon like Volcarona and Alolan Raichu. U-turn is nice for keeping momentum against foes like Celebi and Slowbro, which tank Urshifu-R's other moves. Thunder Punch hits Mantine, Pelipper, and other Water-types. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Urshifu-R to outspeed Pokemon like Mimikyu, Tapu Lele, and Kyurem.</p> <p>Urshifu-R greatly appreciates defensive pivots to absorb hits for it and bring it in safely. Slowking in particular is a great pivot, with Teleport and Future Sight to assist Urshifu-R. Teleport allows Slowking to bring Urshifu-R in safely, and Future Sight allows Urshifu-R to force progress in the Poison and Water matchups. Urshifu-R helps Slowking by checking threats like Kyurem and Weavile. Pelipper sets rain for Urshifu-R, allowing Surging Strikes to OHKO Pokemon like Aegislash and Clefable. Pelipper can also provide Defog and clear entry hazards like Spikes and Sticky Web, which limit Urshifu-R's chances to come in. Swampert and Gastrodon provide switch-ins to attacks from foes like Tapu Koko and Alolan Raichu with their Electric immunities; Swampert also sets Stealth Rock. Tapu Fini sets Misty Terrain for Urshifu-R, preventing it from getting statused, and also revenge kills Pokemon like Hydreigon and Garchomp with Choice Scarf. Rotom-W deserves a special mention as a Choice Scarf user, being able to check threats like Thundurus-T and Zapdos. Wallbreakers like Crawdaunt pressure checks to Urshifu-R like Slowbro and Toxapex. Crawdaunt especially can help in the Psychic matchup with its Psychic immunity. Other Knock Off users like Toxapex are incredibly helpful to remove opposing Leftovers and Rocky Helmet. On a weatherless team, it is a good idea to use another wallbreaker like Volcanion that can beat Steel-types, since Urshifu-R has a lot more trouble OHKOing Pokemon like Aegislash without rain.</p>"

Thanks to this, it can be useful in matchups such as Water, Ground, and Rock. Jungle Healing and Taunt make Zarude a formidable stallbreaker as well, allowing it to use foes that rely on status ailments to wear it down such as Toxapex, Slowking, Slowbro, and Gastrodon as setup fodder while preventing them from using status moves like Recover and Haze. However, Zarude's Grass typing brings it many weaknesses, leaving it particularly weak to Pokemon like Blacephalon, Victini, and Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan. It also heavily struggles in matchups like Steel and Fire, as it mainly relies on Power Whip to deal damage. Its Speed tier is good, but not fast enough to outspeed many prominent fast attackers such as Tapu Koko, Dragapult, Weavile, and Cinderace, making it vulnerable to being revenge killed by them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p>(Bulk Up) Choice Band significantly increases Zarude's damage output, giving it the means of 2HKOing Toxapex with Power Whip and specially defensive Celesteela with Darkest Lariat.

A Choice Band set may also be considered, as it allows Zarude to terrorize slower teams such as rainless Water, Fairy, and sandless Ground teams, with the boost from Choice Band letting it threaten Toxapex, Tapu Bulu, and Landorus-T.</p> <h4>Grass</h4> <p>Rock Slide may be used over Power Whip in Choice Scarf sets to revenge kill Volcarona after a Quiver Dance boost, as well as dealing more damage to Flying-types like Dragonite, Zapdos, and Galarian Moltres, but Power Whip allows Zarude to pick off weakened threats like Clefable and OHKO Tapu Lele after Stealth Rock damage. Roseli Berry or Chople Berry can be considered in Bulk Up sets to survive a Fairy- or Fighting-type lure move and remove threats such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Zeraora, and opposing Zarude, but the lack of Leftovers hurts Zarude's ability to set up consistently. Substitute may also be used over Jungle Healing, as it also allows Zarude to avoid status, but it reduces Zarude's longevity and ability to set up multiple times in a match.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Zarude struggles to deal great damage to physically defensive walls such as Skarmory, Galarian Weezing, and Porygon2. In return, Skarmory is able to heal off its attacks with Roost and phaze it with Whirlwind, Galarian Weezing can weaken it with Strange Stream, and Porygon2 can weaken it with Ice Beam and use Teleport to bring in another teammate if Zarude switches out.</p> <p><strong>Grass-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that resist Zarude's Power Whip such as Victini, Torkoal, and Buzzwole all threaten Zarude with their STAB moves while it struggles to deal massive damage to them. However, some foes that resist Power Whip such as Bisharp, Kyurem, and Hydreigon can all be hit super effectively by Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Celesteela and Mandibuzz take minimal damage from Zarude's attacks and threaten to chip it down.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Blacephalon, Choice Scarf Weavile, and Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos outspeed Zarude and OHKO it with a super effective move.

Taunt shuts down passive foes such as Galarian Corsola and Toxapex by preventing them from using status moves like Strength Sap and Haze. Drain Punch is an alternative over Taunt, hitting Steel- and Dragon-types like Bisharp, Kyurem, and Hydreigon super effectively. Jungle Healing gets rid of status ailments such as burn and Toxic poison while providing Zarude with useful longevity. Chople Berry enables Zarude to survive Fighting-type attacks from many threats such as Choice Scarf Terrakion, Keldeo, and Barraskewda and KO them back with Power Whip.

Tyranitar's amazing special bulk coupled with Sand Stream allows it to take on threatening special attackers such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Blacephalon, and Alolan Ninetales. Its Sand Stream and Toxic support can also wear down foes quickly, which Zarude appreciates. Hydreigon is a mandatory wallbreaker for Zarude, as it's able to pressure many physically defensive walls such as Skarmory, Avalugg, and Bewear that give Zarude and the rest of Dark teams trouble. It can also pressure Dragon- and Fire-types such as Dragalge, Kyurem, and Torkoal for Zarude. Drapion can deal with Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu, Clefable, and Alolan Ninetales, which Zarude finds difficult to beat, and provide Toxic Spikes support. Weavile is also a neat revenge killer for Zarude thanks to its Ice typing, taking out Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Dragonite, and Latias while picking off weakened foes like Tapu Koko with Ice Shard.

It does well against types like Fighting, Dark, Psychic, and Ghost that have trouble taking on Electric-type attacks. However, Regieleki suffers from having a very sparse movepool that does not include proper coverage moves to hit Ground-types for decent damage and, as a result, is left walled by Ground-type Pokemon. This forces the Regieleki user to think twice before attacking, since a Ground-type Pokemon could switch into it for free. It also has a horrendous bulk, which makes it prone to being KOed by any decent offensive Pokemon, especially priority users such as Bisharp, Dragonite, Rillaboom, and Crawdaunt.

        "description": "<p>Glastrier is a niche wallbreaker on Ice teams thanks to its natural bulk, good matchup against Poison-types and threats like Celesteela, and monstrous Attack. However, it faces serious competition from Arctozolt and Galarian Darmanitan due to its abysmal Speed and inability to wallbreak efficiently without setup. Substitute eases predictions for Glastrier, makes it immune to status from slower Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, and lets it use passive Pokemon like Pelipper and Celesteela as setup fodder. Icicle Crash and High Horsepower have great coverage against most defensive cores, with the latter providing crucial coverage against opposing Steel- and Fire-types like Klefki and Torkoal. The given EV spread outpaces Celesteela while retaining as much bulk as possible.</p> <p>Teammates like Kyurem appreciate Glastrier dealing with or weakening walls such as Galarian Slowking, Celesteela, and Tyranitar. In return, Kyurem breaks past physically defensive walls such as Slowbro and Rotom-W. Alolan Ninetales is an excellent teammate that provides extra setup opportunities with Aurora Veil and deals with Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Kommo-o. With Bolt Beak and Freeze-Dry, Arctozolt pressures common Glastrier checks like Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Quagsire. Cloyster is an essential teammate for removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin; primarily Stealth Rock; and setting up Spikes. Fast teammates like Choice Scarf Galarian Darmanitan and Weavile can check foes like Zeraora, Victini, and Blacephalon for Glastrier. Additionally, Weavile can clean up types such as Flying late-game once Celesteela has been worn down or eliminated. Mamoswine threatens Steel- and Fire-types like Heatran, Volcanion, and Aegislash and can revenge kill Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Dragapult with Ice Shard. Piloswine provides Stealth Rock support and puts Rotom-W on a timer with Toxic while dealing with the likes of Tapu Koko, Regieleki, and Alolan Raichu.</p>"

  "Spectrier": {
    "overview": "<h3>Ghost</h3> <p>Spectrier is a dangerous special attacker that can quickly snowball teams thanks to its higher Speed than Pokemon like Garchomp and Keldeo, its access to Calm Mind to set up on and become resilient to the likes of Tapu Fini and Zapdos, a great ability in Grim Neigh, and its Ghost-type attacks hitting most Pokemon for neutral or super effective damage. Spectrier can also take advantage of Water and Ground teams, which lack good switch-ins to Will-O-Wisp + Hex. It can use passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Slowking, and Slowbro to set up with Substitute + Calm Mind, and it has good utility in Will-O-Wisp, which can force out physical attackers such as Garchomp and walls like Celesteela. However, Spectrier has very limited coverage, which makes it unable to take on Dark- and Normal-types such as Tyranitar and Porygon2. It also can get revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Excadrill along with fast Pokemon such as Regieleki and Dragapult.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ghost</h4> <p>Choice Specs can be used to make Spectrier a fearsome special attacker to anything that does not resist its moves, but it cannot utilize Substitute or Calm Mind to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Toxapex. Nasty Plot with Metronome can turn Spectrier into a fearsome sweeper much faster, which helps it beat walls like Mantine, Zapdos, and Toxapex, but it cannot set up on special attackers like Tapu Fini more consistently without Calm Mind.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <h4>Ghost</h4> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Spectrier cannot do much against Normal-types such as Blissey, Porygon2, and Obstagoon.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Zarude, and Mandibuzz easily take Spectrier's Hex. However, Mandibuzz can be somewhat hindered by Will-O-Wisp weakening Foul Play or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Naturally faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Regieleki, and Dragapult as well as Choice Scarf users such as Excadrill and Landorus-T can OHKO or 2HKO unboosted Spectrier with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes quickly wear Spectrier down. They are especially problematic due to Ghost not having reliable entry hazard control.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic and Will-O-Wisp easily wear Spectrier down, while Thunder Wave makes it unable to outpace Pokemon like Jirachi and Gengar.</p>",

      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Spectrier can set up forced switches from slower Pokemon such as Urshifu-R and Garchomp and on walls like Celesteela and Ferrothorn with ease due to Substitute and Will-O-Wisp. Substitute blocks status from Pokemon like Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Heatran as well as Leech Seed from Celesteela and Ferrothorn, and is very good to use on predicted switches against Pokemon that fear Will-O-Wisp like Garchomp and Dragonite. Will-O-Wisp is primarily used on physical attackers such as Mamoswine, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu, but it can be useful together with Hex to 2HKO walls such as Celesteela, Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Swampert. It also allows Spectrier to set up Substitute against defensive Tornadus-T's Knock Off and Mandibuzz's Foul Play. Hex goes well with Will-O-Wisp, as the combination allows Spectrier to beat bulky Pokemon like Celesteela and fast physical attackers such as Terrakion, Urshifu-R, and Garchomp. 52 HP EVs and 200 Defense EVs allow Spectrier to keep its Substitute up against burned Celesteela and Ferrothorn.</p> <p>Galarian Corsola can switch into strong physical attacks from Pokemon like Barraskewda, Choice Scarf Terrakion, and Choice Scarf Excadrill. It can also provide Spectrier with Stealth Rock, Will-O-Wisp, and Cursed Body support, making it easier to sweep. Dragon Dance Dragapult is a great setup sweeper against Dragon and Electric type teams. Dragapult also helps with Pokemon that Spectrier has trouble against like Hydreigon and Zeraora, while Spectrier can take down troublesome walls for Dragapult like Toxapex, Avalugg, and Celesteela. Mimikyu is essential for using its Disguise to beat Dark- and Ghost-types such as Hydreigon, Tyranitar, Zarude, and opposing Dragapult. Mimikyu's Drain Punch can also help take care of Dark- and Normal-types like Bisharp, Obstagoon, and Diggersby. Choice Scarf Blacephalon checks Pokemon like Excadrill, Zarude, and Choice Band Weavile. Gengar is very useful in threatening troublesome Dark-types like Tyranitar and Hydreigon with Focus Blast, Mandibuzz with Thunderbolt, and Grimmsnarl with Sludge Wave. It can also remove Toxic Spikes thanks to its part-Poison typing. Aegislash can use Swords Dance to beat the defensive backbone of Blissey and Porygon2 on Normal teams. SubToxic Aegislash can hinder walls such as Mantine and Zapdos, and Hex Spectrier greatly benefits from Aegislash using Toxic to inflict status onto opposing Pokemon. Its part-Steel typing is also useful against Alolan Ninetales, Rillaboom, and Tapu Lele. Albeit uncommon, Jellicent is a great answer to Kingdra's attacks that Spectrier has trouble taking on.</p>"
