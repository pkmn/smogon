  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar is a solid Ghost / Poison type Pokemon that can fill many roles, including supporter, sweeper, and Perish Song user. Gengar's unique typing and ability give it immunities to the common Normal-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves. Because of this, Gengar is also one of the best Mega Kangaskhan counters that you can ask for, as it is immune to most of Mega Kangaskhan's attacks and is able to burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Shadow Tag is able to trap Pokemon, allowing Mega Gengar to throw off your opponent's game plan and put them in dire positions for you to take advantage of. Mega Gengar is also able to snipe specific Pokemon and remove them to pave the way for the rest of your team. However, Gengar is rather frail and cannot be played recklessly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sludge Wave can be used, but it's weaker than Sludge Bomb when the spread damage nerf is considered. Icy Wind offers speed control, but it must be used carefully so as to not trigger Pokemon with Defiant or Competitive. Destiny Bond is a neat tool for getting a free KO or coaxing the opponent into not attacking Gengar, which gives it a chance for a free attack. Taunt is a good move in general for shutting down sketchy tactics, but it struggles to find a slot, as all of Gengar's main moves are more important. Focus Blast can be used to get a huge surprise hit on unsuspecting Dark- and Steel-types, but the shaky accuracy makes it not worth it. Hypnosis can be an option, as Gengar really enjoys having free turns, but it's generally not worth the moveslot. Life Orb is a solid item if you want Gengar to deal more damage. Trick Room is another option, as it's hardly expected on Gengar, but there are better Trick Room users out there such as Cresselia and Jellicent.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: While Gengar has options against Dark-types, they generally do well against it. Bisharp, Hydreigon, Tyranitar, and Weavile can all deal massive damage to Gengar even after being burned.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash: Aegislash can withstand a Shadow Ball and KO Gengar with the combination of Shadow Ball and Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Various forms of speed control such as Thunder Wave, Icy Wind, Trick Room, and Tailwind from the opponent can greatly threaten Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Because Gengar is mainly used as a check to physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, special attackers are usually able to muscle through it.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball is Gengar's main STAB move and deals respectable damage to most Pokemon, especially Aegislash. Sludge Bomb is used to deal massive damage to Grass- and Fairy-types. Icy Wind, however, can be helpful for providing speed control for your team as well as 2HKOing Landorus-T and Mega Salamence. Will-O-Wisp allows Gengar to cripple most physical attackers and completely shut down Mega Kangaskhan. Protect allows Gengar to survive an extra turn. Taunt is good for shutting down non-attacking moves, but Gengar usually doesn't last long enough to do it more than once.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given spread allows Gengar to hit as hard as possible while also outspeeding most threats in Battle Spot Doubles, such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Kangaskhan, and Terrakion. Focus Sash allows Gengar to survive an extra turn to get off another move. Life Orb can also be used if you want more offensive pressure, as it allows Gengar to KO threats such as Latios, Azumarill, and Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set works best as a lead to immediately start firing off its STAB moves or spreading burns around. Try to play safe around a Kangaskhan that has not Mega Evolved yet, as it can break Gengar's Focus Sash with a Scrappy Fake Out. Even with maximum Special Attack investment, Gengar is still not that strong, so don't expect it to get OHKOs against bulkier Pokemon or Pokemon not weak to its attacks. If you're using Icy Wind, use it carefully, as you wouldn't want to invite in Pokemon with Defiant or Competitive.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Terrakion appreciates having Ghost- and Fairy-types weakened as well as the opposing team being slowed down by Icy Wind. Terrakion also destroys most Dark-types that Gengar has issues with. Kangaskhan is another solid partner, as it can grant Gengar a free turn with Fake Out to attack or burn a target. Gengar can help out Kangaskhan in return by burning Fighting-types. Clefable can redirect Dark-type moves and keep Gengar completely safe from Sucker Punch, and it appreciates having targets burned.</p>"

Sludge Bomb allows Mega Gengar to deal massive damage to any Fairy- and Grass-types it traps. Will-O-Wisp is excellent for burning physical attackers and rendering them trapped and completely useless. Disable can be used over Will-O-Wisp if you plan on utilizing the Encore + Disable strategy. Protect lets Gengar safely Mega Evolve to get the Speed boost.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Mega Gengar to tank a -1 Earthquake from Adamant Landorus-T or a Heat Wave from Modest Mega Charizard Y. Gengarite allows Mega Gengar to trap Pokemon that it has a favorable matchup against and take them out. If you don't want the extra bulk, then 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe can be used just fine.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gengar is able to trap and appropriately deal with foes to support its team. Try to Mega Evolve Gengar as soon as possible to get the most out of its trapping ability. Don't leave Mega Gengar against two Pokemon that can easily OHKO it, because its partner cannot handle both threats at once. Bring in Mega Gengar against Pokemon that can't do too much damage to it, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Sylveon, so that it can trap them and give its partner an easier time. If you're using the Disable + Encore strategy, make sure to Disable a move that Mega Gengar doesn't mind too much and then Encore the move right afterwards. This leaves the opponent with nothing else to do but Struggle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Liepard is an excellent partner to Mega Gengar, as it can Fake Out a target and give Gengar a free turn to Mega Evolve. It can also Encore a Pokemon into a move so that Gengar can Disable it. Liepard can also use Fake Tears to allow Mega Gengar to get some clutch OHKOs, such as on Cresselia, bulky Thundurus, and 4 HP / 0 SpD Mega Kangaskhan. Whimsicott can do the same thing as Liepard and has better defensive typing with more bulk, but it lacks Fake Out. Terrakion is a solid partner for Mega Gengar, as it is able to OHKO the Dark-types that Gengar has issues with, such as Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Tyranitar. Terrakion also appreciates Mega Gengar being able to trap and KO Grass-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types.</p>"

        "name": "Perish Trap",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball is notable for punishing Ghost-types that try to disrupt the Perish trap by switching out. Perish Song allows Mega Gengar to KO both of your opponent's Pokemon at once while Mega Gengar and its partner switch out. Substitute helps stall out Perish Song turns. Disable can be viable for disabling moves that could potentially knock out Mega Gengar and ruin the Perish trap. Protect is crucial for keeping Mega Gengar from being double targeted and KOed as it stalls out Perish Song turns.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread is designed to make Mega Gengar as bulky as possible. 252 HP and 28 Defense EVs allow Mega Gengar to stomach a Double-Edge from 4 Atk mixed Mega Salamence. The Speed EVs give non-Mega Gengar the jump on maximum Speed base 105 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Pinsir and Mienshao, before Mega Evolving and let it outspeed Weavile after Mega Evolving. The 4 SpA and 4 SpD are leftover EVs that increase Gengar's durability and power by a tiny bit. Gengarite allows Mega Gengar to fully function as a Perish Song trapper.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to Mega Evolve Gengar as soon as possible to get the most out of its trapping ability. Make sure to Perish Song as soon as possible and then work to preserve Mega Gengar from taking serious damage. Having a secondary Shadow Tag Pokemon such as Gothitelle is essential, as it allows Mega Gengar to switch out while still having the opponent's Pokemon trapped as Gothitelle comes in. Make sure to KO any Ghost-types that the opponent has brought whenever possible, as they can switch out of Shadow Tag. Switch out Mega Gengar on the last turn of the Perish Song countdown so that it can come back and Perish Song again safely. If you have a healthy Perish Song user in the back, don't feel obligated to keep Mega Gengar around after the opponent's first two Pokemon have fainted.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gothitelle is a staple on Perish trap teams, as it is able to trap Pokemon alongside Mega Gengar. It is also able to set up Reflect or Light Screen to buff Mega Gengar's defenses. Politoed is also a good partner, as it is able to Perish Song the remaining Pokemon on the opponent's team, after Mega Gengar has already trapped and KOed two Pokemon. Politoed can also utilize Encore and Scald to mess with the opposing team. Scrafty's Intimidate helps Mega Gengar tank hits, and Scrafty can use Fake Out to allow for free Perish Songs. Amoonguss is also a good partner for Mega Gengar on Perish trap teams, as it can provide free turns with Spore. Another notable aspect about Amoonguss is that it being a slow Pokemon means that it will faint last if everything on the field faints to Perish Song, giving you the victory. Other redirection support Pokemon such as Clefable and Togekiss are also usable to keep Mega Gengar and other Shadow Tag Pokemon alive.</p>"

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>On paper, it can seem as though there is no reason to use Raikou over Mega Manectric, which has higher Special Attack and Speed, Fire-type coverage, and Intimidate. However, Raikou has more special bulk, allows the use of another Mega Pokemon, has access to Light Screen and Reflect, and is a better user of Snarl, which Mega Manectric struggles to fit it onto its moveset. Raikou, on the other hand, has a slot free for coverage moves or Snarl and has more special bulk to survive hits so it can keep on using Snarl. Although Mega Manectric has a higher Speed, Raikou's base Speed of 115 is still incredible, outspeeding other popular Electric-types such as Zapdos and Thundurus. Unlike the latter two, however, Raikou has a weakness to Ground, which is not helped by the extreme popularity of Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although it is not commonly seen in Battle Spot Doubles, Raikou has access to the combination of Light Screen and Reflect, which, combined with Light Clay, makes for a decent support set. If more power than Life Orb can provide is wanted, Choice Specs is the way to go; however, it locks Raikou into a move and makes Raikou unable to use Protect. Volt Switch is best used on Assault Vest or Choice Specs sets because it can take over the moveslot that could have been used for Protect, and it lets Raikou deal some nice chip damage and gain momentum. If you are using Raikou on a rain team, Thunder can be considered as its STAB attack, offering more power than Thunderbolt. Shuca Berry lets Raikou survive most Ground-type moves and brings an element of surprise. If you want extra power but don't want the drawbacks from other boosting items such as Choice Specs and Life Orb, Expert Belt is an option. To make Raikou an even better special tank, Assault Vest can work, but similarly to Choice Specs, it disallows Protect. Magnet Rise is a niche option to allow Raikou to avoid all Ground-type moves. If you are looking for more of a tank variant of Raikou, Rocky Helmet is an option to punish physical attackers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Physical Attackers</strong>: Hard-hitting physical attackers with solid bulk can soak up Raikou's STAB moves and OHKO or 2HKO it with powerful STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types with Earthquake such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Garchomp can OHKO Raikou and are immune to Thunderbolt. However, Landorus-T and Garchomp struggle with Shuca Berry variants after taking a bit of prior damage.</p>",

Hidden Power Ice lets Raikou OHKO or do massive damage to Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Garchomp. Extrasensory gives Raikou coverage for Poison- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss and Conkeldurr. Snarl lets Raikou reduce special attackers' damage output. Shadow Ball hits Ghost- and Psychic-types for super effective damage. Protect allows Raikou to avoid powerful attacks, such as Earthquake, and double targeting.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb allows Raikou to hit as hard as possible without locking it into a move and to get crucial OHKOs with Hidden Power Ice on Mega Salamence and Garchomp, which it would not have gotten without a boosting item. A simple spread maximizing Special Attack and Speed is preferred, as Raikou wants to hit as hard and as fast as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When you are using Raikou, you often have it for a specific role: getting rid of Water-types or lowering special attackers' damage output. As Raikou is quite easily KOed by powerful attacks, you must remember to keep Raikou around until it has done its job. There are a couple of things you must keep in mind when using Snarl on Raikou. If you see a Competitive or Defiant user such as Milotic or Bisharp, you must avoid using Snarl until they are gone or you know your opponent did not bring them. You should also mostly use Snarl when your opponent has powerful special attackers on the field, as it does not do a lot of damage and you must be sure that it is worth it to lower the foes' Special Attack stats over dealing damage with a STAB move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>In order to pressure foes not to use Earthquake, Pokemon immune to Ground work well as partners for Raikou. In addition, Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Swampert are also good to avoid Earthquake. Because Raikou is very good at getting rid of Water-types, Pokemon that appreciate their absence such as Mega Salamence, Heatran, and Landorus-T are good on teams with Raikou. To let Raikou survive more physical attacks, Pokemon with Intimidate or Will-O-Wisp are solid partners. Some good Intimidate users include Scrafty and Landorus-T, while Gengar and Rotom-H are good at providing Will-O-Wisp support.</p>"

With defensive stats of 115 / 85 / 75, Entei has solid bulk, with very few moves being able to OHKO it. Entei's Fire typing provides it a resistance to Fairy, but makes it weak to some of the most common types such as Ground, Rock, and Water. Entei suffers from a very shallow movepool, especially with the loss of Extreme Speed and Flare Blitz in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame, making it very predictable, while its rival, Arcanine, is unpredictable because it has a better movepool. However, Entei does have a solid Speed tier, having base 100 Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bulldoze is an option on Entei, as it provides speed control. However, Bulldoze also hits Entei's partner, making it only good with teammates that are immune to Ground-type moves. Running a Choice Band is mostly used for spamming powerful Sacred Fires, although it is not as good as it is in Singles. Substitute is an option over Protect, as it has a similar use and can be better than Protect in some situations, such as getting a free turn to set up Substitute.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Entei struggles against Water-types, as they resist its attack, Sacred Fire, and have super effective STAB attacks to hit Entei with. Facing a rain team makes everything worse, as Water-type attacks gain an additional boost, and Fire-type moves are weakened.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Ground-types</strong>: Entei is weak to Rock- and Ground-types, especially Landorus-T, Terrakion, and Garchomp, as they have access to Rock Slide and Earthquake, moves that Entei really doesn't want to get hit by. In addition, Landorus-T has Intimidate, and Terrakion and Garchomp often carry a Lum Berry, which makes an eventual burn against them useless.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Intimidate lowers Entei's Attack, which makes it lose offensive pressure, as it is unable to hit foes as hard as it would like.</p> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Heatran resists all of Entei's powerful attacks and often carries Earth Power, which hits Entei hard for super effective damage.</p>",

Stone Edge picks up KOs on Flying- and Fire-types, especially Talonflame and Charizard. Iron Head deals super effective damage to Fairy- and Rock-types such as Sylveon and Terrakion. Protect is a staple in Battle Spot Doubles, as it allows Entei to avoid taking hits it doesn't want to take.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs give Entei bulk to take hits better. 236 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature are used so that Entei can hit really hard. 20 Speed EVs make Entei peak a Speed stat of 123, letting it outspeed Adamant Bisharp, allowing Sacred Fire to secure an OHKO. Leftovers give Entei a form of recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Entei is very good at staying on the field, crippling foes by either Snarling special attackers or trying to burn physical attackers with Sacred Fire. Entei can easily deal a ton of damage thanks to its good base Attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entei works very well with Fake Out users, as they can make Entei's biggest threats flinch. A good Fake Out user is Scrafty. Meanwhile, Entei can go for either Snarl or Sacred Fire to neutralize the biggest threat on the other side of the field. Tailwind also helps Entei a lot, as outspeeding opposing Pokemon is always good. Entei has great synergy with Suicune, as it has access to Tailwind, allowing Entei to outspeed many threats. Suicune can also deal with Rock- and Ground-types that threaten Entei, which is a huge advantage. Entei can also form a bulky core with Fire-, Water-, and Grass-types, together with Pokemon like Suicune, Miltoic, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur.</p>"

If you find yourself struggling with Electric-type Pokemon in particular, Suicune can use a Wacan Berry to halve the damage from their super effective STAB moves.

Greninja's Special Attack is sufficient only when using super effective moves; its neutral attacks won't do much damage. It also loses pretty badly against speed control; Trick Room, Tailwind, and rain teams with Swift Swim sweepers destroy it pretty easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydro Pump is a strong Water-type move, though its imperfect accuracy is pretty annoying. Scald is often a better option due to its 100% accuracy and burn chance; it is still able to KO most of the Fire-type Pokemon that Hydro Pump does as well. Greninja can run Focus Sash instead of Life Orb to have more staying power, but it will lose a lot of power. Safety Goggles might be a useful item instead of Life Orb if redirectors are annoying to your team. Hidden Power Grass is a nice move to hit Water-type Pokemon such as Azumarill and Rotom-W, and it is better than Grass Knot in this case because Grass Knot doesn't do much damage to the lightweight Rotom-W. Choice Scarf can be used to make Greninja outspeed every Pokemon in Battle Spot Doubles. Expert Belt can be run to get a little damage boost without Life Orb recoil and to fake a Focus Sash. Rock Slide threatens Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Extrasensory could be considered to threaten Fighting-type Pokemon; the same goes for Hidden Power Fire for Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Scizor. Mat Block works pretty well alongside Focus Sash set, supporting Greninja's teammate by protecting it from any non-status move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Attackers: Pokemon such as Conkeldurr can bypass Greninja's Speed and easily KO it with priority moves such as Mach Punch, Fake Out, and Feint.

If you want to guarantee the OHKO on Azumarill with Gunk Shot, Greninja can run an EV spread of 20 Atk / 236 SpA / 252 Spe.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Greninja works pretty well as a lead, and it should use Protect to scout Choice Scarf users and avoid Fake Out when necessary. It also works as a late-game sweeper after your team has eliminated priority and Choice Scarf users. Greninja needs to deal lethal damage in order to trade positively with the opposing team, as its lack of bulk means that it can't afford to take any hits in return. It shouldn't be switched into anything other than very weak hits and Psychic-type attacks. Protean can be used defensively as well as offensively. It shouldn't be relied on, but it can be a tool in trading more effectively against foes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan is a great partner thanks to its access to Fake Out, which can bring threats into Greninja's KO range. Talonflame is able to threaten Fighting-type Pokemon, which usually run a priority move. Redirection support from Pokemon that can take hits for Greninja, such as Amoonguss and Togekiss, is very helpful. Chip damage from sand or hail is appreciated to help Greninja get KOs, and because Greninja is already frail, it does not mind taking residual damage itself. Abomasnow is therefore a pretty good partner, and Greninja can take advantage of a perfectly accurate Blizzard under hail as well. Tyranitar can set sand and deal with Talonflame, Greninja's main counter. Mega Charizard Y has great offensive synergy with Greninja, as Greninja deals with foes such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, while Mega Charizard Y handles Aegislash and other Steel-type Pokemon.</p>"

  "Gardevoir": {
    "overview": "<p>With access to Hyper Voice, Gardevoir has received new relevance in Battle Spot Doubles as a strong and powerful Mega Evolution with good typing and decent stats. With two excellent abilities in Trace and Telepathy, Gardevoir can use similar sets that can work very differently on completely separate teams, and it can work outside of its Mega forme, utilizing different strategies for each variation. Unfortunately, its base 65 Defense and base 68 HP make Gardevoir incredibly physically frail. But with the strongest Fairy-type move in the game and three excellent abilities, it can wreak havoc on teams unprepared for the dressed destroyer.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gardevoir has an immense amount of other options, allowing its moveslots to be adjusted to the needs of your team. Focus Blast is another very strong move in Gardevoir's arsenal that hits many of Gardevoir's checks such as Heatran super effectively, though it has 70% accuracy. Thunderbolt threatens Flying-type Pokemon such as Talonflame, which otherwise is a check to Gardevoir, and allows Gardevoir to be useful against weather teams, as it can Trace abilities such as Swift Swim to outspeed common sweepers and put offensive pressure on the opponent with Thunderbolt. Hidden Power Fire or Ground is Gardevoir's only access to Fire- or Ground-type coverage for the Steel-types that threaten it. However, because of Hidden Power's poor Base Power of 60, Moonblast and Hyper Voice hit neutral targets such as Bisharp harder, so only use it for foes that resist Fairy. Hidden Power Ground is preferred because of Scizor's lack of prevalence and allows Gardevoir to have a higher Speed IV, but it hits Ferrothorn neutrally instead of 4x super effectively. Icy Wind is an excellent spread move as well as a great support move, hitting Landorus-T harder than any of Gardevoir's other moves. It also grants Gardevoir the ability to control its foes' Speed, lessening the support job of the rest of the team and allowing Gardevoir and its teammates to create a better position against faster, more powerful threats.</p> <p>A support set of Heal Pulse / Helping Hand / Icy Wind / Safeguard or Misty Terrain with Telepathy allows Gardevoir to fill a powerful support role and, when paired with maximum HP and Defense investment, be a difficult Pokemon to KO. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple offensive threats, but its 85% accuracy is lackluster. Imprison is a niche move that, when used on Mega Gardevoir, cripples Sylveon, specially offensive Mega Salamence, and Mega Altaria; it also punishes any foe for using Protect. It can also be used on support sets either with Icy Wind to cripple Cresselia and rid the utility of Suicune, Gengar and Milotic or with Thunderbolt to reduce the viability of Rotom, especially Rotom-H. Trick is another interesting move used with the Choice sets to put otherwise difficult Pokemon into an uncomfortable situation. However, with the commonness of Mega Pokemon, it can often backfire and force Gardevoir into multiple Tricks before it works, which allows for easy exploitation, and many Pokemon benefit from the Speed boost that Choice Scarf gives. Memento can be used on the Choice Scarf set to instantly turn the tide of battle in situations where either Gardevoir would not deal enough damage or it is at low health, crippling the opposing Pokemon that could otherwise end the game and allowing for allied Pokemon to capitalize on or punish the switch-in.</p> <p>Life Orb allows for a utility in switching moves that Choice Specs cannot, as well as access to the coveted Protect. Though there are few to no key KOs it sacrifices, the loss of damage to neutral targets is noticeable, and the 10% HP penalty is a severe punishment to Gardevoir's longevity.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mawile and Heatran resist every move Gardevoir usually runs and will always KO Gardevoir with Iron Head and Flash Cannon, respectively. Pokemon with access to Bullet Punch such as Scizor and Lucario should be warranted extreme caution, as their power is usually enough to KO Gardevoir even before it accumulates a mass amount of damage. Bulkier Steel-types such as Metagross and Aegislash pose a similar problem if they dodge or survive the appropriate coverage move, and they always have a move to KO Gardevoir with. Slow Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Aggron have access to Gyro Ball, which will almost always KO Gardevoir with any Speed investment. The only Steel-types that are threatened by Gardevoir are Bisharp and Lucario, as their secondary type allows Gardevoir to hit them neutrally and neither of them can take more than one Hyper Voice, but they usually can knock Gardevoir out before a second one is used.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame: Gale Wings Brave Bird is the strongest priority move in the game, and even without Choice Band, it still deals a hefty amount and can potentially knock out Gardevoir. Its resistance to Fairy-type moves and Gardevoir's lack of coverage attacks leave Talonflame always on top one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types</strong>: Rotom-H, Arcanine, and Entei all resist Hyper Voice and have the bulk and power to hit back hard. Intimidate support and burns from Sacred Fire can cripple Gardevoir and its teammates, and Rotom-H can use its incredible typing and access to Volt Switch to keep the momentum on its side.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pixilate Hyper Voice has incredible power, being only marginally less powerful than Choice Specs Sylveon's Hyper Voice. Whether you should run Psychic or Psyshock depends on your team, as the former has a higher Base Power, but the latter deals physical damage, and many common switch-ins to Mega Gardevoir have lower Defense than Special Defense. Finally, Shadow Ball can be used to hit opposing Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Gothitelle hard, while Hidden Power Ground or Focus Blast can be used to deal with common Steel-type switch-ins such as Heatran, Metagross, and Ferrothorn. Protect is a staple move in Battle Spot Doubles, and it gives Gardevoir a free turn to Mega Evolve and shift its mediocre base 80 Speed to a more tolerable base 100 Speed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature maximize spread damage and allow Gardevoir to whittle down or knock out as many foes as possible as quickly as possible. With 20 Speed EVs, Mega Gardevoir outspeeds Bisharp and OHKOes it with Hyper Voice. 108 HP and 4 Special Defense EVs are enough so that Modest Gengar cannot OHKO Mega Gardevoir with Sludge Bomb or Shadow Ball. 124 Defense EVs increase Mega Gardevoir's physical bulk. However, the EVs can be put into Speed, and a spread of 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe could be considered to maximize Speed and power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As with all Mega Evolutions, Mega Gardevoir is best used as a sweeper instead of a lead, though using it as a lead can take the heat off of other, more frail sweepers that could always benefit from Mega Gardevoir weakening the opponent's team, such as Gengar or Weavile. Mega Gardevoir's poor Defense stat requires it caution next to Earthquake users, and the loss of Telepathy only maximizes this worry. Gardevoir should also be used after its checks, such as Metagross, Mawile, and Scizor, have already been dispatched of or at least weakened.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir adores Intimidate support and partners that beat Pokemon that resist Fairy. Arcanine has access to Intimidate, can threaten most Steel- and Bug-types, and can spread burns. Pokemon such as Volcarona and Amoonguss are just as helpful, as they can beat most Fairy checks and divert attention from Mega Gardevoir with Rage Powder. Milotic has access to Icy Wind to further augment Gardevoir's Speed and let it fully utilize its power; Milotic can also use Scald to burn foes, halving the damage taken from physical attacks and making Gardevoir's frail Defense more tolerable. Mega Gardevoir also works well as a \"second Mega Evolution\" alongside another Mega Evolution such as Garchomp, Venusaur, Lucario, or Tyranitar, which can all work with or without their Mega Stone, allowing for more diverse in-game decisions to adapt to your opponent's team.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast has a high damage output and 100% accuracy; because of this, it is usually the move of choice to deal with specific targets. The choice between Psychic and Psyshock depends on your team, as the former has a higher Base Power, but the latter deals physical damage, which is helpful because many of Gardevoir's checks have low Defense stats. Dazzling Gleam is a STAB spread move, which works if Gardevoir wants to cause more spread damage over the opposing team instead of targeting a specific member. However, Healing Wish allows Gardevoir to come in and completely revive an otherwise incapacitated teammate, immediately changing the momentum of the game. Shadow Ball covers opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Gothitelle, Cresselia, and Aegislash, respectively, better than the previous moves do, while Choice Scarf Destiny Bond allows Gardevoir to switch in at low health and get a surprise KO out of a risky situation.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf supplements one of Gardevoir's weakest points: its base 80 Speed. With maximum Special Attack investment and 244 Speed EVs, Gardevoir outspeeds major threats such as Choice Scarf Adamant Landorus-T, Jolly Smeargle, Mega Gengar, Mega Lopunny, Jolly Mega Tyranitar at +1, and neutral-natured Mega Gyarados at +1 and hits as hard as possible. The remaining EVs go into HP to increase Gardevoir's ability to take hits. However, a variant with 252 Speed and 4 HP EVs works just as well to maximize Speed. Telepathy and Trace work equally well here, catering to whether your team needs a partner to Earthquake users or a counter to specific threats such as Intimidate, Parental Bond, or Competitive users.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Gardevoir works well in either a lead or a clean-up situation, though not both in the same match. Its ability to inflict incredibly quick and good amounts of damage can work very efficiently in either situation. However, Gardevoir finds itself very vulnerable to priority moves due to its low Defense, and Sucker Punch, Fake Out, Bullet Punch, and Shadow Sneak are very prevalent. Be sure to eliminate users of such moves before attempting to sweep. Paralysis and Trick Room are also crippling to Gardevoir, taking away the best asset of the set and allowing common slower sweepers such as Mawile and Camerupt to knock Gardevoir out first.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gardevoir really appreciates Steel-type checks; Heatran, Arcanine, and Rotom-H work especially well, as they all have respectable bulk and appreciate Gardevoir's Speed allowing them to invest into bulk and power. Landorus-T also acts as an excellent partner, as Intimidate cushions Gardevoir's lackluster Defense and its STAB spread move in Earthquake threatens the entire field. However, if Landorus-T is to be Gardevoir's partner, consider Telepathy over Trace, as Earthquake will hit Gardevoir otherwise. Amoonguss acts as a Trick Room check and has access to Rage Powder and Spore, allowing Gardevoir to more effectively focus on one foe at a time while Amoonguss incapacitates the other. Volcarona also provides Rage Powder support and has Fire-type STAB moves, being a great median of Rage Powder user and Steel-type check. Finally, Gardevoir adores Shadow Tag support, as it is able to trap opposing threats for Gardevoir to eliminate. Gothitelle works excellently, as it has considerable bulk and can provide Helping Hand support as well, while Mega Gengar acts as an offensive force with extremely strong STAB moves that hit Fairy- and Psychic-types, which could otherwise sponge hits, super effectively.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast is the move with the highest damage output that Gardevoir has access to; it also has 100% accuracy, so it is usually the move of choice to deal with specific targets. Whether you run Psychic or Psyshock depends on your team, as the former has a higher Base Power, but the latter deals physical damage against Gardevoir's checks, many of which have low Defense stats. Dazzling Gleam gets a STAB boost and is a spread move, which works if Gardevoir wants to cause more spread damage over the team instead of targeting a specific member. Finally, Shadow Ball acts as coverage for bulky Psychic-types such as Gothitelle and Cresselia, as well as Aegislash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment with Choice Specs allows Gardevoir to have the strongest Fairy-type move in the game, even over Mega Gardevoir, Choice Specs Sylveon, and Mega Altaria's Hyper Voice. 180 Speed EVs allow Gardevoir to outspeed Adamant Bisharp and OHKO it with Moonblast, while the remaining 68 HP, 4 Defense, and 4 Special Defense EVs maximize Gardevoir's bulk without wasting EVs. However, a spread with 252 Speed and Special Attack EVs is also extremely effective, maximizing Gardevoir's questionable Speed and dangerous power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Specs Gardevoir works best as a wallbreaker, as its immense power is incredibly hard to deal with for a majority of the metagame, and having remaining team members to clean up allows Gardevoir to more effectively accomplish this goal throughout the match. Firing off a few Moonblasts or Dazzling Gleams is usually all that Gardevoir will be able to accomplish, but the immense amount of damage it can cause is usually worth it. However, Gardevoir can clean up in the late-game equally well, where its power is needed and its mediocre base 80 Speed is less of an issue. Gardevoir does poorly against most priority moves due to its poor HP and Defense, so Sucker Punch, Bullet Punch, Extreme Speed, and Shadow Sneak should be scouted for and their users eliminated.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gardevoir appreciates Fake Out support, as it nearly guarantees that Gardevoir can use a Choice Specs-boosted Dazzling Gleam or Moonblast. Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty are excellent partners, as the former's ability Parental Bond creates a lot of offensive pressure and the latter has access to Intimidate and Quick Guard, easing the pressure on Gardevoir. Pokemon that can check Steel-types or provide Intimidate support are also useful, such as Landorus-T or Gyarados with Earthquake or Arcanine with Will-O-Wisp. Gyarados also gets access to Thunder Wave, which provides necessary speed control that Gardevoir also really appreciates to supplement its mediocre Speed. Pokemon with access to Tailwind or Icy Wind are always welcome; for example, Suicune can set up Tailwind and also threatens the Fire-types that resist Moonblast. Thundurus with Prankster Thunder Wave and Encore or Cresselia can provide Thunder Wave, Icy Wind, or even the occasional Helping Hand support to boost the power of Gardevoir's moves even further. Finally, redirection in the form of Rage Powder can be helpful as well. Amoonguss can provide this support and also gets access to Spore, which can be used to cripple the opponent's team. Volcarona's Fire-type STAB moves also threaten enemy Steel-types.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mega Gallade is an offensive terror with base 165 Attack and 110 Speed, as well as a wide support and offensive movepool. Mega Gallade gains the ability Inner Focus which allows it to attack through a Fake Out, beating Kangaskhan. Base 68 HP / 95 Def / 114 SpD, while respectable, isn't enough to tank repeated hits, and he is bogged down by the fact that he's sporting a weak base 80 Speed before Mega Evolution. His great STAB types allow him to take out common threats such as Kangaskhan and Amoonguss, but is completely walled by Pokemon such as Aegislash and Cresselia. His movepool comes in handy here, with Stone Edge for Flying-types and Knock Off for Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gallade has a surprisingly good support movepool with Will-O-Wisp, Feint, Taunt, and Encore, but it struggles to find a moveslot for them and usually ends up being outclassed in that role by other Pokemon such as Gengar with Taunt and Will-O-Wisp and Whimsicott with Taunt and Encore. Gallade has access to a great boosting move in Swords Dance but lacks the bulk to make the setup worth it. Drain Punch is an alternative to Close Combat on bulkier builds, but it lacks the power to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan, one of the main reasons to use Gallade. Kee Berry is surprisingly useful on the supportive attacker set with the right spread, but this is only advised when Item Clause is giving you issues with using Sitrus Berry. Rock Slide and Stone Edge are useful for dealing with Mega Charizard Y, Zapdos, and Thundurus, as well as other Flying-types. The choice between either comes down to whether you prefer spread damage or power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy- and Flying-types: Gallade in general has a hard time dealing with threats such as Sylveon, Mega Mawile, and Talonflame.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: While Gallade can pack the coverage to deal with Intimidate users, the Attack drop from Intimidate seriously irritates Gallade.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burn, paralysis, and sleep all stop Gallade dead in its tracks.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Trick Room, Tailwind, and Icy Wind take away Mega Gallade's main draw, its Speed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Choice Scarf users, Talonflame, and Mega Salamence can outspeed and do a lot of damage to or KO Gallade.</p>",

Zen Headbutt takes out Fighting- and Poison-types and hits foes such as Mega Charizard Y neutrally which Close Combat cannot. Ice Punch is a great coverage move, used to deal with Dragon-types as well as Flying-types and Ground-types, particularly Mega Salamence and Landorus-T. Knock Off hits Aegislash, Cresselia, and other Psychic-types super effectively. Protect is obligatory to avoid damage from moves, as well as giving Gallade an opportunity to safely Mega Evolve for the Speed boost.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Galladite lets Gallade Mega Evolve, turning him into the offensive terror that he is. Full Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Mega Gallade to maximize damage output as well as Speed tie with other base 110 Speed Pokemon and outspeed things below, such as Terrakion. Justified is useful before Mega Evolving for switching into a Dark-type move, particularly Knock Off.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>While Mega Gallade does have Inner Focus, make sure you think out how you lead with it, as it can fend off a Fake Out but will be slower on the crucial turn one, sporting the risk to take too much initial damage. Close Combat, while being the move of choice for dealing the most damage, will stack defense drops after several uses, making Mega Gallade very vulnerable to priority and faster threats.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gallade enjoys Pokemon that will alleviate its struggle against Cresselia, Aegislash, and Sylveon. Bisharp will take care of all three as well as deter Intimidate users from trying to weaken Mega Gallade. Suicune, and bulky Water-types in general, will get rid of Talonflame and Landorus, two threats to Mega Gallade. Rotom-A formes and Tyranitar take on Talonflame. Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Gengar beat out opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types, while Mega Gallade takes out Dark-types for them. Gallade also functions well with Heatran, which alleviates Gallade's Fairy weakness and deals with Aegislash. Use Quick Guard users such as Terrakion to protect Mega Gallade from Talonflame's Brave Bird and Thundurus's Thunder Wave.</p>"

Zen Headbutt gives Gallade another strong STAB move as well as a way to KO Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and other Fighting-types. Knock Off helps damage Aegislash and Cresselia, two common threats that plague Gallade. Wide Guard shields both Gallade and its partner from incoming spread attacks, while Quick Guard protects Gallade's side of the field from priority attacks and priority status. Icy Wind and Trick Room both provide a means of speed control; the choice of which is determined by what supports your team better.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread allows Gallade to outspeed Bisharp and Mega Lucario after Icy Wind and OHKO maximum HP Mega Kangaskhan, with the rest of the EVs put in HP. The spread lets Mega Gallade survive a Mega Kangaskhan's Return after an Intimidate drop. Focus Sash helps extend Gallade's longevity which is otherwise hampered by Gallade's low defenses and the defense drops it suffers from using Close Combat. If running Trick Room the EV spread should be changed to 252 HP / 196 Atk / 60 Def. Brave or Adamant with 0 Speed IV both work, with Adamant being the nature of choice for semi-Trick Room teams. Gallade has bulkier options with spreads such as 252 HP / 100 Atk / 156 Def with an Adamant or Brave nature to survive Mega Kangaskhan's Returns. Sitrus Berry is the item of choice for this spread, but if it's already being used it can be replaced with Safety Goggles or Rocky Helmet.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Close Combat undermines any defensive investment Gallade has, so use it cautiously if you wish to keep Gallade alive. Wide Guard supports teammates such as Mega Charizard Y against Landorus-T and other Rock Slide users, which gives Gallade's partner safe plays. Remember to use speed control; Trick Room depends on your team, but once in a position to attack after using Icy Wind or Trick Room you can follow up with Close Combat. This Gallade set works best as a lead to support and apply offensive pressure at the same time.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Using Gallade with Pokemon that are commonly the fodder of spread or priority moves (respective to which Guard move you're running) such as Mega Metagross and Mega Charizard Y is opportune to let them set up or attack for free. Togekiss makes for a good partner, as Gallade can deal with Steel-, Poison-, and Rock-types and use Wide Guard against Rock Slides, while Togekiss can redirect attacks to allow Gallade to support with speed control or attack. Amoonguss likes Trick Room being up alongside Gallade to Spore foes freely while Gallade protects against things such as Talonflame and Prankster Taunt with Quick Guard.</p>"

Heatran's weaknesses to Ground, Fighting, and Water are problematic, but are really all that challenge Heatran. If the foe can't hit Heatran for super effective damage, chances are it can't touch it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Grass and Ice allow Heatran to target and deal solid damage to Water-types and Dragon-types, respectfully which it normally has trouble beating. However a Hidden Power is generally not worth a slot over Earth Power or Substitute. Overheat can be used over either Heat Wave or any of the moves in the third slot. Ancient Power lets Heatran take on Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Rotom-H, but it's very weak and not too useful outside of those targets. Chople Berry is nice for sponging powerful Fighting-type attacks, but Battle Spot Doubles doesn't see too many of them. Choice items are somewhat viable, but Heatran faces stiff competition as a Choice user from Rotom-H, which has mostly better coverage options. Also, most Trick Room sets Heatran could run in previous years are now better done by Mega Camerupt.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Strong STAB Earthquakes: Landorus-T, Garchomp, and other STAB Earthquake users are trouble for Heatran. Other Earthquake users are also problematic, but Heatran can usually survive most weaker Earthquakes.</p> <p><strong>Strong Fighting-type Attacks: Terrakion's Close Combat destroys Heatran. Hariyama's Close Combat does the job too, and Hariyama can also run Thick Fat to sponge Heat Waves. Mega Kangaskhan gets a mention as well, as its Low Kick and Drain Punch can break Heatran's Substitute and hit Heatran directly.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-W: All Heatran can use to touch Rotom-W is a weak Hidden Power Grass. In return, Rotom-W can take Heat Waves just fine and Hydro Pump Heatran for the KO.</p> <p><strong>Rotom-H</strong>: Rotom-H walls Heatran and can hit it with a moderately powerful Thunderbolt.

Heatran causes a lot of switches, so setting up a Substitute while the foe switches to a Heatran answer can be extremely rewarding. Flash Cannon is viable due to the abundance of Fairy-types that Heatran deals with nicely. Taunt shuts down foes' support options, such as Tailwind and Trick Room. Protect prevents Heatran from being double targeted and allows it to guard itself while a teammate deals with a threat to Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed uninvested Rotom-A. Maximum investment in Special Attack ensures that Heatran can dish out powerful hits, and the leftover EVs go in HP. Rotom-A often run Speed creep EVs, so it's recommended you transfer some investment from HP to Speed to outrun it. However, Heatran's EV spread is very flexible; feel free to rearrange them to better suit what your team needs. 204 Speed EVs with a Modest nature allow Heatran to outrun max Speed Adamant Bisharp and KO it with Heat Wave. If you want Heatran to outrun Jolly Bisharp, it should use the same investment with a Timid nature. Heatran's resistances and access to Substitute make it a good Leftovers user. A Shuca Berry will let Heatran live an Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T's Earthquake once, though Heatran won't be able to create a Substitute afterwords without more defensive investment.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Heatran is a Pokemon of extremes, as foes generally either can destroy Heatran or can't touch it. The general course of action for using Heatran is to switch it in when it can wall or isn't threatened by either opposing Pokemon, then set up a Substitute and start using Heat Wave.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran loathes Landorus-T and Rotom-W and appreciates partners that can deal with them. A partner Rotom-W is a great answer to Landorus-T. A core of Rotom-W and Heatran is hard to break, though other Water-types such as Suicune for its Tailwind support, Gastrodon for its Storm Drain support, and Swampert for its Wide Guard support are also useful. Amoonguss can deal with Rotom-W and redirect single target super effective hits. Offensively, Heatran forms a dangerous pair with most specially oriented Dragon-types, such as Hydreigon, Mega Salamence, and Latios.

Most notable are Bisharp and Hydreigon, which are very troublesome for Aegislash, as both are able to OHKO it. Due to Defiant, Bisharp doesn't mind attacking into King's Shield.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt from Thundurus or Sableye forces Aegislash to stay in Blade Forme, which means that it can't tank hits, and Sucker Punch can be spammed on Aegislash as well.</p> <p><strong>Confusion: Confusion is very dangerous, as when trying to attack, Aegislash has 150 base Attack and only base 50 Defense, so hitting itself hurts.</p> <p><strong>Mega Lopunny</strong>: Mega Lopunny can OHKO Aegislash when in Shield Forme with its STAB High Jump Kick, although it risks hitting into a King's Shield.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y</strong>: Mega Charizard Y threatens Aegislash with a sun-boosted Overheat or Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users</strong>: Without Wide Guard, Aegislash fears Earthquake, so common users such as Excadrill and Landorus-T are feared.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball and Flash Cannon are Aegislash's main STAB moves, though Sacred Sword can be used over Flash Cannon to hit Hydreigon and Bisharp more effectively. Substitute protects Aegislash from status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, while Wide Guard provides support to it and its teammates by protecting them from spread attacks such as Hyper Voice, Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Heat Wave. King's Shield is necessary, as it lets Aegislash alter back to its Shield Forme after it attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>If Aegislash is running Substitute, then it will need Leftovers so that it can slowly recover the HP lost; however, if this is not the case, then choosing to run a Weakness Policy will apply more offensive pressure. At +2, Aegislash will force the opponent to concentrate on it rather than its teammate. The EVs used are simple, investing completely into HP and Special Attack. With Weakness Policy, 156 Special Defense EVs can also be used to allow Aegislash to survive a Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse from Modest Hydreigon, and after the boost, Aegislash has a high chance of OHKOing Hydreigon with Flash Cannon. A Quiet nature and minimum Speed investment help Aegislash be the slowest Pokemon on the field so that it can tank hits in its Shield Forme, although you may tinker with the IVs so that it can outspeed certain threats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When not threatened, Aegislash should always use Substitute so that the opponent will be pressured to remove its Substitute. Try to stay in Shield Forme as long as possible so that Aegislash can utilize its base 150 defenses, but using a Substitute can give Aegislash some free turns to attack. Wide Guard is an excellent move to use when playing against Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Landorus-T, which have multi-target moves. Please note that Aegislash can successfully spam Wide Guard, but using King's Shield right after could result in failing.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon synergize well with Aegislash as it resists Rock-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type attacks, while the Dragon-types resist Fire, and Flying-types are immune to Ground. Terrakion is a great partner because it beats Dark- and Fire-types, while Wide Guard can allow it to avoid being hit by Hyper Voice and Earthquake. Pokemon that are weak to spread moves appreciate Wide Guard support, and are therefore great teammates. Fake Out users can give Aegislash an opportunity to set up a Substitute. Fairy-types are good partners for Aegislash because they can take on the Dark-types that threaten it, and Aegislash resists Steel while also being immune to Poison.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball is Aegislash's main STAB move, and Flash Cannon hits Fairy-types hard. Shadow Sneak helps pick off foes if Aegislash has a +2 boost or if they are really weakened, while Sacred Sword hits most Dark-types for super effective damage. King's Shield is necessary, as it lets Aegislash alter back to its Shield Forme after it attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>For a more offensive Aegislash, a simple EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpA should be used, but again, 156 Special Defense EVs let Aegislash survive a Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse from Modest Hydreigon. A Weakness Policy is chosen as the main item because it gives a +2 boost to Aegislash's offensive stats if it is hit by a super effective attack. However, a Life Orb can be used for an instant 30% boost in power to its attacks without having to risk being KOed by a super effective attack. A Spooky Plate gives a 20% boost in power to Aegislash's Ghost-type attacks, and is another nice option because it will be using Shadow Ball most of the time, but it is generally inferior to Weakness Policy or Life Orb because it doesn't power up anything else other than the former and Shadow Sneak. 0 IVs in Speed help Aegislash be the slowest Pokemon on the field so that it can tank hits and retaliate with a strong attack, but again, tinkering with the IVs may allow it to outspeed certain threats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With Sacred Sword, Aegislash fears Dark-types less, but should still stay in Shield Forme to tank hits. Use Flash Cannon to threaten Fairy-types. If you opt to use a Weakness Policy, try to bait super effective attacks onto Aegislash so that it can get a +2 boost to both of its offensive stats, allowing it to KO foes more reliably. Without Wide Guard, be more aware of attacks such as Earthquake and Heat Wave, and it is important to stay in Shield Forme often, as this specific Aegislash doesn't have Substitute.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon synergize well with Aegislash, as it resists Rock-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type attacks, while the Dragon-types resist Fire, and Flying-types are immune to Ground. Terrakion is a great partner because it beats Dark- and Fire-type Pokemon that threaten Aegislash. Pokemon that can't quite pick up KOs are helped by Aegislash because Shadow Sneak finishes off the foe. Redirection support helps prevent Sucker Punch from hitting Aegislash. Fairy-types make for good partners for Aegislash because they can take on the Dark-types that threaten it, and Aegislash resists Steel and is immune to Poison.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>An insane 120 / 120 / 130 bulk makes Cresselia one of the bulkiest Pokemon in the entire metagame. Cresselia's ability, Levitate, is very useful to deal with common Earthquakes and helps her partner use it freely. With her bulk and movepool, Cresselia is one of the best support Pokemon; she can also easily set up Trick Room. Despite Cresselia's huge bulk, she is not impossible to take down. Powerful super effective STAB moves, such as Shadow Ball from Aegislash and Knock Off from Bisharp, deal lots of damage to her. Some Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, and Mega Mawile, have enough power to hurt Cresselia badly. Though Cresselia has a decent offensive movepool, she has mediocre offenses, and decline in popularity of Fighting-type Pokemon hurt Psychic-type offensively, meaning that Taunt can shut her down easily.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With Calm Mind, Cresselia becomes really threatening; she gains offensive pressure and becomes virtually invulnerable against special attacks, even super effective ones. Moonblast allows Cresselia to hit Dark-types, such as Scrafty and Hydreigon, but it is otherwise pretty weak. Skill Swap allows Cresselia to swap abilities with her target. For example, it can take some dangerous abilities away from Pokemon, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Sylveon or steal Intimidate and use it against foes. Expert Belt allows Cresselia to play more offensively, giving her enough power to use either Hidden Power Ground or Fire to hit Steel-types. Hidden Power Fighting is, however, no longer legal. With Expert Belt, Cresselia doesn't need any Special Attack investment to OHKO 4 HP Landorus-T. Swagger can be helpful to shut down foes with its confusion chance, and it works well with Thunder Wave. Rain Dance can be used if Cresselia is used on a rain team. Light Screen or Reflect can be used to increase Cresselia and her partner's bulk for five turns. Cresselia can, of course, use Protect, as it is a great move on anything in Battle Spot Doubles. However, most of the time, Cresselia prefers to have a support or coverage move instead. Lastly, Chesto Berry + Rest can be used for one-time full healing. However, they take up Cresselia's item and one moveslot, so Moonlight is generally the better option, unless Cresselia is used on a non-sun weather team and recovery is necessary.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types are a pain for Cresselia. Most of them don't care about Cresselia's attacks, as they are immune to Psychic, and can hit her hard with their Dark-type STAB moves. Bisharp is especially problematic due to its raw power, Knock Off, Steel typing, and the fact that it gets a Defiant boost from Icy Wind.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: While not as troublesome as Dark-types, Ghost-types still have powerful STAB moves to hit Cresselia hard. Gengar has Taunt, which can shut Cresselia down, and Aegislash can use Cresselia as setup bait with Substitute, as it really doesn't care about anything Cresselia uses.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users, such as Thundurus and Gengar, can simply prevent Cresselia from using her support moves, bar Icy Wind, which can easily make her dead weight.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types can cause problems for Cresselia, as they typically resist Cresselia's moves.</p>",

        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room allows slow Pokemon such as Mega Camerupt and Mega Mawile to sweep. Psychic or Psyshock is Cresselia's STAB move; Psychic hits harder overall, but Psyshock hits Pokemon with low Defense, such as Sylveon and Milotic, harder. Ice Beam hits Landorus-T and Mega Salamence hard. Helping Hand allows Cresselia to power up her partner's moves. Safeguard blocks some annoying status moves, such as Swagger, Spore, and Thunder Wave, which can waste important turns of Trick Room. Sunny Day shuts down opposing rain and is helpful if Cresselia's partner is Mega Camerupt, boosting power of its Fire-type moves deadly levels.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>236 HP and 204 Defense EVs allow Cresselia to survive two of Mega Mawile's Play Roughs, while the remaining 68 Special Defense EVs increase her special bulk. Mental Herb is used to block Taunt, which is often used to stop her setting Trick Room. Sitrus Berry increases Cresselia's longevity, increasing her chance to get a Trick Room up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cresselia should be used mainly as Trick Room setter. After Trick Room is up, use either Safeguard to block status moves, Helping Hand to boost her partner's moves, or her STAB move and Ice Beam to attack foes. Cresselia is bulky enough to potentially set up Trick Room multiple times. Mental Herb blocks Taunt once, so don't be too afraid of it if you need to get Trick Room up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>All Pokemon that enjoy Trick Room support are good partners for Cresselia. Powerful Trick Room Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Mawile, Mega Camerupt, and Mega Abomasnow, are some examples. Amoonguss works well in Trick Room, with the ability to outspeed almost everything and put foes to sleep. Slow and bulky Fake Out users such as Scrafty and Hariyama increase the chance for Cresselia to get Trick Room up. Landorus-T can use Intimidate to weaken a physical attacks aimed at Cresselia and then U-turn into a Trick Room sweeper.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Icy Wind slows down both opposing Pokemon, deals an okay amount of damage, and can't be shut down by Taunt. Thunder Wave targets only one Pokemon, but it won't activate Defiant or Competitive. Psychic is the primary STAB option, hitting decently hard against targets that are weak to it. Psyshock is weaker than Psychic, but it targets Defense instead of Special Defense such as Milotic, Mega Charizard Y, and Sylveon. Moonlight gives Cresselia a recovery move. Ice Beam is a great coverage move, because despite Cresselia's weak Special Attack stat, Ice is a great offensive typing and hits many common Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Garchomp 4x super effectively. Ice Beam should be used only if you don't run Icy Wind, however. Helping Hand allows Cresselia to boost her partner's power and pick up surprising KOs. Safeguard can block Spore, Thunder Wave, and Will-O-Wisp. Moonlight can also be used in this slot if you want to use both Ice Beam and Moonlight. Sunny Day can be used if rain teams give you problems, and it boosts the power of Fire-types, such as Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Bold nature, 252 HP EVs, and 172 Defense EVs allow Cresselia to survive two of Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Returns. 84 Special Defense EVs increase Cresselia's special bulk. EVs can be optimized in many ways; 52 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed positive natured base 100s after Icy Wind, and 212 Special Attack EVs allow her to OHKO 4 HP Landorus-T. Sitrus Berry increases Cresselia's longevity. Leftovers recovers more HP in the long run than Sitrus Berry does, though. With Leftovers, 100 Defense EVs are enough to let Cresselia to survive two Returns from Adamant Mega Kangaskhan. Rocky Helmet works well with Cresselia's bulk and allows her to annoy physical attackers, especially Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cresselia should be used to support her team. Using her is simple: first she should use a speed control move, and then she should either attack with her Psychic-type STAB move and Ice Beam, support with Helping Handm or heal herself with Moonlight. Cresselia works well during any stage of battle, and she is easy to switch in due to her massive bulk. While Cresselia can tank hits well, try to avoid powerful super effective attacks such as Bisharp's Knock Off.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Any Pokemon that enjoys speed control is a good partner for Cresselia, such as Bisharp, Mega Kangaskhan, Breloom, Hydreigon, or Sylveon. Landorus-T and Garchomp work well with Cresselia, as they can use Earthquake safely, and Cresselia can even boost their Earthquakes with Helping Hand. Mega Charizard Y is a good partner for Cresselia; it enjoys her ability to provide speed control, KOes many Pokemon that threaten her, such as Aegislash and Bisharp, and enjoys Helping Hand, while she can beat Pokemon that threaten Charizard, such as Salamence and Landorus-T, and Moonlight heals her even more in sun. Other Fire-types, such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Talonflame, can beat Steel-types, which wall Cresselia. Heatran also enjoys speed control.</p>"

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is one of the most threatening Grass-types in the metagame, almost forcing every team to carry a check to it. Its Mega Evolution is one of the bulkiest Pokemon around, with impressive defensive stats of 80 / 123 / 120. Mega Venusaur is also a perfect counter to rain, walling the most common rain sweeper, Ludicolo. In addition, it perfectly fits into a bulky Fire / Water / Grass core, and its Poison typing allows it to solidly beat Fairy-types, as it resists their STAB type and hits them super effectively. Regular Venusaur can also work well as a sun sweeper thanks to Chlorophyll. However, Venusaur struggles with its limited coverage outside of its STAB attacks, having only various Hidden Powers as options for better coverage, and its weakness to Flying- and Psychic-type attacks, especially Talonflame's priority Brave Bird. Fire and Ice are also weaknesses, but these are neutralized when Venusaur Mega Evolves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>For the sun sweeper set, you can opt to go for a different Hidden Power; the most useful would be Hidden Power Ground, as it would help Venusaur's matchup against Steel-types such as Heatran and Aegislash. Energy Ball is an option for a Grass-type STAB move, as it has more power than Giga Drain and no drawbacks. Grass Pledge is also an option if you want to run a Pledge combo, preferably with Mega Charizard Y. Running Venusaurite on the sun sweeper set sounds strange, but it allows you to choose between two different megas at the expense of essentially not having an item when used alongside Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-type Attacks: Flying-type moves are some of the few things that hit Mega Venusaur for super effective damage. Pokemon to look out for and carry a solid check to are Talonflame and Mega Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types such as Latios, Latias, and Gardevoir give Venusaur trouble, as they have a super effective STAB move with which to hit Venusaur. They also tend to have reasonable special bulk, so they can tank a hit or two from Venusaur as well.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types wall all Grass-types in general, and Venusaur is no exception. Although Mega Venusaur only gets hit neutrally by Fire-type attacks, Venusaur can't do that much to them in return. Heatran walls Venusaur particularly hard, as it is immune to Sludge Bomb and has a 4x resistance to Grass.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types wall everything Venusaur wants to throw at them and aren't really scared of Venusaur being on the field. They are especially scary if they have Substitute, which Heatran, Mega Metagross, and sometimes Aegislash carry. Substitute is a big problem because Venusaur takes several turns to break them. Mega Metagross is probably the biggest threat, as Venusaur has nothing to hit it with and Metagross has Zen Headbutt to deal a ton of damage in return.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Giga Drain is an obvious choice on Mega Venusaur thanks to STAB and recovery. It also hits bulky Water-types hard, which are very popular in the metagame. Sludge Bomb is mainly used to hit Fairy-types or fish for poison. Leech Seed is a different type of recovery and is especially useful in a one-on-one situation; therefore, it is generally best to use when the foe cannot switch out. Synthesis is an option to recover a lot of HP at once, as Giga Drain and Leech Seed don't recover that much at a time. Sleep Powder is an option if you want to lull foes to sleep, but it has very shaky accuracy. Protect is a staple in Battle Spot Doubles, and it allows Mega Venusaur to dodge potential double targeting and have its ally eliminate the biggest threat to it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in HP maximize Mega Venusaur's overall bulk and allow it to tank as many hits as possible before it gets knocked out. 124 Defense EVs and a Bold nature are used to increase Mega Venusaur's physical bulk even further, as many of the hardest-hitting Pokemon in the metagame are physical attackers. This spread lets Mega Venusaur survive maximum Attack Life Orb Talonflame's Brave Bird and neutral-natured Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird. 76 Special Attack EVs maintain a high damage output for Mega Venusaur. 52 Special Defense EVs give Venusaur a little bit of extra special bulk, notably letting it survive a Psychic from neutral-natured Mega Gardevoir.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When facing a foe that is hit neutrally by both of Venusaur's STAB moves, you must always consider which move to use: it comes down to choosing between Giga Drain's recovery and Sludge Bomb's higher power and poison chance. Picking the correct option between these can at times be the difference between winning and losing, so always think through which one you want to use. With Venusaur it is also important to consider the possibility of saving it for late in the match, as Venusaur can win one-on-one against almost all Pokemon that don't have a powerful super effective attack. Using Leech Seed early in the game can pay off but can also cost you, because then your opponent can just switch out to lift the effect of Leech Seed. However, using Leech Seed on a bulky Pokemon that is likely to stay in for a while can be very smart, as the damage dealt by Leech Seed over a few turns can quickly add up. You should also consider if your opponent has something in the back to deal with what you have out; if they don't have any good switch-ins, they will be more likely to stay in and take the damage from Leech Seed than to switch out to a worse matchup.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Like so much else in Battle Spot Doubles, Mega Venusaur really appreciates Tailwind, as it allows Venusaur to outspeed many threats and maybe KO them before they get to do anything. A good Tailwind setter that works well with Venusaur is Suicune; it can easily be EVed to OHKO Talonflame every time with Scald, which is maybe the biggest threat to Venusaur out there. Suicune can also deal with Mega Salamence with Ice Beam, which is the second big threat to Venusaur. Rotom-W synergizes very well with Venusaur, as Venusaur can switch in on Rotom-W's only weakness,while Rotom-W can, in return, easily switch into Flying-type moves and threaten Talonflame with Hydro Pump and Salamence with Will-O-Wisp. Snarl and Intimidate are also helpful for Venusaur, as they both cripple foes, making them deal very little damage to Venusaur. Suicune has access to both Snarl and Tailwind, making it a very good choice for a Snarl user. For Intimidate, you can easily go with Landorus-T, seeing as it fits at least decently on almost all Battle Spot Doubles teams. Both Arcanine and Scrafty can carry Intimidate and Snarl and synergize somewhat well with Venusaur.</p>"

Leaf Storm is an option, as it deals a lot of damage combined with Life Orb, OHKOing many bulky Water-types such as Suicune, Politoed, and Rotom-W. However, its Special Attack drop renders Venusaur kind of useless afterwards. Solar Beam is powerful with no direct drawbacks, but if the sun disappears it is useless. Sludge Bomb is mainly used to hit Fairy-types, namely Sylveon. Hidden Power Ice can OHKO Landorus-T and Mega Salamence, which Venusaur outspeeds under sun. Sleep Powder is an option if you want to use Sleep Powder combined with Chlorophyll, which allows Venusaur to outspeed almost any Pokemon and lull it to sleep. The only drawback is the rather poor accuracy of Sleep Powder. Protect is a staple and allows Venusaur to avoid hits it doesn't want to take, which is especially necessary because this set is quite frail.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in Special Attack and a Modest nature let Venusaur hit as hard as possible. 252 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed as good as anything under sun, and this set doesn't really need any bulk investment, as it doesn't want to take any hits anyway. If you want to invest some EVs in bulk, you could use only 60 EVs in Speed to outspeed standard Choice Scarf Landorus-T under the sun. With 236 EVs in Speed, Venusaur outspeeds neutral-natured Mega Salamence after it has set up a Dragon Dance. Life Orb maximizes damage output; Focus Sash is an option to survive a hit that would otherwise OHKO, such as Talonflame's Brave Bird.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If running Sleep Powder, you can go for spreading Sleep Powder on as many foes as possible while Venusaur has the Speed boost from Chlorophyll. When using this set you should just dish out as much damage as possible when sun is up, as you won't have a chance to do anything once the Speed boost is lost. If you're using Mega Charizard Y as your sun setter, you also have to make sure that Venusaur doesn't get knocked out on the first turn, as Venusaur won't get the Speed boost as Charizard Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because this is a sun sweeper set, you will need a Pokemon to set up sun; Mega Charizard Y is easily the best option, outclassing Ninetales in nearly every way. It is also important to have something that checks Fire-types, as they hit Venusaur extremely hard when sun is up. Good Pokemon for this are Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Terrakion. These Pokemon also check Talonflame, which is a very big threat to Venusaur in general. Rotom-W synergizes very well with regular Venusaur as well, although Hydro Pump is very weak under sun. Fake Out support is also very good, allowing Venusaur to launch a Sleep Powder for free. It can also give Mega Charizard Y more freedom to go for Heat Wave, as you will likely be using them on the same team. Good Fake Out users include Hitmontop and Scrafty.</p>"

Mega Charizard Y has good coverage, with Solar Beam being able to hit Water-types. Even when resisted, its Fire-type attacks still do decent damage against Pokemon that resist them. However, Mega Charizard Y is pretty reliant on Drought to do massive damage and is weak to common coverage moves, such as Rock Slide and Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X isn't heavily recommended. As a Dragon Dance user, it's outclassed by Mega Salamence. It's really only good for the Mega Charizard Y bluff and that in itself is such a well explored concept that there's very little surprise to it.  Ancient Power is an option for checking opposing Mega Charizard Y or Talonflame, while Dragon Pulse or Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Salamence, Garchomp, and Hydreigon harder. Air Slash is a secondary STAB move, but it generally isn't the best move to use because most of its targets are hit either as hard or even harder by sun-boosted Fire-type moves anyways. Fire Pledge can be used with Venusaur's Grass Pledge. Focus Blast can be used to hit opposing Heatran and Hydreigon harder. Substitute, in place of another coverage move, can allow Mega Charizard Y to take a hit.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: By taking away Mega Charizard Y's sun, its damage output will be severely lowered. Rain also weakens its Fire-type attacks. Keeping track of sun turns can help you stall it out and render Mega Charizard Y mostly helpless.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Moves</strong>: Due to Mega Charizard Y's 4x Rock weakness, common Rock-type moves, such as Rock Slide and Stone Edge, will do massive damage to it. Terrakion is a great check to Mega Charizard Y, as it can outspeed and OHKO with Rock Slide. Garchomp and Landorus-T work as well, though Mega Charizard Y can run heavy defensive investment or get a partner to Intimidate to live through their Rock Slides. A Stone Edge from just about everything with usable Attack can also OHKO Mega Charizard Y.</p> <p><strong>Typing Advantage: Common Electric-type moves from Pokemon such as Rotom-H, offensive Thundurus, Thundurus-T, and Zapdos will do major damage to Mega Charizard Y. Entei, Heatran, Mega Salamence, and Choice Band Arcanine resist most of Mega Charizard Y's attacks and can heavily damage or OHKO it. Heatran and Chandelure flat out wall Mega Charizard Y if it is not carrying Hidden Power Ground, and Latios as well as bulky Mega Salamence can hammer away at Mega Charizard Y unless it is carrying Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: If using fast Mega Charizard Y, speed control will greatly cripple it. Thunder Wave from Thundurus is really deadly as it slows Mega Charizard Y down while also giving Thundurus the chance to deal massive damage to it due to paralysis.</p>",

Solar Beam provides coverage for Water-types that resist Mega Charizard Y's Fire-type STAB options. Overheat, despite the Special Attack drops, is Mega Charizard Y's strongest STAB move and lets it OHKO Pokemon that its other moves normally would not, such as maximum HP Mega Kangaskhan. Other Fire-type moves, such as Fire Blast and Flamethrower, are viable options, but the power loss is very noticeable. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground allows Mega Charizard Y to hit Heatran, one of its biggest counters, for super effective damage. Protect lets Charizard scout for foes' moves and avoid double targeting, and lets its partner take out a threat while it stays safe.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs allow Mega Charizard Y to outspeed or Speed tie with everything up to neutral-natured base 100s and maximum Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature maximize Mega Charizard Y's damage output. A Timid nature can be used so that Mega Charizard Y can Speed tie with other positive-natured base 100s, such as Mega Kangaskhan. Tweaking Mega Charizard Y's bulk to fit your team is useful, as most of its power is due to sun and its astounding base 159 Special Attack stat. A spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 20 SpA / 44 SpD / 188 Spe gives Mega Charizard Y a reasonable chance to tank a Thunderbolt from a Life Orb Thundurus. If taking investment out of Speed, running 188 EVs with a neutral nature is the lowest recommended, as that's the slowest Mega Charizard Y can get while still outrunning Adamant Landorus-T. Mega Charizard Y beats most Rotom-W one-on-one by outspeeding and OHKOing them with Solar Beam, but for extra insurance, 12 Special Defense EVs let Mega Charizard Y survive maximum Special Attack Rotom-W's Thunderbolt. Mega Charizard Y can't live through most Rock Slides without huge investments. For example, the minimum investment to live through Jolly Garchomp's Rock Slide is 60 HP / 124 Def, Adamant Landorus-T will require 156 HP / 220 Def, and Terrakion will still always OHKO Mega Charizard Y. Therefore, instead of investing heavily into Defense, running an Intimidate user is recommended, as Mega Charizard Y can stomach Landorus-T and Garchomp's Rock Slide with no investment while they're at -1 attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With its powerful Heat Waves, Mega Charizard Y can punch massive holes in teams early-game or close the match out once Pokemon it struggles with have been removed late-game. Keep Mega Charizard Y safe with the rest of your team through Wide Guard, Fake Out, and sleep support. Mega Charizard Y draws in a lot of Pokemon that are resist or are immune to Fire, such as Rotom-H and Heatran, so it is best to have a partner ready to read a switch into something that can tank a Heat Wave. Despite the temptation, it is sometimes best to postpone Charizard's Mega Evolution if your opponent has a Pokemon that can change the weather, such as Tyranitar or Politoed. Overheat should be used in extreme cases where you have to OHKO a big threat such as Mega Kangaskhan and should not be spammed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>One of the first partners that come to mind for Mega Charizard Y is Venusaur. Mega Charizard Y's Drought will benefit Venusaur greatly, as it doubles Venusaur's Speed due to Chlorophyll. Venusaur can check bulky Water-types that can take Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam while also being able to support Mega Charizard Y by putting opposing Pokemon to sleep with Sleep Powder. Mega Charizard Y, in turn, checks Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Aegislash which wall Venusaur. Generally, Pokemon that carry Earthquake are good partners for Mega Charizard Y. One example is Choice Scarf Landorus-T, as it can use Earthquake freely without worrying about damaging its partner. It can also check Heatran, a big counter to Mega Charizard Y, with Earthquake as well as soft-check Rotom-H with Rock Slide. Mega Charizard Y, in turn, checks Ferrothorn, which Landorus-T generally has trouble breaking through, and Rotom-W. Between Earthquake and Heat Wave, the opponent doesn't have many options that can switch into those powerful spread moves. Mamoswine is another good partner. While it lacks the Speed that Choice Scarf Landorus-T possesses, it can check most of the Pokemon that Landorus-T can, besides Rotom-H, while also being able to snipe opposing Landorus-T and Garchomp with Ice Shard. It also has amazing synergy with Mega Charizard Y, as Mamoswine can easily switch into Rock- and Electric-type moves aimed at Mega Charizard Y while Mega Charizard Y can switch into Fighting- and Steel-type moves aimed at Mamoswine. Garchomp is another great partner as, again, it can use Earthquake freely without worrying about hitting its partner. Garchomp can also hit Dragon-types that resist Mega Charizard Y's attacks, such as Hydreigon. Terrakion has access to Close Combat and Rock Slide, which allows it to check Heatran and Rotom-H respectively, while Mega Charizard Y is able to check Aegislash, which Terrakion has trouble against. Mega Charizard Y also greatly benefits from Pokemon that carry Wide Guard. Hitmontop offers Intimidate support, which can weaken opposing Rock Slides, allowing Mega Charizard Y to tank one. It also checks opposing Tyranitar, a common Mega Charizard Y switch-in, and Heatran. Mega Charizard Y, in return, checks Aegislash, which Hitmontop has trouble hitting. Aegislash is another great partner, as it can offer Wide Guard support for Rock Slides while also being able to switch into Rock-type moves aimed at Mega Charizard Y with no problem at all. Mega Charizard Y can check opposing Aegislash and Bisharp, which generally give Aegislash problems. Keep in mind, however, that this pair will be walled pretty hard by Heatran. Swampert is a great teammate, not only for Wide Guard support but also for checking Heatran and Rotom-H, two of Mega Charizard Y's biggest switch-ins. Swampert can also check common Pokemon that carry Rock-type moves, such as Garchomp and Landorus-T, with Ice Beam. Mega Charizard Y, in turn, checks Grass-types that threaten Swampert. Mega Charizard Y greatly benefits from speed control as well, as that will allow it to invest more into bulk. If running Tailwind, Suicune is a good partner, as even with the sun weakening its Water-type attacks it can deal with Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. Cresselia's Icy Wind and Helping Hand help Mega Charizard Y immensely. It also pairs well with the Earthquake users Mega Charizard Y tends to see used alongside it.</p>"

  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>In a metagame focused on neutering physical attackers, a special attacking Mega Evolution with a great Special Attack stat and access to one of the most powerful and reliable spread attacks in Water Spout has a great deal of value. Mega Blastoise's excellent natural bulk is also a boon, allowing it to survive the majority of strong attacks even without investment. However, its mediocre matchup against Mega Kangaskhan, poor single-target damage output in comparison to other Mega Evolutions, and dependence on staying healthy to retain Water Spout's high Base Power make it very reliant on support from its teammates to perform well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fake Out can be used in place of Protect to help Mega Blastoise's partner set up Tailwind, eliminate a faster threat, or break a Focus Sash. Nevertheless, Protect is generally more important for maintaining Mega Blastoise's health. Water Pulse is a single-target alternative to Water Spout that decreases Mega Blastoise's dependence on staying healthy, but Water Spout's excellent spread damage is what plays a key role in Mega Blastoise's viability. Dragon Pulse deals more damage than Ice Beam to Dragon-types that aren't 4x weak to Ice and still threatens a KO on Dragon-types such as Mega Salamence, but the loss in overall coverage makes it a generally poor option. Using Mega Blastoise under Trick Room with an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA, a Quiet nature, and 0 Speed IVs can be a great answer to its desire for speed control. However, this set faces fierce competition from Mega Camerupt, which is generally the better special spread attacker under Trick Room.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Many common Electric-types can deal significant damage to Mega Blastoise and have options to control the field. Rotom-W's Water typing makes it a particularly great check, as it resists Water Spout. Thundurus can Taunt users of redirection and Tailwind setters, which Mega Blastoise is commonly paired with, as well as slow down Mega Blastoise with Thunder Wave. Zapdos can cancel out opposing Tailwind with a Tailwind of its own.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types, such as Amoonguss, ignore Rage Powder's redirection, deal super effective damage to Mega Blastoise with their STAB attacks, and completely wall variants without Ice Beam. However, even variants with Ice Beam should still be wary of Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, which takes little damage from the move thanks to Thick Fat, and Ludicolo, which takes neutral damage from Ice-type attacks thanks to its Water typing. Ludicolo also has a 4x resistance to Water, making it a great switch-in to Water Spout.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y: Mega Charizard Y sets up sun with Drought, halving the damage of Water-type attacks and allowing the immediate use of Solar Beam, which OHKOes Mega Blastoise without defensive investment.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard Users</strong>: Wide Guard prevents the use of Water Spout, neutering Mega Blastoise's offense significantly. Aegislash is an excellent user, although it should be wary of Dark Pulse, which 2HKOes even bulky variants.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Priority moves chip away at Mega Blastoise's health before it can attack, even under Tailwind. Mega Blastoise's matchup against Mega Kangaskhan is notably difficult for this reason, as it has access to both Fake Out and Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Spread Moves: Spread moves circumvent the redirection support that Blastoise often relies on. Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon are particularly threatening, as they both take Mega Blastoise's attacks easily thanks to their high Special Defense stats and hit back hard with a Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Water Spout is Mega Blastoise's primary offensive option, as it has the potential to deal massive damage to both opposing Pokemon. Aura Sphere threatens an OHKO against common targets such as Mega Kangaskhan, Hydreigon, and Tyranitar. Ice Beam synergizes well with Water Spout by dealing super effective damage to the Dragon- and Grass-types that resist it. Dark Pulse is an alternative option that is mostly used to better handle Aegislash, which is a particularly problematic Pokemon due to its access to Wide Guard. Protect is an important tool in shielding Mega Blastoise from unnecessary damage, giving its partner a turn to react to the foe.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature are preferred to outspeed as many foes as possible before they can retaliate, ensuring that Water Spout strikes with its maximum Base Power as often as possible. A Modest nature is an alternative that trades reliability outside of Tailwind for extra power. Maximum Special Attack investment is used to deal as much damage as possible. Rain Dish, while only providing recovery in the rare instance that rain is active before Mega Evolution, is still the preferred option over the comparatively useless Torrent.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Managing Mega Blastoise's HP effectively is key. Bring Blastoise onto the field safely when there's an opportunity to deal a lot of damage with Water Spout, by leading with it, or by switching it in after one of your Pokemon faints. Either keep Mega Blastoise well defended behind a redirecting partner, or ensure that it's faster than everything on the field by utilizing speed control. Aim to use Water Spout early in battle to prevent excessive chip damage from neutering its Base Power.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Redirection is crucial to prevent Mega Blastoise from taking unnecessary damage. Rage Powder Amoonguss has excellent type synergy with Mega Blastoise, as it resists both of Mega Blastoise's weaknesses and hits opposing Water-types super effectively. Clefairy is a notable user of Follow Me thanks to, in part, Friend Guard, which reduces the damage that Mega Blastoise takes from spread attacks. Clefairy also has access to both Helping Hand, which can boost Mega Blastoise's damage output, and Heal Pulse, which can recover Mega Blastoise's lost HP and therefore restore Water Spout's power.</p> <p>Speed control is also important as as a way to remedy Mega Blastoise's middling Speed stat. Talonflame has access to priority Tailwind and has great type synergy with Mega Blastoise, threatening Grass-types that Mega Blastoise struggles against with its STAB moves. Talonflame also has access to Quick Guard, which can protect Mega Blastoise from priority moves. Thundurus can slow down foes with priority Thunder Wave, can Taunt opposing Wide Guard users, and, as an Electric-type, can help deal with opposing Water-types. Zapdos is another Electric-type and can also provide Tailwind support.</p> <p>Togekiss can provide both redirection and speed control with Follow Me and Tailwind, respectively. Raichu can help Mega Blastoise's teammate set up Tailwind with Fake Out, and Raichu's Lightning Rod can also protect Mega Blastoise from Electric-type moves. Both, like Clefairy, also have access to Helping Hand to boost Mega Blastoise's damage output.</p>"

  "Raichu": {
    "overview": "<p>Raichu shines as one of the fastest Fake Out users in Battle Spot Doubles, setting itself apart from other Fake Out users with the use of Encore. Raichu can use Fake Out and Encore to disrupt many of the opponent's potential plans to deal with it and its partner. Using Protect to avoid Fake Out will only put the opponent in a worse position thanks to Encore. Raichu's Lightning Rod can also patch up a teammate's Electric weakness well, almost any Electric-type is going have a hard time facing a team with Raichu around. However, Raichu is extremely frail and relies on Focus Sash to keep itself in the battle. Raichu also faces stiff competition as an Electric-type from Thundurus and Rotom-W.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Air Balloon can be used over Focus Sash to deal with Landorus-T and other Ground-types a bit better, but it's often unreliable due to being very easy to pop. Safety Goggles can be used because Amoonguss can be a big threat to Raichu, as it can redirect Thunderbolt and tank the attack easily. Redirecting Encore can be troublesome for Raichu as well. Safety Goggles allows Raichu to improve its match-up against teams with Amoonguss tremendously. Losing Focus Sash is not good for Raichu, however, and Safety Goggles is useless against teams without Amoonguss.</p> <p>Raichu has good support moves if you're willing to give up the move slot for one. All of these moves are useful, but you will often have to drop Protect or another important move. Feint is a good move to help avoid playing around a foe's Protect, but Raichu already has Encore to punish Protect users. Nuzzle bypasses taunt and is a good move for spreading paralysis. Helping Hand is good for giving Raichu's teammate a damage boost and potentially pick up a crucial OHKO.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Landorus-T: Landorus-T is immune to Raichu's STAB moves and Choice Scarf sets outspeed Raichu and can OHKO it or bring it to its Focus Sash with a STAB Earthquake. Fake Out helps somewhat, but Landorus doesn't care about Encore.</p> <p><strong>Amoonguss: Amoonguss can redirect Raichu's moves with Rage Powder. It can also put Raichu to sleep with Spore while it tries to use Encore on something else. Amoonguss also doesn't care too much if it's locked into Rage Powder.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Pokemon with Taunt, most notably Thundurus, shut down Raichu's ability to use Encore. Without Encore, Raichu loses a lot of its usefulness and foes can use Protect without worry.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan: Mega Kangaskhan can quickly OHKO Raichu through its Focus Sash. It often doesn't carry Protect, so Encore is not very useful against it. Most Mega Kangaskhan won't use Fake Out against Raichu because Raichu outspeeds Mega Kangaskhan anyway, and Encore will likely be coming their way the next turn.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out is a great move for giving Raichu's teammate a free turn. Raichu is an especially good user of Fake Out due to its high Speed, allowing it to outpace the most common Fake Out user, Mega Kangaskhan. It also outspeeds one of the most common Quick Guard users, Terrakion. Encore is a great move to disrupt foes and works very well in conjunction with Fake Out to punish opponents who shield themselves with Protect. Thunderbolt is a powerful, reliable STAB attack with very good neutral coverage. Hidden Power Ice can be used as a secondary attack to hit Pokemon such as Salamence and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Raichu to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. Because Raichu is frail, Focus Sash allows it to survive a single powerful attack. Keep in mind that base 110 is a crowded Speed tier, so Raichu will face many speed ties against Pokemon such as Mega Metagross and Gengar. Lightning Rod can easily patch up a teammate's weakness to Electric-types, and it's also great for avoiding Thunder Wave and almost completely shutting down Thundurus. Lightning Rod also makes Raichu's offensive presence much better when it is activated.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Raichu works well as a lead. Fake Out can immediately start opening up opportunities for Raichu's teammate, giving it a free turn to use a form of speed control such as Tailwind or a setup move such as Dragon Dance. After using Fake Out, Encore or attack as you see fit. Any time the foe uses Protect is an opening for Encore.</p> <p>Keep in mind your opponent will play cautiously around Raichu. Most players know that they won't be able to use Protect around Raichu or won't be able to keep their Pokemon in after using Protect. Try to predict them accordingly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water-types make for great teammates because they appreciate Raichu's Lightning Rod support to nullify their Electric weakness. Raichu works well on rain teams to preserve Politoed. Gyarados can set up Dragon Dance easily with the help of Fake Out. Azumarill can find more opportunities to use Belly Drum with Raichu's Fake Out support as well. Suicune is another great partner, as it can deal with Landorus-T easily, which Raichu normally has trouble with. Suicune can also set up Tailwind easier with Fake Out support.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y is a good teammate that makes use of the Lightning Rod support to negate its weakness as well. Because Charizard forces a lot of foes to use Protect thanks to it's strong offensive presence, Raichu's Fake Out and Encore support works really well with Charizard.</p> <p>Mega Gengar is a good teammate because it can trap foes and even create a Disable and Encore combination with Raichu, forcing foes to struggle when locked into their moves. With Mega Gengar, Raichu can effectively use Volt Switch to help with the flow of Perish Trap teams.</p>"

Heal Pulse and Aromatherapy allow Clefairy to further support its partner, though both moves are fairly situational.

Clefairy is one of the most viable users of Gravity, if that interests you.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt reduces Clefairy's usefulness severely. Taunt users to be wary of include Thundurus and Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Strong Steel- and Poison-type Attacks: Mega Mawile can OHKO Clefairy regardless of defensive investment.

If using Icy Wind, move the Special Attack EVs to Special Defense.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Follow Me is used to protect Clefairy's partner from attacks, and Helping Hand is used occasionally to boost the partner's offenses. Don't be afraid to let Clefairy go down if it's taking a lot of nasty hits. It's better for Clefairy to do its job for a little while than sit around and not do anything later on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can set up with Substitute or boosting moves, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Metagross, Mega Salamence, Swords Dance Terrakion, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Heatran, are all great partners.

Pokemon that can take out Steel-types, such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, are also good partners. Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Steel-types such as Aegislash and Heatran naturally compliment Clefairy.

Protect shields Arcanine from attacks, as most people will tend to double target Arcanine to take it out before it can spread too many Will-O-Wisps; however, Morning Sun is also an option, as it can increase Arcanine's longevity.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment with 148 Defense EVs and a Bold nature makes Jolly Mega Kangaskhan's Return, Jolly Terrakion's Close Combat, and Jolly Terrakion's Rock Slide, if spread damage, 3HKOs. 60 Speed EVs allow Arcanine to outrun Adamant Bisharp. 36 Special Attack EVs allow Arcanine to OHKO 4 HP Bisharp with Flamethrower, while the leftover EVs are put into Special Defense. Sitrus Berry is the preferred item, as it increases Arcanine's longevity; however, if another Pokemon is running Sitrus Berry, Leftovers can be used instead for Arcanine. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Jolly Breloom so that Arcanine can burn them.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Intimidate can allow Arcanine to switch into attacks and cripple opposing physical attackers; however, Arcanine can get worn down pretty easily if it isn't running any form of recovery, so be wary of how much damage it has taken.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types are good partners for Arcanine, as they can switch into Water-type attacks aimed at it and threaten out Rock- and Ground-types. Arcanine, in turn, checks Grass-types that threaten those bulky Water-types. Rotom-W is a great partner in that sense, as it can also threaten out opposing Water-types. Mega Gyarados is also a good partner for Arcanine, as Arcanine's support can add to Mega Gyarados's bulk, thus allowing it to set up Dragon Dances more easily. Gyarados also threatens out Rock- and Ground-types, while Arcanine checks Ferrothorn and Grass-types in general that Gyarados has trouble breaking through. Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Virizion pair really well with Arcanine, as they can switch into Water-type attacks aimed at Arcanine and threaten them out. Virizion takes it a step further by resisting both Ground and Rock too. Arcanine's Will-O-Wisp and Snarl support can make bulkier Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss even harder to take down. Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Garchomp, and Salamence are good partners for Arcanine, as it can easily switch into Fairy- and Ice-type attacks aimed at them, also being able to force out Ice-types. Garchomp can check opposing Rock-types, while the support that Arcanine provides can add to Salamence's bulk and thus give it an easier time to set up Dragon Dances.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flare Blitz is Arcanine's strongest STAB move. Close Combat provides coverage for Rock-types that resist Flare Blitz. Extreme Speed gives Arcanine a priority move and can allow it to pick off weakened Talonflame and opposing Choice Scarf users. Wild Charge hits bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, that take minimal damage from Arcanine's other attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature is preferred because it maximizes Arcanine's offensive power, as its base Attack stat isn't that high to begin with. It also allows Arcanine to 2HKO Suicune with Wild Charge. Maximum Speed EVs are used because Choice Band Arcanine prefers to hit hard and fast, and investing in bulk isn't needed that much for Choice Band Arcanine. Choice Band takes Arcanine's middling Attack stat to scary levels, making it a fearsome wallbreaker. It also allows Arcanine to pick up OHKOs that the Choice Scarf set couldn't, such as being able to OHKO Heatran with Close Combat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Arcanine gets worn down easily, especially with its recoil moves, so it is best not to switch it into attacks so that it can fire off more Flare Blitz and Wild Charge.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive Grass-types, such as Breloom and Virizion, are good partners for Arcanine, as they are able to switch into Ground-, Rock-, and Water-type attacks aimed at Arcanine and force the foe out. Arcanine can check Grass-types that Breloom and Virizion have trouble hitting, such as Amoonguss and Venusaur. Water-types in general work really well as Arcanine's partner because they are able to switch into Water-type attacks aimed at Arcanine and force out Rock- and Ground-types. Rotom-W, in particular, is a really great partner in that it is able to counter Landorus-T, one of Arcanine's biggest checks, as well as being able to switch into Ground-type attacks and force out Water-types. Choice Band Arcanine is also greatly benefited by speed control. Thundurus works well with Arcanine in that sense, as it can provide speed control while also being able to check Water-types. Arcanine, in turn, checks Steel-types that Thundurus has trouble hitting for good damage; however, if using that pair, be wary of Rock-type attacks. Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Latios are great partners for Arcanine. Garchomp can switch into Rock-type attacks aimed at Arcanine and force the foe out. Garchomp, most notably, can easily switch into Heatran and force it out with an Earthquake. Hydreigon and Latios can switch into Water- and Ground-type attacks aimed at Arcanine, with Hydreigon being able to force out Heatran with Earth Power while Latios can force out Terrakion. Arcanine, in turn, can switch into Fairy- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Dragon-types while also being able to force out opposing Ice-types.</p>"

  "Machamp": {
    "overview": "<p>When you look at Machamp, you might struggle to find a reason to use it over Conkeldurr, which has higher Attack and access to Mach Punch. However, Machamp has the ability No Guard combined with Dynamic Punch, which lets it confuse its target without fail. Machamp does, however, still have quite a few problems. Its Speed is very mediocre, meaning Machamp struggles to outspeed key threats even under Tailwind, though it is rather solid for Trick Room. It is also weak to Fairy, one of the best offensive types in the metagame. While It does have a solid Attack stat and somewhat good natural bulk, it can still struggle to do anything due to its poor defensive typing and its Speed, often leaving it vulnerable to attacks from both opposing Pokemon before it can make a move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An Assault Vest set is a somewhat viable option for Machamp, as it provides better special bulk, although Conkeldurr does this job better. Bullet Punch gives Machamp a form of priority and is helpful for picking off weakened foes, although it is really weak. Quick Guard allows Machamp to block priority attacks, which is helpful against Prankster users such as Liepard and Thundurus. Sadly, it is not that helpful against Fake Out, because Quick Guard and Fake Out are in the same priority bracket, and Machamp's low Speed means that it will almost never outspeed a Fake Out user. Rock Slide is an option for dealing spread damage, but Stone Edge is mostly better because it deals a lot more damage to Thundurus and Zapdos.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-type Moves: Flying-type moves from Pokemon such as Talonflame and Mega Salamence can OHKO or deal massive damage to Machamp before it can try to knock their users out.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Gardevoir and Sylveon can OHKO Machamp or deal massive damage to Assault Vest variants with their STAB Hyper Voice. They can even go for Psychic or Psyshock if Machamp uses Wide Guard.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types are immune to Machamp's STAB type, and most hit back really hard. Knock Off makes Ghost-types less of a problem, but they can still pose a big threat.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Mega Metagross can beat Machamp fairly easily with their Psychic-type STAB attacks. Although bulkier Pokemon like Cresselia might use two or three turns to knock out Machamp, Machamp will take longer to KO them, even with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Redirection: Redirection from Pokemon such as Clefairy and Amoonguss is a great way of dealing with Machamp, as it makes Machamp unable to spread confusion to all the opposing Pokemon or get KOs with its coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Lowering Machamp's Attack through Intimidate from Pokemon such as Arcanine and Landorus-T or with burns from Pokemon such as Gengar and Rotom-W makes Machamp's damage output poor and leaves it with no other function than confusing the foe with Dynamic Punch.</p>",

        "name": "Dynamic Punch Tank",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dynamic Punch is boosted by STAB and confuses its target, and thanks to No Guard, it is not held back by its low accuracy. Wide Guard shields Machamp and its teammate from spread attacks. Stone Edge lets Machamp deal super effective damage to most Flying-types, such as Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y. Alternatively, Ice Punch allows Machamp to deal with Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence, while Knock Off provides utility as well as coverage for Psychic- and Ghost-types. Protect is a staple in Battle Spot Doubles and lets Machamp guard itself from unnecessary hits and double targeting.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This EV spread combined with an Adamant nature makes Machamp a hard-hitting tank. 252 HP and 68 Defense EVs make Machamp capable of surviving a Double-Edge from neutral-natured Mega Kangaskhan even without a Sitrus Berry. With 188 Attack EVs, Machamp is able to OHKO 4 HP Mega Kangaskhan with Dynamic Punch. A Brave nature is used when running Machamp in Trick Room, which is one of the better ways to use it, and must also be used in tandem with a 0 Speed IV. No Guard lets Machamp connect all its moves. Lum Berry lets Machamp ignore status once, while Sitrus Berry provides one-time recovery to heal Machamp back to a more comfortable amount of HP after taking a heavy hit. Safety Goggles also gets a mention for allowing Machamp to ignore powder moves, mainly Spore and Rage Powder, both of which can be an annoyance for it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Always keep in mind that when you are using Dynamic Punch, you are effectively halving the foe's accuracy in addition to dealing solid damage. This means that going for Dynamic Punch is always a safe play to make, except if you expect your opponent to switch in a Ghost-type. Machamp is often a fairly good lead to cause chaos on the opposing team with confusion and potentially get rid of items with Knock Off, but you must also be careful leading with it if your opponent has a lot of Pokemon capable of easily KOing Machamp, as leading with Machamp then can cause it to be quickly knocked out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Wide Guard support such as Mega Charizard Y and Hydreigon are good partners for Machamp. In order to patch up its weakness to Flying-types, Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Thundurus also make for good teammates. Steel-types such as Heatran and Aegislash help Machamp by beating Fairy-types. Machamp also enjoys various kinds of speed control. Tailwind from Pokemon such as Suicune and Zapdos, as well as Thunder Wave from Thundurus or even Trick Room from Pokemon such as Cresselia and Jellicent, is great for letting Machamp outspeed the foe and confuse them with Dynamic Punch before they get to make a move.</p>"

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Kangaskhan is arguably the best Mega Pokemon in the format. Parental Bond along with its high-powered STAB attacks, excellent bulk, and variety of coverage moves such as Sucker Punch and Low Kick makes it an absolute terror, and while Intimidate, Will-O-Wisp, and STAB Fighting-type attacks keep it somewhat in check, they certainly don't make this beastly Pokemon not worth using.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan is crippled by status, so Facade can be used to allow it to hit through burn with a 140 Base Power move that is boosted by STAB. Mega Kangaskhan can also run Fire Punch if your team has trouble dealing with Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Gourgeist. Drain Punch can be used instead of Low Kick to gain more longevity. Crunch can be used over Sucker Punch to avoid playing mind games with the foe. Special moves such as Ice Beam and Fire Blast can be used if you don't wish to to take passive damage from Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Rough Skin by using a physical move. Finally, though Mega Kangaskhan has a decent Speed stat, it still can be used successfully in Trick Room teams, as Hammer Arm halves its Speed, making it extremely \"fast\" in Trick Room.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: As Mega Kangaskhan is a physical attacker, Intimidate users, such as Landorus-T, Mawile, and Scrafty, as well as Will-O-Wisp users, such as Rotom-A and Sableye, are able to cripple it and force it out or force it to have to use Power-Up Punch to boost its Attack.</p> <p><strong>Aegislash and Gengar: Aegislash can only be hit by Sucker Punch or the rare Crunch and doesn't take much damage from a Scrappy Low Kick and Return, unlike other Ghost-types. Also, Gengar can burn Kangaskhan or use another status move while it uses Sucker Punch, though it cannot take a Scrappy Return unlike Aegislash.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan relies heavily on its Speed, which makes it useless against Trick Room, Thunder Wave, and Icy Wind users, such as Cresselia.</p> <p><strong>Double Targeting: As Protect is not a common move on Mega Kangaskhan it is vulnerable to double targeting. Fake Out sets are also susceptible to other faster Fake Out users. If Mega Kangaskhan hits itself in confusion after getting its Attack boosted by Power-Up Punch it will also be extremely easy for a foe to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Fighting-type Moves</strong>: Fighting-type moves, such as Superpower, Low Kick, and Close Combat, are Mega Kangaskhan's only weakness, and it's not able to survive Fighting-type moves easily, especially because they are extremely common.</p> <p><strong>Iron Barbs/Rocky Helmet/Rough Skin</strong>: Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs handle Kangaskhan quite well, as they make Mega Kangaskhan take damage every time it attacks; this is made even worse if Mega Kangaskhan runs Double-Edge, which already has recoil. Mega Kangaskhan can easily be KOed after taking recoil damage from Double Edge.</p>",
    "sets": [

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Return is the main STAB move of this set, as it hits hard without any other negative effects; however, Double-Edge can be used to allow Mega Kangaskhan to hit harder but with recoil. After a Power-Up Punch, Mega Kangaskhan can KO most common threats in Battle Spot Doubles with ease. Low Kick can be used over Power-Up Punch to OHKO Pokemon that are weak to it, such as opposing Mega Kangaskhan and Hydreigon. Ice Punch can also be used in that moveslot, as it hits two common Intimidate users, Landorus-T and Salamence, as well as Amoonguss, super effectively. Sucker Punch is needed on this set, as it is the only move that Mega Kangaskhan can hit Ghost-types with after Mega Evolving; it's the only move on the set that has priority and a decent Base Power. Fake Out is an incredibly useful utility move, allowing Kangaskhan to Mega Evolve safely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread allows Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed many threat and to hit as hard as possible. As Mega Kangaskhan has only one weakness and decent bulk, it can survive many hits without any investment in bulk. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature allow Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed Mega Charizard Y. An Adamant nature allows Mega Kangaskhan to deal significant damage against bulky Pokemon such as Sylveon, Amoonguss, and Rotom-A whilst still outspeeding many Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With an appropriate partner, Mega Kangaskhan can be an amazing lead Pokemon, as it can either Fake Out a foe and let its partner KO the foe, or just heavily damage a target, though there aren't many Pokemon that can survive Mega Kangaskhan's attacks after they have taken damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan has three main weakness: Fighting-types, status, and Intimidate. Defiant or Competitive users such as Bisharp or Milotic can deal with Intimidate users, making them good partners. Bulky Ghost-, Psychic-, Flying-, and Fairy-types, such as Aegislash, Thundurus, and Sylveon, make for good partners as well, as they are able to deal with Fighting-types with ease. Intimidate users, such as Landorus, Hitmontop, and Gyarados, are also able to deal with Fighting-types and other physical attackers. Will-O-Wisp users, such as Rotom-A and Sableye, and Thunder Wave users, such as Thundurus and Cresselia, can support Mega Kangaskhan by inflicting its foes with status, allowing it to sweep more easily. Prankster users, such as Thundurus and Whimsicott, can also help with this.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Return is the STAB move of choice, as it hits hard, though Double-Edge can be considered instead to hit harder but at the cost of some recoil. Low Kick can be used as a Fighting-type move to KO opposing Mega Kangaskhan. Power-Up Punch can also be used in that moveslot, as it allows Mega Kangaskhan to pseudo-bypass burns and Intimidate while helping Mega Kangaskhan boost its Attack. Sucker Punch covers Ghost-types and gives Mega Kangaskhan a priority move. Finally, Protect is used to guarantee Kangaskhan a completely safe Mega Evolution; it also protects Mega Kangaskhan from spread moves from its partner, such as Earthquake. Fake Out fits a more supportive role, dealing damage to a target, causing it to flinch, and allowing a partner to KO the target.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread allows Mega Kangaskhan to take multiple hits with ease and hit as hard as possible. The defensive investment lets Mega Kangaskhan survive a max Attack Mega Kangaskhan's Low Kick, an Adamant max Attack Iron Fist Conkeldurr's Drain Punch, and a Modest max Special Attack Choice Specs Hydreigon's Draco Meteor. It also allows Mega Kangaskhan to avoid the 2HKO from Flash Cannon from Quiet max Special Attack Aegislash, which is one of Mega Kangaskhan's most solid counters. The Speed EVs allow Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed Pokemon with base 145 Speed and below under Tailwind, which helps a lot against fast offensive Pokemon, such as Mega Lucario and Mega Metagross. Kangaskhan can only outspeed Adamant max Speed Bisharp after Mega Evolving, however.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is difficult to lead with if Mega Kangaskhan carries Protect, as it cannot use Fake Out and cause the foe to flinch, making it and its partner vulnerable to being KOed. Kangaskhan can easily KO bulky Pokemon when they have taken prior damage, so Mega Kangaskhan is useful for late-game cleaning. It also outspeeds quite a few Pokemon if Tailwind is set up, so Tailwind can be used to make Mega Kangaskhan shine mid-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Although this set does not fear Fighting-types as much as the All-Out Attacker set does thanks to its extra bulk, it still has problems with status and Intimidate, making Defiant or Competitive users such as Bisharp or Milotic, respectively, good partners for Mega Kangaskhan. The only Fighting-type move that OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan is Close Combat, which Ghost-types such as Aegislash are immune to, and Flying- and Fairy-types such as Talonflame and Sylveon can easily OHKO most Close Combat users. An Intimidate user such as Landorus-T or Scrafty can also help Mega Kangaskhan stay on the field longer. Because Mega Kangaskhan appreciates Tailwind support, bulky Tailwind users such as Zapdos and Togekiss make for good partners. Fighting-types such as Mega Lucario can OHKO Mega Kangaskhan even after Intimidate, making Follow Me or Rage Powder users, such as Amoonguss and Togekiss, imperative. Sableye, Klefki, and Rotom-W are problematic, so a fast Prankster and Taunt user such as Thundurus also makes for a good partner.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Unlike most Dragon Dance users, Gyarados has great bulk and Intimidate, which allow it to set up more easily; however, this comes at the cost of its Speed, a painfully slow base 81. Like most physically oriented setup sweepers, Gyarados is heavily crippled by Intimidate, burns, and paralysis. When equipped with Gyaradosite, common Gyarados switch-ins, mainly Rotom-W, aren't a problem anymore due to Mold Breaker, which allows Mega Gyarados to hit the former for super effective damage. Its drastic type change with its Mega Evolution can allow Gyarados to better take on Rock-types and gives it an immunity to Psychic-types. Additionally, Gyarados has a pretty great support movepool, allowing it to perform either as a sweeper or a supporter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Crunch is an alternative STAB move for Mega Gyarados. Safety Goggles makes Gyarados immune to Spore, thus allowing it to further set up on Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Breloom. A Choice Band set can be used to further increase Gyarados's damage output. Icy Wind is an alternative speed control option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Intimidate and burns will lower Gyarados's damage output greatly, forcing it to Dragon Dance more should it want to continue doing damage. Pokemon such as opposing Gyarados and Gengar can outspeed and cripple Gyarados before it sets up a Dragon Dance with Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: If using non-Mega Gyarados, many common Electric-types can threaten it out pretty easily, such as Thundurus or Mega Manectric. In fact, non-Mega Gyarados cannot do anything to Rotom-W. Even Mega Gyarados, before a Dragon Dance, will take massive amounts of damage from an Electric-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: Gyarados's Speed isn't the greatest in the world, so common speed control moves such as Icy Wind and Thunder Wave will cripple Gyarados immensely. Suicune, Cresselia, and Thundurus are huge threats to Gyarados, as Gyarados cannot OHKO Suicune and Cresselia, while Thundurus has access to priority Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Common Grass-types such as Virizion, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn threaten Gyarados. Although Virizion doesn't appreciate an Ice Fang, it is able to tank Waterfall and Earthquake pretty easily while also being able to force Mega Gyarados out with its STAB options. Amoonguss and Ferrothorn both can tank Gyarados's attacks with relative ease. Amoonguss can shut Gyarados down with Spore, while Ferrothorn can essentially stall it out with Leech Seed. More support-oriented Grass-types, however, struggle against the supporting set because it is able to shut them down with Taunt.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall is Gyarados's most reliable Water-type STAB attack. Earthquake should be used when running Gyaradosite as the item, while Ice Fang is a nice alternative move to hit opposing Dragon-types that can tank a Waterfall, such as Salamence and Latios. Stone Edge allows Gyarados to OHKO Mega Charizard Y unboosted and Thundurus after one Dragon Dance. Dragon Dance further increases Gyarados's power and Speed and is highly necessary because Gyarados's Speed is very low. Protect allows Gyarados to scout foes and protects against potential status.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>244 Speed with a Jolly nature allows Gyarados to outrun Adamant max Speed Choice Scarf Landorus-T after one Dragon Dance. An Adamant nature can be used for maximum damage output; however, a Jolly nature is preferred because with an Adamant nature, Gyarados can be revenge killed even after a Dragon Dance by Choice Scarf Landorus-T with Superpower or Rock Slide depending on whether it has Mega Evolved or not, respectively. Maximum Attack EVs guarantee maximum damage output. The remaining 12 EVs are put into HP. Intimidate is by far the best ability for Gyarados, as it allows Gyarados to set up Dragon Dances easier against physical attacker. Gyaradosite allows Gyarados to Mega Evolve and gain boosted stats as well as beat non-Mega Gyarados checks, such as Rotom-W. Lum Berry is a nice item choice to heal from status conditions such as burn and paralysis that will severely cripple Gyarados; using it will also open up a slot for a Mega Evolution on your team.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is better at times to delay Gyarados's Mega Evolution due to Intimidate and its type change. For example, against a Pokemon such as Ludicolo, it is best to Dragon Dance before Mega Evolving because, unlike Mega Gyarados, regular Gyarados isn't weak to Grass-type attacks. Pay attention to what Pokemon are currently out on the field, as you can use Gyarados's type change to your advantage. For example, you can Mega Evolve Gyarados on an incoming Psychic-type attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with access to Follow Me, such as Clefairy and Clefable, are great partners for Mega Gyarados because they can help it set up easier by redirecting super effective hits, such as Close Combat, and statuses away from Gyarados. Talonflame is a nice partner because it can check Grass-types that Gyarados has trouble hitting for massive damage. Talonflame is also immune to Earthquake, which can allow Gyarados to use it freely without worrying about damaging its partner, and is benefited greatly by Gyarados's ability to remove Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and opposing Rock-types. Aegislash can switch into Fighting-, Fairy-, and Rock-type attacks aimed at Gyarados while also being able to provide Wide Guard support for moves such as Rock Slide. Aegislash can also check Terrakion and Virizion, both of which are problems for Gyarados if it has not set up a Dragon Dance yet. Ground-types are really good partners for Gyarados. Landorus-T can switch into Fighting- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Gyarados while also being able to force out opposing Electric- and Rock-type Pokemon. Landorus is also benefited greatly by Gyarados's ability to remove Rotom-W. Mamoswine can force out Electric- and Rock-type Pokemon that threaten Gyarados; it is also able to deal massive damage to opposing Dragon-type Pokemon, such as Mega Salamence and Hydreigon, that Gyarados can't hit hard. If using non-Mega Gyarados, both Mega Metagross and Mega Venusaur are great partners for it. Gyarados plows through Fire-types that Metagross has trouble hitting, such as Heatran, as well as Ground-types like Landorus. Metagross, in turn, checks Rock-types, such as Terrakion, that give Gyarados troubles. These two together put a lot of pressure on the opponent's team. Mega Venusaur breaks through bulky Water-types that generally wall regular Gyarados, such as Rotom-W, and Rock-types. Gyarados, in turn, checks Fire-types, such as Heatran and Rotom-H, that threaten Venusaur.</p>"

Stone Edge can be used to OHKO Mega Charizard Y, which allows Gyarados to further support Steel-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP EVs with 108 Defense and an Impish nature optimize Sitrus Berry recovery and guarantee that a -1 Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge will only be a 3HKO after Sitrus Berry. 52 Attack EVs give Gyarados some offensive presence. 44 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Hydreigon won't OHKO with a Modest Choice Specs Draco Meteor and Sylveon will not 2HKO with Hyper Voice after Sitrus Berry. 52 Speed EVs allow Gyarados to outrun 80 Speed Heatran, Cresselia, and 0 Speed Rotom-A so that it can use Taunt. An alternative spread with 236 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature can be used to outrun positive max Speed base 80s such as Smeargle and Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T after it has been hit with an Icy Wind. Intimidate is by far the best ability as it increases Gyarados's bulk and cripples opposing physical attackers. Sitrus Berry is the preferred item, as it gives a one-time 25% HP boost unlike the passive recovery afforded by Leftovers. Lum Berry is an option if Sitrus Berry is already being used because it allows Gyarados to shut down Smeargle. Wacan Berry can help Gyarados tank an Electric-type attack that would otherwise OHKO or deal massive damage to it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Be sure to switch Gyarados in and out as required to Intimidate shuffle and cripple opposing physical attackers. Gyarados can switch into many physical attackers and cripple them, such as Talonflame and Mawile. Gyarados also works really well as a lead against Trick Room teams because it can Taunt the Trick Room user before they are able to set up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Strong attackers that benefit from the support that Gyarados provides generally make good partners. Mega Kangaskhan is benefits greatly from the Intimidate and speed control support that Gyarados provides, allowing it to outspeed threats that it normally wouldn't, such as Terrakion. Mega Charizard Y is also greatly benefited by Gyarados's speed control options as well as its ability to hit Heatran and Rotom-H for super effective damage. Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp are nice Gyarados partners, as they not only benefit from benefited by the support that Gyarados provides but also complement it really well by being able to switch into Rock- and Electric-type attacks. Mega Metagross synergizes really well with Gyarados, as it is able to check Rock-types that threaten Gyarados, thus increasing Gyarados's longevity and allowing Gyarados to further support its teammates. Gyarados can open opportunities for Mega Metagross to sweep by crippling faster threats with Thunder Wave and weakening their Attack with Intimidate. Mega Venusaur forms a really bulky anti-meta core with Gyarados because it is able to threaten and cripple common Pokemon such as Landorus-T. Mega Venusaur can check bulky Water-types that wall Gyarados while Gyarados checks Fire-types that wall Mega Venusaur.</p>"

  "Lapras": {
    "overview": "<p>Freeze-Dry makes Lapras very useful against rain and other teams heavy on Water-types, turning Pokemon with solid defensive typing such as Ludicolo on their head. It makes for a useful sixth member to a team if the rest of your team has a bad rain matchup, backed up by solid bulk emphasized well by an Assault Vest. Still, Lapras is slow, has a bad defensive typing, and is mostly outclassed by Suicune outside of hitting Water-types for super effective damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Items other than Assault Vest, such as Leftovers and Weakness Policy, can be used effectively. Be sure to invest some EVs in Special Defense and use Protect over the filler options in the forth moveslot if you opt out of Assault Vest. Lapras has a few other situational useful STAB moves worth considering, and among them are Blizzard, Surf, and Brine. Ancient Power and Psychic hit Mega Charizard Y and Mega Venusaur, respectively. Lapras also makes for an interesting Perish Song user for use on Perish trap teams. Finally, it might seem strange to not recommend Thunderbolt on a Pokemon that gets both it and Ice Beam, but Freeze-Dry's coverage almost completely outclasses Thunderbolt as a coverage option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Strong Fighting-type Attacks: Lapras's Ice-typing gives it many exploitable weaknesses. Jolly Terrakion has a very large chance to OHKO Lapras with Close Combat, which is guaranteed if it has any boosting item. Scrafty can comfortably take hits and leech massive amounts of HP away from Lapras with Drain Punch. Lapras's weight makes it vulnerable to Low Kicks from the likes of Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide: Lapras can tank a Rock Slide or two, but multiple will have it going down fast. Though Lapras can hurt them back significantly, Terrakion and Landorus-T are solid Rock Slide users for this purpose.</p> <p><strong>Double Targeting: As with most Assault Vest users, Lapras is weak to double targeting because it can't use Protect. Multiple heavy-hitting physical attacks will eventually bring Lapras down.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Freeze-Dry allows Lapras to tank hits from most Water-types and strike back for considerable damage. Hydro Pump, alongside Freeze-Dry, has fantastic coverage, hitting just about everything for neutral damage. Because of this, there is a lot of filler in the rest of Lapras's moveset. Ice Shard gives Lapras some occasionally useful priority. Sheer Cold can get Lapras an occasional lucky KO, Icy Wind gives Lapras some speed control, Ice Beam id Lapras's best Ice-type STAB move versus anything that's not a Water-type. Feel free to experiment with the last slot at your leisure.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread lets Lapras take two Zen Heabutts from Jolly Mega Metagross or a +1 Return from Jolly Mega Salamence while maintaining a solid Special Attack stat. The investment of EVs might look alarmingly strange considering there's much more defensive investment and not much in HP, but Lapras's HP stat is so large that investing in its defenses helps much more than investing in HP. Assault Vest lends so much special bulk already that very little investment is needed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Lapras to the game if you're up against rain or some other  Freeze-Dry-vulnerable team. Otheriwse, you should leave it behind. Lapras trades very favorably with Water-type tanks such as Ludicolo, Politoed, and Suicune. Try to take them out or severely weaken them for Lapras's teammates. Despite this, Lapras doesn't trade favorably with Rotom-W. Rotom-W can 2HKO or 3HKO Lapras, depending on how large Rotom-W's Special Attack investment is, while Lapras 3HKOes factoring in Sitrus. Lapras is slower, so it loses this encounter either way. Targeting Rotom-W with Lapras while its partner uses a spread move can work, however. Additionally, with Lapras's heavy defensive investment, it can take a single hit from Pokemon such as Landorus-T and most Salamence and OHKO them with Freeze-Dry.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that excel with Water-types gone, such as Landorus-T and Mega Metagross, like Lapras. Lapras benefits from a partner with Intimidate because most of the answers to it are physically based. Again, Landorus-T is great and the two complement each other wonderfully. Lapras synergizes well with Pokemon that can tank Rock- and Fighting-type attacks such as Aegislash, Mega Mawile, and Landorus-T. Lapras can operate well in Trick Room and has nice synergy with common Trick Room Pokemon. Amoonguss redirects Fighting-type attacks for Lapras and sets the Water slaughter into overdrive. Mega Mawile and Mega Camerupt really enjoy Lapras's ability to clear away Fire- and Water-types.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is the fastest user of Tailwind and the fastest support Pokemon in the metagame. However, it faces competition from other Tailwind users that possess more bulk, such as Togekiss and Suicune, with Aerodactyl's niches over them being its blistering Speed, its ability to disrupt teams with Sky Drop, and its ability to check Mega Charizard Y. Aerodactyl's weaknesses to many common types and its low bulk make it reliant on its Focus Sash. Aerodactyl is also checked by common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Rotom-W, as well as weather teams. Aerodactyl's Attack isn't the highest, so it is severely crippled by Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Aerodactylite is an option, but generally there are better Mega Evolutions to use. Earthquake hits Heatran; however, Aerodactyl already has limited moveslots. Stone Edge can be used over Rock Slide, as it bypasses Wide Guard and allows Aerodactyl to check Mega Charizard Y more reliably, but Aerodactyl's high Speed and Rock Slide's flinch chance make it a better choice over Stone Edge. Ice Fang is an alternate coverage move that hits Landorus-T hard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types, such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn, give Aerodactyl massive trouble. Aegislash has Wide Guard to protect its side from Aerodactyl's Rock Slide while also taking minimal damage from Sky Drop. Aegislash can also force out Aerodactyl with Flash Cannon, while Ferrothorn doesn't really care about either of Aerodactyl's attacks and can easily OHKO it with Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt shuts down both Tailwind and Protect. This makes Aerodactyl susceptible to being KOed due to its low bulk.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns</strong>: Intimidate and burns will lower Aerodactyl's damage output immensely, although getting flinches with Rock Slide and disrupting foes with Sky Drop are still important.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Speed control will lower Aerodactyl's blistering Speed, allowing foes to take advantage of its low bulk and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Weather</strong>: Hail, sand, and rain teams all threaten Aerodactyl. Hail teams have Blizzard users that can OHKO Aerodactyl, with the residual hail damage breaking its Focus Sash. Sand teams typically pack Sand Rush Excadrill, which outspeeds Aerodactyl and can deal massive damage to it with Iron Head, and rain teams utilize Swift Swim users, which can outspeed and OHKO Aerodactyl.</p>",

        "name": "Offensive Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Slide is Aerodactyl's best STAB move and is really useful with Aerodactyl's high Speed, which allows Aerodactyl to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame and potentially net crucial flinches. Sky Drop is a very disruptive support move that turns the battle into a 1v1 situation for a turn; it can also subdue a threat to Aerodactyl's partner for one turn. Keep in mind that Sky Drop will not work on any Pokemon weighing above 200 kg (440.9 lbs), such as Virizion and Terrakion. Wide Guard protects Aerodactyl and its partner from common spread moves, such as Rock Slide, while Taunt can be used to shut down status inducers or opposing speed control setters. Tailwind boosts the Speeds of Aerodactyl and its partner for three turns. Protect allows Aerodactyl to scout for opposing Fake Out users and acts as general protection against hits that can break Aerodactyl's Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Aerodactyl has really low bulk, so there isn't a need to invest into it. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Aerodactyl to take advantage of its high Speed so that it can set up Tailwind. Maximum Attack investment allows Aerodactyl to hit as hard as possible. Focus Sash allows Aerodactyl to survive at least one hit. Unnerve stops the foe's Berry from being eaten, which is very useful against Pokemon that generally carry Sitrus Berry such as Rotom-H and Thundurus.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Aerodactyl works great as a lead because a first-turn Tailwind can put massive pressure on your opponent. Be wary of Fake Out users, however. Don't sacrifice Aerodactyl after it has used Tailwind, as it can always be useful by disrupting the foe with Sky Drop or flinches from Rock Slide. Again, keep in mind that Sky Drop will not be able to pick up Pokemon that weigh 200 kg (440.9 lbs) or over, such as Virizion and Terrakion.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with middling Speed tiers that benefit greatly from Tailwind, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Gardevoir, are great partners with Aerodactyl. Notably, Mega Kangaskhan offers Fake Out support, which gives Aerodactyl an easier time to set up Tailwind. Aerodactyl, in turn, can allow Kangaskhan to set up with Power-Up Punch more easily by potentially immobilizing a threat for a turn with Sky Drop. Aerodactyl's Unnerve can also allow Mega Kangaskhan to beat Pokemon that are EVed to survive its attacks with a Sitrus Berry activating in between. Mega Charizard Y is protected by Aerodactyl's Wide Guard, while Aerodactyl can also remove bulky Fire-types, such as Rotom-H, that give Mega Charizard Y trouble. Mega Charizard Y, in turn, is able to check common Steel-types, such as Ferrothorn and Aegislash, that wall Aerodactyl's attacks. Heatran is another Pokemon with a middling Speed tier that greatly appreciates Tailwind, as well as Wide Guard to block Earthquake. Aerodactyl can also use Sky Drop to check Fighting-types and cripple a threat to Heatran so that it can set up a Substitute. Setup sweepers are also good partners for Aerodactyl due to its access to Sky Drop, which can give those sweepers an easier time setting up by crippling a threat. Gyarados is a great Aerodactyl partner, as Aerodactyl gives it an easier time setting up by using Sky Drop on a Pokemon that threatens Gyarados or offering Wide Guard support against Rock Slide. Although it doesn't benefit from Tailwind, Ferrothorn has great type synergy with Aerodactyl. Aerodactyl is able to protect Ferrothorn from Heat Wave with Wide Guard and can also threaten opposing Fire- and Fighting-types. Ferrothorn, in turn, can switch into Water-, Rock-, and Electric-type attacks aimed at Aerodactyl while also being able to force out opposing Ice-types. Other Steel-types, such as Aegislash, are great partners, as they can switch into Ice- and Rock-type attacks aimed at Aerodactyl. Aegislash also greatly benefits from Wide Guard, protecting it from common spread moves, such as Earthquake and Heat Wave.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Although the transition to Battle Spot Doubles has given Zapdos competition from mainly Thundurus, it is still a threat to consider. Having access to one of the best means of speed control in the metagame, Tailwind, and a solid base Special Attack of 125, Zapdos proves to be both a supportive and offensive threat. An excellent typing that gives it only two weaknesses combined with somewhat solid defensive stats allows Zapdos to stay alive longer than you'd expect. However, Zapdos is terribly weak to Rock Slide, one of the most common moves in Battle Spot Doubles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choiced variant of Zapdos with either Choice Scarf or Choice Specs is possible. This faces great competition from offensive Thundurus, but it is preferred over Thundurus at times because of Zapdos's access to Heat Wave. When using a more offensive variant, Volt Switch is an option to deal damage upon switching out and potentially get to respond immediately to a switch by the opponent the same turn. Safety Goggles lets Zapdos avoid moves such as Spore and Rage Powder and prevents it from getting worn down by sand and hail. Kee Berry is a niche pick that works for more bulky variants with Roost. Rocky Helmet also pairs well with Roost, punishing physical attackers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Spread Attacks: Spread attacks steadily chip away at Zapdos's HP as well as its teammate's. Zapdos is weak to the most common spread move in the metagame, Rock Slide, and even though they can only hit it neutrally, Pixilate Hyper Voice users also hit Zapdos very hard. Terrakion is probably the best Rock Slide user to stop Zapdos, as unlike many of the other users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, it does not fear Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Bulky attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Venusaur, Heatran, and Sylveon can soak up Zapdos's hits and deal plenty of damage in return.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers: Zapdos doesn't have the best of bulk, and powerful neutral STAB attacks such as Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave hit harder than it would like.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Typing Advantage: Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt and don't care about Heat Wave or Hidden Power Ice can easily deal with Zapdos. Rotom-H completely walls Zapdos, and if Zapdos does not carry Hidden Power Ice, Dragon-types don't have a problem either.</p>",

Thunderbolt lets Zapdos hit Water- and Flying-types such as Suicune and Talonflame, respectively, hard. Hidden Power Ice is mainly used to give Zapdos a way to beat Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Garchomp. Alternatively, Heat Wave is an option to give Zapdos a spread move, especially if your team already has these threats covered. It also provides coverage on Grass- and Steel-types such as Amoonguss and Bisharp, respectively. Roost gives Zapdos more longevity. Protect is an option to guard Zapdos against status attacks and double targeting.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry gives Zapdos one-time instant recovery. Alternatively, Expert Belt boosts the power of super effective moves, and it is best used when running both Hidden Power Ice and Heat Wave. 156 Speed EVs let Zapdos outrun positive-natured Smeargle. 252 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature maximize damage output. The rest are dumped into HP for some bulk. An alternative, more bulky spread would be 252 HP / 36 Def / 52 SpA / 148 SpD / 20 Spe. This lets Zapdos survive neutral-natured Kangaskhan's Double-Edge without Sitrus Berry as well as a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Hydreigon, and the Speed EVs let Zapdos outspeed neutral-natured Bisharp. Alternatively, 116 Speed EVs allow Zapdos to outspeed positive-natured Breloom.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Tailwind on the first turn can give you an advantageous position, which could easily decide the match. However, using Tailwind in the later turns of the match can also provide crucial momentum. If your opponent has Pokemon that often carry Taunt, such as Thundurus and Whimsicott, avoiding the obvious Tailwind and attacking instead will often pay off. Always try to avoid taking too many Rock Slides, as they hit Zapdos harder than it would like. Because Zapdos is also known to run bulky sets, keep in mind that your damage output may catch your opponents off guard.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty are great partners for Zapdos, giving it more freedom to set up Tailwind. Pokemon that enjoy Tailwind such as Breloom, Heatran, Sylveon, and Mega Kangaskhan work well together with Zapdos. To cover Zapdos's weaknesses, Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mega Metagross are great. Wide Guard support is good to block Rock Slide, and Pokemon such as Aegislash and Swampert are good for this. Because Zapdos can easily deal with Suicune, Pokemon that fear Suicune such as Terrakion, Heatran, and Mega Metagross can be good picks for teammates.</p>"

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<p>Azumarill presents itself as a highly versatile attacker for teams, able to fulfill a variety of roles. It is foremost one of the best setup sweepers in the metagame thanks to its access to both Aqua Jet and Belly Drum. This alone is enough to put pressure on your opponent right from Team Preview. Its good defensive stats and plentiful resistances also aid its ability to set up and allow it to be an effective switch-in when used with Assault Vest. Water / Fairy typing is additionally great offensively, as Fairy imparts good neutral coverage and Water deals with Fire-types and many popular Steel-types. Heatran is a notable example of this, as while it ordinarily has a great matchup against Fairies, it struggles against Azumarill. Azumarill's low Speed stat is somewhat of a weakness, as foes that resist or take little damage from Aqua Jet can prove to be problematic. However, this is something that can be patched up through the use of speed control such as Trick Room. Finally, while its weaknesses are few, they do still leave it threatened by Pokemon prominent in the metagame, such as Thundurus and Amoonguss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Return can be used over Play Rough on the Belly Drum set, following a similar line of reasoning to that of Knock Off, where hitting both Water- and Fairy-resistant foes such as Amoonguss neutrally is desirable. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall on the latter two sets if you'd prefer additional power, but Azumarill already has an equally powerful STAB move in Play Rough, and trading away the option for a more accurate STAB move is generally unwise. Ice Punch is a decent option on the Assault Vest set to sometimes OHKO Landorus-T after Intimidate, as well as to deal decent damage to Grass-types such as Amoonguss. Sitrus Berry with three attacking moves and Protect can be used as a bulky alternative to Assault Vest, but it's mostly outclassed by it. Lum Berry is another option on a three attacks set to help Azumarill deal with status such as burn, although it's usually better to prevent status with team support and not have to sacrifice an item. The final option on such a set is Life Orb, which would grant Azumarill some of the immediate power of Choice Band while retaining the ability to switch moves. However, sacrificing HP with every attack cuts into Azumarill's otherwise great bulk, which is one of its selling points. If you're feeling adventurous, a set of Perish Song, Dive, Light Screen, and Protect can be used to assist PerishTrap teams in picking up KOs. Sap Sipper, Sitrus Berry, and EVs of 252 HP / 108 Def / 148 SpD are recommended for this should you wish to try it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: While Electric-types can struggle to safely switch into Azumarill's attacks, they're often the most effective at eliminating it. Bulky Thundurus can either put Azumarill into a HP range where it can't use Belly Drum even after Sitrus Berry recovery with Thunderbolt or use Taunt to prevent its use directly. Offensive Thundurus can outright OHKO Azumarill even without a boosting item. It also makes an excellent Safety Goggles user, allowing it to bypass Azumarill's common partner, Amoonguss. Zapdos sports an equally high base Special Attack, and its superior defensive stats allow it to take Azumarill's attacks better. Rotom-W resists Azumarill's Water-type attacks thanks to its own Water typing and retaliates hard with its Electric-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Grass-types have a solid matchup against Azumarill thanks to their resistance to Water and ability to hit Azumarill super effectively with their STAB moves. Further, they ignore powder moves such as Rage Powder, allowing them to bypass its redirection. Amoonguss's Poison typing causes it to resist Fairy in addition to Water, allowing it to tank Azumarill's attacks with relative ease. It's worth noting, though, that Azumarill's Belly Drum set can still threaten an OHKO at +6 when using Knock Off, so it's potentially not an entirely one-sided matchup. Ferrothorn's Steel typing likewise enables it to resist Fairy-type attacks and it can threaten Azumarill with a strong Power Whip. Ludicolo, while taking significant damage from Play Rough, 4x resists Water and deals good damage with Giga Drain. Its access to Scald also makes Azumarill more difficult to switch in, as it risks a 30% chance of burn.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y: Mega Charizard Y's Drought weakens Azumarill's Water-type attacks, improving its team's matchup against it significantly, and enables the immediate use of Solar Beam to threaten Azumarill. It does have to be fairly bulky to have a chance at surviving a +6 Aqua Jet itself, though, given its weakness to Water.</p> <p><strong>Talonflame</strong>: Talonflame's Gale Wings ability allows it to move before Azumarill's Aqua Jet thanks to its higher Speed stat, and its access to Quick Guard means it's capable of blocking Aqua Jet's use entirely. When holding a Choice Band, it also has an excellent chance to OHKO an Azumarill that reduced its health with Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burn</strong>: As Azumarill is a physical attacker, any means of reducing its Attack stat will hinder it significantly. Intimidate users such as Salamence and Mawile lower Azumarill's Attack stat by one stage when they switch in. Note that the Belly Drum set is less affected by this, as it raises Azumarill's Attack to +6 regardless of the drop. Burns from Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-W, Talonflame, and Gengar halve Azumarill's Attack stat and inflict chip damage equivalent to 1/8 of maximum HP, which helps impede Azumarill's otherwise good longevity.</p>",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Belly Drum",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Belly Drum maximizes Azumarill's Attack at the cost of half its HP, granting it the potential to sweep through the opposing team. Aqua Jet provides the set with a priority STAB move that, while initially weak, can OHKO foes after a Belly Drum boost before they can move. It's worth noting that at +6 it still falls short of OHKOing particularly bulky foes like Mega Kangaskhan and bulky Thundurus, though. That's where Play Rough comes in. It provides a secondary STAB move capable of OHKOing the majority of foes that would not be OHKOed by Aqua Jet. Knock Off is an alternative that prevents Azumarill from being walled by foes like Amoonguss and Ferrothorn. However, using Knock Off significantly hampers Azumarill's ability to offensively check certain Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Scrafty. Further, it weakens Azumarill's matchup against Mega Salamence, which is otherwise able to OHKO Azumarill even without a boost. Protect shields Azumarill for a turn, allowing a partner to KO a threat to Azumarill or switch to improve positioning.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry is an important component to the set, recovering 25% of Azumarill's HP after Belly Drum is used, allowing it to remain reasonably healthy even after setting up. Huge Power pushes Azumarill's Attack stat from subpar to excellent and is required in order to put on offensive pressure. An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs are used in order to maximize Azumarill's damage output. Removing any Attack EVs is not recommended, as Huge Power means that Azumarill will lose double the number of stat points compared to other Pokemon. While the bulk EVs may appear complex, they're merely the most efficient distribution of overall bulk possible. With that said, they do notably make Azumarill's HP a multiple of both 4 and 2, which is important for Sitrus Berry. The former makes Sitrus Berry's recovery a greater percentage of Azumarill's total health, and the latter ensures that Sitrus Berry will activate after Belly Drum is used from full health. You may opt to take EVs out of bulk and place them into Speed in order to outpace certain threats after the use of a teammate's speed control move. For example, 92 Speed EVs allow Azumarill to outrun -1 neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon like Breloom, while 12 Speed EVs let it outpace -1 Rotom-A. If Azumarill is used on a Trick Room team, then drop the Speed EVs and use a Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Azumarill most often finds the opportunity to set up late-game alongside a redirector or Fake Out user, after the opponent's Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon have been KOed. However, if the opposing team is not particularly threatening to Azumarill, simply leading with it may be the optimal choice; this presents an easy way to get Azumarill onto the field safely and with the proper support. Try to avoid switching Azumarill into damaging moves in order to preserve its HP for setting up with Belly Drum. This means you'll often want to switch Azumarill in after a teammate has been KOed. As for which foes are ideal to start setting up on, Fighting-types and more defensive foes such as Cresselia make prime candidates. Should you feel setting up to be a daunting task but still need Azumarill's coverage, it's still possible to just play Azumarill as a bulky attacker with Sitrus Berry. In that scenario, Play Rough will generally be the superior move choice, as an unboosted Aqua Jet often struggles to do much damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A redirection or Fake Out user is essential to grant Azumarill the opportunity to set up. Rage Powder Amoonguss is generally the best choice for redirection, as it resists the Electric- and Grass-type attacks Azumarill is weak to. Alternatives such as Rage Powder Volcarona, which resists Grass, might also be fine depending on your team composition. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan, Raichu, and Weavile can also protect Azumarill by immobilizing a problematic foe for a turn, which may be all Azumarill needs to set up. Mega Kangaskhan enjoys being defended against Fighting-types by Azumarill's Fairy typing, Raichu can protect Azumarill against Electric-type moves thanks to its Lightning Rod ability, and Weavile does a great job at eliminating the Grass-types that threaten Azumarill. Other allies that can beat the Grass-types that often wall Azumarill, particularly when you're not using Knock Off, are highly desirable. Fire-types such as Heatran, Arcanine, and Mega Charizard Y can hit them hard with their super effective STAB moves. Mega Charizard Y is interesting in that although Drought weakens Aqua Jet, it otherwise threatens Grass-types the most out of the aforementioned three. Flying-types such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame likewise prove effective at eliminating Grass-types. For dealing with the Electric-types that also threaten Azumarill, Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mamoswine make great choices. Mamoswine is particularly notable, as its Ice typing further allows it to hit Grass-types hard. Bear in mind, though, that most Ground-types will still struggle against Rotom-W thanks to its Ground immunity and STAB Hydro Pump.</p>"

        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Play Rough is Azumarill's strongest physical STAB move at 90 Base Power, although its 90% accuracy leaves something to be desired. However, this set also features Waterfall, which grants Azumarill a 100% accurate STAB move to use in situations where the additional power of Play Rough is unneeded to achieve a KO. A Water-type attack also threatens many of the foes that resist Fairy such as Fire-types and some Steel-types such as Heatran. Aqua Jet, while weaker than Waterfall, is useful for picking off weakened foes because of its priority. Knock Off deals good damage to foes such as Aegislash and Cresselia, which take little from Azumarill's other attacks, and has utility in removing items. Superpower's high Base Power allows it to OHKO foes like 4 HP Mega Kangaskhan at the cost of dropping two of Azumarill's best stats in Attack and Defense. It also provides coverage for foes like Ferrothorn, which although not OHKOed by the move, take significant damage from it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Assault Vest allows Azumarill to more easily switch into special attacks by granting it a 50% boost to Special Defense. Huge Power is an easy ability choice, as doubling Azumarill's Attack stat grants a huge increase to its damage output. An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs are used to allow Azumarill to hit as hard as possible. It's not recommended to take any EVs out of Attack, as Huge Power means that each stat point is worth double what it normally is. The remaining EVs are invested mostly in HP to improve overall bulk, moving just enough to Defense for Azumarill to survive a Double-Edge from Jolly Mega Kangaskhan. If you don't mind sacrificing bulk, Azumarill's Speed EVs can be increased to allow it to outpace certain foes after speed control. For example, 92 Speed EVs allow Azumarill to outrun -1 neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon like Breloom, and 12 Speed EVs allow Azumarill to outpace -1 Rotom-A. Do bear in mind that you'll want to avoid giving up too much bulk, since being bulky is the whole point of the set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set functions as a reliable switch-in against special attackers that threaten Azumarill's allies and deals immediate damage to them in return. For this reason, it should preferably start by being off the field and ready to switch in, rather than be a lead. Since this Azumarill set is the one most debilitated by Intimidate, doing so also helps it avoid the associated Attack drop. Further, it improves the chances of Azumarill picking off weakened foes in the late-game with Aqua Jet. Although lacking STAB, Knock Off will often find itself an excellent choice of move, as the majority of switch-ins to Azumarill's attacks don't appreciate losing their items. Don't be too afraid to take on special attackers that Azumarill has a type disadvantage against. For example, this Azumarill can beat many Thundurus and Gengar one-on-one with the combination of a strong attack followed up by an Aqua Jet. An exception would be against Scald users, as the high chance to burn means Azumarill could potentially be crippled for the remainder of the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Azumarill has a hard time dealing with Grass-types, so partners that can handle them are recommended. Fire-types such as Heatran, Arcanine, and Volcarona make good options, particularly when equipped with Safety Goggles to put a stop to the popular Amoonguss. Arcanine is especially notable out of the three, as its Intimidate rounds out Azumarill's defenses by weakening both foes' Attack stats. Volcarona also has access to both Rage Powder and Tailwind as a means of supporting Azumarill. Mega Charizard Y joins the aforementioned Fire-types, although you should bear in mind that Drought weakens Azumarill's Water-type attacks. Flying-types such as Mega Salamence, Talonflame, and Togekiss are just as able to beat Grass-types. All three of the aforementioned are also able to provide Tailwind support to help Azumarill outpace much of its otherwise quicker competition. A final option for dealing with Grass-types is Ice-types such as Weavile, Abomasnow, and Mamoswine, which deal heavy damage to them with their various STAB moves. Mamoswine also joins other Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp in being able to check the Electric-types that likewise threaten Azumarill. Landorus-T is notably akin to Arcanine in its ability to provide Intimidate support. Grass- and Electric-types of your own such as Amoonguss and Thundurus may moreover prove valuable for their ability to power through Water-types, which Azumarill might otherwise struggle against offensively. Thundurus additionally provides speed control in the form of Thunder Wave, and Amoonguss can redirect otherwise super effective Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Azumarill with Rage Powder.</p>"

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Aqua Jet provides Azumarill with a priority STAB move that is reasonably powerful thanks to the boost from Choice Band. When priority is unneeded, Play Rough pulls through as Azumarill's hardest-hitting STAB move. All three of the types Play Rough hits super effectively are common in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame, making it particularly compelling. Waterfall serves as both a harder-hitting alternative to Aqua Jet and a more consistent backup to the 90% accurate Play Rough. Superpower's high Base Power allows it to OHKO the majority of foes that are hit super effectively by it. Knock Off is an alternative should you need the Dark-type coverage to power through foes such as Aegislash and Cresselia, but being locked into it isn't great, as it loses potency after the first hit.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Band boosts Azumarill's Attack stat by 50%, granting it a substantial increase in damage output. Huge Power is one of the best abilities in the game, as it doubles the user's Attack stat, making it an essential component to an Azumarill set aiming to be as immediately threatening as possible. An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs are similarly used to augment Azumarill's damage output. Removing any Attack EVs is not recommended, as they're indispensable to the set's goal, and Huge Power means that the associated stat drop is double that of normal. The remaining investment improves overall bulk as much as possible while ensuring that Jolly Mega Kangaskhan cannot OHKO Azumarill with Double-Edge. If Azumarill is used alongside speed control such as Icy Wind, Speed investment can be increased to better take advantage of it. For example, 92 Speed EVs allow Azumarill to outpace -1 neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Breloom. 12 Speed EVs are also an option to outrun -1 uninvested Rotom-A. If Azumarill is used on a team featuring Trick Room, you may opt for a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs instead in order to move sooner when under its effect.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In comparison to Azumarill's other options, this set has the greatest amount of power for immediate pressure. Try to bring Azumarill out in the mid- to late-game when an allied Pokemon's speed control has taken effect. Even without speed control, this increases the chance that Azumarill can KO weakened foes with Aqua Jet. An alternative approach is to lead with Azumarill with the intent of bluffing the Belly Drum set, with the ideal scenario being that a foe attempts to use a move like Taunt and must take a powerful boosted attack in return. Be mindful of making the right prediction, as being locked into an ineffectual move is an easy way to force Choice Band Azumarill out. This is especially the case when using Superpower, as the stat drops incurred by the move further punish a good switch from your opponent.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Partners that deal with Grass-types are a great starting point when picking teammates for Azumarill, as they're highly problematic for it. Fire-types such as Heatran, Arcanine, and Volcarona can accomplish this, particularly when equipped with Safety Goggles to thwart powder moves such as Spore. Volcarona is a distinctly good partner, as it can support Azumarill with moves such as Tailwind and Rage Powder. Mega Charizard Y is another Fire-type that threatens Grass-types, but be aware that Drought weakens Azumarill's Water-type attacks. Flying-types such as Mega Salamence, Talonflame, and Staraptor are options proficient at handling Grass-types. All three are additionally able to use Tailwind to patch up Azumarill's otherwise mediocre Speed stat. Alternatively, Ice-types such as Weavile, Abomasnow, and Mamoswine can deal with Grass-types using their own super effective STAB moves. Mamoswine, like other Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Garchomp, moreover provides the benefit of checking Electric-types for Azumarill. Electric- and Grass-type partners such as Thundurus and Amoonguss are also advised in order to deal with Water-types, which Azumarill might otherwise struggle against offensively. Thundurus's ability to provide speed control in Thunder Wave makes it especially useful, while Amoonguss's Rage Powder can defend Azumarill against the Electric- and Grass-type attacks it's weak to.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Overall, Politoed makes for a great support Pokemon due to its movepool and ability Drizzle; however, a lot of Battle Spot Doubles players know to bring Grass- and Electric-type coverage to deal with Politoed, which slightly hinders its effectiveness in Battle Spot Doubles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set is viable; rain makes Politoed's Water-type attacks hit surprisingly hard. Other offensive sets aren't terrible either, especially with Trick Room. Hidden Power Electric gives Politoed coverage against Water-types, but it's weak and only marginally stronger than a resisted rain-boosted Scald. Eject Button can be used as an alternative to Leftovers if Politoed is being used solely for rain, with the free switch helping maintain your team's momentum.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon with Super Effective Attacks</strong>: Grass-types resist Politoed's STAB attacks and can hit it super effectively in return. Amoonguss and opposing Ludicolo give Politoed a very hard time.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: A Drought, Sand Stream, or Snow Warning user can switch in and remove Drizzle's rain. Having a random Sunny Day user can be effective as well.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Attacks</strong> Powerful electric attacks from Pokemon such as Thundurus are great against Politoed, but unless they resist Water like Rotom-W or Rotom-C, Politoed's Water-type attacks are going to hurt.</p>",

Politoed can provide speed control with Icy Wind or utilize a more powerful coverage move in Ice Beam. With Helping Hand, Politoed can boost the power of its partner. Encore lets Politoed punish attacks like Fake Out and Protect. Perish Song is used to guarantee a win condition if the opponent is down to their last two Pokemon. Protect is used for scouting out moves that can harm Politoed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With the EVs put into HP and Defense, Politoed can survive Mega Mawile's Play Rough. The Special Attack EVs allow Politoed to OHKO uninvested Landorus-T with an Ice Beam or rain-boosted Scald. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense. Politoed can also use Leftovers or Wacan Berry if a different Pokemon on the team has a Sitrus Berry already.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Politoed empowers weather abusers, but that doesn't mean you should fill your team with them. Being overly dependent on rain will make your team very ineffective. Rain isn't something to be dependent on; it should be thought of more as a helpful boost. Additionally, you can challenge Mega Charizard Y's sun with Politoed if Charizard has Mega Evolved already. If it hasn't, Politoed can't challenge it without a partner faster than Mega Charizard Y with Rain Dance.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ludicolo is Politoed's go-to partner, as it has a more useful offensive typing than other Swift Swim users such as Kingdra. Ludicolo's Fake Out is also very useful. While Kingdra is still a good teammate for Politoed, the lack of Dragon Gem makes it less powerful than in previous years. Talonflame works well with Politoed and Ludicolo, despite its Fire-type moves being weakened in the rain. The three of them make a pretty good core to build around. Mega Swampert works too, but then there needs to be another Pokemon with Grass-type coverage on the team to take care of Rotom-W. Strong Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Thundurus-T like to capitalize on Politoed's rain for perfectly accurate Thunders. Steel-types also benefit from Politoed and its Drizzle because the rain weakens Fire-type moves. Metagross, Mawile, and especially Ferrothorn love this. Politoed can't bust through Water- and Grass-types that well, so a partner that can hit these types for strong super effective damage synergize well with Politoed. If Politoed is being used in a Perish Trap team, Mega Gengar or Gothitelle is a mandatory partner.</p>"

Hidden Power Grass is used for coverage against Rotom-W. Alternatively, Rain Dance can be used for refreshing the rain for the team if Charizard Mega Evolves or Mega Charizard Y switches in, and Encore is an option to allow Politoed to lock the foe into a status move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature with maximum Speed investment and Choice Scarf allows Politoed to outspeed every Pokemon up to base 130 Speed, such as the rare Crobat; it notably lets it outspeed and OHKO 0 HP Jolly Mega Salamence with Ice Beam. To accommodate for Hidden Power Grass's IV drop, 4 EVs are moved from Special Attack to Defense; use 252 Special Attack EVs if you opt not to run Hidden Power Grass.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using this variant of Politoed, don't let it take too many hits, as it has no defensive investment. Try to snipe Pokemon with Hydro Pump and Ice Beam so that the opposing threats are taken out faster. Additionally, don't make your team overly dependent on Politoed's Drizzle; rain should complement your team, not be its centerpiece.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ludicolo works well with this Politoed set, as it can help with dual offensive coverage. Talonflame works well too, as its Flying-type coverage complements Politoed's attacks nicely. Kingdra and Mega Swampert also make for useful Swift Swim users. Ferrothorn and other Steel-types are good teammates for Politoed because the rain temporarily nerfs the power of Fire-type moves.

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Although the loss of Steel Gem weakened Scizor by not allowing it to Bullet Punch snipe, Scizor is still a good Pokemon in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame due to its great typing, which is only weak to Fire, as well as its decent bulk and many resistances. Scizor also boasts great offensive stats and Bug / Steel typing, which is a nice offensive typing due to the rise of Fairy-types such as Sylveon. Scizor, however, faces competition from similar Steel-types such as Bisharp, which is \"immune\" to Intimidate, and Mega Mawile. Scizor is also easily walled by common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Thundurus, Heatran, and Aegislash. Like most physical attackers, Scizor is severely crippled by Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, both of which are very common.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Occa Berry is an option to mitigate Scizor's Fire weakness; however, even with it, Scizor still needs quite a lot of Special Defense investment to survive even common weaker Heat Waves. Choice Band is another option for maximum damage output; however, many common Pokemon, such as Heatran and Thundurus, resist Scizor's STAB and priority moves, so it isn't very helpful to be locked into one move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types completely counter Scizor, as they resist both of its STAB moves and can KO it with relative ease. Heatran, Rotom-H, and Mega Charizard Y are all major counters to Scizor.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Many common Steel-types, such as Aegislash and Heatran, can completely wall Scizor and can either KO it or use it as setup fodder. Other Pokemon include Excadrill and Mega Lucario, both of which resist Scizor's STAB moves. Ferrothorn, if Scizor does not carry Bug Bite, can be a big pain as well due to Iron Barbs as well as its ability to recover damage with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate/Burn: Intimidate and burn are less of an issue due to Swords Dance, but they can still cripple Scizor, lessening its damage output.</p>",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Scizor's Attack to scary levels and mitigates the effects of Intimidate and burn. Bullet Punch is Scizor's best priority move and works really well when combined with Swords Dance. Knock Off has more utility than Bug Bite, as some bulkier Pokemon such as Cresselia tend to run other items instead of Sitrus Berry, and it also allows Scizor to hit Aegislash, one of Scizor's biggest counters, for super effective damage. Bug Bite, however, has more power than Knock Off and is arguably a better answer to most Rotom-W variants, as it can steal the foe's Sitrus Berry instead of just knocking it off. Protect is an important move for Scizor because once it gets a Swords Dance boost, your opponent will most likely double target Scizor to take it out before it can do any major damage. In that case, using Protect will buy you a turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature maximize Scizor's damage output. A Brave nature can be used over Adamant should you choose to run Scizor on a Trick Room team. Maximum HP EVs give Scizor more bulk; Speed investment isn't too necessary on Scizor, as it will be using Bullet Punch most of the time. Lum Berry is usually the preferred item, as it allows Scizor to heal from a status condition (more than likely a burn) which will come in handy quite a lot of times. Scizorite is another item choice that can help Scizor set up Swords Dance easier, as Mega Scizor has greater bulk. Finally, Life Orb is another option should you want to increase Scizor's damage output even more.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Most of the time, Scizor will rely on Bullet Punch as its main attacking move. Knock Off is another spammable move and should be used against bulky foes such as Thundurus or a Pokemon that will be crippled without its item, such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T. If running Bug Bite instead, it should be used when a Pokemon that resists Bullet Punch is out or when you suspect the Pokemon is carrying a Sitrus Berry. Due to Scizor's natural bulk as well as its Steel typing, it can switch into many Pokemon with ease, such as Sylveon, Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Metagross, and Mega Venusaur, and set up a Swords Dance.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can threaten out Fire-types are great partners for Scizor. For example, Landorus-T can provide Intimidate support, which further increases Scizor's bulk, as well as hit Fire-types such as Heatran super effectively with Earthquake and Rotom-H, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame with Rock Slide or Stone Edge. Scizor fits very well on a rain team due to the rain weakening Fire-type attacks. Bulky Water-types are wonderful partners for Scizor, too; Milotic is able to check many Fire-types as well as discourage Intimidate due to Competitive. Rotom-W and Suicune are also great partners that check Fire-types; the former is able to cripple physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp and the latter offers speed control and Snarl support. Dragon-types, such as Latios and Hydreigon, are good partners as well, as Scizor can switch into Fairy- and Dragon-type moves aimed at them with relative ease as well as check Fairy-types that threaten them.</p>"

Porygon2 also provides valuable speed control for teams in Trick Room and Thunder Wave, and although it faces strong competition from Cresselia, it sets itself apart from the latter due to its Normal typing, more reliable recovery, and abilities.

Despite all this, Porygon2 can find itself being very passive with without offensive investment, dealing little damage to Pokemon that aren't weak to its coverage moves. Another issue with Porygon2 is that it needs to run Eviolite, which prevents it from running other useful items such as Mental Herb and Sitrus Berry. Taunt is a common move that can stop Porygon2 from setting up Trick Room or spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave.

Gravity allows Porygon2 to run higher-Base Power moves such as Blizzard and Thunder and allows teammates such as Landorus-T to spam Earthquake or even the likes of Mega Gengar to use a very accurate Hypnosis. Swagger gives Porygon2 a chance to create free turns, but the risk of boosting a physical attacker's Attack by two stages is not worth it most of the time. Download could be used over Trace, as this allows Porygon2 to deal more damage if it gains a boost to Special Attack; however, there are many specially defensive threats in Battle Spot Doubles, which can boost Porygon2's unused Attack stat instead.

If using Thunder Wave, move 4 EVs from Defense to Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Porygon2 should be used to check and cripple powerful attackers in Battle Spot Doubles such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, Mega Charizard Y, Thundurus, and Gengar with Thunder Wave and Ice Beam. Be wary of Knock Off users such as Bisharp and Scrafty, as the removal of Porygon2's Eviolite can turn it into a liability on most teams, and be wary of Fighting-types and Steel-types, as the former can deal massive damage to Porygon2 with their powerful STAB moves and the latter take little damage from Porygon2's moves; Aegislash and Heatran can also use Substitute against Porygon2, and Ferrothorn doesn't mind absorbing paralysis. If using Trick Room, set it up as early as possible, and keep Porygon2 as healthy as possible for setting up Trick Room again in the late-game so slow Pokemon such as Azumarill and Mega Mawile can sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can beat the Fighting-types that trouble Porygon2, while Porygon2 can set up Trick Room for them. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr, Terrakion, and Breloom can beat powerful Knock Off users such as Bisharp and Scrafty, both of which heavily pressure Porygon2 with Knock Off, while they like having Mega Salamence removed for them. Fighting-types also remove Steel-types that can wall Porygon2, such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Pokemon that generally appreciate speed control in Thunder Wave such as Entei, Azumarill, Heatran, Bisharp, and Breloom work well with Porygon2, as they can pressure teams easily when they outspeed their foes. Pokemon such as Azumarill, Mega Mawile, and Mega Camerupt appreciate Trick Room support from Porygon2, as they become very powerful and threatening sweepers when Trick Room is up.</p>"

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Smeargle is a entirely unique Pokemon due to it being the only one that learns the move Sketch, which allows Smeargle to learn any move in the entire game. This is Smeargle's saving grace, as it has an awful base 35 Defense and 45 Special Defense. Its base 75 Speed gives Smeargle the ability to do its job well enough. However, Smeargle is easily shut down by common Prankster and fast Pokemon with Taunt such as Thundurus and Talonflame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Even with its endless movepool, Smeargle is very limited in the items it can use effectively. Running Choice Scarf over Focus Sash can allow Smeargle to outspeed most of the metagame. However, this will make Smeargle huge Taunt bait and cause it to lose all the versatility it could possibly have. Smeargle could also run Encore or Taunt to increase its usefulness outside of Dark Void spam; however, Whimsicott and other common Prankster users like Thundurus do that much better. Smeargle could also run Trick Room to allow slower Pokemon to move faster, but this generally goes against Smeargle's goal of outspeeding and putting as much to sleep as possible. Wide Guard and Quick Guard can protect Smeargle from the priority or common spread moves such as Hyper Voice and Rock Slide that threaten it. The final useful move choice would be Transform. Smeargle would most likely use Transform when paired with or against a Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan or Mega Salamence and with an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe, as the only useful stat Smeargle has when it Transforms is HP. Finally, Own Tempo can be run over Moody as a much more reliable ability, even if you miss out on key stat boost that could win you games, due to Own Tempo not having a chance to lower useful stats such as Accuracy and Speed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves: Multi-hit moves can break Smeargle's Focus Sash, defeating the purpose of running it to survive at least one attack from a foe. The main threats to look out for are Mega Kangaskhan and Double Kick Terrakion, as both of these Pokemon are able to outspeed Smeargle and KO it with their multi-hit moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Pokemon with priority moves can usually break Smeargle's Focus Sash, not giving it a chance to use Dark Void at all. There are many priority users in the current format, with some of the most popular including Conkeldurr, Talonflame, Breloom, Metagross, and Infernape.</p> <p><strong>Status Prevention: Status prevention stops Smeargle from spamming Dark Void and doing its only job. The moves, items, and ability that stop Smeargle are Safeguard, Taunt, Substitute, Chesto Berry, Lum Berry, and Insomnia.</p> <p><strong>Damaging Weather</strong>: Hail and sand take away 1/16 of Smeargle's HP, breaking its Focus Sash or KOing it once the Focus Sash has been broken.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dark Void puts both opposing Pokemon to sleep and can completely turn around a match. Once the foes are asleep, Smeargle's teammates are free to set up; Follow Me can be used to keep your sweeper from taking damage or being statused. However, due to Smeargle's incredibly low defensive stats, be aware that this is almost always a one-time use strategy. Spiky Shield protects Smeargle from Taunt users and damages foes that target Smeargle with physical attacks that turn. Running King's Shield is incredibly risky, as it still leaves Smeargle susceptible to Taunt and other status conditions, although it does allow it to cripple physical attackers. Tailwind can be used in the final slot to give both Smeargle and its teammates a Speed boost, and Fake Out can be run to incapacitate a threat for one turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Speed EVs allow Smeargle to be as fast as possible so that it can spam Dark Void and put foes to sleep. The 252 EVs in Defense let Smeargle survive a Power-Up Punch from Mega Kangaskhan. Moody is an unreliable ability, but it can be beneficial, as getting an accuracy boost can put you in a good spot for the entire match. Just remember to watch Smeargle's boosts and react accordingly to each one. Focus Sash is needed so that Smeargle is not OHKOed and is able to at least use Dark Void once.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Leading with Smeargle and going for Dark Void or Fake Out is generally the best option, as it is very difficult to switch it in later in the match without breaking its Focus Sash. You can continue to spam Dark Void or Follow Me so that your attackers can safely set up. Be careful when using Follow Me, as Smeargle's defenses usually only allow it to use the move once. When Smeargle is facing a Taunt user, the best option is to use Spiky Shield and then Taunt or KO the foe.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan is one of the best partners for Smeargle, as it is completely free to set up with Power-Up Punches or just dish out crazy damage after Smeargle uses Dark Void. It can also use Fake Out to guarantee that Smeargle can Dark Void the first turn. Other setup sweepers such as Mega Salamence, Azumarill, and Scizor are also generally good partners for Smeargle. Another strategy is to pair Smeargle with Perish Song Mega Gengar, as Smeargle can spam Dark Void for the three Perish Song turns, making the foes unable to react.</p>"

  "Hitmontop": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmontop took a big hit in viability for Battle Spot Doubles. It lost Fighting Gem and Sucker Punch, and its weaknesses are now much more common. It's gone from a top-rate threat to an uncommon Pokemon relegated to mostly supportive uses. Still, its Fighting-type STAB coupled with Intimidate and its large support movepool is as usable as ever.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stone Edge or Payback can be used over any of the final support options on the main set if you're turned off by mono-Fighting coverage. Eject Button allows Hitmontop to get a Fake Out and Intimidate off, then switch out and do it all over again. However, the Eject Button can be a burden if you want Hitmontop to attack the foe. Roseli Berry and an EV investment of 252 HP / 28 SpD allow Hitmontop to survive even Choice Specs Sylveon's Hyper Voice. Hitmontop should be using Wide Guard to protect itself from the move most of the time, though. Hitmontop generally doesn't have enough space in its move set to use Protect or Detect, as it needs to be using a wide variety of support attacks to stay useful. Mach Punch gives Hitmontop some useful, although very weak, priority. It's good for sniping Bisharp, which likes having a free Intimidate boost. Technician Hitmontop is still very weak after the boost and is not recommended. Intimidate is integral in using Hitmontop.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Strong Flying-, Fairy-, and Psychic-type moves: While Wide Guard and Quick Guard can protect Hitmontop from a few attacks, strong attacks of these types are the fastest way to KO Hitmontop. Mega Mawile's Play Rough cleanly OHKOs Hitmontop even at -1. Any Sylveon variant will be able to KO Hitmontop with Hyper Voice, though it will need to work around Wide Guard. Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird OHKOes Hitmontop even with an Attack drop, though it will have to scout for Quick Guard. Cresselia and Latios can use Psychic or Psyshock to bust through Hitmontop.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp: Close Combat is very weak once Hitmontop is burned. Rotom-W and Gengar do a great job at accomplishing that.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Hitmontop usually forgoes a coverage attack to help its partner as much as possible, meaning Ghost-types wall it. Aegislash doesn't care about whatever coverage move Hitmontop has; it resists Stone Edge and is hit with a weaker Payback, as it's slower than Hitmontop.</p>",

      {
        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out support allows Hitmontop to narrow down the situation for its partner for a turn. Close Combat is a powerful attack that gives Hitmontop some bite. Wide Guard protects Hitmontop and its partner from spread attacks, namely Sylveon's Hyper Voice and Landorus-T's Earthquake and Rock Slide. Helping Hand lets Hitmontop boost the power of its partner's attacks. Quick Guard protects your team from priority, mainly Sucker Punch, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Thundurus's status moves. Feint lets Hitmontop's partner get off a valuable guaranteed hit. Stone Edge can also be used for coverage if you find Hitmontop's final support option unneeded.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A simple EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk is used to maximize bulk while also giving Hitmontop as strong a Close Combat as possible. Speed investment is optional. Hitmontop sits at the awkward Speed tier of 70. Investing enough to outspeed uninvested threats with a similar Speed can be useful. With 60 Speed EVs, Hitmontop outruns uninvested Heatran. 140 Speed EVs let Hitmontop outrun uninvested Rotom-W, though investing a little more is recommended, as Rotom-W often speed creeps. Investing in defenses is not heavily recommended, as it doesn't change what Hitmontop is OHKOed by unless it is a significant investment. Taking investment out of Attack is also not recommended; Hitmontop needs 244 Attack EVs to guarantee the KO on 4 HP / 0 Def / 0 SpD Mega Kangaskhan. Close Combat's damage plummets as soon as you start removing Attack EVs.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bringing Hitmontop in swings the momentum in your favor most of the time thanks to its Intimidate and Fake Out pressure. Hitmontop makes for a good, albeit very predictable and answerable lead. It's even better to switch in turn one if you decide on some other pair of leads and the situation isn't favorable. Because Intimidate and Fake Out are refreshed every time Hitmontop switches in, Hitmontop works very well with U-turn or Volt Switch users. If Hitmontop's Fake Out is very obviously telegraphed, consider using some other attack instead to punish your opponent for anticipating Fake Out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hitmontop is great with Pokemon that have powerful spread moves, such as Mega Charizard Y, Sylveon, Heatran, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Salamence, as it can shield them with Fake Out and boost their damage output with Helping Hand. Pokemon with speed control such as Zapdos and Thundurus enjoy Fake Out and Intimidate. Hitmontop's Intimidate and Fake Out support makes partners with boosting moves such as its classic partner Quiver Dance Volcarona. Hitmontop's Fighting-type coverage is so helpful that almost any special attacker appreciates Hitmontop as a partner; notable mentions include Hydreigon and Gardevoir. Pokemon that loathe Landorus-T and its spread moves such as Talonflame, Mega Mawile, and Mega Charizard Y like Hitmontop's Intimidate and Wide Guard. Hitmontop enjoys working with Pokemon that can deal with Mega Mawile, Mega Salamence, and Talonflame. Rotom-W is good against Mega Mawile and Talonflame, while Landorus-T is good against all three.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar is one of the bulkiest offensive Pokemon in the format. Sand Stream sets up sand on the switch, giving Tyranitar a Special Defense boost and helping combat opposing weather teams. With this boost, Tyranitar is a good switch-in to a lot of attacks. STAB Rock Slide is great for coverage and deals with a lot of relevant Pokemon such as Talonflame, Charizard, and Thundurus. Excadrill is a great partner under sand, being a huge threat when Sand Rush is activated. However, Tyranitar's typing gives it weaknesses to several common attacking types, such as Fighting, Fairy, and Ground. Tyranitar's low Speed also gives it some issues; Choice Scarf can make up for this but Tyranitar still won't outspeed the most common Choice Scarf user, Landorus-T.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A mixed attacker set with Life Orb can be used to make Tyranitar an unpredictable offensive threat. Chople Berry can be used to ensure that Tyranitar lives one Fighting attack. Shuca Berry can be used to surprise Landorus-T and heavily damage it with an Ice-type attack. Assault Vest makes Tyranitar incredibly bulky on the special side and makes it a good check to almost any special attacker. A bulky Weakness Policy set can be used to take advantage of the many weaknesses Tyranitar has. Smooth Rock is useful for keeping sand up for a few more turns. Stone Edge is a useful move when Rock Slide's low damage output isn't enough.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Tyranitar is 4x weak to Fighting and will go down to almost any Fighting-type attack. Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Scrafty resist both of Tyranitar's STAB moves and can OHKO it in return. Fighting is also a very common type for coverage and many non-Fighting-type Pokemon carry Fighting-type moves, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can take Tyranitar's attacks and threaten to KO it back with Pixilate-boosted STAB Hyper Voices that also hit Tyranitar's partner. Hyper Voice also can't be redirected, which makes it even more troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Intimidate can cripple Tyranitar by lowering its Attack. Most Intimidate users also have a good matchup against Tyranitar, such as Landorus-T, Scrafty, Mawile, and Hitmontop. Burns also cripple Tyranitar and much more severely and permanently. Rotom-W can take Tyranitar's attacks and burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Other bulky Water-types, such as Suicune, can tank Tyranitar's attacks and potentially burn with Scald while hitting Tyranitar for super effective damage.</p>",

Crunch has good neutral coverage. Ice Punch hits a lot of Pokemon super effectively, most notably Landorus-T and Mega Salamence. Ice Beam can be used instead to avoid the Intimidate drops from both of those Pokemon if you don't mind running a Naive nature. Low Kick or Superpower is good for the extra coverage, as Fighting-type attacks hit a lot of things super effectively. Fire Blast can be used if your team desperately needs Fire-type coverage to hit something that would be hard to deal with otherwise, such as Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs are used to get the most power out of Tyranitar's moves, and maximum Speed EVs are used because Tyranitar has a low base Speed and needs as much investment as possible to perform well. Choice Scarf is used to boost Tyranitar's low Speed and turn Tyranitar into a fast threat, outspeeding most Pokemon in the metagame. A Jolly nature, or Naive if running Ice Beam, is used to ensure that Tyranitar outspeeds Pokemon such as Thundurus and Gengar. Sand Stream breaks opposing Focus Sashes, gives Tyranitar a Special Defense boost, and aids teammates such as Excadrill.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tyranitar works well as a lead to immediately set up sand and start dealing out damage with Rock Slide. Sand helps out teammates that can abuse it, such as Sand Rush Excadrill, and can weaken opposing Pokemon with chip damage.

Protect is used to scout moves, ward off damage for a turn, and keep sand around for longer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This bulky spread aims to keep sand around for as long as possible and also make Tyranitar a threat under Trick Room. 252 HP / 12 Def guarantees that Tyranitar survives an Iron Head from Bisharp at full health, with the rest of the EVs put into Attack for maximum damage output. Sand Stream inflicts useful chip damage and can support a team very well. With this EV spread, Tyranitar can withstand more hits and stay in the battle longer to repeatedly set sand up. A slower spread means Tyranitar sets sand up after Politoed if they are lead against each other. Lum Berry lets Tyranitar avoid burns that would cripple it. Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to live one Fighting-type attack and potentially surprise the opponent. Tyranitarite makes Tyranitar much bulkier and lets it set up sand a second time by Mega Evolving.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tyranitar works well as a lead to immediately get sand on the field.

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Sceptile has a lot of notable qualities, such as a unique Grass / Dragon typing, an incredible base 145 Speed that allows it to outrun almost every Pokemon in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame, including Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and a great base 145 Special Attack that allows it to KO foes such as Politoed and Suicune easier, but the most notable quality lies in its ability, Lightning Rod. Not only does this make Mega Sceptile immune to Electric-type moves, but it also boosts Mega Sceptile's Special Attack and redirects all Electric-type moves aimed at Mega Sceptile's teammates towards it. However, Mega Sceptile is not without its flaws, as it has really bad bulk, making it easy to OHKO; its typing makes it weak to six relatively common types and changes its 2x weakness to Ice-types into a 4x weakness; and its special movepool is bad, as it only has access to a few coverage moves. However, despite its flaws, Mega Sceptile is definitely still a viable Pokemon in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to Mega Sceptile's poor movepool, it doesn't have many good options. Focus Blast is a powerful option as third attack; it can OHKO Tyranitar, deal lots of damage to Mega Kangaskhan, and hit most Steel-types hard. However, it is very risky and unreliable due to its poor accuracy. Mega Sceptile can use Substitute to survive more hits. Mega Sceptile can still receive Lightning Rod boosts behind Substitute. Giga Drain allows Mega Sceptile to heal itself, but Mega Sceptile is frail and faints easily, so it wants to have as many powerful moves as possible, and Giga Drain is normally inferior to Mega Sceptile's other Grass-type moves. Mega Sceptile can use Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ground to have an option more reliable than Focus Blast to hit Steel-types with. Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran, and Hidden Power Fire hits Scizor and Ferrothorn. Mega Sceptile has a very good physical movepool, but due to its Attack being lower than its Special Attack, physical moves aren't very good options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-type Pokemon give Mega Sceptile the most problems. Mega Mawile laughs at anything Mega Sceptile uses, and it can take Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ground easily and OHKO Mega Sceptile back. Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Mega Altaria can tank any move from Mega Sceptile with no problems and OHKO it back.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types can often hard-wall Mega Sceptile, unless it carries specific Hidden Power or the unreliable Focus Blast, but, even then, they are pain for Mega Sceptile. Aegislash, Mega Mawile, and Mega Metagross can take anything from Mega Sceptile and KO it back or do notable damage. If Mega Sceptile lacks Hidden Power Ground or Focus Blast, Heatran walls it hard and can set up a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: While Mega Sceptile is immune to one form of speed control, namely Thunder Wave, other forms give it a headache. Opposing Trick Room or Tailwind and opposing Mega Sceptile become useless until they wear off. Even Bulldoze can cripple it by reducing its Speed, and if Icy Wind doesn't OHKO Mega Sceptile, it will at least leave it severely incapacitated due to a combination of reduced Speed until switching out and incredibly low HP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: It is pretty hard to outspeed Mega Sceptile without a type of boost. However, Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Latios can outspeed and OHKO. Talonflame causes problems with its Brave Bird, especially if Mega Sceptile lacks Quick Guard.</p>",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Storm is one of Mega Sceptile's few special moves that can OHKO Suicune and Milotic, and it has impressive power in general. Energy Ball is a weaker STAB move, but it doesn't lower Mega Sceptile's Special Attack, so it doesn't force Mega Sceptile to switch out to regain its Special Attack and is generally a better option if you want to use Mega Sceptile as a sweeper instead of a hit-and-run Pokemon. Dragon Pulse gets boosted by STAB after Sceptile Mega Evolves, giving it the ability to KO all Dragon-types, barring Goodra. Detect is used to avoid attacks, and it is generally better than Protect due to users of both Imprison and Protect. Quick Guard is great option in last slot, as Mega Sceptile baits Talonflame, so Quick Guard protects Mega Sceptile from Talonflame's Brave Birds. Mega Sceptile is also faster than every Fake Out user, which means it has the ability to block any Fake Out. Hidden Power Ice allows Mega Sceptile to score a KO on Landorus-T. This is exceptionally useful because, with a Timid nature, Mega Sceptile is faster than Choice Scarf Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs allow Mega Sceptile to hit as hard and be fast as possible. A Modest nature makes sure that Mega Sceptile OHKOes most Suicune and Milotic variants with Leaf Storm, and it allows Mega Sceptile to always OHKO bulky Mega Salamence. A Timid nature is better when you put Hidden Power Ice on Mega Sceptile, as Mega Sceptile can outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T and OHKO it with Hidden Power Ice. A Timid nature also allows Mega Sceptile to outspeed positive Speed-natured Mega Lopunny, Mega Manectric, and Mega Gengar.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Sceptile works well as leading Pokemon because it can use Quick Guard to block incoming Fake Outs and then switch out, so it can switch into predicted Electric-type moves later on. Mega Sceptile also works as late-game cleaner. However, avoid switching Mega Sceptile in if there is chance that it will get hit by a super effective or a powerful neutral attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Electric-types with Discharge, such as all Rotom formes, Zapdos, Raikou, Thundurus, and Thundurus-T, make for good partners for Mega Sceptile, as they can boost Mega Sceptile's Special Attack while also hitting both foes. Prankster Thundurus's Thunder Wave is another way to boost Mega Sceptile's Special Attack, as it always goes before Mega Sceptile. Again, Thundurus works well at this, but Meowstic-M and Klefki do too. Water- and Flying-types benefit from Lightning Rod and overall have good type synergy with Mega Sceptile. Suicune and Milotic become real tanks that are hard to take down due to having only one weakness when Mega Sceptile is on field; they can also take down Fire-types and have Scald to give Mega Sceptile chance to survive more attacks. Heatran is a great partner for Mega Sceptile because it resists all of Mega Sceptile's weaknesses, so it is really easy to switch in, and it takes out Steel-types, which Mega Sceptile hates. Other Fire-types such as Arcanine and Talonflame are good partners too. Talonflame also enjoys Mega Sceptile's Lightning Rod. Mega Sceptile hates Fairy-types, so Pokemon that beat them are good partners for it, such as Bisharp, Gengar, and Heatran.</p>"

  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its ability Speed Boost, Blaziken can create its own speed control method, and its STAB coverage allows it to beat a lot of Pokemon that are really common in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Amoonguss, Aegislash, and Heatran. However, Blaziken has poor defenses, and its mediocre base 80 Speed forces it to use Protect the first turn so it can get the Speed boost, which the opponent can capitalize on. Speed Boost also makes Blaziken very weak to Trick Room.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The mixed set can run either Low Kick or Heat Wave over Superpower and Overheat, trading the stat drops for consistency but losing a lot of power, which means that Blaziken won't be able to OHKO some Pokemon with them. Another option is a more supportive set with the move Baton Pass. With Baton Pass, Blaziken can pass a Substitute or a few Speed boosts to one of its partners. Knock Off can be used to hit some of the Pokemon that Blaziken usually struggles with, such as Cresselia and Jellicent. High Jump Kick is a really strong Fighting-type move that can 2HKO a lot of Pokemon even when resisted, at the cost of reliability and a bit of accuracy.</p> <h1>Check &amp; Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Blaziken can barely do around 40% damage to some bulky Water-types, and Pokemon like Suicune, Rotom-W, Gastrodon, Jellicent and Milotic can KO back with ease.</p> <p><strong>Fast Flying-types: Fast Flying-types force Blaziken to Protect so it can outspeed next turn, and even then, Talonflame's priority Brave Bird makes Blaziken a easy target for it. While redirection can usually save Blaziken from being hurt by a Flying-type move, Aerilate Hyper Voice from Mega Salamence will ignore it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic- and Fairy-types: Bulky Psychic- and Fairy-types play the same role as bulky Water-types, although Blaziken can KO some of them if they're low on health. Depending on the set, Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Clefable are pretty good checks for it. Additionally, Cresselia can ignore every single one of Blaziken's moves and hit back hard with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers: Due to its low defenses, Blaziken often gets OHKOed by many attacks in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame, so any Pokemon that can take a hit and hit back hard will give Blaziken some trouble. Pokemon such as Assault Vest Landorus-T and Scrafty can take Blaziken's attacks and even KO it afterwards.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat's great Base Power allows Blaziken to pick up multiple OHKOs against Pokemon that are weak to it, such as Aegislash and Amoonguss, while doing a lot of damage to neutral targets such as Volcarona and Gardevoir. Superpower is used as the secondary STAB move and hits Dark-types, Normal-types, and Steel-types that Overheat can't KO, such as Hydreigon, Mega Kangaskhan, and Heatran. Hidden Power Ice deals with many Pokemon that the Blaziken's STAB moves can't hit, such as Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Blaziken to outspeed Choice Scarf Adamant Landorus-T at +1. The Special Attack investment allows it to OHKO uninvested Mega Salamence with Hidden Power Ice, and provides an almost guaranteed OHKO on even the bulkier Kangaskhan versions.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Blaziken's Protect causes quite a bit of mind games. You can lead the opponent to think you will use Protect the first turn and then fire off an attack, or you can use Protect when expecting the opponent to fall for it. Blaziken doesn't like leading, as it cannot break through some bulkier Pokemon without prior damage, and it likes to stay in the back until the point where the opponent's team is weakened enough for Blaziken to sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Blaziken likes Pokemon capable of breaking through bulky Water-types so it's easier for it to sweep. Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Amoonguss can do this task really well. In the same vein, Pokemon that can break through Pokemon such as Sylveon, Psychic-types, Mega Charizard Y, and Talonflame, which resist Blaziken's STAB moves and take little damage from them, give Blaziken an easier time breaking through teams; good options include Aegislash, Bisharp and Landorus-T. Redirection support from Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Gastrodon helps Blaziken stay on the battlefield for more turns and lets it not play less defensively than it normally does.</p>"

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flare Blitz has a high Base Power and a chance to burn, though this comes at the cost of high recoil damage. Low Kick often has a high Base Power against foes it hits super effectively such as Mega Kangaskhan and Heatran, and Mega Blaziken can therefore OHKO them with relative ease. Superpower is an alternative that covers foes that are hit lightly by Low Kick at the cost of reducing Mega Blaziken's Attack stat afterwards. It notably grants Mega Blaziken the ability to OHKO 4 HP Choice Scarf Politoed and deals significant damage to Rotom-W and Ludicolo. Rock Slide deals damage to both foes and is most useful for eliminating Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y. Its high chance to make foes flinch combined with Mega Blaziken's high Speed after a boost means it's also great as a last resort. Protect allows Mega Blaziken to safely gain the Speed increase from Mega Evolving and Speed Boost.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Speed Boost is chosen for the rare instance that Blaziken is left on the field for a turn without Mega Evolving. For example, this can be useful if your team is using multiple Mega Pokemon and you want to bring Blaziken without Mega Evolving it. The EV spread is simple, maximizing Attack and Speed with an Adamant nature to improve Mega Blaziken's damage output. A Jolly nature is theoretically an option to outspeed maximum Speed Ludicolo and Swampert at +1 Speed in the rain, but this isn't recommended, as the power drop from Adamant is significant. If you want Mega Blaziken to have some extra bulk, Speed EVs can be dropped to 188 in order to outpace Landorus-T by one point; however, given that this is a popular benchmark to Speed creep, it's not generally recommended to do so.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Blaziken's role is to pick up OHKOs on foes hit super effectively by its coverage moves or foes with a low Defense stat. This is because Mega Blaziken's frailty means it often can't afford to take hits in return. In addition, its lack of bulk means that it should preferably be either used as a lead or switched in after a teammate has fainted so that it can get onto the field without taking damage. If you want to lead with Blaziken, try pairing it with a Defiant or Competitive user if your opponent has an Intimidate user. There is no downside to Mega Evolving immediately, so do so in order to take advantage of the Speed increase for the remainder of the battle. Use Protect on the first turn Blaziken is sent out to Mega Evolve and activate Speed Boost safely. However, this can be very predictable, and it gives your opponent a chance to use a setup move or attack Mega Blaziken's ally to capitalize off of it. Preventing Mega Blaziken from being paralyzed by the likes of Thundurus is key for it to continue putting on pressure, so do so at all costs. Try to keep Pokemon like Amoonguss and Gastrodon in the back, as they do a great job of defending Mega Blaziken. Don't be afraid of switching Mega Blaziken out, even if it's gained boosts, as it only needs one boost to outpace the majority of the metagame. If all else fails, going for a fast Rock Slide and hoping for some flinches can potentially claw you out of a bad situation.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Blaziken struggles against bulky Water-types like Suicune, so partners that can beat them are valuable. Offensive Electric-types such as Life Orb Thundurus and Choice Specs Rotom-W are good for this, and they also do a great job at scaring off Talonflame. Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Ferrothorn also have a positive matchup against them. Amoonguss is notable, as Rage Powder can shield Mega Blaziken against strong attacks. Water-types such as Milotic and Gyarados are also great partners, as they can beat Ground-types like Landorus-T and Dragons like Salamence, as well as Talonflame. Milotic's Competitive is also a nice way of punishing Intimidate users for reducing Mega Blaziken's Attack. Gastrodon is another great Water-type, as Storm Drain is able to redirect Water-type moves aimed at Mega Blaziken to it and grant Gastrodon a Special Attack boost. Under this protection, Mega Blaziken cannot be harmed by opposing bulky Water-types such as Suicune at all. Bisharp joins Milotic in being able to deter Intimidate thanks to Defiant, and it can beat Psychic-types, which hit Mega Blaziken super effectively. Ghost-types such as Gengar and Aegislash are also able to deal a lot of damage to Psychic-types. Furthermore, Aegislash has access to Wide Guard to protect Mega Blaziken against Earthquake, which it's weak to.</p>"

Swampert does its jobs very well, being a great Mega Evolution under rain thanks to Swift Swim and amazing base stats; however, it has a crippling 4x weakness to Grass, a fairly common type in the metagame. If your team is not reliant on rain, consider running other Mega Evolutions, as they have more to offer than Mega Swampert.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Instead of running Protect, Mega Swampert can run Wide Guard as an alternative form of protection. It can also run Aqua Tail for its higher Base Power, but it lacks the flinch chance of Waterfall and does not have perfect accuracy. Fighting-type moves such as Power-Up Punch and Superpower can be run instead of Ice Punch to hit different targets, such as Ferrothorn. An alternative EV spreads is 28 HP / 252 Atk / 228 Spe with a Jolly nature to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T under rain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Wide Guard can block Mega Swampert's Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Moves</strong>: Swampert is 4x weak to Grass-type moves, which are fairly common because a lot of Pokemon are weak to Grass in the metagame.</p> <p><strong>Sun Teams</strong>: Sun lowers the power of Water-type moves and counters any rain-based strategy; this mostly affects Mega Swampert due to its heavy reliance on Swift Swim.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate Users</strong>: Intimidate is a very common ability in the format and lowers Mega Swampert's Attack. However, the Attack drop doesn't last if Mega Swampert switches out, and it has coverage moves for most Intimidate users.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Burns are another way of lowering Mega Swampert's attacking power, but there isn't an easy way of getting rid of them, unlike the Attack drops from Intimidate.</p>",

Earthquake is another STAB move that hits a wide range of Pokemon for neutral damage. Ice Punch hits Grass- and Dragon-types that resist Swampert's STAB moves. Finally, Protect allows Swampert to safely Mega Evolve and scout for the foe's moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Swampertite allows Swampert to Mega Evolve. An Adamant nature along with 252 Attack EVs makes Swampert's attacks hit as hard as possible. 148 Speed EVs allow Mega Swampert to outspeed Mega Sceptile under rain, while the rest of the EVs are put into HP to increase its bulk significantly. Its ability, Damp, only comes in handy against the very rare Explosion Mega Glalie, but it changes to Swift Swim when Swampert Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rain is the most important thing for this set to work, and it needs to be up as much as possible, as Mega Swampert is not very effective without it. Another thing to keep in mind is that Swift Swim doesn't apply on the first turn, so use Protect to Mega Evolve safely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Politoed is Mega Swampert's best partner, as it is the only Pokemon in the format able to automatically set up rain thanks to its ability. Pokemon with priority moves, such as Tornadus, Thundurus, and Talonflame, are good for both general support and mitigating Swampert's lack of priority. Other rain sweepers such as Ludicolo also make for good partners, as they can take advantage of the rain as well.</p>"

Earth Power is Swampert's secondary STAB move that has a chance of lowering the foe's Special Defense and hits only one target, unlike most Ground-type moves. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Dragon-types that resist or are immune to Swampert's STAB combination. Wide Guard works like a team-wide Protect, but it only protects your side against moves that hit more than one target, though many of them are pretty common in the metagame.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The very specific 228 Special Attack EVs allow Swampert to OHKO Landorus-T, Heatran lacking Shuca Berry or Air Balloon, Mega Mawile, Mega Salamence, Talonflame, Garchomp, and offensive Mega Gengar with the appropriate moves. The EVs also allow it to 2HKO Aegislash in Shield forme, Hydreigon, Mega Altaria, Mega Metagross, and most Thundurus variants. The 12 Speed EVs allow Swampert to outspeed uninvested Tyranatar. 236 HP and 28 Defense EVs specifically allow it to survive Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thanks to its immunity to Electric, Swampert is best used as a switch-in to Electric-types rather than a lead, but it can switch in on Pokemon such as Landorus, Heatran, and Garchomp as well; it can also work early-game as a counter to Mega Salamence and Landorus-T or as a late-game cleaner, when its checks have been removed. However, if it can't hit any Pokemon for super effective damage or Wide Guard isn't useful, you should remove it from the battlefield, as it will not be an effective Pokemon. Lastly, many unexpected Pokemon can run Grass Knot, so be aware of this possibility.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Talonflame is Swampert's best partner, as it enjoys its Wide Guard support and Swampert appreciates its Grass resistance and coverage moves. Swampert also enjoys teammates such as Mega Charizard Y, Breloom, and Amoonguss, which threaten and force out Grass-types. Lastly, Pokemon that counter Mega Kangaskhan, such as Terrakion, Ferrothorn, and Gengar, are appreciated as well.</p>"

A Substitute set with Toxic Orb and Poison Heal works as well.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore is used to put opposing Pokemon to sleep. Mach Punch is a priority move that helps mitigate Breloom's mediocre Speed and can allow Breloom to KO Bisharp. Bullet Seed will be Breloom's main Grass-type STAB move and allows Breloom to deal massive damage against bulky Water-types, such as Suicune and Rotom-W, and Ground-types. Superpower is a more powerful Fighting-type STAB move that can pick up KOs that Mach Punch cannot, such as against Heatran and Mega Kangaskhan. Protect allows Breloom to scout out moves and provides protection against opposing Pokemon that can OHKO Breloom such as Talonflame.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Focus Sash can help with Breloom's bad defenses but is generally used if you are more concerned with using Spore a lot. Life Orb is the alternative to use if you're more focused on damage. A Jolly nature is used over an Adamant nature considering that Adamant Breloom gets outsped by a lot of Pokemon, particularly those that are built to outspeed Bisharp, while a Jolly nature can allow Breloom to outrun Bisharp. Adamant should only be used when you need specific KOs. Maximum Speed and Attack EVs are used, as running bulk isn't necessary on Breloom due to its frailness.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Breloom pairs up really well with Pokemon that can use Fake Out, Encore, or moves that can control speed (besides Thunder Wave, considering you want to use Spore as often as possible). This can allow your team to put massive pressure on your opponent. Protect is handy to keep Breloom alive because many opponents will try to double target Breloom to prevent it from incapacitating entire teams with Spore.</p> <p>Remember that if you use Spore before the foe attacks, they can wake up the very next turn. With that in mind, it is sometimes safer to just attack and pick up KOs. Also remember that Bullet Seed can miss out on KOs if it triggers Sitrus Berry and it might only hit 2 times, so prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can provide Tailwind support, such as Suicune and Talonflame, are great partners for Breloom. Not only does Suicune provide an alternative speed control option in the form of Icy Wind, but it can also check Talonflame, other Flying-types, and Fire-types. Other speed control Pokemon are Cresselia and Rotom-W with Icy Wind and Electroweb, respectively. Rotom-W, like Suicune, is a fantastic partner due to its ability to check Talonflame, Fire-types, and Flying-types. Pokemon with Fake Out, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Liepard, are great partners. Mega Kangaskhan, in conjunction with Breloom, can put massive offensive pressure on your opponent. Redirection to help mitigate Breloom's frailness is a wonderful support option for Breloom's partner to have. Examples of Pokemon that can provide this support include Volcarona, Togekiss (which also has access to Tailwind), and Clefable (which has access to Icy Wind). Breloom also works nicely with Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, as Breloom is able to check Rock- and Water-types. Those two also put massive pressure on opponents due to their powerful spread STAB moves. Breloom also helps Heatran set up Substitutes easier with Spore.</p>"

Its great coverage also allows it to deal with common metagame threats such as Mega Kangaskhan, Heatran, and Landorus-T. Scrafty is often the preferred option on Trick Room teams thanks to its access to Intimidate and Drain Punch; however, Hariyama is a more offensive alternative to Scrafty that can fulfill its role as a Fake Out user as well as an additional role as a strong Fighting-type. Hariyama also faces competition from Conkeldurr and Machamp, as they make for better offensive Trick Room Fighting-types if Hariyama's Fake Out is unneeded. Ensure that you only use Hariyama on a team with a Trick Room setter, as its low Speed will otherwise leave it unable to function effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stone Edge is an alternative to Rock Slide that circumvents Wide Guard and KOes bulky variants of Mega Charizard Y. Feint allows Hariyama to break a foe's Protect for a partner, but Hariyama usually prefers being the one going on offense. Helping Hand boosts the power of a partner's attack, but it suffers from the same problem as Feint. Heavy Slam is an option for Fairy-types, as Hariyama is heavy and most Fairy-types are quite light; for example, it can OHKO 252 HP Sylveon, given maximum Attack investment. Poison Jab is a generally inferior option for dealing with Fairies, but it notably hits Azumarill super effectively, whereas Steel-type moves do not. Bullet Punch provides a way of hitting Fairies super effectively with priority, but its power is fairly underwhelming. Protect and Detect are options if you'd prefer Hariyama to have the option to defend itself for a turn, but giving up coverage for either of them is often undesirable. Lastly, Toxic Orb or Flame Orb can be used to activate Guts more reliably, and both help to prevent sleep spread by Pokemon like Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types such as Mega Salamence, Talonflame, and Staraptor can OHKO Hariyama with their high-powered STAB moves. Talonflame is especially dangerous, as Gale Wings allows it to move first even under Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Mega Gardevoir, and Azumarill resist Close Combat and deal super effective damage to Hariyama. Even for Wide Guard Hariyama, the former two are still problematic, as their access to Psyshock and Psychic means they don't have to rely on Hyper Voice to KO Hariyama.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types such as Mega Metagross, Cresselia, and Gothitelle are able to deal super effective damage with their STAB moves, and the latter two also resist Close Combat. However, they should all be wary of being hit by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Intimidate users such as Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Mega Mawile reduce Hariyama's damage output by lowering its Attack.</p> <p><strong>Redirection: Follow Me and Rage Powder users are able to redirect Hariyama's Fighting-type attacks with ease and frequently resist Fighting-type attacks, invest heavily into Defense, and carry Rocky Helmet. Notable examples include Amoonguss, Clefable, and Togekiss.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out causes a foe to flinch, allowing a partner to set up Trick Room more safely. Close Combat is a high-powered STAB move and one of Hariyama's greatest advantages over Scrafty. Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types, which are immune to or resist Fighting, and is also able to remove items. It's also worth noting that, as Hariyama is so slow, it can underspeed and KO Aegislash with Knock Off after it has changed to Blade forme. Ice Punch deals super effective damage to Flying-types such as Landorus-T and Mega Salamence. Rock Slide is an alternative coverage option to Ice Punch that helps deal with Fire-types like Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona. Wide Guard is an option when used with Sitrus Berry that defends Hariyama and its partner from spread attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Brave nature and 172 Attack EVs are used to KO bulky Mega Kangaskhan with Close Combat. Defensively, the EVs allow Hariyama to survive either a Double-Edge from Jolly Mega Kangaskhan or two Psychics from Modest Cresselia. Assault Vest is used to improve Hariyama's special bulk as much as possible. Sitrus Berry is an alternative if you'd prefer the ability to use a status move, as it also improves longevity. When using Sitrus Berry, an EV spread of 60 HP / 100 Atk / 100 Def / 244 SpD should be used to KO 4 HP Mega Kangaskhan and survive Choice Specs Hydreigon's Draco Meteor. Guts allows Hariyama to function as a status sponge and prevents burns from neutering Hariyama's damage output. Thick Fat is an option to help Hariyama function as a better check to Fire-types and should preferably be used in combination with Rock Slide. 0 Speed IVs are used to allow Hariyama to move as soon as possible under Trick Room.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You should generally use Hariyama in the lead position to gain early momentum with Fake Out, preferably by aiding a partner in setting up Trick Room. Offensively, try to focus more on targets that threaten Hariyama's bulkier partners rather than Hariyama itself, as they are likely to be more valuable in the late-game. Don't be overly concerned about the defense drops from Close Combat, as Hariyama is quite bulky despite them and is likely to have already traded efficiently before they become an issue. They may even help with momentum, as removing Hariyama from the field quickly after it has done its job could make way for a more appropriate sweeper to switch in for free. However, be mindful of instances where Hariyama could be conserved to sponge damage and status later on or to maintain the option of using Fake Out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room setters such as Jellicent, Cresselia, and Gothitelle are mandatory partners in order to set up Trick Room for Hariyama and the rest of its team. Steel-types such as Mega Mawile, Ferrothorn, and Escavalier can deal with Fairies and check Psychic-types, which threaten Hariyama. Bisharp is also notable as a Steel-type, as its Dark typing makes it immune to Psychic and its Defiant ability deters opponents from bringing in Intimidate users, which reduce Hariyama's damage output. Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Heatran, and Mega Camerupt can check Amoonguss, which is otherwise problematic due to its ability to redirect Hariyama's Fighting-type attacks with Rage Powder. These partners also provide resistances to Fairy-type moves. Water-types such as Rotom-W and Gastrodon serve as deterrents to Talonflame by threatening it with super effective STAB moves. Pokemon vulnerable to spread moves such as Abomasnow, Heatran, and Charizard make for good partners, as they appreciate being defended against them by Wide Guard.</p>"

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mawile's Mega Evolution is still a top-tier threat thanks to its ability, Huge Power, great defensive typing, and Intimidate all making it an incredible attacker and team player at the same time. Will-O-Wisp, Intimidate, and effective users of Ground- and Fire-type attacks are more common than ever in this metagame, but their presence is still not enough to keep Mega Mawile from being a major threat.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Brick Break hits Heatran and Ferrothorn, which are otherwise troublesome. Stone Edge hits Fire-types harder than Rock Slide and hits through Wide Guard, but it is inaccurate. Fire Fang is especially helpful for muscling through Steel-types, particularly Aegislash, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Knock Off hits Aegislash and is a solid alternative to Sucker Punch. It lets Mega Mawile hit Aegislash as it uses Substitute or another non-attacking move in exchange for risking an Attack drop as Aegislash uses King's Shield. Substitute and Swords Dance are also useful tools for Mega Mawile, but it's bulky and powerful enough immediately.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types and Other Pokemon with Super-Effective Attacks: Entei, Mega Charizard-Y, Talonflame, and Arcanine mean a lot of trouble for Mega Mawile. Keep in mind that Talonflame and Arcanine much prefer their special attacking options against Mega Mawile due to Intimidate. Outside of Fire-types, Landorus-T and Garchomp can do lots of damage to Mega Mawile, though they need prior damage source or a Choice Band to finish the job at +0</p> <p><strong>Faster Will-O-Wisp Users: Rotom-W, Sableye, and Gengar can all burn Mega Mawile before it can hit them for super effective damage. Sableye and Gengar also have Taunt, which prevents Trick Room use.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Landorus-T, Arcanine, and opposing Mawile and the -1 Attack drops that come with them are all bothersome for Mega Mawile.</p>",

        "name": "Mega Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Play Rough hits anything that doesn't resist it tremendously hard. Sucker Punch provides useful coverage and priority, allowing Mega Mawile to work around its bad Speed at the expense of only being able to attack when the foe does. Iron Head is a more reliable STAB move with inferior coverage, while Rock Slide gives Mega Mawile coverage against Mega Charizard-Y, Talonflame, and other Fire-types that are otherwise major trouble. Protect shields Mega Mawile for a turn while its partner deals with an opposing threat and lets it avoid being double targeted.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Intimidate is still arguably the best ability in the game, lowering the target's Attack by one stage. An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs simply get Mega Mawile its maximum damage output. If you find maximum Attack unnecessary, you can take some EVs out of Attack and put them into Mega Mawile's defenses to help it survive certain hits. A list with certain benchmarks is provided below. Choose your investment based on what your team values enduring:</p> <ul> <li>44 Def allows Mega Mawile to survive Adamant Choice Band Talonflame's -1 Flare Blitz. <li>36 SpD allows Mega Mawile to never be 2HKOed by uninvested neutral-natured Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and survive Timid maximum Special Attack Chandelure's Heat Wave.</li> <li>52 SpD allows Mega Mawile to never be OHKOed by Modest maximum Special Attack Heatran's Heat Wave.</li> <li>124 SpD allows Mega Mawile to never be OHKOed by Modest maximum Special Attack Chandelure's Heat Wave.</li> <li>148 SpD allows Mega Mawile to never be OHKOed by Modest max Special Attack Life Orb Tyranitar's Fire Blast or be 2HKOed by max Special Attack Rotom-W's Thunderbolt.</li> <li>196 SpD allows Mega Mawile to always survive Naughty 4 Special Attack Life Orb Talonflame's Overheat.</li> <li>204 SpD allows Mega Mawile to always survive Modest Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave when the sun is down.</li> </ul> <p>Switching to a negative Speed nature with a Speed IV of zero is recommended if you are using Mega Mawile in a dedicated Trick Room team. If using Gothitelle, a Speed IV of 18 or 19 and an Adamant nature is recommended. This allows Gothitelle to use Tickle before Mawile moves under Trick Room.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Don't feel pressured to Mega Evolve Mawile immediately, as you'll want to keep Intimidate around for as long as possible. Mawile can actually switch in quite often thanks to Intimidate and its useful pool of resistances. Additionally, be sure to run some kind of speed control (particularly Trick Room) or redirection support with Mawile, as it greatly increases its effectiveness. Try to preserve Mega Mawile until Landorus and powerful Fire-types are down so it can attack uninhibited.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Cresselia is an excellent support Pokemon for Mega Mawile. It has Trick Room, Icy Wind, and Thunder Wave for speed control and can lend Mega Mawile a Helping Hand boost. Gothitelle's Shadow Tag, Trick Room, and Tickle are all very helpful for Mega Mawile. Again, if using Gothitelle, don't set Mega Mawile's Speed to 0 IVs with a Brave nature; set it to 18 or 19 IVs with an Adamant nature. This allows Gothitelle to outspeed Mega Mawile by one point in Trick Room and lets Gothitelle get off a Tickle. Thundurus can paralyze the opponent's team and line Mega Mawile up to clean late-game. Hydreigon, Latios, and Salamence all have great defensive synergy with Mega Mawile; Mega Mawile can switch into attacks aimed at these Pokemon and vice versa. Milotic can deal with Fire- and Ground-type attackers and deter the opponent from switching in an Intimidate user on Mega Mawile. Amoonguss and Togekiss are the ideal redirection support for Mega Mawile. Amoonguss can redirect whatever Rotom-W wants to do while Togekiss and Mega Mawile have some nice defensive synergy.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Manectric faces competition from Raikou and Thundurus, both of which do not take up a Mega slot. Ground-types, such as Landorus-T, have also strained the viability of Mega Manectric. Mega Manectric also has a very shallow movepool and a very predictable moveset. However, despite having a shallow movepool, Mega Manectric has surprisingly good coverage options. Mega Manectric retains one of the highest Speed stats in the metagame, tied with only Mega Lopunny, which allows it to outspeed all of the unboosted metagame. Having Intimidate and Volt Switch allows Mega Manectric to act as a pivot and Intimidate shuffler.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Manectric has a very shallow movepool, so there aren't many options. Snarl can be used to weaken the opponent's special attackers, while Thunder is a much stronger STAB move that works well in rain teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Speed Control: Even after lowering the opposing Pokemon's Attack stats with Intimidate, Mega Manectric's bulk still isn't very good. If Mega Manectric's Speed is reduced in some way—for example, with Icy Wind or Tailwind boosting the Speed of the opposing team—then the opponent can easily take advantage of Mega Manectric's low bulk and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Typing Advantage</strong>: Common Pokemon, such as Rotom-H and Venusaur, can completely wall Mega Manectric. Those two can easily force Mega Manectric out with their respective STAB moves. Dragon- and Ground-types are a huge problem for Mega Manectric, as it has trouble breaking through Dragon- and Ground-types which aren't 4x weak to Ice-type attacks. Faster Ground-types, such as the common Choice Scarf Landorus-T, can force Mega Manectric out with Earthquake, while Dragon-types such as Hydreigon can laugh off a Hidden Power Ice and destroy Mega Manectric with a Draco Meteor.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch allows Mega Manectric to Intimidate shuffle and reset its stat reductions from Overheat. Thunderbolt, a stronger alternative, can be handy as it doesn't switch Mega Manectric out; it is also an option over Overheat, should Mega Manectric not need the Fire-type coverage. Hidden Power Ice allows Mega Manectric to hit Ground-types, mainly Garchomp and Landorus-T. Overheat is the preferred Fire-type coverage move because it has more power than Flamethrower and has nice synergy with Mega Manectric's role as a hit-and-run Pokemon. However, Flamethrower allows Mega Manectric to stay in and attack. Protect is mandatory because it allows Manectric to gain the Speed boost from its Mega Evolution.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature are used to take advantage of Mega Manectric's good Speed tier. 244 Special Attack EVs are used because a fast, frail attacker like Mega Manectric prefers having max Speed. 12 HP EVs allow Mega Manectric to always survive a spread reduced Earthquake from a -1 maximum Attack Choice Scarf Adamant Landorus-T and retaliate with an OHKO via Hidden Power Ice. A Timid nature is preferred because Mega Manectric prefers higher Speed, however a Modest nature could be used to increase Mega Manectric's damage output. Lightning Rod is the preferred ability because it allows Mega Manectric to switch into opposing Electric-type attacks and gain a Special Attack boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Manectric performs as a hit-and-run Pokemon. Hit your opponent with a strong attack and Volt Switch out when there is a Pokemon that threatens Mega Manectric. This works really well with Intimidate, as it allows Mega Manectric to Intimidate shuffle and cripple the opponent's physical attackers. There are times when delaying its Mega Evolution is better because Lightning Rod can redirect potential Electric-type attacks aimed at Mega Manectric's partners. Mega Manectric doesn't have the bulk that most Intimidate users have, so it cannot switch into many attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Manectric has nice synergy with Water-types such as Gyarados. Gyarados checks Rotom-H and Ground-types while also forming a nice Intimidate core with Mega Manectric. Mega Manectric can switch into Electric-type attacks aimed at Gyarados and gain a free boost due to Lightning Rod. Mega Manectric can also check bulky Water-types that Gyarados has trouble beating. Milotic can check the same Pokemon that Gyarados checks while also discouraging Landorus-T from being sent out due to Milotic's Competitive ability. Talonflame can help break through Venusaur, Amoonguss, and common Assault Vest users such as Conkeldurr and Ludicolo and benefits from Mega Manectric's ability to remove most bulky Water-types. Landorus-T, despite being a Ground-type itself, synergizes really well with Mega Manectric, as it can switch into Ground-type attacks aimed at Mega Manectric while being able to force out Pokemon that Mega Manectric has trouble hitting for massive damage, such as Rotom-H and Heatran. Mega Manectric, in turn, checks bulky Water-types that Landorus-T has trouble hitting and Ferrothorn with its Fire-type coverage move.</p>"

However, Mega Camerupt is not viable outside Trick Room and requires support from other Pokemon on its team. It's also hard to send out without taking prior damage or letting its teammate faint.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast and Flamethrower are alternative STAB moves with more power but only target one Pokemon. Hidden Power Grass targets Water-type Pokemon ruining Mega Camerupt's day, such as Rotom-W. Rock Slide works off Mega Camerupt's solid Attack and Sheer Force, letting it hit Mega Charizard Y harder than Ancient Power. However, Intimidate users weaken Mega Camerupt's Attack. Solar Beam combos with Sunny Day Cresselia to hit Water-type Pokemon harder, although it relies on Sunny Day.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Rotom-W, Suicune, and Milotic are problematic Water-type Pokemon for Mega Camerupt. Rotom-W has Levitate and resists Mega Camerupt's STAB moves, which is a huge problem if Mega Camerupt doesn't carry Hidden Power Grass or have a teammate to KO it. Milotic and Suicune have amazing Special Defense and so can tank Mega Camerupt's Earth Power with ease.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Latios, and Salamence resist Heat Wave, are immune to Earth Power, and can be a huge problem if Hidden Power Ice isn't used. However, they need to be careful when Mega Camerupt is in Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Levitating Fire-types: Rotom-H and Mega Charizard Y resist or are immune to Mega Camerupt's STAB moves and are hard to defeat without Ancient Power. Talonflame can take a lot of damage from Heat Wave and Brave Bird recoil but has Taunt to stop Trick Room from going up, allowing it to switch in and finish off a weakened Mega Camerupt easily.</p> <p><strong>Preventing Trick Room: In general, Sableye, Thundurus, and Gengar are good checks to Cresselia and Gothitelle, two common Trick Room users, as they can hit them super effectively or Taunt them.

These include max Special Attack Mega Charizard Y's Overheat in sun as well as max Attack Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence's Double-Edge. Altaria also has access to moves such as Draco Meteor, Ice Beam, and Fire Blast that Gardevoir and Sylveon do not. Altaria also has an extensive support movepool and an interesting niche ability in Cloud Nine, being the only viable passive weather stop in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame. This ability halts Swift Swim, Chlorophyll, Rain Dish, and Solar Power in their tracks, as well as forcing Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam to take two turns to use, leaving Mega Charizard Y open for a whole turn. However, Altaria's terrible base 80 Speed leaves it too fast for Trick Room while slightly too slow for standard playstyles, and its loss of its Flying typing leaves it vulnerable to Earthquake and other Ground-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roost can offer Altaria a bulkier set. Safeguard works if Altaria wants to become a bulky support variant, which is possible with max defenses, that can still hit decently with Hyper Voice. Draco Meteor can be used, but the coverage alongside Hyper Voice is very repetitive. Altaria also learns Rain Dance and Sunny Day to act as a weather inducer as well as a weather halter. Ice Beam threatens Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Assault Vest Rhyperior, Togekiss, and Salamence more than Hyper Voice, hitting a larger portion of the metagame for neutral damage than Altaria's other moves. Altaria also runs a RestTalk set quite well, with some combination of Hyper Voice, Ice Beam, Fire Blast, and Dragon Pulse as attacking moves as well as reliable recovery. However, this sort of set is much more predictable than Protect sets, and the 33% chance of Rest being chosen under Sleep Talk gives opponents a chance to give Altaria a strong hit or two that becomes difficult to recover from.</p> <p>Altaria can also run a physical Dragon Dance set with an Adamant nature, a spread of 64 HP / 192 Atk / 252 Spe, and Return / Facade and Earthquake. However, a physical set, however tempting, often falls short. The coverage provided is nearly identical to Mega Salamence, whose superior stats win out over Altaria. Flying-type moves also offer just as much, if not more, utility than Fairy-type ones, when hitting a major part of the physically defensive metagame neutrally.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Mawile and Metagross: Mega Mawile and Mega Metagross can both OHKO Altaria with their STAB moves. Both have priority moves that, though they don't OHKO, also whittle away at Altaria's health, and both can often take a Fire Blast with a small amount of investment.</p> <p><strong>Gengar: With STAB Sludge Bomb, Levitate, and Icy Wind, Gengar is a speed control giant that fears no Landorus and no amount of opposing speed control.</p> <p><strong>Pixilate + Hyper Voice Users: Gardevoir and Sylveon can outspeed and OHKO Mega Altaria. Mega Gardevoir has base 100 Speed and often runs Speed EVs to nearly guarantee outspeeding an unboosted Altaria, and super effective Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice needs a lot of investment to survive; while Sylveon can run a variety of EVs to either outspeed or out-damage Altaria, while its naturally high Special Defense makes it difficult to KO.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: 80 is a terrible base Speed tier, and both fast Pokemon and Trick Room teams can usually beat Altaria without a lot of team support. Speed control Pokemon such as Cresselia and Gothitelle can often take hits and set up speed control before Altaria can stop them. Trick Room sweepers such as Mega Mawile and Bisharp can then beat Mega Altaria before being hit.</p> <p><strong>Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur: Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur are incredibly specially bulky, use sleep moves, and have Sludge Bomb to hit Altaria super effectively. The only semi-reliable way to beat them is Fire Blast, which suffers from accuracy problems, and both Pokemon have incredible bulk and reliable recovery anyway.</p>",

A Fire-type move is for coverage on common Grass- and Steel-types, which otherwise wall Hyper Voice. Fire Blast deals the most damage, ensuring KOs on Ferrothorn, Amoonguss and Bisharp, but Flamethrower's 100% accuracy is hard to pass up, and it still hits hard. Tailwind is used to supplement Altaria's base 80 Speed, allowing it to outspeed a majority of the unboosted metagame, and support Altaria's teammates. Hidden Power Ground lets Altaria hit Heatran. Protect is a staple of VGC, allowing Altaria to scout, stall Trick Room and weather pre or post Mega-Evolution, and retain some longevity in a fast-paced game.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs allow Altaria to survive max Special Attack Mega Charizard Y's Overheat in sun, as well as max Attack Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence's Double-Edge. 60 Speed EVs under Tailwind are enough for Mega Altaria to outspeed Choice Scarf Adamant Landorus-T and all other Pokemon under 215 Speed, with Mega Altaria only being outsped by +1 Sharpedo, and positive-natured Mega Alakazam, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Aerodactyl. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Attack to allow Altaria to hit as hard as possible, OHKOing threats such as Mega Salamence and Bisharp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Altaria is not a standalone Pokemon and will need a good amount of team support and prediction to use effectively. However, users should not be afraid of leaving Altaria out of the fray if needed. Altaria is also best not used as a lead, so that it can use its Cloud Nine ability after weather has been activated, or come in as a bulky sweeper after some damage has already been dealt to opponents. However, despite its bulk, it doesn't always need to be the last Pokemon to survive either, and can be effectively used to deal massive amounts of damage to allow another Pokemon to clean up and secure the win.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Speed control is necessary. Suicune is a good Tailwind user, and its Ice Beam can often KO Mega Salamence with some investment, while Scald threatens Mega Metagross and Mega Mawile with a 30% burn chance. Cresselia also offers a lot of bulk and Icy Wind alongside Thunder Wave and Helping Hand, ensuring Altaria gets that extra boost in damage to hit neutral targets harder. Other priority users such as Thundurus and Talonflame help in a similar fashion, with priority speed control in Thunder Wave and Tailwind, respectively. Gengar also offers interesting support, with Icy Wind and Disable alongside great Speed. Intimidate is also good team support, ensuring longevity. Teammates such as 88 Speed Landorus-T often tempt out Bisharp, and Altaria can OHKO Bisharp before it uses Iron Head while resisting Sucker Punch. Arcanine can spread burns, has reliable healing in Morning Sun, and scares away Steel-types. Gyarados also has synergy with Altaria, offering different types of support, including Thunder Wave, Taunt, and Toxic alongside Intimidate, or offensive presence from offensive variants, while Mega Altaria's Electric resistance complements Gyarados's Steel resistance.</p>"

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydro Pump can be used to give Milotic a chance to OHKO Mega Mawile and Mega Manectric after a Competitive boost, and it hits decently hard even without Competitive boost. It, however, has a chance to miss, cannot burn foes, and has lower PP. Hidden Power Fire can be used if Ferrothorn bothers your team too much, while Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit opposing Water-types, but it's pretty weak. Safeguard and Light Screen can be used as well, but this role is better left for true support Pokemon such as Cresselia. As weird as it sounds, Choice Scarf can be used on Milotic. Choice Scarf Milotic with a Timid nature can outspeed Landorus-T, Terrakion, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence and OHKO them all with either Hydro Pump or Ice Beam. A Wacan Berry can be used to weaken the damage of one Electric-type move aimed at Milotic. With a Wacan Berry, 252 HP EVs, and 76 Special Defense EVs, Milotic can survive two of Rotom-W's Thunderbolts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Ludicolo, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur give Milotic a really hard time because Milotic can't hit them reliably. Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur can just Leech Seed Milotic avoiding Mirror Coat and slowly KO it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Thundurus and Rotom can fire off powerful Thunderbolts at Milotic. Rotom-W is especially annoying, as Milotic can't do anything against it if Milotic lacks Hidden Power Grass or Mirror Coat.</p> <p><strong>Preventing a Competitive Boost: Without a Competitive boost, Milotic can be dead weight if it can't hit super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Sun</strong>: Milotic hates sun, as its Water-type moves are pretty weak in sun. Mega Charizard Y can hit really hard with Solar Beam and is often paired with Grass-types.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Attacks: Even with a high amount of HP and Defense investment, Milotic doesn't enjoy taking powerful physical attacks such as Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Mega Mawile's Play Rough, and Talonflame's Brave Bird.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is a is STAB move and has a good chance to burn foes. Ice Beam offers great coverage, hitting threats such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Salamence, as well as Grass-types super effectively. Icy Wind, however, still hits targets with a 4x weakness to Ice hard, is a spread move, and offers Milotic the ability to provide speed control. Recover greatly increases Milotic's longevity, but it is unusable with Assault Vest. For the last slot, Protect is great option for Milotic to scout dangerous super effective attacks. On other hand, Mirror Coat allows Milotic to annoy powerful threats such as Rotom-W and Thundurus.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>236 HP and 140 Defense EVs allow Milotic to survive Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, while 132 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature allow Milotic to hit as hard as possible. Leftovers increases Milotic's longevity and works great with Recover. Sitrus Berry gives Milotic one-time healing, but in the long run it doesn't heal as much as Leftovers. With Assault Vest, Milotic can't use status moves, but it becomes very specially bulky. If you use Assault Vest, Icy Wind and Mirror Coat should be used over Recover and Protect. You can also invest more into Speed if you want to outspeed Rotom-W, or even base 100 Speed Pokemon after Icy Wind.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Milotic should be paired with physical attackers. Opponents will have two choices: either deal with a +2 Milotic or a physical attacker at normal power. Milotic can do lot of damage on the field if it manages to get a Competitive boost, and thanks to its great bulk, it is hard for opponents to take down. Typically, Milotic should tank hits while using Scald and occasionally Ice Beam or Icy Wind. Milotic can either lead for a potential Competitive boost if the opponent leads with an Intimidate user, or it can be saved for late-game to finish off weakened targets. You can also switch Milotic into a predicted Icy Wind to get a Competitive boost.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that hate Intimidate are good partners to Milotic; examples include almost every physical attacker, including Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Talonflame. Intimidate users are also good partners, because they help patch up Milotic's physical bulk. Arcanine deserves a special mention, as it has overall good type synergy with Milotic and has access to Will-O-Wisp, Intimidate, and Snarl to make itself and Milotic really annoying to take down. Bulky Grass-types are great partners to Milotic; for example, Amoonguss can absorb Electric-type attacks aimed at Milotic. Milotic also has good synergy with Mega Venusaur, which enjoys Milotic's ability to provide Icy Wind support and beat Mega Salamence. Mega Venusaur also beats bulky Water-types, which Milotic hates.</p>"

  "Salamence": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Salamence is one of the best Mega Evolutions of the format and should therefore be a top consideration when picking your team. Access to Intimidate before Mega Evolving helps provide excellent support, especially for partners like Amoonguss and Sylveon. Further, its great defensive stats and resistances to common types such as Fire, Water, and Grass make it easy for Salamence to switch in and out to activate it. Sets utilizing Draco Meteor tend to take advantage of this even more, as the Special Attack drops encourage switches. Aerilate and access to moves such as Double-Edge and Hyper Voice allow Mega Salamence to deal massive damage. Flying also has very good neutral coverage, so Mega Salamence can easily get away with running mono-Flying-type attacks. High Attack and Special Attack, and the movepool to support both, allow it to function with a variety of sets. The ability to go mixed is a big advantage Mega Salamence has over other Mega Evolutions. This can also make Mega Salamence difficult to deal with, as the opponent must guess the set in order to handle it appropriately. A high base Speed allows it to outpace the majority of the metagame, even ordinarily very fast foes such as Gengar and Terrakion. It is, however, vulnerable to all forms of speed control. A 4x weakness to Ice often leaves it threatened, as, despite Ice-types being uncommon, it's a common typing for coverage. When Intimidate support is unneeded, Mega Salamence can often face too much competition as a Mega Evolution to be optimal. For example, Mega Kangaskhan has a stronger Double-Edge, and Mega Gardevoir has a more powerful Hyper Voice.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A physical set without Dragon Dance is viable, but in general it's outclassed by the mixed set, which is able to accomplish almost the same thing with exclusively Double-Edge. Hydro Pump can be used to hit Fire- and Rock-types, particularly Rotom-H and Aerodactyl, which are immune to Earthquake. Rock Slide and Stone Edge are options to hit foes like Talonflame and Charizard super effectively. Rock Slide is particularly effective given Salamence's high Speed, as it's more likely than not that at least one foe will flinch. Dragon Claw could be used over Earthquake on the Dragon Dance set to hit a greater number of foes neutrally. Tailwind can be used over Draco Meteor on the mixed set in order to provide a form of speed control. Substitute could be used in the same slot in order to capitalize on passive turns from your opponent, allowing Mega Salamence to avoid being KOed by threatening attacks or crippled by status such as paralysis. Giga Impact hits very hard at the cost of a recharge turn, but it can OHKO foes that EV to survive Double-Edge. This can be particularly appealing if Mega Salamence is used with a teammate that knows Roar, such as Suicune, to help skip the recharge turn. Running different items such as Choice Scarf and Life Orb is possible if you'd like to bring Salamence and another Mega Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-type Pokemon: While Mega Salamence beats the majority of opposing Dragons, there are some exceptions. Choice Scarf Hydreigon, for example, can outspeed non-Dragon Dance variants of Mega Salamence and OHKO them with Draco Meteor. Opposing Mega Salamence are also able to at least Speed tie with it and can threaten an OHKO with a Draco Meteor of their own.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon: Electric-types resist Mega Salamence's Flying-type moves and often carry Hidden Power Ice. Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Thundurus are great examples, as they're also immune to Mega Salamence's Earthquake. They should still be wary of Draco Meteor, however, as it can deal a large amount of damage to them if they're not specially defensive.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: While they're often OHKOed by Double-Edge, Fairies have an easy time OHKOing Mega Salamence themselves with their high-powered STAB attacks. Sylveon's and Mega Gardevoir's Hyper Voice can hit Mega Salamence through Substitute and bypass redirection. Azumarill can survive Double-Edge and has a chance to OHKO Mega Salamence with an unboosted Play Rough. Mega Mawile takes reduced damage from Mega Salamence's Flying-type moves as a result of its Steel typing, and Play Rough deals excellent damage to it. It does have to be wary of Fire Blast, however, as, with some prior damage, it can be KOed by the move.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks: Ice-type Pokemon themselves are uncommon, but Ice is a common typing for coverage, which is problematic due to Mega Salamence's 4x weakness to it. Weavile is the most common Ice-type and has a great matchup against Mega Salamence, as it can outspeed and OHKO it. Cresselia and Porygon2 have the bulk to survive any attack from Mega Salamence and can retaliate with Ice Beam. Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Suicune, and Politoed can also threaten an OHKO on Mega Salamence with Ice Beam and additionally have the option of Icy Wind, which can hit Mega Salamence through redirection and lower its Speed. Gengar is also a notable user of Icy Wind, and it may have multiple opportunities to use the move because it commonly runs Focus Sash. Swift Swim users such as Ludicolo and Kingdra can outspeed Mega Salamence in the rain and can OHKO it with Ice Beam. Greninja outspeeds maximum Speed Mega Salamence and gains STAB on Ice Beam thanks to its Protean ability.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon: Rock-types often resist Flying-type attacks, and Rock Slide hits Mega Salamence through redirection. Tyranitar takes little damage from Mega Salamence's special moves as a result of sand boosting its Special Defense. Aerodactyl easily outpaces Mega Salamence and can use Wide Guard to block Mega Salamence's Hyper Voice. Mega Aerodactyl is also notable, as it can deal excellent damage to Mega Salamence with a Tough Claws-boosted Ice Fang. Terrakion doesn't resist Flying as a result of its Fighting typing, but it can deal good damage with Rock Slide or Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon: Steel-types resist both Flying- and Dragon-type attacks and therefore have a relatively easy time against Mega Salamence. Heatran, while 4x weak to Earthquake, is free to either set up a Substitute or use Flash Cannon against Mega Salamence. Further, if Heatran carries Hidden Power Ice, it can just outright OHKO it. Aegislash takes little damage from Fire- and Ground-type moves and can gain boosts from them thanks to its Weakness Policy. In fact, the boost from Weakness Policy is enough to allow Aegislash to OHKO Mega Salamence with its STAB moves. Its access to Wide Guard also means it can block Mega Salamence's Hyper Voice and Earthquake. Mega Metagross is not affected by Intimidate before Mega Evolving due to Clear Body and can OHKO Mega Salamence with Ice Punch. Its massive Defense stat also means that it takes Earthquake very well, not even being OHKOed at +2.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: While the commonness of mixed and special sets means Intimidate and burns won't necessarily hamper all Mega Salamence, they are nevertheless effective at reducing the damage output of Mega Salamence's physical attacks. Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Gyarados, and opposing Salamence are able to lower Mega Salamence's Attack one stage when switched in. Will-O-Wisp users such as Talonflame, Gengar, and Rotom-W can halve Mega Salamence's Attack stat and inflict residual damage through burn. Entei can also attempt to fish for burns with Sacred Fire, as the move has a 50% chance to burn its target.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: As most Mega Salamence sets rely on their very high Speed, ways of reducing it are harmful for it. Thunder Wave users such as Thundurus and Gyarados are able to quarter Mega Salamence's Speed and reduce the chance of it moving. Tailwind users such as Talonflame, Whimsicott, and Zapdos can temporarily double their team's Speed. Trick Room users such as Gardevoir, Cresselia, and Gothitelle can allow normally slower foes to move before Mega Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Defiant and Competitive: Salamence's Intimidate activates Defiant and Competitive, causing their users' respective stats to increase. Bisharp and Milotic are the most prominent users and can significantly threaten Mega Salamence with Sucker Punch and Ice Beam or Icy Wind after a boost.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Double-Edge, boosted by Aerilate, is one of Mega Salamence's strongest attacks, but it comes at the cost of inflicting recoil damage. Double-Edge notably provides an option for when Mega Salamence's Special Attack has been lowered by the use of Draco Meteor. Hyper Voice, which also gets the boost from Aerilate, deals spread damage backed by Mega Salamence's Special Attack. It makes for a good option when Mega Salamence's Attack has been lowered by a foe's Intimidate. Draco Meteor provides a finisher for dealing with opposing Dragons or picking up KOs on foes with low Special Defense. It also provides a means to hit Electric-types such as Thundurus and Rotom-A at least neutrally. A Fire-type attack such as Fire Blast or Flamethrower can be used in place of Draco Meteor if needed, as it's important to have at least one Fire-type attack on your team in order to deal with Ferrothorn. In a similar vein, Earthquake can be used over Hyper Voice or Draco Meteor if you need a way to hit Heatran super effectively. Protect allows Salamence to defend itself for a turn, allowing its partner time to eliminate a foe or switch, or gain the Speed increase from Mega Evolving safely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Intimidate is the far better ability compared to the alternative, Moxie, as it provides support by lowering the foe's Attack. A Naive nature and 252 Speed EVs are used to outspeed as many foes as possible, notably opposing Mega Salamence, Terrakion, and Gengar. A Hasty nature is not used, as it takes less advantage of Intimidate and Mega Salamence's Special Defense is not so much of a factor in surviving attacks. 44 Attack EVs are used to allow Mega Salamence to OHKO 252 HP / 4 Def Mega Gardevoir with Double-Edge. The 212 Special Attack EVs are mostly leftover, but they importantly make Hyper Voice a 2HKO against 4 HP Landorus-T the majority of the time. You may opt to change the number of Attack EVs used to suit your needs, such as dropping to 20 Attack EVs to OHKO maximum Defense Amoonguss. If Earthquake is chosen, an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe is recommended to OHKO uninvested Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set aims to deal as much damage as possible with Double-Edge and Draco Meteor to pick up quick KOs. Generally, you'll want to use Hyper Voice until a foe is put into KO range of either Double-Edge or Draco Meteor. Try to bring Salamence in during the early-game or as a lead, as this allows it to take better advantage of Intimidate. An exception is if a Defiant or Competitive user is seen at Team Preview, when caution should be given to doing so. Don't always Mega Evolve if you plan to simply use Protect, as Intimidate can be good to preserve for later on in the battle. Be aware of Mega Salamence's higher Speed compared to its base forme on the you choose to Mega Evolve it; utilize Protect to gain this safely where necessary. Don't be too afraid of Draco Meteor's Special Attack drops, as Mega Salamence can just switch to using Double-Edge afterwards. Be cautious of Double-Edge's recoil, and use another move if you think it'll put Mega Salamence into KO range of a foe's move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that are able to beat users of Ice-type moves such as Water-types and Cresselia are valuable. Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus can accomplish the former with their STAB Thunderbolt. Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Ludicolo, and Serperior also beat Water-types and are able to beat Rock-types as well. Amoonguss, as a Poison-type, further provides resistances to Fairy, which Mega Salamence is weak to. The Grass / Fighting types Virizion and Breloom can also handily beat Water-types as well as Steel-types such as Bisharp. Dark-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile deal excellently with Cresselia, being immune to Psychic. Bisharp and Milotic can also dissuade opposing Intimidate users with Defiant and Competitive. Tyranitar is notable as well, since it pairs well with Mega Salamence on a sand archetype with partners like Landorus. Allies capable of dealing with Fairy-types are great, as Fairy-types can very often OHKO Mega Salamence. Steel-types such as Aegislash, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn can beat Fairies and also help beat Rock-types. Aegislash can also use Wide Guard to defend Mega Salamence against spread moves like Icy Wind and Rock Slide.</p> <p>Fairies of your own such as Azumarill and Sylveon can switch into Dragon-type moves and OHKO Dragons back. Sylveon and Assault Vest Azumarill specifically also appreciate Intimidate to patch up their weaker Defense stat. Steel-types wall both of Mega Salamence's STAB moves, so teammates that can beat them are useful. Ground-types such as Excadrill, Swampert, and Gastrodon can do this as well as beat Rock-types. Swampert, like Aegislash, can also use Wide Guard to defend Mega Salamence against spread moves. Fire-types such as Talonflame, Arcanine, and Heatran beat Steel-types and provide a resistance to Fairy. Greninja can beat a variety of threats such as opposing Dragons with Ice Beam and Fairies with Gunk Shot. Politoed enjoys Mega Salamence's presence on rain teams, as Mega Salamence can beat Grass-types for them. In return, Politoed's Water-type moves help deal with Heatran and Rock-type attackers such as Tyranitar and Terrakion. Rain teams often also struggle with balancing physical and special attackers, which Double-Edge helps with.</p>"

      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance is the biggest reason to use a physically based Mega Salamence, boosting Attack and Speed by one stage. Return is Mega Salamence's best option for an Aerilate-boosted attack without any drawbacks. Double-Edge is an alternative if you need an increase in damage output at the cost of recoil damage, notably guaranteeing an immediate OHKO against Sylveon. Earthquake helps to deal with the Steel-, Rock-, and Electric-types that wall Mega Salamence's Flying-type STAB move. Heatran is a prime example of this, as it ordinarily takes little damage from Mega Salamence's STAB moves, but is very threatened by Earthquake. It also gives Mega Salamence a spread move to better sweep through teams with, which this set would otherwise lack. If you prefer Mega Salamence be able to stick around for extended periods, Roost can accomplish this by healing it for half of its health. It also briefly removes Mega Salamence's Flying typing, which can be notable for surviving super effective attacks like Stone Edge. Roost is particularly attractive if Salamence is using a bulkier EV spread, as that would take better advantage of it. Protect shields Salamence for a turn, allowing a partner to potentially KO a threat or switch to improve positioning. Since regular Salamence is slower than Mega Salamence, Protect can also be used to speed up in safety. Further, since Mega Salamence can be a big threat to the opponent's team after setting up, Protect is useful for punishing attacks that are more likely to be aimed at it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Intimidate is Salamence's better ability, as dropping the foe's Attack stat helps it set up with Dragon Dance. An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs are used to improve Mega Salamence's damage output as much as possible. A Jolly nature can be used instead if you'd prefer to outspeed foes such as Terrakion and Gengar before a Dragon Dance. The remaining 252 EVs are placed in Speed to allow Mega Salamence to outpace the greatest number of foes. Bulkier spreads such as 84 HP / 132 Atk / 4 Def / 148 SpD / 140 Spe are viable to improve Mega Salamence's bulk. They allow Return to OHKO 252 HP / 4 Def Mega Gardevoir nearly all the time, make Terrakion's Rock Slide a 3HKO and neutral-natured Politoed's Ice Beam a 2HKO, and let Mega Salamence outspeed Jolly Landorus-T. Bulkier spreads with a Jolly nature are a possibility as well, such as 52 HP / 172 Atk / 4 Def / 84 SpD / 196 Spe. These outrun Mega Lucario, make Terrakion's Rock Slide a 3HKO and Suicune's Ice Beam a 2HKO, and OHKO the majority of Suicune with a +1 Helping Hand-boosted Return. Don't use either of these spreads with Double-Edge, however, as the recoil damage will mean Mega Salamence won't survive those attacks anyway.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set aims to set up a Dragon Dance before sweeping through the opponent's team with powerful attacks. While most setup sweepers prefer being brought out in the late-game, Salamence is an exception due to Intimidate. Be wary of Defiant and Competitive users should you choose to lead with Salamence, though. Try to keep Mega Salamence defended by a redirector for as long as it's on the field so that it can continue setting up and sweeping safely. You may not want to Mega Evolve immediately if you're using Protect in order to preserve Intimidate for later in the battle. Be aware of Salamence's lower base Speed in comparison to Mega Salamence's on the turn you Mega Evolve it to avoid being caught off guard. Dragon Dance, while generally good, is especially nice when used on a predicted Protect, switch, or weak attack from a foe. If Double-Edge is chosen, be careful that the recoil damage it inflicts doesn't put Mega Salamence into a foe's KO range.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Follow Me or Rage Powder support is very valuable for helping Mega Salamence set up, as it can defend it against damage and crippling status. Follow Me Clefable and Clefairy, being Fairy-types, are generally the best candidates for this, being immune to Dragon-type attacks. Clefable has the advantage of not being forced into using Eviolite and can instead use items such as Sitrus Berry or Rocky Helmet, although Clefairy's Friend Guard is valuable to reduce the damage of spread attacks like Rock Slide. Both can also use Moonblast to KO opposing Dragons or Helping Hand to further boost the power of Mega Salamence's attacks. Amoonguss or Togekiss may also be considered for the role, although you must bear in mind they share some weaknesses with Mega Salamence. Partners capable of dealing with users of Ice-type attacks such as Cresselia and Water-types are also helpful. Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus can handle Water-types with their STAB Thunderbolt. Grass-types such as Ludicolo and Serperior can equally beat Water-types in addition to Rock-types. Breloom and Virizion, being part Fighting-type, are also great, as they resist Rock and beat Steel-types.</p> <p>Dark-types such as Bisharp, Tyranitar, and Weavile can beat Cresselia with their STAB moves. Weavile is notable, as Fake Out can grant Mega Salamence the opportunity to set up a Dragon Dance more safely. Bisharp and Milotic are also able to deter Intimidate users with Defiant and Competitive, respectively. Pokemon capable of dealing with Fairy-types are also good teammates, as Mega Salamence is weak to their STAB attacks. Steel-types such as Aegislash, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn are good options that can deal with Rock-types as well. Aegislash is particularly great, as Wide Guard can shield Mega Salamence from spread moves like Rock Slide. Fairy-types of your own such as Azumarill and Sylveon are also useful to switch in on and beat opposing Dragons. Assault Vest Azumarill and Sylveon in particular really appreciate Intimidate for patching up their lower Defense. While this set can carry Earthquake, allies that beat Steel-types are still useful, as they wall Flying-type moves. For example, Ground-types such as Swampert and Gastrodon can deal a lot of damage to them with their STAB moves. Swampert, similarly to Aegislash, can also use Wide Guard to defend Mega Salamence against spread attacks. Fire-types such as Talonflame, Arcanine, and Heatran can also beat Steel-types and resist Fairy-type attacks. Greninja can aid Mega Salamence with a variety of coverage, such as Ice Beam to KO opposing Dragons or Gunk Shot to KO Fairies.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice is boosted by Aerilate and deals a good amount of spread damage. Draco Meteor serves as a strong single-target STAB attack able to KO even bulky Dragons, at the cost of lowering Mega Salamence's Special Attack. A Dragon-type move is also valuable for dealing at least neutral damage to Electric-types such as Rotom-W. Dragon Pulse can be used instead if you'd prefer to use a Dragon-type move without Draco Meteor's drawback. Fire Blast can hit Steel-types that resist Flying and Dragon super effectively, although it only has 85% accuracy. Flamethrower is an alternative if you'd prefer more accuracy, though the drop in power means that Mega Salamence is no longer guaranteed to pick up the OHKO on Ferrothorn, for example. Protect can shield Salamence for a turn, allowing its partner to KO a threat or switch out to improve positioning. Protect can also be used to help Salamence gain its all-important Speed from Mega Evolving more safely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Intimidate is the ability of choice, as Moxie is useless on a special attacker and Intimidate provides support by dropping both foes' Attack. 252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature are used to outspeed as many foes as possible. While a Modest nature may be tempting to increase Mega Salamence's damage output further, missing out on outspeeding key threats such as Gengar and Terrakion is generally not worth it. The remaining 252 EVs are then invested into Special Attack to improve Mega Salamence's damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is mostly aiming to deal as much damage as possible with Hyper Voice. Try to bring Salamence out in the early-game, or as a lead, in order get the maximum opportunities to take advantage of Intimidate. However, be aware of Defiant and Competitive users from Team Preview should you choose to lead with Salamence. Don't feel as though you have to Mega Evolve if you're just opting to Protect Salamence, as preserving Intimidate for later in the battle can be useful. Be conscious of the fact that Salamence has a lower Speed than Mega Salamence on the turn you Mega Evolve in order to avoid being outsped unnecessarily. Be careful of killing momentum with Draco Meteor if you have it, as this set has no physical move to fall back on. If Mega Salamence is your team's only option against Ferrothorn, be sure to preserve Mega Salamence until it's been eliminated.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Mega Salamence is 4x weak to Ice, allies that beat Ice-type attackers such as Cresselia and Water-types are valuable. Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Thundurus are able to do this with their strong STAB Thunderbolt. Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Ludicolo, and Serperior can also beat Water-types in addition to Rock-types. Amoonguss is further a Poison-type and therefore resists Fairy-type attacks for Mega Salamence. Breloom and Virizion, as Grass / Fighting types, beat Water-types and Steel-types such as Bisharp. Dark-types such as Tyranitar, Weavile, and Bisharp can beat Cresselia with their super effective STAB attacks. Tyranitar pairs particularly well with Mega Salamence on a sand archetype with partners such as Sand Rush Excadrill that can eliminate Rock- and Fairy-types. Other Steel-types such as Aegislash and Ferrothorn equally do a good job at eliminating the aforementioned foes. Aegislash can also use Wide Guard to shield Mega Salamence against spread moves like Icy Wind and Rock Slide. Using Fairy-types of your own such as Azumarill and Sylveon can be useful to beat opposing Dragons. Sylveon and Assault Vest Azumarill especially enjoy Salamence's Intimidate to patch up their lower Defense. Steel-types wall Mega Salamence's STAB moves, and it's therefore useful to have partners that can beat them. Ground-types such as Swampert and Gastrodon can beat Steel-types and also help beat Rock-types. Swampert, like Aegislash, can also use Wide Guard to block spread attacks. Fire-types such as Talonflame, Arcanine, and Heatran also beat Steel-types and resist Fairy-type attacks. Greninja can beat a variety of threats to Mega Salamence such as Dragons with Ice Beam and Fairies with Gunk Shot.</p>"

It is one of the best checks to Fairy-types, resisting their STAB attacks and hitting them back with a super effective Steel-type STAB move, which usually results in an OHKO. Clear Body lets it ignore Intimidate prior to Mega Evolving, which is rather unique amongst physical attackers. Unfortunately, it also gets hard countered by some of the most common Pokemon in the metagame, namely Heatran, Aegislash, and Bisharp, which all resist both its STAB attacks and can hit it back with their super effective STAB move. Mega Metagross has many coverage options, but it can't fit more than one of them into a set, as dual STAB moves and Protect are necessities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Punch is a niche pick if you want coverage for Water- and Flying-types. Earthquake gives Mega Metagross a spread attack, as well as coverage for Fire- and Electric-types. Hammer Arm allows it to beat Steel- and Dark-types, both which usually gives Mega Metagross trouble. Rock Slide is another option for a spread move and offers coverage for Flying-, Fire-, and Bug-types, in addition to having a chance to flinch the foe. If your Mega Evolution slot is taken already, you can run a regular Metagross set with either Lum Berry or Assault Vest.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types resist Steel-type attacks and deal super effective damage against Mega Metagross with their own STAB attacks. Many of the biggest Fire-type threats are special attackers, which is unfortunate, as Mega Metagross has a higher Defense than Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Ghost- and Dark-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Aegislash, Gengar, Bisharp, and Hydreigon pose a huge threat to Mega Metagross, as they have super effective STAB attacks to hit it with. Mega Metagross also does not pack any moves to hit these Pokemon for super effective damage, except Gengar, which is hit by Zen Headbutt.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Lowering its Attack either through Intimidate after Mega Evolution or by burning it makes Mega Metagross lose its high damage output, which renders it useless.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Iron Head provides Mega Metagross with a STAB attack and a slight chance to make the foe flinch. Meteor Mash is an option over Iron Head, offering a possibility for an Attack boost but coming with a chance to miss. Zen Headbutt is another STAB move, which beats Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Conkeldurr. Substitute allows Mega Metagross to ignore status, as well as avoid taking a lot of damage from hard hits. Ice Punch hits Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Garchomp for super effective damage. Bullet Punch gives Mega Metagross priority, which is useful to finish off Pokemon with Focus Sash. Protect lets Mega Metagross avoid unnecessary hits and double targeting.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature make Mega Metagross hit as hard and fast as possible. An optional spread for running Substitute is 60 HP / 188 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature. The HP EVs give Mega Metagross an HP stat of 163, which lets it set up four Substitutes and be left with 3 HP. This spread also makes positive-natured Mega Kangaskhan's second Sucker Punch do no more than 25 percent, leaving Mega Metagross able to set up a Substitute and survive a Sucker Punch from Mega Kangaskhan twice. In addition, Mega Metagross will always survive Sucker Punch from Bisharp without a boosting item after having one Substitute broken. 252 EVs in Speed and a Jolly nature lets Metagross utilize its amazing Speed tier to its fullest. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to maintain a high damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As many players are aware of how threatening Mega Metagross can be when it has set up a Substitute, you will often find your opponent aggressively targeting Metagross. Predicting correctly with Protect can give you crucial momentum, as your opponent might waste an entire turn double targeting Mega Metagross to try to break its Substitute and KO it while you just use Protect with it. If you fear Intimidate spam from your opponent, you can try to hold off on Mega Evolving for a bit, as it allows you to ignore Intimidate. When running Substitute, you must always look for opportunities to set up a Substitute, as getting Mega Metagross behind a Substitute can often be a game changer.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>In order to more freely set up Substitute, Fake Out support from Pokemon such as Scrafty and Hitmontop is appreciated. Mega Metagross fits perfectly onto rain teams, as rain neutralizes its Fire-type weakness. Most common rain sweepers also beat popular Earthquake users, essentially leaving Ghost- and Dark-types as the only threats to Mega Metagross under rain. Politoed and Ludicolo can easily form a rain core which does this job excellently. Rotom-W has excellent synergy with Metagross, as it is immune to Ground, and Mega Metagross resists Rotom-W's only weakness, Grass. Hydreigon, Tyranitar, and Scrafty make for good partners, as they patch up Mega Metagross's weakness to Ghost- and Dark-types. Scrafty also gets a special mention here, as it also can hit Dark-types for great damage due to its Fighting typing. Thundurus is also a great partner for Mega Metagross for a number of reasons. It provides Thunder Wave support, which can easily make Mega Metagross be the fastest Pokemon on the field and can help create free turns, which is especially nice when you run Substitute. Taunt support lets Mega Metagross avoid status prior to using Substitute and greatly helps its matchup against Aegislash, which is one of the biggest threats to Mega Metagross. Choice Scarf Landorus-T also has issues when facing both Mega Metagross and Thundurus, as it has to choose between locking itself into Earthquake, fearing Hidden Power Ice from Thundurus, and using Rock Slide, risking that Mega Metagross gets up a free Substitute.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Latias faces competition from similar Dragon-types, such as Latios and Hydreigon; however, it is much bulkier than they are and has access to a great support movepool. Because Latias has better defenses than its offensive brother, Latios, most Latias tend to go down the supportive route, as Latias is outclassed by Latios in every way offensively. Latias, however, faces competition from Cresselia as a supportive Psychic-type. Unlike most bulky Psychic-types, Latias has much more offensive presence and a much better Speed tier. It also works well against sun and rain teams, as Latias resists the weather-boosted attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Alternate support options include Heal Pulse, Light Screen, Reflect, Charm, and Healing Wish, which can be a major game changer by healing back a powerhouse Pokemon, such as Mega Kangaskhan or Mega Charizard Y. Icy Wind can also be used as an alternate speed control option. Latias has many other item choices at its disposal if Sitrus Berry is being used on a different Pokemon. Colbur Berry, Roseli Berry, Haban Berry, and Yache Berry are all viable item choices on Latias, as they can allow it to survive a hit that it normally wouldn't be able to, such as Draco Meteor or Pixilate Hyper Voice. Leftovers provides passive recovery for Latias. Draco Meteor or Dragon Pulse can be used should your team need the Dragon-type coverage. More offensive sets, such as a Choice Scarf set, can be used, though it is heavily outclassed by Latios in that department. A Calm Mind set with Latiasite is another viable choice for an offensive set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Defensive Typing Advantage: Many Steel-types, such as Aegislash, Metagross, and Heatran, can easily switch into Latias's STAB moves and force it out. Latias will be forced to run Hidden Power to hit some of these Pokemon. Certain Fairy-types, such as Togekiss and Clefable, can easily switch into Latias's attacks as well.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Typing Advantage: Faster Dragon-types, such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon, can force Latias out with their Dragon-type STAB moves. Dark-types, such as Tyranitar and Weavile, can easily force Latias out too, with the former being able to tank a Draco Meteor and the latter being able to outspeed Latias and hit it hard with a Knock Off. Offensive Fairy-types are a huge problem for Latias too. Sylveon can OHKO Latias with Hyper Voice, while Mega Gardevoir resists or is immune to both of Latias's STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: Latias's blistering Speed is one of its strong points over slower, bulkier Dragon-types, such as Hydreigon and Goodra. If that's taken away, Latias will not be as threatening, especially if it has used Draco Meteor already. Common speed control users, such as Clefable, Suicune, and Cresselia, can tank Latias's moves and cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt shuts down all of Latias's support options, leaving it with, at best, Psychic and Ice Beam. Latias will also be dead weight if the foe uses Taunt on it or after Latias has used Draco Meteor.</p>",

Psychic is Latias's Psychic-type STAB move and is used over Psyshock because Battle Spot Doubles is much more physically oriented, so defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur will tend to run more Defense investment. Tailwind is a form of speed control that gives Latias a niche over other bulky Psychic-types. Helping Hand allows Latias to support its teammate and compensate for its average offenses by boosting the power of its partner's attack, while Roost provides longevity.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Latias to take advantage of its Speed, which sets it apart from other bulky Psychic-types. 244 HP EVs provide good general bulk, while 12 Special Attack EVs allow Latias to OHKO bulky non-Assault Vest Landorus-T with Ice Beam and 2HKO standard Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur with Psychic. Sitrus Berry increases Latias's longevity without having to use Roost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Latias's Psychic / Dragon typing allows it to switch into a lot of common Pokemon, such as Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, and Thundurus, fairly easily. Latias's blistering Speed can allow it to set up Tailwind more easily than most support Pokemon, such as Togekiss.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T is a great partner for Latias, as it is able to use Earthquake without damaging Latias and can remove Steel-types that Latias has trouble breaking through, such as Aegislash and Heatran. Mamoswine greatly benefits from Tailwind and can also remove Steel-types, such as Heatran, that Latias cannot touch. Terrakion is also a nice partner due to its ability to hit Steel-types hard, while Latias can check Fighting-types and Amoonguss, which threaten Terrakion. Latias's ability to semi-check Landorus-T also greatly benefits Terrakion. Steel-types have great synergy with Latias, as they are able to remove Fairy-types as well as switch into Dragon- and Fairy-type moves aimed at Latias with ease. Specifically, Pokemon such as Aegislash, which can provide Wide Guard to block Hyper Voice from Mega Gardevoir and Sylveon, and Heatran, which can remove opposing Steel-types that wall Latias and also greatly benefits from Tailwind and Latias's ability to check opposing Fighting-types, are great partners for Latias. Mega Metagross checks opposing Fairy- and Ice-types and enjoys Helping Hand support as well as Latias's ability to check Landorus-T; however, both it and Latias are helpless against Aegislash and Bisharp.</p>"

Dragon Pulse can be used if you want a reliable move against Dragon-types but comes with much less power. Energy Ball can OHKO Swampert. Ice Beam can OHKO Landorus-T.

Psyshock hits Pokemon such as Assault Vest Conkeldurr and Sylveon harder than Psychic does, while the latter can still be used because, outside of those targets, it's the more powerful option. Tailwind lets Latios provide speed control. Helping Hand lets Latios support the team after a Draco Meteor, and Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran, which walls Latios otherwise.

Timid is preferred to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Pokemon such as other Dragon-types and Terrakion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Get in, use Draco Meteor, and use a support option if you have the time. Anticipate Draco Meteor switch-ins, because if your opponent has a Steel- or Fairy-type, they will almost always bring it in at the sight of Latios.

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>Infernape sits as one of the fastest available Fire-types in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame, only being beaten in that respect by Talonflame and Mega Houndoom. Despite this, however, it still suffers from being below the base 110 Speed tier, where threats such as Latios and Gengar sit. While Infernape might commonly be thought of as primarily an offensive Pokemon, it often takes more of a supportive approach in Battle Spot Doubles, making it a great user of moves such as Quick Guard and Fake Out. These moves allow Infernape to stand out as a supportive Fire-type over alternatives such as Arcanine, which is often preferred in that role thanks to its access to Intimidate, Morning Sun, and Snarl, as well as better bulk. Overall, while Infernape suffers as a result of its frailty, its decent offensive stats in combination with its support capabilities make it an interesting addition to teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flare Blitz can be used as an alternative to Overheat, but many of the foes weak to Fire, such as Ferrothorn and Scizor, have higher Defense than Special Defense. Heat Wave can also be used over Overheat, but although it hits both foes, it deals less damage to an individual Pokemon and is susceptible to being blocked by Wide Guard. A more offensive set with Life Orb can be attempted, utilizing moves such as Mach Punch, Gunk Shot, Rock Slide, and Thunder Punch, but Infernape's strengths generally lie in its support moves. Feint can be used to break a target's Protect for an ally. Infernape is just fast enough to make use of Encore, which can be especially useful to lock foes into support moves such as Fake Out and Trick Room. Taunt is another means of disrupting more supportive foes by preventing them from using these moves altogether. Finally, a Lum Berry can be used to block sleep and paralysis from preventing Infernape from doing its job.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Water-types such as Rotom-W and Milotic resist Infernape's Fire-type attacks and take little damage from Close Combat as a result of their natural bulk. In return, they either OHKO or deal massive damage to Infernape with their STAB attacks. Azumarill is also notable thanks to its Fairy typing allowing it to resist Fighting, although it doesn't appreciate Quick Guard blocking its Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Rhyperior can OHKO Infernape or bring it down to its Focus Sash easily with their strong STAB attacks. Furthermore, although Rhyperior is weak to Close Combat, it is barely 2HKOed by it.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Pokemon: Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Mega Gardevoir don't take much damage at all from Infernape's attacks due to the combination of resisting Fighting and high Special Defense stats, and they can deal solid damage back with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon: Flying-types resist Infernape's Fighting-type attacks, making it easy for them to switch in, and can hit Infernape super effectively with their STAB moves. Talonflame can OHKO Infernape with Brave Bird, but it should be wary of Quick Guard. Mega Salamence also resists Fire-type attacks thanks to its Dragon typing and can easily dispatch Infernape with Aerilate-boosted attacks.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out provides Infernape's teammates with more leeway to safely use their moves on the first turn. Overheat grants Infernape a strong Fire-type STAB attack that is capable of OHKOing the majority of Grass-, Bug-, Ice-, and Steel-types. Close Combat acts as a secondary STAB move primarily for Infernape to handle Rock- and Normal-types. Quick Guard is one of Infernape's niches, being able to block priority moves used against your side of the field such as Fake Out and Prankster Thunder Wave for a turn. If you feel Quick Guard is unneeded, however, Protect is a viable option to avoid unnecessary damage and to prevent double targeting as a means of dealing with Infernape's Focus Sash.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Focus Sash is used because Infernape is frail, and allowing it to take at least one hit means it doesn't struggle to get off its moves before being KOed. Blaze is the chosen ability, since it powers up Overheat when at low health, and this is a likely occurrence with Focus Sash. Note that Iron Fist does not boost the power of Close Combat, despite the implication. Maximum Speed EVs and a Naive nature are used to ensure that Infernape outspeeds as many foes as possible, most notably allowing it to Speed tie with other base 108 Speed Pokemon such as Terrakion and Virizion. A Naive nature is used over Hasty because most priority moves like Sucker Punch and Fake Out are physical. 100 Special Attack EVs are used to guarantee the OHKO on 4 HP Mega Metagross with Overheat. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack to boost the damage of Close Combat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Infernape is best used in the lead position to provide Fake Out support for its allies on the first turn. When considering which target to use Fake Out on, note that your opponent is likely to be completely aware of what the most obvious play is and will therefore try to outmaneuver you by using Protect. Therefore, using Fake Out on the target least likely to use Protect can be an effective means to prevent this. Infernape can't switch in on any attacks, since its defensive typing is poor, so wait until you're given a free opportunity to switch in. Switching Infernape out in order to preserve Fake Out for the late-game can be valuable to put pressure on your opponent at that time.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Infernape has particularly great synergy with Gardevoir, as Gardevoir resists Psychic-type moves and Infernape deals with Steel-types that give Gardevoir trouble such as Aegislash and Heatran. Gardevoir also enjoys the free space that Fake Out provides. Rotom-W also has amazing synergy with Infernape, being immune to Ground-type moves and beating Ground- and Water-types. In return, Infernape is able to beat Grass-types for Rotom-W. Setup Pokemon such as Tailwind and Substitute users appreciate Infernape's Fake Out support in order to get off their moves. Users of powerful spread attacks such as Landorus-T, Mega Charizard Y, and Tyranitar also appreciate Fake Out support, as this can neutralize the Pokemon on the opposing side that would be the biggest threat to them. The damage dealt by spread moves can also help put the opposing Pokemon into KO range of Infernape's attacks. Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Swampert are good teammates, since Infernape resists almost no spread attacks and is weak to Earthquake and Aerilate Hyper Voice. Blocking spread moves is also beneficial because they make it easier to break Infernape's Focus Sash.</p>"

Brave Bird gives Staraptor some offensive presence in case Final Gambit is not needed. Close Combat allows Staraptor to deal heavy damage to Steel- and Rock-types, such as Tyranitar. U-turn allows Staraptor to switch out and Intimidate shuffle, while Double-Edge is a stronger STAB move that is good against Electric-types that have higher HP, such as Zapdos.

First, look at the opponent's team and determine what threatens your team the most; save Staraptor's Final Gambit for that Pokemon.

Setup Pokemon are usually good partners for Staraptor because Staraptor can remove threats to that Pokemon and give it an easier time setting up. Mega Kangaskhan is a great Staraptor partner. Staraptor's Intimidate can add to Mega Kangaskhan's bulk by weakening opposing physical attackers, and Staraptor's Final Gambit can KO Pokemon that threaten Mega Kangaskhan while also opening up opportunities for Mega Kangaskhan to set up with Power-Up Punch. Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out can also increase the chances of Staraptor getting off its Final Gambit safely. Staraptor can KO a threat to Mega Salamence, which gives it an opportunity to set up with Dragon Dance. Intimidate also weakens the opponent's physical attackers, which gives Mega Salamence an easier time setting up Dragon Dance. Bisharp and Hydreigon can get rid of Ghost-types that Staraptor has trouble against, such as Aegislash. Staraptor, in turn, can check Fighting-types that threaten Bisharp and Hydreigon or just open a way for them to deal massive damage by using Final Gambit against a threat.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon has always been an interesting Pokemon in Battle Spot Doubles, as its solid typing and ability can make it a valuable asset to certain teams. What makes Gastrodon unique is its ability Storm Drain, which redirects Water-type moves to Gastrodon and boosts its Special Attack by one stage in the process. Gastrodon's typing also allows it to deal significant damage to a lot of the popular Steel-, Ground-, and Fire-type Pokemon that currently dominate the metagame. While the typing has its perks, it also curses Gastrodon with a crippling 4x weakness to Grass, which leaves it at the mercy of Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, Virizion, and Mega Venusaur. Gastrodon possesses reasonable bulk, which grants it the ability to survive most of the strongest attacks in the metagame, but its low Speed means that it is going to be moving last the majority of the time.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set can be viable, but being unable to switch moves can be detrimental to Gastrodon.  Stockpile boosts Gastrodon's bulk, but cuts down on its coverage and makes it less of an actual threat. Running Recover alongside Stockpile is recommended to keep Gastrodon healthy through the match. Icy Wind can be used for speed control, but Gastrodon is too slow to take advantage of this. Another issue is that Icy Wind can trigger Defiant and Competitive from Bisharp and Milotic, respectively. Rindo Berry neuters Grass-type moves aimed at Gastrodon, but it only works once, which makes it not worth it most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-type Pokemon are the best possible counters for Gastrodon, as they can OHKO Gastrodon with their STAB moves. Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn can shrug off any attack Gastrodon throws at it and OHKO Gastrodon with Giga Drain and Power Whip, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y: Mega Charizard Y gives Gastrodon a miserable time, as it is immune to Earth Power, weakens Scald's damage output with Drought, and OHKOes Gastrodon easily with Solar Beam.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls and Tanks</strong>: Unfortunately, Gastrodon does not possess enough offensive power to dent special walls and tanks such as Cresselia, Sylveon, Jellicent, and Clefable.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power is Gastrodon's best Ground-type STAB move and is able to do plenty of damage to common Steel-, Fire-, and Rock-type Pokemon. Scald deals good damage and potentially inflicts burns, which can vastly improve Gastrodon's chances against popular physical attackers. Ice Beam rounds out Gastrodon's coverage by allowing it to deal heavy damage to Flying-types that would not be harmed by its other moves. Protect prevents Gastrodon from taking damage that turn. This alleviates any concern of getting double targeted or being taken out by a surprise Grass move. Muddy Water is a decent spread move that allows Gastrodon to potentially lower both targets' accuracy, but the accuracy of the move itself makes it a bit ill-advised. Recover can improve Gastrodon's longevity, but cuts down on its coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Gastrodon to survive a Double-Edge from Jolly Mega Kangaskhan and Jolly Mega Salamence. The physical bulk is also necessary for taking big hits from heavy hitters such as Terrakion, Mega Salamence, and Mega Metagross so Gastrodon can retaliate with the appropriate moves. The Special Attack investment allows Gastrodon to OHKO 4 HP / 0 SpD Terrakion with Earth Power and gives it a 56.3% chance to OHKO 4 HP Mega Metagross. Expert Belt is recommended because it helps Gastrodon get the needed KOs on the aforementioned Pokemon without hindering Gastrodon's longevity or coverage. 27 Speed IVs should be used in order to underspeed Aegislash and OHKO its Blade forme with Earth Power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Gastrodon is meant to be played more offensively as to net some surprise KOs, unlike the traditional bulky Gastrodon, which can become a burden after a certain point. With its niche being Storm Drain, Gastrodon works best at switching in on a predicted Water move to protect its ally as well as gain a Special Attack boost, making it a threat on the field. This turns Gastrodon into a viable check to rain teams, as it is able to prevent the onslaught of the boosted Water-type moves that every rain team carries. However, slapping Gastrodon on a team just to beat rain is not always recommended, because rain teams often have ways of dealing with it, such as by means of Ludicolo. Gastrodon does well against the omnipresent Thundurus and Landorus, as it can shrug off their attacks reasonably well (barring Choice Specs-boosted Grass Knot) and retaliate with a strong hit. Gastrodon also beats Rotom-W, as it is immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB moves and does not mind Will-O-Wisp that much, but don't be too comfortable, as Gastrodon cannot do much back to Rotom-W.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran and Gastrodon make up a solid core, as they can cover each other's weaknesses very well. Gastrodon can maul Ground-types for Heatran and also keep it safe from Water moves, while Heatran can maul the Grass-types that Gastrodon greatly fears. Other bulky Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Arcanine, and Entei have good typing synergy with Gastrodon and can aid it in burning targets with Will-O-Wisp and Sacred Fire. Gastrodon has a bit of a hard time breaking through specially bulky Pokemon such as Sylveon and Cresselia, which makes Bisharp a solid partner. Mega Salamence makes for a good partner, as it is able to take advantage of Gastrodon's ability to weaken Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon, and it can set up Dragon Dances on Grass-types. Gastrodon's low Speed stat makes it a decent option for a Trick Room team, as it would be able to get the damage off before taking heavy hits. Slowbro is a strong Trick Room setting partner for Gastrodon, as it is slower under Trick Room and can use Surf to boost Gastrodon's Special Attack via Storm Drain.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power is Gastrodon's most powerful STAB move. Ice Beam grants excellent super effective coverage and complements Earth Power well, as together, they hit almost every Pokemon at least neutrally. Scald provides a secondary STAB option and has a good chance to burn foes. Recover can be used either in place of or alongside Protect and increases Gastrodon's longevity. Protect shields Gastrodon, granting its partner a turn to react to the foes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry is used to further increase Gastrodon's longevity and prevent a number of 2HKOs, such as from Terrakion's Close Combat. However, due to Item Clause, Leftovers is a good alternative if Sitrus Berry is held by another teammate, as Gastrodon's bulk grants it sufficient opportunities to rack up recovery. A Modest nature is chosen because it boosts Gastrodon's Special Attack, maximizing its damage output. Using a Quiet nature and 0 Speed IVs is an alternative that can help Gastrodon either function on or counter Trick Room teams, as its Speed is already very low. The given HP and Defense EVs prevent Gastrodon from being OHKOed by Adamant Mega Salamence's Double-Edge, the Special Attack EVs allow Gastrodon to OHKO 4 HP Mega Salamence with Ice Beam, and the remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense for added bulk. 27 Speed IVs are used to underspeed minimum Speed Aegislash and OHKO it after it has changed to Blade forme.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Unlike more offensive variants, this Gastrodon can defend teammates with Storm Drain for extended periods. When not defending a teammate, however, unless aiming for a Scald burn, avoid staying in to use weak neutral attacks, as Gastrodon's damage output is fairly underwhelming. In fact, barring an excessive number of boosts, don't be overly concerned about losing boosts gained from Storm Drain if Gastrodon needs to switch out, as its damage output isn't too impressive regardless. Without Recover, Gastrodon is generally best kept in the back, ready to switch into predicted Water-type moves, and when using Recover, Gastrodon can work as a late-game wincon thanks to its bulk and lack of weaknesses.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gastrodon's Storm Drain protects Fire-types such as Heatran, Talonflame, and Blaziken from Water-type moves, and they can threaten the Grass-types that hit Gastrodon super effectively. In return, Gastrodon can KO Rock- and Ground-types that threaten Fire-types with its super effective STAB moves. Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Aerodactyl are also protected from Water-type moves, and Gastrodon can also deal with Ground-types that threaten them. Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mega Camerupt, despite sharing a typing with Gastrodon, equally appreciate the protection from Water-type moves. Mega Camerupt is particularly notable, as it's 4x weak to Water. Physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, and Mega Mawile appreciate being defended against Scald burns, and Gastrodon can also use Ice Beam against common Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Salamence. Psychic-type Trick Room setters such as Cresselia, Gardevoir, and Gothitelle can set up the field condition for Gastrodon on Trick Room teams, and they can often threaten opposing Grass-types, as many of them have a secondary Poison typing.</p>"

Unfortunately, with the reintroduction of Landorus-T for this season, Garchomp finds itself somewhat outclassed and even at the mercy of Landorus-T's Ground-type immunity and Intimidate. Still, Garchomp is naturally faster than Landorus-T, meaning it doesn't need a Choice Scarf to outspeed and deal with important threats such as Mega Charizard Y. It also fares just as well against most Pokemon as Landorus-T does.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Garchomp can use Substitute and Swords Dance if you're willing to miss out on Rock Slide. Mega Garchomp has its uses as a dedicated or a secondary Mega Evolution, but the opportunity cost for not using another Mega Evolution is pretty high. Fire Fang and Fire Blast allow Garchomp to take on Steel-types that take negligible damage from Earthquake, particularly Ferrothorn. Iron Head lets Garchomp do hefty damage to Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Togekiss. In terms of other item options, Garchomp can run reasonably effective Choice Band and Choice Scarf sets. Haban Berry and Yache Berry are also useful, though with Garchomp's diverse array of weaknesses, a Focus Sash usually does the job better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-types: Mamoswine, Greninja, and Weavile can all OHKO Garchomp with their STAB Ice-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ice Beam: Cresselia, Suicune, Milotic, Ludicolo, and Politoed can all take a hit from Garchomp and either severely damage it or OHKO it outright with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Other Dragon-types: Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Mega Salamence, and Latios can all outspeed Garchomp and knock it out with a Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Mega Altaria, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon can KO Garchomp with their STAB Fairy-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Under Trick Room, Pokemon such as Jellicent, Mega Mawile, and Abomasnow can get the jump on Garchomp and knock it out.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate: Landorus-T, Scrafty, Gyarados, and Hitmontop all make Garchomp's life a lot harder by lowering its Attack one stage, drastically reducing its offensive prowess.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp:Sableye, Gengar, and especially Rotom-W can easily burn Garchomp, crippling it severely.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Claw gives Garchomp a powerful single-target attack. Earthquake is an excellent, powerful spread move, though you'll need an appropriate partner that can dodge the attack. Rock Slide hits some specific troublesome targets, specifically Mega Charizard Y. Stone Edge ensures an OHKO against Mega Charizard Y and lets Garchomp bypass Wide Guard, but it is inaccurate. Protect has all its typical uses. It allows Garchomp to preserve itself to avoid double targeting or let a partner deal with a major threat.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread is a simple split between Attack and Speed. If you're interested in surviving specific attacks, a spread of 12 HP / 204 Atk / 4 Def / 36 SpD / 252 Spe allows Garchomp to survive Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Ice. Investing 12 HP EVs and 84 Defense EVs lets Garchomp survive the combination of Jolly Mega Kangaskhan and Adamant Life Orb Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Surviving the combination of those hits is pretty crucial, as Garchomp is one of the best answers to both of them. Focus Sash lets Garchomp take any one hit, particularly a strong Ice Beam, Draco Meteor, or Sylveon's Hyper Voice. Life Orb sacrifices Garchomp's bulk for extra power, pushing a lot of 3HKOs and 2HKOs into 2HKOs and OHKOs. Lum Berry helps Garchomp take on Spore, Will-O-Wisp, and Dark Void users with confidence. Rocky Helmet is also great for catching Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out while generally punishing physical attackers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Garchomp has trouble OHKOing most Pokemon, so it's best to either bring it out for a late-game sweep or to bring it out early-game to get off some big chunks of damage. Garchomp's Rough Skin punishes Fake Out, so its partner will mostly be targeted by the attack. You can use this as an opportunity to switch out or use Protect on Garchomp's partner. Outside of that, Garchomp is a very straightforward Pokemon. Do as much damage as you can and stay away from Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that benefit from Mega Charizard Y being gone appreciate Garchomp as a teammate. Mega Mawile and Aegislash are great options, especially because they also take care of Fairy and Dragon-types for Garchomp. Cresselia, Thundurus, Rotom-W, Gardevoir, and most Pokemon immune to Earthquake are wonderful partners for Garchomp. Mega Charizard Y makes a really nasty combo with Garchomp thanks to all of their highly damaging spread attacks. Togekiss provides great redirectional support for Garchomp; it's also immune to Dragon and can even set up Tailwind.</p>"

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite Mega Lucario's terrible bulk, it makes up for it with its nice offensive typing, decent Speed, and high Attack and Special Attack stats coupled with the ability Adaptability ,which allows Mega Lucario to deal a ton of damage, even against Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, and OHKO a lot of common Pokemon in the metagame such as Heatran, Bisharp, Terrakion, and Mega Kangaskhan. Lucario is also a really great check to Mega Kangaskhan thanks to Lucario having Inner Focus, which makes it, pre-Mega Evolution, \"immune\" to Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Outs. Lucario, however, is easily walled by common Pokemon such as Aegislash and Thundurus, and it faces competition from Terrakion and Virizion. Unlike Terrakion and Virizion, though, Lucario can run a mixed or special set which makes it less crippled by Intimidate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A full physical set works for Mega Lucario; however, Lucario lacks a strong and reliable physical Steel-type move and running a physical set will make it more susceptible to Intimidate. A full special set works too, with Aura Sphere over Close Combat. Stone Edge is another option to hit Mega Charizard Y and Thundurus. Both Vacuum Wave and Feint are alternate priority moves, with the latter being able to nullify Protect. Nasty Plot or Swords Dance could be used should you want to increase Mega Lucario's damage output further. A Follow Me set with a Focus Sash is an option for regular Lucario; however, that set is very niche.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>STAB Type Resistance: Pokemon that resist both of Mega Lucario's STAB attacks, such as Aegislash, can effortlessly wall it and set up on it. Mega Lucario's powerful Adaptability-boosted STAB moves make it stand out from its competitors.</p> <p><strong>Typing Advantage: Most super effective attacks will OHKO Mega Lucario pretty easily due to its low bulk. Mach Punch and Talonflame's Brave Bird are both moves that Mega Lucario should watch out for.</p> <p><strong>Status: Burn and paralysis are the main statuses that will cripple Mega Lucario immensely. Burn will lower Mega Lucario's damage output while paralysis will lower its nice Speed. Both Mega Lucario's power and Speed are its main selling points against other similar Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Mega Lucario's Speed is one of its selling points. If that is taken away, it's a sitting duck, as the foe can easily take advantage of Mega Lucario's bad defenses and OHKO it.</p>",
    "sets": [

        "name": "Mixed Mega Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Mega Lucario's strongest STAB move, which hits really hard in conjunction with Adaptability and should be its go-to move against Pokemon that don't resist Fighting. The Defense and Special Defense drops from Close Combat don't affect Mega Lucario too much considering its bulk isn't the best to begin with. Flash Cannon is Mega Lucario's secondary STAB move and hits Fairy-types as well as other Pokemon that resist Close Combat. Substitute allows Mega Lucario to take a hit or block status, such as burn and paralysis, both of which will cripple Mega Lucario immensely. Bullet Punch is a STAB priority move that can help Mega Lucario pick off weakened Pokemon that are faster than it, while Extreme Speed is another priority move that helps Mega Lucario pick off weakened Talonflame. Detect shields Lucario from a potential OHKO and allows it to gain the Speed boost of its Mega forme. Detect is used over Protect just in case it encounters a Pokemon with Imprison, which would shut down Mega Lucario's ability to use Protect and can easily give the foe an opportunity to capitalize on Mega Lucario's low bulk. The low PP isn't an issue, as both Mega Lucario and most Battle Spot Doubles games won't last long enough to use it all up.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs are used so that Mega Lucario can take advantage of its base 112 Speed and because investing in bulk isn't needed at all for it. Maximum Attack EVs increase Mega Lucario's damage output for Close Combat. A Naive nature is the best, as it boosts Mega Lucario's Speed without affecting any of its offensive stats. Lucarionite is the best item, as it gives Lucario a boost in offense and Speed while giving it Adaptability. Lucario's ability should be Inner Focus as that makes it \"immune\" to Fake Out, which can allow it to check and pressure Mega Kangaskhan leads.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thanks to Lucario's powerful STAB moves and immunity to Fake Out, it isn't a bad lead, as it can put pressure on your opponent right from the get-go as well as threaten Mega Kangaskhan leads. Because Mega Lucario's bulk is bad, it isn't recommended to switch it into attacks. Close Combat should be Mega Lucario's go-to move against Pokemon that don't resist Fighting-type moves, as it hits really hard when boosted by Adaptability. Mega Lucario also doesn't mind the defense drops that much because its defenses are bad to begin with.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Clefable or Togekiss can redirect super effective Fighting-type moves as well as status conditions. Both Clefable and Togekiss can offer speed control, which also benefits Mega Lucario. Also, Clefable and Cresselia have access to Helping Hand, which further increases Mega Lucario's damage output and lets it pick up KOs against Pokemon that it wouldn't normally get, such as against Sylveon. Pokemon that can check Aegislash and Talonflame generally are good partners for Lucario. Rotom-H is a nice partner, as it is able to support Mega Lucario with Will-O-Wisp as well as threaten out Talonflame and Aegislash while Mega Lucario can check Rock-types that threaten Rotom-H. Another great partner for Lucario is Landorus-T, as it provides Intimidate support, which can bolster Mega Lucario's poor Defense a bit. It can also check Talonflame with Rock Slide and Aegislash with Earthquake, although Mega Lucario has to use Detect on that turn. Mega Lucario, in return, checks Ice-types that threaten Landorus-T. Finally, Sylveon is another great partner for Mega Lucario. Although they are both walled by Aegislash, they can wreak havoc against other Pokemon and put a lot of pressure on the opponent with Sylveon's powerful Hyper Voice combined with Mega Lucario's Adaptability-boosted STAB moves. Sylveon can also check Fighting-types, while Mega Lucario checks Steel-types not named Aegislash.</p>"

Abomasnow has access to a very strong and spammable move, Blizzard. Its low Speed and good all-around bulk allows it to perform very well under Trick Room; however, it is difficult to use Abomasnow outside of Trick Room due to its low Speed and weakness to many common types. Abomasnow is also easily walled by common Pokemon such as Heatran and Aegislash.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Blast is an option over Ice Shard to hit Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn super effectively, while Earthquake is a more reliable option to hit Heatran and Aegislash. Energy Ball is an option over Giga Drain should you want a stronger Grass-type STAB move. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Scizor and Aegislash, though it would not do as much to Aegislash. If using Mega Abomasnow, Soundproof is a nice ability for Abomasnow, allowing it to switch into Sylveon's Hyper Voice for free.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Abomasnow is easily walled by common Steel-types, most notably Aegislash. Mega Mawile and Scizor are also big counters, as they can generally switch into Abomasnow's STAB moves with ease and force it out with an Iron Head and Bullet Punch/Bug Bite, respectively. Mega Mawile also functions well under Trick Room, while Scizor can set up a Swords Dance. Heatran is a big check because it can force Abomasnow out with a Heat Wave. Abomasnow also has to rely on Focus Blast, which has pretty mediocre accuracy, to hit Heatran hard.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Common Fire-types such as Heatran and Rotom-H wall both of Abomasnow's STAB moves. Rotom-H is a big counter because Abomasnow doesn't have a reliable way of hitting it. Mega Charizard Y is a big check because the sun negates Blizzard's 100% accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Although not a foolproof way of countering Abomasnow, Wide Guard shuts down Abomasnow's Blizzard, which will cripple it immensely.</p> <p><strong>Typing Advantage</strong>: Abomasnow has many weaknesses. Many Pokemon that carry these moves are very common such as Aegislash, Terrakion, and Heatran. Most of them can easily force out Abomasnow or OHKO it.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Blizzard is Abomasnow's strongest STAB attack and is its most spammed move. Giga Drain is Abomasnow's Grass-type STAB move that provides coverage against Water-types and also provides longevity. Wood Hammer is a great choice against more specially defensive Pokemon, such as Sylveon, which can tank a Blizzard nicely. It isn't recommended, however, to use it with Focus Sash because that will be counterproductive due to recoil damage. Ice Shard lets Abomasnow pick off weakened Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, outside of Trick Room. Protect is to scout and save Abomasnow from attacks such as Brave Bird from Talonflame, which will then allow Abomasnow's partner to KO or weaken the Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs with a Quiet nature and 0 IVs in Speed are for maximum damage output and because Abomasnow should have the lowest Speed possible for Trick Room. Maximum HP EVs give Abomasnow some bulk because investing in Speed wouldn't be necessary. Focus Sash is the preferred item for Abomasnow, as it frees up your Trick Room team to use a different Mega Evolution such as Mega Camerupt or Mega Mawile. Abomasite is an option so that Abomasnow can Mega Evolve and gain boosted offenses and defenses. Life Orb boosts Abomasnow's attacks without the use of Abomasite. If Abomasnow is running Wood Hammer, switch its item to Life Orb and change its EV spread to 252 HP / 52 Atk / 204 SpA so that Abomasnow will always OHKO 252 HP / 44 Def Rotom-W with Wood Hammer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Most of the time, Abomasnow should be spamming Blizzard. Giga Drain or Wood Hammer should be used when there is a Water-type out. Due to Abomasnow's many weaknesses, it isn't recommended to switch it in unless it's into an Electric- or Water-type attack. Generally, Abomasnow can take Electric- and Water-type attacks very well, which allows it to switch in against Pokemon such as Thundurus and Suicune very easily. Leading with a Trick Room setter alongside Abomasnow works well, as you'll be able to abuse Abomasnow's slow Speed right from the start without having to find an opportunity to switch it in safely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pairing Abomasnow with a partner that has access to Helping Hand and Trick Room, such as Cresselia, will benefit Abomasnow a lot, as Cresselia will be able to boost the power of Blizzard. Cresselia is also able to get rid of Fighting-types that threaten Abomasnow. Other Trick Room setters that pair up well with Abomasnow are Gothitelle, which can check Fighting-types and provide Helping Hand support, and Jellicent, which checks Fire-types and Aegislash. Heatran is another great partner, as its Flash Fire ability will discourage the use of Heat Wave and it can also check Steel- and Rock-types that threaten Abomasnow. Heatran is benefited by Abomasnow because it checks bulky Water-types, such as Rotom-W, which usually give Heatran trouble. Terrakion, although a bit fast for Trick Room, helps Abomasnow out by checking Steel- and Flying-types. Abomasnow, in turn, can get rid of Landorus-T, which gives Terrakion problems. Other Pokemon that can make use of Blizzard, such as Gastrodon, Swampert, and Milotic, are great partners. Gastrodon is benefited by Abomasnow's removal of Grass-types, while Gastrodon helps by checking Fire-types that threaten Abomasnow. Swampert is essentially the same as Gastrodon, but because it has access to Wide Guard, it can protect Abomasnow from Heat Wave or Rock Slide. If you're using Abomasnow outside of Trick Room, Greninja is a really niche option for a teammate, as it synergizes really well with Abomasnow. Greninja checks Aegislash and Fire-types, while the hail and Blizzard can make it a pretty decent hail attacker. Abomasnow also gets rid of bulky Water-types that Greninja generally has trouble breaking through.</p>"

Weavile can use its great coverage to deal with Pokemon that its teammates struggle with, notably being able to OHKO the most prevalent Intimidate Pokemon, Landorus-T, even at -1 with its STAB Ice-type moves. Weavile has good coverage to deal with some Steel-types, which would give it trouble otherwise. Weavile is good at preventing Trick Room from being set up, thanks to Fake Out and Knock Off hitting most setters super effectively. However, Weavile is an extremely frail Pokemon that relies on its Focus Sash, and its dreadful defensive typing doesn't help its poor bulk at all and gives it many weaknesses to common attacking types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb is a good item option, as it boosts Weavile's damage output considerably, but losing Focus Sash is not good for Weavile because it limits its longevity. Ice Shard can be used if you want some priority, but it's very weak and fails to OHKO Landorus-T, unlike Icicle Crash. Beat Up can be used with Terrakion; this is a hard strategy to pull off but can be powerful when pulled off correctly. However, Whimsicott's Beat Up deals less damage to Terrakion, and Whimsicott also has support options for Terrakion that Weavile doesn't, such as Tailwind.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate: Landorus-T is not a problem, but other Pokemon with Intimidate can tank Weavile's attacks and make it almost useless. Arcanine, Hitmontop, and Scrafty can all take Weavile's attacks easily and threaten it with super effective moves.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Weavile is 4x weak to Fighting, so most Fighting-types have an easy time with Weavile. Breloom and Conkeldurr have Mach Punch to bypass Weavile's high Speed. Scrafty has Intimidate to weaken Weavile and easily take its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Most Fairy-types can take Weavile's attacks and hit back with strong super effective moves. Clefable can redirect and tank Weavile's Knock Offs. Mawile is a hard stop to anything Weavile wants to do and even has Intimidate before Mega Evolving. Sylveon not only threatens Weavile itself, but with Pixilate Hyper Voice, it can deal a lot of damage to Weavile's partner as well.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Low Kick is not enough to deal with every Steel-type. There are many that take neutral damage from Fighting and give Weavile a lot of trouble. Mega Mawile takes anything Weavile can do and threatens it with powerful attacks. Scizor, as well as Mega Scizor, against which Knock Off doesn't receive the power boost, can attack Weavile with a priority Bullet Punch. Mega Metagross can take a Knock Off and bring Weavile to its Focus Sash or just take it out. If Weavile isn't running Low Kick, Bisharp and Heatran also become big issues, both threatening Weavile with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: Weavile relies on its great Speed to do well. Once speed control comes into play, Weavile is easy to pick off when it's getting outsped. Suicune is bulky enough to take Weavile's attacks and set up Tailwind. Trick Room gives Weavile a lot of trouble once it's active, but Weavile threatens most Trick Room setters. However, there are some setters, such as Aromatisse, which aren't afraid of Weavile. Thunder Wave is very troublesome for Weavile; even though the most common user, Thundurus, can be KOed with Icicle Crash, it has Prankster to get off a Thunder Wave before Weavile attacks. Other Pokemon with Thunder Wave, such as Clefable, can tank Weavile's attacks and paralyze it.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Weavile is a great user of Fake Out because it outspeeds many other Pokemon with Fake Out or Quick Guard. Fake Out is very useful for giving allies a free turn. Knock Off is Weavile's go-to move; it does good damage and is useful for getting rid of a Pokemon's item. Icicle Crash hits many Pokemon super effectively and deals with big threats such as Landorus-T and Mega Salamence. Low Kick is Weavile's best option for coverage and deals with Steel-types that would normally give it trouble, such as Bisharp and Heatran. Protect can be used over Low Kick for the good utility it provides.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A simple spread of maximum Attack and Speed is used to allow Weavile to hit as hard and as quickly as possible. Focus Sash is used because Weavile is frail and normally would be OHKOed by many strong Pokemon in Battle Spot Doubles. Pressure is not a very useful ability, but it provides some utility over Pickpocket by whittling down select moves' PP; this is especially useful against moves with only 5-8 PP, such as Close Combat. Pickpocket is also generally bad because Weavile can potentially take a bad item with it, such as a Choice item.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Weavile is used well as a lead, immediately providing Fake Out support. After using Fake Out, Weavile should be dealing as much damage as possible throughout the match. Weavile can use its good STAB coverage to knock out or weaken Pokemon that its teammates have trouble with. Knock Off should be used to cripple Pokemon that like their item, such as Choice Scarf and Sitrus Berry users. Don't be afraid to switch out Weavile when it's in a bad position, as its Fake Out support can be useful again later on in a match as well.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Weavile is a good teammate for Fighting-types because it can deal with Ghost- and Psychic-types for them. Sylveon is a good teammate because it can get a free turn to use Hyper Voice with Fake Out support, while Weavile has Low Kick to deal with Steel-types that threaten Sylveon. Mega Charizard Y appreciates Weavile's ability to deal with Landorus-T so that it won't have to fear the fast Rock Slide coming its way. Mega Charizard Y also appreciates Weavile's Fake Out support so it can get free turns to use Heat Wave. Strong physical attackers, such as Kangaskhan, Terrakion, and Talonflame, also appreciate Weavile's ability to get rid of Landorus-T easily.</p>"

  "Rhyperior": {
    "overview": "<p>With its ability to deal with many of the metagame's common threats, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Landorus-T, and Thundurus, as well as its high Attack and low Speed, Rhyperior is an excellent option for many Trick Room teams. Its high Defense also takes advantage of its access to Solid Rock, allowing Rhyperior to function outside of its preferred field condition on semi-Trick Room teams. With that said, however, it faces too much competition as both a Rock- and a Ground-type to be viable on teams without a Trick Room setter. Its pair of 4x weaknesses and low Special Defense can also often give it polarizing team matchups, as it will either carry a team or be a dead weight destined for the bench.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Megahorn hits Psychic and Grass-types hard, notably 2HKOing Cresselia and OHKOing Ludicolo. Rock Blast and Stone Edge are alternatives to Rock Slide that deal more damage to single targets and aren't blocked by Wide Guard. Superpower improves Rhyperior's chance of OHKOing Mega Kangaskhan but lowers both of Rhyperior's best stats. Lightning Rod is a good ability, but Rhydon outclasses Rhyperior as a Lightning Rod user because of its superior bulk with Eviolite. Assault Vest patches up Rhyperior's Special Defense, allowing it to survive attacks such as bulky Rotom-W's Hydro Pump. Lum Berry prevents burns from neutering Rhyperior's offense.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types can hit Rhyperior with their super effective STAB moves. Rotom-W is notable due to Levitate granting it an immunity to Ground-type attacks. Physically defensive Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune take Rhyperior's hits well and can KO it back with Scald or Hydro Pump. Jellicent has the option of crippling Rhyperior with Will-O-Wisp or KOing it with its Water-type STAB moves. Politoed's rain-boosted STAB attacks easily KO Rhyperior as well.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types, although most are weak to Ice Punch, deal super effective damage to Rhyperior with their STAB moves, and most of them also resist Earthquake. Ludicolo can OHKO Rhyperior with both Scald and Giga Drain. Breloom and Virizion resist both Rock Slide and Earthquake. Even the more supportive Amoonguss and Whimsicott can 2HKO Rhyperior with Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Special attackers target Rhyperior's much weaker Special Defense stat. Hydreigon can OHKO Rhyperior with a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor. Mega Camerupt outspeeds Rhyperior under Trick Room and OHKOes it with Earth Power. Cresselia deals more damage to Rhyperior with Psychic than it takes from Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: As a physical attacker, Rhyperior doesn't appreciate having to handle Pokemon with Intimidate or Will-O-Wisp, as they reduce Rhyperior's damage output and impair its sweeping potential.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Wide Guard blocks Rock Slide and Earthquake, shutting down Rhyperior's sweep. Swampert is a great user of the move, as it resists Rock Slide and deals super effective damage to Rhyperior with both its STAB moves. Hitmontop and Conkeldurr also resist Rock Slide and have access to Wide Guard, while Hitmontop's Intimidate lowers Rhyperior's Attack as well.</p>",

        "name": "Bulky Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Slide combines great spread damage with a high chance to make the foe flinch. Earthquake pairs well with Rock Slide due to its complementary coverage alongside it. Drill Run is an option either in place of or alongside Earthquake, as it deals more damage to a single target, isn't blocked by Wide Guard, and doesn't require Rhyperior's teammate to be immune to Ground or use Protect. Ice Punch deals heavy damage to common metagame threats such as Landorus-T and Mega Salamence. Hammer Arm OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan after Rhyperior's Weakness Policy has been activated and further lowers Rhyperior's Speed, making it faster under Trick Room. Protect shields Rhyperior against its foes' attacks for a turn, allowing a teammate to deal with threats to Rhyperior more safely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs allow Rhyperior to survive two Earthquakes from Adamant Landorus-T, and the given Special Defense EVs let it survive one Scald from 76 Special Attack Suicune not factoring in potential burn damage. A Brave nature with the remaining EVs invested into Attack increases Rhyperior's Attack stat as much as possible. 0 Speed IVs are used to make Rhyperior as quick as possible under Trick Room. Using an Adamant nature, 31 Speed IVs, and 4 Speed EVs is an option for semi-Trick Room teams to make Rhyperior outspeed minimum Speed Aegislash. Weakness Policy takes advantage of Solid Rock, which reduces the damage of super effective hits, by doubling Rhyperior's Attack when it gets hit by one, allowing it to sweep more easily. Life Orb is an alternative that grants more immediate damage and makes Rhyperior less reliant on its item activating. When using Life Orb, an EV spread of 68 HP / 252 Atk / 188 SpD should be used to minimize Life Orb recoil.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rhyperior's aim is to deal as much spread damage as possible with the combination of Rock Slide and Earthquake. Try to bring Rhyperior onto the field in the mid-game when Trick Room has already been set up and the opponent's lead Pokemon have already activated their potential Intimidate. Avoid taking excessive neutral damage, as Rhyperior will want to stay as healthy as possible to survive the super effective hits that activate Weakness Policy. Don't take chances when potential Wide Guard users are on the opponent's side of the field; either use Drill Run if running it or switch out to maintain the momentum that's important to take advantage of during Trick Room's limited turns. Finally, it's possible to bluff Lightning Rod by pairing Rhyperior with a partner weak to Electric to get the best of both abilities when the foes avoid using Electric-type attacks to prevent wasting turns.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>A Trick Room setter is mandatory to take advantage of Rhyperior's low Speed. Cresselia is a notable user, as its access to Levitate allows Rhyperior to use Earthquake freely alongside it. Fake Out users can help Rhyperior's teammate set up Trick Room as well. Scrafty is good option, as its access to Intimidate further capitalizes on Rhyperior's excellent physical bulk. Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran beat the Grass-types that Rhyperior struggles against, and in return, Rhyperior handles the Pokemon that threaten them, such as Landorus-T and, in Mega Charizard Y's case, Electric-types. Mega Charizard Y's Drought also weakens the Water-type attacks that Rhyperior is weak to. Grass-types such as Venusaur and Abomasnow beat Water-types directly with their super effective STAB moves, and Rhyperior can beat Talonflame for them in return. Electric-types, particularly Thundurus, can also beat Water-types. Thundurus can also use Taunt to shut down opposing Wide Guard users. Crobat is another fast Taunt user and can beat Grass-types for Rhyperior. Sylveon makes for a great pivot for Rhyperior, as it's able to take the special attacks aimed at it thanks to its high Special Defense and can threaten more physically defensive foes, while Rhyperior can take physical attacks aimed at Sylveon and beat more specially defensive foes in return.</p>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Togekiss has access to the rare and extremely useful Follow Me, which combined with its good bulk and well-rounded stats allows it to perform its role as a redirection support Pokemon really well. However, its Fairy / Flying typing is pretty mediocre, as it is weak to the ever-so-common Rock Slide as well as Thunderbolt, Iron Head, and Flash Cannon. It isn't terrible though, considering it has a Dragon immunity as well as resisting Fighting-type attacks, but Togekiss faces competition with Amoonguss, even after the Rage Powder nerf, and Clefable, which doesn't have weaknesses to Rock or Electric.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set with Dazzling Gleam, Air Slash, Fire Blast, and Aura Sphere can be used. Togekiss also has a myriad of support moves to choose from such as Reflect, Light Screen, and Safeguard. Lum Berry, Wacan Berry, and Babiri Berry are alternate item choices; the former can protect Togekiss from status while the latter two can mitigate Togekiss's weaknesses. Mental Herb is another choice if you're afraid of Taunt. Other alternate item choices are Safety Goggles and Leftovers, which can be used if item clause limits Togekiss from using Sitrus Berry or Rocky Helmet. Another option is a Choice Scarf set that capitalizes on Air Slash's flinch chance, but it isn't that great due to Togekiss's lack of a strong Fairy-type STAB move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types generally cause a lot of problems for Togekiss, as they are able to do massive damage to it. Mega Metagross, Mega Mawile, and Bisharp can take a chunk out of Togekiss's HP because its Defense stat is lower than its Special Defense. Mega Mawile is also able to outspeed Togekiss under Trick Room while Mega Metagross and Bisharp can outrun Togekiss without speed control. Heatran and Aegislash are both problems as well, as both of them can easily set up a Substitute if they're running it. They can also tank both of Togekiss's STAB moves really easily.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types are able to hit Togekiss for super effective damage, which can allow them to easily whittle it down. Rotom-W, Rotom-H, Zapdos, and Thundurus can take a chunk out of Togekiss's HP even with minimal investment; Thundurus can also Taunt Togekiss. Additionally, they're immune to Thunder Wave and resist what is arguably Togekiss's best STAB move—Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide: STAB Rock Slide from Pokemon such as Terrakion and Tyranitar hurts, though Togekiss can tank some of the weaker Rock Slides.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Taunt completely shuts Togekiss down, making it rely on its weak STAB moves. Pokemon such as Thundurus, Gengar, and Aerodactyl are huge problems for Togekiss. Thundurus can hit Togekiss for super effective damage with Thunderbolt, while Gengar can do the same with Sludge Bomb. Aerodactyl has access to Rock Slide and Sky Drop, which nullify Follow Me.</p>",

        "name": "Follow Me Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Follow Me is the main support move that you will be using the most often on Togekiss. Togekiss frequently runs only one attacking move, which is usually going to be either Air Slash or Dazzling Gleam. Air Slash, combined with Serene Grace, is great for netting flinches, while Dazzling Gleam is great for spread damage and inflicts more chip damage than Air Slash. Togekiss has two great options for speed control: Tailwind and Thunder Wave. Tailwind is a good option because it gives a blanket boost to your team as well as allowing your team to possibly outspeed Ground-types such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, while Thunder Wave is a more permanent form of speed control because it doesn't end, unlike Tailwind. Roost is for longevity and instant recovery and is a nice option over speed control if you are using Togekiss on a Trick Room team. Protect is here as it can provide protection for a turn should your opponent choose to double target Togekiss.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The HP and Defense EVs allow Togekiss to survive an Iron Head from Life Orb Bisharp and Jolly Mega Metagross. With Sitrus Berry, it is also only 4HKOed by Rock Slide from Landorus-T. The Speed EVs allow Togekiss to outrun Rotom-W outside of Tailwind and Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T under Tailwind. A Relaxed or Bold nature with 0 Speed EVs for Trick Room works. A Calm nature can be use to sponge special attacks. If you're running Air Slash, Serene Grace is the best ability, while Dazzling Gleam is best paired with Super Luck.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Togekiss should spam Follow Me until its partner no longer needs redirection support or Togekiss faints. If your opponent has a Pokemon that uses spread moves, such as Mega Charizard Y or Tyranitar, it is better to just use an attacking move or status them if you choose to run Thunder Wave. Togekiss is pretty predictable, as it mainly spams Follow Me, so it is likely that your opponent will double target Togekiss in anticipation of this. In that case, it is a good idea to use Protect.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that benefit from speed control and redirection support, especially those that are weak to Fighting- or Dragon-types, such as Mega Kangaskhan, are great partners for Togekiss. Pokemon that spam Earthquake, such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Landorus-T, are great partners too. Examples of Pokemon benefiting from redirection support are Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia and Jellicent, and frail Pokemon such as Breloom. Setup attackers, in general, are great partners too. Examples are Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Salamence; the latter is a great partner due to Togekiss's immunities to Dragon and Ground, which allows Salamence to use Earthquake freely.</p>"

Mamoswine, however, is heavily walled by the two most common Rotom formes, Rotom-W and Rotom-H. Ice and Ground is also a pretty terrible defensive typing which allows a lot of common Pokemon in the metagame to check Mamoswine, such as Terrakion, Rotom-W, and Mega Metagross. Being very susceptible to Intimidate and burn doesn't help Mamoswine's case either. On the other hand, Mamoswine is very anti-meta because it checks a lot of common Pokemon, such as Heatran, Aegislash, Garchomp, Thundurus, and Landorus-T.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On the Offensive set, Stone Edge and Rock Slide are both options to hit Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y. Superpower is also an option, as it allows Mamoswine to hit Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn harder. If Mamoswine is running Focus Sash, Endeavor is an option too. Choice Band works should you choose to increase Mamoswine's damage output further while Lum Berry is another alternate item choice to alleviate Mamoswine's weakness to burns. Like the Focus Sash, the drop in power is very noticeable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rotom Formes: Mamoswine is heavily walled by both Rotom-W and Rotom-H, as they resist both of its STAB moves and can threaten it with either Hydro Pump and Overheat, respectively, or burn it.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: As Mamoswine is strictly a physical attacker, Intimidate shuffling or burning it will severely cripple it and lower its damage output.</p> <p><strong>Typing Advantage</strong>: While Mamoswine's bulk isn't bad, it isn't very good either, so a strong super effective move will more than likely OHKO it. Terrakion's Close Combat and Mega Metagross's Iron Head are among some of those moves.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Mamoswine's Ground-type STAB move and hits Fire- and Steel-types super effectively. Icicle Spear, while sometimes luck-reliant, allows Mamoswine to break Focus Sashes, while Icicle Crash is a more reliable Ice-type STAB move, as it always has a set power. Ice Shard is a priority move that allows Mamoswine to somewhat mitigate its only decent Speed and pick off weakened Dragon-types as well as Landorus-T. Protect guards Mamoswine from a potential OHKO or burn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature are used to ensure maximum damage output. Maximum Speed EVs allow Mamoswine to outrun Adamant Bisharp. Life Orb is generally the preferred item, as Mamoswine doesn't really mind the recoil too much and would much rather have boosted power. Focus Sash is an option so that Mamoswine can survive a hit, such as an Iron Head from Mega Metagross, and potentially OHKO the opposing Pokemon back. The drop in power, however, is very noticeable. Thick Fat is by far the best ability, as it weakens Ice- and Fire-type moves, which helps increase Mamoswine's ability to tank hits.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mamoswine has a very poor defensive typing, so it isn't recommended to switch it into moves unless the move is a weaker, non-super effective move. Mamoswine can generally switch in to weaker spread-reduced moves, such as Rock Slide. Mamoswine works great to pick off weakened Pokemon mid- and late-game. Mamoswine can also beat 4 HP Choice Scarf Landorus-T with Ice Shard if Mamoswine is given a chance to switch in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Togekiss is a great partner, as it provides redirection support and speed control, which can mitigate Mamoswine's decent, but not great, Speed. Togekiss is also immune to Ground-type moves which allows Mamoswine to use Earthquake freely. Thundurus is also a great partner, as it is immune to Earthquake, can shut down Will-O-Wisp with Taunt, can offer speed control, and can check bulky Water-types that Mamoswine has trouble breaking through. Mamoswine, in return, checks Rock-types that threaten Thundurus. Aegislash can check Cresselia, which Mamoswine also has trouble breaking through, as well as Terrakion and Mega Metagross. Aegislash can also use Wide Guard to prevent taking damage from Mamoswine's Earthquakes. Mamoswine can help check Ground- and Fire-types that threaten Aegislash, such as Landorus-T and Heatran. By far the best partner for Mamoswine is Mega Charizard Y. Mega Charizard Y has near perfect synergy with Mamoswine, as it resists all of Mamoswine's weaknesses, except for Water; however, Drought can help mitigate that weakness. Drought greatly benefits Mamoswine as it alleviates Mamoswine's weakness to Water. Mega Charizard Y's insanely powerful spread move combined with Mamoswine's power can put a lot of pressure on your opponent, as it doesn't give them many opportunities to switch in. Mamoswine checks Heatran, one of Mega Charizard Y's biggest counters, as well as Electric- and Rock-types that threaten Mega Charizard Y and Dragon-types that resist Mega Charizard Y's attacks.</p>"

Superpower lets Mamoswine hit Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Ferrothorn super effectively while Ice Shard lets Mamoswine pick off weakened Pokemon that are still faster than it, such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Rock Slide can allow Mamoswine to check Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame and provides a nice flinch chance. Alternatively, Stone Edge is a stronger option should you want a stronger Rock-type move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack EVs with an Adamant nature ensure the highest damage output with a Choice Scarf. Maximum Speed EVs are so that Mamoswine can function with a Choice Scarf. Choice Scarf alleviates Mamoswine's decent Speed and can allow it to outrun Pokemon that it normally cannot, including Mega Metagross and Terrakion.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mamoswine has mediocre bulk so it isn't recommended to switch it into attacks unless the move is a weaker non-super effective move or a weaker spread move such as Rock Slide. With a Choice Scarf, Mamoswine works sort of like a hit-and-run Pokemon, as its decent Speed boosted by a Choice Scarf can allow it to outrun and OHKO a lot of common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Terrakion.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is a great partner for Mamoswine, as it has near perfect synergy, resisting all of Mamoswine's weaknesses except for Water; however, Water-type attacks will have lowered power under Drought. Mega Charizard Y's powerful spread move combined with Mamoswine's power can put a lot of pressure on your opponents, as it doesn't give them many opportunities to switch in. Mamoswine checks Heatran, one of Mega Charizard Y's biggest counters, as well as Electric- and Rock-types that threaten Mega Charizard Y. Mamoswine also checks Dragon-types that resists Mega Charizard Y's attacks. Aegislash is also a great partner, as it can check Cresselia, which Mamoswine has trouble breaking through. With a Choice Scarf, Mamoswine can check both Metagross and Terrakion with Earthquake so Aegislash isn't pressured to check as much. Aegislash can use Wide Guard to prevent taking any damage from Mamoswine's Earthquakes. Mamoswine checks Ground- and Fire-types that threaten Aegislash, mainly Landorus-T and Heatran. Virizion pairs really well with Choice Scarf Mamoswine, as Virizion benefits greatly from Mamoswine's ability to remove Thundurus and Zapdos. Virizion helps Mamoswine by checking Rotom-W, a major Mamoswine counter, as well as Ferrothorn and Mega Kangaskhan, so that Mamoswine doesn't have to rely on Superpower to hit them. Speed control isn't needed much for Choice Scarf Mamoswine, but redirection is greatly appreciated. Amoonguss works well to redirect attacks aimed at Mamoswine as it resists three of the five types that Mamoswine is weak to. The other two types, Fire and Steel, can be checked through Mamoswine's Earthquake. Amoonguss can also provide sleep support which greatly benefits Mamoswine, allowing it to wreak havoc without worrying about one of your opponent's Pokemon.</p>"

It has decent versatility with EV spreads and can run both supportive sets and offensive sets pretty well, although the fact that its only Fire-type STAB move is Overheat does put something of a damper on things. Furthermore, while Rotom-H's EVs can vary quite a lot to fit your team, the actual moves that Rotom-H will be running are extremely predictable. It is also weak to the relatively common rain archetype and the ever-present Rock Slide, both of which limit its effectiveness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-H can run truly offensive Life Orb or Choice Specs sets, which are helped out by its powerful STAB coverage. However, Rotom-H still finds itself outsped by too much of the metagame to get off enough hits to make either set worth it the majority of the time. Hidden Power Grass is usable on teams that are particularly weak to opposing Swampert and Gastrodon, although even with Hidden Power Grass Rotom-H doesn't check them terribly well. Confuse Ray can be used over Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave as a support move. Notably, it has perfect accuracy and can affect all types unlike Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, but it also lacks the Attack- and Speed-decreasing capabilities of the other two status moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Redirection: While Amoonguss might not pose much of a threat to Rotom-H, Clefairy and Clefable can be quite terrifying for Rotom-H. Both of the Fairies can redirect Rotom-H's attacks, take minimal damage, and allow a partner to set up to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan: Rotom-H struggles to deal with the massive damage output of Mega Kangaskhan. Even if Rotom-H manages to burn it with Will-O-Wisp, Kangaskhan is still capable of returning its Attack to neutral with Power-Up Punch.</p> <p><strong>Rain: Although Rotom-H has Electric-type STAB moves to hit Politoed and other rain team staples with, it simply can't deal with rain-boosted Water-type STAB attacks. Ludicolo and Kingdra also outspeed Rotom-H in the rain thanks to Swift Swim.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide: Rotom-H has the bulk to take a Rock Slide or two, but it will take massive damage and almost all Rock Slide users are faster than Rotom-H, so it also has to worry about the flinch chance.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Overheat is a nuke that's amazing for KOing bulky Steel-types like Mega Mawile, Mega Metagross, and Aegislash, as well as the less bulky Bisharp. Thunderbolt acts as a consistent and still relatively powerful Electric-type STAB move, and Hidden Power Ice allows Rotom-H to OHKO 4 HP Mega Salamence and the standard Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Protect is a VGC staple, and it can do wonders for Rotom-H's staying power on the field when it's using an Expert Belt. On the other hand, Choice Scarf sets can opt for Volt Switch to gain momentum and escape Shadow Tag teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Speed EVs let Rotom-H outspeed Adamant Bisharp and some Heatran and Arcanine. With Expert Belt, the Special Attack EVs allow Rotom-H to net OHKOs on pretty much everything weak to its STAB moves; however, it can still struggle to deal damage to neutral targets. When using Choice Scarf, you sacrifice a decent chunk of power and thus some OHKOs; save Bisharp, you lose out on the KO against every notable Steel-type with Overheat. Hidden Power Ice still has a chance to OHKO uninvested Landorus-T, but Rotom-H will underspeed it unless running Timid, in which case it has no chance to KO. On the bright side, Rotom-H's Electric typing does prevent it from being paralyzed and losing the Choice Scarf Speed boost. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to generally maximize bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Offensive Rotom-H appreciates speed control so it can move before threats like Landorus-T and OHKO them, assuming it has Hidden Power Ice. Rotom-H also appreciates having good switching partners, as Overheat leaves it spent on the field and, with a fully offensive moveset, leaving it out will result in it being KOed or a severe loss of momentum. Remember, switch-ins will need to be bulky enough to take a hit to be effective. In terms of using Rotom-H itself, it is often a good Pokemon to conserve, as opponents will sometimes try to keep Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Aegislash alive on their side of the field as wincons; when facing either of those Pokemon be sure to keep your Rotom-H alive.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Ludicolo make for great partners, as they can beat both Rock- and Water-types, which threaten Rotom-H. Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp also make for good partners, as they can equally eliminate Rock-types. Furthermore, they are able to use Earthquake freely alongside Rotom-H as a result of its Levitate ability. Gastrodon, as both a Water- and Ground-type, is able to eliminate Rock-types with ease, and its Storm Drain ability can Protect Rotom-H from single-target Water-type moves. Swampert is another Water / Ground type, but has access to Wide Guard, which allows it to shield Rotom-H from Rock Slide. Other Water-types such as Gyarados and Azumarill equally do a great job at eliminating common users of Rock-type attacks such as Landorus-T and Tyranitar. Pokemon with low Defense stats such as Gardevoir and Sylveon enjoy Rotom-H's ability to burn foes and thereby reduce their Attack.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>While not as powerful as that of the offensive Rotom-H set, Overheat still deals massive super effective damage to targets even if it misses KOs from full HP. Thunderbolt is a reliable secondary STAB move, and Will-O-Wisp is pretty much mandatory to neuter the physical attackers of the metagame and prolong Rotom-H's lifespan. Protect can increase Rotom's longevity further, while Thunder Wave can allow it to support your team even more with speed control.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This Rotom-H can survive a Double-Edge from Jolly Kangaskhan without a Sitrus Berry and one from Adamant Kangaskhan with Sitrus Berry. It has a 15/16 chance to take a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Modest Hydreigon running maximum Special Attack, and Rock Slide from 252 Atk Adamant Landorus-T is always a 3HKO, not counting Sitrus Berry recovery. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack for slightly more Overheat damage, with the scraps thrown into Speed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Supportive Rotom-H should mainly be used to disrupt the opponent and burn switch-ins. It can chip foes with Thunderbolt, though the only KOs you should really be trying to get from it are on Pokemon weak to its STAB moves. It can make for a good switch-in, especially by making use of Levitate and its several resistances, but it suffers from lack of offensive power after firing off an Overheat. Even at -2 Special Attack, though, it can remain on the field and continue to spread status and support the team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Both Gastrodon and Swampert make for good partners for Rotom-H, as they provide complementary defensive and offensive synergy. Additionally, they can mitigate Rotom-H's weaknesses to Water-type moves and Rock Slide with Storm Drain and Wide Guard, respectively. Terrakion makes for a good partner for Rotom-H, as it can remove threats like Kangaskhan and opposing Terrakion while receiving support from Rotom-H, which can deal with Pokemon like Amoonguss that would threaten it otherwise. Landorus-T is another good partner, as it can Intimidate threats to Rotom-H and is able to use Earthquake freely next to the floating oven. Together they have good offensive and defensive synergy, aside from bulky Water-types, which destroy both.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W arguably has the best typing in the rule set, as Water / Electric, with a Ground-type immunity by virtue of Levitate, is incredible and lets it take minimal damage from threats such as Landorus-T and almost every Water-type around. It's no slouch offensively either; Water and Electric coverage, while limited, is good enough to deal with whatever its typing walls. It also has unique access to Will-O-Wisp for crippling physical attackers, making for a powerful Pokemon every team needs an answer to.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Specs sets hit hard and are a bit of a surprise. Traditionally, they've been used as a way to deal with rain teams, but Ludicolo is now almost always present on them, making that role questionable. If you're carrying your own rain inducers, Thunder is an option. Reflect can be used over Will-O-Wisp or even Protect if the accuracy and single target nature of Will-O-Wisp are a turnoff or if you find Protect unneeded. Volt Switch is nice for counteracting obvious switches. Hidden Power Ice damages Dragon-types that can't be touched otherwise. Hidden Power Grass grants coverage for Water-types that would wall Rotom-W otherwise, mainly Gastrodon. Thunder Wave and Electroweb provide Speed control, though Rotom-W is not a terribly good Speed control user compared to Thundurus or Cresselia.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss and Ludicolo wall Rotom-W. Amoonguss redirects everything Rotom-W wants to do. Both take laughable damage from Rotom-W's attack and will eventually take it down with Giga Drain. Ferrothorn hates burns, but most carry a Lum Berry and can smack Rotom-W with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Unless Rotom-W carries Hidden Power Ice, which only deals negligible damage, most specially oriented Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Latios can beat Rotom-W.</p> <p><strong>Strong Neutral STAB Attacks: The strongest special attacks around, such as Sylveon's Hyper Voice and Thundurus-I's Thunderbolt, can muscle through Rotom-W after a few hits.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon: Though uncommon, Gastrodon is immune to both of Rotom-W's STAB moves, prevents Hydro Pump from affecting its partner with Storm Drain, and can eventually win versus Rotom-W one-on-one.</p>",

Protect prevents double targeting and allows Rotom-W to avoid taking damage for a turn while its teammate deals damage. It's worth mentioning that Rotom-W is one of the few Pokemon that can afford to skimp out on Protect thanks to its typing and bulk. If your team's Sitrus Berry is already in use, Chesto Berry with Rest can work as an alternative.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs allow Rotom-W to survive Mega Mawile's Play Rough, or two if it's been burned. The rest of the EVs are invested in Special Attack to give Rotom-W some solid offensive presence. However, most Rotom-W run more Speed EVs to Speed creep, so it's highly recommended you take some EVs out of Special Attack and put them into Speed. If you're interested in outspeeding certain threats, 132 Speed EVs let Rotom-W outspeed Adamant nature maximum Speed Bisharp so Rotom-W can burn Bisharp before it has the chance to attack. 188 Speed EVs will let Rotom-W outspeed every neutral-natured Heatran and Hydro Pump it before it can use Substitute. If you find Modest's extra Special Attack unneeded and would prefer to survive some big hits, 252 HP / 148 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to survive Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam. 252 HP / 164 SpD with a Calm nature will always survive Modest Specs Hydreigon's Draco Meteor. Sitrus Berry is important, as it gives Rotom-W more longevity. It also makes investing to live certain hits more valuable, as Rotom-W will survive the hit, then get boosted into a more comfortable health range.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Rotom-W is a fairly simple Pokemon to use: switch it into one of its many resistances and either start using Will-O-Wisp or attacking. If Rotom-W's up against something that can't touch it, such as a Landorus-T or most Water-types, they're likely not going to stay in. In this scenario, try to predict the switch and use Will-O-Wisp instead.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Just about everything appreciates Rotom-W's partnership. Rotom-W is great with Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Rotom-W also pairs well with anything that likes a Flying-, Ground-, or Fire-type switch-in such as Amoonguss, Metagross, and Mega Mawile. Pokemon that dislike bulky Water-types, such as Landorus-T and Talonflame, enjoy Rotom-W being able to Thunderbolt them away.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill's good base Attack combined with access to two stellar offensive abilities, Sand Rush and Mold Breaker, allow Excadrill to stand out among the many other viable Steel-types. Sand Rush doubles Excadrill's otherwise mediocre Speed when sand is active, whereas Mold Breaker allows Excadrill to attack through abilities when that would normally be impossible, importantly Levitate on the Rotom formes and Cresselia. While limited, Excadrill's movepool contains some very important moves; Iron Head for instance allows Excadrill to OHKO Sylveon and other Fairy-types that are common in the format. Earthquake when combined with Rock Slide gives Excadrill perfect neutral coverage; this guarantees that Excadrill will always be able to deal damage rather than become dead weight. With a great typing, Excadrill is gifted eight resistances and two immunities, which let it check common Pokemon such as Thundurus and Sylveon.</p> <p>Excadrill has relatively poor bulk, taking roughly 40% from a spread Hyper Voice from Choice Specs Sylveon, which greatly limits Excadrill's opportunities to switch in. While having what it needs, Excadrill's shallow movepool makes it highly predictable, and this makes playing against Excadrill far easier than other Steel-types. The factor that holds Excadrill back the most is its middling Speed. Without Sand Rush, Excadrill finds itself being outsped by many relevant Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Landorus-T. Excadrill's Speed issues are compounded by being too fast to reliably be used on a Trick Room team. Excadrill suffers further by being weak to the common offensive types Fire, Fighting, and Ground. Excadrill also does not appreciate being burned by Will-O-Wisp.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mold Breaker Excadrill can make use of either Choice Band or Choice Scarf. Choice Band hits a lot harder than Life Orb, however, the loss of the ability to switch moves hurts Excadrill a lot. Choice Scarf aims to solve Excadrill's Speed issues, but suffers the same issues as Choice Band. To maintain its usefulness Choice Excadrill must switch out, which is not easy in Battle Spot Doubles. Drill Run is a single target Ground-type move, which can be useful if you are concerned about Earthquake hitting Excadrill's partner Pokemon. However, Drill Run is less accurate than Earthquake. Lum Berry cures burn, but Excadrill is more concerned with staying alive or dealing damage. Swagger + Lum Berry can boost Excadrill's Attack two stages for free. Rock Tomb could be used over Rock Slide as a form of speed control, but it is very weak and the Speed drop can be reset by switching out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T has Earthquake, which can OHKO Excadrill, is immune to Excadrill's Earthquakes, and has Intimidate to cripple Excadrill. Garchomp can outspeed Excadrill, take any hit, and OHKO with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Gyarados has Intimidate, resists Excadrill's STAB types, and can comfortably set up Dragon Dances on it. Ludicolo resists Excadrill's STAB move and can OHKO it with Hydro Pump. Milotic can take any hit and OHKO Excadrill back. Rotom-W beats the Sand Rush set 100% of the time, but must be wary of Mold Breaker.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Hitmontop and Scrafty have Intimidate and can OHKO Excadrill with their Fighting-types STAB moves. Conkeldurr and Hariyama are bulky enough take any hit from Excadrill and OHKO back. Breloom has a good chance OHKO Excadrill with Mach Punch and is guaranteed to OHKO after Excadrill takes one turn of Life Orb damage.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Both the Sand Rush and Mold Breaker sets have bad match ups against sun and rain. Mega Charizard Y can OHKO Excadrill with Heat Wave, but must be wary of Rock Slide. In rain, Politoed can OHKO Excadrill, Ludicolo resists STAB types and can OHKO, and Mega Swampert has Wide Guard and can OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Excadrill is a physical attacker, so can be greatly weakened by Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard</strong>: Wide Guard blocks two of Excadrill's main attacks: Earthquake and Rock Slide.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is a spread move and will OHKO most Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-types. This can be useful for clearing the way for sweepers such as Mega Salamence. With Mold Breaker, Excadrill is able to hit Pokemon with the ability Levitate with STAB Earthquake, importantly the Rotom formes and Cresselia. Rock Slide is another spread move which rounds out Excadrill's coverage, hitting the Flying-types which are immune Earthquake for super effective damage. Rock Slide also has a decent chance to cause at least one of the opposing Pokemon to flinch, which, while unreliable, can be beneficial. Iron Head OHKOes Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Gardevoir, and Mega Altaria. Because Iron Head is a single target move, it bypasses Wide Guard to hit Rock-types more reliably than Earthquake. Swords Dance boosts Excadrill's Attack by two stages, giving it a chance to sweep. Swords Dance can be used over Iron Head, as at +2 Excadrill can OHKO Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir. Protect not only is useful to prevent Excadrill from fainting while its partner takes down a threat but also can be used to stall out turns of opposing Trick Room, Tailwind, and weather.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>With Mold Breaker, Excadrill use Earthquake to hit Pokemon with the ability Levitate. A 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread can be used on Excadrill, as it needs to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature will allow it to OHKO bulkier Rotom-W with Earthquake, whereas a Jolly nature will let it outspeed maximum Speed Rotom formes. A Focus Sash guarantees that Excadrill will survive one attack, which means that Excadrill is almost always able to use at least one attack before fainting.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to its relatively poor bulk, Excadrill has a hard time switching into attacks. Because of this Excadrill should either be led with or brought in after something has been KOed. If leading with Excadrill, it should be brought alongside the Pokemon that either support it or it supports, such as Togekiss and Mega Salamence respectively. If not leading with Excadrill, it should be kept in the back until Pokemon that are faster and can OHKO it have been taken down, such as Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Togekiss is immune to Earthquake and can provide both Follow Me and Tailwind support. Follow Me allows Excadrill to set up Swords Dance more easily, whereas Tailwind fixes Excadrill's Speed issues. Mega Salamence appreciates Excadrill's ability to take on the Rotom formes and Steel-types with Earthquake. This lets Mega Salamence set up Dragon Dances more easily, as many of its counters are no longer issues. Thundurus can spread Thunder Waves to help with Excadrill's Speed problems, and can check Landorus-T by OHKOing it with Hidden Power Ice. Excadrill can OHKO Tyranitar and the Rotom formes, which allows Talonflame to use Brave Bird more freely. Talonflame also can provide Tailwind support for Excadrill. Because it is part Grass-type, Ludicolo is capable of taking Excadrill's Earthquakes; Ludicolo also helps Excadrill deal with many common Water-types.</p>"

Rock Slide has good coverage alongside Earthquake. Rock Slide can OHKO Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame, both of which Excadrill outspeeds in sand. Iron Head OHKOes Fairy-types and is a reasonably powerful secondary STAB move. Protect lets Excadrill's partner take out a Pokemon that threatens Excadrill. Swords Dance could be used, but wastes a turn of sand; Excadrill is normally better off just attacking.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sand Rush doubles Excadrill's Speed in sand. Because of this, there is no benefit to running a Jolly nature, as Excadrill reaches 280 Speed with an Adamant Nature. 280 Speed is faster than all relevant threats under normal conditions. Life Orb boosts the power of Excadrill's attacks by 1.3. Focus Sash ensures Excadrill survives one hit, potentially letting Excadrill use two attacks before fainting.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Excadrill should be lead with either Tyranitar or Hippowdon, as this lets Excadrill's Speed be doubled on turn one. If Excadrill isn't being lead with, be careful as you switch it in, as Excadrill has relatively poor bulk. Because of Excadrill's high Speed in sand it can easily clean up against weakened teams. When playing against other weather teams it is best to keep Excadrill in the back, as it is likely that the opposing team will lead with their weather inducer to counter sand.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Either Tyranitar or the more niche Hippowdon are required to set up sand for Sand Rush Excadrill to be worth using. Tyranitar can make use of an Air Balloon to give it a pseudo-immunity to Earthquake. Hippowdon should be EVed to take on common physical attackers, and Ice Fang might be worth using on it in order to take on Landorus-T and Thundurus. Rotom-W is immune to Earthquake and is able to take on both opposing Water-types and physical attackers by burning them. Rotom-W is also able to take on Landorus-T with Hydro Pump. Cresselia is immune to Earthquake, can take on Fighting-types, shut down Trick Room teams, and provide Helping Hand support for Excadrill. Thundurus can OHKO opposing Ground-types with Hidden Power Ice and spread Thunder Waves and Taunts. Thundurus threatens Flying- and Water-types, which trouble Excadrill with its STAB Thunderbolt. Talonflame can OHKO Grass-types which resist Earthquake, and provide useful Taunt and Tailwind support.</p>"

Conkeldurr also has access to the elemental punches and Knock Off. However, Conkeldurr is vulnerable to Intimidate, which is very common in Battle Spot Doubles.

Sheer Force can be used to boost the power of Conkeldurr's attacks that have a secondary effect. Life Orb can be used alongside this, or by itself, too. Choice Band boosts Conkeldurr's Attack stat by 50%, letting it hit harder. Sitrus Berry helps Conkeldurr take more hits, and Safety Goggles prevents Conkeldurr's attacks from being redirected by Follow Me and Rage Powder, and also protects Conkeldurr from Spore and Sleep Powder. A Flame Orb alongside Guts gives Conkeldurr a 50% boost to its Attack, but wears Conkeldurr down. Persim Berry alongside Guts lets Conkeldurr safely handle Swagger users while still boosting its Attack when it gets burned, poisoned, or paralyzed. The same goes for Lum Berry; however, it should only be used with Iron Fist or Sheer Force.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Typing Advantage: Flying-types, such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame, threaten Conkeldurr with their powerful Flying-type STAB attacks.

Ice Punch hits Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, which take little damage from Conkeldurr's other attacks. Rock Slide, on the other hand, can be used to hit Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame for good damage. It also hits Mega Salamence, just not as hard as Ice Punch does.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Guts is the preferred ability because it lets Conkeldurr absorb status ailments such as Will-O-Wisp, which would otherwise render Conkeldurr useless. If your team has a solution to status, however, consider using Iron Fist to boost the power of Conkeldurr's punching attacks by 20%. Assault Vest boosts Conkeldurr's Special Defense by 50%, helping it comfortably take special attacks such as Cresselia's Psychic and Thundurus's Thunderbolt. The given EV spread lets Conkeldurr survive a sun-boosted Overheat from Modest Mega Charizard Y, a Double-Edge from Jolly Mega Kangaskhan, or a Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice from Sylveon. The remaining EVs are put into Attack, and an Adamant nature is used to let Conkeldurr hit as hard as possible. 14 Speed IVs should be used in order to underspeed Aegislash and OHKO its Blade forme with Knock Off. However, if Conkeldurr is used on a Trick Room team, then a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs are best to make Conkeldurr as slow as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Before sending in Conkeldurr, be sure to remove threats such as Mega Salamence and Talonflame, which apply lots to pressure on Conkeldurr due to their powerful STAB attacks. After removing them, Conkeldurr should use its natural bulk to take hits and dish out damage with its attacks. Conkeldurr should use Mach Punch to hit, or even KO, frail Pokemon such as Bisharp without letting them do anything.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bisharp effectively handles Intimidate and can threaten the bulky Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon that are immune to and resist Conkeldurr's STAB moves, respectively.

Trick Room support from Cresselia and Gothitelle can help Conkeldurr move first. Mega Mawile functions well in Trick Room, too, as it can switch into the Flying- and Fairy-type moves aimed at Conkeldurr, and Conkeldurr can absorb Will-O-Wisp if it has Guts.

  "Whimsicott": {
    "overview": "<p>Whimsicott is one of the most annoying Pokemon in Battle Spot Doubles thanks to its disruptive support movepool and Prankster. Between Taunt, Encore, and being the fastest Prankster user in the game, Whimsicott has the unique ability to shut down almost any Pokemon, from Aegislash to Thundurus. With Prankster, Whimsicott can easily use Encore to lock the opposing Pokemon into the ever-present Protect. The mere threat of being locked into Protect forces an opponent to play more aggressively even when it is not beneficial to them. Beyond sheer disruption, Whimsicott can provide direct support to its own team with Tailwind.</p> <p>Whimsicott's main drawback is that it is incredibly frail, which forces it to use a Focus Sash or risk being OHKOed by even neutral hits, and it is unlikely that Whimsicott will survive for more than two turns. While Whimsicott can be very disruptive, because of its shallow movepool, Whimsicott is very predictable, and its poor offensive stats and limited movepool leave it with little to no offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Helping Hand is one of Whimsicott's better other options, in tandem with Tailwind it allows Whimsicott's partner to both hit harder and faster. Protect is an option if you are opting for longevity on Whimsicott; however, it is harder to fit on a set without becoming Taunt bait. Mental Herb is an option over Focus Sash if you are concerned with Whimsicott getting Taunted; however, this is very situational. Both Trick Room and Stun Spore are potential options over Tailwind. Trick Room Whimsicott is primarily for the surprise value, but is largely outclassed by Cresselia. Stun Spore lets you paralyze Pokemon, most importantly Landorus-T, but outside of that it is outclassed Thundurus. Charm and Confide are both potential options, as they lower the opposing Pokemon's Attack or Special Attack by two stages, respectively. These moves can be nice for crippling the opponent's powerhouses, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence; however, these drops can be reset by switching out, and the moves take up slots which can be better used by other moves. Fake Tears is an option that lowers the opposing Pokemon's Special Defense by two stages. It can be useful when used alongside strong special attackers such as Mega Gardevoir and Life Orb Rotom-W, which enjoy Tailwind support as well. However, Fake Tears is generally an inferior option to Helping Hand, as it only lowers Special Defense. The TerraCott combination is one which needs mentioning. The combination of Beat Up Whimsicott and Terrakion is both very strong and very obvious. A half decent player will be able to see this strategy coming very easily and will be prepared for it, be it through Choice Scarf Landorus-T or a Wide Guard user. While this strategy is far from a top-tier strategy, but it can be fun to try out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur are some of the best ways of dealing with Whimsicott. Ferrothorn has either Gyro Ball or Iron Head while Mega Venusaur as Sludge Bomb, which will bring Whimsicott down to its Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan: Mega Kangaskhan can OHKO Whimsicott through its Focus Sash, limiting Whimsicott's effectiveness, as it will only be able to use one move before fainting. Be wary of using Fake Out on Whimsicott if you aren't double targeting it, as Whimsicott will use Encore to lock Kangaskhan into Fake Out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran all threaten Whimsicott. Talonflame will hit Whimsicott first due to Brave Bird's priority and also has access to Quick Guard, limiting Whimsicott to using at most one move. Heatran and Mega Charizard Y both offensively threaten Whimsicott and don't rely on support moves.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types, particularly Mega Metagross and Heatran, all offensively threaten Whimsicott. Aegislash will win this matchup; however, Aegislash must be careful of Taunt and Encore forcing it to switch, as they block it from or lock it into using King's Shield.</p> <p><strong>Quick Guard: Quick Guard blocks Whimsicott's primary means of support, largely making it useless. Talonflame and Virizion are two of the best users of Quick Guard in the format.</p> <p><strong>Ignoring Whimsicott: If your Pokemon aren't bothered by Taunt or Encore, Whimsicott's lack of offensive presence can be capitalized on. You can double target one Pokemon safely while the opponent is forced to switch out Whimsicott or lose momentum.</p>",

        "name": "Disruptive Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Whimsicott is primarily used for its ability to disrupt the opponent's strategy; the two best moves for doing this are Taunt and Encore. Taunt prevents the usage of status moves, whereas Encore locks the target into the move it used last. Taunt has the advantage of shutting down Pokemon that rely on support moves to perform well, such as Thundurus, Aegislash, and Amoonguss. While Encore is far more situational, it also has the advantage of being far more general, as Protect is such a prevalent move. This allows Whimsicott to incapacitate almost any Pokemon; Encore can also lock an opposing Pokemon into Trick Room, and Mega Salamence into Dragon Dance. When these moves are used in tandem with each other, Whimsicott has the capability to force switches or allow its partner to pick up KOs or set up. Whimsicott is also capable of providing more direct team support through Tailwind. Doubling your teams's Speed allows for offensive Pokemon, such as Terrakion, Kangaskhan, and Heatran, to attack more freely, as they do not have to worry about being outsped and potentially KOed. Because Whimsicott lacks a real offensive presence, the fourth moveslot should be reserved either Moonblast or Giga Drain. Moonblast OHKOes Hydreigon and 2HKOes Mega Salamence with no HP investment. Giga Drain hits Water-types for super effective damage and lets Whimsicott recover some health. The move that you opt for should be based around the coverage that your team needs the most.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Whimsicott is a pretty straightforward Pokemon; maximum Speed EVs along with Prankster guarantee that its priority moves will go before Thundurus's. Maximum HP EVs do very little given how frail Whimsicott is anyway; however, no other stat benefits from the investment. Focus Sash ensures that Whimsicott is able to use at least one move before fainting.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Whimsicott works best as a lead, as it offers very little late-game support due to its lack of an offensive presence. While counterintuitive, it's often better to let Whimsicott faint once it has provided its support to allow a more offensive Pokemon to come in and effectively use the disruption that Whimsicott provided early-game. Encore is used to lock an opposing Pokemon into Protect; however, it can effectively be used after Fake Out, Trick Room, or setup moves. As Whimsicott's Special Attack is so poor, it deals very little neutral damage, and it is almost always better to go for either Taunt or Encore. Whimsicott should use Tailwind when it is appropriate, such as when your Pokemon to be faster to win, or when Whimsicott is about to faint and is used as a final form of support.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Kangaskhan makes good use of Whimsicott's support. Taunt shuts down Aegislash, preventing it from either using King's Shield or Substitute. Taunt also prevents Pokemon from using status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, two other common ways of checking Mega Kangaskhan. On top of that, Tailwind allows Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed every major threat with boosted or unboosted Speed. Mega Gengar has a far easier time setting up Perish Songs with Whimsicott's support. Whimsicott can also prevent Mega Gengar from being Taunted itself, as Whimsicott has the fastest Taunt in the game thanks to it Speed and Prankster. With Whimsicott's support, Mega Metagross has an easier time both setting up and maintaining a Substitute. Mega Metagross also appreciates the Speed boost from Tailwind, as it allows it to outspeed Landorus-T and OHKO it with Ice Punch. Offensive Pokemon in general enjoy Tailwind support, with Terrakion and Heatran being two good examples.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Scrafty is an excellent bulky support Pokemon because of its access to both Intimidate and Fake Out, along with excellent defensive stats. By merit of its typing, it can also deal good damage to big threats such as Mega Kangaskhan, Heatran, Aegislash, and even Bisharp despite Scrafty feeding it Defiant boosts. However, besides Bisharp, it can't directly KO many Pokemon with its average Attack stat and low Base Power moves, so it can sometimes be passive and easy to ignore for the enemy team. Its bulk also suffers because of its unfortunate 4x weakness to Fairy, making it much easier to remove than in previous Battle Spot Doubles metagames. However, Scrafty's niche is still uncontested, especially with Hitmontop losing popularity, so its support options make it well worth a teamslot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Sylveon, (Mega) Gardevoir, Mega Mawile, Togekiss, Clefable, and even Clefairy all threaten Scrafty with their STAB Fairy-type moves. Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir don't even have to worry about redirection, predicting a switch, or attacking into Protect either, making them even more dangerous for Scrafty and its team.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Mega Salamence and Talonflame can easily OHKO Scrafty with Double-Edge or Brave Bird provided they haven't been Intimidated multiple times.</p> <p><strong>Burns and Intimidate: Once Scrafty's already decidedly average Attack stat gets cut, it struggles to deal damage or do much of anything outside of Taunt and removing items. Landorus-T, Salamence, Gyarados, and Mawile are all common Intimidate users. Sableye and Rotom-W can stomach Scrafty's attacks even before they burn it. The same goes for Entei and Suicune, though they instead use Sacred Fire or Scald repeatedly until they either burn or KO Scrafty, and there's not much Scrafty can do about it. Even without burn or Intimidate support, bulkier Pokemon should be able to handle Scrafty one-on-one anyway.</p>",

        "name": "Bulky Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out is great for helping partner Pokemon set up and, in general, is an easy move to apply pressure with. Drain Punch is Scrafty's main STAB option and source of recovery. Knock Off is a secondary STAB move that has great neutral coverage with Drain Punch and can help scout and remove items from your opponent's team. Protect is essentially Scrafty's first and only line of defense against Fairy-types, as well as Flying-types such as Talonflame and Salamence, and helps preserve its Intimidate and Fake Out in general by merit of keeping Scrafty alive. Ice Punch is mainly for coverage against Landorus-T, the most common Intimidate user, along with Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Salamence. Taunt is useful to shut down Trick Room and sleep-inducing moves, along with disabling Protect and Substitute. It also allows Scrafty to become a harder check to Aegislash and Amoonguss, disabling them from using status moves and making them much more vulnerable to attacks from Scrafty and its partner.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry is your go-to item for bulky Pokemon, as instantly recovering a fourth of Scrafty's health is incredibly useful. Obviously, don't use Assault Vest with Protect or Taunt, as Assault Vest will disable those moves. Leftovers can be used over Sitrus Berry if it's taken already. Lum Berry is especially helpful with Taunt, as it helps suppress Amoonguss's Spore or Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp without fear of being hit by one of those moves first.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Scrafty to survive Choice Specs Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and maximum Special Attack investment Timid Mega Charizard Y's Overheat in the sun (along with bulkier Modest Charizard's Overheat) without Assault Vest. The rest is dumped into Attack to 2HKO 4 HP Mega Kangaskhan with Drain Punch. Alternatively, Scrafty can run an Adamant nature and maximum Attack investment to 2HKO Mega Kangaskhan that have 252 HP EVs, but this makes Scrafty less bulky. The change in bulk is less noticeable with Assault Vest, however.</p> <p>When using Scrafty with speed control, use 52 Speed EVs to outspeed Jolly Garchomp with Tailwind, 28 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Bisharp with Icy Wind, and a Sassy or Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs with Trick Room. 20 Speed EVs allow Scrafty to outspeed Modest Aegislash and other base 60 Speed Pokemon regardless of speed control and Taunt them before they set up a Substitute or use other annoying moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's generally a good idea to lead with Scrafty because of the utility of Fake Out and Intimidate, though you may want to think twice if you see Milotic or Bisharp in Team Preview. Fake Out is great to create free turns for Scrafty's partner and Intimidate provides great team support, but Scrafty can become a sitting duck rather quickly. Switch it in and out to refresh both of them and be aware of when Scrafty isn't doing much so that you can make more effective switches.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fake Out is an amazing move when paired with Substitute or Trick Room. Mega Metagross, Heatran, and Aegislash have great defensive synergy with Scrafty and can easily set up Substitutes when threats such as Landorus-T are preoccupied with Fake Out. The same goes for Trick Room; Jellicent, Cresselia, and Gothitelle all appreciate Scrafty's support options, though you should be careful about being too passive when leading with Cresselia and Scrafty.</p> <p>Of course, Fake Out and Intimidate are universally appreciated. For example, Tailwind users such as Suicune and Talonflame can set up Tailwind more easily, and physically frail sweepers such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Gardevoir, and Sylveon enjoy both Intimidate and Fake Out.</p> <p>You can run another Intimidate user if you're confident that Defiant won't be a problem. Mega Manectric and Landorus-T can switch out with Volt Switch and U-turn, respectively, making it possible to trigger Intimidate three times in one turn. Gyarados can set up Dragon Dances more easily with Fake Out support, as well. Type synergy to reuse Scrafty's Intimidate is important as well, and Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, Mega Gengar, Rotom-W, Thundurus, and Zapdos all make for great options for type synergy.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Snarl may have obscenely low damage output considering it has roughly 61 Base Power after STAB and spread damage reduction and runs off of Scrafty's base 45 Special Attack, but it lowers the Special Attack of threats such as Heatran and Aegislash and can even hit through Substitutes to further annoy opponents. Quick Guard helps against priority attacks such as Scizor's Bullet Punch, Talonflame's Brave Bird, and Thundurus's Thunder Wave, but it can't guard against most other Fake Out users such as Kangaskhan under normal conditions because of Scrafty's low Speed and the fact that Quick Guard and Fake Out share the same priority. Super Fang keeps Scrafty useful after it gets burned or Intimidated, shaving off half of the foe's health. This can be especially helpful against bulkier Pokemon such as Suicune, but be aware that you may trigger a Sitrus Berry if the foe has an even HP stat. Detect can be used over Protect to avoid Imprison disabling it. However, it has fewer PP and Scrafty likes to hang around for a while, so more PP in most matches is more worthwhile than preparing for the incredibly rare Imprison.</p> <p>In terms of offense, Scrafty has a lot of options, though in many cases there are other Pokemon that perform the role of bulky attacker better, such as Hariyama. High Jump Kick and Low Kick lack the recovery factor that Drain Punch has, but they help Scrafty KO Kangaskhan more efficiently. However, they suffer from inconsistent damage output otherwise. Stone Edge and Poison Jab are coverage options for Flying-types and Fairy-types, respectively, though their damage outputs are still low and Scrafty might be better off just letting a partner handle such threats.</p>"

  "Cofagrigus": {
    "overview": "<p>Cofagrigus carves itself a niche among other bulky Ghost-type Trick Room setters, valued for their immunity to Fake Out, with its access to a plethora of interesting support moves and an ability unique to it that cripples contact attackers reliant on their abilities. If considering Cofagrigus for your team, however, you should be confident that you're taking proper advantage of those niches, as there are alternatives that are bulkier, such as Dusclops, and more offensive, such as Chandelure and Jellicent.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Safety Goggles blocks Spore, aiding Cofagrigus in setting up Trick Room and helping it check Amoonguss once the field condition is active. Fake Tears gives Cofagrigus more offensive presence and can support a specially attacking teammate. Hex is an alternative to Shadow Ball that deals more damage to targets burned by Will-O-Wisp. Pain Split provides recovery and works well with Cofagrigus due to its base low HP. Hidden Power Fighting can help check Dark-types such as Bisharp and Tyranitar, although it can't OHKO either of them without Special Attack investment, which isn't recommended because Cofagrigus needs its bulk. Imprison prevents foes from reversing Trick Room and using Shadow Ball. After You allows faster teammates to move earlier under Trick Room, allowing for more flexible semi-Trick Room teams. Safeguard protects both Cofagrigus and its teammates from status conditions. Magic Coat reflects back status moves, including Taunt, preventing it without forcing Cofagrigus to run a Mental Herb.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types deal super effective damage to Cofagrigus and resist Shadow Ball. Physical Dark-types such as Bisharp, Scrafty, and Tyranitar make for good checks, although they should be wary of Will-O-Wisp, which reduces their damage output. Tyranitar can also utilize a special attacking set, which will 2HKO Cofagrigus with Dark Pulse. Hydreigon can OHKO Cofagrigus with Dark Pulse when holding either Life Orb or Choice Specs.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types can hit Cofagrigus with their super effective STAB moves. Aegislash is particularly threatening, as two of its common item choices, Life Orb and Weakness Policy, allow it to OHKO Cofagrigus with Shadow Ball. Chandelure can activate Flash Fire by switching into Will-O-Wisp and can also OHKO Cofagrigus with Shadow Ball when holding a Life Orb. Jellicent trades positively with Cofagrigus provided that it is running minor Special Attack investment.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Special attackers target Cofagrigus's weaker Special Defense stat and can't be neutered offensively by Will-O-Wisp. Sylveon takes little damage from Shadow Ball due to its high Special Defense and can 2HKO Cofagrigus with both Shadow Ball and Hyper Voice when holding either Life Orb or Choice Specs. Heatran can switch in on Will-O-Wisp and 2HKO Cofagrigus with its Flash Fire-boosted Heat Wave. Mega Charizard Y can OHKO Cofagrigus with Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Spore Users: Spore users such as Amoonguss and Breloom can completely shut down Cofagrigus not holding Safety Goggles by putting it to sleep, which prevents Trick Room from being set up.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: While Mental Herb is a common item choice for Cofagrigus, consecutive uses of Taunt from Pokemon such as Prankster Thundurus will still majorly shut down Cofagrigus, as it's reliant on its support moves to function.</p>",

Will-O-Wisp neuters the damage output of physical attackers and inflicts residual damage. Shadow Ball is an offensive option that generally deals more damage than Night Shade; however, Night Shade's fixed damage is better against Dark-types and foes with high Special Defense. Ally Switch helps minimize the damage both Cofagrigus and its partner take by causing the foe's moves to mistarget. Protect shields Cofagrigus from a threat, allowing its partner to eliminate the threat or switch into a teammate with a more favorable matchup. Disable prevents a foe from using their most recently used move, which is especially potent against Choice-locked Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread with a Relaxed nature allows Cofagrigus to, 93.7% of the time, survive Life Orb Bisharp's Knock Off as well as Aegislash's Shadow Ball. Mental Herb is used primarily to stop Taunt from preventing Cofagrigus from setting up Trick Room. If Taunt is unconcerning, Sitrus Berry can be used instead to improve Cofagrigus's longevity. Attack and Speed IVs of 0 are used to minimize both Foul Play and confusion damage and make Cofagrigus as fast as possible under Trick Room, respectively.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Cofagrigus should mostly be used in the lead position alongside a Fake Out user in order to provide the greatest chance of setting up Trick Room. Will-O-Wisp is pretty spammable and should be used liberally. Shadow Ball or Night Shade should generally only be used to drop a foe into KO range for a partner or to break a Substitute. Frequent use of Ally Switch may be tempting, but it shouldn't be overly relied upon in case your opponent catches on and starts to predict its use.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hariyama and Scrafty can use Fake Out to help Cofagrigus set up Trick Room and, as Fighting-types, can handle Dark-types that threaten Cofagrigus. Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Mega Mawile, and Azumarill are also effective at dealing with Dark-types. Using a Dark-type of your own such as Scrafty, Tyranitar, or Bisharp can be worthwhile as well to help deal with opposing Ghost-types. Users of redirection moves, such as Rage Powder Amoonguss, can redirect super effective hits to help Cofagrigus set up Trick Room. Spread attackers that can take quick advantage of Trick Room's limited turns such as Mega Camerupt, Heatran, and Abomasnow also make for potent allies.

Thanks to Shadow Tag, teammates with Intimidate can repeatedly switch in and render trapped physical attackers useless with the multiple Attack drops.

Thunder Wave is a good form of speed control if you're not using Gothitelle with Trick Room. Light Screen and Reflect can be used to make Gothitelle and its allies bulkier and harder to take down.

Occa Berry and Coba Berry alleviate Amoonguss's weaknesses, as does Mental Herb for Taunt, making them good filler items to reach for if Amoonguss's other options are taken by its teammates. Effect Spore is outclassed by Regenerator not only because of the loss in potential healing, but also because it can get in the way of Sporing something important if Effect Spore doesn't put them to sleep itself.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Talonflame and Mega Salamence can OHKO with Brave Bird and Return or Double-Edge, respectively, and Talonflame can even Taunt Amoonguss to let it waste turns by Giga Draining.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Charizard Y can easily OHKO Amoonguss with a sun-boosted Heat Wave to ignore Rage Powder.

Negative Speed natures are preferred to underspeed Pokemon under Trick Room, which is useful to check opposing Trick Room teams, even if you're not using it yourself. Neutral Speed natures are also acceptable to outspeed slower Pokemon such as Aegislash and Spore them before they attack. 68 Speed EVs with a Bold nature let Amoonguss outspeed Quiet Aegislash, and more Speed EVs can be used for other threats, but bear in mind Amoonguss isn't going to outspeed much of anything considering its base 30 Speed. If a more specially defensive spread is wanted, 188 HP / 164 Def / 156 SpD with a Sassy nature does the job. It allows Amoonguss to live Psychic from positive natured Mega Gardevoir most of the time, while still retaining a good amount of physical bulk.</p> <p>Sitrus Berry is the preferred item to allow Amoonguss to take in more hits with Rage Powder, but it can be replaced with Black Sludge or Leftovers if another Pokemon needs it more (keeping in mind Item Clause). Rocky Helmet is useful for getting damage off on physical attackers, most notably Mega Kangaskhan, which loses a third of its health when it attacks Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You should focus on using Spore and Rage Powder and Protecting when Amoonguss is immediately threatened. Keep in mind that you can switch out to restore health with Regenerator, which makes conserving Amoonguss after it takes a beating much more advantageous. Attacking with Amoonguss isn't ideal unless it gets Taunted and would rather not or can't switch out, unless you think you can break a Focus Sash or grab a KO against a severely weakened Pokemon. Also keep in mind that allowing Amoonguss to faint for a greater cause, such as getting Mega Kangaskhan to +2 or setting up Trick Room, isn't something to strictly avoid.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss does well with just about anything that doesn't share too many of its weaknesses. Examples are Mega Kangaskhan, Terrakion, and Heatran, as Amoonguss resists most if not all of their weaknesses. Trick Room Pokemon such as Jellicent also enjoy Amoonguss's company, especially because Amoonguss is often the slowest Pokemon on the field, which means it can outspeed and Spore anything without a Grass typing or Safety Goggles. Amoonguss also works well with or against rain teams, as they remove its Fire weakness and often have Water-types. Intimidate also allows Amoonguss to survive attacks such as Talonflame's Brave Bird, making it more useful to sponge hits. Gyarados is a prime example, but of course just about anything appreciates having Amoonguss around.</p>"

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>Base 100 HP and base 105 Special Defense stats make Jellicent capable of surviving a plethora of special attacks, including Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam, Mega Gengar's Shadow Ball, Mega Manectric's and Rotom-W's Thunderbolt, Hydreigon's Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse, and Sylveon's Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice. Its usable base 85 Special Attack stat, rather low base 60 Speed stat, access to Trick Room, and amazing coverage moves such as Water Spout, Scald, Shadow Ball, and Ice Beam turn Jellicent into a formidable Trick Room setter and attacker.</p> <p>While Jellicent's Water / Ghost typing may seem bad at first glance, it is nothing to laugh at; although it gives Jellicent four weaknesses, it also grants six resistances as well as immunities to Normal- and Fighting-type attacks such as Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge and Terrakion's Close Combat. In addition, Water Absorb makes Jellicent immune to Water-type attacks, resulting in the possession of three immunities. Unfortunately, Jellicent's mediocre base 70 Defense stat makes it incapable of taking common physical attacks such as Mega Salamence's Double-Edge, Bisharp's Knock Off, and Talonflame's Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jellicent's very diverse movepool includes moves such as Hydro Pump, Surf, Icy Wind, Blizzard, Giga Drain, Energy Ball, Sludge Bomb, Taunt, and Will-O-Wisp. Safety Goggles prevents Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss from putting Jellicent to sleep with Sleep Powder and Spore, respectively, and makes Jellicent immune to Rage Powder as well as residual damage from sand and hail. Rocky Helmet racks up quick damage against Pokemon with contact moves. A set bluffing Trick Room can also be utilized.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Type Advantages: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss resist Water Spout, can put Jellicent to sleep with their respective sleep-inducing move, and do a fair amount of damage with Giga Drain. Dragon-types such as Mega Sceptile, Mega Salamence, and Hydreigon also resist Water Spout, and threaten Jellicent with a Leaf Storm, Double-Edge, and Dark Pulse, respectively. They do, however, have to be wary of Ice Beam. Other Pokemon that resist Water Spout include Ludicolo and Rotom-W; Ludicolo threatens Jellicent with Giga Drain, and Rotom-W threatens Jellicent with Thunderbolt. Cursed Body Jellicent may attempt to stall out these moves with Recover, but can't do much damage in return. Life Orb Thundurus has a very low—but possible—chance to OHKO Jellicent with Thunderbolt, and Bisharp easily OHKOes Jellicent with Knock Off. Ghost-types, such as Gengar, its Mega Evolution, and Aegislash, trade attacks with Jellicent. Most of the time, Jellicent wins, but depending on the scenario, Jellicent could fall short to one of those Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Sun from Mega Charizard Y weakens Jellicent's main STAB attack, Water Spout, and also powers up Solar Beam, which is a big threat to Jellicent. Tyranitar sets up sand to boost its Special Defense and has a chance to OHKO Jellicent with Crunch.</p>",

        "name": "Bulky Support",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Jellicent's main attack, doing solid damage with a chance to burn its target. Will-O-Wisp lets Jellicent cripple physical attackers. Recover keeps Jellicent operating longer. Protect allows Jellicent to scout as well as dodge double targets. Protect is normally mandatory in doubles, but Jellicent is bulky enough that Hex or Shadow Ball can be considered. Ice Beam can be used in the final slot if you want to deal with Landorus-T and Dragon-types faster.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread allows Jellicent to survive Hydreigon's Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse, Mega Salamence's Double-Edge, and two Earthquakes from Landorus-T. Cursed Body is used over Water Absorb, as the possibility of crippling your opponent's Pokemon is far more useful for this set than a Water immunity. Jellicent makes a solid Leftovers user thanks to its bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Jellicent's useful array of resistances to come in and start spreading burns. Use Recover when Jellicent's taken a beating. If the opponent is likely to switch Pokemon, it's best to go for a Will-O-Wisp or Recover as they switch, as a Pokemon that is resistant to Jellicent's attacks is likely coming out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Jellicent enjoys the company of Pokemon that can buy it some time to burn the foe. In this sense, Mega Kangaskhan and Amoonguss make for good partners. Grass- and Fire-types, such as Amoonguss, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, synergize well with Jellicent. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and Fairy-types such as Sylveon help deal with Jellicent's vulnerability to Dark-types such as Hydreigon.</p>"

        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room supports Jellicent and its teammates by helping them move first if they're slow. Water Spout is Jellicent's most powerful STAB attack and hits both foes but is unreliable in terms of power; the lower Jellicent's remaining HP is, the lower Water Spout's power is. Scald is significantly less powerful under certain conditions but has a nifty 30% chance to inflict a burn on its target. Shadow Ball is Jellicent's Ghost-type STAB attack, hitting Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon for super effective damage. Ice Beam scores an OHKO against Mega Sceptile, Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Landorus-T. In general, it is useful for hitting Dragon-types. Recover restores 50% of Jellicent's maximum HP, keeping Jellicent healthy and maintaining Water Spout's high power. Protect can be used in place of Recover, as it protects Jellicent for a turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximizing Jellicent's HP stat increases its natural bulk. 12 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Modest Mega Gengar's Shadow Ball will never OHKO Jellicent. The remaining EVs are distributed into Jellicent's Special Attack stat to let it hit as hard as possible. A Quiet nature further boosts Jellicent's Special Attack stat; it also lowers Jellicent's Speed stat, allowing Jellicent to be faster under the effects of Trick Room. 0 Speed IVs make Jellicent as slow as it can possibly be. A bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 60 Def / 92 SpA / 100 SpD with a Sassy nature could be utilized, as it lets Jellicent survive a Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse from Modest Hydreigon and ensures that Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake is a 3HKO; if using this EV spread, Jellicent should be given Leftovers. Sitrus Berry helps maintain Water Spout's power and increases Jellicent's longevity. Mental Herb, on the other hand, helps prevent Taunt, which guarantees that Jellicent will successfully set up Trick Room.</p> <p>Water Absorb is the preferred ability because it heals Jellicent by 25% of its maximum HP every time it is hit by a Water-type move, further maintaining Water Spout's power if Jellicent is sent into a predicted Water-type attack. Cursed Body, on the other hand, is useful in combination with Recover, helping Jellicent stall out attacks such as Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball, and can also mess with Pokemon holding a Choice item. Because most Jellicent use Water Absorb, opponents probably won't have their Pokemon attack Jellicent with a Water-type move anyway; if you can, try to bluff a Water Absorb set. If you decide to use Cursed Body, it should strictly be used alongside Recover.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Trick Room as a partner uses Fake Out or Protect. Water Spout is the move that Jellicent should be using most of the time, so if Jellicent is at low HP, use Recover to maintain its high Base Power. If running Water Absorb, have Jellicent switch in on predicted Water-type attacks to heal some of its HP. If Cursed Body is being used, spam Recover to stall out the foe's move; their attack will be disabled eventually.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slow Fake Out users such as Hariyama and Scrafty help Jellicent safely set up Trick Room. Fighting-types such as Conkeldurr and the aforementioned Fake Out users pair well with Jellicent, as Jellicent can beat the Psychic-types that threaten all but Scrafty, and they can beat the Dark-types that threaten Jellicent. Mega Mawile can also handle Dark-types, and Jellicent can beat the Fire-types that threaten Mega Mawile. Politoed's Drizzle ability sets up rain, and if Jellicent has Water Absorb, Politoed can spam Surf to constantly heal Jellicent to keep it healthy and retain Water Spout's power. Redirection support from Pokemon such as Togekiss and Amoonguss helps Jellicent safely set up Trick Room. Togekiss can handle most of the Dark-types that threaten Jellicent, and Jellicent can handle the Fire-, Psychic-, and Ice-types that threaten Amoonguss, which works especially well under Trick Room. Mega Camerupt and Mega Abomasnow are both great Trick Room sweepers that can easily dispose of the Grass-types that threaten Jellicent. Mawile and Scrafty provide Intimidate support, giving Jellicent an easier time against physical attackers. In Battle Spot Doubles, you can get away with using two Trick Room setters; as a result, Cresselia and Gothitelle are good partners for Jellicent. They provide Helping Hand support to boost the power of Jellicent's attacks to monstrous levels; however, these Pokemon share Jellicent's weakness to Ghost-type moves.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn's amazing defensive typing and Iron Barbs ability allow it to check common Pokemon in the metagame, such as Landorus-T, Mega Metagross, and Rotom-W. Ferrothorn's typing makes it immune to Spore and Rage Powder and makes it one of the best checks to rain teams; Ferrothorn is also an amazing asset on rain teams due to the rain weakening Fire-type attacks and its synergy with Kingdra. Ferrothorn, however, is easily checked by common Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran. Ferrothorn also faces competition from Amoonguss as a bulky Grass-type. On the other hand, Ferrothorn is a Pokemon of extremes; you either can't touch it or it can't touch you.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Seed Bomb is an option for a more reliable Grass-type STAB move, but it lacks power. Occa Berry can mitigate Ferrothorn's Fire weakness. Keep in mind, however, that Ferrothorn needs more Special Defense investment to survive common Fire-type attacks. Chople Berry allows Ferrothorn to survive Terrakion's Close Combat and OHKO with any of its STAB options after the defense drops.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ignoring Ferrothorn: Grass- and Steel-type coverage isn't exactly stellar. Having two Pokemon on the field that resist both, especially if they're immune to Leech Seed, helps immensely with dealing with Ferrothorn. Taunting it also helps cut down on how many Pokemon get Leech Seeded.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Due to Ferrothorn's 4x Fire weakness, most Fire-type attacks, even weaker non-STAB ones, will OHKO Ferrothorn. Common Fire-type Pokemon include Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, while Pokemon such as Hydreigon tend to carry a Fire-type coverage move. Because Ferrothorn works best late-game, opponents should be sure to conserve their Fire-type attackers until Ferrothorn is gone.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: While some Fighting-types, such as Terrakion, don't like to be hit with Thunder Wave or Gyro Ball, most Fighting-types, such as Virizion, Mega Lucario, Conkeldurr, Superpower Breloom, and Hariyama, can do upwards of 75% to Ferrothorn, making them great checks provided Ferrothorn gets hit with chip damage, which is fairly easy considering how slow Ferrothorn is.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Intimidate and burns will severely cripple Ferrothorn, as they massively lower its damage output, while burn also slowly chips away at Ferrothorn's HP.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gyro Ball is a STAB move that can hit faster Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, hard due to Ferrothorn's low Speed. Iron Head is a more consistent Steel-type STAB move that does more damage to slower Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Mega Mawile, Clefairy, and Clefable. Power Whip is a Grass-type STAB move that allows Ferrothorn to check Suicune and OHKO 252 HP / 44 Def Rotom-W. Leech Seed gives Ferrothorn the ability to heal back some HP while also doing residual damage to the foe, while Thunder Wave gives Ferrothorn the ability to provide speed control. Protect is standard and can protect Ferrothorn from a hit that would otherwise KO it, such as a Heat Wave from Mega Charizard Y.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>204 Attack EVs with a Brave nature allow Ferrothorn to OHKO standard 252 HP / 44 Def Rotom-W with Power Whip. A Brave nature also boosts the power of Gyro Ball by lowering Ferrothorn's Speed. Maximum HP EVs with 52 Special Defense EVs give Ferrothorn more bulk. Lum Berry is usually the preferred item, as it prevents Ferrothorn from being crippled by burns, which allows it to check Rotom-W better. Rocky Helmet is an option to punish weaker contact moves, such as a Fake Out on the switch in. Ferrothorn is also a solid user of Leftovers, as it can add to Ferrothorn's longevity allowing it to function as a supporting tank longer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ferrothorn can easily be switched into weaker non-super effective attacks such as Fake Out and Draco Meteor, but be wary of Fire-type moves. Ferrothorn works great late-game. Take out whatever can threaten Ferrothorn and use it as a win condition to tank whatever the opponent has left.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Terrakion is a great partner, as it is able to check Fire-types, such as Mega Charizard Y, Heatran, and Talonflame, that threaten Ferrothorn, while also checking opposing Steel-types that resist Ferrothorn's STAB moves. Ferrothorn, in turn, can check Landorus-T, one of the biggest checks to Terrakion, and bulky Water-types that Terrakion has trouble OHKOing. Heatran, Talonflame, and Mega Charizard Y have good synergy with Ferrothorn, as they can all check Steel-types. Heatran deters Heat Wave users, while Talonflame can also check Fighting-types that threaten Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn, in turn, helps by checking Rotom-W and Rock-types. Ferrothorn also has a great matchup against rain teams, which helps out Mega Charizard Y immensely. Ferrothorn appreciates support from Water-types in particular; Rotom-W and Politoed all work with it wonderfully. Ferrothorn works really well in a rain team, most notably with Kingdra, as Ferrothorn can easily switch into Dragon- and Fairy-type moves aimed at Kingdra. Rain teams tend to struggle with the Mega Kangaskhan and Clefairy duo, which Ferrothorn does pretty well against, though Gyro Ball doesn't do much to Clefairy. Mega Salamence is another good partner, as Ferrothorn is able to switch into Fairy-, Rock-, and Dragon-type attacks aimed at Mega Salamence while Salamence can switch into Fighting- and Fire-type attacks aimed at Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn can also check both Landorus-T and Rotom-W, which benefits Mega Salamence greatly. Most Dragon-types, in general, have nice synergy with Ferrothorn. Chandelure also works well with Ferrothorn, as it can use Trick Room to turn Ferrothorn's terrible Speed into an advantage and checks Steel-types, such as Aegislash, that Ferrothorn has trouble hitting.</p>"

It is also checked by a lot of common Pokemon in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame such as Terrakion, Landorus-T, and Gengar. Chandelure's middling speed tier allows it to perform as either a Trick Room setter or Choice Scarf attacker. Unlike most Trick Room setters, Chandelure actually has a strong offensive presence. Chandelure's Choice Scarf set is great against a lot of common Pokemon that like to hide behind Substitute, such as Metagross, Aegislash, and Gengar, which would otherwise check Chandelure pretty hard without a Choice Scarf.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Specs gives Chandelure an increased damage output. Imprison shuts down opposing Protect or Trick Room that the foe might be carrying. Fire Blast deals heavy damage without dropping Chandelure's Special Attack like Overheat does, while Flamethrower has more accuracy.

Heat Wave is Chandelure's Fire-type STAB move, while Overheat is another option for a Fire-type STAB move should you want more power. Heat Wave is generally the preferred option, however, as it does not lower Chandelure's Special Attack and can hit both foes at once. Shadow Ball has nice synergy with Heat Wave, as it can hit everything that Heat Wave can't hit neutrally, and it is boosted by STAB. Hidden Power Ice can be used in place of Shadow Ball to hit Landorus-T and Garchomp for super effective damage. Protect guards Chandelure from a potential double target, as most people will expect it to have a Focus Sash on Trick Room teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP EVs are used, as investing in Speed isn't recommended for a Trick Room setter. Maximum Special Attack EVs with a Quiet nature are necessary so that Chandelure can maximize its damage output. A Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs ensures that Chandelure will be as slow as possible. Flash Fire gives Chandelure an immunity to Fire-type moves, which can allow it to wall common Pokemon, such as Mega Charizard Y. Infiltrator can allow Chandelure to hit Pokemon that are trying to stall out Trick Room by hiding behind a Substitute. Focus Sash can allow Chandelure to take a single powerful hit. Life Orb is another option to give Chandelure more offensive presence.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Chandelure works well as a lead because its immunity to Fake Out can allow it to set up Trick Room on the first turn. Once Trick Room is set up, Chandelure should utilize its high Special Attack as much as possible by constantly applying pressure with its strong STAB attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hariyama is a great partner because its low Speed allows it to work really well under Trick Room. It can also provide Fake Out support, further boosting the chances for Chandelure to set up Trick Room. Hariyama can also check the Rock-types that threaten Chandelure while Chandelure checks the Psychic-types that threaten Hariyama. Another Fighting-type that works really well with Chandelure is Conkeldurr because it is able to check Bisharp, a big check to Chandelure, with Mach Punch before it is able to use Sucker Punch. Abomasnow is a great partner as well due to its low Speed and its ability to check the bulky Water-types that Chandelure has trouble breaking through. Chandelure can check the Steel-types that threaten Abomasnow, such as Ferrothorn and Scizor. Keep in mind, however, that, if you are running Abomasnow alongside Chandelure, it is best to run Life Orb because the hail will break Chandelure's Focus Sash. Mega Mawile is a great partner for Chandelure, despite both sharing a Ground weakness, as Chandelure is able to break through the Steel-types that give Mawile trouble, such as Ferrothorn. Mega Mawile, in return, can check the Rock- and Dark-types that threaten Chandelure. Slower Pokemon that benefit under Trick Room are good partners for Chandelure, such as Sylveon, which can threaten Dark-types, and Escavalier, which can threaten both Rock- and Dark-types.</p>"

Energy Ball gives Chandelure near perfect coverage because it allows Chandelure to hit Water-types for super effective damage, such as Rotom-W and Suicune. Hidden Power Ice is an option to hit Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Garchomp for super effective damage. Overheat is a stronger Fire-type STAB attack that allows Chandelure to OHKO Pokemon that Heat Wave cannot.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs increase Chandelure's damage output. Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature are used so that Chandelure has the highest Speed possible for Choice Scarf and because Chandelure's Speed isn't that high to begin with. Infiltrator allows Chandelure to outspeed and hit Metagross, Aegislash, and Gengar behind a Substitute. Flash Fire is a nice option because it allows Chandelure to switch into Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and gain an added boost to its Fire-type attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Chandelure doesn't have the best bulk in the world, it isn't recommended to switch it into attacks. Combined with Infiltrator, Choice Scarf Chandelure can check Substitute Metagross, Aegislash, and Gengar because it is able to bypass Substitute and hit them for super effective damage, so it is best to send out Chandelure when one of those Pokemon is out.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Virizion and Breloom are both great partners for Chandelure because they are able to check the bulky Water-types that wall Chandelure, freeing up a slot for another coverage move. They can both check Bisharp while Virizion can check Kangaskhan, Landorus, and Heatran better than Breloom while giving up the ability to use Spore. Chandelure supports both Virizion and Breloom by being able to check the Psychic-types that threaten them. Mega Metagross is also a good partner for Chandelure because Chandelure is able to check Substitute Aegislash, Ferrothorn, and Gengar, while Metagross can help against Rock-types, such as Terrakion. It also checks Mega Venusaur which can give Chandelure some trouble because Heat Wave will be weakened due to Thick Fat. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Rotom-W are good partners as well because they are able to check Rock- and Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Terrakion. Rotom-W can also use Will-O-Wisp, which can help alleviate Chandelure's mediocre bulk. Terrakion is also a wonderful partner because it is able to check Bisharp and Heatran while Chandelure helps Terrakion by removing Metagross and Aegislash. Thundurus is a good partner because it checks bulky Water-types, mainly Suicune, while also being able to Taunt opposing speed control users, allowing Chandelure to retain its fast Speed. Chandelure can hit Steel-types, which Thundurus has trouble hitting, for massive damage.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Bisharp is used mainly for its ability Defiant, which gives Bisharp an Attack boost when it is facing a Pokemon with Intimidate, a common ability due to the amount of physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and others. Its STAB moves and its impressive base 125 Attack, cover common Pokemon such as Sylveon, Aegislash, and Cresselia. Unfortunately, it suffers from rather poor stats everywhere else; its base 70 Speed can often lead to uncomfortable positions with Sucker Punch mind games when paired with its rather lackluster defenses. However, the free boosts granted by Defiant and its STAB Sucker Punch will always be a force in the metagame as long as Intimidate stays common.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Low Kick can be used to deal nice damage to the likes of Mega Kangaskhan, Heatran, and other Bisharp. Substitute and Swords Dance are great to take advantage of redirection or predicted Protects, though without redirection they can often prove to be unneeded filler options. Assurance was popular in VGC14 and is still a solid option when paired with multi-target attacks such as Heat Wave and Rock Slide, but Knock Off is less situational and less reliant on partners. Bisharp can use Taunt to prevent burns or Trick Room, and it synergizes nicely with Sucker Punch, but many of Bisharp's enemies might try to attack it directly. Stone Edge is Bisharp's only viable Super Effective move to use against Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Rotom-H, but it is inaccurate and often fails to outdamage Knock Off on Pokemon that aren't Fire-types. Lum Berry prevents burns and can be used with a partner's Swagger, though outside of this, Bisharp finds Focus Sash's defensive qualities or Life Orb's offensive qualities more appealing. Black Glasses don't boost Iron Head or Low Kick's base power, but boosts Sucker Punch and Knock Off without recoil at the cost of doing less damage, which is the main dealbreaker. Choice Band makes Bisharp deal a lot of damage, but it comes with the risk of being locked into an ineffectual Sucker Punch, which is easily stalled out, even in tournament matches that only last 15 minutes. When using Choice Band, a slightly bulkier spread of 100 HP / 252 Atk / 156 Spd can be used to survive attacks such as Garchomp's Earthquake, which is more useful because Pokemon with Choice items can't use Protect.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Generally speaking, Bisharp is beaten by Pokemon that can easily outspeed and OHKO it. Mega Kangaskhan stands out as a check, as its Power-Up Punch allows it to OHKO Bisharp regardless of Focus Sash and boost its Attack to +2 in the process.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T and Garchomp can easily threaten Bisharp with STAB Earthquakes, though Landorus-T's ability to combat Bisharp depends largely on whether or not it can maneuver onto the field without giving Bisharp a deadly Defiant boost.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Talonflame are all capable Fire-types that can outspeed and KO Bisharp, and the former two can stop Sucker Punch with Rage Powder or Quick Guard, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Conkeldurr and Breloom can use Mach Punch to KO Bisharp (though perhaps not before it uses Sucker Punch on something), preventing it from using Knock Off to remove an important item. Other Fighting-types such as (Mega) Lucario, (Mega) Gallade, and Terrakion are obvious choices when it comes to speedy Fighting-types.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Trick Room might be hard to set up against Bisharp with most users being weak to its STAB moves, but once it's up, Pokemon such as Mega Camerupt and Mega Mawile can easily threaten Bisharp with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Sableye: Sableye can reliably burn Bisharp thanks to Prankster, takes neutral damage from Bisharp's STAB moves, and has access to Recover.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sucker Punch's priority helps circumvent Bisharp's low defenses and Speed and will be its main method of attacking with Defiant boosts. Knock Off is good not only for the 97 Base Power it has on the first hit against any Pokemon with a non-Mega Stone item, but for scouting out items on the opponent's team as well (keeping in mind the Item Clause in the Battle Spot Doubles format). Iron Head threatens Fairy-types and most other Pokemon that resist Bisharp's Dark-type moves, and it is more consistent in terms of damage output. Protect is a staple in the last slot to keep Bisharp alive in spite of its poor defenses and discourages the opponent from attacking.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Adamant is the optimal nature, as Jolly Bisharp has a lower damage output and misses out on the chance to OHKO 4 HP Landorus-T after a Defiant Boost with Life Orb and other such benchmarks. Maximum Attack and Speed are used, as Focus Sash and Life Orb would waste any defensive investment anyway. Life Orb is for maximum damage output, while Focus Sash acts as a safety net for Bisharp if it whiffs a Sucker Punch or takes an Earthquake from a Pokemon such as Landorus-T, if Sucker Punch hits a low damage roll, or if Landorus is running a bulkier set. When using Life Orb, Bisharp's HP IVs should be reduced to 29 in order to reduce recoil.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Bisharp is relatively slow and frail, switching it in directly is risky, especially because it makes it less likely for Bisharp to receive a Defiant boost. Either leading with it or bringing it in after something is KOed is a good idea to get boosts from Pokemon such as Landorus-T and to preserve Bisharp.</p> <p>Because of the risky nature of Sucker Punch, you should try to use Bisharp's secondary STAB moves when the opportunity presents itself. Iron Head offers the chance to make a single target flinch, which can help out with Bisharp's lack of bulk, and Knock Off removes any non-Mega Stone item and helps scout out items on your opponent's team because of Item Clause. For example, if you Knock Off a Choice Scarf from a Hydreigon, you can rule out Choice Scarf on a Landorus-T you see in Team Preview.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Physical attackers such as Mega Salamence, Conkeldurr, and Mega Kangaskhan don't provide much support to Bisharp directly, but they are exceptionally good at baiting Intimidate, which is great for pressuring the opponent before the match even starts. Amoonguss and Togekiss are your go-to Pokemon for redirection and resist Fighting, making them excellent teammates to consider. Togekiss also helps to KO Fighting-types that can give Bisharp trouble, and Clefable deserves a mention, as it can boost Sucker Punches with Helping Hand, take care of Fighting-types, and provide Follow Me support. Pokemon that can OHKO Fighting- or Fire-types such as Sylveon, Talonflame, Suicune, and Rotom-W are good partners to round out Bisharp's fatal weaknesses.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon's one of the hardest hitting Pokemon in the ruleset. Its Choice Specs Draco Meteor hits like a nuclear bomb, OHKOing most of the Pokemon in the format. To back its Draco Meteor up, Hydreigon also has a powerful secondary Dark-type STAB, a wide movepool to cover gaps in its coverage, decent defenses thanks to high base stats, a few useful resistances, and Levitate. However, Hydreigon's 4x weakness to Fairy in a format where Sylveon is very common is a huge setback. A Hyper Voice from even the most defensive of Sylveon will cleanly OHKO Hydreigon. There's also an array of Steel-types that can sponge Draco Meteors and a whole host of faster Ice-, Fighting-, and Dragon-type Pokemon to keep it in check.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flash Cannon is an alternate coverage option on the Choice Specs set that can 2HKO Sylveon. However, its coverage is poor outside of that. Heat Wave's spread damage reduction will make Hydreigon miss out on KOs versus very relevant Steel-types such as Mega Mawile; however, it's still somewhat useful, as it's probably Hydreigon's most useful spread attack. Focus Blast destroys most Steel-types and nets a clean OHKO on Mega Kangaskhan, but it's inaccurate. U-turn is useful to get Hydreigon out and cause minor damage if you're expecting a switch. Hydreigon has access to Superpower and Rock Slide as well as a pretty solid Attack stat, but generally its Draco Meteors are doing a lot more. Hydreigon also has Tailwind, but Salamence and the Lati twins have better defensive typings and make better users of the move. A Haban Berry can let Hydreigon survive some of the weaker Draco Meteors in the metagame, but the loss of a boosting item is harsh.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Sylveon annihilates Hydreigon and other Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Gardevoir, and Whimsicott can deal with it effortlessly.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: If it's lacking the appropriate coverage move, Steel-types can cause trouble for Hydreigon. Most of them are still vulnerable to a neutral Dark Pulse, but forcing Hydreigon not to use Draco Meteor is useful in itself.</p> <p><strong>Faster Dragon-, Ice-, and Fighting-types</strong>: A number of Pokemon can outspeed and OHKO Hydreigon with their super effective attacks. These include Salamence, Latios, Garchomp, Greninja, Weavile, and Terrakion.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Draco Meteor will generally OHKO anything that isn't resistant, immune, or packing lots of special bulk. Dark Pulse is a reliable STAB coverage option that hits important targets such as Cresselia and Aegislash for super effective damage. Flamethrower and Earth Power are both for Steel-types. Both options can OHKO Bisharp and Mega Mawile not running significant Special Defense investment. Flamethrower allows Hydreigon to hit Ferrothorn and Scizor and is also the safer move to be locked into. Earth Power lets Hydreigon hit Heatran instead. Dragon Pulse gives Hydreigon a slightly stronger alternative STAB attack for late in the game, when you want to use its Dragon STAB but don't want the Special Attack drop.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Specs gives Hydreigon ridiculous power, while Choice Scarf lets Hydreigon surprise and OHKO something with Draco Meteor. The EVs are pretty straightforward; maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allow Hydreigon to lay down the hurt as quick and hard as possible. If you want to lower Hydreigon's Speed to invest more in bulk, 204 Speed will keep it faster than fully-invested Adamant Landorus-T. Jolly Garchomp can then outspeed Hydreigon and hit it with Dragon Claw, but it only has a 37.5% chance to OHKO. If you want to survive it every time, the smallest investment you can make is 28 HP / 36 Def. For better overall bulk at the cost of more EVs, 76 HP / 4 Def will also work.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The ideal way to play Hydreigon is to come in early game, hit something with Draco Meteor, run away, then come back later in the game to do it again or use other attacks that won't lower Hydreigon's stats. Hydreigon causes a lot of switching with the threat of its Draco Meteor. As such, if something is especially vulnerable to the attack and you noticed a Fairy- or Steel-type on your opponent's team in Team Preview, there's a good chance your opponent will switch out the vulnerable target to something to sponge it. In this scenario, you should contemplate using Draco Meteor on the less valuable target to maim them instead.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>You're going to need Pokemon that resist Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks when using Hydreigon. Most Steel-types, such as Metagross and Mawile, pair really well with it. A large recommendation goes to Aegislash. If they're both on the field, Aegislash can use Wide Guard to keep Hydreigon safe from Hyper Voice. They each generally take on what the other hates pretty well. Lastly, between the two of them, Hydreigon and Aegislash resist or are immune to every type in the game. Pokemon that can bust through Steel- and Fairy-types are also good partners for Hydreigon. Landorus-T and Garchomp are both fine choices, though watch out for Blizzard. Fake Out support is useful as well to narrow down what can attack Hydreigon for the turn. Mega Kangaskhan and Hitmontop go especially well with it. Redirecting Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks is also useful for Hydreigon. Togekiss and Amoonguss in particular make for great partners.</p>"

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>This set trades the drawbacks of being locked into one attack for less power and durability. Draco Meteor still hits very hard with a Life Orb and is your go to attack. Dark Pulse gives you a reliable STAB attack. Fire Blast is used for coverage against Steel-types and is used here over Flamethrower and Earth Power because of the drop in power from the Choice set. Protect allows Hydreigon to shield itself for a turn to avoid double targeting and what normally threatens it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb is your most powerful item choice if you wish for Hydreigon to hit hard with Draco Meteor while keeping Protect and the ability to switch moves. Modest is chosen for as much power as Hydreigon can muster; Hydreigon's power drops severely as you begin to take investment out of Special Attack. Due to the Life Orb, investing defensive EVs to survive certain hits isn't particularly useful, as Hydreigon will still be knocked out from Life Orb recoil.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hydreigon is a very simple Pokemon to use. Come in, use Draco Meteor on a Pokemon vulnerable to it, then switch out to restore Hydreigon's Special Attack. Be aware of what Steel- and Fairy-types your opponent is carrying and avoid using Draco Meteor on an obvious switch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon likes the presence of Steel-types such as Aegislash, Metagross, and Mawile to switch into Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks aimed at Hydreigon. Steel-type killers such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Arcanine are also great partners for Hydreigon, making sure it can fire off Draco Meteors uninhibited. Fake Out and redirectional support are recommended for this Hydreigon set; Kangaskhan, Amoonguss, and Togekiss are good choices.</p>"

Volcarona also has access to Flame Body, which can burn physical attackers, and Swarm, which can boost its already powerful Bug Buzz. It also has access to both Rage Powder and Quiver Dance. However, Volcarona has a massive 4x weakness to Rock, which is one of the most common attacking types in Battle Spot Doubles, as well as painful weaknesses to Water and Flying. One last negative factor about Volcarona is that it can't really do much outside of its STAB attacks and support moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran, but other than that it doesn't have many uses. Giga Drain hits bulkier Water-types such as Rotom-W, Gastrodon, Suicune, and Swampert. Just note that Giga Drain doesn't have much extra power over Bug Buzz and will leave Volcarona wide open for Hydreigon to come in and steadily eliminate it. Hurricane is a choice if Volcarona has Politoed support, but there are usually better options such as Tornadus-T for power or Amoonguss for redirection. Tailwind is an option to boost the speed of Volcarona and its teammates for four turns.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock Slide: Volcarona is maimed by even the weakest of Rock Slides if it lacks a Charti Berry. Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tyranitar all make for effective Rock Slide users versus Volcarona</p> <p><strong>Other Super Effective Attacks: For how many resistances Volcarona's unique typing grants it, it has a whole host of exploitable weaknesses.

Bug Buzz prevents Volcarona from being walled by Garchomp, Cresselia, Hydreigon, and other Pokemon that resist Fire. Quiver Dance boosts Volcarona's Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed, allowing it to outspeed certain threats such as Garchomp, Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and positive-natured base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan. Protect lets Volcarona's partner either soften up a threat for Volcarona to finish off the next turn or eliminate the threat entirely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Due to Volcarona's base 100 Speed, it needs maximum Speed investment to be able to tie with other base 100s such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard. The EV spread is not complicated because Volcarona thrives off as much Speed and attacking power as it can get. Charti Berry lets Volcarona take a Rock Slide from Landorus-T or 4 Atk Timid Tyranitar without a Life Orb. Lum Berry prevents paralysis or sleep. Flame Body can be useful in the highly physical metagame by burning contact attackers such as Kangaskhan. Swarm's niche makes the damage output of Bug Buzz go through the roof when Volcarona is at low health. Modest nature maximizes Heat Wave and Bug Buzz damage, as Volcarona can boost its Speed with Quiver Dance.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Volcarona, you need to be very aware of whether or not the foe carries Rock Slide. If you need to use Protect to scout, then do so. If you think your opponent has a Rock Slide user in the back, setting up with Quiver Dance is usually not an option unless you think Volcarona and its partner can eliminate the threat before the threat eliminates it. Volcarona can be very effective against teams with a lot of special attackers, as Quiver Dance boosts its Special Defense. The same can be said for teams with redirection, as Heat Wave hits both targets anyway.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hitmontop should be considered, as it's the only Pokemon with all of Wide Guard, Fake Out, and Intimidate. Other Intimidate user such as Landorus-T or Salamence increase Volcarona's chances of taking physical attacks. Pokemon that resist Flying and Rock, such as Bisharp, Metagross, Tyranitar, and Rotom-W, also make for good partners; Rotom-W is an especially good partner because it makes great use of Will-O-Wisp to hinder physical attackers. Speed control users such as Thundurus and Cresselia take stress off of the player to set up Quiver Dance. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan provide more windows to set up Quiver Dances, and Volcarona appreciates having a physically attacking partner.

Protect allows Volcarona's partner to eliminate threats so that Volcarona can stick around longer.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs allow Volcarona to survive a multitude of attacks, including Adamant Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Adamant Landorus-T's Rock Slide, +2 Modest Aegislash's Shadow Ball, Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, and Bisharp's Sucker Punch; it also has over an 80% chance of surviving Life Orb Garchomp's Rock Slide. This set can also assure that Overheat OHKOs standard Mega Mawile, has a 50% chance of OHKOing standard Amoonguss, and can 2HKO standard Aegislash. Flame Body is the only option on this set because the increased power of Bug Buzz isn't worth giving up the chance to burn physical attackers. Rocky Helmet to damages contact physical attackers. Sitrus Berry can be used instead for greater longevity.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because of how this Volcarona is meant to play out, knowing what it can and can't survive is a crucial aspect of supporting its partner. Before you make use of Rage Powder, stop and think about what you gain and lose by taking two hits that turn. Although it's not the best tactic, you can bluff an offensive set by using Bug Buzz and luring your opponent into targeting Volcarona's partner and then pulling the trigger with Rage Powder.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set can support a lot of frail Pokemon such as Breloom, Greninja, Weavile, or Mega Gallade. Rage Powder and Volcarona's passable bulk synergize decently with Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Salamence, which like Volcarona's sponging of Fighting- and Ice-type moves aimed at them, respectively.</p>"

Terrakion has one of the best offensive typings in the game, which is backed up by a solid Attack stat and an impeccable Speed tier. It also has a variety of moves to support its team, such as Quick Guard and Taunt, really making this Pokemon an all-round good team player. It has the ability to check a large amount of Pokemon common, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Heatran, and Bisharp, and causes troubles for your opponents, as its item of choice is extremely versatile and hard to predict. However, Terrakion has a fairly bad defensive typing and is highly affected by Intimidate and burns, as they can cripple Terrakion. Terrakion also suffers versus some Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Cresselia, and Sylveon. It's also very weak to speed control such as Trick Room and Tailwind, as it relies on its Speed stat very often and doesn't have a solid priority attack to hit through the speed control, which is very unfortunate.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stone Edge can be used over or alongside Rock Slide in order to get around Wide Guard and deal greater overall damage. Sacred Sword is an option to run over Close Combat to avoid lowering Terrakion's defenses, but the drop in power is noticable. Earthquake is an option to use so Terrakion isn't completely walled by Aegislash. Double Kick is a niche move to KO some Pokemon at low health through Substitute and to break Focus Sashes. It's useful against threats such as Focus Sash Smeargle and Focus Sash Bisharp, which might threaten Terrakion with a Dark Void or Iron Head respectively. Swords Dance is a good move to boost Terrakion's stats to make it hit harder but should only be used when you have support such as Follow Me and Rage Powder to help Terrakion set up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Intimidate and Burns: Terrakion is very vulnerable to Intimidate and burns, which cripple its Attack stat, meaning it can lose its ability to hit hard.</p> <p><strong>Typing Advantage</strong>: Pokemon that can outspeed and threaten Terrakion due to a type advantage are solid checks to it, as they could possibly be carrying a move that can OHKO Terrakion. Azumarill, Greninja, and Swift Swim Pokemon in rain can all achieve this.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control: Terrakion relies on its Speed stat pretty often, so any form of speed control such as Thunder Wave, Icy Wind, Tailwind, or Trick Room definitely threatens it.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T</strong>: Landorus-T can switch in on any of Terrakion's attacks and threaten it with a super effective Earthquake or Superpower.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Terrakion has one of the best, if not the best, offensive typings in the game, and the main aim of its moveset is to use that typing to its full advantage. Close Combat is the Fighting-type STAB attack Terrakion will use, and its huge 120 Base Power backed up by Terrakion's base 129 Attack stat means it can deal large amounts of damage to foes that don't resist it. Rock Slide is a great STAB spread move that also has a handy 30% chance to cause each of the opposing Pokemon to flinch. Quick Guard allows Terrakion to support the rest of the team and itself by blocking priority moves including Fake Out if Terrakion is faster than the Fake Out user. Taunt has the ability to help Terrakion deal with speed control such as Trick Room and Tailwind, which would typically trouble it. Protect is used for scouting or blocking attacks and is one of the best moves in doubles.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature is typically the better nature on this Terrakion set, as it makes the most out of Terrakion's Speed stat and allows Quick Guard to block more Fake Outs than Terrakion could with Adamant, such as Mienshao and Jolly Mega Kangaskhan. The EV spread allows Terrakion to make the most out of its best attacks and hit fast and hard. Focus Sash is a good item for Terrakion, as it allows Terrakion to always survive one attack, which could allow it to stay around on the battlefield for more than that one turn. Life Orb is another option to let Terrakion deal more damage then it would with Focus Sash. Lum Berry can help with burns, paralysis and sleep. It also makes Swagger + Lum Berry a potential combination. Because the third moveslot is flexible, Substitute is another option to run to help Terrakion stay on the battlefield even longer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because Terrakion commonly can't switch in to many attacks, try to avoid bringing in Terrakion on Pokemon that may have a super effective move against it. This is also so you don't potentially break Terrakion's Focus Sash, which will allow Terrakion to stay around longer. Terrakion is a Pokemon that hits hard and is very good at doing it. This means it's typically a good idea to bring Terrakion to a battle where it can threaten a lot of the opposing Pokemon or deal a good amount of damage to the majority of the opponent's team. However, due to the fact that Terrakion can be stopped by various forms of speed control, it is typically not a good idea to bring Terrakion into a battle if your opponent is using strategies such as Trick Room or Tailwind offense.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon with Defiant or Competitive such as Bisharp and Milotic are good partners for Terrakion, as they can prevent Intimidate users from switching in, which is helpful because Intimidate greatly affects Terrakion's damage output and use on the field. Terrakion can also benefit from its own speed control to help versus other forms of speed control, which is what makes Togekiss such a good partner. Not only can Togekiss learn Tailwind, but it also is a Flying-type and can help with Terrakion's Ground weakness and can use Follow Me to redirect Fighting-type moves which would typically be aimed at Terrakion. Thundurus is also a good partner for Terrakion, as it can Thunder Wave threats to weaken them or use Taunt to prevent Trick Room and Tailwind. Lastly, Whimsicott is able to use Tailwind and Encore to benefit Terrakion; it also has access to Beat Up, which can be used to give Terrakion a +4 Attack boost from Justified.</p>"

Rock Slide has the ability to hit many Pokemon that resist Close Combat for super effective damage. Rock Slide also has a nice 30% flinch chance, which can create free turns for the rest of your team or even swing momentum in your favor in tough situations. X-Scissor has the ability to hit Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Latios for super effective damage, which is helpful because they threaten Terrakion. Iron Head is the final move to help deal with Fairy-types, mainly Sylveon, and also has a 30% flinch chance.

The only reason to run Jolly is if you are scared of these foes outspeeding Terrakion otherwise, Adamant is the way to go to ensure maximum damage output. 252 Atk / 252 Spe give Terrakion its maximum Speed and maximum damage output.

Choice Band is the other Choice item you'd want to use to allow Terrakion to hit extremely hard.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Terrakion does not like having to switch into attacks due to its offensive nature. It's a better option to not switch Terrakion into an attack unless it's 100% safe or you have no other option. Speed control still has a great effect on Terrakion, and now that Terrakion is locked into an item, it will be affected even more greatly.

Virizion's fantastic Special Defense lets it take on many special attackers without any investment, the Water-types primarily. Being a Grass-type, Virizion is immune to Rage Powder, allowing it to ignore Amoonguss's redirection, which can be useful. While it's not the primary reason for Virizion's usage, Virizion can provide decent support in Quick Guard and Taunt. Quick Guard can shut down the many priority-centered Pokemon of the Battle Spot Doubles format, such as Thundurus, whereas Taunt can cripple support Pokemon, such as Clefable, as well as Aegislash, which is reliant on King's Shield.</p> <p>The main limiting factor to Virizion's success is its mediocre attacking stats; both its Attack and Special Attack sit at base 90, which means that Virizion is reliant on its Life Orb in order to deal consistent damage. Virizion is weak to many common offensive Fire-, Ice-, Flying-, and Fairy-types primarily. This is only compounded by Virizion's poor coverage, STAB or otherwise, leaving Virizion no way to hit common Pokemon such as Aegislash, Gengar, Mega Salamence, and Amoonguss. These two factor combine to make Virizion very easy to check, even unintentionally.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt is a decent support move that importantly shuts down Aegislash among others. Lum Berry and Occa Berry are two other potential items that Virizion can run. Lum Berry cures Virizion's status ailments, making it less weak to burns and paralysis. Occa Berry weakens the effective of Fire-type moves, letting Virizion attack more freely without risking being OHKOed by Fire-type moves. However, both items lower Virizion's damage output to where it can't OHKO Mega Kangaskhan. A special set could be used to avoid burns and Intimidate, but it would rely on the unreliable Focus Blast for Fighting-type coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Poison-types: Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Gengar all counter Virizion. Mega Venusaur can 2HKO it with Sludge Bomb, while Virizion can't do anything to it. Amoonguss can take any hit from Virizion, and it will win one on one. Gengar can burn Virizion with Will-O-Wisp or 2HKO it with Sludge Bomb, and Gengar is immune to Close Combat and resists Leaf Blade.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Mega Salamence and Talonflame can both OHKO Virizion with their respective Flying-type STAB moves. Talonflame might want to use Flare Blitz to avoid risking Quick Guard, which blocks Brave Bird. Mega Charizard can OHKO Virizion with its Fire-type STAB moves; however, Charizard must beware Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Type Advantage: Aegislash and Latios are immune to or resist both Virizion's STAB types. Latios can OHKO it with Psyshock, and Aegislash can take any hit comfortably, as it is immune to Close Combat and resists Leaf Blade, and it is able to 2HKO with little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Many Fairy-types are able to OHKO Virizion with their STAB moves. Sylveon and Mega Gardevoir can both OHKO it with Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice and take any move. Togekiss can OHKO Virizion with Air Slash and resists Virizion's dual STAB. Mega Mawile has Intimidate, which weakens Virizion's attacks, and can OHKO it with Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Status: Virizion is completely reliant on it Attack and its Speed, so either burning or paralyzing it can make dead weight, provided there is sufficient offensive pressure.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Virizion is reliant on its Attack stat to remain unaltered to pick up the OHKO on Mega Kangaskhan. The Attack drop can be reset by switching out, so this shouldn't be your only check to Virizion.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Close Combat is Virizion's main damage output and can OHKO Mega Kangaskhan and most Steel- and Rock-types. Close Combat, being a powerful move, will deal decent damage even to neutral targets. Leaf Blade is Virizion's secondary STAB move and will deal super effective damage to Water-types, considerably denting, if not OHKOing most of them. The third slot is reserved for either Stone Edge or Quick Guard. Stone Edge lets Virizion take on Flying-types, such as Mega Charizard Y and Thundurus, patching up its mediocre coverage; however, it only has 80% accuracy and is somewhat unreliable. Quick Guard blocks all priority moves, most importantly slower Fake Outs and Talonflame's Brave Bird. Quick Guard lets Virizion provide useful team support that it otherwise lacks. Protect blocks all attacks, allowing Virizion's partner to take down a threat for Virizion.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature works fine, as Virizion is primarily trying to deal damage quickly. Life Orb ensures that Virizion can pick up the OHKO on Mega Kangaskhan with Close Combat. Justified boosts Virizion's Attack by one stage when hit by a Dark-type move; this ability is highly situational, but it can be useful.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With Quick Guard and Virizion's high Speed, it can block most Fake Outs, which makes it a good lead. By being able to stop the use of Fake Out, Virizion allows its partner to get off an attack that it otherwise wouldn't be able to. This can create a lot of momentum on turn one. Because Virizion is specific in what it checks, being Mega Kangaskhan, priority users, and Water-types, it is important to play with it conservatively until these goals have been achieved. This is to ensure that it isn't a wasted Pokemon. Being reasonably fast and strong, Virizion can clean up games with some support; Tailwind is particularly useful.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran is capable of beating a lot of the Pokemon that Virizion can not touch, primarily Aegislash and Amoonguss. On top of that, Heatran's ability, Flash Fire, deters the use of Heat Wave and Fire-type moves in general. Suicune can set up Tailwind for Virizion, and Tailwind makes Virizion faster than the entire unboosted metagame and faster than many Pokemon with boosted Speed. Suicune's Water typing lets it take on the Fire-types that threaten Virizion. Virizion, Heatran, and Suicune make a decent Fire / Water / Grass core together. Psychic-types, such as Latios and Mega Metagross, beat the Poison-types that threaten Virizion. Latios is also able to set up Tailwind for Virizion, and Mega Metagross threatens the Fairy-types that aim to check Virizion.</p>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus is one of the biggest threats in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame, mainly because of its incredible Prankster Thunder Wave. It is also backed up by a very good Speed tier and high Special Attack, which gives it the freedom to invest more in bulk. Thundurus is very easy to fit into teams and does not require much team support to function properly. Another great thing about Thundurus is that it is a great check to Mega Salamence, one of the best Mega Evolutions in the metagame; Thundurus resists its Flying-type STAB moves and can hit it hard back with Hidden Power Ice, which OHKOes or 2HKOes depending on the Thundurus set. 79 / 70 / 80 bulk isn't very good, though, so unless Thundurus has significant bulk investment, it won't survive too many hits. Thundurus also has a big issue with being weak to Ice and Rock, which are common attacking types in Battle Spot Doubles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Focus Blast and Superpower are possible choices on Thundurus, as they offer a way to more easily beat Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Heatran. If you want Dark-type coverage, Dark Pulse and Knock Off are viable. Knock Off is also good for its utility. Sky Drop is one of the rare Flying-type STAB moves Thundurus gets and is also solid for giving Thundurus's teammates a favorable 1v1 matchup. For supportive Thundurus, Rocky Helmet can be good for punishing physical attackers, especially if they use Fake Out. Nasty Plot is an unexpected move, but it can make Thundurus the biggest threat on the field, so your opponent will likely shift their focus to taking it out quickly. Substitute can be combined with Nasty Plot, as it gives Thundurus the freedom to use Nasty Plot without fearing taking too much damage. Thundurus is an unexpected Rain Dance setter; if you combine it with a Pokemon that can work well outside of rain as well, such as Swampert, your opponent will probably not see it coming. Thunder pairs well with Rain Dance, as Thunder never misses under rain. Rest combined with Chesto Berry gives Thundurus instant recovery to full health and removes status, and the strategy can sometimes work out quite well. Foul Play is a niche option that lets Thundurus punish physical attackers such as Metagross, especially if they have set up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Offensive Type Advantage: As Thundurus does not have amazing bulk, it gets hit very hard by super effective moves. Moves such as Ice Beam and Rock Slide are particularly good for beating Thundurus.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Type Advantage</strong>: Electric-types resist Thunderbolt and don't care about Thunder Wave. Rotom-H is a particularly good Thundurus answer, as it also resists Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Terrakion: Terrakion checks Thundurus nicely, as it has STAB Rock Slide to hit it with and often carries Lum Berry to ignore Thunder Wave. It can even run Taunt or Quick Guard, which helps shut down Thundurus's status moves.</p> <p><strong>Stopping Its Status Moves</strong>: Preventing Thundurus from using status attacks is key to beating supportive Thundurus. Foes can do this by using Taunt or Quick Guard. Lightning Rod stops it from using Thunder Wave, which is what Thundurus will most often be using.</p> <p><strong>Excadrill</strong>: Excadrill is immune to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave and is hit neutrally by Hidden Power Ice. It can then proceed to hit Thundurus back hard with Rock Slide.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is particularly helpful to hit bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic. Hidden Power Ice deals 4x super effective damage to Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence. Thunder Wave provides speed control and also a chance of rendering an opposing Pokemon useless for a turn. Taunt allows Thundurus to shut down support Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Trick Room and Tailwind users such as Cresselia and Zapdos, respectively. Swagger provides the possibility of letting the foe waste a turn and deal a lot of damage to themselves. It is most commonly used against special attackers, as physical attackers will have a scary boost when they have snapped out of confusion. Swagger is not as common as Taunt, as Thundurus ends up relying completely on luck.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Sitrus Berry provides one-time instant recovery, which is useful to improve Thundurus's longevity. Leftovers gives Thundurus small amounts of recovery over the whole battle, but it's not as good as Sitrus Berry because Thundurus won't be on the field for too long. 252 HP EVs maximize Thundurus's overall bulk. 120 Defense EVs is the cutoff point where investing more to take less damage from Landorus-T's and Terrakion's Rock Slide requires a reasonably large number of EVs. 68 EVs in Special Defense let Thundurus survive positive-natured Life Orb Hydreigon's Draco Meteor. 28 Speed EVs let Thundurus outrun base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Breloom with a positive Speed nature. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack so Thundurus can maintain as high of a damage output as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using support Thundurus mainly involves spreading Thunder Wave. It is very useful for slowing down Pokemon that rely on their great Speed, such as Mega Kangaskhan and Gengar. Thundurus's teammate can then outspeed those threats the following turn. For example, a teammate that is usually threatened by Mega Kangaskhan can outspeed it if Mega Kangaskhan has been paralyzed, and Thundurus and its teammate can then knock out Mega Kangaskhan the following turn before it gets to do anything. Thundurus's other great asset is its priority Taunt, leaving foes with no chance of landing a status attack. However, people often see an obvious Taunt play on Pokemon such as Amoonguss and will play accordingly by either going for damaging moves or switching Pokemon. Don't let Thundurus take too much damage, especially from Rock Slide, which hits Thundurus for super effective damage and is one of the most common moves in Battle Spot Doubles. Try to switch to a teammate that has a better matchup against the Rock Slide user or just knock it out before it deals too much damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Swampert are nice teammates for Thundurus, as they block Rock Slide. Because Thundurus is weak to Ice- and Rock-type attacks, bulky Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mega Mawile make for good partners. Physical attackers make for good teammates, not fearing Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave because of Thundurus's Prankster Taunt. Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Scrafty are helpful for Thundurus, letting it use Thunder Wave and Taunt more freely. One Pokemon that is particularly good paired up with Thundurus is Landorus-T. Landorus-T can go for Earthquake without worrying about its partner, and Thundurus helps by knocking out bulky Water-types with Thunderbolt. Pokemon that have a base Speed stat of 100 or below appreciate the Thunder Wave support that Thundurus brings, as they can often be threatened by faster Pokemon but beat them if they outrun them. If Thundurus runs Swagger, a physical attacker holding a Lum Berry can become really threatening if Swagger lets it get an Attack boost.</p>"

Psychic provides coverage against Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur and Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Conkeldurr. Grass Knot hits Ground-types, namely Swampert, Gastrodon, and Rhyperior. Protect lets Thundurus avoid unnecessary hits and double targeting, which is useful because it's very frail.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb maximizes Thundurus's damage output, as you want it to dish out as much damage as possible with this set, and the recoil doesn't matter because Thundurus won't survive many hits anyways. A Timid nature and maximum Speed investment let Thundurus outspeed the crowded base 110 Speed tier. Full investment in Special Attack lets Thundurus hit as hard as possible, notably allowing it to always OHKO non-bulky variants of Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Garchomp with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When this Thundurus set enters the field, you have two options as to how you want to play it. The first option is to go for what you would expect from Thundurus, which would in most cases be Thunder Wave. Your opponent will then assume that you are running a support Thundurus; the fact that Thundurus won't take Life Orb recoil from using Thunder Wave also contributes to the bluff. The longer you hide that Thundurus is an offensive variant, the more your opponent will incorrectly assume that their Pokemon will survive a Thunderbolt. The second option is to attack immediately; just go for dealing damage, as this Thundurus hits anything hard with either Thunderbolt or a coverage move. There are almost no players who will manage to look at your team and predict that you are running an offensive Thundurus, so you will definitely catch your opponent off-guard. Grass Knot and Psychic are very team-specific, so don't slap Grass Knot on Thundurus if your team already has a Grass-type. Those two moves are also almost never expected by anyone, so you don't really need to worry about your opponent switching out of an incoming Psychic if you haven't revealed it yet, as they won't see it coming.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wide Guard users such as Aegislash and Swampert are teammates for with Thundurus, as they block Rock Slide.

Landorus-T can go for Earthquake without worrying about its partner, and Thundurus helps by knocking out bulky Water-types with Thunderbolt. Pokemon that have a base Speed stat of 100 or below appreciate the Thunder Wave support Thundurus brings, as they can often be threatened by faster Pokemon but beat them if they outrun them. Mega Blaziken is a very good partner for Thundurus too, as they beat many of each other's checks. Blaziken beats Rock- and Ice-types, and Thundurus beats Water- and Flying-types.</p>"

His useful typing and ability leave him with two immunities, five resistances, and only two weaknesses, which helps him switch into commonly seen moves such as Earthquake and Thunder Wave. Thundurus-T is mostly outclassed by Thundurus due to the latter's access to Prankster, and he also faces big competition from Zapdos. Thundurus-T is also pretty frail, so he won't be taking many hits.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Discharge can be used for a multi-target STAB attack, but it is significantly weaker than Thunderbolt and Thunder. If you are using it, however, pair up Thundurus-T with a Ground-type Pokemon or a Pokemon with Lightning Rod, Motor Drive, or Volt Absorb. Hidden Power Flying was a decent choice in previous years, but the change to the way Thundurus-T can be legally obtained with it forces him to use a Speed IV of 30, making it a really poor option compared to Hidden Power Ice or some other coverage move such as Psychic. A Life Orb increases Thundurus-T's damage output by 30% and doesn't lock him into one move. However, Thundurus-T gets quickly worn down by its recoil. Thundurus-T has a few useful physical attacks such as Knock Off and Superpower, but it's best to keep him firing off special attacks. Nasty Plot can be used to boost Thundurus-T's Special Attack to outstanding levels.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Typing Advantage</strong>: As Thundurus-T is Choice-locked, Pokemon that can take advantage of the move that he is locked into are troublesome. Ground-types such as Garchomp, Excadrill, and Landorus-T are immune to Thundurus-T's Electric-type attacks. Though he's not allergic to Rock Slide like Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame are, Thundurus-T cannot stomach repeated Rock Slides. The most common Rock Slide users, namely Tyranitar, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, are to be feared, but they have to be wary of Thundurus-T's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Double Targeting: Because Thundurus-T is usually using a Choice item, it is usually safe for the opponent to double target Thundurus-T and quickly KO him.</p> <p><strong>Speed Control</strong>: Thundurus-T is much easier to deal with once the opponent's team is faster than him.

It is incredibly powerful and perfectly accurate in the rain, packing a nifty 30% chance to paralyze its target. Hidden Power Ice forms pseudo-BoltBeam coverage with Thundurus-T's Electric-type attack. Psychic hits Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, both of which are a pain to Thundurus-T. Volt Switch lets Thundurus-T dent a foe and switch out, as well as scout. Focus Blast hits Steel-types such as Heatran, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn, while Grass Knot hits Pokemon such as Mega Swampert and Gastrodon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>20 HP EVs ensure that Thundurus-T will avoid the OHKO from Jolly Tyranitar's Rock Slide and Sylveon's Choice Specs-boosted Hyper Voice. 252 Speed EVs make Thundurus-T as fast as possible, letting him outspeed neutral-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Charizard and its Mega Evolutions, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Gardevoir. The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack to let Thundurus-T hit as hard as possible. A Modest nature is used for extra power, but a Timid nature can be used for extra Speed; it lets Thundurus-T outspeed positive-natured base 100 Speed Pokemon. If you decide to use a Choice Scarf instead of Choice Specs, an EV spread of 20 HP / 252 SpA / 236 Spe with a Modest nature should be used to let Thundurus-T outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Hydreigon. A Timid nature is plausible, too, as it lets Thundurus-T outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Hydreigon at the cost of some power. The provided IVs give Thundurus-T Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lead with Thundurus-T and use him as an early-game scout with Volt Switch. When you send out Thundurus-T, if you predict a Fake Out, don't hesitate to switch out into a Pokemon that can tank the hit. Use Thundurus-T as a late-game cleaner once his checks and counters have been removed. Predict switch-ins; if you predict a Garchomp or Landorus-T to come in, use Hidden Power Ice. Use moves appropriately; a neutral Thunderbolt or Thunder does more damage than a 2x super effective Hidden Power Ice, a 2x resisted Thunderbolt or Thunder does more than a neutral Hidden Power Ice, and so on and so forth. Even though it is super effective, don't use Grass Knot against Rotom-W, as it is very light; instead, use Thunderbolt or Thunder.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>If Thundurus-T is being used on a rain team, Politoed is a must-have partner because of its ability Drizzle. Thanks to Thundurus-T's ability to quickly dispose of Landorus-T, physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Terrakion, and Talonflame are good partners. Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame can remove bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss, which Thundurus-T has trouble with. This does, however, stack up a weakness to Rock-type attacks such as Rock Slide. Wide Guard support from Pokemon such as Aegislash protects Thundurus-T and his teammates from this move, as well as other common attacks such as Hyper Voice and Heat Wave. As Thundurus-T makes a good early-game scout, pairing him with Fake Out users such as Mega Kangaskhan and Ludicolo is helpful. They shield Thundurus-T from damage for a turn and let him scout with Volt Switch more easily. Landorus-T provides Intimidate support and can freely spam Earthquake thanks to Thundurus-T's Flying typing. Other Ground-types such as Garchomp and Mamoswine work well alongside Thundurus-T, too. Helping Hand users power up Thundurus-T's attacks to monstrous levels. Politoed and Cresselia make for solid users. Thundurus-T's base 101 Speed isn't bad at all, but it falls short of outspeeding some notable Pokemon such as Gengar and Garchomp. Speed control from Pokemon such as Politoed and Suicune is therefore appreciated.</p>"

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lum and Yache Berries keep Landorus-T from being burned or OHKOed by Ice Beam; however, without proper investment, STAB Ice Beams will still OHKO through Yache. Rock Tomb isn't a spread move and is obviously weaker than Stone Edge, but offers the utility of speed control. Explosion should probably be used on a Choice Band set, which allows Landorus-T to sacrifice itself in the interest of getting a frail threat such as Gardevoir or non-Mega-Evolved Salamence in for free while doing massive damage, though making yourself faint can backfire very easily in a metagame crawling with Protect. Substitute is interesting for a Landorus-T that likes to stay in as opposed to bouncing around for Intimidate spam, though it is less useful in a day and age when Kangaskhan and Sylveon can simply ignore or break through these Substitutes with ease. Earth Plate powers up Earthquake without forcing Landorus-T to lock itself into a move or sacrificing bulk, though the usefulness of this is limited to improving matchups against team-specific threats.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves/Pokemon: Mamoswine and Abomasnow make very short work of Landorus-T, and bulkier Ice Beam users such as Suicune and Cresselia can OHKO it or deal huge damage, while Landorus-T does little to no damage in return with its main means of offense, Earthquake and Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: The combination of Politoed, Ludicolo, and Kingdra gives Landorus-T a very hard time, as it can't outspeed Swift Swim users even with a Choice Scarf and each can threaten a KO with a Water-type move or Ice Beam. Rotom-W can OHKO with Hydro Pump and is immune to Earthquake. Milotic feeds off Landorus-T's Intimidate with Competitive, threatens to KO even without a boost, and is bulky enough to take multiple Earthquakes. In a similar vein to Competitive Milotic, Bisharp feeds off Intimidate with Defiant, but can't reliably OHKO Landorus-T with Sucker Punch and is OHKOed in return by Earthquake. Gyarados and Swampert inhibit Landorus-T's damage output with Intimidate and Wide Guard, respectively, and can OHKO with a STAB move at +0 or with an Ice move at -1.</p> <p><strong>Burn/Intimidate: As with anything that uses its Attack stat, Intimidating Landorus-T or burning it can quickly reduce its damage output. Sableye, Gengar, and Rotom-W can somewhat reliably burn Landorus-T with Will-O-Wisp thanks to Prankster or Levitate. Scrafty, Hitmontop, and Gyarados are top picks to Intimidate Landorus-T, as they resist or are immune to most of Landorus-T's offensive options and can Fake Out to neutralize it for a turn or KO it directly.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake and Rock Slide are Landorus-T's main forms of offense, as spread damage coming off a base 145 Attack is very useful. U-turn helps Landorus-T bounce out to allow safe switches or just to get damage off while ensuring another Intimidate. The last slot is mainly for coverage purposes. Choice Band-boosted Superpower KOes Kangaskhan, though Choice Scarf Landorus-T can't always OHKO. Stone Edge ignores Wide Guard and fares better against bulky Mega Charizard Y with Intimidate support. Knock Off scouts items, though outside of that, Dark is just a solid type to lock yourself into.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf lets Landorus-T outspeed the majority of the metagame and spam Earthquake and Rock Slide, while Choice Band is used for the sheer power of a STAB, Choice Band-boosted Earthquake. Adamant is used because Jolly doesn't outspeed anything important and offers less power. Choice Scarf Landorus-T prefers to have its Attack and Speed maxed, but Choice Band can afford to go for a bulkier EV spread to survive weaker Ice Beams and Hydro Pumps from Pokemon such as defensive Rotom-W and Politoed. Choice Band can even use a Careful nature to make it even bulkier and closer to a bulky pivot than a Choice Band user. Bulkier EV spreads should aim for outspeeding Adamant Bisharp (92 Spe) or Jolly Smeargle (228 Spe).</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When using Choiced Landorus-T, don't be shy about switching constantly to abuse Intimidate and switch moves. U-turn helps wear down foes, doing so especially well with Choice Band, so use that to switch out if Landorus-T is not immediately threatened. Otherwise, throw out Earthquakes and Rock Slide and maybe use its coverage move every now and then.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Anything immune to Landorus-T's Earthquake makes a good partner. Thundurus and Cresselia help Choice Band Landorus-T outspeed opposing Pokemon and/or nab some KOs, while Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H can throw out their STAB moves alongside Landorus-T to beat down the opponent with constant spread moves. Another Intimidate user such as Scrafty or Gyarados also works well (except when you're faced with Bisharp or Milotic), as you can switch them out, use U-turn with Landorus-T, and switch them back in to put your opponent at -3 Attack in one turn. You can refresh Scrafty's Fake Out this way as well. Be wary of doing this when the opponent has Bisharp, as Defiant can take advantage of Intimidate and turn an Attack drop into a boost. Other than that, just about everything can Protect against Earthquakes and enjoys Intimidate support.</p>"

Earthquake and Rock Slide are Landorus-T's main attacks, U-turn is for safe switches and Intimidate spamming, and Superpower and Knock Off are coverage moves against threats such as Cresselia and Kangaskhan.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>If you find Landorus-T being Choice-locked into Earthquake or forced to go for Rock Slide in order to not KO its partner late-game more often than you'd like, then this is the set for you. Max Speed and Attack investment is necessary for Life Orb and Focus Sash because defensive investment would be wasted with the two items, but for Assault Vest, Landorus-T would much prefer an EV spread such as 164 HP / 172 Atk / 4 Def / 76 SpD / 92 Spe to make it a better offensive pivot and bulkier in general. A Careful nature could work with Assault Vest, too, allowing Landorus-T to survive attacks such as Modest Suicune's Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Just spam Earthquake with a partner Flying-type or Levitate user, and U-turn or switch out to refresh Intimidate. However, Focus Sash Landorus-T might want to just stay in and attack more than the other items, as any damage at all will render its item useless.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T appreciates speed control. Thundurus and Cresselia are your number one picks for this job. Mega Charizard Y, Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Hydreigon are good offensive partners as well. Mega Charizard Y deserves a special mention, as Drought combats Politoed and Landorus-T's Intimidate allows Charizard to survive Rock Slides much more easily. Outside of that, anything with Protect, which is the vast majority of the metagame, and anything that enjoys Intimidate support likes having Landorus-T as a partner.</p>"

  "Talonflame": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite Talonflame's subpar stats, defensive typing, and somewhat shallow movepool, its priority Brave Bird allows it to check problematic Pokemon such as Amoonguss, attack unabated under Trick Room, and revenge kill weakened Pokemon, making it extremely good in the Battle Spot Doubles metagame. The fact that it also has access to good support options such as Tailwind makes it one of the best Pokemon in Battle Spot Doubles, with its only pitfalls being its bad defenses and weaknesses to common attacks such as Rock Slide.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sharp Beak doesn't add to Brave Bird's recoil like Life Orb does, though it doesn't boost Talonflame's Fire-type STAB moves and offers a weaker boost than Life Orb. Focus Sash allows Talonflame to have some semblance of bulk akin to a bulkier utility set, though Brave Bird recoil renders Focus Sash useless. Giga Impact and Return are good filler options on a Choice Band set, allowing Talonflame to hit Rotom-H and Rotom-W harder in situations where Talonflame needs to attack Rotom. Me First, Steel Wing, and Aerial Ace are other situational filler options, each with their merits, and Choice Band Talonflame will rarely use its fourth moveslot, so they can be considered. Swords Dance and Roost are good moves, but not on Talonflame simply because of its frailty.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Protect and Defensive Teams: Because of Gale Wings, it is exceedingly difficult to stop Talonflame from attacking, bar Quick Guard and Fake Out. With this in mind, frailer teams will naturally have a harder time with Talonflame, so adjusting EVs to account for its Brave Bird is incredibly useful to score a KO on it when it least expects it. Similarly, predicting Brave Bird's target, using Protect, and attacking with another Pokemon is much more effective against Talonflame than other Pokemon because of how frail it is.</p> <p><strong>Intimidate</strong>: Intimidate is an incredibly easy way to neuter Talonflame, given that most of its power stems from boosting items such as Choice Band, which Intimidate users nullify just by switching in. Gyarados, Mega Manectric, and Landorus-T are some good Intimidate users to consider, and even Scrafty and Hitmontop could work despite being weak to Brave Bird, though they should probably switch out before they take a super effective Brave Bird unless they also pack Quick Guard or Fake Out.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide and Stone Edge: Another general option to keep your team protected from Talonflame is to give a few bulkier members Rock Slide or Stone Edge. Because of their wide distribution, it's not too difficult to find a team member to use one or the other, and Attack investment usually isn't necessary to KO Talonflame, as it does a good job of whittling down its own HP. The most common and useful Rock Slide users are Terrakion, Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Garchomp, all of which have other roles they can fill on just about every team.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Rotom-H and Rotom-W are by far the most threatening Pokemon to Talonflame because of their resistance to both of its STAB moves and their own STAB Thunderbolt easily taking down Talonflame. Other Electric-types make great switch-ins to Brave Bird, such as Thundurus, Zapdos, Raikou, and Mega Manectric, though they don't resist Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: While many Water-types don't resist Brave Bird, they can still throw a Scald or Hydro Pump Talonflame's way and easily KO it. Besides Rotom-W, good Water-types to consider are Gyarados, Politoed, Suicune, and Swampert.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird is the Flying-type STAB move of choice, as Talonflame's frailty means that the recoil hardly matters. Flare Blitz hits Steel-types super effectively and is also used for other Pokemon that resist Brave Bird, such as Thundurus. U-turn is mostly filler, though it is useful for getting extra damage off while Talonflame switches and for easing matchups with Shadow Tag users. The last slot is purely filler. Will-O-Wisp is a good move to be locked into against Pokemon such as Bisharp and Mega Mawile when Talonflame is in KO range for Sucker Punch, while Sleep Talk helps slightly against sleep-inducing Pokemon, especially Smeargle.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread is straightforward, giving Talonflame as much Speed and Attack as possible. Any defensive investment on offensive Talonflame is, for the most part, pointless, given Brave Bird's recoil and how weak Talonflame is when its Attack isn't maximized. Using Jolly over Adamant is only useful for outspeeding Mega Metagross and KOing it with Flare Blitz, so it's generally not recommended.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Lead with or switch Talonflame in very carefully, and keep it away from super effective attacks. Otherwise, spam Brave Bird or use its coverage options occasionally.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kangaskhan and Talonflame make a devastating lead combination against just about any team without multiple Intimidate users, given their ability to simply spam high Base Power attacks, with Kangaskhan being able to stop Rock Slide from being used with Fake Out, a Fighting-type move, or by simply double-targeting a threat. Ludicolo is a good partner for Talonflame as well, as it has access to Fake Out and helps ward off Rotom-W, while Talonflame is good in rain teams in general because it threatens Ferrothorn and Amoonguss, two main threats to rain teams. Amoonguss can redirect Hydro Pump and Thunderbolt with Rage Powder or threaten foes with Spore, keeping Talonflame safe. Earthquake users such as Landorus-T and Excadrill enjoy spamming Earthquake alongside Talonflame; the latter is also able to KO Rotom-H and Rotom-W with Earthquake thanks to Mold Breaker. Talonflame is also useful on Trick Room teams because of its ability to strike first regardless of whether or not Trick Room is active thanks to Gale Wings. Jellicent and Cresselia are two Trick Room users that Talonflame complements, as Talonflame threatens Amoonguss and Aegislash, which are two huge threats to Trick Room teams.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Brave Bird has priority thanks to Gale Wings and is a STAB move, and Flare Blitz hits most of what Brave Bird doesn't. Overheat eases predictions against Aegislash's King's Shield and isn't affected by Intimidate; the Special Attack debuff is irrelevant unless you need to use Overheat multiple times because of Brave Bird's recoil. The last two slots are utility options, so what works well there depends on the team's needs. Tailwind is a generally good move because of the speed control it offers, and Gale Wings giving it priority eases its setup. Taunt prevents the use of status moves such as Trick Room and Protect, which is quite useful. Will-O-Wisp cripples common physical attackers, such as Mega Kangaskhan. Quick Guard is a good move when leading with Talonflame to prevent the use of Fake Out, as well as other threatening priority moves such as Prankster status moves, Ice Shard, or even other Talonflame's Brave Bird. Protect allows Talonflame to stick around longer in the face of Rock Slide users, though sometimes it's best just to play smart with Talonflame due to its frailty.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>This set aims to give Talonflame more flexibility in its moves instead of being locked into Brave Bird, allowing it to utilize its good support movepool. Life Orb is used to provide the most power while not giving up flexibility, and while the recoil stacks with Brave Bird recoil, it doesn't make much of a difference because of Talonflame's fragility. If running Overheat, more Special Attack investment could be used to give it more power; if so, a Naive nature is worth considering so Talonflame can still outspeed Terrakion while keeping its Attack maximized, as in some cases, using Naive over Naughty will actually give Talonflame more Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Although Life Orb Talonflame has the option to use other moves more freely, Brave Bird is still Talonflame's best attack. Leading with this Talonflame to immediately start using its support options is a good idea; one should be very careful when switching Talonflame in, as it could easily be KOed due to a misprediction.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kangaskhan appreciates Tailwind support and a partner that can ward off Fighting-types, and Talonflame fits the bill perfectly. Amoonguss and Ludicolo help with Talonflame's Rotom-W (and Rotom-H in Ludicolo's case) weakness while helping Talonflame avoid dangerous attacks with Rage Powder and Fake Out, respectively. Fake Out coupled with Taunt Talonflame is also a good strategy for beating Trick Room teams. Landorus-T and Excadrill enjoy Tailwind and Talonflame's Ground immunity to spam Earthquake with ease.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp cripples common physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan and helps Talonflame survive unboosted Rock Slides. Tailwind is great speed control, allowing slow Pokemon such as Sylveon to outspeed and effectively negate bad matchups, such as a Sylveon against a Bisharp. Taunt stops other status moves, notably Thunder Wave and Trick Room, which can prevent Talonflame from setting up Tailwind. Quick Guard stops priority such as Bullet Punch and other Talonflame's Brave Birds, as well as Fake Out, which can be useful to pick up surprise turn 1 KOs.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The listed EV spread allows Talonflame to survive uninvested Rotom-W's Thunderbolt, non-STAB Thunderbolts from Pokemon such as Gengar, Adamant Tyranitar's Rock Slide (with a Charti Berry or after Tyranitar gets burned), and Jolly Mega Salamence's Return. It also lets Talonflame survive Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird and KO the opposing Talonflame in return. The Speed EVs allow Talonflame to outspeed base 110 Speed Pokemon, notably Mega Metagross. Charti Berry is insurance against Rock Slide, while Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers, notably Fake Out users and Mega Kangaskhan. More Speed investment can be used to outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Lucario or Choice Scarf Tyranitar, in which case points can be taken out of Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Talonflame should be used as a glue for a team; as such, it's not recommended to build around it. While the EVs make Talonflame less frail, they don't make it bulky. The point of this set is, essentially, to stick around longer than offensive Talonflame sets to use both Will-O-Wisp and Tailwind, as other sets often have to settle for using one or the other before fainting. This set, with a Rocky Helmet, also works well as a Mega Kangaskhan check for teams that find themselves a little weaker to it than they'd like, though one should bear in mind that this set does not counter Mega Kangaskhan.</p> <p>Leading with Talonflame is key to getting the most out of it. Use Tailwind or Will-O-Wisp and let Talonflame take a few neutral hits, and use Brave Bird after it has spread burns and/or set up Tailwind. If Talonflame KOes itself with Brave Bird, you effectively give yourself a free switch to frailer threats such as Mega Gardevoir to keep momentum going with Tailwind.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gardevoir, Sylveon, Excadrill, and Breloom all enjoy Tailwind support and appreciate having Mega Kangaskhan checked. Quick Guard also helps Mega Metagross, Choice Scarf users, and other Pokemon that aren't used as often solely because of the threat of opposing Talonflame's Brave Birds, such as Hariyama, Conkeldurr, and Breloom. Taunt is, as always, a key option against Trick Room, Spore, and Dark Void users, and Fake Out from Kangaskhan or Ludicolo helps immensely in preventing such strategies from effectively being used. Fake Out, Follow Me, and Rage Powder help Talonflame fire off its support moves, so keep the aforementioned Ludicolo and Kangaskhan, as well as Scrafty and Clefable, in mind when teambuilding.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Aromatisse was practically made for use in Trick Room, with its low Speed, good bulk, and ability that protects Aromatisse from Taunt and Encore. Aromatisse also has a pure Fairy typing, which gives it many resistances and few weaknesses. Aromatisse, however, possesses little to no offensive presence, which can oftentimes lead to opponents focusing on Aromatisse's partner. Aromatisse also faces competition from Cresselia, which has more offensive presence, as a Trick Room setter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heal Bell can be used to heal status conditions, such as burns, that would otherwise cripple Aromatisse's partner. Swagger is an option for disrupting opponents and can make up for Aromatisse's lack of offensive presence. Healer can be used over Aroma Veil to give Aromatisse a chance to heal a teammate's status condition without the use of Heal Bell. Aroma Veil is still the better choice; however, Healer is worth considering because most opponents won't Taunt Aromatisse in the first place. Charm can lower an opposing Pokemon's damage output.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Hits</strong>: Aromatisse's bulk isn't as great as Cresselia's, and a powerful super effective hit can easily knock it out. This also applies to double targeting; Aromatisse is unable to tank two powerful hits.</p> <p><strong>Sleep: If Aromatisse is not running Safety Goggles, one of the easiest ways to stop it from setting up a Trick Room is to put it to sleep.

Moonblast is a STAB move and gives Aromatisse some offensive presence so that it isn't dead weight after Trick Room has been set up. Dazzling Gleam is an alternate STAB move; while it is weaker than Moonblast, it targets both of the opposing Pokemon. Helping Hand can make up for Aromatisse's lack of offensive presence by boosting its partner's power. Heal Pulse increases Aromatisse's partner's longevity. Light Screen and Reflect can be used to increase Aromatisse's and its partner's bulk. Protect is a very important move on Aromatisse because it scouts for potential Fake Outs and punishes double targets that aim to stop Trick Room setup onto Aromatisse.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP EVs with 220 Defense EVs and a Relaxed nature ensure that Aromatisse survives a Life Orb-boosted Iron Head from Adamant Bisharp, which boosts its chances of getting Trick Room up. Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs should be used so that Aromatisse can function better under Trick Room. The rest of the EVs should be dumped into Special Defense so that Aromatisse can take special attacks better. Aroma Veil is by far the best ability for Aromatisse, as it makes Aromatisse and its partner immune to Taunt, allowing Aromatisse to support its teammate better. Sitrus Berry can add to Aromatisse's longevity because it recovers a good amount of HP once Aromatisse's HP drops below half. Safety Goggles can be used to further increase Aromatisse's chances of getting up Trick Room by protecting it from Spore.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Aromatisse works best as a lead because it is almost guaranteed to successfully set up Trick Room. Protect should be used for a predicted Fake Out or double target onto Aromatisse. Aromatisse should focus on getting up Trick Room as fast as possible. Once Trick Room is up, Aromatisse should focus on supporting its teammate with its many support options.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slower Pokemon that can abuse Trick Room, such as Mega Abomasnow, Mega Mawile, Mega Camerupt, Sylveon, and Conkeldurr, are great partners for Aromatisse. Mega Camerupt and Conkeldurr both offer the ability to check Steel-types, mainly Bisharp, that threaten Aromatisse. Mega Camerupt can check Poison-types as well. Pokemon that offer Fake Out support, such as Hariyama and Scrafty, further increase Aromatisse's chances of getting up Trick Room. The two aforementioned Pokemon also work really well under Trick Room due to their low Speed and are able to check the Steel-types that threaten Aromatisse. Redirection support also benefits Aromatisse greatly. Amoonguss is usually the best candidate, as it does not share a weakness with Aromatisse, unlike Clefable and Togekiss. Aromatisse helps Amoonguss by protecting it from Taunt. Steel-types, such as Heatran, Aegislash, Bisharp, and Mega Mawile, work really well with Aromatisse, as they are able to switch into Steel- and Poison-type attacks aimed at Aromatisse with relative ease. Aromatisse, in turn, can soft check Fighting-types that threaten them.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Dragalge has a slew of unique traits that carve it a niche on Trick Room teams. Its Adaptability-boosted Draco Meteor is one of the hardest-hitting moves in the format. Its typing also grants it excellent neutral STAB coverage, with Poison covering Fairies and Dragon hitting most Pokemon neutrally, as well as several resistances that grant it plenty of opportunities to switch in. It also makes Dragalge the only Dragon-type in the format that takes neutral damage from Fairy-type moves. Dragalge's high Special Defense complements its resistances to make it a great switch-in to special attackers. Unfortunately, while good neutrally, Poison and Dragon have very poor super effective coverage. Moreover, Dragalge is weak to Ground and Ice, which are both very common coverage types in the metagame. Dragalge's low overall base stats also leave it weak against physical attackers, with an underwhelming damage output on its non-STAB moves, and with a Speed stat that leaves it only able to function effectively under Trick Room. Be sure that you're taking advantage of Dragalge's niches properly, as it is otherwise outclassed by other Dragon-types such as Hydreigon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sludge Wave is an option for dealing spread damage, but it also targets allies and should therefore be used in combination with a Steel-type or a Telepathy user. Scald provides a more reliable option to deal with Heatran, which can easily switch into Dragalge's STAB moves. Hydro Pump is a more powerful alternative to Scald, but it is less accurate and generally won't pick up any KOs that Scald doesn't already achieve. Shadow Ball provides a stronger option to deal with Aegislash. Finally, Assault Vest can turn Dragalge into a special tank, but as a Trick Room attacker, dealing as much damage as possible is more important.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Aegislash, Heatran, and Mega Metagross can easily switch into Dragalge's STAB moves. Aegislash does an excellent job at dealing with common Trick Room setters, and Heatran and Mega Metagross both have ways of dealing super effective damage to Dragalge with Earth Power and Zen Headbutt, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mega Camerupt hit Dragalge super effectively with their STAB moves and resist Poison, making them easy to switch in against it. Notably, Excadrill is also part Steel-type, so it can switch into either of Dragalge's STAB moves. Mega Camerupt has a lower base Speed than Dragalge and can move faster than it under Trick Room.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types such as Cresselia and Mega Metagross can deal super effective damage to Dragalge with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers: Dragalge's low HP and mediocre Defense leave it vulnerable to physical attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Salamence, and Tyranitar.</p>",

Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types, which are immune to Draco Meteor, super effectively and provides a secondary STAB move that doesn't lower Dragalge's Special Attack. Focus Blast deals with opposing Steel-types, which resist both Dragon and Poison. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative that trades a lot of power for greater accuracy. Protect shields Dragalge for a turn and gives a teammate the opportunity to react to the foes. Alternatively, if running Choice Specs, Dragon Pulse provides a Dragon-type coverage option without drawbacks, unlike Draco Meteor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Adaptability boosts the power of Dragalge's STAB moves, turning it into a fearsome wallbreaker. Life Orb further increases Dragalge's damage output; alternatively, Choice Specs maximizes Dragalge's wallbreaking potential but locks it into the first move it uses. A Quiet nature and maximum Special Attack EVs are used to deal as much damage as possible, and maximum HP EVs increase Dragalge's general bulk. When using Hidden Power Fire, an EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 248 SpA / 4 SpD should be used to compensate for the associated loss of IVs. Speed IVs are minimized to allow Dragalge to move faster under Trick Room.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragalge's plentiful resistances and great Special Defense make it easy to switch in once Trick Room has been set up, so don't be afraid to take some hits to accomplish this. Draco Meteor is capable of picking up many OHKOs, but you must be wary of killing momentum by using the move and leaving Dragalge neutered offensively. Despite Dragalge's access to moves such as Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast to handle Steel-types, their damage outputs are still fairly underwhelming, so leave handling Steel-types to Fighting-, Fire-, or Ground-type teammates whenever possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Trick Room setters such as Cresselia, Gardevoir, and Jellicent are mandatory teammates in order to set up the field condition for Dragalge. Fighting-types can handle opposing Steel-types, which wall Dragalge's STAB moves.

Will-O-Wisp users such as Jellicent and Rotom-W as well as Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Scrafty, and Mega Mawile can weaken opposing physical attackers, which target Dragalge's lower defensive stat.

  "Sylveon": {
    "overview": "<p>Sylveon is an easy-to-use, yet incredibly effective, Pokemon. Its Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice doesn't hurt partner Pokemon like Surf and Earthquake do, is 100% accurate unlike Heat Wave and Muddy Water, and can be boosted further with items such as Choice Specs and even Pixie Plate. The only pitfall Sylveon encounters is its low Defense, and without speed control, its low Speed is an issue as well. However, its Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice is still incredibly potent for weakening threats from the get-go or making a clean late-game sweep if left unchecked.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Quick Attack is boosted by both Pixie Plate and Pixilate, making it a decently powerful priority move despite Sylveon's base 65 Attack. Calm Mind is good for long-term sweeping, but Sylveon lacks the physical bulk and Speed to pull a boosting set off effectively and is usually better off firing off Hyper Voice. Wish combined with Protect can heal Sylveon or a teammate in a pinch. Baby-Doll Eyes is a good way to neuter physical attackers such as Mega Metagross and Mega Kangaskhan, and Helping Hand can help a partner pick up surprise KOs, but in both cases, Sylveon is much more suited to an attacking role and is better when it receives support as opposed to giving it. Choice Scarf Sylveon isn't overly useful because Sylveon is forced to use a Timid nature and give up a boosting item, which severely cuts into its damage output. Additionally, it doesn't have many Pokemon besides Latios and Terrakion that it can outspeed and OHKO with Hyper Voice. Babiri Berry helps against Steel-types, particularly Bisharp, but in any other situation it is useless.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types, particularly physical Steel-types, give Sylveon the most issues. Mega Metagross and Bisharp outspeed and OHKO Sylveon with Iron Head, Mega Mawile can take a resisted Hyper Voice or underspeed it in Trick Room, and Heatran can ignore Sylveon because of its 4x resistance to Fairy and set up Substitutes, whittle it down with Heat Wave, or 2HKO it with Flash Cannon. Aegislash functions similarly to Heatran with Substitute, though it lacks a 4x resistance.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Gengar and Mega Venusaur commonly use Sludge Bomb as a STAB option, which takes off huge chunks of Sylveon's HP. While Gengar might not want to take more than one Hyper Voice, Mega Venusaur can switch in with impunity unless it gets caught by a Psyshock. Similarly to Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss can also switch in relatively safely and Spore Sylveon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fire-types: Arcanine and Entei resist Hyper Voice and can capitalize on Sylveon's poor Defense with Flare Blitz or Sacred Fire, and they can even lower Sylveon's Special Attack with Snarl. Quiver Dance Volcarona can easily set up on Sylveon because of its Special Defense boosts and resistances, but it can't OHKO Sylveon outright.</p> <p><strong>Wide Guard: Sylveon is rendered helpless or nearly helpless when Wide Guard users are around. Swampert, Aegislash, and Aerodactyl are the most common users, though there are many more and each works just as well in respect to shutting down Sylveon.</p>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice is Sylveon's bread and butter and the move it'll be spamming most often. The remaining slots are basically filler. Psyshock helps against Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, which can otherwise tank Hyper Voices. Shadow Ball is for Mega Metagross and Aegislash, while Hidden Power Ground is for Heatran; all of them could otherwise simply set up Substitutes and sit in front of Sylveon or outright KO it. Moonblast is an option that isn't affected by Wide Guard. Hyper Beam is a high-risk, high-reward move on par with Choice Specs Hydreigon's Draco Meteor in terms of power (even exceeding it in some cases) and leaves Sylveon vulnerable for a turn afterwards, so it is best suited for when Sylveon is low on health or when trading the KO is advantageous.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread lets Sylveon survive Jolly Mega Kangaskhan's Return. To survive more powerful attacks such as Jolly Mega Salamence or Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Sylveon needs a much more defensive spread of 156 HP / 188 Def / 164 SpA. If running Hidden Power Ground, use 188 HP / 68 Def / 248 SpA / 4 Spe due to the 30 Special Attack IV. When Sylveon is paired with speed control, use at least 84 Speed EVs to let Sylveon outspeed Mega Lucario and Adamant Mega Salamence under Tailwind. Use at least 12 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Bisharp after one Icy Wind, which is important because of the Defiant boost Bisharp receives as a result. For Trick Room, be sure to use a Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs, or 1 Speed IV for Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire could also be used over Hidden Power Ground if Ferrothorn or Scizor is a bigger problem to the team than Heatran is. Be sure to adjust EVs accordingly.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Hyper Voice. Sylveon's coverage moves aren't that great to begin with, so only use them if you're forced to. Hyper Beam can be used to sacrifice Sylveon to KO Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and is a great move to use if you're comfortable with an aggressive playstyle. It can easily be punished, however.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>In general, it's best to support Sylveon using redirection and Fake Out to minimize the damage it takes in order to let it fire off more Hyper Voices. Amoonguss is the go-to redirection user typing-wise, while Fake Out can be supplied by many more Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Infernape, and Ludicolo. Intimidate is also nice to provide a buffer for Sylveon's weaker Defense and can be supplied by Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Scrafty, the latter of which can also use Fake Out. Speed control is always nice to get Hyper Voices off before the opponent's Pokemon even move. Cresselia and Jellicent are the go-to Pokemon for Trick Room, while Zapdos and Suicune are both top-notch Tailwind users that also resist Steel, making them good switch-ins against Pokemon such as Metagross. Icy Wind is also viable, though with Sylveon's low Speed, it doesn't help as much.</p>"

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyper Voice is Sylveon's main attack. Psyshock helps slightly against Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur, which can otherwise tank Hyper Voices. Shadow Ball is for Mega Metagross and Aegislash. Hidden Power Ground is for Heatran, which can simply set up Substitutes (although Hyper Voice will hit Heatran and not the Substitute) and sit in front of Sylveon or outright KO it with Flash Cannon. Protect discourages opponents from double-targeting Sylveon and in general helps Sylveon survive longer against certain threats while a partner neutralizes them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Pixie Plate is used to boost Hyper Voice further without detracting from Sylveon's bulk. Life Orb boosts Sylveon's power more than Pixie Plate does at the cost of bulk, so when using Life Orb, you might want to adjust the EV spread to a more speedy and offensive variant and pair Sylveon up with Icy Wind or Tailwind users.</p> <p>The EV spread lets Sylveon survive Jolly Mega Kangaskhan's Return. To survive more powerful attacks such as Jolly Mega Salamence or Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge, Sylveon needs a much more defensive spread of 156 HP / 188 Def / 164 SpA. If using Hidden Power Ground, use 188 HP / 68 Def / 248 SpA / 4 Spe due to the 30 Special Attack and Special Defense IVs. When Sylveon is paired with speed control, use at least 84 Speed EVs for Sylveon to outspeed Jolly Mega Lucario and Adamant Mega Salamence under Tailwind. When using Life Orb, you can afford to use much more Speed investment. 116 Speed EVs let Sylveon outspeed Jolly Mega Salamence with Tailwind support. The highest benchmark Sylveon can reach with a Modest nature is 224 Speed, which outspeeds Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T but unfortunately barely misses out on outspeeding Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p> <p>Use at least 12 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Bisharp after one Icy Wind, which is important because of the Defiant boost Bisharp receives as a result. For Trick Room, be sure to use a Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs, or 1 Speed IV for Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p>Detect could be used over Protect if Imprison is a concern, but Imprison is so rare that the extra PP that Protect provides is more worthwhile.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The biggest draw to using this set is quite simply the ability to use Protect. It allows Sylveon to play around hard checks such as Heatran more easily and helps it stall out a turn for a partner to set up speed-controlling moves. Of course, when Sylveon is not Protecting, it'll be using Hyper Voice; the other two slots are filler. They're nice when Sylveon is forced to attack a threatening Pokemon, but you should try to avoid such situations in the first place.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Sylveon likes partners that can use redirection and Fake Out. Amoonguss is the go-to Rage Powder user typing-wise, and Lucario can take care of Mega Kangaskhan while providing Follow Me support. Fake Out can be supplied by many more Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Infernape, and Ludicolo, each of which provides different types of offensive pressure. Intimidate is also nice to provide a buffer for Sylveon's weaker Defense and can be supplied by Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Gyarados, the latter of which can also use Thunder Wave or Icy Wind for speed control. Landorus-T works especially well with this set, given its ability to use Protect. Speed control is always nice to let Sylveon get Hyper Voices off before the opponent's Pokemon even move. Cresselia and Jellicent are the go-to Pokemon for Trick Room, while Zapdos and Suicune are both top-notch Tailwind users that also resist Steel, making them good switch-ins against Pokemon such as Metagross. Icy Wind is also viable, though with Sylveon's low Speed, it doesn't help as much.</p>"
