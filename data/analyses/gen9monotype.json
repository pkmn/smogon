        "description": "<p>Alolan Sandslash provides valuable role compression for fast-paced Ice teams. It offers not only entry hazard removal, a Toxic immunity, and a resistance to Fairy but also speed control thanks to Slush Rush. Under snow, it notably outpaces and threatens Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, Dragapult, Spectrier, and +1 Baxcalibur, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Hisuian Arcanine and Gholdengo. Slush Rush finds further use in facilitating Alolan Sandslash's entry hazard removal, as it can spin on forced switches against foes such as Flutter Mane, and even if it is being sacrificed, it can generally get a Rapid Spin off before it is KOed. Iron Head is Alolan Sandslash’s primary attacking move, proving especially deadly to Flutter Mane, Hatterene, Alolan Ninetales, and Air Balloon Glimmora. Earthquake allows Alolan Sandslash to offensively pressure Toxapex, and it also smacks targets such as Heatran, Sneasler, and Hisuian Arcanine. Knock Off is valuable for menacing spinblockers such as Dragapult, Hisuian Zoroark, and Gholdengo; it also creates permanent progress by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex, opening them up to hazard damage.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales is an essential partner to Alolan Sandslash, not only setting snow to shore up Alolan Sandslash’s Defense and allowing it to take advantage of Slush Rush but also putting up Aurora Veil to allow Alolan Sandslash to easily enter the field. Moreover, Alolan Ninetales handles the Fighting-types such as Urshifu-R and Great Tusk that Alolan Sandslash is extremely weak to. With a Nasty Plot + Encore set, Alolan Ninetales can also take advantage of and remove Dondozo, Toxapex, Calm Mind Clefable, and Iron Defense Corviknight. Baxcalibur makes an excellent pairing with Alolan Sandslash, greatly appreciating Alolan Sandslash eliminating targets such as Flutter Mane and Alolan Ninetales and removing entry hazards to allow it to sweep unimpeded. Choice Band Chien-Pao is another teammate that appreciates Alolan Sandslash pressuring Fairy-types, clearing entry hazards, and generally softening up the opposing team so it can avoid being chipped down over the course of a game and easily clean. In exchange, Chien-Pao can threaten Corviknight and Kingambit. Froslass absorbs Fighting-type moves for Alolan Sandslash and enjoys it removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and Empoleon via Knock Off, rendering them vulnerable to Froslass’s Spikes. Smack Down Mamoswine similarly appreciates Alolan Sandslash’s Knock Off with regard to its Stealth Rock and can take out Corviknight, which otherwise walls Alolan Sandslash. Frosmoth values Alolan Sandslash bringing down Articuno and Flutter Mane, while in return threatening the pesky Quagsire, Great Tusk, and Ursaluna-B. Cetitan and Cloyster are other examples of Ice-type sweepers that massively benefit from Alolan Sandslash clearing entry hazards prior to their setup.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Boasting a great ability and various coverage options, Clefable cements itself as a great bulky setup sweeper on Fairy teams, threatening hard-to-beat Pokemon like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Empoleon. Moonblast provides a reliable and powerful STAB move that hits neutral targets such as Gastrodon, Mamoswine, and Ogerpon-W. Alternatively, Ice Beam may be used to hit Ground- and Flying-type Pokemon like Clodsire, Zapdos, Ursaluna-B, and Gliscor. Thunderbolt threatens the aforementioned Corviknight, Toxapex, and Empoleon as well as Basculegion-F, Moltres, and Manaphy. Flamethrower may be used to hit Steel-types such as Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Scizor; it should also be noted that Clefable survives a Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor and OHKOes it back. Magic Guard notably offers Clefable an extremely valuable immunity to entry hazards due to the Fairy type's lack of entry hazard removal, in addition to negating Toxic from Toxapex, Gliscor, and Clodsire and letting Clefable use Life Orb without recoil, enhancing its setup ability. Furthermore, Magic Guard allows Clefable to combat Alolan Muk more effectively, and Life Orb enables valuable damage rolls like 2HKOing Toxapex with unboosted Thunderbolt, 2HKOing Assault Vest Iron Hands using Moonblast after a Calm Mind, OHKOing Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao with Calm Mind-boosted Thunderbolt and Moonblast, respectively, and applying additional pressure on Quagsire. Leftovers is the preferred item, however, due to Moonlight's limited recovery and Clefable's mediocre bulk. The given EV spread allows Clefable to outpace Corviknight and maximizes its physical bulk, lessening the chance of Clefable being revenge killed once set up, notably letting it take two Iron Heads from Corviknight.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is an excellent teammate due to its ability to remove Steel-types like Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit as well as beat Poison-types such as Okidogi and Clodsire using Psyshock. Iron Valiant also provides setup opportunities for Clefable via Trick, hindering walls like Gastrodon and Heavy Slam Ting-Lu. In return, Clefable wears down Flying-types like Corviknight, Moltres, and Gliscor as well as Poison-types such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. Klefki provides dual screens support to aid in Clefable's Calm Mind setup, deters setup sweepers such as Scizor and Ogerpon-W with Foul Play, and sets up Spikes to wear down foes like Alolan Muk. Azumarill is a major asset in the Ground, Fire, and Steel matchups, threatening Clodsire, Hisuian Arcanine, and Gholdengo as well as aiding in the Poison matchup by removing walls like Alolan Muk and Galarian Slowking. Flutter Mane aids in the Ghost matchup, taking out threats like Gholdengo and Ceruledge and eliminating threats such as Articuno and Volcarona with Power Gem and Okidogi and Clodsire with Psyshock. In return, Flutter Mane appreciates Clefable chipping down Toxapex, Gliscor, and specially defensive Corviknight. Hatterene takes on Poison-types such as Sneasler and Okidogi as well as threatening Gastrodon and Barraskewda via Giga Drain and can free up a moveslot for Clefable to use Thunderbolt if using Mystical Fire. Tinkaton offers a Poison-type immunity, Stealth Rock support, and the removal of roadblocks like Galarian Slowking, Articuno, Hatterene, and Alolan Muk. Furthermore, Tinkaton aids in Clefable's setup via Knock Off and Encore by taking away passive healing from Pokemon like Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Iron Treads and locking walls into moves. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides a Ground-type immunity and various anti-Steel coverage options to combat Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Heatran as well as provides Healing Wish support to give Clefable more setup opportunities late-game.</p>"

The chosen STAB move is a tradeoff between power and consistency; Flamethrower trades a slightly lower Base Power for consistency, making it the preferred option. Solar Beam deals with Water-type foes such as Urshifu-R, Swampert, and Hisuian Samurott. With Healing Wish, Ninetales allows safe entry to any sweeper on the field, while Encore punishes entry hazard setters and setup sweepers such as Zamazenta, Primarina, and Ceruledge.</p> <p>Gouging Fire is a natural teammate to Ninetales thanks to Protosynthesis, which provides it with a pseudo-Choice Scarf, transforming its Choice Band set into a formidable wallbreaker that can OHKO most foes that are not Fire-resistant such as Gliscor, Landorus, and Galarian Moltres. After a boost, Ogerpon-H also benefits greatly from sun both offensively, with Ivy Cudgel dealing with bulky threats such as Iron Hands, Gliscor, and Mandibuzz, and defensively by reducing the damage from Water-type moves, which can turn Ogerpon-H into a potent wincon with its Grass-type STAB moves in the non-weather variants of the Water and Ground matchups. Other popular teammates include Swords Dance Ceruledge and Air Balloon Heatran, both of which bring valuable immunities to the team and can help in certain matchups such as Ground, Fighting, and Dragon, by targeting specific threats like Clodsire, Earthquake Hippowdon, Gouging Fire, and Zamazenta. Furthermore, Ceruledge, after a Swords Dance, takes out Iron Boulder with Shadow Sneak while Heatran handles Flutter Mane and Toxapex with Heavy Slam and Magma Storm, respectively, and can set Stealth Rock up. Volcarona also reaps quite a few benefits for both its offensive and defensive variants, taking less damage from Water-type moves and getting access to sun-boosted Morning Sun, which makes it possible for Volcarona to set up on Keldeo as well as Greninja in the Dark matchup. Lastly, Ninetales appreciates having Cinderace as a teammate to avoid unnecessary chip damage from hazards when setting up sun thanks to Court Change.</p>"

Aside from this, with a Choice Scarf, Ninetales is able to outspeed and threaten the likes of Choice Scarf Great Tusk and non-Choice Scarf Iron Treads. With Will-O-Wisp, Ninetales is able to weaken physical attackers such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Dragonite. Solar Beam allows Ninetales to threaten the likes of Gastrodon, Quagsire, Barraskewda, and Rotom-W, which all resist its Fire-type STAB attacks. With Encore, Ninetales can force out passive Pokemon to create an opportunity to freely switch out into one of its teammates, as well as lock Pokemon like Baxcalibur and Iron Defense Zamazenta into their setup moves.</p> <p>Setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Ceruledge are two of the biggest beneficiaries of Ninetales's sun, boosting their Fire-type STAB moves to great levels. In return, they can threaten Kommo-o and Flutter Mane with Psychic and Poltergeist, respectively. Sun's boost to Bitter Blade can also increase Ceruledge's longevity. Ogerpon-H's part Grass-typing allows it to match up well against Pokemon Ninetales struggles with, such as Gliscor, Heatran, and Empoleon. Because Ninetales is susceptible to entry hazards, hazard removal from the likes of Cinderace and Talonflame is appreciated. Talonflame's typing also allows it to check various Ground-types such as Gliscor and Iron Treads for Ninetales. Heatran is another great teammate, as with a combination of Taunt and Magma Storm, it is able to trap and remove walls Ninetales struggles with like Toxapex. It can also provide Stealth Rock in order to aid both Ninetales and its teammates. Volcanion's Water immunity allows it to check the likes of Azumarill and Basculegion. Infernape and Hisuian Arcanine appreciate Ninetales's sun to boost their Flare Blitz to explosive levels, as well as its ability to remove Quagsire with Solar Beam. Infernape in particular greatly appreciates Healing Wish support due to the damage it takes from Flare Blitz. In return, Infernape is able to match up well against Dark-types that can pick off Ninetales such as Kingambit, while Hisuian Arcanine handles Flying-types such as both Moltres formes. Choice Specs Iron Moth becomes a terrifying wallbreaker under sun, and with the boost to its Overheat, can OHKO non-Assault Vest Iron Hands and Alolan Muk, although the latter requires prior Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

Freeze-Dry is useful against Water teams, being able to threaten Pelipper and Quagsire out and win the weather war against rain. Moonblast is useful against the ubiquitous Fighting- and Dragon-types in the tier, as it hits Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Baxcalibur, and Kommo-o that are otherwise problems for Ice teams. Encore allows Alolan Ninetales to lock a defensive Pokemon, such as Toxapex, into a weak move or a setup sweeper, such as Iron Defense Corviknight, into a stat-boosting move, letting Alolan Ninetales's teammates take care of the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> <p>Baxcalibur is an amazing teammate for Alolan Ninetales, as it is an incredibly dangerous sweeper that can run through teams after one Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, which is easily facilitated by Alolan Ninetales's snow and Aurora Veil. It also appreciates Alolan Ninetales giving it setup opportunities thanks to Encore and eliminating Quagsire thanks to Freeze-Dry. Alolan Ninetales appreciates Baxcalibur's ability to switch in on Fire-type moves and gain an Attack boost for itself, as well as run through Poison and Steel teams. Chien-Pao provides wallbreaking power or clean-up potential depending on its set while also hitting Steel-types such as Heatran, Kingambit, and Empoleon with a strong Sacred Sword. It appreciates Alolan Ninetales's ability to hit Fighting-types. Mamoswine can threaten Fire-types like Heatran and Torkoal with Earthquake, while packing Thick Fat for a pseudo-Fire neutrality. Additionally, it sets Stealth Rock, which can help Alolan Ninetales pick off weakened threats such as Baxcalibur. It also appreciates the bulk boost in snow. Cetitan is a great partner, as Slush Rush allows it to outspeed and OHKO most of the metagame after a Belly Drum boost, which is easier to acquire thanks to snow and Aurora Veil from Alolan Ninetales. Alolan Sandslash appreciates snow and Aurora Veil both bolstering its bulk and Slush Rush doubling its Speed. In exchange, Alolan Sandslash can use Rapid Spin to clear entry hazards and deal with Hatterene and Flutter Mane, which can both take advantage of Alolan Ninetales. It can also threaten Fire, Steel, and Poison teams with Earthquake. Cloyster brings a lot to the table: namely another Fire neutrality, a way to hit Fire-types such as Talonflame and Ceruledge thanks to Rock Blast and Water-type coverage, and a high Defense stat that makes it nearly unbreakable in snow. In return, Alolan Ninetales facilitates Cloyster's Shell Smash thanks to Aurora Veil and snow support. It also appreciates Alolan Ninetales locking defensive answers to Cloyster, such as Toxapex and Corviknight, into unfavorable moves. Avalugg is a defensive behemoth that, when under snow and Aurora Veil, takes on almost every physical attacker in the tier. It can also remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin to improve Alolan Ninetales's lacking longevity. Finally, Frosmoth becomes a dangerous sweeping threat under snow and Aurora Veil thanks to Quiver Dance, letting it potentially win the Ground, Flying, and Fairy matchups.</p>"

Notably, it lives all of Meowscarada's attacks and +2 Scizor's Bullet Punch. Rock Head allows Hisuian Arcanine to freely use Head Smash and Flare Blitz without their recoil damage. Head Smash is an immensely powerful move, enabling Hisuian Arcanine to 2HKO Toxapex and defensive Landorus-T after Intimidate. Flare Blitz threatens Amoonguss, Corviknight, and Toedscruel, while breaking through Steel teams in general with ease in conjunction with Close Combat. Close Combat provides coverage for Hisuian Goodra, Ursaluna, and Heatran, while also fighting off Dark-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott. Extreme Speed allows Hisuian Arcanine to revenge kill faster opponents like weakened Greninja, Azumarill, and Breloom.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D appreciates Hisuian Arcanine threatening walls like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Amoonguss; in return, Lycanroc-D deals with Chien-Pao, Hydreigon, and Greninja under sand. Garganacl is one of Hisuian Arcanine's best teammates due to its ability to force progress against Water and Steel, notably wearing down Quagsire, Gastrodon, and Quaquaval with Salt Cure. Glimmora forms a potent wallbreaking core with Hisuian Arcanine, taking on Grass and Fairy teams effectively. Furthermore, Glimmora provides entry hazard control with Mortal Spin and sets its own array of hazards to wear down Hisuian Arcanine's switch-ins. In return, Glimmora appreciates Hisuian Arcanine removing Steel-types for it so it can freely use Mortal Spin. Tyranitar provides sandstorm to help chip down opponents and improve Hisuian Arcanine's special bulk, making it trickier to shut down, as well as sets Stealth Rock and spreads paralysis with Thunder Wave to help Hisuian Arcanine outpace and OHKO faster offensive Pokemon. Kleavor provides Stealth Rock with Stone Axe and pivots into Hisuian Arcanine with U-turn, as well as provides additional support in the Steel matchup by hitting Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Heatran with either Night Slash or Close Combat. Shell Smash Drednaw is a great asset in the Water and Ground matchups due to Swift Swim and Air Balloon, heavily weakening those types for Hisuian Arcanine.

With Substitute, it takes advantage of passive Pokemon like Amoonguss and Articuno, which can give Hisuian Arcanine the potential to snowball through slower teams. Close Combat is useful coverage that threatens Steel- and Rock-types such as Hisuian Goodra, Heatran, and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kleavor makes for a great teammate, being able to set up entry hazards with Stone Axe, threaten the likes of Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-H, and Dragapult with its STAB and coverage, and pivot Hisuian Arcanine in on walls it struggles with, like Corviknight and Amoonguss, with U-turn. Glimmora can set up a wide array of entry hazards in Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes while also spreading status and removing hazards with Mortal Spin in case Hisuian Arcanine loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Ogerpon-C forms a great offensive pairing with Hisuian Arcanine, threatening Water-types such as Swampert and Primarina while appreciating Skarmory, Sinistcha, and Gholdengo being taken out in return. Choice Scarf Iron Boulder provides great speed control, and with its part-Psychic typing it threatens Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant, Sneasler, and Keldeo. Terrakion and Rhyperior make for great partners for Hisuian Arcanine, with Terrakion handling Toxapex, Kingambit, and Archaludon while Rhyperior's colorful coverage threatens the likes of Gouging Fire, Dragonite, and Landorus-T.

Head Smash aids Hisuian Arcanine in matchups against types that resist fire such as Water and Dragon, 2HKOing some of their the bulkiest walls like Dondozo, Toxapex, and Garchomp. Hisuian Arcanine also nets OHKOs on Dragon threats such as Dragonite and Gouging Fire, aiding in the type matchup greatly. Extreme Speed allows Hisuian Arcanine to pick off weakened faster foes like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Close Combat can hit bulky Rock-types such as Garganacl and Tyranitar, as well as Flash Fire Heatran. Wild Charge is used for consistent damage against bulky Water-types, often providing equal or greater damage to Head Smash while also not risking the shaky accuracy.</p> <p>Sporting a Choice Band leaves Hisuian Arcanine vulnerable to Stealth Rock and Sticky Web so hazard control from the likes of Cinderace and Torkoal is greatly appreciated. Torkoal also sets up sun with its Drought ability, strengthening Hisuian Arcanine and its allies' Fire-type attacks and reducing the threat of incoming Water-type moves. Ninetales is an alternative Drought user with a much higher Speed tier and a pool of utility options like Healing Wish to further support Hisuian Arcanine. Ogerpon-H, Gouging Fire, Ninetales, and Cinderace can all work in tandem to overwhelm shared checks in bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Rotom-W and other Fire-resistant foes such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Raging Bolt. Ogerpon-H specifically makes use of its Grass-type STAB moves to threaten Water- and Rock-types and Mold Breaker to target Flash Fire Heatran. Volcanion provides a crucial immunity to Water, greatly improving the matchup against Water-types faster than Hisuian Arcanine such as Urshifu-R, Greninja, and Aqua Jet Azumarill. Rotom-H and Talonflame can pivot into Ground-type attacks, the latter of the two also serving as entry hazard control for Hisuian Arcanine and tackling threats like Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W. Heatran is a crucial answer to Choice Specs Flutter Mane, which otherwise spells doom for any team with Drought granting it a Protosynthesis boost; specially defensive Heatran easily tanks hits from Flutter Mane and OHKO it with Heavy Slam while also setting up Stealth Rock and trapping passive nuisances like Toxapex with its combination of Magma Storm and Earth Power. Ceruledge can pivot into predicted Fighting-type moves for Hisuian Arcanine while also taking advantage of Hisuian Arcanine taking out opposing sweepers like Dragonite, Gouging Fire, and weakened Greninja. Choice Scarf Iron Moth's Speed allows it to take on threats that are faster than and threaten to OHKO Hisuian Arcanine like Hydreigon and Iron Valiant.</p>"

Protect allows Tentacruel to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon like Greninja, Meowscarada, and Gholdengo, but this comes at the cost of sacrificing some of Tentacruel's valuable role compression. Haze allows Tentacruel to better deal with Primarina and Sinistcha, but the limited amount of specific foes Haze targets is small enough that it isn't worth running over its main moves.</p> <h4>Poison</h4> <p>Ice Beam can be used over Knock Off and Protect to give Tentacruel more offensive pressure, allowing it to check threats like Adamant Dragonite after chip damage and Gliscor.

Flip Turn allows Tentacruel to easily pivot out on foes such as Hisuian Samurott, Terapagos, and Gliscor. Knock Off is used in the final slot as a solid progress-making option, removing items from foes such as Skarmory and Gholdengo. However, Protect can be used to gain Black Sludge recovery and scout moves from foes. The defensive EVs for each spread provide different defensive benefits; the physically defensive spread with a Timid nature allows Tentacruel to survive an Earthquake from Gliscor and Dragonite, while the specially defensive spread with a Calm nature allows it to beat offensive Heatran and Iron Moth with Surf along with being able to reliably use Knock Off against Flutter Mane. The Speed EVs for both spreads allow Tentacruel to outspeed fully invested Pokemon with base 85 Speed such as Ceruledge, Terapagos, and Kleavor, allowing Tentacruel to reliably pivot out against them or threaten them with Surf and Knock Off.</p> <p>Amoonguss serves a solid defensive complement to Tentacruel, being able to handle Ground- and Electric-types such as Great Tusk, Sandy Shocks, and Rotom-W along with putting foes to sleep with Spore, allowing Tentacruel to come in safely and use Rapid Spin. Pecharunt provides solid defensive support by taking on powerful physical attackers like Azumarill, Gouging Fire, and Hisuain Arcanine. Overqwil enjoys Tentacruel's entry hazard removal not taking away Overqwil's hazards, and it supports Tentacruel by taking on threats such as Iron Boulder and Gallade. Alolan Muk handles special attackers such as Espathra, Flutter Mane, and Terapagos. Galarian Slowking can handle high-power special threats such as Zapdos, Latios, and Choice Specs Iron Moth. Iron Moth appreciates Tentacruel removing entry hazards and pivoting it in with Flip Turn; in response, can handle threats such as Alolan Ninetales, Gholdengo, and Articuno. Galarian Weezing appreciates Tentacruel's Rapid Spin allowing it to drop Defog, and in return, it provides a proper Ground immunity with Levitate and can take on threats such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Iron Hands with Will-O-Wisp and Strange Steam. Okidogi and Sneasler can threaten Steel- and Dark-types like Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, Hisuian Samurott, and Hydreigon; Sneasler can pivot Tentacruel in safely via U-turn along with handling targets like Hoopa-U and Ogerpon-H, while Okidogi can use Bulk Up and beat threats such as Archaludon and Cloyster.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Tentacruel is one of Water's best forms of role compression, removing entry hazards thanks to its access to Rapid Spin, absorbing Toxic Spikes placed by Toxapex and indirectly by Glimmora with its Poison typing, and slow pivoting with Flip Turn. Aside from this, its great ability in Liquid Ooze allows it to punish the Ogerpon formes and Sinistcha, which target it with Horn Leech and Matcha Gotcha. Furthermore, its part-Poison typing gives Water teams an option against Grass- and Fairy-types such as Breloom and Azumarill. Toxic Spikes aids its more offensive-based teammates by afflicting status on incoming foes, and due to Tentacruel's great defensive typing, it finds many opportunities to set one layer of Toxic Spikes. Flip Turn allows it to serve as a great pivot, as with its rather low Speed, it is able to almost always get a teammate in safely. A Calm nature along with 240 Special Defense EVs allows it to survive 2 Earth Powers from Choice Scarf Enamorus and 2 Fickle Beams from Nasty Plot-boosted Hydrapple. Alternatively, a Bold nature along with 240 Defense EVs allows it to survive a Swords Dance-boosted Horn Leech from the Ogerpon formes and KO back, as well as 2 Flower Tricks from Meowscarada. 16 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Adamant Breloom, effectively checking it.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott forms an entry hazard-stacking core with Tentacruel, placing Spikes with Ceaseless Edge while bypassing Taunt and threatening Dark- and Psychic-types that threaten Tentacruel such as Kingambit and Latios. In return, Tentacruel handles Fairy-types for Hisuian Samurott. Poison-types such as Sneasler, Pecharunt, and Toxapex can come in to absorb Tentacruel's Toxic Spikes. Hence, Greninja makes for a great teammate, checking those Poison-types while also threatening bulky Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Clodsire. When Tentacruel is running a physically defensive EV spread, it forms a great defensive pairing with specially bulky Pokemon such as Swampert and Primarina. Swampert provides an Electric immunity, Stealth Rock support, and pivoting via Flip Turn, while Primarina takes on Dragon-types such as Latios, Latias, and Roaring Moon. Alomomola forms a defensive core with Tentacruel, as well as providing Tentacruel recovery via Wish. Tentacruel's ability to spread status and slow pivot is appreciated by late-game sweepers such as Ogerpon-W, Keldeo, and Urshifu-R. Ogerpon-W takes on Landorus, while Keldeo and Urshifu-R break through Steel-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Goodra, and Empoleon. Rotom-W can switch in against Ground-types thanks to Levitate, and it also threatens common hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk with its STAB moves.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Slowbro is an essential pick for Psychic teams due to its physical bulk, which allows it to tank hits from Chien-Pao, Excadrill, and Meowscarada for the team. Body Press pairs nicely with Slowbro's Defense, dealing with Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Scald checks physical threats like Mamoswine and Excadrill while also having a chance to burn them in the process. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to paralyze fast threats like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Choice Scarf Kleavor that are troublesome to Psychic teams. Thunder Wave also synergizes with Scald, catching switches into potential Scald-resistant foes. Iron Defense can be run over Thunder Wave to help take on Gouging Fire better, but doing so means that Slowbro is unable to spread paralysis to troublesome foes. Colbur Berry is a great item, allowing Slowbro to tank a hit from a Dark-type attack, including +2 Crunch from Chien-Pao and +2 Kowtow Cleave from Kingambit with five Supreme Overlord boosts, and retaliate with Body Press. Eject Button can be used over Colbur Berry to allow Slowbro to act as a pivot for the team. Additionally, after using the Eject Button, Slowbro can take Poltergeist from Ceruledge and Knock Off from Roaring Moon. 248 HP EVs are used to allow Slowbro to get the best use out of Regenerator.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Iron Boulder is a great teammate for Slowbro, outspeeding and taking out threats like the Ogerpon formes, Greninja, and Meowscarada with Mighty Cleave and Close Combat. Assault Vest Hoopa-U tanks special attacks from troublesome Ghost- and Dark-types like Flutter Mane, Gholdengo, and Greninja and takes them out with Knock Off and Drain Punch. Hatterene eases the matchup against Dark and Dragon teams with Draining Kiss while also preventing entry hazards and status from being set thanks to Magic Bounce. Hatterene can also run Nuzzle to spread paralysis to threats, which can let Slowbro opt for Iron Defense instead of Thunder Wave. Choice Band Metagross deals with Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant with Bullet Punch. Metagross also provides entry hazard support via Stealth Rock to break a potential Focus Sash held by Ceruledge. Choice Scarf Latias takes out Choice Specs Dragapult and Choice Specs Hydreigon with Draco Meteor and can also Choice lock walls with Choice Scarf via Trick. Gallade helps Slowbro by handling walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Alolan Muk, and Blissey with Sacred Sword. Indeedee provides an immunity to Ghost, an immunity to priority moves via Psychic Surge, and Healing Wish support that gives Slowbro a second chance to wall out physical threats. Indeedee also provides utility with Trick, as it can Choice lock walls like Sableye and Ting-Lu by giving them a Choice item. In return, Slowbro deals with Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Excadrill, which Indeedee can't take on by itself. Espathra becomes a threatening wincon for Slowbro's team once Dark-types have been dealt with. Calm Mind Latios is a nice teammate for Slowbro, taking out threats like Landorus, Clodsire, and Ursaluna-B via Luster Purge and Ice Beam.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Alolan Muk is an amazing defensive part of Dark teams thanks to its part Poison typing, granting a solid neutrality to the Dark-type's weaknesses, which can provide comfort against Choice Specs threats like Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane. Poison Jab provides solid damage into the multitude of Fairy-types in the tier like Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Primarina, and Hatterene. Poison Jab also pairs nicely with Poison Touch, giving Alolan Muk an incredible chance to inflict poison against common switch-ins like Great Tusk and Rotom-W. Knock Off helps Alolan Muk to make progress against threats like Iron Moth and Kyurem. Drain Punch gives Alolan Muk both a form of recovery and a tool to break down Steel-type threats like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra while also preventing it from being set up on by Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Finally, Protect can allow for Alolan Muk to scout Choice-locked threats like Meowscarada and Latias while getting Black Sludge recovery.</p> <p>Mandibuzz provides a solid complement to Alolan Muk, being able to come in on the Ground-types that naturally threaten Alolan Muk like Garchomp, Hippowdon, and Swampert thanks to its Flying typing along with using Defog to remove entry hazards so Alolan Muk can get the most out if its Black Sludge recovery. Mandibuzz also takes advantage of setup sweepers like Scizor and Ogerpon-W that can easily set up on Alolan Muk with Foul Play. Sableye also greatly benefits Alolan Muk by being able to handle the powerful physical Fighting-type threats like Great Tusk, Sneasler, and Zamazenta thanks to its Ghost typing and Will-O-Wisp. Both Mandibuzz and Sableye majorly appreciate Alolan Muk's ability to tank Moonblast from the likes of Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, in addition to its Toxic immunity. Chien-Pao greatly benefits Alolan Muk, being able to outspeed and remove threats like non-Choice Scarf Sneasler, Clodsire, and Landorus with ease while appreciating Alolan Muk's Poison Jab hindering switch-ins with poison and Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes. Kingambit appreciates Alolan Muk's ability to take on Primarina and Choice Specs Iron Valiant, which majorly threaten Kingambit, along with Alolan Muk's ability to threaten poisoning bulky targets like Torkoal, putting them on timers. Alolan Muk complements Ting-Lu's hazard stacking capabilities by being able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots. Both Meowscarada and Greninja assist Alolan Muk by removing Ground-types like Hippowdon, non-Choice Scarf Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu. Meowscarada helps threaten out the several Water-type threats of the tier like Keldeo and Urshifu-R thanks to its powerful Flower Trick, along with catching several problematic Fighting- and Dragon-types like mixed Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon with Play Rough. Greninja's powerful Water-type STAB attacks can wash away problematic Fire-types like Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine and Choice Specs Iron Moth with minimal issues, and it can use Extrasensory to cleanly remove Okidogi and non-Choice Scarf Sneasler. Hydreigon can break past physical walls like Toxapex and Skarmory that are too bulky for Alolan Muk. Alolan Muk appreciates Hydreigon's Levitate making it able to easily come in against threats like Swampert and Hippowdon, while Hydreigon appreciates Alolan Muk ability to deter Fairy-types like Enamorus and Alolan Ninetales.</p>"

Knock Off deals with the aforementioned Psychic- and Ghost-types while removing crucial held items from the likes of Blissey, Swampert, and Archaludon. Drain Punch provides Alolan Muk with a solid recovery tool and gives it coverage for Dark- and Steel-type threats such as Hydreigon, Greninja, and Heatran. Poison Jab provides a decently consistent option of spreading poison when paired with Poison Touch while dealing with foes such as Hatterene and Primarina reliably. Curse can be used to let Alolan Muk act as a win condition as well as allowing it to comfortably take on physical threats like Ceruledge. Rest provides a form of recovery, letting Alolan Muk stick around longer against bulkier teams. If it's running Rest, Sleep Talk can be used over Protect to prevent Alolan Muk from being too passive during its sleep turns.</p> <p>Physically defensive Amoonguss is an incredible partner for Alolan Muk thanks to its Ground neutrality, Water resistance, and Grass-type STAB moves, as it can handle the Ground- and Water-type threats that would normally feast on Alolan Muk like Great Tusk, Gastrodon, and Urshifu-R without much worry. Galarian Weezing provides a crucial form of entry hazard removal, allowing Alolan Muk to get the most out of its Black Sludge recovery while also checkingDragon-type foes like Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Physically defensive Toxapex can handle threats such as Kleavor and Mimikyu thanks to Haze and Toxic. Overqwil can pair well with Alolan Muk, creating a Dark-type core for Poison teams, with Overqwil handling physical Ghost- and Psychic-type threats such as Ceruledge, Gallade, and Iron Boulder. Furthermore, Overqwil can set Spikes while Alolan Muk can use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, along with taking on special threats like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Indeedee. Both Galarian Slowking and Clodsire complement Alolan Muk as fellow special walls, as Assault Vest Galarian Slowking handles threats such as Enamorus, Iron Moth, and Latios as well as creating pressure with Future Sight, while Alolan Muk helps deals with the Ghost-types that would normally threaten it. Unaware Clodsire deals with setup sweepers like Gholdengo, Volcarona, and Sneasler while providing entry hazards, which can put pressure on them after Alolan Muk removes their Heavy-Duty Boots. Iron Moth can break past the Steel-type threats and physical walls that Alolan Muk is unable to dent such as Scizor, Skarmory, and Amoonguss. Okidogi and Sneasler strongly appreciate Alolan Muk's Psychic immunity, and in return, they handle threats such as Kingambit, Hisuian Goodra, and Ogerpon-C, which otherwise cause significant issues for Alolan Muk.</p>"

Icicle Spear targets opposing Flying-, Ground- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Kilowattrel, Clodsire, and Walking Wake while breaking Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Breloom. Rock Blast benefits from Skill Link and threatens Fire-types like Ceruledge after a boost and other Ice-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao. Ice Shard is useful for revenge killing faster Choice Scarf Pokemon that are weakened like Flutter Mane, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon. Hydro Pump is the alternative in order to not be walled by opposing Steel-types like Kingambit and Forretress. It is also beneficial for threatening Paldean Tauros-F, which is a significant issue to Ice teams, as well as Skeledirge and Torkoal, easing the Fire matchup. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows +2 Cloyster to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Walking Wake, Hydreigon and Indeedee; a Naive nature with the remaining 4 EVs going into Special Attack should be used if opting for Hydro Pump to not reduce its damage. Skill Link is the best ability to run on Cloyster since it guarantees Icicle Spear and Rock Blast hit 5 times. White Herb is Cloyster's preferred item, as it is able to offset the Defense drops of Shell Smash, which makes Cloyster harder to revenge kill. Focus Sash is the alternative to always guarantee one turn of setup from full health, but it is less preferred since Cloyster is harder to OHKO under snow or Aurora Veil.</p> <p>Cloyster's best partner on Ice is Abomasnow. Abomasnow allows Cloyster to have an easier time to set up thanks to it setting snow, which, combined with Aurora Veil, allows it to set up on Pokemon that can usually threaten it out like offensive Great Tusk and Cinderace. Abomasnow also has Leech Seed support to improve Cloyster's longevity and handles Unaware Pokemon Quagsire and Dondozo with its STAB Giga Drain. Cloyster is able to threaten Fire's weather setter Torkoal after a boost, which benefits Abomasnow, as it can come back in to reset the weather for its teammates. Cloyster also appreciates Chien-Pao as an offensive partner, as Swords Dance sets are able to weaken its defensive checks like Toxapex, Kingambit and Rotom-W. Choice Scarf sets are also able to clean up late-game more easily thanks to Cloyster's sweeping. Baxcalibur is also one more offensive partner for Cloyster, as its ability to switch into Will-o-Wisp from Pokemon like Sableye and Rotom-W supports Cloyster's sweeping capabilities, while Cloyster offers additional support against the Dragon-types that threaten Baxcalibur like Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon. Choice Band Baxcalibur can also wear down defensive walls like Corviknight and Skeledirge, which gives Cloyster an easier sweep. Glaceon also pairs well with Cloyster, as it can threaten defensive Water-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Dondozo with Freeze-Dry. Avalugg can support Cloyster with its Rapid Spin to remove hazards, so Cloyster can come in easier and set up. Avalugg is also able to handle Cloyster's offensive checks like Great Tusk under snow. Froslass is Ice's only viable option for Spikes, which Cloyster appreciates, as defensive Pokemon like Hatterene and Iron Hands aren't able to check it properly after a boost.</p>"

Shadow Ball threatens Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon like Gholdengo, Pecharunt, and Hatterene. Thunderbolt provides solid coverage by hitting dangerous Flying- and Water-types like Corviknight, Pelipper, and Primarina. Focus Blast allows Gengar to deal with Dark-, Normal-, and Steel-type threats in Hydreigon, Ursaluna-B, Heatran, and Archaludon, while Dazzling Gleam provides a less risky option to hit Dark-types along with Dragon-types like Walking Wake. Finally, Trick allows Gengar to disrupt special walls like Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Ting-Lu by granting them a useless Choice Specs, along with Choice locking Kingambit, which can prove problematic for Poison teams. Icy Wind, however, has the solid role of removing Landorus and Gliscor, which pose significant threats to Poison teams.</p> <p>Amoonguss can take hits from Water- and Ground-types that Gengar cannot handle such as Ogerpon-W, Swampert, and Great Tusk, along with using Spore to grant Gengar safe entry. Amoonguss can also use Foul Play to remove threats to Gengar such as Dragapult and Mimikyu. Galarian Weezing threatens potent Dark-types like Meowscarada, Ting-Lu, and Roaring Moon thanks to its Fairy-type STAB move and Will-O-Wisp. Galarian Weezing can also use Defog to remove entry hazards, ensuring Gengar stays healthy. Toxapex can handle priority from threats like Scizor, Mimikyu, and Lokix attempting to remove Gengar, along with being able to handle threats like Chien-Pao and Barraskewda. Overqwil pairs nicely with Gengar with its immense physical bulk, being able to take hits from fast physical Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Ceruledge, Iron Boulder, and Gallade. Overqwil's entry hazards also provide utility in chipping down special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Ting-Lu, which can both prove problematic to Gengar. In return, Overqwil appreciates Gengar's Ghost typing allowing it to block Rapid Spin from the likes of Forretress and Tentacruel. Alolan Muk can handle special attacking Ghost- and Dark-type threats like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, Greninja, and Darkrai. Galarian Slowking can switch into revenge killers Gengar can struggle with, such as Choice Scarf Latias and Choice Scarf Enamorus, and threaten them back with its strong coverage moves. Both Sneasler and Okidogi can handle Dark-types like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Samurott, and Kingambit while appreciating Gengar removing Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gholdengo, Hatterene, and Slowbro. Choice Scarf Sneasler can also blitz past problematic foes such as Hoopa-U, Hisuian Goodra, and Chien-Pao without worry. Okidogi, meanwhile, appreciates Gengar weakening physical walls like Galarian Weezing, Toxapex, and Sableye that prevent it from setting up safely. In response, Okidogi can handle Dark-type menaces like Kingambit, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon without any issues.</p>"

      "Toxic Spikes Lead (Ghost)": {

Setting up Toxic Spikes is Gengar's main objective, as the extra chip damage helps wear down Pokemon that would otherwise give Ghost teams lots of trouble, such as Ting-Lu and Porygon2. Taunt is used to prevent opposing leads from setting up their own entry hazards, such as Skarmory, Swampert, and Tinkaton. Destiny Bond can be used in tandem with Taunt to force foes to attack and secure a trade. Sludge Bomb allows Gengar to not be completely passive, as well as having a 50% chance to OHKO Hatterene, dissuading it from trying to block Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Toxic Spikes greatly helps offensive teammates muscle through bulkier foes. Spectrier appreciates its would-be checks getting worn down by poison damage, such as Porygon2 and Hoopa-U. Additionally, Spectrier can utilize Hex's double-damage effect immediately rather than having to spend a turn using Will-O-Wisp. The same goes for Dragapult which notably secures an OHKO on poisoned Choice Specs Flutter Mane. Ceruledge appreciates Gengar preventing foes from setting entry hazards with taunt, thus keeping its Focus Sash intact. In turn, Ceruledge can handle the Steel-type Pokemon that Gengar is useless against. Gholdengo's ability, Good as Gold, blocks Defog from the likes of Braviary and Mandibuzz. It is also yet another Pokemon that can use Hex to its fullest potential without having to spend a turn using Thunder Wave. Both Froslass and Brambleghast can stack additional hazards in spikes, ensuring that even foes unaffected by Toxic Spikes will still take some hazard damage</p>"

Its secondary Fairy typing is also a major boon for Poison, making it immune to Dragon, which gives it utility in absorbing high powered Dragon moves like Outrage from Dragonite and completely checking Garchomp. It also provides a helpful resistance to Dark, giving it added bulk against Dark-types like Alolan Muk and Meowscarada. Strange Steam is used for its STAB attack, dealing solid damage and threatening Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-types such as Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Roaring Moon. Defog is incredibly valuable, being the only consistent form of entry hazard removal on Poison, which Galarian Weezing can easily switch in and use thanks to its immunity to Spikes and neutrality to Stealth Rock This also allows it to run Black Sludge to further increase its longevity. Pain Split acts as a form of recovery and offensive pressure, allowing it to drain away health from opposing walls such as Toxapex and Gliscor while healing itself back up. Will-O-Wisp threatens physical attackers from those that it walls like Great Tusk and Dragonite and impairs others that do threaten it like Iron Treads and Corviknight, making them much easier to handle.</p> <p>Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking are amazing teammates for Galarian Weezing that cover Galarian Weezing's biggest weakness: low Special Defense. As specially bulky tanks, they can switch into strong special attacks, such as Choice Specs Greninja's Extrasensory, while majorly appreciating Defog from Galarian Weezing to maximize their longevity. Alolan Muk handles Psychic- and Ghost-type attacks from foes like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Espathra with ease thanks to its Dark typing and STAB Knock Off. Meanwhile, Galarian Slowking can soak up hits from Heatran, Regieleki, and Volcarona while responding back with its myriad of coverage, as well as create traps with Future Sight, which Galarian Weezing can exploit with Strange Steam or use as a chance to Defog safely. Toxapex's Water typing allows it to switch into and wall the many Steel-types of the tier like Scizor, Tinkaton, and Empoleon. It also handles other powerful threats such as Chien-Pao and Ceruledge, using Haze to stop their setup and Infestation or Surf to do damage. Toxapex is also a valuable Knock Off absorber in the Dragon, Dark, and Ice matchups, preventing Galarian Weezing from losing its Black Sludge from foes such as Cyclizar, Sableye, and Alolan Sandslash. Amoonguss appreciates Galarian Weezing taking the stress off it in the Ground matchup and allowing for it to have a much easier time taking on threats, such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Mamoswine, after they have been burned. Amoonguss is also able to handle threats to Galarian Weezing like Gastrodon and Sandy Shocks. Thanks to Defog allowing Salazzle safe entry, it can threaten every Steel-type in the tier with a mix of its STAB Flamethrower and Toxic thanks to Corrosion, which puts Steel-types that try to threaten it, such as Heatran and Hisuian Goodra, on timers, and it means Galarian Weezing won't have to worry about them late-game. Glimmora can be used instead of Salazzle, as it also can use Toxic thanks to Corrosion, has Earth Power to hit Heatran, has Energy Ball to help out against Ground-types, such as Great Tusk and Gastrodon, and if its Air Balloon is still intact, it can inflict Toxic onto Clodsire with no fear. With Defog support, Choice Scarf Sneasler can come onto the field safely and fire off strong its strong STAB Close Combat and Dire Claw against threats like Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Enamorus. Okidogi also works well as a Fighting-type that majorly appreciates burn being spread to have an easier time setting up before tearing into threats like Kingambit and Heatran with its STAB moves. Defog support will also allow safe entry for Iron Moth, which melts Steel-types with its powerful Fire-type STAB attacks, such as Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Corviknight, as well as being able to eradicate Landorus if using Choice Specs with Overheat. Gengar is another solid Choice Specs user that can scare out Skeledirge, which otherwise uses Galarian Weezing for setup and can also deal with Landorus with Icy Wind.</p>"

Intimidate allows Gyarados to safely switch into physical threats such as Barraskewda and Mamoswine. Dragon Tail punishes setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Ceruledge, and Gouging Fire by forcing them to switch out. Thunder Wave allows Gyarados to slow down Choice Scarf users such as Roaring Moon and Enamorus, essentially making their Choice Scarf useless. Rest is Gyarados's only form of recovery, and it also allows it to act as a status absorber against moves such as Gliscor and Salazzle's Toxic. 24 Speed EVs allow Gyarados to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Flutter Mane while it is paralyzed.</p> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Gliscor, both Landorus formes, and Skarmory are great teammates for Gyarados, as Dragon Tail racks up hazard damage on unsuspecting Pokemon. Additionally, Gliscor and Landorus can switch into Electric-type attacks from Pokemon that would otherwise make quick work of Gyarados. Tornadus-T can use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes, so Gyarados can rack up damage on them via Dragon Tail paired with the aforementioned hazard setters. Articuno is a nice defensive complement to Gyarados, as Articuno can switch into special moves from Pokemon like Dragapult, Kyurem, and Greninja. Articuno can also use Haze to stop setup Pokemon that Gyarados cannot phaze with Dragon Tail, such as Hatterene and Primarina. Choice Scarf Enamorus can outspeed and KO Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada and Roaring Moon when they have been paralyzed by Thunder Wave. It can also use Healing Wish to bring Gyarados back to full HP without having to be immobile for two turns. Corviknight not only provides a Rock-type neutrality but also can remove hazards with Defog if Gyarados loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Adamant Dragonite appreciates Gyarados's Thunder Wave support, as it outspeeds and OHKOes paralyzed Choice Specs Flutter Mane after one Dragon Dance.</p>"

Substitute allows Gyarados to take advantage of passive walls like Toxapex so that it can set up freely on them, while Taunt shuts down attempts to both inflict status on it and remove its boosts with Haze. Earthquake provides coverage against Poison- and Steel-types such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Hisuian Goodra. 248 HP and 8 Defense EVs ensure that Gyarados's Substitute does not get broken by Clodsire's Poison Jab.</p> <p>Landorus and Gliscor pair well with Gyarados, as with their Electric immunity, they can take on foes like Raging Bolt, Magnezone, and Regieleki. Additionally, Gliscor spreads status with Toxic, sets up entry hazards to aid in Gyarados's sweeping, and matches up well against several hazard removers like Excadrill, Glimmora, and Regieleki. Skarmory also sets up Spikes to aid Gyarados, and it can set up its IronPress combination on physically offensive threats such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Mamoswine. Due to Gyarados's vulnerability to Stealth Rock, it appreciates hazard removal from Corviknight so that it finds more opportunities to switch in; Corviknight can also pivot Gyarados in with U-turn and aids against Choice Specs Kyurem. In return, Corviknight appreciates Gyarados taking on Fire-types such as Heatran and Volcarona. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides valuable speed control for Flying teams, as it is able to outspeed and threaten speedy foes like non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Greninja, and it also aids greatly in the Dragon matchup, taking on foes such as Dragapult, Hydreigon, and Garchomp. Additionally, Enamorus provides Healing Wish support to aid Gyarados in its sweeping. Enamorus greatly appreciates Gyarados covering Steel-types like Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Scizor in return. Early-game wallbreakers like Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Specs Zapdos clear out bulky threats like Sinistcha and Corviknight so that Gyarados can find opportunities to sweep. Lastly, Gyarados can enable other sweepers like Galarian Moltres and Thundurus-T by clearing out foes like opposing Gliscor, so it can sweep late-game. Specifically, Thundurus-T provides an Electric immunity and aids against Water-types such as Rotom-W, Pelipper, and Ogerpon-W.</p>"

Ditto does not copy the enemy HP stat, so 248 HP EVs are used to minimize damage taken from entry hazards before transforming while maximizing Ditto's HP stat, as well as allowing Ditto to use Struggle 4 times before it faints. 252 Defense EVs minimize the damage Ditto takes from opposing Ditto in the extremely rare mirror matchup. Finally, a Relaxed nature coupled with 0 Speed IVs guarantees that Imposter will never activate first, which ensures that Ditto will have more Transform PP in the aforementioned mirror match.</p> <p>Ursaluna is a great teammate for Ditto, as it can switch into walls and begin applying immediate pressure. Ditto also appreciates Ursaluna's unrivaled ability to punch holes in the opposing team, making a late-game Ditto sweep much easier. If Ditto copies certain targets like Chien-Pao and a majority of the opposing team is weakened, Ditto can win the game. Indeedee is a good teammate for Ditto, as its Psychic Surge ability prevents Ditto from being picked off by priority moves. Blissey is a nice partner for Ditto, as it can absorb status moves that would otherwise cripple Ditto and then shrug them off via Natural Cure. Blissey can also use Thunder Wave to slow down opposing Choice Scarf users that would otherwise Speed tie with Ditto such as Meowscarada and Enamorus Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a powerful teammate that pairs well with Ditto, as Ditto can copy the stat boosts from setup sweepers that aim to take advantage of a Choice-locked Hisuian Zoroark. Cyclizar can be used to remove entry hazards so that Ditto can switch in frequently without getting chipped. Additionally, it is able to keep hazards away and use Shed Tail to bring Ditto in behind a Substitute and make it even more threatening. Maushold can use its high speed tier to lock Bulk Up users like Landorus-Therian that would otherwise be able to stall out Ditto. Additionally, Maushold is able to break down walls due to the sheer power of Population Bomb. Pivots are great teammates for Ditto because they can lure in targets for Ditto to copy. Choice Scarf Staraptor and Defensive Braviary are solid picks, as they can use U-turn to go right into Ditto. Braviary is also capable of using Defog to keep Ditto alive for longer.</p>"

Futhermore, it can be used against other Flying-types to counter threats like Enamorus and Gliscor. Substitute allows Articuno to avoid status conditions such as Toxic from Toxapex and Gliscor while also leveraging Pressure to PP stall special attackers. Alternatively, U-turn pairs well with its mediocre Speed stat, which can be used to pivot out and provide a safe switch to setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Gliscor. Haze is used to nullify special setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Hatterene and Nasty Plot Galarian Moltres.

The primary EV spread prevents Gliscor's Knock Off from breaking Substitute while always OHKOing Urshifu-R and 2HKOing Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage. The second EV Spread can be used to allow Zapdos to always set up a Substitute against Toxapex and OHKO Skarmory.</p> <p>Both Skarmory and Corviknight serve as excellent teammates to Zapdos, as their Steel typing allows them to take on threats such as Weavile, Mamoswine, and Ogerpon-C.

Discharge is preferred over its other Electric-type STAB moves, since it allows Zapdos to spread paralysis among foes like Dragonite with much more ease, thus crippling them and preventing them from becoming long-term threats. Hurricane provides consistent damage against threats like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Volcarona, which can hamper the momentum of Electric teams significantly. Roost provides reliable recovery behind Substitute and solidifies its longevity on the field. 16 EVs invested in HP ensure that Zapdos can use Substitute four times consecutively while ensuring that Toxapex doesn't break its Substitute.</p> <p>Iron Hands is a remarkable teammate for Zapdos, as it can take care of foes like Ogerpon-C, Tyranitar, Gliscor, and Landorus with Drain Punch and Ice Punch. In return, Zapdos acts as a switch-in to Ground-type moves and threatens foes like Sinistcha and Iron Valiant with Hurricane, which may be problematic for Iron Hands to handle alone. Rotom-W and Zapdos leverage their immunity to Ground-type moves together, with the former acting as a pivot with Volt Switch and spreading burn through Will-O-Wisp, thus making it easier for the latter to handle physical threats like opposing Iron Hands, Kingambit, and Dragonite. Sandy Shocks makes monumental contributions for Zapdos by not only setting entry hazards but also providing an Electric immunity, which makes it easier for the pair to handle threats like non-Air Balloon Raging Bolt and opposing Zapdos. Furthermore, Sandy Shocks acts as a vital pivot with the help of Volt Switch. Assault Vest Magnezone can deal with foes like Flutter Mane with considerable ease, which Zapdos may have trouble dealing with otherwise. Choice Scarf Pawmot not only takes out Hisuian Arcanine and Choice Specs Greninja for Zapdos, but it can also use Revival Blessing to grant Zapdos a second chance to wreak havoc, thus proving pivotal in the Fighting, Grass, and Bug matchups in particular. Lastly, Regieleki is a swift late-game sweeper owing to its extremely high Speed stat and strong STAB moves boosted by Transistor.

Hurricane is Zapdos's strongest STAB move, being able to OHKO Sableye, Amoonguss, and possibly Quagsire, and also being able to 2HKO physically defensive Skeledirge and Ursaluna. Zapdos can also take advantage of matchups against rain teams by being able to spam Hurricane without fear of missing. Volt Switch allows Zapdos to bring in teammates safely against special walls like Assault Vest Iron Hands, Assault Vest Galarian Slowking, and Heatran. Heat Wave provides Zapdos great coverage, allowing it to 2HKO Magnezone, as well as Klefki under Light Screen and Iron Treads. Static has a chance to paralyze Pokemon that make contact with Zapdos such as Dragonite and Mimikyu.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks makes for a great partner, being able to provide entry hazard support with both Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as being able to threaten Heatran with Earth Power.

It is also able to outspeed Pokemon that outspeed Zapdos such as Flutter Mane and non-Choice Scarf Greninja. Pokemon with great special bulk such as Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Tyranitar can be tough for Zapdos, with the latter being able to threaten it with Stone Edge. Hence, Iron Hands pairs well with Zapdos, as it is able to threaten Galarian Slowking with Earthquake and Tyranitar with Drain Punch. In return, Zapdos can switch into anticipated Ground-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Magnezone is another great partner, being able to threaten Hatterene and Flutter Mane, as well as potentially winning the Chien-Pao matchup. Lastly, Zapdos's wallbreaking opens up sweeping opportunities for fast sweepers such as Nasty Plot Rotom-W and Choice Scarf Pawmot.

Hurricane OHKOes Fighting-types like Iron Valiant, Urshifu-R, and, when at +2, Assault Vest Gallade. It is also Galarian Moltres's strongest option for hitting Fairy-types, outright OHKOing Flutter Mane and Hatterene at +2 and OHKOing non-Assault Vest Primarina at +2 after minimal chip damage. Fiery Wrath is a more reliable STAB option, hitting Flying-resistant Pokemon like Heatran, Corviknight, and Zapdos. Agility allows Galarian Moltres to mitigate its low Speed, allowing it to outspeed would-be faster foes like Zamazenta and Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Ting-Lu provides entry hazard support and leverages its Electric immunity and Rock resistance to handle foes like Raging Bolt and Tyranitar. It can also break through special walls like Clodsire, Hisuian Goodra, and Alolan Muk. Grimmsnarl provides dual screens support for easier setup, potentially letting Galarian Moltres survive super effective moves like Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Iron Hands's Thunder Punch to activate both Berserk and its Weakness Policy. Grimmsnarl can also use Taunt to deny hazards from being set up and provide safe a switch in to Galarian Moltres using Parting Shot. Alolan Muk, with its Poison typing and excellent special bulk, can stave off Fairy-type attacks from foes like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Enamorus, threatening them back with Poison Jab. Bisharp serves an offensive answer to Fairy-, Ice-, and Rock-types, utilizing Sucker Punch to pick off Flutter Mane and Iron Boulder. Choice Band Meowscarada, Choice Specs Greninja, and Swords Dance Weavile can eliminate bulky Ground-types like Clodsire and Ting-Lu. Meowscarada and Greninja can help alleviate the Rock matchup for Galarian Moltres, with Meowscarada also threatening Water-types like Primarina and Dondozo. Meowscarada, Hoopa-U, and Weavile eliminate special walls like Blissey and Hisuian Goodra; Hoopa-U and Greninja also assist in Fighting and Fairy matchups. Sableye, with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off, can wither down foes like Iron Hands and Dragonite, making it easier for Galarian Moltres to set up and eliminate them. Mandibuzz serves as a Defogger and can provide safe entry to Galarian Moltres using U-turn. Choice Scarf Darkrai can use its superb Speed tier and coverage options to revenge kill opposing Choice Scarf users like Iron Boulder, Meowscarada, and Greninja.</p>"

Alternatively, Fire Punch threatens would-be checks like Corviknight and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Extreme Speed picks off weakened threats such as Greninja and Iron Valiant attempting to revenge kill it, while Encore may be used to lock physical walls like Dondozo, Quagsire, and Ting-Lu into a move, either letting Dragonite deal extra chip damage or effortlessly set up in front of them.

In return, Dragonite checks troublesome Fighting-types like Quaquaval and Slither Wing. Cyclizar's Shed Tail in conjunction with Multiscale grants Dragonite many chances to set up and prevents it from being affected by status effects inflicted by Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Skeledirge. Garchomp sets up entry hazards in the form of Stealth Rock and Spikes, chipping down Dragonite's switch-ins such as Forretress, Kingambit, and Quagsire. Dragapult breaks past walls such as Dondozo and Corviknight and prevents Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from clearing Garchomp's entry hazards. Dragalge's secondary Poison typing and commendable bulk allow it to check Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, and it supports Dragonite's sweeping with Toxic Spikes, notably wearing down Ting-Lu, Slowbro, and Quagsire. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon is a great revenge killer and method of speed control, as it outpaces and deals with Choice Scarf Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, and Choice Specs Greninja.

Fire Punch allows Dragonite to threaten foes that resist Outrage and are immune to Earthquake like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Air Balloon Gholdengo.</p> <p>Corviknight is an essential teammate for Dragonite, since it handles Rock-, Fairy-, and Ice-types like Ogerpon-C, Hatterene, and Chien-Pao with Iron Head, pivots it in with U-turn, and uses Defog to remove Stealth Rock that would otherwise wear Dragonite down over time and break Multiscale. In return, Corviknight appreciates Dragonite handling the aforementioned Fire-types as well as Electric-types like Magnezone and Raging Bolt. Skarmory and Gliscor set up entry hazards to help Dragonite in its wallbreaking. Additionally, Skarmory can wall physical attackers like Kingambit and Iron Boulder with Iron Defense and threaten them back with Body Press, while Gliscor aids in the Electric matchup thanks to its Ground typing. Zapdos makes for a great partner, as it can pivot Dragonite in with Volt Switch and take care of physically bulky threats like Amoonguss and Iron Defense Corviknight. Dragonite handles Iron Treads and Clodsire in return. Choice Scarf Enamorus is great speed control, as it takes care of faster threats that can threaten Dragonite like Dragapult, Garchomp, and Choice Specs Greninja. In return, Enamorus appreciates Dragonite taking out Steel-types like Gholdengo and Iron Treads with Earthquake and Fire Punch. Landorus, with its colorful coverage, takes out threats to Dragonite like Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine, Gouging Fire, Kyurem, and Iron Defense Zamazenta.

In return, Dragonite handles Volcarona for Archaludon, while Garchomp appreciates the removal of Corviknight and Skarmory. Dragapult with Will-O-Wisp pairs well with Dragonite, as it weakens physical attackers such as Kingambit and Iron Hands so that Dragonite deals with them more easily, and Dragonite removes Alolan Muk for Dragapult in return. Hisuian Goodra makes for a great defensive partner, as with its great special bulk, it shrugs off attacks from the likes of Greninja and Flutter Mane, and it threatens Fairy-types like the aforementioned Flutter Mane. Hisuian Goodra also has access to Knock Off to remove items like Leftovers and Black Sludge from their holders so that Dragonite can threaten them more easily. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon provides great speed control, and with its colorful moveset, it threatens Ghost- and Fairy-types like Dragapult, Spectrier, non-Choice Scarf Flutter Mane, and Iron Valiant and brings Dragonite in safely with U-turn.

Choice Scarf Latias is another great form of speed control, as it handles fast Dragon- and Fighting-types like Gouging Fire, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk and it can use Trick to shut down walls like Amoonguss and Skarmory so Dragonite can more easily deal with them. Additionally, it provides Healing Wish support to not only give Dragonite another chance at wallbreaking also restore its Multiscale.

Extreme Speed provides utility in allowing Dragonite to clean up weakened threats along with catching Choice Scarf threats that outspeed it even after a Dragon Dance such as Meowscarada.

Aqua Jet can also sweep late-game, especially against types that lack Water-resistant Pokemon like Steel. Play Rough breaks through sturdier threats that are not OHKOed by Aqua Jet like Hydreigon and Iron Hands. It also threatens opposing Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Dragalge. Liquidation can be used over Play Rough to OHKO Pokemon like Corviknight, Unaware Clodsire, and Bronzong after Belly Drum.

Magic Bounce Hatterene also assists Azumarill, as it bounces back entry hazards—particularly Toxic Spikes—which limits Azumarill's sweeping capabilities.

Galarian Slowking, meanwhile, benefits from them removing dangerous Dark-type threats like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott. Amoonguss complements Galarian Slowking by being a physical wall capable of handling physical attacks from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads with its Grass-type STAB moves and Foul Play, along with creating openings with Spore so Galarian Slowking can pivot in to heal and set Future Sight. Galarian Weezing provides similar support thanks to Levitate and its ability to handle threats like Garchomp, Dragonite, and Mamoswine with Strange Steam and Will-O-Wisp as well as remove entry hazards thanks to Defog. Toxapex completes the Regenerator core while also handling high-powered physical attacks from the likes of Scizor, Chien-Pao, and Ceruledge. Alolan Muk handles Ghost- and Psychic-type threats attempting to overwhelm Galarian Slowking like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Latias with Knock Off. Overqwil, with its far higher physical bulk and Intimidate, checks physical Ghost- and Psychic-type threats such as Ceruledge and Iron Boulder and sets Spikes to make Galarian Slowking's answers, Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra, take considerable chip damage. Iron Moth enjoys Galarian Slowking's ability to handle Heatran, which allows it to deal with the Steel-types like Corviknight and Gholdengo that would otherwise sit on Galarian Slowking and use its lacking Flamethrower as setup bait, along with melting Chien-Pao and Iron Treads if it is using a Choice Scarf. Salazzle similarly appreciates the removal of Heatran and helps out Galarian Slowking by inflicting Toxic onto special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Alolan Muk with Corrosion, putting them on timers. Glimmora provides similar Toxic support with Corrosion while also setting entry hazards, chipping at switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Ting-Lu, and Hisuian Goodra when they come to stop Galarian Slowking.</p>"

Rapid Spin provides support by removing hazards, allowing teammates like Lokix, Slither Wing, and Kleavor to come in safely. Gyro Ball hits Rock- and Ice-types like Iron Boulder, Ogerpon-C, Alolan Ninetales, and Chien-Pao. Finally, Volt Switch provides safe entry for its teammates thanks to Forretress's low Speed, while Body Press makes use of Forretress's high Defense to put offensive pressure on Steel-types such as Kingambit and Excadrill. Forretress prefers holding Rocky Helmet, which provides chip to contact attackers like Roaring Moon and Sneasler, thanks to its solid Defense. Alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots allows Forretress to safely come in and spin, which pairs well with Sturdy, and Leftovers provides healing, allowing Fortress to stick around longer.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kleavor complements Forretress with Stone Axe by providing Stealth Rock, along with checking Fire- and Flying-type threats including Volcarona, Ogerpon-H, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T. Araquanid, thanks to its powerful Water-type STAB moves, can similarly threaten Fire-types like Heatran, Cinderace, and Iron Moth, along with foes trying to burn Forretress such as Galarian Weezing and Skeledirge. Scizor, with Forretress, creates a Steel-type backbone for Bug teams, with Scizor helping to deal with Rock- and Ice-type threats such as Glimmora, Minior, and Kyurem, which can overwhelm Forretress otherwise. Lokix, thanks to its Dark-type STAB moves, can deal with Ghost-types attempting to stop Rapid Spin like Gholdengo, Pecharunt, and Sinistcha.

Skarmory and Corviknight both provide a Ground immunity for Steel teams, and their physical bulk coupled with access to Iron Defense and Body Press allows them to wall out physical attackers and sweepers such as Choice Scarf Hoopa-U and Barraskewda. Corviknight also removes hazards for Scizor via Defog. Scizor is easily forced out by Fire-types such as Volcarona and Skeledirge. Hence, Heatran makes for a great partner, as it walls those Fire-types thanks to Flash Fire, and it is also able to handle walls Scizor struggles with such as Amoonguss. In return, Scizor deals with Water-types that Heatran struggles with like Gastrodon and Swampert. Hisuian Goodra is a great teammate that can cover Scizor against special attackers like Choice Scarf Heatran and Choice Specs Greninja. Choice Scarf users like Gholdengo and Iron Treads provide speed control, with Gholdengo handling Hex Dragapult while Iron Treads removes Choice Specs Iron Moth. In return, Gholdengo appreciates Scizor removing Kingambit, while Iron Treads appreciates the removal of Iron Valiant.

Swords Dance allows Scizor to OHKO the likes of Dragapult and Cyclizar. Technician-boosted Bullet Punch is Scizor's most spammable attack, serving as a priority STAB move to revenge kill sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Flutter Mane. Close Combat answers Steel teams and threaten slower walls like Ting-Lu and Corviknight. Trailblaze allows Scizor to outspeed threats like Great Tusk and Hydreigon at +1 Speed and hits Quagsire and Gastrodon. Fury Cutter provides an additional Technician-boosted STAB move and is mainly used in tandem with Metronome to break Dondozo. Thief offers coverage and allows Life Orb Scizor to answer Gholdengo and 2HKO Skeledirge thanks to the boost from Technician, though Life Orb isn't recommended outside of these scenarios. Alternatively, Metal Coat enhances the power of Bullet Punch without drawbacks. The EV spread maximizes Scizor's damage output and allows it to outspeed uninvested Rotom forms and Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>Volcarona is the perfect partner for Scizor, as it's less threatened by Fire-types and can sweep through most Steel, Psychic, and Ground teams. It takes care of Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Klefki; in return, Scizor handles Rock-types like Glimmora and Lycanroc-D and weakens the opposing team to facilitate Volcarona's late-game sweep. Slither Wing offers great coverage against types that Scizor struggles to beat, threatening Electric- and Rock-types with Earthquake, Flying- and Water-types with Wild Charge, and Steel-types with Flare Blitz or Close Combat. Similar to Scizor, Lokix gets two powerful STAB priority moves in First Impression and Sucker Punch which, paired with Tinted Lens, allow it to OHKO faster threats like Greninja, Gengar, and Kilowattrel after chip damage. These priority moves, along with Masquerain's Sticky Web support, allow Bug teams to compensate for their generally slower Speed tier. Another good partner to Scizor is Guts Heracross, which can sponge status moves targeting its teammates and sweep through teams that have been weakened by Scizor. With its combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball, Vivillon can take out threats that give Bug teams trouble, particularly Dondozo. Rabsca and Forretress provide substantial support; Rabsca's Revival Blessing offers Scizor a second chance at breaking down the opponent's team, while Forretress's entry hazard stacking and Rapid Spin combination allows its teammates to switch in more safely and make holes in the opposing team.</p>"

Furthermore, Heracross faces direct competition for its role from Life Orb Slither Wing, which also has U-turn and has access to reliable recovery. Heracross is also outclassed by other physical attackers like Scizor and Lokix, both possessing crucial priority options, with Scizor also being more adept at handling Rock and Fairy teams.

Facade complements Close Combat by targeting Flying-, Fairy-, and Poison-types, outright OHKOing Gliscor and Primarina at +2 and OHKOing Galarian Weezing and Toxapex at +2 after minimal chip damage. Knock Off threatens Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gholdengo and Slowbro, and it removes Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from the aforementioned walls, wearing them down, which is especially helpful if Heracross opts to use Trailblaze as its fourth move. Trailblaze allows Heracross to outspeed faster foes like Ogerpon formes, Latios, and Choice Scarf Heatran, making it an excellent late-game cleaner. However, without Swords Dance, Heracross struggles to break walls like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Iron Defense Skarmory.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kleavor is an essential teammate, serving as a revenge killer and utilizing its Rock typing to eliminate pesky Fire- and Flying-types like Ogerpon-H, Gouging Fire, Tornadus-T, and Dragonite, which pose a serious threat to Bug teams, while simultaneously setting Stealth Rock with Stone Axe. Araquanid provides Sticky Web support, which allows Heracross to outspeed would-be faster foes like the Ogerpon formes, Dragapult, and, when at +1, even Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada and Greninja. Araquanid can also take advantage of its superb special bulk and Fire resistance provided by Water Bubble to take on Fire-types like Volcarona and Iron Moth. Additionally, Araquanid can use Mirror Coat to get a surprise OHKO on foes like Choice Specs Latios and Flutter Mane. Scizor and Lokix cover Heracross's weaknesses; Scizor eliminates Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, while Lokix threatens Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios and Dragapult; both teammates also deal with faster Rock-types like Iron Boulder and Ogerpon-C, which Heracross might struggle against. In return, Heracross can handle physical walls like Archaludon, Toxapex, and Mandibuzz. Forretress sets entry hazards, provides safe entry to Heracross with its slow Volt Switch, and removes hazards with Rapid Spin. Heracross's ability to break through special walls like Alolan Muk, Heatran, and Hisuian Goodra is greatly appreciated by teammates like Volcarona and Frosmoth.

Skarmory's incredible defense stat, alongside its phenomenal defensive typing, allows it to check some of the most threatening physically oriented offensive threats in the tier such as Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, Sneasler, and Excadrill. Skarmory thrives by setting Spikes in front of Pokemon that can't touch it and have to switch out to make progress. Iron Defense allows Skarmory to remain on an even playing field if opposing setup sweepers such as Iron Defense Zamazenta and Dragonite attempt to set up. Body Press deals huge damage to opposing Steel-, Dark-, and Ice-type Pokemon such as Kingambit, Iron Treads, Chien-Pao, Hisuian Samurott, and Mamoswine. Rocky Helmet allows Skarmory to deal more passive damage to physical threats such as Kingambit and Iron Hands, as well as dissuading the use of pivot moves like U-turn and Flip Turn.</p> <p>Skarmory's Spikes support is greatly appreciated by offensive teammates, as it allows them to have an easier time dealing with defensive staples such as Toxapex, Archaludon, Ursaluna-B, and Dondozo. Swords Dance Kingambit is able to have an easier time dealing with defensive staples such as Toxapex, Swampert, and Alolan Muk, as the entry hazard damage makes it very difficult for them to switch in. Choice Scarf Gholdengo also pairs nicely with Skarmory, as it can block both Defog and Rapid Spin, ensuring that Spikes remain on the field. Gholdengo can also deal with Flutter Mane and mixed mttacking Iron Valiant, two threats to Skarmory. In return, Skarmory is able to deal with Gholdengo's counters in Chien-Pao, Excadrill, and Kingambit. Archaludon is another great teammate for Skarmory, as the two form a threatening entry hazard-stacking core with Archaludon's Stealth Rock. Archaludon also handles physical Fire-type attackers such as Hisuian Arcanine and Ogerpon-H that Skarmory struggles with, as well as handling Dragon-type Pokemon via Draco Meteor. Iron Treads is able to switch into Electric-type attacks that would otherwise make quick work of Skarmory, as well as being able to remove hazards via Rapid Spin. Iron Treads is also capable of beating mixed Garchomp and Landorus. Air Balloon Heatran and Skarmory form a nice pair, as Heatran can switch into Fire-type attacks, while Skarmory can switch into Ground-type attacks to preserve Heatran. Heatran aids greatly in the Steel mirror match by taking out Gholdengo while also providing additional hazard support with Stealth Rock. Empoleon is capable of switching in to protect Skarmory from Fire- and Water-type attacks. Empoleon also has the additional benefit of being able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the opposing team with Knock Off. Additionally, Empoleon can use Flip Turn to get Skarmory in safely, provide additional hazard support via Stealth Rock, and recover HP with Roost. Hisuian Goodra is another great special wall, able to switch into Electric-type attacks that would otherwise make quick work of Skarmory. Hisuian Goodra is also capable of removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes thanks to Knock Off. Additionally, Hisuian Goodra has a wide array of moves that make it capable of beating potent special attackers such as Dragapult, Landorus, and Gholdengo. Other sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor, Lucario, and Iron Crown are all excellent teammates for Skarmory, as the extra damage from entry hazards goes a long way.</p>"

Iron Defense allows it to comfortably shrug off hits from threats like Iron Hands, Zamazenta, and Baxcalibur. Spikes and Stealth Rock pressure threats like Gholdengo, Raging Bolt, and Toxapex, with the former being used if another teammate is running Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Gliscor serves as an excellent partner for Skarmory, being able to effortlessly handle incoming Electric-type attacks from the likes of Regieleki and Sandy Shocks along with dealing with powerful Fire-type types like Gouging Fire, Heatran, and Ceruledge; additionally, Gliscor can run a Swords Dance set if Skarmory is running Stealth Rock. Corviknight complements Skarmory incredibly well as a special wall to deal with threatening special attacks from the likes of Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Kyurem along with using Defog to give Skarmory safe entry. Articuno with its high special bulk serves as solid deterrence to threatening special attackers such as Greninja, Dragapult, and Keldeo. Gyarados, thanks to its Water typing, Intimidate, and phazing tools can deter threats such as Gouging Fire, Ceruledge, Chien-Pao, and Barraskewda. Landorus's Ground typing and high offensive stats make it an excellent threat against notable Electric-, Fire-, and Poison-types such as Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Toxapex.

Zapdos serves as a solid Electric neutrality along with threatening out opposing bulky Flying-types like Corviknight, Moltres, and Skarmory as well as Water-types like Urshifu-R and Pelipper. Tornadus-T can handle the Ogerpon formes with its Hurricane and remove HeavyDuty Boots from threats like Amoonguss and Sableye with Knock Off, making Skarmory's Spikes even more potent. Mandibuzz gives a solid Ghost resistance against threats like Dragapult and Ceruledge and can also use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots.

Draco Meteor is an incredibly powerful STAB attack, outright OHKOing the vast majority of Dragon-types and dealing massive neutral damage to other Water-type switch-ins such as Ogerpon-W and Volcanion, both of which are OHKOed after minimal chip damage. Dragon Pulse is a more spammable STAB move that's especially useful for cleaning up weakened teams thanks to its excellent neutral coverage; it's also powerful enough to KO many opposing Dragon-types, such as Latios and Roaring Moon, without prior chip damage, letting Kingdra avoid the exploitable Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor. Surf is the default choice of Water-type STAB move for its reliability, boasting perfect accuracy and still being boosted to obscene levels by rain and Choice Specs; however, Hydro Pump is also quite useful for its extra power against specific targets. For instance, Hydro Pump in rain will always OHKO Kingambit and Choice Specs Flutter Mane as well as 2HKO Articuno and Slowbro, while Surf will never do the same. Hydro Pump is valuable enough that it can viably be run alongside Surf, but the last moveslot has other useful options as well: Hurricane is a useful tool against Grass-types like Amoonguss, Meowscarada, and Ogerpon-W, OHKOing all three after Stealth Rock without incurring the exploitable Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor. Flip Turn is another useful option to pivot out against walls like Blissey and Toxapex, giving Kingdra's teammates easy entry against them. A Timid nature is the default choice for Kingdra, letting it outspeed Regieleki and fast Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada and Roaring Moon in rain, but Modest is a viable option if these threats are sufficiently covered on the defensive side, and a Modest Kingdra is still fast enough to outspeed most Choice Scarf users in rain, notably getting the jump on Latias.</p> <p>Pelipper is a mandatory teammate for Kingdra, as Kingdra is a fairly mediocre attacker outside of rain. Pelipper's U-turn is also great for pivoting into Kingdra and its other powerful teammates. Several types, such as Normal, Dragon, Psychic, and Ground, rely solely on dedicated special walls like Blissey, Hisuian Goodra, Galarian Slowking, and Water Absorb Clodsire to prevent a Kingdra sweep, so teammates that can deal with these Pokemon are great assets to it. Swords Dance Urshifu-R is a standout example, threatening all of these walls with its powerful Close Combat and coverage options; it can also help deal with Kingambit, which threatens to beat Kingdra in an endgame scenario. Swords Dance Ogerpon-W is another great setup sweeper that can also lure Toxapex and Clodsire with Zen Headbutt, making it far easier for Kingdra to clean up after it. On extremely aggressive rain teams, Barraskewda is potentially useful to form a double Swift Swim core with Kingdra, beating the aforementioned special walls with its powerful Choice Band-boosted attacks; it especially enjoys Kingdra being able to annihilate Grass-types with Hurricane or a Dragon-type move. Stealth Rock support is a must-have for Kingdra, as many of its important damage benchmarks rely on its chip damage. Swampert and Empoleon are both reliable Stealth Rock setters that also provide a ton of defensive utility: the former threatens Poison-type walls and reduces the pressure on Kingdra to deal with Electric-types, and the latter switches into Fairy-type revenge killers like Flutter Mane and Alolan Ninetales for it. Both of these Pokemon can also use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from common walls like Toxapex, and their access to Flip Turn lets them pivot into Kingdra easily. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is a welcome teammate for Kingdra thanks to its great coverage and utility; Ceaseless Edge generates entry hazard pressure and scares Galarian Slowking, Knock Off removes Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from various walls, and Sacred Sword threatens problematic Kingdra checks like Kingambit, Blissey, and Hisuian Goodra. While having a Choice Scarf user alongside a Swift Swim user may seem redundant, it's useful as a backup form of speed control for when rain isn't active. Since Kingdra has a tendency to get worn down by hazards if the game doesn't wrap up quickly, Rain Dish Tentacruel can be a useful teammate for the Rapid Spin support it provides, and its excellent special bulk also makes it a great answer to threats like Flutter Mane and Hydrapple. Although it's hard to fit and shares some checks with Kingdra, Choice Specs Greninja is a massive threat that's helpful for overloading special walls alongside it, threatening to 2HKO Clodsire and Galarian Slowking with Ice Beam and Dark Pulse, respectively, and it can put major pressure on Fairy-types like Clefable and Azumarill with Sludge Wave.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Porygon2 is an amazing physical wall on Normal teams due to its good bulk and access to Eviolite. Discharge threatens Flying- and Water-types like Corviknight, Gyarados, and Barraskewda. Ice Beam checks Ground-, Flying-, and Dragon-types like the Landorus-T, Dragonite, and Garchomp. Foul Play is a great anti-setup move that dissuades physical sweepers like Scizor, Ceruledge, and the Ogerpon formes from setting up. Substitute can be run over Foul Play, as it allows Porygon2 to block status from Toxapex and Amoonguss while also protecting itself from incoming threats like Great Tusk or Keldeo. However, doing so will make Porygon2 vulnerable into setup sweepers like Ogerpon-H and Gouging Fire due to not having Foul Play. Trace is the ideal ability for Porygon2 to copy Regenerator and Poison Heal from Toxapex and Gliscor, respectively. Trace also allows Porygon2 to copy Sword of Ruin, which helps it take hits from Chien-Pao better. Download can be run over Trace to make Porygon2 a bulky wallbreaker, making it notably effective in the Flying matchup by taking out Corviknight and Skarmory with ease.</p> <p>Blissey is the ideal partner for Porygon2, forming a strong defensive core by providing a switch-in to special threats like Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Specs Greninja, while also spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave. Blissey also provides utility in setting up Stealth Rock. Braviary provides entry hazard removal with Defog for Porygon2 while also checking Sneasler, Ogerpon-W, and Breloom with Brave Bird. In return, Porygon2 deals with Iron Boulder and Ceruledge for Braviary with Foul Play. Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a nice teammate due to its Fighting immunity, and it can threaten important targets like Urshifu-R, Gholdengo, non-Choice Scarf Heatran, and Pecharunt with Shadow Ball and Focus Blast. Calm Mind Ursaluna-B is a great wallbreaker, KOing defensive threats like Galarian Weezing, Gouging Fire, and Heatran at +1. Ursaluna-B is also a Knock Off absorber for Porygon2 due its bulk and access to Moonlight. Choice Scarf Indeedee is a great revenge killer, taking out Fighting- and Poison-types like mixed Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Clodsire, and it can use Healing Wish to bring Porygon2 back to full health if it gets weakened. Ditto becomes a great reverse sweeper for Porygon2 by transforming into sweepers like Gouging Fire and Chien-Pao. Cinccino not only removes hazards and boosts its stats with Tidy Up, but also threatens a lot of specially bulky Pokemon with Bullet Seed, Rock Blast, and Triple Axel for Porygon2, most notably Articuno and Swampert. Cinccino can also run a Choice Band set to potentially wallbreak, letting it OHKO Clodsire with Triple Axel. Terapagos can run an offensive utility set with Rapid Spin for Porygon2, but it can also become a fierce setup sweeper with Calm Mind and Tera Starstorm. Terapagos notably threatens Steel-types like Excadrill and Heatran with Earth Power, which Porygon2 appreciates.</p>"

Ceaseless Edge and Stone Axe are able to set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, ignoring Magic Bounce from Hatterene. Sticky Web support is the driving force behind hyper offensive Normal teams, as the Speed reduction greatly helps its powerful wallbreakers such as Terapagos and Ursaluna. Spore, in tandem with Focus Sash, allows Smeargle to immobilize a foe for a few turns, giving Smeargle an opportunity to set up hazards.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark is a great teammate for Smeargle, as its Ghost typing blocks Rapid Spin; it also appreciates the wide range of entry hazards Smeargle can provide, which aids its wallbreaking capabilities. With Sticky Web set up, Hisuian Zoroark is able to outspeed Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, stopping them from revenge killing it. Terapagos is another incredibly strong wallbreaking teammate that thrives with entry hazard support. Tera Starstorm turns from a 3HKO to a 2HKO on Pokemon such as Clodsire and Swampert. Terapagos also has a lot of great coverage moves, such as Earth Power for Steel- and Fire-types like Heatran and Ceruledge and Ice Beam for Flying-types such as Landorus and Gliscor. Braviary is a strong physical attacker that takes advantage of Smeargle's Sticky Web support, as its Defiant ability punishes Defog. Indeedee is also a great teammate, as its Psychic-type support helps greatly in the Poison and Fighting matchups. Psychic Terrain also protects its teammates against priority moves, blocking foes such as Kingambit and Scizor from revenge killing setup sweepers. Ditto can take advantage of Sticky Web, having an easier time coming in for revenge kills against Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada and Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With the highest HP stat in all of Pokemon, an extremely impressive Special Defense stat, and access to important utility moves, Blissey is one of the best special walls in the entire tier, as well as being Normal's best Stealth Rock setter. Seismic Toss is the best move for Blissey to deal consistent damage and not be a completely passive Pokemon despite being ineffective against Ghost-types. Shadow Ball can be used over Seismic Toss in order to not be completely useless against Ghost-types. Stealth Rock helps Blissey's offensive teammates like Ursaluna and Maushold have an easier time getting KOs. Thunder Wave is used to slow down opposing Pokemon so that Blissey's slower, wallbreaking teammates, such as Ursaluna, have an easier time making progress. Alternatively, Healing Wish can be used over Thunder Wave in order to heal one of Blissey's teammates to full health, gaining momentum and making an end-game sweep easier.</p> <p>Wallbreakers like Ursaluna and Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark are great teammates for Blissey, as they are capable of dealing with the defensive Pokemon that Blissey is unable to beat, such as Sableye, Toxapex, and Dondozo. In return, Blissey can switch into attacks to keep the wallbreakers safe. Ditto and Blissey make a great pair, as, thanks to Natural Cure, Blissey is able to switch in to status moves that would otherwise cripple Ditto, such as Will-O-Wisp from Sableye, Skeledirge, and Rotom-W, as well as Thunder Wave from Gholdengo, then get rid of the status via Natural Cure. Ditto is also capable of dealing with setup sweepers that would otherwise threaten Blissey such as Baxcalibur and Dragonite. Thunder Wave is also a great option to use on opposing Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant and Meowscarada so Ditto will not have to worry about Speed ties. Hisuian Zoroark is a great teammate for Blissey, as the immunity to Fighting-type moves is extremely valuable. Hisuian Zoroark is also able to burn opposing physical threats like Urshifu-R and Dragonite, which would otherwise make quick work of Blissey, as well as dealing with Ghost-type Pokemon which Blissey cannot damage without Shadow Ball. Hisuian Zoroark's Knock Off can also help Blissey wear down targets by making them vulnerable to entry hazards and removing Leftovers and Black Sludge recovery. Moreover, Hisuian Zoroark can disguise itself as Blissey and catch foes such as Iron Hands, Zamazenta and Sneasler off guard. Cyclizar is a good teammate for Blissey, as Blissey can switch into the fast special attackers that would otherwise threaten Cyclizar such as Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Walking Wake. Cyclizar also carries Knock Off, which, as mentioned previously, works well with Blissey. Choice Specs Cyclizar outspeeds and threatens to OHKO non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, which would otherwise threaten Blissey, with Hyper Voice. Finally, Braviary and Staraptor can function as alternative switch-ins to Fighting-type Pokemon like Quaquaval and Great Tusk and retaliate with their STAB-boosted Brave Bird. Braviary uses Defog to keep Blissey and teammates safe from hazards, while Staraptor is a more offensive Choice Scarf user able to threaten Fighting-type Pokemon.</p>"

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune is generally outclassed as a Calm Mind user—offensively by Keldeo and defensively at times by Primarina. Keldeo requires less setup, becoming immediately threatening at +1 with Secret Sword and Vacuum Wave, while Primarina boasts a better defensive typing, which is valuable in Dragon and Fighting matchups. With Draining Kiss and Psychic Noise, Primarina can also more proactively handle threats like Zamazenta and Clodsire. However, Suicune is overall bulkier than these two options, and Pressure, combined with Substitute and Protect, makes it an extremely frustrating defensive win condition, stalling out Pokemon reliant on low-PP moves like Latios, Gholdengo, and Sneasler.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Suicune is a terrifying defensive win condition due to its sheer bulk, coupled with Scald's burn chance, allowing Suicune to whittle down Flying, Steel, and Fighting teams lacking Pokemon that 2HKO it. Protect and Substitute allow Suicune to scout and PP stall foes, and when paired with Pressure, it can achieve seemingly impossible feats, such as depleting Bleakwind Storm, Luster Purge, Seismic Toss, and Earthquake from Tornadus-T, Latios, Blissey, and Clodsire, respectively. Scald is preferred due to the burn chance, massively reducing the number of physical attackers that can come in to overwhelm Suicune before it accrues too many boosts. For instance, if Iron Hands gets burned, its Thunder Punch will not be able to break Suicune's Substitute in one hit. The given EV spread provides Suicune enough bulk for its Substitute not to break in one hit against Earthquake from Gliscor or fixed damage moves such as Seismic Toss or Night Shade. 216 Speed EVs lets it outspeed Adamant Mamoswine, OHKOing it with Scald after Stealth Rock damage and a Calm Mind boost.</p> <p>As Suicune is reliant on Leftovers for recovery, it is ruined by Toxic Spikes. Hence, Poison-types such as Toxapex and Tentacruel are a must-have due to their ability to passively remove them. Toxapex also checks setup sweepers that can overwhelm Suicune, such as Iron Defense Zamazenta and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire, while Tentacruel is able to spin away other entry hazards to preserve Suicune's health. Greninja deals with the Ogerpon formes and Sinistcha that overwhelm Suicune and can use a Choice Scarf set to deal with runaway setup sweepers like Hisuian Lilligant, Trailblaze Ogerpon-H, and Scale Shot Garchomp. Electric-immune teammates such as Gastrodon and Swampert are useful for dealing with Choice Specs users locked into Thunderbolt such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult that do too much damage against Suicune; they also can set up entry hazards to chip down Suicune's checks. These teammates, in turn, benefit from Suicune's ability to scout the next move, preventing them from taking unnecessary damage from the coverage moves of these threats. Empoleon checks Kyurem and Hatterene and sets Stealth Rock. Swords Dance Hisuian Samurott also sets entry hazards with Ceaseless Edge and cleans up opposing teams after Suicune has worn them down. Walking Wake is decent for dealing with Dragon-types like Gouging Fire and Hydrapple, which use Suicune as setup fodder and tears up Fire teams with its Protosynthesis-boosted Hydro Steam.</p>"

A specially attacking Tyranitar with Fire Blast, Earth Power, and Ice Beam can be viable, as it catches switch-ins and general nuisances to Rock teams like Skarmory, Archaludon, and Gliscor off-guard. However, Tyranitar has to then use a more offensive EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Mild or Modest nature, which lets Choice Specs Flutter Mane OHKO it with Moonblast. Alternatively, an EV spread for a specially attacking Tyranitar of 16 HP / 236 SpA / 92 SpD / 164 Spe lets it survive an attack from Choice Specs Flutter Mane while still outspeeding Kingambit, but this leaves it outsped and easily OHKOed by Archaludon's Body Press.</p>",

Knock Off allows Tyranitar to remove crucial items from physically bulky threats such as Archaludon, Toxapex, and Skarmory, along with threatening Ghost- and Psychic-types like Ceruledge and Espathra. The given EV Spread allows Tyranitar to outspeed Adamant Kingambit while maximizing its special bulk to survive two Moonblasts from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Tyranitar greatly appreciates the support of Choice Scarf Iron Boulder, which can deal with Fighting-types such as Sneasler, Iron Valiant, and Breloom, along with handling faster threats like Ogerpon-H and Enamorus. Hisuian Arcanine handles Grass- and Steel-type threats such as Amoonguss, Scizor, and Corviknight. Ogerpon-C can check problematic Water- and Ground-types such as Keldeo, Swampert, and the Landorus formes while appreciating Tyranitar's sand to help it set up in front of special attackers like Hydrapple and Primarina. Glimmora provides support by removing entry hazards with Mortal Spin, along with being able to use a Choice Scarf to handle threats such as Iron Valiant with Sludge Wave and Great Tusk with Energy Ball. Rhyperior appreciates Tyranitar's sand patching up its Special Defense and allowing it to take hits such as Landorus's Earth Power; in return, Rhyperior leverages its bulk to remove threats like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Excadrill. Both Minior and Garganacl majorly appreciate Tyranitar setting up sand and Stealth Rock, providing them with safety as they set up.

Mirror Coat can grab a surprise OHKO on problematic targets like Flutter Mane, but its reliance on prediction makes it inconsistent. Heavy-Duty Boots can be worthwhile on some teams, since Swampert struggles against some Spikes-stacking teams like Flying and Poison, but this leaves it without any recovery and thus more easily worn down by direct damage.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot (Water)": {
        "description": "<p>Swampert is the best offensive Stealth Rock setter available to Water teams thanks to its great bulk and access to Flip Turn. Its partial Ground typing is also excellent, granting it an Electric immunity which notably lets it block Volt Switch from common threats such as Zapdos, Iron Treads, and Iron Hands. STAB Earthquake strikes fear into the heart of bulky Pokemon that often annoy Water such as Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Gouging Fire while boasting decent neutral damage even with low investment. Alternatively, Earth Power deals less neutral damage but allows Swampert to lure annoying physical tanks like Archaludon, Torkoal, and Pecharunt and surprise them with a 2HKO. Flip Turn allows Swampert to pivot out of common switch-ins like Amoonguss, Skarmory, and Latios and act as a pivot for frailer teammates. Flip Turn's damage also shouldn't be underestimated; boosts from it being a STAB move, rain, and potentially Torrent can make it a nasty parting gift. As an example, a Flip Turn with all of those multipliers active has a chance to OHKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock. Swampert can set up Stealth Rock itself, providing critical entry hazard support for a type with somewhat limited options for the role; this also lets it break Focus Sash on major threats that use it such as Breloom. Since its STAB combination is excellent on its own, Swampert is free to run a utility move of choice in the last moveslot: Roar lets it rack up passive damage against the opposing team after setting up Stealth Rock and phaze some setup sweepers that it can't threaten to KO, such as Calm Mind Primarina and IronPress Skarmory. Protect lets Swampert make the most of Leftovers recovery while scouting Choice item users such as Choice Band Chien-Pao and Choice Specs Flutter Mane, making them easier to play around. Knock Off gives Swampert extra coverage against foes like Latios and lets it remove Heavy-Duty Boots from its switch-ins, forcing them to take Stealth Rock damage and thus making them easier to outlast. The given EV spread maximizes Swampert's ability to take special hits, achieving such feats as avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Specs Iron Valiant's Moonblast after Stealth Rock and surviving 4x super effective hits like Hydrapple's Giga Drain. 24 Attack EVs guarantee that Earthquake will always 2HKO Garganacl after Stealth Rock damage, as well as OHKO Excadrill, and 2HKO bulky Gouging Fire. On Earth Power sets, use a Calm nature and move the Attack EVs into Special Attack.</p> <p>Since its typing and Stealth Rock make it universally useful to Water, Swampert is highly flexible in what teams it can fit on. Swords Dance Ogerpon-W is a quintessential teammate that enjoys entry hazard support to wear down its checks before a sweep. Empoleon is great for checking Grass-type attackers that threaten Swampert, like Amoonguss and Abomasnow, and discouraging Freeze-Dry spam from Kyurem and Alolan Ninetales; its STAB Flash Cannon also threatens Hatterene and Galarian Weezing, both of which can frustrate Swampert's attempts to set up Stealth Rock. Toxapex is an even sturdier Grass-type check that can deal with Meowscarada and Ogerpon formes, and it stacks hazards with Swampert in the form of Toxic Spikes. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott can check some threats that annoy Swampert like Slowbro, Latios, and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also contributing Spikes. Calm Mind Primarina is a potent wincon that can deal with offensive Dark- and Dragon-types like Chien-Pao and Dragonite, which tend to overwhelm Swampert, and it enjoys Swampert pressuring common special walls, most notably Clodsire. Choice Specs Greninja especially can tear massive holes in the opposing team with help from Swampert's Stealth Rock, and its coverage threatens common hazard-control options like Hatterene, Great Tusk, and Brambleghast. Keldeo can threaten some Rapid Spin users that Swampert has trouble with like Great Tusk, Avalugg, and Alolan Sandslash, and it enjoys Flip Turn support to hit the field safely; other frail offensive threats like Greninja, Barraskewda, and Cloyster love Swampert's reliable ability to pivot as well. Other pivots like Rotom-W, Pelipper, Barraskewda, and Urshifu-R can form an oppressive VoltTurn core with Swampert, continuously wearing down foes in conjunction with entry hazards. Volcanion can punish Grass- and Ice-types similarly to Empoleon while discouraging Corviknight and Forretress from spending a turn on hazard removal with its Fire-type STAB move.</p>"

Roost allows Pelipper to come in multiple times throughout the match to re-set rain if need be. U-turn let's it slow pivot into threats such as Quaquaval and Barraskewda. Knock Off cripples foes, while Surf gives a secondary STAB move boosted by rain, allowing Pelipper to wear down Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to switch in and set rain even if Stealth Rock is up. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 48 Def / 212 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Breloom.</p> <p>Barraskewda is the obvious partner choice thanks to its ridiculous Speed with Swift Swim in rain. It also appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting with U-turn due to its lack of bulk. Walking Wake is another great rain attacker, since its STAB Dragon-type moves hit most Water-resistant and immune foes, such as opposing Gastrodon and Amoonguss, hard. Quaquaval appreciates Pelipper's slow pivoting to come in safely and can potentially snowball through teams with rain-boosted Aqua Step and Moxie. Quaquaval can also get rid of entry hazards should Pelipper get hit by Knock Off, provided it has Rapid Spin. Gastrodon and Quagsire are also really good partners thanks to their Electric immunities. Both also provide entry hazards, pressuring opponents, and Pelipper can use hazard removal turns to pivot out with U-turn or heal with Roost. Rotom-W can form a VoltTurn core with Pelipper, allowing the team to gain momentum easily and bring in Pokemon fairly safely. Rotom-W can also switch into opposing Electric-types like Magnezone, Iron Hands, and Sandy Shocks if necessary. Toxapex provides a Fighting resistance, a Grass neutrality, and another pivot thanks to its ability, Regenerator. Slowking checks threats such as Indeedee and Walking Wake, and it's another slow pivot thanks to Chilly Reception and Regenerator, bringing Pelipper in safely to set the rain. Both Toxapex and Slowking can also easily pivot into Pelipper with Eject Button, since Regenerator means they won't lose too much health from an attack. Azumarill can take advantage of rain with priority in Aqua Jet, as well as bringing a very strong Water-type STAB move.</p>"

Indeedee is immune to Ghost and sets Psychic Terrain for the team, which boosts the power of Gardevoir's Psychic-type moves and protects it from priority moves from Pokemon like Scizor and Kingambit. Gardevoir also forms a wallbreaking core with Choice Scarf Iron Boulder, allowing Gardevoir to handle foes like Archaludon and Skarmory, while Iron Boulder deals with foes like Gouging Fire, Hisuian Goodra, and Choice Specs Flutter Mane. Deoxys-S is an incredible partner for Gardevoir, as it can set Spikes to boost Gardevoir's wallbreaking potential and use Teleport to grant it safe entry. Latios and Latias form a wallbreaking core with Gardevoir, with Latias providing additional aid through Healing Wish, which allows Gardevoir to battle at full potential once again. Espathra is a late-game sweeper that complements Gardevoir role as a wallbreaker.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Breloom fulfills a variety of roles for Fighting teams, with Spore immobilizing threats like Corviknight, Pelipper, and Toxapex and operates as a revenge killer with Mach Punch. Swords Dance further boosts its great Attack and lets Breloom take advantage of forcing foes out after they have been afflicted with Spore to set up. Bulldoze can be used in place of Spore or Swords Dance to handle Poison-types that would otherwise give it problems like Okidogi and Toxapex. However, Spore and Swords Dance are usually preferred, since the former grants Breloom great utility while the latter can potentially turn it into a setup sweeper. Bullet Seed is a strong STAB move that threatens Ground-types like Clodsire and Great Tusk as well as breaking Ogerpon-C's Sturdy and OHKOing it outright after a Swords Dance boost. Mach Punch, when boosted with Swords Dance, turns Breloom into a setup sweeper, taking on faster threats like Hoopa-U, Chien-Pao, and Excadrill.</p> <p>Offensive Great Tusk is one of Breloom's best teammates, as it sets up Stealth Rock to bolster Breloom's breaking and sweeping capabilities, removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin to preserve Breloom's Focus Sash, and handles sun teams thanks to Protosynthesis. In return, Breloom handles Water-types that threaten Great Tusk such as Greninja and Primarina. Keldeo and Urshifu-R not only handle Fire-types like Heatran and Ceruledge, but Keldeo also outpaces and threatens non-Choice Scarf Landorus, while Urshifu-R can revenge kill weakened sweepers and cleaners like Volcarona, Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane with Aqua Jet. Choice Scarf Sneasler and Assault Vest Iron Hands make for great teammates, as they handle Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Enamorus for Breloom thanks to their great special bulk and, in the case of the former, its Poison typing. Additionally, Sneasler can potentially spread status with a combination of Poison Touch and Dire Claw and pivot Breloom in with U-turn, while Iron Hands handles Flying-types like Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Articuno thanks to its Electric typing. Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, with its colorful coverage, threatens a multitude of pesky threats such as Dragapult, Latios, and physically defensive Gyarados. Iron Defense Zamazenta makes for another great partner, as it is a great answer to various physical setup sweepers such as Gouging Fire and Iron Hands and threatens them back with Body Press. Lastly, Breloom's wallbreaking enables sweepers like Agility Gallade and Unburden Sneasler to sweep late-game.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Breloom is a great late-game cleaner for Grass teams by virtue of its great Attack stat, access to Swords Dance to increase it further, and great ability in Technician boosting many of its attacks. Spore allows Breloom to incapacitate a threat to open up opportunities for it to set up Swords Dance. Mach Punch boosted by Technician allows Breloom to not only revenge kill fast cleaners like Meowscarada, Greninja, and Barraskewda but also sweep through teams that lack a check to it like Dark and Ice. Rock Tomb provides great coverage, targeting Fire- and Flying-types that switch in on an anticipated Bullet Seed such as Ogerpon-H, Talonflame, and Zapdos. Close Combat is more powerful than Mach Punch, making it suited for slower foes such as Archaludon, while Bulldoze allows Breloom to handle one of its biggest counters in Gholdengo. Bullet Seed is Breloom's strongest wallbreaking STAB option thanks to Technician boosting each of its hits. A Swords Dance + 3 attacks variant can be used as well to further Breloom's role as a sweeper. However, Spore is preferred, since it helps Breloom find chances to set up.</p> <p>Breloom appreciates entry hazard support from Toedscruel and Brambleghast wearing down foes, as well as breaking Ogerpon-C's Sturdy so Breloom can immediately OHKO it with Mach Punch. Additionally, the two of them provide entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin so that Breloom's Focus Sash does not break. Amoonguss is a great defensive partner that threatens Fairy-types such as Enamorus and Iron Valiant, and it can also run Spore so that Breloom can choose to run Swords Dance instead. Meowscarada appreciates Breloom immobilizing threats with Spore and removing Toxapex and Ting-Lu, and in return, it handles Ghost- and Psychic types such as Gholdengo, Sinistcha, and Latios. Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-C appreciate Breloom handling their checks such as Greninja, Barraskewda, and Ogerpon-W for them. In return, Ogerpon-H handles bulky Grass-types such as Sinistcha and Amoonguss, while Ogerpon-C threatens Flying-types such as Articuno and Moltres. Abomasnow sets up Aurora Veil to make Breloom harder to take down, allowing it to find more opportunities to set up and sweep.</p>"

Night Shade provides a consistent form of damage, preventing Sableye from being too passive, as well as letting it deal with Zamazenta one-on-one. Prankster Will-O-Wisp shuts down Physical attackers, such as Sneasler, Excadrill, and Urshifu-R, regardless of their Speed. Encore locks foes into passive moves, such as Recover and Roost, as well as setup moves such as Dragon Dance and Iron Defense, usually forcing a switch thereafter. Thunder Wave is an alternative option that can be used to slow down opposing Pokemon in order to make Dark's threatening breakers, such as Choice Specs Greninja, outspeed faster foes, such as Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus.</p> <p>Ting-Lu is a great teammate for Sableye, as it can supply a multitude of entry hazards in the form of Spikes and Stealth Rock. Coupled with Sableye's Rapid Spin immunity, some teams will have a very difficult time removing entry hazards as long as Sableye is around. Alolan Muk is another fantastic teammate for Sableye, as its Poison typing is key when it comes to dealing with Fairy-types, such as Hatterene and Primarina. Bisharp can utilize Swords Dance to help deal with bulkier Pokemon, such as Galarian Weezing and Toxapex, and pick off Flutter Mane via Sucker Punch. Bisharp can prevent hazard removal as well, as its Defiant ability will make foes think twice about using Defog. Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Greninja, Darkrai, and Hydreigon are good teammates, as are Choice Scarf Hoopa-U and Meowscarada; the pressure applied by entry hazards makes it incredibly difficult for defensive Pokemon, such as Clodsire and Archaludon, to switch in repeatedly. Furthermore, they can deal with Pokemon that Sableye is largely ineffective against, such as Hatterene, Gholdengo, and opposing Dark-types. In return, Sableye can switch in on threatening Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Skarmory, and Corviknight.</p>"

Lava Plume provides decent damage and a high chance to burn, which proves particularly useful against physical attackers like Zamazenta, Ogerpon-W, and Iron Hands. Body Press allows Torkoal to make use of its high Defense to heavily damage the likes of Kingambit, Blissey, and Tyranitar as well as preventing Roaring Moon from setting up freely and Heatran from switching in freely. Heavy-Duty Boots greatly increases Torkoal's longevity, while Heat Rock provides more turns of sun for setup allies to benefit from, such as Morning Sun Volcarona. If using Heavy-Duty Boots, getting fewer turns of sun also allows Fire teams to better manage opposing Protosynthesis sweepers, such as Flutter Mane or Walking Wake.</p> <p>Gouging Fire is an amazing teammate, as it is a near-unstoppable wallbreaker in conjunction with Torkoal’s sun and entry hazard removal support. Ogerpon-H is another excellent wallbreaker under sun that greatly threatens Water. Thanks to its ability to wallbreak past Dondozo due to Mold Breaker, Ogerpon-H pairs well with Gouging Fire, which is often stopped cold by Dondozo. Ceruledge provides valuable speed control with Shadow Sneak, allowing it to deal with troublesome threats to Fire teams such as Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Iron Boulder. These sweepers also greatly appreciate Torkoal’s Stealth Rock support. Volcarona benefits from Torkoal’s sun support, as the additional healing with sun-boosted Morning Sun and weakening of Water-type moves from Greninja and Keldeo greatly eases its ability to set up; in return, Volcarona deals with walls such as Toxapex and non-Stone Edge Zamazenta. Flame Body can also be useful to cripple threats like Great Tusk and Azumarill. Choice Scarf Iron Moth is an excellent check to Walking Wake and Great Tusk with a Speed boost from Protosynthesis; it can also be an excellent late-game cleaner against Steel and Fairy once checks such as Heatran and Primarina are removed. Cinderace can aid Torkoal in keeping off hazards with Court Change. Pyro Ball under sun also forces a lot of switches, which allows Cinderace to use U-turn to safely pivot in wallbreakers. Torkoal appreciates Rotom-H, as its Ground immunity combined with Volt Switch allows it to easily switch in for Torkoal and safely pivot in a sweeper.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Yawn can be used over Body Press to force switches, allowing Torkoal to freely bring a teammate that can benefit from sun.</p>"

Knock Off threatens Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo, Brambleghast, and Indeedee while also removing items from foes that are reliant on them like Heavy-Duty Boots from Dragonite and Leftovers from Corviknight. Bullet Punch can be run over Psychic Fangs or Knock Off to revenge kill faster threats such as Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao. However, most of Metagross's teammates provide great speed control, and running a second Steel-type STAB move on Metagross restricts its number of potential targets. Heavy Slam threatens Fairy- and Ice-types such as Hatterene, Alolan Ninetales, and Articuno. 96 Speed EVs allow Metagross to outspeed Adamant Azumarill.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Hoopa-U and Choice Specs Latios appreciate Metagross setting entry hazards to help them wallbreak.

Deoxys-S forms a hazard-stacking core with Metagross thanks to Spikes, appreciating it running Stealth Rock so it can run another utility option such as Taunt. Hatterene is a potential wincon for Psychic teams that appreciates entry hazards wearing down incoming foes such as Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Scarf Enamorus, and it is a useful asset in the Dark and Dragon matchups to deal with threats such as Sableye, Hydreigon, Garchomp, and Raging Bolt. Additionally, Hatterene provides hazard control thanks to Magic Bounce. Choice Scarf Latias appreciates Metagross taking out Fairy-types like Hatterene and Iron Valiant, and in return, it provides a Ground immunity to switch into and deal with Great Tusk and Landorus, as well as Choice-locking walls like Ting-Lu and Corviknight by giving them its Choice Scarf with Trick. Lastly, late-game sweepers such as Agility Iron Crown, Agility Gallade, and Choice Scarf Iron Boulder appreciate Metagross setting entry hazards, weakening walls with Knock Off, and revenge killing boosted sweepers with Bullet Punch to start a sweep of their own.

Bullet Punch provides a solid form of priority to deal with faster targets such as Flutter Mane, Alolan Ninetales, Weavile, and weakened Hoopa-U. Knock Off allows Metagross to force progress against targets that can otherwise handle it like Skarmory and Corviknight by removing crucial held items; it also threatens Ghost-types such as Air Balloon Gholdengo and Sinistcha. Finally, Earthquake hits Steel- and Electric-type threats like Hisuian Goodra, Magnezone, and Raging Bolt. The EV Spread used allows Metagross to outspeed Adamant Azumarill while surviving hits such as Modest +1 Raging Bolt's Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Choice Specs Latios, when paired with Metagross, forms a devastating wallbreaker core; Latios cleanly removes physical walls such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Hippowdon, while Metagross can remove threats Latios struggles against such as Hisuian Goodra, Blissey, and Flutter Mane. Deoxys-S provides solid entry hazard stacking capabilities, further increasing Metagross's wallbreaking capabilities.

Psychic allows it to take care of the many Poison-types that can trouble its teammates Dragapult and Dragonite, such as non-Choice Scarf Sneasler, Amoonguss, and Galarian Weezing. Psyshock is an alternative to more easily take care of specially defensive Clodsire as well as 2HKO Assault Vest Iron Hands after Spikes from Garchomp. Trick is another option to provide utility by crippling foes such as Kingambit, Alolan Muk, and Heatran. Lastly, with Healing Wish, Latias gains the ability to grant a second life to its teammates when it is in a pinch.

Baxcalibur is another amazing offensive partner that appreciates the removal of Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Urshifu-R as well as the likes of Porygon2 and Skarmory being hampered by Latias's Trick, letting it safely set up a Swords Dance or Dragon Dance to sweep. Gouging Fire also heavily appreciates Latias breaking down Poison teams that may disrupt it with Toxic, and in return it beats the Steel-types that wall Latias, such as Kingambit and Heatran. Latias is also able to heal Baxcalibur and Gouging Fire with Healing Wish in case they have suffered damage or status. Hisuian Goodra and Archaludon are able to easily dispatch of Fairy-types as well as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Chien-Pao, which are threatening to Dragon teams. Archaludon is also able to set Stealth Rock, allowing Latias to break through opposition more easily. Garchomp is another great partner for setting both Stealth Rock and Spikes, as well as phazing threats such as Calm Mind Ursaluna-B with Dragon Tail. Raging Bolt and Choice Specs Kyurem have a great matchup against Water and Flying teams. Raging Bolt is also able to beat Kingambit with Thunderclap.

Archaludon functions as a wonderful teammate for Latios, as it can take on Kingambit and other Dark-types like Ting-Lu with Body Press and Stamina. It also provides entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock. In return for both, Latios can switch in on Ground-type attacks, like Earthquake from the likes of Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Choice Band Excadrill, thanks to Levitate; this also allows Latios to find opportunities to fire off its strong attacks.

Luster Purge is a strong Psychic-type STAB move that can potentially 2HKO Gholdengo. Thunderbolt gives Latios coverage that takes out Flying- and Water-types such as Corviknight and Empoleon, 2HKOing the latter after a Calm Mind boost. Recover can be used over Thunderbolt to grant Latios longevity, giving it more opportunities to sweep. Ice Beam can be used as well, and it is especially effective against slower Dragon-types, such as Garchomp and Dragonite, to remove Latios's need to switch out after using Draco Meteor. Ice Beam can also surprise the likes of both Landorus formes and Gliscor.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is a great sacrificial lead by virtue of its Speed, access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and ability to prevent Defog with Taunt. Offensive variants of Deoxys-S, such as Choice Specs and Nasty Plot sets, can also clean late-game once Latios is finished wallbreaking. Hatterene can prevent entry hazards being placed thanks to Magic Bounce, and with its Fairy typing, it can switch into a predicted Dragon-type attack that would threaten Latios. Hatterene is also able to run Nuzzle to paralyze Pokemon that are faster than Latios, and it can support the team with Healing Wish. In return, Latios is able to threaten Corviknight and Empoleon with Thunderbolt. Latios gets easily outsped and forced out by faster Pokemon such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Greninja; hence, it appreciates speedy teammates that can deal with them like Choice Scarf Latias for Dragapult and Choice Scarf Iron Boulder for Meowscarada and Greninja. Gholdengo and Hatterene easily hinder any sweeping attempts from Latios, so checks to them, such as Hoopa-U and Iron Crown, make for great teammates. Choice Scarf Hoopa-U is also able to outspeed and threaten the likes of Flutter Mane and Spectrier, while Iron Crown appreciates Latios KOing Garchomp for it. Indeedee is another great teammate that provides a Ghost immunity as well as support with Healing Wish. Gallade is able to anticipate Sucker Punch from Kingambit and remove it with Upper Hand, and it can handle the likes of Hisuian Goodra, Alolan Muk, and Blissey. Slowbro and Galarian Slowking are two great defensive partners for Latios, with the former tanking attacks from Choice Band Excadrill as well as spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave so Latios outspeeds faster Pokemon. On the other hand, Galarian Slowking can wall out Iron Valiant and remove it with Sludge Bomb while acting as a slow pivot with Chilly Reception and an entry hazard setter with Toxic Spikes. Both Slowbro and Galarian Slowking can also wall Ceruledge after they use their Eject Button or Chien-Pao and Kingambit when they're using a Colbur Berry.</p>"

With Choice Specs, Latios can drop powerful Draco Meteors and pulverize foes such as Gliscor and Gouging Fire that may otherwise trouble Psychic teams. Luster Purge can punish any switch-ins to Draco Meteor and plow through the likes of defensive Articuno and Gholdengo after a Special Defense drop. Latios has a plethora of coverage options, Ice Beam lets it threaten common Ground- and Flying-type threats like specially defensive Gliscor, while Thunderbolt lets it threaten Water-types like Empoleon. Latios can utilize Aura Sphere to counter Steel-types like Kingambit and Heatran without help from teammates. Latios can also hamper the opposition with Trick, being able to cripple foes like Hisuian Goodra, Kingambit and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Latios appreciates support from Deoxys-S, being able to easily spread entry hazards and help Latios OHKO foes more easily. Alternatively, offensive Deoxys-S appreciates Latios punching holes in the opposition so that it can clean up later with its massive Speed tier. Galarian Slowking and Jirachi are great partners that can pivot Latios in with Chilly Reception and U-Turn, respectively, and take care of Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant and Hatterene that Latios is weak to. Specially defensive Jirachi can also set up Stealth Rock and pressure Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales as well as spread paralysis against the likes of Zamazenta and Greninja, allowing Latios to outspeed them. Choice Scarf Iron Boulder is a great partner that can clean up after Latios has been KOed and outspeed and threaten to OHKO other Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada, Greninja, and Iron Valiant as well as Dragon Dance +1 Gouging Fire. Choice Scarf Hoopa-U is a good partner to beat Ghost-types such as Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Assault Vest Hoopa-U can also deal with bulky Gholdengo and break apart defensive cores alongside Latios. Stored Power Espathra can act as a wincon once Latios has weakened the opposition. Gallade and Hatterene are good choices for countering Dark-types that are extremely threatening to Psychic teams such as Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Indeedee-M also notably provides a Ghost immunity alongside Healing Wish, giving Latios a second chance late-game. Eject Button Slowbro can provide a safe switch-in against Ceruledge and spread paralysis against or finish off weakened Chien-Pao and Kingambit, easing the burden on Latios.</p>"

Iron Head in conjunction with Serene Grace allows Jirachi to annoy Pokemon like Alolan Muk, Articuno, and Clefable. Body Slam punishes switch-ins like Great Tusk and Quagsire by having a notable chance to paralyze them due to Serene Grace. Alternatively, Thunder Wave may be used to have a higher chance of paralysis and affect Ghost-types, while Wish enables Jirachi as a cleric, synergizing well with U-turn. U-turn preserves momentum and permits Jirachi to escape unfavorable situations against Quagsire, Gholdengo, Skarmory, and Gliscor. Protect may be used instead to capitalize on Leftovers recovery and scout for super effective moves from foes, playing around Choice-locked users; however, the lack of U-turn means Jirachi can't maintain momentum. Stealth Rock is useful to wear down pivots and offers additional pressure in difficult matchups such as Dark, Ghost, and Water. The given EV spread maximizes Jirachi's special bulk, notably letting it survive a Shadow Ball from Choice Specs Flutter Mane as well as outpace Adamant Mamoswine.</p> <p>Slowbro forms a great defensive core with Jirachi, walling threats such as Gouging Fire, Cinderace, and non-Choice Band Excadrill while also checking Ceruledge if Slowbro has no item. Furthermore, Slowbro is capable of luring in and beating Dark-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon via Body Press in conjunction with a Colbur Berry. In return, Jirachi offers a Poison immunity and is capable of switching into special attackers like Alolan Ninetales and Choice Specs Latios. Hoopa-U threatens Pokemon like Gholdengo, Spectrier, and Pecharunt while also providing Knock Off support, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes to capitalize on Jirachi's Stealth Rock. In exchange, Jirachi offers pivoting via U-turn and utility moves like Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave to improve Hoopa-U's wallbreaking. Latios boasts a much-needed Ground immunity and breaks through threats like Gouging Fire, Archaludon, and Keldeo. Hatterene prevents opposing entry hazards from being set and threatens Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Hydreigon via Draining Kiss. Indeedee sets up Psychic Terrain, making it harder for Azumarill to break out of Jirachi's Iron Head and paralysis spam, as well as offering a Ghost immunity to fend off Spectrier and Hisuian Zoroark. Iron Boulder is a great option for speed control and removes Fire-types such as Ogerpon-H, Hisuian Arcanine, and Volcarona with Mighty Cleave. Espathra appreciates Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave support from Jirachi easing its sweeping process late-game. At +2, Deoxys-S paired with BoltBeam coverage threatens a plethora of threats to Jirachi like Choice Specs Greninja, the Landorus formes, and Gliscor.</p>"

Iron Head, in tandem with Choice Scarf, provides an opportunity to win endgames with consecutive flinches. Furthermore, Choice Scarf allows it to outspeed and KO foes like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, both of which can prove to be troublesome for Psychic teams. Trick can be used to punish defensive switch-ins like Skarmory and Toxapex, forcing them to hold Choice Scarf and rendering them effectively null, thus allowing Psychic teams to make valuable progress against Steel, Flying, Water, and Poison teams. U-turn helps Jirachi function as a fast pivot after luring in common checks like Kingambit and Archaludon, thus retaining momentum. Healing Wish gives it the opportunity to operate as a fast support Pokemon. Alternatively, Ice Punch can be used to reliably check Gliscor and non-Choice Scarf Landorus.</p> <p>Hoopa-U's neutrality to Ghost-type moves and great special bulk allows it to function as a viable partner for Jirachi, checking foes like Gholdengo and Spectrier that it isn't able to deal with otherwise. Teammates like Deoxys-S can set Spikes to punish Jirachi's checks like Gholdengo and Heatran and aid its late-game sweep. Alternatively, Choice Specs Deoxys-S in tandem with Psychic Terrain can prove to be a valuable wallbreaker with Expanding Force. Hatterene provides a switch-in to Dark-type foes like Darkrai, Hydreigon, and Hisuian Samurott, which may prove troublesome for Jirachi. Furthermore, Hatterene prevents foes from setting entry hazards thanks to Magic Bounce, thus deterring their attempts to get chip damage on Jirachi. Choice Scarf Iron Boulder acts as an incredible wallbreaking partner, checking foes like Ogerpon-H, Volcanion, Volcarona, and Moltres. In addition to that, it can also forego its Choice Scarf and opt to use Swords Dance, since Jirachi takes up the role of the late-game sweeper. Latias and Latios leverage their phenomenal wallbreaking potential to aid Jirachi by checking Dragon-type foes like Archaludon and Gouging Fire. In exchange, Jirachi deals with annoying Fairy-type foes like Iron Valiant and non-Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. Indeedee leverages its immunity to Ghost-type moves to help Jirachi while also setting Psychic Terrain to protect its teammates from Kingambit's Sucker Punch. In exchange, Jirachi's access to Healing Wish allows teammates like Latias and Indeedee to free a moveslot. Gallade pairs well with Jirachi, as it checks troublesome Poison-types like Toxapex and Amoonguss with Psycho Cut while also hitting Steel-types like Kingambit and Heatran with Sacred Sword. In exchange, Jirachi forces a Choice Scarf on walls like Toxapex and Skarmory using Trick, preventing them from recovering and allowing Gallade to perform a more comfortable sweep. Slowbro and Galarian Slowking form a strong defensive core, with the former being able to switch into Excadrill and Landorus-T, while the latter can switch into foes like Galarian Moltres and Hydreigon. Furthermore, itemless Slowbro can conveniently check Ceruledge's Poltergeist, which is extremely troublesome for Jirachi. Lastly, Espathra and Jirachi form a strong late-game sweeper core, with Espathra leveraging Speed Boost and Calm Mind to spam Stored Power, while Jirachi attempts to chip away at those immune to or resistant to Espathra's Stored Power, like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra.</p>"

Bullet Seed, alongside Loaded Dice, gives Torterra an incredibly strong STAB combination when paired with Headlong Rush and hits things Seed Bomb cannot KO such as Walking Wake and Air Balloon Glimmora. Seed Bomb is a less powerful alternative but comes with the upside of not having to run Loaded Dice for reliability. Headlong Rush allows Torterra to hit Steel- and Poison-types such as Heatran and Amoonguss.

Alternatively, Heavy Slam provides Torterra with a way to hit Galarian Weezing to secure the Poison matchup alongside being a good option into Fairy teams as a whole. An Adamant nature is preferred to gain as much extra power as possible, but a Jolly nature can outspeed slower Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott.

In return, Infernape can OHKO Landorus with Flare Blitz under sun as well as both Ursaluna-B and Mamoswine without sun. Cinderace is another noteworthy teammate, as not only can it remove hazards with Court Change, but it is also able to revenge kill faster Ghost-types Infernape cannot such as Dragapult and Speed-boosted Ceruledge with Sucker Punch. In return, Infernape's Fighting-type STAB move frees up a moveslot for Cinderace, as the latter no longer needs High Jump Kick. Volcanion is another great teammate, as it provides Fire teams an immunity to Water, and in return, Infernape is able to threaten the likes of Iron Treads and Landorus for it. Talonflame and Moltres provide a Ground immunity, Will-O-Wisp support, and they can bring Infernape in via U-turn. The two of them are also able to lure bulky Pokemon like Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu for Infernape to break. Talonflame also provides Defog support, while Moltres's bulk allows it to take on Dragonite, which Infernape greatly appreciates. Infernape's wallbreaking enables other wallbreakers and sweepers such as Ogerpon-H, Volcarona, and Ceruledge to clean late-game. In particular, Infernape can remove Alolan Muk and Heatran to enable a sweep from Volcarona.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Empoleon's access to a nice batch of utility options such as Stealth Rock, Roar, and Defog allows it to support its team with entry hazards, phaze foes, and deter Defog. Empoleon acts as a great special wall, being able to deal with foes such as Choice Specs Walking Wake, Greninja, and Hatterene. Flash Cannon gives Empoleon an easier time dealing with Fairy-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Alolan Ninetales, as well as hitting Ice-types like non-Choice Band Chien-Pao. Empoleon also takes neutral damage from Freeze Dry from Alolan Ninetales and Articuno, which have to be extremely wary of Flash Cannon and Knock Off, respectively. Roar is a great option for Empoleon to get rid of setup sweepers such as Manaphy, Volcarona, and Spectrier, as well as applying more Stealth Rock damage to the Pokemon that are forced in. Lastly, Knock Off allows Empoleon to put itself in a better position to take hits from offensive Pokemon such as Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Basculegion-F, as well as crippling defensive Pokemon that rely heavily on their item, such as Articuno, Corviknight, and Alolan Muk. Leftovers synergizes well with Empoleon's Stealth Rock resistance, and it also appreciates the extra longevity Leftovers provides. However, Heavy-Duty Boots is a better option for teams with no entry hazard removal, as Empoleon is prone to getting worn down by Spikes from repeated switching. 60 Speed EVs allow Empoleon to outspeed uninvested Corviknight and 2HKO it with +2 Surf, helping prevent hazard removal.</p> <p>Toxapex forms a nice defensive core with Empoleon, as the support from Toxic Spikes helps whittle down Pokemon that would otherwise beat Empoleon, such as Zamazenta, Meowscarada, and Urshifu-R. Empoleon can also switch into the Psychic-type attacks that would make quick work of Toxapex, and Toxapex can switch in on Fighting-type attacks for Empoleon. Physically defensive Rotom-W provides a valuable Ground-type immunity as well as a slow Volt Switch to help Empoleon get in more easily. Will-O-Wisp support from Rotom-W also allows Empoleon to stand up to a physically attacking foe that it might not otherwise be able to, such as Iron Treads or Alolan Muk. Quagsire is another excellent complement to Empoleon, as it provides a valuable Electric-type immunity, as well as helping chip down walls with Spikes and Toxic support. Quagsire also helps versus Zamazenta, a setup Pokemon that Empoleon struggles to phaze, and Empoleon can in turn take on Sinistcha, a setup Pokemon that tears through Quagsire. The physically defensive prowess of Quagsire and the specially defensive power of Empoleon form an incredibly potent defensive pairing. Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes via Ceaseless Edge and stack hazard damage in tandem with Stealth Rock from Empoleon. Empoleon is also capable of switching into Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon such as Flutter Mane that would otherwise plague Hisuian Samurott. Manaphy is also a strong teammate, as Empoleon's entry hazard and Knock Off support allows it to set up and secure KOs more easily. Empoleon can also switch into foes that wish to poison Manaphy, such as Toxapex. Ogerpon-W is a great physical wallbreaking teammate for Empoleon. Empoleon's entry hazard support from Empoleon, whittles down Pokemon that would otherwise switch into it, and in return Ogerpon-W smashes Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise beat Empoleon, such as Great Tusk and Gliscor. Choice Specs Greninja is also a great wallbreaking teammate, as it outspeeds and OHKOes many Ground-type Pokemon that would otherwise give Empoleon trouble, such as Landorus, Garchomp, and Quagsire. Empoleon is also able to safely switch into Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Hatterene and Flutter Mane. Urshifu-R thrives with Empoleon's hazard support, as almost nothing will be safe from a +2 Surging Strikes or Close Combat. If Empoleon is not using Heavy-Duty Boots, Quaquaval is a fantastic teammate. Their Fighting and Steel typings have nice synergy, as Quaquaval can take care of Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Kingambit, as well as removing entry hazards via Rapid Spin. Azumarill can deal with Fighting-type Pokemon such as Kommo-o, Zamazenta, and Great Tusk, while Empoleon can handle Poison-type Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing, Glimmora, and Iron Moth. Pelipper is capable of setting rain for Empoleon, as well as taking on Grass-type Pokemon such as Hisuian Lilligant and Meowscarada with it's perfectly accurate Hurricane. Basculegion-F's Normal-type immunity means that Empoleon's Stealth Rock and Hisuian Samurott's Spikes cannot be removed via Rapid Spin.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Empoleon has a wide array of utility moves such as Knock Off, Flip Turn, and Roost that allow it to be a valuable support piece on Steel teams. It acts as a phenomenal special wall, easily shrugging off attacks from potent special attackers such as Flutter Mane, Greninja, Walking Wake, and Hisuian Zoroark. Surf is Empoleon's best way of dealing consistent damage as well as taking care of Fire-type Pokemon such as Talonflame, Iron Moth, and Heatran. Knock Off allows Empoleon to soften up defensive staples such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Galarian Weezing, and Porygon2 and remove Choice items from the aforementioned special attackers. Flip Turn is a great pivoting option that allows Empoleon to provide safe switches for wallbreaking teammates such as Kingambit and Choice Specs Gholdengo. Competitive deters opponents from removing hazards via Defog, as the +2 boost to Surf allows Empoleon to deal huge damage.</p> <p>Thanks to Competitive deterring Defog and Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, Empoleon thrives on Steel teams that rely on entry hazards, so hazard-setting teammates such as Archaludon and Skarmory are great picks. Skarmory and Archaludon are also able to use their incredible Defense stats to stand up to physical attackers that Empoleon is unable to deal with, such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Sneasler. Skarmory is also able to switch into Ground-type attacks that would otherwise threaten Empoleon. Kingambit is a powerful teammate for Empoleon, as the entry hazard damage and removal of items from Pokemon like Choice Specs Walking Wake and Greninja and Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Quagsire and Toxapex make Kingambit's job a lot easier. Empoleon is also capable of switching into Fire-type attacks, Matcha Gotcha from Sinistcha, and Will-O-Wisp from Dragapult, as well as threatening to remove their Leftovers. Gholdengo is a great teammate for Empoleon, as it can safely switch into Fighting-type attacks that threaten Empoleon. Gholdengo can also take advantage of the hazards on the field, as its checks, such as Alolan Muk, Ting-Lu, and Heatran, are weakened by them as they switch in. Iron Treads is able to remove hazards via Rapid Spin, which protects Empoleon in case its Heavy-Duty Boots get removed by Knock Off. Air Balloon Iron Treads is also capable of providing as a Ground immunity, albeit temporarily, and threatening foes like Gliscor and Landorus with a strong Ice Spinner. Excadrill is a strong physical attacker that appreciates Empoleon's ability to grant it safe switches with Flip Turn. Excadrill is able to fire off very powerful attacks like Earthquake and Iron Head, all while the opposing team takes chip damage from entry hazards. Both Iron Treads and Excadrill are able to switch into Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Zapdos, Thundurus-T, Choice Specs Flutter Mane, and Rotom formes while threatening them back with Ice Spinner, Rock Slide, Iron Head, and Mold Breaker Earthquake, respectively. Corviknight can switch into Ground-type attacks as well and is also capable of attacking Fighting- and Grass-type Pokemon such as Sneasler, Great Tusk, Ogerpon-W, and Meowscarada with STAB-boosted Brave Bird. Empoleon can form a nice core with Heatran to help stop Fire-type Pokemon such as Volcanion, Volcarona, and Ninetales. Air Balloon Heatran is also capable of completely walling the most common Gouging Fire set. Hisuian Goodra is another formidable special wall that forms a nice core with Empoleon, further helping improve the Fire matchup. Its Dragon Tail also forces foes to switch out, thus racking up more hazard damage.</p>"

        "description": "<p>A great addition to Normal-type teams, Staraptor checks threats such as Choice Band Breloom, Great Tusk, Quaquaval, and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and provides muscle power against Steel- and Dragon-type teams. Brave Bird makes short work of the aforementioned Fighting-types, as well as bulky Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Amoonguss, and threatens specially defensive Toxapex and Skeledirge with a 2HKO if they switch into it. Close Combat is what gives Staraptor its amazing wallbreaking potential, OHKOing Kingambit, Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Cyclizar while KOing Baxcalibur after Stealth Rock damage and threatening Iron Treads with a 2HKO. Final Gambit, boosted by 28 HP EVs, OHKOes targets Staraptor wouldn't otherwise beat, such as Rotom-W, physically defensive Toxapex, Hatterene, Klefki, and Forretress after Stealth Rock damage—denying dual screens and/or entry hazards from the last two. Alternatively, Double-Edge threatens checks like Rotom-W and Kilowattrel. Finally, U-turn allows this reckless bird to pivot into a teammate, if there really is nothing else it can do, such as against Gholdengo or Corviknight. Equipping a Choice Scarf will let it outspeed Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Walking Wake, which otherwise force it out, and threaten them instead.</p> <p>A great partner for Staraptor is Hisuian Zoroark. When it uses Illusion to disguise as Staraptor, pairing its Fighting immunity with Staraptor's Ground immunity, an apparent \"Staraptor\" could be immune to either type. This uncertainty completely dismantles Great Tusk. Furthermore, disguised as Staraptor, it can bait in an unsuspecting Corviknight, Gholdengo, or Dondozo to cripple or OHKO it. Maushold is another great partner thanks to Tidy Up, which keeps both Stealth Rock and Reflect off the field for Staraptor to not worry about. Also, its Population Bomb can break through Ting-Lu and non-Rocky Helmet Toxapex for Staraptor. A less prominent partner that also provides hazard removal, as well as Knock Off support, is Cyclizar. With Stealth Rock breaking Sturdy and further advancing Staraptor's wallbreaking, Blissey is another highly appreciated teammate to set it up, provide Healing Wish and Heal Bell support, and check both Sandy Shocks and Choice Scarf Greninja for Staraptor. Indeedee, likewise, offers Healing Wish support, as well as checking Poison-types like Toxapex and Glimmora that Staraptor struggles with. Lastly, making good use of Staraptor's U-turn, Ditto is a teammate that can turn a bleak situation into a winning one, copying setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Chien-Pao to reverse sweep opponents.</p>"

Earth Power targets Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Skeledirge, while Earthquake deals more damage to Clodsire and Flutter Mane. Ice Beam hits Dragonite, Garchomp, and Kilowattrel. Alternatively, Clear Smog may be used to prevent Espathra and Dondozo from setting up, while Chilling Water eases matchups against physical attackers such as Quaquaval, Scizor, and Iron Treads. Stealth Rock and Spikes are interchangeable depending on what its teammate Ting-Lu is using. Gastrodon prefers maximum Defense investment to check Pokemon like Barraskewda and Quaquaval; however, an EV spread of 252 HP / 68 Def / 188 SpD with a Bold nature can be used to prevent a 2HKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Ice Beam.</p> <p>Gastrodon's immunity to Water-type attacks and ability to set entry hazards is heavily appreciated by Clodsire, Great Tusk, and Garchomp. Clodsire completes the hazard stack core with Toxic Spikes and answers threats such as Meowscarada and Flutter Mane as well as setup sweepers like Hydreigon, Volcarona, and Gholdengo due to Unaware. Choice Scarf Great Tusk outpaces and deals with threats such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Baxcalibur, and Gallade; furthermore, Great Tusk removes Heavy-Duty Boots from common users like Sableye, Amoonguss, and Brambleghast with Knock Off, enhancing Gastrodon's hazard stacking. Garchomp's Fire-type coverage is valued for threatening roadblocks such as Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Breloom, and Sandy Shocks checks Water-types like Pelipper, Quaquaval, and Slowking as well as Corviknight. Iron Treads removes hazards with Rapid Spin, easing Gastrodon's pivoting if its held item were removed, and checks Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, and Giga Drain Hatterene.

Earth Power is able to take advantage of Gastrodon's superior Special Attack to chunk foes like Toxapex, Arcahludon, and Pecharunt with ease, while Earthquake helps to ease matchups against specially bulky targets like Hisuian Goodra and Calm Mind Raging Bolt. Ice Beam grants Gastrodon a way to threaten Ground-immune targets like Landorus and scare away Dragon- and Flying-type threats like Dragapult, Dragonite, and Zapdos. Stealth Rock and Spikes provide pressure to threats like Meowscarda and Breloom that can come in to easily scare Gastrodon out. Sticky Hold is Gastrodon's ability of choice, preventing it from having its item removed from Trick and Knock Off from threats like Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Alolan Muk.</p> <p>Toxapex serves as an incredible complement as a physical wall, being able to stave off Grass-type attacks from the likes of Amoonguss and Meowscarada. Toxapex also helps Gastrodon by spreading poison, which complements the chip damage from Gastrodon's entry hazards. Tentacruel can provide similar support to Toxapex while also being able to remove its foes' Heavy-Duty Boots via Knock Off and check the Ogerpon formes, which majorly threaten Gastrodon. Both strongly appreciate Electric-types like Raging Bolt, Regieleki, and Zapdos being dealt with effectively. Empoleon complements Gastrodon's Spikes by running Stealth Rock along with threatening Defoggers with a potential Competitive boost. Empoleon also helps by dealing with Freeze-Dry from the likes of Kyurem, Articuno, and Alolan Ninetales. Choice item users Keldeo and Greninja have their attacks greatly benefit from Gastrodon's hazards chipping down their switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Blissey, and Corviknight. In return, Keldeo provides Vacuum Wave as a way to deal with threats like Chien-Pao and Meowscarada, while Greninja provides Sludge Wave to remove the Ogerpon formes, which take advantage of Gastrodon. Primarina assists Gastrodon by taking on powerful Dark- and Dragon-types like Hisuian Samurott, Roaring Moon, and Dragapult. Ogerpon-W appreciates Gastrodon's hazards chipping down its switch-ins like Skarmory, and it also has access to Encore to stop setup from Kingambit and Raging Bolt, as they attempt to take advantage of Gastrodon's passivity.</p>"

Protect is also very valuable in scouting their coverage moves, letting Skuntank accumulate Black Sludge recovery, and stalling out poison damage. Aftermath punishes contact attackers like Kingambit and Azumarill, which allows teammates such as Toxicroak to safely come in and finish them off. Skuntank can run Play Rough to threaten common Dark-types of the metagame, such as Chien-Pao and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Physically defensive Amoonguss and Toxapex are valuable teammates that deal with the physical attackers that threaten Skuntank, like Mimikyu, Quaquaval, and Dondozo.

Draco Meteor is a powerful nuke that severely weakens and lures physically bulky foes like Sableye, Rotom-W, Great Tusk, and Archaludon after Stamina boosts. Fire Blast allows Garchomp to threaten Ground-immune Steel-types such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Air Balloon Gholdengo as well as Bug- and Grass-types like Scizor, Forretress, and Amoonguss.

Excadrill is a key offensive partner for Garchomp under sandstorm, as it takes on both Ice- and Fairy-types such as Kyurem, Alolan Ninetales, and Enamorus. In return, Garchomp weakens annoying defensive pieces like Archaludon and Skarmory for it. Clodsire also stacks hazards thanks to Toxic Spikes, is a Water-immune Pokemon that deals with Walking Wake, and aids in both the Fairy matchup thanks to its Poison-typing and against special attackers such as Volcarona and Flutter Mane thanks to its bulk.

It should be noted that if Rapid Spin causes the user to faint due to contact damage, it will not clear entry hazards, making Garchomp particularly adept at keeping hazards up. Moreover, Garchomp has enough bulk to survive an unboosted Ice Spinner from Iron Treads and Quaquaval, so it is relatively unafraid of the metagame’s most common spinners. Outside of warding off spinners, Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin renders Garchomp broadly threatening to physical attackers in general, punishing U-turns from foes such as Sneasler and Cinderace, causing non-Punching Glove Urshifu-R to nearly KO itself from full HP if it uses Surging Strikes on Garchomp, and breaking Dragonite's Multiscale. Dragon Tail rounds out this set by allowing Garchomp to deal good chip damage while forcing out spinners such as Great Tusk and Quaquaval and phazing setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Scizor. The switch forcing capabilities of Dragon Tail synergize incredibly well with this hazard stacking set, enabling Garchomp to rack up entry hazard damage on the opposing team as it repeatedly forces foes out.</p> <p>While Garchomp is excellent at deterring Rapid Spin by itself, Dragapult provides further security for its entry hazards by acting as a true spinblocker. Moreover, Choice Specs Dragapult greatly appreciates Garchomp’s entry hazards pushing foes into KO ranges and punishing switches, bolstering the already formidable offensive pressure these sets create. Dragapult further enjoys Garchomp’s ability to take on Kingambit, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Alolan Muk, while Garchomp is grateful for Choice Specs Dragapult threatening Corviknight and thus preventing Defog. Alternatively to Choice Specs, Hex Dragapult can also become an extremely threatening late-game cleaner when combined with Garchomp's entry hazards, and the burns it spreads further help accumulate chip damage on the opposing team. Additionally, Dragapult serves as a crucial check to Iron Defense Zamazenta, which Garchomp cannot phaze if it's behind a Substitute. Hisuian Goodra makes a great pairing with Garchomp, being able to soak up the Ice and Fairy moves aimed at Garchomp from foes such as Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Iron Valiant while crushing them in return with its Heavy Slam. Hisuian Goodra can also tank a hit from Chien-Pao and OHKO it in retaliation with Body Press, soak up hits from Choice Specs Greninja, and handle opposing Choice Specs Dragapult. In exchange, Garchomp can duel physical threats such as Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Sneasler for Hisuian Goodra. Dragon’s various setup sweepers such as Baxcalibur, Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Dragonite all greatly value Garchomp’s entry hazards pushing foes into KO ranges and breaking the Focus Sashes of foes such as Ceruledge and Breloom, enabling their sweeps. Of these, Kommo-o is especially notable, as its Vacuum Wave can OHKO Chien-Pao at neutral and Greninja following a Clangorous Soul and Throat Spray boost, both of which are incredibly deadly to Garchomp. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon is a great partner to Garchomp, appreciating Garchomp’s entry hazards and ability to wear down Great Tusk and Iron Treads facilitating its late-game cleaning. Roaring Moon in turn supports Garchomp by smashing through Flutter Mane and opposing Dragapult, as well as opening up foes such as Toxapex and Amoonguss to hazard damage by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots with its brutal STAB Knock Off. Choice Scarf Walking Wake appreciates Garchomp’s entry hazards in the same vein while removing threats such as Landorus, Gliscor, Great Tusk, +1 Baxcalibur, and Chien-Pao. If instead using Choice Specs, Walking Wake’s synergy with Garchomp increases even further, as it can blast through Corviknight, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-W with its powerful STAB attacks and coverage. Walking Wake can also use Flip Turn to pivot Garchomp in against foes such as Toxapex and Alolan Muk. Cyclizar can clear entry hazards from its side of the field while keeping Garchomp’s up with Rapid Spin; it can also prevent Defog from Corviknight and Mandibuzz with Taunt and remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off. Dragalge can compound on Garchomp’s entry hazards with its own Toxic Spikes and use its Fairy neutrality and fierce Adaptability-boosted Poison-type moves to eradicate Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Azumarill, and Clefable.</p>"

  "Hippowdon": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ground</h4> <p>Yawn can be used over Whirlwind to threaten to put foes to sleep, which Ground otherwise has no method of doing, while still forcing switches. Rocky Helmet is a solid alternative item that has great synergy with Sand Stream and Stealth Rock, piling on even more passive damage against the physical attackers Hippowdon switches into. Since Hippowdon can struggle to deal with Spikes at times, Heavy-Duty Boots is another viable item choice to help remedy this weakness.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sand Support": {
        "description": "<p>Hippowdon is a mandatory pick on sand-based Ground teams for its access to Sand Stream, which allows it to enable one of the type's most dangerous offensive threats in Sand Rush Excadrill; in addition, its amazing bulk lets it further support its team as a mixed wall and entry hazard setter. Earthquake is the default attacking move for its STAB-boosted damage, but Body Press can also be useful to harness Hippowdon's huge Defense, letting it KO major threats like Chien-Pao and Air Balloon Kingambit and put more pressure on some hazard removers, most notably Terapagos and Alolan Sandslash. Stealth Rock is an excellent support move that Hippowdon's teammates will enjoy not having to fit into their movesets, and the chip damage it provides is invaluable to make Excadrill and other offensive teammates like Landorus and Mamoswine more threatening. Whirlwind makes for an excellent pairing with Stealth Rock and Sand Stream, letting Hippowdon rack up chip damage at random against the opposing team; it's also excellent for stopping setup sweepers like Swords Dance Gliscor and IronPress Corviknight before they can overwhelm Hippowdon with multiple boosts. With Eject Button as its item, Hippowdon can switch in, set up Sandstorm, take a powerful hit for a teammate, and get Excadrill or another offensive threat onto the field all in the same turn, generating ridiculous amounts of momentum. However, Leftovers is a solid alternative to give Hippowdon extra recovery, reducing the need to spend turns using Slack Off. A physically defensive EV spread is the default, taking advantage of Hippowdon's incredible HP and Defense to let it survive such staggeringly strong hits as Choice Band Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash after Stealth Rock damage. This spread also notably lets it avoid a 2HKO from Ogerpon-H's Horn Leech and Choice Band Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury after Leftovers recovery. Alternatively, a more balanced spread of 252 HP / 128 Def / 128 SpD can help Hippowdon deal with mixed attackers like Iron Valiant and Psyshock users like Latios more effectively, the latter being especially important since Hippowdon's favorite specially defensive teammate, Clodsire, is extremely vulnerable to the move. This spread also has great synergy with Eject Button, since it lets Hippowdon soak up powerful special hits like Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor for the benefit of its teammates.</p> <p>As a sand setter, it makes sense that Sand Rush Excadrill is the quintessential offensive teammate for Hippowdon; its Choice Band set provides excellent speed control and wallbreaking power in one teamslot, and its Steel typing also lets it offensively check some attackers that can overwhelm Hippowdon, such as Latios and Meowscarada. The pairing of Hippowdon and Excadrill is extremely threatening on its own, but it's best complemented by other offensive pieces that can threaten Ground-immune Pokemon which don't care about Iron Head, as well as bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss. Mamoswine checks all of these boxes, 2HKOing Corviknight and OHKOing Amoonguss with Choice Band-boosted Icicle Crash. Thanks to Thick Fat, Mamoswine is also a great switch-in to Ice-type attacks that Hippowdon doesn't enjoy taking from powerful attackers like Kyurem. Gliscor and Landorus are welcome additions to Hippowdon's team, providing useful support with a crucial Grass neutrality and support options like Spikes and Gravity, respectively, the former of which especially synergizes with Hippowdon's focus on passive damage. Landorus isn't as useful as Gliscor defensively, but it's a powerful attacker that's enabled nicely by Hippowdon's entry hazard support and potentially Eject Button, and it also makes an excellent check to common IronPress users like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Zamazenta. Ursaluna-B is a slow but incredibly powerful wallbreaker that's enabled nicely by speed control from Excadrill in sand, and its solid physical bulk lets it take some pressure off of Hippowdon in the hit-taking department; in addition, its Vacuum Wave is great for offensively checking common attackers that threaten Hippowdon like Chien-Pao, Meowscarada, and Greninja. Great Tusk is an incredibly versatile partner, backing up Hippowdon against physical attackers while running a massive variety of sets, letting it fill the role of Rapid Spin support, revenge killer, or setup sweeper with Bulk Up. On the defensive side, Clodsire is an excellent special wall that complements Hippowdon's physical hit-taking ability perfectly, and it can also stack Toxic Spikes to make Whirlwind even more threatening; Clodsire is especially great thanks to its Water immunity and Grass neutrality, letting it stop major threats like Keldeo, Meowscarada, and Ogerpon-W in their tracks. It's worth noting that Clodsire can make the team weak to offensive Psychic-types like Latios; this weakness can be patched up by Hippowdon alongside other teammates like Excadrill. Garchomp is a great addition to sand teams, thanks to its mixed attacking capabilities letting it lure annoying physical walls like Skarmory and Archaludon; it can also go on the offensive with a Swords Dance set if these foes are covered by other means.</p>"

Its Grass typing provides a way to deal with Water-types such as Azumarill, Basculegion, and Quagsire. Giga Drain is its main STAB move, dealing damage while providing recovery for Abomasnow. Alternatively, it can use Grass Knot in replacement of Giga Drain, allowing it to 2HKO Dondozo. Earth Power allows Abomasnow to hit Steel- and Fire-types, 2HKOing Archaludon and Torkoal and OHKOing offensive Heatran on the switch. The given EV spread allows Abomasnow to outspeed defensive Rotom-W, some defensive Gholdengo spreads, and Adamant Azumarill. Abomasnow can run either Icy Rock for more snow turns, which is preferred in Cetitan teams, or Light Clay for more Aurora Veil turns.</p> <p>Abomasnow best acts as a secondary hail setter alongside Alolan Ninetales. Cetitan highly appreciates Abomasnow's snow, as it can utilize Slush Rush to outspeed threats such as Iron Moth, Walking Wake, and Iron Treads. With Earthquake, it serves as a good sweeper against Poison, Steel, and Fire teams, which Abomasnow struggles to go against. Other setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Glastrier and Cloyster  enjoy the Defense boost in snow, increasing their survivability and letting them set up and sweep the opposing team. Froslass provides team support in Taunt and its own hazards in Spikes, as well as Destiny Bond, which can take out a foe and give Abomasnow a free switch-in. Avalugg's great Defense and access to Rapid Spin make it a great teammate under snow, checking the likes of Kingambit, Iron Treads, and Urshifu-R while also acting as hazard control for its team.</p>"

At +2, Triple Axel secures the OHKO on foes like the Ogerpon formes, Kyurem, Walking Wake, Ceruledge, and Hisuian Goodra. Furthermore, it is able to check defensive Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and non-Choice Scarf Gholdengo, which can prove to be formidable foes for Ice teams. Ice Shard serves as a reliable countermeasure against faster foes like Choice Scarf Enamorus, Landorus, and Roaring Moon. At +2, it is also able to OHKO Dragapult, which prevents Weavile from getting burned by Will-O-Wisp while also OHKOing Garchomp without making contact, which avoids chip damage from its Rough Skin.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales is a necessary teammate for Weavile, as its ability to set snow and Aurora Veil grants Weavile a solid boost in its defenses, allowing it to set up much more reliably. Furthermore, Alolan Ninetales helps check Fighting-type threats like Keldeo and Kommo-o, which Weavile might otherwise have trouble against. Kyurem is an incredible partner for Weavile, forming a wallbreaking core with it and checking foes like Archaludon and Gouging Fire, while Weavile deals with foes like Dragapult and Latias for Kyurem. Mamoswine is an amazing wallbreaker that provides immediate explosive power thanks to its Choice Band set and offensively checks Steel- and Fire-type foes like Kingambit, Heatran, and Volcanion after their Air Balloon is popped; in return, Weavile deals with Gholdengo and Ceruledge.

Avalugg and Cloyster act as defensive staples on Ice teams, being able to sustain heavy physical damage from foes like Sneasler and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R. In addition to their defensive utility, they can provide much-needed hazard removal with Rapid Spin. Shell Smash Cloyster also forms an incredible wallbreaking core with Weavile on hyper offense teams, checking foes like Heatran and Volcarona with Surf.

In that regard, Araquanid is the premier choice, as it has a solid special bulk and Water Bubble that helps it both offensively and defensively, allowing Araquanid to check opposing Volcarona. Galvantula and Ribombee both have a niche, with the former pressuring Water-type foes such as Urshifu-R and Pelipper and the latter providing a useful Dragon immunity to the team. Bulky Quiver Dance Volcarona can set up on special walls that can prove troublesome to Yanmega such as Iron Hands and Galarian Slowking. Yanmega also pairs up well with other sweepers such as Scizor, Kleavor, and Lokix. Scizor takes on Rock- and Fairy-types like Iron Boulder, Kleavor, Flutter Mane, and Iron Valiant. Kleavor provides utility in Stone Axe and helps tremendously in the mirror matchup by getting rid of Volcarona, Lokix, and Araquanid. Finally, Lokix excels at crippling special walls that give trouble to Yanmega such as Hisuian Goodra, Heatran, and Galarian Slowking with Knock Off, while Sucker Punch and First Impression let it deal with Choice Specs Dragapult and Latios.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With Swords Dance, Gliscor becomes a powerful setup sweeper on Flying teams thanks to its longevity. At +2, Facade makes use of Gliscor's Toxic Orb to deal strong neutral damage into threats like Breloom, Galarian Weezing, and opposing Gliscor. Alternatively, Knock Off can be used to threaten Ghost-types like Spectrier, Sinistcha, and Air Balloon Gholdengo. The chosen EV spread maximizes Gliscor's bulk, allowing it to survive hits such as Ogerpon-H's Ivy Cudgel at +2 and Ninetales's Overheat while outspeeding Modest Volcanion and Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Gliscor greatly appreciates support from Zapdos and Articuno, which can deal with opposing Water- and Flying-type threats that give it issues like Primarina, Pelipper, and Enamorus, as well as providing it with entry with their pivot options. Zapdos continues to support Gliscor by being able to potentially paralyze threats with Discharge and its ability, Static, along with removing Skarmory and Corviknight, which completely wall Gliscor. Meanwhile, Articuno can help to remove opposing Gliscor and Great Tusk, which can prove problematic. Skarmory provides solid support with its access to entry hazards, improving Gliscor's wallbreaking capabilities while also checking Ice- and Dark-type threats like Mamoswine, Weavile, and Air Balloon Kingambit thanks to Body Press. Corviknight can similarly check Ice- and Dark-types with Body Press, provide entry hazard removal, and give Gliscor safe entry with U-turn. Landorus can pair well with Gliscor to double up on Ground offense and overwhelm Fire and Electric teams, notably outspeeding and removing targets like Gouging Fire, Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine, and Raging Bolt. Choice Scarf Enamorus is a fast attacker that is able to outspeed and revenge kill targets like Choice Specs Latios, Choice Specs Greninja, and Hydreigon, along with being able to use Healing Wish to heal Gliscor and give it a second chance to set up.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Gliscor is one of the best entry hazard setters for Flying teams, owing to its ability, typing and bulk. The combination of Toxic Orb and Poison Heal gives Gliscor excellent passive recovery and immunity to status from moves like Spore from Amoonguss and Will-O-Wisp from Sableye. Furthermore, Gliscor's Ground / Flying type combination gives it an immunity to Electric-type moves like Thunderbolt from Regieleki and Sandy Shocks, which its teammates are weak to, and a neutrality against Rock-type moves like Stone Axe from Kleavor and Stone Edge from Tyranitar. Gliscor's typing combined with Special Defense investment and Poison Heal also allows it to sit on Pokemon such as non-Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Iron Moth that do not have Ice-type or strong Water-type moves. Access to Stealth Rock and Spikes allows Gliscor to wear down walls like Toxapex and Clodsire and fast threats like Greninja and Basculegion-F throughout the game, and Toxic allows it to spread status against bulkier threats like Dragon Dance Dragonite, Mandibuzz, and Ursaluna-B. Taunt pressures Defog users like Corviknight and opposing entry hazard setters like Clefable and Quagsire. Knock Off hits Air Balloon Gholdengo and removes Leftovers from Corviknight. Earthquake offers decent STAB damage against Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon, which are immune to Toxic, like Clodsire and Gholdengo and prevents foes from setting up in Gliscor's presence. Protect helps Gliscor activate its Toxic Orb against faster enemies with access to Knock Off or status-spreading moves. It also allows Gliscor to scout super effective moves like Ice Spinner from Great Tusk and Iron Treads, and diminish Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon PP by using Protect on Blood Moon turns and walling Ursaluna-B on the cooldown, and safely recover HP from Poison Heal. 60 EVs in Speed serve to outspeed Modest Volcanion and Timid Magnezone.</p> <p>Gliscor appreciates teammates like Articuno, which can use Freeze-Dry to force opposing Gliscor and Water-type Pokemon like Manaphy and Walking Wake to switch. In addition to that, Articuno can easily switch into Ice Beam from threats like Greninja and Frosmoth and other special attacks due to its naturally high Special Defense and neutrality to Ice-type attacks. In return, Articuno appreciates Gliscor's ability to threaten Steel- and Fire-types with Earthquake and block Toxic. Articuno also enjoys Gliscor's ability to absorb Knock Off and prevent the removal of Articuno's Heavy-Duty Boots. Iron Defense Corviknight is also a great teammate for Gliscor, as it serves as an answer to Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Corviknight's great physical bulk and access to Body Press allow it to comfortably switch into Icicle Crash from these Ice-type Pokemon and force them out with the threat of super effective damage. Corviknight also checks Dragon-type wallbreakers like Dragonite and Dragon Dance or Choice Band Dragapult, which Gliscor may struggle against. Articuno, Corviknight and Gliscor thus synergize well with each other and limit the opponent from sweeping through the team with Gliscor's Electric-type immunity. Gliscor also appreciates teammates like Thundurus-T and Zapdos that serve as an answer to Corviknight and threatening Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Urshifu-R, and Basculegion-F, which cause problems for Gliscor. Thundurus-T and Zapdos in return appreciate Gliscor spreading Toxic and setting entry hazards, as the accumulated chip damage lets them break other Pokemon with ease. Dragonite can switch into Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Choice Band Barraskewda and Urshifu-R. In return, Dragonite appreciates Gliscor's ability to absorb status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, which can otherwise greatly hamper its wallbreaking ability. Moltres helps Gliscor spread status against various physical threats like Kingambit and Chien-Pao, with the help of Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp while also pivoting in the rest of the team safely with the help of U-turn. Gliscor supports Choice Scarf Enamorus's cleaning ability due to its hazards and status allowing Enamorus to OHKO offensive threats like Choice Specs Greninja and Choice Specs Walking Wake. Gliscor also boosts Enamorus and Galarian Moltres's wallbreaking potential by serving as an answer to their common checks like Alolan Muk, Clodsire, and Galarian Slowking, thus enabling them to sweep late-game. Gyarados pairs well with Gliscor, as it can act like a check for Urshifu-R, Baxcalibur, and Chien-Pao, owing to its type combination and Intimidate ability. Gyarados can also rack up entry hazard damage with Dragon Tail, thus working well with Gliscor's entry hazards. Landorus is also a great teammate for Gliscor, as it can run Stealth Rock to allow Gliscor to run Spikes instead and threatens physical walls such as Galarian Weezing, Kommo-o, and Great Tusk with its coverage.</p>"

      "Swords Dance (Ground)": {
        "outdated": true,
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Gliscor is an excellent bulky sweeper for Ground teams, being able to use its superb bulk, status immunity, and Poison Heal recovery to easily set up Swords Dance multiple times and quickly snowball against more passive team archetypes such as Steel, Poison, Water stall, and opposing Ground. Knock Off serves as Gliscor’s secondary attacking move to accompany Earthquake, hitting targets immune to Earthquake such as Landorus and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also removing foes’ items, cutting off foes such as Corviknight and Galarian Weezing from Leftovers or Black Sludge recovery and offensively neutering threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Alternatively, Facade can be used as a strong neutral coverage option that smacks Enamorus, Galarian Moltres, and Galarian Weezing; however, running Facade means that Gliscor will be walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and will be unable to remove foes' items. Protect allows Gliscor to safely use Poison Heal to recover while scouting foes’ moves, which can be especially useful against Choice item users such as Iron Moth, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Additionally, Protect is particularly valuable against Ursaluna-B, as Gliscor can void its Blood Moon and use the following turn to set up Swords Dance. The given EVs maximize Gliscor’s Poison Heal recovery, allow Gliscor to outrun Modest Pelipper and Adamant Scizor, and maximize its ability to duel special attackers such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Ursaluna-B, and Choice Specs Dragapult.</p> <p>Clodsire is an extremely useful teammate to Gliscor due to its Water immunity via Water Absorb, serving as a crucial check to foes such as Walking Wake, Urshifu-R, and Basculegion-F. Moreover, Clodsire can offer Gliscor Toxic Spikes support, which synergizes brilliantly with Gliscor’s Protect and makes Gliscor even more threatening as a sweeper. In return, Gliscor can absorb burns and Knock Off for Clodsire, deal with threats such as Landorus, Hatterene, and Iron Treads without Ice Spinner, and provide a Ground immunity to counteract Clodsire's weakness. Mamoswine complements Gliscor excellently by offering an Ice resistance to compensate for Gliscor’s weakness, and with a Choice Band it can easily take care of impediments to Gliscor such as Corviknight, Articuno, and Dragonite. In exchange, Gliscor can absorb burns from foes such as Sableye and Moltres and offer a Fighting resistance to answer foes like Iron Valiant and Sneasler. Ursaluna-B is another great pairing to Gliscor, acting as a special wallbreaker that can blast through physical walls such as Quagsire, Dondozo, and Slowbro. Furthermore, with Vacuum Wave, Ursaluna-B can act as a check to Chien-Pao, and if using Calm Mind, it can overwhelm Corviknight variants that do not use Iron Defense. Gliscor returns the favor by taking on Iron Valiant, Choice Band Zamazenta, and Assault Vest Iron Hands for Ursaluna-B. Ursaluna-B can additionally tackle Hex Dragapult and Spectrier, which are otherwise very deadly to Gliscor. Landorus is another option for a special wallbreaker that can use Gravity to ground and threaten Corviknight. As another option, Landorus can also run a Choice Scarf, threatening Ogerpon-W, Chien-Pao, and Zamazenta and providing safe entry for Gliscor with U-turn. Choice Scarf Great Tusk can revenge kill Chien-Pao and can also handle Baxcalibur, Hisuian Samurott, Hydreigon. With Ice Spinner, Great Tusk can further eliminate Dragonite and Swords Dance Garchomp and, if using Megahorn, tear through Ogerpon-W. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Iron Treads can additionally beat Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur while also OHKOing Alolan Ninetales, Flutter Mane, and Enamorus. Quagsire can serve as a defensive answer to key menaces to Gliscor such as Azumarill and Swords Dance Chien-Pao and stack entry hazards to facilitate Gliscor’s sweep. Sandy Shocks can zap Corviknight and Slowbro for Gliscor, provide Gliscor with safe entry points with Volt Switch, and layer entry hazards for Gliscor.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Mamoswine is a staple pick for Ice teams, offering many useful traits, including a Fire neutrality via its ability Thick Fat, an Electric immunity that nullifies Thunder Wave and Volt Switch, and access to Stealth Rock. Mamoswine's primary attacking move is its strong STAB Earthquake, allowing it to threaten bulky Steel-types such as Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Magnezone, which is of great importance for Ice. Mamoswine's Earthquake finds further use as Ice's best way of dealing with Iron Hands, Toxapex, and Okidogi. Ice Shard lets Mamoswine circumvent its middling Speed and pick off weakened offensive threats such as Dragapult, Dragonite, Meowscarada, and Enamorus, as well as OHKO Landorus after Stealth Rock. Smack Down gives Mamoswine the capacity to threaten Corviknight with its powerful Earthquake and force it out, making it adept at keeping Stealth Rock up against Flying teams by making it difficult for Corviknight to use Defog. Smack Down provides further utility by allowing Mamoswine to ground and threaten Zapdos, 2HKO Articuno, and crucially OHKO defensively uninvested Volcarona. As an alternative to Smack Down, Icicle Crash can be used as a broadly powerful Ice-type STAB move that allows Mamoswine to better pressure targets such as Mandibuzz, Ursaluna-B, and Amoonguss, at the cost of making the Flying matchup more difficult. The given EVs render physically defensive Corviknight's Body Press a 3HKO against Mamoswine after Leftovers recovery while maximizing attack power, making Mamoswine much more effective at threatening Corviknight. Furthermore, they allow Mamoswine to live a +1 Flamethrower from offensive Volcarona and OHKO it in return with Smack Down, as well as outpace Adamant Kingambit and Iron Hands.</p> <p>Baxcalibur forms a fantastic offensive core with Mamoswine, providing a burn immunity via Thermal Exchange and a resistance to Water to compensate for Mamoswine's weaknesses. To complement Baxcalibur, Mamoswine sets Stealth Rock and removes bulky Steel-types, such as Empoleon and Corviknight, in order to pave the way for Baxcalibur's sweeping or wallbreaking. Alolan Ninetales pairs excellently with Mamoswine, setting snow and Aurora Veil to improve Mamoswine's defenses even further and dealing with the Fighting-types that threaten Mamoswine such as Urshifu-R and Iron Valiant. In return, Mamoswine can comfortably take Heavy Slams aimed at Alolan Ninetales under snow and threaten their users, including Hisuian Goodra, Iron Hands, and Iron Treads. Froslass can set Spikes to compound the offensive pressure that Mamoswine's Stealth Rock creates while also serving as a Fighting immunity and a spinblocker. Chien-Pao appreciates Mamoswine's Stealth Rock bringing foes down to KO ranges and breaking Ceruledge's Focus Sash to enable its sweeping and wallbreaking; it supports Mamoswine in turn by threatening problematic foes such as Gholdengo and Spectrier, as well as Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-W if using Choice Band. Frosmoth similarly benefits from Mamoswine setting Stealth Rock and breaking Steel-types such as Heatran, while it threatens physical walls such as Quagsire and Great Tusk in exchange. Alolan Sandslash can neutralize Toxic from foes such as Toxapex aimed at Mamoswine, threaten Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, and use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Amoonguss and Toxapex and open them up to being chipped by Stealth Rock. Moreover, both Alolan Sandslash and Avalugg can help prevent Mamoswine from being worn down by entry hazards by spinning them away. Cetitan and Cloyster are other sweepers on Ice to accompany Baxcalibur that benefit from the offensive pressure that Mamoswine's Stealth Rock creates. Cloyster greatly appreciates Mamoswine's Electric immunity, and Cetitan can only OHKO Corviknight at +6 after Stealth Rock.</p>"

      "Choice Band (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>Mamoswine is a great offensive option for Ground teams thanks to its huge Attack stat, access to priority, and unique STAB combination. Mamoswine's ability, Thick Fat, also allows for it to act as an extremely valuable resistance to Ice, meaning it can switch into foes like Articuno. Icicle Crash shreds Grass-type Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Sinistcha, and Flying-type Pokemon, such as Mandibuzz and Gliscor, that would otherwise resist or be immune to Ground-type moves. Icicle Crash is extremely threatening to Flying-type teams in particular, as most Flying-type Pokemon are 2HKOed by Icicle Crash, meaning there are no safe switchins. Ice Shard is a fantastic priority move that allows Mamoswine to stand its ground against faster Pokemon such as both Landorus formes, Cyclizar, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Knock Off is a good final option to help deal with walls that may take a bit more time to whittle down, such as Dondozo and Corviknight, as well as create permanent progress against Pokemon such as Baxcalibur and Articuno, which both rely heavily on their items, whether it be offensively or defensively.</p> <p>Mamoswine greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Quagsire, as the extra damage could be the difference between a 2HKO or an opportunity for an OHKO on lots of Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Meowscarada with Ice Shard, Icicle Crash on Corviknight, and Earthquake on Toxapex and Amoonguss. Clodsire is a good teammate for Mamoswine, as it can switch in to Water- and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Urshifu-R, Sneasler, and Walking Wake that would otherwise make quick work of Mamoswine, as well as provide Toxic and entry hazard support. Iron Treads is another good teammate for Mamoswine, as it keeps hazards off the field in order to prevent Mamoswine from being chipped down, as well as setts up hazards of its own. Alternatively, Choice Scarf Iron Treads outspeeds and hits Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, which both threaten Mamoswine, for super effective damage. Choice Scarf Great Tusk is another teammate that pairs well with Mamoswine. Great Tusk is able to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon that check Mamoswine such as Choice Specs Greninja and Cinderace. Once faster threats have been taken care of, Mamoswine will have an easy time breaking the opposing team with its extremely powerful attacks. Ursaluna-B is a great teammate for Mamoswine, as it can absorb status conditions from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Sableye, as well as threatening them back with its extremely powerful Blood Moon. Ursaluna-B is also capable of using Vacuum wave to snipe Chien-Pao. Gliscor can also absorb status moves, as well as absorbing status moves and Fighting-type attacks that Mamoswine does not want to deal with. Gliscor is also able to support Mamoswine with Spikes and Toxic. Landorus forms a potent offensive core with Mamoswine, destroying Physical walls such as Quagsire and Slowbro, while Mamoswine deals with special walls such as Gliscor and Gastrodon. Additionally, Landorus can set Gravity for Mamoswine so that it can freely spam Earthquake. Lastly, Sandy Shocks is capable of dealing with Pokemon such as Pelipper and Corviknight, as well as providing hazard and Gravity support. Mamoswine easily takes care of the Ground-types that would wall Sandy Shocks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Gallade is the premier Choice Scarf user on Psychic teams due to its great coverage options and incredible ability, Sharpness. Being able to fire off Sharpness-boosted Sacred Sword is incredibly valuable, as it hits the Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that give Psychic teams trouble for super effective damage, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Hisuian Goodra. Knock Off is a great way to make progress against bulkier teams, as well as dissuade Ghost-type Pokemon from switching in on a potential Sacred Sword. Night Slash is also an option to deal more consistent damage to Skeledirge and Gholdengo. Leaf Blade is used to threaten bulky Water-type Pokemon like Quagsire and Rotom-W, as well as OHKO Belly Drum Azumarill. Aqua Cutter is an option over Leaf Blade to hit Pokemon like Landorus, Volcarona and Moltres for super effective damage, but Leaf Blade is often better due to the amount of targets it hits. A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant, as it allows Gallade to outspeed and still OHKO Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Sneasler, while the extra attack from Adamant is not necessary as most of the moves Gallade uses receive a Sharpness boost.</p> <p>Espathra is a nice compliment to Gallade, as it appreciates Gallade's ability to deal with Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon like Gholdengo, Hisuian Goodra, Kingambit, and Ting-Lu, which Espathra has little way of hitting for even neutral damage, as well as its ability to remove special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk. Hoopa-U is also a great teammate for Gallade, as the speed of Gallade and sheer power of Hoopa-U synergize nicely to deal with both bulky and fast teams. Hoopa-U is able to threaten an OHKO on defensive staples such as Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Rotom-W with entry hazard support, while Gallade outspeeds Pokemon that would otherwise shut Hoopa-U down, such as Sneasler and Greninja. Armarouge is a strong partner for Gallade, as it provides a nice resistance to Fairy-type attacks and complementary coverage to Gallade's. Armarouge appreciates the removal of special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Galarian Slowking, allowing it to set up and apply pressure to the opposing team, and it returns the favor by taking out physically bulky foes such as Dondozo, Zamazenta, and Corviknight. Hatterene is Psychic teams' best form of hazard control, which Gallade appreciates as it tends to switch in frequently and can otherwise get chipped. Hatterene also lures in Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon like Iron Treads and Sneasler, which Gallade can take care of. Indeedee is another good teammate for Gallade, as it sets up Psychic Terrain, further strengthening Gallade's Psycho Cut and protecting it from priority moves like Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch. Indeedee also provides a valuable Ghost immunity, which prevents foes like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo from freely spamming Shadow Ball. Scream Tail is a great defensive teammate for Gallade, as its incredible bulk allows it to switch in to common Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Meowscarada, which would otherwise outspeed and OHKO Gallade. Scream Tail's access to a myriad of utility moves, such as Thunder Wave and Wish, allows it to support Gallade nicely by slowing down the aforementioned threats and increasing its longevity. Mew is a good teammate for Gallade on more offense-oriented teams, as lead Mew is the premier hazard setter for Psychic teams, and Gallade greatly appreciates the support. Galarian Slowking is a great teammate for Gallade as well, as it is able to safely switch into special attacks, as well as Fairy-type attacks that would otherwise give Gallade trouble. Galarian Slowking can also utilize Chilly Reception to give Gallade a free switch in.</p>"

      "Assault Vest (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<p>Gallade offers incredible value to Fighting teams due to its Sharpness ability, access to a variety of slicing moves, and Assault Vest complementing its natural specially defensive bulk, giving the invaluable utility to beat threatening Psychic-type Pokemon such as Espathra, Latios, and Choice Specs Greninja. Psycho Cut is able to help combat a plethora of Poison-type Pokemon that annoy Fighting teams such as Galarian Weezing, Toxapex, and Amoonguss. Sacred Sword complements Psycho Cut by threatening Dark-type Pokemon that attempt to switch-in while also having the incredible ability to ignore Defense raises such as Archaludon's Stamina and Iron Defense users such as Skarmory, Zamazenta, and Klefki. Night Slash is another boosted coverage option that deals with threatening Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as the aforementioned Espathra, Latias, Gholdengo, and Sinistcha. Knock Off is a possible alternative that provides the utility of removing items such as Rocky Helmet and Heavy Duty Boots but lacks the consistent damage output of Night Slash. Shadow Sneak complements Night Slash and Knock Off by being useful priority that can threaten and revenge kill fast Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult, Iron Boulder, and the aforementioned Espathra. 96 Speed EVs enables Gallade to outspeed Modest Magnezone while the given investment in HP and Special Defense in tandem with Assault Vest, allowing Gallade to survive an attack from Choice Specs Flutter Mane in order to OHKO it back with Psycho Cut, alleviating pressure on Fighting teams.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is an essential teammate for Gallade, being able to remove troublesome Dark-type Pokemon such as Sableye and Mandibuzz. Great Tusk is another incredible teammate, providing a defensive switch-in for physical attackers that could otherwise overwhelm Gallade such as Excadrill, Gouging Fire, and Kingambit. Great Tusk also has the utility of removing entry hazards, which could otherwise hinder Gallade. Sneasler complements Gallade by removing Fairy-type Pokemon such as Enamorus, Hatterene, Primarina, and Iron Valiant. Sneasler also has utility in crippling set up Pokemon with Switcheroo, spreading status via Poison Touch and Dire Claw and pivoting with U-turn so that Gallade can enter the battlefield at the most opportune times. Keldeo is an incredible teammate that complements Gallade by removing physical walls such as Hippowdon, Skeledirge, and Gliscor. Zamazenta is a strong partner for Gallade, being able to take on high Speed Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Barraskewda, and Chien-Pao. Iron Hands is a useful teammate, being able to sponge Flying-type STAB coverage from Pokemon such as Galarian Zapdos, Galarian Moltres, and Tornadus. Breloom is another option that helps Gallade by inflicting sleep, crippling troublesome foes such as Skeledirge and Torkoal, as well as putting offensive pressure on physical walls such as Slowbro and Quagsire. Similarly, Hisuian Lilligant is a physical sweeper that thrives on Gallade's ability to remove its checks in Pokemon such as Latias, Greninja, and Volcarona. Galarian Zapdos offers a Ground-immune Pokemon to add aditional protection from threats such as Excadrill and Great Tusk.</p>"

Taunt prevents hazards and status from foes such as Toxapex, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, and is also used to deny Defog from Corviknight or Talonflame. However, it must be careful as most Corviknight and Talonflame can simply attack Froslass for super effective damage. When paired with Focus Sash, Taunt increases the chances of Froslass taking an opponent down with Destiny Bond, but it can also be used in tandem with Mental Herb to punish opponents like Sableye, Grimmsnarl, and opposing Froslass that attempt to Taunt Froslass, Taunting them in return. Spikes serves to punish switches on the opponent's side and weaken their team, allowing for Froslass's teammates to clean late-game. Shadow Ball is Froslass's answer to Hatterene, 2HKOing it as it comes in to bounce Spikes back, and it's Froslass's main source of damage to prevent it from being too passive. Froslass's last moveslot can utilize Destiny Bond to take an opponent down with it, but Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are also options to consider as they allow you to status Pokemon that like to play around Destiny Bond, such as Kingambit and Volcarona. Focus Sash is the preferred item as it ensures that Froslass will always get at least one layer of Spikes up, but Mental Herb can also be used to ignore Taunt from faster leads while Heavy Duty-Boots allows Froslass to safely switch back in to block spinners such as Cyclizar and Quaquaval.</p> <p>All of Froslass's teammates appreciate it spreading Spikes on the opposing field and preventing hazards from going up on theirs. After Spikes, Choice Band Chien Pao 2HKOes Iron Hands, while Shell Smash Cloyster and Belly Drum Cetitan can attempt to set up and sweep without fear of getting stopped by an opposing Focus Sash. Similarily, Iron Defense Avalugg also benefit from the opportunities to set up against foes that have been burned by Froslass and no longer pose much of a threat to it. Avalugg can also support Froslass by switching into strong physical attacks to scout. Abomasnow's Snow Warning increases Froslass's physical bulk and makes it less wary of other attacks coming from spinners, such as Great Tusk's Knock Off.</p>"

      "Suicide Lead (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Froslass is the premier lead on Ghost teams thanks to its blazing Speed stat allowing it to comfortably outpace other fast leads like Alolan Ninetales, Galvantula, and Garchomp. Setting up Spikes is Froslass's main job, wearing down switch-ins to Ghost-type attacks such as Alolan Muk, Ursaluna-B, and Hoopa-U. Taunt is used to prevent other leads like Sandy Shocks, Torkoal, and Mamoswine from getting their entry hazards up, along with stopping status moves from the likes of Galarian Weezing and Talonflame. Destiny Bond allows Froslass to take foes down once it has finished setting Spikes, along with creating mind games around when it will be used. Finally, Ice Beam when running a Timid nature and Triple Axel when running Jolly are Froslass's main STAB moves, with Ice Beam threatening Ground- and Flying-types like Garchomp, Gliscor, and Enamorus straight away. Meanwhile, Triple Axel can break past Focus Sash on other leads like Breloom, along with having a higher but less consistent damage output.</p> <p>The more pressure Froslass causes as a lead, the happier its teammates will be. Flutter Mane, for example, enjoys Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra being unable to take multiple Choice Specs Moonblasts when it comes in, which can open it up majorly against Poison- and Dragon-type teams that cannot stop its special offense. Ceruledge enjoys not having its Focus Sash broken by entry hazards, which are prevented by Taunt, and loves chip damage on would-be checks, including Archaludon and Overqwil. Gengar can help with hazard-stacking by setting up Toxic Spikes, forcing threats like Ting-Lu, Tyranitar, and Primarina onto timers they can't outlast. Dragapult enjoys Fairy-types, including Iron Valiant and Primarina, which naturally tank its Dragon-type STAB moves, to be chipped upon entry for its boosted Phantom Force to pick them off. Gholdengo's ability, Gold as Gold, blocks Defog from the likes of Corviknight and Galarian Weezing, keeping Spikes pressure up even longer, and Gholdengo itself can remove Hatterene trying to prevent Froslass's Spikes. Spectrier enjoys Ghost-resistant foes being chipped down throughout a game so that they cannot handle its threatening Grim Neigh boosts.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Rotom-W is the premier physical wall for Electric teams due to Levitate and its bulk, which make it a great help in the Ground matchup, its ability to spread burns, and its resistance to Ice and Water, which is great against Mamoswine. Will-O-Wisp is an excellent move for significantly weakening physical threats such as Barraskewda, Chien-Pao, Great Tusk, and Kingambit. Hydro Pump threatens Ground-type Pokemon that Electric teams would otherwise struggle against, such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Mamoswine. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W's more threatening wallbreaking teammates to come in more easily. Foul Play enables Rotom-W to hit Baxcalibur, which cannot be burned, Dragonite, and physically oriented Dragapult. It also prevents Rotom-W from becoming setup fodder. Protect is a solid option to give Rotom-W an extra turn to recover some HP, inflict more burn damage on foes, and potentially scout what set the opponent may be running, which is especially valuable versus Choice-locked enemies such as Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. The given EV spread maximizes Rotom-W's physical bulk while also allowing it to outspeed and burn Jolly Azumarill.</p> <p>Assault Vest Magnezone forms a nice defensive core with Rotom-W, where Magnezone is able to act as a special wall, while Rotom-W is able to act as a physical wall, as well as switch in on Ground-type attacks that would otherwise make quick work of Magnezone. Magnezone can also switch into attacks from Pokemon like Hatterene, Gholdengo, and Flutter Mane and Toxic from the likes of Amoonguss, Mandibuzz, and Toxapex, as well as forming a nice Volt Switch pivot core. Iron Hands is another great teammate for Rotom-W. Not only is Iron Hands able to come in for free after a Volt Switch from Rotom-W, but Rotom-W is also able to burn opposing Pokemon to bolster Iron Hands's Longevity. Iron Hands is also capable of taking care of Meowscarada, Hisuian Goodra, and Ogerpon-W. Defensive Zapdos is able to make quick work of pesky Grass-type Pokemon that stop Rotom-W in its tracks, such as Ogerpon-H, Ogerpon-W, Amoonguss, and Sinistcha. Sandy Shocks is the best entry hazard setter for Electric teams, and it pairs nicely with Rotom-W, which can force uncomfortable switches thanks to the looming threat of Will-O-Wisp. The revolving door of Volt Switches can force a lot of damage on opposing teams, thus making games easier to close out. Thundurus-T's array of coverage makes it a great teammate for Rotom-W. Thundurus-T can use Grass Knot to deal with Pokemon such as Quagsire and Gastrodon, as well as Psychic to deal with Pokemon like Amoonguss and Clodsire. Pawmot can use Seed Bomb to threaten Quagsire, Gastrodon, and opposing Rotom-W while also hitting Hydreigon, Baxcalibur and Ursaluna-B with STAB Close Combat. Regieleki can use its blistering Speed tier to take care of Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, while also using Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock to keep Rotom-W alive for a longer period of time.</p>"

Substitute lets it avoid status and take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Klefki and Toxapex, eases prediction, and forces its checks such as Greninja and Ting-Lu to take damage. The given EV spread prevents Rotom-W's Substitute from breaking to Clodsire's Poison Jab while outspeeding threats such as Gholdengo and Kleavor.</p> <p>Teammates such as Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks and Iron Hands love Rotom-W's ability to deal with or wear down bulky Pokemon such as Clodsire and Gastrodon, allowing them to clean up types like Poison and Water late-game. In return, Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks deals with fast threats such as Choice Specs Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Scovillain, while Iron Hands pressures matchups such as Dark and Dragon due to its sheer bulk and coverage in Ice Punch. Pawmot can revive Rotom-W with Revival Blessing, which allows it to take more risks. Additionally, Pawmot has good coverage moves in Seed Bomb and Ice Punch, which lets it break down types such as Water, Flying, and Ground alongside Rotom-W. Choice Specs Kilowattrel deals with fast threats such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Choice Specs Greninja, and Volcarona, removes Grass-types like Amoonguss and Breloom, and pivots Rotom-W in with Volt Switch or U-turn. Assault Vest users such as Magnezone and Eelektross deal with special attackers such as Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Greninja for Rotom-W.

        "description": "<p>Substitute + Nasty Plot Rotom-W is a great wallbreaker for Water teams. By virtue of its Ground immunity thanks to Levitate and its part Electric typing, it eases the Ground, Water mirror, and Flying matchups. Thunderbolt threatens a multitude of metagame staples such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Toxapex. Discharge, although having less power than Thunderbolt, has a decent chance to spread paralysis, potentially hindering setup attempts from the likes of Dragonite and Dragapult. Stored Power in conjunction with Nasty Plot allows Rotom-W to threaten Poison- and Fighting-types such as Clodsire, Amoonguss, and Great Tusk. Substitute allows Rotom-W to take advantage of passive walls like Toxapex and Swampert to set up a Nasty Plot. 144 HP and 112 Defense EVs allow Rotom-W's Substitute to withstand a Poison Jab from Clodsire, while 88 Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed Adamant Scizor.</p> <p>Toxapex is a nice defensive partner for Rotom-W, as its Poison typing and natural bulk help against Grass-types such as Meowscarada and Ogerpon-H. In return, Rotom-W handles Ground-types that Toxapex struggles with like Great Tusk and Gliscor. Entry hazard support from the likes of Swampert and Hisuian Samurott helps Rotom-W wallbreak. Swampert also acts as a slow pivot, bringing Rotom-W in safely against Corviknight and Great Tusk, while Hisuian Samurott takes on fast Ghost-types such as Dragapult and Gholdengo. Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo, Greninja, and Urshifu-R act as speed control against speedy threats. Keldeo and Urshifu-R threaten Choice Specs Iron Moth, Roaring Moon, and Landorus, while Greninja threatens Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Ogerpon-W. Primarina handles Dragon-types such as Latios, Gouging Fire, and Roaring Moon, and in return, Rotom-W handles passive Poison-types such as Toxapex and Clodsire. Lastly, Rotom-W's wallbreaking allows sweepers like Ogerpon-W to clean late-game.</p>"

      "Special Defensive Wall (Fire)": {
        "description": "<p>Possessing a great typing and a high Special Defense stat, Heatran finds itself as both an amazing utility Pokemon and specially defensive wall for Fire teams, utilizing its bulk and Steel typing to sponge attacks from prominent special-attacking threats that otherwise rip apart most Fire-types, such as Dragapult and Latios. Heatran's Steel typing also allows it to take neutral damage from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Power Gem, avoiding up to a 3HKO after Stealth Rock damage. Heavy Slam OHKOes Flutter Mane while also hitting the aforementioned Dragapult and Latios. Magma Storm is a strong STAB move that does immense damage and allows Heatran to trap and 1v1 foes such as Toxapex. However, Magma Storm lacks accuracy in comparison to Lava Plume, the weaker-yet-safer option that trades trapping and residual damage in favor of more PP and a chance to burn prominent physical attackers such as Swampert and Dragonite. Earth Power pairs nicely to hit opposing Fire-, Rock-, and Poison-types such as opposing Heatran, Glimmora, and Toxapex. Stealth Rock provides entry hazards to Fire teams, allowing them to rack up further chip damage and break Focus Sash or Sturdy on Pokemon like Skarmory, Ogerpon-C, and Ceruledge. 28 Speed EVs with a Sassy nature allows Heatran to outspeed Skarmory, Sinistcha, and Volcanion with no Speed investment, with the rest of its EVs maximizing its special bulk. Air Balloon allows Heatran to turn its 4x weakness to Ground-type attack, allowing it to temporarily check certain Ground types such as Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Choice Scarf Landorus if it is locked into Earth Power. Most important of all, Air Balloon paired with Flash Fire allows Heatran to check Gouging Fire, one of the most potent threats to Fire teams.</p> <p>Heatran primarily serves to provide a defensive backbone to Fire teams' usually offensively focused cores. The main two Pokemon that Fire tends to be built around are Ogerpon-H and Gouging Fire. Ogerpon-H helps in wallbreaking Water and Ground teams, and Heatran helps cover Ogerpon-H by switching into potential revenge killers, such as Choice Specs Greninja and Choice Scarf Landorus's Sludge Wave. Gouging Fire excels in mirror and Dragon matchups, hindered only by opposing Gouging Fire, which Heatran can switch into and pressure out. Focus Sash Ceruledge is also a commonly used Swords Dance sweeper that can help clean through types such as Ghost and Psychic. Heatran's Stealth Rock can help Ceruledge get past opposing Focus Sash Ceruledge and turn the +2 Shadow Sneak roll on Iron Boulder into a guaranteed OHKO. Ninetales is a strong option, as its ability to set sun enables every Fire-type Pokemon to deal increased Fire-type damage and absorb Water-type moves much easier, notably letting Heatran switch into Choice Specs Greninja Hydro Pump and perfectly avoid a 2HKO. Cinderace and Talonflame are both options on Fre-teams for hazard control with Court Change and Defog respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Air Balloon (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Heatran's Flash Fire ability is an invaluable asset to Steel teams, as they are otherwise completely mowed down by powerful Fire-types like Gouging Fire and Volcarona. Heatran is a very reliable Stealth Rock setter, capable of threatening most entry hazard removers like Corviknight, Torkoal, and Galarian Weezing with its powerful Fire- and Ground-type coverage moves. Magma Storm lets Heatran effectively trap and KO bulky pivots, like Toxapex, with a combination of Magma Storm's passive damage and Earth Power as coverage. Power Gem allows Heatran to effectively hit the Fire-types it's meant to wall, easily OHKOing Moltres and Volcarona, both of which can easily take an Earth Power from Heatran.</p> <p>Heatran appreciates Corviknight as a teammate, as it offers an immunity to Ground and a neutrality to Fighting while also granting Heatran a safe entry onto the field with its slow U-turn. Other Ground-immune teammates, like Skarmory, and Air Balloon users, like Gholdengo, find themselves alongside Heatran to pivot into Ground-type attacks for Heatran in the event that Heatran's Air Balloon gets popped. Skarmory and Gholdengo also create a great entry hazard-stacking core with Heatran, as Skarmory provides Spikes and Gholdengo blocks Defog and Rapid Spin. Archaludon and Hisuian Goodra offer a Water resistance for Heatran, the former of which appreciates Heatran using Stealth Rock to free up a moveslot of its own. Choice Scarf Iron Treads offers much-needed speed control and an immunity to Electric-type attacks from the likes of Zapdos and Thundurus-T. Furthermore, Iron Treads takes out threats to Heatran like Landorus and Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine with Ice Spinner and Earthquake, respectively. Setup sweepers like Kingambit and Scizor appreciate Heatran weakening bulky walls like Haze Toxapex and Unaware Quagsire to facilitate a sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive (Steel)": {
        "outdated": true,
        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Heatran is an invaluable part of any Steel team. It is a fantastic check to many metagame staples that Steel would greatly struggle to otherwise deal with, such as Volcarona, Corviknight, Skeledirge, Zapdos, and Iron Moth. It serves Steel teams consistently well even outside of these problem matchups due to its great natural bulk, plethora of useful resistances including a crucial immunity to Fire via Flash Fire, and utility for its team through its access to Stealth Rock and capacity to spread burns.</p> <p>Lava Plume is Heatran’s primary attacking move, which not only hits neutral targets hard due to Heatran’s naturally good Special Attack but also has a 30% chance to burn foes. Fire’s nature as an attacking type that has no natural immunities means Heatran can use Lava Plume many times throughout the course of a game to generate progress with minimal risk. The burn chance of Lava Plume makes Heatran incredibly risky for foes to switch into, as physical attackers such as Great Tusk that could threaten a KO on Heatran do not want to risk the possibility of being burned and having their offensive power crippled. Furthermore, walls such as Toxapex also fear being burned, as the passive damage will affect their longevity over the course of a game. Earth Power is the only coverage necessary for Heatran, giving it the capability to easily break through foes such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth. It is notable that an EV spread including 56 Special Attack EVs will allow Heatran to OHKO offensive opposing Heatran with Earth Power. Heatran serves as an excellent setter of Stealth Rock due to its propensity to easily force switches against Pokemon such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Amoonguss. Protect rounds out Heatran’s moveset, not only giving it the chance to extend its longevity via Leftovers and accumulate burn damage on foes but also the capability to scout foes’ movesets, which can be especially useful when facing off against foes using Choice items. One should be careful when using Protect not to fall into predictable patterns and give foes the chance to set up on Heatran, however. Magma Storm can be used instead of Lava Plume to trap and eliminate foes such as Toxapex and force damage against bulky threats such as Iron Hands; the passive damage synergizes well with Protect, but Magma Storm's low PP and accuracy makes it less consistent throughout longer games. Taunt is an option that can be used place of Stealth Rock that synergizes particularly well with Magma Storm, preventing foes from using recovery moves, getting entry hazards up, or setting up on Heatran. However, a lack of Speed investment means it will have somewhat limited utility. As another option to Stealth Rock, Power Gem easily OHKOes Moltres, which walls Heatran otherwise, and prevents bulky Volcarona sets from outlasting Heatran. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp can be used over Stealth Rock in conjunction with an investment of 40 Speed EVs to allow Heatran to outspeed and burn maximum Speed Adamant Kingambit. If desired, it is also possible to run one of the aforementioned alternative options of Taunt, Power Gem, or Will-O-Wisp instead of Protect, but this comes at the cost of significantly impacting Heatran's longevity and foregoing Protect's scouting utility.</p> <p>Heatran serves as one of the three pillars of Steel’s “immunity trinity” along with Corviknight and Gholdengo; combined, these three offer immunities to Steel’s core weaknesses of Fire, Ground, and Fighting, forming an excellent defensive backbone for any Steel team. Corviknight is Heatran’s most important partner, being able to nullify Ground moves targeted at Heatran while Heatran in turn blocks Fire moves aimed at Corviknight. Furthermore, Corviknight can also threaten prominent Fighting-types in the metagame such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler with its STAB Brave Bird. With a physically defensive pivot set, Corviknight further synergizes with specially defensive Heatran by being able to soak up physical hits while Heatran takes special ones, having the ability to remove opposing Stealth Rock and Spikes to prevent Heatran from being worn down by entry hazards over the course of a game and providing Heatran with opportunities to switch in safely via U-turn. Bulk Up Corviknight appreciates Heatran too, as Stealth Rock and burn support can increase its sweeping potential. Gholdengo completes the immunity trinity by voiding Fighting moves aimed at Heatran. Gholdengo can further support Heatran by blocking Corrosion Toxic from Glimmora thanks to Good as Gold; this ability combined with Gholdengo's Ghost typing also lets it completely prevent the removal of Heatran's Stealth Rock, as Gholdengo blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog. With an Air Balloon, Gholdengo can block Ground-type moves and use Nasty Plot to break through walls, both of which Heatran appreciates. Alternatively, using a Choice Scarf, Gholdengo can switch into Enamorus and outspeed and OHKO it in return, and it can use Trick to cripple opposing special walls such as Toxapex and Blissey or lock sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite into setup moves to prevent them from exploiting Heatran. Outside of the immunity trinity, Hisuian Goodra also makes a good pairing with Heatran due to its unique Water resistance on Steel and capacity to threaten opposing Water-types such as Basculegion-F and Greninja with Thunderbolt. Hisuian Goodra can also check Hydreigon and Walking Wake, which both wall and exploit Heatran. Moreover, Hisuian Goodra can act as a switch-in to opposing Heatran and threaten it with Earthquake, and it is able to survive an Earth Power from Landorus and OHKO it in return with Ice Beam if necessary. Iron Treads can spin away hazards for Heatran without removing Heatran’s Stealth Rock, set Stealth Rock itself to free Heatran to use other moves if desired, and serve as an offensive check to Sandy Shocks with its STAB Earthquake as well as Landorus with Ice Spinner, which Heatran’s other teammates can struggle to handle. Physical sweepers such as Kingambit and Scizor are grateful for Heatran’s ability to absorb Will-O-Wisp for them, and they can clean up teams Heatran has worn down with Stealth Rock and chip damage. Klefki can complement Heatran's Stealth Rock with its own Spikes while taking advantage of Heatran's Fire immunity, which can help break down opposing teams faster as they switch around to deal with the immunity trinity. It should be noted that this is by no means an exhaustive list of potential teammates for Heatran; all Steel-type Pokemon in the metagame appreciate Heatran’s Fire immunity, and no Pokemon currently competes with Heatran in this regard.</p>"

Psychic allows Manaphy to break through many Pokemon troublesome for Water teams, such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Clodsire.

Manaphy appreciates Electric-immune teammates like Swampert and Quagsire, both of which can set up entry hazards to support Manaphy's wallbreaking. Since Ogerpon-W can very easily pivot into Manaphy and pose a huge threat to it and its teammates, offensive checks to it are a necessity for Manaphy to succeed, such as Sludge Wave Greninja, Choice Scarf X-Scissor Hisuian Samurott, and Hurricane Pelipper. In return, Manaphy opens up holes in the opponent's defenses for these faster teammates to clean up late-game. Grass-neutral teammates like Toxapex, Tentacruel, and Ogerpon-W all help shore up Manaphy’s weaknesses as well. Tentacruel provides great hazard control with both Toxic Spikes and Rapid Spin, and with Rain Dish it can stay quite healthy in the Rain. Ogerpon-W outspeeds powerful threats to Manaphy like Landorus and Thundurus-T and can KO them with rain-boosted Ivy Cudgel. Should Manaphy be paired with Drizzle Pelipper, the Rain allows Manaphy's Hydration to shrug off status effects, making it impossible to wear down with poison or slow down with paralysis.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Darkrai is an incredible revenge killer for Dark teams due to its colorful coverage options and an incredible Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed common Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada, Iron Boulder, Sneasler, and Greninja. Sludge Bomb is a crucial coverage move, threatening Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Primarina while also hitting the Ogerpon formes. Psychic lets Darkrai handle Fighting-types like Sneasler, Urshifu-R, and Okidogi, while Ice Beam deals with Ground- and Dragon-types like the Landorus formes, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Trick lets Darkrai hinder walls like Clodsire, Corviknight, and Ting-Lu, which switch into it. Alternatively, Focus Blast targets Dark- and Steel-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Archaludon, and Heatran.</p> <p>Physical attackers like Weavile, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon can eliminate special walls like Clodsire, Swampert, and Hisuian Goodra; Choice Specs Greninja can also weaken foes like Archaludon, Corviknight, and Toxapex as well as aid against Fighting- and Fairy-types with Extrasensory and Sludge Wave, respectively, allowing Darkrai to clean up late-game. In return, Darkrai can deal with faster threats like non-Choice Scarf Dragapult and common Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant, Meowscarada, and Sneasler that threaten them. Alolan Muk and Kingambit threaten Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, Clefable, and Primarina, while Darkrai can handle Ground-types such as the Landorus formes, Hippowdon, and Gliscor with Ice Beam. Sableye provides a Fighting immunity and can cripple foes like Zamazenta, Iron Hands, and Gallade with Will-O-Wisp. Ting-Lu is a great partner, setting entry hazards, wearing down bulky foes, and enabling Darkrai to OHKO threats like Hydreigon, Kyurem, Great Tusk, and Enamorus. Mandibuzz provides entry hazard removal and safe entry to Darkrai using U-turn, along with checking threats such as Scizor and Belly Drum Azumarill.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Darkrai, with its access to Nasty Plot, great offensive stats, and a colorful coverage pool, makes for a very threatening wallbreaker, being faster than common Pokemon that threaten Dark teams such as Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Tornadus-T. Darkrai has three main choices when selecting a coverage move. At +2, Psychic primarily helps against Fighting-type Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Iron Valiant, while Focus Blast defeats Steel-type Pokemon that can otherwise stomach its potent attacks such as Kingambit and Hisuian Goodra. Alternatively, Ice Beam can help alleviate the Ground and Flying matchups, notably being able to OHKO Gliscor. Substitute allows Darkrai to add an extra layer of protection against predicted switches by Pokemon such as Klefki and non-Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Hypnosis can be used over Substitute in order to give Darkrai a free turn to do as it pleases while also neutering slower foes such as Articuno and Alolan Muk. Focus Sash can be used over Leftovers in order to guarantee that Darkrai is able to use Hypnosis against faster threats such as Zamazenta.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja and Air Balloon Kingambit make a fantastic offensive core when paired with Darkrai. Greninja can help alleviate the Flying and Ground matchups if Darkrai decides to forego Ice Beam and Psychic while also being able to add pressure against Fighting and Fairy teams thanks to its access to coverage such as Extrasensory and Sludge Wave. In return, Darkrai is able to weaken common checks such as Articuno and Hisuian Goodra after a Nasty Plot. Kingambit helps Darkrai by switching in and forcing out Pokemon that can revenge kill Darkrai such as Choice Scarf Iron Treads and Excadrill under sand. Sableye and Ting-Lu form a defensive core for Darkrai, as Sableye is able to wear down specially defensive Pokemon such as Clodsire and Corviknight with access to Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp while also being able to use Encore against threatening setup sweepers such as Zamazenta and Gouging Fire, all while providing an invaluable Fighting immunity. Ting-Lu is able to switch into strong special attackers such as Flutter Mane, Enamorus, and Hatterene while threatening them back with Heavy Slam; it is also able to set a wide array of entry hazards, which makes Darkrai's job of wallbreaking or sweeping easier. Alternatively, Alolan Muk can switch into Fairy-type attacks while also providing further utility with Knock Off and Poison Touch. Mandibuzz provides entry hazard removal, which keeps Darkrai's Focus Sash intact if it is being used while also providing a Ground immunity. Lastly, Choice Scarf Meowscarada is able to revenge kill faster threats such as Dragapult, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and opposing Choice Scarf Greninja.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is one of Water’s best options for a Choice Scarf user. This is owed to its great STAB combination, of which both types are resisted by only a scant few Pokemon in the metagame, higher power than what is initially apparent due to Sharpness bolstering its slicing moves, a good Speed tier that allows it to outspeed and revenge kill key threats such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and unique progress-making utility for Water in the form of Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off.</p> <p>Ceaseless Edge is Hisuian Samurott’s most important move, allowing it not only to threaten and KO foes with the raw power of a Sharpness-boosted Dark-type STAB move but also set up a layer of Spikes with each use, putting pressure on opposing teams and potentially opening up holes in defensive cores for its teammates to exploit. It is important to note that Spikes laid by Ceaseless Edge cannot be reflected by Magic Bounce, meaning Hisuian Samurott can safely click Ceaseless Edge against Hatterene and still get Spikes up. Hisuian Samurott’s secondary STAB move is a choice between Aqua Cutter and Razor Shell. Aqua Cutter is generally preferred for its consistency due it not making contact with the opponent and its perfect accuracy, allowing Hisuian Samurott to safely deal with Volcarona and Moltres. However, Razor Shell is guaranteed to OHKO Flutter Mane and provides Hisuian Samurott with more wallbreaking capability due to its 50% chance to reduce Defense if the user is willing to tolerate the risk of missing. Sacred Sword serves as an excellent coverage option, allowing Hisuian Samurott to eliminate foes such as Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and opposing Hisuian Samurott. Finally, Knock Off provides Hisuian Samurott with a secondary utility in the form of item removal, which can cripple Leftovers users such as Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Toxapex and open up Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Amoonguss to being chipped down by entry hazards, making Hisuian Samurott even riskier for foes to switch into.</p> <p>In terms of teammates, physically defensive Rotom-W is an excellent partner for Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott, checking several of Hisuian Samurott’s bad matchups such as Azumarill, Garchomp, and Scarf Great Tusk and providing Hisuian Samurott with safe opportunities to come in via Volt Switch. Toxapex is another great teammate for Hisuian Samurott, being able to switch into and take hits repeatedly from faster Choice Scarf users such as Sneasler, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant thanks to its defensive typing coupled with Regenerator and Recover. Moreover, Toxapex can serve as an answer to Urshifu-R and can compound on the pressure of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes with its own Toxic Spikes, while benefitting itself from Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes punishing foes switching around. Gastrodon or Quagsire can absorb Electric-type moves for Hisuian Samurott and set up Stealth Rock to compliment Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes. Wallbreakers such as Urshifu-R, Greninja, Basculegion-M, and Walking Wake as well as sweepers such as Basculegion-F also synergize well with Hisuian Samurott, with Spikes support allowing them to more easily break through enemy teams and the speed control from Choice Scarf meaning potential revenge killers can be removed ahead of time. The speed control from Choice Scarf is still useful even on rain teams even when accompanied by Swift Swim Pokemon such as Basculegion-F, as rain will not always be present on the battlefield. Furthermore, either forme of Basculegion can serve as a spinblocker to prevent the removal of Hisuian Samurott’s Spikes.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill is typically overshadowed by the same-typed Iron Treads, but Excadrill finds a niche on Steel-type teams as a Choice Scarf user. Iron Treads provides more utility, as well as being able to OHKO Landorus with Ice Spinner, while Excadrill provides more immediate power and has fewer switch-ins thanks to Mold Breaker. Excadrill is a valuable revenge killer and is able to spam Earthquake without being worried about Levitate users such as Latios, Rotom-W, and Galarian Weezing.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Excadrill makes use of its high Attack and Speed to serve as a solid Choice Scarf user for Steel teams. Mold Breaker, alongside Earthquake, notably eases the Dragon matchup, as Excadrill can ignore Levitate from the likes of Latios, Latias, and Hydreigon. Iron Head allows Excadrill to hit Fairy- and Ice-types such as Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Kyurem. Rock Slide allows Excadrill to threaten Flying-types such as Zapdos and Dragonite that would hope to switch into Earthquake. Since Iron Treads is typically replaced by Excadrill, Rapid Spin is a logical last move and is the best way for Steel team to remove entry hazards from only their side of the field.</p> <p>Gholdengo is a solid teammate for Excadrill, as not only can it switch into Fighting-type attacks, but it can use Thunder Wave to slow down opposing Choice Scarf users to ensure Excadrill outspeeds them, such as Greninja, Hisuian Samurott, and Latios. Gholdengo also appreciates the removal of Gouging Fire and Alolan Muk so that it can spam Shadow Ball without worry. Skarmory has a Ground immunity and provides entry hazard support in the form of Spikes, which makes Excadrill's job easier. Archaludon is also capable of using Thunder Wave, targeting Pokemon such as Gouging Fire and Ceruledge, and it can provide additional entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock. In return, Excadrill can remove faster Fairy-type threats that would otherwise check Archaludon, such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane. Air Balloon Heatran can act as a temporary Ground immunity, as well as being able to safely switch into Fire-type attacks that would otherwise make quick work of Excadrill. Empoleon and Hisuian Goodra procide Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Dragapult and Darkrai and resist Water. Empoleon also has the added benefit of deterring Defog via Competitive, as well as being a slow pivot option via Flip Turn.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Sand Rush, in tandem with a colossal Attack stat, makes Excadrill a terrifying attacker on sand-based Ground-type teams, outspeeding even Choice Scarf Meowscarada while sand is active. Earthquake 2HKOes some of the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame, such as Primarina and Amoonguss, as well as 2HKOing Slowbro and Garchomp after some hazard support. Iron Head hits Ice- and Fairy-type Pokemon such as Chien-Pao, Enamorus, and Galarian-Weezing, as well as Pokemon with Levitate such as Latias. Rock Slide helps target Flying-type Pokemon such as Zapdos, Dragonite, and Talonflame. Poison Jab can be used to hit pesky Grass-type Pokemon that would otherwise be a major nuisance to Ground-type teams such as Ogerpon-W, Ogerpon-H, and Meowscarada. Alternatively, X-Scissor can be used to hit Psychic-, Dark-, and some Grass-type Pokemon such as Slowbro, Latios, Hydreigon, and Serperior.</p> <p>Hippowdon is a mandatory teammate for Excadrill, as not only does it provide sand, but it also provides entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock. It also provides Excadrill a safe switch via Eject Button. Hippowdon is also capable of taking on physically oriented threats such as Kingambit, Iron Hands, and Gouging Fire. Landorus-T and Gliscor are great teammates, as they can both switch into the Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that make quick work of Excadrill. Landorus is also capable of using Gravity to enable Excadrill's Earthquake to hit absolutely everything. Mamoswine is a great teammate to help Excadrill deal with Flying-type Pokemon that it cannot deal with, such as Gliscor and Corviknight. It also deals with Choice Scarf users and faster threats that Excadrill cannot outspeed when sand is not present, such as Dragapult, Enamorus, and Meowscarada, thanks to Ice Shard. Ursaluna-B is an incredibly threatening special wallbreaker that can deal with physically defensive Pokemon that Excadrill struggles to take on, such as Dondozo and Sableye. Excadrill pairs nicely with Swords Dance Garchomp, as Excadrill takes care of the Ice- and Fairy-types that would otherwise get in the way of Garchomp's sweep. Teammates that provide Water immunities, such as Storm Drain Gastrodon and Water Absorb Clodsire, are great teammates, as they can switch into threats that Excadrill cannot OHKO, such as Primarina, Urshifu-R, Keldeo, and Barraskewda. Teammates that provide entry hazard support work well with Excadrill, such as Ting-Lu, Quagsire, and Clodsire.</p>"

      "Swords Dance (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>Excadrill's Swords Dance, paired with its great offensive capabilities in its near-unwallable STAB combination and Sand Rush, makes it an excellent sweeper for Ground-type teams. Swords Dance aids Excadrill in OHKOing prominent targets that would otherwise threaten it such as Primarina, Meowscarada, and Kyurem. Iron Head in tandem with Earthquake forms a fantastic STAB move combination that is resisted by very few Pokemon. Rapid Spin allows Excadrill to remove entry hazards that can prove troublesome to Ground-type teams, such as Spikes and Toxic Spikes, while also providing it with a boost to its Speed, which can make it a potent sweeper even outside of sand. Soft Sand is the preferred item over other damage-boosting items such as Life Orb, as it allows Excadrill to retain HP while landing OHKOs on the aforementioned Primarina, as well as Swampert after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>Hippowdon is a mandatory teammate, as it sets sand for Excadrill to take advantage of. Additionally, it acts as a great physical wall that can switch into Pokemon that threaten Excadrill, such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T, while also providing entry hazard support. In return, Excadrill can handle the aforementioned Primarina and Meowscarada for Hippowdon. Landorus is another great teammate, as it is a very potent wallbreaker that handles physical walls that Excadrill struggles against, such as opposing Hippowdon, as well as Corviknight and Skarmory if it has set Gravity, which Excadrill can also take advantage of. In return, Excadrill takes care of Pokemon that can wall Landorus, like Chansey and Articuno. Another great defensive teammate is Clodsire, which provides a Water immunity with Water Absorb, as well as great utility with its access to a wide array of entry hazards, which further aid in Excadrill's sweeping and wallbreaking capabilities. Mamoswine is another appreciated teammate, as it has access to Thick Fat, which allows Ground teams to have a relatively safe pivot into Pokemon such as Kyurem and Greninja Choice-locked into Ice-type moves, which both outspeed Excadrill outside of sand. Additionally, it threatens a myriad of Pokemon that prove troublesome to Excadrill such as Gliscor, Amoonguss, and Zapdos with its Ice-type STAB moves, as well as revenge killing Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Dragapult, making Excadrill's job of sweeping much easier. Ursaluna-B pairs well with Excadrill to form a dangerous wallbreaking combination, as they both have access to high powered STAB moves while also covering each other's checks nicely. Excadrill helps with special walls that Ursaluna-B can't break, such as the aforementioned Chansey, while Ursaluna-B can help deal with Corviknight and Skarmory after boosting with Calm Mind. Additionally, Ursaluna-B has access to Vacuum Wave, which hits a very prominent threat in Chien-Pao, which alleviates pressure from Ground-type teams.</p>"

Moonblast provides a form of offense for Whimsicott, allowing it to threaten Dragon- and Dark-type threats such as Archaludon, Roaring Moon, and Sableye. Stun Spore grants Whimiscott a vital form of speed control, slowing down foes like Sneasler, Gouging Fire, and Dragapult. Alternatively, Tailwind provides long term speed control and is useful to use before Whimsicott is KOed.

Choice Scarf Meowscarada provides an incredible form of speed control, being able to check threats such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Gholdengo that cause Whimsicott issues; it also benefits from Stun Spore, enabling it to outspeed Choice Scarf Dragapult. Amoonguss provides a solid defensive pivot for Whimsicott, as it can absorb Toxic Spikes should Whimsicott opt for Pixie Plate along with using Foul Play on a setup threat such as Swords Dance Ceruledge to remove it once hit with Encore. Amoonguss can also use Sludge Bomb to take on Fairy-types like Hatterene that can deflect Whimsicott's utility via Magic Bounce. Lilligant and Breloom appreciate Whimsicott's Encore, granting safe setup opportunities and can use their Fighting-type STAB moves to deal with Ice- and Steel-types such as Kyurem, Alolan Sandslash, and Hisuian Goodra in return. Hydrapple appreciates Whimsicott removing Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Raging Bolt and, in return, can use its Fire neutrality and Earth Power to take on Fire-types like Heatran, Hisuian Arcanine, and Iron Moth.

Leaf Blade 2HKOes Toxapex at +1 and threatens Water's two Unaware Pokemon, Dondozo and Quagsire. Close Combat hits Ice- and Steel-types trying to switch into Hisuian Lilligant's Grass STAB move, as well as having a favorable roll to OHKO both Corviknight and Hisuian Goodra at +1. Finally, Ice Spinner hits Dragon- and Flying-types such as Dragonite and Thundurus-T, as well as Unaware Clodsire on Ground. Wide Lens is used to reduce the accuracy drop from Hustle. Sleep Powder can be run to give Hisuian Lilligant more setup opportunities, but the loss of coverage in Ice Spinner or STAB in Close Combat is notable.</p> <p>Great Tusk is a great teammate for Hisuian Lilligant, as it threatens out Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and the Poison-types that can stop a Hisuian Lilligant sweep. Great Tusk can soften up Hisuian Lilligant's checks by setting Stealth Rock. In return, Hisuian Lilligant uses Water-types such as Hisuian Samurott and Quagsire, which threaten Great Tusk, as setup opportunities. Iron Valiant can break through common checks to Hisuian Lilligant such as the aforementioned Skeledirge and Gholdengo thanks to either Shadow Ball on special sets or Knock Off on mixed ones.

Ice Spinner allows Hisuian Lilligant to threaten opposing Dragon- and Flying-types like Enamorus, Galarian Zapdos, and Dragapult, as well as opposing Ground-types like Clodsire and Great Tusk if it does not run Leaf Blade. Sleep Powder is often preferred over Leaf Blade to give Hisuian Lilligant an easier chance to set up, and the combination of Ice Spinner and Close Combat still targets a good portion of the metagame. However, Leaf Blade can be used to target Pokemon that resist Ice Spinner and Close Combat such as Toxapex and Azumarill.

Amoonguss appreciates Hisuian Lilligant's ability to dispatch opposing Flying-types like Corviknight, which can render it setup fodder, and can also assist Hisuian Lilligant's setup using Spore. Iron Leaves is another offensive partner for Hisuian Lilligant that can threaten opposing Poison-types which Lilligant cannot break through like Toxapex. Iron Leaves appreciates Hisuian Lilligant being able to threaten opposing Dark-type Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Kingambit. Brambleghast offers hazard support with Spikes, allowing Hisuian Lilligant to have secure KOs on Pokemon like Alolan Muk.

It is an incredible asset in the Ghost matchup, as it allows you to play mind games against an opponent using Flutter Mane and Dragapult by disguising itself as Gholdengo and takes advantage of Substitute by forcing a lot of switches. Hex in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp deals superb damage against threats like Flutter Mane, Amoonguss, and Quagsire and negates passive recovery on walls such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Will-O-Wisp lets you play around Sucker Punch users like Kingambit and burns other physical attackers such as Scizor that pose a threat to teammates like Flutter Mane and Mimikyu. Knock Off further cripples the aforementioned walls and removes Heavy-Duty Boots from foes, enhancing Brambleghast's Spikes, while Nasty Plot allows Hisuian Zoroark to capitalize on Substitute and use passive walls such as Toxapex, Brambleghast, and Dragalge as setup fodder. Leftovers and 252 HP EVs let Hisuian Zoroark take full advantage of Substitute and potentially sustain a few neutral attacks.</p> <p>Flutter Mane appreciates Hisuian Zoroark luring in walls like Clodsire, Gastrodon, and Amoonguss and wearing them down with Hex and Will-O-Wisp. In return, it removes threatening Dark-types like Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Iron Jugulis. Dragapult checks Hydreigon, Baxcalibur, and Gholdengo and pivots into Hisuian Zoroark with U-turn. Gholdengo threatens Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Flutter Mane and supports Hisuian Zoroark's Hex with Thunder Wave. Hisuian Zoroark also likes to disguise itself as the previously mentioned Dragapult and Gholdengo due to them also using Substitute and Hex, potentially tricking opponents and forming a very formidable Hex spam core. Mimikyu aids against Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon and provides useful priority in Shadow Sneak. Additionally, Mimikyu appreciates Hisuian Zoroark withering down and burning the majority of opposing teams, letting Mimikyu clean up late-game without any complications. Brambleghast helps Hisuian Zoroark chip down opposing teams with Spikes, removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and checks Water-types such as Rotom-W, Slowking, and Barraskewda. Skeledirge walls setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Mimikyu as well as general threats like Iron Valiant, Scizor, and Magnezone.</p>"

Additionally, it can win the Ghost matchup with good prediction, which is a type that Normal teams usually struggle against. Trick lets Hisuian Zoroark ruin defensive answers, such as Toxapex and Ting-Lu, that would otherwise take its attacks with ease. Flamethrower allows Hisuian Zoroark to hit Steel-types like Corviknight and Iron Treads more reliably than Focus Blast, while Grass Knot hits Dondozo, which would otherwise take Hisuian Zoroark's attacks. Focus Blast lets Hisuian Zoroark eliminate troublesome Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Ting-Lu. Illusion lets Hisuian Zoroark bait in defensive answers to other threats, such as Corviknight and Toxapex switching into Maushold, and hinder them with Trick while also giving it a safe opportunity to switch into Fighting-type attacks.</p> <p>Maushold greatly appreciates Hisuian Zoroark's ability to remove Ghost- and Steel-types, alongside its ability to hinder and remove Rocky Helmet from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Corviknight, to enable it to clean up with Population Bomb. In return, Maushold can remove entry hazards with Tidy Up and break through answers to Hisuian Zoroark such as the aforementioned Toxapex and Ting-Lu. Choice Scarf Staraptor is another great partner, as it provides a safe switch-in to Choice Scarf Great Tusk, which tends to lock into Headlong Rush, while dealing high amounts of damage itself to enable Hisuian Zoroark to clean up the rest of an opponent's team. It also provides a form of speed control against faster threats such as Dragapult. Cyclizar also provides a safe switch-in with Shed Tail while keeping hazards off the field with Rapid Spin. In return, Hisuian Zoroark can use these switch-in opportunities to hit the aforementioned Steel-types hard. Ditto can turn setup attempts on a Choice-locked Hisuian Zoroark on their heads, while Blissey can take strong special hits such as Sandy Shocks's STAB moves. Indeedee provides Psychic Terrain support to improve Hisuian Zoroark's matchup against Kingambit, and it can also use a Choice Scarf to deal with fast threats such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Flamigo and provide Healing Wish support.</p>"

Clear Smog helps neutralize setup threats like opposing Breloom and Calm Mind Ursaluna-B. Red Card allows Amoonguss to phase out threatening sweepers like the ones mentioned above in order to deny them sweeping attempts.</p> <h4>Poison</h4> <p>Energy Ball trades the recovery of Giga Drain for a solid boost in power, allowing Amoonguss to hit much harder, notably being able to consistently OKHO Great Tusk after it uses Headlong Rush and break the Substitute of Bulk Up Landorus. Stomping Tantrum can be used over Foul Play, providing a strong physical coverage option that can stomp Poison-types like Alolan Muk, Clodsire, and Glimmora. Stomping Tantrum also pairs well with Amoonguss's status spreading options, as attempting to spread status on a foe twice will boost its power, notably hitting bulkier threats like Toxapex and Gholdengo hard. However, Stomping Tantrum renders Amoonguss unable to hit Flying-types and Bug-types for unresisted damage. Stun Spore provides a speed control option for Poison teams, slowing threats like Iron Valiant, Iron Boulder, and Iron Treads down and allowing offensive threats like Sneasler and Iron Moth to outspeed and remove them without having to risk them waking up; however, Stun Spore does not provide the same free turns as Spore. Rocky Helmet provides chip damage against contact attacks from the likes of Iron Hands, Meowscarada, and Great Tusk; however, using it gives up the reliable entry Heavy-Duty Boots provides, which Amoonguss enjoys having for the Ground matchup.</p>",

Foul Play gives Amoonguss a tool that not only hits Grass-resistant foes like Dragapult, Dragonite and Ogerpon-W but is also a form of offense that turns their Attack stats against them. Spore allows Amoonguss to pressure threats like Dragonite, Iron Treads, and Scizor by forcing them out of commission, along with creating opportunities to safely position its fellow teammates with free entry.</p> <p>Alolan Muk complements Amoonguss by being a specially defensive tank capable of handling Ghost- and Psychic-type attacks thrown at Amoonguss from the likes of Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Hatterene and threatening those foes back with Knock Off. Galarian Slowking helps deal with other specially offensive threats such as Latios, Enamorus, and Iron Moth with its wide array of tools like Ice Beam and Future Sight. Toxapex complements Amoonguss by being another physically defensive Regenerator wall able to handle Ice- and Fire-type attacks from the likes of Chien-Pao, Cinderace, and Talonflame. Galarian Weezing provides a full-on Ground immunity, helping out against Ground-types Amoonguss cannot deal with on its own like Clodsire, Mamoswine, and Garchomp. Galarian Weezing also provides Will-O-Wisp support, weakening threats considerably and allowing Amoonguss to take hits from the likes of Mamoswine, and Defog support should Amoonguss lose its Heavy-Duty Boots. Pecharunt is a physical wall, being able to stave off attacks from the likes of the Ogerpon formes, Gouging Fire, and Gliscor, along with appreciating Amoonguss's Spore, which can be used to power up Pecharunt's Hex. Amoonguss appreciates Glimmora nailing threats like Torkoal, Talonflame, and Articuno with Power Gem. Salazzle provides Fire-type assistance, melting Ice-types like Froslass and Alolan Sandslash with ease. Both provide Corrosion Toxic support, wearing down bulky threats like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and opposing Amoonguss that can easily switch in and wall Amoonguss. Salazzle and Glimmora also appreciate Amoonguss taking Water- and Ground-type attacks for them. Iron Moth melts through Ice-types giving Amoonguss trouble like Articuno, Alolan Ninetales, and Alolan Sandslash, along with just cleaning Gliscor and Landorus with Choice Specs Overheat, and it similarly appreciates Amoonguss's absorption of Water- and Ground-type attacks. Okidogi and Sneasler enjoy punching holes in monsters like Heatran, Kingambit, and Hisuian Goodra and appreciate Amoonguss giving them free turns with Spore, allowing them to set up safely.</p>"

Foul Play is a great option in order to hit threats like Swords Dance Scizor and Dragon Dance Dragapult, which may try to take advantage of Amoonguss's passive playstyle. Sludge Bomb hits the aforementioned Fairy-types, as well as threatening Grass-types like Hisuian Lilligant and Hydrapple. Spore lets Amoonguss facilitate dangerous setup sweeper teammates, like Nasty Plot Hydrapple, Victory Dance Hisuian Lilligant, and Swords Dance Ogerpon-H. The given EV spread lets Amoonguss survive one Ice Beam from Choice Specs Greninja from full health and retaliate by putting it to sleep.</p> <p>Spore benefits all of Amoonguss's teammates in terms of giving them free turns to attack or set up. Hydrapple is a great teammate for Amoonguss thanks to its natural defensive synergy—it can take on Fire-type attacks from the likes of Gouging Fire and retaliate with Fickle Beam, while Amoonguss can take problematic Fairy-type attacks from the likes of Iron Valiant and Enamorus for Hydrapple. They also form a Regenerator core, allowing them to keep each other healthy by switching into threats that the other cannot deal with. Swords Dance Ogerpon-H crushes troublesome Ice- and Steel-types like Articuno, Mamoswine, and Gholdengo that can take advantage of Amoonguss. Hisuian Lilligant is another threatening setup sweeper that hits Ice- and Steel-types like Kyurem, Heatran, and Archaludon incredibly hard, as well as hitting Gliscor, which Amoonguss struggles to make progress against, with Ice Spinner. Breloom is another Fighting-type that can use Swords Dance to break holes in the opposing team, with Mach Punch to hit Dark-types like Greninja and Kingambit. In exchange, Amoonguss removes Enamorus for both Breloom and Hisuian Lilligant while freeing both up to run more useful coverage moves, like Rock Tomb for Breloom and Ice Spinner for Hisuian Lilligant, over their respective sleep-inducing moves. Meowscarada can remove items, mainly Leftovers, in order to let Amoonguss more effectively outlast other bulky cores. It also punishes Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon that try to take advantage of Amoonguss, like Hoopa-U, Deoxys-S, and Dragapult, with Knock Off and U-turn. Sinistcha is a great answer to Iron Defense + Body Press Zamazenta, which can use Amoonguss as a setup opportunity. It also does very well against passive Pokemon that can engage Amoonguss in a stalemate, like Toxapex or Clodsire. Brambleghast removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin while setting its own with Spikes. It also hits troubling Psychic- and Ghost-types like Galarian Slowking and Flutter Mane with Poltergeist and Shadow Sneak. Wind Rider also allows it to be an effective stop to Zapdos's and Tornadus-T's Hurricane, letting it potentially take these two out. Ogerpon-C is another dangerous Swords Dance sweeper that effectively threatens Flying- and Fire-types like Articuno, Volcarona, Dragonite, and Gouging Fire at +2.</p>"

Protect allows Alomomola to stall out a turn and recover its own HP using Wish. Alternatively, Alomomola can utilize its low Special Defense stat to bait strong special attackers, such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Latios, into hitting it with a special attack, then turn the tables via Mirror Coat.</p> <p>Alomomola is almost exclusively seen on stall teams due to its passivity. Teammates without reliable recovery, such as Dondozo and Swampert, are excellent partners for it. Dondozo can switch into dangerous setup sweepers, such as Chien-Pao and Kingambit, that Alomomola struggles in the face of. Meanwhile, Swampert is immune to Electric-type attacks, which threaten Alomomola, and can utilize Flip Turn to help get Alomomola in for safe Wishes. Special walls such as Empoleon, Swampert, and Toxapex are able to cover Alomomola's low Special Defense stat by switching into Pokemon like Dragapult and Gholdengo.

Pokemon that can provide hazard support such as Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Hisuian Samurott are great teammates for Alomomola, as they form a hazard-stacking core and are capable of wearing down foes across the course of long games. Greninja and Urshifu-R can beat Pokemon such as Ogerpon-H and Landorus, both of which massively threaten slower-paced Water teams.

Choice Scarf Kleavor is a great teammate for Galvantula because it can deal with Fire-types such as Ogerpon-H and Moltres. Kleavor's Stone Axe also pairs nicely with Galvantula's Sticky Web, as more entry hazards further help the sweepers and wallbreakers on the team, while also breaking Ceruledge's Focus Sash, which is a huge problem for Bug teams.

Calm Mind Terapagos, with its colorful moveset, can be a good teammate to pressure defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Quagsire for Braviary.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Dark</h4> <p>Iron Defense is an option that allows Mandibuzz to go toe-to-toe and always win against Dragon Dance Gouging Fire, Swords Dance Ogerpon-H lacking Encore, and Swords Dance Kingambit while being able to dissuade Iron Defense users like Skarmory and Zamazenta from continuing their attempts to harass Dark teams. However, this comes at a steep cost of not being able to run Defog, which is the main reason why Mandibuzz is used, and a common teammate in Sableye is able to wall Iron Defense users in its stead. Brave Bird can be considered over Foul Play to heavily damage Volcarona and Iron Valiant switching in, but the targets are so few that Foul Play or Toxic will always be more beneficial.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Physically Defensive (Dark)": {
        "description": "<p>Mandibuzz is a decent supportive piece for Dark teams with its ability to pivot into physical attackers like Gouging Fire and Excadrill due to its natural Ground immunity, access to Defog, which empowers Dark teams' most powerful breaker in Choice Band Chien-Pao, and U-turn to position the aforementioned breaker and its other teammates into favorable matchups. Foul Play punishes strong physical attackers like Ogerpon-W, Dragonite, and Scizor. U-turn lets Mandibuzz act as a pivot to escape common switch-ins like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Gholdengo to maintain the offensive momentum of its team. Defog lets Mandibuzz prevent its teammates from getting worn down over the course of the match, and if paired with Toxic, lets Mandibuzz pressure entry hazard setters like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Aside from these, Toxic greatly cuts the longevity of threats like Ursaluna-B and Volcarona, which otherwise switch in and set up on Mandibuzz. Overcoat lets Mandibuzz ignore Sandstorm damage, which is vital for checking Excadrill on sand-based Ground teams. 16 Speed EVs let Mandibuzz outspeed and use Foul Play against Adamant Azumarill, checking it after it has used Belly Drum. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Mandibuzz get in freely to remove Stealth Rock without much issue, but Rocky Helmet racks up chip damage against threats like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, Excadrill, and Gouging Fire and also punishes U-turn users like Sneasler and Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Mandibuzz's ability to remove entry hazards and pivot its teammates greatly benefits wallbreakers like Choice Band Chien-Pao and Choice Specs Hoopa-U, which typically cannot afford to use Choice items due to their vulnerability to entry hazards and the lack of removal on Dark teams. Choice Band Chien-Pao, for instance, tears up Pokemon that check Mandibuzz, like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Gholdengo and guarantees a 2HKO at worst on virtually any enemy Pokemon. On the other hand, Hoopa-U deals with Ursaluna-B, Toxapex, and Archaludon, and sports a great natural Special Defense to trade with Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Enamorus in the worst-case scenario. Hoopa-U can also use a Choice Scarf to surprise threats like Flutter Mane and Keldeo, which take advantage of Mandibuzz. Special walls like Alolan Muk and Ting-Lu complement Mandibuzz to complete a defensive core for Dark teams, with Alolan Muk checking Fairy-types like Hatterene, Flutter Mane, and Enamorus, while Ting-Lu provides entry hazards, is bulky enough to deal with Raging Bolt and Gholdengo, and provides an Electric immunity to help against Regieleki. Kingambit provides a Fairy-type neutrality, which lets it check Flutter Mane in a pinch, and appreciates Mandibuzz's ability to remove entry hazards, as it lets Kingambit use a different item like Chople Berry or Black Glasses to be more effective offensively. Choice Scarf Meowscarada forms a decent pivoting core with Mandibuzz and can clean up against types like Ground, Flying, and Dragon late-game. While Mandibuzz slightly overlaps with Sableye due to their role as a physical wall, Sableye is still greatly appreciated thanks to its ability to check IronPress users like Skarmory and Zamazenta, burn Urshifu-R and Barraskewda to let Mandibuzz check these threats safely, and use Encore on setup sweepers like Keldeo, Primarina, and Volcarona, which take advantage of Mandibuzz.</p>"
      },
      "Defog (Flying)": {
        "description": "<p>Mandibuzz finds a niche on Flying teams thanks to its unique secondary Dark typing and stellar defensive stats, allowing it to run either a specially or physically defensive set to give it a solid role. Foul Play makes use of the high Attack stat of threats like Swords Dance Excadrill, Metagross, and Scizor for its offense. U-turn can be used to threaten Dark-types like Meowscarada and Hoopa-U while also allowing Mandibuzz to pivot into a teammate. Toxic provides solid utility in putting threats like Gouging Fire, Landorus, and Latios on a timer. Defog supports its fellow Flying-types by removing Stealth Rock along with helping Mandibuzz itself, should Heavy-Duty Boots be knocked off. Both EV spreads have good utility, with the specially defensive spread being better at handling threats such as Choice Specs Dragapult and Spectrier, while the physically defensive spread can more reliably check foes like Ceruledge and Gallade. Both spreads check mixed threats like Hoopa-U. The 16 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Azumarill and check it with Foul Play.</p> <p>Gliscor and Landorus help immensely by being able to threaten Poison-types like Toxapex and Alolan Muk coming in on Mandibuzz's Toxic, and they can also threaten Electric-types attemping to remove Mandibuzz such as Raging Bolt. Gliscor also appreciates Mandibuzz running Toxic, allowing it to run a different support move such as Taunt. Both Skarmory and Corviknight can threaten Ice- and Rock-types like Chien-Pao, Mamoswine, and Iron Boulder. Skarmory with Body Press can also check Dark-types like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit thanks to its high Defense. Corviknight with Iron Head can check Fairy-type threats like Flutter Mane, Alolan Ninetales, and Hatterene along with being able to run Defog, allowing Mandibuzz to run Toxic in its moveset. Articuno can threaten problematic Water-types like Primarina, Pelipper, and Rotom-W while enjoying Mandibuzz's ability to threaten physical attackers like Barraskewda and Scizor, should Mandibuzz be physically bulky. Choice Scarf Enamorus appreciates Mandibuzz's ability to remove hazards and threaten Toxic onto walls, including Articuno, that could otherwise shrug off its attacks, enabling Enamorus's sweeping capability. In response, Enamorus can support Mandibuzz by removing Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Kingambit that can easily set up in front of Mandibuzz.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Paired with Choice Specs, Hydreigon becomes a threatening wallbreaker capable of dismantling common bulky Pokemon such as Corviknight, Clodsire, and Heatran. Coverage moves in Earth Power and Flamethrower work together to hit walls that aren't bothered much by Dark Pulse and Draco Meteor. Earth Power hits specially defensive Pokemon such as the aforementioned Clodsire and Heatran, as well as Kingambit. Flamethrower makes up for the scenarios in which Earth Power cannot be used such as against specially defensive Corviknight and Air Balloon Kingambit. U-turn can be used over Dark Pulse as a way to retain momentum if Dark Pulse is not needed.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Greninja helps form a strong offensive core with Hydreigon, as it can help in the Flying, Fighting, and Fairy matchups with its colorful coverage. With access to Ice Beam, Extrasensory, and Sludge Wave, Greninja can aid in taking down Pokemon that prove troublesome to Hydreigon such as Landorus, Zamazenta, the Ogerpon formes, and Primarina. Futhermore, it can provide utility in Toxic Spikes or form a pivot core with Hydreigon if they both opt to run U-turn instead. Sableye is a necessary teammate on Dark teams, as it provides an invaluable Fighting immunity and can help make progress against bulkier Pokemon such as Corviknight and Tornadus with Knock Off, in tandem with Will-O-Wisp. Furthermore, it can stop setup sweepers in their tracks with Encore, such as Gouging Fire and Dragapult. Ting-Lu alleviates pressure off Hydreigon, as it can sponge a plethora of special attacks such as Ice Beam from Greninja and Focus Blast from Tornadus-T. It also has access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, making Hydreigon's job of wallbreaking much easier because it can 2HKO physically defensive Toxapex after either of the entry hazards are set. Kingambit appreciates Hydreigon weakening teams, giving it little trouble winning late-game with Supreme Overlord-boosted Sucker Punch while also being capable of handling Fairy- and Ice-types with Iron Head. Choice Scarf Meowscarada can provide more pivoting support with U-turn as well as threaten opposing Dark- and Fairy-types such as Greninja, Hydreigon, and Flutter Mane. Lastly, Alolan Muk is strong for Dark teams, as it is able to take on virtually any special attacking Fairy-type with its naturally high Special Defense stat and threaten them out with Poison Jab while also providing utility in Knock Off and Poison Touch.</p>"

Dark Pulse targets Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo, Gengar, and Armarouge. Flamethrower threatens Steel-types like Iron Treads, Corviknight, and Kingambit, while Earth Power aids in the Poison matchup, hitting Clodsire, Skuntank, and Toxapex. Alternatively, Flash Cannon may be used to threaten Fairy-types like Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Gardevoir behind Substitute. Substitute alongside Leftovers makes Hydreigon difficult to revenge kill and offers more setup opportunities against passive Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Klefki, and Forretress. Alternatively, Taunt prevents Ting-Lu from phazing Hydreigon with Whirlwind as well as obstructing Clodsire, Dondozo, and Gastrodon's recovery attempts. Draco Meteor is a niche option to OHKO opposing Dragon-types like Baxcalibur and Dragalge; however, Draco Meteor negates Nasty Plot boosts and requires Hydreigon to give up useful utility.</p> <p>Hydreigon's ability to break past physical walls such as Quagsire, Skeledirge, and Dondozo is heavily appreciated by Baxcalibur and Dragonite. In return, Baxcalibur checks Clodsire, Dragonite, and opposing Hydreigon, while Dragonite threatens Quaquaval and Cinderace. Cyclizar sets up Shed Tail for non-Substitute Hydreigon, allowing for more setup opportunities and freeing up a moveslot for Hydreigon. Furthermore, Cyclizar removes Stealth Rock off the field with Rapid Spin, preserving Hydreigon's ability to set up. Dragapult combats Flutter Mane, Gallade, and opposing Dragon-types, while Hydreigon forces Kingambit off the field and switches into Shadow Sneak from Brambleghast and Ceruledge. Garchomp sets up entry hazards to enhance Hydreigon's wallbreaking capabilities and helps to take care of Clodsire and Volcarona. Dragalge is valued as a check to Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant as well as an entry hazard setter, aiding in the Dark and Fairy matchups with Toxic Spikes.</p>"

Draco Meteor provides nuclear power after a Nasty Plot, removing threats like Urshifu-R, Baxcalibur, and Great Tusk, while Dark Pulse is a great alternative due to its accuracy, good Base Power, and synergy with Flamethrower or Earth Power. Flamethrower hits Steel-types like Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads; however, Earth Power hits Hisuian Goodra, Toxapex, and Alolan Muk. Stealth Rock is appreciated to allow Ting-Lu to use Spikes while also capitalizing on the many switches Hydreigon forces. Alternatively, Substitute raises Hydreigon's potency as a wallbreaker, providing safety in front of passive Pokemon like Amoonguss, defensive Rotom-W, and Gastrodon as well as putting lots of pressure on more offensive types like Ground and opposing Dark teams.</p> <p>Chien-Pao and Hydreigon form a formidable wallbreaking core due to Chien-Pao's ability to threaten Unaware Clodsire, Enamorus, and Roaring Moon. In return, Hydreigon uses Toxapex and Quagsire as setup fodder. Sableye provides a Fighting-type immunity and Will-O-Wisp support, discouraging Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Sneasler, and Quaquaval from using their STAB moves. Meowscarada and Greninja are great in the Grass and Water matchups, eliminating Quaquaval, Ice Beam Gastrodon, and Azumarill. Additionally, Meowscarada threatens Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, while Greninja breaks past Unaware Clodsire. Kingambit checks Fairy-types like Hatterene and Flutter Mane while also picking off faster threats like Dragapult, Spectrier, and Barraskewda after a few Supreme Overlord boosts. In return, Kingambit values Hydreigon's ability to remove roadblocks like Great Tusk and Urshifu-R. Ting-Lu provides entry hazards and phazing with Whirlwind to wear down defensive checks, while Alolan Muk is an additional asset in the Fairy and Dragon matchup, taking on Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Walking Wake. Choice Scarf Hoopa-U threatens Chien-Pao, Clodsire, and hinders Hydreigon's checks with Trick while appreciating Alolan Muk's removal in return.</p>"

After a Quiver Dance boost, Flamethrower targets Steel- and Ice-types like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Alolan Ninetales. At +1, Psychic threatens both Poison- and Fighting-types like Pecharunt, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta. Morning Sun provides a great form of longevity, as it gives Volcarona additional opportunities to set up and sweep. Alternatively, Giga Drain can be used to threaten Water- and Rock-types such as Swampert, Primarina, and Rhyperior.</p> <p>Volcarona appreciates entry hazard support from both Kleavor and Forretress that aid it in its sweep. Additionally, Choice Scarf Kleavor handles Flying- and Fire-types such as Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine, and Gouging Fire, while Forretress can remove hazards with Rapid Spin if Volcarona's item is removed and can bring it in safely with Volt Switch. Araquanid and Galvantula can stack further hazards stack by placing Sticky Web to allow Volcarona to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Iron Valiant and Sneasler after one Quiver Dance boost. Additionally, Araquanid's great ability in Water Bubble eases the Fire matchup, while Galvantula threatens common Water- and Flying-types like Toxapex, Gyarados, and Talonflame. In return, Araquanid appreciates Volcarona dealing with problematic Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Meowscarada, and Amoonguss. Scizor pairs well with Volcarona, as it can switch into a predicted Toxic and deal with troublesome Rock-types like Ogerpon-C, Iron Boulder, and Kleavor. In return, Scizor appreciates Volcarona's ability to switch into a predicted Will-O-Wisp as well as deal with Zamazenta. Slither Wing and Lokix make for great revenge killers, as their powerful First Impression allows them to deal with Dark- and Psychic-types like Greninja, Choice Scarf Hoopa-U, and Iron Boulder. Additionally, Slither Wing takes on special walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Blissey, and Heatran, while Lokix's access to Sucker Punch allows it to deal with a myriad of sweepers and cleaners such as Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Gouging Fire.

Psychic provides solid coverage, hitting troublesome Poison- and Fighting-types like Toxapex, Glimmora, Okidogi, and Iron Hands along with allowing Volcarona to hit Fire- and Water-types that resist Flamethrower. Morning Sun provides Volcarona a form of healing, making its setup far easier against targets that cannot threaten it out like Galarian Slowking and Iron Hands. The EV spread maximizes Volcarona's bulk while still allowing it to outspeed Zamazenta after a Quiver Dance and land an OHKO on Keldeo with Psychic.</p> <p>Volcarona greatly appreciates Scizor removing problematic Rock-types like Kleavor, Ogerpon-C, and Iron Boulder, which all threaten Volcarona immensely. Kleavor helps Volcarona by providing Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, along with removing Fire-types like opposing Volcarona, Ogerpon-H, and Ninetales. Scizor and Kleavor, in return, benefit from Volcarona removing the physically bulky threats that wall them such as Toxapex and Skarmory. Slither Wing aids Volcarona in removing bulky special walls like Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, and Alolan Muk thanks to its Fighting-type STAB move. Forretress provides a form of entry hazard removal, being able to remove Stealth Rock should Volcarona lose its Heavy-Duty Boots, and it can also set up Spikes to chip switch-ins like Heatran, Tyranitar, and Galarian Slowking. Forretress also provides Volcarona a safe entry thanks to Volt Switch. Galvantula threatens Water-types that can take on Volcarona, including Hisuian Samurott, Pelipper, and Primarina. Ribombee can threaten Dragon-types like Garchomp and Walking Wake that could handle Volcarona. Araquanid can threaten Fire-types that would otherwise wall Volcarona's Fire-type attacks like Heatran, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge. Galvantula, Ribombee, and Araquanid also provide support by laying Sticky Web, allowing Volcarona to outspeed otherwise faster threats such as Choice Scarf Glimmora and Sand Rush Excadril after a single Quiver Dance. Lokix can remove dangerous Choice Scarf threats like Iron Boulder and Roaring Moon thanks to its powerful priority, preventing them from revenge killing Volcarona.</p>"

Giga Drain can be used over Flamethrower, as it grants Volcarona a recovery option and allows it to threaten Water- and Ground-types such as Primarina, Swampert, and Gastrodon. Alternatively, Morning Sun provides larger recovery for Volcarona than Giga Drain, giving it more opportunities to set up. Flame Body allows Volcarona to potentially punish revenge killers such as Dragonite with burns.</p> <p>Torkoal and Ninetales are great partners for Volcarona, as their sun boosts Volcarona's Flamethrower. Additionally, Torkoal can set up Stealth Rock to aid Volcarona in its sweeping, while Ninetales provides Will-O-Wisp support so that Volcarona can run Swarm and punish physical attackers and Healing Wish support to grant Volcarona another opportunity at sweeping. Cinderace can clear entry hazards with Court Change and potentially gain screens set by users like Klefki and Alolan Ninetales to make Volcarona harder to take down. Choice Scarf variants can also deal with speedy threats such as Greninja, Kleavor, and Iron Valiant thanks to its colorful movepool combined with Libero boosts. Talonflame's immunity to Ground allows it to ease that matchup, and Brave Bird in tandem with Gale Wings allows it to deal with threats such as the Ogerpon formes and Choice Scarf Sneasler. Volcanion is great in the Water matchup thanks to its decent physical bulk and access to Water Absorb, and with its great attacking options, it can handle Fire-, Fairy-, and Poison-types such as opposing Volcarona, Azumarill, and Toxapex. Volcarona appreciates the presence of wallbreakers such as Ogerpon-H, Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine, and Choice Specs Iron Moth to break through bulky threats so it can sweep more easily. Ogerpon-H deals with Water-types such as Primarina, Swampert, and Rotom-W when Volcarona chooses to forego Giga Drain. Hisuian Arcanine deals with Flying-types such as Moltres, Tornadus-T, and Mandibuzz, and it appreciates Volcarona taking on Fighting-types such as Iron Valiant and Breloom in return.

Psychic offers valuable coverage, hitting Water- and Dragon-types that resist Fiery Dance like Toxapex, Pelipper, Garchomp, and Dragapult, on top of dealing with Fighting-type foes such as IronPress Zamazenta and Iron Hands. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp provides a consistent way of spreading burns to attackers such as Excadrill, Dragonite, and Gallade, further enhancing Volcarona's defensive capabilities. Morning Sun improves Volcarona's durability, helping it set up on Fighting- and Dragon-types such as IronPress Zamazenta, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Dragapult. The EV spread allows Volcarona to outspeed IronPress Zamazenta after a Quiver Dance.</p> <p>More so than its offensive counterpart, sun lets defensive Volcarona shine by increasing Morning Sun's healing rate, reducing the damage received from Water-type moves, and boosting Fiery Dance, allowing Volcarona to set up on Water-type foes such as Choice Specs Greninja and Keldeo. Therefore, it is highly recommended to pair Volcarona with a Drought user. Ninetales comes with utility options in the form of Healing Wish and Encore, helping Volcarona stay healthy and come safely on the field, and it can also use Solar Beam to punish Gastrodon and Swampert. Torkoal offers utility in a different way by setting Stealth Rock, removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and putting foes to sleep with Yawn. Cinderace provides support with Court Change and can get rid of foes weak to Dark-type moves such as Latios and Dragapult with Sucker Punch. With its defensive role, Volcarona has many synergies with the powerful wallbreakers of the type. Ogerpon-H deals with Flash Fire Heatran as well as Water- and Ground-types foes such as Primarina, Swampert, and Clodsire while appreciating Volcarona's ability to check IronPress Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Gouging Fire helps out in Dragon and Flying matchups by deleting Dragon Dance Dragonite, Gliscor, Tornadus-Therian, and opposing Gouging Fire. Lastly, Air Balloon Heatran is a great partner for Volcarona, nullifying Poison-type moves, absorbing Dragon-type moves, and dealing with both Flutter Mane and Gouging Fire.</p>"

Earthquake complements Terrakion's Rock-type STAB attacks and targets bulky threats like Toxapex, Clodsire, and non-Air Balloon Gholdengo. Upper Hand allows Terrakion to handle priority moves that it is weak to from Pokemon like Scizor and Breloom while dealing considerable damage to them. Sacred Sword is also an option as a secondary Fighting-type STAB move that doesn't have the drawback of dropping Terrakion's defenses and can ignore Defense boosts from Pokemon like Archaludon. Rock Slide also can be used as a secondary Rock-type STAB option due to its higher accuracy than Stone Edge and chance of flinching.</p> <p>Hisuian Arcanine is a good teammate for Terrakion, as both Pokemon work well offensively in dismantling Steel-type teams' defensive cores. Terrakion's Close Combat can OHKO Heatran and Archaludon, and Arcanine's Flare Blitz OHKOes Gholdengo and does significant damage to Corviknight and Skarmory. Tyranitar offers a Special Defense boost to Terrakion via its ability Sand Stream, allowing it to tank special attacks it is weak to like Enamorus and non-Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast, letting Terrakion OHKO them in return. In conjunction with entry hazard support in Stealth Rock, Tyranitar's sand is able to chip down opposing walls like Pecharunt, which is 2HKOed by Earthquake after Stealth Rock and sand damage. Terrakion also appreciates Tyranitar's Psychic immunity, which allows it to check threats to Terrakion such as Espathra, Indeedee, and Deoxys-S. Ogerpon-C is an essential teammate, threatening opposing Water- and Ground-types like Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Great Tusk thanks to its Grass typing. Glimmora offers Spikes support, which enables Terrakion to break defensive walls like the aforementioned Hippowdon and Great Tusk more easily. Its Poison typing also assists in getting rid of Toxic Spikes, improving Terrakion's longevity, and its Mortal Spin helps Terrakion stay healthy throughout the game, allowing it to switch in without the worry of taking damage from Spikes. Terrakion appreciates Iron Boulder's Speed tier, which threatens Pokemon like Meowscarada, Ogerpon-H, and Choice Scarf Enamorus that Terrakion is slower than and OHKOed by. Iron Boulder also threatens opposing Fighting-types like Sneasler and Keldeo thanks to its Psychic typing. Choice Scarf Kleavor is able to set up Stealth Rock without fear of Magic Bounce using Stone Axe, which helps helps Terrakion deal more damage, and it is able to outspeed threats to Terrakion like Flutter Mane. Kleavor's U-turn can also bring in Terrakion safely.

Alternatively, Earthquake can be used over Upper Hand, allowing Terrakion to more easily threaten Gholdengo, Toxapex, and Clodsire super effectively. Life Orb allows Terrakion to clock important OHKOs, such as on Corviknight and Galarian Weezing with Close Combat and Stone Edge, respectively, after Stealth Rock chip damage and a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>Hisuian Arcanine forms a potent wallbreaking core with Terrakion against Steel teams. Hisuian Arcanine can also threaten physically defensive Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Sinistcha for Terrakion; In return, Terrakion can weaken some of its checks like Archaludon, Swampert, and Gliscor. Ogerpon-C can threaten Ground- and Water-type Pokemon for Terrakion, such as Hippowdon, Great Tusk, and Primarina, as well as being able to beat common shared checks with Terrakion, such as Toxapex and Landorus-T. Iron Boulder can deal with Poison- and Fighting-types for Terrakion; such as Pecharunt, Okidogi, and Keldeo. Iron Boulder can also use a Choice Scarf to revenge kill faster Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed Terrakion such as Iron Valiant, Meowscarada, and Sneasler. Tyranitar can set hazards up as well as check Psychic-type Pokemon such as Latios and Latias for Terrakion. In return, Terrakion can deal with common Steel-types such as Archaludon and Iron Treads for it. Glimmora can scare out Fairy- and Grass-types such as Hatterene, Clefable, and Hydrapple while also providing Toxic Spikes, which can chip down targets such as Iron Hands and Garchomp, as well as hazard remova, which helps Terrakion not get worn down by hazards. Garganacl can switch into most walls such as Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Toxapex and force progress against them with Salt Cure. Purifying Salt lets it absorb status effects that may be aimed at Terrakion, such as Toxic from Clodsire and Will-O-Wisp from Sableye and Dragapult. Shell Smash users such as Drednaw and Minior appreciate Terrakion's ability to punch holes into the opposing team so that they can sweep more effectively.</p>"

Sludge Wave provides an attack that doesn't have to worry about accuracy, making it good for picking off weakened targets like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Alolan Ninetales. However, it comes with the drawback of making Tornadus-T unable to hit Steel-types for good neutral damage. Focus Blast's high power is great at KOing monsters like Archaludon and Kingambit, buts its low accuracy makes it very risky.</p>",

Nasty Plot-boosted Bleakwind Storm OHKOes the likes of Iron Defense Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Ogerpon-H. Focus Blast threatens the likes of Archaludon, Heatran, and Hisuian Goodra, OHKOing the former and 2HKOing the latter two after a boost. Knock Off removes essential items such as Black Sludge from Toxapex and Clodsire, as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Gouging Fire and Volcanion. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to act as a great pivot while OHKOing Hoopa-U. However, Focus Blast is usually the preferred move due to its coverage and being boosted by Nasty Plot. Heat Wave covers threats that the other moves can't cover, such as Gholdengo and Articuno.</p> <p>Tornadus-T appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Skarmory and Gliscor to wear down Clodsire and Ting-Lu. In addition, Gliscor spreads status with Toxic and, with its part Ground typing, acts as a great switch-in against Electric-types such as Magnezone and Sandy Shocks, while Skarmory handles physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao with Iron Defense and Body Press. Tornadus-T handles problematic threats for them such as Keldeo for Gliscor and Ogerpon-H for Skarmory. Corviknight removes hazards for Tornadus-T with Defog in case its Heavy-Duty Boots is removed, and it is able to pivot Tornadus-T into the likes of Zamazenta and Archaludon safely with U-turn. Tornadus-T can handle Fire-types that threaten Corviknight like Heatran and Ogerpon-H in return. Articuno is another great defensive partner, easily brushing off hits from the likes of Choice Scarf Enamorus and Hydreigon thanks to its high special bulk. Articuno also handles Water-types like Keldeo with Freeze Dry, as well as pivot Tornadus-T in with U-turn. Choice Scarf users such as Enamorus and Landorus-T provide great speed control for the team, handling speedy threats that can force Tornadus-T out. In particular, Enamorus handles fast Dragon- and Dark-types such as Dragapult and Choice Specs Greninja, while Landorus-T threatens not only fellow Choice Scarf users like Excadrill, Hisuian Arcanine, and Heatran, but also Gouging Fire, Alolan Muk, and Regieleki. Early-game wallbreakers like Landorus and Choice Band Dragonite can punch holes in the opposing team, removing problematic walls like Toxapex and Clodsire to ease Tornadus-T's late-game cleaning. Dragonite also picks off faster threats with Extreme Speed. Gyarados forms a great cleanup core with Tornadus-T, with Gyarados being able to sweep Fire and Steel teams, while Tornadus-T handles Grass, Fighting, and Dark teams.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Tornadus-T serves a key role on Flying teams as a great defensive piece thanks its solid bulk, especially when paired with Regenerator. Hurricane is Tornadus-T's main STAB move of choice, since its solid damage output is able to remove threats like Iron Valiant, Urshifu-R, and Ogerpon formes with ease. Heat Wave allows Tornadus-T to handle Steel-types that would otherwise wall it like Gholdengo and Corviknight while also dealing solid damage to Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales. Knock Off allows Tornadus-T to remove items on incoming special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Blissey along with special attackers like Latios and Dragapult. Finally, U-turn allows for Tornadus-T to deal chip damage as it pivots out along with being able to escape from trapping moves from the likes of Toxapex, Heatran, and Pecharunt. Tornadus-T's Special Attack investment is required to KO Ogerpon-W and Ogerpon-H consistently, and the rest of its EV investment goes into HP and Speed to give it as much bulk as possible and outspeed Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Tornadus-T majorly appreciates Corviknight being able to remove Stealth Rock, which allows it to get the most out of Regenerator. Corviknight also helps Tornadus-T by taking out threats like Greninja and Flutter Mane, while Corviknight appreciates the removal of its foes' held items like Rocky Helmet. Skarmory also appreciates Tornadus-T removing Rocky Helmets, allowing Body Press to do as much damage as possible against Ice- and Rock-types that threaten Tornadus-T like Chien-Pao and Iron Boulder. Skarmory can also set entry hazards to help with Tornadus-T's offense. Gliscor's Ground typing and Poison Heal ability allow it to soak up both Electric-type attacks and status moves from the likes of Regieleki, Sandy Shocks, and Clodsire and easily remove them with Earthquake, making Tornadus-T's pivoting much safer. Dragonite appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to soften up teams by removing key threats like Ogerpon-H while staying healthy, which can allow for Dragonite to have an easier time sweeping with Dragon Dance late-game to remove dangerous targets like Raging Bolt. Choice Scarf Enamorus supports Tornadus-T by being able to check faster threats like Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Greninja with ease.</p>"

Thunderbolt is able to threaten Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex, Pelipper, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Volt Switch helps it pivot out on threats attempting to handle it, such as Hisuian Goodra and Blissey. Grass Knot allows Thundurus-T to hit Ground-types like Swampert, Great Tusk, and Ursaluna that would otherwise wall it. Finally, Focus Blast remove Steel- and Rock-types like Iron Treads, Archaludon, and Tyranitar.</p> <p>Skarmory and Gliscor provide excellent support to Thundurus-T, being able to deal with Rock-types such as Iron Boulder, Kleavor, and Terrakion reliably, as well as setting entry hazards to chip down threats like Hisuian Goodra and Archaludon. Skarmory can also support Thundurus-T by dealing with Ice-types like Weavile and Mamoswine with Body Press. Corviknight can similarly check Ice- and Rock-types with Iron Head and Body Press, use Defog to remove Stealth Rock if Thundurus-T loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, and give Thundurus-T safe entry with U-turn. Articuno provides a comfortable answer to Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus, which can handle Thundurus-T's Grass Knot. Furthermore, Articuno can come in on special threats such as Kyurem and Greninja that Thundurus-T cannot handle. Dragonite acts a physical wallbreaker, handling specially defensive walls like Blissey, Hisuian Goodra, and Clodsire, while appreciating Thundurus-T's ability to eliminate physically defensive walls such as Galarian Weezing and Sableye. Choice Scarf Enamorus can threaten Dragon-type foes attemping to handle Thundurus-T, such as Dragapult, Kyurem, and Choice Band Roaring Moon. Landorus forms a special wallbreaking core, removing Fire-types like Gouging Fire, Hisuian Arcanine, and Heatran with ease.

Landorus's preferred ability, Sheer Force, in conjunction with Life Orb raises its offensive potency to great heights, allowing it to 2HKO nearly every wall in the metagame, including Ting-Lu, Rotom-W, and Corviknight with Focus Blast. Sludge Wave hits Grass-types like Rotom-C and Breloom as well as easing the Fairy matchup alongside Iron Treads and Clodsire, while Psychic threatens Urshifu-R and Air Balloon Glimmora and pops Gholdengo's Air Balloon, as Landorus is walled by it otherwise. Nasty Plot renders Landorus completely unwallable, notably letting it OHKO Corviknight. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used to catch Volcarona, Zapdos, and Frosmoth off guard; however, it forces Landorus to use the suboptimal Naive nature and should only be used if teammates don't have answers for the listed targets. Substitute is a great option on Landorus because of the amount of switches it forces as well as making Kingambit's Sucker Punch easier to outplay.</p> <p>Landorus appreciates Water Absorb Clodsire and Storm Drain Gastrodon switching into Water-type Pokemon like Barraskewda, Walking Wake, and Basculegion-F. Choice Scarf Great Tusk threatens Pokemon with Ice-type coverage like Latios and Greninja. Iron Treads provides support in the Fairy matchup and provides pivoting with Volt Switch, luring switch-ins like Corviknight and Volcarona for Landorus to take advantage of. Furthermore, Iron Treads removes Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin and enhances Landorus's wallbreaking with Knock Off, removing recovery items like Leftovers and Black Sludge from Rotom-W and Amoonguss. Additionally, Choice Scarf Iron Treads is a great asset in the Fairy matchup and threatens Ice-types like Weavile. Sandy Shocks is a great teammate in the Flying and Water matchups, providing Gravity support and additional pivoting with Volt Switch. Quagsire is able to check Gouging Fire as well as providing entry hazards and chip damage with Toxic. Ting-Lu provides entry hazards and phazing to wear down the opponent's team for Landorus and appreciates the removal of Fighting-types. Ursaluna can switch into Ghost-type moves from faster opponents like Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Hisuian Zoroark as well as aiding in heavily denting teams alongside Landorus. In return, Landorus provides a Fighting-type resistance and threatens Fighting-types with Psychic.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>Access to Sheer Force, a variety of coverage moves, and a phenomenal Speed tier thanks to Choice Scarf make Landorus an elite revenge killer on Ground teams, taking out Choice Specs Greninja and all Ogerpon formes after entry hazard damage. Focus Blast tears apart Dark-types and Ground-immune Steel-type Pokemon such as Chien-Pao, Hydreigon, and Orthworm. Psychic makes the Fighting matchup a lot easier, OHKOing Great Tusk, Urshifu-R, and Iron Valiant, as well as taking out Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock damage, making the Poison matchup extremely one sided. Sludge Bomb aids in the Fairy matchup, OHKOing Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Azumarill, and helps greatly against Grass-type Pokemon that Ground-type teams would otherwise struggle to break, taking out prominent threats such as Breloom and Hisuian Lilligant. U-turn is a great pivot option for Landorus, gaining momentum by scaring out Pokemon it threatens while inflicting damage on the replacement and getting switch initiative.</p> <p>Landorus cowers in fear at the thought of a single snowflake, which is why Quagsire is a great teammate for it. Quagsire is able to stand up to terrifying Ice-type move users such as Swords Dance Weavile, Swords Dance Urshifu-R and Azumarill without Trailblaze as well as providing entry hazard support via Spikes and Stealth Rock and spreading Toxic to soften foes up for Landorus. Iron Treads forms a wonderful core with Landorus as well, switching in on foes that attack with Ice-type moves, such as Articuno, Frosmoth, and Alolan Ninetales, and hitting back with a very powerful Heavy Slam or Iron Head. Iron Treads can also remove Stealth Rock via Rapid Spin and remove items via Knock Off, increasing Landorus's longevity and wallbreaking capabilities. Ice Spinner is also an option to take out opposing Landorus and Gliscor. In turn, Landorus can switch into a weakened Ogerpon-H as well as Ground- and Fighting-type attacks that would make quick work of Iron Treads. Landorus also appreciates Pokemon such as Water Absorb Clodsire and Storm Drain Gastrodon, as they can switch in to Water-type attacks from Pokemon such as Walking Wake, Barraskewda, and Basculegion-F. Clodsire is a very good special wall, while Gastrodon takes neutral damage from Ice Beam as well as walling Choice Scarf Greninja and providing a myriad of hazard support. Both Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B complement Landorus nicely, as they are able to switch into Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon that Landorus would otherwise struggle against, such as Flutter Mane and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Ursaluna-B is also capable of picking off weakened Dark-type Pokemon such as Kingambit, Greninja, and Chien-Pao with Vacuum Wave. In turn, Landorus can switch in on the Fighting-type attacks that would trouble Ursaluna and Ursaluna-B, and threatening the foe with Psychic. Gliscor is another great teammate for Landorus, as it is able to whittle down opponents via Knock Off and Toxic. Mamoswine is able to take down the Flying-type Pokemon that Landorus would otherwise be ineffective against and can also make use of its Thick Fat ability to tank some additional Ice-type moves. Sandy Shocks not only can set hazards but also can pivot around with Volt Switch, allowing Landorus to come in on an easy target.</p>"

Psychic allows Landorus to become a major threat to Poison-teams, as it 2HKOes Galarian Weezing, the only Pokemon immune to Earth Power on such teams. It also annihilates Fighting-types like Breloom after its Focus Sash is broken as well as Zamazenta and pops Gholdengo's Air Balloon. Nasty Plot amps up Landorus's power level to astonishing levels, allowing it to easily rip through bulkier defensive cores on types like Water, while Rock Slide alongside 20 Attack IVs allows Landorus to lure in and OHKO Articuno and Frosmoth, major roadblocks to its wallbreaking exploits. Rock Slide also targets Volcarona.</p> <p>Enamorus is a great partner for Landorus, as the two genies partner up to beat the other's checks. Enamorus provides speed control for Landorus against the likes of unboosted Chien-Pao and Dragapult as well as Healing Wish support to allow Landorus a second chance at breaking through depleted defensive cores, while Landorus breaks through problematic Steel-types like Gholdengo and Archaludon for Enamorus. Corviknight appreciates Landorus taking advantage of Electric-type attacks to come in; in return, it can remove Stealth Rock to give Landorus more longevity, give it a slow pivot in with U-turn, and check miscellaneous threats like Flutter Mane that Landorus cannot handle. Gyarados deals with Chien-Pao while spreading paralysis to help Landorus outspeed and OHKO otherwise faster threats like Roaring Moon. Dragonite is a potentially game-ending threat or great wallbreaker that appreciates Landorus removing Steel-types for it. Skarmory sets entry hazards to soften up Landorus's few defensive answers, letting it break through teams far more easily, while soft-checking Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Articuno provides a great special wall for Landorus, most notably taking on threats like Alolan Ninetales and Greninja that outspeed and threaten out Landorus. Gliscor is another entry hazard setter with great longevity, and it can take on the more powerful Fighting-types like Choice Band Zamazenta that Landorus gets quickly worn down by. Tornadus-T is another good partner, as it both outspeeds troublesome foes like Ogerpon-W and Iron Valiant and removes Assault Vest and Shuca Berry for Landorus to rip through bulky teams.</p>"

Articuno supports Landorus-T by switching into special attacks from the likes of Porygon2, Sinistcha, and Galarian Moltres, along with threatening Water-types like Primarina and Greninja with Freeze-Dry. Landorus-T appreciates Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed to pick off faster targets such as Choice Scarf Darkrai and Choice Scarf Ninetales.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ice</h4> <p>Focus Blast can be used over Earth Power to OHKO Tyranitar, giving Kyurem an edge in the otherwise difficult Rock matchup. The move also 2HKOes Blissey after slight chip damage or Stealth Rock if its Heavy-Duty Boots can be removed, although its shaky accuracy means these advantages are easily undermined by bad luck. Running Focus Blast also leaves Kyurem completely walled by Gholdengo and Jirachi. Dragon Pulse gives Kyurem a more spammable Dragon-type STAB option, but the combined strength and coverage of its standard moves leave little reason for Kyurem to spam anything else. Ancient Power allows Kyurem to effectively lure Articuno for itself, but its low base power and overlapping coverage with Kyurem's other moves leave few other use cases for it.</p> <h4>Dragon</h4> <p>Flash Cannon is an alternative option for Kyurem, allowing it to take on Fairy-types that resist both its STAB options such as Klefki and Alolan Ninetales. However, most Fairy-type targets of Flash Cannon would outspeed and force Kyurem out.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Kyurem makes for an exceptional special wallbreaker on Dragon teams by virtue of its high Special Attack further boosted by Choice Specs and a strong STAB combination. Ice Beam shreds through defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Amoonguss. Freeze-Dry, despite being weaker than Ice Beam, still hits the same walls with the added benefit of taking out Water-types such as Swampert, Toxapex, and Primarina. Focus Blast is strong coverage that targets Steel-types that resist both of its STAB moves such as Heatran and Kingambit, as well as Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Garganacl. Alternatively, Earth Power hits the same targets as Focus Blast along with non-Air Balloon Gholdengo and Poison-types such as Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowking, and Okidogi.</p> <p>Kyurem appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Archaludon and Garchomp to wear down foes into OHKO range of one of its attacks. Notably, Kyurem now has a great chance of OHKOing mixed defensive Toxapex sets after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes damage and a chance to outright OHKO physically defensive Ting-Lu after one layer of Spikes damage. In return, Archaludon and Garchomp appreciate Kyurem threatening entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Mandibuzz. Thanks to their Steel typing and great bulk, Archaludon and Hisuian Goodra take on Fairy-types; Archaludon takes on Mimikyu and Azumarill, while Hisuian Goodra handles Flutter Mane, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Enamorus. Choice Scarf Dragapult spreads paralysis with Thunder Wave, and its faster U-turn allows it to threaten the likes of Choice Scarf Hoopa-U and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, the latter of which can be especially threatening to Dragon teams with its Protean-boosted Play Rough, while Choice Scarf Latias handles Fighting-types such as non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Zamazenta. Dragapult and Latias appreciate Kyurem taking out Ting-Lu and Primarina in return. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon provides great speed control, outspeeding and threatening the likes of Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Latias, Gholdengo, and Enamorus while providing pivoting with U-turn. In return, Kyurem deals with Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Amoonguss. Late-game sweepers such as Gouging Fire, Swords Dance Garchomp, and Dragonite appreciate Kyurem's wallbreaking that enables their sweep.</p>"

      "Old Man Winter [Choice Specs] (Ice)": {
        "description": "<p>Kyurem's high offensive stats, access to Freeze-Dry, and surprisingly solid defensive profile make it an unparalleled special wallbreaker for Ice teams, with its resistances and coverage letting it pull its weight against Fire and Water teams by giving it good matchups against the likes of Ogerpon-H and Dondozo among others. STAB Draco Meteor is already a fearsome tool for Kyurem to wield unboosted, but with Choice Specs equipped, it becomes downright nuclear, OHKOing common neutral targets such as Archaludon, Slowbro, and Ursaluna-B. Ice Beam is the default secondary STAB move for its reliability, giving Kyurem an extremely strong attack that's also spammable; it importantly deals massive neutral damage to many common Draco Meteor switch-ins, securing 2HKOs on Clefable, Hatterene, Corviknight, and Galarian Weezing. Blizzard is a stronger alternative to Ice Beam that achieves incredible damage benchmarks, securing a guaranteed OHKO on Clodsire and 2HKO on Hisuian Goodra after Stealth Rock, two feats that Ice Beam never achieves; however, Blizzard relies on snow being active to be consistent, forcing Kyurem's snow-setting teammate to either run Icy Rock or play far more conservatively than they would otherwise. Freeze-Dry is arguably the most important tool in Kyurem's arsenal, letting it carry the Water matchup on its back by undermining would-be checks like Primarina, Toxapex, and Tentacruel and scoring harder hits on otherwise neutral targets like Quagsire, Rotom-W, and Dondozo. Earth Power rounds out Kyurem's moveset nicely by giving it coverage for the Steel-types that resist its STAB combination, notably OHKOing Kingambit and Metagross after Stealth Rock while handily 2HKOing dedicated walls like Empoleon and non-Choice Scarf Jirachi. Earth Power also scores a super effective hit on bulky Poison-types like Alolan Muk, which can give Kyurem a hard time otherwise. A Timid nature is an absolute requirement on Kyurem, since its crowded Speed tier would leave a Modest variant outsped by common threats to it such as Glimmora, Excadrill, and non-Choice Scarf Great Tusk, among others.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales is a crucial partner for Kyurem, enabling Blizzard spam and boosting its bulk to ludicrous proportions with snow and Aurora Veil; Kyurem becomes so staggeringly bulky in these conditions that a revenge killing tool as strong as Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch will not even 2HKO it after Stealth Rock. Alolan Ninetales's part-Fairy typing is also useful for discouraging Dragon-type revenge killers like Latios, Dragapult, and Walking Wake with Moonblast. Since Kyurem cannot use Heavy-Duty Boots on this set, it must rely on entry hazard removal to maintain its longevity; Alolan Sandslash is a standout choice here thanks to Rapid Spin and its secondary Steel typing, allowing it to switch into common revenge killers like Iron Boulder, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane, as well as threatening Rock- and Fairy-type attackers with its STAB moves. Slush Rush also lets it provide speed control that Kyurem needs to help against threats like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao. Mamoswine brings Stealth Rock to make Kyurem even harder to switch into, Ice Shard to help with speed control, and an Earthquake that shakes most Steel-types and special walls into Kyurem's KO range or out of the game altogether, notably OHKOing Gholdengo, Klefki, and Hisuian Goodra after Stealth Rock. Froslass can provide further entry hazard support with Spikes, speed control with Thunder Wave, and spinblocking utility while also switching into Fighting-type attacks for Kyurem, and Destiny Bond lets it trade with a problematic target such as Ogerpon-H. Chien-Pao is another strong physical attacker that also threatens Gholdengo and boasts an amazing Speed tier, letting it clean up weakened teams with a Choice Band or Swords Dance set after Kyurem has weakened them; Chien-Pao also loves Kyurem's ability to threaten Primarina and Azumarill with Freeze-Dry. Weavile is similar to Chien-Pao and contributes a powerful Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots or Eviolite from certain walls that rely on them such as Articuno and Porygon2, respectively. Avalugg is another hazard removal option that provides a much sturdier fallback against physical revenge killers compared to Alolan Sandslash and serves as a secondary wincon with an IronPress set, but this comes at the cost of being agonizingly slow and useless against most Fairy-types.</p>"

Secret Sword sets Keldeo apart from other Water-type attackers by allowing Keldeo to OHKO specially defensive targets such as Hisuian Goodra and to 2HKO Articuno and Alolan Muk. Vacuum Wave can pick off weakened foes such as Roaring Moon, Excadrill, and Meowscarada. Lastly, Icy Wind targets Dragonite and prevents popular Choice Specs users like Dragapult and Latios from switching into Keldeo.</p> <p>Keldeo appreciates entry hazard setters such as Swampert and Gastrodon, as they bolster Keldeo's attacking prowess and are immune to Electric. Swampert can also run utility moves such as Knock Off and Flip Turn, which makes it the ideal partner to maintain pressure. Toxapex provides a useful Fairy-resistant option for Flutter Mane's Moonblast, removes Toxic Spikes from the field, and has access to utility options such as Toxic, Toxic Spikes, and Haze to support Keldeo. Hisuian Samurott can set up Spikes, provides a useful Psychic immunity, and can remove foes such as Dragapult and Latios with Sucker Punch, which reduces the need for prediction on Keldeo's part. Other excellent offensive teammates include Ogerpon-W and Greninja; Ogerpon-W can deal with Water Absorb Clodsire, Azumarill, and Primarina against which Keldeo is powerless, and Greninja can address any issue Keldeo faces thanks to its huge offensive movepool. Greninja's Sludge Wave hits Grass- and Fairy-types that handle Keldeo like the Ogerpon formes, Primarina, and Iron Valiant, while Extrasensory and Ice Beam can deal with Poison-, Flying-, and Dragon-types.

Vacuum Wave serves as a strong revenge killing option for Keldeo, picking off faster weakened threats like Chien-Pao and Excadrill and KOing Meowscarada after Stealth Rock damage with ease. Icy Wind grants Keldeo coverage against Dragon-types, and with the Speed drop, it is able to counter Dragon Dance attempts from Garchomp.

Will-O-Wisp weakens physical threats like Mamoswine, Garchomp, Iron Treads, and Excadrill; U-turn can be run over Will-O-Wisp to let Talonflame hit Meowscarada and Hoopa-U while also allowing it to pivot into one of its teammates. But doing so will remove the opportunity to weaken the aforementioned physical threats with a burn, which can be a problem for the team. Heavy-Duty Boots is the go-to item that lets Talonflame avoid taking damage from Stealth Rock. The given EV spread lets Talonflame outspeed and OHKO Ogerpon-W with Brave Bird.</p> <p>All of Talonflame's teammates appreciate the removal of hazards and Ground immunity that Talonflame provides. Swords Dance Ogerpon-H is an amazing teammate for Talonflame, taking out pesky Water- and Rock-types like Primarina, Quagsire, and Rhyperior at +2 with Horn Leech. After a Dragon Dance boost, Gouging Fire takes out a plethora of threats like Raging Bolt, Choice Specs Walking Wake, Tentacruel, and Iron Hands with Scale Shot and Earthquake. Choice Scarf Cinderace can use High Jump Kick to deal with troublesome Rock-, Normal-, and Dark-types like Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine, Ursaluna-B, and Choice Specs Greninja. Swords Dance Ceruledge is a great setup sweeper that can deal with pesky Psychic- and Ghost-types like Iron Boulder and Flutter Mane with Shadow Sneak after a boost. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine is a great wallbreaker for Talonflame, being able to take out Flying-types like Gyarados, Dragonite, and Skarmory. Volcanion provides a Water immunity for Talonflame while checking Azumarill with Sludge Wave. Heatran tanks special hits from the likes of Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Power Gem while OHKOing it back with Heavy Slam. Heatran also traps walls like Toxapex with Magma Storm and stops them from recovering with Taunt.</p>"

Heavy Slam allows Hisuian Goodra to hit Fairy-type threats like Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant while denting Calm Mind Primarina and Hatterene to prevent them from setting up. Knock Off permits Hisuian Goodra to remove Leftovers from switch-ins like Corviknight, Ursaluna-B, Archaludon, and opposing Hisuian Goodra. Dragon Tail is a great phazing move, preventing foes like Nasty Plot Gholdengo, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and Gouging Fire from setting up on Hisuian Goodra. Protect grants Hisuian Goodra a form of passive recovery while also permitting it to scout moves from potentially Choice-locked foes like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Dragapult is a remarkable teammate for Hisuian Goodra, as it provides a much-needed Fighting immunity, meaning it can comfortably switch into attacks from Barraskewda, Iron Defense Zamazenta, and Skarmory, which Hisuian Goodra is highly susceptible to, and force them out with the threat of Will-O-Wisp. Dragapult also provides Dragon teams with a high Speed tier, allowing it to use U-turn to pivot into Hisuian Goodra before threatening special attackers like Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Hatterene and Greninja can attack it. In return, Hisuian Goodra hits opposing Dragapult and Skeledirge with Knock Off and switches into Moonblast from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. Garchomp is an astounding lead for Dragon teams, setting up Stealth Rock and Spikes for Hisuian Goodra, which can use Dragon Tail to force foes to take chip damage from the entry hazards Garchomp sets. Garchomp also handles pesky Steel-type foes like Kingambit and Gholdengo, which Hisuian Goodra isn't very good against, with Earthquake. Choice Band Dragonite provides a much-needed Ground immunity for Hisuian Goodra while also serving as a capable wallbreaker and revenge killer with Choice Band Extreme Speed. In return, Hisuian Goodra can come in on attacks like Ice Beam from Greninja and Freeze-Dry from Articuno, which Garchomp and Dragonite are extremely vulnerable to. Archaludon forms a great defensive core with Hisuian Goodra, as not only do they share their typing, but Archaludon also provides outstanding physical bulk. Hisuian Goodra is highly susceptible to physical attacks from foes like Baxcalibur, Dragon Darts Dragapult, and Gouging Fire, which Archaludon can comfortably switch into. Archaludon can also set up Stealth Rock for Dragon teams and threaten foes like Chien-Pao and Kingambit, which Hisuian Goodra can't deal with, with Body Press. In exchange, Hisuian Goodra can easily take on attacks like Moonblast from Flutter Mane and Enamorus and Draco Meteor from Walking Wake and Raging Bolt, which Archaludon cannot survive due to its low special bulk. Baxcalibur and Gouging Fire are amazing setup sweepers that help take out foes like Gliscor, Ogerpon-H, and opposing Hisuian Goodra. Choice Specs Kyurem showcases its wallbreaking ability by OHKOing foes that Hisuian Goodra cannot touch, like Swampert, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Ogerpon-W, with Freeze-Dry. Raging Bolt and Walking Wake are also potentially capable wallbreakers, Raging Bolt providing priority with Thunderclap and Walking Wake exterminating threats like Baxcalibur and Great Tusk with Draco Meteor and Scald, respectively. Roaring Moon and Latios are amazing late-game cleaners, Roaring Moon checking threats like Ceruledge and Choice Scarf Enamorus with Knock Off and Iron Head and Latios denting threats like Keldeo, Great Tusk, and Garchomp with Luster Purge and Draco Meteor. Latias provides Healing Wish support to Dragon teams, allowing Hisuian Goodra to last longer in a game with more special attackers. Both Latios and Latias also provide a Ground immunity thanks to Levitate, which Hisuian Goodra appreciates. Kommo-o is a great teammate, as it can set up Stealth Rock and OHKO threats to Hisuian Goodra like Chien-Pao and Kingambit with Vacuum Wave.</p>"

Thunderbolt hits Skarmory, Corviknight, Pelipper, and Greninja, while Flamethrower can also deal with Skarmory and Corviknight in addition to Gholdengo. Ice Beam checks problematic Flying-types like Landorus and Zapdos, while Earthquake can be used to target down special walls that want to take on Hisuian Goodra such as opposing Hisuian Goodra and Alolan Muk along with completing its coverage against Steel, allowing Hisuian Goodra to deal with Heatran. Draco Meteor enables Hisuian Goodra to be less passive by being able to dish out an immense burst of damage; alternatively, Dragon Pulse can more reliably check threats like Substitute Hydreigon. Heavy Slam allows for Hisuian Goodra to easily deal with Articuno and Primarina; however, Dragon Tail can be used to phaze setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres and rack up damage from entry hazards set up by Hisuian Goodra's teammates. The EV Spread allows for Hisuian Goodra to outspeed Skarmory along with paralyzed threats like Keldeo and Iron Moth and lets it OHKO Latios with Draco Meteor. A Sassy nature allows for Hisuian Goodra to take more damage against foes such as Choice Specs Dragapult, while a Quiet nature gives more power to Hisuian Goodra's special attacks, allowing it to potentially OHKO threats such as Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Skarmory and Corviknight pair excellently with Hisuian Goodra thanks to their Flying typing giving them a Fighting neutrality and Ground immunity, making them able to come in on threats such as Sneasler, Great Tusk, and Quagsire. Meanwhile, Skarmory and Corviknight appreciate Hisuian Goodra's ability to deal with threats like Greninja and Hisuian Zoroark. Gholdengo provides solid support thanks to its Ghost typing blocking Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Skarmory, Iron Hands, and Zamazenta along with providing Thunder Wave support. Iron Treads supports Hisuian Goodra by being able to use Rapid Spin to remove hazards to provide Hisuian Goodra safe entry along with dealing with Garchomp and Landorus thanks to Ice Spinner. Hisuian Goodra appreciates Archaludon's ability to take on physical attackers such as Kingambit and Ceruledge, which immensely scare Hisuian Goodra. Hisuian Goodra appreciates Kingambit and Scizor being able to pick off faster threats like Meowscarada, Iron Boulder, and Iron Valiant with their powerful priority moves, while Kingambit and Scizor greatly appreciate Hisuian Goodra's ability to remove Skarmory and Corviknight.</p>"

However, Steel teams are usually balanced, and Klefki does not bring much defensive utility or longevity to be beneficial long term. It is mostly outclassed by Skarmory as a Spikes setter and Fighting-neutral Pokemon. Skarmory also provides a valuable Ground-immune and potential as a IronPress setup sweeper. On the other hand, Klefki's role compression with dual screens support can be valuable on more offensive teams.</p>",

      "Dual Screens (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>Klefki is an excellent pick for Fairy teams due to its Prankster dual screens and Spikes support, which enables threats such as Azumarill, Primarina, and Hatterene to set up and sweep. Foul Play allows Klefki to punish setup sweepers such as Scizor, Gouging Fire, and Ogerpon-H while preventing Roaring Moon and Excadrill from setting up completely for free. Alternatively, Thunder Wave cripples fast threats such as Sneasler, Iron Moth, and Flutter Mane. Klefki’s Steel typing blocks Mortal Spin and turns annoying matchups against foes like Alolan Muk into an opportunity to set Spikes. Maximum Defense investment allows Klefki to deal with Scizor, which is an extremely dangerous threat for Fairy teams.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill greatly appreciates Klefki's dual screens support, as it enables Azumarill to easily set up against threats such as Gholdengo and Alolan Muk. Additionally, Spikes provides chip damage to ensure Azumarill OHKOes Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-C with +6 Aqua Jet. Flutter Mane appreciates Klefki's Spikes support wearing down checks like Hisuian Goodra, Alolan Muk, and Toxapex. In return, Flutter Mane blocks Rapid Spin to keep Klefki's Spikes on the field. Iron Valiant appreciates Klefki's ability to slow down foes such as Flutter Mane, Cinderace, and Sneasler with Thunder Wave. In return, Iron Valiant provides offensive pressure on Steel teams while threatening Defoggers such as Corviknight and Mandibuzz with its wide coverage. Primarina appreciates Klefki's dual screens support, allowing it to set up in the face of Pokemon like Gouging Fire and Archaludon. Hatterene and Klefki form a strong defensive core, with Hatterene checking walls such as Clodsire and Toxapex while Klefki deals with Scizor. Hatterene is excellent at punishing entry hazard setters that can freely set hazards against Klefki like Ting-Lu and Skarmory. Klefki's dual screens support allows Hatterene to easily take on Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Toxapex, and Clodsire by serving as a wincon with Calm Mind. Clefable is an excellent teammate, as the two can form an entry hazard-stacking core with Spikes and Stealth Rock. As Klefki is vulnerable to Ground-type attacks, Enamorus makes a great ally.</p>"

Thunder Wave can be used instead to hinder fast threats and special setup sweepers such as Cinderace, Flutter Mane, and Volcarona, aiding sweepers that would otherwise be slower.</p> <p>Gholdengo is one of Klefki's best teammates, as it blocks Defog from Corviknight and Mandibuzz and Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and Terapagos. This is essential in maintaining the progress Klefki makes. Gholdengo also benefits greatly from dual screen supports, as this eases setting up Nasty Plot on otherwise irritating foes such as Flutter Mane and Alolan Muk. Iron Crown, Excadrill, and Scizor also appreciate the dual screens support from Klefki, which eases setup, while the former can more easily activate Weakness Policy without getting KOed by hits such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball and Life Orb Landorus's Earth Power. Klefki cannot check threats such as Gouging Fire, Volcarona, and Landorus, so defensive stalwarts such as Archaludon, Heatran, and Corviknight are essential. In addition, Corviknight can serve as a Bulk Up wincon or as a valuable U-turn pivot for setup sweepers. Klefki cannot prevent entry hazards from being set by setters such as Ting-Lu and Skarmory, so Rapid Spin support from Iron Treads and Excadrill is valuable.</p>"

Iron Defense works excellently with Body Press, and Avalugg finds plenty of setup opportunities under Aurora Veil and snow. This turns it into a potentl wincon against Fighting and Dark teams once checks such as Iron Valiant and Darkrai have been removed. Avalanche can be used instead to deal massive damage to Flying-types like Gliscor and Dragonite and prevent them from setting up on Avalugg. This move also prevents Avalugg from being completely walled by Ghost teams. With Mirror Coat, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Sturdy, Avalugg can be a reliable emergency answer to any snowballing special threats such as Volcarona and Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Avalugg walls physical threats best with snow and Aurora Veil support. Therefore, Alolan Ninetales is a perfect teammate. In addition, Alolan Ninetales can threaten Keldeo and Kommo-o for Avalugg, while it can switch into and threaten Kingambit for Alolan Ninetales. Avalugg is a complete liability against Ghost-type threats, as Gholdengo and Hisuian Zoroark are able to easily set up on it. Therefore, Weavile makes a strong ally to deal with Ghost teams. Similarly, Avalugg struggles to do much to Fire- and Poison-type targets such as Heatran and Okidogi. Mamoswine makes a great teammate, as it can tank hits from these foes while threatening them back with Earthquake. Cloyster is also a great because it can offensively threaten Fire teams after a Shell Smash. Avalugg cannot beat opposing physical walls such as Toxapex and Skarmory.

Alternatively, Flamethrower can be used to allow Noivern to threaten Steel- and Ice-types like Gholdengo, Skarmory, and Froslass, while Draco Meteor provides another strong offensive tool, which can prove useful in the mirror matchup. A defensive EV spread is preferred, allowing Noivern to stick around reliably throughout a game, as it can take two Dark Pulses from Hydreigon and a Power Gem from Glimmora. Alternatively, it can run an offensive spread to assuredly OHKO targets like Latios and the Ogerpon formes.</p> <p>Archaludon can take on powerful physical Ice- and Rock-type attackers that threaten Noivern such as Weavile, Cloyster, Kleavor, and Iron Boulder and can respond with Flash Cannon. Archaludon can also support Noivern by using Thunder Wave to allow Noivern to outspeed targets like Meowscarada and Zamazenta. Hisuian Goodra, meanwhile, can take on special Dragon- and Fairy-types like Hex Dragapult, Kyurem, Flutter Mane, and Primarina.

Its strong offensive STAB combination coupled with great coverage allows it to muscle through bulky Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Toxapex, Iron Hands, and Amoonguss, and with its great special bulk, it can prove useful against Ghost teams. Drain Punch grants Hoopa-U super effective coverage against Dark- and Steel-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Brick Break can also be run as Hoopa-U's Fighting-type move, as this allows it to remove dual screens set by Fairy- and Dark-type teams. Trick is a great option for Hoopa-U to hinder Pokemon that can take a hit like Sableye and Klefki, as well as potentially disrupt Pokemon reliant on their items such as Moltres. Gunk Shot is another great option, as it allows Hoopa-U to threaten Fairy-types like Azumarill and to OHKO Hatterene. By investing 8 EVs in Special Defense, Hoopa-U can live a Moonblast from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane.</p> <p>Azelf and Scream Tail make for great partners, as they can set up entry hazards for Hoopa-U to be able to wallbreak more easily. Azelf can also run Taunt to prevent Defog users like Corviknight removing its hazards, while Scream Tail can also set up dual screens for both Hoopa-U and its teammates and provide Wish support. Because of Hoopa-U's lack of longevity outside of Wish, it can get easily worn down by hazards. Hence, Hatterene is a great partner, as it is able to provide great hazard control for Psychic teams through Magic Bounce. Galarian Slowking is another great partner for Hoopa-U, as it provides Hoopa-U a switch-in to Fairy-types and aids Hoopa-U's wallbreaking through Future Sight. Galarian Slowking can also set up Toxic Spikes to annoy Hoopa-U's switch-ins such as Azumarill, and its Poison typing allows it to remove Toxic Spikes to prevent Hoopa-U from getting worn down by poison. Indeedee is another great addition to Psychic teams, as its Normal typing grants it an immunity to Ghost. Aside from this, Indeedee can set up Psychic Terrain to allow Hoopa-U to threaten Kingambit with Drain Punch without fearing Sucker Punch. Lastly, late-game sweepers such as Gallade and Armarouge appreciate Hoopa-U beating their checks such as Azumarill for the former and Galarian Slowking for the latter.

Hyperspace Fury OHKOes both Flutter Mane and Dragapult and can be used to break through special tanks such as Hisuian Goodra and Galarian Slowking. Dark Pulse complements it nicely by offering a powerful neutral attack against physically bulky Steel- and Water-types like Archaludon, Iron Treads, Scizor, and Toxapex. Alternatively, Focus Blast targets Dark-type foes like Darkrai and Bisharp. Psychic covers Fighting and Fairy matchups, preventing threats like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta from switching in safely. Expanding Force is a viable alternative if the team uses Psychic Terrain, transforming Hoopa-U into a killing machine for the Terrain's duration. The last moveslot aims at targeting specific foes.

Hatterene can send entry hazards back to the opponent; paralyze the target with Nuzzle; take care of most Dark-types such as Roaring Moon, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarada; and provide Healing Wish support to Hoopa-U. Slowbro helps mitigate Hoopa-U's poor physical bulk by absorbing physical moves, spreading burns with Scald, and effectively hard-countering physical bulky setup sweepers such as Gouging Fire with its IronPress combination. Indeedee-M sets up Psychic Terrain, effectively negating any priority move for the Terrain's duration and massively boosting Hoopa-U's potential with Expanding Force, and has access to Healing Wish in case of need. Lastly, Hoopa-U appreciates other sweeper teammates such as Latios, Metagross, and Iron Boulder that can weaken defensive cores of types like Fairy, Flying, and Fire to allow a proper Hoopa-U sweep. Latios is especially threatening to Flying teams with access to BoltBeam coverage and a powerful STAB move in Draco Meteor, while Metagross and Iron Boulder can both offer a breaking potential similar to Latios's in Fairy and Fire matchups, respectively, with access to Heavy Slam, Bullet Punch, and Stealth Rock for Metagross and Mighty Cleave on top of naturally outspeeding both Meowscarada and Greninja for Iron Boulder.</p>"

Its special bulk is also notable, allowing it to trade blows with the likes of Iron Valiant and Ursaluna-B.</p> <p>Swords Dance Chien-Pao is an amazing teammate for Hoopa-U, as it is able to deal with Dragon-, Ground-, and Flying-types like Dragonite, Enamorus, and Clodsire with Icicle Crash and Ice Shard. Swords Dance Kingambit provides a Fairy neutrality while also being a great wincon, taking out a plethora of foes for Hoopa-U with Sucker Punch at +2 and with five Supreme Overlord boosts. Alolan Muk is a great special wall, easing the Fairy matchup thanks to its Poison typing while dealing with Primarina and Hatterene with Poison Jab. Choice Scarf Meowscarada deals with Water-, Ground- and Fighting-types like Urshifu-R, Quagsire, and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant with Flower Trick and Play Rough. Choice Specs Greninja covers a lot of matchups thanks to Protean, notably taking out the Ogerpon formes, Hatterene, and the Landorus formes with Sludge Wave and Ice Beam. Sableye provides a Fighting immunity while also weakening physical threats like Excadrill, Sneasler, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk with Will-O-Wisp. Sableye can also use Encore on setup sweepers like Zamazenta and spread paralysis with Thunder Wave so Hoopa-U can outspeed faster threats. Mandibuzz provides entry hazard removal for Hoopa-U with Defog and slow pivoting with U-turn. Mandibuzz also checks Swords Dance sweepers like Ogerpon-H and Scizor with Foul Play. It's also worth mentioning that Mandibuzz provides a Ground immunity, which allows it to come in on Choice Scarf Great Tusk's Headlong Rush for Hoopa-U. Ting-Lu is a great wall that can lay down hazards with Stealth Rock and Spikes, which chip down threats like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta. Ting-Lu also handles Steel-types like non-Air Balloon Heatran and Hisuian Goodra with Earthquake and phazes setup sweepers like Swords Dance Garchomp and Dragon Dance Dragonite with Whirlwind. Hydreigon also sets hazards with Stealth Rock while taking out Dragon-types like Archaludon with Draco Meteor. In return, Hoopa-U deals with Skarmory, Galarian Weezing, and Iron Valiant for its teammates.</p>"

      "Trick Room (Dark)": {
        "description": "<p>Hoopa-U takes advantage of its ability to run multiple sets in order to force out threats like Keldeo, non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, and Hippowdon to set up Trick Room and start decimating faster-paced types like Fighting, Dragon, and Ground. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Articuno and Corviknight, which readily soaks up its other attacks, while Psychic trashes Fighting teams and lets Hoopa-U OHKO Toxapex. Focus Blast lets Hoopa-U immediately OHKO Archaludon, which greatly threatens Dark teams. The given EV spread lets Hoopa-U outspeed Choice Specs Magnezone and slower threats, like Ursaluna-B and Kingambit, without the need for Trick Room so Hoopa-U does not have to set up Trick Room and potentially benefit slower foes, as Dark-type teams can outspeed and handle them without the need for Hoopa-U to do so. Alternatively, one can forgo the Speed and pour the remaining EVs into Defense, giving it a shot at surviving mixed Iron Valiant's Close Combat. The defensive EV investment makes Hoopa-U bulky enough to withstand Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast and Choice Specs Keldeo's Secret Sword. With 160 Special Attack EVs, a Modest nature, and Expert Belt, Hoopa-U is able to 2HKO even the bulkiest special walls in Articuno, Clodsire, and Iron Hands with the appropriate move and is strong enough to even remove Blissey after minimal chip damage with Focus Blast. If this sheer wallbreaking power is not needed, items that improve its longevity such as Heavy-Duty Boots, which is important because Dark teams' access to entry hazard removal is scarce, or Leftovers are preferred.</p> <p>Kingambit loves Hoopa-U's ability to set Trick Room up, despite not being dependent on it, in order to threaten Fairy- and Dark-types like Iron Valiant and Chien-Pao that normally check it instead. Aside from this, Kingambit forms a wallbreaking core with Hoopa-U, taking advantage of Hoopa-U's ability to remove Skarmory, Ursaluna-B, and Keldeo to wreak havoc on Flying, Ground, and Water teams late-game. Choice Scarf Meowscarada dispatches threats that OHKO Hoopa-U, like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Roaring Moon, and loves Hoopa-U's ability to remove bulky walls that prevent Meowscarada from making progress like Skarmory, Archaludon, and Toxapex. Chien-Pao acts as a cleaner after Hoopa-U has greatly weakened the opposing Corviknight and Ursaluna-B, tearing through Flying, Ground, and some Water teams after a Swords Dance, if it has the appropriate coverage. Defensive walls like Ting-Lu and Sableye are also appreciated, with Ting-Lu supporting Hoopa-U's wallbreaking by setting entry hazards and Sableye checking strong Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Sneasler, which can OHKO Hoopa-U. Mandibuzz provides Defog support to keep Hoopa-U healthy, checks setup sweepers like Scizor and Dragonite, and pivots Hoopa-U in, if the opportunity arises, with U-turn.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hoopa-U, by virtue of its great coverage and high Attack and Special Attack stats, is a great mixed attacker on Dark teams. Furthermore, its excellent Special Defense further boosted by Assault Vest allows it to tank hits other Dark-types struggle with, such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Choice Specs Kyurem's Draco Meteor. Psychic threatens Poison- and Fighting-types that Dark teams struggle with like Galarian Weezing, Toxapex, Iron Valiant, and Okidogi. Knock Off allows Hoopa-U to remove items from holders such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Volcarona, Talonflame, and Articuno, which is appreciated by its entry hazard-stacking teammates. Focus Blast threatens bulky Pokemon that can otherwise shrug off Hoopa-U's attacks such as Archaludon and Heatran. Thunderbolt threatens Flying-types such as Gyarados, Corviknight, Skarmory, and Pelipper. 36 Special Defense EVs in tandem with a Gentle nature allow Hoopa-U to easily take hits from Iron Valiant and Keldeo, while 96 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed and threaten Magnezone and Archaludon.</p> <p>Ting-Lu and Sableye are great defensive partners for Hoopa-U, as their great bulk allows them to take hits from attackers such as Kingambit, Iron Boulder, and Excadrill. Ting-Lu also provides entry hazard support in Stealth Rock and Spikes and phazes setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragonite and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire with Whirlwind, while Sableye provides a Fighting immunity, shuts down wallbreakers like Choice Band Excadrill and Choice Band Zamazenta with Will-O-Wisp, and takes advantage of setup sweepers such as Iron Defense Zamazenta and Dragon Dance Dragapult with Encore. Mandibuzz provides an immunity to Ground, slow pivoting with U-turn, and Defog support so Hoopa-U does not fear hazards when switching in, as well as taking advantage of physical attackers like Excadrill, Scizor, and Ceruledge with Foul Play. Alolan Muk takes off pressure from Hoopa-U by aiding it in handling Fairy-types such as Hatterene, Iron Valiant, and Primarina. Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Choice Specs Greninja make for great teammates, as with their great Speed tiers and abilities, they are able to take care of threats to Hoopa-U. Meowscarada handles Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Urshifu-R, while Greninja threatens Great Tusk, Tornadus-T, and Mamoswine. Kingambit is a great potential wincon, as with its excellent ability, Swords Dance, and Sucker Punch, it shines late-game, dealing with frail offensive threats like Flutter Mane.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Volcanion is a useful Pokemon on Fire teams mainly thanks to its ability, Water Absorb, offering the type an immunity to one of its most common weaknesses. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's preferred Water-type move, with it being able to burn its switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Iron Hands, reducing their overall longevity. Earth Power allows Volcanion to threaten opposing Volcanion, Toxapex, and Heatran. Sludge Bomb allows Volcanion to revenge kill Azumarill after a Belly Drum and threaten other Fairy-type Pokemon like Hatterene and Enamorus. It is also able to target Walking Wake and Rotom-W, which resist Volcanion's STAB attacks, potentially crippling them thanks to the 30% poison chance. Flamethrower is preferred over Fire Blast since it doesn't miss, and the reduced damage is not too significant if Volcanion is under sun, but Fire Blast can be used in order to 2HKO Hisuian Goodra under sun. 96 Speed EVs let Volcanion outspeed Adamant Azumarill in order to revenge kill it with Sludge Bomb, and the rest of the EVs are put in HP to improve Volcanion's overall bulk.</p> <p>Torkoal is a solid partner for Volcanion that assists it with Stealth Rock support, chipping down its switch-ins like Rotom-W and Alolan Muk and working well in conjunction with Steam Eruption's burn chance. Torkoal can also use Rapid Spin to clear away entry hazards for Volcanion if its Heavy-Duty Boots get removed by Alolan Muk or Meowscarada. Furthermore, Torkoal provides Volcanion with sun thanks to Drought, which boosts Volcanion's Fire-type attacks. In return, Volcanion can switch into Water attacks from Barraskewda and Pelipper, which threaten Torkoal. Scovillain helps out Volcanion by threatening Water-immune Pokemon like Clodsire and Gastrodon, and its damage onto the former allows Volcanion to revenge kill it and proceed to threaten slower Ground-types like Quagsire and Ting-Lu. Cinderace is able to threaten Hisuian Goodra with Libero High Jump Kick, whose Assault Vest set easily shrugs off Earth Power from Volcanion and chips it down with Draco Meteor. Cinderace can also steal dual screens from Klefki with Court Change in the Fairy matchup, which supplement Volcanion's naturally good bulk, letting it take hits better. In return, Volcanion offers an answer to Belly Drum Azumarill and threatens Cinderace's defensive answers like Toxapex and Skeledirge. Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine offers a solution to handle opposing Dragon-types like Baxcalibur, which can use Volcanion as setup fodder, and also threatens Dragapult and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Rotom-Heat provides an invaluable Ground immunity for Volcanion to avoid Earthquake from Pokemon like Iron Hands, Iron Treads, and Landorus-T and threatens all 3 of them with a burn from Will-O-Wisp. Rotom-H is also able to threaten defensive Water-types like Toxapex and offensive Water-types like Hisuian Samurott and Quaquaval if it opts for a Choice Scarf. Heatran can help Volcanion deal with Poison teams with its stallbreaker set, which allows it to trap and beat Pokemon like Toxapex one-on-one. Choice Scarf Iron Moth can revenge kill weakened Dragon-types like Walking Wake and Baxcalibur.</p>"

  "Primarina": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Fairy (Calm Mind)</h4> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots may be used over Leftovers due to Fairy having poor hazard control, but Primarina finds it a bit harder to set up without passive recovery. Alternatively, Covert Cloak may be used to prevent Alolan Muk's Poison Jab or Sneasler's Dire Claw from inflicting status on Primarina. Chilling Water lets Primarina take on physical attacking walls like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra, as it lowers their Attack to manageable levels, but the greatly reduced base power compared to Surf makes Primarina lose out on OHKOing Landorus and Ursaluna-B and 2HKOing Gholdengo and Skeledirge at +1. An EV spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 Spe with a Bold nature may be considered, as it lets Primarina outspeed and KO Modest Ursaluna-B which otherwise severely damages Primarina with Blood Moon, but the reduced bulk is detrimental to Primarina's ability to check Gouging Fire. If one opts for a fast variant of Primarina, Encore over Draining Kiss or Psychic Noise may also be considered to lock threats such as Belly Drum Azumarill and Bulk Up Corviknight into unfavorable moves. Liquid Voice may be considered to compress the effects of Psychic Noise and Surf into one move, making it easier to fit Encore, but being unable to hit Water Absorb Clodsire is undesirable. Substitute over Draining Kiss can also be considered to dodge status and force damage on switch-ins, but the lack of recovery apart from Leftovers can be detrimental.</p> <h4>Fairy (Assault Vest)</h4> <p>Draining Kiss can be used over Psychic Noise to grant Primarina a form of recovery. However, this comes with the cost of being walled by Poison-types like Toxapex and Amoonguss. Alternatively, Primarina can run Psychic Noise with Liquid Voice, which can block the healing of Dark-types like Alolan Muk, but this restricts its coverage and allows Water Absorb Clodsire to wall it.</p>",

      "Calm Mind (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>With an excellent typing and serviceable Speed and bulk, Primarina is one of the better users of Calm Mind for Fairy teams, as it deals with common roadblocks for Fairy like Corviknight, Clodsire, and Gouging Fire. Psychic Noise prevents all forms of recovery, making it harder for walls like the aforementioned Clodsire and Articuno to keep up with Primarina. Coincidentally, Psychic Noise also helps Primarina muscle past other bulky setup sweepers like Gouging Fire and Clefable. Draining Kiss improves Primarina's longevity and threatens Dragon- and Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Chien-Pao. Surf sweeps away Heatran, Skarmory, and Ursaluna-B, all of which are nuisances for Fairy teams. 60 Speed EVs let Primarina outspeed Corviknight and prevent it from recovering with Psychic Noise, making it easier to wear down, while the rest of the EVs are invested in Defense and HP to improve Primarina's matchup against Gouging Fire.</p> <p>Due to Primarina's relatively low Defense stat, dual screens support from Klefki is vital for its success, as it lets Primarina check Swords Dance Ceruledge and Gouging Fire. In return, Primarina deals with Clodsire, Gouging Fire, and Corviknight, which all take advantage of Klefki. Iron Valiant deals with Ogerpon formes, Kyurem, and Landorus, which overwhelm Primarina, and also deals with bulky Steel-types like Kingambit and Hisuian Goodra with Close Combat and Ice Punch. In return, Primarina checks Gouging Fire, which can take advantage of Choice-locked Iron Valiant. Choice Specs Flutter Mane outspeeds and vaporizes Choice Specs Greninja, Choice Specs Latios, Spectrier, and Ogerpon-H; in return, Primarina breaks down defensive Pokemon such as Articuno, Corviknight, Clodsire, and Skarmory for it. Entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, greatly hinder Primarina's ability to set up, so Primarina greatly appreciates Hatterene's ability to bounce back entry hazards with Magic Bounce. Hatterene also has a wide array of supportive moves like Nuzzle and Healing Wish which help circumvent Primarina's low Speed and give it a second chance to sweep. For instance, being able to slow down Articuno and Tornadus and subject Corviknight and Toxapex to the prospect of getting fully paralyzed makes Primarina's job easier. Belly Drum Azumarill is a secondary sweeper that deals with Hisuian Goodra and Alolan Muk, which Primarina struggles to beat, and it's also able to threaten Kingambit and Gliscor more. Choice Scarf Enamorus deals with fast threats like Dragapult and Choice Specs Greninja with Moonblast and loves Primarina being able to soften up opposing teams. Enamorus also provides Healing Wish, which gives Primarina a second chance to threaten opposing teams. Clefable can form a Calm Mind core with Primarina to overload special walls like Articuno and Alolan Muk, or it can set Stealth Rock and slow down the opposing team for Primarina with Thunder Wave. Mimikyu provides a failsafe against sweepers like Ceruledge due to Disguise, and it can use a Swords Dance set to clean up opposing teams late-game.</p>"

Draining Kiss is Primarina's main source of longevity, being especially effective against the aforementioned Fighting- and Dragon-types. When running Liquid Voice, Primarina can run Ice Beam to threaten Garchomp, Gliscor, and both Landorus formes. Surf is the better option for Primarina when it chooses to run Torrent so it has a stronger Water-type STAB attack. Alternatively, Encore can be used to take advantage of slower walls like Ting-Lu by locking them into an undesirable move. 60 Speed EVs allow Primarina to outspeed Corviknight and some Ursaluna-B variants.</p> <p>Primarina struggles against Poison-types such as Alolan Muk and Sneasler; therefore, it appreciates teammates such as Swampert and Gastrodon to check them. The two of them also provide an Electric immunity and entry hazard support. Toxapex absorbs Toxic Spikes while dealing with Grass-types that Primarina struggles with such as Meowscarada and the Ogerpon formes. In return, Primarina deals with some of Toxapex's checks like Great Tusk and Ursaluna-B. Keldeo and Urshifu-R are great offensive teammates that can muscle through Steel-types such as Archaludon, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit. Primarina deals with Iron Valiant in return. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott handles Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Spectrier, and in return, Primarina threatens Fighting-types like Zamazenta, Urshifu-R, and Keldeo. Choice Specs Greninja handles threats that Primarina struggles against, such as the Ogerpon formes, opposing Primarina, Amoonguss, and Okidogi.

Surf hits problematic Fire-types for Fairy such as Heatran and Iron Moth while also being able to force out Gholdengo and Spectrier before it uses Calm Mind. Moonblast hits Water-resistant foes like Hydrapple and Kyurem. Flip Turn gives Primarina a solid pivoting tool to switch out on threats it cannot handle, such as Alolan Muk, Articuno, and Hisuian Goodra. Finally, Psychic Noise allows Primarina to hit Poison-types like Amoonguss, Toxapex, and Okidogi. The EV spread used lets Primarina outspeed threats like Adamant Kingambit and Azumaril. The alternative EV spread is a bulkier set that outspeeds Corviknight and makes it more reliable against threats like Choice Specs Latios and Flutter Mane.</p> <p>With Primarina's limited recovery options, Hatterene provides excellent support, being able to keep entry hazards off the field and allowing Primarina to come in safely. Hatterene can also spread paralysis against threats like Gholdengo, Tornadus-T, and Gallade using Nuzzle. Klefki can provide hazard and dual screens support, allowing Primarina to combat special walls like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra. Clefable can provide hazard support in Stealth Rock, along with Wish support to heal Primarina. Flutter Mane appreciates Primarina's neutrality to Steel-type attacks from the likes of Choice Scarf Gholdengo, while Primarina appreciates Flutter Mane's strong movepool that can hinder problematic threats like Articuno, Ogerpon-H, and Raging Bolt. Flutter Mane also enjoys Primarina's Flip Turn to grant it safe entry. Primarina values physical Iron Valiant's ability to remove special walls like Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire. In return, Iron Valiant takes advantage of Primarina's ability to take on threats like Choice Scarf Latios, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Mimikyu appreciates Primarina's pivoting to grant it safe entry and setup opportunities. In exchange, Primarina welcomes Mimikyu's ability to remove threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Hands. Choice Scarf Enamorus can remove fasters threats like Sneasler and Iron Valiant and provide Healing Wish support.</p>"

Moonblast allows Ribombee to hit Dark- and Fighting-types such as Chien-Pao and Great Tusk, which can either outspeed Ribombee or remove Sticky Web thanks to Rapid Spin. Stun Spore allows Ribombee to annoy threats such as Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Walking Wake, letting its teammates outspeed and remove said foes later on in the game. Quiver Dance allows Ribombee to exert pressure throughout a game while potentially turning it into a win condition in the Dragon and Fighting matchups if it is not needed as a lead. Focus Sash lets Ribombee get Sticky Web up as a lead without having to fear being OHKOed due to its poor bulk.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kleavor is an excellent teammate for Ribombee, as it appreciates being able to outspeed nearly everything in the metagame under Sticky Web, including opposing Choice Scarf users such as Roaring Moon and Meowscarada. It also appreciates Ribombee hitting Fighting-types, such as Great Tusk and Iron Valiant, with Moonblast, allowing it to spam Stone Axe late-game to clean up weakened teams. In return, Kleavor threatens Fire-types such as Torkoal and Moltres that Bug teams struggle to break through. It also compounds with Ribombee's entry hazard pressure thanks to Stone Axe setting Stealth Rock. Swords Dance Scizor is another good teammate for Ribombee, as it appreciates being able to hit normally-faster threats that don't mind Bullet Punch, like Heatran and Walking Wake, hard thanks to Sticky Web not forcing it to rely on Bullet Punch for damage. In compensation, Scizor uses its Poison immunity to come in on threats such as Choice Scarf Sneasler that would otherwise threaten Ribombee and use them as a setup opportunity. It also removes Hatterene, which is invaluable to let Ribombee set up Sticky Web. Slither Wing is another great teammate, as it removes common Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon that Ribombee wouldn't be able to do much against. Forretress can keep hazards off of the field to enhance Ribombee's late-game sweeping potential and preserve its Focus Sash while being able to set hazards itself and take on threats such as Kingambit with Body Press. It also, similarly to Kleavor, can add to the hazard pressure by setting Spikes. Volcarona benefits greatly from Sticky Web, as after one Quiver Dance, it outspeeds Choice Scarf users that would otherwise attempt to revenge kill it, such as Roaring Moon and Urshifu-R. Ribombee, in turn, appreciates the fact that Volcarona can switch in on threats such as Gholdengo and stay healthy while being able to hit Steel-types with a strong Fiery Dance. Lokix can clean teams weakened by Ribombee thanks to its strong U-turn and First Impression while hitting Ghost-types such as Skeledirge and Gholdengo that pose large roadblocks for Bug teams and amplifying the effects of Sticky Web with Knock Off. In exchange, Lokix appreciates being able to outspeed common threats such as Choice Specs Flutter Mane under Sticky Web. Heracross can, in a similar vein to Slither Wing, deal with Steel-types such as Heatran and Kingambit while also using Knock Off to both remove key items from defensive behemoths such as Toxapex and increase the effects of Sticky Web on the opposing team. It appreciates Sticky Web to patch up its lackluster Speed.

In return, Garganacl benefits from Lycanroc-D's ability to remove wallbreakers such as Walking Wake and Urshifu-R which threaten Garganacl's Iron Defense + Body Press set. Tyranitar is an essential teammate as it sets up sand to further chip down walls and checks threats like Flutter Mane, Espathra, and Kingambit due to its sheer bulk and great coverage in Heavy Slam, Crunch, and Low Kick. Hisuian Arcanine's wallbreaking power covers walls that are harder for Lycanroc-D to take down, dealing with Toxapex and Corviknight with Head Smash and Flare Blitz, respectively. Kleavor is a great lead, as Stone Axe sets up Stealth Rock to break through any opposing Focus Sash, allowing Lycanroc-D and Hisuian Arcanine to clean teams more easily. It can also pivot into Lycanroc-D with U-turn, luring in foes like Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Heatran in the process.  Choice item Glimmora's colorful moveset helps against walls like Quagsire and Toxapex through the use of Energy Ball and Earth Power, with Choice Scarf allowing Glimmora to outspeed and take down fast offensive threats such as Iron Valiant and Greninja if they aren't running Choice Scarf. Coalossal removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, checks Scizor, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit with Flamethrower and Body Press, and can burn threats with Flame Body. Iron Defense + Calm Mind Diancie can check Garchomp with Moonblast. Shell Smash Air Balloon Drednaw provides a temporary Ground-type immunity and appreciates defensive walls being worn down by Lycanroc-D. In return, it readily cleans weakened Flying and Ground teams, eliminating threats like Landorus-T and Great Tusk.</p>"

Poison Jab puts pressure onto Grass- and Fairy-types like Hisuian Lilligant, Primarina, and Enamorus. Toxic forces bulkier foes such as Iron Hands and Gouging Fire on timers. Finally, Haze prevents the likes of Iron Defense Zamazenta and Swords Dance Hisuian Samurott from using Toxapex as a setup opportunity. Black Sludge allows Toxapex to stick around longer without requiring the usage of Recover, but Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to allow Toxapex safe entry in the face of entry hazards. The EV spread prevents a 2HKO from Meowscarada's Flower Trick and Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> <p>Ogerpon-W serves as a wonderful teammate, as it is neutral to Electric-type attacks, can lock Raging Bolt into a setup move with Encore, and threatens Ground-types that handle Toxapex such as Great Tusk and Sandy Shocks while appreciating Toxapex's Poison Jab removing Grass-types like Meowscarada and Hisuian Lilligant that otherwise wall it. Swampert is immune to Electric and can use Earthquake to check Poison- and Steel-types that wall Toxapex such as Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Gholdengo. Greninja can outspeed and remove Psychic-types such as Latios and Metagross and uses coverage such as Sludge Wave to deal with Grass-types Toxapex cannot handle such as the Ogerpon formes and Hydrapple or Ice Beam to break through Clodsire. Alternatively, Hisuian Samurott can be ran as the team's Dark-type, with Ceaseless Edge being a more reliable way of taking on Hoopa-U while setting up Spikes to wear down Toxapex's checks like Choice Specs Iron Moth. Keldeo and Urshifu-R provide solid ways to break Steel-types like Empoleon and Hisuian Goodra along with handling Kyurem. Primarina appreciates Toxapex absorbing Toxic Spikes and using Toxic to wear down targets such as Iron Hands and opposing Primarina, and in return, it can take on Dragon-types like Gouging Fire, Garchomp, and Roaring Moon.</p>"

Its Poison-type STAB moves enable Toxapex to take on threatening Grass- and Fairy-types such as Meowscarada, Hisuian Lilligant, Primarina, and Hatterene, with Poison Jab being preferred over other Poison-type STAB moves thanks to its ability to beat bulky Calm Mind users such as Primarina and Hatterene. Haze prevents setup from Skarmory and Zamazenta, forcing them to attack into Toxapex's Rocky Helmet and take chip damage. Toxic can be used to force bulkier foes such as Sinistcha and Iron Hands onto dangerous timers; alternatively, Toxic Spikes can be used to force immediate pressure onto targets such as the Ogerpon formes upon entry and punish teams without solid entry hazard removal like Dragon and Water. Heavy Duty-Boots prevents Toxapex from being worn down, so it can continually find safe entry into foes like Meowscarada and Iron Boulder. However, Rocky Helmet punishes the plethora of contact attackers such as Scizor and Kleavor, while Black Sludge racks up recovery over time, enabling Toxapex to stay in longer against threats like Gouging Fire.</p> <p>Swampert and Gastrodon make for an excellent defensive core, being able to take on many of the Electric-types that are tasked with removing Toxapex such as Raging Bolt, Magnezone, and Iron Hands and wear down Toxapex's checks like Kyurem with Stealth Rock support. Empoleon can similarly provide Stealth Rock support along with more reliably taking on the special Grass-types that Toxapex struggles against like Sinistcha and Hydrapple and being able to check Kyurem. Greninja provides a crucial Psychic immunity, threatens foes like Latios and Metagross, and uses its colorful coverage and blazing Speed tier to remove problematic offensive threats like the Ogerpon formes and Dragonite while apprecating Toxapex's ability to switch into faster physical targets like Meowscarada and Dragapult. Alternatively, Hisuian Samurott can take the role of the team's Dark-type attacker, being able to set up Spikes with Ceaseless Edge and more reliably remove targets like Hoopa-U and Gallade. Ogerpon-W is able to take on foes like Sandy Shocks and Rotom-W that check Toxapex otherwise while apprecating Toxapex's ability to wear down Grass-types that wall it such as Hydrapple. Keldeo and Urshifu-R are powerful wallbreakers that can handle Steel-types like Heatran, Hisuian Goodra, and Gholdengo that hardwall Toxapex otherwise. Primarina enjoys Toxapex being able to put targets like Ting-Lu and opposing Primarina onto timers while absorbing Poison-type moves from the likes of Sneasler and Alolan Muk, and in return, Primarina can take on powerful Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Garchomp that can overwhelm Toxapex.</p>"

Surf is an alternative to Chilling Water thanks to its higher damage output, which lets Toxapex threaten to OHKO threats like Hisuian Arcanine after minimal chip damage and is better off against threats that don't care for their attack being lowered, such as Moltres. Haze removes the buffs from sweepers, including Ceruledge, Mimikyu, and Kingambit. Toxapex has three notable options for its second support move: Toxic Spikes to complete Poison's entry hazard stacking core and puts teams on a timer; Baneful Bunker to allow Toxapex to scout opponents, poison contact attackers such as Chien-Pao, and heal with Black Sludge; and Infestation to trap opponents that don't threaten Toxapex such as Alolan Muk and Klefki. Infestation can also be ran as instead of a Water STAB move with Baneful Bunker or Toxic to trap and waste away the plentiful contact attackers.</p> <p>Alolan Muk serves as a great teammate for Toxapex, being a special tank able to take on many of the special Psychic- and Ghost-types that threaten Toxapex, like Espathra, Galarian Slowking, Flutter Mane, and Gholdengo. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky as Alolan Muk, can also deter Psychic- and Ghost-types, soft check physical Iron Valiant and check physical Dragapult thanks to Intimidate, and benefit much more from Toxic Spikes with Barb Barrage. Amoonguss is a second Regenerator physical wall with a neutrality to Ground and resistance to Electric able to combat many Pokemon that threaten Toxapex such as Great Tusk, Quagsire, Rotom-W and Regieleki. Clodsire is an Unaware special wall immune to Electric that checks attack threats like Regieleki and Magnezone along with special setup Pokemon like Volcarona and Hydreigon. Air Balloon Glimmora can support Toxapex by removing entry hazards from the field for non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets, being temporarily immune to Ground with Air Balloon, and using Corrosion Toxic to put threats Toxapex majorly dislikes such as opposing Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra and Heatran on timers. Corrosion Salazzle can also provide Corrosion Toxic support along with using Encore to mess up Pokemon that view Toxapex as a setup opportunity like Kingambit. Sneasler can also be used to punch holes through teams thanks to its powerful STAB Close Combat, which can KO threats like Iron Treads and Baxcalibur, while Toxapex can come in and absorb damage for Sneasler and wear foes down with Infestation and Toxic Spikes.</p>"

Liquidation is a strong STAB move capable of 2HKOing common entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Infestation helps trap and check Pokemon, such as Gouging Fire and Ceruledge, that would otherwise be problematic for Bug teams. Mirror Coat is used to take advantage of Araquanid's naturally good special bulk to OHKO threats such as Raging Bolt and Zapdos.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kleavor is a great teammate for Araquanid because it can deal with Fire- and Flying-types such as Ogerpon-H, Moltres, and Articuno. Kleavor's Stone Axe also synergizes nicely with Araquanid’s Sticky Web, as more entry hazards further help the sweepers and wallbreakers on the team while also breaking Ceruledge's Focus Sash, which would otherwise be a huge problem for Bug teams. Scizor is another great teammate for Araquanid, as Sticky Web enables it to set up with Swords Dance easier and also allows it to take out Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine. Volcarona also benefits from Sticky Web, as it outspeeds faster threats like Greninja and Iron Valiant at -1. Slither Wing and Lokix both appreciate Sticky Web, as it helps them revenge kill faster threats such as Gholdengo, Ogerpon-H, and Hisuian Arcanine. Forretress provides a strong physical wall on Bug teams, removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin, and is a slow pivot for Araquanid with Volt Switch to ensure its safe entry so it can repeatedly set up Sticky Web if needed.</p>"

Its naturally high Special Defense stat allows it to check threatening special attackers in Heatran and opposing Volcarona. Iron Defense allows Araquanid to boost alongside potent metagame setup sweepers and ignore their threat, such as Gouging Fire and Ceruledge, both of which prove troublesome to Bug-type teams. Infestation allows Araquanid to trap setup sweepers and bulkier Pokemon alike such as the aforementioned Gouging Fire and Quagsire, allowing it to freely boost with Iron Defense and take them on with Liquidation.</p> <p>Forretress provides a crucial type neutrality to Rock- and Flying-type attacks headed towards Araquanid while also removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. In return, Araquanid helps take on the aforementioned Fire-types such as Gouging Fire and Volcarona. Choice Scarf Kleavor is another teammate for Bug teams, as it threatens Fire- and Flying-type threats like Ogerpon-H, Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine, and Gyarados with its Rock-type STAB moves, while also threatening Heatran with Close Combat. Additionally, it can set Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, forming an entry-hazard stacking core with Spikes from Forretress. Volcarona and Frosmoth are both powerful setup sweepers, with the former assisting Bug-type teams by taking out troublesome Steel-types that are unfavorable for Araquanid and Kleavor, such as Skarmory and Corviknight. On the other hand, Frosmoth can reliably deal with Ground-type Pokemon that act as a stopgap to Volcarona's sweeping potential, such as Clodsire and offensive Garchomp, after a Quiver Dance boost. Additionally, Frosmoth gains a significant boost in its ability to take Electric-type attacks that threaten Araquanid from foes such as Raging Bolt and Iron Valiant, thanks to its ability Ice Scales. In return, Araquanid, as well as Kleavor, help deal with Heatran, which can render both Volcarona and Frosmoth useless. Lastly, Scizor is another setup sweeper that is appreciated by Araquanid, as it is capable of handling setup sweepers that can wall Araquanid, such as Dragapult and Primarina, with its Technician-boosted Bullet Punch in tandem with Swords Dance.</p>"

Flamethrower gives Salazzle some offensive pressure, letting it force out Steel-, Grass-, and Ice-type threats like Gholdengo, Brambleghast, and Alolan Sandslash. With Salazzle's high Speed, Encore can prevent threats like Sinistcha, Ursaluna-B, Okidogi, and Hydreigon from setting up, as well as lock Ogerpon formes into Swords Dance. Substitute paired with Black Sludge can allow Salazzle to accumulate Toxic damage on slower threats like Hisuian Goodra, along with finding repeated chances to safely set up Substitutes against foes that cannot break through them like Galarian Weezing and Amoonguss to effortlessly spread Toxic. Protect racks up Black Sludge healing and allows safe scouting against Choice-locked threats like Iron Valiant, Greninja, and Flutter Mane. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Salazzle to come in safely and land a Toxic.</p> <p>With Salazzle's crippling Ground-type weakness, Galarian Weezing serves as a crucial ally thanks to its Ground immunity, being able to safely switch in on threats like Great Tusk, Mamoswine, and Quagsire, and ability to remove Stealth Rock to give Salazzle safe entry. Amoonguss helps to force out pesky Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk, Gastrodon, and Ogerpon-W with Giga Drain and Foul Play. It can also use Spore to allow Salazzle safe entry to get up a free Substitute, while in return Amoonguss appreciates the removal of Steel-types like Gholdengo and Corviknight, which can use it as setup fodder. With its immense physical bulk and access to STAB Surf and Haze, Toxapex can deal with threats such as Scizor and Kleavor, while Salazzle limits foes like Articuno and Thundurus-T that majorly threaten Toxapex. Unaware Clodsire checks special setup sweepers like Kommo-o and Volcarona while also providing additional chip damage with Stealth Rock. Alolan Muk's superb special bulk and access to Knock Off and Poison Jab allow it to easily handle Ghost-type threats that force Salazzle out like Flutter Mane and Hisuian Zoroark. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky, can still serve as a solid Psychic- and Ghost-type response and works much better against threats like Gallade, Ceruledge, and Dragapult thanks to its high physical bulk and Intimidate. Galarian Slowking can create Future Sight traps to force in the team's opposing Dark-type or special walls like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra, which Salazzle can take advantage of by getting in safely to either land a Toxic or set up a Substitute. Galarian Slowking also helps Salazzle by dealing with deadly special attackers like Volcanion, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake. Okidogi majorly appreciates Salazzle's Toxic shutting down bulky walls like Skeledirge, Quagsire, and Galarian Weezing by putting them on timers, and in return Okidogi handles threats like Heatran, Garganacl, and Bisharp with Drain Punch. Sneasler can use U-turn to bring Salazzle in on walls like Amoonguss, Klefki, and Toxapex and use them as an opportunity to get up a Substitute or land a critical Toxic. Meanwhile, Sneasler removes threats like Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Kingambit. Choice Specs Icy Wind Gengar helps majorly in removing Gliscor, which can effortlessly switch into Salazzle thanks to Poison Heal. Thanks to STAB Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt, Gengar also helps in removing key threats like Landorus, Hatterene, and Dondozo, which majorly threaten Salazzle.</p>"

Minior is also appreciated on Rock teams as a Ground-immune Pokemon. Stone Edge at +2 is able to take out targets like Gouging Fire, Pelipper, and Landorus. Acrobatics after a Shell Smash + White Herb boost is a hard-hitting STAB move, which allows Minior to take out Sneasler, Iron Valiant, non-Iron Defense Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W. Earthquake deals with weakened Poison- and Steel-types like Toxapex, Alolan Muk, and Hisuian Goodra at +2. White Herb allows Minior to revert its negative stats back to neutral after a Shell Smash. It is also the easiest way to boost the Base Power of Acrobatics when compared to other items. Shields Down allows Minior to survive a Close Combat from Choice Scarf Great Tusk when above 50 of its HP, allowing it to be able to set up a Shell Smash afterwards; Minior also can't be statused when above 50 percent of its HP, which makes it very safe to set up against Toxapex or Clodsire.</p> <p>Swords Dance Ogerpon-C is an amazing teammate, being able to take out Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types like Primarina, Azumarill, Garganacl, and Ursaluna-B at +2. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine provides immediate wallbreaking power for Minior by being able to take out Corviknight and Skarmory with Flare Blitz. Alternatively, a defensive Hisuian Arcanine can handle the Steel matchup more effectively, notably taking out Scizor. Choice Scarf Iron Boulder outspeeds and takes out fast threats if Minior has not gotten the opportunity to set up, notably eliminating Greninja and Meowscarada with Close Combat. Furthermore, Minior complements Iron Boulder by weakening Zamazenta and Iron Hands, which allows Iron Boulder to pick them off with Zen Headbutt. Glimmora, with its coverage options, takes out a plethora of threats like Archaludon, Hatterene, and Quagsire. With Toxic Debris, Glimmora also sets Toxic Spikes upon being hit, putting foes on timers. Furthermore, Glimmora removes Stealth Rock for Minior while also poisoning non-Steel- and Poison-types with Mortal Spin. IronPress Garganacl is a great stallbreaker that can set up on passive Water and Steel teams and wearing them down over time with Salt Cure. Coalossal is a nice wall for Minior, removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin and checking threats like Scizor, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao with Flamethrower and Body Press.

Shadow Sneak lets Mimikyu revenge kill weakened offensive threats like Iron Moth and faster Ghost-type Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Shadow Claw lets Mimikyu break past bulkier Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gholdengo and Skeledirge more readily compared to Shadow Sneak, while Drain Punch is an alternative that threatens opposing Steel-types such as Magnezone and Kingambit. Mimikyu's preferred item is Life Orb to boost its damage output as much as possible.</p> <p>One of Mimikyu's best partners on Fairy teams is Klefki. Mimikyu appreciates Spikes from Klefki, which allows Mimikyu to take down Pokemon easier after a Swords Dance boost. In return, Mimikyu can block Rapid Spin, allowing Klefki's hazards to stay up during the course of the game. Flutter Mane is often paired with Mimikyu since it can threaten physically defensive pokemon that give Mimikyu a hard time like Amoonguss, Quagsire, and Forretress and also faster offensive threats like Iron Moth and Kilowattrel. Mimikyu is able to break through specially defensive Pokemon like Dragalge which gives Flutter Mane an easier time. Hatterene is also a good partner for Mimikyu, as it can bounce back debilitating status conditions like Will-O-Wisp from Sableye and Thunder Wave from Klefki and also bounces back hazards, which helps with Mimikyu's longevity since it runs Life Orb. Furthermore, Mimikyu with its Disguise up can check opposing Ghost-type Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Iron Valiant is also one of Mimikyu's best offensive teammates, as special sets are able to threaten other physically defensive Pokemon like Dondozo. Additionally, Iron Valiant is useful for Mimikyu in the Ground matchup, where a Choice Specs set can check answers to Mimikyu, such as Quagsire and Clodsire, using Psyshock.

Shadow Sneak picks off faster threats that could otherwise revenge kill Mimikyu, such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Drain Punch helps against Steel-types like Kingambit and offers some recovery—Disguise's recoil, entry hazards, and Life Orb damage can wear Mimikyu down pretty easily. Wood Hammer can potentially be used over Drain Punch to hit Pokemon such as Quagsire better, but the recoil damage isn't appreciated. Mimikyu's mediocre Attack forces it to use Life Orb to significantly damage neutral targets.</p> <p>All of Mimikyu's teammates appreciate its ability to take on Dark-type teams. Froslass and Brambleghast can place Spikes to help Mimikyu clean up and use Taunt or Rapid Spin, respectively, so opposing entry hazards don't wear it down. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane helps Mimikyu against both Dark- and Dragon-type teams by taking down faster threats that could KO it after Disguise has been removed, such as Meowscarada and Chien-Pao, which resist Shadow Sneak. Nasty Plot Gholdengo deals with bulkier teams like Ground and Poison teams, as well as absorbing Toxic from bulky walls such as Toxapex. Furthermore, Gholdengo can also run Trick with a Choice item, which can cripple annoying walls such as Quagsire and Dondozo to help Mimikyu deal with them. Polteageist can clean up Poison teams after Skuntank is KOed, as well as Ground, Water, and Fighting teams. Spiritomb can tank some Dark-type attacks so that Mimikyu needn't waste Disguise's protection. Skeledirge can take some hits from foes like Iron Valiant and Dragalge for the same benefit.

Clanging Scales is Kommo-o's best move for Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Gliscor. Furthermore, Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soul both trigger Throat Spray, enhancing Kommo-o's wallbreaking capabilities. Vacuum Wave notably picks off Chien-Pao without a Clangorous Soul boost, Meowscarada at +2 Special Attack, and hits other faster threats like Greninja and Mamoswine. Flamethrower threatens Steel- and Ice-type Pokemon such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Avalugg. Soundproof prevents Kommo-o from being hit by Clanging Scales from opposing Kommo-o as well as being phazed out by Piloswine and Empoleon's Roar.</p> <p>Hisuian Goodra is an excellent check for Fairy-types, as Kommo-o is effectively helpless against the type, fighting off Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Clefable as well as helping against Ice-types like Articuno and Alolan Ninetales. Dragapult threatens the aforementioned Flutter Mane with a Choice Specs, Choice Band, or Dragon Dance set and hinders and potentially removes offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant and Chien-Pao via Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp with a utility Hex set, helping Kommo-o set up easier in the Fighting and Dark matchups. Dragapult appreciates the removal of Steel-types and threats like Meowscarada, Urshifu, and Chien-Pao. Cyclizar's entry hazard removal is greatly valued, and it offers Kommo-o easy setup with Shed Tail. Garchomp enhances Kommo-o's wallbreaking with entry hazard stacking and also helps in the Poison and Steel matchups, weakening walls like Empoleon, Alolan Muk, and Toxapex for Kommo-o late-game. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon outpaces and removes Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Jirachi, Gholdengo, and Flutter Mane and revenge kills Fairy-types like Iron Valiant with Iron Head. Walking Wake is capable of outpacing and OHKOing Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur with its Choice Scarf set and heavily pressuring Steel and Poison team walls like Corviknight, Heatran, and Clodsire with a Choice Specs set, allowing Kommo-o to efficiently clean up late-game. Dragalge offers Toxic Spikes support and provides a check to Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane, and Enamorus. Dragonite threatens specially defensive foes like Empoleon, Clodsire, and Alolan Muk and in return appreciates Kommo-o's removal of Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Chien-Pao.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Kommo-o is a great wallbreaker for Dragon teams thanks to its incredible STAB combination, respectable Special Attack stat, and good STAB options. Aura Sphere is Kommo-o's Fighting-type STAB option on this set, hitting Steel-, Ice-, and Normal-types like Heatran, Archaludon, Alolan Sandslash, and Ursaluna-B that otherwise trouble Dragon teams. Clanging Scales punishes Fighting-immune foes, like Spectrier and Dragapult, that attempt to predict an Aura Sphere from Kommo-o. Vacuum Wave lets Kommo-o pick off massive threats to Dragon teams like Choice Band Chien-Pao, Choice Band Excadrill, and Kingambit. Flamethrower allows Kommo-o to threaten Gholdengo, which can otherwise wall it, very hard, while Flash Cannon provides coverage against miscellaneous Fairy-types like Clefable and Hatterene. Soundproof is the chosen ability in order to help against opposing Kommo-o as well as against Psychic Noise users like Hoopa-U.</p> <p>Both Archaludon and Hisuian Goodra help with Kommo-o's debilitating Fairy weakness by dealing with physical and special attackers respectively: Archaludon deals with threats like Azumarill that can use Kommo-o as a setup opportunity, while Hisuian Goodra can sponge attacks from the likes of Choice Scarf Flutter Mane, Choice Specs Iron Valiant, and Primarina. Archaludon also provides Stealth Rock support, a welcome tool to help Kommo-o break through and revenge kill foes. Both can handle opposing Dragon-types on their respective sides as well; Archaludon can cover against Dragon Dance Dragapult, while Hisuian Goodra can handle Latios. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon appreciates Kommo-o's ability to threaten Steel-types that can take it on like Skarmory, and in return it provides speed control and acts as a check to Psychic-types like Choice Scarf Hoopa-U and Galarian Slowking. Dragon Dance Dragapult can hit Ghost-types like Choice Specs Flutter Mane while appreciating Kommo-o's Dark resistance and ability to take on Kingambit. Gouging Fire can also take on miscellaneous Fairy-types, although to a lesser extent than the other two, and it can also set up and potentially sweep weakened teams once its answers, like Air Balloon Heatran, are taken out by Kommo-o. Both Latios and Latias are great teammates for Kommo-o, as they provide welcome speed control as well as help in the Psychic and Fighting matchups, two major struggles for Kommo-o. Latias also provides very helpful utility in the form of Healing Wish and Trick to render checks like Galarian Slowking much less potent.</p>"

It also provides great support with Grassy Terrain, both boosting its teammates' Grass-type STAB moves and granting them a form of recovery. Thanks to Grassy Glide, not only does Rillaboom dismantle walls like Empoleon and Garganacl with ease, but it also targets faster threats such as Iron Boulder, Flutter Mane, and Keldeo. Wood Hammer removes targets that Grassy Glide wouldn't fare well against like Toxapex and Gliscor. Knock Off grants coverage against Ghost-types like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Brambleghast and removes items from the likes of Corviknight and Dragonite. Alternatively, High Horsepower targets bulky Poison- and Steel-types such as Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Heatran. U-turn allows Rillaboom to pivot one of its teammates in safely while still dealing big damage to the likes of Meowscarada and Hydreigon. A Jolly nature allows Rillaboom to outspeed and threaten non-Choice Scarf Gholdengo and speed tie with unboosted Kingdra.</p> <p>Brambleghast aids Rillaboom's wallbreaking thanks to its Spikes wearing down incoming foes and Rapid Spin removing entry hazards so Rillaboom has more opportunities to switch in. Brambleghast is also able to switch in against an anticipated Hurricane, Blizzard, or Heat Wave thanks to its Wind Rider ability. Amoonguss makes for another great teammate, being able to immobilize a check to Rillaboom like Galarian Weezing or Sneasler with Spore and punish physical attackers that threaten Rillaboom such as Scizor with Foul Play. Rillaboom forms strong wallbreaking cores with special attackers like Sinistcha and Hydrapple. It checks Flutter Mane and Ting-Lu for them, and in return, Sinistcha handles Zamazenta as well as potentially spreading burns with Matcha Gotcha, while Hydrapple can set up and deal with Archaludon if it is not running Draco Meteor. Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-C remove foes that Rillaboom struggles with. Specifically, Ogerpon-H deals with Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Choice Specs Iron Crown, while Ogerpon-C handles Moltres and unboosted Volcarona. In return, Rillaboom deals with faster threats such as Choice Scarf Landorus and Greninja. Choice Scarf Meowscarada outspeeds and threatens speedy threats like Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, and thanks to Protean, it improves Grass's matchup against types like Dragon. Rillaboom's wallbreaking paves the way for opportunities for Hisuian Lilligant to clean late-game. .</p>"

        "description": "<p>Cinderace is a staple on Fire teams thanks to its incredible Speed tier and coverage, which allow it to take advantage of Libero to sweep effectively. With Choice Scarf, Cinderace outspeeds and OHKOes foes like Iron Valiant, non-Choice Scarf Greninja, and non-Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. Gunk Shot allows Cinderace to hit Fairy-types like Primarina and Azumarill, which resist Pyro Ball. Gunk Shot also secures an OHKO against threats like Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-W. High Jump Kick allows Cinderace to hit foes like non-Choice Scarf Greninja and Heatran, the latter of which being immune to both Pyro Ball and Gunk Shot. Additionally, using High Jump Kick removes Cinderace's weaknesses to Rock and Dark so it can handle threats from Ogerpon-C's Ivy Cudgel, Hisuian Arcanine's Head Smash, and Kingambit's Sucker Punch more easily. U-turn grants Cinderace the ability to act as a pivot on Fire teams, luring in its common checks like Landorus and Great Tusk.</p> <p>Teammates like Torkoal and Ninetales are ideal on sun teams, with the former setting and removing entry hazards with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively, and the latter supporting teams with Healing Wish. Furthermore, Ninetales can use Solar Beam under sun to take down annoying foes like Gastrodon and Great Tusk. Ogerpon-H is a great wallbreaking partner that provides aid against Water- and Ground-type threats like Dondozo, Swampert, Ursaluna, and Gliscor, which Cinderace may have difficulty breaking. Heatran is an inordinately good partner for Cinderace thanks to its neutrality to Rock and it can not only set up Stealth Rock to boost Cinderace's sweeping capabilities but also switch into predicted Ground-type attacks if it's holding an Air Balloon. Furthermore, it can trap foes like Toxapex and Clodsire with Magma Storm and damage them with Earth Power in tandem with Taunt to prevent them from recovering. Volcanion provides a much-needed Water immunity thanks to Water Absorb, in addition to dealing with Ground-type foes like Great Tusk, Landorus, and Gliscor if it is running Air Balloon. Talonflame is a splendid pivot with access to U-turn and a much-needed Ground immunity. Furthermore, it can also use Defog to remove hazards from the field and prevent chip damage to Cinderace while also taking out fast Fighting-type threats like Sneasler and Iron Valiant with priority Brave Bird thanks to Gale Wings. Gouging Fire is an impeccable setup sweeper on Fire teams that appreciates Cinderace pivoting it in with U-turn to effectively sweep opposing teams. Ceruledge is also a great example of a setup sweeper, breaking teams with +2 Poltergeist and Bitter Blade; however, foes like Porygon2 and Terapagos may cause trouble for it, in which case Cinderace can deal with them using High Jump Kick. Lastly, Volcarona is an amazing setup sweeper that complements Cinderace's sweeping potential by setting up with Quiver Dance and 2HKOing foes like Toxapex and Clodsire with Psychic. In return, Cinderace deals with Heatran, which can completely wall Volcarona.</p>"

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Cinderace is a great asset to Fire teams due to its mix of offensive presence and utility. Pyro Ball deals a lot of damage under sun and comes with the nice touch of not activating Libero. Libero-boosted High Jump Kick provides valuable coverage, hitting Archaludon, Hydreigon, and Garganacl. Low Kick is an alternative, letting Cinderace deal decent damage to most heavy foes such as Archaludon and Heatran without the large risk of High Jump Kick's crash damage. With minimal chip damage, Libero-boosted Sucker Punch OHKOes Choice Specs Dragapult and Latios that resist the combination of Pyro Ball and High Jump Kick and can also pick up KOs on weakened foes such as Flutter Mane. U-turn can be used as an option over either High Jump Kick or Sucker Punch, letting Cinderace keep momentum against foes it cannot threaten out like defensive Great Tusk and Garchomp. Lastly, Court Change gives Cinderace hazard control, helping the team stay healthy.</p> <p>Torkoal and Ninetales are natural teammates for Cinderace, as they provide sun to boost Cinderace's Pyro Ball damage and can help by removing entry hazards from the field and healing Cinderace with Healing Wish, respectively. In return, Cinderace can keep hazards off for Ninetales and Torkoal, letting them run Heat Rock to maximize sun's duration. Ogerpon-H, Gouging Fire, and Ceruledge all appreciate support from Cinderace, as it can keep hazards off their side, bolstering their sweeping potential, while they can break through defensive cores in the Flying and Dragon matchups, effortlessly disposing of Gliscor, Dragonite, opposing Gouging Fire, and Garchomp. Air Balloon Heatran is another great partner for Cinderace, as it deals with Toxapex, Choice Specs Flutter Mane, and Gouging Fire. Finally, both variants of Volcarona benefit from Court Change support. Defensive Volcarona checks IronPress Zamazenta and can spread burns against foes like Great Tusk and Clodsire with Will-O-Wisp to facilitate a late-game sweep from Cinderace, while offensive Volcarona can hit a wide array of targets such as Gastrodon, Hippowdon, Swampert, and Toxapex with the appropriate coverage in Giga Drain and Psychic.</p>"

Defog removes Stealth Rock so that its teammates that don't run Heavy-Duty Boots or had theirs removed have an easier time switching in. Defog also removes dual screens set by foes, allowing its wallbreaking teammates to remove various threats. Iron Head threatens Rock- and Ice-types that can threaten its teammates such as Iron Boulder, Ogerpon-C, and Alolan Ninetales. Body Press handles Rock- and Ice-types as well, and in addition, it handles Steel- and Dark-types such as Excadrill, Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Greninja. Alternatively, U-turn allows Corviknight to pivot out of bad matchups such as Fire- and Electric-types. Pressure allows it to punish Sableye using Encore. On the other hand, Mirror Armor can be used to punish attacks such as Bleakwind Storm from Tornadus-T and Moonblast from the likes of Iron Valiant and Enamorus. A Careful nature along with 252 HP EVs and 144 Special Defense EVs allow Corviknight to survive two Shadow Balls from Choice Specs Flutter Mane, and 12 Attack EVs let it OHKO back with Iron Head.</p> <p>Landorus appreciates Corviknight removing Stealth Rock, which would otherwise wear it down over time due to its lack of recovery. In return, Landorus takes out Fire-types such as Heatran, Ceruledge, and Hisuian Arcanine, and its Electric immunity eases that matchup, handling the likes of Raging Bolt and Magnezone. Skarmory is another beneficiary of Corviknight's removal of entry hazards, as it preserves Sturdy so it is able to set its own entry hazards. Articuno, with its great special bulk, takes on Water-types such as Choice Specs Greninja and Primarina and threaten them back with Freeze-Dry. In return, it appreciates Corviknight handling Rock-types. Choice Specs Zapdos and Choice Band Dragonite are two more offensive teammates that appreciate the removal of entry hazards, which would otherwise weaken them. Zapdos also appreciates Corviknight taking out Rock-types such as Ogerpon-C and Kleavor, while Dragonite appreciates the removal of Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene. In return, Zapdos handles Primarina, while Dragonite takes on Fire-types such as Ogerpon-H and Heatran. Choice Scarf Enamorus provides great speed control for Flying teams, outspeeding and threatening the likes of Dragapult and Choice Specs Iron Valiant. In return, Enamorus appreciates Corviknight taking on Steel- and Ice-types such as Excadrill, Empoleon, and Chien-Pao. Setup sweepers such as Double Dance Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Dragonite appreciate Corviknight walling and removing their threats so they can find opportunities to set up and sweep late-game.</p>"

      "Bulk Up (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Corviknight is an exceptional wincon for Steel teams due to its unmatched bulk and great dual typing, capable of easily snowballing Ground and Fighting teams. Body Press targets Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that resist Brave Bird or could take advantage of its recoil like Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Iron Treads, as well as capitalizes off of the Defense boost given by Bulk Up. Alternatively, Taunt prevents Ting-Lu from phazing Corviknight out with Whirlwind and breaks passive teams like Poison due to the prominence of Haze and recovery moves, while Substitute makes it harder to shut down once setup and stalls out Landorus-T's Smack Down. Leftovers provides much-needed recovery and is almost always the preferred item; however, Occa Berry + Body Press can surprise Heatran and Flamethrower Hydreigon. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 80 Def / 180 SpD with an Impish nature allows Corviknight to survive Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R after a Swords Dance, as well as prevents Zamazenta from breaking Substitute with Body Press.</p> <p>Heatran is a great teammate, as it switches into Fire-type moves from Iron Moth, Scovillain, and Moltres and traps and removes Toxapex so Corviknight doesn't need to use Taunt. In return, Corviknight provides an immunity to Ground-type attacks directed at Heatran as well as a Fighting-type neutrality. Gholdengo threatens out Skeledirge and Iron Valiant and takes advantage of walls like Toxapex, opposing Corviknight, and Klefki by setting up Nasty Plot freely. Kingambit checks Ghost-type threats such as Dragapult, Spectrier, and Flutter Mane, as well as heavily wears down teams so Corviknight can setup relatively easily and clean up late-game. Hisuian Goodra is a great specially defenisve tank, taking on Greninja, Basculegion-F, and Volcanion as well as opposing Heatran. Iron Treads offers an Electric-type immunity, handling threats such as Zapdos, Regieleki, and Sandy Shocks, as well as luring Landorus in for a potential KO with Ice Spinner.</p>"

Earthquake threatens Water Absorb Clodsire, Toxapex, and Kingambit, while Strong Jaw-boosted Crunch nails switch-ins such as Slowbro, Brambleghast, and Bronzong. Swift Swim is preferred to aid Rock in the matchup against Water rain teams; however, Strong Jaw allows Drednaw to muscle through the aforementioned roadblocks when using Crunch. Air Balloon improves Drednaw's performance in the Ground matchup, allowing for more setup opportunities, while White Herb retains Drednaw's defensive stats to have an improved chance against priority move users like Azumarill, Mimikyu, and Kingambit.</p> <p>Garganacl's ability to pressure Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Corviknight with Salt Cure is heavily appreciated, easing Drednaw's time sweeping.

Flame Body allows it to fish for burns to weaken physical threats like Kleavor, Scizor, Kingambit, Mimikyu, and Meowscarada. Body Press is a great move thanks to Coalossal's high Defense stat that allows it to deal incredible damage to Chien-Pao and Kingambit. Rapid Spin combined with Heavy-Duty Boots allows Coalossal to come in and remove hazards without taking any chip damage, so its teammates won't get worn down. Will-O-Wisp allows Coalossal to burn physical threats such as Kleavor, Hoopa-U, and Iron Hands. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 92 Def / 164 Spe allows Coalossal to outspeed and burn uninvested Kingambit with Will-O-Wisp.

Air Balloon Shell Smash Drednaw is another good teammate for Coalossal, providing a soft Ground-type immunity and dealing with Ground- and Steel- types like Landorus-T, Sandy Shocks, Iron Treads, Heatran, and Hisuian-Goodra. Choice Scarf Glimmora with its diverse moveset is another option to pair with Coalossal, as it can outspeed and threaten to OHKO non-Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant and Greninja. Glimmora can also deal with Water-, Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon- Types like Quagsire, Hisuian Liligant, Hisuian Samurott, and Hydreigon with its various coverage moves. Furthermore, Glimmora run Air Balloon to act as an alternative Ground-type immunity that can deal with threats like Quagsire and Great Tusk. Tyranitar sets sand for Coalossal to boosts its Special Defense, which can allow Coalossal to tank special attacks from Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Choice Specs Magnezone and threaten them in return. Choice Band Lycanroc-D is a good revenge killer that can help out Coalossal by taking out threats such as Enamorus and Cloyster with Accelerock and Urshifu-R and Clodsire with Psychic Fangs. Hisuian Arcanine is another good revenge killer with Extreme Speed and can act as a wallbreaker, taking out foes such as Toxapex and Clodsire with Head Smash and Flare Blitz, respectively. Kleavor is a good lead for Rock teams, as it can deal damage while setting up Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, which helps with hazard stacking. In return, Coalossal complements Kleavor by dealing with Scizor. Diancie can ease the Fighting match by dealing decent damage to Gallade and Iron Valiant with Moonblast and by being able to take Fighting-type moves due to its Fairy-typing.

In return, Barraskewda lures in aforementioned Grass-types like Amoonguss and Brambleghast and removes them with the corresponding coverage moves. Toxapex provides a Grass neutrality, notably walling Meowscarada and Ogerpon-W, and offers entry hazards to wear down Barraskewda checks, while Barraskewda removes Ground-types like Landorus, Gliscor, and Mamoswine for it. Empoleon sets up Stealth Rock to wear down Barraskewda's checks as well as walls Dragon-types like Walking Wake and Kommo-o lacking adequate Fighting-type coverage. Quaquaval offers entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin and switches into Steel-types like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit. Hisuian Samurott threatens Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon like Brambleghast, Slowbro, and Sinistcha while also providing utility support with Knock Off and Spikes set up via Ceaseless Edge. Urshifu-R is great in the Steel and Dark matchups, threatening Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Kingambit. Manaphy forms a wallbreaking core with Barraskewda in the Poison and Steel matchups, taking out Corviknight, Toxapex, and Amoonguss for Barraskewda, while Barraskweda hits Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk in return. Choice Scarf Walking Wake is great in the Dragon matchup, notably outpacing and removing Baxcalibur, Dragapult, and Kommo-o, while a Choice Specs set weakens walls like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Slowbro. Basculegion-F is a huge asset in the Ghost and Psychic matchups, taking out Sinistcha, Slowbro, and Brambleghast.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its good bulk, Calm Mind, Magic Bounce, and secondary Fairy typing, Hatterene serves as a strong wincon versus types such as Dark and Dragon that otherwise threaten Psychic-type teams. Psyshock is Hatterene’s hardest-hitting move against special walls such as Dragalge and Clodsire. Draining Kiss provides useful coverage against Dark- and Dragon-types and meaningful recovery. Mystical Fire hits Steel-types that otherwise stonewall Hatterene, while Nuzzle supports its teammates by spreading paralysis.

Because of this, Armarouge is a wonderful partner for Hatterene, as it can pressure the aforementioned Steel-types while also not having to worry about entry hazards due to Hatterene's Magic Bounce. Espathra forms a strong offensive core with Hatterene that can threaten a wide range of types such as Water, Dragon, and Ground once Hatterene breaks down Espathra's checks. This core can be enabled further by setting up dual screens with Scream Tail. Indeedee and Gallade ease pressure from Ghost- and Dark-types, respectively. The former's Psychic Surge can power up Hatterene's Psyshock, and the latter can check Steel-types for Hatterene thanks to its strong Fighting-type STAB attacks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hatterene is a near-essential Pokemon on Fairy teams thanks to Magic Bounce and its Psychic typing, only further bolstered by its wide setup and support coverage that allows it to remove Pokemon like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Chien-Pao. Magic Bounce is especially notable, as it is the only form of entry hazard denial for Fairy teams. Calm Mind turns Hatterene into a deadly sweeper, notably stopping unboosted Flutter Mane from OHKOing it, instead OHKOing Flutter Mane in return after a single boost with Psyshock and letting Hatterene overheal Ting-Lu's Earthquake with Draining Kiss. Psyshock also lets Hatterene break through Unaware Clodsire, Dragalge, and Assault Vest Iron Hands, whereas Psychic 2HKOes Amoonguss and Toxapex as well as generally hitting targets for more damage overall. Draining Kiss gives Hatterene much-needed recovery, allowing it to heal against neutral and super effective targets, notably Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu. It can even beat Heavy Slam Ting-Lu with Reflect support from Klefki and Grimmsnarl. Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types like Scizor, Pressure Corviknight, and Gholdengo, which would otherwise safely switch into Hatterene and force it out. Alternatively, Giga Drain allows Hatterene to surprise foes like Gastrodon and Quagsire with an OHKO and generally allows Hatterene to win the Ground- and rainless Water-type matchups alone with minimal support; it can even be used sometimes over Draining Kiss depending on the team's needs, although the amount of HP regained is substantially less. Nuzzle can be used over Mystical Fire or Giga Drain to better support the team via paralysis. The given EVs let Hatterene outspeed an uninvested Toxapex so it can attack before its Calm Mind boosts are removed by Haze, with the rest of the EVs put into Defense to maximize bulk. If preferred, however, 204 Special Attack EVs and a Modest nature can be used instead to have increased offensive potential, although at the cost of being more reliant on dual screens support; most notably, this lets Psyshock often OHKO Clodsire and Psychic always 2HKO both Unaware Clodsire and Quagsire. Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option over Leftovers as to more safely switch in when entry hazards are up, either from those that Hatterene could not block or simply was too pressured to switch into, although this does remove a large source of longevity.</p> <p>Dual screens support from Klefki and Grimmsnarl is almost essential, as it allows Hatterene to be much more aggressive with its Calm Mind boosts and switch-in opportunities. These teammates also provide extra support in Spikes from the former and both Taunt and Parting Shot from the latter, and in return, they can use Hatterene to block entry hazards from being set up, especially from Bombirdier and Ting-Lu. Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant can remove threats to Hatterene like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao as to facilitate setup opportunities for Hatterene, and they can rely on Hatterene to block hazards, especially Stealth Rock and Spikes. Tinkaton can neutralize Fairy- and Poison-type threats like Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, opposing Tinkaton, and Skuntank, which would otherwise impede on Hatterene's sweep, and set Stealth Rock and spread paralysis via Thunder Wave to ease sweeping opportunities further. Trick support from Iron Valiant and Gardevoir also helps Hatterene sweep, as this prevents bulkier Pokemon like Unaware Clodsire and Quagsire, Toxapex, and Dondozo from healing any damage taken and instead becoming setup fodder. Gardevoir also helps in the rain and sun matchups, as Trace copying Swift Swim and Chlorophyll removes the burden that Barraskewda, Floatzel, and Scovillain place by outspeeding and OHKOing all three. Azumarill and Mimikyu can support Hatterene as extra sweepers in order to overload the enemy's defensive core and majorly help in the Steel-type matchup that Hatterene dreads so much, notably pressuring Iron Treads, Kingambit, Corviknight, and Gholdengo.</p>"

Grimmsnarl's access to Parting Shot allows it to bring in a teammate immediately, but Taunt is also a viable option to prevent Defog and opposing leads setting up entry hazards. Thunder Wave also can be used as a form of speed control.

Substitute allows Frosmoth to take advantage of special attackers like those aforementioned as well as dodge status from Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing that cannot break Frosmoth's Substitute. Giga Drain allows Frosmoth to hit troublesome Water-types like Empoleon that can otherwise take it on while allowing it to run away with the Ground matchup by annihilating Quagsire and Mamoswine after a Quiver Dance boost. Ice Beam easily muscles past Ground-, Flying-, and Dragon-types like Gliscor, Dragonite, and Raging Bolt that otherwise pose problems for Bug teams. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Frosmoth to avoid its debilitating Stealth Rock weakness while giving it more opportunities to set up thanks to avoiding Toxic Spikes.</p> <p>Kleavor is a great teammate for Frosmoth, as it takes care of Fire-types that trouble Frosmoth like Ogerpon-H, Skeledirge, and Gouging Fire as well as setting up entry hazards through Stone Axe to soften defensive checks to Frosmoth such as Heatran.

Scizor ravages Rock- and Fairy-types that Frosmoth does not appreciate, like Garganacl, Iron Boulder, Flutter Mane, and Choice Band Iron Valiant, with its strong Bullet Punch. In return, it appreciates Frosmoth freezing checks to it like Quagsire and Skarmory. Volcarona melts Steel-types like Gholdengo and Corviknight that trouble Frosmoth, while Slither Wing takes out Heatran and Blissey, making both good teammates. Araquanid provides a pseudo-Fire resistance with Water Bubble and can deal with Fire-types like Heatran, Gouging Fire, and Volcarona.

Hurricane allows Frosmoth to sweep through Fighting teams after two Quiver Dance boosts while allowing it threaten Fire-types such as Volcarona. Substitute can be used instead to avoid status conditions and easily set up against more passive walls such as Amoonguss and Rotom-W. Giga Drain provides Frosmoth with longevity in sweeping, deals with bulky Water-types like Primarina and Gastrodon, and threatens troublesome Rock teams. Frosmoth's ability to deal large amounts of damage to physical walls like Garganacl and Skarmory is very important to ease the job of other setup sweepers like Weavile and Cloyster.

At +1, it is easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf Iron Boulder, Choice Scarf Roaring Moon, and Choice Scarf Sneasler, so switch-ins to these threats such as Avalugg and Mamoswine are appreciated. Speed control options such as Slush Rush Alolan Sandslash and Thunder Wave Froslass support Frosmoth excellently. Froslass provides Spikes support to chip down checks such as Hisuian Goodra and Galarian Slowking. Sandslash can deal with Hatterene and Articuno for Frosmoth while clearing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, should Frosmoth's Heavy-Duty Boots get Knocked Off. Frosmoth can struggle to break through Haze Toxapex and Articuno, so Kyurem and Weavile make excellent teammates.

Weavile is able to pressure the Fire-types Frosmoth can't break past such as Rotom-H and Heatran with Knock Off and Mamoswine's Stealth Rock support.

Combining Psychic Surge with Expanding Force allows Indeedee to take out threats like Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Dazzling Gleam lets Indeedee pressure Dark-, Fighting-, and Dragon-types like Choice Specs Greninja, Scrafty, and Hydreigon. Trick can punish common walls like Ting-Lu, Corviknight, and Empoleon, while Healing Wish provides support for the team.</p> <p>Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a nice teammate for Indeedee, being able to check Ghost-, Steel- and Psychic-types like Ceruledge, Archaludon, and Metagross. Hisuian Zoroark also provides help by using Trick to Choice-lock walls like Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Iron Hands. Indeedee returns the favor by taking out bulky foes like Clodsire and Toxapex and providing immunity against Sucker Punch Kingambit while the Psychic Terrain from its ability remains active. Ditto helps Indeedee as a late-game wincon by transforming into Chien-Pao, Garchomp, and Gouging Fire in the Dark, Dragon, and Fire matchups, respectively, reverse sweeping when possible. Smeargle is a nice entry hazard setter, providing Spikes and Sticky Web for Indeedee to slow down fast Choice Scarf users like Sneasler, Urshifu-R, and Roaring Moon. Calm Mind Ursaluna-B deals with specially defensive Pokemon that Indeedee can't break like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Tyranitar. In return, Indeedee takes out Iron Valiant and Urshifu-R without Choice Scarf for Ursaluna-B and Smeargle. Blissey is a nice teammate that can tank special hits from foes like Greninja and Flutter Mane while also setting Stealth Rock and spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave. Porygon2 is a good defensive wall that is able to tank hits from Ogerpon formes, Gouging Fire, and Ceruledge while also checking them with Foul Play. Porygon2 also pressures Flying-types like Corviknight, Dragonite, and Mandibuzz with Discharge and Ice Beam. Indeedee doesn't like hazards, so Braviary is a great option that can remove hazards with Defog while taking out foes like Lokix and Hisuian Samurott with Brave Bird and Close Combat, respectively. Terapagos is another option due to its colorful moveset, including BoltBeam coverage that can take out Skarmory, Garchomp, and Landorus, and it can also remove hazards for the team with Rapid Spin. Terapagos's signature move Tera Starstorm allows Terapagos to dent bulky Pokemon. Loaded Dice Cinccino can be a physical sweeper and hazard remover with Tidy Up. Cinccino also has great coverage, including moves that can deal with Ground-, Water-, Flying-, Dragon-, and Ice-types with Bullet Seed, Triple Axel, and Rock Blast.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Indeedee's exclusive access to Psychic Surge immediately gives it a niche on Psychic teams as a Terrain setter, and its solid support options, decent offenses, and immunity to Ghost ensure it isn't dead weight outside of that. Expanding Force effectively has 156 Base Power under Psychic Terrain before factoring in STAB, easily making up for Indeedee's middling Special Attack with its devastating strength. This makes Indeedee a brutally effective revenge killer, picking off most neutral targets, like the Ogerpon formes and Choice Specs Dragapult, after some chip damage. Dazzling Gleam is critical coverage for Dark-types that try to switch into Expanding Force, notably OHKOing Hydreigon, Lokix, and non-Choice Scarf Roaring Moon after Stealth Rock damage. Trick prevents Indeedee from becoming dead weight against teams with bulky special walls like Blissey, Alolan Muk, and Hisuian Goodra, letting it hinder them with an unwanted Choice item. Alternatively, Shadow Ball gives Indeedee an option to hit Gholdengo with, which can prove useful for Psychic teams, and it also hits opposing Psychic-types like Hatterene super effectively. However, a lack of Trick will make Indeedee far easier to handle with the aforementioned special walls. Finally, Healing Wish is an extremely powerful support tool that lets Indeedee give a dangerous teammate like Calm Mind Latios a second chance at sweeping. A Timid nature is required, since it lets Indeedee outspeed other common Choice Scarf users like Kleavor and Great Tusk.</p> <p>Steel-types are the bane of Indeedee's existence, since it lacks any kind of coverage for them, so having a fallback plan against them is essential. Slowbro is a great switch-in against Steel-type attackers like Excadrill and Heatran, resisting their STAB moves and threatening a powerful Body Press in return; its great physical bulk also helps the team play around other major threats like Tyranitar and Mamoswine. In return, Indeedee takes out Hydreigon for Slowbro. Hatterene doesn't fare as well against Steel-types defensively, but it can threaten them with Mystical Fire and give Indeedee's team a potent wincon that's made more threatening if Indeedee cripples a special wall like Alolan Muk with Trick; reflecting entry hazards with Magic Bounce also improves Indeedee's longevity and helps to chip foes into cleanup range. Swords Dance Iron Boulder is a terrifying setup sweeper that can plow through bulkier Pokemon that Indeedee struggles with, especially Blissey and Kingambit with Close Combat, and Psychic Terrain is incredible support for it, since it otherwise fears common priority moves. Choice Scarf Iron Boulder is also a great option to cover faster Choice Scarf users that Psychic struggles with like Meowscarada. Choice Band Hoopa-U is another physical wallbreaker that can deal with specially bulky Pokemon, notably OHKOing Kingambit and Gholdengo with Drain Punch and Knock Off. Indeedee returns the favor by taking out Choice Scarf Great Tusk and mixed Iron Valiant for Hoopa-U, and it becomes much harder to KO when shielded from Kingambit's Sucker Punch and other priority moves. Offensive Deoxys-S becomes incredibly threatening under Psychic Terrain, since it can use Expanding Force for its STAB move, making Choice Specs and Nasty Plot sets far more threatening. Latios doesn't directly benefit from Psychic Terrain, but it provides a useful Ground immunity for the team, and it enjoys the speed control and Ghost immunity Indeedee provides to help it against threats like Flutter Mane. Entry hazard support can greatly help to nudge foes into Indeedee's KO range, letting it clean up late-game more easily; Jirachi and Metagross are both decent Stealth Rock setters that can help with this, and Deoxys-S can provide even more hazards thanks to Spikes at the cost of defensive utility. The former two can also switch into common threats to Indeedee, like Scizor and Iron Boulder, and Jirachi can use them to generate momentum with U-turn and get Indeedee on the field more easily.</p>"

Furthermore, Infiltrator allows Dragapult to render dual screens useless, thus improving the Fairy matchup. Will-O-Wisp weakens common switch-ins to Dragapult like Iron Hands, Alolan Muk, and Hisuian Goodra, reducing their offensive capabilities. Hex takes advantage of Dragapult's great status spreading to deal high damage to afflicted foes. Draco Meteor can be run over Dragon Darts, both when Substitute is not being used and if it needs to handle Archaludon and Gouging Fire in a better way. However, Dragon Darts is preferred, since the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor is undesirable when run alongside Substitute. Substitute allows Dragapult to take advantage of passive walls such as Toxapex and Clodsire to spread status more safely. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can be used to target faster threats such as +1 Volcarona and Choice Scarf Sneasler. However, Substitute is the preferred option, since most foes that outspeed Dragapult can OHKO it outright, but Substitute must only be run with Leftovers as an item. 148 Special Attack EVs allow Dragapult to OHKO Flutter Mane with Hex after it is statused, while 108 Attack EVs further improve the power of Dragon Darts.</p> <p>Early-game wallbreakers such as Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Specs Latios appreciate Dragapult's status spreading, with Latios fearing less from Iron Hands's Ice Punch. Dragonite threatens Corviknight, Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Heatran, while Latios targets Toxapex and Iron Hands. Steel-type partners such as Archaludon and Hisuian Goodra can take hits from offensive threats to Dragapult, with Archaludon taking hits from Kingambit and Meowscarada and threatening back with Body Press, further helped by Stamina, as well as setting up Stealth Rock. Hisuian Goodra threatens a multitude of Fairy-types including Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane, and Enamorus. Raging Bolt handles Water-types that can cause Dragapult trouble such as Azumarill and Empoleon.

U-turn allows Dragapult to bring in one of its teammates safely into foes that check it like Swampert, Alolan Muk, and Ting-Lu. However, Thunderbolt is preferred, since it doesn't render Dragapult entirely helpless against Primarina and Azumarill.</p> <p>Archaludon provides Stealth Rock support and grants defensive coverage against Kingambit. Early-game wallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Hydreigon, Choice Specs Latios, and Choice Specs Kyurem make for excellent partners, as they remove Dragapult's checks so that it can easily clean up late-game. Hydreigon handles bulky Gouging Fire and Articuno, Latios threatens bulky Poison-types like Galarian Weezing and Clodsire, and Kyurem targets bulky Ground-types like Clodsire, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu, as well as Heatran. Gouging Fire's part-Fire typing allows it to matchup well against Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Clefable. Garchomp is a great partner, as it sets up Spikes to aid Dragapult's wallbreaking and cleaning, and it can potentially sweep late-game with Swords Dance and Scale Shot. Dragapult appreciates speed control from Choice Scarf users like Roaring Moon and Latias, as Roaring Moon threatens Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, Latias, and Gholdengo, while Latias not only outspeeds and threatens Choice Scarf Great Tusk and boosted Gouging Fire, but it can also give its Choice Scarf to a wall with Trick. In addition, it provides Healing Wish support for Dragapult. Dragapult's role as a wallbreaker is appreciated by setup sweepers like Raging Bolt and Dragonite, which benefit from the removal of Alolan Ninetales and Sableye so they can safely sweep late-game.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Dragon)": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Dragapult is an exceptional revenge killer due to its incredible Speed tier and ability to pressure opposing Dragon teams. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to threaten sweepers behind Substitute like opposing Dragapult as well as ignore Aurora Veil, dealing with Kyurem. Dragon Darts is Dragapult's most reliable Dragon type move, boasting a great Base Power and the ability to easily clean Dragon teams late-game. Phantom Force targets Ghost-types like Flutter Mane and Spectrier, removing them in a pinch. Alternatively, Shadow Ball may be used instead for a one-turn Ghost-type move; however, most foes need to be chipped down, as the move uses Dragapult's lower Special Attack stat, unlike Phantom Force. U-turn enables Dragapult as a fast pivot, allowing it to escape unfavorable situations as well as lure in Dark types like Hoopa-U and Meowscarada. Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp allow Dragapult to hinder offensive threats that its other moves don't threaten; the former slows down Choice Scarf Enamorus and Iron Valiant, while the latter weakens Kingambit. Fire Blast may be used as a substitute to threaten Steel- and Ice-types such as Skarmory, Alolan Sandslash, and Weavile. A Jolly nature grants Dragapult the ability to outpace other Choice Scarf users like Flutter Mane, Darkrai, and Spectrier, while a Hasty nature may be used should Shadow Ball or Fire Blast be opted for.</p> <p>Archaludon provides great physical bulk, taking on threats such as Dragonite, Gouging Fire, and Mimikyu as well as setting up Stealth Rock, enhancing Dragapult's revenge killing ability. In return, Dragapult offers a Fighting immunity, combating threats such as Sneasler and Keldeo. Gouging Fire threatens Steel-types like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Kingambit, while Dragapult removes faster Dragon types such as Latios and Roaring Moon for it. Latias and Latios scare away Poison-type walls like Okidogi, Toxapex, and Galarian Weezing as well as take on Ground types such as Great Tusk, Landorus, and Clodsire. Kyurem appreciates Dragapult's aforementioned Fighting immunity and ability to remove faster Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Latias. In exchange, Kyurem breaks walls like Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and Hippowdon as well as removes Archaludon once pivoted in by U-turn. Raging Bolt breaks Water- and Flying-type threats like Primarina, Corviknight, and Galarian Moltres. Additionally, Thunderclap allows Raging Bolt to remove faster threats such as Choice Scarf Enamorus, Greninja, and Barraskewda. Hisuian Goodra provides an answer to Ice- and Fairy- types like Kyurem, Articuno, and Hatterene and gives Knock Off support to ease Dragapult's cleaning late-game.</p>"

      "Hex (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Dragapult carries a plethora of utility options in its movepool to hinder the opposition. It leverages its high Speed to outspeed and threaten Zamazenta, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao with status for its teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots also enables Dragapult to switch in much more often. Will-O-Wisp weakens physical attackers that pose a threat to Ghost teams, such as Great Tusk, Urshifu-R, and Kingambit, while Thunder Wave disrupts faster opposition such as Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott, Ogerpon-H, and Zamazenta. Hex is also a great choice for beating Gliscor and other Pokemon affected by Dragapult spreading status. U-turn is another great form of support as it lets Dragapult, scout switches and bring in its teammates safely. Dragapult's ability, Infiltrator, also grants it the capability to hinder the likes of Substitute Zamazenta and Enamorus, and ignore dual screens set up by Klefki in the Fairy matchup. The given EV spread allows Dragapult to guarantee a 2HKO against Hatterene after recovery from Leftovers and always outspeed Zamazenta.</p> <p>Flutter Mane is the biggest beneficiary of Dragapult's services, as it can outspeed Choice Scarf users crippled by Thunder Wave or live a few physical attacks from foes burned by Will-O-Wisp such as Earthquake from Landorus-T and Dire Claw from Sneasler. Flutter Mane repays Dragapult by blasting through Dark-types that give Ghost teams trouble such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Darkrai, and, if using a Choice Scarf, Chien-Pao. Spectrier is another great teammate for taking advantage of the status spread by Dragapult by threatening to win games with Hex. Dragapult's status also allows Spectrier to freely run Substitute and Nasty Plot together without needing to run Will-O-Wisp. Dragapult also safely pivots both Flutter Mane and Spectrier in, which is useful as both are quite frail. Gholdengo is an excellent choice, as with a Hex set, it is able to use the status spread by Dragapult to great effect and enhance its power, while with a Choice Scarf, it can threaten Chien-Pao, poses a threat to Dragapult with its priority moves. Skeledirge is a good choice as well, as it can withstand hits and reply back with a boosting Torch Song while also posing a threat to Heatran with Earth Power. Skeledirge also threatens Ice-types such as Alolan Ninetales and Frosmoth. Hisuian Zoroark is a much appreciated Ghost immunity that can deceive opponents into thinking it may be Dragapult or its vulnerable teammates, then take advantage of that to unleash powerful attacks against opposing Spectrier and Ceruledge or cripple walls such as Toxapex and Empoleon with Knock Off. Substitute Sinistcha is another choice to take care of one of Ghost's biggest problems in Ursaluna-B. Dragapult's spreading of status also allows for Mimikyu and Ceruledge to set up much more easily to threaten Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Steel-types like Corviknight, respectively. Mimikyu is also a one-time check to Chien-Pao and Kingambit with Disguise, both of which greatly threaten Ghost teams. Brambleghast can set up Spikes, which can wear down the opposition quickly in conjunction with burns from Dragapult's Will-O-Wisp, while Gengar can set up Toxic Spikes, letting Dragapult and Spectrier use Hex much more often.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance gives Dragapult the ability to not just boost its fantastic Speed to new heights, allowing it to outspeed fast Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada and Roaring Moon, but also beef up its decent Attack stat. Dragon Darts is a reliable, hard-hitting Dragon-type STAB move that allows Dragapult to break Breloom's Focus Sash and Dragonite's Multiscale. Phantom Force is Dragapult's best choice for Ghost-tpye STAB move, as otherwise it is walled by any Fairy- or Steel-type, while Disable can disrupt Choice-locked Pokemon from potentially breaking its Substitute or attacking Dragapult in general. Substitute allows Dragapult to ease prediction and also adds a layer of protection against status moves, allowing it to set up on more passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Amoonguss. It also synergizes well with Disable, allowing Dragapult to set up with ease. Will-O-Wisp is another option over Disable to allow Clodsire and Quagsire to become setup bait, while also crippling Kingambit and Ting-Lu; however, Disable is more consistent. Leftovers allows Dragapult to use Substitute multiple times throughout a game and be more annoying overall with Disable, while Dragon Fang is a good choice to boost Dragon Darts.</p> <p>Skeledirge is a fantastic partner, as it can wall Fairy-types such as Choice Scarf Iron Valiant and Hatterene while also threatening foes like Kingambit that can easily take out Dragapult with their STAB priority moves. Gholdengo is another fantastic partner that can threaten Fairy-types like Klefki and Flutter Mane, if Gholdengo uses a Choice Scarf, and take care of physical walls such as opposing Skeledirge. Brambleghast is another good partner, as it can keep entry hazards off of the field, allowing Dragapult to come in multiple times, as well as providing Spikes support to soften up Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Iron Treads. Hisuian Zoroark provides the team with not just a Ghost immunity, but also can easily use Illusion to disguise itself as Dragapult and lure in foes that would normally threaten it, such as Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and opposing Dragapult, to open up for a potential Dragapult sweep. Flutter Mane is another great partner thanks to its ability to handle opposing Dragon-types such as Baxcalibur, Roaring Moon, and Walking Wake. It can also provide immediate speed control if need be to take care of other Choice Scarf users that could revenge kill Dragapult before it gets a Dragon Dance up. Mimikyu is an amazing wallbreaker that can either help wear down physical walls for Dragapult to clean up or can take advantage of Dragapult punching holes in the opponent's team to clean up itself. Mimikyu can also heavily threaten opposing Ghost-types for Dragapult like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo thanks to its STAB priority in Shadow Sneak. It also provides a one-time check to setup sweepers such as Chien-Pao and Kingambit thanks to its ability Disguise.</p>"

However, its lower accuracy makes it an inconsistent choice. Choice Band Zamazenta can also opt to run Play Rough to target Sableye, which typically can switch into Zamazenta's attacks safely.</p> <p><strong>Iron Defense</strong>: Crunch provides good coverage against Ghost-types such as Hisuian Zoroark and Dragapult that otherwise would be able to wall Zamazenta. However, Crunch is mostly useless against Ghost-types with recovery such as bulky Gholdengo and Skeledirge. Stone Edge is able to take care of Zapdos and Moltres, which can cripple Zamazenta otherwise with Static and Flame Body respectively, as well as other Flying-types such as Tornadus-T. An alternative EV spread of 212 HP / 56 Def / 240 Spe can be used to ensure that Quagsire's Earthquake will not break Zamazenta's Substitute while still outspeeding Barraskewda.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Zamazenta is a solid wallbreaker on Fighting teams since it is one of the fastest and strongest Pokemon in the tier, outspeeding swift offensive threats like Flutter Mane while utilizing its coverage to break a multitude of defensive Pokemon in the metagame. Heavy Slam is key to targeting opposing Fairy-type Pokemon like Hatterene and the aforementioned Flutter Mane. Ice Fang is able to OHKO specially defensive Gliscor, which Fighting teams have difficulty taking down. Moreover, it is also Zamazenta's best move to target the Landorus formes. Alternatively, Psychic Fangs allows Zamazenta to target opposing Poison-types, letting it OHKO Sneasler and Okidogi, as well as 2HKO mixed Toxapex and Galarian Weezing. Wild Charge is yet another coverage option that OHKOes Pelipper, has a chance to 2HKO Toxapex, and threatens various Flying-type Pokemon such as Articuno and Moltres. Finally, Crunch targets opposing Ghost-types such as Spectrier and Gholdengo. 8 HP EVs in conjunction with 32 Special Defense EVs prevent Zamazenta from being OHKOed by Choice Scarf Flutter Mane's Moonblast, allowing Zamazenta to revenge kill it with Heavy Slam.</p> <p>Choice Band Zamazenta appreciates Great Tusk's ability to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin so it is not chipped down over time by Spikes. Great Tusk is also able to assist Zamazenta by setting Stealth Rock so Zamazenta has an easier time securing OHKOs against Pokemon such as Gliscor. Choice Scarf Sneasler pairs well with Zamazenta due to its ability to dispatch opposing Fairy-type Pokemon like Enamorus and Azumarill. Sneasler can also use Switcheroo to disrupt defensive walls such as Toxapex by removing their items and locking them into a status move, allowing Zamazenta to eventually wear them down. Iron Valiant is a beneficial partner for Zamazenta, being able to threaten Sableye and Mandibuzz as well as other physical walls such as Toxapex and Gliscor, which can be useful depending on Zamazenta's choice of coverage moves. With a Choice Scarf, Iron Valiant can further threaten Dragapult and opposing Zamazenta, and cripple defensive walls with Trick. Assault Vest Iron Hands can act as a switch-in to opposing Fairy-type Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Flutter Mane and threaten them back with Heavy Slam. Iron Hands is also useful in handling opposing Flying-types like Corviknight, Articuno, and Gliscor thanks to its Electric and Ice coverage, and can further provide Zamazenta with a safe switch in thanks to Volt Switch. Kommo-o can block Gholdengo's Shadow Ball with Bulletproof and threaten it in return with Flamethrower, which is useful as this is a foe Zamazenta struggles to deal with. In return, Zamazenta can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and threaten them with Heavy Slam, which otherwise stop Kommo-o easily. Hisuian Lilligant pairs well with Zamazenta, taking on defensive Gliscor, Clodsire, and Dragonite with its Hustle-boosted Ice Spinner. It is also able to use its Grass-type STAB moves to threaten bulky Water-types that can switch into Zamazenta such as Dondozo and Azumarill. Gallade threatens opposing Poison-type Pokemon like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Amoonguss; in exchange, Gallade appreciates Zamazenta's ability to punish Landorus-T with Ice Fang. Okidogi, like Sneasler, can threaten Fairy-types like Azumarill, Primarina, and Iron Valiant. In addition, Okidogi's use of Taunt + Bulk Up can stallbreak Zamazenta's defensive checks like Toxapex and Corviknight. Urshifu-R is another excellent teammate to Zamazenta, with its Surging Strikes proving deadly to many of Zamazenta's most troublesome foes such as Gliscor, Ceruledge, and Volcarona.</p>"

      "Iron Defense": {
        "description": "<p>Zamazenta excels in matchups that Fighting typically struggles against, such as the Fighting mirror, Ground, and Fairy, since it is able to outspeed threats such as Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, set up Iron Defense on physical attackers, and punish more passive Pokemon. Substitute allows Zamazenta to take advantage of passive foes such as Gliscor, Clodsire, and Amoonguss that can't break its Substitute in one hit, allowing it to start setting up Iron Defense and preventing it from being hindered by status. Heavy Slam is important, as Zamazenta outspeeds big Fairy-type threats such as non-Choice Scarf Enamorus and Flutter Mane. Heavy Slam also prevents Zamazenta from being walled by Iron Valiant in the Fighting mirror matchup. 252 Speed EVs allow Zamazenta to outspeed Jolly Barraskewda outside of rain and Flutter Mane, while 248 HP EVs allow it to set up four Substitutes.</p> <p>Iron Hands, with its great special bulk paired with Assault Vest, complements Zamazenta's physical bulk well, being able to take hits from threatening Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene while also being a big help in the Flying matchup with its access to Ice Punch and Thunder Punch to hit Zapdos and Enamorus-T. Great Tusk provides great physical bulk alongside Zamazenta and is also able to bring wallbreaking potential, with access to Ice Spinner to hit Flying-types such as Gliscor and Headlong Rush to hit Poison-types such as Unaware Clodsire and Toxapex, which are both hindrances for Zamazenta. Great Tusk is also able to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin to prevent passive chip on Zamazenta while also running Knock Off to prevent Ghost-types from spinblocking. Iron Valiant provides the special offense Fighting desperately needs in order to break physical walls such as Dondozo and Slowbro that Zamazenta struggles against, and is also able to hit Ghost-types that can wall Zamazenta, such as Skeledirge and Sinistcha, with Shadow Ball. Iron Valiant can also run Trick to disable Toxapex and Clodsire and stop them from stalling out Zamazenta. Sneasler provides great coverage against Fairy-types, with Dire Claw being able to hit threats such as Enamorus. Additionally, Choice Scarf Sneasler outspeeds Choice Specs Flutter Mane while also being able to set up Toxic Spikes to cripple more defensive Pokemon such as Scream Tail. Sneasler also can run Switcheroo to hinder Toxapex and Clodsire, similarly to Iron Valiant. It also offers great pivot potential with U-turn, and can put Pokemon like Unaware Quagsire, which normally walls Zamazenta, on a timer when paired with Poison Touch. Hisuian Lilligant is a great setup threat with its access to Victory Dance and is able to threaten Flying- and Water-types such as Azumarill, Zapdos, and Toxapex with Ice Spinner and Leaf Blade at +1. Hisuian Lilligant also has access to Healing Wish as support for Zamazenta. Choice Band Galarian Zapdos is a great wallbreaker, 2HKOing Toxapex and Sinistcha. Another great wallbreaker is Urshifu-R, which helps with the Ghost matchup because it can deal with Gholdengo and Skeledirge if it is using a Choice Band or after a Swords Dance boost. Gallade is a niche Pokemon to use but helps with the Poison matchup that Zamazenta struggles with, thanks to its access to Sharpness-boosted Psycho Cut. It's also able to run Assault Vest to lure and remove Enamorus's Choice Scarf with Knock Off, which allows Zamazenta to use Heavy Slam against it. Assault Vest also lets Gallade deal with Quagsire and Toxapex instead of forcing a prediction.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Zamazenta zooms over the battlefield leaving everything in the dust barring Choice Scarf Dragapult and Swift Swim Barraskewda. Its incredible Speed, coupled with a potent Attack stat and a large offensive movepool, allows it to revenge kill common Choice Scarf Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Enamorus. Close Combat OHKOes Choice Scarf Greninja as well as Sand Rush Excadrill and can pick up KOs on weakened foes such as Swift Swim Kingdra and Scale Shot Garchomp. Heavy Slam punishes Fairy-type threats like Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus. Crunch 2HKOes Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Latios while OHKOing -1 Defense Ceruledge and Protean-boosted Psychic Greninja after Stealth Rock. The last slot aims to target specific threats to Zamazenta's team: Stone Edge crushes +1 Speed Volcarona and Moltres; Ice Fang pressures Gliscor, Landorus, and Dragonite; Wild Charge removes Pelipper and Gyarados; and Psychic Fangs OHKOes Sneasler and can break dual screens to ease the Fairy matchup. The EV spread maximizes Zamazenta's offensive prowesses while letting it survive one Moonblast from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane.</p> <p>By virtue of its revenge killer status, Choice Scarf Zamazenta highly values wallbreakers, such as Iron Valiant, Sneasler, Keldeo, and Urshifu-R. With access to BoltBeam coverage on top of already excellent dual STAB moves, Iron Valiant provides unparalleled offensive pressure in many key matchups, such as Flying, Water, Fighting, Steel, and Dragon by effortlessly removing many of their defensive and offensive Pokemon altogether, notably including Skarmory, Gliscor, Toxapex, Great Tusk, and Latios. Thanks to Zamazenta taking the Choice Scarf slot, Sneasler has more freedom to run either a Choice Band set or a Swords Dance Unburden set. Choice Band Sneasler can spread status through Dire Claw, OHKO Hatterene, and provide U-turn as well as Switcheroo to help facilitate Zamazenta, while Swords Dance Unburden Sneasler acts as a fearsome late-game cleaner in matchups like Fighting, Grass, and Fire. Keldeo and Urshifu-R both ease Ground and Steel matchups by targeting Hippowdon, Landorus, Corviknight, and defensive Gholdengo so that Zamazenta can finish the job later on. Surrounding Choice Scarf Zamazenta with defensive teammates is also strongly advised, including Great Tusk and Assault Vest Iron Hands. Assault Vest Iron Hands comes with incredible special bulk that helps it to withstand hits from Primarina and Tornadus-T and can slow pivot to Zamazenta. In return, Zamazenta can offensively deal with prominent Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane, hence preventing Iron Hands from being worn down. Great Tusk supports Zamazenta with its nice pool of utility options, such as Knock Off, Rapid Spin, and Stealth Rock, and can answer foes like Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, Toxapex, and Clodsire. Assault Vest Gallade is another premier partner for Choice Scarf Zamazenta, easily dismantling defensive cores in the Poison, Water, and Steel matchups while punishing numerous prominent threats such as Choice Specs Dragapult, Latios, Gholdengo, and Archaludon. Lastly, Bulk Up Okidogi can check IronPress Zamazenta and weaken the opposing team by spreading Toxic poison while removing Toxic Spikes.</p>"

Alternatively, Poison Jab can be used to pick off Ogerpon-W and Fairy-types like Primarina.</p> <p>Choice Specs Greninja and Urshifu-R form a devastating wallbreaking core, with Greninja being able to remove physical walls that hamper Urshifu-R such as Amoonguss, Skarmory, and Galarian Weezing with ease while Urshifu-R removes special walls that check Greninja such as Hisuian Goodra and Blissey. Greninja also provides a check to Psychic- and Ghost-type threats such as Latios and Sinistcha that could easily take Urshifu-R's attacks. Similarly, Swords Dance Hisuian Samurott can act as a check to Ghost- and Psychic-types along with providing Spikes with Ceaseless Edge and being able to use Sucker Punch to pick off faster targets like Choice Scarf Latias. Toxapex can handle Grass- and Fairy-types such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Hatterene and set Toxic Spikes to put bulky targets like Slowbro and Primarina on timers. Swampert can take on Electric-type threats such as Iron Hands, Sandy Shocks, and Regieleki. Swampert also provides support with Stealth Rock to wear down foes like Dragapult and Archaludon. Empoleon likewise can provide Stealth Rock support while dealing with threats such as Kyurem and Hatterene. Swampert and Empoleon can also both provide Urshifu-R safe entry with their slow Flip Turns. Pelipper provides rain, granting Urshifu-R the power boost to take out threats like Gholdengo, Zapdos, and Iron Valiant with Surging Strikes. Ogerpon-W appreciates Urshifu-R dealing with Tornadus-T and Lokix, and in return, Ogerpon-W can remove Water-types such as Primarina and Dondozo that would otherwise effortlessly wall Urshifu-R.

Swords Dance allows Urshifu-R to set up on a predicted switch. Surging Strikes is a generally powerful move that allows Urshifu-R to muscle past threats such as Bulk Up Corviknight and defensive Gholdengo after a Swords Dance. Close Combat hits Dark- and Steel-types such as Hydreigon and Hisuian Goodra that try to switch in on Surging Strikes, while Drain Punch is weaker but provides some much-appreciated recovery. Finally, Urshifu-R has many viable options for its 4th moveslot; Aqua Jet deters Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane from attempting to revenge kill Urshifu-R, Thunder Punch hits Flying-types such as Pelipper as well as heavily damaging Toxapex, and Ice Punch hits Water Absorb Clodsire, Garchomp, and Flying-types such as Zapdos and Dragonite. Zen Headbutt can be run to damage Amoonguss and do well against Poison teams. Punching Glove allows Urshifu to gain a small boost to its punching moves while being protected from Zapdos's Static and other contact-punishing abilities.</p> <p>Greninja and Hisuian Samurott are great teammates for Urshifu-R, as they take Psychic-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Indeedee's Psychic and Choice Band Hoopa-U's Zen Headbutt with impunity and punish them with Dark Pulse and Ceaseless Edge, respectively. Hisuian Samurott also sets Spikes to aid in Urshifu-R's wallbreaking efforts, while Greninja can threaten Fighting-types that Urshifu-R struggles with such as Choice Specs Iron Valiant and Sneasler with Extrasensory. In return, Urshifu-R can take Bug-type attacks such as Choice Band Scizor's U-turn and Choice Scarf Kleavor's X-Scissor, as well as threaten opposing Dark-types such as Chien-Pao. Pelipper provides rain support to augment Urshifu-R's already scary wallbreaking abilities as well as a Grass neutrality to take Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Flower Trick. Toxapex and Quagsire take Fairy- and Electric-type attacks, respectively, while both wearing attackers down with Toxic. Toxapex also removes Toxic Spikes, which can put Urshifu-R on a timer. Gastrodon is an alternative Electric immunity, sacrificing physical bulk for a better specially defensive profile. Rotom-W does well in the Water mirror matchup, as well as doing good damage to Toxapex with Volt Switch. Additionally, it can create setup opportunities for Urshifu-R by burning physical attackers such as Dragonite and Great Tusk thanks to Will-O-Wisp. Barraskewda provides a good source of speed control as well as respectable power, while Basculegion-F is a good special attacker that can blow through common Urshifu-R checks such as physically defensive Toxapex and Quagsire. Both of these appreciate Urshifu-R breaking through their checks: Bulk Up Corviknight for Barraskewda and Gastrodon for Basculegion-F.

Surging Strikes notably deals with Landorus-T, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk as well as threatening Bulk Up Corviknight and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Other options include Ice Punch to hit Amoonguss while also threatening Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Dragapult and Taunt to prevent Toxapex, Quagsire, and Water Absorb Clodsire from using recovery moves as well as Toxic and Haze. Heavy-Duty Boots improves the matchup against hazard stacking teams like Poison; however, Punching Glove is preferred to use Surging Strikes freely without activating Rocky Helmet chip or Static, easing the Flying matchup and minimizing the need for predictions.</p> <p>Great Tusk is an amazing teammate, providing Stealth Rock to enhance Urshifu-R's wallbreaking abilities and removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin if Urshifu-R isn't using Heavy-Duty Boots. Furthermore, Great Tusk deals with Toxapex if Urshifu-R isn't using coverage to hit it. Iron Hands provides a buffer in the Flying, Water, and Fairy matchup, threatening Corviknight, Pelipper, and Basculegion-F as well as hitting Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Iron Valiant with Heavy Slam. Furthermore, Assault Vest Iron Hands acts as a great pivot into special attacks, as Urshifu-R's Special Defense is rather lackluster. In return, Urshifu-R deals with the Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads along with Skeledirge. Sneasler is great in the Fairy matchup and provides pivoting and Toxic Spikes to accentuate Urshifu-R's wallbreaking potential. Zamazenta appreciates Urshifu-R heavily wearing down teams to allow it to easily clean up late-game with Iron Defense. Iron Valiant removes threats such as Hisuian Lilligant, Meowscarada, and Greninja while also being a huge asset in the Flying matchup thanks to Thunderbolt. Iron Valiant also values Urshifu-R's ability to break Clodsire and lure in Toxapex.</p>"

Power Whip is an excellent STAB move that allows Zarude to 2HKO Toxapex and Hatterene. Drain Punch grants Zarude a form of recovery while still 2HKOing Hisuian Goodra and Heatran, whereas Close Combat grants Zarude a stronger Fighting-type coverage. Alternatively, Jungle Healing allows Zarude access to longevity and removing its own status safely, as it forces many switches.</p> <p>Amoonguss is a great defensive partner for Zarude, as it is able to resist Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from Flutter Mane, Sneasler, and Iron Valiant, melt Toxic Spikes, and spread status for more offensive teammates with either Toxic or Spore. In return, Zarude can threaten the Psychic-types Amoonguss loses to, like Hatterene, Armarouge, and Iron Leaves. Choice Scarf Meowscarada makes for another good teammate, as it can outspeed and threaten Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Dragapult, and Hydreigon with Play Rough. In return, Zarude can handle the aforementioned Steel-types that Meowscarada struggles with, and the two of the form a strong U-turn core to complement their teammates. Hisuian Electrode and Rotom-C is a great addition on any Grass team, as thanks to its Speed tier and Electric typing, it can threaten slower Flying-types such as Corviknight and Enamorus as well as Water-types like Toxapex and Volcanion. Zarude's wallbreaking and support role enables sweepers like Hisuian Liligant to sweep Flying thanks to the latter's access to Ice Spinner as well as being able to clean Steel teams. Brambleghast and Toedscruel make for great teammates, as they can set up hazards to wear down incoming Pokemon for Zarude to break easier and remove them with Rapid Spin to enhance Zarude's pivoting ability. Toedscruel also has enough Special Defense to survive a Flamethrower from Choice Scarf Iron Moth and OHKO it back. On the other hand, Brambleghast's Ghost typing also allows it to spinblock, thus preserving hazards on the field, and thanks to its ability Wind Rider, it can switch into anticipated Flying-type attacks. Iron Leaves makes for another great partner, being able to provide Grass teams a positive matchup against Fighting and Poison teams. In return, Zarude can threaten the Ghost-types it struggles with, like Skeledirge and Gholdengo.</p>"

Volt Switch lets Regieleki punish foes like Amoonguss, Galarian Slowking, and Hisuian Goodra, which can take advantage of it, allowing teammates like Zapdos and Iron Hands to exploit them instead. Rapid Spin leverages Regieleki's capability to force opponents to bring in a Ground-type or risk significant damage, providing Electric teams with much-needed entry hazard control. Thunder Wave mitigates the threat of Hisuian Lilligant, Spectrier, and Zamazenta if Regieleki is unable to finish these off. Heavy-Duty Boots enhances Regieleki's ability to pivot and consistently remove entry hazards. Alternatively, 28 Atk EVs in conjunction with a Naive nature could be considered, and Magnet is recommended when using Regieleki with Wild Charge to secure an OHKO against Flutter Mane. Magnet also enables Regieleki to reach specific damage thresholds, such as OHKOing Iron Valiant with Thunderbolt. A Timid or Naive nature with maximum Speed EVs is needed to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Hisuian Zoroark.</p> <p>Given that Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Quagsire shut down Regieleki's antics, teammates like Nasty Plot Rotom-W, Swords Dance Iron Hands, and Substitute Zapdos that capitalize on these are crucial for its success. It's important to keep in mind that the player using Regieleki can also choose to double out when anticipating a Ground-type switch-in, allowing teammates to threaten these walls. In return, Regieleki eliminates Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao, which threaten its allies. Magnezone can equip an Assault Vest to check Choice Scarf users like Flutter Mane and Greninja, which zoom past Regieleki, and it can wear down Landorus-T and Quagsire as they repeatedly switch in. Sandy Shocks provides entry hazards to further wear down the opposing team, is bulky enough to bear a hit from and deal with Choice Scarf Sneasler, and puts pressure on Quagsire and Glimmora. Pawmot handles fast Ground-types like Landorus, applies pressure on Flying and Water teams with its Ice- and Grass-type coverage, and grants Regieleki a second chance at sweeping through Revival Blessing. Thundurus-T and Rotom-C are also appreciated, as Thundurus-T provides colorful coverage to deal with Poison- and Ground-types like Amoonguss and Great Tusk, while Rotom-C is able to greatly threaten the entirety of Water teams with its STAB moves.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Spectrier is a deadly special attacker that is able to quickly snowball against teams thanks to its high Speed, outrinning some of the metagame's fastest threats like Greninja and Iron Valiant. Spectrier utilizes Draining Kiss to hit Dark-type Pokemon that would otherwise resist its STAB Shadow Ball like the aforementioned Greninja as well as non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Roaring Moon. Draining Kiss also serves as a secondary recovery option to help heal off the damage taken by setting up a Substitute. Nasty Plot is used to elevate Spectrier's Special Attack to incredible heights without having to KO foes beforehand. Spectrier shines best when it is able to set up a Substitute, and subsequently a Nasty Plot, in the face of a more passive foe like Toxapex, then begin spamming its scarcely resisted Shadow Ball + Draining Kiss combination. Leftovers is used to provide more substantial recovery than Draining Kiss, but Colbur Berry is an option to take a Dark-type attack from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Chien-Pao, and Barraskewda. Will-O-Wisp should be used instead of Substitute if Colbur Berry is the item of choice, as it allows Spectrier to capitalize on surviving an attack from these extremely potent physical threats. If Will-O-Wisp is preferred over Substitute, Hex can also be used to deal more damage to burned threats.</p> <p>Skeledirge can switch into strong physical attacks from Pokemon that threaten Spectrier such as Choice Scarf Gallade, Scizor, Ceruledge, and Mimikyu lacking Shadow Claw, then scare them with Will-O-Wisp. Mimikyu is also a great teammate, as it can help Spectrier deal with Pokemon that may not go down to a single Draining Kiss, such as Ting-Lu, as well as Kingambit and Chien-Pao if Disguise is in tact. Mimikyu is also able to finish off threats such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak. Froslass and Brambleghast are teammates that work well with Spectrier, setting up Spikes for Spectrier to nab easier KOs and snowball with Grim Neigh. Froslass is also able to use Thunder Wave to slow down faster Pokemon, while Brambleghast is able to remove entry hazards via Rapid Spin, allowing Spectrier to pivot more freely. Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is a great teammate thanks to its incredible Speed and ablility to deal with common Choice Scarf users that give Spectrier trouble such as Gholdengo, Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk. STAB Moonblast can also damage or remove Dark-type Pokemon to make Spectrier's job easier. Finally, Hisuian Zoroark is a solid teammate due to its ability to switch into Ghost-type attacks that would otherwise threaten Spectrier and all of its other teammates. Hisuian Zoroark can also apply utility support by wearing down opposing teams with Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off. Dragapult is a great teammate, as it can burn and force damage on common walls like Quagsire, Clodsire, Alolan Muk and Ting-Lu, and forcing damage on them to make sweeping easier. It is also important to note that burned Quagsire and Clodsire cannot break Spectrier's Substitute in one hit, making setting up a lot easier. Finally, bulky Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a great teammate for Spectrier. Gholdengo can wear down Dark- and Poison-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Clodsire, which Spectrier struggle with, while Spectrier can help with faster threats like Dragon- and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Great Tusk.</p>"

Spectrier's combination of Calm Mind and Will-O-Wisp is notably important, as it allows Spectrier to be an annoyance to both physical and special attackers. Hex in conjunction with Will-O-Wisp deals immense damage versus threats like Corviknight, Toxapex, and Hisuian Goodra as well as takes advantage of Pokemon reliant on status ailments to function such as Poison Heal Gliscor and Guts Heracross. Substitute protects Spectrier from status ailments inflicted by passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Quagsire. Furthermore, Substitute provides more opportunities to set up Calm Mind boosts and denies the opponent of a chance to revenge kill Spectrier. The given EV spread allows Spectrier to outpace non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada, prevents Spectrier's Substitute from being broken by burned Assault Vest Iron Hands, and prevents Spectrier from being OHKOed by a burned Supreme Overlord Kingambit using Kowtwo Kleave with five fainted allies.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is incredibly valued as a teammate due to its ability to threaten Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Choice Scarf Greninja, Baxcalibur, Galarian Moltres, and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon as well as faster Ghost-types such as Swift Swim Basculegion, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. In return, Spectrier threatens special walls like Hisuian Goodra, Clodsire, and Gliscor. Focus Sash Ceruledge threatens special walls like Articuno and Heatran as well as takes on faster Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak, appreciating Spectrier's ability to burn walls. Air Balloon Gholdengo is a great asset in the Fairy and Ice matchups, beating Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Baxcalibur, and Alolan Ninetales as well as Ursaluna-B and Empoleon. Hex Dragapult spreads even more status ailments to set up Spectrier for success late-game and threatens Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Baxcalibur. Additionally, Choice Band Dragapult 2HKOes Alolan Muk with Dragon Darts, threatens opposing Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo with Sucker Punch, and OHKOes Hoopa-U with U-turn, also offering pivoting. Choice Scarf Dragapult also provides U-turn and can outpace Choice Scarf users like Roaring Moon and Walking Wake. Brambleghast and Froslass wear down defensive switch-ins such as Heatran, Ting-Lu, and Alolan Muk with Spikes, while Brambleghast also removes Toxic Spikes using Rapid Spin. Hisuian Zoroark offers a Ghost-type immunity and can spread burn with Will-O-Wisp, easing Spectrier's time setting up. Skeledirge checks Ogerpon-H, Choice Scarf Infernape, and Heatran using Earth Power and takes on setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Frosmoth while also outpacing Kingambit. Mimikyu checks Dark-types like Hoopa-U, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and Hydreigon while also offering a one-time check to Chien-Pao, Greninja, and Kingambit due to Disguise. Sinistcha beats Water-types like Barraskewda and Urshifu-R as well as Ground-types such as Ursaluna-B and Landorus. Gengar offers Toxic Spikes to accumulate chip damage via Spectrier's Substitute and enhance the power of Hex.</p>"

It also sets up Stealth Rock unconditionally, clearing up moveslots for the rest of the team. Close Combat serves a crucial role in allowing Kleavor to hit Steel-types like Heatran and Hisuian Goodra that would otherwise wall it. Night Slash provides utility in allowing Kleavor to hit Gholdengo, which otherwise also walls it, along with being able to hit other Ghost-types like Dragapult and Spectrier. Meanwhile, X-Scissor provides a strong secondary STAB move that can remove Bug-weak targets like Ogerpon-W, Hoopa-U, Chien-Pao, and Slowbro reliably. U-turn provides a solid pivot tool along with a Bug-type attack should Kleavor forgo X-Scissor.</p> <p>Ogerpon-C serves as an invaluable teammate, being able to threaten the Water-types that easily scare Kleavor out such as Toxapex, Swampert, and Keldeo. Glimmora provides incredible utility with Mortal Spin, which removes entry hazards, as well as its ability Toxic Debris, which helps to wear down threats that are weak to Toxic Spikes such as Iron Hands, the Ogerpon formes, and Great Tusk. Glimmora can also opt for Choice Specs, allowing it to remove physical walls like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Skarmory with minimal issue. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine can remove Steel-types that can wall Kleavor such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Gholdengo while also appreciating Kleavor's Stealth Rock chipping other threats down into OHKO range for Hisuian Arcanine's Rock-type STAB move such as Toxapex. Alternatively, Hisuian Arcanine can run a set with Substitute more reliably deal with threats like Kingambit, which prove problematic for Kleavor. Choice Band Iron Boulder, with its Psychic typing, can remove bulky Fighting- and Poison-types like Iron Hands, Okidogi, and Pecharunt that can otherwise easily set up on Kleavor. Iron Boulder can also serve as a devastating second Choice Scarf user, being able to outspeed threats like Meowscarada and Greninja and easily remove them. Tyranitar provides sand support, chipping targets down along with Thunder Wave to slow down opposing Choice Scarf threats such as Latias and Flutter Mane. Rhyperior, thanks to its immense physical bulk, can come in and remove troublesome targets like Gliscor, Iron Treads, and Sneasler.

Sharpness-boosted Stone Axe smashes common Flying- and Fire- types, such as Enamorus, Skeledirge, and Cinderace, while also setting up Stealth Rock in the same turn. Night Slash punishes Gholdengo, which resists all of Kleavor's other moves, though be wary that Kleavor can only 2HKO it even with Stealth Rock up. Aerial Ace is also an option to hit Great Tusk if it tries to switch in and remove entry hazards set by Kleavor. U-turn picks up momentum for the team and switches Kleavor out against foes such as Landorus-T, Iron Hands, and Azumarill. X-Scissor can be used to deal much more damage than U-turn thanks to being boosted by Sharpness, 2HKOing Amoonguss and Sableye. Close Combat helps Kleavor deal with Steel-types such as Kingambit and Heatran, though the latter requires chip damage to OHKO.</p> <p>All of Kleavor's teammates enjoy its ability to set up Stealth Rock while also dealing damage in the same turn. Volcarona and Frosmoth appreciate Kleavor's entry hazard support wearing down the opposing team and its ability to deal with Flying- and Fire-types, which enable them to set up and sweep late-game. In return, Volcarona can deal with Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo, while Frosmoth can deal with Ground- and Water-types such as Landorus-Th and Quagsire. Frosmoth is also a wincon against Flying- and Dragon-types when Stealth Rock is set up. Scizor acts as a sweeper that takes advantage of Kleavor weakening opposing teams, and it also forms a U-turn core that appreciates Kleavor's Fire neutrality with it. Additionally, Scizor can block Toxic from Clodsire and Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and threaten them with either Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch or setting up with Swords Dance. Lokix, Heracross, and Slither Wing also appreciate the opposing team being weakened by Kleavor, as well as the speed control Kleavor provides. This enables them to finish off foes by making use of priority moves and strong physical attacks, such as Lokix taking out Gholdengo with Sucker Punch or Throat Chop. Forretress provides great hazard control thanks to Rapid Spin, and it's also able to switch into strong physical attacks to scout thanks to its high physical defense and additional Steel typing that grants valuable neutralities that cover Kleavor's weaknesses.

Max HP is used to maximize Ursaluna's bulk, while the 4 Speed EVs are used to outspeed any uninvested Pokemon of the same Speed tier, such as Iron Hands and Alolan Muk.</p> <p>Ursaluna greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Ting-Lu and Quagsire, as the extra damage could be the difference between a 2HKO and a 1HKO on physically defensive Rotom-W. Ursaluna also appreciates a teammate like Clodsire, which can switch into Water- and Fighting-type attacks from Urshifu-R, Azumarill, and Sneasler, both of which Ursaluna is weak to. Another great teammate for Ursaluna is Landorus-T, which can U-turn and allow Ursaluna to come in freely and launch its extremely powerful attacks. Alternatively, Landorus-I is a fantastic teammate for Ursaluna. Ursaluna is able to deal with the special walls that check Landorus and vice versa. Iron Treads is another great teammate for Ursaluna, as it keeps hazards off the field in order to prevent Ursaluna from taking more damage. Bulkier Pokemon that want to stick around for a long time, such as Ting-Lu, Quagsire, and Clodsire, greatly appreciate Ursaluna's presence, as it can freely switch in to status moves and Knock Off once Flame Orb has activated. Finally, Choice Scarf Great Tusk is another teammate that appreciates Ursaluna. Great Tusk is able to outspeed and OHKO Pokemon that check Ursaluna such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Choice Specs Greninja. Once Ursaluna has sufficiently weakened the opposing team, Great Tusk will have an easy time finishing the game with its high speed and powerful attacks.</p>"

Shadow Ball provides good type coverage and is strong enough to OHKO opposing Ghost-types that Basculegion-F outspeeds under rain, such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Sinistcha. An already-strong Surf gets boosted even further by rain, notably 2HKOing Articuno and Archaludon to help immensely in the Flying- and Steel-type matchups, while Hydro Pump is an even stronger alternative that allows Basculegion-F to OHKO physically defensive Corviknight in rain at the cost of accuracy. Ice Beam complements the set by dealing major damage to Dragon- and Grass-types like Dragonite and Amoonguss as well as 2HKOing Water Absorb Clodsire.</p> <p>Pelipper is a must-have teammate for Basculegion-F, as its main draw is using the rain that Pelipper provides to become a terrifying wallbreaker that outspeeds most of the metagame. Pelipper also offers a slow pivoting opportunity thanks to U-turn, allowing Basculegion-F to enter the field safely due to its mediocre bulk. Swampert is another good teammate, as it offers a switch-in to menacing Electric-types like Iron Hands that can take an attack from Basculegion-F. Swampert also sets up Stealth Rock to aid Basculegion-F's wallbreaking efforts, letting it use Surf to hit the same damage thresholds as Hydro Pump without gambling on Hydro Pump's accuracy woes while offering a slow pivot opportunity thanks to Flip Turn. Keldeo threatens special walls and Dark-types like Hisuian Goodra, Blissey, and Kingambit that scare Basculegion-F away with its strong Secret Sword while appreciating Basculegion-F's ability to break through sturdy walls like Toxapex and Galarian Slowking. Toxapex and Tentacruel both set and absorb Toxic Spikes, allowing Basculegion-F to both wear down the very limited answers to it as well as keep its longevity intact once it hits the field. They also both check Ogerpon-W and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, two impediments to Basculegion-F. Barraskewda and Basculegion-F are great teammates, as they form a deadly offensive core that hits both physically and specially - Barraskewda can also use Flip Turn on walls like Toxapex and Archaludon for Basculegion-F to come in and wreak havoc. Hisuian Samurott functions as a temporary check to Kingambit thanks to Sacred Sword while also reliably setting hazards thanks to Ceaseless Edge in order for Basculegion-F to wear down some of its answers like Hisuian Goodra. Quaquaval is another option that clears hazards thanks to Rapid Spin while threatening the aforementioned Dark-types and special walls while being an excellent cleaner after Basculegion-F wears down its checks.</p>"

Gunk Shot is also beneficial by not being a contact move, preventing activation of Flame Body from the likes of Talonflame or Volcarona, or Static from Zapdos, each of which can stop Sneasler in its tracks. Upper Hand can provide anti-priority utility by stopping priority move use from Chien-Pao and Kingambit, as they may attempt to pick Sneasler off after using Close Combat. A Jolly nature allows Sneasler to outspeed targets like the Ogerpon formes prior to its Air Balloon popping, as well as Adamant Barraskewda in rain. Taunt can be used to stop bulkier threats, like Toxapex and Galarian Weezing, that attempt to handle Sneasler, denying their use of recovery and status moves.</p> <h4>Poison (Pivot)</h4> <p>Throat Chop can be used over Dire Claw, which provides Sneasler with an option to deal with Ghost-type threats such as Hisuian Zoroark and Froslass.</p>",

Close Combat, when boosted by a Choice Band, decimates Steel- and Dark-types, gaining OHKOs on threats like Archaludon and Ting-Lu and being able to 2HKO Skarmory and Gouging Fire. Dire Claw removes targets such as Primarina and Sinistcha with ease. Throat Chop removes Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios, Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Dragapult; alternatively, Switcheroo cripples walls such as Toxapex and Sableye, which could otherwise effortlessly handle Sneasler. Finally, U-turn gives Sneasler a solid pivot option.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking pairs excellently with Sneasler, being able to use Chilly Reception to safely pivot Sneasler in against threats such as Latios. It can also use Future Sight, which allows Sneasler to break past physical walls such as Toxapex and Great Tusk. In return, Sneasler can bust through special walls like Blissey and Hisuian Goodra that handle Galarian Slowking. Alolan Muk handles Ghost- and Psychic-types that would threaten Sneasler such as Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Galarian Slowking. Amoonguss can handle Water-type threats such as Dondozo and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R that would otherwise threaten Sneasler. Galarian Weezing provides a crucial Ground immunity thanks to Levitate, enabling it to take on threats such as Clodsire, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Galarian Weezing can also use Defog to remove entry hazards for Sneasler, preventing it from getting chipped down. Choice Specs Iron Moth can cleanly remove physically bulky threats such as Sinistcha and Okidogi along with handling threats such as Landorus, Gliscor, and Gholdengo. Pecharunt can come in on priority moves from the likes of Scizor and Hisuian Arcanine, threaten them with Foul Play, and then use Parting Shot to safely pivot Sneasler back in. Glimmora can check problematic Flying-types like Moltres and Tornadus-T along with being able to set Stealth Rock to wear down threats such as Gholdengo and Galarian Weezing. Overqwil can provides Spikes support as well as handle Iron Boulder.</p>"

Close Combat blasts through Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Iron Treads, and Hydreigon with ease. Dire Claw deals with the Ogerpon formes and Iron Valiant, and it has a small chance to inflict paralysis or sleep on would-be checks like Torkoal and Galarian Weezing. Gunk Shot may be preferred over Dire Claw for its ability to OHKO threats like Flutter Mane and Primarina while avoiding contact effects from its foe's abilities such as Zapdos's Static. Finally, Switcheroo can shut down physically bulky walls such as Skarmory and Toxapex, which would otherwise beat Sneasler. Alternatively, Throat Chop allows Sneasler to hit Ghost-type threats such as Dragapult, Spectrier, and Hisuian Zoroark, while Rock Slide removes targets like Volcarona and Iron Moth.</p> <p>With U-turn, Sneasler can easily pivot out to Alolan Muk to take on Psychic-type threats such as Espathra, Galarian Slowking, and Hatterene, which Sneasler cannot handle. Similarly, Overqwil can dispatch physical Psychic-type foes like Gallade and Iron Boulder while also providing Spikes, which can allow Sneasler to OHKO targets like Flutter Mane and Ursaluna. Amoonguss provides a solid check to Ground- and Water-type threats such as Great Tusk, Excadrill in sand, and Urshifu-R, which could otherwise handle Sneasler. Galarian Weezing provides a crucial immunity to Ground- and Dragon-type attacks that allows it to easily deal with foes like Hippowdon and Dragonite, use Defog to remove entry hazards, and enable Sneasler to come in safely. Toxapex can easily come in on priority users like Mimikyu, Scizor, and Hisuian Arcanine attempting to revenge kill Sneasler and handle them thanks to a combination of Rocky Helmet and Surf while also weakening Gouging Fire for an easy cleanup. Pecharunt and Galarian Slowking can provide Sneasler with safe entry by using their pivoting moves like Parting Shot and Chilly Reception, respectively. Pecharunt also provides support by being able to take on opposing physical walls such as Galarian Weezing and Araquanid. Galarian Slowking, meanwhile, can use Future Sight to cripple physical walls attempting to handle Sneasler such as Toxapex and Hippowdon. Glimmora can deal with Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos while setting Stealth Rock to help deal with threats such as Latios. Furthermore, Corrosion enables it to use Toxic to wear down targets such as Galarian Weezing and Corviknight, which otherwise wall Sneasler. Iron Moth provides a special attacking complement to Sneasler while being able to deal with physical walls such as Amoonguss and Skarmory. In return, Sneasler deals with special walls that cause Iron Moth trouble such as Blissey and Tyranitar.</p>"

      "Pivot (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>With a pair of Heavy-Duty Boots Sneasler can fill a unique role on Poison teams as an incredible offensive pivot, with its high Speed and Attack allowing it to handle targets such as the Ogerpon formes and Iron Treads with ease. U-turn combined with Heavy-Duty Boots will allow it to stay safe throughout the entire game by switching out against a threat to bring in a teammate that can deal with it; in addition, U-turn comes with a 30% chance to poison thanks to Poison Touch, which helps make progress by putting checks to it such as Quagsire and Mandibuzz on timers. Close Combat is a strong nuke against many of the tier's common threats like Hydreigon, Heatran, Kyurem, and Ursaluna. Dire Claw's incredible chance to inflict status allows it to not only slash through prominent Fairy- and Grass-types like Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and the Ogerpon formes but also make progress in matchups where its traits aren't as valuable like against Ghost teams by inflicting crippling statuses on targets like Hisuian Zoroark and Skeledirge. Finally, Fake Out can chip threats down and rack up poison damage or fish for poison before using U-turn to switch out.</p> <p>Alolan Muk handles the special Psychic- and Ghost-types attempting to remove Sneasler like Galarian Slowking, Flutter Mane, and Basculegion-F with its strong STAB Knock Off. Physically defensive Amoonguss can be brought in on many of the Ground- and Water-types that threaten Sneasler like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R. Galarian Weezing provides a safe answer to Dragon-types like Garchomp and Dragonite, along with providing Defog support, should Sneasler lose its Heavy-Duty Boots. Toxapex can deal with priority users attempting to pick off a weakened Sneasler such as Scizor and Hisuian Arcanine with its Rocky Helmet and Surf, along with being able to set Toxic Spikes to chip targets such as Hippowdon and Slowbro. Galarian Slowking provides a specially defensive complement to Sneasler by being able to handle threats such as Latios and Iron Moth while safely pivoting back and forth with itwith Chilly Reception; Its Future Sight combined with Sneasler's incredible Close Combat deals immense damage to any foe wishing to tank the hits for its team. Overqwil provides a switch-in against physical Psychic-types like Gallade and Iron Boulder and can set Spikes to wear down targets like Archaludon, which otherwise prove problematic for Sneasler. Glimmora provides support against Flying-types such as Gyarados and Tornadus-T, along with being able to use Corrosion Toxic to wear foes such as Skarmory and Pecharunt down, which would otherwise wall Sneasler. Glimmora also provides Stealth Rock to wear down targets like Gouging Fire and Rotom-W. Iron Moth provides a special attacking complement to Sneasler, as Iron Moth appreciates the removal of special walls such as Blissey and Tyranitar and, in return, can remove physical blockades that impair Sneasler such as Corviknight and Amoonguss.</p>"

      "Unburden (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>Unburden allows for Sneasler to become one of the fastest threats in the entire metagame, outrunning Choice Scarf users like Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Flutter Mane with ease. Air Balloon is the held item of choice, not only giving Sneasler a solid Ground immunity to threats like Gliscor and Clodsire, but also forcing them to choose between letting Sneasler set up with multiple uses of Swords Dance or popping Air Balloon so they can hit it with their powerful Ground-type STAB moves. Swords Dance's power boost is crucial in picking off physically bulky threats like Amoonguss, Hatterene, and Great Tusk. Close Combat is the STAB move of choice, hitting hard and breaking threats that attempt to take on Sneasler like Archaludon, Ursaluna-B, and Corviknight. Throat Chop hits Ghost- and Psychic-types attempting to absorb Sneasler's Close Combats, like Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Latias, hard. For Sneasler's last moveslot, Acrobatics can be used to make the most of Unburden with a strong move capable of breaking through threats like Gliscor and Zamazenta, which will attempt to stop Sneasler, while Dire Claw slices through bulky Fairy-types like Primarina, Hatterene, and Clefable.</p> <p>With Sneasler attempting to wallbreak as much as possible, entry hazards from the likes of Clodsire, Overqwil, and Glimmora can provide much needed chip damage against bulkier foes, like Toxapex and Skarmory, that may otherwise be able to take Sneasler on. Clodsire's Earthquakes can soften up walls like Toxapex and Forretress. Overqwil, with its solid offensive stats and part-Dark typing, can eat through Ghost- and Psychic-type threats, like Sableye, Ceruledge, and Metagross, that may attempt to stop Sneasler with their powerful priority moves. It can also weaken physical attackers with Intimidate, giving Sneasler an easier time setting up. Glimmora threatens bulky walls like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Skarmory with the threat of Corrosion Toxic, putting them on vital timers and making them unable to check Sneasler late-game. Galarian Weezing's immunity to Ground-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine makes it solid for wearing these threats down, and it's further capable of spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp to weaken physical attackers. Galarian Weezing also removes hazards with Defog to help Sneasler set up with as much health as possible. Amoonguss is able to handle strong threats with priority moves, such as Dragonite and Metagross, with Foul Play, which gives solid utility in picking these revenge killers off, and it is also able to put an opponent to sleep with Spore, giving Sneasler a free switch in and turns to set up Swords Dance. Pecharunt with Mean Look can trap physical walls like Skarmory, Galarian Weezing, and Toxapex and wear them down, making it a solid partner. Alolan Muk's strong STAB Knock Off can remove Ghost-types like Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Spectrier. Iron Moth's strong Fire-type STAB move can melt bulky Steel-types like Corviknight and Skarmory, which may otherwise attempt to boost their Defense with Iron Defense to stop Sneasler. Iron Moth also takes out Flying-types like Gyarados and Mandibuzz with Discharge, as they otherwise may try to stop Sneasler with their high bulk and Thunder Wave and Foul Play, respectively. Okidogi appreciates Sneasler blowing through teams and can clean up weakened teams that have few threats, such as Kingambit and Hisuian Arcanine, remaining. This also works in reverse, where Okidogi first punches holes through a team and removes threats like Hisuian Zoroark and Porygon2, leaving Sneasler to clean up the rest.</p>"

        "description": "<p>By virtue of its already great Speed tier further boosted by Choice Scarf, Sneasler makes for a great speedy threat on Fighting teams. Furthermore, a great ability in Poison Touch allows it to double as a potential status spreader. Dire Claw not only threatens Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Primarina but also makes a consistent way to spread status via its secondary effect alongside Sneasler's ability. U-turn allows Sneasler to bring in a teammate safely while also dealing great damage to Psychic-types like Hoopa-U and Latios. Switcheroo disables walls such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Archaludon, and thanks to Sneasler's Poison-typing, it doesn't need to fear obtaining Black Sludge from users like Alolan Muk and Toxapex. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used to target Fire- and Flying-types like Volcarona, Moltres, and Zapdos, which can possibly hinder Sneasler's offensive capabilities due to the former two running Flame Body and the latter running Static. Toxic Spikes improves on Sneasler's status spreading by inflicting incoming foes without protection with poison. However, Switcheroo is the preferred option due to its potential in neutering walls.</p> <p>Great Tusk is a universal teammate for Fighting teams, as it provides Stealth Rock support to wear down incoming foes as well as hazard removal with Rapid Spin so Sneasler doesn't get worn down by Spikes. In return, Sneasler handles Grass-types like the Ogerpon formes, Rillaboom, and Hydrapple. Iron Valiant threatens bulky Fighting-types like Great Tusk and non-Choice Band Zamazenta with Moonblast as well as a multitude of threats like Pecharunt, Okidogi, and defensive Gyarados with its coverage. It appreciates Sneasler taking out Fairy-types like opposing Iron Valiant, Primarina, and Enamorus in return. Breloom makes for a great partner, as it can immobilize a check to Sneasler like Corviknight and Great Tusk with Spore, and it threatens Ground-types Sneasler dislikes such as Excadrill, Clodsire, and Gliscor. Water-type partners like Keldeo and Urshifu-R not only threaten the aforementioned Ground-types, but they also threaten Fire-types such as Volcarona and Moltres when Sneasler chooses to forego Rock Slide. The two of them appreciate Sneasler's potential status spreading weakening checks like Sinistcha and Dragonite so they can be removed later on. Iron Defense Zamazenta easily takes advantage of physical setup sweepers like Swords Dance Excadrill and Swords Dance Iron Hands while boosting the power of its own Body Press, while Choice Band variants threaten Ground- and Flying-types such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Dragonite. Iron Hands, with its great bulk and coverage, handles Flying-, Water-, and Poison-types such as Tornadus-T, Barraskewda, and Clodsire. Lastly, late-game sweepers such as Hisuian Lilligant and Agility Gallade appreciate Sneasler's ability to threaten Fairy-types and wearing down walls with both its status and Switcheroo so that they can start their own sweeping.</p>"

Barb Barrage spreads poison and benefits from it immensely while also hitting hard against targets, including Ogerpon-H and Azumarill. It also deters Hatterene from coming in to block entry hazards. Spikes and Toxic Spikes provide immense utility to Poison teams, spreading damage and status with ease.</p> <p>With its pitiful Special Defense, Alolan Muk provides solid support to Overqwil, forming a dual Dark defensive core with Alolan Muk handling powerful special Ghost-type attackers like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo with ease, while Overqwil handles the physical threats.

Galarian Slowking provides solid support, being able to tank special attacks from the likes of Latios, Heatran, and Zapdos with ease and removing them easily with its myriad of coverage tools. Amoonguss complements Overqwil by being able to take on the Ground- and Water-types that Overqwil cannot handle like Great Tusk, Excadrill, Swampert, and Urshifu-R. Galarian Weezing provides a Ground immunity, making it capable of removing threats like Mamoswine, Garchomp, and Dragonite; it also provides hazard removal with Defog. Toxapex handles threats that Overqwil cannot like Chien-Pao, Scizor, and Barraskewda. Toxapex can also run Toxic Spikes, freeing up Overqwil's final moveslot for other utility options. Iron Moth can remove annoying Steel-types such as non-Choice Scarf Iron Treads, Forretress, and Corviknight that can easily wall Overqwil and remove its hazards. Moreover, Choice Specs Iron Moth can cleanly remove Landorus. Sneasler and Okidogi both remove annoying Steel- and Dark-types that can sit on Overqwil such as Heatran, Kingambit, and Hydreigon. Choice Scarf Sneasler can also remove terrifying special attacking beasts like Hoopa-U, Hisuian Goodra, and Darkrai without worry, and it enjoys Spikes chipping down threats that can withstand a Close Combat like Archaludon and Ursaluna-B. Okidogi, on the other hand, uses Overqwil's Intimidate to safely get in and set up with Bulk Up on physical attackers, including Ogerpon-C, Kingambit, and Iron Hands, before going on the offensive.</p>"

Superpower hits Steel-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Goodra, and Air Balloon Heatran, allowing Enamorus to snowball Steel teams with Contrary once Gholdengo has been removed.

Knock Off removes annoying items like Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots on the aforementioned Skarmory and Toxapex, allowing Meowscarada to freely spam Triple Axel and Flower Trick on Flying and Water teams, which at least 2HKOes any Pokemon on these types. Triple Axel is also able to OHKO all the Ogerpon formes and 2HKO Gouging Fire and Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage. Flower Trick OHKOes Primarina and ignores Reflect, which is helpful in the Fairy matchup. U-turn lets Meowscarada pivot out of checks like Archaludon, Porygon2, and Torkoal to bring in teammates such as Choice Specs Hydreigon and Hoopa-U that remove these threats.</p> <p>Choice Band Meowscarada gets outsped by Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant, thus being unable to deal with them. However, the lack of Speed can be remedied by pairing it with teammates like Choice Scarf Hoopa-U and Greninja, which can outspeed and remove these threats. Alternatively, Hoopa-U can use a Trick Room or a Choice Specs set to work with Meowscarada to pressure offensive teams like Fighting and Dragon or further batter down opposing defensive cores, as Hoopa-U is able to OHKO Archaludon, Toxapex, and Skarmory. In return, Meowscarada is able to 2HKO specially defensive Corviknight, which Hoopa-U and Greninja appreciate. Choice Specs Greninja and Hydreigon also fullfill these roles, with Greninja having the perk of being able to outspeed the Ogerpon formes and OHKO Moltres, while Hydreigon OHKOes Archaludon and is a Ground-immune teammate that is vital in the matchup against sand-based Ground teams. Kingambit appreciates Meowscarada removing its checks like Skarmory and in return provides priority in Sucker Punch. Entry hazards from Ting-Lu are appreciated, as Meowscarada needs Stealth Rock chip damage to be able to 2HKO Toxapex and Skarmory; Ting-Lu also functions as a defensive pivot against Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Enamorus. Hisuian Samurott is an alternative, as it is able to stack Spikes more efficiently against the opposing team and provides a Fire resistance that is helpful against Volcarona and Ceruledge. Alolan Muk provides a Fairy neutrality, which lets it come into Flutter Mane and Hatterene with ease, and in return, Meowscarada eviscerates Ground-types like Landorus that cause trouble for Alolan Muk. Sableye provides a Fighting immunity, which is helpful against Zamazenta and gives Meowscarada a switch-in to Body Press Skarmory.</p>"

Flower Trick hits threats like Greninja, Primarina, and Great Tusk. Flower Trick's 100% critical hit rate allows it to deal with set-up threats and foes behind dual screens such as Bulk Up Great Tusk and Belly Drum Azumarill. Knock Off OHKOes Psychic-type dual screen setters like Deoxys-S, non-Choice Scarf Dragapult, and other fast Ghost-type threats such as Hisuian Zoroark. Knock Off also allows Meowscarada to make progress against walls it can't beat such as Skarmory and Galarian Weezing by removing crucial held items such as Rocky Helmet and Black Sludge, respectively. Triple Axel removes Flying- and Ground-type threats such as Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and Dragonite. Finally, U-turn allows Meowscarada to benefit from its Speed stat and pivot of out threats such as Archaludon and Gouging Fire. It also heavily damages Pokemon like Hoopa-U and Latios.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu pair well with Meowscarada, as they set up entry hazards, while Meowscarada removes Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Zapdos, Volcarona, and Cinderace. They also take care of Fire-type foes such as Ceruledge and Torkoal. Greninja and Darkrai form an offensive core with Meowscarada; they serve as the special attackers for a team, removing threats like Okidogi, Garchomp, and Ogerpon-H, while Meowscarada serves as a physical attacker, removing foes such as Swampert, Hisuian Zoroark, and Flutter Mane. Alolan Muk serves as a special tank, providing a switch-in to attacks that threaten Dark teams such as Heatran's Fire-type STAB attacks and Hatterene's Draining kiss; it also spreads poison thanks to its ability. Sableye cripples Fighting-type foes such as Zamazenta and Iron Hands, which threaten Meowscarada, by burning them Will-O-Wisp. Galarian Moltres also assists Meowscarada by eliminating Fighting-type threats such as Urshifu-R and Sneasler. Mandibuzz helps Meowscarada by removing setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire with Foul Play, along with using Toxic to wear down Meowscarada's checks like Porygon2 and Garchomp. Hoopa-U removes physical walls such as Toxapex, Archaludon, Corviknight, and Skarmory, which trouble Meowscarada. Hydreigon improves Meowscarada's Dragon matchup by removing threats like Gouging Fire and Archaludon; in return, Meowscarada removes Dragon-types that trouble Hydreigon such as Latios and Dragonite.</p>"

This is further supported by a great Speed tier, which allows it to serve as a strong cleaner in multiple matchups such as versus Water, Fighting, Dark and Ghost teams with a Choice Scarf. Flower Trick enables Meowscarada to break through Defense boosted Pokemon such as Curse Dondozo, as well as Pokemon behind dual screens such as Flutter Mane. Play Rough provides the Fairy coverage that enables Meowscarada to threaten Fighting, Dragon, and Dark teams. U-turn is used to allow Meowscarada to pivot out against checks to it, such as Toxapex and Skeledirge, to bring in a teammate that can break through it, such as Breloom and Toedscruel, while also maintaining momentum.</p> <p>While Meowscarada is an effective cleaner, it cannot exactly break through certain Pokemon by itself. Choice Band Breloom is a great teammate for Meowscarada, as it can break through Meowscarada's checks such as Toxapex, Kingambit, and Clodsire. Meowscarada is also vulnerable to Pokemon with strong priority and revenge killers faster than it such as Breloom and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. Defensive walls such as Amoonguss and Wo-Chien can switch into said priority attacks and revenge killing attempts for Meowscarada. Amoonguss in particular also removes Toxic Spikes, which can be useful for Meowscarada and its teammates. Brambleghast and Toedscruel provide entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, while also setting up hazards of their own in Spikes. Abomasnow gives an important Ice neutrality to Grass teams, which in tandem with the Defense boost provided by Snow allows it to serve as an answer to Ice-type threats such as Weavile. Swords Dance Iron Leaves and Rotom-C provide counterplay to Corviknight that Grass teams otherwise lack, with the former appreciating Meowscarada pivoting out to it when facing Poison-types such as Dragalge and Toxapex, threatening Poison teams in general with its Psychic-type STAB moves and Fighting-type coverage attacks, while the latter forms a pivoting core with Meowscarada.</p>"

Both of these Ghost-types can spread status, and the former provides immediate wallbreaking power with Nasty Plot and a nearly unresisted STAB combination and the latter can punish physical attackers with Foul Play and provide a safe switch-in to teammates with Parting Shot. Ceruledge can provide the role of a Fire-type for the team, which, with its access to Swords Dance, can make for a powerful wallbreaker and setup sweeper.</p>",

Torch Song is an incredible STAB move option that pressures teams like Fairy, Steel, and Flying. Will-O-Wisp allows Skeledirge to punish physical attackers like Dragonite, Great Tusk, and Weavile, as well as chipping Clodsire and weakening Earthquake, making it easier for teammates like Gholdengo and Flutter Mane to overwhelm it. Earth Power provides great coverage and targets foes like Gouging Fire, physically defensive Toxapex, and non-Air Balloon Heatran, which resist or are immune to Torch Song. Hex, paired with Will-O-Wisp, provides a decent STAB move option, while Shadow Ball provides more reliable damage in the long run.</p> <p>Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Swords Dance Mimikyu are excellent partners that can eliminate Dark-types like Greninja, Hydreigon, and non-Choice Scarf Hoopa-U. Dragapult acts as a fast status spreader and can provide incredible wallbreaking power with its exceptional coverage and immense Speed when utilizing Choice Specs to eliminate walls like Dondozo and Toxapex. Furthermore, Flutter Mane and Dragapult can use a Choice Scarf set to revenge kill opposing Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada, Greninja, Roaring Moon, and Iron Boulder, with the latter also removing opposing Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. In return, Skeledirge can handle Steel-types like Corviknight and Skarmory for Mimikyu and Hisuian Goodra for Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Sinistcha boasts Water and Ground resistances, with which it can take on foes like Ogerpon-W, Dondozo, Great Tusk, and the Landorus formes. In return, Skeledirge can handle Fire-types like Gouging Fire, Volcarona, and Ogerpon-H. Hisuian Zoroark provides a Ghost immunity and, with its ability Illusion, can lure in and remove opposing Ghost-types and ruin walls like Blissey and Clodsire, which Skeledirge struggles against, by tricking them a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs. Gholdengo handles Rock-types like Iron Boulder and Ogerpon-C and provides safe switch-in against status moves like Toxic from Toxapex and Clodsire. With Air Balloon, Gholdengo can switch into Ground-type moves from foes like Great Tusk, Gliscor, and the Landorus formes aimed at Skeledirge, threatening them back with its boosted STAB moves.</p>"

With Will-O-Wisp and Unaware, it can check physical set-up sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragonite or Belly Drum Azumarill that threaten Fire. Additionally, Torch Song lets Skeledirge fire back against these threats while raising its Special Attack and reducing passitivity. Hex pairs incredibly well with Will-O-Wisp, as it threatens large amounts of damage on burned foes, while Shadow Ball is a more consistent STAB option that hits opposing Skeledirge for more immediate damage. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Skeledirge avoid entry hazards chipping away at it whenever it switches in.</p> <p>Volcarona is a great teammate for Skeledirge, as it can threaten Dark-types that annoy Skeledirge such as Ting-Lu and Kingambit. In return, Skeledirge can burn physical attackers, like Dragonite, giving Volcarona more setup opportunities. Paldean Tauros-F is also a good teammate, since it can threaten the aforementioned Dark-types with its Fighting-type STAB attacks while also having Intimidate to help neutralize physical attackers that Skeledirge cannot handle on its own, such as Roaring Moon. Additionally, its Choice Scarf set can outspeed and KO Greninja. Torkoal pairs well with Skeledirge due to its ability to both remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and set them up, all while also powering up Skeledirge's Torch Song. Cinderace is a fairly good partner as well due to High Jump Kick, letting it remove Dark-types aiming to threaten Skeledirge, while also being able to remove entry hazards with Court Change and hit Poison-types such as Clodsire and Toxapex with Zen Headbutt. Scovillain is a good partner, since it can remove Water-types such as Dondozo and Rotom-W with its Grass-type STAB attacks.

        "description": "<p>Quaquaval is a decent choice for Water teams thanks to its access to Rapid Spin to remove hazards for its teammates as well as a potential setup tool in Aqua Step in tandem with Moxie. Close Combat targets Dark- and Steel-types such as Hydreigon, Kingambit, and Hisuian Goodra. Alternatively, Brick Break hits the same targets while removing screens in the Grass, Fairy, and Ice matchups. Aqua Step potentially allows Quaquaval to sweep thanks to the Speed boost, getting the jump on the likes of the Ogerpon formes, Volcarona, and Flutter Mane after it is used once. Knock Off can be used to remove crucial items such as recovery items from Corviknight and Toxapex while also targeting Ghost-types that block Rapid Spin like Gholdengo and Dragapult. 164 Speed EVs allow Quaquaval to outpace non-Choice Scarf Flutter Mane after either an Aqua Step or Rapid Spin boost and OHKO it back with Aqua Step.</p> <p>Quaquaval appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Gastrodon and Swampert, and their Electric immunity makes them great against threats such as Regieleki, Raging Bolt, and Iron Hands. Toxapex aids Quaquaval in its potential sweeping by inflicting poison on threats such as Iron Valiant, Breloom, and Meowscarada. In return, Quaquaval deals with Ground-types such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Mamoswine. Early-game wallbreakers such as Greninja and Ogerpon-W pair well with Quaquaval, as they handle walls that it struggles with so it can set up late-game. Greninja notably handles Poison-types such as Toxapex, Water Absorb Clodsire, and Amoonguss with Protean-boosted Extrasensory, while Ogerpon-W threatens Dark- and Water-types like Hydreigon and Swampert with Play Rough and Horn Leech. Primarina makes for another great partner, as it serves as a potential wincon by challenging Dragon-types like Garchomp, Gouging Fire, and Latias with its great bulk and access to Calm Mind. Pelipper provides an immunity to Ground with its Flying typing, which allows it to take on Great Tusk and Grass-types such as Breloom, Meowscarada, and Ogerpon-H. Barraskewda serves as a late-game cleaner when boosted under rain, taking on a multitude of speedy threats like Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Iron Valiant, and Sneasler.</p>"

Its ability to scare out many common threats such as Espathra, Chien-Pao, and Dragapult is highly valuable. Lokix struggles to break past many physically defensive walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Corviknight; however, it can pivot in teammates—such as Vivillon and Volcarona—that can beat them. A Choice Band with an Adamant nature maximizes Lokix's damage output and can utilise Axe Kick to lure and defeat Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Alternatively, Life Orb avoids a Choice lock and makes use of Sucker Punch to pick off threats that First Impression alone cannot such as Gholdengo and Flutter Mane. Throat Chop lets Lokix deal good unresisted STAB damage and prevents Skeledirge from using Torch Song, which is extremely valuable and one of the reasons Lokix is a necessity for Bug teams.</p> <p>Lokix is highly susceptible to entry hazards and is often not quite strong enough to OHKO many Pokemon. Forretress is a great entry hazard remover and entry hazard setter, fixing both of those issues. Forretress also has a good defensive profile, acting as a sponge for absorbing damage, and it can even form a VoltTurn core with Lokix. Scizor removes Fairy-types that threaten Lokix such as Hatterene and Iron Valiant and allows Lokix to clean up after it has done enough damage. Volcarona takes care of Steel-types that don't fall to Axe Kick such as Corviknight and Scizor. Lokix can remove Ghost-types—such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane—to enable Slither Wing and Heracross, letting them spam their powerful Fighting-type moves and clean up after Lokix. Frosmoth can deal with many bulky Ground-types—such as Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu—and Vivillon improves the Fighting-type matchup by beating Great Tusk, Gallade, and Paldean Tauros-W and can answer Dondozo with the combination of Sleep Powder and Energy Ball. Masquerain can set up Sticky Web, which gives Lokix an amazing Speed advantage versus Iron Treads, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake, making Life Orb Lokix immensely threatening.</p>"

      "All-out Attacker (Electric)": {
        "description": "<p>Pawmot is a great wallbreaker on Electric teams, outspeeding foes like Garchomp, Landorus, and Sandy Shocks. Close Combat does not receive the benefits of Pawmot's ability and item, but it helps beat pesky foes like Ursaluna-B, Hisuian Goodra, and Baxcalibur, which are immune to or resist its Electric-type attacks. Close Combat is also a good move to beat foes like Ting-Lu and Kingambit which Pawmot's teammates might struggle against. Thunder Punch is an alternative STAB move, as it hits common walls like Corviknight and Toxapex while also threatening Pelipper on rain teams, thus preventing the opponent from setting up rain for Barraskewda repeatedly. Thunder Punch also helps versus Belly Drum Azumarill, preventing it from setting up. Mach Punch is Pawmot's preferred second STAB move, as it offers strong priority, securing an OHKO on foes like Chien-Pao, Meowscarada, and Greninja after a single layer of Spikes. Mach Punch also nullifies Kingambit's Sucker Punch by outspeeding it with priority. Revival Blessing is another alternative that can be used over Mach Punch, as it offers a unique and valuable type of utility by allowing a teammate to be revived. This may prove to be a huge benefit in some matchups like the Electric mirror, where Pawmot can revive teammates like Sandy Shocks after the opposing Rotom-W is low on HP or has already fainted. Ice Punch hits foes like the Landorus formes, Gliscor, Clodsire, and mixed Amoonguss. The last coverage move is Seed Bomb, as it hits Pokemon like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Rotom-W, which can prove troublesome for Pawmot's teammates to break. Seed Bomb also compounds with Thunder Punch to hit every Water-type in the game for super effective damage, making Pawmot incredibly powerful in the Water matchup. Punching Glove helps Pawmot avoid chip damage from Rocky Helmet on foes like Rough Skin Garchomp while also avoiding status effects like burn from foes like Flame Body Volcarona, Moltres, and Talonflame.</p> <p>Pawmot greatly benefits from teammates like Regieleki, which can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards for Pawmot and pivot well into other teammates with the help of Volt Switch. Regieleki's extremely high Speed tier also allows it to revenge kill foes like Enamorus, weakened Walking Wake, and, if using Magnet and Wild Charge, Flutter Mane. In return, Regieleki appreciates Pawmot dealing with Ground-type Pokemon, like Quagsire and Gliscor, with the help of Seed Bomb and Ice Punch due to Regieleki's lack of coverage moves. Iron Hands is another great teammate, as it allows Pawmot to run alternative sets, like Thunder Punch over Fighting-type STAB moves, since Iron Hands can run these moves in its stead. Assault Vest Iron Hands also has immense bulk and acts like a sponge for special attacks from foes like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Volcarona, which can cause great problems for Pawmot, since it is relatively frail. Iron Hands can also slow pivot into Pawmot with the help of Volt Switch. In return, Pawmot deals with walls like Quagsire and offensive Rotom-W, which Iron Hands may face difficulty in breaking. Sandy Shocks sets hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes to boost Pawmot's wallbreaking potential by providing necessary chip on foes while also being able to provide a Ground immunity thanks to Air Balloon, thus behaving like a switch-in against foes like opposing Sandy Shocks, Choice Scarf Iron Treads, Gholdengo, and Skeledirge. In exchange, Pawmot helps break foes like the Landorus formes and Gliscor that wall Sandy Shocks completely. Pawmot also threatens foes like Baxcalibur, Dragonite, mixed Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowking, which can cause problems for Sandy Shocks. Rotom-W is an essential teammate for Pawmot, as it provides a much-needed Ground immunity while also offering great utility with its defensive sets that run Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Hydro Pump on Rotom-W deals with pesky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Mamoswine, which Pawmot struggles against. Defensive Rotom-W benefits from Pawmot's ability to take down foes like Water Absorb Clodsire and Gastrodon. Thus, together they form a strong core on Electric-type teams. Teammates like Thundurus, Thundurus-T and Zapdos provide a Ground immunity for Pawmot while also threatening strong Fighting-type foes like Zamazenta and Great Tusk. Zapdos can break these physically bulky Pokemon with the help of Hurricane, while Thundurus-T can use Psychic as a coverage move for Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and physically defensive Amoonguss. In return, they appreciate Pawmot's ability to break specially defensive walls that hinder Zapdos and Thundurus-T's wallbreaking capability. Thundurus provides great support with Prankster Thunder Wave, paralyzing fast foes like Dragapult and Flutter Mane and allowing Pawmot to outspeed them. Magnezone pairs well with Pawmot, as it can act like a sponge for Fairy-type moves from foes like Hatterene, Iron Valiant, and Flutter Mane and force them out with Flash Cannon. In return, Pawmot helps to break special walls like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire, which Magnezone can't break.</p>"

With Revival Blessing, Pawmot can give second chances to fallen offensive Pokemon such as Iron Hands and Choice Specs Zapdos to punch holes in opposing teams. Double Shock allows Pawmot to OHKO threats such as Flutter Mane and Azumarill as well as finishing off Iron Valiant, but this comes with the downside of Pawmot immediately being forced out after using the move. Ice Punch allows Pawmot to deal decent damage to Ground-types that resist both its STAB moves, notably OHKOing both Landorus formes as well as 2HKOing both Iron Leaves and Clodsire. Volt Switch allows Pawmot to pivot out of a check such as Amoonguss into one of its teammates to deal with it. Play Rough and Seed Bomb are usable alternatives, with Play Rough being able to 2HKO Sableye while still hitting Dragon-types and Seed Bomb dealing with Water/Ground types that most Electric-type Pokemon cannot handle efficiently. Notably, Seed Bomb OHKOes specially defensive Gastrodon and 2HKOes physically defensive Quagsire. Grass Knot can also be used, being able to 2HKO Quagsire as well as Great Tusk.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks provides great hazard support to wear down incoming foes for Pawmot to take advantage of. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Zapdos and Rotom-W are appreciated by Pawmot, being able to switch into an anticipated Ground-type attack from the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Zapdos can also threaten Grass-types such as Amoonguss, while Rotom-W together with Pawmot can overwhelm Quagsire. In return, Pawmot can revive one of them so it can continue checking Ground-types when needed. Regieleki provides hazard removal and a fast pivot for Electric teams, and in return it appreciates Ground-types being lured in and removed by Seed Bomb Pawmot variants. Assault Vest Iron Hands is another great teammate, being able to switch into attacks that could OHKO Pawmot such as Dragapult's Draco Meteor and Enamorus's Moonblast. Iron Hands can also OHKO the latter when running Heavy Slam. In return, Pawmot can run Seed Bomb to handle Water/Ground types Iron Hands cannot efficiently threaten such as Quagsire, and Swords Dance variants of Iron Hands appreciate it removing Flutter Mane and wearing down Sableye. Magnezone is a great partner, being able to threaten the Fairy-types that can threaten Pawmot such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane.</p>"

At +1 Attack, Population Bomb becomes a fierce move, taking out a plethora of threats not running Rocky Helmet, notably Toxapex and Gouging Fire. Bite allows Maushold to threaten Ghost-types like Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark at +1, while Encore lets Maushold lock foes into moves such as locking Corviknight into Defog and Kingambit into Sucker Punch; this allows Maushold to get a potential Tidy Up turn. Low Kick can be run over Encore to hit pesky Steel- and Rock-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Goodra, Heatran, and Tyranitar. Play Rough threatens Dark- and Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Sableye on a switch in, and unboosted Roaring Moon, but running it leaves Maushold vulnerable to Kingambit. Wide Lens is the best item for Maushold to ensure Population Bomb is accurate as possible.</p> <p>Hisuian Zoroark is a great teammate for Maushold, providing a Fighting immunity while also fooling its foes due to Illusion. It also takes out physically bulky Pokemon like Gholdengo and Archaludon with Shadow Ball and Focus Blast and can use Trick to lock walls like Sableye into undesirable moves by giving them Choice Specs, which eases Maushold's sweeping capabilities. Ditto reverse sweeps against potential setup sweepers like Chien-Pao and Ceruledge, while Maushold provides entry hazard removal via Tidy Up, keeping Ditto as healthy as possible. Indeedee eases the Fighting matchup by dealing with Zamazenta and Choice Specs Keldeo with Expanding Force. It also provides Healing Wish support, allowing one of its teammates a second chance to sweep, and sets up Psychic Terrain so that Maushold does not fear revenge killing attempts from the likes of Kingambit and Keldeo. Ursaluna-B is a great bulky teammate, taking out Steel- and Poison-types like Archaludon and Sneasler, which would otherwise be troublesome to Maushold. Calm Mind Terapagos with BoltBeam coverage deals with pesky Flying- and Dragon-types like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Dragonite for Maushold. Blissey is an amazing special wall, tanking special hits from Flutter Mane and Greninja while also spreading paralysis via Thunder Wave. It also provides hazard support with Stealth Rock, which gives Maushold chance to OHKO Gliscor.</p>"

Iron Defense allows Garganacl to set up, tanking super effective physical hits due to its astronomical base 130 Defense, while also boosting the power of Body Press, which helps nail Dark- and Steel-types such as Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit. Curse is another option that can buff its Attack, boosting the damage of Salt Cure, but it prevents Garganacl from easily stonewalling physical attackers—such as Dragonite and defensive Quaquaval—and also lowers Garganacl's Speed. Salt Cure is a fantastic STAB move, neutering setup sweepers such as Mimikyu, Corviknight, and Hatterene, as it puts them on a timer, which Garganacl can potentially stall out as it sets up or heals via Recover. Purifying Salt is particularly useful, as it allows Garganacl to absorb incoming status moves such as Toxic from Quagsire or Toxapex as well as Will-O-Wisp from Dragapult or Sableye and punish them with Salt Cure. Garganacl is also able to tank Ghost-type STAB moves from the likes of Choice-locked Flutter Mane and Dragapult. Leftovers is the best item to provide passive recovery; however, Heavy-Duty Boots can allow Garganacl to come in without taking entry hazard damage, as entry hazard stacking is extremely common. As an alternative to the given EVs, 52 Defense EVs with an Impish nature let Garganacl potentially overwhelm Choice Band Scizor, Tinkaton, and defensive Quaquaval if used with Iron Defense.</p> <p>Tyranitar is an amazing partner for Garganacl, as it sets sand. Tyranitar can also be used as one of the few special attackers Rock teams have access to to nail physical walls such as Great Tusk with Ice Beam; it is also Rock's best check to Kingambit due to it being able to survive a boosted Sucker Punch and OHKO back with Fire Blast. Choice Scarf Glimmora can take on Grass- and Fighting-types such as Breloom and Iron Valiant that may threaten Garganacl out. Glimmora also has fantastic coverage, being able to take on Steel-types such as Gholdengo with Earth Power and Water-types such as Gastrodon and Quagsire with Energy Ball. Glimmora can also provide Toxic Spikes support thanks to its ability, Toxic Debris, which can help Garganacl further wear down and pressure the opposing Pokemon. Teammates that utilize Air Balloon such as Iron Thorns and Drednaw can switch into powerful Ground-type attacks aimed at Garganacl. Drednaw can also utilize its Water-type STAB move to take out opposing Ground-types such as Iron Treads, Unaware Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Furthermore, Drednaw can also turn the tide against rain Water teams thanks to its ability, Swift Swim. Lycanroc-D is also a really good partner for Garganacl that appreciates its ability to wear down foes so it can clean up late-game. Coalossal is also a good partner that can not only burn foes but also lay down entry hazards. Coalossal can also clear its side of the field as well with Rapid Spin, alleviating chip damage on the team. It also acts as a soft check to Scizor and Meowscarada due to its neutralities and can potentially neuter them with Flame Body.</p>"

Flamethrower complements Armarouge's Stored Power, allowing it to hit Steel-types like Scizor, Gholdengo, and Iron Treads. Iron Defense increases Armarouge's survivability against physical attacks, negating Defense drops from Weak Armor as well as letting it survive super effective moves like Earthquake from defensive Great Tusk, activating its Weakness Policy. At +1, Focus Blast allows Armarouge to OHKO Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Hydreigon, and potentially Tyranitar while also 2HKOing Hisuian Goodra and specially defensive Heatran. Aura Sphere can be used over Focus Blast for its accuracy; however, it trades off Focus Blast's higher power, requiring multiple boosts to OHKO common foes like Roaring Moon. Weak Armor boost allows Armarouge to outspeed faster threats like Dragapult, Flutter Mane, and Choice Scarf users like Roaring Moon, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus while also boosting the power of Stored Power.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is an excellent partner for Armarouge, providing dual screens support for easier setup and setting entry hazards, making it easier for Armarouge to break through bulky foes. Indeedee sets up Psychic Terrain, which boosts the power of Armarouge's Psychic moves and blocks priority moves like Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Azumarill's Aqua Jet. Indeedee can also provide Healing Wish support, giving Armarouge a second chance to sweep. Latios provides a Ground immunity and a Water resistance and threatens foes with these types back with its BoltBeam coverage. Gallade threatens Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Alolan Muk, while Hoopa-U deals with Ghost-types like non-Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Skeledirge, and Spectrier. Armarouge also appreciates the pair's ability to break through special walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Swampert, and Blissey. Hatterene provides hazard control thanks to Magic Bounce, and Choice Scarf Iron Boulder deals with faster threats like Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Greninja, and Roaring Moon.

Swords Dance allows it to set up quickly, enabling it to break walls like Iron Hands and Hisuian Goodra with relative ease. Bitter Blade allows Ceruledge to re-enable its Focus Sash if it's not already consumed. Poltergeist hits foes that resist Bitter Blade like Gouging Fire, Toxapex, and Heatran. Shadow Sneak allows Ceruledge to check faster threats like Dragapult, Iron Boulder, and Flutter Mane. Jolly Nature makes Ceruledge faster than threats like Choice Scarf Iron Boulder and Choice Scarf Landorus after a boost from Weak Armor, checking the former with Poltergeist and the latter with +2 Bitter Blade.</p> <p>Both sun setters, Ninetales and Torkoal, are amazing teammates for Ceruledge. Ninetales has access to utility moves such as Encore and Healing Wish to ensure Ceruledge can come safely on the field and can also use Solar Beam to punish Gastrodon and Swampert, while Torkoal can set Stealth Rock up and remove opposing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Sun is especially primordial for Ceruledge, as it boosts the power of Bitter Blade and enhances Ceruledge's wallbreaking capabilities, notably allowing it to OHKO specially defensive Gliscor after a Swords Dance. Cinderace provides support with Court Change, ensuring Ceruledge's Focus Sash remains intact, and can take out Dark-type foes such as Hydreigon and Tyranitar with High Jump Kick. Ogerpon-H is a great wallbreaking partner for Ceruledge, hitting Heatran whose Air Balloon has been popped as well as Water- and Ground-type threats such as Hisuian Samurott, Keldeo, Swampert, and Hippowdon. Gouging Fire pairs well with Ceruledge, as it can break through defensive cores in Dragon and Flying matchups and can clear the way for Ceruledge to sweep late-game. Air Balloon Heatran is another great partner, providing a Ground immunity and dealing with opposing Gouging Fire. Finally, Volcarona is a valuable teammate, as it can ease Ceruledge's job by disposing of Toxapex and IronPress Zamazenta while benefiting from the breaches Ceruledge can create against opposing special walls such as Gliscor and Clodsire.</p>"

Poltergeist is Ceruledge's hardest hitting STAB move, notably OHKOing walls like Clodsire, Sinistcha, and Pecharunt after a Swords Dance. Alternatively, Close Combat may be used to threaten Dark-types such as Ting-Lu, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott as well as Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Kingambit. However, Ceruledge without a powerful Ghost-type STAB move will be walled by Skeledirge, Garchomp, and Toxapex. Bitter Blade allows Ceruledge to eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit, Skarmory, and Iron Treads as well as recover any chip damage so Focus Sash can be properly utilized. Furthermore, Bitter Blade can be used to trade with threats like Alolan Muk, Chien-Pao, and Meowscarada. Shadow Sneak scares away faster Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Spectrier, OHKOing them after Ceruledge boosts its Attack stat. A Jolly nature enables Ceruledge to outpace Choice Scarf users like Darkrai, Iron Boulder, Greninja, and Meowscarada after a Weak Armor boost, while an Adamant nature allows Ceruledge to OHKO Archaludon and Rotom-W after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Flutter Mane is a great teammate due to its ability to check Dark-types like Mandibuzz, Hydreigon, and Greninja while in return, Ceruledge takes out specially defensive walls such as Heatran, Clodsire, and Hisuian Goodra. Air Balloon Gholdengo breaks past threats like Ursaluna and Toxapex should Ceruledge not opt for Poltergeist. In exchange, Ceruledge threatens the aforementioned Steel-types and breaks past specially defensive walls like Blissey and Swampert. Sinistcha leverages its resistance to Ground and Water to switch into attacks from Ogerpon-W, Excadrill, and Keldeo, and it can also spread burns via Matcha Gotcha to weaken walls. Dragapult spreads status ailments through Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp to chip down physically defensive walls and threatens Dragon-types such as Kommo-o, Gouging Fire, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. Spectrier also spreads burns with Will-O-Wisp and appreciates Ceruledge weakening teams so it can easily clean late-game by setting up Calm Mind repeatedly or sweeping via a Choice Scarf set. Brambleghast removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin to maintain Ceruledge's Focus Sash and provides the same resistances that Sinistcha does. Hisuian Zoroark offers a Ghost-type immunity and the ability to remove Dark-types like Hydreigon and Hisuian Samurott via Focus Blast. Froslass provides Spikes support to wear down foes and prevents hazards from being set by using Taunt. Golurk offers Stealth Rock support and can set up beneficial trades using Berries or a Focus Sash.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Kilowattrel is an essential component to Flying teams, providing an Electric immunity, pivot support, an excellent Speed tier that allows it to outspeed Choice Specs Greninja and Iron Valiant, and a range of hard-hitting attacks. With rain support, Thunder can be used as Kilowattrel's hard-hitting STAB attack to hit Pokemon—such as Toxapex—that Flying teams can struggle to take down. Thunderbolt is a fine substitute on Flying teams that do not utilize rain. Volt Switch allows Kilowattrel to pivot, making use of Kilowattrel's high Speed tier to get off damage while not being Choice locked. Hurricane couples with the preceding moves to cover Kilowattrel's STAB combination, specifically hitting Ground-types such as Quagsire and Gastrodon. The last slot depends on whether rain is being taken advantage of: on rain teams, Weather Ball can be used to hit Ground-types such as Unaware Clodsire, while Air Slash is another option for non-rain teams that can make up for Hurricane's lower accuracy. Choice Specs allows Kilowattrel to hit extremely hard, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Azumarill with Volt Switch and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Volt Absorb provides the only Electric immunity for Flying-type teams.</p> <p>Corviknight is one of Kilowattrel's greatest assets; beyond providing a neutral switch-in to Ice-type attacks—especially in the cases of Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Greninja—Corviknight provides a physical wall that Kilowattrel can pivot into. It is also Flying's most common Defogger, which is essential, as Kilowattrel is susceptible to Stealth Rock damage, hindering its pivoting. Pelipper is very useful in supporting Kilowattrel, as rain support ensures accuracy of Kilowattrel's Thunder and Hurricane, and U-turn on Pelipper ensures safe pivoting. Talonflame is another defensive supporter, covering Kilowattrel's weakness to Ice-types and offering another Defogger. Dragonite hits the specially defensive walls that Kilowattrel struggles with such as Clodsire and Blissey. Gyarados finds great support from Kilowattrel; as Kilowattrel punches holes in defensive Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Toxapex, Gyarados will have a better chance to sweep late-game. While Kilowattrel has excellent Speed itself, Choice Scarf users such as Flamigo and Salamence can revenge kill Pokemon such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane that outspeed Kilowattrel. Bombirdier offers Stealth Rock support and uses Knock Off to remove key items such as Leftovers on Gastrodon, which puts it into 2HKO range of Hurricane after Stealth Rock damage.</p>"

Spikes helps offensive teams deal extra chip damage to Pokemon that would otherwise stifle progress, such as Ting-Lu and Alolan Muk. Rapid Spin removes opposing hazards, helping preserve offensive teammates as well as keeping Ceruledge's Focus Sash intact. Rapid Spin also allows teammates to forgo Heavy-Duty Boots in favor of different items. Power Whip is a great way of making sure Brambleghast is not completely passive, allowing it to hit foes like Swampert, Glimmora, and Primarina for solid damage. Strength Sap not only allows Brambleghast to recover HP, but it also weakens physically oriented foes that fail to OHKO it, such as Great Tusk, Barraskewda, and Hisuian Samurott. Additionally, Brambleghast outspeeds Adamant Azumarill and OHKOes with Power Whip. An offensive EV spread with an Adamant nature can be used to surprise opponents expecting defensive Brambleghast. In this case, Shadow Sneak is an option to OHKO Flutter Mane after Spikes damage. Infiltrator is preferred on offensive sets because it allows Brambleghast to ignore Reflect.</p> <p>Offensive teammates greatly appreciate Brambleghast's Spikes damage helping them muscle through opposing teams. Choice Specs Flutter Mane thrives when its would-be switch-ins, notably Hisuian Goodra and Alolan Muk, are weakened by Spikes, turning 3HKOs into 2HKOs. Additionally, Flutter Mane is able to take out Dark- and Fire-type Pokemon, such as Mandibuzz, Greninja, and Ogerpon-H, via Moonblast and Power Gem. Spectrier is another Pokemon that thrives with entry hazard support, as it becomes increasingly difficult for opposing teams to switch into Shadow Ball as the Grim Neigh boosts begin to stack. Ceruledge pairs nicely with Brambleghast, as Rapid Spin ensures that Ceruledge's Focus Sash will be kept intact, and it can be used to the best of its ability. Ceruledge is also able to take out Steel-type Pokemon that Brambleghast is unable to deal with. Sinistcha is a great setup sweeper that can utilize Spikes support to steamroll through teams once it gets some Calm Mind boosts. Gholdengo also pairs nicely with Brambleghast, as not only is Gholdengo immune to Rapid Spin, but it also blocks Defog with Good as Gold, ensuring Spikes stays up. Choice Scarf Dragapult is able to deal with faster threats that would otherwise take care of Brambleghast, such as Meowscarada and Hoopa-U. Dragapult's set variety keeps the opponent guessing, which makes switches very punishing. Hisuian Zoroark is a great teammate, as it can freely disguise itself as Gholdengo and not have Stealth Rock damage give the illusion away. Skeledirge is a nice defensive teammate for Brambleghast, as it is able to deal with Steel-type Pokemon and setup sweepers that Brambleghast struggles with.</p>"

Shadow Sneak provides Brambleghast with a much needed from of priority, allowing it to pick off weakened targets such as Dragapult, Iron Boulder, and Latios. Strength Sap can be used over Spikes, as it allows Brambleghast to weaken physical threats like Iron Hands while providing a form of recovery. Adamant is preferred thanks to allowing Brambleghast to OKHO Flutter Mane after minimal chip damage and 2HKO Skarmory after an Attack boost from Hurricane and Stealth Rock damage. Jolly can be used, as it allows Brambleghast to outspeed and check Gholdengo with Poltergeist.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Meowscarada is a crucial ally for Brambleghast due to it being able to threaten opposing Ghost- and Dark-types like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Greninja with Knock Off and Play Rough. Hisuian Lilligant and Breloom can take care of Dark- and Steel-types such as Alolan Muk, Kingambit, and Heatran. Both Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-C can be used to threaten Bug- and Ice-types such as Galvantula, Frosmoth, and Articuno; on top of that, Ogerpon-H also handles Steel-types such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Scizor, while Ogerpon-C deals with Flying- and Fire-type threats such as Enamorus, Gouging Fire, and Volcarona. Amoonguss can support Brambleghast by threatening Fairy-types out such as Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Primarina with its Sludge Bomb along with being able to use Spore to give Brambleghast safe entry. Hydrapple provides a Fire neutrality and can use Earth Power to deal with Fire-types like Heatran and Volcanion.

Giga Drain threatens Pokemon like Ting-Lu, allowing Scovillain's teammates to break through them late-game, and it also aids in improving Scovillain's longevity by recovering its HP. Fire Blast can be used to have a chance of 2HKOing Skeledirge and Clodsire under sun, but Flamethrower is the preferred Fire-type STAB move, since its accuracy is higher than Fire Blast's. Stomping Tantrum hits opposing Fire-types such as Iron Moth. Solar Beam is an alternative to Stomping Tantrum, OHKOing the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Toxapex after Growth in sun. Life Orb and 32 Attack EVs maximize Scovillain's power, letting it 2HKO specially defensive Clodsire with Stomping Tantrum after Stealth Rock damage.

A Naive nature allows Scovillain to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Great Tusk and Iron Moth under sun while not losing out on Stomping Tantrum damage.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory partner for Scovillain, as its ability to set up sun allows Scovillain to outspeed many faster threats like Iron Treads, Iron Jugulis, and Quaquaval, dealing heavy chip damage or outright KOing them. Scovillain appreciates Torkoal getting rid of entry hazards; in return, Scovillain deals with Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks. Paldean Tauros-F is a great offensive partner for Scovillain, granting benefits such as breaking dual screens from Pokemon like Klefki and Grimmsnarl, which impede Scovillain's sweeping ability.

Furthermore, Cinderace's Speed tier allows it to handle offensive Pokemon that naturally outpace Scovillain outside of sun like Hydreigon and Iron Treads, the former of which Scovillain cannot hit neutrally. Scovillain also appreciates Volcarona as an offensive partner thanks to its non-weather-reliant sweeping potential in Quiver Dance, dealing with Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Garchomp, while Scovillain can weaken Volcarona's checks like Ting-Lu, Unaware Clodsire, and Toxapex throughout the course of the game.</p>"

Alternatively, Overheat has better accuracy and still 2HKOes Skeledirge and Clodsire, but the Special Attack drop makes it less spammable. Giga Drain threatens a 2HKO on Pelipper, which may be tempted to come into Scovillain to block Solar Beam, and also provides Scovillain a form of recovery. A Timid nature lets it outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Gengar and Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake to burn them to a crisp, while a Modest nature has better odds of 2HKOing Toxapex with Giga Drain and OHKOing Baxcalibur with Flamethrower at the cost of outspeeding only up to non-Speed boosting Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Torkoal is a mandatory teammate, as it sets sun, which Scovillain needs to boost its Speed with Chlorophyll, and provides entry hazard support with its ability to set Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Other forms of entry hazard support in Defog Talonflame and Court Change Cinderace are also appreciated; they also have access to U-turn, which allows Scovillain to get in more times to wallbreak. Ceruledge packs Shadow Sneak to deal with Flutter Mane, which otherwise outspeeds and dispatches Scovillain with ease. In return, Scovillain obliterates bulky Unaware walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, all of which hinder Swords Dance Ceruledge from cutting down Water and Ghost teams. Similarly, Volcarona and Iron Moth love Scovillain's ability to eliminate bulky walls like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, allowing them to clean up Poison and Ground teams late-game. Skeledirge deals with Kingambit and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, which threaten Scovillain with priority or by outspeeding it and picking it off.</p>"

Gigaton Hammer OHKOes Rock- and Fairy-types like Glimmora, Kleavor, Flutter Mane, and Hatterene. Knock Off provides Tinkaton with another offensive option that removes important items from Steel-types such as Corviknight and Archaludon. Swords Dance allows Tinkaton to gain offensive pressure, securing OKHOs on more defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing and Amoonguss while also dealing with walls like Defog Corviknight. Finally, Stealth Rock allows Tinkaton to provide utility when causing havoc offensively isn't an option. The EVs allow Tinkaton to get a jump on threats like Glimmora and Kleavor, with the rest invested into its bulk.</p> <p>Tinkaton majorly appreciates the support of Flutter Mane, which can use Thunderbolt and Power Gem to handle the Water- and Fire-types that Tinkaton cannot handle, namely Toxapex, Greninja, Ogerpon-H, and Torkoal. Enamorus, thanks to its secondary Flying typing, can switch in to Ground-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk, Gliscor, Landorus, and Excadrill and threaten back with the appropriate coverage. Klefki and Tinkaton form an entry hazard-stacking core that Fairy's offensive threats appreciate. Tinkaton also enjoys dual screens support from Klefki, making its setup much safer. Mixed Iron Valiant provides incredible coverage, being able to remove targets like Landorus, Toxapex, and Archaludon, which otherwise wall Tinkaton. Hatterene values Tinkaton's utility in Stealth Rock and Knock Off chipping down switch-ins like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra and can support Tinkaton by being able to use Nuzzle and slow down faster threats like Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant, which can threaten Tinkaton. Primarina cherishes Tinkaton's ability to remove Assault Vest from targets like Iron Hands and Galarian Slowking that can prove problematic. In return, Calm Mind Primarina can threaten bulky Steel- and Fire-type targets like Corviknight, Heatran, and Gouging Fire, which are hinderances for Tinkaton. Azumarill takes advantage of Tinkaton's Stealth Rock, which provides crucial chip damage, allowing it to OHKO targets like Tozapex and Corviknight that can be hurdles for both Tinkaton and Azumarill.</p>"

Power Gem is used to threaten problematic Flying- and Fire-types like Articuno, Zapdos, Torkoal, and Iron Moth. Earth Power allows Glimmora to deal solid damage to Steel-types like Gholdengo and Heatran after their Air Balloon is popped. Alternatively, Mortal Spin can be run to spread poison onto Hatterene, which cannot be poisoned otherwise thanks to Magic Bounce, and remove entry hazards.</p> <p>Due to Glimmora's immense weakness to Ground- and Water-type attacks, Amoonguss is a valuable partner, taking on dangerous threats such as Great Tusk, Swampert, and Urshifu-R with ease. Toxapex can similarly assist against Water-types like Barraskewda and Keldeo, Steel-types like Scizor and Corviknight, and Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Sneasler. Toxapex can also run Toxic Spikes to assist Glimmora with hazard stacking. Galarian Weezing provides a solid Ground immunity thanks to Levitate, allowing it to come in on threats like Clodsire, Garchomp, and Ting-Lu, and it provides solid hazard removal with Defog. Overqwil pairs well with Glimmora, providing both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which allows it to complete the hazard stacking-core while also taking on foes like Iron Boulder, Gallade, and Dragapult thanks to Intimidate. Alolan Muk provides Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Dragonite, Iron Moth, and Volcarona, increasing the threat of Glimmora's Stealth Rock; it can also deal with Psychic- and Ghost-type threats like Espathra, Hatterene, and Flutter Mane. Galarian Slowking's Future Sight can lure in special walls such as Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra, which Glimmora can take advantage of to spread Toxic. Galarian Slowking can also check threats like Heatran and Terapagos, which prove problematic for Glimmora. Okidogi and Sneasler greatly appreciate Glimmora's ability to put physical walls like Pecharunt, Toxapex, and Sableye on timers with Toxic, while Glimmora appreciates their ability to check troublesome Steel-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Goodra, and Empoleon.</p>"

Earth Power threatens Steel- and Poison-types like Gholdengo, non-Air Balloon Heatran, Iron Moth, and Sneasler. Sludge Wave is a strong STAB move that can take on Fairy- and Grass-types such as Hisuian Lilligant, Ogerpon-W, Ogerpon-H, and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant. Dazzling Gleam takes out Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-types like Sableye, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o. Energy Ball allows Glimmora to deal with Water- and Ground-types like Quagsire and non-Choice Scarf Greninja and Great Tusk. Mortal Spin can be run over Energy Ball to help remove entry hazards and poison foes in the process. Power Gem can be run instead to deal with Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Kleavor.</p> <p>Tyranitar provides sand and a Psychic immunity while also taking on special attackers for Glimmora such as Spectrier, Espathra, and Hisuian Zoroark. Thanks to the sand Tyranitar provides, Glimmora can survive a Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Dragapult due to the Special Defense boost and 2HKO it with Dazzling Gleam. In return, Glimmora also takes out Hisuian Samurott, Quagsire, and Ogerpon-W for Tyranitar. Ogerpon-C can compensate for Glimmora's Ground weakness, and, after setup, it can eliminate Ursaluna-B, Dragonite, and Landorus. Glimmora aids Ogerpon-C by handling threats such as Kleavor when running Power Gem, Iron Valiant, and Hisuian Lilligant. Glimmora can further aid Ogerpon-C with Mortal Spin by removing entry hazards to help prevent Ogerpon-C's Sturdy from breaking. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine is a strong wallbreaker that can deal with Corviknight, Clodsire, and Toxapex. Coalossal can serve as entry hazard control to allow Glimmora to drop Mortal Spin; it can additionally support the team with Spikes, facilitating Glimmora's cleaning. Coalossal also deals with Scizor, Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Corviknight. Glimmora returns the favor by threatening Clodsire and Toxapex, which can threaten Coalossal. Lead Kleavor can set up Stealth Rock and potentially break opposing Ceruledge's Focus Sash. In exchange, Glimmora eliminates physical walls like Quagsire and non-Air Balloon Heatran for Kleavor. Iron Defense Garganacl is a stallbreaker that can force progress with Salt Cure in matchups against defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Hisuian Goodra, and Galarian Slowking. Glimmora dispatches Choice Band Mamoswine after Stealth Rock, entry hazard chip and Urshifu-R, which can threaten Garganacl. Alolan Golem can trap and eliminate Steel-types like Scizor and Corviknight.

Sludge Wave is Glimmora's strongest move and can KO threats like Ogerpon-H, Iron Valiant, and Alolan Ninetales. Earth Power hits the Steel-types that would effortlessly switch into Glimmora's STAB moves such as non-Air Balloon Heatran, Gholdengo, and Archaludon. Finally, Glimmora has a choice between Energy Ball, which threatens Choice Specs Greninja and Ground-types like Mamoswine and Ursaluna-B, and Dazzling Gleam, which strikes Dragon-type foes including Dragapult and Choice Band Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Levitate Galarian Weezing's immunity to Ground- and Dragon-type attacks allows it to come in on the bulky Ground- and Dragon-types Glimmora can't handle such as Clodsire, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Galarian Weezing also provides solid utility by taking Knock Off from Meowscarada and Great Tusk, in addition to removing entry hazards with Defog to allow Glimmora safe entry. Amoonguss and Toxapex handle Water-types that can outspeed Glimmora or survive its Energy Ball like Urshifu-R, Barraskewda, and Dondozo. Amoonguss also helps out against Ground-types like Iron Treads and Excadrill thanks to Giga Drain and Foul Play along with providing safe entry for Glimmora thanks to Spore. Toxapex can switch into Steel-types like Scizor and Metagross, which threaten Glimmora out with their priority Bullet Punch, and handle them with Rocky Helmet and Recover. Alolan Muk can switch into the Ghost- and Psychic-types that threaten Glimmora like Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Latias and threaten them back with Knock Off, which can prevent them from threatening Glimmora later. Overqwil handles physical Psychic-types like Gallade, Metagross, and Iron Boulder and can set Spikes to chip special walls like Alolan Muk and Hisuian Goodra attemping to threaten Glimmora out. Overqwil meanwhile benefits from Glimmora's Toxic Debris powering up Barb Barrage. Both Okidogi and Sneasler complement Glimmora by being physical attackers capable of removing special walls like Alolan Muk and Blissey with their incredible Fighting-type STAB moves, and both benefit from Glimmora's ability to remove physical walls like Talonflame and Skarmory. Iron Moth complements Glimmora by being able to use its Fire-type STAB moves to melt Steel-types like Corviknight, Archaludon, and Excadrill, which give Glimmora significant issues.</p>"

Ice Shard is used to pick off the few Choice Scarf users that outspeed Cetitan, such as Meowscarada, Enamorus, and Flutter Mane. Earthquake is useful for hitting the Steel-, Water- and Fire-types that resist Icicle Crash and Ice Shard, such as Heatran, Kingambit, Toxapex, and Ceruledge.

Avalugg serves better as a dedicated defensive wall, while Sandslash can also take advantage of Slush Rush, Swords Dance, and Knock Off. Kyurem is excellent at dealing with Unaware walls that would otherwise ignore Cetitan's Belly Drum boost; it is able to use Freeze-Dry and defeat walls such as Quagsire and Dondozo while also having access to Earth Power, which defeats Skeledirge. Chien-Pao is a strong wallbreaker that can hit Steel-types that commonly use Air Balloon such as Gholdengo and Heatran. Mamoswine is a good teammate, as it can provide hazard support to break Focus Sash and secure OHKOs on targets such as Corviknight, as well as soften the blow from Fire-type attacks.</p>"

They also aid Great Tusk, should its Focus Sash be disabled, by checking and OHKOing in retaliation popular Choice Specs users like Dragapult, Latios, and Flutter Mane, while they both appreciate Great Tusk's ability to remove entry hazards from the field. They both come with their matchups of predilection: Flying and Fairy for Iron Hands and Poison and Water for Gallade. Iron Hands takes on Primarina, Hatterene, and Corviknight, while Gallade slashes through Amoonguss, Galarian Weezing, and Keldeo. Choice Scarf Sneasler can deal with Grass- and Fairy-types such as the Ogerpon formes, Primarina, and Iron Valiant while retaining momentum with U-turn. With its especially large movepool, Iron Valiant can help Great Tusk in many ways, from getting rid of Flying-type Pokemon with BoltBeam coverage like Landorus, Corviknight, and Gliscor to deleting physical walls such as Sableye and Hippowdon with STAB Moonblast, and it appreciates Great Tusk's ability to remove Assault Vest from Tornadus-T. Water-type wallbreakers like Keldeo and Urshifu-R also synergize quite well with Great Tusk, as Great Tusk provides a useful Electric immunity, allowing them to focus on dismantling opposing defensive Pokemon such as Corviknight and Skarmory. Zamazenta benefits a lot from the hazard control Great Tusk offers, as it lets Zamazenta run safely an IronPress or Choice Band set without worrying about entry hazards. Finally, Hisuian Lilligant provides some utility in the form of Sleep Powder and can also aid offensively in the Flying, Water, and Ground matchups with its Victory Dance set, effectively suppressing the likes of Urshifu-R, Swampert, and Landorus.</p>"

      "Defensive Utility (Fighting)": {
        "description": "<p>Boasting impressive bulk, Great Tusk takes the physical wall role for Fighting teams, being able to tank multiple hits from physical attackers such as Dragonite and Ceruledge. Earthquake threatens Poison-, Electric-, and Fire-types like Clodsire, Iron Hands, and Gouging Fire. Knock Off hits Earthquake switch-ins such as Air Balloon Gholdengo, Latios, and Tornadus-T and removes their item. Alternatively, Ice Spinner can threaten Gliscor and Dragonite, preventing them from setting up on Great Tusk. Rapid Spin provides entry hazard control and boosts Great Tusk's Speed, which can allow it to weaken offensive foes such as Latios. Taunt can be used instead to notably prevent Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Hippowdon from setting up hazards and prevents Corviknight's Defog. Lastly, Great Tusk can set Stealth Rock up, breaking Focus Sash on Ceruledge and Breloom and greatly helping the team progress in the game. The EV spread lets Great Tusk outspeed maximum Speed Modest Raging Bolt while maximizing Great Tusk's physical bulk.</p> <p>Defensive Great Tusk appreciates teammates that can make up for its abysmal special bulk like Assault Vest Iron Hands and Assault Vest Gallade. Assault Vest Iron Hands deals with Flying- and Fairy-types threats such as Primarina, Hatterene, and Gyarados. Gallade gives Fighting teams the edge in troublesome matchups like Poison and Water by slashing through Keldeo, Amoonguss, and Galarian Weezing. In return, they both appreciate Great Tusk dealing with Excadrill. Defensive Great Tusk also synergizes well with popular Fighting team sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Keldeo, and Sneasler, removing entry hazards and taking physical hits for them, while they break through the opponent's team. Iron Valiant can delete Fighting-, Dark-, and Dragon-types like Keldeo, Sableye, and Choice Specs Latios with Moonblast while threatening Flying teams thanks to its access to BoltBeam. Keldeo appreciates the Electric immunity Great Tusk comes with, as it lets it focus more on overwhelming defensive cores like Corviknight and Skarmory. Sneasler takes on Fairy- and Grass-types threats such as Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Ogerpon formes while providing U-turn support to bring Great Tusk in on physical threats such as Gliscor. Hisuian Lilligant can put a foe to sleep and dispose of Ground- and Water-types foes with its Victory Dance set such as Landorus, Swampert, and Urshifu-R. Finally, Both IronPress and Choice Band Zamazenta benefit a lot from the hazard control Great Tusk offers by setting up or sweeping without having to worry about hazards.</p>"

      "Bulk Up (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>With Bulk Up, Great Tusk acts as a decent setup sweeper on Ground teams that also deters Iron Defense Zamazenta and Kingambit, both of which can be a bit difficult for Ground teams to handle. Body Press OHKOes Kingambit, Weavile, and Mamoswine after Stealth Rock while also taking advantage of its respectable Defense and Bulk Up to muscle through foes like Corviknight and Zamazenta. Knock Off provides coverage against Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult while removing key items such as Archaludon's Leftovers and Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Rapid Spin not only removes entry hazards to support its teammates, but with the Speed boost, Great Tusk is also able to outspeed normally faster foes like Gouging Fire. 44 Speed EVs allow Great Tusk to outspeed and threaten Modest Magnezone and Jolly Kingambit.</p> <p>Clodsire is a crucial teammate for Great Tusk, since it sets up entry hazards to wear down incoming foes, is a Water-immune teammate, and fares well against the likes of Flutter Mane, Walking Wake, and Primarina, which Great Tusk hates. In return, Clodsire appreciates Great Tusk beating Ground-types that threaten it such as Excadrill and Iron Treads. Ting-Lu can also set up entry hazards, and in addition, it phazes out setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Hydreigon with Whirlwind and fares well in the Psychic and Dragon matchups, notably switching in against Latios and Choice Specs Dragapult. Mamoswine and Landorus appreciate Great Tusk removing hazards, which would otherwise wear them down easily. In return, Mamoswine aids in the Flying and Dragon matchups, taking on the likes of Enamorus, Dragonite, Hisuian Goodra, and Dragapult, while Landorus's coverage hits a myriad of foes like Hatterene, Archaludon, and IronPress Zamazenta. Late-game sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp appreciate Great Tusk beating foes like Kingambit so it can sweep more easily. Mixed Garchomp is also an option, as it lures and heavily damages Skarmory and Archaludon, which give Great Tusk trouble. Sand teams benefit from Great Tusk's ability to keep Zamazenta and Kingambit at bay; in return, Sand Rush Excadrill swiftly deals with Flutter Mane, Choice Scarf Meowscarada, and Greninja for Great Tusk.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>A Choice Scarf combined with high-power STAB moves, great physical bulk, and high Attack makes Great Tusk one of the best options on Ground teams for a wallbreaker and late-game cleaner, threatening the likes of Choice Scarf Gholdengo and Kingambit. Close Combat hits different threats to Ground teams like Choice Specs Greninja and Hoopa-U. Headlong Rush OHKOes Flutter Mane. Earthquake can be used over Headlong Rush despite its lower power due to not causing Defense and Special Defense drops, making it better for sweeping. Ice Spinner targets the likes of Garchomp, Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus. Alternatively, Stone Edge targets Flying- and Bug-types such as Articuno, Talonflame, and Volcarona. Megahorn can also be used to target Grass- and Psychic-types such as Ogerpon-W, Latios, and Slowbro; Slowbro is notably 2HKOed by it after Stealth Rock damage. Knock Off prevents Air Balloon Gholdengo from walling Great Tusk, and it also removes items from foes such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Gyarados and Brambleghast and Leftovers from Corviknight.</p> <p>Clodsire, Ting-Lu, Hippowdon, and Gliscor provide entry hazard support in wearing down foes to aid Great Tusk, guaranteeing a 2HKO on specially defensive Corviknight and an OHKO on the Ogerpon formes. Additionally, Clodsire provides a Water immunity, and its Poison typing allows it to melt Toxic Spikes and threaten Grass- and Fairy-types such as Meowscarada, Flutter Mane, and Clefable; Ting-Lu phazes setup sweepers such as Volcarona and Dragonite with Whirlwind; Hippowdon sets up sand to wear down foes further; and Gliscor spreads status with Toxic and shuts down passive walls with Taunt. In return, they appreciate Great Tusk dealing with Ice-types like Kyurem. Sand-boosted Excadrill takes out Choice Scarf users such as Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Iron Boulder. In return, Great Tusk deals with Dragon-types like Garchomp. When Great Tusk chooses to forego Ice Spinner, Mamoswine makes for a great teammate to cover Dragon- and Flying-types like Choice Scarf Latias, Dragonite, and Landorus. Landorus makes for another great partner, as with its colorful coverage, it takes on the likes of Iron Defense Zamazenta, Primarina, and Clefable, and it can also provide Gravity support so Great Tusk fares better against Corviknight and Skarmory. Landorus appreciates Great Tusk taking out Ice-types in return. Iron Treads provides immense utility that helps Great Tusk, such as hazard removal and pivoting via Volt Switch, and it appreciates Great Tusk taking out Excadrill in return. Garchomp is a great late-game sweeper that appreciates Great Tusk's ability to take out bulky Pokemon such as Articuno, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor with the appropriate coverage, which in turn allows Garchomp to sweep much more easily.</p>"

Power Gem is helpful in the Fire and Flying matchups, hitting Ogerpon-H, Volcarona, Articuno, and Moltres. Substitute may be used to outplay Sucker Punch users such as Kingambit. Calm Mind is an option to capitalize on Flutter Mane's ability to force out most Pokemon, allowing it potentially overpower switch-ins such as Gastrodon and Empoleon. Psyshock threatens specially defensive walls like Clodsire and Blissey.</p>",

      "Choice Specs (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Flutter Mane is the premier Choice Specs user on Ghost teams thanks to its amazing Special Attack and Speed, outpacing Pokemon like Greninja and Gengar, with immense coverage giving it tools for every situation. Moonblast is both Flutter Mane's strongest move and can remove problematic Dark- and Dragon-types like Greninja, Hydreigon, and Archaludon with ease. Shadow Ball gives Flutter Mane a STAB option into Fairy-resistant foes like Amoonguss and allows it to threaten slower Ghost-type threats like Gholdengo and Sinistcha. Thunderbolt shocks Water- and Flying-types like Toxapex, Empoleon, Corviknight, and Enamorus. Finally, Power Gem shatters problematic Ice- and Fire-types including Alolan Ninetales, Frosmoth, Ogerpon-H, and Volcarona.</p> <p>Spikes support from the likes of Brambleghast and Froslass helps chip down special walls such as Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Ting-Lu that could otherwise threaten Flutter Mane. Brambleghast can also provide Rapid Spin support to give Flutter Mane safe entry and can threaten bulky Water- and Ground-types like Swampert, Gastrodon, and Clodsire. Froslass, meanwhile, can prevent the placement of entry hazards and Defog with Taunt. Gholdengo assists Flutter Mane by taking Steel-type attacks from the likes of Scizor, Corviknight, and Hisuian Goodra, status from the likes of Blissey, and Defog from the likes of Corviknight; in return, Gholdengo appreciates Power Gem support to remove Fire-types like Volcarona and Ogerpon-H that threaten it. Pecharunt, thanks to its high physical bulk, can withstand hits from the likes of Iron Hands, Zamazenta, and Scizor and threaten back with Malignant Chain to spread status to weaken walls or Foul Play to clear physical attackers away. Pecharunt can also safely bring in Flutter Mane thanks to Parting Shot. Sinistcha can help to take on the several Water- and Ground-types of the tier, including Barraskewda, Swampert, and Clodsire, along with being able to use Matcha Gotcha to burn physical attackers that can threaten Flutter Mane such as Alolan Muk and Iron Treads. Ceruledge benefits Flutter Mane by being able to use Bitter Blade to remove problematic Steel-types like Scizor and Magnezone along with being able to use Poltergeist to hit hard into special walls like Clodsire and Heatran. Ceruledge can also check opposing Flutter Mane and Dragapult thanks to Shadow Sneak. Dragapult enjoys Flutter Mane being able to break physical walls, including Archaludon, Great Tusk, and Overqwil. In return, Dragapult can wear down special walls like Alolan Muk and Iron Hands with its powerful STAB moves so Flutter Mane can effortlessly remove them. If wielding a Choice Scarf, Dragapult can also check opposing Choice Scarf threats like Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and Hoopa-U, which all pose a significant threat to Flutter Mane.</p>"

      "Choice Specs (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>Flutter Mane has a powerful dual STAB combination in Moonblast and Shadow Ball, as well as a plethora of coverage moves that allow it to choose its good matchups. Mystical Fire hits Steel-types such as Klefki and Iron Treads. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to punish specially defensive switch-ins like Dragalge, Blissey, and Clodsire. Flutter Mane can run Power Gem to pressure Fire teams, OHKOing foes like Volcarona and Torkoal, and it also benefits from Protosynthesis allowing it to outspeed Scovillain under the sun. Additionally, Flutter Mane usually goes with either Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Both are useful against Water teams, with the former helping against Toxapex and Pelipper while the latter deals with Gastrodon and Quagsire. Choice Specs further enhances Flutter Mane's wallbreaking power, allowing it to overwhelm foes such as Ting-Lu after some chip damage.</p> <p>On Fairy teams, Flutter Mane is a menacing wallbreaker that excels at taking down slower foes such as Hydreigon, Skeledirge, and Corviknight. When paired with Iron Valiant, Flutter Mane forms an offensive core that's able to alternate between Fairy-, Ghost-, and Fighting-type STAB to take down a wide range of enemies. Flutter Mane can handle Psychic-type foes such as Espathra and Hatterene, while Iron Valiant takes care of Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads. Flutter Mane can fall back on either Hatterene or Tinkaton when faced with an unfavorable matchup. Both of these Pokemon provide dependable defensive options and some type of entry hazard control, but Hatterene is particularly useful due to it breaking down walls like Dondozo and Clodsire. Flutter Mane also pairs well with setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Mimikyu, as it is able to poke holes in the opponent's team, allowing them to clean late-game. In return, Azumarill can take care of priority users, such as Ceruledge and Chien-Pao. In terms of support options, Flutter Mane can rely on Fairy's Prankster users, Klefki and Grimmsnarl, to set up dual screens, therefore allowing it to withstand hits such as Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak and Gholdengo's Make It Rain. Grimmsnarl can then bring in Flutter Mane relatively safely thanks to Parting Shot. Klefki's Spikes and Tinkaton's Stealth Rocks also support Flutter Mane in breaking its checks such as Iron Hands and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard stacking proves particularly useful against less bulky teams, as it highly limits their capacity to scout Flutter Mane without having to sacrifice a member in the process.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Flutter Mane is an incredibly potent revenge killer and late-game cleaner thanks to its strong STAB combination, solid coverage options, and blazing Speed tier. Notably, it outspeeds faster Pokemon like Dragapult, boosted threats such as Baxcalibur and Quaquaval, and Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Meowscarada, all of which can threaten the offensive teams that Flutter Mane is part of. Mystical Fire threatens Steel-types such as Corviknight and Iron Treads, while Psyshock revenge kills Choice Scarf Iron Moth and hits specially bulky Pokemon like Clodsire. Thunderbolt pressures Corviknight better and 2HKOes physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, while Energy Ball takes care of Gastrodon.</p> <p>Spikes from the likes of Brambleghast and Froslass are terrific support options, chipping down bulky foes like Toxapex and Ting-Lu that would otherwise switch into Flutter Mane freely. Thanks to Good as Gold blocking Defog and its Ghost-typing, Gholdengo is a notable partner to keep Spikes up. Brambleghast also helps threaten Gastrodon and provides Rapid Spin support as well. Wallbreakers like Mimikyu and Gholdengo can pressure the opposition early-game, allowing for Flutter Mane to clean up late-game with ease; moreover, Mimikyu can overwhelm Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads with Drain Punch, while Gholdengo can make use of Trick to cripple walls like Clodsire and Corviknight. Setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult and Swords Dance Ceruledge are valuable teammates that function as back-up late-game cleaners, especially against types Flutter Mane can struggle with such as Poison and Steel. Moreover, Ceruledge and Mimikyu have the added benefit of safely revenge killing opposing fast threats Flutter Mane can't handle easily, like Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and Dragon Dance Dragapult, with Shadow Sneak. Skeledirge is a notable partner to compensate for Flutter Mane's lack of physical bulk, taking on Bullet Punch users like Scizor and Lucario as well as being fantastic in the Steel, Fighting, and Bug matchups.</p>"

      "Bulky Choice Specs (Fairy)": {
        "description": "<p>Bulky Choice Specs Flutter Mane serves as a strong specially offensive wallbreaker that can survive one hit from most unboosted physical attacks, such as Ting Lu's Heavy Slam and Baxcalibur's Icicle Crash, with relative safety. Psyshock allows Flutter Mane to break through most Poison cores on its own with proper hazard support, most notably 2HKOing Clodsire, which otherwise walls it. Alternatively, Mystical Fire lets Flutter Mane break through defensive Steel-types like Iron Treads and and surprise more offensive Steel-types like Scizor behind Reflect, while Energy Ball targets would-be Rock-, Water-, and Ground-type walls like Garganacl and Gastrodon. The given EVs let Flutter Mane outspeed Spectrier, always survive +1 Dragonite's Earthquake, and almost always win the one-on-one matchup against Ting-Lu by having a 15/16 chance to survive its Heavy Slam and a 78% chance to 2HKO it with Moonblast in return after Leftovers recovery, using the minimum HP and Defense EVs possible.</p> <p>Bulky Choice Specs Flutter Mane takes advantage of its unexpected bulk to create surprise KOs, such as versus Dragon Dance Dragonite, while retaining its ability to remove key threats like Skeledirge, Corviknight, and Galarian Slowking. For this reason, setup sweepers like Belly Drum Azumarill and Calm Mind Hatterene are strong partners, as they can take advantage of the holes that Flutter Mane creates in defensive cores. Iron Valiant is another strong partner, as it can take advantage of both the specially defensive Pokemon that Flutter Mane may not be able to remove, such as Hisuian Goodra, Alolan Muk, and Heatran, while creating a generally strong offensive core. As Flutter Mane is slower than Chien-Pao and opposing Flutter Mane, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as the Enamorus and the aforementioned Iron Valiant are necessary to handle these threats. Choice Scarf Enamorus in particular is a strong partner, as it can reduce the necessity of Flutter Mane on the field while threatening its own powerful late-game cleanup with Contrary Superpower, supporting its team with Healing Wish, and using Iron Head to KO opposing Flutter Mane after hazard chip; it also has the added benefit of having a stronger matchup versus Choice Scarf Meowscarada than Iron Valiant. On the other hand, Choice Scarf Iron Valiant is more immediately threatening with a Choice Scarf, allowing it to outspeed Choice Scarf Iron Moth and Gengar, Chlorophyll Scovillain, and Slush Rush Cetitan, and OHKO threats that Enamorus could only dream of removing, such as Ice Shard Chien-Pao. Flutter Mane also struggles versus Steel-types like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Choice Scarf Iron Treads, so support from Klefki and Tinkaton, along with offensive checks like Azumarill, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, allows Flutter Mane to break through these cores much more reliably. The Poison-type matchup is particularly difficult, so Steel-types like Klefki and Tinkaton and Magic Bounce support from Hatterene help Flutter Mane, as they can provide hazard support while blocking or punishing Toxic Spikes. In return, Flutter Mane can pressure Clodsire and Galarian Slowking and chip Alolan Muk by capitalizing on the lack of switch-ins to the combination of Psyshock, Moonblast, Shadow Ball, and entry hazards.</p>"

      "All-Out Attacker (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots Flutter Mane is a potent offensive pivot and revenge killer, taking advantage of its immunity to entry hazards to stay out of KO range from priority moves such as Swords Dance Urshifu-R's boosted Aqua Jet and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak as well as bluff Choice Scarf to surprise foes with the ability to switch between moves. Moonblast threatens Dark- and Dragon-type Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Darkrai, and Walking Wake. Energy Ball hits Ground- and Water-type foes such as Mamoswine, Dondozo, Gastrodon, and Quagsire. Thunderbolt nails Water-types like Pelipper, Toxapex, and Empoleon, allowing Flutter Mane to threaten every Water-type Pokemon super effectively in tandem with Energy Ball. Furthermore, Thunderbolt wards off Flying-types such as Corviknight and Moltres. The given EV spread permits Flutter Mane to take a Shadow Sneak from Life Orb Mimikyu, easing the Ghost matchup.</p> <p>Gholdengo is an excellent teammate, as it takes advantage of Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon like Sneasler, Empoleon, and Amoonguss for Nasty Plot setup, while in return Flutter Mane threatens Ground-types such as Sandy Shocks and Gastrodon. Focus Sash Ceruledge is a really good wallbreaker against Steel and Dark teams, easily taking out Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Kingambit. Colbur Berry Spectrier excels in the Poison and Fighting matchups, weakening shared checks like Assault Vest Iron Hands and specially defensive Toxapex using Will-O-Wisp as well as takes out potential revenge killers like Choice Scarf Roaring Moon with Draining Kiss. Additionally, Choice Scarf Spectrier is great in the Ghost mirror matchup, threatening Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Flutter Mane, appreciating Flutter Mane removing Dark-types like Hydreigon and Darkrai in return. Brambleghast and Froslass provide Spikes setup to push Flutter Mane's targets into OHKO ranges, while the former also applies additional pressure on Water and Ground teams. Skeledirge wears down teams by spreading Will-O-Wisp and bypassing Substitute with Torch Song, walling and shutting down setup Pokemon such as Zamazenta and Iron Hands. Hisuian Zoroark provides a Ghost-type immunity, switching into attacks from opposing Ceruledge and Flutter Mane as well as providing utility via Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off, weakening physical attackers that Flutter Mane is vulnerable to such as Clodsire, Corviknight, and Poison Jab Toxapex and rendering foes susceptible to Spikes. Dragapult provides utility via Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, hindering threats like Chien-Pao and opposing Flutter Mane. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Dragapult removes other Choice Scarf users like Meowscarada and Roaring Moon.</p>"

Close Combat is Slither Wing's strongest STAB move, which takes out Normal-, Rock-, Steel-, and Ice-types like Blissey, Garganacl, Hisuian Goodra, and Mamoswine. U-turn not only damages foes, but it also allows Slither Wing to pivot out into one of its teammates like Frosmoth. Morning Sun can be run over U-turn to increase Slither Wing's longevity throughout the battle, notably in the Steel matchup; however, doing so means Slither Wing lacks the key pivoting it gets from U-turn. First Impression provides priority for Slither Wing to deal with fast threats like Iron Boulder, Latios, and Darkrai. Earthquake allows Slither Wing to deal with Gholdengo while also threatening pesky Poison-types like Clodsire and 2HKOing Toxapex. Life Orb is the go-to item for Slither Wing so it can hit as hard as possible, notably giving it a chance to OHKO Ursaluna-B. Heavy-Duty Boots can be run over Life Orb to let Slither Wing ignore entry hazards and stay healthy. However, losing the additional power Life Orb provides is not appreciated. Adamant is its preferred nature, maximizing Slither Wing's damage to let it 2HKO Skarmory and specially defensive Corviknight with Life Orb-boosted Close Combat.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Kleavor is a great teammate for Slither Wing, dealing with Flying- and Fire-types like Dragonite, Moltres, and Ogerpon-H with Stone Axe, which also sets Stealth Rock, weakening foes that Slither Wing can pick off with First Impression. Swords Dance Scizor at +2 can deal with troublesome Fairy- and Rock-types like Flutter Mane, Enamorus, and Choice Scarf Hisuian Arcanine. Slither Wing taking out Steel-types like Klefki and Bisharp means that Scizor has an easier time sweeping with Bullet Punch. Volcarona and Frosmoth are fierce setup sweepers that make for great partners; Volcarona at +1 deals with Galarian Weezing, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk with Psychic and Giga Drain, while Frosmoth at +1 deals with Dragonite, Gliscor, and the Landorus formes with Ice Beam. Ribombee, Galvantula, and Araquanid all provide Sticky Web support, which allows Slither Wing to outspeed and eliminate threats like Ogerpon-H, Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine, and Choice Specs Iron Moth. Each Sticky Web setter also provides additional support for Slither Wing: Ribombee is the fastest of the setters and also threatens Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-types like Dragonite, Sableye, Iron Valiant, and Great Tusk, Galvantula eases the Flying and Water matchups thanks to its part-Electric typing and the combination of Thunder and Energy Ball, and Araquanid provides bulk while soaking up Fire-type attacks like Overheat from Ninetales under sun thanks to Water Bubble. Forretress removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin and provides slow pivoting for Slither Wing with Volt Switch to ensure safe entry.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks provides immense utility to Electric teams due to it being the premier entry hazard setter of the type, as well as its Ground-type STAB move threatening non-Air Balloon Heatran and Archaludon. Sandy Shocks also gives Electric teams breathing room against Fire teams due to Protosynthesis boosting its Speed, allowing it to outspeed the likes of Cinderace and Choice Scarf Ninetales. Volt Switch allows Sandy Shocks to pivot its teammates in safely. Stealth Rock is what makes Sandy Shocks valuable to Electric teams, as the chip damage wears down foes, potentially breaking Focus Sash and Sturdy from Pokemon like Ceruledge and Ogerpon-C. Sandy Shocks also benefits from Stealth Rock, as it is able to 2HKO Alolan Muk after Stealth Rock damage. In the fourth moveslot, Thunderbolt can be used as Sandy Shocks's primary STAB move in order to net more damage against foes, notably OHKOing Skarmory, which it cannot do with Volt Switch. Power Gem can be run as well to remove the likes of Volcarona, Moltres, and Ogerpon-H, although the latter is only a target when Sandy Shocks's Speed is boosted under sun. Additionally, Spikes can also be run so that Sandy Shocks can set more entry hazards, but running either attacking move in the fourth slot will be much better in the long run, since Spikes can be ignored by Flying-types as well as Levitate and Air Balloon users. The Special Attack EVs allow Sandy Shocks to almost certainly 2HKO Clodsire variants without heavy Special Attack investment. The EVs also make Protosynthesis boost Sandy Shocks's Speed.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks's entry hazard support is appreciated by a multitude of offensive teammates. Choice Specs users such as Zapdos and Magnezone greatly appreciate the hazards Sandy Shocks sets, as they allow them to better wallbreak. Notably, Zapdos takes out Grass- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss, Hydrapple, and Great Tusk, and Magnezone handles Fairy-types like Flutter Mane for Sandy Shocks. Iron Hands and Pawmot are additional beneficiaries of Sandy Shocks's hazards; Iron Hands also appreciates Sandy Shocks being able to remove Moltres, which can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. In return, Iron Hands and Pawmot can remove threats Sandy Shocks hates such as Chien-Pao and Greninja. Additionally, Shuca Berry Iron Hands is useful in the Ground matchup, and Pawmot has the additional benefit of reviving fallen teammates with Revival Blessing. Raging Bolt benefits from Sandy Shocks being able to remove some Clodsire variants; in return, Raging Bolt revenge kills speedy Water-types like Greninja, Barraskewda, and Keldeo. Rotom-W is another great teammate, as it spreads burns with Will-O-Wisp, provides a Ground immunity, and helps in both the Ground and Fire matchups. Lastly, Regieleki provides valuable hazard removal for the team, and it can spread paralysis via Thunder Wave so that Sandy Shocks outspeeds and threatens would-be faster threats like Greninja and Keldeo.</p>"

      "Gravity Utility (Ground)": {
        "description": "<p>Sandy Shocks is incredibly useful on any Ground team thanks to its ability to threaten common types that Ground struggles against, such as Steel and Water, by targeting Skarmory, Corviknight, and Pelipper and to the Gravity support it provides, which mainly benefits sand variants of Ground teams. With Gravity active, Sandy Shocks can hit popular Air Balloon users such as Heatran, Gholdengo, and Raging Bolt super effectively while ensuring Latios cannot switch in freely. Volt Switch coupled with Gravity epitomizes Sandy Shocks's role allowing for as a fast-paced pivot designed to make the opponent suffocating under the constant offensive pressure by safely bringing in wallbreakers like Choice Band Excadrill and Choice Scarf Great Tusk. The last slot leaves room for creativity. Thunderbolt gives Sandy Shocks a more offensive role in the Flying and Water matchups by OHKOing both Skarmory and Corviknight after Stealth Rock, while Power Gem prevents Volcarona from setting up on it. Alternatively, Spikes synergizes well with Gravity and can help chip down bulky foes like Hisuian Goodra. On teams without sand, Gravity can be replaced with any of the aforementioned moves, as these teams lack a fast wallbreaker comparable to Excadrill. An alternative EV spread of 48 HP / 208 SpA / 252 Spe can be used to boost Speed with Protosynthesis, allowing Sandy Shocks to answer sun teams offensively by outspeeding Cinderace, Protosynthesis Gouging Fire, and Ogerpon-H and 2HKOing them with Earth Power.</p> <p>Sandy Shocks pairs well with most Ground-type wallbreakers, such as Landorus, Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Great Tusk, as they appreciate Gravity support. With Gravity Sandy Shocks as a teammate, Landorus can either run a Choice Scarf set to surprise foes like Air Balloon Iron Treads or stick to Life Orb and run an extra coverage move or double down and keep Gravity. Landorus's versatility and impressive wallbreaking capabilities make it an excellent partner for Sandy Shocks by removing Grass-type threats, like Ogerpon-H and Ogerpon-W, from the field with Sludge Wave and OHKOing Volcarona with Rock Slide. On teams without sand, Choice Scarf Great Tusk synergizes well with Sandy Shocks, as its STAB move combination is nigh-unresisted with Gravity up, which, coupled with its decent Speed tier and great offensive power, ensures troublesome foes like Choice Specs Dragapult, Latios, and Flutter Mane succumb after Stealth Rock damage, making it a key asset in many matchups such as Ghost, Dragon, Fairy, and Flying. Mamoswine and Excadrill are both formidable wallbreakers that can use Gravity to their advantage to break through opposing teams, as Ground STAB is threatening to most of the tier, such as in the Steel, Dragon, Fairy, and Flying matchups. However, they contribute differently to the team, with Mamoswine taking advantage of the Ice- and Ground-type STAB move combination to delete any foe in the Flying and Dragon matchups, while Excadrill crushes opposing teams with Choice Band Earthquake in sand. Defensively, Sandy Shocks appreciates both physical and special walls like Hippowdon and Clodsire, which can tank physical hits from Gouging Fire and opposing Excadrill or absorb Water-type moves from Keldeo, respectively. They both also come with their own perks; Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock and phaze opposing Pokemon, while Clodsire provides Toxic Spikes or Toxic support, can deal with special setup sweepers with Haze, and can check Choice Specs Flutter Mane. On teams without sand, Gastrodon, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor make for great defensive teammates: Gastrodon can tank Ice Beam from Choice Specs Latios and Greninja while setting up entry hazards; Ting-Lu can set up both Spikes and Stealth Rock while phazing the enemy to wear down the opposing team thanks to its impressive mixed bulk; Gliscor supplements the defensive core on teams without sand through its Ground immunity, status immunity, and passive recovery.</p>"

      "Choice Band (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Iron Treads is a great addition on Steel teams, serving as a wallbreaker and leveraging its Ground typing and excellent coverage options to ease Fire, Electric, and Steel matchups. Earthquake targets Fire-, Electric-, and Steel-types like Torkoal, Raging Bolt, and Archaludon as well as Toxapex. Ice Spinner threatens Ground- and Dragon-types like the Landorus formes, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Hydreigon. Knock Off messes up would-be switch-ins like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Dondozo by removing their Leftovers, Rocky Helmet, and Heavy-Duty Boots, respectively, while also punishing spinblockers like Air Balloon Gholdengo and Dragapult. Supercell Slam OHKOes Primarina after minimal chip damage and 2HKOes foes like Skarmory and Slowbro, while Stone Edge secures an OHKO on Volcarona and Moltres. Rapid Spin can also be used in the last slot, allowing Iron Treads to support its teammates by removing entry hazards.</p> <p>Iron Treads's ability to offensively threaten Fire-types is greatly appreciated by many of its teammates. Skarmory and Corviknight are great partners for Iron Treads, boasting a Ground immunity and a Fighting neutrality, which allows them to take on foes like Excadrill, Great Tusk, and Sneasler. Skarmory also provides Spikes support, which, in conjunction with Iron Treads's Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers, weakens bulky foes like Great Tusk and Dondozo, while Corviknight provides U-turn support and serves as a Defogger. Gholdengo brings a crucial Fighting immunity to the team that allows it to handle foes like Iron Defense Zamazenta and mixed Iron Valiant. Iron Treads appreciates Gholdengo removing physical walls like Skarmory, Dondozo, and Slowbro and punishing switch-ins by paralyzing them; it can also equip itself with a Choice Scarf to serve as a revenge killer, cleaning up Ghost, Psychic, and Fighting teams late-game. In return, Iron Treads can eliminate special walls like Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Hisuian Goodra. Flash Fire Heatran can switch into special Fire-types like +1 Volcarona and Iron Moth, and it can absorb Will-O-Wisp from foes like Dragapult. Heatran also threatens Skarmory and Corviknight, which Iron Treads may struggle against, and serves a Stealth Rock setter. Hisuian Goodra, with incredible special bulk and partial Dragon typing, makes for an excellent teammate, being able to fend off attacks from the aforementioned Fire-types; Choice Scarf Heatran; and other special attackers like Choice Specs Greninja, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane. Archaludon serves as a physical wall, handling foes like the Ogerpon formes, +1 Gouging Fire, and Ceruledge while also providing Stealth Rock support. It can also utilize a Choice Scarf set to get a surprise KO on foes like Dragapult and Iron Valiant. Archaludon offers Thunder Wave support, slowing down Fire-types like +2 Ceruledge and Ogerpon-H for Iron Treads to revenge kill them in case Archaludon alone is not able to check them.</p>"

      "Offensive Utility (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Treads provides incredible utility for Steel teams thanks to its solid stat spread and great movepool. Ice Spinner helps to deal with major Ground-type threats, notably checking Landorus and Gliscor. Knock Off provides a way for Iron Treads to force progress by removing key items such as Gholdengo's Air Balloon or Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Air Balloon allows Iron Treads to come in safely on Ground-types like the aforementioned Landorus and Gliscor and threaten them out immediately. Alternatively, Leftovers can provide a bit of passive recovery, making use of Iron Treads's natural solid bulk, while Heavy-Duty Boots nullifies entry hazard damage, allowing it to come in and use Rapid Spin as many times as it wants.</p> <p>Skarmory provides a Ground immunity, allowing Iron Treads to forego using an Air Balloon against threats like Great Tusk, Hippowdon, and Excadrill; Iron Treads deals with Electric-types such as Raging Bolt and Magnezone in return. Archaludon provides a solid Water resistance, being able to handle threats such as Ogerpon-W, Empoleon, and Gyarados; it can also use Thunder Wave and Draco Meteor to deal with Gouging Fire. In return, Iron Treads removes entry hazards, which boosts Archaludon's longevity. Heatran provides a crucial Fire immunity from threats like Iron Moth, Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Ninetales. Gholdengo covers the last of Iron Treads's weaknesses thanks to its Ghost typing handling Fighting-type threats like Zamazenta, Sneasler, and Breloom; it can also use Thunderbolt to deal with Flying-types like Skarmory and Mandibuzz, which can prove problematic for Iron Treads. Kingambit and Scizor can use their priority to pick off faster targets like Flutter Mane, Mamoswine, Iron Valiant, and Iron Boulder, which can also cause issues for Iron Treads.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Iron Treads complements Ground team's defensive core with its Steel typing—which lets it deal with Fairy- and Ice-types such as Hatterene and Cryogonal— and provides further utility with Rapid Spin. Knock Off dissuades Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Skeledirge from spinblocking and potentially weakens Choice item users such as Meowscarada and Greninja after taking their hit, letting its teammates such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Clodsire handle them better. Heavy Slam smashes Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane, while Iron Head better deals with Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur. Protect lets Iron Treads scout common Choice item Pokemon such as Greninja, Flutter Mane, and Iron Valiant while accruing Leftovers recovery. A Jolly nature with 8 Speed EVs lets Iron Treads outspeed Adamant Baxcalibur and Timid Armarouge.</p> <p>Offensively-inclined teammates such as Choice Scarf Great Tusk, Choice Specs Sandy Shocks, and Garchomp appreciate Iron Treads removing entry hazards and checking Hatterene. In return, Great Tusk deals with Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Choice Specs Greninja; Sandy Shocks breaks down walls such as Corviknight and Skeledirge that take advantage of Iron Treads and is a great asset in the Fire matchup; and Garchomp deals with Water- and Dragon-types such as Barraskewda and Hydreigon. Ting-Lu wears down the opposing team with entry hazards + Whirlwind deals with Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur in a pinch, and runs Throat Chop and Taunt to stop setup threats such as Corviknight and Skeledirge that pose a threat to Ground teams. Water Absorb Clodsire and Gastrodon deals with Water-types such as Dondozo, Quaquaval, and Barraskewda as well as walling Meowscarada and Ice Beam Greninja, respectively, as long as Iron Treads keeps the field free of entry hazards. Alternatively, Clodsire can use Unaware instead to check most special attackers, including Volcarona, Rotom-C, and Gholdengo. Similarly, Unaware Quagsire checks physical setup sweepers such as Belly Drum Azumarill, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Swords Dance Chien-Pao and Mimikyu, and it further wears down the opposing team with Toxic and entry hazards.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Steel)": {
        "outdated": true,
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Iron Treads gives Steel teams a much appreciated revenge killer as well as counterplay against Fire-types such as Tauros-Paldea-Blaze and Volcarona, which can overwhelm Steel teams with ease. Heavy Slam utilizes Iron Treads's fairly hefty size to hit Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Mimikyu hard; however, Iron Head can be used as a more consistent STAB to nail heavier targets such as Chien-Pao, Baxcalibur, and Garganacl. Ice Spinner provides great coverage alongside Iron Treads's STAB moves, nailing Grass-types such as Meowscarada before Protean activates and Amoonguss while also nailing Garchomp and Dragonite. Knock Off provides good team support by getting rid of the foe's item, such as Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from the likes of Dragonite, Volcarona, and Garchomp, whereas Volt Switch allows Iron Treads to pivot out of Pokemon that wall it such as Corviknight and Dondozo.</p> <p>Corviknight is a fantastic partner for Iron Treads, as it can take Fighting- and Ground-type moves while Iron Treads takes on Electric-types such as Iron Hands and Magnezone for Corviknight. Corviknight can also keep entry hazards off the field with Defog, aiding in Iron Treads's longevity and letting it forgo Rapid Spin. Gholdengo is another great partner, as it not only also helps against Fighting-types that Corviknight can't handle such as Iron Valiant, but it also overwhelms physical walls such as Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Dondozo. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Tinkaton, Orthworm, and Bronzong also aid in Iron Treads sweeping. Tinkaton specifically ensures Stealth Rock being set due to Mold Breaker while having a decent offensive presence thanks to Gigaton Hammer being so powerful. Orthworm provides a Ground immunity, easing pressure off other teammates such as Corviknight, all while also having Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also take on Fire-type moves that are aimed at Iron Treads. Kingambit is a great mid- to late-game sweeper that appreciates Iron Treads's ability to punch holes early-game or clean up after Kingambit has punched holes itself, providing the team with multiple avenues of winning.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Ground)": {
        "outdated": true,
        "description": "<p>Iron Treads is a competent Choice Scarf user on Ground teams thanks to its Steel typing and solid offensive movepool; its Speed tier is also excellent, letting it outrun common Speed-boosting threats such as Swords Dance Garchomp after a Scale Shot as well as Choice Scarf Landorus and Ninetales, which its main competitors, Great Tusk and Landorus-T, cannot do. Iron Head is the default Steel-type STAB move, giving Iron Treads a consistently strong neutral attack for most Ground-immune Pokemon and letting it cleanly OHKO common attackers like Flutter Mane, Enamorus, and Chien-Pao outside of snow. However, Iron Head's damage can sometimes stop short of OHKOing important targets, most notably Ogerpon-C and Frosmoth in snow, so Heavy Slam is a viable alternative for more reliably dispatching them and scoring harder hits on certain defensive Pokemon, such as Clefable, Articuno, and Galarian Weezing. Ice Spinner is necessary coverage for common Flying- and Grass-types like Gliscor, Landorus, Dragonite, and Hydrapple, none of which are immediately threatened by Iron Treads's STAB combination; it also has the benefit of removing Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain, which can prove useful in the challenging Grass matchup. The last moveslot is a choice between extra coverage or momentum: Megahorn keeps Iron Treads from being walled by Ogerpon-W and scores a harder hit on many of Ice Spinner's targets, such as Latios and Meowscarada, while Volt Switch lets it pivot out of poor matchups and safely bring in frailer teammates like Landorus and Mamoswine; Iron Treads's decent Special Attack stat means Volt Switch can also sting some super effective targets like Pelipper and Gyarados, making them shakier checks. Knock Off is another option for the last slot to provide item-removing utility while still hitting useful targets like Latios and Air Balloon Gholdengo; however, its coverage pales in comparison to Megahorn.</p> <p>Iron Treads is Ground's weakest viable Choice Scarf user, so it appreciates entry hazard support to improve its capabilities as a revenge killer and offensive pivot. Since its most common switch-ins are Ground-immune, Stealth Rock is especially useful for it, and this can be reliably set up by teammates such as Great Tusk, which also has excellent set variety that lets it act as a hazard remover, Choice Band wallbreaker, or Bulk Up sweeper. Ting-Lu is another great hazard setter that also brings Spikes and incredible mixed bulk, letting it act as a sturdier check to Latios and other major threats; in return, Iron Treads provides speed control and helps Ting-Lu handle Fairy- and Bug-types like Flutter Mane, Hatterene, and Ribombee. Gliscor can stack hazards to accentuate Iron Treads's damage output while handling threatening Fighting-type attackers like Zamazenta; it can also run a Swords Dance set that's quite useful for breaking down bulkier foes like Ting-Lu and Amoonguss. Water Absorb Clodsire is a great teammate that can handle Fighting- and Water-types like Keldeo and Ogerpon-W, and it can stack Toxic Spikes to rack up even more chip damage for Iron Treads. Choice Band Mamoswine has amazing offensive synergy with Iron Treads, notably threatening some of Iron Treads's most solid checks, such as Corviknight and Braviary, with 2HKOs; its limited defensive profile means it also enjoys Volt Switch support. Ursaluna-B is a menacing special wallbreaker that can exploit stubborn physically defensive Pokemon like Pecharunt and Archaludon for Iron Treads's benefit, and Vacuum Wave lets it revenge kill some opposing Choice Scarf users that Iron Treads can't outspeed, such as Greninja and Roaring Moon. Landorus can provide Gravity support for Iron Treads and remove annoying checks like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Zamazenta. Swords Dance Garchomp is an incredibly dangerous setup sweeper that benefits from Iron Treads's assistance against Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Enamorus.</p>"

Drain Punch provides recovery, often offsetting much of the damage received. Thunder Punch targets Tornadus-T and Primarina, while Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types like Hatterene, Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Flutter Mane. The last slot is quite flexible and ultimately depends on Iron Hands's teammates; Ice Punch covers threats such as Landorus, Latios, and Dragapult, Earthquake deals with Gholdengo, and Volt Switch allows Iron Hands to keep momentum while neutralizing Ceruledge's Focus Sash.</p> <p>Great Tusk has great synergy with Iron Hands, as it can remove entry hazards from the field, set up Stealth Rock, and deal with Gouging Fire and Ceruledge, while Iron Hands can tank special hits from Greninja, Iron Valiant, and Primarina for Great Tusk's benefit. By virtue of its defensive role, Iron Hands appreciates wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant, Keldeo, and Urshifu-R. Thanks to its colorful movepool, Iron Valiant can easily break through opposing defensive cores in the Flying, Dragon, Steel, and Water matchups. Keldeo and Urshifu-R are both fantastic wallbreakers and can lead the way against Steel and Ground teams by deleting their defensive cores such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, Hippowdon, and Clodsire with the appropriate move combination. Sneasler and Okidogi are both great partners for Iron Hands, as they can prevent it from being poisoned and can ease the Fairy matchup by removing Iron Valiant, Azumarill, and Hatterene. Choice Scarf Sneasler deals with popular Choice Specs foes like Flutter Mane, whereas Okidogi can check opposing Sneasler. In return, Iron Hands can take special Psychic-type hits in their place and retaliate with a powerful move. Zamazenta reaps many benefits from Iron Hands, as Iron Hands can provide it with a free switch in thanks to Volt Switch, letting Choice Scarf and Choice Band variants delete opposing threats safely. Iron Hands can also dispose of opposing special attackers, making IronPress Zamazenta nigh-unstoppable.

Thunder Punch OHKOes Articuno and Corviknight after one Swords Dance. Ice Punch allows Iron Hands to threaten several Flying-types its STAB moves aren't very effective against, like both Landorus formes and Dragonite. Earthquake is an alternative option that allows Iron Hands to threaten several Steel- and Fire-types, OHKOing Gholdengo and 2HKOing Torkoal after one Swords Dance boost. With a Shuca Berry, Iron Hands can take STAB Ground-type attacks that could easily revenge kill it, such as Landorus's Earth Power and Choice Scarf Iron Treads's Earthquake. Using a Lum Berry allows Iron Hands to immediately cure status &amp; especially burn, which would otherwise weaken Iron Hands's wallbreaking capabilities. This also allows it to bypass Moltres's Flame Body and punish Sableye for attempting to burn it. 116 Defense EVs in tandem with Lum Berry allow Iron Hands to take a +2 Earthquake from Dragonite and Choice Band Iron Treads's Earthquake, as well as taking a little over 50% damage from Choice Scarf Meowscarada's Play Rough.

Agility can be used as an option over Substitute to allow Iron Moth to massively increase its Speed on forced switches, allowing it to blaze past and OHKO common Choice Scarf users such as Meowscarada, Greninja, and Hisuian Samurott and sweep with Fiery Dance boosts.</p> <h4>Poison (Choice Scarf)</h4> <p>Fiery Dance can be an alternative to Flamethrower, as it can boost Iron Moth's Special Attack; however, it is unable to claim OKHOs on threats such as Alolan Ninetales.</p>",

      "Choice Specs (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>Equipped with Choice Specs, Iron Moth turns into the best special wallbreaker on Poison teams. Flamethrower is a consistent Fire-type STAB move that allows Iron Moth to remove Corviknight and Skarmory. Alternatively, Fiery Dance, although having slightly less power than Flamethrower, can allow Iron Moth to snowball through teams that don't have a response to it thanks to the chance to boost its Special Attack after usage. Fire Blast, despite its lower accuracy provides higher power, which allows Iron Moth to OHKO specially defensive Jirachi and score a 2HKO on Alolan Muk and Clodsire. Discharge is great coverage, targeting threats that resist its Fire-type STAB moves such as Gyarados and Toxapex. Energy Ball nails threats like Swampert, Gastrodon, Garganacl, and Ursaluna-B that the previous two moves can't hit. Overheat is a strong nuke that can shred high-priority threats like Landorus, and it also has a chance to OHKO Gliscor after Stealth Rock damage. Dazzling Gleam can be used as coverage to threaten Dragon- and Dark-types like Raging Bolt and Hydreigon. However, by choosing to run Dazzling Gleam, Iron Moth forfeits its ability to nuke the aforementioned threats with Overheat.</p> <p>Because of Iron Moth's vulnerability to faster Water- and Ground-types, Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Galarian Weezing all synergize well with it. Both Toxapex and Amoonguss wall the likes of Ogerpon-W and Barraskewda. Additionally, Toxapex handles both Choice Scarf Kleavor and Hisuian Arcanine, as well as Chien-Pao, and threatens them back, while Amoonguss can inflict Spore to give Iron Moth safe switch-ins as well as threaten Choice Band Excadrill with Foul Play. Galarian Weezing causes trouble for Dragon- and Ground-types like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, Choice Scarf Great Tusk, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T thanks to Levitate and Will-O-Wisp. Galarian Weezing also serves as entry hazard removal for Iron Moth with Defog. Galarian Slowking and Alolan Muk both handle Psychic-types like Latios, Latias, and Indeedee that threaten Iron Moth. Galarian Slowking has the added benefit of taking on Heatran and opposing Iron Moth, as well as pressuring foes with Future Sight, while Alolan Muk halts Galarian Slowking. In return, Iron Moth checks slower Ground-types that threaten them like Mamoswine and Iron Treads. Pecharunt threatens both Azumarill and Gouging Fire for Iron Moth, as well as bringing it in safely with Parting Shot thanks to its low Speed. In return, Iron Moth removes Nasty Plot Hydreigon for Pecharunt with Dazzling Gleam. Entry hazard support from the likes of Clodsire and Overqwil aids in Iron Moth's wallbreaking. Clodsire also deals with Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona, while Overqwil slows down Iron Boulder and Choice Scarf Gallade, which threaten to OHKO Iron Moth. Glimmora is a great teammate for Iron Moth, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock to aid Iron Moth's wallbreaking, remove hazards with Mortal Spin, and spread poison with Toxic, even against opposing Poison-types if it's running Corrosion. Choice Scarf Glimmora outspeeds and threatens non-Air Balloon Heatran, Chien-Pao, and unboosted Roaring Moon, which all threaten Iron Moth. In return, Iron Moth threatens Steel-types for Glimmora like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Iron Moth and Okidogi form a strong wallbreaking core, with Iron Moth removing Corviknight, Amoonguss, and Swampert, while Okidogi removes Hisuian Goodra, Heatran, and Kingambit. Choice Scarf Sneasler not only threatens faster foes like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Choice Scarf Iron Treads, but it can also bring Iron Moth in with U-turn against Sableye and can spread status with Dire Claw to aid Iron Moth's wallbreaking.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Moth is an offensive powerhouse and potent revenge killer on Poison teams thanks to its high Speed, great Special Attack, and wide movepool. Flamethrower melts through Steel-types such as Corviknight, Scizor, and Gholdengo that its teammates are unable to handle. Discharge eviscerates Flying- and Water-types like Talonflame, Pelipper, and physically defensive Toxapex. Dazzling Gleam fells the mighty Dark- and Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Sableye, and Dragapult. U-turn allows Iron Moth to safely pivot out of unfavorable matchups against threats like Flash Fire Heatran, Clodsire, and Alolan Muk. Alternatively, Energy Ball checks Ground-types such as Swampert, Great Tusk, and Sandy Shocks.</p> <p>Sneasler and Okidogi pair well with Iron Moth, as they can take on specially defensive walls such as Alolan Muk, Blissey, and Hisuian Goodra, which Iron Moth can't break. They can also eliminate threats like Flash Fire Heatran and Tyranitar while appreciating Iron Moth's ability to remove threats like Sableye and Talonflame, which cause them significant issues. Galarian Weezing can use Defog to remove entry hazards and spread burn with Will-O-Wisp. Furthermore, it can provide safe entry as well as check Ground-types like defensive Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Clodsire thanks to Levitate. Amoonguss can deal with Water- and Ground-types that threaten Iron Moth such as Barraskewda, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon while also being able to use Spore to put threats to sleep, giving Iron Moth safe entry. Physically bulky Toxapex handles threats like Lokix and Mimikyu, which can use their powerful priority moves like Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak, respectively, to remove Iron Moth; it also helps to check threats like Keldeo, Kleavor, and Araquanid. Alolan Muk takes on Psychic- and Ghost-type threats such as Hatterene, Espathra, Flutter Mane, and Spectrier. Overqwil provides assistance to Iron Moth by taking on Gallade and Iron Boulder along with being able to lay Spikes to chip down special walls such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Clodsire can set Stealth Rock along with being able to remove opposing threats like Volcarona and Heatran.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Fire)": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Moth establishes itself as a premier Choice Scarf user on Fire teams, boosting its already good Speed stat in order to act as speed control to immediately threaten Pokemon such as Chien-Pao and Greninja as well as a late-game cleaner. Its wide array of coverage options, good STAB combination, and very high Special Attack make it a difficult Pokemon to answer. Dazzling Gleam allows Iron Moth to hit Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Hydreigon, while Discharge and Energy Ball both provide coverage against Water-types; Discharge covers targets neutral to Energy Ball such as Toxapex and Pelipper, while Energy Ball is stronger and also hits Water/Ground types such as Gastrodon and Quagsire. U-turn forgoes a coverage move in order to allow Iron Moth to maintain momentum even when it cannot break through a team. Fiery Dance can be run instead of Flamethrower, forgoing a bit of power and burn chance in exchange for the potential to snowball into a sweep.</p> <p>Iron Moth pairs well with wallbreakers that can open holes for it such as Scovillain and Hisuian Arcanine. The former aids with bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Gastrodon that may give Iron Moth trouble depending on its coverage, while the latter appreciates Iron Moth's speed control and potential pivoting capabilities to destroy problematic Fire-types and special walls, including Skeledirge and Hisuian Goodra. Torkoal provides Stealth Rock, status, and Rapid Spin support as well as powering up Iron Moth's Flamethrower with the sun. Paldean Tauros-F can threaten Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Heatran that wall Iron Moth, while Iron Moth can discourage faster Pokemon such as Greninja and Iron Treads from switching in—neither of which Paldean Tauros-F wants to take on. Volcarona can aid Iron Moth in wearing down a team, as both Pokemon can make progress to help the other break through; additionally, Volcarona can heavily damage Psychic- and Dark- types such as Espathra and Ting-Lu that can give Iron Moth trouble. Finally, Iron Moth's bad bulk makes pivoting support from Cinderace, Talonflame, and Moltres appreciated to help it get in easier; Cinderace can also provide hazard control with Court Change, while Talonflame can achieve the same with Defog.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute + Three Attacks (Poison)": {
        "description": "<p>With a pair of Heavy-Duty Boots, Iron Moth can switch in safely on entry hazards and go to town. It can easily set up a Substitute on foes such as Articuno, Moltres, and Amoonguss or predicted Sucker Punches from the likes of Kingambit to begin causing havoc while being safe from strong attacks. Fiery Dance pairs nicely with Substitute to give Iron Moth plenty of chances to boost up its Special Attack. However, Flamethrower is more consistent, being able to reliably OHKO Alolan Ninetales and fast Kingambit. Either Fire-type STAB melts Steel- and Ice-type threats like Corviknight, Scizor and Frosmoth. Discharge shocks Water-type switch-ins like Toxapex, Empoleon, and Azumarill, along with scaring Flying-types like Moltres and Enamorus out. Energy Ball gives Iron Moth the ability to threaten all Water-types with the exception of Ogerpon-W by hitting Quagsire and Rotom-W, along with blasting through Ground- and Rock-types like Ursaluna-B, Mamoswine, and Garganacl.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing's immunity to Ground-type attacks and high physical bulk make it an invaluable partner for Iron Moth, enabling it to safely come in against monsters like Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine and threaten them out with the fear of Will-O-Wisp burns, and in return Iron Moth threatens Steel-types like Corviknight and Gholdengo. Physically defensive Amoonguss's Grass typing lets it take on many of the Water- and Ground-type threats Iron Moth is typically scared of like Urshifu-R, Quaquaval, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads with its STAB attacks. Spore also creates opportunities for Iron Moth to safely switch in and set up Substitute. Physically defensive Toxapex handles faster threats and Fire-types like Chien-Pao, Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, and Ceruledge with its STAB Surf and Haze. Alolan Muk's incredible special bulk and ability to handle threatening Ghost-, Dark- and Psychic-type threats like Flutter Mane, Spectrier, Greninja, Darkrai, and Espathra is invaluable. Overqwil can deal with Psychic-types like Galarian Slowking, Hatterene, and Espathra while setting Spikes, which Iron Moth can use to add to its offensive pressure and Fiery Dance sweeping potential. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking serves as another incredible special wall, being able to threaten out foes such as Kommo-o, Volcarona, and opposing Iron Moth. Galarian Slowking can further use STAB Future Sight to set traps to catch opposing switch-ins to Iron Moth such as Iron Hands and Clodsire. Water Absorb Clodsire handles Fire-types that would switch into Iron Moth's STAB moves like Ninetales and Volcanion with STAB Earthquake. It can also use Unaware to check Volcarona and set up Stealth Rock to pressure Fire-types. Glimmora can also set Stealth Rock and threaten out Fire-types like Talonflame and Skeledirge with its STAB Power Gem and Heatran with Earth Power, and using Corrosion, it can ruin special walls like Alolan Muk, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire with Toxic. Sneasler's higher base Speed and STAB moves can allow it to blast through threats like Choice Specs Iron Valiant, Heatran, the Ogerpon formes, and Kingambit. Alternatively, Sneasler can use a Choice Scarf to outspeed and remove Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur even after it gets a Speed boost while using Switcheroo to mess up walls like Clodsire. Okidogi can remove threats like Kingambit, Heatran and Ogerpon-C while softening up other threats such as Toxapex and Clodsire with Knock Off.</p>"

  "Gholdengo": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Ghost</h4> <p>Gholdengo's flexible statline gives it the ability to deal with a lot of other threats if it wishes to. For instance, 224 Speed EVs can be invested to outrun Adamant Choice Band Mamoswine, which Ghost teams don't have a defensive answer to. A spread of 252 HP / 108 Def / 84 SpD / 64 Spe with either of the prescribed natures lets Gholdengo survive a hit from non-Choice Band Chien-Pao and Expert Belt Flutter Mane and OHKO back while still being able to outspeed Jolly Azumarill. Hex in conjunction with Thunder Wave is decent in supporting team mates, notably outright OHKOing Gliscor at +2 if running a Modest nature. However, Steel-type coverage is usually more useful, and Ghost has no shortage of Pokemon that inflict status. Focus Blast is also notable, as Gholdengo is not OHKOed by fully Supreme Overlord-boosted Sucker Punch from Kingambit and OHKOes it back with that move. However, this move has low PP and has a big chance to miss. Rocky Helmet is great to wear down and punish physical attackers like Urshifu-R and Iron Hands, but the Ground immunity of Air Balloon is almost too good to pass up on.</p> <h4>Steel</h4> <p>Thunderbolt can be run over Trick to hurt Barraskewda and Urshifu-R, but doing so would prevent Gholdengo from Choice-locking walls with Trick. Recover lets Gholdengo maintain health after giving a foe its Choice Scarf with Trick, but it is hard to fit since using Trick is an uncommon scenario to begin with. Psyshock allows Gholdengo to take on Iron Moth and Keldeo, which can be problematic for Steel teams.</p>",

      "Thunder Wave (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Thunder Wave Gholdengo is an incredibly disruptive support Pokemon thanks to its phenomenal typing, ability, and array of utility moves. Thunder Wave can cripple Pokemon that would otherwise give Steel teams a very hard time, such as Keldeo, Primarina, and Zamazenta. Hex 2HKOes paralyzed foes like physically defensive Corviknight, Keldeo, and Assault Vest Gallade. Make It Rain allows Gholdengo to apply immediate pressure on targets such as Hatterene, Kyurem, and Garganacl. The given EV spread allows Gholdengo to outspeed Adamant Scizor, 2HKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T, and survive a Choice Scarf Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> <p>Skarmory is an excellent teammate for Gholdengo, as it can switch into Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Excadrill as well as a myriad of physical attacks from Pokemon such as Roaring Moon and Hisuian Samurott. In return, Gholdengo can make sure that Skarmory's entry hazards stay on the field thanks to its hazard removal immunity. Hisuian Goodra can switch into strong special attacks from Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Darkrai. In return, Gholdengo can switch into Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon such as Zamazenta and Sneasler that would otherwise make quick work of Hisuian Goodra. Air Balloon Heatran is able to switch into Fire- and Ground-type attacks from Pokemon such as Gouging Fire, Volcarona, and opposing Heatran. Gholdengo's speed control via Thunder Wave allows Heatran to have an easier time in an offensive role, as it outspeeds Pokemon such as Kyurem and Latios while they are paralyzed. Archaludon can tank physical attacks from foes such as the Ogerpon formes, Meowscarada, and Bisharp. Archaludon can also apply pressure to Dark- and Dragon-types via Body Press and Draco Meteor. Iron Treads can use its solid Speed stat to threaten Fire-types and special walls that Gholdengo cannot break through, such as Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Hisuian Goodra. Gholdengo can utilize Good as Gold to switch into moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Defog, allowing Iron Treads to have an easier time serving as a wallbreaker. Scizor is a phenomenal wallbreaker that can help Gholdengo deal with some of its best counters in Ting-Lu and Flutter Mane. In return, Gholdengo can switch into strong physical walls that Scizor cannot beat, such as Zamazenta and Dondozo.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Gholdengo is a good Choice Scarf user on Steel teams due to its decent Speed, great Special Attack, and ability to take out Iron Valiant and Chien-Pao. Make It Rain is Gholdengo's strongest STAB move and can take out Mamoswine and Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark. Shadow Ball threatens Ghost-types like Choice Specs Dragapult and Spectrier, whereas Trick allows it to Choice-lock walls like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Corviknight. Focus Blast helps against Steel-, Dark-, Normal-, and Rock-types like Kingambit, Choice Specs Greninja, Ursaluna-B, and Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine.</p> <p>Skarmory is a great wall to pair with Gholdengo since it can set entry hazards with Spikes and check physical threats like Excadrill, Meowscarada, and Chien-Pao with Body Press. While Skarmory is also valuable due to its Ground Immunity, it appreciates Gholdengo's ability to absorb status moves for Skarmory with Good as Gold. Hisuian Goodra is a great special wall that is able to tank hits from Choice Specs users like Flutter Mane and Greninja, which Gholdengo appreciates. In return, Gholdengo takes out mixed attacker Iron Valiant for Hisuian Goodra. Air Balloon Heatran is essential for Steel teams due to its Fire immunity and is able to take out threats like Iron Moth and Gouging Fire with Earth Power. Heatran can also provide support with Stealth Rock and Taunt to help Gholdengo sweep late-game. Swords Dance Kingambit is a fierce setup sweeper to pair with Gholdengo, as it is able to turn the tide of a losing match by taking out threats like Ting-Lu and Hisuian Goodra with Low Kick. Iron Treads helps in the Steel mirror and Fire matchup by checking Hisuian Goodra, Ceruledge, and Hisuian Arcanine. Iron Treads also provides support with Rapid Spin. Archaludon is a strong wall that provides Thunder Wave support to paralyze Pokemon that threaten Gholdengo like the Ogerpon formes and Dragonite. After using Swords Dance, Scizor takes out Belly Drum Azumarill and Ursaluna-B with Bullet Punch and Close Combat, respectively. Sneasler also utilizes Gholdengo's Trick to set up on a Choice-locked Pokemon. Excadrill provides utility with Rapid Spin while also threatening checks like Alolan Muk and Iron Hands with Earthquake. All of Gholdengo's teammates appreciate its Fighting immunity and ability to take out the aforementioned Iron Valiant and Mamoswine.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot (Steel)": {
        "description": "<p>Boasting an impressive Special Attack stat, Gholdengo provides Steel teams with a fantastic special attacker, which are scarce on said type. Nasty Plot lets Gholdengo overwhelm walls such as Gastrodon and Amoonguss. Shadow Ball is a fantastic STAB move that has great neutral coverage and allows Gholdengo to threaten Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Gallade. Focus Blast hits Dark-types that resist Shadow Ball like Kingambit and Ting-Lu. A single Nasty Plot boost enables Gholdengo's Focus Blast to OHKO physically defensive Ting-Lu after a layer of Spikes. The last slot is extremely flexible; Make It Rain is a powerful STAB move that hits harder than Shadow Ball against Dark-types like Grimmsnarl and Fairy-types such as Hatterene and Azumarill. Substitute can be used instead to give Gholdengo some security against faster threats that can take it out such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Recover is also another option to keep Gholdengo healthy, since it can be worn down fairly easily. Good as Gold allows Gholdengo to switch into status-using Pokemon like Sableye and Grimmsnarl, allowing Gholdengo to set up on them. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to switch into Pokemon like Great Tusk and Clodsire with ease as well as avoid Spikes as long as it stays intact. This allows Gholdengo to be a decent spinblocker as well.</p> <p>Kingambit is a fantastic partner, as it not only resists Dark-type moves directed at Gholdengo, but it also has STAB priority in Sucker Punch to threaten opposing Ghost-types that can take out Gholdengo such as Dragapult and Flutter Mane. Kingambit also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take on Breloom so as to not be revenge killed. Scizor appreciates Gholdengo's ability to take care of physical walls, allowing it to clean up with STAB Bullet Punch. Scizor can also pivot into Gholdengo on physical walls such as Skeledirge, allowing Gholdengo to threaten the opposing Pokemon easier. Nasty Plot Lucario is another fantastic partner thanks to its ability to get rid of Dark-types for Gholdengo and pressure special walls. Choice Scarf Iron Treads also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to break physical walls such as opposing Corviknight and Great Tusk early-game so that it can sweep late-game. Dual screens support from Klefki allows Gholdengo to have an easier time setting up and potentially sweeping. Another good partner for Gholdengo is Corviknight, as it removes entry hazards while also providing a Ground immunity once Air Balloon is gone. Corviknight can also run a Bulk Up or Iron Defense set that appreciates Pokemon like Skeledirge being taken care of while helping Gholdengo have an easier time breaking stall. Orthworm is another good choice, as it provides Shed Tail support as well as having access to Spikes and Stealth Rock. Bronzong is also an amazing partner as well, as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also tank Fire-type moves thanks to Heatproof.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a bulky setup sweeper for Ghost teams, leveraging its stellar typing and fantastic stats to break down walls such as Articuno, Hisuian Goodra lacking Flamethrower, and Corviknight, which Ghost teams struggle with. Its ability, Good as Gold blocks status moves such as Encore from Sableye and phazing from Empoleon, heavily aiding Gholdengo as a setup sweeper. Make It Rain's extra power makes it a notable option over Flash Cannon, as it OHKOes Ursaluna-B and Articuno at +2 and will always OHKO Flutter Mane. However, it can be stalled out by Pressure, and the Special Attack drop can provide setup opportunities for enemies such as Azumarill and Gliscor. Alternatively, Flash Cannon provides a less strong but more reliable STAB move that is extremely helpful in the Fairy and Ice matchup. 104 Speed EVs let Gholdengo outspeed threats like Adamant Scizor and Jolly Azumarill and most walls, including uninvested Gliscor and Articuno. A Bold nature prevents Alolan Muk from 2HKOing Gholdengo before the Air Balloon breaks, while a Modest nature provides Gholdengo with more favorable damage calculations, namely giving it a chance to OHKO Gliscor and Galarian Moltres with +2 Make It Rain and Scizor with a boosted Shadow Ball and knocking out Alolan Muk over two turns with Make It Rain after a Nasty Plot. An Air Balloon lets Gholdengo provide a unique defensive niche, walling out a lot of Ground-types like Gliscor variants with no attacking moves besides Earthquake, Landorus, and Quagsire as long as it isn't popped, protecting Gholdengo from Poltergeist users such as Brambleghast once the item is popped, and also making it a generally safe switch-in to block Mortal Spin from Earth Power Glimmora.</p> <p>Flutter Mane and Nasty Plot Spectrier appreciate Gholdengo's wallbreaking ability to remove roadblocks like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Articuno. In return, Gholdengo is able to take a hit from non-Choice Band Chien-Pao and OHKO it back for its teammates. In return, Flutter Mane and Spectrier both act as cleaners and deal with faster-paced matchups like Fighting and Ghost for Gholdengo. Both are also able to remove Dark-types like Greninja, while Spectrier can lure and incapacitate Dark-types like Roaring Moon if using a Colbur Berry. Flutter Mane can also don a Choice Scarf, to deal with Dragapult and Chien-Pao. Gholdengo's vulnerability to Water- and Fire-type coverage is notable, so teammates like Sinistcha to readily deal with Dondozo and Skeledirge to take on Gastrodon and Volcarona benefit Gholdengo. Skeledirge, especially with Earth Power, puts in work in the Steel and Fire matchup, while Sinistcha helps in the Ground matchup, which Gholdengo does not fare well against. Both also have the ability to inflict burn on key walls like Alolan Muk, Clodsire, and Iron Hands, making it easier for Gholdengo to set up. Ceruledge is an exceptional teammate, as it deals with Gholdengo's nemesis, Heatran, and also put in work on matchups like Steel and Fire. Spikes support from Froslass and Brambleghast is also great, as this synergizes with Gholdengo's ability to block Defog; Froslass also is fast enough to deal with Landorus, while Brambleghast's entry hazard removal is rare on Ghost and is appreciated once Gholdengo's Air Balloon gets popped. Dragapult's great Speed tier enables it to fend off Choice Specs Flutter Mane or Choice Scarf Roaring Moon when equipped with a Choice Specs or Choice Scarf of its own, and it can pivot Gholdengo in against walls like Clodsire with U-turn, as well as burn Alolan Muk, Iron Hands, and Ting-Lu for it. Dragapult can also run a Choice Band set, allowing it to 2HKO Alolan Muk as well as take out opposing Ghost-types with Sucker Punch, or even a Dragon Dance set to threaten walls such as Clodsire that bother Gholdengo. Choice Scarf Hisuian Zoroark takes advantage of Gholdengo's Speed tier and typing with Illusion, luring and removing threats like Hisuian Samurott while also being able to eliminate Hoopa-U with U-turn. It is also able to lure in and heavily damage Ghost-types like Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Spectrier, which use their Ghost-type coverage to defeat Gholdengo. Mimikyu can serve as a check to threats like Hoopa-U and Hydreigon as well as a one-time answer to Darkrai, Greninja, and Chien-Pao using Disguise. In return Gholdengo takes on Corviknight, Iron Defense Iron Treads, and Galarian Weezing.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill threats such as Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao lacking Sucker Punch, and Dragapult, come into status-spreading Pokemon such as Klefki and Breloom due to Good as Gold, and inconvenience bulkier teams by preventing all forms of entry hazard removal with its ability and typing make it a prime pick for Ghost teams. Make It Rain greatly weakens Dark- and Normal-types such as Hydreigon and Indeedee, and it OHKOes Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Chien-Pao. Shadow Ball lets Gholdengo clean types such as Psychic and Ghost late-game. Trick neutralizes defensive pivots such as Corviknight, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire, which typically switch into it. The last move of choice is dependent on what the Ghost team lacks; Focus Blast gives the team another way to defeat Choice Specs Greninja, Thunderbolt cleans Water- and Flying-teams, or Nasty Plot which turns Gholdengo into a massive threat against bulkier teams especially after their main specially defensive wall has been given a Choice Scarf with Trick.</p> <p>As Gholdengo provides the needed revenge killing capabilities on Ghost teams, teammates such as Flutter Mane and Dragapult are free to run sets like Choice Specs and Dragon Dance, respectively. Both also break down walls such as Clodsire and Gastrodon; in return, Gholdengo deals with Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Gallade. Skeledirge walls most physical attackers and Fire-types such as Scovillain and Volcarona. Mimikyu provides a safety net against offensive types like rain Water and Ghost, checking Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane for the team, and it loves Gholdengo shutting down defensive walls such as Toxapex with Trick. Entry hazard setters in Brambleghast and Froslass are is also greatly appreciated, as they can set, remove, or prevent entry hazards for Gholdengo; in return, Gholdengo prevents their entry hazards from getting removed by Glimmora. Brambleghast also switches into Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk and deals with Water-types like Gastrodon and Dondozo, while Froslass can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave and bring down an opposing Pokemon with its Destiny Bond.</p>"

Heavy Slam hits Fairy-types that would otherwise overpower Ting-Lu, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant, while also threatening Hatterene trying to bounce back hazards. Stealth Rock and Spikes allow Ting-Lu to support wallbreakers such as Meowscarada or Greninja. Whirlwind allows Ting-Lu to phase out setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Curse Dondozo and rack up entry hazard damage, while Ruination provides consistent damage against other walls such as Amoonguss and Corviknight that don't mind any of Ting-Lu's other moves.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Greninja all appreciate Ting-Lu's ability to set entry hazards, as they wear down common defensive answers such as Toxapex, Iron Treads, and Dondozo. In return, they can scare out threats to Ting-Lu; Meowscarada can deal with Greninja, Chien-Pao and Greninja can threaten Great Tusk, and Kingambit can force out Fairy-types such as Hatterene. Skuntank is a good partner as well, since it offers a crucial neutrality to Fairy, threatens Fairy-types, and sets and clears Toxic Spikes, augmenting Ting-Lu's entry hazards and improving its longevity. Additionally, Skuntank can utilize Fire Spin to further chip down teams and trap Klefki, improving Ting-Lu's matchup against Fairy. In return, Ting-Lu can assist in Ground matchups through its bulk.

Ruination allows Ting-Lu to quickly wear down the likes of opposing Ting-Lu, Hatterene, and Dragonite, while Body Press may be used to deal more damage to Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Hydreigon. Spikes or Stealth Rock in conjunction with Whirlwind sets Ting-Lu apart from other entry hazard setters; it's capable of wearing down the opponent's defensive core and weakens threats such as Greninja, Meowscarada, and Baxcalibur. Additionally, Whirlwind phazes threatening sweepers like Scizor and Ceruledge.</p> <p>Ting-Lu's entry hazards are heavily appreciated by Great Tusk, which threatens out Choice Specs Flutter Mane, Gallade, and Greninja; Sandy Shocks, which deals with Water-types like Pelipper, Quaquaval, and Dondozo; and Garchomp, which threatens Corviknight, Rotom-C, and Breloom with its Fire-type coverage. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Great Tusk removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Sableye and Brambleghast via Knock Off to enhance Ting-Lu's phazing, which enables Clodsire and Gastrodon as entry hazard setters to wither down threats such as Greninja and Ceruledge more efficiently. Water Absorb Clodsire adds a Water immunity, can switch into attacks from Greninja, Quaquaval, and Meowscarada, and helps wear down the opposing team with Toxic Spikes or Toxic. Gastrodon walls Water-type Pokemon like Pelipper, Dondozo, and Rotom-W and assists with spreading entry hazards. Iron Treads eases Ting-Lu's pivoting by removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin and checks Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Hatterene. Quagsire stalls out physical setup sweepers such as Mimikyu, Chien-Pao, and Iron Hands and also helps wear down defensive cores using Toxic.</p>"

Jaw Lock is able to trap bulky Pokemon on switching in, such as Toxapex and Gliscor, and then Roaring Moon can afflict them with Taunt in order to prevent them from using Haze or Toxic to stop it, thus making them ideal targets to set up on. Shed Shell is used because Jaw Lock traps the user as well, allowing Roaring Moon to freely switch out if it traps an unideal target. The given alternate EV spread allows Roaring Moon to outspeed Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Gholdengo at +1 while also allowing it to beat Gliscor one-on-one. Iron Head can also be used over Roost and Taunt in order to defeat Pokemon that can easily deal with Knock Off and Earthquake such as Galarian Weezing and Iron Valiant.</p>",

Iron Head allows Roaring Moon to combat Fairy-type Pokemon that are able to switch into both of its STAB moves such as Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Alolan Ninetales. U-turn allows Roaring Moon to retain momentum in battles by pivoting out of common switch-ins such as Skarmory, Hippowdon, and the aforementioned Corviknight.</p> <p>Choice Specs Kyurem forms a great offensive core with Roaring Moon, as it can reliably take out Pokemon that switch into Roaring Moon easily, such as the aforementioned Steel- and Ground-type physical walls in Skarmory, Corviknight, Great Tusk, and Hippowdon. In return, Roaring Moon grants Kyurem safe entry against passive Pokemon with U-turn while also taking out faster Fairy-type threats such as Flutter Mane and Iron Valiant. Archaludon is a great defensive teammate for Roaring Moon, as it is able to sponge physical attacks from Ogerpon-H, Meowscarada, and Scizor, while Roaring Moon is able to take out threatening special attackers that can take advantage of Archaludon like Gholdengo. Archaludon also provides entry hazard support in Stealth Rock while also threatening Chien-Pao and Kingambit with Body Press. Dragapult is another offensive teammate capable of spreading status in Will-O-Wisp, neutering threats such as offensive Great Tusk and Zamazenta, which alleviates pressure on Roaring Moon's breaking capabilities. Hisuian Goodra is another defensive teammate that pairs well with Roaring Moon, as it can readily take special Ice- and Fairy-type attacks from speedier threats like Choice Scarf Greninja and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane while also being able to phaze setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Dragapult with Dragon Tail. Gouging Fire in tandem with Roaring Moon work together to sweep opposing teams, whether it be Roaring Moon removing items and weakening foes for Gouging Fire to clean up or Gouging Fire setting up early and breaking through teams to allow Roaring Moon to sweep with the appropriate coverage late-game.</p>"

Earthquake allows Roaring Moon to hit defensive foes that can otherwise wall it even at +1, such as Toxapex and Torkoal.

Sableye, in tandem with Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp, is able to help make progress against bulky Pokemon that generally shrug off Roaring Moon's attacks such as Skarmory and Corviknight while also providing an invaluable Fighting immunity. Additionally, Prankster paired with Encore allows Sableye to deny setup sweepers such as Iron Defense + Body Press Zamazenta and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire. Choice Scarf Meowscarada is able to outspeed the likes of Dragapult and Choice Scarf Latios and OHKO them with Knock Off to alleviate pressure on Roaring Moon. Choice Specs Greninja, with its plethora of coverage options, aids the Fighting-, Dragon-, Ground-, and Flying-type matchups, which Roaring Moon can struggle with immensely on its own. Mandibuzz is another defensive option that pairs well with Roaring Moon, as it is the only consistent hazard removal that Dark teams have access to, which prevents Roaring Moon from getting chipped down over time while also providing pivoting through U-turn to allow Roaring Moon's safe entry if need be. Alolan Muk can be paired with Roaring Moon to help deal with strong Fairy-types such as Primarina and Choice Specs Iron Valiant. Bisharp is a necessary teammate, as it is able to handle Fairy-types that can neutralize Roaring Moon before a boost such as Flutter Mane and Hatterene, while Roaring Moon can deal with Fire-type Pokemon that threaten Bisharp such as non-Air Balloon Heatran and unboosted Gouging Fire. Lastly, Weavile can help weaken Ground-type foes that can wall Roaring Moon such as Hippowdon and Great Tusk while also revenge killing Dragonite and Meowscarada with Ice Shard, thus giving Roaring Moon more room to set up.</p>"

One of Iron Valiant's best qualities for Fairy teams is its access to Fighting-type STAB moves to counter Steel-types.

Energy Ball is a good alternative to more easily beat specially defensive Gastrodon and Rotom-W, but Grass Knot is an option to beat Dondozo after Spikes. Psyshock is a good tool versus Poison-types like Clodsire, Iron Moth and Amoonguss, while Shadow Ball lets it hit Skeledirge and Gholdengo that otherwise wall Iron Valiant. Trick is another great option to hinder defensive switch-ins like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clodsire if Iron Valiant forgoes the moves to deal with them.

Klefki is also a good switch-in against opposing Fairy-types like Mimikyu. Flutter Mane and Mimikyu can weaken teams to let Iron Valiant clean up or they can clean up after it. They also deal with Ghost-types such as Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Skeledirge if it forgoes Shadow Ball. Azumarill checks Fire-types such as Paldean Tauros-F, Volcarona, and Iron Moth and Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Clodsire.

Shadow Sneak can be run instead of Trick to check Flutter Mane, Gengar, and Will-O-Wisp Dragapult, while Spirit Break deals with Mandibuzz and Sableye. Ice Punch deals with Flying-, Ground-, and Dragon-types like Gliscor, Landorus, Clodsire, and Dragonite.</p> <p>Klefki is a great teammate for Iron Valiant, providing a Poison immunity, dual screens, and entry hazards.

Futhermore, Klefki provides Thunder Wave support to paralyze threats like Flutter Mane and Dragapult so Iron Valiant can take them out more easily with Knock Off. In return, Iron Valiant takes out foes like Mamoswine and Gliscor for Klefki. Belly Drum Azumarill is a great sweeper to pair with Iron Valiant, as it can remove threats like Moltres, Amoonguss, and Ogerpon-H.

Draco Meteor OHKOes Dragon-types like Archaludon, Kommo-o, and Hydreigon and deals with troublesome Water-type answers such as Toxapex, Sinistcha, Volcanion, and Gastrodon. Hydro Pump offers a powerful Water-type STAB attack to hit Steel- and Fairy-types like Gholdengo, Clefable, Kingambit, and Heatran as well as OHKOes Volcarona after a Quiver Dance. Scald offers a reliable Water-type STAB attack due to its accuracy and ability to potentially burn switch-ins such as Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Snorlax, while Flip Turn provides Walking Wake with a pivoting move, reducing the need to predict and also maintaining momentum in a match. Alternatively, Hydro Steam not only is reliable accuracy-wise but also aids against sun Fire teams, tearing through every Pokemon barring Volcanion in conjunction with Protosynthesis. Flamethrower may be used instead to threaten the aforementioned Steel-types as well as Ice- and Grass-types such as Alolan Ninetales, Frosmoth, and Amoonguss The given EV spread ensures that Protosynthesis always give a Speed boost under sun, allowing Walking Wake to outpace threats like Ogerpon-H and Choice Scarf Ninetales.</p> <p>Empoleon offers a resistance to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks, walling opposing Walking Wake, Flutter Mane, Hydreigon, and Alolan Ninetales. Furthermore, Empoleon has a notable Freeze-Dry neutrality and provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support to wear down walls like Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Iron Hands. In return, Walking Wake threatens Pokemon like Archaludon, Great Tusk, and Zapdos and forms a pivoting core via Flip Turn. Toxapex is heavily valued for its Fairy-type resistance, switching into threats such as Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant, and Enamorus, as well as adds on to Walking Wake's offensive pressure via Toxic Spikes. Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-W break special walls like Empoleon, Gastrodon, and Clodsire. In return, Walking Wake threatens Poison-type walls such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Galarian Weezing. Pelipper provides rain support to enhance Walking Wake's wallbreaking capabilities, notably allowing Walking Wake to 2HKO Assault Vest Iron Hands with Hydro Pump, as well as Knock Off to remove vital items like Iron Hands and Galarian Slowking's Assault Vests and U-turn to form a pivoting core and bring in Walking Wake safely. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott removes faster Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Dragapult, Greninja, and Flutter Mane using its Fighting- and Dark-type coverage while providing Spikes support with Ceaseless Edge. Additionally, Hisuian Samurott offers vital pivoting with Flip Turn, preserving momentum and wearing down switch-ins while also luring in entry hazard removers like Corviknight and Great Tusk for Walking Wake. Quaquaval offers entry hazard removal via Rapid Spin to allow Walking Wake to pivot more freely, as well as Knock Off support and pivoting using U-turn and Flip Turn. Choice Scarf Greninja is a great speed control option and a great check to enemies like Iron Valiant and Dragapult. Gastrodon can wall Choice Specs Dragapult and Flutter Mane lacking Energy Ball and provides entry hazards to aid in Walking Wake's wallbreaking. Manaphy can heavily wear down Steel and Poison teams and wears down shared checks like Alolan Muk and Water Absorb Clodsire. In return, Manaphy appreciates Walking Wake taking care of Electric-types such as Zapdos, Thundurus-T, and Rotom-W and Dragon-types like Hydreigon.</p>"

It also outspeeds common Choice Scarf users such as Great Tusk, Flamigo, and Iron Treads, which lets it clean Ground, Flying, and Fire teams late-game. With strong STAB moves in Draco Meteor and Hydro Pump, Walking Wake blows past Baxcalibur and Great Tusk. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types like Scizor and Gholdengo, though it lacks the firepower to 2HKO specially defensive Corviknight. Hydro Steam, emboldened by sun, lets Walking Wake demolish Fire teams. Alternatively, Dragon Pulse provides a weaker but more consistent STAB attack, which is great against opposing Dragon teams. The given EV spread and Timid nature cause Protosynthesis to boost Speed, allowing Walking Wake to outspeed Chlorophyll Scovillain and Choice Scarf Cinderace.</p> <p>Choice Specs Dragapult is an excellent teammate, as it can wear down or eliminate bulky threats such as Corviknight and Hatterene and is also fast enough to deal with Choice Specs Flutter Mane for Walking Wake. Baxcalibur, Hydreigon, and Haxorus appreciate Walking Wake providing speed control, allowing them to wallbreak more effectively. These teammates also batter down defensive walls such as Clodsire, Gholdengo, and Toxapex, making cleaning up with Walking Wake much easier. Dragalge can pivot into Fairy-type moves from Choice Scarf Meowscarada and Choice Scarf Iron Valiant as well as set Toxic Spikes to further wear down the opposing team. This also synergizes well with Garchomp, which sets entry hazards in Spikes and Stealth Rock, phazes the opposition with Dragon Tail or Roar, and pressures Poison- and Steel-types like Clodsire and Klefki. Cyclizar gets rid of entry hazards for Walking Wake, allowing it to come onto the field more.</p> <h5>Other Options</h5> <h6>Water</h6> <p>Dragon Pulse is a nice option to consistently wear down Regenerator cores when combating Poison teams, not leaving Special Attack drops like Draco Meteor.</p>"

However, this makes Sinistcha susceptible to status and easier to force out. Iron Defense is situationally useful, as it ensures that Shadow Ball Sinistcha can handle Gouging Fire while still dealing with physical attackers, though it is inferior to Strength Sap due to the lack of recovery. Opting for Leftovers over Heavy-Duty Boots enables Sinistcha to set up more Substitutes, but Ghost teams with Sinistcha are unlikely to have entry hazard removal support, which makes Sinistcha easier to wear down. Similarly, an itemless Sinistcha is plausible, as it effectively walls Ceruledge and prevents Knock Off users like Gliscor from breaking its Substitute. However, this is discouraged due to how circumstantial this is.</p> <h4>Grass</h4> <p>Stun Spore can also be used so that Sinistcha weakens faster threats such as Zamazenta and potential setup sweepers such as Dragonite.

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Sinistcha serves as an effective wincon against types like Ground and Water, as it readily handles walls like Clodsire and Toxapex, which pose problems for Ghost teams. Matcha Gotcha threatens Ursaluna-B and puts physical attackers, such as Choice Band Excadrill, Assault Vest Iron Hands, and Mamoswine, in a situation where they risk getting burned to break Sinistcha's Substitute. The chance to burn also affects the ability of Articuno, Empoleon, and Alolan Muk to wall out Ghost teams in the long run, making it advantageous even if the damage dealt to these walls is negligible. Matcha Gotcha also is Sinistcha's only form of recovery, allowing it to set up and threaten opposing teams longer. Shadow Ball provides more upfront damage and allows Sinistcha to OHKO Flutter Mane and Ceruledge at +1, while Hex synergizes with Matcha Gotcha's ability to spread burns and threatens Gliscor better. Substitute keeps Sinistcha away from status, especially Toxic, from the aforementioned walls and also provides a better matchup against Ursaluna-B, as it prevents Sinistcha from taking damage from Blood Moon. Substitute also takes advantage of forced switches, allowing Sinistcha to fish for burns as often as possible and letting it set up on physical attackers after they have been inflicted with a burn. With 96 Speed EVs, Sinistcha outspeeds and removes Adamant Belly Drum Azumarill, while the remaining EVs are invested in Defense and HP to maximize its bulk, enabling it to sponge hits from Excadrill and Barraskewda. Heatproof is effective against Hisuian Goodra, Cinderace, and Volcanion in a pinch.</p> <p>Sinistcha annoys almost every special wall in the metagame with its ability to inflict burns, making it a valuable teammate for every special attacker Ghost teams have. For instance, Hex Spectrier can clean up after Sinistcha has burned the opposition. Flutter Mane appreciates the removal of Clodsire, Empoleon, and Zamazenta, while Gholdengo benefits from special walls like Alolan Muk being burned, making it easier for Gholdengo to set up. In return, these teammates dispatch of faster threats like Latios, Ogerpon-H, and Baxcalibur. Dragapult pivots Sinistcha in against walls like Clodsire, deals with Gouging Fire and Roaring Moon, and spreads status to give Sinistcha more setup opportunities. Ceruledge appreciates Sinistcha dealing with bulky Ground- and Water-types, which wall it after a Swords Dance. In return, Ceruledge makes quick work of Flutter Mane, Gholdengo, and Heatran. Furthermore, Ceruledge can also handle threats like Kingambit and Chien-Pao if its Focus Sash remains intact. Mimikyu takes advantage of Sinistcha removing Quagsire and Toxapex, and in return, it provides Ghost teams with a failsafe against threats like Hisuian Samurott, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao. Froslass and Golurk provide entry hazards in Spikes or Stealth Rock to soften up opposing teams. Froslass also provides Thunder Wave to capitalize on Hex and allows Sinistcha to outpace threats like Spectrier, while Golurk can use a Kasib or Colbur Berry to lure and remove threeats like Flutter Mane or Kingambit for it. Skeledirge checks Fire-types that overwhelm Sinistcha like Gouging Fire, Volcarona, and Heatran, and is able to burn foes like Kingambit.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind (Grass)": {
        "description": "<p>Sinistcha makes for a great addition for Grass teams by virtue of its great physical bulk and great ability in Heatproof, both of which give it a better matchup against Gouging Fire, and a Ghost typing that allows it to threaten Fighting teams and spinblock. Matcha Gotcha not only is a form of recovery but also allows Sinistcha to potentially burn switch-ins like Dragonite and Iron Hands. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB option that targets Ghost- and Psychic-types like Pecharunt, Hatterene, and Slowbro. After one Calm Mind boost, Sinistcha survives a Shadow Ball from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane and OHKOes back with Shadow Ball after entry hazard damage. Alternatively, Hex can be used to take advantage of potential burn from Matcha Gotcha to deal higher damage, and it synergizes well with its status-spreading teammates. Strength Sap allows Sinistcha to take advantage of strong physical attackers it takes hits from with ease like Breloom, Sneasler, and Gouging Fire, the latter of which is a crucial target due to potentially sweeping Grass teams, to recover large amounts of its HP. Alternatively, Iron Defense allows Sinistcha to further boost its great Defense to better take hits from Choice Band users such as Hisuian Arcanine and Zamazenta as well as counter setup attempts from sweepers like Hisuian Lilligant. A combination of Strength Sap and Iron Defense ensures Sinistcha easily takes hits from Gouging Fire, but it comes at the cost of foregoing Matcha Gotcha and its potential status spreading. Substitute can also be used to take advantage of passive walls such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Amoonguss to set up a Calm Mind. However, Strength Sap is preferred, since it is Sinistcha's main form of recovery apart from Matcha Gotcha. 96 Speed EVs allow Sinistcha to outspeed and threaten Azumarill.</p> <p>Toedscruel makes for a great teammate, as Sinistcha appreciates the hazards Brambleghast places that aid it. Physically defensive Amoonguss is a great defensive partner, as with its great physical bulk, it handles threats to Sinistcha like Meowscarada and Roaring Moon and immobilizes either with Spore. In return, Sinistcha handles the Psychic-types that threaten it. Ogerpon-C and Abomasnow handle Flying-types that Sinistcha dislikes, with Ogerpon-C handling Articuno, Moltres, and Gyarados, while Abomasnow targets Gliscor, Dragon Dance Dragonite, and the Landorus formes. Additionally, Abomasnow further boosts Sinistcha's bulk on top of Calm Mind with Aurora Veil. The two of them appreciate Sinistcha handling Fighting-types like Iron Hands and Okidogi and weakening them with burn as well as providing a Fire neutrality. By removing bulky Ghost- and Fighting-types, Sinistcha enables setup sweepers like Ogerpon-H and Hisuian Lilligant to sweep late-game. Choice Scarf Meowscarada is Grass's best form of speed control, outspeeding and threatening a multitude of threats like Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Choice Scarf Hoopa-U while also providing momentum for its teammates with U-turn. Breloom and Rillaboom act as revenge killers with Mach Punch and Grassy Glide, respectively. Additionally, Breloom is also able to immobilize a threat to Sinistcha with Spore, while Rillaboom provides Grassy Terrain to both boost Sinistcha's Matcha Gotcha and give it an additional form of recovery. Substitute + Nasty Plot Hydrapple makes for another great teammate, as it can take advantage of passive walls such as Empoleon and Amoonguss to set up and threaten the likes of Hisuian Goodra, bulky Dragon Dance Gouging Fire, and Archaludon.</p>"

An ultra bulky set with 248 HP / 244 SpD / 16 Spe can be used to maximize Okidogi's bulk, allowing it to survive threatening attacks like Gholdengo's Psychic, +2 Hydreigon's Earth Power, Choice Specs Walking Wake's Draco Meteor, and Tornadus-T's Hurricane while still getting the jump on threats like Adamant Azumarill, Adamant Kingambit, and Mandibuzz.</p> <h4>Fighting</h4> <p>Ice Punch gives Okidogi a solid tool for hitting Flying- and Dragon-types like Gliscor, Dragonite, and Garchomp for immense damage, along with an option that hits harder than Knock Off.

Finally, Psychic Fangs allows for Okidogi to hit Poison-type threats like opposing Okidogi and Clodsire for incredible damage. However, all of these options come with a similar downside of making Okidogi completely walled by Gholdengo, which can turn Okidogi into setup fodder should one choose to drop Knock Off for these options.</p>",

Toxic Chain and Guard Dog are both helpful in allowing Okidogi to break through teams. Toxic Chain puts more pressure on bulky walls like Sableye, Avalugg, Quagsire, and Skeledirge, which forces them to either switch out or repeatedly use recovery moves. Guard Dog, on the other hand, punishes Intimidate from the likes of Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Paldean Tauros-F and stops phazing from threats such as Ting-Lu and Empoleon. Drain Punch is a useful STAB move that keeps Okidogi healthy and deals solid damage against threats like Kingambit, Garganacl, and Heatran. Knock Off is used to punish Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Ceruledge, and Dragapult that effortlessly wall Okidogi otherwise. It also annoys switch-ins like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Quagsire by removing their Black Sludge. For the final moveslot there are three main options. Taunt prevents Haze from Toxapex and Articuno, Substitute is useful to set up in the face of Pokemon like Amoonguss and Galarian Weezing, and Ice Punch blows through Flying- and Ground-types like Dragonite, Clodsire, and Gliscor. 96 Speed EVs allow Okidogi to outspeed threats like Adamant Torterra, Jolly Kingambit, and Jolly Azumarill, with the rest of the EVs maximizing Okidogi's specially defensive bulk, allowing it to comfortably survive offensive Heatran or Glimmora's Earth Power.</p> <p>Okidogi's crippling weakness to any Psychic-type attack makes Alolan Muk an essential teammate, being able to handle threats like Espathra, Iron Valiant, Hisuian Zoroark, and Hatterene with its STAB moves. Overqwil, while not as specially bulky, still provides a Psychic immunity while providing support in stacking entry hazards to ease Okidogi's sweep. Galarian Weezing similarly fills an important role with its immunity to Ground-type attacks from threats like Great Tusk, Mamoswine, and Clodsire. Once switched in, it can burn physical threats along with removing hazards, allowing Okidogi to have a much easier time switching in and setting up late-game. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can soak up special attacks from foes such as Greninja and Walking Wake, remove Landorus with Ice beam, and provides a Psychic neutrality and the ability to create Future Sight traps for Okidogi to exploit. Amoonguss provides assistance in scaring off Ground- and Water-types like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R with its Grass-type STAB attacks and provides Spore support to give Okidogi a safe opportunity to switch in and begin setting up. Toxapex's solid physical bulk in conjunction with Haze and a Rocky Helmet provides utility in wearing threats down like Zamazenta, Mimikyu, and Ceruledge. Salazzle, thank to its high Speed and ability to wear down physical walls like Toxapex, Galarian Weezing, and Corviknight with Corrosion-enabled Toxic and ability to impede setup sweepers, such as Baxcalibur, Manaphy, and Ogerpon formes, with Encore excels at removing threats Okidogi doesn't like. Glimmora provides similar Corrosion utility, along with the ability to set up hazards and threaten dangerous Flying-types like Dragonite, Moltres, and Zapdos with STAB Power Gem. It can also remove hazards with Mortal Spin to give Okidogi safe entry. Choice Specs Iron Moth's Overheat is great at removing dangerous threats such as Gliscor and Landorus instantly, along with using Discharge to remove Flying- and Water-types like Moltres, Enamorus, and Toxapex. Gengar has valuable utility in its ability to remove pesky Ghost-types like Skeledirge, Gholdengo, and Brambleghast along with being able to Trick its Choice Specs onto walls like Clodsire, making them far easier to break through.

Knock Off threatens Ghost- and Psychic-type threats like Dragapult, Spectrier, and Latios that would switch into Close Combat along with providing item removal. Ice Punch OHKOes Landorus, an immense issue for Poison, along with other Flying-type foes such as Dragonite and Gliscor.

Glimmora continues to support Okidogi by threatening problematic Flying-types like Moltres and Zapdos along with spreading Corrosion Toxic to chip down physical walls like Galarian Weezing and Pecharunt. Overqwil deals with physical Psychic- and Ghost-types like Iron Boulder, Gallade, and Ceruledge. Clodsire deals with Fire-type threats like Volcarona and Iron Moth.

Toxapex provides a solid way to deal with threats like Scizor that can threaten Okidogi with priority along with handling targets such as Zamazenta and Araquanid.

Drain Punch is Okidogi's Fighting-type STAB move of choice, providing a solid recovery and wallbreaking tool in one slot. Poison Jab is vital in allowing Okidogi to check key Fairy-type Pokemon such as Azumarill, Clefable, and Enamorus, while Gunk Shot provides a strong-but-risky power boost over Poison Jab, OHKOing threats like Primarina and Clefable while 2HKOing Amoonguss after a Bulk Up along with avoiding Rocky Helmet chip damage. Knock Off provides key utility, allowing Okidogi to hit Ghost-types like Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Dragapult that would otherwise wall it, along with removing items such as Heavy-Duty Boots, making switch-ins such as Pecharunt less reliable. Both Toxic Chain and Guard Dog provide immense utility, with Toxic Chain being able to put walls such as Quagsire and Skeledirge on a timer, which may come in to stop Okidogi, while Guard Dog prevents Intimidate from the likes of Gyarados from stopping it.

In return, Hisuian Samurott appreciates Ogerpon-W breaking through Corviknight, while Empoleon benefits from the removal of Great Tusk. Pelipper makes for another great teammate for Ogerpon-W, setting up rain to strengthen Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel. Aside from rain, Pelipper can pivot into Ogerpon-W via U-turn and threaten Hisuian Lilligant and Amoonguss with Hurricane. Entry hazards from the likes of Gastrodon, Toxapex, and Quagsire can wear down incoming foes for Ogerpon-W to take advantage of. Quagsire can also remove setup sweepers that can outspeed and threaten Ogerpon-W out like Dragonite and Baxcalibur thanks to a combination of Unaware and Toxic, while Toxapex is able to serve as a wall against the likes of Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. As Ogerpon-W struggles with certain bulky Pokemon, such as Galarian Weezing and Zamazenta, it appreciates teammates that can either remove them or wear them down for Ogerpon-W to finish off, such as boosted Manaphy for the former and Basculegion-F under rain for the latter. Urshifu-R pairs well with Ogerpon-W, as it can break bulky Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon. Lastly, Toxapex and Amoonguss can stop any Ogerpon-W wallbreaking attempts; hence, Choice Specs users such as Walking Wake and Greninja make for great partners.</p>"

Apart from this, its part Grass typing allows Ogerpon-H to match up well against various Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types such as Dondozo, Garganacl, and Great Tusk. With Hearthflame Mask, Ogerpon-H's Ivy Cudgel becomes a Fire-type move capable of 2HKOing Baxcalibur and Clodsire without a Swords Dance boost while also breaking through sturdy walls such as Hisuian Goodra, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Weezing after a Swords Dance boost. With Horn Leech, Ogerpon-H has access to some form of recovery especially against the Ground-types that most Fire-types tend to struggle against such as Ursaluna-B and Gastrodon. Play Rough allows Ogerpon-H to threaten the Dragon-types that take little from its STAB moves, OHKOing Kommo-o without a Swords Dance boost and OHKOing tanky Garchomp after a Swords Dance boost. On the other hand, Trailblaze allows Ogerpon-H to outspeed Iron Valiant and Flutter Mane after it is used once.</p> <p>Ninetales and Torkoal are key teammates for Ogerpon-H, as they set up sun to boost Ogerpon-H's damage from Ivy Cudgel to devastating levels. Notably, it is able to 2HKO Gliscor under sun without a Swords Dance boost. Torkoal is also able to set up Stealth Rock to weaken foes, putting them in OHKO range from Ogerpon-H's attacks. Ogerpon-H appreciates forms of entry hazard removal such as Cinderace's Court Change, Torkoal's Rapid Spin, and Talonflame's Defog. Court Change is notable, since it can possibly gain dual screens placed by foes such as Klefki and Alolan Ninetales, although it is best used when any hazards are not on the opponent's side of the field. Ogerpon-H struggles with certain walls such as Toxapex, so it appreciates Heatran being able to trap and eliminate it with Earth Power. In return, Ogerpon-H is able to threaten Ground-types Heatran struggles with such as Ting-Lu. Volcanion and Hisuian Arcanine make for great partners, as they are able to check various offensive Pokemon Ogerpon-H struggles with. Volcanion, with its immunity Water and its great bulk, checks the likes of Azumarill and Greninja, while Hisuian Arcanine is able to revenge kill sweepers like Dragonite and Baxcalibur. Lastly, Ogerpon-H's wallbreaking allows it to enable sweeps from Ceruledge and Volcarona, with the former appreciating Great Tusk's removal, while the latter appreciates Dondozo's removal.</p>"

Aside from this, its access to Mold Breaker allows it to bypass abilities such as Heatran's Flash Fire, Dondozo's Unaware, and Dragonite's Multiscale. With Hearthflame Mask, Ivy Cudgel turns into a powerful Fire-type move, and combined with its Speed, Ogerpon-H is able to beat the likes of Alolan Ninetales and Corviknight before a Swords Dance boost, as well as Hisuian Goodra after. Horn Leech grants Ogerpon-H some form of longevity. Play Rough allows Ogerpon-H to threaten the likes of Kommo-o, and after a Swords Dance Boost, it can 2HKO Dragonite. Alternatively, Trailblaze gives Ogerpon-H potential as a sweeper. After one Trailblaze, Ogerpon-H outspeeds the likes of Chien-Pao and Choice Specs Greninja. Lastly, with Zen Headbutt, Ogerpon-H can surprise would-be switch-ins such as Toxapex, Clodsire, and Iron Moth.</p> <p>Entry hazard support from the likes of Brambleghast and Toedscruel is appreciated to wear down foes into OHKO range from Ogerpon-H. Notably, Ogerpon-H has a chance to OHKO Kingambit with one layer of Spikes. The two of them also have access to Rapid Spin, allowing them to remove hazards so that Ogerpon-H has more opportunities to switch in without getting worn down. Toedscruel can also take Fire-type attacks from Iron Moth and KO it back, while Brambleghast can switch into a predicted Flying-type move as well as revenge kill Flutter Mane with Shadow Sneak. Amoonguss is another great teammate, as its bulk and access to Spore allow it to either incapacitate or force out foes such as Dragonite. Choice Scarf Meowscarada outspeeds and removes potential threats to Ogerpon-H like Spectrier and faster Dragon-types, and it can bring Ogerpon-H in safely. Ogerpon-H's wallbreaking enables sweepers such as Hisuian Liligant and Torterra. In return, the two of them can handle foes Ogerpon-H struggles with, such as Landorus for the former and Toxapex for the latter. Rillaboom is a great revenge killer and wallbreaker to pair with Ogerpon-H, as with Grassy Glide, it can remove faster threats such as Flutter Mane and Hoopa-U. Aside from this, Rillaboom also provides Grassy Terrain to boost the power of Ogerpon-H's Grass-type moves. In return, Rillaboom appreciates Ogerpon-H removing foes Rillaboom struggles with such as Corviknight and Articuno. Breloom is another great teammate, as due to its Fighting typing and access to Mach Punch, it can easily deal with Kingambit. Lastly, Abomasnow has some niche as a teammate, as it can set up Aurora Veil to make Ogerpon-H and its teammates harder to KO.</p>"

Sturdy allows Ogerpon-C to take a hit from and remove faster threats like Barraskewda, as well as Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos after a Swords Dance. Ivy Cudgel deals with threats like Ogerpon-H and Enamorus while also OHKOing Dragonite and Heatran after a Swords Dance. Horn Leech is a good Grass STAB move, being able to hurt Ground- and Water-types like Quagsire and Ting-Lu and OHKO Walking Wake after a boost. Horn Leech's recovery is useful for extending Ogerpon-C's longevity and can let Sturdy be used again if it brings Ogerpon-C back to full HP. Superpower is a strong coverage move as it is able to deal with Steel- and Dark-types like Iron Treads, Hisuian Goodra, Urshifu-S, and Kingambit while being able to OHKO Snorlax at +2.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Glimmora, with its colorful moveset, deals with faster threats that outspeed Ogerpon-C like non-Choice-Scarf Greninja, Kommo-o, and Iron Valiant. In return, Ogerpon-C deals with Azumarill and Ursaluna-B for Glimmora. Air Balloon Glimmora can switch into threatening Ground-type moves while taking on foes like Great Tusk, clear entry hazards with Mortal Spin to make sure Ogerpon-C's Sturdy isn't broken, and sets its own hazards to enable Ogerpon-C's sweep. Tyranitar sets up sand to allow Ogerpon-C to set up easier due to the Special Defense boost, allowing Ogerpon-C to survive a Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Walking Wake. Tyranitar also acts as a specially defensive tank for Ogerpon-C and deals with Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Spectrier. Ogerpon-C aids Tyranitar by dealing with Landorus-T and non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott. Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine is a strong wallbreaker, using Head Smash and Flare Blitz to break through walls like Gholdengo and Corviknight. Hisuian Arcanine appreciates Ogerpon-C being able to deal with pesky Water- and Ground-types like Belly Drum Azumarill, Landorus, and Sandy Shocks. Coalossal is a decent physical wall that can remove hazards, which prevents Ogerpon-C's Sturdy from breaking, and deals with Chien-Pao, Kingambit, Scizor, and Corviknight. Coalossal also sets up Spikes to enhance Ogerpon-C's wallbreaking. Ogerpon-C takes care of Ursaluna-B and Manaphy for Coalossal. Iron Defense + Body Press Garganacl can act as a defensive stallbreaker, using Salt Cure to weaken impediments to Ogerpon-C sweeping, like Skeledirge, Dondozo, and Hisuian Goodra. Ogerpon-C shuts down Choice Band Mamoswine, which would otherwise destroy Garganacl. Lead Kleavor is another option that can set Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, potentially breaking a Focus Sash on Ceruledge, Breloom, and Ribombee that can hinder Ogerpon-C's sweeps otherwise. Assault Vest Diancie eases the Fighting and Dragon matchups by being able to take on non-Choice Band Urshifu-S, Iron Valiant, and Dragapult. Alolan Golem can trap and eliminate Steel-types such as Corviknight and Scizor for Ogerpon-C. In return Ogerpon-C destroys Ground-types like Quagsire and Ursaluna-B.</p>"

Its Rock typing, coupled with its amazing Speed and offenses, makes it a formidable force, allowing it to nail any Flying- and Fire-type threats to Grass teams such as Galarian Moltres, Gouging Fire, and Volcarona with the powerful and accurate Ivy Cudgel. Swords Dance can boost Ogerpon-C's Attack further, allowing it to beat Dragonite through Multiscale at +2 as well as brute force through Heatran if Ogerpon-C lacks Fighting-type coverage. Horn Leech is a great STAB move that allows Ogerpon-C to retain Sturdy by virtue of healing; however, Power Whip is another option if Ogerpon-C wants more power, such as to OHKO Iron Treads after a Swords Dance. Sturdy also allows Ogerpon-C to survive the likes of Swords Dance-boosted Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and Dragon Dance-boosted Gouging Fire's Flare Blitz and retaliate with Ivy Cudgel. Trailblaze lets Ogerpon-C boost its Speed and outspeed the likes of Choice Scarf Enamorus as well as Speed tie Choice Scarf Iron Moth. Low Kick is an alternative choice to take care of pesky heavy Steel-types that Ogerpon-C is otherwise useless against, such as Heatran and Kingambit, but Superpower is an alternative choice that is more reliable against targets that are not heavy, specifically Archaludon.</p> <p>Ogerpon-C appreciates help from its teammates to help beat down its checks and counters. Choice Scarf Meowscarada can take care of any Dragon-types in sight, such as Latios, Dragapult, and Roaring Moon, with its Protean-boosted Play Rough and Triple Axel, as well as remove Leftovers from Corviknight with Knock Off. In return, Ogerpon-C takes out Moltres for Meowscarada. Amoonguss and Hydrapple are great defensive partners, withstanding strong attacks from the likes of Sneasler, Zamazenta, and Iron Valiant for the former and Heatran, Cinderace, and Gouging Fire without a Dragon-type move for the latter; they can also retaliate with a variety of options and heal the damage off with Regenerator. Amoonguss is able to put Ogerpon-C's checks to sleep, as well as outright beat Iron Valiant with Sludge Bomb; it also comes with the added benefit of being able to remove Toxic Spikes, which allows Ogerpon-C to preserve its Sturdy. In exchange, Ogerpon-C beats Dragonite and Articuno, which trouble Amoonguss and Hydrapple. Hisuian Lilligant and Breloom are more great partners, both being able to boost and beat down Steel-types with powerful STAB Fighting-type moves, alongside having access to sleep and Upper Hand to catch Chien-Pao off guard when it uses Ice Shard. Sinistcha is a great teammate that can be a wincon with Calm Mind after Ogerpon-C has weakened the opposition enough, and it is also able to beat down Fighting-types that trouble Ogerpon-C such as Zamazenta and Iron Hands. Serperior is another choice that can paralyze faster threats such as Flutter Mane, Iron Valiant and Zamazenta with Glare, alongside providing passive healing to Ogerpon-C to maintain Sturdy via Leech Seed and being a threat with Contrary Leaf Storm if it gets going. Abomasnow is another partner that can set up Aurora Veil for Ogerpon-C, which provides it with ease of setup, as well as beat Dragon-types like Latias and non-Choice Specs Dragapult with Ice Shard. Lastly, Brambleghast is a great partner to remove entry hazards and retain Ogerpon-C's Sturdy, as it is unable to hold Heavy-Duty Boots, while blanking Tornadus-T and Zapdos's Hurricanes by virtue of Wind Rider. Brambleghast also has the added benefit of being able to set Spikes, which punishes the switch-ins forced by Ogerpon-C and helps it in knocking foes out.</p>"

Archaludon has a variety of options for its fourth move, namely Thunder Wave to punish switch-ins like Primarina and Volcarona, Dragon Pulse to consistently damage opposing Dragon-types, and Metal Burst to get a surprise OHKO on threats like Flutter Mane, Ceruledge, and Hoopa-U.

Draco Meteor not only OHKOes these Dragon-types but is also powerful enough to OHKO Urshifu-R and Darkrai after minimal chip damage. Thunder Wave lets Archaludon limit threats such as Ogerpon-H, Keldeo, and Spectrier, preventing them from sweeping Steel teams. Flash Cannon OHKOes Iron Valiant and allows Archaludon to pick off Flutter Mane after some damage. Thunderbolt prevents Skarmory and Moltres from gaining free entry into Archaludon. Alternatively, Foul Play OHKOes Ceruledge and Ogerpon-H at +2 after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Since Choice Scarf Archaludon relies on surprise to bait the opponent, entry hazards need to be off the field to avoid revealing that it is not carrying Leftovers. Iron Treads can handle this with Rapid Spin and also serves as a fast teammate that deals with Landorus and Hisuian Goodra for Archaludon. Alternatively, a Choice Band Iron Treads set can be used to remove Iron Hands, Okidogi, and opposing Archaludon while also weakening defensive cores of Ground, Dark, and Poison teams for Archaludon to exploit. Gholdengo benefits from Archaludon providing speed control, allowing it to use more a powerful set like Choice Specs or Nasty Plot to punch holes in opposing teams, overwhelming Gliscor and Hisuian Goodra. In return, Gholdengo provides a Fighting-immune teammate and deals with Iron Hands and Galarian Slowking. Air Balloon Heatran can check most Gouging Fire variants and sets Stealth Rock, which this Archaludon cannot. Heatran also deals with Ceruledge once its Air Balloon is popped, covering for Archaludon's inability to check it without defensive investment. Skarmory provides a Ground-immune, sets entry hazards, and serves as a wincon once special attackers like Dragapult and Hydreigon are baited and removed by Archaludon. Scizor and Bisharp appreciate Archaludon's ability to keep their checks, such as Skarmory, Moltres, Gouging Fire, and Hydreigon, at low HP or eliminated, and in return, they can clean through opposing teams and remove Flutter Mane and Gholdengo with their priority moves, respectively. Corviknight is an alternative Ground-immune teammate that provides Defog and pivoting in U-turn, which facilitates Archaludon's ability to tear through Dragon teams.</p>"

Draco Meteor lets Archaludon pressure Gouging Fire and gain the upper hand against Dragon teams. Body Press complements Draco Meteor well by heavily damaging Hisuian Goodra, the main check to Draco Meteor for Dragon teams. Aside from this, Body Press also weakens Steel- and Normal-types such as Heatran and Blissey, which can comfortably take Draco Meteor. The synergy between Body Press and Stamina allows Archaludon to handle bulky threats like Ting-Lu and Gliscor effectively. Thunder Wave slows down threats like the Ogerpon formes, Keldeo, and Iron Valiant, which Archaludon can survive a hit from but cannot OHKO back, and also lets Archaludon take further advantage of the switches it forces. Stealth Rock lets Archaludon capitalize on forcing out physical attackers like Dragonite and Iron Boulder further. Alternatively, one can forgo Stealth Rock to broaden the number of targets Archaludon checks. Foul Play enables Archaludon to OHKO Ceruledge and dissuade Dragon Dance Dragonite from boosting further. It can also use Thunderbolt to revenge kill Azumarill and dissuade Skarmory from setting entry hazards against it. 52 Speed EVs let Archaludon outspeed Jolly Azumarill while using the remaining EVs to maximize Archaludon‘s bulk.</p> <p>Archaludon's lackluster Special Defense is its glaring weakness, so specially defensive teammates like Hisuian Goodra, Heatran, and Empoleon are appreciated. Hisuian Goodra can trade blows with Raging Bolt and Primarina; Heatran provides an immunity to Fire moves that lets it check Volcarona and deal with Gholdengo, Spectrier, and Flutter Mane; and Empoleon provides Stealth Rock, checks Walking Wake and Heatran, and is able to Knock Off Choice Specs from Hydreigon. Gholdengo provides a Fighting immunity, prevents opposing teams from removing Stealth Rock that Archaludon sets, and can choose to utilize a specially defensive spread to improve the matchup against Dragapult and Keldeo. Gholdengo and Heatran can also choose to run more offensive sets, with Air Balloon Heatran helping Archaludon check Gouging Fire and Nasty Plot Gholdengo dealing with Ursaluna-B and Iron Valiant. Skarmory is a physical wall that complements Archaludon, as it swaps into predicted Ground-type moves from Excadrill and Great Tusk, sets Spikes to pair with Archaludon's Stealth Rock, and has Whirlwind to further chip down opposing teams and to phaze IronPress users like Zamazenta and opposing Skarmory. Bisharp appreciates Archaludon's ability to check Gouging Fire and Encore Ogerpon-W, as well as the entry hazards Archaludon sets to set up and attempt to sweep Dragon, Water, and Dark teams late-game. Iron Treads can soft check Raging Bolt, remove entry hazards, pivot, and outspeed and remove Landorus and Garchomp with Ice Spinner in a pinch. Corviknight is an alternative Ground-immune teammate that loves Archaludon's ability to put a stop to Gouging Fire and Ogerpon-W, potentially overpowering Dragon and Water teams afterward when using a Bulk Up set.</p>"

Body Press pairs well with Stamina and lets Archaludon check Bisharp and Weavile. Flash Cannon pelts Fairy- and Ice-types like Hatterene and Froslass coming in on it, and it also deals enough damage to knock out Iron Valiant in a worst-case scenario. Stealth Rock chips down opposing teams and provides Dragon teams with more breathing room against threats like Choice Band Chien-Pao and Swords Dance Ceruledge. The final moveslot is highly flexible and is mainly dependent on Archaludon's teammates. Protect is the most consistent choice, letting Archaludon rack up more Leftovers recovery and scout opposing Choice item users like Excadrill and Enamorus, while Draco Meteor lets Archaludon excel in the Dragon matchup, punishing physical attackers like Gouging Fire and physically inclined Dragapult that cannot deal with Archaludon. On the other hand, Roar takes advantage of Archaludon's ability to force out most physical attackers and defensive Pokemon and lets Archaludon further wear down opposing teams. Thunderbolt hits Skarmory and Toxapex, which would otherwise take advantage of Archaludon by setting up entry hazards, and chunks Azumarill enough to deter it from using Belly Drum. Stamina punishes weak attacks such as pivoting moves from Corviknight, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. The Defense boost also lets Archaludon overpower Ground-type attackers such as Gliscor lacking Swords Dance and Ting-Lu that cannot break through it after a few boosts. 56 Speed EVs let Archaludon outspeed Jolly Azumarill, allowing Archaludon to check these threats readily. The remaining EVs are used to make Archaludon as physically bulky as possible, notably allowing it to survive an OHKO from Choice Band Excadrill's Earthquake.</p> <p>Although Archaludon can take physical hits with ease, it has trouble taking neutral special attacks, as it is 2HKOed by Choice Scarf Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Dragapult's Draco Meteor and outright OHKOed by Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Hydreigon. Because of this, Hisuian Goodra is a great teammate, as it sponges these attacks reasonably well, forming a great defensive core with Archaludon. Alternatively, Gouging Fire can be used as a specially defensive pivot to absorb various Fairy- and Ice-type special attacks from Enamorus and Greninja, and it also deals with Gholdengo for Archaludon. Dragapult is immune to Fighting and can reasonably deal with Iron Defense Zamazenta if using a Hex set, OHKO Flutter Mane and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant if using Choice Specs, and pivot in Archaludon against walls it can take advantage of like Ting-Lu and Blissey. Baxcalibur deals with Landorus and Enamorus with Ice Shard, and it can utilize a Dragon Dance or Swords Dance set to break down types such as Poison and Ground that Archaludon struggles with. Latias is immune to Ground thanks to Levitate, deals with Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Okidogi, and provides Healing Wish, which gives Archaludon a second chance at walling Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. Dragonite is immune to Ground by typing instead of ability, which helps against Excadrill. It can also make use of Multiscale to let it take on and revenge kill Enamorus and Ceruledge in a pinch, and it can utilize a Choice Band set to clean opposing teams with Extreme Speed after Archaludon has chipped them down. Raging Bolt deals with pesky Water- and Flying-types like Primarina and Enamorus with Thunderclap and also benefits from Archaludon's Stealth Rock.</p>"

Fickle Beam after a Nasty Plot boost threatens Dragon-types such as Gouging Fire and Garchomp, as well as having a chance to dish out double the damage to land an OHKO on Dragonite. Earth Power can be run over Fickle Beam to threaten Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types like non-Air Balloon Heatran, Iron Treads, and Sneasler. Substitute works great in tandem with Hydrapple’s decent bulk and HP, making it easy for Hydrapple to set up on Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hippowdon, and Dondozo. The given EV spread allows Hydrapple to outpace Hisuian Goodra while also maximizing its bulk.</p> <p>Gouging Fire makes for a great offensive teammate for Hydrapple, helping it get rid of Fairy-type threats like Klefki, Hatterene, and Iron Valiant while also hitting Ice-type threats in Articuno and Chien-Pao. Garchomp is another good offensive Pokemon to pair with Hydrapple, as it can give entry hazard support while also checking Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types for Hydrapple, like Alolan Muk, Hisuian Goodra, and Hisuian Arcanine. Hisuian Goodra is a great special wall to pair with Hydrapple, as it’s able to take hits from Flutter Mane and Greninja. Choice Specs Dragapult can help outspeed and defeat other threats to Hydrapple, such as Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Hatterene. With a +1 Thunderclap, Raging Bolt can take care of fast Flying-types that would threaten Hydrapple, like Enamorus. Latios is also a great teammate for Hydrapple, as it has access to Calm Mind and can help alleviate the matchup against Poison-types such as Galarian Weezing. Latias can be used as an alternative to Latios, as it can provide further utility in Healing Wish. Archaludon is a strong physical wall that can check Chien-Pao and provide entry hazard support in Stealth Rock. In return, Hydrapple can take out troublesome Ground-types for the team like Quagsire, Great Tusk, and Ursaluna-B.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Hydrapple provides a crucial neutrality to Fire-type attacks for Grass teams, making use of its amazing bulk, coverage, and ability to take on threats to its teammates like Heatran and Ogerpon-H. Draco Meteor is a far more common STAB option for Hydrapple due to its consistent BP, but Fickle Beam can tickle your gambling addiction if you're feeling lucky, with the added benefit of not reducing Special Attack. Earth Power makes for excellent coverage in the face of Fire-types like Gouging Fire and Cinderace, as well as Steel-types like Heatran and non-Air Ballon Gholdengo, while Giga Drain grants a nice secondary STAB to keep Hydrapple healthy, especially if it forgoes Recover for Substitute. Substitute takes advantage of passive foes like Toxapex and Quagsire to accrue Nasty Plot boosts. The given Speed EVs let Hydrapple outpace uninvested Tyranitar, Azumarill, and Kingambit.</p> <p>Hydrapple appreciates being paired with Meowscarada and Ogerpon-C for their coverage against Dragon- and Flying-types, and the latter of which can threaten Fire- and Ice-types as well. Ogerpon-H is a perfect answer to Steel-types like Scizor and Heatran, while also outputting a general exerting pressure that can even threaten Flying-types. Amoonguss provides a neutrality to Poison and Bug, taking on physical Bug-types like Scizor with Foul Play while dissuading other Bug-types like Volcarona and Frosmoth from switching in with the threat of Toxic. Amoonguss also has the added benefit of incapacitating shared threats between it and Hydrapple with Spore, like Mamoswine and Galarian Zapdos. Heatproof Sinistcha alleviates some pressure from Hydrapple as a sole Fire neutrality, while also being neutral to Bug like Amoonguss. Breloom is a powerful Focus Sash lead, trading with Dark-type threats like Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon, and even Flying-types with both Spore and Rock Tomb. Rotom-C is a solid teammate thanks to its Flying neutrality, threatening Flying-types with Electric STAB and offering disruption with Trick and Will-O-Wisp. Iron Leaves and Hisuian Lilligant are both potent setup sweepers, making use of their great speed and coverage if given a single setup opportunity, augmented further by Spore support. Rillaboom is a great partner for Grass teams, offering passive healing with Grassy Terrain and picking off weakened foes with priority Grassy Glide. Brambleghast offers great hazard control, setting up Spikes and using Rapid Spin to support Hydrapple should it have its Heavy-Duty Boots removed.</p>"

Flare Blitz after a Dragon Dance allows Gouging Fire to take out Kleavor and Ogerpon-W while also OHKOing Gliscor and Archaludon under sun with minimal chip. Loaded Dice + Scale Shot not only boosts Gouging Fire's Speed, but it also takes out Dragonite and Raging Bolt. Scale Shot is also a nice midground option, being able to deal with the Poison matchup effectively and notably 2HKOing Toxapex. When using Heavy-Duty Boots, Outrage or Dragon Claw can be run for consistency; Outrage provides strong damage output, being able to take out physically defensive Gouging Fire at +1, whereas Dragon Claw doesn't lock Gouging Fire into a potentially disadvantageous situation. Morning Sun can be run over Flare Blitz to increase its longevity throughout the battle. Earthquake at +1 threatens non-Air Balloon Heatran, which otherwise walls both of Gouging Fire's STAB moves. Furthermore, Earthquake allows Gouging Fire to hit Steel-types without taking the recoil it would take from using Flare Blitz.</p> <p>Ninetales and Torkoal are great teammates for Gouging Fire, providing sun support, which boosts Gouging Fire's Attack stat. Ninetales also provides Healing Wish support, while Torkoal sets entry hazards with Stealth Rock and removes them with Rapid Spin. The sun allows Gouging Fire to tank Water-type attacks from Choice Specs Keldeo while retaliating with Scale Shot. Ogerpon-H eases the Ground and Water matchups for Gouging Fire by dealing with pesky threats like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Slowbro. Ceruledge after a Swords Dance takes out Psychic- and Ghost-types that threaten Gouging Fire like Iron Boulder and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak. Choice Scarf users like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Hisuian Arcanine are all great teammates for Gouging Fire, being able to take out a plethora of threats like Ursaluna-B, Primarina, Quagsire, and Air Balloon Heatran. Heatran tanks special attacks for Gouging Fire, notably from Choice Specs Flutter Mane while OHKOing back with Heavy Slam. Volcarona after a Quiver Dance is a nice late game sweeper for Gouging Fire that takes out pesky threats like Great Tusk, Hippowdon, and Glimmora with Giga Drain and Psychic. Talonflame provides a Ground immunity while also taking out Ogerpon-W with Brave Bird. Talonflame also removes hazards with Defog and weakens physical threats like Garchomp with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Gouging Fire is a staple on Dragon teams thanks to its great mixed bulk and neutrality to Fairy and Ice, doing great in threatening matchups like Fairy, Ice, and Steel on top of being a fail-safe against dangerous threats such as Ceruledge, Volcarona, and Iron Valiant. Flare Blitz is the STAB move of choice, hitting everything that does not resist it like Flutter Mane and Volcarona hard. Heat Crash is a viable option to prevent Gouging Fire from hurting itself while keeping a 120-Base Power attack against most targets, but it's inefficient against heavy foes such as Kyurem, Mamoswine, and Zamazenta. Earthquake combines well with Fire-type moves, leaving only Moltres and Air Balloon Heatran unscathed. Morning Sun increases Gouging Fire's longevity and improves its setup ability. The EV spread makes Gouging Fire bulky enough to avoid a 2HKO from Enamorus's Earth Power while also letting it outspeed Iron Valiant after a single Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Archaludon and Hisuian Goodra form a great defensive core with Gouging Fire, as they fix most of the troubles Gouging Fire can encounter by providing a poison immunity and solid defensive capabilities. Thanks to Stamina, Archaludon can easily come in on any physical move, especially multi-hit moves, such as Dragapult's Dragon Darts or Roaring Moon's Outrage and punish them in return, while Gouging Fire will take any Fire-type move for Archaludon and can also switch into troublesome foes like Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Hisuian Goodra can tank any special move such as Draco Meteor from Choice Specs Dragapult and Latios as well as dealing with Primarina and Flutter Mane more easily. By virtue of being a setup sweeper, Gouging Fire appreciates offensive teammates that can break through its checks such as Dragapult, Latios, Roaring Moon, Kyurem, and Raging Bolt. Choice Specs Dragapult and Latios both put immense pressure on the opposing defensive cores, as they can both deal with threats such as IronPress Zamazenta, Toxapex, and Archaludon. Thanks to Infiltrator, Choice Specs Dragapult easily breaks through Fairy's defensive structure by bypassing Light Screen and 2HKOing the whole team, whereas Latios can act as a potent wincon in the Ground matchup by swiftly removing Landorus and Hippowdon with Ice Beam. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon helps to deal with opposing Dragapult, Gouging Fire, and Latios. Kyurem focuses on Flying and Water matchups, effortlessly disposing of physically defensive Gyarados, Gliscor, and Toxapex, while appreciating Gouging Fire taking Fighting-type moves in its place. Similarly, Raging Bolt is of great help against Water and Flying teams, as it easily sweeps both types once their Electric-immune Pokemon are removed.</p>"

Outrage annihilates Dragon- and Water-types like Dragonite and Swampert attempting to switch in on Raging Fury, while Dragon Claw is a weaker but safer Dragon STAB option if the Outrage lock is undesirable. Earthquake rounds off the set by decimating miscellaneous switch-ins like non-Air Balloon Heatran and Toxapex trying to scout Gouging Fire's move choice; it also cleanly OHKOs Choice Scarf Iron Boulder, a major pain for Fire teams. The given EV spread allows Gouging Fire to get a Speed boost from Protosynthesis in sun to outpace the likes of non-Choice Scarf Landorus, Garchomp, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk.</p> <p>Ninetales and Torkoal are great partners for Gouging Fire, as they set up sun to both activate Protosynthesis as well as power up Gouging Fire's Raging Fury, letting it OHKO Clodsire, the Ogerpon formes, and Iron Valiant. Choice Scarf Ninetales provides a speed control option that can deal with foes like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, which outspeeds Gouging Fire even with a Protosynthesis boost; it also provides Healing Wish support to let Gouging Fire wallbreak again or clean up weakened teams. Alternatively, Torkoal can set Stealth Rock to let Gouging Fire dispatch Gliscor after Stealth Rock chip with Raging Fury in sun and remove opposing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Cinderace and Talonflame function as effective hazard removal options for Gouging Fire to break through teams without worrying about Stealth Rock or Spikes damage. Cinderace also functions as a decent pivot as well as a fast attacker alongside Gouging Fire, while Talonflame provides a Ground immunity. Ogerpon-H deals with annoying Water-types like Primarina and Quagsire to let Gouging Fire spam its devastating Raging Fury. Heatran provides Stealth Rock support to wear down foes like Swampert while dealing with Flutter Mane, which is a major threat to Gouging Fire. Ceruledge can pick off Flutter Mane as well as switch in on IronPress Zamazenta to shut it down. Volcarona functions well alongside Gouging Fire, as the two hit very hard on their respective attacking spectrums. Volcarona also does well against IronPress Zamazenta while easing matchups versus types like Fighting, Poison, Water, and Ground thanks to its varied coverage.</p>"

An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 92 Def / 108 SpA / 56 Spe with a Modest nature lets Raging Bolt avoid a 2HKO from Gliscor or Quagsire, always 2HKO both with Dragon Pulse, and outspeed Adamant Azumarill.</p>",

Draco Meteor is a strong and reliable nuke that allows it to weaken and eventually remove bulky walls that most Electric staples struggle against Archaludon and potentially Gliscor after one Calm Mind boost and potentially Gliscor without a boost. Thunderclap is a strong priority option that allows it to OHKO faster threats such as Barraskewda and Choice Scarf Enamorus as well as pick off weakened faster threats such as Iron Valiant. Equipped with Air Balloon, Raging Bolt is able to switch into predicted Ground-type attacks and can take advantage of threats that are Choice locked into a Ground-type move to set up a Calm Mind or use an attack against a predicted switch-in. Air Balloon's consumability also lets Raging Bolt wall Ceruledge once it pops, as Ceruledge is rendered unable to use Poltergeist. Heavy-Duty Boots is another option to prevent it from getting worn down easily by entry hazards. Leftovers can also be used so that Raging Bolt gets access to a form of recovery With 124 EVs invested into HP, Raging Bolt is able to survive a Moonblast from Choice Scarf Flutter Mane. An alternate spread with full investment into Speed allows it to outspeed Torterra and some Gholdengo, Gliscor, and Great Tusk variants.</p> <p>In order to wallbreak more efficiently, Raging Bolt appreciates entry hazard support from the likes of Galvantula's Sticky Web and Sandy Shocks's Stealth Rock and Spikes. Regieleki makes for another great teammate, being able to remove hazards with Rapid Spin so that Raging Bolt is able to switch in more safely. Regieleki is also able to spread paralysis with Thunder Wave reliably with its high Speed, allowing Raging Bolt to outspeed normally faster threats such as Gouging Fire and the Ogerpon formes. Rotom-W and Zapdos make for great additions for any Electric team, providing a Ground immunity while being able to check the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Rotom-W is also able to handle Excadrill under sand, which Raging Bolt doesn't like to face. Magnezone makes for another great teammate, providing a resistance against Fairy-types that Raging Bolt dislikes such as Hatterene and Flutter Mane. In return, Raging Bolt can handle the likes of Azumarill, Gliscor, and Gastrodon. Iron Hands is a strong, bulky teammate that can somewhat help in the Ground matchup, as with a combination of Shuca Berry and Ice Punch, it can eliminate offensive Ground-types that can easily sweep through Electric teams such as Landorus and Garchomp. Additionally, its Fighting typing helps against various Dark- and Normal-types such as Meowscarada, Chien-Pao, Kingambit, and Blissey. In return, Raging Bolt is able to revenge kill boosted rain sweepers such as Kingdra and Barraskewda. Lastly, Pawmot is able to provide support with Revival Blessing, allowing Raging Bolt or any of its other teammates a second chance to punch holes in opponents' teams. Pawmot is also able to handle the likes of Hisuian Goodra, Air Balloon Heatran, and Chien-Pao with either Close Combat or Mach Punch.

Draco Meteor threatens Ground-types like Gliscor, Great Tusk, and Unaware Quagsire that come into its Electric-type moves, notably OHKOing Gliscor after Stealth Rock and defensive Great Tusk at +1. Dragon Pulse is a decent alternative, as it can still 2HKO Quagsire and the aforementioned walls, and it prevents Raging Bolt from turning into setup fodder in the Dragon matchup, but it lacks the immediate power of Draco Meteor, which can be vital to avoid heavy damage or status from the aforementioned Gliscor. Thunderbolt lets Raging Bolt strike down Calm Mind Primarina and Dondozo, and Thunderclap lets it pick off faster threats like Greninja and Enamorus. Thunderclap's strength is quite notable; It is able to OHKO neutral targets like Iron Valiant and Gengar after a Calm Mind boost and Stealth Rock damage. The given EV spread lets Raging Bolt outpace Adamant Bisharp and survive Flutter Mane's Moonblast after a Calm Mind.</p> <p>Setup sweepers like Gouging Fire form a dangerous offensive core with Raging Bolt, as they deal with dedicated walls Raging Bolt is unlikely to break through such as Galarian Slowking and Hisuian Goodra for Gouging Fire. Gouging Fire is also flexible enough to act as a check into dangerous Fairy- and Ice-types like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao. Archaludon sets up Stealth Rock, checks Kingambit with Body Press, and switches into physical threats like Meowscarada and Mimikyu. In return, Raging Bolt deals with special attacking threats like Greninja and Keldeo, which Archaludon detests. Dragapult can utilize a variety of sets to support Raging Bolt, as it can spread status with Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave to let Raging Bolt set up easier, don a Choice Scarf to revenge kill threats like Gouging Fire and Meowscarada with Draco Meteor and U-turn, or use a Choice Specs set to batter special walls like Alolan Muk alongside Raging Bolt. Garchomp provides more entry hazards with Spikes and deals with Hisuian Goodra and Clodsire with Earthquake, and it can use a Swords Dance set which thrives once Raging Bolt removes nuisances like Corviknight, Dondozo, and Gliscor. Choice Scarf Latias provides a Ground immunity, Trick to take advantage of shared checks in Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking, which creates more setup opportunities for Raging Bolt, and Healing Wish, which lets Raging Bolt be more reckless in taking heavy damage to forcibly eliminate roadblocks for its teammates. Latias also deals with fast threats like Choice Scarf Great Tusk and Garchomp for Raging Bolt. Dragonite provides a Ground-type immunity that is not vulnerable to Mold Breaker Excadrill and powerful priority in Extreme Speed, which is extremely threatening once Raging Bolt removes Skarmory and Quagsire. Hisuian Goodra swaps into opposing Draco Meteors and forces progress by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and recovery items from key walls with Knock Off.</p>"

Mighty Cleave is Iron Boulder's main STAB move, allowing it to revenge kill common threats such as Chien-Pao, Choice Specs Flutter Mane after Stealth Rock damage, and Gouging Fire. Megahorn can be run on this set over Zen Headbutt in order to hit Hoopa-U, Slowbro, and Ogerpon-W. Earthquake provides valuable coverage against Steel-types immune to Close Combat such as non-Air Balloon Gholdengo and Heatran, as well as Poison-types immune to Zen Headbutt like Alolan Muk. Finally, Close Combat allows Iron Boulder to threaten Dark-types such as Greninja and Chien-Pao as well as hit most Steel-types for good damage. It also targets major annoyances for Psychic teams such as Blissey and Hisuian Goodra.</p> <p>Latios is a great teammate for Iron Boulder, as it provides a Ground immunity with Levitate and breaks through threats such as Corviknight and Gliscor with Thunderbolt and Luster Purge. It can also pivot Iron Boulder into threats that it cannot break down on its own, such as Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Kingambit, with Flip Turn. Indeedee is another good pick alongside Iron Boulder, as it offers a Ghost immunity to take on Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball as well as Psychic Terrain support, preventing Iron Boulder from being revenge killed by priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit or Aqua Jet from Urshifu-R. Indeedee also provides Healing Wish support to let Iron Boulder clean up weakened teams late-game. Hoopa-U is a dangerous wallbreaker that appreciates Iron Boulder giving it speed control. In return, it can take on Ghost-type attacks such as Choice Scarf Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball pretty handily thanks to its decent Special Defense, while threatening those Ghost-types in return. It can also break through defensive cores Iron Boulder can struggle to beat, such as Corviknight and Landorus-T on Flying or Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight on Steel. Deoxys-S can either soften up opposing teams with its entry hazard support or become a fearsome wallbreaker with Expanding Force while in Psychic Terrain, while threatening Corviknight and Gliscor with Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, respectively. Slowbro is a great physical wall, being able to swallow physical attacks aimed at Iron Boulder like Earthquake from Excadrill and Liquidation from Barraskewda. Slowbro can also serve as a pseudo-check to Ceruledge if it has used its Eject Button, which can give a safe switch-in opportunity for Iron Boulder to take advantage of. Finally, Slowbro can deal with some Dark-types like Ting-Lu one on one with Body Press. Both Metagross and Jirachi can set Stealth Rock to soften up answers to Iron Boulder like Corviknight and Gliscor, and both have other advantages: Metagross has Knock Off to further weaken defensive checks and Bullet Punch to threaten Flutter Mane, while Jirachi can pivot Iron Boulder onto the field with U-turn. Espathra is a good setup sweeper that appreciates Iron Boulder chipping its answers into range of Dazzling Gleam while being able to run away with games once its checks, such as Ting-Lu, are gone. Hatterene prevents Iron Boulder from having to take chip damage from hazards when it has to revenge kill a threat while doing fairly well into the majority of Dark-types thanks to its part-Fairy typing.</p>"

Mighty Cleave allows Iron Boulder to take out Choice Scarf Enamorus after Stealth Rock, Ogerpon-H, and non-Sucker Punch Chien-Pao. Zen Headbutt lets Iron Boulder deal with Fighting- and Poison-types like Iron Valiant and Sneasler. Earthquake deals with Heatran, Alolan Muk, and Gholdengo, while Close Combat OHKOes Greninja, Meowscarada, and Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine can act as a wallbreaker for Iron Boulder, being able to take on physical walls such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and defensive Gholdengo with Head Smash and Flare Blitz. Hisuian Arcanine can also run a Heavy-Duty Boots set with Will-O-Wisp to annoy Kingambit. Swords Dance Ogerpon-C is an excellent partner, being able to handle Ground- and Water-types such as Mamoswine, Quagsire, and Keldeo. Glimmora is a nice special attacker that deals with walls Iron Boulder can't break through, like Quagsire and Sableye, with its colorful coverage. Glimmora's Toxic Debris comes in handy in the Fairy matchup as well, and it even removes entry hazards with Mortal Spin. Shell Smash Minior can act as a setup sweeper, being able to dent holes in Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Iron Hands so that Iron Boulder can pick them off late-game; providing a Ground immunity for the team is also much appreciated. Kleavor can set up Stealth Rock with Stone Axe, breaking Focus Sashes on common users like Ceruledge and Cloyster. Terrakion can take out Ursaluna-B, Kingambit, Archaludon, and Hisuian Goodra for Iron Boulder. Ghost-types like Dragapult, Spectrier, and Choice Scarf Flutter Mane hurt Iron Boulder's chances of sweeping, so Tyranitar serves as a great partner by checking them and providing sand to boost the team's Special Defense. Coalossal is a good partner, being able to check threats like Scizor, Corviknight, and Kingambit, which would threaten Iron Boulder. Coalossal also removes hazards and can set up its own hazards to ease Iron Boulder's sweeping. In return, Iron Boulder takes out Sneasler, Greninja, and Meowscarada for Tyranitar and Coalossal.

Calm Mind and Agility allow Iron Crown to boost its stats and Stored Power while also punishing opponents that play passively, trying to stall out dual screens. Behind dual screens, Iron Crown survives attacks like Fiery Dance from Choice Specs Iron Moth, Earth Power from Life Orb Landorus, and Knock Off from Alolan Muk, allowing it to capitalize on its weaknesses by activating Weakness Policy and boosting the power of Stored Power. Additionally, after activating its Weakness Policy and using a single Agility, Iron Crown can take on walls like Skarmory and Galarian Slowking, OHKOing the former after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOing the latter; similarly, in this position, it makes quick work of offensive foes like Choice Band Dragapult, Landorus-T, and Ogerpon-H and -W. Tachyon Cutter is a secondary move that is meant to hit foes that are immune to Stored Power, such as Alolan Muk and Meowscarada, and it also bypasses enemies with Focus Sash and Sturdy, such as Glimmora and Ogerpon-C, respectively. Focus Blast can be used in place of Tachyon Cutter or Calm Mind to hit Steel-type foes, which resist Stored Power, and Dark-type foes, which are immune to it. Once Weakness Policy is activated, Focus Blast can eliminate special walls such as Ting-Lu and Heatran after they are mildly chipped. However, it is considered risky, as Focus Blast can miss. A Timid nature is preferred, since it lets Iron Crown outspeed Choice Scarf Dragapult after an Agility. However, a Modest nature can also be considered, as it still outspeeds Choice Scarf Meowscarada after an Agility, and at +2 Special Attack, Iron Crown can OHKO Heatran.</p> <p>Deoxys-S and Scream Tail set up entry hazards and dual screens, allowing Iron Crown to survive hits and set up successfully. Indeedee-M is immune to Ghost and sets Psychic Terrain for Iron Crown, shielding it from priority moves such as Ceruledge's Shadow Sneak and Hisuian Samurott's Sucker Punch. It also provides Healing Wish support to bring Iron Crown back into shape if it gets worn down. Galarian Slowking assists Iron Crown by spreading poison through Toxic Spikes or Toxic, pressuring bulky special walls such as Ting-Lu, while also providing pivoting with Chilly Reception. Hatterene prevents foes from setting up hazards, allowing Iron Crown to come in safely, and it can also help weaken Dark-types. Iron Boulder heavily damages special walls that trouble Iron Crown such as Heatran and Hisuian Goodra. Additionally, Iron Boulder checks Fire-type threats such as Ogerpon-H, Volcarona, and Cinderace while also dissuading Cinderace from using Court Change to steal dual screens. Choice Specs Flutter Mane overwhelms Iron Crown, but Choice Scarf Iron Boulder outspeeds it and removes it. Latios provides a switch-in to Ground-type moves thanks to its immunity to them, and it removes Dragon-type foes such as Gouging Fire and Walking Wake. Hoopa-U helps in removing Ghost-types such as Gholdengo and Flutter Mane. Slowbro chips opposing Fire-type threats such as Hisuian Arcanine while also burning physical attackers, such as Barraskewda and Choice Band Excadrill, and setup sweepers, like Dragonite and Scizor, with Scald. Armarouge removes Steel-type threats that resist Iron Crown's STAB moves, such as Forretress and Iron Treads, with the combination of Aura Sphere and Armor Cannon.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Normal (Offensive Entry Hazard Remover)</h4> <p>Terapagos has no shortage of moves it can run, such as Earth Power, which lets it deal with Archaludon and Ceruledge; Scorching Sands, which lets it fish for burns against Alolan Muk and Clodsire; and Dazzling Gleam for Sableye. However, Terapagos would lose the coverage needed to OHKO Gliscor or threaten Corviknight and Gholdengo, in addition to Tera Starstorm's damage being comparable with super effective coverage if the opposing Pokemon is not 4x weak to Terapagos's coverage. Even though Calm Mind is tempting to use with Rapid Spin, losing crucial coverage hampers Terapagos's ability to keep entry hazards off.</p>",

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Terapagos leverages its incredibly powerful Normal-type STAB option in Tera Starstorm, a good Special Attack stat, and a plethora of coverage moves to become a fearsome wallbreaker on Normal teams. Tera Starstorm seriously damages neutral targets, OHKOing Galarian Weezing and 2HKOing physically defensive Toxapex and bulky Gouging Fire variants. Ice Beam wrecks Flying- and Ground-types like Gliscor, Dragonite, and Landorus-T. Earth Power hits Steel- and Rock-types like Archaludon and Garganacl, while Flamethrower hits Steel-types that don't fear Earth Power like Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight. Tera Shell allows Terapagos to greatly increase its bulk while at full health, letting it come in on strong attacks and return the favor. It also enables it to revenge kill threats like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Choice Specs Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Ursaluna-B is a great teammate for Terapagos, as they each break through what the other cannot. Both possess incredibly strong Normal-type STAB moves, and Ursaluna-B scares off Steel-types like Heatran and Gholdengo for Terapagos. In return, Terapagos hits the Grass- and Flying-types that Ursaluna-B struggles with, such as Rillaboom, Hydrapple, and Gliscor. Hisuian Zoroark is another great partner, as it provides a very handy Fighting immunity to take on threats like Body Press Archaludon and Choice Specs Kommo-o. In return, Terapagos can break through bulky answers to Hisuian Zoroark like Toxapex and Alolan Muk with its sheer power. Blissey provides Stealth Rock support and is a great special sponge for threatening special attacks like Flutter Mane's Moonblast. It can also use Thunder Wave to slow down opposing threats like Choice Specs Dragapult and Choice Specs Greninja for Terapagos to blast them with Tera Starstorm and Ice Beam while easing the burden of prediction for Terapagos by switching in on special threats like the aforementioned Greninja as well as Latios if Terapagos gets a prediction incorrect. Braviary can remove entry hazards for Terapagos with Defog, ensuring that Tera Shell stays active while being able to switch into and handle threats like Sneasler and Meowscarada for Terapagos. It can also bring Terapagos in safely with U-turn. Choice Scarf Indeedee helps massively in the Fighting and Poison matchups, hitting threats like Zamazenta, Iron Hands, and Clodsire hard to pave the way for Terapagos to break. Indeedee also provides Healing Wish support for Terapagos and blocks revenge killing attempts from Mach Punch Breloom and Sucker Punch Kingambit with Psychic Terrain. Ditto is an excellent reverse sweeper, surprising opponents trying to set up after forcing Terapagos out like Swords Dance Breloom and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Porygon2 can deal major damage to major threats like Gouging Fire and Scizor with Foul Play, letting Terapagos break them down with repeated assaults. It also functions as a blanket switch-in to many threatening attackers like Gholdengo if Terapagos mispredicts, making Terapagos's coverage moves much easier to click without fear of mispredicting. Cincinno is a scary physical sweeper and hazard remover with Tidy Up complemented by its colorful coverage, hitting Rock-types with Bullet Seed, Flying-types with Triple Axel and Rock Blast, and Fire-types with Rock Blast.</p>"

      "Offensive Entry Hazard Remover": {
        "description": "<p>Terapagos acts as a great form of entry hazard removal due to its ability to immediately threaten and outspeed most entry hazard setters like Gliscor, Skarmory, Forretress, and Great Tusk. Tera Starstorm removes weakened threats like Keldeo and Ogerpon-W and OHKOes Iron Valiant. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types, especially Gholdengo, which can come into Terapagos to spinblock it. Ice Beam OHKOes Landorus and Gliscor after Stealth Rock damage, allowing Terapagos to exert pressure against Flying teams. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Terapagos retain its ability in spite of entry hazards, letting it be a one-time check to threats like Hisuian Lilligant, Ursaluna-B, and Zamazenta. A Modest nature is preferred to hit as hard as possible, as it already outspeeds most relevant entry hazard setters without a Speed-boosting nature.</p> <p>It's vital for Terapagos to have teammates that can that can wall strong attackers, meaning Terapagos does not have to give up its ability to emergency check a foe using Tera Shell. Blissey and Braviary fulfill these roles, with Blissey dealing with special attackers like Raging Bolt, Latios, and Flutter Mane, and Braviary dealing with strong physical attackers like Sneasler and Kingambit. Blissey also provides Stealth Rock and Healing Wish to support Terapagos, and Braviary appreciates Terapagos taking Braviary's job of removing entry hazards, as it lets Braviary run Close Combat for the aforementioned Kingambit. Ursaluna-B loves Terapagos's ability to take down Corviknight and Gliscor and break Gholdengo's Air Balloon. In return, Ursaluna-B deals with Steel- and Ghost-types like Archaludon, Heatran, and Sableye. Additionally, Ursaluna-B has Vacuum Wave to pick off threats like Chien-Pao and Hisuian Lilligant, as Terapagos does not OHKO them. Hisuian Zoroark provides a Fighting immunity and deals with Keldeo and Archaludon. Furthermore, Hisuian Zoroark can disguse itself as Terapagos, forcing out foes that cannot break its Tera Shell and survive an attack, which brings in walls like Iron Hands and Hisuian Goodra that Hisuian Zoroark can inconvenience with Will-O-Wisp or Trick. Porygon2 is a defensive wall that can be run alongside Terapagos to further improve the Flying and Dragon matchup, and it has Foul Play to deal with Ceruledge and Choice Band Excadrill. Ditto is able to check threats like Gouging Fire and Ceruledge that Terapagos does not have coverage for.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <h4>Poison</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb can be used over Malignant Chain to make use of its higher PP, allowing for more chances to inflict poison and for more consistent offense. Going Itemless is an option to block Poltergeists from Ceruledge, which can otherwise blow through Poison teams, along with reducing the damage dealt by Choice-locked Knock Off users like Scizor and Meowscarada. Mean Look can be used to trap threats that have been poisoned by Salazzle or Glimmora such as Alolan Sandslash, Alolan Muk, and Clodsire to remove them. Parting Shot can be used to weaken threats attempting to remove Pecharunt like Chien-Pao, Scizor, and Baxcalibur as it switches to a teammate that is able to handle them better.</p> <h4>Ghost</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb is an option to use instead of Malignant Chain due to its higher PP; however, Malignant Chain has a higher Base Power and superior effect. Toxic can be used to synergize with Hex; however, it usually isn't worth losing a moveslot for due to Malignant Chain's already high chance of poisoning its targets. Pecharunt can opt for holding no item to take less damage from Knock Off and gain an immunity to Ceruledge's Poltergeist, although it's entirely situational, and Pecharunt appreciates the Black Sludge recovery.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Pecharunt is a solid physical wall that helps to reduce the pressure on Poison's other physical walls by soaking up hard hits from threats like Iron Hands, Ogerpon-H, and Gliscor. Hex has incredible synergy with Poison teams making use of the type's constant status-spreading to output solid damage. Shadow Ball gives a consistent form of damage against teams that can keep Poison's status-spreading to a minimum while still hitting hard. Malignant Chain helps to spread poison to power up Hex along with dealing solid damage and hitting Dark-types that would shrug off Pecharunt's Ghost-type STAB like Mandibuzz and Roaring Moon along with removing Azumarill after it's used Belly Drum thanks to Pecharunt's decent speed. Nasty Plot is used to boost Pecharunt's STAB, allowing it to break through threats like Amoonguss, Gliscor, and Swampert without much issue.</p> <p>Salazzle and Glimmora provide immense support to Pecharunt by inflicting near-unblockable Toxic thanks to Corrosion, powering up Pecharunt's Hex and putting timers on specially bulky walls like Clodsire, Alolan Muk, and Hisuian Goodra. Salazzle, with its high speed and Fire-type STAB, also provides assistance in melting through Steel- and Ice-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Froslass which can otherwise prove troublesome. Meanwhile, Glimmora can blast through pesky Fire- and Flying-types like Ninetales, Articuno, and Pelipper along with setting entry hazards which Pecharunt can help to keep around longer with its Ghost typing blocking Rapid Spin from foes such as Alolan Sandslash, Forretress, and Avalugg. Amoonguss provides a switch-in to Ground-type threats such as Great Tusk, Hippowdon, and Excadrill with its Grass typing and spreads its own status with Spore, which Pecharunt can use to power up Hex. Toxapex helps by setting up Toxic Spikes for Pecharunt to make great use of with Hex and deals with powerful setup threats like Scizor, Chien-Pao, and Okidogi thanks to Haze. Galarian Weezing provides an incredible Ground immunity for threats like Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Mamoswine, spreads status with Will-O-Wisp, and removes entry hazards in case Pecharunt loses its Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off.. Alolan Muk provides an incredible Ghost resistance and Psychic immunity, letting it switch into threats like Spectrier, Flutter Mane, and Espathra with incredible ease. Galarian Slowking helps to deal with special threats like Latios, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant with its wide coverage and break the special attackers that Pecharunt detests. Pecharunt appreciates Fighting-types like Okidogi and Sneasler breaking through annoying Dark-types like Kingambit, Darkrai, and Chien-Pao while Pecharunt can handle opposing physical walls like Toxapex and Zamazenta, which otherwise stop them in their tracks. Iron Moth enjoys Pecharunt soaking up hits aimed at it from powerful threats like Kleavor, Hisuian Arcanine, and Iron Boulder, while Iron Moth can melt threats Pecharunt dislikes such as Froslass, Sinistcha, and opposing Pecharunt.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive (Ghost)": {
        "description": "<p>Pecharunt boasts impeccable defensive stats, excellent move synergy, and a great type combination, performing really well against offense-oriented types like Fairy and Fire. Malignant Chain forces immense progress in conjunction with Poison Puppeteer and Hex as well as threatening various Fairy-types as a bonus. As mentioned earlier, Hex may be used to take advantage of targets poisoned by Malignant Chain and teammates like Dragapult and Spectrier spreading status ailments. Alternatively, Foul Play takes advantage of setup sweepers like Baxcalibur and Scizor, dissuading them from setting up in the first place. Parting Shot allows Pecharunt to escape unfavorable matchups and enables teammates like Ceruledge and Gholdengo due to the stat drops. The given EV spread allows Pecharunt to outpace Azumarill and Kingambit, pivoting out via Parting Shot or potentially picking Azumarill off when weakened with Malignant Chain.</p> <p>Flutter Mane is an excellent teammate due to its ability to remove troublesome Dark- and Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Greninja, Latios, and Baxcalibur. In return, Pecharunt slowly weakens teams by spreading poison and safely brings in Flutter Mane using Parting Shot. Gholdengo scares off Psychic-types such as Iron Crown, Deoxys-S, and Iron Boulder, while Pecharunt walls physical attackers like Ogerpon-H and Urshifu-R. Ceruledge is appreciated, as it threatens Steel and Poison teams, which have an immunity to Malignant Chain's effects and thus don't take any considerable damage from Hex. Furthermore, Pecharunt is capable of luring in specially defensive walls like Blissey, Empoleon, and Hisuian Goodra that it can take advantage of and pivoting into Ceruledge with Parting Shot, providing easy setup opportunities. Dragapult's versatility and set variety are heavily valued; Choice Specs sets threaten Dragon-types such as Gouging Fire and Raging Bolt, Hex sets complement Pecharunt very well, as they help spread status ailments, and Dragon Dance sets appreciate Pecharunt wearing down walls like Clefable and Mandibuzz to clean teams late-game. Choice Scarf Spectrier removes Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, and Kommo-o using Draining Kiss as well as offering Will-O-Wisp support to weaken wallbreakers and help with Hex spam. Brambleghast chips down foes using Spikes and provides a Ground resistance, threatening Gastrodon, Swampert, and Hippowdon. In exchange, Pecharunt switches into threats such as Cinderace, Moltres, and Cloyster. Hisuian Zoroark can switch into Ghost-type moves, offers utility options like Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp, and threatens Dark and Steel-types like Chien-Pao, Hydreigon, Archaludon, and Excadrill using Focus Blast on Choice Scarf sets. Sinistcha provides a Ground resistance, aiding against threats like Ursaluna-B and Gastrodon, and helps spread burn with Matcha Gotcha against opposing teams to enhance Hex.</p>"
