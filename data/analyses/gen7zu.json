  "Leafeon": {
    "overview": "<p>With solid Attack and Speed stats and the ability to boost all its stats with Z-Celebrate, Leafeon can make for a fearsome sweeper. Solid natural physical bulk and a decent defensive typing allow it to set up on a variety of Pokemon, such as Golem and non-Ice Beam Silvally-Fighting, as well as avoid being revenge killed by non-Flamethrower Electivire, while its aforementioned Speed allows Leafeon to outspeed or Speed tie with most common Choice Scarf users, such as Electivire and Mr. Mime, after setting up. Access to Swords Dance and Knock Off means Leafeon can also function as a wallbreaker, easily getting past Pokemon like Bronzor and Pyukumuku. However, other than those moves, Leafeon's movepool is shallow and its offensive typing is bad, leaving it walled by common Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and Altaria before setting up. Leafeon also has awful special bulk, meaning it cannot set up on any special attackers, such as Zebstrika, and easily gets revenge killed by specially offensive Choice Scarf users even after setting up, including Swanna and Simisear. The fact that it needs a Z-Move to set up means that it cannot pair with another Z-Move user, which limits teambuilding. In addition, it means Leafeon can only set up once, leaving it very vulnerable to phazing. Lastly, Leafeon faces competition as an offensive Grass-type from Sawsbuck, which has a secondary STAB move, better abilities, and access to Jump Kick, though Leafeon carves itself a niche with Z-Celebrate, Knock Off, and its great Defense.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leafeon can use a Swords Dance set with one of several Z-Moves, such as Breakneck Blitz from Double-Edge, Supersonic Skystrike from Aerial Ace, and Tectonic Rage from Dig, to break through its checks like Altaria, Gourgeist-XL, and Mawile, but this set faces a lot of competition from Sawsbuck due to the latter's STAB Double-Edge and is still completely walled by the Pokemon that its Z-Move does not target. In addition, it heavily relies on prediction, as wasting the Z-Move means the set is completely walled. Leafeon can also use its solid Speed tier to function as a Choice Scarf user that can reliably revenge kill Floatzel, but it faces competition from Sawsbuck, and its mediocre movepool and offensive typing mean it often struggles to KO other faster targets like Rapidash and Combusken. Thanks to its access to recovery in Synthesis, Leafeon can choose to include this move on a setup set with either Swords Dance or Z-Celebrate to allow it to beat defensive teams more easily as well as soft check physical attackers like Golem more consistently, but its low special bulk and the lack of a coverage move on such a set mean that it's generally less effective than Celebrate + Swords Dance. Similarly, Leafeon can use a defensive set with Synthesis, but due to bad special bulk and mediocre utility options, this set is outclassed by other defensive Grass-types like Gourgeist-XL. Chlorophyll can be used with Swords Dance sets as a sweeper for sun teams, but the strategy is quite bad and Leafeon is outclassed by Sawsbuck in this role. Lastly, a Choice Band set with Leaf Blade / Knock Off / Double-Edge / Bullet Seed can be used, where Bullet Seed is used to break through Sturdy on Pokemon like Golem and Relicanth, but this set is crippled by the Grass-type being lackluster offensively and is generally done better by Sawsbuck.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bouffalant</strong>: Bouffalant heavily walls Leafeon, as it is immune to Leaf Blade thanks to Sap Sipper, takes little damage from Leafeon's coverage options, and heavily threatens it in return.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL, Sawsbuck, and Bellossom can easily switch into Leafeon thanks to solid bulk and a resistance to its STAB moves. Notably, Gourgeist-XL is also immune to Double-Edge and takes little damage from Knock Off thanks to Colbur Berry, Sawsbuck can run Sap Sipper to be completely immune to Leaf Blade, and Bellossom can use Z-Strength Sap to set up on Leafeon.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon like Altaria, Oricorio-F, and defensive Rotom-S can come in on Leafeon with ease and threaten it with super effective moves, while Choice Scarf Swanna can revenge kill Leafeon even after it sets up.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: The likes of Rapidash, Combusken, and Simisear can easily beat Leafeon one-on-one thanks to resisting Leaf Blade and not taking much from Knock Off while threatening with powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like special Choice Scarf Electivire, Choice Specs Floatzel, Zebstrika, and Kadabra heavily threaten Leafeon due to its poor special bulk, meaning it can't set up on them.</p>",

      "Z-Celebrate": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Z-Celebrate boosts all of Leafeon's stats, allowing it to sweep with its boosted Attack and Speed while avoiding being revenge killed thanks to increased bulk. Swords Dance allows Leafeon to boost further after setting up a Z-Celebrate, allowing to OHKO much of the metagame. For example, at +3 Attack, it OHKOes Bronzor with Knock Off and has a chance to OHKO Combusken with Leaf Blade. Double-Edge is an option to round out Leafeon's coverage, hitting Pokemon like Altaria and Monferno quite hard. However, a lack of Swords Dance means Leafeon struggles to break through more defensive teams. Knock Off is Leafeon's best coverage move, hitting Pokemon like Bronzor and removing crucial items like Eviolite and Leftovers from the likes of Mareanie and Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leaf Guard must be used, as is the only ability that is compatible with Celebrate. Normalium Z is required to let Leafeon set up with Z-Celebrate. It can also be used in tandem with Double-Edge for a 190-Base Power Breakneck Blitz, which can allow it to break past Pokemon like Altaria more easily. However, this will leave Leafeon unable to set up later.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Leafeon should be preserved until late-game in order to attempt to set up and sweep. Thanks to its good Defense, it can set up on certain physical attackers like Golem and Pawniard. Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and Altaria should be removed or significantly chipped before Leafeon attempts to sweep, as otherwise they will easily prevent it from doing so. If Leafeon finds an opportunity to set up a Swords Dance in addition to Z-Celebrate, it can break through some Pokemon that it otherwise would have unable to, such as a full health Bronzor or a full health Electivire. Thanks to the increased bulk from Z-Celebrate, Leafeon can set up again on Pokemon like Choice Scarf Electivire lacking Flamethrower and non-Ice Beam Silvally-Fighting. Remember that Leafeon can only set up Z-Celebrate once, so if the opponent still has a phazer or Haze user such as Roar Altaria or Haze Mareanie alive, you should not set up until they are gone or sufficiently weakened. If you're running Double-Edge, it can be worthwhile to go for Breakneck Blitz in stead of Z-Celebrate in rare occasions, such as when it is unlikely that Leafeon will be able to sweep but it can break through a Pokemon like Altaria using its Z-Move. Due to Leafeon's great Defense, it can occasionally be used to check physical attackers like Komala. However, this set has no recovery and is thus vulnerable to getting worn down, which will also leave Leafeon unable to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Leafeon's biggest counter is Gourgeist-XL, so Pokemon that consistently check it, such as Morning Sun Rapidash and Combusken, are solid partners for Leafeon. Pokemon that can bring in Leafeon on foes it can set up on work quite well with it, such as Komala luring in Golem and U-turning out on it; Komala can also lure in Gourgeist-XL before badly poisoning it with Toxic. In return, Leafeon heavily pressures their checks. Special wallbreakers like Floatzel, Chatot, and Mr. Mime can break through the physically defensive Pokemon that wall Leafeon, such as Gourgeist-XL and Gabite, while Leafeon pressures specially defensive Pokemon in return. Stealth Rock setters like Golem pair well with Leafeon, as they wear down opposing Pokemon, especially Flying-types, allowing Leafeon to sweep more easily. Checks to faster Pokemon, especially those that can revenge kill Leafeon like Choice Scarf Swanna and Choice Scarf Rapidash, are very useful; examples include Silvally-Water and Golem, respectively. Since Leafeon needs as much HP as possible to set up reliably, entry hazard removers such as Silvally-Water, Silvally-Fighting, Altaria, and Komala are solid partners.</p>"

  "Glaceon": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier that is lacking in Ice-types, Glaceon finds a niche with its monstrous power with Choice Specs and its ability to set up with Z-Celebrate. Thanks to Choice Specs, Glaceon is able to OHKO or 2HKO most of the metagame with STAB Blizzard or Ice Beam, including foes that resist it like Combusken and Mawile. Running a Z-Celebrate set instead can make Glaceon a powerful setup sweeper by remedying its subpar Speed and improving its bulk. Unfortunately, Glaceon's defensive typing leaves little to no utility to any team, and the fact that it's susceptible to all forms of entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, is not helping its case. This is compounded by Glaceon's low Speed, which allows common attackers like Combusken, Silvally-Fighting, and Simisear to outspeed and dispose of it swiftly. Furthermore, Glaceon's limited coverage options harm its effectiveness as a Choice Specs and Z-Celebrate user, since roles like those ideally want to have access to a better coverage movepool. Glaceon also faces competition from other special wallbreakers like Exeggutor and Camerupt for their better typings and coverage moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glaceon may find itself on hail teams with the support of setters like Amaura to boost the accuracy of Blizzard, but this playstyle is both rare and flawed with the inherent lack of defensive type synergy and utility. Sleep Talk and Frost Breath can work as options on the Choice Specs set, since Sleep Talk allows Glaceon to absorb sleep moves from Jumpluff and Bellossom, while Frost Breath can bypass boosts from Duosion and physically defensive Calm Mind Beheeyem. However, Sleep Talk can be prediction dependent and, if chosen wrong, leaves Glaceon open to being set up on. Frost Breath, while always being a critical hit, is weaker than Ice Beam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Silvally-Water, Mareanie, Poliwrath, and Pyukumuku will be huge obstacles for Glaceon regardless of which set it's running, since they all take Ice Beam. They need to be wary of the immediate damage from a Hidden Power Electric on the Choice Specs set, however.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Combusken, Rapidash, and Simisear threaten Glaceon with their respective STAB Fire-type moves. They need to be cautious about switching into a Glaceon carrying Hidden Power Ground, however.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Threats like Silvally-Fighting, Poliwrath, Monferno, and specially defensive Machoke offensively pressure Glaceon with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, and Toxic poison can wear down Glaceon and limit how often it can come in and spam Ice Beam or hinder its ability to sweep with Z-Celebrate.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Glaceon's middling Speed and multiple vulnerabilities from its Ice typing mean that many faster attackers like Silvally-Dragon, Raichu, and Electivire have super effective coverage able to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Dusclops, Lickilicky, and even Kecleon can make Glaceon's job tougher by taking any of its moves and restoring HP with Rest, Wish, or Drain Punch. Dusclops can't reliably take multiple Shadow Balls, though.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball allows Glaceon 2HKO Bronzor after Stealth Rock damage and provides decent neutral coverage against Fire- and Water-types like Monferno and Pyukumuku. Hidden Power Ground nets big hits on Fire-types like Combusken, Rapidash, and Probopass. Hidden Power Electric is an alternative move that lets Glaceon hit Water-types like Silvally-Water and Poliwrath. Blizzard serves as a high-risk, high-reward move so that Glaceon can lock into its Ice-type coverage while still threatening to 2HKO bulkier Pokemon like Mareanie and Muk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is favored here to maximize attacking power, while Snow Cloak is the better ability despite hail being rare.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Glaceon lacks much defensive utility, so bring it in after a KO or via a pivot move like U-turn, Volt Switch, or Parting Shot. In addition, bringing it in on foes that do not immediately endanger it like defensive Golem, Mareanie, and entry hazard setters like Torterra and Sandslash is a great way to utilize its wallbreaking potential. Bulky Water-types like Pyukumuku and specially defensive Mareanie give Glaceon a hard time, since they can easily switch into Ice Beam. Therefore, having them weakened beforehand is ideal for Glaceon to more easily spam Ice Beam. The same applies to Fire-types like Combusken, Rapidash, and Simisear, since all of them naturally outspeed Glaceon and take it down via their STAB moves. Make sure entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes are off the field because they limit Glaceon's ability to switch in and spam Ice Beam. Special walls like Lickilicky can eat up Glaceon's moves, recover with Wish + Protect, and stall out Glaceon's moves, so having these walls weakened enough to 2HKO puts less stress on Glaceon. Predict switches carefully so Glaceon can weaken or remove Ice Beam switch-ins with its coverage moves. It should also be careful of giving a Pokemon like Z-Mirror Move Swanna or Swords Dance Bouffalant setup opportunities if using Hidden Power Ground or Shadow Ball, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Glaceon with Choice Specs is a powerhouse that fits onto offensive teams needing a strong special attacking presence. Since it will need to come in without the risk of damage being done to it, having a pivot like Silvally-Water or Choice Scarf Electivire is useful. Additionally, those two can bring Glaceon in on Grass-types like Torterra and Gourgeist-XL so it can remove them. Water-types like Pyukumuku, Silvally-Water, and Poliwrath can handle Glaceon's moves and then fight back to wear it down. Therefore, a Grass- or Electric-type partner like Simisage or Raichu helps to wear them down or remove them from the equation and make Glaceon's job easier. Entry hazard removal is essential for Glaceon to function properly by limiting residual damage. Partners like Swanna, Rotom-S, and Sandslash can clear them with Defog or Rapid Spin and pave the way for Glaceon to do its job. Another notable partner is Mareanie, which has a double purpose in absorbing Toxic Spikes and functioning as a Fighting- and Fire-type check to the likes of Combusken, Silvally-Fighting, and Rapidash. Since special walls are going to be a problem for Glaceon, having a physical wallbreaking partner like Choice Band Komala, Swords Dance Bouffalant, or Choice Band Golem is good, since they all have little to no issue taking down the special walls in the tier like Lickilicky, Dusclops, and Muk.</p>"
      },
      "Z-Celebrate": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Celebrate is a one-time setup move thanks to Normalium Z. Shadow Ball allows Glaceon to reliably hit walls like Bronzor and Dusclops. Hidden Power Ground deals decent damage to Mareanie, Mawile, and Monferno and, after the Celebrate boost, can potentially OHKO them. Alternatively, Hidden Power Electric allows Glaceon to nail Water-type switch-ins like Mareanie, Silvally-Water, and Poliwrath.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is preferred over Modest for the extra Speed boost to sweep mid- to late-game. The Speed increase also allows +1 Glaceon to outspeed Raichu, Floatzel, and Choice Scarf Toucannon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keeping Glaceon healthy and away from entry hazards like Stealth Rock is a must so it can sweep. Although Choice Scarf users like Electivire outspeed Glaceon after it uses Z-Celebrate, preserving its bulk means that it can tank attacks. It should still be mindful of faster threats on the opposing team before using Z-Celebrate, however. Fire-types like Combusken, Rapidash, and Simisear threaten Glaceon and prevent it from setting up, so be sure to remove them before attempting to sweep if Glaceon lacks Hidden Power Ground. In addition, Fighting-types like Combusken, offensive Silvally-Fighting, and specially defensive Machoke all threaten Glaceon and can prevent it from setting up. Severely weakening these threats before attempting to sweep is critical. Special walls and bulky Water-types like Lickilicky, Assault Vest Kecleon, Mareanie, and Pyukumuku will prevent Glaceon its sweeping and must be removed or severely weakened before Glaceon uses its Z-Move. Glaceon can afford to set up on stronger but slower attackers like Torterra and Marowak thanks to the added bulk from Z-Celebrate; this does, however, make it more vulnerable to Choice Scarf and priority users in the process. Because Glaceon only has one opportunity to set up, the best time to sweep is late-game when all the aforementioned threats are gone. It is also wise to use Z-Celebrate on a Pokemon that Glaceon sends running like Gourgeist-XL, Torterra, or Altaria.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Glaceon is going to want to come in safely, U-turn or Volt Switch users like Silvally-Water, Electivire, and Rotom-S can bring it in safely. Glaceon can take out Grass-types for Silvally-Water and deals with Ground-types that annoy Electivire and Rotom-S. Entry hazards will wear down Glaceon and jeopardize its opportunities to rely on its bulk when setting up. Therefore, having a Defogger or spinner like Silvally-Water, Altaria, Sandslash, or Komala can remove said hazards and allow Glaceon a safe switch in. Entry hazard setters like Metang, Crustle, and Mareanie are crucial because after Glaceon sets up, entry hazards provide the chip damage to guarantee OHKOs against Rapidash, Granbull, and Furfrou. While Glaceon does hit a nice amount of Speed after using Z-Celebrate, it still is slower than a few threats like Choice Scarf Electivire and Rapidash. Because of this, having a teammate to deal with the likes of these threats like physically defensive Golem or Sandslash will put less pressure on Glaceon and give it more chances to set up and sweep. Since Fire- and Fighting-types will be putting offensive pressure on Glaceon, having a teammate like Poliwrath, Beheeyem, Mareanie, Kadabra, or Mr. Mime to put the pressure right back on them helps it out greatly. Having an answer to the special walls of the tier is definitely a must. Teammates like Swords Dance Combusken, Choice Band Muk, and Swords Dance Silvally-Fighting can severely damage them or remove them from the equation completely.</p>"

  "Avalugg": {
    "overview": "<p>With great physical bulk, reliable recovery, and access to Rapid Spin, Avalugg can find itself a niche role on stall teams in the ZU metagame. Thanks to its sky-high Defense stat, Avalugg can stomach hits from a variety of physical attackers in the tier including Pinsir, Choice Band Komala, and Torterra. Rapid Spin allows it to remove entry hazards for the team, especially against certain Stealth Rock users such as Torterra, Sandslash, Marowak, and Gabite due to its great matchup versus them. However, since Avalugg is a grounded pure Ice-type, it is weak to entry all forms of entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, and is unable to beat entry hazard setters such as Mawile, Bronzor, and Explosion Golem, thus not making it the best form of entry hazard removal in the tier. In addition, its extremely low Special Defense stat leaves it vulnerable to special attackers such as Combusken, Swanna, and Electivire. Avalugg faces tough competition as a form of entry hazard removal, as Sandslash and Komala provide better role compression and are not weak to Stealth Rock. Lastly, Avalugg is only truly viable on stall teams and requires a considerable amount of support from its teammates, such as a special wall like Bronzor, to take special hits for it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earthquake can be used to catch Pokemon such as Probopass, Combusken, Raichu, and Simisear as they switch in, as they all can take advantage of Avalugg. It is generally not preferred, however, as Avalugg must forego using Toxic or Roar in the last slot, and the utility those two moves provide is superior.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Attacking Threats</strong>: Due to Avalugg's poor base Special Defense, a majority of special attackers threaten Avalugg. Combusken, Simisear, Beheeyem, and Floatzel are all examples of Pokemon that have the ability to OHKO Avalugg.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks</strong>: While Avalugg boasts phenomenal bulk, it has a poor defensive typing that leaves it vulnerable to Fire-, Fighting-, Steel-, and Rock-type attacks. As a result, super effective coverage from strong physical attackers like Head Smash Rampardos and Shell Smash boosted Crustle can eliminate Avalugg.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Avalugg is weak to all forms of entry hazards; Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes are all detrimental to it in battle. This forces Avalugg to use Recover often in order to stay at as high HP as possible; thus, Avalugg can easily be taken advantage of by offensive threats, as they can switch in on a predicted Recover.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic prevents Avalugg from staying in for extended periods of time and prevents Avalugg from indefinitely spinning on Stealth Rock setters, as well as checking certain Pokemon such as Rapidash and Swords Dance Pinsir.</p>",

      "Defensive Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Avalugg to switch in on entry hazard setters such as Torterra, Sandslash, Marowak, Crustle, and Smeargle and remove Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Sticky Web to support the team. Avalanche gives Avalugg an Ice-type STAB move that move has great synergy with Avalugg's slow base Speed and high base Attack, dealing great damage if Avalugg is hit first on that turn. Toxic can be used to cripple switch-ins such as Gourgeist-XL, Combusken, and Simipour, which provides more utility. Roar allows Avalugg to phaze Pokemon that try to set up on it such as Silvally-Fighting, Pinsir, and Pawniard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment alongside an Impish nature allows Avalugg to become the best physical wall it can be to take on Swords Dance users such as Pinsir and Leafeon. Sturdy is Avalugg's best ability, as it  gives it the opportunity to phaze a setup sweeper or OHKO a threat with Avalanche such as Altaria or Marowak when at full HP. Leftovers gives Avalugg passive recovery, while Rocky Helmet wears down physical attackers using contact moves such as Komala.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Avalugg in on physical attackers such as Pinsir, Komala, Torterra, and Marowak, as Avalugg can take their hits quite comfortably. Also, directly switch in Avalugg on a predicted Stealth Rock from setters that it can spin on and beat such as Torterra, Sandslash, Marowak, and Gabite. It is best to keep Avalugg as healthy as possible throughout the match, as it can continually check physical attackers and remove entry hazards when needed. Therefore, Avalugg will have to use Recover a considerable amount, potentially letting it be taken advantage of. Avalugg is also able to throw out a Toxic on a predicted switch-in as well as Toxic stall a majority of physical attackers. Use Roar to phaze setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Pinsir and Silvally-Fighting. It is best to avoid Toxic poison from Bronzor, as that will then put a timer on Avalugg. If this happens, it is best to switch out Avalugg for a Heal Bell user to cure Avalugg of status. Avalugg must also avoid taking special hits, as its poor special bulk will not allow it to take special attacks from Combusken, Swanna, and Simisear. Against these foes, it is best to switch out Avalugg for Pokemon better suited to handle special attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special walls such as Bronzor, Mareanie, and Lickilicky can sponge special attacks that threaten Avalugg; in return, Avalugg can take physical hits for them. Lickilicky is especially notable, as it also provides Wish support and can serve as a cleric with Heal Bell. Altaria and Beheeyem can beat Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Dusknoir that attempt to act as a spinblocker to Avalugg. Defoggers such as Silvally-Fighting and Vibrava can remove Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock so that Avalugg does not get whittled down too far over the course of the match, and Poison-types like Mareanie and Muk can absorb Toxic Spikes. Silvally-Dragon, Gourgeist-XL, and Pyukumuku can be excellent partners for Avalugg, as they complement its weaknesses and can check Pokemon such as Combusken, Silvally-Water, Silvally-Fighting, and Floatzel.</p>"

  "Raichu": {
    "overview": "<p>Raichu is one of the fastest effective wallbreakers in ZU, making it easy to fit onto teams that don't have switch-ins to Pokemon that slower wallbreakers might invite in. A potent Electric STAB type means that Raichu excels at pressuring the myriad of Water-types present in ZU, such as Silvally-Water, Swanna, and Mareanie, and it is complemented by strong coverage moves as well as the ability to boost its Special Attack with Nasty Plot to help set it apart from other Electric-types in ZU. Raichu's access to Focus Blast in particular is crucial for breaking through many prominent special checks, such as Lickilicky, Probopass, and Assault Vest Komala. However, Raichu is frail and usually only offers an Electric immunity to teams while burdening them by being OHKOed by nearly every physical attacker in ZU. Its base 90 Special Attack is unimpressive as well, often leaving Raichu short of achieving KOs, particularly without a Nasty Plot boost. Even Raichu's great Speed often isn't enough to let it succeed due to Floatzel's superior Speed and huge popularity in ZU. Fellow Electric-types Electivire and Zebstrika also give Raichu tough competition, the former of which has better bulk, type coverage, and power and the latter of which is faster than Floatzel. Raichu needs to stick to its strengths to be viable in ZU, but when it does, it is possibly the best Nasty Plot sweeper in the tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Electrium Z can be used instead of Fightinium Z to give Raichu a stronger attack against Pokemon like Muk and Bronzor. The downside of this is that Raichu can no longer break through Lickilicky, Bouffalant, Electivire, or Golem as easily. Grass Knot, Volt Switch, Surf, Substitute, Encore, and Signal Beam can all be used over either Hidden Power Ice or Nasty Plot, but they generally offer inferior type coverage or mediocre and situational usefulness. Be aware that Surf is an event move that will lock Raichu into the Static ability and is illegal with Nasty Plot. Also be aware that Raichu lacking Nasty Plot is often outclassed by Zebstrika due to the latter's better speed and access to Overheat. Raichu can go physical or mixed with Volt Tackle and Extreme Speed, but physical sets are walled much more easily, face more competition from Electivire and Zebstrika, and are again made less appealing by the fact that Extreme Speed is an event move that locks Raichu into Static as an ability. Choice Specs and Choice Scarf sets can be somewhat effective, but they are still usually outclassed by Zebstrika and Electivire.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Strong attackers that outpace Raichu can often KO it before it can retaliate. Floatzel, Purugly, and Ninjask do this without a Choice Scarf, while most Choice Scarf users can outpace and KO Raichu. Effective Choice Scarf users for this role include Electivire, Pinsir, and Rapidash. Electivire can also take any one hit from an unboosted Raichu, including All-Out Pummeling.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest Users</strong>: Raichu can be checked by Assault Vest users, though some are OHKOed by a boosted All-Out Pummeling. Kecleon can dodge All-Out Pummeling with Shadow Sneak and beat Raichu fairly reliably if it has Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch to 2HKO Raichu after Stealth Rock. Assault Vest Komala and Bouffalant can check unboosted Raichu, but All-Out Pummeling will still do heavy damage. Komala in particular takes 67-80% from All-Out Pummeling, so it needs to be healthy to check Raichu.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Curse Muk is not 2HKOed by +2 Thunderbolt unless Raichu has a Life Orb and can 2HKO back with Poison Jab, while Choice Band Muk is only OHKOed by a boosted Gigavolt Havoc and KOes back with Gunk Shot. Bronzor can take one boosted hit and cripple Raichu with Toxic. Dusclops is only 3HKOed by a boosted Thunderbolt and can hit back with Toxic or Night Shade. Cradily survives any hit except for a boosted All-Out Pummeling or Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast and can use Toxic or Rock Slide in return.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Silvally-Ground survives most boosted attacks from Raichu and can KO back with Multi-Attack. Golem can check Raichu if its Sturdy is intact. Specially defensive Camerupt can usually survive an All-Out Pummeling after Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery and KO back with Earthquake or Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: While uncommon in ZU, attacks with boosted priority will heavily damage Raichu. Sucker Punch from Pawniard, Golem, and Kecleon and Mach Punch from Monferno can heavily damage Raichu due to its poor physical bulk.</p>",

It can OHKO Probopass and offensive Golem with its Sturdy broken and 2HKO specially defensive Golem, as well as hitting ZU's many Normal-types super effectively, OHKOing or nearly OHKOing defensive ones such as Lickilicky, Assault Vest Komala, and Vigoroth after a Nasty Plot boost when boosted by Fightinium Z or Life Orb. The ability to break through bulky Normal-types after a Nasty Plot boost makes Raichu very difficult to wall. Hidden Power Ice lets Raichu take out Gabite after a Nasty Plot Boost while hitting various Grass- and Ground-types hard without risking missing Focus Blast. Altaria is also hit much harder by Hidden Power Ice than by Thunderbolt, and it is always OHKOed at +2 after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature is necessary to outspeed Pokemon like Kadabra and Rapidash while hitting as hard as possible. Lightning Rod is the chosen ability to block Volt Switch and force Pokemon like Electivire and Probopass to predict correctly or risk giving Raichu a Special Attack boost. Fightinium Z is used over other Z-Crystals to give Raichu a 190-Base Power Fighting-type attack with perfect accuracy that can break through the many Normal-types in the tier, as well as taking out bulky Golem and offensive Komala without a boost. Life Orb is a good item choice if Raichu's team already has a Z-Crystal user, because Raichu needs to hit as hard as possible and will often fall to attacks with or without the recoil from Life Orb. Life Orb can let Raichu achieve some KOs it would otherwise miss or require All-Out Pummeling to accomplish, such as against Gourgeist-XL and physically bulky Golem after Stealth Rock with a +2 Hidden Power Ice. Physically bulky Golem only has a 6.3% change to be KOed by a +2 Hidden Power Ice without Life Orb, forcing Raichu to use its Z-Move or risk missing Focus Blast. However, the damage from Life Orb can rack up in combination with entry hazards or status damage to put Raichu in range of even very weak attacks such as Gourgeist's Foul Play and Golem's Sucker Punch. If using Life Orb, change Raichu's HP IVs to 29 to take less recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Raichu can be used either as a battering ram to break a defensive core early- or mid-game or as a fast sweeper late-game. Try to put Raichu into situations where it will force switches, such as against slower Water- and Flying-types or against passive Pokemon that cannot significantly damage it, so that it can boost with Nasty Plot to break through the opposing team. Switching Raichu in directly will nearly always be hazardous, so when possible, bring Raichu in safely through pivoting moves such as U-turn and Parting Shot or send it in after a teammate has fainted. There may not be very many opportunities to set up with Raichu over the course of a battle, and against some offensive teams, there might not be any. If Raichu doesn't need to break through any walls on the opponent's team, it can still be very useful for its high Speed tier and decently powerful attacks.</p> <p>This set is very effective versus stall and bulky teams because the only relevant Unaware user in ZU, Pyukumuku, is hit super effectively by Thunderbolt. Lickilicky, the most prominent special wall on stall teams, is always OHKOed by +2 All-Out Pummeling without concerns of missing. However, beware that Lickilicky can sometimes dodge the KO with Protect, as +2 Focus Blast does not always KO after a weakened All-Out Pummeling, and +2 Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast is not a guaranteed OHKO either. A small amount of chip damage on Lickilicky can greatly boost Life Orb Raichu's odds of breaking stall.</p> <p>Choose All-Out Pummeling's target carefully, but be aware that missing Focus Blast against Komala and Golem will often mean the end of Raichu. A neutral All-Out Pummeling hits significantly harder than a neutral Thunderbolt or a super effective Hidden Power Ice, so using it on a target that is not weak to Fighting can sometimes be advantageous. For example, offensive Silvally-Fighting is never OHKOed by a +2 Thunderbolt without Life Orb but will always be KOed by a boosted All-Out Pummeling. Be aware that without Life Orb, boosted Thunderbolts are not that strong and fail to 2HKO some bulky Pokemon like Muk and Bronzor. While Raichu can block Volt Switch from Electivire, Zebstrika, and Probopass, switching into the wrong move from any of these Pokemon can be the last thing Raichu does in a battle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Raichu appreciates Pokemon that can take physical hits, especially Ground-type attacks and Water-type attacks from Floatzel. Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Servine, and Leafeon resist both those types and can check Choice Scarf Electivire. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Altaria, Swanna, and Bronzor can also switch into Ground-type attacks for Raichu. Raichu also pairs well with other special sweepers that appreciate its ability to weaken or KO special walls, such as Chatot, Swanna, and Kadabra. Swanna and Chatot again cover Raichu's Ground weakness, while Raichu blocks Volt Switches aimed at them. Silvally formes, Probopass, Monferno, and Komala can all use pivoting moves to help circumvent Raichu's frailty and bring it in safely. Silvally-Water in particular can help check Floatzel and Golem while luring Electric attacks for Raichu to switch into. Powerful physical attackers such as Rampardos and Komala can take out special walls for Raichu, allowing it to sweep without needing to find an opportunity to set up a Nasty Plot boost. Memento, dual screens, and Parting Shot from Pokemon such as Misdreavus, Dugtrio, Meowstic, and Silvally can weaken incoming attacks to help Raichu set up.</p>"

  "Sandslash": {
    "overview": "<p>Sandslash sets itself apart from other Pokemon in the ZU metagame thanks to its access to both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock and its Ground typing that gives it a resistance to Stealth Rock. Its solid Defense stat lets it successfully check a handful of physical Pokemon such as Electivire, Golem, and Muk. Sandslash provides much-needed role compression for teams lacking entry hazards, hazard removal, and an Electric-type immunity. Unfortunately, Sandslash's poor Special Defense makes it easy prey for common special attackers such as a multitude of Silvally formes, Swanna, and Kadabra. In addition, Sandslash lacks reliable recovery, which can be a problem when switching in to remove hazards. Sandslash faces competition as a spinner from Avalugg and Komala, both of which have access to reliable recovery.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandslash can run Stone Edge over Knock Off in order to hit Pokemon that it would otherwise have trouble dealing with such as Altaria, Rotom-S, and Pinsir. Lum Berry can be run over Leftovers in order to deter status, but Sandslash much appreciates the passive recovery that Leftovers grants. A more offensive set with an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe coupled with a Jolly nature can be used if your team is extremely reliant on removal or hazards. In addition, this set allows Sandslash to better deal with Pawniard and Combusken lacking Speed boosts. Sandslash can utilize a Swords Dance set running Life Orb or Rockium Z, which can run a multitude of coverage moves such as Poison Jab for Granbull and Shiinotic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types that resist Sandslash's Ground-type STAB attacks such as Torterra, Leafeon, Exeggutor, Simisage, and Gourgeist-XL all threaten it. Torterra is worth noting because it is primarily used as a Stealth Rock setter and forces Sandslash, your entry hazard remover, out; however, it dislikes having its Leftovers removed. Gourgeist-XL excels as a Sandslash check thanks to its Ghost typing, which allows it to spinblock, and its access to Will-O-Wisp, which allows it to completely wall non-Toxic Sandslash.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Dusclops, Gourgeist-XL, and Drifblim are able to successfully stop Sandslash from removing entry hazards via Rapid Spin. Additionally, several of these Pokemon tend to run Will-O-Wisp. However, Dusclops dislikes Knock Off, and Misdreavus hates being statused by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-type Pokemon such as Silvally-Water, Swanna, and Poliwrath are all able to threaten Sandslash. Silvally-Water is worth mentioning due to its ability to remove entry hazards as well as utilize U-turn and Parting Shot to gain momentum. Swanna is also able to remove hazards but has to be careful of the rare Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Beheeyem, Simisear, and Swanna all heavily threaten Sandslash. Kadabra is worth a special mention due to its ability Magic Guard and its common set running both Counter and Focus Sash.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rapid Spin": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Sandslash to remove entry hazards from its side of the field. Earthquake allows Sandslash to threaten Pokemon such as Electivire, Golem, Rapidash, and Muk. Knock Off provides Sandslash with a way to chip switch-ins as well as threaten spinblockers such as Dusclops and Misdreavus. Additionally, it allows Sandslash to remove important items from Pokemon that check it such as Bronzor's Eviolite and Poliwrath's Leftovers. If the team already has a Stealth Rock user or Knock Off support, Toxic can be used to wear down common switch-ins such as Gourgeist-XL and several Silvally formes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Figy Berry provides Sandslash with a one-time recovery option that can increase its survivability and allows it to stay in on physical attackers like Electivire without crippled by Ice Punch while also improving its matchup against other physical attackers like Swords Dance Combusken. Alternatively, Leftovers provide Sandslash with passive recovery, which somewhat negates the damage it takes when switching into entry hazards in order to use Rapid Spin and serves Sandslash better against slower teams. Maximum HP investment is essential for allowing Sandslash to remove entry hazards as effectively as possible. In order to outspeed Golem, the most common Stealth Rock user in ZU, Sandslash requires 96 Speed EVs. Lastly, 160 Defense EVs grant Sandslash greater bulk so it can remain unthreatened by physical Pokemon that it's trying to check.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sandslash's main role is to remove entry hazards, so it should come in on Pokemon that set them like Golem, Crustle, and Carbink. Sandslash should prioritize setting Stealth Rock on physical Pokemon it is able to wall such as Crustle, Electivire, and Mawile. Leftovers is Sandslash’s main form of recovery, so Sandslash should avoid being hit with Knock Off. In the same vein, Sandslash should not repeatedly switch into physical attackers such as Rapidash and Golem because of how easy it is to wear down. Sandslash should also be wary of special coverage moves such as Ice Beam on Kecleon and Silvally-Fighting due to its lackluster Special Defense. If using Toxic, Sandslash should try to cripple common switch-ins such as Gourgeist-XL, Poliwrath, and Silvally formes that may try to use Defog. Sandslash should avoid becoming crippled with status from Pokemon such as Golem, Mawile, Rapidash, and Bronzor, as this greatly reduces its ability to remove hazards.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sandslash fits best on balance or bulky offense teams that lack entry hazard support or a dedicated remover. Thus, Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards such as Swanna, Combusken, and Pinsir all pair well with Sandslash, as do Pokemon that appreciate Stealth Rock support such as Exeggutor, Swanna, and Toucannon. These Pokemon also appreciate Sandslash's ability to check Rapidash, Electivire, and Muk. Due to Sandslash's poor Special Defense stat, it pairs well with Pokemon that wall special attackers, such as Lickilicky, Komala, Kecleon, Bronzor, and Muk. Lickilicky and Komala are worth a special mention because of their access to Wish. Pokemon that can absorb or remove status effects for Sandslash such as Komala, Heal Bell Lickilicky, and Guts Machoke make particularly effective partners. Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Dusclops are able to block Sandslash from removing hazards; wallbreakers that can remove these Ghost-types include Exeggutor, Swanna, and Simipour. Sandslash is threatened by Grass-types such as Exeggutor, Leafeon, and Shiinotic, so Pokemon that check them such as Rapidash, Combusken, and Swanna make for great partners. Torterra is an especially notable Grass-type, as it's one of the few Stealth Rock users that Sandslash is unable to check. Pokemon like Toucannon that can handle Torterra make for ideal partners as a result. This is also true of Bronzor, especially if Knock Off is not being run. Lastly, Sandslash appreciates Pokemon that can check prominent Water-types that threaten it such as Swanna and Silvally-Water. Electivire is the most notable, as it checks both of these Pokemon, while Sandslash is able to check Golem for Electivire in return.</p>"

  "Golduck": {
    "overview": "<p>Golduck is a premier rain sweeper in ZU, using its good power and speed in conjunction with its excellent coverage to blow away offensive and defensive teams alike. Its Speed is bolstered to incredible levels when rain is up, letting it outspeed every common Choice Scarf user in the tier. Because of this, it can even afford to run a Modest nature, which bolsters its already good Special Attack even further. Golduck also sports a very good movepool that allows it to break through several typical checks to Water-types, such as Mareanie, with little issue by running coverage moves such as Synchronoise. Unfortunately, Golduck is heavily reliant on rain to do its job, as it is much less powerful when it is not raining and is easily revenge killed. It faces pretty stiff competition from other, less restrictive Water-types such as Simipour and Swanna when used outside of full rain teams. It is also annoyed by dedicated special walls such as Lickilicky, which can stand up to it despite its power. Golduck is also very vulnerable to residual damage, as Life Orb recoil in addition to taking damage from all entry hazards often leaves it being chipped down into the damage range of priority moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Specs can be used to give Golduck some serious power behind Hydro Pump and allows it to pick up some OHKOs with Ice Beam that it would not normally be able to achieve. However, this is not generally recommended; Choice Specs Golduck can be easily played around by teams with a dedicated special wall. It also requires immaculate prediction to work around Pokemon that resist Water-type moves. In addition, it is largely outclassed by Floatzel, which can utilize Switcheroo to cripple common switch-ins while also being faster. Calm Mind can be used to improve Golduck's matchup against bulkier teams while allowing it to break through some of its common defensive checks. Golduck has issues finding a time to set up, however, and it can't afford to drop any of its usual moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Many of the tier's specially bulky Pokemon can handle Golduck. Lickilicky is a hugely irritating Pokemon for Golduck to deal with. While it fails to safely switch in, once it is in, it is one of Golduck's best checks, being able to stall out rain turns using Protect and Wish while threatening to badly poison Golduck with Toxic. Assault Vest Kecleon and Cradily do well against the standard Life Orb set, although Kecleon is heavily damaged by Hydro Vortex, and Cradily must watch out for the rare Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Many of the tier's Grass-types can tank one Ice Beam and OHKO Golduck in return with their STAB moves. Servine, Bellossom, and Shiinotic can all take an Ice Beam and either cripple or take out Golduck.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Silvally-Water is never 2HKOed by Hydro Pump without Stealth Rock damage, and variants with Thunderbolt threaten to 2HKO in return. Pyukumuku can also stall out rain turns with Recover before threatening to poison or trap Golduck, depending on the variant. Floatzel can't confidently switch in, but Swift Swim variants outrun Golduck and can revenge kill it after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Life Orb recoil and a vulnerability to entry hazards mean that Golduck gets chipped down pretty easily. This can put it in range of priority moves users such as Pawniard, Kecleon, and Purugly, although they need significant chip beforehand to take it out entirely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Rain Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rain Dance allows Golduck to set up rain for itself and act as emergency rain support for its teammates on dedicated rain teams. Ice Beam provides valuable coverage against Grass-types that resist Hydro Pump, OHKOing Leafeon and having upwards of an 85% chance to OHKO Exeggutor if Stealth Rock is up. Synchronoise allows Golduck to muscle through Poliwrath and Mareanie, which would be good checks otherwise. It also provides decent chip damage against Silvally-Water. Focus Blast is an alternative option that hits targets such as Cradily and Lapras hard, but its targets are generally much less common in the metagame, and a rain-boosted Hydro Pump hits almost everything else harder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item, as it cranks Golduck's power up and allows it to achieve greater damage with its coverage moves. For example, Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam will always KO Leafeon, while unboosted Ice Beam has a much lower chance of doing so. Exeggutor will also always survive an Ice Beam if it is not powered up by Life Orb. Waterium Z is an alternative option that gives Golduck a ludicrously powerful one-time nuke that improves its matchup against bulkier foes such as Dusclops and Assault Vest Kecleon while seriously denting most Pokemon and circumventing Hydro Pump's meager accuracy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golduck can be used as both a wallbreaker and a sweeper. Sets utilizing Waterium Z are adept at wallbreaking, while Life Orb sets are better suited for sweeping, but both sets are capable of doing either should the situation arise. Rain Dance should be used on Pokemon that Golduck forces out, such as Camerupt and Altaria, in order to avoid unnecessary chip damage onto Golduck. Golduck's checks need to be weakened before a sweep is attempted, as most of ZU's special walls can stall Golduck out while forcing it to take chip damage from Life Orb recoil. Golduck has a tendency to fall into the damage range of priority moves coming from users such as Kecleon and Purugly if it has taken too much prior chip damage. It is also frail and should not be switched into any attacks if at all possible. Bringing it in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch avoids such a scenario. Golduck also despises status, as it is crippled by both paralysis and Toxic, so play carefully when Pokemon that can inflict these, such as Lickilicky, Bronzor, and Dusclops, are on the field.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golduck is a natural fit on full rain teams thanks to the sweeping and breaking power it provides them. Thus, rain setters are mandatory teammates on such a team. Volbeat works incredibly well on rain teams, as it can set up rain while also giving Golduck easy points of entry thanks to its slow U-turn and its ability to lock foes into unfavorable moves with Encore. Electrode is an alternate option that can bring Golduck and its teammates in using Volt Switch while also annoying opposing walls with Taunt. Entry hazard support is highly recommended when using Golduck, as it really appreciates the extra chip damage when attempting to sweep through teams. Relicanth is a great choice for rain teams looking to set up Stealth Rock, as it has access to both Rain Dance and Stealth Rock while also being able to do some serious damage with Head Smash, as well as potentially allowing Golduck to switch in for free by KOing itself with recoil damage. Golduck appreciates teammates with some physical wallbreaking power to take down checks such as Lickilicky and Servine. Poliwrath and Beartic are both rain sweepers that can smash through Lickilicky with little issue while also threatening Grass-types thanks to their Ice-type coverage. Swanna is another option that can effectively cleave through Grass-types while also using Roost to keep itself healthy throughout the match. While Golduck is usually found on full rain teams, it can also function as a cleaner on standard offensive teams. Teams that utilize Golduck in this fashion need to have ways to chip down Golduck's checks and prepare the battlefield for it to clean late-game. Knock Off users can be used to annoy bulkier Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Kecleon while also removing Eviolite from threats such as Dusclops. Pivots such as Electivire and Komala can bring Golduck in safely against something that does not immediately threaten it, which is imperative, as Golduck will need to set up rain for itself. Crippling these Pokemon with status from the likes of Bronzor and Altaria is an option as well. Mixed Simisage is an exemplary partner, as it can utilize Knock Off while also threatening several Water-types that Golduck struggles with, such as Silvally-Water and Pyukumuku. Hazard removal is highly recommended, as Golduck wants to be as healthy as possible before it attempts a sweep. As such, Rapid Spin or Defog support from a teammate such as Komala or Silvally-Dragon is very nice.</p>"

  "Poliwrath": {
    "overview": "<p>Poliwrath is a flexible Pokemon that can act as a physical wall or tank that can check common Pokemon in the tier such as Combusken, Golem, Simipour, and Floatzel. thanks to its great defensive typing, decent mixed bulk, and access to Water Absorb. In addition, access to Circle Throw enables it to better check setup Pokemon such as Swords Dance Pinsir, Bulk Up Komala, and Curse Muk. Unfortunately, Poliwrath is weak to a handful of common threats such as Electivire, Leafeon, and Granbull, and despite it being a bulky Water-type with Water Absorb, Poliwrath's part Fighting typing and lack of reliable recovery make it unable to check Water-types such as Swanna, Mareanie, and Silvally-Water. In addition, Poliwrath's Fighting-type STAB moves are usually subpar, which makes it a somewhat shakier check to Normal-types such as Choice Band Komala and Bouffalant compared to other Fighting-types such as Silvally-Fighting and Machoke. Furthermore, Poliwrath also faces stiff competition from Pokemon such as Mareanie, Silvally-Water, and Silvally-Fighting. Mareanie has a superior defensive typing, better utility, and much more longevity thanks to Recover and Regenerator, while Silvally-Water and Silvally-Fighting both offer better utility due to their higher Speed, access to Defog, and ability to pivot. Furthermore, unlike Poliwrath, Silvally-Water acts as a great blanket check to Water-types due to its access to Thunderbolt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poliwrath can run a standalone rain sweeper set with Swift Swim and Rain Dance, Hydro Pump, Focus Blast, and Ice Beam for coverage with a Life Orb, Waterium Z, or Fightinium Z. Similarly, a Belly Drum set can be used as a rain sweeper and lethal wincon on weather teams. However, being able to use Belly Drum and survive an incoming attack is uncommon for Poliwrath, so it usually lacks good setup opportunities. A set utilizing Substitute, Toxic, and Focus Punch can be used to break past more defensive teams. In particular, this enables Poliwrath to use a powerful physical Fighting-type STAB attack. Physically defensive Poliwrath can use Rest + Sleep Talk to increase longevity and relieve the pressure of status effects. However, a the lack of Toxic and needing Rest for recovery make Poliwrath especially passive, so this set should only be used on defensive teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Sawsbuck, Simisage, and Leafeon all threaten Poliwrath with their STAB moves, though they are scared of Ice Beam. Bulkier Grass-types such as Shiinotic, Bellossom, and Servine wall Poliwrath and force it out. In particular, Bellossom can use Poliwrath as setup fodder, but it has to scout for Circle Throw to ensure that it can reliably set up on Poliwrath.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Rotom-S, Electivire, and Raichu are all able to threaten Poliwrath with their respective STAB moves. Raichu is worth mentioning due to its ability to use defensive Poliwrath as setup fodder, while Rotom-S can threaten Poliwrath with both its Flying- and Electric-type STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Swanna, Toucannon, and Jumpluff all threaten Poliwrath. Swanna is worth a special mention due to its ability to reliably switch into Poliwrath's STAB moves and Ice Beam and having Rain Dance and Hydration to bypass Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to Poliwrath's lack of reliable recovery, chip damage can be detrimental to it. This includes chip damage from entry hazards and status from Mareanie, Dusclops, and Bronzor.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While Vacuum Wave is much weaker than Focus Blast and leaves Poliwrath walled by bulky Pokemon such as Silvally-Water and specially defensive Komala, it is a more reliable STAB move that allows Poliwrath to pick off weakened threats such as Custap Berry Golem, Silvally, and Pawniard. Toxic can also be run over Focus Blast so Poliwrath can cripple switch-ins such as Swanna and Shiinotic. Ice Beam allows Poliwrath to hit Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Shiinotic while also hitting Flying-types that may try to switch in such as Rotom-S and Altaria. Protect provides a more effective way to accumulate passive recovery and can be used to scout Choice Scarf users such as Electivire.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>144 Speed EVs allow Poliwrath to outspeed Adamant Golem and Adamant Torterra. A Modest nature and maximum EVs into Special Attack maximize Poliwrath's power, while the remaining EVs go into HP to make Poliwrath bulkier. Water Absorb is used so that Poliwrath can check Water-type Pokemon such as Simipour and Floatzel. Fightinium Z allows Poliwrath to bypass the inaccuracy of Focus Blast and to break through Pokemon such as Silvally-Dragon, Simipour, and Toucannon. It also makes Poliwrath a much more reliable offensive check to bulky Normal-types such as Lickilicky, Komala, Bouffalant, and Vigoroth.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Poliwrath mainly functions as a tank, which means it should prioritize switching into Pokemon it can reliably check such as Combusken, Simipour, Pinsir, and Floatzel. Once Poliwrath is on the field, it should look to attack foes and predict switch-ins accordingly. For example, Poliwrath can switch into Pinsir and freely use Scald; however, if the opponent has a Scald switch-in such as Silvally-Water or Altaria, Poliwrath should use Focus Blast or Ice Beam or double switch out to a teammate. It should also be noted that common Pokemon such as Mareanie, Swanna, and Bronzor counter Poliwrath, so Poliwrath should anticipate those switch-ins and double switch out to a teammate. Because Poliwrath only has access to passive recovery through Leftovers, it should refrain from taking chip damage as much as possible. Furthermore, if holding Leftovers, Poliwrath should avoid switching into moves like Knock Off and Switcheroo from Pokemon it can check such as Simipour, Kecleon, and Choice Specs Floatzel. Although Fightinium Z allows Poliwrath to more easily switch into these Pokemon, without Leftovers, Poliwrath is much easier to wear down and should play more aggressively as a result. In addition, Poliwrath should avoid being crippled by Toxic users such as Silvally-Fighting and Altaria, and it should be careful about using Protect against Pokemon that may try to set up such as Nasty Plot Raichu and Z-Mirror Move Swanna.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>In order to more easily secure KOs, Poliwrath appreciates Pokemon that can set entry hazards such as Golem, Mawile, and Crustle. Conversely, Pokemon that can remove entry hazards such as Swanna, Komala, Silvally-Dragon, and Silvally-Poison are key to keep Poliwrath healthy. In particular, Swanna, Komala, and Silvally-Poison are all unaffected by Toxic Spikes and can comfortably switch into Mareanie, which counters Poliwrath. Fire-types such as Combusken, Rapidash, and Simisear all appreciate Poliwrath's ability to check Water- and Ground- types such as Floatzel, Simipour, Golem, and Sandslash. In return, these previously mentioned Fire-types can check Grass-types such as Leafeon and Shiinotic. Poliwrath pairs well with Pokemon that can absorb or remove status effects such as Altaria, Granbull, Lickilicky, and Komala. Wallbreakers that appreciate Poliwrath's decent mixed bulk such as Torterra, Raichu, and Bouffalant all pair well with Poliwrath. Bouffalant pairs particularly well with Poliwrath thanks to its access to a Grass-type immunity in Sap Sipper.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Circle Throw phazes potential setup sweepers and switch-ins that may try and to take advantage of Poliwrath's passivity such as Muk and Simipour. Toxic allows Poliwrath to cripple Pokemon and pressure potential switch-ins such as Shiinotic, Gourgeist-XL, and Silvally-Water. Protect provides Poliwrath with the ability to Toxic stall opposing Pokemon while also getting free recovery from Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Speed EVs allow Poliwrath to outspeed Golem, and the rest of the EVs maximize its bulk. A Bold nature is used over a Relaxed or Impish one because having a Relaxed nature prevents Poliwrath from outspeeding Golem and Poliwrath prefers the damage output of Scald against Pokemon such as defensive Golem, Marowak, and Combusken.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set acts as a physical wall, and as such, Poliwrath should prioritize switching into physical attackers such as Floatzel, Golem, and Silvally-Fighting. However, Poliwrath should be wary of being worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery. This is vital because Poliwrath typically checks select threats for its team and should remain as healthy as possible to repeatedly check those threats. While Circle Throw can mainly stop setup sweepers like Z-Me First Pinsir and prevent Poliwrath's switch-ins from coming onto the field, it is also useful to wear down foes when entry hazards are up. Poliwrath should use Protect to rack up recovery from Leftovers as well as additional residual damage against Pokemon that are inflicted with Toxic. Additionally, if Poliwrath is up against a Pokemon that commonly runs a Choice item such as Electivire, Komala, or Beheeyem, it is often beneficial to scout using Protect. Because this set makes Poliwrath especially passive, it should be wary of foes such as Swanna, Leafeon, and Simisage that can use Poliwrath as setup fodder by forcing it out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Poliwrath appreciates the added pressure that entry hazards create, so Pokemon like Mawile, Bronzor, Golem, and Crustle tend to pair well with it. Mawile and Bronzor are worth mentioning due to their resistances to both Psychic- and Flying-type moves. Poliwrath pairs well with Pokemon that can remove entry hazards such as Silvally-Dragon, Komala, and Swanna. Status absorbers and clerics such as Lickilicky and Altaria help keep Poliwrath healthy by alleviating the pressure that status effects can put on it. Specially defensive tanks such as Muk, Kecleon, and Komala greatly appreciate Poliwrath's ability to check physical attackers such as Golem, Rapidash, and Floatzel. In return, they sponge special attacks for Poliwrath. Wallbreakers such as Bouffalant and Raichu all also appreciate how well Poliwrath can check physical attackers. Other Pokemon that can check Grass-, Electric-, and Flying-types such as Rapidash, Silvally-Dragon, and Rotom-S make for great partners as well.</p>"

  "Kadabra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kadabra is one of ZeroUsed's best revenge killers thanks largely to its high Special Attack and great Speed tier, while its access to Calm Mind also gives it the ability to become a frightening wallbreaker. It also has an amazing ability in Magic Guard that not only allow it to stop most defensive Pokemon, but also hold Focus Sash without worrying about it being broken by entry hazards and hold Life Orb without being worn down by the item's recoil. Focus Sash Kadabra can also utilize Counter to survive one hit and deal massive damage to physically offensive Pokemon. However, Kadabra's poor bulk and bad defensive typing are easily exploited by Pokemon such as Pinsir, Pawniard, and Silvally-Dark, especially if Kadabra does not hold a Focus Sash. While Kadabra's base 105 Speed is good, it is still outpaced and revenge killed by common Choice Scarf users such as Swanna and Pinsir, as well as priority move users such as Electivire and Metang. Focus Sash variants of Kadabra also have issues breaking through specially defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor and Lickilicky and Assault Vest users such as Kecleon and Komala. Life Orb Kadabra is also extremely vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped by the likes of Silvally-Dark.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fighting can be used on the Focus Sash set to OHKO Pawniard after it uses Sucker Punch. However, Counter also accomplishes this and is a better option in general. Encore can be used to hinder Pokemon that attempt to set up on Kadabra and defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky; however, Taunt is generally more useful. Substitute on the Life Orb set allows Kadabra to take hits safely, avoid status moves like Thunder Wave, and safely set up Calm Mind boosts. However, Substitute cuts into Kadabra's HP, shortening its already poor longevity, and takes up a moveslot that Kadabra cannot afford to give up. Thunder Wave can be used over Taunt on the Focus Sash set as a method to slow down faster Pokemon that Kadabra cannot OHKO like Floatzel, making them easier for another teammate to revenge kill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While Kadabra does have a good Speed tier, it is still susceptible to being revenge killed by faster threats such as Floatzel, Zebstrika, and Dugtrio. Choice Scarf users such as Electivire, Pinsir, and Swanna can also outpace Kadabra and revenge kill it. However, all of these Pokemon do need to be cautious if Kadabra still has its Focus Sash intact.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Life Orb Kadabra falls prey to priority moves such as Floatzel's Aqua Jet and Muk's Shadow Sneak. Sucker Punch is Life Orb Kadabra's biggest weakness, especially from users such as Kecleon and Pawniard. These Pokemon aren't as big of an issue if Kadabra is holding Focus Sash, though, as it can easily revenge kill them in return.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Focus Sash Kadabra cannot really hurt specially defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor, Lickilicky, and Assault Vest Kecleon. Lickilicky is immune to Taunt thanks to Oblivious and can proceed to pass Wishes to its teammates or potentially paralyze Kadabra with Body Slam. Assault Vest Bouffalant can also Pursuit trap Kadabra. However, Life Orb Kadabra can do hefty damage to them at +1.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon</strong>: If Kadabra is not holding a Focus Sash, Dark-type Pokemon can be an issue for it. Pawniard can reliably KO Kadabra with Sucker Punch, and Silvally-Dark can Pursuit trap it. Vullaby completely walls Kadabra if it is not running Dazzling Gleam.</p>",

      "Focus Sash Revenge Killer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dazzling Gleam hurts Dark-type Pokemon such as Silvally-Dark and Pawniard that attempt to switch into Kadabra. In conjunction with Magic Guard and Focus Sash, Counter is used to check Pokemon that think they can take down Kadabra by attacking it on its pitiful Defense stat, especially Pursuit trappers such as Choice Band Bouffalant, Pawniard, and Silvally-Dark. Taunt gives Kadabra an edge against defensive Pokemon by preventing them from laying entry hazards, recovering their health, or using status moves like Thunder Wave. Shadow Ball can be used instead of Taunt to nail Psychic-type Pokemon like Bronzor, Grumpig, and Mr. Mime.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash allows Kadabra to take at least one attack before it goes down, which aids it in its revenge killing role. This is especially vital against setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Bouffalant, Curse Muk, and Raichu. Magic Guard makes Kadabra immune to residual damage, allowing it to preserve its Focus Sash.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kadabra is primarily used as a revenge killer, so making sure its Focus Sash is intact when it needs to be is vital. This includes scenarios where Kadabra must revenge kill setup sweepers such as Muk, Bouffalant, and Combusken. Against physical sweepers such as Curse Muk and Swords Dance Bouffalant, Kadabra can easily go for Counter to deal significant damage to them. Kadabra can also be used to check frail special attackers such as Raichu and Simisear if it does not need to use Counter during the match. Avoid bringing Kadabra in on any direct attack, as not only are its defenses very poor, but doing so will also break Kadabra's Focus Sash. Counter is a great move to go for if a physical attack is anticipated and Kadabra's Focus Sash is intact, since it is almost guaranteed to KO the opposing Pokemon thanks to Kadabra's poor Defense. Kadabra can also use Counter against Pursuit trappers such as Pawniard and Bouffalant. Thanks to Magic Guard making it immune to Toxic, Kadabra can come in against passive foes such as Bronzor, Pyukumuku, and Mareanie and stop these Pokemon from recovering HP or using other status moves with Taunt. Keep in mind that moves like Psywave and Scald from these Pokemon can still break Kadabra's Focus Sash, however.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kadabra is primarily seen on more offensive teams because it can keep setup sweepers in check. Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Misdreavus appreciate Kadabra's ability to potentially lure in Pursuit trappers and KO them with Counter. Pairing Kadabra with Pokemon such as Silvally-Fighting, Rapidash, and Combusken is ideal because Kadabra cannot really dent Steel-type Pokemon. Kadabra, in return, can check Fighting- and Fire-type switch-ins such as Mareanie and Silvally-Poison for them. Pivots such as Electivire and Komala can bring Kadabra in safely, allowing it to keep its Focus Sash intact. Offensive entry hazard setters such as Golem, Probopass, and Pinsir make for ideal partners, as they ensure that Kadabra has an easier time revenge killing opposing Pokemon. In addition, these Pokemon have coverage moves that allow them to hurt the Steel-type Pokemon that Kadabra cannot touch. Probopass in particular can trap Steel-type Pokemon and easily dispatch of them with Earth Power.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Kadabra's Special Attack, allowing it to break through teams much more easily. Psychic is Kadabra's strongest STAB move and allows it to beat Pokemon like Pyukumuku, while Psyshock targets specially defensive Pokemon like Muk, Lickilicky, and Assault Vest users such as Kecleon and Komala. Shadow Ball hits Psychic-type Pokemon like Bronzor, Grumpig, and Mr. Mime. Signal Beam is the preferred coverage move because of its ability to hit Grass-types such as Leafeon as well as Dark-types, which gives Kadabra an easier time breaking down defensive cores. Dazzling Gleam is an alternative option that still hits Dark-types as well as Dragon-types like Altaria and Silvally-Dragon. Hidden Power Fighting can be used instead to OHKO Pawniard; however, this option leaves Kadabra countered by Vullaby.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Magic Guard and Life Orb give Kadabra a power boost without recoil. Magic Guard also allows Kadabra to bluff a Focus Sash set; this can come in handy against bulkier Pokemon, especially after Kadabra has boosted with Calm Mind. For example, +1 Shadow Ball can 2HKO Bronzor and OHKO Gourgeist-XL, while +1 Psychic can 2HKO Lickilicky after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Kadabra set can break walls easily but capitalizes on prediction. It is best to bring Kadabra in with the help of a slow pivoting move or with an aggressive double switch. Kadabra can come in on passive Pokemon such as Altaria, Bronzor, and Pyukumuku as well as weakened offensive Pokemon that it can outspeed and revenge kill, such as Pinsir and Silvally-Fighting. Once Kadabra is in play, it should try to dish out damage or attempt to boost its power with Calm Mind on a forced switch. While it is a risky play, Kadabra can try to bluff a Focus Sash set; to do this, bring Kadabra in on an enemy that would be afraid of Counter such as Bouffalant and Assault Vest Kecleon. The opponent might fall for the bluff and switch out their Pokemon. From there, Kadabra can attempt to boost with Calm Mind or go for an attack to net a surprise KO. Kadabra must not be brought in on any offensive move because of how frail it is.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Kadabra set is best used on offensive teams with partners that can reliably deal with setup sweepers. Choice Scarf users such as Electivire, Pinsir, and Swanna are good teammates, since they often outpace these Pokemon and can revenge kill them. Combusken can also help revenge kill setup sweepers by boosting its Speed with Speed Boost and taking them out with powerful Z-Moves. Because this Kadabra set doesn't run Focus Sash, teammates that can reliably threaten Dark-type Pokemon that run Sucker Punch or Pursuit such as Combusken, Silvally-Fighting, and Machoke are greatly appreciated. Partners that can deal with Steel-types such as Rapidash, Combusken, and Silvally-Fighting are needed. Offensive entry hazard setters such as Golem, Crustle, and Armaldo help Kadabra to take down foes. Probopass deserves a special mention because it can trap Steel-types with Magnet Pull and proceed to take them out. Slow pivots such as Komala and Probopass can bring Kadabra safely into battle. Pokemon such as special Combusken, Raichu, and Simipour appreciate Kadabra's ability to soften special walls if it is running Psyshock. Likewise, physical sweepers like Bulk Up Floatzel and Kecleon love Kadabra's ability to threaten physical walls if it is running Psychic.</p>"

  "Machoke": {
    "overview": "<p>Machoke has cemented itself in ZU as an exceptional tank thanks to its notable Eviolite-boosted bulk and access to a great STAB attack in No Guard-boosted Dynamic Punch to threaten potential switch-ins and cause confusion. Its mixed bulk allows it to easily check Pokemon such as Electivire, Poliwrath, and a multitude of Silvally formes, while its pure Fighting typing is somewhat unique in ZU and allows it to check certain Pokemon such as Floatzel, Electivire, and multiple Silvally formes that threaten other Fighting-types in the tier such as Monferno, Combusken, Hakamo-o, and Poliwrath. A physically defensive set handles common threats such as Electivire, Pinsir, and Bouffalant. Alternatively, a specially defensive Machoke can be used to combat ZU's special attackers such as Combusken, Silvally-Dragon, and Poliwrath. Unfortunately, Machoke's reliance on Eviolite to accomplish its role as a tank limits how effective Machoke can be as a Dark-type check due to Knock Off being the most common Dark-type move in the tier. Common Psychic- and Flying-types in the tier such as Beheeyem, Kadabra, and Swanna also heavily threaten Machoke. Machoke's lackluster Speed stat means that it can be taken advantage of when against common pivots such as Rotom-S, Mareanie, Zebstrika, and Choice Band Komala.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A more offensive set utilizing Close Combat and Guts and an EV spread of 212 HP / 252 Atk / 44 Spe can be used. Machoke can run a variety of coverage options over Knock Off such as Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, and Earthquake. A Choice Band set that takes advantage of Machoke's plethora of coverage moves is an option, but this is generally outclassed by Pokemon such as Komala, Golem, Bouffalant, and Rapidash. A set featuring Rest, Sleep Talk, and Guts can also be used alongside Close Combat and Toxic as a more offensive set. Toxic allows Machoke to cripple Gourgeist-XL, a would-be counter to this set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Dusclops, and Dusknoir are all immune to Machoke's most spammable move, Dynamic Punch. Gourgeist-XL is worth a special mention due to its ability to easily absorb a Knock Off and burn Machoke, forcing it to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Mr. Mime, Beheeyem, and Kadabra all threaten Machoke with their STAB moves. Beheeyem is worth noting thanks to it usually holding a Colbur Berry, allowing it to shrug off Machoke's Knock Off. Kadabra is another example of this, as it tends to run Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Swanna, Rotom-S, and Toucannon all threaten Machoke. Swanna, in particular, is worth mentioning thanks to its ability to run either a physically or specially based set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dynamic Punch is Machokes best STAB move, allowing it to heavily damage and confuse Pokemon, pressuring potential switch-ins such as Swanna. Knock Off provides Machoke with an excellent coverage option to threaten Pokemon that would otherwise wall it, such as Bronzor, Mareanie, and Dusclops. Rest provides Machoke with a source of recovery and allows Machoke to act as a status absorber. Sleep Talk allows Machoke to preserve its Dynamic Punch PP while also avoiding the passivity that comes after using Rest.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The maximum investment in HP and Defense alongside an Impish nature allows Machoke to maximize its effectiveness as a physical tank. Alternatively, Machoke can run a spread of 252 HP and 252 Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature. Machoke can also run 212 Defense and 44 Speed EVs in order to outspeed base 50 Speed Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Metang, and Regice. No Guard ensures that Machoke hits all of its Dynamic Punches.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Machoke performs best as a physical tank, so it should be brought in on physical attackers that it walls such as Electivire, Pinsir, and physical Silvally formes. Dynamic Punch should be spammed for easy chip damage unless you are able to predict a Ghost-type switch-in such as Gourgeist-XL, Dusclops, or Dusknoir. Eviolite adds to Machoke's notable bulk, so it should avoid being hit with Knock Off, especially from Dark-types that it can otherwise reliably check. Machoke should refrain from switching into strong wallbreakers that can 2HKO it such as Toucannon, Choice Band Bouffalant, and Marowak. However, Machoke acts as an excellent pivot against weaker attackers or Pokemon whose attacks it resists such as Electivire, Rapidash, Pawniard, and Sawsbuck. Because of its reliance on Rest for recovery, Machoke should refrain from taking damage as much as possible in order to avoid being passive. However, Rest does enable Machoke to absorb status for its teammates. Machoke should primarily be used defensively, but when against more defensive builds, it should focus on crippling Pokemon with confusion and Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Swanna and Simisage that appreciate Machoke's access to Knock Off and its exceptional bulk pair well it. Machoke appreciates Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off, so Silvally formes such as Silvally-Water and Silvally-Dragon tend to make for good partners, as well as Pokemon that carry Z-Moves like Combusken, Swanna, and Rapidash. Machoke is extremely weak to Psychic-types, so Pokemon that resist or are immune to Psychic such as Bronzor, Pawniard, and Silvally-Dark make good partners for it. Pawniard and Silvally-Dark are worth noting due to their access to STAB Pursuit. Flying-types such as Swanna, Rotom-S, and Toucannon are all common threats, so Pokemon that resist their attacks such as Mawile, Rotom-S, Probopass, and Bronzor all pair well with Machoke. Due to being heavily invested in only one of its Defense and Special Defense stats, Machoke appreciates Pokemon that can cover up its other, non-invested stat. Examples of these Pokemon may vary depending on the invested stat; specially defensive walls include Bronzor, Lickilicky, and Muk; physically defensive walls include Gourgeist-XL, Shiinotic, and Avalugg. Entry hazards can allow wallbreakers such as Combusken and Toucannon to break through Machoke, so Machoke appreciates Pokemon that can remove entry hazards such as Komala, Avalugg, and several Silvally formes like Silvally-Water, Silvally-Dragon, and Silvally-Ground.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>Golem is the premier Stealth Rock setter in the tier. Sturdy enables it to almost always set up Stealth Rock as well as check opposing Pokemon in an emergency. Sturdy also works well with its typing and Weakness Policy, granting it an easy boost and the ability to take down tougher foes. Golem's Normal-, Fire-, and Poison-type resistances and Electric-type immunity make it effective at checking Komala, Rapidash, Muk, and Choice-locked Electivire in a pinch. Its defensive set allows it to fill these roles even more effectively. Golem's powerful STAB attacks combined with its terrifying Attack stat allow it to OHKO Pokemon like Electivire unboosted and Pokemon like bulky Komala at +2. Choice Band allows Golem to pressure most of the defensive metagame with its almost unresisted STAB combination, including its most used answer, Bronzor. Unfortunately, Golem's weaknesses to Grass, Water, and Ice hinder it greatly, leaving it susceptible to special attackers such as Floatzel, Swanna, and Simisage. Furthermore, Golem's low Speed can be a large downfall, as faster Pokemon can easily nullify its Sturdy or clear entry hazards right after Golem sets them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Specially defensive sets can check Pokemon such as Chatot more effectively as well as switch in on Choice Scarf Zebstrika selecting Hidden Power Ice. Smack Down can make Golem a check to Bronzor without having to use Fire Punch. Sunny Day and Heat Rock can be used to provide an effective sun setter, alongside Stealth Rock to create role compression, and using this alongside Explosion provides maximum duration of sun. A Jolly nature can let offensive sets outspeed Pokemon like Mawile and Regice as well as Pokemon that try to creep Adamant Golem like Lapras and Kecleon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Levitate Users</strong>: Bronzor's immunity to Ground leaves Golem either attempting to hit with a not very effective Stone Edge or switch out, allowing Bronzor to use Toxic and Stealth Rock to chip and cripple Golem. This can be solved with Fire Punch, but a Golem Choice-locked into Earthquake or Stone Edge suffers. Misdreavus and Solrock can also burn Golem and can use Pain Split or Morning Sun for pseudo-reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Gourgeist-XL, Shiinotic, and Silvally-Grass terrify Golem. The first two also have access to reliable recovery, which means they can switch into Golem however many times they need, although all three should be wary of Golem's Toxic. However, while these Pokemon can easily put an end to Golem, they need to be wary of Choice Band Golem's Fire Punch</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Silvally-Water tanks a +2 Earthquake, can remove Golem's entry hazards, and can OHKO Golem after its Sturdy is broken. Floatzel and Swanna can OHKO using Scald or Liquidation after Sturdy has been broken, although they cannot safely switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Vibrava resists both of Golem's STAB attacks, has recovery, and takes little damage from Golem's coverage moves. Gabite can also check Golem, as it can tank hits from Golem and outspeeds it, meaning Golem can either get a single hit in or will only be able to set up Stealth Rock. Marowak cannot come into Golem, but it can beat it one-on-one, as Bonemerang bypasses Sturdy. Silvally-Ground and Sandslash can come in on Golem and remove its entry hazards with Defog or Rapid Spin, with the latter also being able to preserve its own hazards.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Silvally-Fighting can take Stone Edge from Golem easily, and while Monferno and Combusken are weak to Golem's Earthquake, both outspeed Golem, meaning they can come in to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Moves like Raichu's Focus Blast, Toucannon's Bullet Seed, and Chatot and Oricorio-F's Hidden Power Grass threaten Golem. With the exception of Toucannon, these checks have to be careful if Golem's Sturdy hasn't been broken, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Golem’s primary STAB move, hitting Steel-, Fire-, and Electric-types such as Mawile, Probopass, Camerupt, Rapidash, Zebstrika, and Electivire. Stone Edge completes a powerful STAB combination that allows Golem to hit both airborne and grounded Pokemon such as Chatot, Altaria, Electivire, Pinsir, and Rotom-S. Sucker Punch allows Golem to hit faster Pokemon like Silvally, Electivire, and Floatzel and punish them even better after Weakness Policy has been activated, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon like Chatot. Alternatively, Explosion can work well with Custap Berry, giving Golem an effective +1 priority 250-Base Power move after activating with Sturdy. Golem fainting also means opposing spinners and Defoggers cannot remove Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Weakness Policy is the main item used, allowing Golem to do greater damage to Pokemon that it had a harder time with beforehand. Sturdy allows Golem to avoid OHKOs from special attackers such as Floatzel and Swanna to set up Stealth Rock, which is its main goal, as well as activate Weakness Policy. An Adamant nature is more useful than Jolly, since there's not much Golem can outspeed outside of other Golem and Crustle. Custap Berry allows Golem to have an effective priority move after Sturdy activates, either allowing it to set up a last-ditch Stealth Rock or pull off an Explosion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golem should be used as a lead in most cases, with setting up Stealth Rock as its biggest priority. However, Golem should not come in as a lead if threats like Silvally-Water and Sandslash are able to anti-lead it or switch in. Golem shouldn’t be switched out unless it is crucial, as the possibility of breaking Sturdy is too great, which could cost Golem its usefulness. When up against a Grass- or Water-type such as Simisage or Floatzel, switch out to a Pokemon that resists their attacks like Altaria or Silvally-Dragon, although switching into an Ice Punch or Ice Beam from an opposing Water type can be hazardous. Golem can use its defensive typing to soft check Electric- and Normal-type Pokemon such as Zebstrika and Komala if Sturdy doesn't need to be kept or if Sturdy has already been broken. With its resistances and bulk, Golem can also play offensively. In these cases, being slow isn't Golem's concern, since it can tank most hits and dish back intense damage after a Weakness Policy boost. Keep in mind that Weakness Policy and Custap Berry rely on Sturdy, meaning you need to either preserve Sturdy or lead with Golem.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Dragon, Servine, Silvally-Grass, and Altaria can be helpful because of their unique ability to both act as a solid Defogger and cover Golem's 4x weaknesses to Grass and Water. Altaria also provides support by using Heal Bell to remove a burn or Toxic and provides an immunity to Ground and a resistance to Grass and Water. Unfortunately, while both Silvally-Dragon and Altaria can cover up Golem’s weakness to Grass and Water, all three have a weakness to Ice. Thus, Pokemon that can check Ice-types such as Monferno, Combusken, and Silvally-Fighting allow Golem to be safe by eliminating a possible threat, with the former two resisting Ice themselves. Spinners like Komala offer removal of opposing entry hazards without getting rid of your own. Silvally-Fighting can super effectively hit Pokemon that could remove Golem's Stealth Rock, including Komala and other Silvally formes. Golem's Stealth Rock can damage Flying-, Bug-, and Fire-types such as Swanna, Pinsir, and Rapidash, meaning Golem pairs well with Pokemon like Simisage, Combusken, and Silvally-Fighting.</p>"

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic allows Golem to chip down opposing Pokemon that it can't break, like Gourgeist-XL and Lickilicky, while Protect allows Golem to regain HP to recover its Sturdy after switching into entry hazards. Protect can also allow Golem to scout threats such as Choice Scarf Electivire and switch out accordingly. Earthquake is an effective STAB move that allows Golem to hit grounded Pokemon such as Mawile, Rapidash, and Raichu. Stone Edge allows Golem to hit airborne or Ground-resistant foes such as Chatot, Altaria, Pinsir, and Rotom-S.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers allows Golem to recover health over time alongside Protect, even allowing it to restore its Sturdy to be able to safely set up Stealth Rock. Sturdy is Golem's most useful ability, allowing it to avoid an OHKO from hits like Silvally-Water's Surf to set up Stealth Rock. Golem's investment in physical bulk and its Ground / Rock typing allow it to safely switch into Pokemon like Choice Scarf Electivire and Choice Band Komala, while its Attack EVs allow it to OHKO Pokemon such as Pawniard.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golem should be used as a lead in most cases, with setting up Stealth Rock as its main priority. It's not a problem if Sturdy is broken by entry hazards, since Golem's resistance to Rock allows it to recover its health lost using Leftovers in combination with Protect. Golem's main function is to power through opposing Pokemon's attacks and hit like a truck. Switching Golem out to a Pokemon that resists its weaknesses such as Silvally-Water, -Dragon or -Fighting allows it to set Stealth Rock again later, if it has been removed. Golem should avoid attempting to check certain variants of Pokemon that it could normally check, such as Bulk Up Komala, though it can check Choice Band sets.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Golem is best suited for balance teams. since its lack of reliable recovery make it a burden for full stall. Floatzel and Swanna both benefit from Golem's immunity to Electric, and Golem appreciates their Water and Steel resistances and Swanna's Ground immunity. Grass-types such as Leafeon and Shiinotic benefit from Golem's Normal resistance, as one of the most powerful Normal-type sweepers is Bouffalant, which packs Sap Sipper. Pokemon like Pyukumuku, Lickilicky, and Mareanie also benefit from Golem's Normal resistance, since Golem can come in on Choice Band Komala locked into Return, which is immune to status. Silvally formes such as Silvally-Water and Silvally-Poison can form a great entry hazard control core with Golem and check specific threats to it.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Golem’s primary STAB move, hitting Fire-, Steel-, and Electric-types super effectively with no risk of missing. Earthquake also hits Ground-types that resist Stone Edge. Stone Edge is also an effective STAB attack that allows Golem to hit both airborne and grounded Pokemon, such as Chatot, Altaria, Pinsir, and Rotom-S. It also hits Grass-type Pokemon that Earthquake wouldn't be able to hit for sufficient damage. Sucker Punch allows Golem to hit faster Pokemon like Silvally, Electivire, and Floatzel, and Fire Punch allows Golem to hit Bronzor along with bulky Grass-types like Shiinotic and Gourgeist-XL, which can bypass Earthquake with Levitate or typing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Using Choice Band means Golem can break through checks like Bronzor and Gourgeist-XL, which other sets cannot do. Sturdy is a vital ability, allowing Golem to avoid an OHKO and, in an emergency, check threats by exchanging hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Golem should be brought in after KOs or pivots as much as possible, as it's a wallbreaker able to check possible threats and keep momentum intact. Going up against a Grass- or Water-type can be solved by switching out to a check like Altaria or Silvally-Dragon, although switching into an Ice Punch or Ice Beam from an opposing Water type can be hazardous. In a pinch, Sturdy can be used to check faster Pokemon that Golem can KO, such as Electivire, Floatzel, Swanna, and Simisear. It is optimal to use the move with the best coverage against the opponent's team overall, since Golem will be Choice-locked after selecting a move. Golem can come in to check most Normal- and Electric-type Pokemon, although it should avoid taking too much chip damage beforehand. Use careful prediction, since the Choice lock means a Steel-type like Mawile could switch out to a Flying-type like Swanna expecting an Earthquake, meaning Golem would need to switch out. The opponent's moves need to be predicted in order to cause as few problems as possible. Be wary of locking Golem into Sucker Punch, as this means Golem either gives the opponent a turn or more to set up or a free turn to switch out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Dragon and Silvally-Grass can be helpful because of their ability to act as a solid Defogger, cover Golem's 4x weaknesses to Grass and Water, and bring in Golem with U-turn or Parting Shot. Altaria also provides support by being able to switch into Grass-type threats Silvally-Dragon and Altaria share a weakness to Ice with Golem, however. Komala offers a removal of opposing entry hazards that can break Golem's Sturdy as well as an immunity to crippling status moves and the ability to bring Golem in through U-turn. Bronzor patches up a lot of weaknesses Golem has and can provide Stealth Rock, which allows Choice Band Golem to put normally tough threats such as Gourgeist-XL into 2HKO range, as well as Toxic to chip down foes like Silvally-Water and Sandslash. Rotom-S can provide defensive coverage for Grass- and Fighting-types as well as momentum, although Ground-types check both Golem and Rotom-S. Silvally-Water can switch in on and check Floatzel and Swanna. Silvally-Poison can take care of entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes,absorbing them as it switches in and taking care of threats such as Fighting-types.</p>"

  "Golem-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Golem holds a unique position in the ZU metagame as a strong wallbreaker that can trap Steel-types such as Bronzor and Mawile thanks to its ability, Magnet Pull, paving the way for teammates like Exeggutor and Muk to sweep teams. Its solid Attack stat and access to coverage options in Fire Punch and Earthquake cement it as the most reliable Magnet Pull trapper in the tier, with its consistency at taking out Bronzor giving it a notable advantage over its main competition in Probopass. Alolan Golem is also able to perform sufficiently well even after Steel-types are no longer present, functioning as both a powerful wallbreaker and a slow pivot with the use of Volt Switch. However, Alolan Golem suffers from a poor Speed stat that leaves it susceptible to strong attackers such as Exeggutor, Torterra and Simipour. Alolan Golem also has a poor typing defensively, giving it weaknesses to a variety of common types, including a 4x weakness to Ground and a 2x weakness to Water and Grass. Finally, Alolan Golem suffers from some competition with Probopass, which offers additional utility as a Magnet Pull trapper thanks to its notably higher defensive stats, allowing it to better perform as a Stealth Rock setter and defensive pivot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wild Charge is a viable option over Volt Switch, trading the ability to pivot for a stronger secondary STAB option that is notable for OHKOing Mareanie. Alolan Golem can also use Galvanize to gain access to a strong Electric-type Return, Double-Edge, or Explosion. However, without Magnet Pull, this set is largely outclassed by regular Golem, which has a better typing both offensively and defensively and is less predictable as a result of its greater set versatility. Alolan Golem can also run a more utility-based Stealth Rock set alongside Air Balloon or Leftovers as the item of choice, but this set is outclassed by Probopass due to the latter's superior stats and defensive typing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Alolan Golem has a hard time breaking past Ground-types, as they resist Stone Edge and can block Volt Switch. While Golem and Torterra are averse to switching into Earthquake or Fire Punch directly, both deter Alolan Golem from using Stone Edge. Sandslash and Silvally-Ground outspeed Alolan Golem and can comfortably take any of its attacks at least once, making them solid switch-ins. Vibrava is especially notable for being able to tank any of Alolan Golem's attacks and freely heal off any damage with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Bulky Fighting-types like Machoke, Poliwrath, and Silvally-Fighting take negligible damage from Stone Edge and can take advantage of the gained momentum to cripple Alolan Golem's teammates with Knock Off, Scald, or Toxic. Combusken can't switch into Alolan Golem, but it can set up Swords Dance if Alolan Golem locks itself into Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While only Torterra can comfortably take Stone Edge, Leafeon and Torterra are both able to deter Alolan Golem from locking itself into Earthquake by threatening to set up with Swords Dance or Rock Polish and heal off any damage taken with Synthesis. Exeggutor and Simisage are also able to take advantage of Alolan Golem's low Speed and Grass-type weakness by threatening it out with STAB Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Alolan Golem's poor Speed leaves it vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Electivire, Komala, and Bouffalant that use super effective moves such as Earthquake. Alolan Golem's poor special bulk also leaves it easily forced out by strong special attackers such as Simipour and Swanna.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Punch is Alolan Golem's most effective move for taking out Bronzor and also serves to hit Torterra, which would otherwise wall this set. Earthquake is a more powerful coverage option that hits many Steel-types harder than Fire Punch does, including Mawile and Probopass. Earthquake also wards off physically defensive Pokemon such as Golem, which may aim to switch into a predicted Stone Edge or Volt Switch. Finally, Volt Switch allows Alolan Golem to pivot out of unfavorable matchups, catching the likes of Silvally-Fighting and Machoke as they switch in and bringing teammates in against faster targets without forcing them to take any unnecessary damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band gives Alolan Golem the power necessary to 2HKO defensive behemoths like Avalugg and Pyukumuku with Stone Edge. Magnet Pull is vital for Alolan Golem to perform its main role of removing Steel-types like Bronzor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Golem's primary role is to remove defensive Steel-types, so you should look for opportunities to bring it in safely. While Alolan Golem can sometimes be switched directly into status moves such as Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave, you can also make use of double switches or U-turn or Volt Switch users to bring in Alolan Golem. In addition to trapping Steel-types, Alolan Golem can also take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Altaria and Choice-locked Pokemon like Wild Charge Electivire and Double-Edge Silvally to find opportunities to fire off a powerful Stone Edge. In these situations, if the opponent has a physically bulky Pokemon such as Poliwrath or Machoke, Volt Switch can be used instead to maintain momentum and safely bring in teammates that can further threaten the opponent's team. When expecting a Ground-type to switch in, you should look to maintain momentum by performing a double switch or, if possible, catching said Ground-type with a super effective coverage move. Notable examples of this include using Fire Punch to hit Torterra and Earthquake to hit Golem. Be careful of locking into moves that can be taken advantage of by setup sweepers like Rock Polish Torterra and Swords Dance Combusken, however.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Golem works best when paired with Pokemon that appreciate defensive Steel-types being removed. For example, Psychic-types like Beheeyem and Grass-types such as Servine and Torterra greatly appreciate Alolan Golem's ability to remove Probopass and Bronzor, respectively. Alolan Golem can be paired with pivots like Rotom-S, Silvally-Fighting, and Silvally-Dragon to create a deadly VoltTurn core; Rotom-S is able to act as a check to Water- and Grass-types like Swanna, Poliwrath, and Torterra that force Alolan Golem out, while Silvally-Fighting checks Golem and can lure in defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor and Gourgeist-XL before punishing them with U-turn or Toxic. Finally, Silvally-Dragon is able to compensate for Alolan Golem's weakness to Grass-type attacks by checking Grass-type Pokemon like Servine and Leafeon. All of these Pokemon are able to clear entry hazards for Alolan Golem and greatly appreciate its ability to eliminate Steel-types such as Metang and Bronzor, allowing them to use Defog more reliably. In addition to Grass-types, Alolan Golem's defensive typing also leaves it vulnerable to Ground- and Water-types. Exeggutor and Mareanie are examples of Pokemon that can help offset these weaknesses, with Exeggutor reliably checking Ground-types like Sandslash and Torterra, and Mareanie handling fast Water-types like Floatzel and Simipour.</p>"

  "Rapidash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rapidash has a niche as one of the few purely physical Fire-types in ZU, and it is one of the best thanks to strong Fire- and Electric-type coverage in Flare Blitz and Wild Charge, high Speed, and access to instant recovery in Morning Sun, providing great offensive utility and making a great revenge killer against attackers like Exeggutor, Swanna, and Leafeon. When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Rapidash is able to revenge kill slower Choice Scarf users like Swanna and Electivire thanks to its superior Speed and coverage. However, its weakness to entry hazards, lackluster bulk, and reliance on recoil-heavy attacks all cause Rapidash to be worn down quickly, preventing it from revenge killing multiple foes in a game. Furthermore, physical walls like Golem and Altaria can shrug off most of Rapidash's attacks and capitalize on its vulnerability to residual damage by using Stealth Rock or Toxic while facing it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charcoal boosts Rapidash's main STAB attack Flare Blitz without the recoil of Life Orb, albeit at the cost of not boosting any of its coverage attacks. Toxic instead of Will-O-Wisp on the offensive set helps wear down its checks like Poliwrath and Golem but means Rapidash has a much harder time threatening physical attackers; priority users like Pawniard and offensive Mawile can especially be harder to deal with. Sunny Day can be used in conjunction with Firium Z to boost Rapidash's Speed and let it play the roles of both a revenge killer and sweeper, but it is only useful on sun teams and comes at the cost of its utility move in Will-O-Wisp. Groundium Z can be used to lure Mareanie and Golem and break Fire-types, but Firium Z is much better for a STAB nuke, and Rapidash still cannot break defensive Golem on its own. A set with Substitute + Toxic lets Rapidash ease Sucker Punch predictions and protect itself from Toxic. This set also allows Rapidash to cripple its normal checks like Pyukumuku and Golem, but this removes two valuable coverage moves. Hidden Power Ice can do heavy damage to Altaria and Gabite, which normally wall Rapidash, but Rapidash has too much trouble fitting this move over its more relevant coverage options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such Golem, Sandslash, and Altaria can take hits from Rapidash and cripple it with status or their super effective STAB attacks. The former two have to be careful of switching into a Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, though.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Physically defensive Water-types like Pyukumuku, Poliwrath, and Mareanie can stomach Rapidash's Wild Charge and either recover the HP lost or use a super effective STAB move against it. Offensive Water-types like Floatzel and Swanna cannot safely switch into Rapidash but are either naturally faster or can use priority in Aqua Jet to take Rapidash out once it is weakened from residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Electivire and Floatzel can outspeed Rapidash and can take care of it with their STAB moves. However, they must be wary of the Choice Scarf set.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Strong or super effective priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Kecleon and Aqua Jet from Swanna can take care of Rapidash with just a little prior damage, provided that Rapidash does not avoid Sucker Punch with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to a weakness to all entry hazards and the use of recoil moves, Rapidash tends to faint very fast if it does not get an opportunity to use Morning Sun.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wild Charge is an extremely important coverage move to hit Water-types like Swanna and Silvally-Water. High Horsepower allows Rapidash to hit Golem hard, as well as other Fire-types like Combusken and opposing Rapidash. Morning Sun allows Rapidash to offset the recoil it gets from Flare Blitz, Wild Charge, and Life Orb. Will-O-Wisp can be used over High Horsepower to punish physically attacking walls that switch into Rapidash like Granbull and Golem.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Firium Z gives Rapidash a one-time nuke with Flare Blitz, removing recoil but most importantly scoring guaranteed KOs on the likes of Komala and Kecleon. Life Orb, instead, gives a consistent damage boost to all of Rapidash's attacking moves at the cost of more residual damage. Flash Fire gives Rapidash opportunity to switch into Fire-type attacks for free while receiving a buff to its own STAB attack. Alternatively, Flame Body in conjunction with Firium Z provides an incentive for switching into weaker contact attacks like Knock Off for the burn chance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Rapidash set is best suited as a wallbreaker for offensive teams and can be a decent cleaner once its checks like Poliwrath and Golem are gone or significantly weakened. Utilize Flash Fire when applicable, as while Rapidash is frail, it can come in on a predicted Fire-type attack from Pokemon like Simisear and Monferno so it can boost its Flare Blitz. If Flame Body is chosen instead, try to switch in on weaker STAB moves from physical attackers like Pinsir, Leafeon, and Pawniard. Rapidash should avoid recklessly taking residual damage from entry hazards and recoil and should keep track of how much damage it is racking up on itself. Morning Sun can be used to restore the accumulated damage when forcing switches or on burned physical attackers. Be picky when using Rapidash's Z-Move, as it provides the power to dent Pokemon like Silvally-Fighting and Bouffalant while simultaneously forgoing the usual recoil from Flare Blitz.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rapidash is best selected for offensive teams and pairs well with other offensive Pokemon like Crustle and Marowak, which enjoy Rapidash's Fire-type coverage and struggle with Grass-types like Gourgeist-XL and Leafeon without it. Rapidash works especially well with entry hazard removal from Silvally-Water and Sandslash because it is very vulnerable to entry hazards on its own. In return, Rapidash also helps these two by targeting attackers that threaten them like Simisage and Swanna. Grass-types like Gourgeist-XL and Exeggutor make for good checks to Water- and Ground-types and can threaten some hazard users and physical walls like Sandslash, Mareanie, and Golem that Rapidash struggles with. Water-types like Swanna and Simipour handle Rock- and Ground-types for Rapidash. In turn, they appreciate how Rapidash wears down shared checks like Mareanie and Poliwrath, making them easier to KO with a Z-Move. Slow users of U-turn like defensive Silvally-Fighting and Komala are notable, as they can bring in Rapidash safely. On top of being slow pivots, Silvally-Fighting and Komala are also examples of Defog and Rapid Spin users to keep the field safe for Rapidash. On the other hand, entry hazard setters like Bronzor and Golem are helpful to let Rapidash get easy KOs on the opposing team.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wild Charge is great coverage that hits Swanna and Floatzel extremely hard. High Horsepower hits other Fire-types like opposing Rapidash and Simisear, as well as Rock-types like Golem. Toxic punishes checks like Pyukumuku and defensive Golem by wearing them down. Megahorn can be considered over Toxic, as it can revenge kill Psychic- and Grass-types like Kadabra and Exeggutor without the heavy recoil from Flare Blitz.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf cements Rapidash's role as a formidable revenge killer, enabling it to outspeed the majority of the metagame. Flash Fire is chosen over Flame Body, as without recovery, Rapidash would rather have the immunity to Fire-type attacks than being able to fish for burns.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>With Choice Scarf, Rapidash can serve as a fast attacker; it is especially effective against hyper offensive teams, as they often struggle with its Speed and coverage. Rapidash is a great revenge killer against the likes of Swanna and Sawsbuck. It can also be an effective cleaner when it can lock into Flare Blitz, as long as Pokemon that resist it like Silvally-Water and Combusken are weakened or already KOed. Bring in Rapidash safely on a free switch or with a slow pivot, especially when your side of the field lacks entry hazards, to effectively threaten the opponent. Once Rapidash is locked into a move, setup sweepers like Swords Dance Combusken and Z-Mirror Move Swanna can take advantage of it. In these cases, revenge kill with caution. Rapidash is much easier to wear down compared to sets running Morning Sun, so it should be wary of recoil and chip damage. If Rapidash is the team's main revenge killer, try not to jeopardize its health early on if the opponent still has their main setup sweeper left, like Z-Rain Dance Swanna or Rock Polish Torterra.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon like Komala and Silvally-Dragon work really well with Rapidash, as they help remove entry hazards that it is vulnerable to and, in the case of Silvally-Dragon, alleviate offensive pressure on it. Grass-types like Leafeon let Rapidash ease prediction and provide perfect synergy with it, as they deal with the Rock- and Water-types that Rapidash has a bad time with, and Rapidash can deal with opposing Grass- and Ice-types for them. Entry hazard setters like Crustle and Mareanie let Rapidash exert greater offensive pressure, making for easier wallbreaking. Water-types like Silvally-Water and Swanna help shield Rapidash from Water- and Ground-type attacks from Poliwrath and Sandslash. Silvally-Water can also remove entry hazards and let Rapidash come in safely with Parting Shot, weakening the foe's attacks and letting Rapidash force switches.</p>"

Muk's access to Curse makes it a threatening setup sweeper for unprepared teams, exploiting passive Pokemon such as Altaria and Lickilicky. Furthermore, a very helpful ability in Sticky Hold, allows Muk to keep its item against Trick, Switcheroo, and Knock Off users, helping it check threats such as Rotom-S and Choice Specs Floatzel more reliably without being forced out. However, Muk struggles to beat Steel-types like Bronzor and Mawile with its STAB move, and while it has the option of running coverage moves like Fire Punch to beat them, doing so makes Muk a lot more passive.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On the Curse set, Brick Break is an option over Sleep Talk, being able to 2HKO trapper Probopass, which otherwise beats Muk with Tectonic Rage, while Ice Punch can be run to hit Ground-types such as Gabite, Sandslash, and Silvally-Ground. Due to Muk's good physical movepool, a Choice Band set is an option to potentially lure and remove common checks while wallbreaking using Gunk Shot's raw power, but this set is very reliant on predictions. On such a set, Thunder Punch is an option to hit Mareanie while Shadow Sneak can be used to revenge kill Psychic-types such as Kadabra and Mr. Mime. An Assault Vest set is also an option that capitalizes on Muk's special bulk while being able to lure and remove certain checks such as Probopass, but this set struggles to get past defensive Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL, Altaria, and Lickilicky and is chipped rather easily due to its lack of recovery. Poison Touch can be used over Sticky Hold for the high poison chance alongside Black Sludge, but keeping Muk's item intact is usually better in the long run. Muk has access to trapping moves like Infestation and Block, so it can potentially run a set with Acid Spray and/or Toxic to lure and remove threats like Mareanie, Pyukumuku and Gourgeist-XL. It can also trap defensive Pokemon such as Altaria and set up on them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haze Mareanie</strong>: Haze Mareanie is the best Muk counter in the tier, removing Muk's Curse boosts and taking advantage of its passiveness towards it to set Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Spite Pyukumuku</strong>: Spite Pyukumuku can trap Muk with Block and PP stall it while ignoring its boosts due to Unaware. It also runs Rest so Muk can't afflict it with status or beat it during the process.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Mawile, Bronzor, and Probopass wall the mono-attacking set with Poison Jab, setting entry hazards or pivoting out to gain momentum. They need to watch out for Fire Punch, though. Trapper Probopass will beat Muk one-on-one regardless of Fire Punch if its Z-Move hasn't been used yet.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Golem, Sandslash, Silvally-Ground, and Gabite can all switch into Muk and proceed to beat it with their Ground-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types with access to a strong STAB move like Kadabra, Mr.Mime and Beheeyem can all revenge kill unboosted Muk. Beheeyem can switch into Muk and proceed to set up or OHKO it most of the time with Shattered Psyche. Kadabra can threaten Muk with Counter due to Focus Sash and Magic Guard. Neither Mr. Mime nor Kadabra can afford to switch in on Muk, though.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong physical wallbreakers like Electivire, Komala, Rampardos, and Pinsir can all beat even a boosted Muk with super effective coverage due to its average Defense stat.</p>",

Fire Punch can be run over Poison Jab so Muk can get past Steel-types like Bronzor and Probopass, but it makes Muk a lot more passive and weaker offensively, making it hard to get past Fire- and Water-types such as Rapidash and Swanna while also missing on Poison Jab's high poison chance, which can be useful to cripple non-immune checks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is used over Black Sludge due to Pyukumuku's Soak making Black Sludge damage Muk. Moreover, since Muk's ability Sticky Hold prevents its item from being removed, it's actually impossible to punish Trick and Switcheroo users.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is a reliable switch-in to several special attackers in the metagame, being able to threaten them with a Curse setup, so it should be brought in to sponge a hit from these. It also switches into passive Pokemon like Altaria with ease. Due to this set being easily walled, using Poison Jab to try to get the 30% poison chance or double switching to a trapper or a wallbreaker is usually a good move early-game, allowing you to remove or pressure your opponent's answers to Muk. With Rest and a Poison typing, this set is an excellent status absorber, being able to switch into moves like Altaria's Toxic and Gourgeist-XL's Will-O-Wisp. Due to Sticky Hold, Muk can potentially come in on Trick and Switcheroo users like Floatzel and Rotom-S and force them out. Therefore, Muk should attempt to set up once its checks are either removed or crippled with status, potentially sweeping the opposing team. If using Fire Punch, it's wise to conceal Muk's attacking move, so it can surprise the opponent and break down its check in order to sweep at the right opportunity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Good partners to Muk include trappers like Probopass, Alolan Golem, Silvally-Dark, and Pawniard, which can remove Steel- and Psychic-types that interfere with Muk's ability to sweep. Ground-immune as Altaria and Bronzor make good partners to Muk due to their ability to switch into Earthquake. Physically defensive Pokemon that don't share Muk's weaknesses like Gourgeist-XL, Beheeyem, and Gabite are also good teammates, being able to absorb super effective hits such as Golem's Earthquake that would otherwise heavily damage Muk due to its average Defense stat. On more balanced builds, wallbreakers like Komala and Pinsir make for good partners to this set, as they are able to remove Muk's common checks such as Bronzor and Mareanie, paving the way to a sweep.</p>"

It also has an excellent offensive movepool to back up its high Attack; its signature move Bonemerang is very useful for breaking through foes with Sturdy and Substitute, and it has good coverage options in Stone Edge, Knock Off, and Fire Punch. Marowak also gets Swords Dance to jack up its Attack to absurd levels. Defensively, Marowak has workable physical bulk as well as a nice typing in Ground that allows it to check attackers like Muk and Electivire. It also gets many opportunities to set Stealth Rock thanks to its ability to force out common Pokemon like Mareanie and Golem. However, Marowak is held back by its low Speed stat, and although it does give it a strong niche on Trick Room teams, it can otherwise limit its progress against offensive teams. It also has poor special bulk, which means that powerful special attackers like Exeggutor, Glaceon, and Simisear can break through it. Marowak's typing also leaves it weak to common Water-, Grass-, and Ice-type attacks from foes like Swanna, Torterra, and Silvally-Water. Marowak's reliance on Thick Club also means that it is crippled by Knock Off and Trick from the likes of Rotom-S and Komala, whereas its main competitors in Golem and Torterra are not as reliant on their items to function.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be used over Stealth Rock if your team already has a Stealth Rock user. This allows Marowak to fire off a free attack on whatever Pokemon comes in next, as well as become a more reliable stallbreaker. Swords Dance can be used outside of Trick Room, but Marowak tends to prefer attacking from the get-go, and it can be very hard to find opportunities to set up. Such a set also struggles to make meaningful progress against offensive teams. Stone Edge can be used on the Trick Room attacker set if you are worried about Pokemon such as Altaria. Earthquake can be used over Bonemerang if you are concerned about the latter's accuracy, but the benefits of Bonemerang are too good to pass up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Torterra, and Leafeon can take a hit from Marowak and retaliate with a STAB move, and the former can also cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Simisage and Cacturne are OHKOed by Fire Punch but are just as threatening if they get in safely.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Defensive Water-types such as Silvally-Water and Poliwrath can take a hit and threaten Marowak with their STAB moves. Offensive Water-types such as Swanna and Simipour also do the trick, although they can't switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special attackers such as Exeggutor, Simisear, Floatzel, and Chatot prey on Marowak's poor special bulk and can hit it very hard, although none of them can switch into Marowak's coverage moves safely.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Knock Off and Trick are both crippling to Marowak, as it relies on Thick Club for its excellent offensive presence. Thick Club-less Marowak is significantly easier to deal with, as it doesn't come close to OHKOing Pokemon that it otherwise deals with, such as Golem and Mareanie.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge provides good coverage alongside Bonemerang, hitting Flying-types such as Swanna, Altaria, and Rotom-S, all of which are prominent Defog users in ZU. Knock Off is usually the preferred third move for its utility, and it hits targets such as Bronzor super effectively. Alternatively, Fire Punch allows Marowak to nail bulky Grass-types such as Torterra, Leafeon, and Gourgeist-XL, notably dealing more damage to Gourgeist-XL compared to Knock Off, as it often runs Colbur Berry. Double-Edge can be used to bypass Stone Edge's accuracy when targeting foes immune or resistant to Bonemerang, but it otherwise doesn't hit anything particularly notable, and Marowak really needs its other moves to perform its role successfully.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thick Club is required to double Marowak's otherwise mediocre Attack stat. An Adamant nature is usually preferred for maximal damage output, but a Jolly nature is viable if you are uncomfortable with Marowak Speed tying with Adamant Golem, Crustle, and opposing Marowak. Battle Armor is the best ability on this set, as Marowak has no use for its other abilities with this moveset. Rock Head should be used if Marowak is running Double-Edge, however.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Marowak should look to set up Stealth Rock against opposing entry hazard setters, such as Mareanie and Mawile, as it forces them out with its powerful attacks. Leading with Marowak is often a decent option to get Stealth Rock up early and proceed to wallbreak quickly. Marowak's excellent matchup against Golem, one of ZU's most common leads, is also beneficial. Its ability to threaten common Pokemon such as Komala, Golem, and Mareanie allows it to excel as a wallbreaker against bulkier teams. Common Defog users such as Silvally-Water, Swanna, and Silvally-Dragon force Marowak out if they get in safely, so try to predict and hit them with the appropriate coverage move as they switch in. Great care must be taken when bringing Marowak in, as it is crippled by status moves and Knock Off. Bring Marowak in through Volt Switch or U-turn to circumvent this, or utilize double switching to get it in safely. Marowak can be played recklessly against offensive teams after it has set up Stealth Rock, as it will likely not get too many opportunities to put in work afterwards. On the other hand, Marowak should be played conservatively against defensive teams, as it is very threatening to them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Marowak fits best on balanced teams that need some wallbreaking power as well as Stealth Rock support and a soft check to Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Electivire and Golem. Offensive cleaners such as Combusken, Z-Rain Dance Swanna, and Rock Polish Torterra benefit from Marowak's wallbreaking and Stealth Rock support. The former two work especially well, as they threaten the bulky Grass-types that Marowak struggles with. Marowak can be tough to get into battle safely, and it therefore appreciates VoltTurn partners such as Electivire, Rotom-S, and Komala. Pokemon that can take advantage of Grass-types, such as Swanna, Simisear, and Rapidash, are all great partners, as Marowak greatly struggles with them. Pokemon that threaten Water-types, such as Electivire, Raichu, and Simisage, similarly make for good teammates. Bulkier Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL, Silvally-Water, and Silvally-Poison work well with Marowak, as its poor Speed means that many offensive Pokemon can threaten to revenge kill it.</p>"

      "Trick Room Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge has great coverage alongside Bonemerang, hitting Pokemon such as Swanna and Altaria. Knock Off rounds out Marowak's coverage, hitting the likes of Bronzor and Dusclops for significant damage. Swords Dance is the preferred last move, as Trick Room teams need to get as much out of their limited turns as they can. Fire Punch, on the other hand, provides a harder hit on Pokemon such as Torterra and Simisage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Brave Nature and 0 Speed IVs make Marowak as slow as possible so it goes first under Trick Room. Rock Head is the preferred ability so Marowak takes no recoil from using Double-Edge.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Marowak should look to wallbreak and sweep once Trick Room is up. When facing bulkier teams it can set up with Swords Dance against forced switches, while aggressive pivoting can get it in safely against offensive teams and give it opportunities to set up. Marowak should look to maximize the number of turns that it has under Trick Room. Attempting to get Marowak in after sacrificing one of your Trick Room setters is usually the best way to do this. Marowak should attempt to set up with Swords Dance on Pokemon that don't immediately threaten it, such as Electivire, or after a teammate has used Memento to get it in safely. Opponents may try to switch around Pokemon resistant or immune to Ground as a way to deal with Marowak; consider using Swords Dance again if this happens, as even resisted hits will break walls at that point. Marowak should do its best to conserve its health, as it can use its bulk to survive hits from the likes of Bouffalant, Furfrou, and Poliwrath and retaliate after Trick Room has run out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Standard Trick Room setters such as Carbink, Dusknoir, and Chimecho make for excellent teammates. All three have ways of getting Marowak in safely through Memento, Healing Wish, or, in Carbink's case, Explosion. The Memento Pokemon also can give Marowak an opportunity to set up Swords Dance safely, and Dusknoir can even use Z-Memento to heal Marowak. Other dedicated Trick Room wallbreakers like Wishiwashi, Toucannon, Rampardos, and Camerupt are good teammates, as they complement Marowak well and aid it in breaking down the opponent's team. Offensive Trick Room setters such as Beheeyem and Exeggutor can aid Marowak in its wallbreaking while also setting Trick Room for it.</p>"

  "Mr. Mime": {
    "overview": "<p>Mr. Mime sets itself apart from other Psychic-types such as Kadabra and Beheeyem thanks to its Fairy typing, solid Speed, and access to Focus Blast, which enable it to play around traditional Psychic-type answers such as Silvally-Dark, Pawniard, and Mawile. This is supported by Mr. Mime's ability to set up with Nasty Plot and Z-Encore, provide Healing Wish support and act as a revenge killer to threats such as Combusken and Silvally-Dragon with Choice Scarf, and wallbreak with Choice Specs. However, Mr. Mime's low bulk and base 90 Speed leave it vulnerable to faster Pokemon such as Leafeon, Rapidash, and Furfrou. Similarly, faster Choice Scarf users such as Electivire, Silvally, and Swanna give Mr. Mime significant competition as a revenge killer. Most notably, common bulky Pokemon such as Bronzor, Metang, and Assault Vest Kecleon handily check it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be used on the Nasty Plot set if a teammate takes up the Z-Crystal slot for more wallbreaking power at the cost of losing utility gained from Z-Moves and making Mr. Mime even more susceptible to residual damage. Psychium Z with Hypnosis is an option over Z-Encore that is comparatively less consistent but has the added benefit of putting foes to sleep and still getting a +1 Speed boost. Psychium Z also gives Mr. Mime the option to break through neutral targets with Shattered Psyche. Ghostium Z with Shadow Ball is a viable option over Fightinium Z + Focus Blast on the Nasty Plot set, as it allows Mr. Mime to break through Psychic-types such as Bronzor and Metang more easily; however, this leaves Mr. Mime much weaker to bulky Normal-types. Thunderbolt is a usable option in the fourth slot on the Choice Scarf set if your team is very weak to setup sweepers such as Z-Mirror Move Swanna and Nasty Plot Simipour.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Purugly, Rapidash, and Leafeon outspeed Mr. Mime and threaten to KO it. While Mr. Mime has Speed-boosting(AH) options in Z-Encore and Choice Scarf, it is threatened by faster Choice Scarf users such as Electivire, Silvally, and Swanna. Pursuit trappers such as Silvally-Dark, Pawniard, and Assault Vest Bouffalant can also revenge kill a weakened Mr. Mime if it locks itself into the wrong move.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Bronzor, Lickilicky, Assault Vest Kecleon, and Dusclops all pivot into Mr. Mime, but they can be crippled by Trick or broken through by Nasty Plot sets.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Due to Mr. Mime's poor physical bulk and tendency to be Choice locked, priority users such as Pawniard, Kecleon, Cacturne, and Bibarel are able to pick it off after it has been weakened.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Mr. Mime's lack of immediate power outside of Choice Specs leaves it unable to deter setup from Pokemon such as Crustle and Torterra. While Mr. Mime does have Encore and Trick, these moves fail against Z-Move setup sweepers such as Swanna, Pinsir, and Leafeon.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Encore helps Mr. Mime set up on slower Pokemon such as Mareanie, Dusclops, and defensive Rotom-S, and, when paired with Normalium Z, it allows Mr. Mime to outspeed faster threats such as Floatzel, Simisage, and Raichu. Conversely, Focus Blast makes Mr. Mime a better sweeper against bulkier teams, allowing it to break through Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Komala, and Metang after a Nasty Plot. Psyshock is an option over Psychic to hit special walls such as Muk and Lickilicky for greater damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Soundproof allows Mr. Mime to check Chatot reliably and pivot into Parting Shot from Silvally-Water and Silvally-Dragon. Z-Encore's Speed boost enables Mr. Mime to sweep through offensive teams, whereas Fightinium Z can boost Focus Blast to let Mr. Mime OHKO Lickilicky after a Nasty Plot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Save Mr. Mime for late-game when its checks like Bronzor and Kecleon are weakened or disposed of. Mr. Mime should set up against weaker foes such as Mareanie and Gourgeist-XL and on forced switches against Pokemon such as Monferno, Silvally-Poison, and Poliwrath. Mr. Mime can only get the Speed boost from Z-Encore one time, so make sure Choice Scarf users such as Electivire and Silvally are gone so they cannot revenge kill it. Against faster teams, Mr. Mime should focus on being an early-game wallbreaker, capitalizing on slower entry hazard setters like Sandslash and Shuckle. This is especially important when using Fightinium Z, as faster threats prevent Mr. Mime from sweeping. In these situations, try using it as a revenge killer against vulnerable wallbreakers like Chatot and Komala. Also, Mr. Mime is able to bluff a Choice Scarf, so use an attack and then set up Nasty Plot later on when the opponent may not expect it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nasty Plot Mr. Mime fits best on offensive teams that need a powerful sweeper and can take care of faster threats. Faster Pokemon such as Choice Band Furfrou and Rapidash and Choice Scarf users such as Electivire and Silvally pair well with Mr. Mime because of this. Pokemon that deal with Bronzor and bulky Normal-types, such as Silvally-Dark, Pawniard, Choice Band Golem, and Silvally-Fighting, make for great partners. Silvally-Dark and Pawniard are especially good partners, being able to take care of Bronzor, which walls Mr. Mime. In return, Mr. Mime is able to soft check Fighting-types. Entry hazard setters such as Marowak, Golem, Torterra, and Mareanie are essential support, helping whittle down Mr. Mime's checks to secure KOs against Curse Muk and defensive Rotom-S. Sticky Web setters such as Shuckle are also notable, as they help Mr. Mime play around faster threats such as Leafeon and Basculin and allow it to outspeed grounded Choice Scarf users such as Electivire and Silvally after Z-Encore. Conversely, entry hazard removers such as Silvally-Fighting, Swanna, Silvally-Dragon help keep Mr. Mime healthy, making it easier to set up. Mr. Mime has pitiful bulk and lacks opportunities to switch in, so pivots such as Silvally-Water, Rotom-S, and Komala are fantastic partners.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Blast provides great neutral coverage alongside Psychic and Dazzling Gleam, being able to nail Steel- and Normal-types such as Pawniard and Bouffalant. Healing Wish allows Mr. Mime to bring back a weakened teammate, while Trick is an option to cripple switch-ins such as Bronzor, Lickilicky, and Dusclops.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With a Choice Scarf, Mr. Mime is able to soft check threatening Pokemon such as Combusken, Silvally-Dragon, and Kadabra. Soundproof is used to check Chatot and to block Parting Shot from the various Silvally formes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Mr. Mime needs to remain healthy enough to revenge kill offensive threats and setup sweepers such as Silvally-Dark, Nasty Plot Simisear, and Shell Smash Crustle. However, Mr. Mime generally fails to OHKO setup Pokemon such as these and can be OHKOed back, so do not rely solely on it to revenge kill setup sweepers. Be mindful of what Mr. Mime locks itself into, as there are usually multiple Pokemon able to pivot into it and threaten it out like Rapidash and Pawniard. In addition, Mr. Mime falls short of the crowded base 95 and higher Speed tiers. This means that opposing Choice Scarf users such as Electivire, Silvally, Swanna, and Rapidash and even cleaners such as Z-Celebrate Leafeon, Z-Me First Pinsir, and +2 Speed Combusken are able to outspeedand threaten it. Mr. Mime must also watch out for priority users such as Basculin, Kecleon, and Pawniard, since it has pitiful physical bulk and is usually locked into an attacking move. Also, avoid using Trick if Mr. Mime is still required for revenge killing. Similarly, use Healing Wish to generate momentum when Mr. Mime no longer serves a purpose and a teammate such as Shell Smash Crustle can use the opportunity to set up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Mr. Mime fits best on offensive or balance teams that need a soft check to a variety of Pokemon such as Combusken, Silvally-Dragon, Mareanie, and Silvally-Dark. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Komala, Swords Dance Bouffalant, and Z-Mirror Move Swanna appreciate Mr. Mime's ability to check faster Pokemon and provide Healing Wish support. These Pokemon can also break apart teams and pave the way for a late-game cleanup for Mr. Mime. Mr. Mime also pairs well with bulky Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Rotom-S, and Torterra that are able to switch into threats such as Silvally-Dark, Pinsir, and Golem. Entry hazard setters such as Marowak, Sandslash, and Corsola help chip away at Mr. Mime's checks. In addition, Marowak and Sandslash provide Knock Off support, and Corsola switches into notable special attackers such as Swanna and Glaceon that threaten Mr. Mime. Dark- and Fighting-types such as Silvally-Dark, Pawniard, Combusken, and Monferno make for great partners, as they are able to threaten Bronzor, Mawile, Lickilicky, and Komala, which wall Mr. Mime, and greatly appreciate Healing Wish support.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Blast nails the bulky Steel- and Normal-types such as Mawile and Lickilicky that switch into Mr. Mime's STAB attacks. Trick allows Mr. Mime to cripple passive Pokemon such as Bronzor and Dusclops after it breaks down walls early-game. Alternatively, Shadow Ball provides a way to hit Psychic-types such as Bronzor, Metang, and Beheeyem that can pivot into Mr. Mime, while Psyshock helps Mr. Mime punch through specially bulky Pokemon such as Wish Komala, Assault Vest Kecleon, and Curse Muk. However, not having Trick makes Mr. Mime considerably more prediction reliant and easy to take advantage of.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs coupled with full Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature makes Mr. Mime a formidable special wallbreaker, giving it immediate breaking power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Mr. Mime in off pivots, through double switches, or after a teammate faints, as it lacks opportunities to switch in safely due to its low bulk. In a pinch, Mr. Mime can switch into passive Pokemon such as Mareanie and defensive Poliwrath and certain special attackers such as Rotom-S and Silvally-Dragon when healthy enough. Be mindful of Knock Off, status ailments, and double switches from the foe, though. When Mr. Mime is in, predict incoming switch-ins and hit them with the appropriate coverage move to make it easier to spam Psychic or Dazzling Gleam later on. Being locked into a move makes Mr. Mime exploitable, so be mindful of what it is locked into. For example, being locked into Psychic means Mr. Mime can be Pursuit trapped by Silvally-Dark and Pawniard. Because Mr. Mime is slower than many common threats, it should focus on attacking slower Pokemon and playing aggressively early-game. However, Mr. Mime needs to be careful of priority users such as Kecleon, Pawniard, Bibarel, and Cacturne, as it has poor physical bulk. Use Trick when Mr. Mime no longer needs to wallbreak or when it's necessary to break through a wall such as Bronzor. Try to avoid using Trick to cripple something too early, as it can make Mr. Mime easy to wall.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Mr. Mime needs pivots to bring out its full potential. As such, Pokemon such as Electivire, Silvally-Dark, Silvally-Fighting, and Choice Band Furfrou are fantastic partners. They also bait in physically defensive Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL, Machoke, and Golem that Mr. Mime takes advantage of. Because Mr. Mime is susceptible to revenge killers, faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Silvally, Floatzel, and Rapidash that can take care of Mr. Mime's checks are especially valuable. Similarly, cleaners such as Speed Boost Combusken, Z-Celebrate Leafeon, and Z-Rain Dance Swanna appreciate Mr. Mime's ability to break apart defensive cores and tear through physical walls. Consequently, Mr. Mime fits best on offensive or balance teams that need immediate wallbreaking power. Entry hazard setters such as Torterra, Marowak, and Golem help weaken Mr. Mime's checks, while entry hazard removers such as Silvally-Ground, Rotom-S, and Silvally-Water help keep Mr. Mime healthy and can also bring it in with a slow U-turn or Volt Switch.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>Pinsir is the best offensive Bug-type in the metagame, possessing a potent Attack stat, astounding coverage, access to Swords Dance, and strong offensive abilities, allowing it to function as a solid wallbreaker or setup sweeper that is difficult to wall. Multiple viable sets allow Pinsir to excel in multiple matchups; Mold Breaker allows Pinsir to bypass Pyukumuku's Unaware and Bronzor's Levitate, helping Pinsir to break down bulkier and slower teams, making it one of the most effective wallbreakers against stall, while Moxie gives Pinsir explosive late-game potential against offensive teams when its Speed is enhanced through either Z-Me First or Choice Scarf. Moxie boosts can easily snowball and make it difficult for opponents to sacrifice Pokemon. Solid physical bulk makes Pinsir difficult to revenge kill with faster physical attackers or strong priority users like Pawniard without it already being severely weakened. However, as powerful as Pinsir's advantages are, its Stealth Rock weakness and inability to set up on Pokemon like Golem, Combusken, and Marowak limit its ability to make better use of its Fighting and Ground resistances. Pinsir also is frequently checked by Flying- and Fire-types, as they are often faster and their presence forces Pinsir to predict with its coverage moves to prevent giving them opportunities to switch in. A middling Speed tier leaves Pinsir easily revenge killed by offensive threats such as Swanna, Oricorio-F, Chatot, and Silvally. Low special bulk makes it similarly susceptible to faster special attackers, as Pokemon like Floatzel and specially based Silvally formes with Flamethrower often threaten to KO it from near full. Despite Pinsir's great matchup versatility, each set's effectiveness ultimately depends on having the right matchup to get the most mileage out of them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lum Berry allows Pinsir to shrug off any status condition once, which makes for easier setup against defensive teams. Pinsir generally prefers Buginium Z for the sheer power, however, and its ability to force switches already makes the prospect of status less of an issue. Groundium Z can enable Pinsir to OHKO even physically defensive variants of Golem and Carbink even through Sturdy at +2 thanks to Mold Breaker. It also allows Pinsir to break through certain bulky Pokemon like Silvally-Fighting after a boost but is generally a niche option otherwise, since Pinsir values the sheer power to break through neutral targets such as Gourgeist-XL. Fightinium Z is another Z-Crystal that maintains the ability to break through Golem but differentiates itself for allowing Pinsir to better break past Avalugg through its Sturdy. However, this is generally not advised due to Pinsir being forced to forgo its Swords Dance set's superior coverage option in Earthquake A Focus Sash lead set is an option due to Pinsir's access to Stealth Rock and ability to fend off certain hazard deterrents with its Rock-type coverage. This still faces competition with lead options like Golem and Shuckle, however, as they have abilities that allow them to expand their item choice and provide better utility on average. Moxie with Swords Dance is an option that can take advantage of Pinsir's access to Quick Attack to sweep against weakened faster teams. However, this comes with the cost of a coverage slot, and Mold Breaker fares better against bulkier teams. Z-Me First + Swords Dance can be utilized to give Pinsir increased power while sweeping; however, Pinsir will be forced to give up one of its coverage moves. Substitute can be useful to ease prediction and protect Pinsir from status, but again it comes at the cost of coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Rotom-S, Swanna, Oricorio-F, Oricorio-E, and Chatot all resist Pinsir's STAB move and are immune to Earthquake, are often faster, and can naturally threaten Pinsir with their super effective STAB attacks or in Chatot's case, its powerful Boomburst that targets Pinsir's low special bulk. Choice Scarf variants of Rotom-S and Chatot are commonplace and can outspeed Pinsir's Choice Scarf set. They all must be careful about switching into Stone Edge, as even Rotom-S, the bulkiest switch-in, is OHKOed without bulk investment after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: While Fire-types cannot switch in reliably due to the risk of being hit by an Earthquake or Stone Edge, Rapidash, Simisear, and Silvally-Fire all naturally outspeed Pinsir and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Rapidash and Simisear can viably equip Choice Scarf, letting them outspeed even Choice Scarf Pinsir and impede its sweep. Combusken can safely go for a Protect to outspeed Swords Dance Pinsir at +1, does not fear Savage Spin-Out bypassing it, and easily threatens it afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pinsir's middling Speed and low Special Defense leave it vulnerable to being threatened by Pokemon like Zebstrika, specially based Floatzel, and various specially based Silvally formes with Flamethrower. It's worth noting that many examples of faster checks aren't as applicable against the Z-Me First variant, as they are all outsped at +2 even if they equip a Choice Scarf. Kadabra is a particularly notable example, as it's the only revenge killer that threatens all sets including Z-Me First due to its combination of Focus Sash and Counter.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: If Pinsir is running Choice Scarf or Z-Me First, it is often unable to deal significant damage to Pokemon like Pyukumuku, Altaria, Granbull, Sandslash, and Gabite. Gabite and Granbull can notably use Roar to negate its Speed boosts from Z-Me First. The Swords Dance set can usually break through these threats with little trouble, however.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Gourgeist-XL is one of the better defensive checks to Pinsir's sweeping sets, but it fails to reliably take on the Swords Dance set after Stealth Rock damage. Dusclops and Misdreavus often work as checks given that they are only hit neutrally by Pinsir's coverage attacks, only fearing Knock Off on the Choice Scarf set. Drifblim is also able to outspeed Swords Dance Pinsir after an Unburden boost and threaten it out with Acrobatics.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>X-Scissor in conjunction with Buginium Z is notable for breaking through Pyukumuku and Gourgeist-XL after minimal chip damage and a Swords Dance boost, which is important for optimizing Pinsir's matchup against stall's two most prominent physically defensive Pokemon. Earthquake hits Fire-, Steel-, Rock-, and Poison-types like Combusken, Carbink, Muk, and Probopass much harder than its STAB attacks. Stone Edge is Pinsir's main tool for hitting Flying-types such as Rotom-S, Oricorio-F, and Swanna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Buginium Z's purpose is twofold. On one hand, after a Swords Dance boost, Savage Spin-Out is a one-time nuke that helps Pinsir break through Gourgeist-XL and Pyukumuku as well as other bulky Pokemon such as Sandslash and physically defensive Golem after minor chip damage. It also allows Pinsir to reliably check Celebrate Leafeon lacking Double-Edge, as it tanks Knock Off and can easily KO Leafeon through its +1 Defense with the nuke. Life Orb is an alternative to boost its coverage options, allow it to increase its attacking power without setting up, and free up the team's Z-Crystal slot. Mold Breaker allows Pinsir to be an effective wallbreaker, bypassing abilities such as Bronzor's Levitate and Pyukumuku's Unaware.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is a wallbreaker, so it's best used to soften up defensive teams so that teammates can sweep past the remaining Pokemon. Pinsir can find setup opportunities against Grass- and Psychic-types threatened by it, passive Pokemon lacking options to cripple it (especially burns), and physical attackers locked into a weak coverage move. If bulky Ghost-types are present, avoid setting up unless they are removed or are able to be put in the range of Pinsir's +2 attacks. Avoid switching into Stealth Rock whenever possible, as it's important to keep Pinsir healthy enough to maintain setup opportunities. Given Pinsir's tendency to force in Pokemon that resist its attacks, it's important to assess when to make an aggressive prediction, as it's advantageous to catch faster Fire- and Flying-type checks with the appropriate coverage move to avoid losing momentum. Similarly, if you expect the opponent to send out bulky offensive checks that don't resist Bug like Silvally-Dragon on a predicted Swords Dance, it may be best to fire off Savage Spin-Out for the extra burst damage to bring them down after some prior chip damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support helps maximize Pinsir's damage output against physically defensive Pokemon and punish Flying- and Fire-type checks that switch in. Golem and Bronzor are high-profile partners; Golem checks Rotom-S, Zebstrika, and Electivire while blocking their Volt Switches. Sturdy also punishes interactions with Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon that attempt to break through it, as its STAB attacks often KO them in retaliation. Golem also draws in Grass-type Pokemon like Torterra and Leafeon for Pinsir to pressure. While Bronzor adds another Fire weakness, it can still defensively check various Flying-types and faster special attackers, offers a Rock resistance for checking Golem, and draws in certain Knock Off users like Komala and Leafeon that Pinsir can pivot into and threaten. Entry hazard control is also advised to mitigate Pinsir's Stealth Rock weakness. Silvally-Water is a great option due to its resistances to Fire and Water-type attacks, reliably checking faster specially based attackers like Combusken and Simipour that othewise pressure Pinsir. Bulky Komala can blanket check specially based revenge killers while either passing Wishes or pivoting with U-turn. Pinsir can take advantage of non-Rock Slide variants of Silvally-Fighting in return. Altaria can check various Fire-types decently well and function as a status absorber to take advantage of Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL if Pinsir is not in a position to break past them. Setup sweepers such as Muk and Bulk Up Komala appreciate Pinsir's ability to threaten the likes of Gourgeist-XL, Bronzor, and Pyukumuku. Other Flying-type checks apart from the aforementioned Stealth Rock users include Electivire and Rotom-S, both of which can also equip a Choice Scarf to check offensive threats and simultaneously offer pivoting options. Fire-type checks apart from Altaria and Silvally-Water can include Rapidash, Floatzel, and Mareanie. Pokemon that can punish bulky Ghost-types are appreciated, as Dusclops and Gourgeist-XL in particular can take boosted hits from this set, retaliate with burns, and recover from damage taken. The aforementioned Komala and Pawniard are good options, as they have Knock Off to remove Dusclops's Eviolite, drastically reducing its survivability.</p>"

      "Z-Me First": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Me First copies a slower foe's move at 1.5x power, but when used with Normalium Z it also turns the copied attack into a Z-Move while doubling Pinsir's Speed. This turns Pinsir into a formidable late-game cleaner, as it outspeeds every relevant Choice Scarf user in the tier after this boost. Earthquake and Stone Edge are Pinsir's best coverage options for sweeping, as they punish the majority of relevant Pokemon that resist Pinsir's STAB attacks such as Altaria, Probopass, Fire-types, and Poison-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Normalium Z allows Pinsir to double its Speed with Z-Me First. An Adamant nature is preferred to get the most power out of the set, as Jolly doesn't let Pinsir outspeed anything noteworthy at +2. Moxie's Attack boosts are important to the nature of this set, as it relies on snowballing to sweep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is meant to be used as a late-game sweeper, aiming to snowball and clean up teams once physically bulky checks like Gourgeist-XL, Golem, and Avalugg have been severely weakened or removed. Pinsir should be brought in specifically after KOs in order to use Z-Me First more easily, copy a Z-Move, and gain a Moxie boost. Setup opportunities are optimally found when trying to revenge kill slower physical attackers like Komala and offensive Granbull with Z-Me First. Otherwise, Pinsir can use its good physical bulk and typing to set up on forced switches from Grass- and Psychic-types threatened by it or on locked coverage moves that it can tank with ease while also beating the attacker one-on-one. Z-Me First's ability to copy the opposing Pokemon's move as a Z-Move can be used to create setup opportunities on Pokemon that stay in against the Swords Dance set, such as Silvally formes, especially if Pinsir's set has not been revealed. The Z-Move can be used to KO foes like Komala, Toucannon, and Marowak while granting Pinsir both a Speed boost and a Moxie boost. Try to prioritize keeping Stealth Rock off the field before sending Pinsir out, as it appreciates preserving as much health as possible to keep it out of range of priority attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers that excel at weakening bulkier teams to open up sweeping opportunities include Pokemon like Choice Band Komala, Choice Band Golem, mixed Electivire, and Raichu. Entry hazard removers are appreciated to keep Pinsir healthy, and it synergizes well with Pokemon like Silvally-Water and Altaria. Silvally-Water can offensively threaten various defensive Pokemon like Golem, Sandslash, and Gourgeist-XL with its coverage, while Altaria is a good Fire-type check and a solid counter to Gourgeist-XL. Hazard support to weaken checks is optimal, with Golem and Bronzor making solid partners for Stealth Rock support. Toxic Spikes is also one of the most potent ways of weakening Pinsir's checks to this set, with Mareanie having the best synergy due to its ability to pressure Defog users like Silvally-Fighting and set them up on a lot of defensive Pokemon that Pinsir struggles to break through. Pokemon that can switch into Focus Sash Kadabra are recommended, as it's one of the few Pokemon that can revenge kill Pinsir after setting up. Kecleon can beat it one-on-one thanks to Shadow Sneak making it immune to Counter, as well as its great natural special bulk allowing it to switch in on it. Pursuit trappers like Silvally-Dark and Pawniard are good at forcing damage also, with all three also helping pressure physically defensive Pokemon like Golem and Bronzor for Pinsir.</p>"

Close Combat's coverage is less optimal than Earthquake's, but it lets Pinsir consistently threaten Komala while retaining coverage on Pokemon like Golem and Probopass. It also deals the most damage to Silvally-Fighting. Stone Edge lets Choice Scarf Pinsir threaten faster Flying-types. Knock Off hits bulky Ghost-types like Dusclops, Gourgeist-XL, and Misdreavus harder than any of Pinsir's other attacks, as well as heavily threatening Bronzor. It is also a really solid option for pressuring switch-ins that are reliant on their item for bulk, like Golem, Sandslash, and Avalugg.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature offers the most to this set in terms of power, since Pinsir is already outsped by most Choice Scarf users anyway, but Jolly is situationally useful for revenge killing Jolly Crustle effectively after the Shell Smash Defense drop. Moxie combined with Choice Scarf maximizes Pinsir's ability to clean up late-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is a solid late-game cleaner but a situational revenge killer that mostly relies on super effective coverage to threaten attackers. When sent out early-game, Pinsir should often take advantage of forced switches to cripple checks with Knock Off, as removing Leftovers and Eviolite from checks is pivotal to keep them worn down. Choice Scarf Pinsir is effective at capitalizing on its relative unpredictability, so it can easily punish naturally faster Fire- and Flying-types for staying in. In general, all of Pinsir's non-STAB attacks rely on solid prediction to work, and catching the intended targets is key to opening up sweeping opportunities later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>It's important for this set to be paired with dedicated entry hazard removers that punish Pokemon that can switch into this set. This makes Pokemon like Swanna, Servine, and Silvally-Water effective Defog options, as they punish bulky Pokemon like Golem, Sandslash, Gourgeist-XL, Silvally-Fighting, and Granbull to varying degrees. Wallbreakers that threaten stall archetypes such as Komala, Raichu, and Floatzel are effective, as those types of teams are often roadblocks towards achieving KOs and facilitating a sweep with Moxie. Checks to Fire- and Flying-types such as Altaria, Rotom-S, Mareanie, Electivire, and Silvally-Dragon are solid, as they will frequently take advantage of Choice-locked moves to get free turns. Having Pokemon that are more effective at revenge killing as a backup way of keeping faster foes in check is a good idea, as Pinsir is often mediocre in that role. Other Choice Scarf users to fill this role can include Silvally, Electivire, and Rapidash: Silvally can remove fast threats with its powerful Double-Edge and Explosion, can use its filler slot to lure in Gourgeist-XL and Sandslash and take them out with Ice Beam or Toxic, and appreciates Pinsir crippling other Ghost-types with Knock Off. Electivire can check Flying-types and pivot around with Volt Switch, while Rapidash outspeeds all of the relevant faster Choice Scarf users that outpace Pinsir.</p>"

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Ditto uses its ability Imposter in tandem with Choice Scarf to be a check to multiple relevant setup sweepers such as Combusken, Swanna, Crustle, Pinsir, and Leafeon, which cannot set up in fear that Ditto will reverse sweep them. Ditto works great as a reliable revenge killer for bulkier teams, as many attackers carry super effective coverage against themselves. It finds opportunities to switch in due to the opposing Pokemon's immunities and resistances; for example, it can switch in on Volt Switch from Electivire, Flare Blitz from Flash Fire Rapidash, and Stone Edge from Golem while threatening them back thanks to stronger coverage in Earthquake and High Horsepower. Ditto can take advantage of more than just setup sweepers, and when transformed into the right Pokemon, it can also set Stealth Rock when copying Bronzor, remove entry hazards when copying Defog Silvally formes, and remove items with Knock Off when copying Mareanie. Regardless, Ditto fails to check setup sweepers that have different workarounds to the limitations of Imposter, Choice Scarf, and Ditto's low HP stat. Defensive sweepers like Curse Muk and Bulk Up Komala can outstall Ditto's moves' 5 PP, while offensive sweepers like Raichu and Bouffalant are immune to Imposter altogether if they are behind a Substitute. Ditto also fails to put in work against defensive cores including Pokemon like Bronzor, Altaria, Pyukumuku, and Lickilicky, which can easily outstall and recover on it. This makes Ditto unreliable and hard to fit on teams, as its use is completely dependent on what the opponent brings, and it can be played around due to the opponent knowing exactly what the Transformed Ditto is capable of.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An IV spread of 30 Def / 30 SpA / 2 Spe would be an optimized spread for Hidden Power Fire. This coverage hits potential Hidden Power users like Simisage and Servine for super effective damage, and it can also catch Steel-type Pokemon off guard that are expecting a Grass-type attack like Bronzor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Imposter fails when facing a Substitute, so setup sweepers that run Substitute like Bouffalant, Raichu, and Swoobat cannot be revenge killed by Ditto.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulk Up Komala, Curse Muk, Quiver Dance Bellosom, and Bulk Up Vigoroth all boost their defensive stats alongside their offensive ones, which coupled with recovery options means that Ditto cannot revenge kill these sweepers unless they are severely weakened.</p> <p><strong>Priority Sweepers</strong>: Ditto does not like being locked into priority when revenge killing, as Sucker Punch Kecleon, Pawniard, and Cacturne can potentially play around it. Ditto additionally fails to revenge kill Quick Attack Bibarel while it KOes it back, and weaker priority users like Aqua Jet Swanna can make Ditto victim to being revenge killed itself.</p> <p><strong>Walls</strong>: Given its low PP and lack of variability from being Choice-locked, most walls can easily outstall Ditto. Some walls like Gourgeist-XL, Dusclops, Mareanie, and Komala have to watch out for their own status moves and Knock Off being used against them, but they can still beat Ditto on their own.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Transform is Ditto's one and only move, and even then it sees almost no use due to Imposter usually triggering before Ditto can use it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf guarantees that Ditto will outspeed setup sweepers once Transformed or will at least Speed tie other with Choice Scarf users. The IVs enable Ditto to use Hidden Power Ground when against Hidden Power users like Raichu, Simisear, and special Combusken. The minimal Speed and maximum Defense investment is meant for the unlikely scenario where two Ditto are left to Struggle against each other, as this investment would minimize Struggle damage and recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ditto can be utilized early as a scout and revenge killer. Bring it in safely to force out a weakened Golem, Electivire, or Toucannon, which has the additional benefit of knowing for certain what coverage these attackers are running. Given that many attackers have immunities or resistances to their STAB attacks in the case of Electivire, Rapidash, Raichu, and Leafeon, Ditto may switch in on them on the correct prediction. However, with Ditto's low HP, wrong predication may ruin Ditto's chances of revenge killing later. Despite the Choice lock, Ditto may find itself using status moves like Stealth Rock, Defog, and Toxic in the appropriate situations, and it is not as afraid of being setup fodder, as it likely can switch out and reverse sweep. When up against bulkier playstyles, Ditto can still find use in being a switch-in to status spreaders like Altaria, Muk, and Bronzor. Ditto can also take advantage of these Pokemon and other recovery users to keep itself healthy by using their Roost and Rest, as well as copy Knock Off from users like Mareanie and Komala to remove their valuable Eviolite or Leftovers. Ditto may also want to switch into Knock Off in these cases if it would rather have more moves and PP with its Choice Scarf gone against bulkier builds. Setup sweepers can have coverage that deters Ditto, with examples like Roost Swanna, Protect Combusken, and Sucker Punch Pawniard all giving Ditto a hard time if it locks into the wrong attack or is too low on HP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ditto works best on balance and bulkier playstyles that appreciate its ability to provide a blanket check to setup sweepers that threaten their defensive cores. Bronzor, Altaria, Muk, and Mareanie enjoy that they can rely on Ditto to revenge kill setup sweepers like Crustle, Pinsir, and Z-Mirror Move Swanna. Water- and Flying-type Pokemon like Silvally-Water, Toucannon, and Swanna appreciate Ditto as a deterrent against Choice Scarf Electivire locking itself into Volt Switch. Ditto cannot revenge kill some wallbreakers like Marowak and Exeggutor reliably, so it can help to have additional offensive pressure from Leafeon, Silvally-Dark, and Rapidash. As Ditto struggles with defensive sweepers and Substitute users, phazers such as Mareanie, Poliwrath, and Avalugg can help check the setup sweepers Ditto fails to check on its own. Stallbreakers such as Simisear, Simisage, Bouflant, and Vigoroth are good support to have when a Ditto team faces stall. Knock Off support from the likes of Mareanie, Sandslash, and Komala can help with the stall matchup as well and can even remove the opposing Choice Scarf from Silvally and Rapidash so that Ditto is guaranteed to outspeed them.</p>"

  "Bellossom": {
    "overview": "<p>Bellossom thrives in the ZU metagame for its unique characteristics as a Quiver Dance sweeper; namely, it is a Grass-type that has a great support movepool, including Safeguard and Strength Sap, and solid bulk that allows it to be a reliable late-game sweeper. This is not to say Bellossom does not have its weaknesses; it suffers from crippling four-moveslot syndrome, often having to pick between utility and coverage. Furthermore, Bellossom is pressured by Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzor and Metang and specially defensive walls carrying Toxic such as Lickilicky and Komala if it does not have Safeguard, and it generally loses to most Pokemon that have a type advantage against it, such as Oricorio-F and Muk. Lastly, Bellossom loses to common wallbreakers such as Pinsir, Rapidash, and Bouffalant.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can be used in conjunction with Leftovers to prevent status and to threaten stall. However, Bellossom's Substitute breaks to most fixed damage, such as Seismic Toss from Lickilicky, and it has enough trouble dealing damage with Grass-type STAB moves, so it generally is not worth it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Forgoing Safeguard leaves Bellossom incredibly threatened by Toxic, since it limits Bellossom's tanking and sweeping potential, and common Toxic users such as Lickilicky and Komala can tank boosted Giga Drains, recover, and win against Bellossom. Bronzor hard walls Bellossom's main set, even at +6, and forces it to switch through Psywave and Toxic pressure. Curse Muk can PP stall Bellossom and fish for poison if it is carrying Poison Jab while sponging any hits, boosted or not, that Bellossom throws its way.</p> <p><strong>Sap Sipper Pokemon</strong>: A mono-attacking Bellossom set that only carries a Grass-type STAB move cannot touch Sap Sipper Sawsbuck and Zebstrika. If Bellossom is not running Moonblast, these matchups are an automatic loss. One should note Sap Sipper Bouffalant will generally beat Bellossom regardless of it carrying Moonblast or not.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Silvally-Poison can force a switch from Bellossom with Multi-Attack, which can 2HKO a Z-Strength Sap-boosted Bellossom while tanking Giga Drain and Moonblast at +6. As previously mentioned, Curse Muk is barely touched by a +6 Giga Drain or Moonblast and can threaten to 2HKO Bellossom with STAB Poison Jab. Additionally, Muk learns Sleep Talk, which can make Muk good sleep fodder for the enemy team, should Bellossom be packing Sleep Powder. While status is generally a problem for any Bellossom not running Safeguard, Toxic Spikes is specifically problematic, as it activates before Bellossom can use Safeguard or Substitute, stunting its sweeping potential.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Toucannon’s STAB Brave Bird devastates Bellossom, even through Strength Sap, making it a decent offensive Bellossom check. Calm Mind Oricorio-F can come in on Bellossom and impel it to switch, as it resists Bellossom's Giga Drain and will inevitably win in a Calm Mind war. Choice Specs Oricorio-F also does not fear Bellossom's typical attacking moves, resisting all of them, and can OHKO an unboosted Bellossom with a STAB Hurricane. Furthermore, the Oricorio-F's Dancer ability means that, as long as it is in the game, Bellossom cannot set up with Quiver Dance, or it might risk it switching in and copying the boost.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: As previously mentioned, Bellossom generally cannot win against Bronzor, as Bronzor can tank and PP stall Bellossom to its demise. Metang also puts heavy pressure on Bellossom, between Toxic and STAB Meteor Mash being a 3HKO. Additionally, Metang's Clear Body ability means it does not lose Attack whenever Bellossom uses Strength Sap on it.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Stallbreakers that have Taunt or can Encore Bellossom into a utility move can force Bellossom to switch out. For example, Vigoroth can use Taunt and Bulk Up on Bellossom, provided Bellossom is not at +3, as Giga Drain from Bellossom can 2HKO the typical Vigoroth set. Simisear pressures Bellossom, as it outspeeds Bellossom at +1, can OHKO it with Flare Blitz, and can tank its attacks until Bellossom has boosted three times. A Taunt + Nasty Plot set shuts Bellossom down especially hard, as it cannot recover or set up, while Simisear can use Nasty Plot and OHKO Bellossom with the same number of Special Defense boosts as Nasty Plot boosts with Fire Blast. Chatot and Mr. Mime can lock Bellossom into a utility move using Encore and force it to use its Z-Move or risk dangerous moves such as Chatter and Psyshock, respectively, putting Bellossom in a lose-lose scenario should it opt to stay in.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Rapidash can OHKO Bellossom with STAB Flare Blitz, outspeeds +1 Bellossom, and is able to take a couple of boosted Giga Drains and Moonblasts. Physical Monferno and Combusken both threaten to OHKO Bellossom with Flare Blitz, and special Monferno and Combusken 2HKO Bellossom with Fire Blast. However, both get 2HKOed by Bellossom's Moonblast after two Quiver Dances. Simisear is one of Bellossom's biggest checks, being able to outspeed Bellossom and OHKO it with Flare Blitz on a physical set and Fire Blast on a special set. It also can Taunt Bellossom, rendering all of its utility options useless. Flyinium Oricorio-F threatens to OHKO +1 Bellossom with a 185-Base Power Supersonic Skystrike. Bulky Oricorio-F can Taunt and Toxic stall Bellossom, provided it has not yet boosted. Finally, Choice Specs Oricorio-F can OHKO Bellossom with a STAB Hurricane while resisting Bellossom’s Giga Drain and Moonblast.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is the preferred STAB attack for Bellossom; it provides reliable damage and recovery, giving Bellossom staying power. Strength Sap allows Bellossom to pressure common physical attackers such as Electivire and provides unmatched recovery. Safeguard is used to beat out specially defensive walls Bellossom might otherwise have trouble with, such as Lickilicky and Komala with Toxic. It also gives your Pokemon an immunity to status for five turns, which is a nice perk for setup sweepers such as Shell Smash Crustle. Moonblast is an option to deal with Altaria, which Bellossom typically cannot beat without it, 2HKOing it after a Quiver Dance boost. Additionally, Moonblast allows Bellossom to bypass Sap Sipper on Pokemon such as Sawsbuck and Zebstrika to hit them for neutral damage. Sleep Powder is a way for Bellossom to cripple Pokemon that would otherwise give it trouble, such as Choice Scarf Rapidash and Silvally-Poison.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread is designed to take advantage of Bellossom's natural bulk and sweeping potential. After one Quiver Dance, Bellossom reaches 327 Speed, outspeeding positive-natured base 99 Speed Pokemon, including maximum Speed Swanna, maximum Speed Silvally formes, and maximum Speed Electivire. After two Quiver Dances, Bellossom outspeeds Pokemon such as Adamant +2 Huntail  and Zebstrika. Grassium Z allows Bellossom to muscle past potential threats one time with a 140-Base Power Bloom Doom. This is specifically useful for dealing with Swanna, as Bloom Doom has a 50% chance to OHKO Swanna after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, when boosted by Grassium Z, Strength Sap becomes Z-Strength Sap and boosts Defense by one stage. This can be particularly nifty in matchups against Pokemon such as mixed Electivire, and it complements Bellossom's Quiver Dance boosts.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bellossom is played as a tanky late-game sweeper that can come in on passive walls like Lickilicky or on resisted hits and set up. Naturally, this means Bellossom performs at its best when it has enough HP to tank as many hits as possible, so it is paramount to Bellossom's success to be as healthy as possible for as long as possible. Similarly, this makes Bellossom terrified of Toxic and Toxic Spikes, as it cannot continue to sponge hits and set up if it is on a timer. While Toxic can be dealt with by using Safeguard, it is essential to Bellossom's success that Toxic Spikes be removed before it comes in. Early- and mid-game, Bellossom should generally switch in on resisted hits from Pokemon such as Silvally-Water and threaten with super effective Giga Drains. Additionally, Sleep Powder sets can spread status early- and mid-game. While Strength Sap is primarily a recovery move, the Attack reduction it provides can give Bellossom opportunities to safely switch out to a strong wallbreaker or another setup sweeper, providing them support as well. Bellossom benefits from Z-Strength Sap greatly if looking to stay in longer and sweep, being able reduce moves such as Choice Band Komala's STAB Return to 3HKOs.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that can trap Bronzor are arguably Bellossom's best partners. Choice Band Alolan Golem traps Bronzor using Magnet Pull and reliably disposes of it using Fire Punch. It also resists all of Bellossom's weaknesses, bar Ice and Bug. Bellossom complements Alolan Golem by eliminating Ground-types that might otherwise trouble it. Silvally-Dark can also significantly pressure and weaken Bronzor with its STAB Dark-type coverage, 2HKOIng specially defensive Bronzor with Multi-Attack. Pursuit also 2HKOes and acts as a pseudo-trapping method against Bronzor, especially when it is weakened. Silvally-Dark is also vulnerable to status due to a lack of reliable recovery, which Bellossom's Safeguard can mitigate. Bulky Water-types can form a solid defensive core in tandem with Bellossom, as Bellossom resists Electric and Grass, which are common Water-type weaknesses. Mareanie is arguably the best Water-type to partner Bellossom with; not only is it one of the best Monferno and Combusken checks in ZU, it also absorbs Toxic Spikes for Bellossom. Other solid Water-types that Bellossom pairs well with are Silvally-Water and Corsola, which form great defensive cores with Bellossom. Silvally-Water can run Parting Shot to give Bellossom an opportunity to sweep while simultaneously checking Bellossom checks such as Monferno, Combusken, and Choice Scarf Swanna with its wide movepool. Corsola is one of the few defensive Water-types able to handle Oricorio-F and Chatot due its resistance to their STAB moves, being able to 2HKO both of them after Stealth Rock with Scald. Additionally, Corsola provides Stealth Rock for Bellossom and generally deals with chip damage well due to Regenerator and the option of Rocky Helmet threatening U-turn users. Bellossom is a great foil to sweepers and wallbreakers; Pokemon like Huntail and Combusken appreciate its utility. Strength Sap gives both Huntail and Combusken setup opportunities. Huntail can take advantage of Safeguard’s status immunity or Sleep Powder and setup on Pokemon that might poison it, such as Bronzor, which happens to be one of Bellossom’s best counters. At +2, Darkinium Z Huntail OHKOes a Bronzor with a 140-Base Power Black Hole Eclipse. Combusken is arguably the best sweeper and wallbreaker to pair with Bellossom; Life Orb Combusken deals with Bronzor and specially defensive Komala. Bellossom can help Combusken by eliminating pesky Water-types such as Silvally-Water and Politoed. Sleep Powder aids wallbreakers and sweepers such as Shell Smash Crustle and Combusken by incapacitating possible checks to them such as Rapidash.</p>"

  "Jumpluff": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its interesting typing, access to Strength Sap, and high Speed, Jumpluff can check Grass-types such as Torterra and Leafeon as well as other physical attackers such as Machoke and Sandslash. Jumpluff combines its ability to outspeed most Pokemon such as Swanna and Simisage with a wide range of utility moves such as Sleep Powder and U-turn. These features not only make Jumpluff a decent fast pivot as well as a solid revenge killer but also an excellent momentum generator that is able to bring dangerous wallbreakers such as Rampardos and Glaceon onto the field and give setup opportunities to powerful sweepers such as Combusken and Bibarel. Additionally, they allow Jumpluff to act as a dangerous cleaner with Swords Dance once opposing faster Pokemon, mainly Choice Scarf users, have been removed. However, Jumpluff struggles to find room on teams as a Grass-type due to its inability to check Electivire and Golem, two very common Pokemon that are usually checked by other Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Leafeon. Jumpluff's Attack also is so pathetic that it needs a substantial amount of chip damage on its checks to clean. Therefore, it is rather easy to defensively check Jumpluff throughout the game with Pokemon such as Bronzor and defensive Rotom-S. Moreover, despite its fantastic Speed, Jumpluff is still prone to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-S and Electivire. Furthermore, Jumpluff competes with other pivots such as Rotom-S and Silvally-Dragon, which trade Jumpluff's Speed and unique support tools for entry hazard control with Defog and better offensive capabilities, as well as with other revenge killers such as Assault Vest Kecleon and Choice Scarf Electivire, which do not pack reliable recovery or have such utility moves but are stronger and have a wider array of coverage options. Additionally, other slower or frailer setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Combusken and Nasty Plot Simipour are often chosen over Jumpluff due to their immediate firepower. Indeed, Jumpluff can't afford to run an item because Acrobatics is its best offensive move, whereas the aforementioned examples can increase their damage outputs with Z-Crystals and Life Orb. Jumpluff's weaknesses to many common types such as Ice, Rock, and Fire also make it highly exploitable by Pokemon that Jumpluff would otherwise check by virtue of its typing, because they often carry a coverage move of one of these types. All of these factors make it difficult to fit Jumpluff onto any team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thanks to its high Speed and ability to threaten Grass-types with Acrobatics, Jumpluff can run a rather effective Substitute + Leech Seed set. However, this set is extremely passive and therefore has difficulty breaking through Lickilicky and Muk. If used on a sun team, Jumpluff can run Sunny Day in order to act as a secondary sun setter. Jumpluff's notable perks are Chlorophyll allowing it to outspeed the whole unboosted metagame under sun and Memento enabling it to safely bring in a sun sweeper. However, Jumpluff isn't a very good mid-game sun setter, because it faces stiff competition for this slot from Pokemon such as Onix, Volbeat, and Exeggutor. Onix and Volbeat provide better utility with Stealth Rock and the combination of Prankster and a slow U-turn, respectively. Furthermore, sun doesn't benefit Jumpluff that much, unlike Exeggutor, since Jumpluff is already very fast without sun and is too weak to take advantage of Solar Beam. In addition, Jumpluff can run Chlorophyll on non-sun teams as a countermeasure to opposing sun teams, since Jumpluff outspeeds every Chlorophyll user and +1 Speed Combusken under sun and can OHKO them after very little damage with its STAB Acrobatics. Bullet Seed is an option over Seed Bomb on the Swords Dance set that can notably break through Golem's Sturdy and Kadabra's Focus Sash, as well as through Substitute if Jumpluff's ability is Chlorophyll. Also, this move gives Jumpluff a small chance to break through Pyukumuku. But in most cases, Seed Bomb is preferred due to its consistent Base Power and the fact that an unboosted Bullet Seed rarely OHKOes Golem. Jumpluff also has access to the coveted Aromatherapy. However, while this move can bring much utility to Jumpluff's team, it isn't as good as Jumpluff's other support options because it doesn't provide as much momentum or as many setup opportunities as Encore, Sleep Powder, or Memento.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Bronzor, Metang, and defensive Mawile can wall even a boosted Jumpluff. They can then take advantage of Jumpluff's inability to threaten them by setting up Stealth Rock or crippling it with Toxic, for example. Bronzor can be very problematic, since Jumpluff can't touch it outside of Sleep Powder and Bronzor's very low Attack stat prevents Jumpluff from recovering much health from Strength Sap. However, these Steel-types can get outstalled if they aren't running Toxic, as their offensive moves won't do enough damage to Jumpluff. While Pawniard isn't as bulky as the other Steel-types, it is also very problematic for Jumpluff, as it gets a boost in Attack if it gets hit by Strength Sap due to its ability Defiant.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Some Pokemon that Jumpluff would check by virtue of its typing such as Silvally-Fighting, Poliwrath, Kecleon, and Servine can carry Ice-type coverage such as Ice Beam, which OHKOes Jumpluff. Therefore, Jumpluff should always scout for Ice-type coverage while facing these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-S, Electivire, Rapidash, and Swanna outspeed Jumpluff and can OHKO it with one of their moves. Additionally, the former two resist Acrobatics and can easily switch into Jumpluff. Also, some Pokemon such as Floatzel and Dugtrio naturally outspeed Jumpluff and can OHKO it with their coverage moves in Ice Beam and Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Pokemon that are very bulky on the physical side such as Avalugg, Golem, and Probopass can easily take a boosted Acrobatics from Jumpluff and retaliate. However, Golem has to watch out for Seed Bomb, which can heavily damage it. Pyukumuku and Mareanie can wall Jumpluff thanks to Unaware and Haze, respectively, which allow them to negate Swords Dance boosts, but Jumpluff can break past the latter with Sleep Powder if it gets enough sleep turns.</p> <p><strong>Strength Sap</strong>: Thanks to Sap Sipper, Bouffalant and Zebstrika are able to consistently switch into Jumpluff, blocking its recovery from Strength Sap and its Sleep Powder. Thanks to the former's high bulk and the latter's Flying-type resistance, they can take Jumpluff's attacks relatively easily and retaliate with their powerful moves or, in the case of Bouffalant, set up with Swords Dance.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn generates momentum and allows Jumpluff to chip its checks such as Electivire and Golem. Strength Sap allows Jumpluff to stay healthy, allowing it to consistently check Pokemon such as defensive Torterra and Machoke throughout the whole game. Jumpluff can heavily weaken sleep absorbers such as Komala and Leafeon, which allows it to effectively threaten the opposing team with Sleep Powder. Encore is an option that allows Jumpluff to punish the use of status moves such as Golem's Stealth Rock and Bouffalant's Substitute, while Memento can be used to ease the setup of a teammate such as Swords Dance Combusken or Nasty Plot Raichu and should be used exclusively on hyper offense teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Jumpluff doesn't hold an item to boost the strength of Acrobatics; this also reduces the damage taken from Knock Off, making Jumpluff a better switch-in to the likes of Bulk Up Komala and Kecleon lacking Ice Beam. Moreover, Infiltrator allows Jumpluff to be a bigger threat to dual screens teams as well as threaten Pokemon behind a Substitute such as Exeggutor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Jumpluff is a fast pivot that can generate momentum thanks to U-turn and Memento and disrupt the opposing team with Encore or Sleep Powder. Thanks to its high Speed, it also acts as a decent revenge killer for threats such as Simisage and Swords Dance Silvally-Fighting. However, it does not have exceptional bulk, so it cannot come in on any attack. For this reason, Jumpluff should primarily try to come in through double switches or VoltTurn support; it can also switch into attacks that it resists or is immune to such as Leaf Storm from Simisage and Bonemerang from Marowak. In the latter case, prediction is highly required, since Jumpluff cannot switch safely into Hidden Power Ice or Gunk Shot from Simisage or Fire Punch or Stone Edge from Marowak. Jumpluff, not carrying an item, can also come into Knock Off from Pokemon such as Sandslash and Kecleon lacking Ice Beam. If there isn't a Pokemon on the opposing team that can block Jumpluff's Strength Sap recovery, such as a Sap Sipper user or Bronzor, Jumpluff should use the move when its health gets too low to check the opposing Pokemon after Stealth Rock damage. If there isn't a sleep absorber such as Sap Sipper Bouffalant, Vigoroth, or RestTalk Muk on the opposing team, Jumpluff should use Sleep Powder early-game in order to cripple a foe. However, even if there is, Jumpluff can predict the sleep absorber to come in and pivot with U-turn to a teammate. On the other hand, Jumpluff should avoid taking hits at all if there is a Pokemon on the opposing team that can punish its use of Strength Sap, since such a foe's presence severely hinders Jumpluff's staying power. In addition, Jumpluff should only use Acrobatics on Pokemon that are physically frail or weak to it such as Komala, Simisage, and Servine, since even with maximal investment in Attack, Jumpluff stays relatively weak. Encore should be used to lock your opponent's Pokemon into moves that you can take advantage of, such as Golem's Earthquake and Cacturne's Sucker Punch or Swords Dance. This forces the opposing Pokemon to switch out, giving Jumpluff a free U-turn or Strength Sap. Also, if Jumpluff has revealed Encore, the opponent may expect its use and switch out; therefore, it can be better to immediately pivot or heal. If Jumpluff doesn't check anything anymore or if one of its teammates has a clear path to a sweep, it can sacrifice itself through Memento to give free setup to a teammate such as Swords Dance Combusken or Dragon Dance Fraxure.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jumpluff fits well on bulky offense and balanced teams that need a fast Pokemon and a check to Grass-types such as Leafeon and Servine as well as specific threats such as Hakamo-o and Kecleon lacking Ice Beam. Moreover, it appreciates other VoltTurn users in order to make a great VoltTurn core, such as Komala and Electivire, which enjoy Jumpluff's ability to absorb Knock Off, as well as Silvally-Dragon, Silvally-Fighting, and Vibrava, which provide reliable entry hazard removal for Jumpluff. Slow or frail wallbreakers and sweepers such as Raticate and Rampardos also appreciate Jumpluff's ability to safely bring them in the field thanks to U-turn and Memento, as well as getting free switches into Pokemon that have been put to sleep by Sleep Powder or are under the effects of Encore. In addition, Water-types such as Mareanie and Silvally-Water appreciate Jumpluff's ability to take on Grass-types. Furthermore, Jumpluff enjoys their Fire- and Ice-type resistances, which give them the ability to take on threats such as Simisear and Floatzel. This is also the case for Rock-type Pokemon such as Golem, which appreciate Jumpluff's ability to deal with Grass- and Fighting-types and its Ground immunity. In exchange, they provide Jumpluff with Stealth Rock support and resistances to Fire, Flying, and, in Golem's case, Rock. Jumpluff also fits well on hyper offense teams for its ability to support specific sweepers, such as Swords Dance Bibarel and Nasty Plot Simisear, with Memento.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Strength Sap allows Jumpluff to stay healthy, allowing it to consistently check Pokemon such as Sandslash and Silvally-Fighting lacking Ice Beam throughout the whole game. It also gives Jumpluff more setup opportunities, such as against Kecleon lacking Ice Beam and Silvally-Dark. Putting a Pokemon to sleep with Sleep Powder can give Jumpluff the opportunity to set up as well as the ability to break through physical walls that could take it on otherwise, such as Haze Mareanie. Jumpluff can opt for Seed Bomb instead, which breaks through Rock-types such as Golem and Relicanth and hits Electric-types such as Electivire and Raichu harder than Acrobatics. However, without Sleep Powder, Jumpluff finds fewer setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>In order to boost Acrobatics' Base Power, Jumpluff isn't wielding an item. This also lowers the damage taken from Knock Off and therefore gives Jumpluff even more opportunities to switch in. Additionally, thanks to Infiltrator, Jumpluff can bypass Reflect and Light Screen, which could otherwise prevent its sweep, and threaten Pokemon hidden behind a Substitute such as Simipour.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The lack of U-turn makes this Jumpluff set act more as an attacker that focuses on weakening its checks to ensure its own sweep. If running Sleep Powder, Jumpluff should first cripple its checks such as Rotom-S and Mareanie with it early-game. Jumpluff should be cautious of how healthy its checks are and when to use Sleep Powder; it should use the move when it or one of its teammates has a clear path to a sweep. Sleep Powder can also be used to cripple one of a teammate's checks if Jumpluff has no chance to sweep. On the other hand, if carrying Seed Bomb over Sleep Powder, Jumpluff can break through usual checks such as Golem and Electivire lacking Choice Scarf and should therefore not focus on weakening them beforehand. However, it will lack more setup opportunities against slower threats such as Toucannon, Simisear, and Glaceon. Jumpluff should also stay healthy in order to be able to still check what it needs to as well as find more setup opportunities; therefore, it should use Strength Sap against Pokemon such as Kecleon lacking Ice Beam, Sandslash, and Silvally-Dark. It is also rather frail, so it should only come in on hits that it resists or is immune to, such as Leafeon's Leaf Blade and Sandslash's Earthquake. It can use these Pokemon as setup fodder and recover with Strength Sap if necessary. However, Jumpluff shouldn't try to set up until its checks such as Avalugg, Choice Scarf Electivire, and Floatzel have been completely removed, since most of them can easily take a boosted Acrobatics or Seed Bomb or are faster and can OHKO Jumpluff before it hits them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jumpluff gets quickly worn down by Stealth Rock, so entry hazard removers such as Sandslash and Swanna, which also resist some of Jumpluff's weaknesses, are appreciated to improve its longevity. Moreover, Defog Silvally-Dragon and Defog Silvally-Fighting make great teammates for Jumpluff thanks to their ability to bring it in through U-turn. Furthermore, they bring Jumpluff useful Fire- and Rock-type resistances. In addition, Ground-types such as Marowak, Silvally-Ground, and Golem that can beat opposing Rock-, Steel-, and Electric-types are highly appreciated by Jumpluff. In return, they appreciate its ability to take on Grass-types such as Simisage and Bellossom. Additionally, Fire-types such as Rapidash and Combusken can check Steel-types for Jumpluff as well as weaken Rock-types with their coverage or secondary STAB moves, such as Focus Blast and High Horsepower. They can also switch into Ice-type coverage moves for it, such as Kecleon or Silvally-Fighting's Ice Beam and Servine's Hidden Power Ice. Furthermore, strong attackers such as Beheeyem, Chatot, Rampardos, and Raticate can weaken physical walls such as Pyukumuku, Avalugg, and Golem for Jumpluff, clearing a path for it to sweep. Choice Scarf Electivire is also a potent partner due to its ability to remove faster threats for Jumpluff, such as Floatzel and Choice Scarf wielders such as Komala and Rotom-S, with its powerful STAB and coverage moves. It can also safely bring Jumpluff in thanks to Volt Switch. Additionally, Water-types such as Mareanie and Silvally-Water appreciates Jumpluff's ability to take on Grass-types such Leafeon and Sawsbuck and, in return, can switch into Ice- and Fire-type moves from Floatzel and Combusken for it.</p>"

  "Granbull": {
    "overview": "<p>Granbull's Fairy typing is unique in ZU and allows it to threaten common Pokemon like Silvally-Fighting and Silvally-Dark. Granbull excels as a wallbreaker due to its coverage options in Earthquake and Fire Punch, which allow it to hit Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Muk and Bronzor super effectively. Being a good wallbreaker is not Granbull's only strong quality; it is also a good support Pokemon due to its access to Heal Bell and status options. Its ability Intimidate is a boon for its bulk, which makes it a solid physically defensive Pokemon that can check Choice Scarf Pinsir and Silvally-Fighting. However, Granbull has low Special Defense, which is not beneficial against Pokemon that can run both special and physical sets, such as Swanna, Combusken, and Floatzel. Its low Speed makes it vulnerable against faster Pokemon, especially special attackers that can outspeed or revenge kill it, such as Swanna and Exeggutor. Granbull is also prone to chip damage and faces competition from other physical walls like Golem and Gourgeist-XL. A Lack of reliable recovery also hurts Granbull; it has to rely on Leftovers or Z-Heal Bell to keep itself healthy.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Granbull can run an offensive support set of Heal Bell / Play Rough / Earthquake / Thunder Wave with an EV spread of 216 HP / 252 Atk / 40 Spe. The Speed EVs let Granbull outspeed Lickilicky. However, this set has some important flaws; for example, Granbull doesn't have enough defensive investment, which means it can't check physical attackers, such as Rapidash, reliably. Offensively, Granbull additionally outputs far less damage and is easily walled by Bronzor. Another option is to use Toxic on the Choice Band set instead of Close Combat. Toxic effectively negates Leftovers recovery and lets Granbull 2HKO Z-Move Pyukumuku after Stealth Rock damage. However, sacrificing a powerful coverage move in Close Combat makes for a worse Avalugg matchup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: Strong special wallbreakers that are faster than Granbull threaten it heavily. Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Swanna, and Simisear fall into this category. However, these attackers can't directly switch into Granbull and risk being crippled by the defensive set.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although Earthquake hits Steel-types like Metang, hard Granbull still struggles against them. Bronzor is especially a struggle due to its ability Levitate.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Chip damage from entry hazards, status, and Leech Seed is a big problem for Granbull due to its lack of recovery. Granbull is affected by every type of entry hazard, and Choice Band Granbull is prone to being inflicted by burn and poison, since it can't cure itself with Heal Bell.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake hits Poison-, Steel-, and Fire-types that resist Play Rough super effectively, such as Muk, Metang, and Rapidash. Fire Punch is used to hit Bronzor, which resists Play Rough and is immune to Earthquake. Close Combat 2HKOes Avalugg after Stealth Rock damage and has a small chance to 2HKO it from full. Close Combat is also capable of OHKOing Lickilicky after Stealth Rock damage, as well as OHKOing Bouffalant and Silvally.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Band and an Adamant nature give Granbull a sky-high Attack stat, which makes wallbreaking much easier. Maximum Speed investment is needed to Speed tie with other base 45 Speed Pokemon, such as Marowak and Golem, and to outpace some slow defensive Pokemon, such as Lickilicky and defensive Komala. Intimidate lets Granbull tank hits from strong physical attackers like Komala and Golem and can act as an offensive check to them if kept healthy.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Granbull works best early-game as an excellent wallbreaker. It can come in on physical attackers that struggle to threaten it, such as Silvally-Fighting and Silvally-Dark. Granbull should be cautious of physical attackers like Kecleon and Machoke that carry Knock Off, however, because losing Choice Band lowers Granbull's damage output massively. With Granbull's great power and Intimidate, it forces a lot of switches from slow or passive Pokemon, such as Lickilicky and Altaria. In these situations, Granbull should use its coverage moves to punish incoming Pokemon that resist Play Rough, such as Earthquake and Fire Punch for Mareanie and Bronzor, respectively. However, be aware that setup sweepers, like Swanna and Combusken, can take advantage of Granbull being Choice-locked into these moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Granbull works best on balance and bulky offense teams. It appreciates Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Golem and Bronzor, which makes wallbreaking a lot easier. Golem has a good matchup against Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-types, like Mawile, Rapidash, and Muk, while Bronzor also has a good matchup against Poison-types and does well versus physical walls like Golem. Cleaners like Choice Scarf Swanna and Electivire benefit from Granbull's ability to weaken Pokemon such as Lickilicky and defensive Golem, and Granbull appreciates their ability to take care of faster Pokemon. Knock Off support from Pokemon such as Pawniard and Leafeon enhances Granbull's wallbreaking potential against Eviolite-holding walls like Bronzor and Metang, and it lets Granbull secure a 2HKO on Pyukumuku after Stealth Rock damage with Play Rough. Because of Granbull's low Special Defense, it tends to rely on teammates with great special bulk. Pokemon like Kecleon and Muk are excellent partners for Granbull, as they give its team a comfortable switch-in to special attackers like Swanna and Raichu. Granbull can switch into physical attackers such as Silvally-Fighting and Silvally-Ground for them in return. Entry hazard removal and pivoting moves also greatly support Granbull, which is why Silvally-Water and Silvally-Fighting are good partners.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is useful for Pokemon that resist Play Rough, such as Rapidash and Muk. For its status move, Granbull can use Toxic or Thunder Wave. Toxic helps Granbull wear down Pokemon that it aims to check and cripple opposing walls such as physically defensive Golem and Gourgeist-XL. Thunder Wave lowers the foe's Speed, crippling incoming switch-ins like Leafeon and Rapidash, which is great team support. Thanks to Heal Bell, Granbull can cure status for the team. However, Roar can be used over Heal Bell if phazing is useful for the team. It is a good option against setup Pokemon like Bouffalant or if Granbull is used on an entry hazard-stacking team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Normalium Z is used to give Granbull full restoration of its health with Z-Heal Bell once. Holding Normalium Z lets Granbull check Knock Off users like Kecleon and Leafeon more reliably. Leftovers is another option for recovery if Granbull's team already has a Z-Move user.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Granbull is excellent for sponging hits from physical attackers like Rapidash and Kecleon. It can also be used to cure status, which is very useful against a variety of Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and Altaria. Granbull should be careful against Pokemon that have both physical and special sets like Swanna and Combusken, as it can easily be KOed by special moves. Try to catch special attackers like Simisear on the switch and cripple them with Toxic or Thunder Wave. Granbull can work throughout the whole game, but it can be chipped easily, so it has to be careful about its recovery. Be smart about when to use Z-Heal Bell, as Granbull can only use it once and needs to avoid being chipped into KO range by Pokemon such as Rapidash.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Granbull works best on balance teams, it appreciates a teammate with good Special Defense. Pokemon like Altaria, Kecleon, Muk, and Lickilicky offer Granbull's team safe switch-ins to special attackers like Kadabra and Swanna. Komala and Licklicky are good partners, as they provide Granbull with recovery via Wish, and Granbull acts as a switch-in to Fighting-types like Silvally-Fighting. Offensive Pokemon like Pinsir are also recommended, as Granbull doesn't offer much offensive pressure; it can support them by switching into physical attackers, such as Silvally-Dark and Golem, and cure them of status afflictions like burn and paralysis. Offensive Pokemon like Exeggutor and Bouffalant also appreciate Granbull's Thunder Wave support because of their low Speed stats. Granbull also likes attackers such as Simisear wearing down its primary switch-ins like Bronzor. Granbull's capability to absorb Knock Off is helpful for Pokemon such as Mareanie, Beheeyem, and Bronzor. Mareanie and Bronzor are especially useful partners because they check special attackers like Swanna and Exeggutor in return. Pokemon that can cover Granbull's weaknesses make great partners for it. Ground-types like Golem, Sandslash, and Camerupt work excellently with it, as they offer Stealth Rock support and a free switch-in for Muk, and their STAB moves pressure Poison- and Steel-types.</p>"

  "Shuckle": {
    "overview": "<p>Shuckle is ZU's most reliable Sticky Web setter, nearly guaranteeing its setup due to the combination of Sturdy + Mental Herb. It also differentiates itself from other Sticky Web setters such as Smeargle, Leavanny, and Masquerain with its fantastic bulk and longevity, potentially allowing it to set up Sticky Web more than once per game, as well as access to Stealth Rock and Encore. Shuckle has several additional utility moves such as Infestation and Knock Off that can circumvent its passivity to some degree and provide extra team support. However, Shuckle's passivity is still its primary issue due to its pathetic attacking stats, allowing it to easily be overwhelmed and worn down by super effective attacks. Shuckle's passiveness also invites entry hazard removers, whereas Leavanny and Masquerain can actually scare off Pokemon such as Silvally-Water and Altaria, respectively, due to their offensive presence and higher Speed. Smeargle also has access to Spore, which can incapacitate the aforementioned Defog users without needing to predict like Shuckle does with Encore. Shuckle is also very one-dimensional, only really fitting on Sticky Web hyper offense teams. Lastly, Shuckle is reliant on passive damage such as Infestation and Toxic to hurt foes, which further invites Pokemon such as Altaria and Komala to come in and remove entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A physically defensive EV spread could be utilized over a specially defensive one to take advantage of Shuckle's notable resistances to Normal- and Poison-types such as Komala, Bouffalant, and Muk. However, Shuckle is better off utilizing a specially defensive spread, as Shuckle will still lose to Pokemon such as Swords Dance + Stone Edge Pinsir and Rampardos. Leftovers could be utilized over Mental Herb to give Shuckle access to passive recovery. However, Shuckle's susceptibility to Taunt and Encore wouldn't make it worthwhile, as setting Sticky Web should be its focus, not longevity necessarily. A Custap Berry alongside Final Gambit and the Gluttony ability allows Shuckle to consistently keep hazards on the field against Defog users like Silvally-Water, but leaves Shuckle vulnerable to Taunt and as a result is less consistent as an option. A set of Shell Smash, Rest, Infestation, and Toxic alongside Contrary allows Shuckle to more easily stall out foes, but it is extremely passive, is even more vulnerable to Taunt and Encore, and forgoes hazard setting options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Floatzel, Nasty Plot Simipour, Golem, and Rampardos can 2HKO Shuckle with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Taunt, Encore, and Substitute Users</strong>: Although Shuckle's Mental Herb can nullify Taunt and Encore once, users such as Vigoroth, Floatzel, and Volbeat can Taunt or Encore Shuckle again to prevent it from utilizing its other support moves. Additionally, Substitute users such as Regigigas and Bouffalant can shield themselves from status but must be wary of being locked into Substitute, as Encore can generate free turns for Shuckle to switch out and let an offensive teammate set up.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Silvally-Water, Silvally-Fighting, Altaria, and Komala can all easily switch into Shuckle and remove Sticky Web and, to a lesser extent, Stealth Rock. Furthermore, the former two don't mind Knock Off, as their specific Memories cannot be removed, while the latter two don't mind Toxic due to their abilities.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Shuckle is extremely prone to being worn down over time due to its lack of reliable and passive recovery options, susceptibility to Stealth Rock among other entry hazards, and common weaknesses such as Water and Rock.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Encore can lock Shuckle's foes into setup moves and weak attacks, generating free turns for Shuckle's teammates to switch in and take advantage of them or at the very least force switches. Infestation prevents the foe from switching, and nothing is immune to it, working well in tandem with Encore by guaranteeing free turns for Shuckle's teammates. Toxic is another option and nails Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Silvally-Water. This option in particular makes Shuckle susceptible to Taunt after its Mental Herb has been used up, however. Knock Off is a third option for Shuckle's last moveslot that prevents it from being Taunt bait and has the added benefit of removing items such as Electivire's Choice Scarf and Altaria's Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Calm nature should be utilized with Infestation or Toxic along with 0 Attack IVs. A Careful nature should be utilized with Knock Off along with 31 Attack IVs. Mental Herb nullifies the effects of Taunt and Encore from users such as Floatzel and Volbeat once, guaranteeing Sticky Web's setup. Sturdy is Shuckle's only worthwhile ability, allowing it to survive hits such as Sheer Force Rampardos's Rock Slide, ensuring Sticky Web will be set up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Sticky Web is the primary reason for running Shuckle, so setting it up should be its priority against most standard balance and offensive teams. In particular, in niche team matchups such as against Trick Room and stall, moves such as Encore and Knock Off should take precedence, as Sticky Web doesn't really come into effect in these matchups and Shuckle's utility moves have even greater importance through locking foes into ineffective moves or removing items. Despite Shuckle being a dedicated Sticky Web lead, its bulk typically allows it to set up entry hazards again later in the game. If Shuckle is at low health, where it cannot be preserved, letting it faint allows an offensive teammate to switch in freely without fear of taking a massive hit. Early- to mid-game after Sticky Web has been set, Shuckle can act as a Normal-type answer and blanket check for special attackers so that its frail teammates don't have to take unnecessary hits. If a Defog user switches in and you predict them to try removing Shuckle's Sticky Web and Stealth Rock, switch Shuckle out to a Defiant or Competitive user such as Pawniard, Purugly, or Meowstic-F. Similarly, if a Rapid Spin user such as Komala comes into remove entry hazards, switch directly to your Ghost-type.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Wallbreakers such as Simipour, Raticate, Rampardos, and Pinsir are mandatory to utilize alongside Shuckle, as they can outspeed most unboosted foes and punch holes in the opposing team. Notably, they are able to outspeed foes such as Choice Scarf Electivire and Floatzel they weren't able to outspeed before. Defog deterrents such as Pawniard and Purugly can help keep Sticky Web on the field. Pokemon such as Silvally-Fighting and Electivire can check and apply offensive pressure to common entry hazard removers such as Komala, Altaria, and Silvally-Water to help keep entry hazards on the field. Offensive Flying-types and Levitate users such as Swanna, Ninjask, and Misdreavus are not affected by Sticky Web and therefore are harder to revenge kill. Checks to some of these Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Electivire for Swanna and Ninjask and Swords Dance Silvally-Dark for Misdreavus make great teammates.</p>"

  "Combusken": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to a good offensive typing and an amazing ability in Speed Boost, Combusken is an excellent wallbreaker and sweeper in ZU. It is easily capable of snowballing, with it only taking two turns to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and three to outspeed every Choice Scarf user as well. With good mixed attacking stats, Combusken can go special or physical, making it at least somewhat unpredictable. Thanks to its typing, Combusken is capable of beating traditional Fighting-type checks like Gourgeist-XL and Mr. Mime as well as Fire-type checks like Golem and Silvally-Water. However, Combusken is very frail, leaving it easily revenge killed by priority, especially by Aqua Jet from Swanna and Floatzel. In addition, its low base 55 Speed means that is it is very reliant on Protect and Speed Boost to outspeed a lot of Pokemon, for example leaving it outsped by Floatzel at +1 and Choice Scarf Electivire and Swanna at +2. Protect leaves it quite strapped for moveslots, which is an issue compounded by its poor movepool leaving it without a good physical Fighting-type move and reliant on Hidden Power and Z-Moves. Because of this, it very rarely has room to run Eviolite, exacerbating its already poor bulk.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Low Kick can be used over Sky Uppercut on the Swords Dance set to have a perfectly accurate STAB move that does increased damage to Golem and Silvally formes, but it fails to deal significant damage to the notable Komala and Floatzel, which means Sky Uppercut is usually preferred. Thunder Punch is another option on the Swords Dance set to more easily beat Silvally-Water and other Water-types, but Combusken does not have any moveslots to spare. Substitute can be used over Protect on either of the sets to keep Combusken safe, but it is less reliable at allowing it to obtain Speed boosts and wears it down even faster. Combusken can function as an offensive Defogger, but it generally lacks the moveslots to do so effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Silvally-Water, Mareanie, and Pyukumuku are not easily broken by Combusken and can threaten it back with their super effective STAB moves or Toxic, while Swanna and Floatzel can easily take out Combusken with Aqua Jet if they decide to run it. In addition, Swanna can avoid an OHKO from any of Combusken's moves bar +2 Inferno Overdrive, allowing it to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: While Combusken can break through Altaria, it needs to hit it on the switch with Hidden Power Ice on the special set lest it get stalled out by Roost, or it needs to hit its Z-Move correctly on the physical set. Other Flying-types like Swanna and Rotom-S are capable of taking most of Combusken's hits before OHKOing it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Electivire, Pinsir, and Mr. Mime can outspeed even +2 Combusken and easily OHKO it. However, if Combusken obtains enough Speed boosts, and in the case of a full health Electivire, a Swords Dance boost, it will KO them instead. Meanwhile, Pokemon like Floatzel and Dugtrio can outspeed and OHKO +1 Combusken, and both can run Substitute to catch Combusken on a predicted Protect.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon like Grumpig and physically defensive Beheeyem can take on one or both of Combusken's sets, especially after its Z-Move has been used, while Focus Sash Kadabra can revenge kill any set if it is at full health.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hidden Power Ice is Combusken's best move against Altaria, 2HKOing the common physically defensive variants and doing the same to specially defensive sets after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Electric is another option to target Water-types, especially those that also resist Focus Blast like Swanna and Mareanie; however, the former takes a lot of damage from All-Out Pummeling and is 2HKOed by Life Orb-boosted Fire Blast after Stealth Rock, meaning it only usefully targets the latter. In general, targeting Altaria is more valuable. Protect synergizes very well with Speed Boost, guaranteeing Combusken gets at least one boost, often allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Silvally formes and Swanna.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fightinium Z is usually the preferred item, as it allows Combusken to break Pokemon like Silvally-Water with some chip damage as well as OHKO Pokemon like specially defensive Komala, Assault Vest Bouffalant, and Lickilicky, though it needs Stealth Rock damage for the latter two. It's also guaranteed to hit, which can be very useful in situations where risking Focus Blast's 70% accuracy is not desirable. Life Orb is an alternative if your team already has a Z-Move user. Notably, it allows Hidden Power Ice to 2HKO specially defensive Altaria without Stealth Rock damage and sometimes OHKO physically defensive variants after Stealth Rock while also granting a general damage boost to Combusken's STAB moves. However, Combusken is worn down very quickly by the item, and it has to rely on Focus Blast's shaky accuracy to break Fire-resistant Silvally formes, which is often not preferable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Combusken should focus on breaking holes in the opponent's team by utilizing its solid coverage. If running Fightinium Z, it's important to consider carefully what foe to use it on. This will most commonly be a Pokemon like specially defensive Lickilicky or Silvally-Water, which can take either STAB move but loses to All-Out Pummeling. KOing such a Pokemon will often allow either Combusken or one of its teammates to sweep. In general, Combusken should be brought in via a safe switch, such as by a slow Volt Switch or U-turn from Pokemon like Alolan Golem and Komala, as its frailty means it rarely wants to take a hit. The major exception to this rule is Gourgeist-XL, which is almost entirely unable to dent Combusken; the worst it can do is use Leech Seed, so Combusken can generally switch into it for free to generate momentum. Be liberal with predictions. It is important to keep up momentum when Combusken is on the field, as getting into a disadvantageous matchup is very crippiling. Therefore, considering carefully whether your opponent will switch in a Pokemon like Silvally-Water and 2HKOing it on the switch is crucial. Protect has several uses. Of course, most important is the ability to guarantee a Speed boost against Pokemon like Komala, but it can also be used to scout against Choice Scarf users like Electivire. When using it, always carefully consider how many boosts you will need, as it is often more worth it to use an attack in order to wallbreak before using Protect the next turn, after your opponent switches to a faster threat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Combusken pairs well with physical wallbreakers and sweepers like Swords Dance Silvally formes and Bulk Up or Choice Band Komala, as they can take care of special walls like Bronzor and Muk, allowing Combusken to wallbreak more easily. In exchange, Combusken threatens physical walls like Golem and Gourgeist-XL. Silvally formes and Choice Band Komala can also bring in Combusken with U-turn. Other Pokemon that can do so, such as Electivire and other Silvally formes, work well with Combusken too. Since Combusken relies on Stealth Rock to grab certain 2HKOs and OHKOs, most notably on Altaria, setters like Golem and Bronzor pair well with it. Combusken deals well with Gourgeist-XL, so Pokemon like the aforementioned Komala and Golem greatly appreciate its presence. Due to Combusken's weakness to Water-types, Pokemon that deal with them like Silvally-Water and Gourgeist-XL are solid teammates. Pokemon that reliably beat Altaria, like Komala and Electivire, are important, as Combusken is very weak to it. Both of these also consistently beat Mareanie. Other Pokemon that beat Mareanie, like Mr. Mime and Life Orb Kadabra, are solid partners as well. Since Combusken does not appreciate being worn down, especially if using Life Orb, entry hazard removers like Komala, Silvally formes, and Altaria work well with it.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is Combusken's most powerful move and allows it to sweep much more easily due to its high Base Power. Most notably, at +2 Attack, it has a good chance to OHKO Gourgeist-XL, as well as Swanna after Stealth Rock. Sky Uppercut is Combusken's strongest Fighting-type STAB move, and though it is still not particularly strong, it synergizes well with Flare Blitz, notably threatening Pokemon like Golem and Rapidash. Protect synergizes well with Speed Boost to guarantee that Combusken can obtain the boosts it needs to outspeed its foes.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Firium Z is generally the best option, as Inferno Overdrive is incredibly powerful, notably allowing Combusken to KO physically defensive Altaria at +2 with Inferno Overdrive followed by Flare Blitz. In addition, it OHKOes Swanna after Swords Dance. Fightinium Z is another option to OHKO physically defensive Golem as well as Silvally-Water after Stealth Rock at +2.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In most games, this Combusken set should focus on sweeping late-game. While Combusken can OHKO or 2HKO almost every Pokemon in the metagame after a Swords Dance boost, its reliance on Flare Blitz means it gets worn down quickly. Thus, it is important that Pokemon like Muk and Gourgeist-XL are weakened significantly before attempting a sweep. Always plan the use of Combusken's Z-Move well. Not only is it a way to break through Pokemon Combusken otherwise couldn't beat, such as Altaria, it also is the only way for Combusken to have an accurate, powerful, and recoil-free STAB move. Since Combusken will usually be looking for a setup opportunity, it is important to identify which foes it can exploit. Examples of such foes include Gourgeist-XL and Leafeon, but there are several others depending on how healthy Combusken is. Especially against offensive teams, it is sometimes not necessary to set up to sweep, as Flare Blitz's power and Combusken's solid offensive typing already allow it to clean up such teams late-game. Sometimes, Combusken can be used as a wallbreaker instead of a sweeper, as it is easily capable of breaking through many Pokemon. It can be an especially effective wallbreaker when playing against bulkier teams that rely on cores like Bronzor + Gourgeist-XL. However, since it often gets worn down too quickly while setting up and by Flare Blitz recoil, it is generally better to preserve it for late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Combusken generally needs the opposing team weakened before reliably sweeping and wants as little Flare Blitz recoil as possible, wallbreakers like Komala are welcome teammates,  weakening Gourgeist-XL reliably and, less reliably, Mareanie. Parting Shot from Silvally formes can give Combusken more opportunities to switch in and set up. Combusken struggles to break through Silvally-Water, especially without Fightinium Z, so Pokemon that reliably beat it like Assault Vest or specially defensive Komala are quite useful. Combusken appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Golem, Bronzor, and Crustle in order to wear down the opposing team and achieve its KOs more easily. In a similar manner, Combusken appreciates Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon like Komala, Altaria, and Silvally formes in order to avoid being worn down by entry hazards in addition to Flare Blitz recoil.</p>"

  "Vigoroth": {
    "overview": "<p>Vigoroth is a fantastic defensive sweeper. Thanks to its great bulk and access to reliable recovery, common offensive Pokemon such as Golem and Choice Scarf Electivire can't 2HKO Vigoroth and therefore are rendered setup fodder. Vigoroth only needs a few EVs to outspeed Monferno and common defensive Pokémon such as Altaria and Probopass. This, coupled with Taunt or Substitute, allows Vigoroth to use them as setup fodder as well. However although Vigoroth's bulk is great, if it loses its Eviolite, Vigoroth becomes more specially frail, and giving it a harder time setting up and making it easier to revenge kill. Vigoroth faces competition from the several other Normal-types in ZU, most notably Bulk Up Komala, which, despite being worse at defensive sweping, is far more versatile. Also, Vigoroth doesn't benefit from its pure Normal typing, which doesn't bring it any useful resistances. Vigoroth also can't afford to run anything other than a Normal STAB move as an attack and therefore needs several Attack boosts to break through Pokemon that resist Normal such as Bronzor and Probopass. In addition, Vigoroth is unable to touch Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Misdreavus and relies on PP stall to beat them. Since Vigoroth needs several turns to set up, it is unable to perform its role if it gets poisoned, making it very vulnerable to Toxic Spikes. Vigoroth is also vulnerable to Trick / Switcheroo from Choice item users, which locks it into one move and prevents it from setting up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Vigoroth can run a stallbreaker set with Toxic / Slack Off / Taunt / Seismic Toss, but it's general outclassed by Regigigas, which pressures stall more effectively thanks to its greater offensive presence. Vigoroth can also run a fully specially defensive set ; however, that doesn't let it avoid any extra 2HKOs, and it allows Monferno to force Vigoroth out. Vigoroth can run moves no foes are immune to such as Night Slash to prevent it from being walled by Ghost-types. However, they lack the power needed to be worth it. Vigoroth can also run Chip Away to beat opposing defensive setup. However, it's often not worth it because of the lack of power and the fact that Taunt already deals with every defensive setup Pokemon, outside of other Vigoroth. An offensive set is outclassed by the other offensive Normal-types such as Komala, Bouffalant, Raticate, and Purugly.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Monferno, Silvally-Fighting, and Combusken can break Vigoroth Substitute even at +1 in Defense. If they carry Swords Dance, they can use Vigoroth as setup fodder. However, non-Flame Orb Machoke and Adamant Monferno are not answers to Vigoroth.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attacker</strong>: Some strong special attackers, such as Raichu, offensive Beheeyem, and Simipour, can overwhelm Vigoroth thanks to their strong offensive moves. They can also use Vigoroth as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Without an Eviolite, Vigoroth loses its ability to set up on a wide portion of the metagame and is forced out by most special attackers. If Vigoroth isn't carrying Substitute, its Eviolite can easily be removed through Knock Off from Pokemon such as Kecleon and Mareanie. Its Eviolite can also be removed through Trick or Switcheroo from Mr. Mime or Floatzel.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Poison</strong>: Vigoroth cannot reliably set up if it's badly poisoned, which makes Toxic Spikes one of the best ways to ensure Vigoroth can't set up. If Vigoroth isn't carrying Substitute, faster Pokemon carrying Toxic such as Silvally-Fighting, can also prevent Vigoroth from setting up.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Vigoroth is unable to hit Ghost-types, which allows them to switch into Vigoroth for free. However, Vigoroth can PP stall many of them, such as Gourgeist-XL, if it's running Taunt. However, Taunt Vigoroth is unable to deal with Misdreavus, which outspeeds it and can safely Taunt it first. Moreover, Dusclops can stall out Vigoroth's Slack Off with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users</strong>: Faster Taunt users, such as Floatzel, Simipour, Misdreavus, and Grumpig can prevent Vigoroth from setting up and use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Pyukumuku</strong>: If Vigoroth isn't carrying Taunt, Pyukumuku will wall Vigoroth forever and PP stall it thanks to Spite and Rest. Moreover, if running Poisonium Z, it can bypass Vigoroth's Taunt for one turn and poison it.</p> <p><strong>Lickilicky</strong>: Thanks to its ability Oblivious, Lickilicky can Toxic Vigoroth through Taunt. Moreover, Lickilicky has access to Seismic Toss, which does heavy damage to Vigoroth, and breaks its Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Phazers and Haze Users</strong>: If Vigoroth isn't carrying Taunt, it can lose its stat boosts to Haze or Roar users such as Mareanie, Altaria and Avalugg.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up allows Vigoroth to increase its Attack and Defense, making it very difficult to take down with physical attacks. After one Bulk Up, it avoids the 2HKO from Rampardos' Rock Slide and threatens opposing walls such as Golem and Altaria. Facade is the preferred offensive move on Taunt Vigoroth, as it lets Vigoroth take advantage of status such as burn from Scald, poison from Sludge Bomb, and Toxic from faster Pokemon. Return is Vigoroth's strongest STAB move, which can 2HKO, threats such as Electivire and Combusken after Stealth Rock. Slack Off keeps Vigoroth healthy throughout the game, allowing it to accumulate Bulk Up boosts. Taunt allows Vigoroth to avoid common countermeasures to defensive sweepers such as status moves like Bronzor's Toxic, hazing or phazing moves such as Mareanie's Haze, opposing Taunt coming from slower Pokemon such as Mawile, and setup from slower sweepers such as Curse Muk and defensive Nasty Plot or Calm Mind Beheeyem. It also lets Vigoroth PP stall Ghost-types such as Gourgeist and beat Pyukumuku, the only viable Unaware user in ZU. Substitute is an option over Taunt that makes Vigoroth less susceptible to status from offensive moves, such as burn from Scald and paralysis from Discharge, and protects it from fast status users, such as Silvally-Fighting, and Trick Pokemon, such as Mr. Mime. It also lets Vigoroth scout for what move a Choice item attacker will lock itself into. However, it leaves Vigoroth susceptible to slower Taunt, Pyukumuku, phazing, Ghost-types, and slower setup.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The 92 EVs in Speed along with a Jolly nature allow Vigoroth to outspeed Adamant Monferno, preventing it from easily stopping Vigoroth. The rest of the EVs are put in HP and Special Defense, since Vigoroth's special bulk is lackluster without EVs and doesn't get boosted by Bulk Up. The Eviolite is used to further increase Vigoroth's overall bulk. It also allows Vigoroth to check special attackers such as Zebstrika and Rotom-S without Trick. Vital Spirit is Vigoroth's only ability, avoiding sleep from Jumpluff, Smeargle, and Bellossom and therefore letting Vigoroth set up on them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Vigoroth should always avoid status, so when facing a Pokemon that can carry Toxic, it should use Substitute or Taunt. Try to keep Vigoroth at full health with Slack Off so it can set up on Pokemon such as offensive Golem. Don't start to set up until Vigoroth checks are removed. If Vigoroth is facing a Pokemon that could carry Trick / Switcheroo, switch it out, as a Tricked Vigoroth is useless. When every Pokemon that can deal with Vigoroth has been removed, proceed to set up and sweep. The best way to get rid of checks and counters is to weaken them through entry hazards and wearing them down with unboosted attacks, as most of Vigoroth's answers, such as Silvally-Fighting and Bouffalant, don't have recovery. Toxic poison can also help Vigoroth get rid of checks that can recover their health such as Nasty Plot Beheeyem and Roost + Calm Mind Oricorio, as they will get overwhelmed by Vigoroth's boosted attacks and the poison. Vigoroth can also act as a defensive check to unboosted offensive Pokemon that don't carry status, such as Golem, Rapidash, and Silvally-Dark. It can also easily take on physical Electivire lacking Cross Chop and Zebstrika, though it should usually not be used as check a to them in case they punish Vigoroth with VoltTurn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Poison-type such as Muk and Mareanie are potential partners, since they remove Toxic Spikes, which prevent Vigoroth from setting up. They also can switch into Fighting-type moves that can beat Vigoroth, such as from Raichu and Simipour in the case of Muk and Combusken and Silvally-Fighting in the case of Mareanie. Altaria, Gourgeist, and Granbull are great partners in general for their ability to take on physical Pokemon that can force Vigoroth out, such as Silvally-Fighting and Power-Up Punch Kecleon. They also make for great checks to Knock Off users like Pawniard and Komala, which are vital for Vigoroth. In the case of Altaria and Granbull, they can further support Vigoroth with Heal Bell. Pursuit Silvally-Dark can remove many answers to Vigoroth, such as Misdreavus, Grumpig, and Beheeyem. Probopass's ability to remove Steel-types, such as defensive Probopass and Bronzor, is also appreciated by Vigoroth, which struggles to break them, as its ability to safely bring Vigoroth in the field with its slow Volt Switch. Pokemon that can absorb status, such as Altaria, Komala, and Mareanie, make great partners for Vigoroth, due to how weak to status it is. Because of its lack of Leftovers, Vigoroth is quickly worn down by hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, preventing it from staying in to set up and from defensively checking anything while Toxic Spikes are up. Thus, hazard removal from the likes of Altaria and Silvally formes is greatly appreciated by Vigoroth.</p>"

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mawile stands out in the ZU tier as one of the few Fairy- and Steel-type Pokemon available. Mawile is also a premier Stealth Rock setter due to its ability to set up entry hazards on common Pokemon such as Komala, Kecleon, or Silvally-Fighting, and its unique typing allows it to check several prominent threats such as Toucannon and Muk. Its support movepool is additionally well provided with moves such as Knock Off, Super Fang, Taunt, and Pain Split, which sets it apart from other Stealth Rock setters. Moreover, Mawile has access to two useful abilities in Intimidate and Sheer Force, which allows it to be played either as a wall or as a wallbreaker. However, offensive Mawile is very frail due to its lack of investment in bulk. Therefore, it is unable to take strong hits, even resisted ones, such as Psychic from Beheeyem and Multi-Attack from Silvally-Fighting. Furthermore, Mawile's offensive stats aren't much better, and it is walled by physical walls such as Pyukumuku and Gourgeist-XL. Its low Speed also makes it easily revenge killed by most offensive Pokemon such as Combusken and Swanna and even by defensive Pokemon like Altaria. Moreover, Mawile is weak to two very common offensive types in Ground and Fire, which causes it to be forced out by common Pokemon such as Golem, Torterra, Rapidash, and Combusken. A lot of hazard removers such as Swanna, Silvally-Water, and Rotom-S force Mawile out, which makes its role as an entry hazard setter troublesome.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If Mawile is running Taunt, defensive sets can run 36 EVs in Speed in order to outspeed Gourgeist-XL and therefore wall it, whereas offensive sets can run Ice Punch to target Torterra and other Ground-types. However, outside of these specific matchups, Mawile would prefer to run other coverage moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Combusken, Rapidash, and Simisear threaten to OHKO Mawile with their super effective STAB moves. This let them use Mawile as setup fodder. However, they don't want to come in against an incoming Toxic or Super Fang, since it significantly hurts their longevity.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Mawile is weak to Ground-type moves, which makes it easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Golem, Torterra and Sandslash. This also means that Pokemon that Mawile is supposed to check such as Bouffalant and Komala can bypass it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Mawile is extremely susceptible to special moves, even resisted ones such as Chatot's Boomburst and Kadabra's Psychic and weak ones like Electivire's Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzor and Probopass take very little damage from Play Rough and are immune to Toxic. However, Bronzor doesn't appreciates getting hit by Knock Off or Swords Dance-boosted Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong>: Mawile is susceptible to being trapped and OHKOed by Magnet Pull users in Probopass and Alolan Golem. Mawile can't deal significant damage to them and should be played carefully if facing any of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Because of its low bulk and reliance on Intimidate to wall physical attackers, Mawile struggles to beat setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Vigoroth, Coil Arbok, and Swords Dance Bouffalant.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough is Mawile's strongest move, which allows it to OHKO Hakamo-o after chip damage. It also deals significant damage to defensive Pokemon that are weak to it such as Machoke, Silvally-Dark, and Altaria and to frail Pokemon such as Kadabra and Chatot. However, Seismic Toss can be used for consistent damage, which lets Mawile hit Pokemon such as Curse + RestTalk Muk and Bronzor, but this leaves it helpless against Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Misdreavus. Thanks to this move, Mawile can break Vigoroth's Substitute, therefore making it a good check to it. Pain Split is Mawile's best recovery move, and it pairs well with Mawile's low base HP stat. It lets Mawile better weaken defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Gourgeist-XL than its other offensive moves. Toxic is Mawile's best way to weaken opposing walls and punish threats to it such as Combusken, Golem, and Gourgeist-XL. Taunt improves Mawile's matchup against bulkier Pokemon such as Bronzor, Pyukumuku and Shiinotic, preventing them from recovering the lost damage and shutting them down. Knock Off is an option that lets Mawile remove items from Pokemon that switch into it such as Bronzor's or Mareanie's Eviolite and Lickilicky's Leftovers. Super Fang is another option that lets Mawile better beat defensive Pokemon, but it prevents it from hitting Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Dusclops. Running this move over another offensive one also means that Mawile will rely on Toxic to knock opposing Pokemon out. Super Fang paired with Taunt can turn Mawile into a great stallbreaker, halving opposing Pokemon's health while preventing them from healing.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Intimidate allows Mawile to better check physical attacker such as Silvally-Fighting, and Toucannon. Mawile appreciates Leftovers due to its lack of a reliable recovery move. If Mawile runs Pain Split, it can afford to hold Rocky Helmet in order to deal chip damage to physical attackers such as Sawsbuck and Leafeon and punish Pokemon such as Silvally-Fighting and Komala that use U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mawile should absolutely avoid any special move because they do a lot of damage to it. This also includes special moves from mixed attackers. Mawile can check some Pokemon only if their Attack has been lowered; therefore, if Mawile is already on the field, it may be unable to deal with Pokemon it's supposed to check such as Pinsir and Bouffalant. However, it should be sent out against the physical attackers it beats such as Toucannon, Leafeon, and Raticate and use them as an opportunity to set Stealth Rock. Mawile can also be sent out against an anticipated Toxic from Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Silvally-Fighting. This allows Mawile to set Stealth Rock, threaten them with Seismic Toss, Super Fang, or Toxic, or use them to get health back through Pain Split. It shouldn't be sent out on Pokemon with Defiant such as Pawniard, which gets a boost in Attack and can beat Mawile. It should also avoid setting up Stealth Rock if the opponent has an entry hazard remover that can easily come into Mawile such as Swanna, Sandslash, and Silvally-Ground. Instead, Mawile should punish these entry hazard removers with Toxic, Seismic Toss, or Super Fang.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Mawile is quite vulnerable to special attacks, it appreciates being paired with a specially defensive Pokemon such as Komala, Kecleon, or Lickilicky. Lickilicky and Komala are especially potent partners, since they can support Mawile with their Wish and appreciates Mawile's ability to take on physical attackers. A check to Fire-types such as Altaria, Mareanie, or Hakamo-o is mandatory, since they can use Mawile as setup fodder and threaten it with their super effective STAB moves. For the same reason, checks to Ground-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Bronzor are appreciated. VoltTurn users such as different Silvally formes, Electivire, and Komala and strong wallbreakers or sweepers such as Combusken, Bibarel, and Fraxure appreciate Mawile's entry hazard support. Specially offensive Water-types such as Floatzel, Swanna, and Simipour can take on Ground- and Fire-types that threaten Mawile, while Mawile can take on specially defensive Pokemon such as Kecleon and Komala and Grass-types such as Shiinotic and Jumpluff for them.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Play Rough and Iron Head are Mawile's best STAB moves. The former allows it to hit Fighting- and Dark-types such as Poliwrath, Hakamo-o, and Silvally-Dark for super effective damage and is also Mawile's most powerful move, dealing strong damage even to neutral foes such as Beheeyem and Komala. The latter is a bit less strong but not less useful, hitting Rock- and Fairy-types such as Golem, Crustle, Shiinotic, and Granbull for super effective damage while also dealing better damage to Poison-types that resist Play Rough such as Muk and Silvally-Poison. Knock Off is a strong move that allows Mawile to break through Bronzor as well as remove items from Mawile's checks such as Mareanie and Sandslash. Sucker Punch is Mawile's best priority move and should only be used if it is carrying Swords Dance, as the Attack boost is required to remove most Pokemon faster than Mawile such as Electivire and Swanna. It also allows Mawile to have a better time cleaning offensive teams. Thunder Punch allows Mawile to deal super effective damage to Mareanie, which resists both its STAB moves and is able to wall Mawile, as well as always 2HKO Pyukumuku after Stealth Rock. Fire Blast lets Mawile deal with Grass- and Steel-types such as Gourgeist-XL and opposing Mawile, as well as OHKOing Avalugg after Stealth Rock. However, Mawile's low Special Attack makes it a subpar coverage option otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb coupled with Sheer Force and an Adamant nature increases Mawile's wallbreaking capacities, which allows it to OHKO foes like Rotom-S after Stealth Rock with Play Rough. A Jolly nature can be used to enable Mawile to outspeed Pokemon that would otherwise force it out such as Marowak, Komala, and Bouffalant.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mawile is very frail without investment in bulk and Intimidate, so it should absolutely avoid taking any unresisted hit or special move. Instead, Mawile should be brought in via VoltTurn support from Pokemon such as Silvally and Electivire, on a hit that it is immune to such as Hakamo-o's Dragon Tail or Muk's Poison Jab, it can also come onto the field through aggressive double switches, predicting a Pokemon that can't deal with Mawile such as Zweilous. Since Mawile can't afford to take hits, it should use Swords Dance either on opposing Pokemon that can't deal significant damage to it, such as Muk, or it threatens out, such as Vullaby and Machoke. Don't try to wallbreak with Mawile if its checks such as Torterra, Sandslash, and Rapidash haven't been significantly weakened. Mawile should be switched out if it's facing a faster Pokemon that hits hard such as Swanna, Rapidash, or Silvally-Ground, unless they have been weakened enough to be finished off by Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because of its inability to come in on most hits, Pokemon that run U-turn or Volt Switch such as different Silvally formes, Electivire, and Jumpluff are great partners for Mawile. Offensive Mawile best fits on most offensive builds, so other attackers such as offensive Stealth Rock Golem, Raichu, and Pawniard that can weaken Mawile's checks and counters such as Rapidash, Mareanie, and Sandslash are appreciated. Since Mawile is slow as a wallbreaker, it appreciates being played on offensive Sticky Web teams, so a Sticky Web setter such as Masquerain, Smeargle, or Shuckle makes a good partner for Mawile. Likewise, fast attackers such as Floatzel, Purugly, and Zebstrika as well as Choice Scarf users such as Electivire, Rapidash, and Silvally are potent partners, since they improve the matchup against most offensive teams. These Pokemon also appreciate Mawile's ability to weaken opposing walls, which lets them have a better time cleaning the opposing team. Stealth Rock and Spikes support is appreciated by Mawile, since it chips away its checks.</p>"

  "Camerupt": {
    "overview": "<p>Camerupt is a terrifying wallbreaker thanks to its amazing power and almost unresisted STAB Fire / Ground coverage. Its access to the horrifyingly powerful Eruption is complemented by its secondary Ground STAB and allows it to greatly threaten common defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor, Mareanie, and Mawile. Camerupt's unique Fire / Ground typing also gives it an interesting niche defensively as a check to certain Electric-types such as Rotom-S and Raichu. It also packs some good support options, such as Stealth Rock and Lava Plume. However, Camerupt is unfortunately handicapped by a terrible Speed stat that leaves it outpaced by common offensive Pokemon such as Swanna, Exeggutor, and Torterra. This can limit Camerupt's utility in matchups against offensive teams. Camerupt's STAB combination, while very good, can often be played around by many common defensive cores, making Camerupt a very prediction-reliant wallbreaker at times. Its weakness to common Water- and Ground-type attacks also gives it poor matchups against common offensive Pokemon like Swanna, Floatzel, and Marowak. Said weaknesses greatly limit the defensive set as well, and it tends to require more support from its teammates than its competition as a result. It also has notably less bulk than other Stealth Rock setters, such as Golem and Torterra, and has a much narrower defensive niche than they do.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A spread with maximum HP and Special Attack investment and a Quiet nature can be used on the Choice Specs set on Trick Room teams. Roar can be used on the defensive set to force the opposing Pokemon to switch around and rack up Stealth Rock damage. Expert Belt or Firium Z can be used on the offensive set to give Camerupt a better matchup against teams that look to get around it by switching to Pokemon that resist or are immune to its attacks, but the loss of consistent power makes this generally unfavorable. Rock Polish could be used to turn Camerupt into a cleaner, but it is easily revenge killed by the tier's Choice Scarf users and is annoyed by many of the priority options in the tier.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Solid Rock is not enough to save Camerupt from its 4x Water weakness, as all offensive Water-types are capable of OHKOing it with their STAB moves. Swanna, Floatzel, and Simipour all fall into this category, although they don't appreciate switching into the Choice Specs set. Defensive Water-types such as Poliwrath and Silvally-Water are capable of taking offensive Camerupt's hits better and still heavily threaten it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Many of the tier's more powerful Ground-types threaten to KO Camerupt, even through Solid Rock. Choice Band Torterra, Golem, and Marowak are all very threatening to Camerupt, although none of them want to switch into its attacks. Similarly, Ground-type coverage on Pokemon such as Electivire and Rapidash threatens to 2HKO Camerupt.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Camerupt's somewhat modest bulk and relative sluggishness mean that even the defensive set is threatened by strong wallbreakers. Choice Band Komala, Choice Band Golem, and Bouffalant all threaten Camerupt with their powerful attacks. In addition, Choice Specs Exeggutor and opposing Camerupt are also powerful enough to threaten the specially defensive variant of Camerupt.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Camerupt's lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to all entry hazards mean that it is worn down quickly. Said vulnerability also means that Eruption's power is weakened every time Camerupt switches into battle with hazards up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Eruption is extremely powerful when Camerupt is at full health and is quite spammable, as even frailer Pokemon that resist it like Swanna and Simisear are OHKOed after Stealth Rock. Fire Blast allows Camerupt to still use a strong Fire-type STAB attack after its health has been reduced. Hidden Power Ice prevents Camerupt from being walled by Altaria, which is one of the few Pokemon that can confidently switch into Camerupt's STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Modest nature is preferred for maximum power output. Timid can be run if outspeeding Adamant Golem and Crustle is really important to your team, but it isn't recommended. Solid Rock allows Camerupt to take some weaker Ground-type attacks that would otherwise KO it. Notably, it allows it to survive Choice Scarf Electivire's Earthquake from full health in a pinch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Camerupt is generally an excellent option early-game, when it can fire off its powerful attacks to blow a hole in the opponent's defensive core; defensive entry hazard setters like Bronzor and Mareanie, for example, will be forced to flee from Camerupt, preventing them from getting their hazards up early and allowing Camerupt to fire off one of its powerful attacks. Camerupt's unique typing also grants it the ability to switch into Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-S and Electivire locked into an Electric-type move. Take advantage of these opportunities, as Camerupt can have some issues getting in, especially against offensive builds, due to its low bulk and somewhat exploitable defensive typing. Pivoting or aggressively double switching can allow Camerupt to get in against such offensive teams. Getting rid of entry hazards on your side of the field is important when using Camerupt, as losing health cuts into Eruption's Base Power and Camerupt needs Eruption at its maximum damage output if it wants to seriously dent Pokemon such as Lickilicky. Refrain from using Eruption if it looks like Camerupt will have to take a hit before moving, and use Fire Blast instead if this is the case.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cleaners appreciate Camerupt's ability to wallbreak early-game, as it allows them to clean up late-game with greater efficiency. Options such as Z-Rain Dance Swanna, Rock Polish Torterra, and Z-Me First Pinsir work well in this regard. Grass-types like Silvally-Grass, Gourgeist-XL, and Leafeon pair well with Camerupt, as they comfortably switch into both types that hit it super effectively. Camerupt, meanwhile, can take a few Fire- and Bug-type attacks, though it would be unwise to do so if Eruption is still needed. Silvally-Grass stands out in particular, as it can also remove entry hazards with Defog and use U-turn to get Camerupt in safely. It is worth noting, however, that this type pairing needs a check to Swanna, which hits both Camerupt and the Grass-types with its STAB attacks. An offensive Electric-type such as Electivire or a defensive answer like Bronzor can work in this regard. Camerupt in general greatly appreciates pivots that can get it in safely. Other options such as Silvally-Water, Electivire, and Komala can work in this regard, as they can use U-turn, Volt Switch, and Parting Shot to get Camerupt in safely. Entry hazard removal is imperative, as Camerupt must be as healthy as possible if it wants Eruption to be at full power. Defog support from the likes of Altaria, Silvally-Water, and Swanna can work well.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Camerupt is a decent Stealth Rock setter thanks to its ability to force out common Pokemon such as Rotom-S and Bronzor. Toxic allows Camerupt to punish common switch-ins, such as Swanna, Silvally-Water, and Altaria. It also allows it to punishes bulkier Pokemon that might look to take advantage of Camerupt. Earth Power is generally the superior option in the last slot, as it allows Camerupt to immediately threaten Pokemon such as Combusken, Electivire, and Raichu. Protect can also work to scout for Choice item users and rack up Leftovers recovery, but it can allow threatening Water-types to get in safely. Will-O-Wisp can be used to spread burns, and Yawn can be used to potentially spread sleep and force switches, but Lava Plume and Toxic take care of that as is, and the utility provided by the other moves is generally better.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Camerupt works best as a specially defensive wall, as its purpose is to check threats such as Raichu and Rotom-S. Solid Rock is the preferred ability, as it allows Camerupt to take a couple of weaker super effective attacks, such as Earthquake from Choice Scarf Electivire and Jolly Torterra.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Camerupt should be used throughout the game to set up Stealth Rock and check certain special attackers like Rotom-S, Silvally-Dragon, and special Combusken. Switch into Pokemon that Camerupt can deal with, such as Rotom-S, Raichu, and Muk, to set up Stealth Rock or stop the latter two from setting up with Earth Power. Camerupt's reputation as a fearsome wallbreaker can help force some switches until the set is revealed. This can give Camerupt some opportunities to set up Stealth Rock early-game or cripple a normal switch-in like Swanna or Lickilicky with Toxic. Camerupt rewards scouting for powerful attacks and potentially deadly coverage moves. Be cautious to not overestimate Camerupt's bulk, as even invested it has issues taking powerful attacks from the likes of Exeggutor, Beheeyem, and Simisear. Camerupt should mainly look for opportunities to check certain Electric-types and set up Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Camerupt fits well on balance teams that need a bulky check to the aforementioned Electric-types that can also set up Stealth Rock. Water-types such as Silvally-Water and Floatzel pair very well with this set, as they appreciate Camerupt's ability to take Electric-type attacks and can take the Water-type attacks that threaten Camerupt in return. Grass-types such as Leafeon and Silvally-Grass also work well with Camerupt, as they resist both Water- and Ground-type attacks that could be thrown Camerupt's way. Strong wallbreakers such as Exeggutor, Choice Band Torterra, and Beheeyem appreciate Camerupt setting Stealth Rock up for them in order to break the opposing team down. Choice Band Torterra in particular can take Ground-type attacks for Camerupt and appreciates Camerupt's favorable matchup against Pokemon such as Bronzor and Gourgeist-XL. Camerupt appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Silvally-Water, Altaria, and Komala to prevent itself from getting worn down too quickly.</p>"

  "Cacturne": {
    "overview": "<p>Cacturne is a powerful Pokemon that has a niche for its offensive Grass / Dark typing and coverage. It can function as a mixed attacker that threatens walls like Golem, Poliwrath, Pyukumuku, and Dusclops while also taking on faster attackers like Electivire and Kadabra with a strong priority attack in Sucker Punch. Spikes are a rare entry hazard that Cacturne can afford to fit, as its offensive presence gives it opportunities to set them when forcing switches. With Swords Dance, Cacturne becomes a sweeper with powerful priority that can also break through walls like Mareanie, Torterra, and Lickiliky. However, Cacturne is very frail, which gives it limited opportunities to set up or wallbreak. This is compounded by its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards and reliance on Life Orb to break through major defensive targets and its weakness to common coverage, especially to U-turn from users like Silvally-Dark and Furfrou. Cacturne also relies on Sucker Punch to patch up its mediocre Speed, which means it has a hard time against faster attackers that resist Dark like Combusken, Silvally-Fighting, and Monferno. Lack of a usable physical Dark-type move outside of Sucker Punch allows more Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL, Muk, Rapidash, and Rotom-S to wall it or play around Sucker Punch and renders both sets unable to break Shiinotic. This makes Cacturne hard to support on teams, as it has limited windows of opportunity to perform as a sweeper or revenge killer.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poison Jab can OHKO Shiinotic, a wall that otherwise counters Cacturne's sets, but lacks any other targets that Cacturne's existing coverage already hits. Similarly, Stomping Tantrum can OHKO Muk after a Swords Dance boost and still hits Steel-types like Mawile and Pawniard but leaves Cacturne reliant on Sucker Punch to break through other Pokemon that resist Grass like Bronzor and Bouffalant. Cacturne can try a physical set with Spikes, but it lacks a reliable pair of STAB attacks compared to the special variant. A Nasty Plot set can function as a dangerous wallbreaker. However, it tends to be less effective than the Swords Dance set, as it fails to boost its priority move and thus makes Cacturne more vulnerable to revenge killers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Faster Fighting-type Pokemon can easily manage Cacturne offensively while resisting Sucker Punch. In addition, Combusken and Monferno resist Cacturne's Grass-type coverage, Silvally-Fighting pressures with U-turn, and Poliwrath takes it on with priority in Vacuum Wave.</p> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: U-turn is 4x super effective against Cacturne, causing it to be either forced out or KOed when up against pivots like Silvally-Dragon, Silvally-Dark, Toucannon, and Furfrou. These pivots do have to be weary of Sucker Punch if they are weakened into its KO range, though.</p> <p><strong>Defog Users</strong>: Many Defog users like Silvally-Dark, Silvally-Fighting, Altaria, and Rotom-S can work around Cacturne's coverage, revenge kill it, and remove its Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Muk</strong>: Due to Cacturne's unreliable physical coverage and frailty, Muk can wall both variants of Cacturne and revenge kill with Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Shiinotic</strong>: Shiinotic resists both of Cacturne's STAB attacks and can OHKO it with Moonblast. Shiinotic only has to worry about the unlikely chance that Cacturne runs Poison Jab just for it.</p>",

      "Offensive Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Giga Drain is a reliable Grass-type attack that has recovery to combat Life Orb recoil. Sucker Punch allows Cacturne to still be offensively threatening to faster Pokemon like Swanna and Mr. Mime that may try to revenge kill it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An investment that prioritizes Cacturne's Special Attack rather than its Attack grants it reliable STAB attacks in Giga Drain and Dark Pulse and avoids having to rely on Sucker Punch for physical Dark-type coverage. 252 Speed EVs allow Cacturne to be faster than Golem, Marowak, and Sandslash. A Mild nature is chose to maximize the power of Cacturne's special moves while retaining the strength of Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cacturne should be utilized early-game to threaten entry hazard setters like Golem, Marowak, and Sandslash; all the while, it can force these Ground-types to switch out and capitalize by setting Spikes. Some walls like Gourgeist-XL, Mareanie, and Torterra may lack coverage to effectively deal with Cacturne, so it may find an opportunity to switch in on them and attack or set Spikes. Setting Spikes might be futile, however, if the opponent has reliable Defog users that beat Cacturne like Silvally-Fighting, Silvally-Dark, and Rotom-S. Try instead to wear them down with Giga Drain and Dark Pulse if they try to switch in on Cacturne. While Sucker Punch can 2HKO many faster Pokemon, watch out for those that can evade it like Roost Swanna, Substitute Raichu, and Encore Mr. Mime. In these cases, it might be better to not rely on Cacturne to revenge kill these threats unless absolutely necessary. Cacturne is more reliable revenge killing Choice Scarf users like Electivire and Silvally, but these threats still need to be worn down for Cacturne to OHKO them; otherwise, Cacturne's poor bulk prevents it from stomaching their hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes Cacturne works on teams that want the extra entry hazard support to wear down walls and put them in range of the team's setup sweepers. Sweepers like Combusken, Swanna, Simisear, and Bibarel appreciate that their checks like Silvally-Water, Silvally-Dragon, and Poliwrath are put in compromising positions with constant Spikes pressure. In return, Cacturne can rely on their complementary Fire and Water typings when trying to deal with opposing Grass- and Fire-types. Defensive Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Mareanie, and Mawile can be great switch-ins for when Cacturne is being threatened by common pivots like Silvally-Fighting and Furfrou. Mawile in particular can run Rocky Helmet to further wear down these U-turn users. Flying-types like Swanna, Rotom-S, and Toucannon help target Shiinotic as well as Fighting- and Bug-types for Cacturne, while Cacturne helps deal with some of their checks like Metang, Bronzor, and Golem. Rotom-S and Toucannon are also offensive pivots, and other pivot options like Electivire, Silvally-Dragon, and Komala make great teammates to help bring in Cacturne safely.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sucker Punch can OHKO multiple faster threats after a Swords Dance, including Electivire, Simisage, and Floatzel. Superpower can break through Pokemon that work around Cacturne's other coverage like Bronzor, Bouffalant, Mawile, and Pawniard. Substitute over Superpower can help Cacturne avoid status attempts, and Cacturne can set Substitute up safely against the likes of Bronzor and Mareanie. However, lacking Superpower's coverage makes Cacturne less efficient as a wallbreaker, and Substitute only wears down Cacturne further.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb with 252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature provides Cacturne with enough strength to OHKO frail attackers such as Z-Mirror Move Swanna and mixed Simisear after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cacturne should find opportunities to revenge kill vulnerable Pokemon like Golem, Choice Specs Exeggutor and Beheeyem, Komala, and Marowak. In the case of Choice Specs Exeggutor or Beheeyem locked into Psychic, Cacturne can have a rare opportunity to set up Swords Dance safely, though it may still set up on the others when they switch out. Faster Pokemon like Swanna, Rapidash, Chatot, and Kadabra can be revenge killed by Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock or similar chip damage, but they may have status coverage like Roost or Encore to deter it; try scouting for the sets and coverage before relying on Cacturne to revenge kill these targets. If not using Sucker Punch, Cacturne may still risk going for Swords Dance on the aforementioned Pokemon that it can revenge kill on the prediction that they will switch out. Cacturne can be preserved as a late-game cleaner, as after boosting with Swords Dance, it can OHKO walls like Poliwrath and Sandslash, as well as faster threats like Electivire and Silvally-Dragon. Without a Swords Dance boost, Cacturne can still clean late-game with enough prior chip damage, but you should avoid relying on it on situations where Pokemon like Will-O-Wisp Rotom-S, Substitute Simisear, and Z-Celebrate Leafeon are still in the game, as they can play around Sucker Punch. Instead of sweeping itself, Cacturne can offer its wallbreaking capabilities against slower teams to bait threats that lack reliable recovery like Silvally-Water, Mawile, and Granbull to trade hits and put them in a workable range for setup sweepers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cacturne fits on teams that appreciate its strong priority and wallbreaking capabilities to support and revenge other sweepers. Swords Dance Combusken, Bouffalant, and Crustle are physical sweepers that appreciate Cacturne for targeting walls like Golem, Mareanie, Poliwrath, and Pyukumuku for them. They in return help Cacturne by wearing down or breaking through some of its checks like Gougeist-XL, Muk, Shiinotic, and Rotom-S. Entry hazard support is crucial to put multiple threats into KO range from Cacturne's Sucker Punch, and teammates that can provide Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes support can be Mawile, Marowak, Shuckle, and Mareanie. Shuckle also provides Sticky Web, which can allow Cacturne to revenge kill more targets like defensive Silvally-Water and Bibarel. Pivoting support from Rotom-S, Silvally-Fighting, and Furfrou is integral for bringing in Cacturne safely. Pivots can also help scout sets, and in the case of knowing if the opposing target is Choice-locked, Cacturne is able to safely use Sucker Punch or set up. Rotom-S and Silvally-Fighting also check threats for Cacturne; Rotom-S is able to take on Fighting-types, while Silvally-Fighting takes on Dark-types. To prevent relying on Sucker Punch, use alternative revenge killers; Choice Scarf users like Swanna, Electivire, and Silvally work well, as do faster Pokemon such as Kadabra, Floatzel, and Rapidash.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Altaria differentiates itself from other entry hazard removers such as Silvally-Water, Komala, Silvally-Fighting, and Swanna through its combination of resistances, ability in Natural Cure, outstanding overall bulk, and access to reliable recovery. Furthermore, Altaria is able to blanket check many physical attackers such as Rapidash, Pawniard, and Monferno. However, while Altaria is a reliable Defog user, it fails to comfortably switch into entry hazard setters such as Golem and Crustle and also loses to Bronzor. This typically makes it an inferior choice to the aforementioned entry hazard removers. Moreover, while its Dragon / Flying typing gives it many useful resistances, it leaves Altaria susceptible to Stealth Rock and Ice-type coverage commonly run by fast offensive threats like Simisear, Electivire and Floatzel. Lastly, Altaria is somewhat passive and does little to punish switch-ins, which allows setup Pokemon such as Bulk Up Komala and Curse Muk to take advantage of it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heal Bell or Haze may be used over Toxic if Altaria is paired with Toxic users such as Lickilicky and Golem. Heal Bell allows Altaria to provide cleric support for balance and defensive teams alike, whereas Haze enables Altaria to more easily check Pokemon such as Swords Dance Pinsir and Z-Mirror Move Swanna. Earthquake may be used over Flamethrower to catch Pokemon such as Probopass, Electivire, and Taunt Monferno. However, it leaves Altaria unable to punish Grass-types outside of Toxic and is weaker against Pawniard. Dragon Pulse may also be used over Flamethrower as a STAB option to play around Pokemon such as Taunt Floatzel, defensive Golem, and Swanna more easily. A spread of 252 HP / 160 SpD / 96 Spe with a Calm nature can be used to help Altaria better check special attackers such as Combusken, Swanna, and Kadabra. This spread is particularly effective alongside physical walls such as Gourgeist-XL and defensive Golem. A defensive Flyinium Z Dragon Dance set with Fly, Defog or Substitute, and Roost and a spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe with a Jolly nature gives Altaria the ability to creep Choice Band Komala and potentially sweep through teams. However, Altaria is very easy to wall and requires a great deal of support to be effective.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon with Ice-type coverage moves such as Combusken, Floatzel, Poliwrath, Silvally-Fighting, and Ice Punch Electivire threaten to 2HKO or OHKO Altaria due to its 4x weakness to Ice.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Choice Band Granbull, Choice Band Golem, Silvally-Dragon, and Choice Specs Floatzel threaten to OHKO Altaria, while it can only threaten them back with Toxic. Moreover, setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Mr. Mime, Swords Dance Pinsir, and Shell Smash Crustle threaten to OHKO Altaria after a boost.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Altaria is easily shut down by Taunt due to its passive nature, so Pokemon such as Floatzel, Simisear, and Simipour can prevent Altaria from crippling them with Toxic and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: While Altaria is a bulky Defogger, its Flying typing restricts it from repeatedly switching into Stealth Rock to remove entry hazards. Moreover, Altaria is 2HKOed by offensive Golem and Crustle, and loses to Bronzor. This means that Altaria typically cannot remove Stealth Rock easily.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Absorbers</strong>: Pokemon that can switch into Toxic such as Komala, Bronzor, Muk, and Silvally-Poison typically can switch into Altaria freely, while Altaria is forced to switch out.</p>",

      "Defensive Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Roost allows Altaria to repeatedly check attackers and continuously switch into Stealth Rock. Moreover, Roost causes Altaria to lose its Flying typing, enabling it to play around Golem one-on-one. Toxic is used to wear down foes that Flamethrower does not hit for super effective damage, such as Electivire and Swanna. Conversely, Flamethrower enables Altaria to prevent Pokemon like Pawniard and Pinsir from freely setting up on it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs allow Altaria to outpace Adamant Pawniard and maximize its physical bulk in order to check Pokemon such as Swords Dance Combusken and Rapidash. Moreover, Altaria forgoes special bulk investment, since most special attackers tend to run Ice-type coverage to hit it anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Altaria walls much of the metagame, and as a result it can find opportunities to Defog on many Pokemon such as Choice-locked Floatzel, Gourgeist-XL, and Swords Dance Combusken. However, Altaria often fails to switch into most Stealth Rock setters, so it should instead pivot into resisted attacks and use Defog on Pokemon it forces out. While Altaria can be used to blanket check threats due to its typing, it should be wary of Ice-type coverage from the likes of Combusken, Kecleon, and Silvally-Fighting. Altaria should also be used to check more passive Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL due to its ability to absorb status and spread Toxic. In the same vein, Altaria should look to Toxic stall foes and continually use Roost to keep itself healthy. For example, Altaria is able to Toxic stall defensive Golem through Roost. However, it is fairly passive and invites in wallbreakers such as Choice Band Komala and Floatzel. As a result, Altaria can be used to bait in Pokemon it cannot beat and provide an opportunity to double switch, although it has to be wary of Stealth Rock. Lastly, Altaria should make use of Flamethrower and its Speed tier to prevent Steel-types such as Pawniard and Mawile from switching in freely or setting up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Altaria can form fantastic defensive backbones with Pokemon such as Bronzor, Lickilicky, Gourgeist-XL, and Silvally-Water thanks to its plethora of useful resistances. Moreover, these partners help check Pokemon that Altaria struggles with such as Golem, Swords Dance Pinsir, and Choice Specs Floatzel, respectively. It is important to note that defensive cores involving Altaria mainly fit on bulkier or more defensive builds due to their passive nature. Altaria highly appreciates Water-type Pokemon such as Mareanie, Poliwrath, and Silvally-Water, which can pivot into Ice-type attacks or check Rock-type Pokemon. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal such as Rapidash, Pinsir, and Raichu are also good partners. In turn, they help check Pokemon such as Bronzor and Simipour, which Altaria struggles with. In the same token, strong breakers such as Expert Belt Electivire and Choice Band Komala appreciate Altaria's ability to bait in Pokemon so they can come in through aggressive double switches. Lastly, on more defensive teams, entry hazard removers such as Avalugg and Komala can be used alongside Altaria, since it is pressured by entry hazard setters such as Golem and Bronzor.</p>"

  "Kecleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Kecleon is a good bulky attacker with near-exclusive access to the ability Protean, able to naturally check most of the special attackers in the tier due to its high natural Special Defense further boosted by Assault Vest. Its movepool is absolutely fantastic, featuring countless options like Knock Off, Drain Punch, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Fake Out. It also has access to Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch, which are great priority moves that can help deal with Kecleon's type disadvantages from its natural Normal typing, as well as helping compensate for Kecleon's poor Speed. However, Kecleon suffers from competition from Komala, another bulky Normal-type with a similar movepool but with a better ability and access to different options like U-turn and Rapid Spin. Kecleon, unlike its competitor Komala, is horribly vulnerable to status and crippled by both poison and burn. Kecleon also faces competition from Bouffalant as a bulky Normal-type, but both Bouffalant and Komala can diversify their sets while Kecleon is generally pretty one dimensional. While Kecleon sets itself apart with its access to priority and STAB offensive coverage that allows it to threaten balance while still being able to soak up hits, it has an unfortunately moderate Attack stat that leaves it  walled by general physical walls like Altaria and Gourgeist-XL; Ice Beam helps circumvent these issues somewhat, though. Despite its shortcomings, Kecleon is able to set itself apart with Protean and the ability to run mixed sets to help break through some Pokemon that would normally beat it. However, as a bulky attacker, Komala with Comatose is still a better option and generally more suited for the role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb set can be used for more power, but this is at the cost of significant special bulk and it tends to chip Kecleon down even faster. A specially defensive set with Stealth Rock and Recover can be used; however, this set tends to be extremely passive and often ineffective. This set has the ability to run Color Change as well to help deal with special wallbreakers and offensive rain teams, despite Color Change being generally inferior, as it reduces Kecleon's already mediocre offensive presence. Fire Blast can be run to hit Mawile and Leafeon harder while still hitting Gourgeist-XL, but it is generally inferior coverage to Ice Beam for its ability to hit Pokemon like Altaria and Gabite. Power-Up Punch can boost Kecleon's Attack to help it break its checks more easily and can even let Kecleon sweep unprepared teams. Trick Room can be used to take advantage of Kecleon's low Speed or provide additional team support; however, Kecleon will be losing an already sought-after coverage slot and left vulnerable to attack. 228 Speed EVs with a Hasty nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Golem and Granbull, and with Life Orb Ice Beam and a minimum of 116 Special Attack EVs, it is able to OHKO Golem after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO the latter. Toxic can be used to help break bulkier teams because of Kecleon's ability to threaten Heal Bell users like Altaria and Lickilicky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Granbull and Mawile have high Defense and take very little from Kecleon's primary damaging moves. Granbull and Mawile also have Intimidate, which reduces Kecleon's  power even further. Even Mr. Mime can cause issues, as it runs Psyshock to hit Kecleon's weak Defense stat, though it generally gets destroyed by Shadow Sneak. Trick can also be an issue as well.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Kecleon is easily worn down, and Toxic is particularly devastating, as it severely limits Kecleon's ability to perform its duty of checking special attackers throughout the game. Being burned wears down Kecleon, although not as quickly as Toxic, and will halve Kecleon's Attack and render it useless. Along with status, entry hazards such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes wear Kecleon down and make checking special attackers significantly more difficult.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Silvally-Fighting and Monferno can break Kecleon with their powerful STAB attacks, but Kecleon can use Shadow Sneak to help circumvent some of these issues.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Kecleon is threatened by powerful physical attackers like physical Floatzel variants who can take advantage of Kecleon's mediocre Defense stat. Golem is extremely threatening as well, as it usually will outspeed Kecleon and deal a lot of damage, with Choice Band Golem able to OHKO Kecleon.</p>",

      "Bulky Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Kecleon's most powerful move in many situations and provides a ton of usefulness,  as it is able to remove items, including the popular Eviolite on the non-fully evolved Pokemon, such as Mareanie and Bronzor, that inhabit ZU. Drain Punch has excellent synergy with Knock Off, is able to hit Dark-types like Silvally-Dark, and gives Kecleon some passive recovery. A neutral Drain Punch is more powerful than a neutral Knock Off if the target is not holding an item. Shadow Sneak is a useful priority attack that allows Kecleon to revenge kill weakened foes. It also disrupts Fighting-types like Silvally-Fighting and Monferno due to Protean changing Kecleon into a Ghost-type. Ice Beam allows Kecleon to deal with physically defensive Pokemon like Gabite, Altaria, and Gourgeist-XL, which normally would pose a large issue to it. Sucker Punch can be used as a stronger, albeit less reliable form of priority, while Fake Out can help wear down foes more but is only able to be used on the first turn out.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>100 Special Attack EVs allow Kecleon to 2HKO Gourgeist-XL with Ice Beam and OHKO physically defensive Altaria after Stealth Rock damage, as well as OHKOing most defensive Gabite sets. If you're not using Ice Beam, 96 EVs can be placed into Attack and 4 into another stat, and the nature can be changed to Adamant. The remaining EVs are placed into Attack with a Brave nature to not compromise any bulk or power, and a Brave nature doesn't relevantly impact Kecleon's already mediocre Speed. Assault Vest helps Kecleon eat up most special attacks. Protean is a fantastic ability that changes Kecleon's typing with its moves, which also gives them a STAB boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Kecleon should be used as an all-purpose special tank throughout the game, as it is able to switch into Pokemon like Oricorio-F, Zebstrika, and Choice Scarf Chatot somewhat easily. Kecleon's physical bulk is poor, and taking physical hits should be avoided if at all possible. Knock Off can be freely used early-game, as it is Kecleon's most powerful attack and can remove items. Drain Punch should be used when it hits the foe super effectively or if Kecleon is in need of some recovery. Protean should be utilized to the fullest, such as using Shadow Sneak in front of a Fighting-type so Kecleon will be immune to its super effective attack. Kecleon can also use its speed to its advantage in some cases, such as when facing a Choice-locked Normal-type like Chatot, which Kecleon can use Shadow Sneak on to become immune to its Normal-type attack and then Drain Punch or Knock Off on the next turn as the Normal-type will likely outspeed and Kecleon will retain its immunity. This process can be repeated if necessary. However, Silvally-Fighting runs Shadow Claw, so Kecleon needs to be careful, and Kecleon takes a lot from the relatively uncommon Flare Blitz Monferno. Kecleon's health needs to be preserved if it has many special attackers to check throughout the match, so sending it in recklessly on status and entry hazards is unadvised.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Kecleon appreciates physical tanks like Altaria, Golem, Crustle, and Gourgeist-XL that can soak up physical attacks for it. Golem and Crustle are particularly useful for their ability to set Stealth Rock, which help wear down foes for Kecleon. In return, Kecleon can tank special attacks for these Pokemon. Special wallbreakers like Beheeyem and Simisear can help break through some of the physical walls that bother Kecleon. Pokemon with Heal Bell, like some Granbull and Altaria sets, can help keep Kecleon healthy despite the fact that it's an unconventional move in ZU. Status absorbers like Mareanie and Altaria are good teammates for the same reason. Kecleon greatly appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Swanna, Altaria, and Sandslash, as it is easily worn down and entry hazards only further decreases Kecleon's lifespan and force it to use Drain Punch more often. Golem checks, like Gourgeist-XL and Leafeon, are appreciated because Kecleon dislikes taking damage from offensive variants or a Toxic from defensive ones. Pokemon such as Golem and Monferno that appreciate Kecleon's ability to beat bulky foes like Bronzor and Altaria are good teammates.</p>"

  "Dusclops": {
    "overview": "<p>Dusclops differentiates itself from other stall staples by being one of the bulkiest walls in the metagame due to Eviolite. This bulk allows Dusclops to check several Pokemon in one slot such as Z-Me First Pinsir, Golem, and Swanna. Dusclops also has access to Pressure, which allows it to more easily stall out Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Silvally-Dragon, and Poliwrath. This is great for bulkier teams that would otherwise have a rough matchup with the aforementioned Pokemon. However, Dusclops doesn't sport any useful resistances to complement its fantastic bulk; in fact, its weakness to Dark exacerbates Dusclops's heavy reliance on Eviolite to maintain its bulk, which is compounded by the prevalence of Knock Off users such as Leafeon and Pawniard. Dusclops also doesn't have access to any reliable recovery options outside of Rest, meaning it has to rely on Sleep Talk pulling out the correct moves. Lastly, Dusclops has to rely on Seismic Toss and Toxic to deal significant damage to foes, further hampering its matchup versus Ghost-types and Pokemon immune to Toxic such as Gourgeist-XL, Muk, and Mareanie and showcasing its overall passivity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive spread can be used to better check special attackers, but Dusclops still tends to lose to special wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Simisear and Choice Specs Exeggutor due to its low HP and lack of useful resistances, making it difficult to justify. Night Shade is comparable to Seismic Toss in that it deals fixed damage to Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Misdreavus that Dusclops wouldn't be able to hit otherwise. However, being able to hit Normal-types such as Kecleon and Silvally is way more important. Furthermore, without Seismic Toss, Pokemon like Heal Bell Lickilicky, Substitute variants of Bouffalant and Vigoroth, and Comatose Komala are able to fully wall Dusclops. Dusclops may seem like it could be a fantastic PP staller with Pressure and the combination of Spite and Mean Look. However, Pyukumuku is better in this role, despite lacking Pressure, due to its inability to be overcome by setup sweepers such as Simisear thanks to Unaware and its lack of susceptibility to Knock Off. A set consisting of Calm Mind / Ice Beam / Rest / Sleep Talk could allow Dusclops to take on the role of a bulky setup sweeper. However, Dusclops is incredibly prone to being crippled by Knock Off while asleep, compromising its bulk and therefore causing it to underperform in this role compared to other Pokemon such as Curse Muk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Eviolite Removal</strong>: Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo users such as Komala, Choice Scarf Rotom-S, and Choice Specs Floatzel can remove Dusclops’s Eviolite, significantly compromising its bulk and, in the case of the latter two, completely crippling Dusclops for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard and Silvally-Dark all threaten to either 2HKO or 3HKO Dusclops. The former in particular is notable for its access to STAB Knock Off, which removes Dusclops's Eviolite and makes it easier to KO. They all do not appreciate being burned by Will-O-Wisp, however.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers and Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Simisear, Choice Specs Beheeyem, and Rampardos can overcome Dusclops's immense bulk through setting up or their sheer strength.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Misdreavus are immune to Seismic Toss and will either wear Dusclops down over time with Leech Seed and Foul Play or threaten to 2HKO it with Hex while it is asleep from using Rest. However, Dusclops is able to cripple both with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Floatzel and Fraxure can prevent Dusclops from spreading burn and restoring its health, shutting down its walling capabilities considerably.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest allows Dusclops to keep itself healthy enough to check foes throughout the match and is useful for PP stalling out foes in tandem with Pressure. Sleep Talk allows Dusclops to potentially use Toxic or Seismic Toss while asleep, somewhat circumventing its passivity. Toxic is preferred in the third moveslot, as it enables Dusclops to stall out bulkier Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Bouffalant, and Torterra as well as wear down offensive Pokemon such as Rapidash and Silvally-Dragon. Will-O-Wisp burns physical attackers such as Pinsir, Electivire, and Silvally-Fighting and provides a means of dealing residual damage to them, as well as deterring Dark-types such as Pawniard from directly switching in. Seismic Toss bypasses Dusclops's awful offensive stats with a fixed-damage attack that 4HKOes the majority of the metagame.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs alongside a Bold nature allow Dusclops to check physical attackers such as Pinsir lacking Knock Off and Golem. Eviolite boosts Dusclops's Defense and Special Defense, giving it a discernible defensive niche over Dusknoir. Pressure allows Dusclops to easily drain Pokemon out of moves that have low PP such as Floatzel's Liquidation and Golem's Stone Edge.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dusclops should be used primarily to check physical attackers such as Golem, Silvally-Fighting, and Bouffalant and spread Toxic so that it can stall out foes throughout the match. Similarly, if Dusclops is using Will-O-Wisp, it should look to burn physical attackers early so that it can more easily stall them. One should consider when the most opportune time to use Rest is. Using Rest too early can use up the move's PP faster than expected and force Dusclops to rely on Sleep Talk to pull the correct moves. Knock Off is the most common way to cripple Dusclops, as by removing its Eviolite, Dusclops becomes easier to beat. Dusclops should always scout for Knock Off from common users such as Komala by going into a dedicated Knock Off switch-in such as Silvally-Fighting. Secondarily, Toxic users such as Bronzor and Cradily can force Dusclops to Rest prematurely, so Dusclops should switch into a Toxic-immune Pokemon such as Muk or Mawile. Lastly, Pursuit users such as Silvally-Dark can trap a weakened Dusclops, so double switching is the optimal play. Although Dusclops should focus on checking physical attackers, its fantastic mixed bulk and Pressure enable it to PP stall special attackers such as Silvally-Dragon and Chatot, which bulky teams greatly appreciate. Similarly, Dusclops can pivot into support Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Pyukumuku, and Mareanie to PP stall their status moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dusclops fits primarily on stall teams, which necessitate both entry hazard support and entry hazard control. Bulky Pokemon that have access to Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes such as Golem, Bronzor, and Mareanie are crucial for chipping away at the opposing team's health, while Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Komala, Altaria, and Vibrava ensure Dusclops's team doesn't get worn down too quickly. Pokemon that check common threats such as Knock Off Leafeon and Silvally-Dark, like Altaria and Avalugg, complement Dusclops very well, forming a solid defensive core with it. Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off such as Silvally-Fighting and Z-Move variants of Pyukumuku make great teammates, as Dusclops tends to draw the attention of Knock Off users such as Komala and Pawniard due to its Dark weakness and reliance on its Eviolite for bulk. Pyukumuku is also notable for checking several setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Simipour and Swords Dance Pinsir due to its fantastic ability in Unaware, a crucial element of the stall archetypes Dusclops fits best on.</p>"

  "Metang": {
    "overview": "<p>Metang solidifies itself as an excellent Stealth Rock user thanks to its offensive utility, solid Eviolite-boosted bulk, and decent defensive typing. Moreover, Metang separates itself from other Steel-type Stealth Rock users such as Mawile and Probopass thanks to its ability to check Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Mr. Mime and Exeggutor offensively. In addition, Metang is significantly less passive than Bronzor due to its decent Attack stat and coverage options, which makes it a better fit on offensive teams. Similarly, Metang's defensive typing and bulk make it a nice glue for balanced and offensive teams alike, especially alongside Silvally formes such as Fighting, Dragon, and Water. However, Metang's typing and low Speed leave it vulnerable to potent wallbreakers such as Golem, Rapidash, and Swords Dance Pinsir. Furthermore, Metang's reliance on Eviolite makes it susceptible to Knock Off, which is extremely common on Pokemon such as Leafeon, Komala, and Machoke. In addition, Metang's lack of recovery means that it is especially easy to wear down, which limits its ability to switch into resisted attacks repeatedly. Lastly, entry hazard removers such as Silvally-Dark, Sandslash, and Silvally-Ground easily force Metang out and remove the Stealth Rock it sets, severely limiting Metang's effectiveness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zen Headbutt can be used as a fourth move in order to check Poison-types such as Muk and Mareanie more effectively. The move also gives Metang a better matchup against Fighting-types such as Machoke and Silvally-Fighting, which would easily switch into it otherwise. Pursuit can be used to trap frail attackers such as Kadabra, Mr. Mime, and Electivire, but it is too inconsistent and hits a minimal number of threats. Also, Metang fails to Pursuit trap Ghost-type Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL, which can burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Explosion can be used over Toxic or Bullet Punch on more offensive teams, as it helps Metang keep up momentum and prevent incoming entry hazard removers from removing Stealth Rock. Metang can run 124 Speed EVs to outspeed Assault Vest Komala lacking Speed investment so it can use Explosion to prevent Rapid Spin.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Eviolite Removers</strong>: Knock Off users such as Leafeon, Choice Band Komala, Kecleon, and Machoke can remove Metang's Eviolite, which greatly hinders its ability to check Ice-, Psychic-, and Normal-type Pokemon. Moreover, Knock Off from these Pokemon can usually 2HKO Metang. In addition, Trick and Switcheroo users such as Rotom-S, Mr. Mime, and Floatzel can swap their Choice items with Eviolite and cripple Metang for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Golem, Sandslash, Silvally-Ground, and Marowak are able to switch into Metang and 2HKO it. Moreover, Sandslash and Silvally-Ground are able to remove Stealth Rock and prevent Metang from performing its job. However, all of these Pokemon must be wary of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Combusken, Rapidash, Simisear, and Monferno can OHKO Metang after it has been weakened. However, Metang can absorb a hit if it's healthy and potentially KO them back with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Defog users such as Silvally-Water and Silvally-Dragon can easily use Defog on Metang. Similarly, Sandslash and Komala can use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock and threaten Metang with Earthquake or Knock Off Komala can also heal off chip damage with Wish. However, most entry hazard removers must be wary of Toxic, as they are easy to wear down in combination with Stealth Rock chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Pyukumuku, Dusclops, Bronzor, Altaria, and Lickilicky completely wall Metang and have the means to play around Toxic. However, they cannot prevent Metang from setting Stealth Rock and tend to invite in strong wallbreakers.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash enables Metang to check Pokemon such as Choice Specs Exeggutor and Granbull effectively. Thunder Punch is the preferred coverage move because it allows Metang to OHKO any Swanna set and also helps against other Water-types such as Simipour and Silvally-Water. However, Earthquake can be used to hit Pokemon such as Muk, Mawile, Rapidash, and Pawniard for super effective damage. Toxic is the preferred option in the fourth moveslot because it allows Metang to cripple entry hazard removers such as Sandslash, Silvally-Water, and Rotom-S and wear down bulky Pokemon such as Pyukumuku and Gourgeist-XL. Bullet Punch can be used over Toxic to pick off weakened threats such as Kadabra and Golem that would otherwise threaten Metang.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Metang's natural bulk and allow it to switch into Pokemon such as Silvally and Swanna more comfortably. Clear Body is useful against Intimidate users such as Mawile and Choice Band Granbull and also allows Metang to block Parting Shot from Pokemon such as Silvally-Water, which gives Metang a free turn to set Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Metang should not lead against opposing entry hazard setters such as Golem, Crustle, and Bronzor, as they can force it out and prevent it from setting Stealth Rock or heavily damage it and hinder its ability to check threats such as Swanna and defensive Granbull. Similarly, Metang should be wary of entry hazard removers such as Sandslash, Silvally-Dark, and Silvally-Water, as they can freely switch into any of its moves outside of Toxic. Be aware that Silvally-Dark can also Pursuit trap Metang to shave off almost half its health. As a result, Metang should predict incoming switch-ins and cripple them with Toxic. If Bullet Punch is used over Toxic, Metang can play more aggressively, because without the ability to cripple its switch-ins, Metang often needs to double switch to a teammate. Moreover, Bullet Punch enables Metang to revenge kill weakened foes such as Kadabra and Mr. Mime rather than trade damage or be forced out by Trick. Metang should be extremely wary of Knock Off from Pokemon such as Pawniard, Kecleon, and Komala because it needs Eviolite to check opposing attackers. Moreover, Metang is prone to being worn down and, as a result, should watch out for coverage moves from attackers such as Chatot and Mr. Mime. Furthermore, Metang's lack of reliable recovery exacerbates this issue, so it is crucial that Metang conserve its health to check select attackers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Knock Off switch-ins are essential to use with Metang, so Pokemon such as Silvally-Fighting, Silvally-Dark, and Shiinotic pair well. Silvally formes also protect Metang from Trick and Switcheroo users such as Mr. Mime and Floatzel. Pokemon such as Leafeon and Swanna pair well with Metang because of their ability to check Ground- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Golem and Combusken. Pokemon such as Sandslash, Silvally-Water, and Komala complement Metang's Stealth Rock support by providing entry hazard removal. In addition, they are able to check Golem, Crustle, and Bronzor. Wallbreakers such as Choice Band Floatzel, Leafeon, and Swords Dance Silvally-Fighting appreciate Metang's ability to set Stealth Rock and get rid of Swanna, and they also help check Fire-, Ground-, and Dark-types for it. Similarly, setup sweepers such as Z-Celebrate Leafeon and Dragon Dance Hakamo-o appreciate Metang's ability to check defensive Granbull and Kadabra.</p>"

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Torterra is a great Grass / Ground type Pokemon that brings a variety of sets and niches to the ZU metagame thanks to its well-rounded stats and diverse movepool. Torterra either functions as a wall that offers Stealth Rock and recovery or provides multiple forms of sweeping and wallbreaking with its high-Base Power dual STAB attacks, coverage, and setup moves like Swords Dance and Rock Polish. The defensive set in particular can check a range of Pokemon like Golem, Silvally-Dragon, and Mareanie, which also makes Torterra notable for being a Stealth Rock setter with reliable recovery to check these Pokemon consistently. These qualities allow it to fit on many cores, and its natural bulk and power mean that no matter the set, it can be relatively hard to deal with. Torterra does find limitations with its mediocre Speed and multiple relevant weaknesses, as Swanna, Simisear, and Rapidash can all revenge kill the setup sets and threaten wall sets with their coverage. Notably, its 4x Ice weakness allows opposing Ice-type coverage from Electivire, Raichu, and Silvally-Fighting to take it down easily. There is also the multitude of Grass- and Ground-types in the tier like Leafeon and Golem that all give Torterra noticeable competition.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Figy Berry is helpful on some sets, as it can provide passive recovery for when Torterra needs it to set up or to mitigate Wood Hammer recoil. Other damage-reducing Berries all have their own uses to bait and beat different attackers; Yache Berry lets Torterra tank Ice coverage from Electivire and Silvally-Water, Occa Berry allows it to win tradeoffs against every Fire-type in the tier, and a Coba Berry set with Stone Edge allows it to bait and OHKO Swanna and Toucannon. A faster, more offensive Stealth Rock set is plausible on teams that want the extra offensive pressure, but it lacks the utility that the defensive set has. In the same vein, bulkier Swords Dance or even Curse sets can be pulled off, but they tend to be less effective with the lack of Speed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types often resist both of Torterra’s STAB attacks, making it resort to Rock coverage if the set can afford it. Swanna and Toucannon threaten it offensively, while Altaria and Jumpluff can wall most variants of Torterra.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types resist both of Torterra's STAB attacks, making Leafeon, Bellossom, and especially Gourgeist-XL viable checks for the most part, only worrying about stronger coverage like Stone Edge or status from Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor is a great go-to check for Torterra that resists its usual coverage and wears it down with Psywave and Toxic. However, it has to be wary of Choice Band sets with Crunch and of being worn down enough to be put into Bloom Doom range.</p> <p><strong>Ice Coverage</strong>: Anything that can afford to run strong Ice coverage can have an option to offensively check Torterra, notably Ice Beam from Silvally-Water and Ice Punch from Electivire.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Torterra’s low Speed and reliance on its bulk or setup make it vulnerable to many wallbreakers and sweepers like Rapidash, Simisear, Exeggutor, and Choice Band Komala.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Synthesis allows Torterra to recover its health and outstall special attackers like Silvally-Dragon and Kadabra. Stealth Rock lets Torterra be an entry hazard setter that threatens other setters and removers like Golem, Mawile, Sandslash, and Komala. Toxic can be used to threaten switch-ins or entry hazard removers like Gourgeist-XL and Silvally-Fighting, but it makes Torterra much more passive and comes at the cost of one of its more relevant moves like Stealth Rock or Synthesis.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Defense investment is used for tanking general special attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up Stealth Rock when the opponent is using entry hazard setters and removers that have a hard time dealing with or trading hits with Torterra, such as the opposing Golem, Sandslash, Mareanie, Silvally-Dragon, and Silvally-Dark. Torterra can switch in on and force out multiple slower defensive Pokemon like Metang, Mawile, and Pyukumuku, though it does have to worry about being hit by Toxic. Torterra can tank most special hits very well, and even Pokemon with strong super effective coverage like Swanna and Silvally-Water can lose trades, as Torterra can tank their hits and OHKO back with an Overgrow-boosted Wood Hammer. However, it still falls to harder hits like if Swanna is running Flyinium Z. In the same vein, Torterra can be played offensively to set up Stealth Rock early and then sacrifice itself with a favorable tradeoff on attackers like Combusken, Swanna, and Simisear that all have a hard time OHKOing Torterra without the help of a Z-Move. Switching in to block Volt Switch can be risky when Electivire and Rotom-S both have super effective coverage and should be done with caution.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Torterra should be paired with walls that can cover its weaknesses like Bronzor, Mareanie, and Poliwrath, which form a defensive core and enjoy Torterra's good Ground- and Electric-type matchups. Bronzor and Mareanie especially benefit from Torterra's positive matchups against foes like Kadabra and Sandslash thanks to its great special bulk and ability to take a weaker Knock Off. Pivots like Rotom-S and Silvally-Water help take heavy hits from Flying-, Fire- and Ice-type attacks that Torterra struggles tanking on its own. Offensive picks like Komala, Crustle, and Pinsir appreciate Torterra's ability to threaten faster attackers like Kadabra and Silvally-Dragon as well as switch into Ground- and Rock-types that check them defensively. Stealth Rock support from Torterra helps setup sweepers like Swanna and Combusken get the chip damage on walls like Rotom-S and Silvally-Dragon they need to clean late-game.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Torterra to double its Attack against walls that don't threaten it so that it can break past potential switch-ins. Stone Edge helps hit Flying- and Grass-types that resist its STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rockium Z both makes Stone Edge perfectly accurate and grants it high Base Power for anything that resists Torterra's STAB coverage, like Gourgeist-XL or Rotom-S. An Adamant nature is preferred over Jolly for the extra power, though Jolly can be an option to make Torterra faster than Modest Glaceon, Pawniard, and Combusken.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Torterra can set up a Swords Dance against slower walls like Golem and Mareanie to then break past potential switch-ins like Gourgeist-XL, Exeggutor, and Altaria with Continental Crush. Torterra can revenge kill slower walls and frailer offensive Pokemon without setting up like Sandslash, Kecleon, and Crustle. It should not, however, always switch into them, as Kecleon and Crustle heavily threaten Torterra with Ice Beam and X-Scissor, respectively. Continental Crush can catch Flying-type switch-ins like Rotom-S and Altaria off guard when the opponent is predicting either a defensive set or a STAB attacks. Keeping Torterra healthy and distant from status like burn or Toxic allows it to break past walls throughout the game without succumbing to the heavy recoil from Wood Hammer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Late-game cleaners such as Swords Dance Combusken, Choice Scarf Pinsir, and Shell Smash Crustle appreciate the wallbreaking that Torterra can provide early-game. Entry hazards from Metang, Crustle, and Mareanie can all support Torterra with wallbreaking and punishing the opponent from switching out against it. Pivots like Silvally-Water and Rotom-S have good defensive type synergy with Torterra and allow it to switch in more safely while also proving entry hazard removal so that Torterra remains healthy. Pokemon like Bronzor, Rapidash, and Poliwrath help switch into Swanna and Simisear, some of Torterra’s revenge killers, and help defend and keep Torterra alive for longer in the game.</p>"

Crunch gives this set unique coverage primarily to hit Bronzor as well as others like Exeggutor and Gourgeist-XL.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack with an Adamant nature and Choice Band allows Torterra to break past walls like Bronzor and Altaria.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Torterra should be played as a bulky wallbreaker, switching into walls like Golem, Mareanie, and Muk; however, watch out for debilitating status effects from these three. Wood Hammer does enormous damage even to frailer Pokemon that resist Grass like Combusken, Rapidash, and Rotom-S. In these cases, and so long as the opponent does not have a more reliable Grass-type switch-in like Leafeon, Altaria, or Sap Sipper Bouffalant, Wood Hammer is safer to lock into compared to Earthquake. On the other hand, Earthquake can be used without the fear of Torterra losing HP, as Wood Hammer's high recoil severely limits Torterra's longevity. Crunch and Stone Edge are good for catching some of Torterra’s checks off guard like Bronzor and Jumpluff, but their lack of power can be exploited by opposing setup sweepers like Combusken and Silvally-Fighting. These situations and more show that Torterra is heavily prediction reliant and needs to be played accordingly, lest it succumb to inadequate damage. Getting Torterra into Overgrow range for the Attack buff can be done early by letting it trade hits with faster attackers like Leafeon or Silvally or naturally from Wood Hammer recoil.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive U-turn and Volt Switch users like Silvally-Water and Electivire help bring in Torterra and have good defensive type synergy with it. Similarly, defensive pivots such as Bronzor and Mareanie help soak up Ice-, Flying-, and Fire-type attacks from Pokemon that may try to revenge kill Torterra like Electivire and Rapidash. Choice Scarf users like Swanna and Rotom-S help check opposing setup sweepers like Combusken, Crustle, Leafeon, and Chatot if Torterra is locked into unfavorable attacks like Crunch and Earthquake. In turn, Torterra breaks down walls like Sandslash and Mawile for them. Specially attacking late-game cleaners like Z-Rain Dance Swanna and Nasty Plot Raichu appreciate Torterra's prior wallbreaking. Entry hazard removers like Komala and Rotom-S keep the field clean for Torterra to come in safely, avoiding unnecessary chip damage while also threatening common entry hazard setters like Golem, Mawile, and Mareanie. Entry hazard setters on Torterra's side like Metang and Shuckle provide the necessary chip damage to break Gourgeist-XL, Altaria, and Rotom-S; Sticky Web from Shuckle also slows down targets like Silvally-Water and Mr. Mime to make them vulnerable to Torterra.</p>"

      "Rock Polish": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rock Polish allows Torterra to clean a weakened team late-game after setting up. Stone Edge provides the needed coverage to hit Flying-types and Pokemon that resist Grass like Pinsir and Simisage. Swords Dance is another option over Stone Edge to boost Attack and provide a Double Dance set that can break past more walls like Granbull and Silvally-Fighting.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and a Jolly nature are run to outspeed slower Choice Scarf users like Pinsir and Rotom-S after a Rock Polish. Grassium Z provides extra power and negates recoil on Wood Hammer on Silvally-Water and Komala and is especially relevant if Swords Dance is run over Stone Edge. Rockium Z on the other hand offers accurate, powerful Rock-type coverage for hitting Flying-types like Altaria and Jumpluff that could wall Torterra without it.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Set up a Rock Polish to clean late-game once faster Choice Scarf users like Electivire and Swanna are dealt with, along with bulkier physical walls like Gourgeist-XL and Shiinotic that Torterra cannot break on its own. Torterra’s natural bulk allows it to set up on walls and sweepers alike, such as Golem, Sandslash, and Silvally-Dragon. It does lack some firepower, though, meaning foes like Silvally-Dragon needs to already be significantly weakened for Torterra to set up on and sweep past them. If Torterra has Swords Dance, try to boost the appropriate stat when needed, or use both setup moves when the opponent is trying to sacrifice their Golem or Mawile and is not expecting the Double Dance set. When up against defensive teams, Torterra may not need to set up Rock Polish and instead can be best played expendably to try to dent walls like Pyukumuku and Poliwrath.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support from Bronzor or Metang helps Torterra secure the chip damage it needs to clean late-game, and their useful Ice- and Flying-type resistances help against attacks that scare Torterra. Wallbreakers like Choice Band Komala and Nasty Plot Simisear help break through walls that check Torterra like Bronzor and Gourgeist-XL. Pursuit trappers like Silvally-Dark and Pawniard also get rid of Bronzor and additionally can secure the damage needed on other attackers to put them in sweeping range for Torterra. Other sweepers like Life Orb Combusken and Nasty Plot Simipour can bait revenge killers like Choice Scarf Electivire and Rotom-S, which can all be setup fodder for Torterra once they are Choice locked. Swanna and Silvally-Fighting are worthwhile entry hazard removers that can allow Torterra to preserve its full natural bulk for when it enters the field to set up and sweep.</p>"

  "Monferno": {
    "overview": "<p>Monferno can be an offensive Stealth Rock user thanks to its offensive typing and ability to pivot. Good Speed and access to U-turn make it a great lead that is able to pivot on opposing Stealth Rock users and incoming entry hazard removers, helping it keep Stealth Rock on the field. Fire / Fighting is also a unique offensive typing that allows Monferno to threaten a wide range of Pokemon, from entry hazard setters such as Bronzor and Cacturne to wallbreakers such as Choice Band Komala, Swords Dance Pawniard, and Exeggutor. However, Combusken gives Monferno stiff competition, being a much more potent offensively thanks to Speed Boost. Furthermore, unlike Combusken, Monferno's Speed leaves something to be desired, leaving it vulnerable to faster threats such as Swanna, Electivire, and Silvally-Dragon. Also, many common Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Mareanie, Rotom-S, and Altaria check Monferno defensively, limiting its capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Monferno can run a dedicated Stealth Rock lead set with Focus Sash, Endeavor, Mach Punch, and Taunt on hyper offense teams. Taunt prevents slower leads from setting entry hazards, and the combination of Focus Sash, Endeavor, and Mach Punch aims to pick up quick KOs or heavily wear down foes. However, offensive Golem tends to outclass Monferno as a dedicated lead, and Monferno loses much of its utility with this set. Choice Band can be used over Eviolite, with Mach Punch and Iron Fist replacing Stealth Rock and Blaze. This gives Monferno immediate wallbreaking power and strong priority, but Monferno is walled by various defensive Pokemon such as Mareanie and Altaria regardless. Nasty Plot with Focus Blast, Fire Blast, and Vacuum Wave is a viable option with 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature. While the metagame has many natural checks to this set, it does help Monferno punch through physically bulky Pokemon such as Sandslash, Gourgeist-XL, and Poliwrath and act as a setup sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Mareanie, Poliwrath, Swanna, and Silvally-Water hard wall Monferno. The latter two can also use Defog to remove the Stealth Rock Monferno sets up. In addition, faster Water-types such as Simipour and Basculin can OHKO Monferno and prevent it from setting Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Sandslash, Marowak, Silvally-Ground, and Golem are able to tank an attack and KO Monferno back. They also force Monferno to pivot out in a lead matchup and prevent it from setting Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Altaria, Vibrava, and Silvally-Dragon all switch into Monferno comfortably and can remove the Stealth Rock Monferno sets. The latter two have access to Roost and Defog as well, effectively shutting Monferno down.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Entry hazard removers such as Sandslash, Silvally-Ground, Silvally-Dragon, Altaria, and Rotom-S comfortably switch into Monferno and remove Stealth Rock from the field, but they must watch out for Monferno bringing in a teammate off U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Kadabra, Mr. Mime, Floatzel, and Electivire threaten to KO Monferno with STAB attacks or coverage. Other revenge killers such as Choice Band Furfrou and Rapidash can also KO Monferno after it has been weakened.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Monferno is affected by all forms of entry hazards and usually does not run Slack Off, so it gets worn down very quickly because of its constant pivoting and switching into resisted attacks.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn generates momentum and helps Monferno against switches it forces against opposing Pokemon such as Bronzor, Silvally-Dark, and Bouffalant. Slack Off is an option over Close Combat or Flare Blitz that allows Monferno to reliably pivot into threats such as Pawniard and Cacturne.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite gives Monferno decent bulk and enables it to soft check threats such as Pawniard, Glaceon, and defensive Komala. An Adamant nature is used over Jolly because Monferno appreciates the power more than outspeeding niche threats such as Butterfree, enabling it to OHKO foes such as Rapidash after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Against opposing leads such as Golem and Torterra that can tank an attack and threaten to OHKO Monferno back, use U-turn to chip away at them and generate momentum. Avoid setting up Stealth Rock against incoming Defoggers that outspeed Monferno such as Swanna, Silvally-Dragon, and offensive Silvally-Water. Instead, predict them and use U-turn to get a teammate in safely. If Monferno does not have a good matchup as a lead, it can always set Stealth Rock later. Thus, take advantage of switches Monferno forces against Normal-, Steel-, and Grass-types such as Bouffalant, Mawile, and Exeggutor. While Monferno soft checks Dark- and Grass-types such as Pawniard, Cacturne, and Leafeon, it lacks recovery and is easily worn down. Pawniard and Leafeon can also remove Monferno's Eviolite with Knock Off, so avoid switching it into these Pokemon early-game to preserve Monferno's bulk. Similarly, be mindful that bulky Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Mawile, and Bronzor can cripple Monferno with Toxic on a predicted switch, so be careful of switching it into these Pokemon if you rely on it to check other threats or set Stealth Rock over the course of a game. That being said, when Monferno is weakened into Blaze range, Flare Blitz becomes ridiculously powerful, so be sure to position Monferno correctly to take advantage of that one-time nuke.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Monferno fits best on offensive and balance teams that want an offensive Stealth Rock user that can provide momentum. Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Beheeyem, Swords Dance Torterra, and Nasty Plot Raichu take advantage of Stealth Rock and capitalize on Monferno's U-turn pivoting. In particular, Beheeyem and Torterra appreciate Monferno's ability to check Bronzor and Exeggutor, while Raichu threatens Monferno's switch-ins such as Swanna and Rotom-S. Additional pivots such as Silvally-Dragon, Rotom-S, and Choice Scarf Electivire help keep up momentum and check Pokemon Monferno does not handle such as Altaria, Poliwrath, and Mareanie. Offensive Grass- and Water-types such as mixed Simisage, Leafeon, and Swanna check Ground-types such as Silvally-Ground and Sandslash for Monferno and can also prevent them from removing Stealth Rock. Pawniard and Silvally-Dark take advantage of Monferno's pivoting and are able to Pursuit trap Psychic-types such as Beheeyem and Kadabra that threaten Monferno.</p>"

  "Bibarel": {
    "overview": "<p>Bibarel stands out among the plethora of Normal-types in ZU thanks to its unique combination of Simple and Swords Dance raising its Attack by 4 stages in one turn. After such a boost, Bibarel's defensive checks are very limited, and it is able to break through common physical walls such as Torterra and Mareanie. Thanks to its Water typing, Bibarel can break through common Normal-type checks such as Golem and Bronzor. Furthermore, due to the infrequence of faster, Normal-resistant Pokemon, a boosted Bibarel is able to clean late-game with a strong priority move in Quick Attack. However, Bibarel's stats are average at best. Its low initial power means it requires a boost from Swords Dance before becoming threatening. Additionally, Bibarel struggles to find setup opportunities when screens are not on the field due to its mediocre bulk and lack of useful resistances. Most offensive Pokemon such as Komala and Floatzel can OHKO it with their STAB moves and super effective coverage moves. Additionally, its Speed is not high enough to outspeed some very common Pokemon such as Silvally and its different formes and Rotom-S, which also avoid the OHKO from a boosted Quick Attack. Because of these flaws, Bibarel is mostly seen on Sticky Web and dual screens offense with the support of Shuckle and Electrode.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bibarel can give up Liquidation for Crunch to beat two of its biggest counters in Gourgeist-XL and Dusclops. However, Bibarel still loses to Gourgeist-XL holding a Colbur Berry. This also slightly increases Bibarel's damage output against Cradily, even if it needs a substantial amount of chip damage for Crunch to take it out, even after Swords Dance. A Jolly nature can be run over Adamant in order to outspeed several Pokemon like Glaceon and Komala. However, Bibarel already beats them with a boosted Quick Attack. Running Taunt on Bibarel allows it to find more setup opportunities on defensive Pokemon that rely on status moves to hinder is, such as Altaria and Avalugg, as well as defeat Pyukumuku. However, just like for Crunch, Bibarel usually can't find the room for this move. With Lum Berry, Bibarel can find setup opportunities more easily on defensive Pokemon such as Mareanie and Altaria that rely on Scald burns and Toxic to deal with it. However, Bibarel misses out on the boost from Life Orb or Silk Scarf, which is needed to OHKO Bronzor or weaken faster Pokemon such as Leafeon and Furfrou.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types are immune to Bibarel's priority and strongest move. Thus, defensive ones such as Gourgeist-XL, Dusclops, and Shedinja as well as faster ones such as Misdreavus and Gourgeist-S can check it even when boosted. However, all of them have to be careful of being put in range of Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Pyukumuku</strong>: Thanks to Unaware, Pyukumuku ignores Bibarel's Attack boosts. Therefore, due to Bibarel's low initial power, it can easily wall Bibarel throughout the game and cripple it with Toxic or PP stall it with the combination of Block and Spite.</p> <p><strong>Faster Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Since Bibarel isn't fast, several Pokemon such as defensive Silvally formes, Leafeon, and Choice Band Furfrou outspeed it and are bulky enough to take a boosted priority move before KOing it.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Since Bibarel's initial power is very limited, the best way to deal with it is to prevent it from setting up. Its mediocre bulk paired with its mediocre Speed lets it easily getting pressured by common attackers such as Servine, Raichu, and Silvally-Dragon, which can OHKO it before it sets up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Bibarel's strongest STAB move, with its strong Normal-type coverage allowing it to OHKO physical walls such as Poliwrath and Shiinotic after a boost. Quick Attack is preferred over Aqua Jet as a priority move because there are only a few Normal-resistant Pokemon faster than Bibarel, while faster, Water-resistant Pokemon such as Simisage, Swanna, and Silvally-Dragon are far more common. Liquidation is Bibarel's strongest Water-type move, allowing it to tear apart slower Normal-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Mawile, Dusclops, and Bronzor. Aqua Jet is a viable option over Liquidation, since it also targets common Rock-type Pokemon such as Golem and Probopass while allowing unboosted Bibarel to revenge kill Pokemon weak to Water, such as Combusken and Shell Smash Crustle. However, the lower power hinders Bibarel's ability to break through common Normal-resistant Pokemon such as Metang, Corsola, and Dusclops.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred over a Jolly one, as it provides guaranteed OHKOs on the likes of Bronzor, Metang, and Swanna when combined with Life Orb. Since Life Orb Bibarel often faints from the recoil before cleaning the opposing team, Silk Scarf is an alternative that avoids Life Orb's recoil and still boosts Bibarel's hits enough in order to break through several walls such as Mareanie and Poliwrath.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its poor bulk and status vulnerability, it can very hard for Bibarel to set up. Therefore, it is important to decide which Pokemon Bibarel could set up on as early as possible. This includes defensive Pokemon that lacks status moves and super effective moves, such as Mawile and Sandslash lacking Toxic, and offensive Pokemon locked into a weak move Bibarel resists or is immune to, such as Choice Specs Glaceon locked into Shadow Ball and Choice Scarf Electivire locked into Ice Punch. Due to the aforementioned issues, Bibarel should avoid taking hard hits, even if it resists them, such as Rapidash's Flare Blitz. Therefore, it should only enter the field through a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, after a teammate faints, or through a double switch. This also means that Bibarel should stay as healthy as possible to find setup opportunities. Therefore, its entrance on the field should be limited to setting up and potentially revenge killing a weakened foe with Quick Attack or Aqua Jet. Bibarel should avoid coming on the field and setting up if it can't sweep the opposing team or weaken it enough in order for another teammate to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bibarel benefits a lot from dual screens, so a Pokemon like Electrode makes for a great partner. Furthermore, Sticky Web eases a lot Bibarel's matchups against faster threats such as Furfrou and Silvally-Dark, since it allows Bibarel to outspeed and OHKO them with a boosted Return. Therefore, Shuckle or Smeargle fits well with Bibarel. Bibarel appreciates sweepers like Rock Polish Torterra and Swords Dance Combusken that can create setup opportunities by getting revenge killed by Choice item users like Electivire and Floatzel. A Memento user, such as Dugtrio or Jumpluff, benefits Bibarel's team by its ability to give it a setup opportunity. Dugtrio, as well as other entry hazard setters such as Sandslash and Golem, are extremely crucial for Bibarel, as it needs significant chip damage in order to remove faster threats with Quick Attack such as Silvally-Water and defensive Rotom-S. VoltTurn users like Electivire and Silvally-Fighting are also great partners, since they can bring Bibarel in without it taking damage on the field, and they can inflict chip damage to opposing Pokemon such as Leafeon and Rotom-S, putting them in range of a boosted Quick Attack. Since Bibarel struggles against Ghost-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Dusclops, Pokemon that beat them, such as Cacturne, Exeggutor, and Komala, are great partners. In addition, other physical Pokemon such as Swords Dance Torterra and stallbreaker Bouffalant can weaken Bibarel's checks in Pyukumuku, Cradily, and Gourgeist-XL in order for it to sweep.</p>"

  "Rampardos": {
    "overview": "<p>Rampardos is a destructive wallbreaker in ZU. With a monstrous Attack stat, a great ability in Sheer Force, and access to coverage moves like Zen Headbutt and Ice Beam, Rampardos has virtually no defensive counterplay, a feat that other wallbreakers like Marowak fail to achieve. Unfortunately, poor bulk and mediocre Speed mean that Rampardos can be easily revenge killed by common offensive threats like Swanna and Electivire. This is further compounded by Rampardos's Rock typing, which, while solid offensively, leaves it with nasty weaknesses to common Grass-, Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves. These factors can make Rampardos hard to fit onto a team, especially in comparison to other wallbreakers like Marowak and Choice Band Komala, which, while lacking the raw power of Rampardos, have moderately better bulk and access to pivoting in Komala's case.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Minimum Speed investment can be used with Trick Room to bypass Rampardos's mediocre Speed stat. The combination of Swords Dance and Mold Breaker can be used to further augment Rampardos's wallbreaking capabilities, as Mold Breaker allows it to ignore Pyukumuku's Unaware and Avalugg's Sturdy. Surf can also be used over Ice Beam on such a set to OHKO Golem. The extra power from Sheer Force is usually better, though, as Rampardos already has an advantageous matchup with bulkier teams. Rock Polish can fix Rampardos's mediocre Speed and take advantage of the opponent's attempts to pivot around it, creating a powerful late-game cleaner. However, this set still fails to outspeed fast Choice Scarf users like Electivire, which can OHKO it back. Head Smash hits much harder than Rock Slide, but the high recoil and lower accuracy make it an unreliable and volatile option. Choice Scarf can be used to surprise offensive teams, but Rampardos is still outsped by most other Choice Scarf users and is still easy to revenge kill.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: In general, most faster offensive Pokemon can easily dispose of Rampardos. Swanna, Leafeon, Simisage, and other fast Pokemon that hit Rampardos for super effective damage are especially notable.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Marowak, Golem, and Silvally-Ground can take a hit from Rampardos and OHKO it with their STAB attacks. Silvally-Ground is especially notable, as it can outspeed and KO Rampardos without it having a chance to retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Though they cannot switch in safely with the fear of Zen Headbutt, Poliwrath and Silvally-Fighting can take Rock Slides and have enough HP left to threaten Rampardos out with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: A burn from Will-O-Wisp halves Rampardos's Attack, stopping it from doing its job of wallbreaking, while poison and paralysis make it even easier to revenge kill than it already is.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Punch hits Grass- and Steel-types hard, notably 2HKOing Gourgeist-XL, Shiinotic, and Bronzor. Ice Beam dents bulky Ground-types like Torterra and Golem, which resist Rock Slide. For the fourth slot, Zen Headbutt covers Fighting-types like Poliwrath and Silvally-Fighting, which take minimal damage from Rampardos's other moves, making it the preferred choice. However, in exchange for losing coverage on the aforementioned Pokemon, Substitute can be used to capitalize on the switches Rampardos forces and give it a safety net against faster attackers and status. Rampardos has no recovery, though, so it must be used carefully.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Naive nature ensures that Rampardos will outrun slower offensive threats like Exeggutor and Torterra, in addition to most of the tier's walls. Silvally formes like Silvally-Water and Silvally-Fighting are an exception to this, however. Life Orb boosts Rampardos's damage output while simultaneously having its recoil negated by Sheer Force.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Wallbreaking is Rampardos's primary objective, so it should ideally be used early- or mid-game to punch holes in the opposing team for its teammates to take advantage of. To that end, Rampardos functions best when entry hazards are on the field, as they aid it in breaking down potential answers like Torterra and Silvally-Fighting. Try to bring Rampardos in through pivoting moves like U-turn and Volt Switch, as it doesn't have the bulk to take even weak attacks well. Prediction is key when using Rampardos; a proper prediction can mean the difference between getting a 2HKO and being forced out. For example, if the opponent anticipates a Fire Punch and switches Bronzor out for Poliwrath, it could be a good opportunity to heavily damage it with Zen Headbutt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sticky Web support is great for Rampardos, as it can patch up Rampardos's mediocre Speed and give it a fighting chance against offensive teams. Shuckle and Smeargle are prime setters for Sticky Web and can additionally set Stealth Rock or put the opposing Pokemon to sleep with Spore. Setup sweepers like Combusken and Z-Mirror Move Swanna appreciate targets like Mareanie being removed or weakened by Rampardos. On a similar note, strong attackers like Kadabra and Bouffalant enjoy Gourgeist and Bronzor being taken out of the equation, as they can use their STAB moves more liberally. Pivoting is greatly appreciated to get Rampardos onto the field safely: Electivire and Rotom-F can provide Volt Switch support, while Komala, Chatot, and Silvally formes can provide U-turn support. Though all of these pivots can take advantage of the holes Rampardos punches in the opposing team, Electivire and Rotom-F in particular can capitalize on Electric-immune walls like Torterra being removed. On more balanced teams, defensive pivots like Silvally-Water and Altaria can ward off revenge killers like Swanna and Sawsbuck.</p>"

  "Floatzel": {
    "overview": "<p>Floatzel establishes itself as one of the best Water-types in the ZU metagame due to its great attacking stats, excellent Speed tier, two decent abilities, access to wide coverage with Ice- and Fighting-type moves, and ability to run physical, special, and mixed sets effectively. Floatzel's Speed is easily its best feature, outspeeding most of the unboosted metagame. This trait also cements it as a niche revenge killer for Pokemon like Komala and Golem. Floatzel also gets blessed with a STAB priority move in Aqua Jet. This allows it to potentially revenge kill Pokemon that can outspeed it like +2 Combusken. Floatzel does see some competition from other offensive Water-types in the tier such as Swanna, which can avoid grounded entry hazards, clear them away with Defog at the same time, and deal with Poliwrath and Gourgeist-XL with its secondary STAB move. While Floatzel's HP is decent, its overall bulk is not. With a measly base 55 Defense and 50 Special Defense, it is vulnerable to getting knocked out by priority moves like Sucker Punch. Spamming its STAB moves is not easy to do given how many checks there are to Water-type moves like Gourgeist-XL, Silvally-Water, and Silvally-Dragon. While it may be fast, Floatzel is outsped by Choice Scarf Electivire and Silvally, which are able to OHKO Floatzel with their respective STAB moves. It even gets outsped and OHKOed by fast unboosted Pokemon like Zebstrika and Electrode.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Similarly to the Choice Specs set, a Choice Band set could work, especially considering Floatzel is immune to burns and its Attack is better than its Special Attack. A rain sweeper set could also work, but rain is not effective or common, and Floatzel is already fast enough naturally. Running a Modest Choice Scarf set could also work, but it's not necessary, since Floatzel will not hit hard enough and already outspeeds the Pokemon it wants to anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Mareanie, Poliwrath, Silvally-Water, Pyukumuku, and Wishiwashi are nightmares for Floatzel regardless of its set and can easily come in on it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While they're in short supply, faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Electivire, Choice Scarf Sawsbuck, Electrode, Ninjask, and Zebstrika can all OHKO Floatzel with their respective STAB moves. However, they all need to be wary of Aqua Jet should they be weak enough to go down to one.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Due to Floatzel's poor bulk, Sucker Punch from the likes of Pawniard can take a big chunk of its HP and reduce its lifespan.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Threats such as Gourgeist-XL, Lickilicky, and Muk can wall particular Floatzel sets.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Floatzel's strongest special STAB move that allows it to OHKO threats such as Pinsir. Ice Beam is Floatzel's best way to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types in the tier such as Gourgeist-XL, Altaria, and Silvally-Dragon. Hidden Power Electric lets Floatzel hit its biggest competition in Swanna while also hitting the other Water-types in the tier such as opposing Floatzel, Poliwrath, Mareanie, Silvally-Water, and Simipour. Focus Blast is a great coverage move that hits Pokemon such as Assault Vest Komala, Lickilicky, and Kecleon, all of which can easily tank whatever else Floatzel throws at them. With Aqua Jet, Floatzel can revenge kill Pokemon faster than it such as Combusken and Ninjask.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature combined with an EV spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe allows Floatzel to outspeed Raichu, Zebstrika, and Jumpluff and hit hard. Swift Swim is preferred over Water Veil, since it gives Floatzel a better matchup against Z-Rain Dance Swanna, whereas Water Veil is useless on a set based around mostly special attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Floatzel's bulk is not the best and it can easily be worn down, bringing it in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is a smart idea. Furthermore, Floatzel must be wary of getting chipped down over time from entry hazards. Thanks to Aqua Jet, revenge killing is also a great use of Floatzel's skills. Not only can it revenge kill faster Pokemon, but it can also take out some setup sweepers such as Combusken, Crustle, and Simisear. Utilizing Floatzel's great Speed tier to take down Pokemon like Rapidash, Silvally-Dragon, and Simipour with its coverage moves is also a good idea. Floatzel can also beat Pokemon that have poor Special Defense stats such as Granbull, Mawile, and Avalugg.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this set can easily have trouble with Bronzor, having an answer to it such as Choice Band Komala and Simisear is beneficial. As mentioned before, Floatzel's bulk is less than ideal and leaves it susceptible to being OHKOed by Sucker Punch from the likes of Golem, Kecleon, and even Pawniard. Thus, it appreciates having a partner to deal with them like Silvally-Fighting, Combusken, or Machoke. Coming in on Stealth Rock and Spikes can wear Floatzel down quickly, so entry hazard control from a teammate such as Komala, Altaria, or Rotom-S will be essential to keep it going. Having entry hazards of your own is also a good idea, since Floatzel's Special Attack is not the best. Great entry hazard-setting partners include Golem, Bronzor, Sandslash, and Mawile. Wish or Healing Wish support from the likes of Lickilicky and Mr. Mime can give Floatzel a second chance at potentially sweeping. Pokemon faster than Floatzel like Choice Scarf Electivire and Zebstrika can ruin its chances of doing serious damage, so teammates like Golem, Sandslash, and Silvally-Dragon can help by dealing with these threats for Floatzel. Pokemon such as Rapidash and Gourgeist-XL appreciate Floatzel dealing with Ground- and Fire-types, so they make for good teammates and can even form a nice Grass / Fire / Water core.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up lets Floatzel hit harder and take one or two more hits than it normally could. Ice Punch in tandem with Icium Z allows Floatzel to use a one-time attack on Pokemon that would survive Ice Punch such as Rotom-S and Leafeon. Taunt can be used to prevent other potential Taunt users from stopping Floatzel from setting up as well as block Toxic and Thunder Wave that would otherwise cripple Floatzel. Aqua Jet helps to revenge kill threats faster than Floatzel such as Choice Scarf Electivire and Zebstrika after some chip damage. It also can knock out Choice Scarf Rapidash if it's near half of its HP. Low Kick is a great coverage option over Taunt that gives Pokemon such as Komala and Lickilicky a very hard time, especially after a Bulk Up boost or two.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Water Veil grants Floatzel immunity from burns, which is important considering this set is a physical wallbreaker. Floatzel's EVs and a Jolly nature maximize its Speed and allow it to hit as hard as possible physically. Ice Punch becomes Subzero Slammer with Icium Z, and at +1, it lets Floatzel OHKO Silvally-Dragon and Leafeon. Alternatively, Fightinium Z can be used to turn Low Kick into All-Out Pummeling, which at +1 lets Floatzel OHKO Komala, Lickilicky, and Bouffalant while also acting as nice coverage for Silvally-Water.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Floatzel is frail, switching it into any attack is not wise; therefore, it should normally be brought in via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch. This provides Floatzel with momentum, allowing it to set up Bulk Up or attack for free as well as boost on Pokemon that it forces out such as Golem and Altaria. Floatzel is also a great revenge killer if Aqua Jet is chosen over Low Kick or Taunt. If running Taunt, Floatzel has a better matchup against stall teams. Floatzel can handle physically frail Pokemon with this set and should capitalize on this. Such targets include Komala, Life Orb Kadabra, Simisear, and Kecleon. Given that Water Veil prevents burns, this set is an ideal counter to most Mareanie, with Taunt being able to cripple it and force it to use Scald.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Komala, Silvally-Fighting, Electivire, and Rotom-S can bring Floatzel in safely. Entry hazards end up being a problem in addition to Floatzel's less-than-ideal bulk. A partner that can get rid of them such as Altaria, Silvally-Dragon, or Sandslash works well here. Conversely, having entry hazards on the opposing side is also helpful to give Floatzel an easier time dealing with the opposition. Entry hazard-setting partners include Golem, Bronzor, Crustle, and Mareanie. While burns won't be an issue for Floatzel, paralysis and poison cripple it. Thus, having a cleric on the team such as Granbull or Lickilicky certainly would be a good idea. Faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Electivire and Zebstrika derail any chance Floatzel has of being a threat. Therefore, having a partner like Choice Scarf Rapidash or physically defensive Golem certainly helps it out. Gourgeist-XL is also a problem for Floatzel, even with Icium Z. Combusken or Simisear can form a Water / Fire core with Floatzel and help it deal with this particular threat. Opposing Water-types like Swanna and Silvally-Water wall this set completely, so Electric- or Grass-types such as Electivire and Leafeon can help in this regard.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam allows Floatzel to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Bellossom, Silvally-Dragon, and Hakamo-o that Hydro Pump can't hit well. Focus Blast hits Pokemon like Lickilicky, Kecleon, Bouffalant, and Silvally-Water. Switcheroo allows Floatzel to cripple an unsuspecting physical attacker or passive foe such as Komala or Bronzor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature utilize Floatzel's great Speed tier while maximizing its special attacking power. Water Veil is the default ability here, but Swift Swim could be better if used under rain, in which case Floatzel is going to be hard to outspeed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Floatzel is very frail and needs to be brought in safely in order for it to inflict a large amount of damage, preferably through a teammate's U-turn, Volt Switch, or Parting Shot. Floatzel should be looking to use Hydro Pump as often as possible. However, it should nail incoming Grass- and Dragon-types with Ice Beam and use Focus Blast on specially bulky switch-ins such as Lickilicky. Switcheroo is a great tool for crippling bulky Water-type attackers, particularly Mareanie, which Floatzel can't break through it normally. Being Choice-locked into the wrong move can be bad, as it allows the opponent to bring in a Pokemon such as Huntail to set up with moves such as Shell Smash. Due to this, using a super effective or neutral move is best. Being Choice-locked also makes Floatzel a lot easier to play around and forces it to switch out, so making predictions or double switching into a teammate can be necessary.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Floatzel hates Electric-type moves from the likes of Electivire and Zebstrika, having a check to them like Golem helps it out. Like all Choice item users, this Floatzel does not appreciate entry hazards, so removers such as Komala, Sandslash, Altaria, and Silvally-Dragon are strongly recommended. Entry hazards on the opponent's side, however, are much appreciated so as to let Floatzel sweep more easily. Good entry hazard setters for Floatzel include Golem, Crustle, and Bronzor. If Floatzel becomes paralyzed or poisoned, its chances of doing serious damage take a blow. Therefore, having a cleric like Granbull or Lickilicky definitely helps. It is also a good idea to have a partner to absorb status moves such as Machoke or Muk. The latter can also absorb Toxic Spikes should they be on the field. Machoke can also deal with Bronzor and remove Mareanie's Eviolite with Knock Off, while Muk checks Grass-types such as Shiinotic. Pivots like Silvally-Fighting, Rotom-S, Zebstrika, and Electivire that can bring in Floatzel safely are greatly appreciated. Setup sweepers like Crustle that appreciate Floatzel's ability to revenge kill and wear down the opposing team pair nicely with it.</p>"

  "Purugly": {
    "overview": "<p>As one of the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, Purugly stands out from other Normal-types like Komala, Bouffalant, and Silvally with its access to Fake Out, Knock Off, and U-turn. More importantly, Purugly gets Defiant, which allows it to punish Defog users such as Silvally-Water and Silvally-Dark for removing entry hazards from Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Sticky Web users such as Metang, Crustle, and Shuckle. Furthermore, Purugly's above-average Speed tier along with its priority options in Sucker Punch and the aforementioned Fake Out also allows it to take on a revenge killing role. However, Purugly's lack of useful resistances in tandem with its below-average bulk allows it to be taken out quite easily. This, along with the fact that its primary role is to deter entry hazards, means that Purugly is limited to hyper offense, whereas the aforementioned Normal-types fit on a multitude of playstyles. It also faces competition from Pawniard as a Defiant user, as the latter has more useful resistances and decent bulk with Eviolite and receives STAB on Knock Off and Sucker Punch.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stomping Tantrum gives Purugly coverage for Pokemon such as Probopass, Alolan Golem, Mawile, and Carbink, although it doesn't have room on its moveset for the move. Life Orb gives more of a boost to Purugly's attacks than Silk Scarf and also boosts Knock Off, Sucker Punch, and U-turn. However, this compromises Purugly's already below-average bulk and makes it even more susceptible to entry hazards and priority attacks. Purugly also doesn't want to take unnecessary Life Orb recoil when using U-turn against Pokemon it has an unfavorable matchup against, especially Rocky Helmet Mawile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Golem, Crustle, and Carbink usually have high Defense, resist Purugly's Normal STAB options, and, in the case of Carbink, also resists Knock Off and U-turn. This gives these Pokemon ample time to lay Stealth Rock, boost with Shell Smash, or set Trick Room against Purugly.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Avalugg, Gourgeist-XL, and Pyukumuku are able to shrug off all of Purugly's attacks while simultaneously having access to reliable recovery options. Avalugg, in particular, is noteworthy for being able to remove entry hazards via Rapid Spin without triggering Defiant, as well as use Toxic on any potential Ghost-types as they switch in.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Floatzel, Electrode, and Choice Scarf users such as Rapidash and Silvally all outspeed Purugly and take advantage of its low defenses to revenge kill it. However, Purugly can use the combination of Fake Out + Sucker Punch to conversely take out faster attackers, as the aforementioned Pokemon also have low defensive stats and lack means of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards and chip damage wear down Purugly over time, compromising its role of deterring Defog users from removing entry hazards.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defog Deterrent": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fake Out receives STAB and allows Purugly to get off guaranteed chip damage. It also gives Purugly a method to outprioritize foes such as Bibarel and Kecleon, and lets it finish off faster threats like Floatzel and Swoobat. Knock Off is used to remove important items such as Eviolite from Bronzor and Mareanie while also giving Purugly coverage against Ghost-types like Dusclops and weakened Silvally-Ghost that are immune to Fake Out and Return. Sucker Punch is Purugly's secondary priority option and works well in tandem with Fake Out to pick off weakened attackers such as Electivire and Chatot. U-turn allows Purugly to pivot out of unfavorable matchups against Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Golem.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Silk Scarf boosts the power of Fake Out and Return and, unlike Life Orb or Choice Band, doesn't wear Purugly down over time or lock it into one move. Defiant is the most important aspect of Purugly, making Defog users such as Swanna and Silvally-Dark think twice about removing entry hazards for fear of giving Purugly a free +2 Attack boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Just because it is Purugly's first turn on the field doesn't mean it should always go for Fake Out; the opposing Pokemon might switch out predicting it. Fake Out should primarily be used to rack up extra damage against foes that are not already within KO range of Return or Knock Off. While common Defog users such as Swanna and various Silvally formes are still present, try to keep Purugly as healthy as possible. Purugly should primarily switch into Defog when it's healthy enough to take a hit; otherwise, it can be put into KO range. Even if the opposing Defog user chooses not to remove entry hazards, it's still a win-win situation for Purugly, as entry hazard support along with its high base Speed and access to two strong priority moves makes it an exemplary late-game cleaner. A common strategy for Purugly is to use Fake Out followed by U-turn, fodders off a teammate, and switch back in to uses Fake Out again. This strategy is often seen against offensive threats such as Z-Mirror Move Swanna that outspeed the entirety of Purugly's team; such threats are usually huge concerns for the offensive and hyper offensive playstyles Purugly is seen on. By foddering off Pokemon, Purugly can use Fake Out again, allowing it to rack up damage against faster threats and strong priority users like Swoobat, Cacturne, and the aforementioned Z-Mirror Move Swanna that the rest of its team cannot handle.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Sticky Web setters such as Mawile, Crustle, and Smeargle provide Purugly and its offensive teammates with the entry hazard support needed to clean late-game. Spinblockers such as Gourgeist-S have a favorable matchup versus common Rapid Spin users such as Komala and Sandslash and can prevent them from successfully removing entry hazards, pairing well with Purugly. Purugly helps keep entry hazards on the opposing side of the field for offensive Pokemon such as Rapidash, Swanna, Electivire, and Kadabra to take advantage of, allowing them to clean. Pokemon such as Silvally-Ground, Leafeon, and Swanna make good teammates, as they can switch into and check Rock- and Steel-types such as Golem and Pawniard, which Purugly struggles against, after it pivots out with U-turn. Purugly can be used alongside another Pokemon that can pivot and keep offensive momentum such as Electivire, Jumpluff, and Silvally-Fighting to form a solid VoltTurn core.</p>"

  "Bronzor": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzor is able to check a wide array of threats in the metagame, including Golem, Chatot, and Muk, thanks to its great defensive typing, Levitate, and Eviolite-boosted bulk. It can use its ability to switch into many prominent threats to reliably set Stealth Rock, and being able to beat common Defoggers such as Altaria and Swanna makes it more consistent than other setters. However, Bronzor's solid typing does have exploitable weaknesses to Fire- and Dark-type moves. Bronzor has almost no room for variation, making it extremely predictable. It is extremely passive and slow, making it setup fodder for threatening sweepers such as Pinsir, and its weaknesses render it easily trapped by Pokemon like Silvally-Dark and Probopass. This passivity alongside its low Speed also makes it extremely susceptible to Taunt. Furthermore, its lack of recovery outside of Rest and susceptibility to Knock Off limit its defensive capabilities.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic is Bronzor's primary way of doing damage, crippling foes that may try to take advantage of Bronzor's passivity. It is also useful for wearing down defensive Pokemon. Psywave is used to deal direct damage without relying on Bronzor's low offensive stats, making it harder for Pokemon like Grumpig to set up. Rest provides Bronzor with a somewhat reliable form of recovery, but leaves Bronzor vulnerable for two turns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with Eviolite allow Bronzor to reliably take hits from threats such as Chatot and Grumpig. Levitate allows it to also check threats such as Golem and Dugtrio.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Utilize Bronzor's typing and ability to switch into Pokemon it checks such as Golem and Chatot to set up Stealth Rock. If Stealth Rock is already on the field, use either Toxic or Psywave depending on the situation. While asleep, make careful predictions and double switch on threatening Pokemon looking to come in on Bronzor to avoid losing momentum. Be wary of trappers, particularly Probopass, which can remove Bronzor while it is weakened or asleep, allowing teammates like Chatot to sweep. Against Probopass, try to double switch to a Pokemon that can take it on, though there are certain scenarios where Bronzor can stay in and rely on Psywave, mainly if Probopass is weakened. Bronzor must be wary of Substitute, as that will prevent Toxic from working and can leave it in a bad situation.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bronzor appreciates teammates such as Altaria and Mareanie, which can check Fire-types such as Combusken, Monferno, and Rapidash. In return, Bronzor can tank hits from Pokemon like Golem. Knock Off absorbers such as Silvally-Fighting can make for good partners, especially if you are running another teammate reliant on Eviolite such as Mareanie. Silvally-Fighting also threatens Pokemon that pressure Bronzor such as Silvally-Dark and Probopass. Gourgeist-XL, despite sharing some weaknesses with Bronzor, is a great blanket check to Pokemon that rely on Knock Off as a coverage move such as Komala. Bronzor pairs well with Lickilicky for its ability to provide Wish support, making Bronzor less reliant on Rest for recovery. Pyukumuku can deal with many setup sweepers Bronzor struggles with, such as Monferno. Lickilicky and Altaria also make good teammates because they can use Heal Bell to wake Bronzor up early. Offensive threats such as Floatzel and Electivire appreciate Bronzor's ability check Pokemon that threaten them, such as Zebstrika and Golem, respectively.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Sleep Talk allows Bronzor to be somewhat less passive while asleep, but this should only be considered if you have a different Pokemon utilizing Stealth Rock. Hypnosis might sound appealing to put some of Bronzor's checks to sleep, but it is extremely unreliable. Reflect is an option to improve matchups against Pursuit trappers, but it is incredibly niche.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Pawniard can threaten to cripple Bronzor with a devastating Knock Off as well as eliminate it with a powerful Pursuit. Silvally-Dark is both a Defogger and can threaten Bronzor, but doesn't appreciate being hit by Toxic on the switch. Pawniard is especially notable, as it is immune to both Psywave and Toxic, allowing it to completely wall Bronzor.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Monferno, Combusken, Rapidash, and Simisear threaten to do significant damage to Bronzor, but none of them can easily switch in due to Toxic and Psywave. Simisear's access to Taunt can also prevent Bronzor from setting up Stealth Rock or spreading status.</p> <p><strong>Magnet Pull</strong>: Probopass's Magnet Pull allows it to trap and remove Bronzor. However, it can't reliably do so unless it is running its Smack Down + Tectonic Rage set. Alolan Golem, while less common, is more consistent at trapping Bronzor.</p> <p><strong>Eviolite Removal</strong>: Bronzor is severely crippled by Knock Off, as it not only does major damage, but also removes Eviolite, limiting Bronzor's defensive capabilities. Bronzor also fears Trick and Switcheroo from Choice Scarf Mr. Mime, Floatzel, and Rotom-S, which make it easier to take advantage of.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Leafeon, Simipour, and Fraxure can set up and quickly overwhelm Bronzor due to its passive nature. Pinsir is particularly dangerous because of Mold Breaker, allowing it to hit Bronzor with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt users such as Vigoroth can take advantage of Bronzor's passive nature for setup.</p>"

  "Chatot": {
    "overview": "<p>As Chatot possesses STAB Boomburst, one of the most powerful moves in the game, it should come as no surprise that it is a fearsome wallbreaker in ZU. It also has a decent Speed tier that allows it to be a very good anti-offense Pokemon, as it is able to outspeed some of the fastest staples of the metagame like Floatzel, Zebstrika, and Rapidash when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Good coverage moves like Heat Wave and Hidden Power Fighting allow Chatot to hit the Steel-types that are resistant to Boomburst. A lack of viable Ghost-types in the metagame outside of Gourgeist-XL, which cannot switch into Chatot for obvious reasons, allows Chatot to freely spam Boomburst. Access to U-turn allows Chatot to keep up momentum for its team. Access to Encore also allows Chatot to function well in another role as a setup sweeper. While Chatot has a good Speed tier, however, it still fails to outpace common Pokemon like Electivire and Silvally formes when not holding a Choice Scarf. Electivire is one of the most common Choice Scarf users in the metagame, which hinders Chatot greatly. In addition, Chatot's numerous weaknesses and low bulk heavily limit its effectiveness in an offensive metagame, as it is easy to force out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A stallbreaking set using Boomburst / Taunt / Toxic / Roost can be used, but it is generally not advised due to Chatot's minimal bulk and the fact that there are better and faster stallbreakers like Oricorio-F and Simipour. Substitute can help ease prediction on the Nasty Plot set but is often outclassed by another coverage or support move. Additionally, an Agility set can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf users such as Electivire and Silvally that a +1 Chatot cannot, but Z-Encore usually provides more utility, since it has use in more matchups.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Probopass and Alolan Golem</strong>: Probopass is easily Chatot's best check with its high Special Defense, a 4x resistance to both Chatter and Boomburst, and a neutrality to Heat Wave, but it needs to be careful of taking a Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Ground. Alolan Golem is a similarly good check, resisting Chatot's STAB attacks and easily OHKOing it in return. However, Alolan Golem should be wary of Hidden Power Ground.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Normal-type Switch-ins</strong>: Pokemon like specially defensive Golem and Bronzor resist Boomburst and can come in on Chatot's attacks, but they fear some of Chatot's coverage moves. Dusclops can also counter Choice Specs Chatot, but it can be taken advantage of by Z-Encore if it's not careful.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Choice Scarf Electivire and Choice Scarf Silvally can outspeed Chatot and OHKO it with their attacks. Other Pokemon such as Floatzel, Zebstrika, and Rapidash can outspeed and OHKO unboosted Chatot.</p> <p><strong>Soundproof Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with the ability Soundproof such as Mr. Mime, Hakamo-o, and some Bouffalant variants completely wall Chatot, as Chatot does almost all its damage through sound-based moves. However, Breakneck Blitz threatens to OHKO these Pokemon after a Nasty Plot.</p>",

      "Choice Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Boomburst is Chatot's most powerful move and should almost always be clicked except when Chatot needs to hit a foe resistant to it with an appropriate coverage move or when it needs to gain momentum with U-turn. Chatter is a secondary STAB move that has the added effect of confusing the opposing Pokemon. It is also Chatot's most effective option for hitting Gourgeist-XL. Hidden Power Ground is used to hit Probopass and Alolan Golem. Alternatively, Hidden Power Water secures the 2HKO on Golem and still hits Probopass super effectively, even if the damage output is only limited to doing decent chip damage. Heat Wave hits Pokemon like Bronzor, Pawniard, and Gourgeist-XL that resist Boomburst. It also has a chance to OHKO Mawile even without a boost from Choice Specs. U-turn is great for creating momentum, given Chatot's high Speed. It allows Chatot to pivot out of its switch-ins and have its teammates apply pressure to them.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Chatot to function as a great revenge killer against offensive teams, while Choice Specs lets Chatot function as a wallbreaker. When equipped with Choice Specs, Chatot is able to 2HKO even the bulkiest of special walls with Boomburst, such as Muk, Lickilicky, and Assault Vest Komala. It is also able to 2HKO many Normal-type switch-ins, such as offensive Golem and Mawile. Chatot's abilities are mostly useless; Tangled Feet may save it against an opposing Chatot with Chatter. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Chatot to always outspeed unboosted Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Pinsir, Rotom-S, and Vigoroth.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chatot should predict switch-ins such as Golem, Mawile, Dusclops with the appropriate coverage move or U-turn into a teammate so that it can more easily spam Boomburst later. While Chatot should spam Boomburst, it becomes more prediction reliant when using a Choice Scarf because unlike with Choice Specs, it typically cannot muscle past Normal-type resists with Boomburst. When using a Choice Scarf, Chatot should be used to revenge kill offensive Pokemon, like Floatzel and Zebstrika, rather than to wallbreak as Choice Specs would. It can also be used as an effective late-game cleaner. In addition, Chatot is able to bluff sets depending on the situation, so bluffing a Choice Scarf to force the foe out and heavily damaging or KOing an incoming switch-in can be useful at times. When facing a Grass-type, Boomburst will still do more damage than a super effective Chatter or Heat Wave, except against Gourgeist-XL. Chatot has absolutely no defensive value outside of switching into Ghost- and Ground-type attacks, so try not to bring it in directly into an attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Whether Chatot is using a Choice Scarf or a Choice Specs, its teammates remain largely the same. Chatot loves a slow Volt Switch, Parting Shot, or U-turn to help it get in safely, so common users of these moves like Silvally formes, Komala, and Probopass are fantastic teammates. Probopass is a particularly amazing teammate, as it can trap Steel-types like Metang and opposing Probopass, which allows Chatot to spam Boomburst more effectively. Chatot is weak to Stealth Rock, so Pokemon like Sandslash, Swanna, and many Silvally formes are excellent teammates, since they can remove entry hazards for it. Additionally, Chatot appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Golem, Bronzor, Probopass, and Crustle, as it can help Chatot wear down the opponent's team and more easily achieve KOs.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot allows Chatot to become a powerful setup sweeper with an incredibly powerful STAB Boomburst. Encore can be used to take advantage of more passive Pokemon like Altaria and Pyukumuku and setup sweepers like Muk and Vigoroth. It also helps Chatot function as a stallbreaker. Chatter can be used instead of Encore as a secondary coverage move that is boosted by STAB, but Encore should be used if Chatot wants an option to boost its Speed or set up on more passive teams. Heat Wave is used to hit the Steel-types that resist Boomburst and Chatter, and it can nearly OHKO defensive Metang at +2.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Normalium Z turns Boomburst into an incredibly powerful 200-Base Power STAB Breakneck Blitz. Alternatively, when used with Encore, it boosts Chatot's Speed by one stage, giving it an easier time cleaning up. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Chatot to hit as hard as possible while being able to outspeed Pokemon like Pinsir and Bellossom.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chatot should aim to set up on passive Pokemon that can't do anything to it, such as a Pokemon Choice-locked into a Ghost- or Ground-type move. Gourgeist-XL cannot do much damage to Chatot and makes for good setup fodder. Chatot can also use Encore to lock the foe into a healing or setup move and proceed to set up with Nasty Plot for free. Chatot should not set up until its checks are sufficiently weakened, nor should it use its Z-Move too early, as using Boomburst at +2 will KO most foes anyway. The Z-Move is generally used to break through Normal-type switch-ins after a Nasty Plot boost. +2 Breakneck Blitz should be used to break through Lickilicky to prevent it from using Toxic on Chatot or to bypass Soundproof Pokemon like Mr. Mime. Z-Encore should be used when Chatot wants to sweep through frailer teams, while Breakneck Blitz works best against bulkier teams that need to be broken through.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chatot appreciates Pokemon that can weaken and wear down Steel-types, so Pokemon like Electivire and Probopass are great teammates. Chatot has a lot of difficulty breaking through Rock- and Steel-types that resist its STAB moves, so strong Fighting-types like Silvally-Fighting and Combusken and Ground-types like Sandslash and Silvally-Ground can help ease some of these matchups. Water-types like Floatzel and Silvally-Water and Grass-types like Leafeon and can also wear down the Rock-type Pokemon that check Chatot. Pivoting support from Pokemon like Komala, Alolan Golem, and Probopass can help bring Chatot into battle more safely. Entry hazard support from Stealth Rock setters like Golem and Pinsir can help Chatot sweep more easily and secure KOs. Komala and Silvally-Fighting invite Gourgeist-XL in and use U-turn to bring in Chatot so it can use Gourgeist-XL as setup fodder. Electric-type checks, such as Gourgeist-XL, Sandslash, and Golem, are appreciated to prevent Chatot from being revenge killed easily.</p>"

Due to its reasonable physical bulk, Gabite serves as a decent check to many physical attackers in the tier such as Pinsir, Rapidash, and RestTalk Muk. Its ability Rough Skin punishes U-turn users such as Komala and the different Silvally formes, physical threats that might otherwise be able to weaken Gabite without repercussion. Its access to Roar also supports the chipping process provided by Gabite after it has set Stealth Rock, as well as stopping opposing Pokemon from setting up.</p> <p>Despite these attributes, Gabite relies on its Eviolite to function as a decent physical wall, since it can't take hits well from the Pokemon it's supposed to check without it such as Komala and Crustle. Another one of Gabite's disadvantages is its inability to recover its health, which means that it will often be worn down or statused during battle. Gabite is unable to beat common Defog users such as Silvally-Water, Swanna, and Altaria, particularly being completely walled by the last two. Due to running Earthquake as its only attack, Gabite has no way of hitting any Flying-type or Levitate Pokemon, which means that it'll often be completely walled by Pokemon such as Bronzor, Misdreavus, Toucannon, and Swanna. Gabite's 4x weakness to the Ice typing also leaves it susceptible to the numerous faster Pokemon in the tier that carry Ice-type moves such as Electivire and Silvally-Fighting.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragon Claw is an option that allows Gabite to damage the Flying-type Pokemon that otherwise wall it such as Swanna, Chatot, and Rotom-F. This move also lets Gabite hit opposing Dragon-types for super effective damage, such as Altaria, which also troubles Gabite by removing its entry hazards with Defog, as well as Fraxure and Silvally-Dragon, though Gabite will be outsped by them in most circumstances. Dragon Claw can also be run with a spread of max Attack, max Speed, and a Jolly nature, allowing Gabite to function as a more offensive Stealth Rock setter able to outspeed Pokemon such as Monferno as well as pressure hazard removers with ease. Despite this option to increase its coverage, Gabite often has trouble finding room for the move, as it does its job best with the aforementioned set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Ice-type Pokemon or Pokemon with Ice-type coverage are able to threaten Gabite due to its 4x weakness to the typing. Many of them, such as Simipour, Glaceon, and Floatzel are able to outspeed Gabite and KO it with their Ice-type move.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mr. Mime and Granbull are able to heavily damage Gabite with their STAB moves. However, Mr. Mime does not appreciate switching in on an Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Faster special attackers such as Kadabra, +1 Combusken, and Simipour are able to threaten Gabite due to its low special bulk and speed, with it often becoming setup fodder for many of them.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off users such as Kecleon and Komala are able to remove Gabite's Eviolite, thus drastically reducing its physical bulk and opportunities to check other physical attackers.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Physical walls such as Gourgeist-XL and Golem are able to tank any attack from Gabite and cripple it with status, though they don't appreciate being the target of Toxic. Bronzor is Gabite's biggest nuisance, since its ability Levitate and its Steel typing allow it to wall Gabite completely.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Gabite's main STAB attack, notably allowing it to damage other Stealth Rock setters such as Golem and Crustle, as well as being its main way of checking Pokemon such as Rapidash, Pawniard, and specially defensive Komala. Toxic allows Gabite to cripple Defog users such as Silvally-Water and Altaria, as well as catching some of the Pokemon that check it on the switch, such as Swanna and mixed Kecleon. Roar functions as a way of chipping down teams as well as forcing out Defog users and Gabite checks. It can also function as a way of stopping sweepers such as Sap Sipper Bouffalant and Crustle from setting up. Protect grants Gabite a way of scouting for potential coverage moves from Pokemon such as Electivire and Combusken that will threaten to damage or KO Gabite with their Ice-type move. It's particularly useful alongside Toxic to rack up extra damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP and 180 Defense EVs with an Impish nature allow Gabite to take as many physical attacks as possible from threats such as Rapidash and Golem, notably allowing it to survive an Ice Punch from Choice Scarf Electivire after Stealth Rock damage. 80 EVs in Speed let Gabite outspeed base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Pawniard when they're not running a positive Speed nature, allowing it to either set up Stealth Rock, hit them with Earthquake, or poison them before fainting, as well as making it faster than threats such as Beartic, Golem, and Crustle.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gabite works well in the early stages of the game since Stealth Rock, Toxic, and its ability Rough Skin allow it to deal chip damage or cripple opposing teams for potential sweepers. Gabite should attempt to come in on neutral or not very effective physical attacks from Pokemon such as physical Combusken and Rapidash. It should utilize these instances to set Stealth Rock or heavily damage physical threats. After entry hazards have been set, Gabite should utilize Toxic as a way of spreading status to opposing teams. It should also attempt to predict Steel-types and hazard removers that might want to switch in on it, such as Bronzor and Silvally-Water, and make use of Roar to force them out as soon as they enter the field. Protect allows Gabite to scout for potential super effective moves, as well as take advantage of Choice-locked Pokemon on the opposing team. Attempt to keep Gabite as healthy as possible, since its lack of recovery means that it'll be unable to check physical attackers reliably once injured. If this is not necessary, utilize Gabite as a way of pivoting and punishing the use of moves such as U-turn from the opponent. However, Gabite tends to be passive due to its mono-STAB coverage and reliance on utility moves, so it should attempt to utilize these moves as a way of disrupting setup sweepers and crippling expected switch-ins. Gabite should watch out for potential lures from Pokemon such as Combusken, since Hidden Power Ice will be able to heavily damage or OHKO it with ease, stopping it from checking the physical attackers it's meant to stop.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gabite functions better on offensive teams looking for a Stealth Rock setter that is able to provide a range of useful resistances to types such as Fire and Poison and is also able to threaten and pressure opposing Pokemon due to its moveset and ability. Spikes and Toxic Spikes support from the likes of Mareanie and Crustle further aids Gabite in wearing down opposing teams with status and entry hazards. Sweepers such as Simisear and Pinsir are able to threaten the opposing Ice-types that Gabite struggles with, such as Glaceon, while they also appreciate the status and chip damage that Gabite can provide. In turn, Gabite is able to check Pokemon such as Rapidash and Golem, which Simisear and Pinsir tend to struggle with. Cleaners such as Combusken and Pawniard appreciate Gabite's ability to put different Pokemon in range of their attacks due to Rough Skin, Stealth Rock, and moves such as Toxic and Roar, which ensures that many of the opposing Pokemon get chipped down. Wish and Heal Bell support from the likes of Lickilicky, which can also function as an Ice-type answer, can make up for Gabite's lack of recovery, thus increasing its longevity and allowing it to come in on more physical Pokemon. Offensive hazard removers such as Swanna and Silvally-Water are able to form a good core with Gabite, since they're able to threaten Pokemon such as special Combusken.</p>"

  "Lickilicky": {
    "overview": "<p>Lickilicky is one of ZeroUsed's most influential and necessary stall Pokemon. Thanks to its ability Oblivious, Lickilicky is immune to one of the best ways to shut down stall: Taunt. This allows Lickilicky to pressure Pokemon like Vigoroth, Oricorio, and Floatzel with Toxic. Lickilicky also has access to Wish to heal itself and its teammates, which, along with its great HP and good Special Defense, allows it to be the bulkiest Wish passer in the tier. It also has access to Heal Bell, which allows Lickilicky to remove status conditions from its crippled teammates while removing status conditions that would otherwise detract from Lickilicky's own bulk. However, its passivity means Lickilicky has issues against Substitute users and Z-Move sweepers, which is why it only fits on stall and semi-stall teams. It is also forced out by certain U-turn users that threaten its weaker Defense, such as Silvally-Fighting and Choice Band Komala, and is very vulnerable to stallbreakers, such as Duosion, Lapras, and Regigigas.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Normalium Z is a nice alternative to Leftovers to make Lickilicky immune to Trick from Pokemon like Rotom-F, which Pyukumuku cannot beat, and also potentially fully restore its health with Z-Heal Bell. However, this means Lickilicky misses out on the passive recovery from Leftovers. Knock Off is an option on the main set to provide further support for its team by removing the foe's item, hitting Pokemon such as Bronzor, Misdreavus, and Dusclops. However, using Knock Off means Lickilicky is even more vulnerable to Substitute users and setup sweepers because of how weak the move is. Dragon Tail is a decent option for Lickilicky to phaze setup sweepers such as Vigoroth, and it also allows Lickilicky to rack up entry hazard damage and spread status. Dragon Tail's utility is generally inferior to that of Seismic Toss or Toxic due to being relatively weak. An offensive set with an Adamant nature, 176 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe EV spread, and a moveset of Swords Dance or Z-Belly Drum, Return, Knock Off, and Earthquake is plausible. However, Lickilicky is outclassed offensively by other Normal-type Pokemon like Komala, Kecleon, and Bouffalant.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Floatzel, Monferno, and Toucannon target Lickilicky's weaker Defense stat, forcing it to switch out. Offensive Komala in particular threatens Lickilicky, since it is immune to Toxic and can break through its poor Defense stat. Setup Pokemon that use a Z-Crystal such as Raichu, Simisear, and Chatot can set up using Nasty Plot and potentially threaten Lickilicky by using powerful Z-Moves.</p> <p><strong>Stallbreakers</strong>: Regigigas can stall out Lickilicky by outspeeding it and using Substitute. It can also threaten Lickilicky out by using Return or removing its item with Knock Off. Duosion is immune to Toxic thanks to Magic Guard, allowing it to set up and heal off the damage done by Seismic Toss with Recover. Trappers such as Misdreavus, Lapras, and Politoed can trap Lickilicky using Whirlpool or Mean Look, use Perish Song, and then proceed to stall it out.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Silvally-Fighting, Monferno, and Machoke easily come in on Lickilicky and can either set up in front of it, hit it hard with super effective moves, or pivot out.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish gives Lickilicky and its teammates a semi-reliable form of recovery. Protect scouts the foe's moveset, gets a free turn to heal with Wish, takes advantage of Toxic, and weakens damage from powerful Z-Moves. Toxic is needed to break down bulky Pokemon and wear down foes for stall. Heal Bell cures Lickilicky and its teammates of status. Seismic Toss can be used instead of Toxic or Heal Bell to get chip damage on Pokemon immune to Toxic like Bronzor, Komala, and Mareanie. It also allows Lickilicky to break Substitutes. However, using this move requires Lickilicky to forfeit the ability to either threaten rival stall teams or heal itself and its teammates of status conditions.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Oblivious gives Lickilicky an immunity to Taunt, meaning it is not forced to run attacks. It also allows Lickilicky to use Toxic against stallbreakers that rely on Taunt, such as Floatzel, Vigoroth, and Oricorio-F. 248 HP is preferred over 252 HP so that Lickilicky takes less damage from status and entry hazards and to maximize Wish recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lickilicky's Oblivious ability allows it to come in against and pressure common users of Taunt, such as Vigoroth and Floatzel. Lickilicky's naturally high Special Defense means it can easily come in on special attackers such as Kadabra, Silvally-Water, and Zebstrika. From there, it can proceed to use Wish. Protect is vital for scouting what set the foe uses, healing Lickilicky with Wish, and racking up poison damage. Lickilicky can also use Protect to weaken the damage of Z-Moves from the likes of Raichu and Simisear and heal off the damage with Wish. Lickilicky should be cautious around Choice item users with Switcheroo or Trick. Be wary about repeatedly using Heal Bell because it only has 8 PP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lickilicky has problems with setup sweepers; therefore, Pokemon that can stop them, such as Pyukumuku and Mareanie, are good options for teammates. Lickilicky's ability to heal its team with Wish is appreciated by other Pokemon that lack reliable recovery such as Bronzor, Silvally-Ground, and Golem. Ghost-types such as Gougeist-XL and Dusclops make good partners for Lickilicky, thanks to their immunity to Fighting-type moves. Pokemon like Silvally-Ground, Silvally-Water, and Z-Move Pyukumuku are immune to Trick, which cripples Lickilicky. Entry hazard removers, such as Komala and Altaria, are also good teammates for Lickilicky. These two Pokemon also double as status absorbers for Lickilicky thanks to their abilities, and Altaria's own Heal Bell allows Lickilicky to run other options in its moveset.</p>"

  "Electivire": {
    "overview": "<p>Electivire is one of the premier Choice Scarf users thanks to its above-average Speed tier, ability to pivot, and capability to revenge kill top threats such as Swanna and Simisear. Furthermore, great coverage options enable Electivire to run a potent mixed wallbreaker set with Expert Belt that can threaten typical switch-ins such as Golem and Lickilicky. As a result, Electivire is arguably the best Electric-type in the tier due to its offensive capabilities, and it especially thrives in a Water-type-centric metagame. Conversely, in a metagame where Electric-type attacks are ubiquitous, Motor Drive allows Electivire to provide an Electric-type immunity. However, while Electivire is a strong physical attacker, it is often forced to rely on its lower Special Attack to break through physical walls such as Gourgeist-XL. Consequently, Choice Scarf Electivire fails to bust through bulkier Pokemon such as Bronzor. Lastly, Electivire lacks defensive utility outside of Motor Drive and moderate special bulk, which leaves it susceptible to fast physical attackers such as Floatzel and Rapidash.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb may be used over Expert Belt on mixed sets to improve Electivire's power output, but prevents Electivire from being able to bluff Choice Scarf easily and can lead it to being worn down. Maximum Special Attack may be used over the standard physically biased EV spreads in order to more easily play around physically bulky Pokemon like Crustle, as well as improving Electivire's ability to wear down foes through Volt Switch, but is much more reliant on prediction due to the loss of Wild Charge's damage. Lastly, Vital Spirit is a niche option over Motor Drive and allows Electivire to absorb sleep on teams that are vulnerable to sleep inducers such as Jumpluff, Bellossom, and Smeargle.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-type Pokemon such as Silvally-Ground, Torterra, and Sandslash can pressure Choice Scarf and Expert Belt Electivire defensively and threaten to OHKO it, while it typically cannot OHKO them with coverage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf Electivire lacks wallbreaking power and heavily relies on correct prediction to effectively deal damage. Consequently, it is easily walled by bulky Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Cradily, Bronzor, and Dusclops.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Golem can wall Choice Scarf Electivire and subsequently force it to pivot out or lock itself into coverage. However, these Pokemon are heavily threatened by Electivire's mixed set.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: An unboosted Electivire is relatively easy to revenge kill due to its middling Speed tier and mediocre physical bulk. Faster Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rapidash can also threaten to OHKO Electivire.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Electivire to take advantage of forced switches caused by its coverage options, helping it maintain pressure against defensive teams that can otherwise switch into this set. Earthquake catches most Electric-immune switch-ins aside from Silvally-Ground, Sandslash, and Torterra, which Ice Punch can punish alongside Altaria, two target groups Electivire otherwise cannot easily chip down. Flamethrower and Cross Chop are not optimal coverage options, but the former enables Electivire to threaten Gourgeist-XL, and the latter targets Komala.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Naive nature maximises Electivire's speed while still allowing Electivire to OHKO Pokemon such as Floatzel after slight chip damage with Volt Switch. Motor Drive gives Electivire the ability to pivot into Electric-type Pokemon and attacks, improving its defensive utility.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Electivire should be used to revenge kill faster Pokemon after being brought in safely after a KO, off of a double switch, or from a teammate's pivot. Electivire should also utilize coverage moves on predicted switch-ins such as Gourgeist-XL, Silvally-Dragon, and Electric-immune Pokemon such as Golem and Sandslash. Moreover, Electivire should always look to pivot out of Pokemon that wall it, such as Bronzor and Lickilicky. Lastly, while Electivire has mediocre physical bulk, its adequate special bulk and Motor Drive enable it to comfortably switch into attacks from the likes of Zebstrika, Silvally-Water, and Oricorio.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Electivire can form effective VoltTurn cores alongside Pokemon such as Silvally-Water and Oricorio, as they help break down its checks and counters such as Golem and Bronzor. Grass-types such as Simisage and Leafeon are great partners for Electivire, as they can help check Ground-types for Electivire to pivot around more easily. Moreover, Motor Drive allows Electivire to pair well with Water- and Flying-types such as Swanna and Simipour. However, Electivire is stopped cold by bulky Pokemon such as Bronzor and Lickilicky. Thus, strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Komala and Swords Dance Pinsir help eliminate Electivire's defensive counterplay, and they appreciate Electivire's ability to bring them in safely. In the same token, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem is a necessity, as Electivire is able to force many switches and whittle down the opposing team for a late-game cleanup.</p>"

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to its tremendous power and coverage options, Electivire threatens to 2HKO much of the defensive metagame. Its powerful physical STAB Wild Charge enables it to break through Bronzor, whereas typical switch-ins such as Gourgeist-XL, Torterra, and Silvally-Ground are threatened by Flamethrower or Ice Punch. Thunderbolt may be used over Wild Charge to reduce recoil, but it is generally inferior. Lastly, Cross Chop allows Electivire to 2HKO bulky Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Cradily, which would otherwise wall it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Lonely nature is used because Electivire already has poor physical bulk and should not drop its Special Defense. Alternatively, Hasty can be used to outpace Pokemon such as Oricorio and Jolly Pinsir, but results in a notable loss of power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Electivire should be brought in safely through pivots, after a teammate has been knocked out, or off a double switch. Once on the field, Electivire should primarily attempt to fire off STAB attacks, but it is also crucial to predict Electric-type switch-ins and utilize appropriate coverage options. Furthermore, Electivire's middling Speed tier and susceptibility to recoil damage mean that it should be wary of the opponent pivoting around with defensive checks. However, Electivire can capitalize on this by double switching out to a teammate. Electivire's item is not immediately evident, so using Volt Switch to bluff a Choice Scarf set can often be beneficial early on in a match, allowing Electivire to potentially break walls or clean later on in the game. Lastly, Electivire should utilize Motor Drive and its decent special bulk to switch into predicted Electric- or Flying-type attacks from Raichu and Swanna.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Golem, Crustle, and Torterra provide entry hazard support to help net certain KOs, such as against Lickilicky and Crustle. In the same token, Electivire appreciates hazard removers such as Silvally-Water, Servine, and Komala to prevent it from taking chip damage. Mixed Electivire should be paired with Pokemon such as Rock Polish Torterra and Z-Me First Pinsir, which appreciate its ability to break through walls such as Gourgeist-XL and Bronzor. Furthermore, Pokemon such as Floatzel and Kadabra, as well as Choice Scarf users such as Silvally, help check faster attackers that threaten to revenge kill Electivire. Conversely, Electivire pairs well with defensive Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL, Bronzor, and Altaria that can help switch into Pokemon that threaten it. Lastly, pivots such as Silvally-Dragon and Komala pair extremely well with Electivire, as they help bring it in safely.</p>"

  "Probopass": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its ability Magnet Pull, Probopass functions as an effective trapper for Steel-type foes like Mawile, allowing teammates like Muk and Silvally-Dragon to more effectively break the opponent's team. Access to Smack Down and Earth Power also means Probopass can notably trap and KO Bronzor, which is the most common Steel-type. In addition, its solid bulk, low Speed, and access to Volt Switch allow Probopass to function as a decent specially defensive pivot and be one of the better Stealth Rock setters in the tier. However, Probopass's defensive typing is awful, leaving it 4x weak to Fighting and Ground as well as weak to Water, making it easily revenge killed by a wide variety of threats, such as Silvally-Fighting, Floatzel, and Komala. Due to its mediocre offensive stats, Probopass has to rely on a Z-Move to consistently trap Bronzor, meaning it takes up that slot for its team. This also means Probopass cannot hold Leftovers if it wants to trap effectively, meaning it gets worn down easily, especially when combined with its lack of recovery. Lastly, it faces competition from Alolan Golem as a trapper, which is much more offensively inclined and thus more threatening, though Probopass is more consistent in general and can more easily fit utility moves like Stealth Rock onto its set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Probopass can use utility moves like Thunder Wave and Magic Coat to support its team in different ways from its main sets, but neither tends to have much room for it, as they cannot easily give up any of their moves. Similarly, Pain Split would function as a form of recovery, but neither set has a moveslot to spare. Magnet Rise is a solid option to allow Probopass to more easily beat Metang, but it is generally not worth giving up Smack Down, Stealth Rock, or Volt Switch for. If your team already has a Z-Move user, Probopass can opt to run Soft Sand instead of Groundium Z, but it does result in Probopass beating only weakened Bronzor consistently. Probopass can function as a weather setter for sand teams, but the playstyle isn't very effective. It also competes with Hippopotas as a setter, which has access to Sand Stream.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: The likes of Silvally-Fighting can easily switch into Probopass and immediately force it out while it doesn't fear much in return. Monferno and Combusken also come in for free on non-Earth Power Probopass and can set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Pokemon like Silvally-Water and Floatzel can switch into and force out Probopass with ease, as they fear very little from it, although they do not like being taken advantage of via Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While many Ground-types, like Golem and Camerupt don't like taking Earth Power and can thus not switch in very easily, they heavily threaten Probopass with their STAB moves and thus force it out.</p> <p><strong>Komala</strong>: Komala does not fear any of Probopass's moves due to its solid special bulk, can remove its Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin, and forces it out with Earthquake. However, it is prone to being worn down on sets without Wish, and sets that do have it struggle to fit Earthquake on the set.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Smack Down allows Probopass to bypass Bronzor's Levitate, allowing it to be hit by Earth Power. Earth Power hits every Steel-type in the metagame, including Mawile and Bronzor. It is especially powerful when boosted by Groundium Z, as Tectonic Rage OHKOes Mawile and does over half to Bronzor. Volt Switch allows Probopass to pivot around, allowing it to bring in its teammates safely thanks to its low Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The combination of Magnet Pull, Groundium Z, and maximum Special Attack investment allows Probopass to consistently trap and KO Steel-types like Bronzor and Mawile. 84 Speed EVs allow Probopass to outspeed Pokemon like Muk and Metang, notably letting it consistently beat non-specially defensive versions of the latter one-on-one.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Probopass should focus on trapping opposing Steel-types and taking them out for its allies. In most situations, Probopass can be switched directly into weakened Bronzor, as it will always beat it outside of really bad Psywave rolls. Other Steel-types like Mawile, Metang, and opposing Probopass must be more carefully played around due to their access to Fighting- or Ground-type moves. However, Probopass will beat the former one-on-one if brought in safely and is also able to trap weakened Metang consistently. If opposing Steel-types have been removed, Probopass should be used as a pivot, safely bringing in teammates with its slow Volt Switch and providing utility in Stealth Rock. It can also function as a switch-in for Pokemon like Silvally-Dragon and Choice Scarf Mr. Mime, but due to its lack of recovery it will get worn down easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Probopass's best teammates are those that appreciate its ability to remove Steel-types, such as Chatot, Mr. Mime, Beheeyem, and Silvally-Dragon. Oftentimes, after Probopass removes their main switch-in, these Pokemon can easily break apart or sweep the opponent's team by simply spamming their STAB moves. Most of these Pokemon also appreciate Probopass bringing them in safely with its slow Volt Switch. Checks to Fighting-types like Gourgeist-XL, Altaria, and Mareanie are necessary, as Probopass allows opposing Fighting-types to come in for free and they immediately force it out. Similarly, checks to Ground-types are required as well, so Gourgeist-XL and Leafeon work well with it, as well as Pokemon like Electivire and Silvally-Water to check the Water-types Probopass fears.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flash Cannon is Probopass's best STAB move, doing considerable damage to Pokemon like Golem as they switch in, and has decent neutral coverage. Earth Power is mandatory if running Magnet Pull to beat Pokemon like Mawile, and Sturdy sets can use it in place of Flash Cannon to hit Steel- and Poison-types harder than Flash Cannon can, though it does less damage to neutral targets. Toxic can be used to cripple Pokemon like Silvally formes by wearing them down over time. Taunt is another option in the last slot to cripple Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and prevent opposing entry hazards from going up, but it leaves Probopass unable to dent bulkier Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers is Probopass's only form of recovery on this set, giving it some much-needed longevity. Sturdy is generally the preferred ability, ensuring Probopass always gets up Stealth Rock if it is at full HP and protecting it from certain lures. Magnet Pull can be used, but due to a lack of Smack Down and offensive investment, this set does not beat the most common Steel-type in Bronzor, meaning it is not nearly as effective. 84 Speed EVs allow Probopass to outspeed Pokemon like Metang and Muk. The rest of the EVs are placed in special bulk to allow it to take as many hits from special attackers like Beheeyem as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Probopass variant should be used as a check to a variety of special attackers, like Chatot, Beheeyem, non-Focus Blast Mr. Mime, and Silvally-Dragon. It has an easy time setting up Stealth Rock in the face of these Pokemon and should thus attempt to do so as soon as possible, as it offers crucial support for its team. Whichever offensive move is chosen, the lack of Special Attack investment means it generally won't be very strong. As such, crippling a foe with Toxic or pivoting out with Volt Switch is generally a better option to go for. If running Magnet Pull, Probopass can consistently trap and KO Mawile and weakened Metang. However, Probopass loses one-on-one against Bronzor and full health Metang, so it should not attempt to trap those. If Taunt is run, it can be used to prevent Pokemon like Mawile and Bronzor from setting up Stealth Rock, allowing Probopass to easily beat them in the entry hazard war.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>To form a core with Probopass, physically defensive Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and defensive Silvally-Water work well. The former especially checks Ground- and Fighting-types for Probopass, while Probopass in return answers Pokemon like Chatot and non-Focus Blast Mr. Mime. Other checks to Ground- and Fighting-types, like Altaria and Silvally-Water aid Probopass with those weaknesses. The latter two also appreciate its slow Volt Switch to get in safely. Other Pokemon that appreciate being brought in safely, like Pinsir and Floatzel, also enjoy Probopass's support. Many Silvally formes can form an entry hazard control and VoltTurn core with Probopass. Since Probopass functions as a check to Psychic-types, Pokemon like Silvally-Fighting and Combusken pair well with it; both of these also appreciate its slow Volt Switch.</p>"

It further separates itself from other pivots and Defoggers because of its ability to soft check numerous top threats such Swanna, Combusken, Leafeon, and Pinsir. Similarly, Rotom-S is a great Choice Scarf user because of its ability to check various threats, pivot on forced switches, and threaten switch-ins with Will-O-Wisp or Trick. Moreover, utility moves in Trick and Will-O-Wisp make up for Rotom-S's relatively weak offensive coverage and middling Speed compared to Choice Scarf Electivire. However, Rotom-S's weakness to Stealth Rock significantly hinders its ability to pivot. Moreover, a lack of reliable recovery and vulnerability to residual damage limit its ability to repeatedly switch into Pokemon it checks. While its STAB attacks offer decent coverage, Choice Scarf Rotom-S is still easy to wall and usually has to rely on Trick or Will-O-Wisp to cripple switch-ins, which leaves Rotom-S unable to revenge kill faster threats or makes it easy to take advantage of. Also, Rotom-S's typing leaves it unable to directly switch into popular entry hazard setters such as Golem and Bronzor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Leftovers with a bulkier spread of 252 HP / 208 Def / 48 Spe and a Bold nature is an option on the defensive pivot set. The Speed EVs ensure Rotom-S outspeeds Adamant Pawniard, and the HP and Defense EVs make it a better switch-in for physical attackers such as Z-Mirror Move Swanna and Swords Dance Leafeon. However, the loss of Speed is not ideal, as it forces Rotom-S to trade damage against Pokemon it would otherwise outspeed and threaten such as Swords Dance Bibarel, Monferno, and Swords Dance Pinsir. On this set, Protect is an option in the third move slot that allows Rotom-S to generate additional turns of Leftovers recovery and scout out Choice Scarf users such as Electivire and Silvally. Flyinium Z is an option over Wiki Berry if your team lacks a Z-Move user that makes Rotom-S a better Knock Off switch-in and consequently a better check to Leafeon, Pawniard, and Kecleon, and it also allows Rotom-S to OHKO most Grass-types with Supersonic Skystrike. However, without a form of recovery from Wiki Berry, Rotom-S becomes much more reliant on Pain Split and more susceptible to chip damage. Hidden Power Ground over Will-O-Wisp on the Choice Scarf set can help Rotom-S nail would-be switch-ins such as Electivire, Raichu, and Golem, but Hidden Power Ground is a very exploitable move and usually inferior to the utility Will-O-Wisp brings.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electivire, Raichu, and Silvally-Electric all switch into Rotom-S easily and threaten it out. In particular, Electivire and Raichu block Volt Switch thanks to Motor Drive and Lighting Rod, respectively, but they must watch out for Will-O-Wisp and being worn down by Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Golem, Sandslash, Silvally-Ground, and Marowak block Volt Switch and cause Rotom-S to lose momentum as a result. While these Pokemon check the Choice Scarf set, Rotom-S threatens to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Choice Scarf users such as Electivire, Silvally, Simipour, and Rapidash threaten to OHKO Choice Scarf Rotom-S after it is weakened. Similarly, offensive Pokemon such as Choice Band Basculin, Silvally-Dragon, and Simisear outspeed defensive Rotom-S and can OHKO it after some chip damage, though they need to consider knocking Rotom-S down into Wiki Berry range.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Walls such as Bronzor, Lickilicky, and Dusclops easily switch into Rotom-S and only fear Trick. Other bulky Pokemon such as Muk, Beheeyem, and Assault Vest Bouffalant comfortably take on Rotom-S, but they cannot block Volt Switch, and the latter two fear Trick. Rest variants of Silvally-Dark and Silvally-Poison used on stall teams can also switch into Rotom-S and do not fear Trick, but they cannot block Volt Switch.</p>",

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Will-O-Wisp allows Rotom-S to burn slower physical attackers such as Pawniard and Marowak and prevents Electivire and Golem from switching in freely. Pain Split can be used over Will-O-Wisp to give Rotom-S somewhat reliable recovery so it can pivot around and check threats such as Pinsir, Simisage, and Poliwrath.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and HP investment and a Timid nature are necessary so Rotom-S can check Pokemon such as Pinsir, Monferno, and Servine. Wiki Berry is preferred over Leftovers because Rotom-S benefits more from the one-time recovery than it does from residual recovery and can use its Stealth Rock weakness to activate Wiki Berry.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-S should cripple switch-ins with Will-O-Wisp and wear down Ground-types such as Silvally-Ground and Camerupt with Air Slash. This helps it use Volt Switch more freely, as typical Volt Switch switch-ins fear burn or do not want to be worn down. Rotom-S should be wary of what it uses Defog against. For example, Rotom-S loses to entry hazard setters such as offensive Golem and Bronzor, but it can threaten out defensive Torterra, Mareanie, and Mawile. If entry hazards are present, Rotom-S should use Defog against Pokemon it forces out such as Leafeon, Pawniard, and Machoke; be wary of a Knock Off from these three, though, as staying in can jeopardize Rotom-S's recovery later on by removing its Wiki Berry. This also means that Rotom-S should be mindful of its HP, as certain attacks such as Ice Punch from Electivire can 2HKO it without activating Wiki Berry. Similarly, Rotom-S can sometimes use its Stealth Rock weakness to knock itself down to 25% health or less to activate Wiki Berry, which helps it check Pokemon such as Swanna, Combusken, and Simisage in a pinch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-S fits best on balance and bulky teams that appreciate a pivot and soft check to Grass-, Water-, and Fighting-types such as Leafeon, Simipour, and Silvally-Fighting. As such, Rotom-S pairs well with Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Combusken, and Komala. Wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Torterra and Choice Specs Beheeyem appreciate Rotom-S's ability to pivot with Volt Switch against defensive Pokemon they take advantage of such as Lickilicky and Curse Muk. In addition, Rotom-S checks Flying- and Grass-types such as Swanna, Toucannon, and Exeggutor for Torterra and checks Bug- and Dark-types such as Pinsir, Ninjask, and Pawniard for Beheeyem. On more defensive teams, Rotom-S forms a good defensive backbone alongside bulky Pokemon such as Komala, defensive Golem, defensive Torterra, and Gourgeist-XL. In particular, Komala provides Wish support and creates a VoltTurn core with Rotom-S, defensive Golem checks Electric-types, and both defensive Torterra and Gourgeist-XL check Rock- and Ground-types. Setup Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Simipour, Substitute Swords Dance Bouffalant, and Swords Dance Leafeon appreciate Rotom-S's ability to clear entry hazards.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt gives Rotom-S a strong Electric-type STAB attack and makes it more of a revenge killer, but Will-O-Wisp is generally preferred because it punishes typical switch-ins such as Electivire and Golem and gives Rotom-S utility as a Choice Scarf user. Trick enables Rotom-S to cripple counters such as Bronzor, Dusclops, and Lickilicky. It also helps it cripple slower setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Beheeyem and Bulk Up Vigoroth.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature enables Rotom-S to revenge kill foes such as Floatzel, Simisage, and Combusken.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-S's main focus should be to pivot with Volt Switch, but it also needs to anticipate Pokemon such as Silvally-Ground, Sandslash, Electivire, and Raichu switching in and blocking Volt Switch. Will-O-Wisp immediately cripples physical attackers and Ground-types, while Air Slash wears down switch-ins immediately and 2HKOes the aforementioned Ground-types if they are weakened enough. However, being locked into Will-O-Wisp invites in offensive Pokemon such as Combusken, Komala, and Silvally-Dragon, which forces Rotom-S out and loses momentum in the process. Similarly, being locked into Air Slash invites in Flying-type switch-ins such as Bronzor and Silvally-Electric, so be mindful of what Rotom-S locks itself into. Once faster threats are removed and Rotom-S no longer needs to act as a revenge killer, Trick should be used to cripple switch-ins such as defensive Golem, Lickilicky, and Bronzor that Rotom-S cannot hurt otherwise. If Rotom-S needs its Choice Scarf for faster threats, avoid using Trick to cripple those Pokemon and double switch to a teammate instead. Against more defensive teams where Rotom-S's Speed is less valuable, Trick should be used early on to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Wish Komala, Altaria, and Dusclops.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-S is an excellent pivot and check to offensive Pokemon such as Simisage, Pinsir, and Swanna, so Pokemon that appreciate them being revenge killed such as Torterra, Beheeyem, and Combusken make for good partners. These Pokemon can also wallbreak and pave way for a late-game cleanup for Rotom-S. Grass-, Water-, and Ground-types pair well with Rotom-S, as they check Ground- and Electric-types, which helps Rotom-S use Volt Switch freely. Grass- and Water-types such as Exeggutor, Torterra, Simipour, and Floatzel beat common Ground-types, while Pokemon such as Golem, Marowak, and Silvally-Ground pair well with Rotom-S because they can check Electric-types such as Electivire, Raichu, and Silvally-Electric. Rotom-S is slower than common Choice Scarf users such as Electivire and Silvally and loses its ability to revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Simipour and Leafeon after using Trick. Because of this, pair Rotom-S with Pokemon such as Golem, Choice Band Furfrou, and Kadabra that can check those Pokemon. Entry hazard removers such as Sandslash, Silvally-Fighting, and Silvally-Water help keep Rotom-S healthy and able to pivot around by removing Stealth Rock. The latter two also form a VoltTurn core alongside Rotom-S.</p>"

  "Servine": {
    "overview": "<p>Servine stands out as a Defogger in the metagame because it handily deals with entry hazard setters such as Golem, Torterra, and Smeargle. Unlike Silvally-Grass, Servine has access to Synthesis, which helps it reliably check the aforementioned entry hazard setters. Moreover, Servine separates itself from other bulky Grass-type Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL, Shiinotic, and Silvally-Grass thanks to its decent Speed and ability to set up with Leaf Storm due to Contrary. However, Servine faces significant competition from these Grass-type Pokemon because they are bulkier and do not rely on Eviolite. In comparison to them, Servine is a shakier switch-in to attackers such as Marowak, Simipour, and Leafeon because of its lower bulk and inability to switch into Knock Off. Moreover, Grass-types such as Exeggutor and Simisage outclass Servine offensively. Exeggutor has superior breaking power and is part Psychic type, which makes it more difficult to switch into, while Simisage is a significantly better attacker because of its great offensive stats, fantastic coverage moves, and ability to run mixed and special sets. Conversely, Servine is much easier to wall because of its low Special Attack and lack of coverage options. A reliance on Hidden Power for coverage exacerbates the latter flaw because it means Servine must choose between being able to beat either Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon such as Silvally-Dragon, Altaria, and Toucannon with Hidden Power Ice or Steel-type Pokemon such as Bronzor and Metang with Hidden Power Fire. In addition, Sap Sipper users such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck take advantage of the use of Leaf Storm and wall Servine. Similarly, the abundance of fast Grass-type checks in the metagame such as Rapidash, Rotom-S, and Pinsir leaves Servine heavily pressured.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove items such as Eviolite and Leftovers, thus crippling defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor, Mareanie, and Mawile. Although Glare is usually inferior to any other coverage or utility move, it may be used on teams that want Servine to provide both entry hazard removal and speed control. Glare also helps Servine cripple Grass-type switch-ins such as Sap Sipper Bouffalant and Sawsbuck, Muk, Silvally-Poison, and Silvally-Dragon. Aromatherapy can be used over Hidden Power to support Servine's teammates as well as to increase Servine's longevity in tandem with Synthesis. However, using Aromatherapy over Hidden Power makes Servine much more exploitable and further limits its offensive capabilities, especially against Pokemon such as Altaria, Gourgeist-XL, and Bronzor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Combusken, Rapidash, and Simisear all threaten Servine with their STAB moves. Combusken, in particular, is worth mentioning due to its ability Speed Boost, which allows it to use Servine as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Swanna, Chatot, Rotom-S, and Altaria are all prevalent Flying-types that beat Servine. While Swanna and Chatot cannot directly switch into Servine, they can revenge kill it. Conversely, Rotom-S and Altaria can pivot into Servine's Leaf Storm, but must be careful of Hidden Power Ice. Moreover, Rotom-S lacks reliable recovery and is prone to being worn down, and while Altaria has reliable recovery in Roost, it is much more passive and 4x weak to Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Sap Sipper Users</strong>: Pokemon that carry the ability Sap Sipper such as Bouffalant, Sawsbuck, and Zebstrika can all easily check Servine. In particular, Bouffalant and Sawsbuck appreciate getting an Attack boost from Leaf Storm and can set up with Substitute or Swords Dance against Servine.</p>",

      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While Defog is the preferred utility move, Taunt is an option to heavily pressure defensive Pokemon such as Pyukumuku, Cradily, and Dusclops and prevent Pokemon such as Mareanie and Bronzor from setting entry hazards. Synthesis helps Servine maintain its longevity, allowing it to maintain its role as an offensive support Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice hits Flying- and Grass-types such as Altaria and Shiinotic that would otherwise wall Servine. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire allows Servine to hit Grass-types as well as prevalent Steel-types such as Metang, Pawniard, and Bronzor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment is necessary to make the best use of Servine's bulk, while maximum Speed investment ensures that Servine outspeeds Pokemon such as Lycanroc-N and Modest Golduck.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Servine can handle a majority of ZU's entry hazard setters such as Golem and Torterra. Because of this, Servine should make it a priority to remove the Stealth Rock they set. It's important to conserve Leaf Storm's limited PP until Pokemon such as Bouffalant, Bronzor, and Muk have been dealt with. Once faster Grass-type checks have been taken care of, Servine should spam Leaf Storm to continually boost its Special Attack and sweep. Similarly, after a Leaf Storm or two, Servine can usually muscle past slower Grass-type switch-ins such as Gourgeist-XL, Altaria, Pawniard, and Mawile with the appropriate coverage move. Servine should avoid becoming crippled by Toxic from Pokemon such as Golem, Sandslash, Mawile, and Bronzor or moves like Knock Off, Switcheroo, and Trick from Pokemon like Kecleon, Floatzel, and Mr. Mime. Similarly, Servine should watch out for entry hazard setters such as Sandslash, Mawile, and Marowak because they can potentially use Knock Off to remove its Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Servine appreciates Pokemon such as physical Swanna, Expert Belt Electivire, Golem, and Granbull that can break through Grass-type checks such as Muk and Bouffalant. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Golem, Mawile, and Crustle helps wear down Pokemon that threaten Servine such as Rapidash, Swanna, and Rotom-S. It's also worth noting that Servine can punish opposing Defog users thanks to Contrary. Pokemon such as Simisear, Electivire, and Choice Band Golem appreciate Servine's ability to remove entry hazards and to check most Water- and Ground-types. Pokemon that can absorb Knock Off, such as Silvally formes like Silvally-Water and Silvally-Dragon and Pokemon that carry Z-Crystals like Poliwrath, Leafeon, and Swanna, tend to make for good partners. Bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath, Mareanie, and Pyukumuku pair well with Servine, as they're able to take advantage of opposing Fire-types that threaten Servine such as Rapidash, Combusken, and Simisear. Conversely, Servine checks Electric-types such as Raichu and Choice Scarf Electivire for them.</p>"

  "Simisage": {
    "overview": "<p>Simisage is an extremely effective breaker thanks to its expansive movepool and excellent offensive stats. Little can switch into Simisage because of its fantastic coverage and ability to act as a mixed attacker with Leaf Storm and Superpower or setup sweeper with Nasty Plot. In addition to being able to threaten most of the metagame, Simisage is able to play around usual Grass-type checks such as Gourgeist-XL, Altaria, and Bouffalant because of its high attacking stats and powerful coverage moves. Moreover, Nasty Plot makes Simisage one of the best stallbreakers in the metagame, allowing it to overwhelm walls such as Lickilicky, Dusclops, and Gourgeist-XL. However, a pure Grass typing and mediocre bulk make it difficult for Simisage to find opportunities to switch in, and it is weak to revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Electivire, Rapidash, and Choice Scarf Swanna. This is exacerbated by Life Orb recoil, which in tandem with its entry hazard vulnerability makes Simisage easy to wear down. While Simisage is a fast Grass-type that hits hard, it faces competition from other offensive Grass-types such as Servine and Leafeon, which are bulkier and offer more utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On the mixed attacker set, a spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpA / 252 Spe with Gunk Shot or Rock Slide over Hidden Power Ice can be used to take advantage of Simisage's ability to break down Leaf Storm switch-ins such as Shiinotic and Rapidash. While this is generally inferior and limits Simisage's ability to spam Leaf Storm, it is useful on teams that appreciate Simisage's ability to bait in the aforementioned Pokemon and KO them. A Choice Scarf set can be used with Leaf Storm, Rock Slide, Gunk Shot, and Superpower to make Simisage a scary revenge killer. However, this heavily limits Simisage and forces it to forego its niche as a wallbreaker that can switch up coverage moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Muk and Silvally-Poison shut down Simisage and threaten it out. Muk counters Simisage thanks to its natural bulk and Rest, but Silvally-Poison is prone to being worn down over the course of a game.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Simisage has varying defensive counterplay depending on its set. Pokemon such as Metang, Mawile, Bouffalant, and Altaria can pivot into Simisage's mixed attacker set but must be careful of coverage moves. Against its Nasty Plot set, Pokemon such as Bronzor, Dusclops, and Assault Vest Kecleon can reliably take on Simisage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Rapidash, Choice Scarf Rotom-S, and Choice Scarf Electivire outspeed and OHKO Simisage despite its solid Speed tier.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Simisage loses health quickly because of Life Orb recoil and all the damage it takes from entry hazards. This makes Simisage susceptible to revenge killers and priority users such as Floatzel, Kecleon, and Pawniard.</p>",

      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hidden Power Ice hits Leaf Storm switch-ins such as Rotom-S, Altaria, and Silvally-Dragon. Knock Off gives Simisage great utility as a mixed attacker, allowing it to break down bulky Pokemon such as Bronzor and Dusclops. Superpower rounds out Simisage's coverage, enabling it to OHKO weakened Normal-types such as Bouffalant, Sawsbuck, and Lickilicky.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment is used over full Attack investment to ensure Simisage can wallbreak with Leaf Storm and 2HKO switch-ins such as Rotom-S with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Because Simisage lacks opportunities to switch in, it should be brought off pivots and aggressive double switches. Subsequently, bring Simisage in against Pokemon it can revenge kill with Leaf Storm such as Marowak, Silvally-Water, and Swanna. Against switch-ins that have recovery, a Grass-type immunity, or a 4x resistance to Leaf Storm such as Muk, Bouffalant, and Altaria, Simisage should double switch to a teammate or nail them with the right coverage move. Conversely, against frailer switch-ins and switch-ins that lack recovery such as Pinsir, Combusken, and Silvally-Dragon, Simisage should usually spam Leaf Storm and heavily chip them down. However, Simisage needs to be wary of the Special Attack drops from Leaf Storm, which make it much easier to switch into and render it as setup fodder for Pokemon such as Shell Smash Crustle and Swords Dance Leafeon. In addition, Simisage needs to be careful of the opponent switching around its coverage moves and STAB attacks in order to stall it out with Life Orb recoil or fish for the Special Attack drop.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Ground- and Water-types gone such as Choice Scarf Electivire and Swords Dance Combusken pair well with Simisage. In return, Choice Scarf Electivire checks faster threats such as Rapidash and Jumpluff and has Volt Switch to bring Simisage in safely, while Combusken checks Grass- and Steel-types such as Bellossom and Metang. Because Simisage lacks good opportunities to switch in, pivots such as Rotom-S, Silvally-Dragon, and Choice Band Furfrou pair well with it. Moreover, Rotom-S covers Flying-types that threaten Simisage, Silvally-Dragon is able to check Fire-types, and Choice Band Furfrou checks Pokemon with faster physical attackers such as Floatzel, Choice Scarf Silvally, and Pinsir. Simisage also pairs well with setup sweepers such as Z-Rain Dance Swanna and Shell Smash Crustle that take advantage of Simisage's ability to break down Pokemon such as Bouffalant, Dusclops, and Rotom-S. Entry hazard setters such as Golem and Bronzor help Simisage secure KOs against Pokemon such as Glaceon, Altaria, and offensive Torterra. Conversely, Defoggers and spinners such as Silvally-Water, Swanna, and Sandslash help keep Simisage healthy by removing entry hazards.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Energy Ball provides Simisage with more breaking power, allowing it to 2HKO bulky Pokemon such as Dusclops and specially defensive Komala, but it makes Simisage much easier to wear down. Focus Blast nails Pokemon such as Bouffalant, Lickilicky, and Mawile that could switch into Giga Drain and Hidden Power Ice. Hidden Power Ice is necessary, as it allows Simisage to break through Grass-type switch-ins such as Altaria, Gourgeist-XL, and Toucannon after a Nasty Plot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fightinium Z is preferred over Life Orb to ensure Simisage can break past Bouffalant and Lickilicky without risking a Focus Blast miss and does not wear down Simisage unlike Life Orb. However, Life Orb gives Simisage greater breaking power and secures more OHKOs after a Nasty Plot, such as on Gourgeist-XL and specially defensive Torterra with Hidden Power Ice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Simisage should set up off forced switches against Pokemon such as Golem, Torterra, and Basculin or against passive Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Mareanie because it tends to lack setup opportunities otherwise. Simisage should be brought in off pivots, through double switches, or after a teammate faints, since it tends to lack good opportunities to switch in. Nasty Plot is comparatively easier to switch into than mixed attacker sets, so it is vital to analyze the opponent's team and formulate a plan accordingly. Against slower, more defensive teams, Simisage can usually sweep late-game, but against faster teams, where Simisage lacks setup opportunities, it is best used as an early-game breaker. Make sure counters such as Muk, Bronzor, and Silvally-Poison are gone to ensure Simisage can sweep. Once these Pokemon are removed, Simisage can usually sweep through stall teams after a Nasty Plot because of its amazing coverage and ability to stay healthy by attacking foes with +2 Giga Drain. Revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Electivire, Rapidash, and Choice Band Furfrou and priority users such as Kecleon should also be eliminated so that Simisage can sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-type switch-ins such as Bronzor, Muk, and Silvally-Poison wall Nasty Plot Simisage, so partners that can weaken these Pokemon such as Mareanie, Swanna, and Monferno pair well with Simisage. Mareanie is able to remove Bronzor's Eviolite with Knock Off, Swanna is able to weaken Muk and Silvally-Poison with Scald, and Monferno is able to heavily weaken all these Pokemon with STAB Flare Blitz. Electric-types such as Electivire, Rotom-S, and Silvally-Electric support Simisage by checking Flying-types such as Toucannon, Jumpluff, and Choice Scarf Swanna that threaten it. In particular, Simisage can break down walls for Choice Scarf Electivire and pave way for a late-game sweep. Entry hazard setters such as Golem, Marowak, and Bronzor provide crucial Stealth Rock support for Simisage, enabling it to pick up KOs against Lickilicky and Altaria after setting up. Golem and Bronzor both provide good defensive support as well, with the former checking Fire- and Bug-types such as Rapidash and Pinsir and the latter checking Ice- and Normal-types such as Glaceon and Choice Scarf Silvally. Mareanie is another entry hazard setter that pairs exceptionally well with Simisage because Toxic Spikes make it easier for Simisage to break down specially bulky Pokemon such as Dusclops, Lickilicky, and Assault Vest Kecleon due to the constant chip damage. Entry hazard removers such as Swanna, Silvally-Ground, and Silvally-Dragon are crucial for Simisage, as keeping it healthy is vital for a late-game sweep, particularly when running Life Orb.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Simisear is one of the best setup stallbreakers the tier has to offer due to its high Special Attack and Speed, fantastic coverage options, and ability to shut down passive foes such as Pyukumuku and Gourgeist- with Taunt; furthermore, it can also function as a fast late-game setup sweeper. Simisear is able to generate free turns for it to set up with Nasty Plot, and afterwards, not even Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Altaria and Silvally-Water appreciate switching into it. However, setting up with Simisear can be quite difficult due to its poor defensive typing, lackluster bulk, and susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock. In addition, Simisear, while still quite fast, is outsped by a multitude of Pokemon such as Zebstrika, Floatzel, Purugly, and nearly every relevant Choice Scarf user. Lastly, Simisear mandates team support such as entry hazard removal and switch-ins into offensive Water- and Dragon-types, which limits teambuilding even more considering Simisear is only able to fit on balance and offensive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Salac Berry can be utilized in combination with Gluttony to attempt to reap the benefits of a standard Nasty Plot Simisear and an additional Speed boost. Simisear is weak to Stealth Rock and does not necessitate the use of Substitute necessarily as much, giving way for an open moveslot to fill with another coverage move such as Hidden Power Ice. However, Simisear has difficulty both setting up a Nasty Plot while getting itself into Salac Berry activation range, even with factors such as Substitute, Gluttony, and Stealth Rock. This is attributed to Simisear's unimpressive bulk and lack of any notable resistances to help aid its setup. Flamethrower is more accurate and has more PP than Fire Blast. However, Simisear's damage output without Fire Blast is noticeably lower, and in many cases, what would have been OHKOs turn into 2HKOs such as +2 Flamethrower versus Altaria after Stealth Rock. A specially biased mixed set with Superpower acts as an effective lure for bulkier Normal-types such as Lickilicky, Assault Vest Komala, and Kecleon without necessitating a Nasty Plot boost and relying on the inaccurate Focus Blast. However, Life Orb recoil may indicate to the opponent that Simisear is indeed mixed, ruining the surprise factor to some degree. The combination of entry hazard and Life Orb recoil is also not ideal, making a mixed set not worthwhile. Rock Slide may also seem like a decent coverage move on a mixed set, as it gives Simisear a reliable option versus opposing Fire-types and rounds out Simisear's coverage quite well while still hitting Altaria super effectively. However, Rapidash and Choice Scarf Oricorio-F both outspeed Simisear, meaning the coverage Rock Slide actually provides actually only comes in against non-Choice Scarf Oricorio-F and opposing Simisear in Speed ties. Simisear could utilize Z-Sunny Day to boost its Speed and use Solar Beam or just fire off an extremely strong STAB attack. However, this leaves Simisear in a tough position against Fire-types such as Morning Sun Rapidash and Dragon-types such as Silvally-Dragon and the specially bulky Altaria. Solar Beam + Grassium Z gives up the boost in Speed, the effects of sun, and the reliability of its Grass coverage for a one-time Grass-type nuke and the ability to fit Hidden Power Ice. However, such a set still struggles with Fire-types as well as specially bulky Normal-types such as Komala and Lickilicky now that Simisear no longer possesses Firium Z. Choice Scarf Simisear packs a lot of firepower behind it and would be a decent Choice Scarf user. However, it faces immense competition with Simipour and Simisage, which don't possess a weakness to Stealth Rock, as well as Rapidash, which is an even faster Choice Scarf Fire-type option than Simisear.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Altaria and Bulletproof Hakamo-o can, for the most part, safely switch into and wall Simisear. Although Altaria does not want to take a +2 Inferno Overdrive after Stealth Rock, Simisear forcing Altaria into these situations happens less in practice than on paper, and Altaria can just double switch in an attempt to waste Simisear's Z-Move anyway. All Dragon-types should worry about Hidden Power Ice, though.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Floatzel and Choice Scarf Swanna can outspeed Simisear and reliably revenge kill it with their Water-type STAB attacks, whereas other Water-types such as Mareanie and Pyukumuku can utilize Haze or Block + Spite, respectively, if Simisear runs Hidden Power Ice over Taunt or Substitute. Silvally-Water can force Simisear out and take anything besides a +2 Grass Knot or +2 All-Out Pummeling.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Specially defensive walls such as Lickilicky and Carbink take relatively nothing from an unboosted attack and can fire off a Seismic Toss or Rock Slide, respectively. However, Lickilicky in particular dislikes having to stomach a +2 Inferno Overdrive or Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest Users</strong>: Assault Vest users such as Bouffalant and Komala can sponge any of Simisear's attacks and retaliate back with Earthquake. Assault Vest Kecleon is able to stomach a +2 Fire Blast and retaliate back with the combination of Drain Punch and Sucker Punch.</p>",

Fire Blast is Simisear's strongest reliable STAB option, demolishing threats such as Swords Dance Pinsir, Gourgeist-XL, and Metang. Taunt shuts down non-attacking moves from Pokemon such as Pyukumuku, Bronzor, and Dusclops. Substitute shields Simisear from status, as well as potentially generating free turns against Pokemon such as U-turn Silvally formes to set up with Nasty Plot. Hidden Power Ice nails Dragon-types, such as Gabite, Hakamo-o, and most importantly Altaria. Grass Knot is Simisear's best option for certain Water-, Rock-, and Ground-types such Silvally-Water, Golem, and Marowak. Focus Blast is an alternative option for still hitting Rock-types such as Golem and Rampardos while also nailing Normal-types such as non-Choice Scarf Silvally, Regigigas, Komala, and Bouffalant.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is preferred over a Modest one so Simisear can outspeed key threats such as maximum Speed Silvally formes, Swanna, and Leafeon. Blaze can situationally allow Simisear to pick up KOs it wouldn't otherwise be able to achieve. Firium Z turns Fire Blast into an immensely powerful Inferno Overdrive, picking up important KOs such as on Assault Vest Komala and physically defensive Altaria at +2 after Stealth Rock most of the time. Life Orb can be run if one of Simisear's teammates is already utilizing a Z-Crystal of their own. Fightinium Z is a third item option that more reliably helps bring down bulky Normal-types such as Lickilicky while maintaining solid neutral coverage against Water- and Rock-types such as Silvally-Water and Golem without fear of missing.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>From Team Preview and the lead matchup, one should determine whether it is best to use Simisear as a wallbreaker earlier in the game to break down threats that stop its teammate from sweeping or as a sweeper itself. Simisear variants utilizing either Firium Z or Fightinium Z should also evaluate if there are any specific targets they should be reserved for. Not wasting Simisear's all-important Z-Move early is an important factor in breaking or sweeping. If running Substitute, Simisear can purposefully lower its health to bring it within Blaze activation range. However, Simisear should be wary of priority users and faster Pokemon while in range of Blaze, as they can usually knock it out. Simisear's bulk is exceedingly poor, so trading big hits off on the opponent's Pokemon such Assault Vest Bouffalant always becomes a question of risk versus reward, especially earlier in the game when Simisear has a lot of potential to do well later in the game. Sometimes sacrificing Simisear is a great way to pick up momentum back from the game, especially after Simisear has broken down or completely dismantled its intended target. As a setup sweeper that focuses more on late-game, Simisear should always look for opportunities to switch in and safely set up with Nasty Plot, as without at least one boost, Simisear is nowhere near as threatening.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Crustle, Golem, and Mareanie help weaken the opposing team, which allows Simisear to more adequately perform its role of a late-game cleaner. Conversely, entry hazard removers such as Komala, Altaria, and Silvally-Water can Rapid Spin or Defog away Stealth Rock away for Simisear, which otherwise undermines its health and reduces its capabilities to reliably set up with Nasty Plot and clean. Simisear can incinerate Grass-types such as Bellossom and Leafeon early- to mid-game to give ample setup opportunities for another sweeper such as Bulk Up Floatzel. Having teammates to switch into and break down some of the Pokemon Simisear finds hardest to defeat on its own eases pressure off it. Altaria is one of the biggest obstacles for non-Hidden Power Ice variants of Simisear to face, so teammates such as Choice Band Komala and Golem that can defeat Altaria one-on-one make great teammates. Rotom-S can switch into Choice Scarf Swanna, and the previously mentioned Silvally-Water can reliably switch into Floatzel, so both pair nicely with Simisear, as Swanna and Floatzel threaten to take it out with Scald and Liquidation, respectively. Physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Komala and Floatzel can help break down specially defensive walls such as Lickilicky that spell trouble for Simisear. Choice Band Komala in particular is helpful for being able to slow pivot into Simisear, which allows Simisear to switch in safely without having to fear taking a massive hit.</p>"

  "Simipour": {
    "overview": "<p>Simipour is one of the strongest special wallbreakers in ZU, with high Special Attack, a great Speed tier, and access to Nasty Plot. Backing this up is a good movepool, with an incredibly strong STAB move in Hydro Pump and great coverage moves like Ice Beam and Focus Blast. However, Simipour's power is offset by poor bulk, leaving it easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Sawsbuck and Electivire. In addition, Simipour is generally outclassed as a Water-type wallbreaker by Floatzel; despite the fact that Simipour does have a higher Special Attack stat and access to Nasty Plot, Floatzel has higher Speed and can run Taunt more reliably compared to how unreliably Simipour can set up Substitute. Simipour also struggles with bulky Water-types, namely Silvally-Water and Mareanie, because it doesn't have the tools to deal heavy damage to them, even with Nasty Plot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Life Orb set running Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, Knock Off, and Superpower with a 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe spread and a Naive nature can be used for a power boost without having to waste a turn, and the physical coverage makes Simipour's matchup against things like Lickilicky and Misdreavus better, thanks to having physical coverage; however, the Nasty Plot set is generally preferred because it doesn't put Simipour on a timer and Nasty Plot gives a bigger boost than Life Orb. In addition, Life Orb's recoil makes Simipour easier to revenge kill, and mixed variants still suffer competition from Floatzel. Grass Knot can be run for alternative coverage, hitting foes like Silvally-Water, but this comes with the cost of either being walled by threats like Regice or having a harder time setting up. Taunt can be used to improve Simipour's matchup against stall, rendering answers like Bronzor and Pyukumuku worthless, but this hinders Simipour's matchup against offensive teams. If you choose to run Focus Blast, Fightinium Z can be run to OHKO Lickilicky without Stealth Rock, but Hydro Vortex provides more valuable OHKOes, and Hydro Vortex already OHKOs Lickilicky after Stealth Rock anyway. Hyper Beam with Normalium Z can be run to break bulky Water-types like Silvally-Water, but it's missing out on valuable OHKOs that Hydro Vortex provides, in addition to that, a +2 Hydro Vortex followed by Hydro Pump KOes most of the foes you would use Hyper Beam for, like Silvally-Water and Mareanie. Scald can be used over Hydro Pump for added accuracy and a shot at a burn, but it's much weaker, hindering Simipour's wallbreaking abilities. Salac Berry and Gluttony can be run with Substitute to make Simipour harder to revenge kill, but Simipour misses the one-time nuke that Waterium Z provides.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Choice Scarf Chatot, Choice Scarf Electivire, and Simisage can easily KO Simipour thanks to their power and Simipour's lack of bulk.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Bellossom and Servine can tank an unboosted Ice Beam and threaten to KO back, or they can pivot into Hydro Pump, although none of them can safely switch into +2 Simipour because a boosted coverage move deals with all of them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pyukumuku can stall Hydro Pump's PP by repeatedly switching in, but it's shut down by Substitute if Simipour decides to run it. Mareanie and Silvally-Water, while they are 2HKOed by +2 Hydro Pump, can easily threaten Simipour back with Haze and Thunderbolt, respectively. Finally, Lapras walls non-Focus Blast variants of Simipour and can fire back with either Freeze Dry or Perish Song and Whirlpool.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is the set's main coverage move, hitting Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Dragon-types like Silvally-Dragon and Altaria. Substitute, when used on a forced switch, can allow Simipour to safely set up or start breaking if it already is set up, preventing it from taking damage the next turn. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be run for added coverage, allowing Simipour to hit Normal- and Ice-types like Lickilicky, Komala, and Regice super-effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Waterium Z combined with Hydro Pump is incredibly strong, giving Simipour a one-time nuke; at +2, it can OHKO foes like Mareanie, Bronzor, specially defensive Komala, and Lickilicky, (the latter only after Stealth Rock), though you do need to win the mind game of Protect with Komala and Lickilicky. Using Substitute until Simipour is at Torrent range also gives Hydro Pump some additional power. +2 Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump can OHKO Pokemon like Lickilicky, Mareanie, and Komala after Stealth Rock, as well as 2HKO Pyukumuku.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It's best to bring in Simipour through either pivots or double switches, to make sure that it takes as little damage as possible so it can set up safely. Setting up should be done on a predicted switch or when Substitute is up so it can wallbreak safely. However, unless there's a clean sweeping path ahead, it's best to wait to set up so you don't have to switch out, and lose the boost from Nasty Plot. Also, using Substitute to get into Torrent range to get some extra power out of Hydro Pump to break more effectively isn't a bad idea. In addition, thanks to Simipour's high Speed stat, it can be used to revenge kill Pokemon without setting up Nasty Plot. Finally, be careful of Protect when using Hydro Vortex. Some notable users of Protect include Komala and Lickilicky. Substitute can be used to scout for Protect, though.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Simipour wants to avoid chip damage for safer setup and wallbreaking, a hazard remover like Rotom-F or Silvally-Dragon is highly appreciated. Similarly, hazard setters like Metang or Gabite are good partners for getting chip damage, allowing Simipour to KO foes more easily. Something that can switch into or beat its checks is also greatly appreciated. For example, Golem, Gourgeist-XL, and Silvally-Ground can switch into Electivire. Other great partners for Simipour are Pokemon that appreciate its wallbreaking abilities. Examples include Choice Scarf Chatot (for breaking Bronzor) and Monferno (for breaking Swanna). Finally, a slow pivot, such as Komala or Toucannon, that can get Simipour in more safely is appreciated.</p>"

  "Zebstrika": {
    "overview": "<p>Zebstrika distinguishes itself from the other Electric-types of the tier like Electivire and Raichu thanks to its high Speed. This lets it naturally outspeed a lot of threats to offensive teams such as Floatzel, Purugly, and slow Choice Scarf users like Rampardos that non-Choice Scarf Electivire and Raichu fail to outspeed. Furthermore, Zebstrika has two great abilities in Lightning Rod and Sap Sipper that give it immunities to Electric- or Grass-type moves,  which are common attacking types in ZU. However, although Zebstrika has excellent Speed, its Special Attack is lackluster, leaving it easily walled by tier staples such as Komala, Muk, and Lickilicky. Moreover, Zebstrika is extremely frail, making it easy for faster Pokemon such as Dugtrio and Choice Scarf Silvally to take it out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zebstrika has a good base 100 Attack stat that it may want to use in a physical or mixed set. However, its physical movepool is lackluster and leaves it helpless against Grass-, Ground-, and Dragon-types, as it only has access to weak moves, the unusable Bounce, the niche Low Kick, and miscellaneous Normal-type coverage. Moreover, these sets face heavy competition from Electivire, which while being slower, hits far harder thanks to a higher base Attack and access to better coverage moves in Ice Punch and Earthquake. Zebstrika can hold Firium Z to get a strong Fire-type nuke without incurring Overheat's drawback. However, using it over Life Orb significantly weakens Zebstrika's firepower and is therefore not recommended. Zebstrika can wield Choice Specs to deal more significant damage, but loses its ability to switch moves for better longevity that it doesn't need. Being locked into an Electric-type move is detrimental, as it gives dangerous wallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Raichu opportunities to switch in and lets defensive Ground-types such as Golem and Sandslash set or remove entry hazards. Hidden Power Water is an option over Hidden Power Ice to hit Camerupt and Golem harder. However, Golem is already hit hard by Hidden Power Ice. Moreover, it leaves Zebstrika helpless against Dragon-types such as Gabite and Silvally-Dragon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Golem, Sandslash, and Silvally-Ground are immune to Zebstrika's STAB moves, can take Hidden Power Ice, and can take Zebstrika out with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Because of its low Special Attack, Zebstrika struggles to break through specially bulky Pokemon such as Lickilicky and Kecleon. They can wear it down while also keeping themselves at good health. In addition, some of them such as Komala, Muk, and Vigoroth can use Zebstrika as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Zebstrika's low bulk, Pokemon that outspeed it, such as Dugtrio and Choice Scarf Silvally, can KO it if it is weakened.</p> <p><strong>Electric-immune Pokemon</strong>: Abilities such as Motor Drive from Electivire, Lightning Rod from Raichu, and Volt Absorb from Chinchou prevent Zebstrika from spamming its STAB moves. Moreover, the users of the aforementioned abilities can easily take an Overheat from Zebstrika and strike Zebstrika back.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch allows Zebstrika to rack up chip damage on foes such as Kecleon and Probopass and gain momentum against foes that wall it such as Lickilicky and Muk. Overheat destroys Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL and Quilladin, which would otherwise be able to take Zebstrika's hits. Hidden Power Ice hits Ground-types which are immune to Electric such as Golem and Gabite and deals heavier damage to Dragon-types such as Silvally-Dragon and Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the best item for Zebstrika, as it needs a boosting item in order to nab the OHKO on some Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL and Mareanie, and appreciates the ability to switch moves in order to hit Grass- and Ground-types that try to switch into its STAB attacks. Lightning Rod grants Zebstrika an immunity to Electric-type moves, allowing it to block Volt Switch. Lightning Rod is preferred to Motor Drive because Zebstrika is already fast and enjoys getting boosts in Special Attack instead of Speed. Alternatively, Sap Sipper allows Zebstrika to switch into Grass-type attackes from Pokemon such as Servine and Simisage and into powder moves such as Spore from Shiinotic and Smeargle. It also makes Zebstrika a potent switch-in to Jumpluff.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zebstrika's impressive Speed tier allows it to revenge kill a lot of fast threats to offensive teams such as Floatzel and Purugly. Zebstrika should mainly use Volt Switch in order to maintain momentum and rack up chip damage against its checks such as Lickilicky, Kecleon, and Muk. Zebstrika can easily use Volt Switch against Pokemon that it forces out such as Mareanie, Swanna, and Toucannon. However, you must be wary of Pokemon immune to Electric such as Golem and Electivire and think twice before using one of Zebstrika's STAB moves if they can safely switch in. If you predict one of them to switch in, you should utilize one of Zebstrika's coverage moves or pull a double switch. Due to its poor bulk, Zebstrika shouldn't be switched in on any hits or against faster foes. Sap Sipper allows Zebstrika to check many Grass-types in the tier such as Quilladin, Servine, Bellossom, and Jumpluff. However, Zebstrika struggles to come in Leafeon due to its strong coverage moves. Zebstrika should instead come in on a double switch, after a teammate faints, through the help of VoltTurn users, or on a predicted Grass- or Electric-type move such as Leech Seed from Gourgeist or Volt Switch from Electivire depending on Zebstrika's ability. Zebstrika should only use Overheat if it needs to, as the Special Attack drop will leave it setup fodder for a lot of threatening setup sweepers such as Shell Smash Crustle and Swords Dance Combusken.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its offensive nature and lack of bulk, Zebstrika mainly fits on offensive teams. It pairs very well with other VoltTurn users such as the Silvally formes, Komala, and Toucannon that form a VoltTurn core with it to keep up momentum and rack up chip damage on foes. Zebstrika appreciates entry hazard support such as Stealth Rock from Golem, Spikes from Quilladin, and Toxic Spikes from Mareanie, as they weaken its checks and let Zebstrika break through the opposing team more easily. For the same reason, strong physical wallbreakers such as Choice Band Golem and Swords Dance Silvally that can weaken Zebstrika's checks such as Lickilicky and Muk are appreciated, as they allow Zebstrika to clean late-game. Pokemon that appreciate Zebstrika's immunities such as Golem and Swanna make for great partners, as they give it more opportunities to switch in by baiting Grass- and Electric-type attacks, respectively. However, Zebstrika isn't a guaranteed switch-in to Pokemon that carry these attacks because of its extreme frailty and weakness to common coverage moves such as Earthquake from Electivire, Knock Off from Leafeon, and Double-Edge from Sawsbuck and Leafeon. Zebstrika is also a potent option for teams that need a non-Choice Scarf revenge killer for fast Pokemon such as Floatzel and Purugly. It provides offensive teams with a Pokemon that is able to outspeed a wide portion of the metagame without being Choice-locked, and is therefore useful for offensive teams that don't want to have two Choice Scarf users.</p>"

  "Swoobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Swoobat is a unique and potentially devastating sweeper that uses its amazing ability Simple as well as its access to Calm Mind and Stored Power to become a dangerous threat. A great Speed tier allows it to get the jump on much of the unboosted metagame, and in conjunction with Salac Berry and Simple, it enables it to outrun every switch-in in the tier. Swoobat's defensive typing and bulk are nothing to write home about, but its 4x resistance to Fighting and a Ground immunity can give it some setup opportunities against certain threats such as Silvally-Fighting and defensive Poliwrath as well as Torterra and Electivire Choice-locked into Earthquake. Unfortunately, Swoobat's Special Attack is poor until it picks up a Calm Mind, which can be a tall task thanks to its bad defenses and defensive typing. Said defensive typing leaves it open to common Dark-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks from Silvally-Dark, Glaceon, and Electivire. Swoobat's poor bulk and reliance on getting to low health to activate Salac Berry also mean that priority attacks from Pokemon such as Kecleon and Swanna are a huge problem for it. Swoobat is also very predictable, so a smart player can see what is coming and react accordingly by keeping one answer for it alive. Swoobat's hit-or-miss nature means that it only gets one shot to sweep, so all answers for it must be dealt with before it even attempts to set up. As a result, Swoobat needs significant support from its team if it is to sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic is an option that gives Swoobat a more immediate offensive presence that doesn't require boosting to actually become a decent move, but the drop in power is extremely noticeable once Swoobat sets up. Air Slash can be used as a STAB move that hits some neutral targets like Silvally-Dark and Beheeyem harder, but the coverage is overall very redundant, and being walled by Bronzor is not preferable. Roost can give Swoobat multiple tries to set up and give it some form of longevity. Kee Berry is another option on such a set to turn Swoobat into a more bulk-focused setup sweeper. Unfortunately, Swoobat's coverage isn't fantastic as it is, and constricting it even more is generally not a wise choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Silvally-Dark and Pawniard pose huge problems for Swoobat, as they threaten it with their STAB moves and are immune to Stored Power. Silvally-Dark does not come close to dropping to a +2 Heat Wave and dispatches Swoobat as long as it isn't behind a Substitute. Pawniard can't take a Heat Wave, but it does revenge kill Swoobat with Sucker Punch. The rare Zweilous serves as the hardest Swoobat counter available, as it takes little damage even from Heat Wave and retaliates with a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that resist Psychic pose problems for Swoobat, as most of them are not taken out by Heat Wave if they aren't weak to it. Bronzor can take even a boosted Heat Wave and chip Swoobat with Psywave. Metang threatens Swoobat with its attacks as well, and Choice Specs Beheeyem can take a Stored Power if Swoobat is only at +2 and crush it with Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pivots</strong>: Offensive pivots such as Komala, Electivire, Rotom-S, and Silvally-Ground can break Swoobat's Substitute with U-turn or Volt Switch and bring in a wall that can take Swoobat's hits or a Choice Scarf user that can revenge kill it if it hasn't eaten its Salac Berry yet. None of these are adequate checks once Swoobat has accrued its boosts, however.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority is a big problem for Swoobat, as it needs to be at low health for Salac Berry to activate and has pitiful bulk. Swanna, Pawniard, Purugly, Kecleon, and Golem are common Pokemon that can carry a threatening priority move. Purugly and Golem must rely on Sucker Punch, however, which can be disastrous if they predict incorrectly due to Swoobat always running Substitute and Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Constant Offensive Pressure</strong>: Swoobat's bad bulk and reliance on setting up to do damage mean that just pressuring it, especially with physical attacks, is a good way to shut it down completely and prevent it from safely setting up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute allows Swoobat to set up on Pokemon Choice-locked into moves that can't break its Substitute or passive Pokemon attempting to afflict it with status conditions. The Choice-locked Pokemon can include Golem, Electivire, and Torterra locked into Earthquake, while passive Pokemon that are vulnerable to Swoobat include Pyukumuku, Bronzor, and Dusclops. Stored Power becomes extremely powerful if Swoobat accrues all the boosts it is aiming to; it reaches 140 Base Power after one Calm Mind and the Salac Berry boost. Heat Wave provides the best coverage alongside Stored Power, as it hits most of the tier's Psychic-resistant Pokemon neutrally and notably hits Bronzor, Pawniard, and Metang super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Salac Berry gives Swoobat +2 to its Speed thanks to Simple, making it extremely fast and juicing up Stored Power even more. 4 HP EVs allow Swoobat to get into range of its Salac Berry after three uses of Substitute from full health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swoobat is a very all-or-nothing sweeper; it usually only gets one chance to sweep, and it will achieve very little if the field is not prepared for it. Therefore, heavily weakening or removing checks and counters like Silvally-Dark and Pawniard is highly recommended before sending out Swoobat. Attempt to use Swoobat as a mid-game wallbreaker if a sweep looks unlikely. Using it mid-game can also bait out checks like Kecleon and Silvally-Dark that can be capitalized on by its teammates if you switch intelligently. Deciding when to use Calm Mind or Substitute is key to using Swoobat properly. Calm Mind can be used in the face of some of the tier's weaker special attackers and against slower special attackers that don't run coverage for Swoobat. These can include Servine, Exeggutor, and special Combusken, but you should keep in mind that directly switching into these threats is out of the question. Substitute, on the other hand, can be used on passive Pokemon such as Altaria, Pyukumuku, and Mareanie. Swoobat will often find itself behind a Substitute and unboosted while a faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Electivire or Choice Scarf Rotom-S is in front of it. If this is the case, continuously use Substitute on the anticipated attacks to get Swoobat into Salac Berry range while behind a Substitute. While Swoobat is pretty weak without a boost, it can use its Speed stat to revenge kill certain weakened threats such as Leafeon, Mawile, and Simisage in an emergency.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swoobat fits best on hyper offense teams that can wear down the opposition for Swoobat and get it in. Dual screens support is very useful for Swoobat, as the damage reduction gives it many more opportunities to set up and actually allows it to make use of its resistances to an extent. Electrode is a standout option, as it can also get Swoobat in safely via Volt Switch. Other hyper offense staples make for good teammates for Swoobat. Dugtrio, Golem, and Crustle are all good leads; Dugtrio and Golem can potentially give Swoobat a free switch via Memento and Explosion, although this usually won't happen, as Swoobat is usually not seen early-game and these Pokemon are almost always dispatched within the first few turns. Crustle can also set Spikes, chipping down Swoobat's checks even more. Hyper offense sweepers include Rock Polish Torterra, Combusken, and Swords Dance Bibarel. These can help Swoobat out by breaking down checks like Bronzor, Silvally-Dark, and Kecleon, therefore allowing Swoobat to clean up easily. Swoobat can also potentially break down the opposing team early-game by getting rid of Silvally-Fighting, Gourgeist-XL, and Mareanie for them. Directly switching Swoobat in is not recommended, as it needs to be as healthy as possible to start a sweep and even hard resisted hits will do a ton of damage to it. Pivoting it in via U-turn or Volt Switch from the likes of Electrode and Silvally is a good idea. Bringing it in after Dugtrio's Memento or after one of your Pokemon has fainted is another way to do this.</p>"

  "Crustle": {
    "overview": "<p>Crustle's access to the combination of Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Shell Smash along with its good Attack and two useful abilities allows it to function as both a Shell Smash sweeper and a suicide lead. Shell Smash turns Crustle into a offensive threat, as it can boost its already decent attack to very high levels while also allowing it to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame. In addition, Crustle's naturally high Defense allows it to set up on tier staples such as Komala, Bouffalant, and Muk. STAB Stone Edge and X-Scissor along with options such as Earthquake and Knock Off allow Crustle to hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage. Crustle's access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock along with its two best abilities in Sturdy and Weak Armor allow lead sets to often get up multiple layers of entry hazards. Unfortunately, Crustle's impressive physical bulk is somewhat offset by a vulnerability to all entry hazards, as well as by its poor defensive typing and Special Defense. Thus, Crustle is not as bulky in practice as it may seem, and it struggles to set up if offensive threats such as Golem, Swanna, and Pawniard are present. Crustle also struggles with a mediocre Speed stat, as it is quite slow unboosted and will still be outrun by the tier's most common Choice Scarf users, such as Electivire, Rapidash, Swanna, and Mr. Mime even at +2, although it can generally tank a hit if they lack super effective coverage. The lead set also fails to threaten several of the tier's most common entry hazard removers, and Pokemon such as Silvally-Water and Sandslash can come in without much trouble and remove its entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rock Tomb can be used on the lead set in order to slow down the opposing lead and potentially make it very easy for the next Pokemon in line to do its job. However, this is generally inferior to the options provided. Crustle can use Shell Smash and Stealth Rock on the same set if role compression is needed. This particular set has the added benefit of working as both a lead and a sweeper, and using Stealth Rock to bluff an entry hazard set before boosting with Shell Smash can put the opponent into an extremely uncomfortable situation. This set also has the added benefit of greatly threatening some of the tier's most common Defoggers, such as Swanna and Altaria. However, this set lacks Spikes, making it a somewhat inferior lead to Golem, and as a sweeper it will lack the coverage needed to sweep many teams. Substitute can also be used on Shell Smash Crustle to set up on certain threats it would otherwise be hesitant to take on, such as Gourgeist and Bronzor, as well as giving it insurance against Sucker Punch users such as Pawniard. However, the aforementioned coverage issues hold this option back a bit. An EV spread of 248 HP / 216 Def / 44 Spe  with Leftovers or Iapapa Berry turns Crustle into a decently bulky defensive wall capable of setting hazards for the team. While this uses the same set as the suicide lead, the gameplan changes to wanting to keep Crustle alive, as it can come in multiple times per game to set hazards against teams; however, often you only need to set hazards once for teams to function. Using Rock Wrecker with Rockium Z is an option to give Crustle a monstrously powerful Continental Crush and allow it to land a guaranteed OHKO onto Gourgeist-XL without Stealth Rock, something the other sets are incapable of doing. However, Rock Wrecker’s downsides outside of the Z-Move make Stone Edge a generally better option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Many Water-types have a surplus of ways to deal with Crustle, exploiting its pathetic special bulk to quickly KO it with moves such as Silvally-Water's Surf, Swanna's Scald, and Floatzel's Hydro Pump. Silvally-Water and Swanna can also proceed to Defog away any hazards that Crustle puts down. However, they must be mindful of Sturdy, since if Crustle is at full health, they will not be able to OHKO it. In addition, none of them can safely switch into a set up Shell Smash variant, and Swanna and Floatzel have to be cautious of switching in even if Crustle hasn't set up.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers that are faster than Crustle such as Kadabra and Exeggutor as well as certain specially based Choice Scarf users such as Swanna, Floatzel, and Mr. Mime can come in on Crustle, sometimes even after a Shell Smash, and proceed to obliterate it due to its putrid Special Defense stat. None of them can safely switch in on Crustle, however.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Many of the tier's physical walls can stop Crustle in its tracks even after a Shell Smash. Physically defensive Machoke does an admirable job of walling Crustle, although it dislikes losing its Eviolite. Gourgeist-XL can burn Crustle and threaten it with Foul Play, but it must watch out for Continental Crush. Physically defensive Golem can tank anything that Crustle throws at it before heavily damaging it with Stone Edge or badly poisoning it. Neither Gourgeist-XL nor Golem can confidently switch in, however.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Electivire, Pinsir, and Rapidash as well as priority users such as Aqua Jet Swanna and Sucker Punch Pawniard can come in on and threaten a set-up Crustle. Most of them will not KO without prior chip damage, however.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers</strong>: Defoggers such as Swanna and Silvally-Water as well as spinners such as Avalugg and Sandslash threaten to remove lead Crustle's hard work, with Silvally-Water and Sandslash even being able to switch into lead Crustle and dispose of its hazards right in its face.</p> <p><strong>Pyukumuku</strong>: Even though it is a Water-type, Pyukumuku gets a special mention, as it can hard counter the Shell Smash set with its amazing bulk and ability in Unaware. It must be somewhat wary of switching into the Rockium Z set, as Continental Crush followed up by a normal Stone Edge will finish it off if entry hazards are up, but outside of that, Pyukumuku completely walls Crustle.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The combination of Stone Edge and Earthquake allows Crustle to hit almost every Pokemon in the tier for at least neutral damage, with one very notable exception in Bronzor, which the last move allows it to hit hard. Knock Off gives Crustle a way to 2HKO all variants of Bronzor, as well as giving Crustle a way to rid the many Eviolite users in the tier of their needed item, with targets including Mareanie, Metang, and Dusclops. X-Scissor is another option that allows Crustle to still hit Bronzor reasonably hard while also allowing it to hit bulkier Grass-types such as Quilladin and Leafeon for super effective damage. However, this option loses out on the ability to OHKO specially defensive variants of Bronzor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>White Herb allows Crustle to keep its high Defense stat intact after using Shell Smash, which notably allows it to comfortably take a hit from Choice Scarf users such as Electivire and Rapidash as well as common priority users such as Purugly before OHKOing them in return. This also can potentially give Crustle an opportunity to set up Shell Smash again, jacking up both its power and speed to breathtaking levels. Another option is Rockium Z, which gives Crustle a one-time nuke that circumvents Stone Edge's meager accuracy and OHKOes Gourgeist-XL after Stealth Rock damage, a Pokemon that otherwise gives Crustle issues. However, such a set must be played with more caution, as Crustle immediately becomes much more vulnerable to Choice Scarf and priority users. Sturdy is the preferred ability here, as it guarantees that Crustle will be able to set up Shell Smash as long as entry hazards are kept off the field. Using Weak Armor is an option that can potentially make Crustle extremely fast at the cost of some bulk, but the prevalence of priority users such as Pawniard as well as the fact that the White Herb could be used up before Crustle actually uses Shell Smash make this a risky option at best.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shell Smash Crustle is best saved for the mid-or late-game, when it will have an easier time sweeping through teams. It is a good idea to remove at least some of its offensive and defensive checks before sending Crustle out. Defensive checks to watch out for include Gourgeist-XL and Pyukumuku, while offensive ones include potential Choice Scarf users like Electivire and Mr. Mime as well as priority users such as Swanna. Crustle can also operate as an excellent wallbreaker if it is unable to sweep, with defensive Pokemon including Mawile and Bronzor being prime targets. Avoid switching Crustle in directly, as it cannot afford to take much damage if it is aiming to be out of range of the common Choice Scarf threats and priority users. Pivoting Crustle in through a slow U-turn or Volt Switch or after one of your Pokemon has fainted is generally a better option. Removing entry hazards before Crustle comes in is an excellent idea, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and will take damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes as well.  Crustle cannot afford to take much damage before it gets in range of some of the tier's Choice Scarf users and priority users. Crustle should ideally attempt to set up on physical attackers that don't immediately threaten it or foes that it can force out thanks to its decent base Attack that threatens a good amount of the tier. Prime points of entry include Kecleon, Purugly, and Choice Band Komala. Attempting to set up on some of the more passive Pokemon in the tier is an option as well, but Crustle must be extremely careful of status, which most of the passive Pokemon in the tier can spread. As such, setting up against Pokemon such as Gourgeist-XL, Mareanie, and Dusclops should be avoided, as they threaten to burn Crustle. Bulky Water-types are a big problem for Crustle, as most of them will OHKO it if they aren't eliminated or brought into KO range the first turn you see them. A specific mention goes to Pyukumuku, which isn't bothered by what Crustle does and will wall it out. Such Pokemon should absolutely be removed before Crustle attempts to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removal is much appreciated, as Crustle is weak to Stealth Rock and will take hefty damage if it switches in with it on the field. This is especially imperative with the Rockium Z set, as Crustle will be in range of an OHKO from Choice Scarf users such as Pinsir and Rapidash after Stealth Rock damage and the Defense drop. All entry hazards will also break Sturdy. Thus, Defog or Rapid Spin support from teammates such as Swanna, Altaria, Komala, and Sandslash is very helpful. Crustle greatly appreciates entry hazards from teammates such as Quilladin, Mawile, and Bronzor on the opposing side of the field, as they let it more easily punch through the opponent's team.  Crustle is vulnerable to special attackers, so having a way of dealing with them is imperative. Choice Scarf Electivire takes out threats such as Swanna, Kadabra, and Mr. Mime, while Assault Vest Komala can tank many hits from special attackers thanks to its naturally decent bulk before threatening them with its powerful attacks. Ways of crippling or removing Choice Scarf and priority users are very helpful for Crustle, with revenge killing them with your own Choice Scarf users such as Electivire and Pinsir being a good option. Another option is checking them defensively; Sandslash, for example, can tank anything Electivire or Rapidash throws at it before OHKOing them with Earthquake.  In addition to the aforementioned bulky Water-types, Crustle will struggle to break certain physical walls, such as Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL and physically defensive Golem. As such, having a wallbreaker as a teammate is appreciated. Exeggutor, Servine, and Beheeyem are potential options here.</p>"
      },
      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crustle's access to Spikes and Knock Off is largely the only reason to use it over lead Golem. As such, they should absolutely be used on every lead Crustle. Spikes and Stealth Rock combine for a choking entry hazard stack that can wear down opposing teams very quickly, while Knock Off allows Crustle to potentially annoy other leads that appreciate having their item, such as the aforementioned Golem, as well as giving it a good way to fight against Pokemon that rely on Eviolite and Leftovers, such as Bronzor, Mareanie, and Lickilicky. The last move slot is largely filler. Stone Edge is a nice, powerful STAB move that can dissuade some of the tier's most notable Defoggers such as Rotom-S and Swanna from switching into Crustle, while Rock Blast allows Crustle to greatly threaten Focus Sash-reliant Pokemon like Masquerain, Kadabra, and Leavanny while also neutering enemy lead Crustle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Crustle to at worst Speed tie with the ever-present lead Golem, as well as with opposing lead Crustle, while maximum Attack investment allows Crustle to hit as hard as possible. Using Custap Berry with Sturdy allows Crustle to ensure it can almost always get at least Stealth Rock up and one layer of Spikes up before fainting. An alternative to the above set is running Focus Sash along with the ability Weak Armor. This ensures that Crustle will be able to tank a hit at least once while also gaining a large Speed boost if said hit is physical. This also has the added benefit of lowering Crustle's Defense, which is ironically useful in this case, as Crustle's goal is to get out of the way for the next teammate. Ideally this allows Crustle to at least get up Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, but it is inconsistent compared to the other set, as it relies on Crustle facing a physical attacker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crustle should almost always be the lead, unless the opponent has a very obvious Taunt user such as Misdreavus that threatens Crustle's ability to get up entry hazards. It can still be worth it to send Crustle in on certain physically based Taunt users, as the combination of Knock Off and either Stone Edge or Rock Blast is nothing to sneeze at offensively. Crustle should be wary of leading against hazard removers such as Silvally-Fighting, Sandslash, Avalugg, and Silvally-Water, which wall it and are able to cleanly keep its hazards off the field. It should also be somewhat careful of leading off against Golem and opposing Crustle, which oftentimes carry Rock Blast. Crustle can potentially be saved for later if these threats are present so that it can put its hazards up once they have been effectively dealt with. Stealth Rock should generally be used first, as it is the more overall useful entry hazard. The next step should be to set up as many layers of Spikes as possible in order to threaten chip damage on Stealth Rock-resistant Pokemon such as Sandslash, Mawile, and Machoke. Using Knock Off on opposing leads is oftentimes a good option. Lead Golem, for example, greatly relies on its Weakness Policy or its Custap Berry to effectively do its job. This also has the added benefit of breaking Sturdy. This Crustle should only be switched out against hazard removers that is has no way of dealing with, such as Silvally-Water and Sandslash. Outside of those situations it is usually better to let Crustle get KOed and let a more overall useful Pokemon take the reins. Custap Berry allows Crustle to set a hazard while sacrificing itself, which is great for keeping momentum and letting offensive teammates such as Purugly or Pawniard take center stage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lead Crustle works best on hyper offense teams that appreciate multiple layers of entry hazards. Finding a way to beat Defoggers and spinners that threaten to remove all of Crustle's hard work is generally a very good idea. Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly can force Defoggers into a very uncomfortable situation, with Contrary Servine being another option. Spinblocking using Taunt Misdreavus is an option to give insurance against spinners, although finding another way to deal with common spinners is an option as well, such as Fighting-type coverage for taking on Komala and Water- or Grass-type coverage for Sandslash. Many of the tier's offensive threats appreciate the offensive pressure that hazards give, as it makes it harder to switch into them. Combusken, Pinsir, Z-Rain Dance Swanna, and mixed Electivire are all offensive powerhouses that appreciate hazard stacking, as it aids them in their efforts to break down and/or sweep the opposing team.</p>"

  "Swanna": {
    "overview": "<p>Swanna has cemented itself as one of the best offensive Flying-types in the tier due to its great offensive typing. With access to Defog, Swanna becomes undoubtedly the best offensive Defogger ZU has to offer. Because of its typing, Swanna can viably run a variety of different Z-Moves, which makes it hard to check. In addition, Swanna's above-average Speed tier lets it outspeed and threaten the likes of Silvally-Fighting, Combusken, and non-Choice Scarf Pinsir and Leafeon. Unfortunately, Swanna suffers from poor defensive stats, so it must rely on prediction when switching into common entry hazard setters and offensive Pokemon alike, such as Crustle, Pinsir, Kecleon, and Golem. Because of its average offensive stats, Swanna is forced to rely on Hurricane or Z-Moves in order to wallbreak properly. This restricts Swanna's wallbreaking capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf set may be run to outpace other Choice Scarf users like Electivire, Pinsir, and Leafeon, but it's often outclassed by other Choice Scarf users in ZU. Unfortunately, Choice Scarf Swanna loses to Electivire unless the Electivire is significantly weakened. Swanna can utilize a defensive set consisting of 248 HP EVs and 232 Speed EVs with Leftovers to better check Monferno and Combusken.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Raichu, Electivire, and Zebstrika all heavily threaten Swanna due to their STAB Volt Switch. Volt Switch users, in particular, are an issue because they are able to maintain momentum against Swanna's team.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Komala, and Bronzor wall and threaten out Swanna. Moreover, Muk can use Swanna as setup fodder and effectively boost itself. However, all of these Pokemon should be wary of Swanna's Z-Mirror Move set.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Swanna does not appreciate taking much damage due to its poor bulk. Revenge killers that wield a Choice Scarf or have access to priority are often troublesome for Swanna. Some of these Pokemon include Pawniard, Mr. Mime, Chatot, and Kecleon.</p>",

      "Biggest Bird (Offensive Defog)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane and Scald are Swanna’s most effective moves, allowing it to take advantage of its fantastic STAB combination. Roost gives Swanna the ability to restore its health after Life Orb recoil and Stealth Rock damage and allows it to repeatedly check Pokemon such as Floatzel, Silvally-Fighting, and Combusken.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flyinium Z allows Swanna to bypass Hurricane’s low accuracy. Life Orb is used to boost Swanna's damage output; however, the recoil damage is often detrimental when coupled with Stealth Rock damage. Big Pecks allows Swanna to avoid Defense drops, which help Swanna better check Floatzel that use Liquidation.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swanna’s main goal is to act as a wallbreaker, taking advantage of physically defensive walls such as Golem and Gourgeist-XL as well as slower offensive Pokemon such as Leafeon, Silvally-Fighting, and Oricorio-F. Swanna can switch into Pokemon it is able to threaten such as Combusken, Gourgeist-XL, and Silvally-Fighting. Swanna should take the opportunity to remove entry hazards when it forces switches. It is important to utilize Roost in order to maintain Swanna's longevity when checking Pokemon like Floatzel and Combusken. Swanna's relatively low Special Attack stat means it struggles to break specially defensive Pokemon such as Lickilicky, Kecleon, and Bronzor without a super effective move, so it's best to switch into physical wallbreakers to better handle them. Swanna's Z-Move is best used to net KOs when it doesn't want to risk a Hurricane miss. Furthermore, Supersonic Skystrike can also be used to remove weakened defensive Pokemon such as Silvally-Water and Pyukumuku.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swanna pairs well with Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards removed like Combusken, Rapidash, and Pinsir. Physical wallbreakers such as Machoke and Komala can threaten specially defensive walls like Lickilicky and Kecleon that are able to wall Swanna. These Pokemon also appreciate Swanna's ability to check Golem, Gourgeist-XL, and Silvally-Fighting. Electric-types such as Electivire and Machoke appreciate Swanna's ability to threaten Ground-types like Golem, Silvally-Ground, and Marowak. Swanna hates opposing Electric-types, so Pokemon immune to Electric-type attacks like Golem, Electivire, and Raichu all pair well it. Swanna appreciates Pokemon with entry hazard support such as Golem, Mareanie, and Probopass. In return, Golem and Probopass appreciate Swanna's ability to check Fighting-types. Because Swanna is weak to Stealth Rock and cannot switch into most hazard setters comfortably, it often appreciates a second hazard remover such as Silvally-Fighting, Silvally-Dragon, or Komala.</p>"

      "Z-Rain Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald may be used over Surf so Swanna is able to threaten physical attackers with a potential burn. Z-Rain Dance allows Swanna to gain a +1 Speed boost as well as activate its ability, Hydration. Swanna has the option to run Ice Beam over Roost exclusively for Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Waterium Z is necessary to boost Swanna's Speed in cleaning situations; however, it can also be used to boost Swanna’s selected Water-type STAB move by turning it into Hydro Vortex if the speed boost is not needed. However, Hydro Vortex from Scald is much weaker than from Surf.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swanna's main role is to act as a late-game sweeper, so it is best to preserve it until it has a clear opening or its checks and counters are weakened. The choice between using Z-Rain Dance or Hydro Vortex should be based on whether Swanna needs a Speed boost in order to sweep. Under rain, Hydro Vortex can be used to catch opposing weakened specially defensive walls off guard such as Bronzor, Lickilicky, Assault Vest Komala, and Kecleon. Ideally, Roost should be used on predicted switches in order to maintain Swanna's HP, giving it a greater chance of completing its sweep. With the +1 Speed boost, Swanna outpaces and KOes common Choice Scarf users such as Chatot, Leafeon, Pinsir, a weakened Electivire, and weakened Silvally formes. Swanna should be wary of priority users such as Kecleon and Pawniard, as they ignore Swanna's Speed boost and can take advantage of its low defenses.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swanna greatly appreciates entry hazard support in order to weaken some of its checks and counters, so Pokemon that can set hazards such as Golem and Mareanie all make for great partners. Because Swanna is weak to Stealth Rock, Pokemon that can remove hazards such as Komala and Silvally formes are all excellent options. Silvally-Fighting in particular makes for a fantastic option because it isn't weak to Stealth Rock and can pressure Golem and Probopass. Swanna often finds itself pressured by Electric-type Pokemon, so Pokemon that are immune to Electric-type attacks such as Raichu, Electivire, and Golem all make for good partners. Swanna can synergize well with other physical late-game sweepers like Muk, Pinsir, and Combusken by eliminating each other's defensive checks. Physical wallbreakers such as Combusken and Choice Band Komala are all able to pressure Pokemon that wall Swanna such as Bronzor, Vigoroth, and Kecleon.</p>"

Aqua Jet offers Swanna priority, allowing it to clean if the opposing team still has a weakened Choice Scarf user. Alternatively, Roost enables Swanna to regain its health so it can maintain a threatening position. In addition, Roost allows Swanna to become a better soft check to Floatzel and Silvally-Fighting.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flyinium Z allows Swanna to use Z-Mirror Move or Supersonic Skystrike in order to clean late-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swanna should be primarily used as a late-game cleaner, so potential threats and walls should be removed such as Choice Scarf Electivire, Pawniard, Pyukumuku, and Silvally-Water. Before using Z-Mirror Move, take into account the last move that was used and whether it would KO the opposing Pokemon. Because of the recoil damage, Brave Bird should only be used to net KOs that Liquidation can't. Due to its lackluster bulk, Swanna lacking Roost should refrain from switching into opposing attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swanna appreciates Pokemon that can set entry hazards and chip its checks and counters, so Pokemon like Golem and Mareanie make for great partners.

Sawsbuck is able to set itself apart from other Choice Scarf users in the tier thanks to its access to Serene Grace and Headbutt and carves out a niche for itself as a sweeper thanks to its excellent offensive typing. With access to Sap Sipper and Normal-type STAB moves, Sawsbuck can threaten opposing Grass-types such as Leafeon and Servine. In addition, Sawsbuck has access to a good offensive movepool and becomes a force to be reckoned with after a Swords Dance. Unfortunately, Sawsbuck suffers from competition from other offensive Grass-types such as Leafeon and Jumpluff. Because of its lackluster defensive stats and multitude of weaknesses, Sawsbuck is easily revenge killed by priority users such as Kecleon, Pawniard, and Monferno. Furthermore, Sawsbuck is easily walled by Pokemon like Bronzor and Gourgeist-XL.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bounce can be run in conjunction with Flyinium Z in order to break Gourgeist-XL, which Sawsbuck is otherwise walled by. Furthermore, Gourgeist-XL has access to the ability Frisk, making Flyinium Z ineffective as a way to beat it. Sawsbuck can run Substitute at the cost of a coverage move to protect it from being afflicted by status. Return is an option over Double-Edge, as it helps maintain Sawsbuck's longevity through late-game. However, the extra power Double-Edge provides is needed to reliably revenge kill Pokemon such as Zebstrika. Sawsbuck has the option of running Megahorn in order to hit other Grass-types, but this does not add much to Sawsbuck's coverage. Leech Seed can be run in conjunction with Substitute and Leftovers in order to form a SubSeed set. However, this set becomes much more reliant on Headbutt flinches to be effective. A set utilizing Chlorophyll and Swords Dance can be used when on a sun team to become a potent sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Priority moves such as Pawniard's Sucker Punch all hit Sawsbuck hard due to its poor defenses. Moreover, Monferno's Mach Punch hit Sawsbuck super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Sawsbuck struggles to break through Pokemon like Granbull and Mawile without any boosts or a Z-Move.

  "Beheeyem": {
    "overview": "<p>Beheeyem is one of the strongest wallbreakers in ZU thanks to Analytic, which makes it very difficult to switch into, and its good coverage options make it very threatening to play against. Beheeyem also has access to setup moves such as Nasty Plot and Calm Mind, which allow it to become even more threatening, and its solid bulk usually allows it to survive at least one hit from offensive Pokemon and makes it more capable of taking advantage of Analytic. Furthermore, even though it is easily outsped, it can still pose a significant problem for the enemy team, as Analytic heavily benefits from its lack of Speed. These qualities often allow Beheeyem to punish many defensive Pokemon such as Mareanie and Gourgeist-XL that allow it to switch in safely. Beheeyem's biggest weakness is its Speed tier, which leaves it susceptible to getting revenge killed by a wide range of Pokemon—it can be outsped by wallbreakers, which are generally considered slow, like Choice Band Komala, and is often left open to being crippled by walls. Beheeyem also faces tough competition as a Choice Specs user from Exeggutor, who boasts a higher Speed stat and can threaten switch-ins with a powerful STAB Leaf Storm.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>On the Choice Specs set, Beheeyem has even more coverage moves than those listed; Energy Ball can deal more damage against various Ground-types and Water-types such as Golem and Pyukumuku, and Thunderbolt provides more damage against Pawniard than Signal Beam and also allows Beheeyem to better deal with Water-types such as Pyukumuku and Silvally-Water. These do, however, tend to provide inferior coverage to the options listed on the sets. On the other sets, there is the option of using Assault Vest, which allows Beheeyem to maximize its bulk and exploit Analytic in order to act as a special tank. The Trick Room set can use Ghostium Z to break Bronzor more easily without having to worry about Trick Room being up or recoil damage from Life Orb, but it also suffers from the loss of power and utility that other options offer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon stop Beheeyem from being able to freely use its STAB move, as doing so could result in a loss of momentum. Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Pawniard and Kecleon can be a big problem for the Trick Room set, as it stops Beheeyem from being able to move first, and trappers such as Silvally-Dark can utilize Pursuit to heavily threaten the Choice Specs set, which also struggles heavily against users of Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor is not weak to Signal Beam or Hidden Power Fighting and thus it is one of the main reasons Beheeyem chooses to run Shadow Ball on most of its sets. Bronzor pressures Beheeyem, stopping it from being able to freely use its STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: The bulky setup sweeper set has no way to remove status and might have to repeatedly boost to take down a defensive Pokemon it does not have the optimal coverage for, resulting in more damage from Toxic. As Beheeyem is extremely slow, it can be easily finished off.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong offensive Pokemon, such as Choice Band Komala and Pinsir, are difficult to switch into safely and can deal heavy damage to Beheeyem. On top of this, they can be a big problem if they are sent in after Beheeyem KOes a Pokemon, threatening to deal damage to a teammate or set up a Swords Dance.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Beheeyem's most reliable STAB move and hits physically defensive Pokemon such as Golem and Pyukumuku, whereas Psyshock functions as a slightly weaker option that allows it to threaten specially defensive Pokemon like Komala, Lickilicky, and Kecleon. Shadow Ball gives it a strong, super effective coverage move to hit Bronzor with and provides coverage for other Psychic-types such as opposing Beheeyem. Hidden Power Fighting gives Beheeyem an option to hit Pawniard and Probopass as well as some other Steel-types. It also provides super effective coverage for Dark-types and gives Beheeyem perfect neutral coverage when used with Shadow Ball. Another coverage option is Signal Beam, which gives Beheeyem a good chance to OHKO Silvally-Dark after Stealth Rock damage. Finally, Trick allows Beheeyem to cripple opposing walls and can make Beheeyem less reliant on predicting switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Beheeyem's low Speed tier allows it to make frequent use of Analytic to power up its attacks. Its EVs are also invested into HP rather than Speed, as Beheeyem is unlikely to outspeed many threats even with investment, whereas HP allows it to take most attacks. 208 HP EVs minimize the damage Beheeyem takes from Stealth Rock, and 48 Speed EVs allow Beheeyem to outspeed Mareanie and uninvested Golem. This is important because Beheeyem excels at punishing a switch to Mareanie, and outspeeding Mareanie means Beheeyem can avoid Knock Off and OHKO with Psychic, or Psyshock if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Beheeyem's primary objective should be to open holes in the opposing team that its teammates can take advantage of. It is very effective to bring Beheeyem in from a pivot or double switch, as this can bring it in at full health. If the opponent has no strong defensive checks, the most common scenario after doing this is that the opponent will choose a Pokemon to sacrifice and attempt to revenge kill—this means Beheeyem requires partners that are able to take on offensive Pokemon that threaten it to continue dealing damage. Beheeyem also has enough bulk to be brought in on a resisted move from an offensive Pokemon or a coverage move without a STAB bonus; examples of this include Mr. Mime's Psychic and Floatzel's Ice Beam. However, this is risky and can lead to Beheyeem becoming very worn down.</p> <p>If the opponent is likely to switch to a defensive check that resists Psychic, like Bronzor or another Beheeyem, a prediction can be made to opt for use of Shadow Ball instead. This will 2HKO specially defensive Bronzor if it is brought in, which prevents it from setting up Stealth Rock or crippling Beheeyem with Toxic, as Beheeyem outspeeds it. Similarly, if the opponent has a Dark-type Pokemon like Silvally-Dark, a prediction can be made to use Hidden Power Fighting or Signal Beam. Trick should be used either to free up Beheeyem's predictions or simply to get rid of Choice Specs in the hope of crippling a foe if Beheeyem is no longer needed for wallbreaking. This is especially good for the entry hazard setters Shuckle and physically defensive Golem, as Beheeyem outspeeds them. After this, Beheeyem's final option is to make a trade. Beheeyem is unlikely to get KOed by any move that is not super effective with a STAB bonus but has a good chance of being able to KO the opposing Pokemon. Due to its low Speed, once it is placed on low health, it will likely lose most of its value but could still be used to KO even slower Pokemon like a boosted Curse Muk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Beheeyem appreciates Pokemon that can grant it safe entry; this is usually through pivoting, but Beheeyem also synergizes well with Pokemon that lure in defensive Pokemon so it can come in. An example of this is Silvally-Fighting, as it deals with Knock Off extremely well and can pivot with U-turn. Other Silvally formes like Silvally-Water and Silvally-Dragon are also strong choices, as they can also lure in defensive Pokemon and pivot. Beheeyem also appreciates trappers like Alolan Golem and Probopass because of their ability to remove Steel-type Pokemon, allowing Beheeyem to use its STAB Psychic more easily and more often. Probopass in particular is a good partner because it can bring Beheeyem in safely through a slow Volt Switch, and Beheeyem can check Fighting-types that threaten Probopass, such as Silvally-Fighting, in return. A good partner for Beheeyem is also Monferno, which is walled by Mareanie but can use U-turn to allow Beheeyem a particularly easy entry onto the field and also help Beheeyem deal with Bronzor and other Steel-types when Beheeyem has been locked into Psychic. Late-game cleaners synergize well with Beheeyem, as it can break through walls which may otherwise threaten them, which can allow them to win later on. Examples of this include Combusken, Swanna, and Electivire, all of which can make up for Beheeyem's lack of Speed and appreciate Beheeyem's ability to threaten Mareanie and Gourgeist-XL respectively.</p> <p>Beheeyem appreciates entry hazard setters like Golem, as they can contribute damage and give Beheeyem a higher chance to OHKO a foe, such as Silvally-Dark with Signal Beam. Hazard removers also pair well with Beheeyem, as they can allow Beheeyem to avoid the damage it has to take when it switches in, thus possibly allowing it to withstand another hit and use another attack. Komala, Silvally-Fighting, and other Silvally formes are great for this. Beheeyem is strong on balance teams because it can often require a teammate to absorb damage when it needs to switch out on a revenge killer. This means it can synergize well with Pokemon like Altaria, Golem, and Gourgeist-XL.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Setup Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot makes Beheeyem extremely powerful and threatening while still allowing it to use coverage and recover its health. Beheeyem can also opt to use Calm Mind, which allows Beheeyem to maximize its bulk and boost its Special Attack, making it too bulky for specially offensive Pokemon such as Floatzel and Electivire to safely handle while still having the offensive presence to deal with defensive Pokemon. Psychic is Beheeyem's preferred STAB move and handles physically defensive Pokemon better, whereas Psyshock handles specially defensive Pokemon such as Komala better. Using Psyshock and Psychium Z gives Beheeyem the opportunity to eliminate a physically bulky threat by targeting its Special Defense. Signal Beam is used as Beheeyem's coverage move to allow it to deal with Dark-types while maintaining a neutral hit on Bronzor and Pawniard. Optionally, Shadow Ball can be used instead of Signal Beam if the team is very weak to Bronzor. This still provides super effective coverage against Psychic-types but gives up coverage against Dark-types. Recover allows Beheeyem to use its bulk investment to stay on the field dealing damage. It also allows Beheeyem to set up against some offensive Pokemon and prevents it from getting chipped too much by bulky sweepers like Muk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Beheeyem runs Colbur Berry to stop it from being forced out by Dark-types, notably Pawniard and Silvally-Dark. Beheeyem can also run Psychium Z, which stops it from being crippled by Trick and Switcheroo and gives it the ability to use a devastating STAB attack or set up a Calm Mind through Taunt. As Psychium Z cannot be removed by Knock Off, it also gives Beheeyem a better matchup against Pawniard. Beheeyem prefers to run Defense EVs for a better matchup against most prominent threats. For example, it allows Beheeyem to always avoid the OHKO from Komala's Return and Pinsir's unboosted X-Scissor, and it softens damage from physical Floatzel and Golem, avoiding a 2HKO from variants that don't run Choice Band.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Beheeyem can make use of its bulk and decent Special Attack to win matchups against some physically offensive Pokemon, and it takes advantage of balance, as it punishes the opponent for switching to a defensive Pokemon by setting up. This combination can make it very threatening for balance teams. The ideal time to use Nasty Plot or Calm Mind is when you predict the opponent will switch out their Pokemon in order to preserve it; even if Beheeyem lacks the power to OHKO the foe without any boosts, it is possible to bluff the Choice Specs set in order to force the switch necessary to set up. Beheeyem can take advantage of its high physical bulk and set up against some offensive Pokemon that do not run Toxic, and using Recover expands the number of Pokemon that Beheeyem can check because of its bulk and gives it more chances to set up. Beheeyem can also set up in order to act as a wallbreaker. However, it should be wary of Toxic while doing this. Unlike most sweepers, Beheeyem's role is not to punish a mistake and clean the rest of the opponent's team—it is too slow for this to be possible. Rather, Nasty Plot and Calm Mind allow Beheeyem to make some strong trades and get a lot of value, as it is usually able to take out a few Pokemon after a strong setup.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Beheeyem is limited in the amount of coverage it can use on this set, it appreciates Pokemon that are able to handle its common checks. It also appreciates trappers like Alolan Golem and Probopass, which can remove Pawniard, and Silvally-Dark, which can remove Bronzor. It appreciates pivoting, particularly from Parting Shot, because this gives Beheeyem a good opportunity to set up while the enemy is weakened. Silvally-Fighting in particular synergizes well with Beheeyem, providing good offensive synergy, giving the team the ability to deal with Dark-types and Steel-types, and giving momentum via Parting Shot or U-turn. Komala is also a great partner for Beheeyem because it can absorb status and Ghost-type attacks. It can also provide momentum using U-turn, which gives Beheeyem an easy entry and opportunities to set up. In return, Beheeyem does a good job of dealing with Fighting-types, which threaten Komala. This ability to check Fighting- and Psychic-types also means Beheeyem synergizes well with other Pokemon like Golem and Combusken.</p>"
      },
      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room is used to allow Beheeyem and possibly its teammates to gain a Speed advantage. This can allow Beheeyem to sweep the opposing team or set up the field for another Pokemon to come in that threatens the opponent's team. Psychic and Psyshock are Beheeyem's STAB moves—Psyshock can be used for better matchups against specially defensive Pokemon and Psychic for physically defensive Pokemon. Beheeyem runs Shadow Ball because it provides a way to hit Bronzor and threatens other Psychic-types. Hidden Power Fighting is useful for getting an OHKO on Pawniard as well as on Probopass after a tiny bit of chip damage. While using this, Beheeyem maintains perfect neutral coverage with Shadow Ball and keeps super effective coverage for Dark-types. Signal Beam is also a good coverage move, as it is super effective against Dark-types and Psychic-types; it deals more damage to Pokemon like Silvally-Dark compared to Hidden Power Fighting and does a better job of threatening Grass-types like Exeggutor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb maximizes Beheeyem's damage output while allowing it to freely use coverage and switch moves, whereas Colbur Berry gives Beheeyem a stronger matchup against Dark-types and can allow Beheeyem to take on Dark-types such as Pawniard and Silvally-Dark with appropriate coverage. The third option, Psychium Z, gives Beheeyem a one-time powerful STAB attack to break through bulky Pokemon. When coupled with Psyshock, Beheeyem is able to target both specially and physically defensive Pokemon. It also allows Beheeyem to use Trick Room through Taunt and prevents Beheeyem from being locked into Trick Room by Trick or Switcheroo. Beheeyem runs 0 Speed IVs to ensure it will outspeed the foe under Trick Room. Beheeyem can choose to run 8 IVs in Speed, allowing it to outspeed Bronzor and threaten to 2HKO under Trick Room with Life Orb Shadow Ball due to Analytic. Under Trick Room, Analytic may not activate, but the situations where Beheeyem prefers to attack still make Analytic the better ability to use. Synchronize is unreliable and does not help Beheeyem to fill its role as a wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>On a full Trick Room team, Beheeyem should be used to simultaneously set up Trick Room and take advantage of it—its bulk should allow it to take at least one hit to set up Trick Room for itself and its team. On balance or hyper offense, Trick Room can be used to allow Beheeyem to become a sweeper that synergizes with other slow Pokemon on the team. On these teams, Trick Room should be used cautiously, as it could give the opponent an advantage. Beheeyem functions best as a Trick Room sweeper if most of its checks are removed; its coverage allows it to deal with a lot of Pokemon that resist Psychic, but switching between coverage moves can waste Trick Room turns. Beheeyem can potentially countersweep the opposing team if it has enough turns to do so and no strong checks are present, and it can also be used solely to allow another Pokemon to sweep through Trick Room if the situation demands it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>On a standard Trick Room team, Beheeyem appreciates partners that can set up Trick Room for itself and other attackers on the team. Carbink and Dusknoir are two solid options for setting Trick Room reliably so Beheeyem can utilize it in order to deal a vast amount of damage. Trick Room attackers that pair well with Beheeyem include Wishiwashi and Marowak, which are common options on a full Trick Room team, and Golem and Granbull, which work well outside of these full Trick Room teams. Granbull in particular synergizes well with Beheeyem, as Trick Room can enhance its ability to wallbreak and open holes in the enemy team. It also has a good matchup against Dark-types and Intimidate to take a hit if Beheeyem is forced out. Outside of full Trick Room, Beheeyem also appreciates the utility provided by entry hazard setters such as Golem and Crustle as well as pivots like Komala that help it find opportunities to set up Trick Room. Beheeyem works best with Pokemon that take care of the very few checks it has. For example, if Beheeyem is not running Hidden Power Fighting, Pokemon such as Silvally-Fighting and Golem can be useful in a matchup against Probopass and Pawniard.</p>"

  "Fraxure": {
    "overview": "<p>Fraxure is a great physical wallbreaker and sweeper thanks to its offensive typing, good coverage moves, excellent ability, access to Dragon Dance, and base 117 Attack stat. Its main niche is wallbreaking with a Choice Band set that hits very hard with STAB Outrage. Poison Jab, Stomping Tantrum, and Low Kick allow it to hit Fairy- and Steel-types. Mold Breaker is easily Fraxure's best ability, allowing it to bypass many abilities on opposing Pokemon that would otherwise trouble it like Bronzor's Levitate and Pyukumuku's Unaware. Dragon Dance reinforces Fraxure's sweeping capabilities; even with its already high base 117 Attack stat, a Dragon Dance set helps Fraxure to overcome its middling Speed tier and sweep. A boosted Z-Move like Devastating Drake or All-Out Pummeling lets Fraxure overpower certain checks like physically defensive Mareanie and Golem. Fraxure does face some competition in ZU from other offensive Dragon-types like Silvally-Dragon and Hakamo-o. Hakamo-o has a better defensive typing and is able to use Bulk Up, while Silvally-Dragon is naturally faster, can pivot with U-turn, and has access to Defog. There are also other physical wallbreakers that give Fraxure competition, like Golem and Komala. Fraxure's lack of reliable recovery and low base Speed can leave it vulnerable to common wallbreakers if entry hazards are on the field. Dragon Dance sets are also easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Electivire and Sawsbuck due to Fraxure's mediocre Speed. While Fraxure can hit Pokemon like Granbull, Mawile, and Metang, they can use their Fairy and Steel typings to pivot into Outrage or Poison Jab and potentially get a free turn. Even if it predicts correctly, Fraxure needs an Attack boost from Dragon Dance or Choice Band to do serious damage to these threats. Even with Eviolite, the plethora of wallbreakers in the metagame can still manage to heavily pressure Fraxure. To make matters worse, Knock Off users like Komala and Machoke can remove Fraxure's Eviolite and suddenly make it less bulky.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Swords Dance set can be viable because it doesn't burden Fraxure by locking it into a move while sending its Attack to sky-high levels, but Fraxure misses out on gaining the Speed that Dragon Dance boosts provide, not to mention that Fraxure has no priority moves to hit threats faster than it. Superpower is a possible alternative to Low Kick for guaranteed power, but it has the added cost of lowering Fraxure's Attack and Defense, both of which it does not sit well with. On the Dragon Dance set, having Substitute as a utility option can pay off, as it doesn't require Fraxure to predict as much and allows it to avoid unwanted status. This will cost Fraxure a coverage move, however. Futhermore, Fraxure's bulk is not all that great, which limits the opportunities that it has to set up a Substitute. Taunt is a nice utility move that, when combined with Mold Breaker, makes Fraxure a threat to defensive teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Despite Fraxure's ability to deal with them via coverage moves, pesky Steel-types like Bronzor, Mawile, and Metang can give it trouble, especially if it's locked into Poison Jab or Outrage. They all do need to be wary of Stomping Tantrum, however.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Granbull, Shiinotic, and Mr. Mime can all come in on Fraxure's moves at a risk. However, Granbull can handle only one Poison Jab and Shiinotic cannot handle one at all, although Mawile can wall Fraxure almost completely.</p> <p><strong>Gourgeist-XL</strong>: Gourgeist-XL, with its annoyingly high physical bulk, manages to take hits from either of Fraxure's sets, burn it, and then recover its lost HP. However, Gourgeist-XL does need to be wary of Devastating Drake hitting it hard.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Electivire, Silvally, Chatot, and Mr. Mime can outspeed Fraxure at +1 and use moves like Ice Punch, Double-Edge, Boomburst, and Dazzling Gleam to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: All forms of entry hazards affect Fraxure. They're a problem especially if Fraxure is running the Dragon Dance set, since Toxic poison from Toxic Spikes puts it on a timer.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Outrage is Fraxure's strongest STAB move that hits anything that doesn't resist it hard, like defensive Golem and Gourgeist-XL. Stomping Tantrum helps Fraxure to break past the Steel-types of the tier like Bronzor, Mawile, Pawniard, and Metang. Poison Jab hits the Fairy-types that are immune to Outrage like Granbull, Mr. Mime, and Shiinotic. Low Kick hits bulkier Pokemon like Lickilicky, Bouffalant, and Golem. Dragon Claw is a STAB option that can be used over Low Kick. It's not as powerful as Outrage, but Fraxure won't be locked into it and can switch out after one use.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature and an EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe is preferred for attacking power, but Jolly can be chosen to outspeed foes like Komala and Butterfree. Mold Breaker ignores other abilities like Bronzor's Levitate and Pyukumuku's Unaware, which reinforces Fraxure's capabilities as a wallbreaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Outrage is best not used until all Steel- and Fairy-types are out of commission, so as to avoid being locked into it against a foe that resists or is immune to it. Instead, using Dragon Claw is preferred until said foes are gone. Fraxure also doesn't like being locked into Outrage against more offensive teams, since it becomes an easier target for revenge killers such as Floatzel and Electivire. Predicting switch-ins and catching them with the appropriate coverage move or double switching into a teammate in order to avoid these situations will be important. For example, Stomping Tantrum should be used to hit Mawile and Bronzor, while Low Kick should be used for Golem and Lickilicky. Fraxure should only stay in if can ensure an OHKO or a 2HKO against the current foe or a potential incoming threat. Bringing Fraxure in via a slow Volt Switch, U-turn, or Parting Shot is recommended so as to limit the damage it takes as much as possible. Double switching when the opponent is expected to bring in a passive threat like Mareanie is also a good way to bring in Fraxure. It doesn't like being in for long periods of time so as to keep itself healthy for wallbreaking. Because Fraxure is using a Choice Band, it needs to be wary of potential opportunities it can create for setup sweepers if it's locked into the wrong move. For example, if Low Kick is used, Rain Dance Swanna can come in and set up. Keeping Fraxure away from Knock Off users like Komala is wise so it doesn't risk losing its Choice Band and its wallbreaking capabilities with it. Trick and Switcheroo users like Floatzel and Rotom-S can also take away its Choice Band.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fraxure fits best on offensive teams in need of a strong physical wallbreaker that resists elemental move types like Fire, Grass, Water, and Electric. While it has the moves to deal with Fairy- and Steel-types, Fraxure cannot always take them on in case it predicts incorrectly. Therefore, having a Poison- or Fighting-type like Curse Muk or Silvally-Fighting as a teammate helps it out greatly. Additional good teammates include Magnet Pull Alolan Golem and Probopass, which can trap Steel-types for Fraxure. Entry hazard removal is critical to keeping Fraxure healthy, so having a teammate that can perform this role like Komala, Sandslash, or Silvally-Poison is highly beneficial. Teammates such as Combusken, Simisear, and Poliwrath that can take care of the Ice-types of the tier like Avalugg, Beartic, Regice, and Glaceon are appreciated. Bringing Fraxure in through a Volt Switch, U-turn, or Parting Shot user like Electivire or Silvally-Fighting limits the damage it takes and give it more chances to wallbreak. Entry hazard setters like Mareanie, Golem, and Bronzor can set Toxic Spikes and Stealth Rock to wear down the opposing teams and make Fraxure's wallbreaking job easier. Setup sweepers like Combusken and Swanna make for great teammates, since Fraxure can break down walls like Lickilicky or Pyukumuku that would otherwise halt their sweeping chances. Revenge killers like Kadabra and Choice Scarf Electivire can pick off Fraxure, so teammates that can deal with these threats like Bouffalant, Granbull, and Choice Scarf Mr. Mime are appreciated. Mr. Mime can also use Healing Wish to restore any lost HP or unwanted status condition that Fraxure has incurred. Lastly, teammates that can absorb Knock Off like Silvally-Fighting, Granbull, and Mawile help Fraxure out greatly.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stomping Tantrum hits annoying Steel-types like Bronzor, Mawile, and Metang. Low Kick is a decent alternative to Stomping Tantrum that allows Fraxure to hit bulky Normal- and Rock-types like Lickilicky, Bouffalant, and Golem harder. Poison Jab gives Fraxure a fighting chance against Fairy-types like Mr. Mime, Granbull, and Shiinotic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed maximize Fraxure's damage output and speed, which helps it to sweep. With a Jolly nature, Fraxure can outspeed threats like Floatzel and Simipour after a Dragon Dance boost and hit them before they can retaliate with their respective Ice-type moves. If running an Adamant nature, Fraxure can 2HKO defensive Golem after Stealth Rock and a Dragon Dance boost. Mold Breaker is a blessing for Fraxure, as it lets it bypass otherwise problematic abilities like Bronzor's Levitate and Pyukumuku's Unaware. Eviolite is the recommended item to give this set a much-needed boost in its Defense and Special Defense. Alternatively, Dragonium Z turns Outrage into Devastating Drake, granting Fraxure a one-time nuke for physically defensive threats like Golem, Gourgeist-XL, and Poliwrath.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Dragon Dance should be used mid- or -late game in order to maximize Fraxure's effectiveness. Ensuring that all of the opponent's Fairy- and Steel-types are gone is essential before using Outrage so as to avoid being locked into it and leaving Fraxure open to status afflictions. Other checks to Fraxure like physically defensive Golem also must be weakened for Outrage to be effective. Ensuring that all entry hazards are gone is also essential for Fraxure's sweeping chances, since it has no reliable recovery, and poison from Toxic Spikes puts it on a timer. Bringing Fraxure in via a pivot should always be the norm, since preserving its HP will be of the utmost importance for its sweeping chances. Fraxure values its Eviolite and would rather not have it removed via Knock Off, Trick, or Switcheroo. Therefore, keeping it away from the likes of Mr. Mime and Floatzel is very wise. Aside from the downside of losing its Eviolite, Fraxure doesn't want to stomach a Knock Off from Komala anyway. Fraxure will generally want to set up on Choice-locked Pokemon, like Floatzel using a Water-type move and Electivire locked into Wild Charge or Flamethrower, or Pokemon with a severely lowered attacking stat, like Zebstrika after it has used Overheat, since any follow-up move used by such Pokemon will not hit Fraxure very hard due to its Eviolite.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Safe entry onto the field is a must for every time Fraxure attempts to set up. Slow pivots that can use U-turn and Volt Switch, like Komala and Alolan Golem, can bring Fraxure in safely. Having the field free of entry hazards is something else that Fraxure appreciates. Examples of teammates that can help with hazard control include Komala, Sandslash, Swanna, and Rotom-S, while Mareanie and Muk can absorb Toxic Spikes for Fraxure. Having entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field gives Fraxure an easier time sweeping, so Stealth Rock setters like Golem, Bronzor, Mawile, and Metang pair well. Since Fraxure is a setup sweeper and runs the risk of getting a nasty status affliction, having a cleric on the team like Healing Wish Mr. Mime, Heal Bell + Wish Lickilicky, or even Heal Bell Granbull can be beneficial to give it a second chance at sweeping. Since Will-O-Wisp from Gourgeist-XL derails any hopes of Fraxure sweeping the opposing team, Pokemon that can absorb burns or beat Gourgeist-XL make for great teammates. Examples include Z-Rain Dance Swanna, Combusken, and Rapidash. Choice Scarf users like Swanna, Electivire, Rapidash, and Silvally can all can be a headache for Fraxure, as they can outspeed Adamant sets even after two Dragon Dances. Therefore, teammates like defensive Golem, Choice Scarf Electivire, and Mareanie help Fraxure greatly, since they can deal with these threats. A teammate that can provide dual screens support like Electrode or Meowstic is great for Fraxure, especially if it's on a hyper offensive team, to give it that extra bulk needed to stomach more hits while setting up.</p>"

  "Pawniard": {
    "overview": "<p>Pawniard is a solid attacker due to its great offensive typing, decent Attack stat, and access to Swords Dance and STAB Sucker Punch to function as a threatening physical sweeper. Moreover, STAB Knock Off and Iron Head enable Pawniard to break down bulkier Pokemon such as Bronzor, Beheeyem, and Granbull. Defensively, Pawniard's Dark / Steel typing lets it check threats such as Muk and Leafeon. Despite this, Pawniard's middling bulk and Speed leave it overly reliant on Sucker Punch to handle faster attackers and limit its setup opportunities. Furthermore, Pawniard has a poor matchup against common Defog users such as Silvally-Fighting and Silvally-Water, which limits its effectiveness as Defog deterrent. Lastly, common Pokemon such as Combusken and Sandslash can switch in and scare Pawniard off, while other offensive Pokemon such as Rapidash and Pinsir can take a Sucker Punch and threaten to OHKO back.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Life Orb can be used over Eviolite on more offensive entry hazard stacking or Sticky Web teams to allows Pawniard to clean more easily late-game. For example, Life Orb Pawniard can OHKO Mr. Mime and Chatot with Sucker Punch after slight chip damage. Darkinium Z can be utilized instead of Eviolite to increase Pawniard's wallbreaking capabilities and to more easily beat Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL. Steelium Z may also be used to nail Dark-type switch-ins such as Silvally-Fighting and Machoke. However, the lack of Eviolite leaves Pawniard with notably less bulk and an inability to check Pokemon such as Leafeon. In addition, Pawniard needs Eviolite to avoid the OHKO from attacks such as Earthquake from Electivire and Dazzling Gleam from Mr. Mime. This also uses up the team's Z-Crystal, which limits teambuilding. Pursuit can be used over Swords Dance to trap Pokemon such as Bronzor, Choice Specs Beheeyem, and Dusclops. While Pawniard loses the ability to sweep without Swords Dance, it has little competition as a Pursuit trapper and can capitalize on the switches it forces because of Knock Off. Low Kick enables Pawniard to OHKO Probopass and 2HKO Alolan Golem, but it is very situational and generally inferior to Swords Dance. Taunt can be used to prevent the use of moves such as Will-O-Wisp from Gourgeist-XL and Recover from Pyukumuku, but Pawniard generally appreciates other moves instead.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Fighting-types such as Combusken, Silvally-Fighting, and Monferno can OHKO Pawniard with their STAB moves. Monferno and Combusken resist both of Pawniard's STAB moves, and Silvally-Fighting has the bulk to easily switch into Pawniard's attacks multiple times. Other Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage such as Focus Blast Floatzel and Jump Kick Sawsbuck only need to watch out for Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon that can withstand +2 Sucker Punch such as Pinsir and Silvally-Dragon can revenge kill Pawniard after minimal chip damage. However, these Pokemon fail to revenge kill Pawniard if they have already taken too much prior damage, especially Pinsir, which has a high chance of getting OHKOed by +2 Pawniard after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp Users</strong>: Will-O-Wisp users such as Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL can take a hit from Pawniard and cripple it. Firium Z Rapidash can also pivot into Pawniard and threaten to cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. However, Gourgeist-XL needs to keep its Colbur Berry intact in order to handle Pawniard, and Rapidash should be wary of chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Sandslash, Torterra, and Silvally-Ground can check Pawniard and threaten it with their STAB attacks. However, the former two dislike switching directly into Pawniard as they lose their recovery items in the process.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Pawniard's primary STAB move that also has the added benefit of removing items, crippling Eviolite users such as Mareanie and Machoke. Sucker Punch enables Pawniard to clean weakened teams once it has set up with Swords Dance. Iron Head allows Pawniard to hit Fairy-types such as Granbull for super effective damage and chip away at Dark- and Fighting-types such as Silvally-Dark and Machoke, which would otherwise easily switch into it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature allow Pawniard to sweep as easily as possible, guaranteeing an OHKO against Electivire after Stealth Rock damage with +2 Sucker Punch, which it can not attain with a Jolly nature. Defiant allows Pawniard to discourage the use of Defog and Parting Shot from the likes of Silvally-Dark and to take advantage of Intimidate Mawile and Granbull, two go-to Dark-type switch-ins.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance should be used early- and mid-game to help Pawniard break through defensive Pokemon such as Mareanie and Lickilicky or to sweep late-game. Pawniard can set up late-game against Pokemon such as Leafeon or on forced switches against Choice Scarf users such as Electivire and Silvally. It is vital that entry hazards be set and the opposing team weakened to help Pawniard sweep. For example, Stealth Rock damage ensures revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Rapidash, Electivire, and Swanna faint to +2 Sucker Punch and that slower Pokemon such as Marowak, Lickilicky, and Bellossom are OHKOed by +2 Knock Off or Iron Head. Knock Off should be used to cripple defensive cores by removing items such as Eviolite and Leftovers from Pokemon such as Machoke and Komala. In addition, Pawniard can bait in Knock Off switch-ins and double switch to a teammate to keep up momentum. Pawniard can switch into an expected Defog to gain a +2 boost from Defiant, but it must be wary of certain coverage moves from common Defog users such as Flamethrower from Altaria and Scald from Swanna, as the opponent may predict Pawniard coming in. By the same token, Pawniard must be careful of getting trapped by Magnet Pull trappers such as Alolan Golem and Probopass, which can prevent a sweep or render Pawniard useless early. As such, Pawniard should double switch to avoid getting trapped by these Pokemon until they are sufficiently weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Golem and Crustle are crucial partners due to their ability to wear down Pawniard's checks with Stealth Rock and Spikes. Also, Shuckle and Leavanny can support Pawniard with Sticky Web, which allows it to outspeed Pokemon such as Electivire and Pinsir that would otherwise revenge kill it. In return, Pawniard can deter Defog users from removing the entry hazards. Wallbreakers such as Expert Belt Electivire and Z-Mirror Move Swanna also make for good teammates because they appreciate Pawniard's ability to pressure Defog users. Moreover, these wallbreakers can check Silvally-Water, Floatzel, and Silvally-Fighting for Pawniard and pave a way for it to sweep late-game. Similarly, wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Beheeyem and Choice Band Granbull can also break through Pawniard's checks such as Silvally-Fighting. In return, Pawniard takes advantage of Pokemon such as Bronzor. On the other hand, Fighting-type checks such as Mareanie can help check Pokemon that threaten Pawniard such as Combusken, Monferno, and Silvally-Fighting. Mareanie also has the benefit of providing Pawniard with Toxic Spikes support to wear down its checks even further.</p>"

  "Bouffalant": {
    "overview": "<p>Bouffalant finds a home in the ZU metagame thanks to its decent movepool, above-average bulk, excellent Attack stat, and desirable abilities in Sap Sipper and Reckless. Its main niche is to be a bulky Normal-type setup sweeper with Swords Dance. Sap Sipper is by far its best ability, letting in come in on the Grass-types of the tier like Leafeon to get an Attack boost and become even more dangerous. Alternatively, if Bouffalant is running Reckless, it can punch big holes in the opposing team with STAB Head Charge. With its powerful STAB moves, as well as its coverage moves like Earthquake and Pursuit, Bouffalant can be difficult to switch into or pivot on. While Komala does outclass Bouffalant as a Normal-type wallbreaker thanks to its immunity to status, better Attack stat, and access to Rapid Spin, if a team is lacking bulk, Bouffalant is a better pick over Komala as well as Kecleon. Bouffalant can also utilize a Choice Band very well, but Komala typically does this better as well. The same can be said for an Assault Vest set, which Komala and Kecleon also can use better thanks to their respective abilities in Comatose and Protean as well as their above-average Special Defense stats. Bouffalant's lack of Knock Off worsens its matchup against Bronzor as well; Komala not only learns Knock Off, but also possesses higher Speed and a pivoting move, making it a better Bronzor check. At a paltry base 55 Speed, Bouffalant gets outsped by most of the tier, and despite its decent bulk, it still gets worn down easily by common wallbreakers like Silvally-Fighting, Electivire, and Pinsir.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A RestTalk set can be used with Swords Dance to give Bouffalant longevity and protection against status at the cost of being more passive and easier to wall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL, Golem, Crustle, and even Pyukumuku give Bouffalant headaches and can easily switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor has nothing to fear from Bouffalant. It resists Bouffalant's STAB attacks, is immune to Earthquake and Toxic, and, most importantly, often runs Rest to recover whatever damage Bouffalant may have dealt to it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: In general, Bouffalant is not fast, which means it is prone to getting hit hard. Because of this, its hopes of potentially dealing a lot of damage rest on it coming on in something slower like Camerupt or Probopass.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Head Charge recoil and entry hazards wear down Bouffalant quickly, especially considering that Bouffalant has no reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: The common Fighting-types of the tier like Silvally-Fighting, Machoke, Combusken, and Monferno pressure Bouffalant offensively and force it out every time.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance, in tandem with Substitute and Toxic, is what allows Bouffalant to function as a stallbreaker and break through tanks like Lickilicky and Golem. Alternatively, Earthquake can be run in its place to hit Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types, but Bouffalant loses out on the much-wanted Attack boost and the ability to wallbreak or sweep teams. Toxic is a way to punish switch-ins that would otherwise wall Bouffalant such as Gourgeist-XL, Golem, Crustle, and Pyukumuku. Lastly, Substitute lets Bouffalant capitalize on potential switches made by the opponent and avoid a potential burn from Gourgeist-XL or a Toxic from Lickilicky or Bronzor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 Speed EVs let Bouffalant outspeed base 45 Speed Pokemon like Adamant Golem. 84 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature maximize Bouffalant's Attack while the rest of the EVs goes into HP for added bulk. Leftovers gives Bouffalant that much-needed passive recovery to help maintain its longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>As the name suggests, this set's goal is to deal with stall, and because of this, keeping Bouffalant behind its Substitute is key. Getting badly poisoned or burned before using Substitute will ruin any chance Bouffalant has of doing its job. For this reason, switching into Pokemon like Pyukumuku and Gourgeist-XL is a bad idea. Utilizing Toxic is important in wearing the opposing team down; multiple Pokemon in the tier can wall Bouffalant completely or set up on it like Gourgeist and Crustle, and Toxic can potentially put a stop to those plans and make it easier for Bouffalant's teammates to take them on. If Bouffalant is behind a Substitute, the opposing team will want to get rid of it quickly before Bouffalant starts setting up and dealing damage. As a stallbreaker, Bouffalant can break a balance team and play as a tank if Substitute isn't needed. Most of the time, Swords Dance should be used behind a Substitute or when all Ghost-types are gone.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bronzor is a huge issue with this variant of Bouffalant, since it walls everything Bouffalant throws at it. However, Bronzor does require high damage rolls on its Psywave to break Bouffalant's Substitute to prevent a Swords Dance boost. Having a Fire- or Dark-type like Simisear or Pawniard helps greatly. As mentioned before, Gourgeist-XL is also a problem; in addition to Pawniard helping here, other Pokemon like Combusken and Swanna make for great partners for this set. A Pokemon that can deal with Steel-types like Bronzor and Mawile gives Bouffalant an easier time; Alolan Golem is a prime example thanks to its Magnet Pull ability. Toxic Spikes gives Bouffalant trouble, so a reliable entry hazard remover is critical. These partners include Silvally-Fighting, Silvally-Water, and Altaria for Defog and Sandslash for Rapid Spin. Since poison is an issue, bringing in a Poison- or Steel-type to absorb any move that can Poison, particularly Toxic, will relieve Bouffalant of a lot of pressure. Good teammates that can do this include Muk, Mareanie, and Bronzor. Teammates that can threaten and dispose of Ghost-types work very with Bouffalant, such as Pawniard. Since entry hazards wear down the opposing team, bring teammates able to set them do just that; Mareanie works well here thanks to its access to Toxic Spikes.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is a nice STAB move that hits most of the meta for decent damage. Earthquake allows Bouffalant to hit the Rock- and Steel-types that Return won't like Golem and Metang. Facade is a nice move to fall back on if Bouffalant becomes crippled with status. Bouffalant can trap Pokemon like Beheeyem and Kadabra with Pursuit to remove their ability to deal serious damage. It also traps pivots that don't like being worn down and can't OHKO Bouffalant like Electivire and Chatot.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Assault Vest allows Bouffalant to tank attacks from powerful specially offensive threats, like Simisear and Exeggutor. Max EVs in HP and Attack along with an Adamant nature give Bouffalant the most bulk it can and hit as hard as it can.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since this set aims to utilize Bouffalant's Special Defense, it has to be wary of strong physical wallbreakers. Bouffalant can still function as a physical tank with this set and hits the physically frail threats that can't hit it back hard such as Kadabra, Mr. Mime, and Simisear. Also, since Bouffalant has no recovery, is slow, and wants to conserve its HP, bringing it in safely via a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is crucial. Bouffalant serves as a specially defensive pivot, and as such, its job involves switching it into special attackers and possibly retaliating. It shouldn't be switching into special attackers that could be running Focus Blast like Combusken, however. It can switch directly into Grass-types like Bellossom to get a Sap Sipper boost, but it should avoid Leafeon, which can carry Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Bouffalant is going to be trying to take special attacks, physical attacks will be an issue, especially Fighting-type moves; having a Psychic- or Fairy-type on the team like Beheeyem or Granbull relieves Bouffalant of some of that stress. Since Sap Sipper allows Bouffalant to deal with Grass-types more easily, partners that appreciate them gone such as Golem, Basculin, and Electivire work well with it. A strong special wallbreaker such as Simipour or Servine to go with Bouffalant is critical, since physically bulky Pokemon will give it a hard time. Slow pivots like Mareanie and Rotom-S can bring in Bouffalant without it taking damage. Entry hazard setters like Golem, Crustle, and Mawile make for great partners to give Bouffalant an easier time taking down opposing Pokemon. Conversely, entry hazard removers also help to keep Bouffalant's HP up and avoid poison from Toxic Spikes. Possible spinners include Sandslash, while potential Defoggers include Altaria and Rotom-F. Partners that don't have the best special bulk appreciate Bouffalant coming in to take those special attacks. Ideal partners are Gourgeist-XL, Metang, and Pinsir; Gourgeist-XL in particular works well thanks to ability to deal with physically attackers like Golem and Komala.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Head Charge is a great STAB move here that can OHKO Lickilicky after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake lets Bouffalant hit the Rock- and Steel-types of the tier, most notably 2HKOing both Golem and Metang and OHKOing Probopass and Pawniard. Toxic is a nice option to poison certain Pokemon that Bouffalant cannot normally hit very well at all like Gourgeist-XL and Dusclops. Facade hits harder than Head Charge if Bouffalant is crippled with status and is a nice move to spam once the Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types are gone from the opposing team. Pursuit traps frail Pokemon that are susceptible to Dark-type moves like Beheeyem, Grumpig, and Kadabra and also hits pivots like Volt Switch Electivire and U-turn Silvally-Water, both of which cannot OHKO Bouffalant.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band, along with an Adamant nature, Reckless ability, and the EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe allow Bouffalant to hit its absolute hardest.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Band Bouffalant's main role is to simply deal damage. Ghost-types like Gourgeist-XL and Dusclops are a problem when it comes to spamming STAB Head Charge or Facade; this is where Toxic comes into play. Once opposing Ghost-types are poisoned, Bouffalant can switch out to preserve its status by avoiding a burn or Toxic poison. Grass-types like Leafeon and Jumpluff don't want to give Sap Sipper Bouffalant that extra Attack boost, so switching into these Pokemon could potentially help Bouffalant. However, the former two typically carry Knock Off and may end up getting rid of Bouffalant's Choice Band. Bringing Bouffalant in from a slow U-turn or Volt Switch is always a good idea to maintain its longevity and avoid any unwanted burns from the aforementioned Ghost-types and Scald users like Mareanie and Swanna. Since Bouffalant is a wallbreaker, if the opposing team has a Ghost-type on it, it will likely switch it into Bouffalant every time, so it is important to utilize Toxic in those situations until they're gone. Reckless-boosted Head Charge's heavy recoil damage should always be taken into account; getting worn down is always going to be a problem for Bouffalant, since it's usually getting hit before it can deliver a hit itself.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While this moveset covers the tier pretty well, it doesn't cover a few threats. Gourgeist-XL, for example, is a huge problem for Bouffalant, and having a specially attacking partner like Zebstrika or Combusken helps it out. Bronzor is also a problem, so having a Dark-, Ghost-, or Fire-type around to deal with it certainly helps; options include Pawniard, Dusknoir, and Simisear. Since Bouffalant is going to want to be switched in safely every single time, having a slow U-turn or Volt Switch user like bulky Silvally-Poison or Probopass is a must. Since Bouffalant will be locked into a move, usually Head Charge or Facade, setup sweepers like Crustle and Pawniard can come in for free and take advantage of it. Partners that can deal with these Pokemon include Pyukumuku and Silvally-Fighting. Having a partner to deal with Rock- and Steel-types like Golem, Crustle, Bronzor, and Mawile make Bouffalant's job easier; such partners include Floatzel, Electivire, and Combusken. Entry hazard setters like Crustle and Mareanie also give Bouffalant an easier time by wearing down the opposing team. Hazard control from Pokemon like Mareanie, Sandslash, and Silvally-Poison can help keep Bouffalant around longer. Toxic Spikes in particular will wear down Bouffalant quickly, especially when combined with Head Charge's recoil damage.</p>"

  "Furfrou": {
    "overview": "<p>With its great Speed tier and sizable bulk, Furfrou excels as both a revenge killer and offensive pivot. What makes Furfrou unique as an offensive pivot is its ability, Fur Coat, as the additional Defense allows it to tank attacks from the likes of Electivire, Komala, and Sandslash. Fur Coat along with its high Speed makes Furfrou a great cleaner as well, as it is naturally outspeeds a great number of foes while being able to stomach the attacks of physical Choice Scarf users like Electivire and Rapidash, all the while having a decent chance to KO them back. When boosted by Choice Band, Furfrou's STAB Return can threaten OHKOs on frailer targets like Swanna and Simisear after slight chip damage, and thanks to U-turn, Furfrou can pick off weakened or extra vulnerable targets like Silvally-Dark, Leafeon, and Exeggutor while safely pivoting out and generating momentum. However, Furfrou's limited coverage can make it a one-trick pony, and physical walls like Mawile, Gourgeist-XL, and Dusclops can easily tank or play around its attacks. Locking into its attacks can also make Furfrou setup bait, and its weak Surf notably can be taken advantage of by common sweepers like Swanna, Simisage, and Bibarel. Furfrou also gets worn down easily from the residual damage of entry hazards and status conditions, which gives walls like Bronzor and Mareanie opportunities to capitalize on it. Lastly, threatening faster special attackers like Kadabra, Raichu, and Choice Scarf Rotom-S limit its potential opportunities to switch in and revenge kill foes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Cotton Guard, Rest, and an investment that maximizes HP and Speed, Furfrou can be a defensive setup sweeper that finds opportunities to boost thanks to being faster than most Pokemon and Fur Coat. However, this is usually not worthwhile, as it lacks sufficient coverage, reliable recovery, and the ability to break other walls. Work Up can help raise Furfrou's firepower without the downside of being Choice-locked, but the lack of immediate strength and offensive coverage makes Furfrou underwhelming as a setup sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Any physical wall that either resists its attacks or has decent recovery can check Furfrou. While some walls like Golem, Avalugg, and Poliwrath have to be wary of Surf or Toxic, Mareanie, Mawile, and Metang are completely unfazed by its coverage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Defensive Steel-types like Mawile and Probopass take little from Furfrou's attacks, while Pawniard and Metang can punish Furfrou offensively.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gourgeist-XL and Dusclops can switch into Return and inflict status on Furfrou with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic, forcing Furfrou to lock into Toxic or pivot out and not capitalize on its offensive capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards and status ailments wear down Furfrou, and users such as Torterra, Bronzor, Poliwrath, and Mareanie can use Stealth Rock, Toxic, Scald, and Toxic Spikes to deter it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster special attackers such as Kadabra, Raichu, and Choice Scarf Rotom-S can threaten Furfrou with their STAB attacks, Z-Moves, and status ailments. Faster physical attackers like Rapidash, Purugly, and Choice Scarf Pinsir also check Furfrou offensively but are less effective due to Fur Coat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn allows Furfrou to pivot out while still threatening heavy damage against targets like Silvally-Dark and Exeggutor. Surf is worthwhile for 2HKOing Golem, which otherwise takes little from Furfrou's Normal- and Bug-type coverage. Sucker Punch opens an opportunity for Furfrou to revenge kill weakened faster threats like Kadabra and Choice Scarf Chatot. Toxic instead can be chosen to wear down physical walls like Gourgeist-XL and Poliwrath that Furfrou cannot break otherwise. Facade is a noteworthy option to capitalize on if Furfrou is afflicted with status, but this attack is usually too situational and less rewarding in comparison to the other coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Choice Band and Jolly nature give Furfrou the chance to outspeed and OHKO multiple threats like Swanna and Electivire. Despite having a Jolly nature and lack of Special Attack investment, Surf still 2HKOes every relevant Golem set, which is the only target it is meant for.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to its great Speed and physical bulk, Furfrou functions great early-game as a scout and lead. Furfrou can safely U-turn on possible entry hazard setters like Golem and Torterra, and the damage may determine if the targets are running defensive or wallbreaking sets. Using U-turn in general is usually safe, but you should try avoiding unnecessary residual damage from Rocky Helmet Mawile and entry hazards by either hard switching instead or using U-turn only as an opportunity to bring in anti-entry hazard teammates. Frailer setup sweepers like Z-Mirror Move Swanna and Nasty Plot Simipour have a chance to survive a Furfrou's Return at full, but they are guaranteed to be OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Try not to risk Furfrou's health in these situations and plan to revenge kill these threats after they have taken Stealth Rock or similar damage; try using U-turn first before revenge killing with Return. Furfrou's niche coverage in Surf, Sucker Punch, and Toxic can be used to capitalize on otherwise threatening checks like Golem, Kadabra, and Pyukumuku. However, locking into these attacks can make Furfrou vulnerable to setup sweepers like Leafeon, Combusken, and Pawniard, so only risk these attacks when appropriate. If needed, Furfrou can switch into physical attackers like Electivire, Rapidash, Leafeon, and Komala to force them out, but risking Furfrou's health jeopardizes its role as a potential late-game cleaner. This is even more relevant if the latter two examples use Knock Off, as Furfrou relies heavily on its Choice Band for adequate damage. As a cleaner, Furfrou has no trouble breaking past weakened offensive Pokemon like Simisage and Silvally-Dragon, but you should make sure Pokemon that resist or are immune to Normal like Bronzor, Crustle, and Dusclops are significantly worn down or already dealt with.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Furfrou works great on a VoltTurn core with the support of offensive pivots such as Electivire, Rotom-S, Silvally-Dragon, and Silvally-Dark. Silvally-Dark is also notable for trapping Bronzor, Metang, and Dusclops, which Furfrou cannot break on its own but are conveniently weak to Silvally-Dark's Pursuit. To help with physical walls like Golem and Mawile, Furfrou can U-turn out to wallbreakers such as Exeggutor, Torterra, and Beheeyem, which also appreciate that Furfrou may switch into physical revenge killers to them like Swanna and Pinsir if it needs to. Furfrou's susceptibility to faster attackers means it can be revenge killed by Kadabra, Raichu, and Choice Scarf Mr. Mime, so try pairing it with defensive Pokemon like Bronzor, Torterra, and Komala. These walls can both help tank hits for Furfrou while also providing either Stealth Rock or additional U-turn pivoting with it. The opponent's entry hazards deter Furfrou from constantly pivoting, so try having entry hazard removal from Swanna, Silvally-Dragon, and Sandslash. Swanna is especially notable because it checks Fighting-types such as Combusken, Silvally-Fighting, and Poliwrath for Furfrou. Furfrou struggles to break past stall teams that can pack defensive walls like Avalugg and Pyukumuku, Ghost-types like Dusclops and Gourgeist-XL, and Toxic switch-ins like Altaria and Muk. Supporting Furfrou with stallbreakers like Taunt Simisear or Knock Off users like Mareanie and Leafeon can help in these matchups.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Carbink is the very definition of a fantastic Trick Room lead. With access to Stealth Rock, Magic Coat, and Sturdy, Carbink nearly guarantees Trick Room's setup. In particular, Explosion allows the conservation of limited Trick Room turns for its offensive teammates to exploit, which keeps offensive momentum. However, Carbink is also incredibly passive, with even Explosion doing relatively little due to its meager, uninvested base 50 Attack. Trick Room Carbink is also a one-trick pony, and because the opponent knows Carbink is mandatorily used as lead on Trick Room teams, it becomes incredibly evident which strategy is being used, making it easier for opponents to select their most appropriate anti-lead. Nevertheless, Carbink stands out as the most reliable Trick Room setter in the metagame due to its outstanding bulk, access to several useful utility options, and ability to conserve Trick Room turns for its teammates.</p>",

However, Carbink doesn't have that great of a matchup versus opposing entry hazard removers, and even for stall teams Carbink is incredibly passive due to the lack of a fixed damage output move in its movepool such as Seismic Toss or Night Shade. Power Gem has more PP than Rock Slide as well as a slightly greater damage output; however, most Power Gem targets are more specially defensive, making it a worse option than Rock Slide against foes such as Choice Scarf Rapidash. Carbink can utilize a mono-attacking set with Calm Mind and RestTalk to slowly but surely set up and act as a bulky sweeper. However, Carbink has a plethora of weaknesses, and its overall passivity, exacerbated by Rest's mandatory sleep turns, leaves it easily taken advantage of. Carbink can also attempt to pull off a Reflect and Light Screen set, which may at first sound appealing due its abysmal Speed in combination with its access to a self-sacrifice move to differentiate itself from other Reflect and Light Screen setters such as Electrode and Meowstic and bring in a frail offensive teammate such as Swoobat for free. However, because Carbink would then have to opt for Light Clay over Mental Herb, it becomes even more susceptible to Taunt and Encore. Heat Rock variants of Carbink may seem like an interesting alternative to Golem as a dedicated Stealth Rock + Sunny Day lead with Sturdy. However, despite Carbink's much better typing and bulk to pull it off, Golem performs this role better to its much greater offensive presence and stronger Explosion. Sun hyper offense also isn't very notable of a playstyle.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Pawniard, Metang, and Mawile offensively pressure Carbink with their super effective STAB attacks and are immune to Toxic. Furthermore, the former two can reliably set up Stealth Rock, while the latter two can safely acquire free Swords Dance boosts due to Carbink's passivity. Additionally, while Moonblast does hit Pawniard neutrally, giving it a free Defiant boost whenever it gets a Special Attack drop can be devastating.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Strong, offensive Water-types such as Floatzel, Swanna, and Simipour all threaten to 2HKO Carbink. More defensively inclined options such as Mareanie and Silvally-Water also tend to shrug off all of Carbink's attacks, even Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Leafeon and Simisage can 2HKO Carbink and even take advantage of its passivity to set up with Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, although the latter two dislike taking an Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Golem and Sandslash threaten to 2HKO Carbink, although those that are also part Dragon-type such as Gabite and Vibrava prefer not to take a STAB Moonblast. Vibrava and Silvally-Ground have additional utility options that allow them to remove the Stealth Rock Carbink sets via Defog.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Misdreavus and Encore users such as Volbeat can nullify Mental Herb once and prevent Carbink from getting both Trick Room and Stealth Rock up. Specially defensive variants of Carbink also dislike being locked into a single move, although Volbeat should steer clear of Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Bypassing Sturdy</strong>: Pokemon that can bypass Carbink's Sturdy ability such as Choice Band Bullet Seed Toucannon and Bonemerang Marowak can prevent Carbink from setting up Trick Room and Stealth Rock at all.</p>",

      "Trick Room Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows naturally slower Pokemon, particularly Carbink's teammates such as Rampardos and Beheeyem, to outspeed faster foes. Magic Coat bounces back certain non-attacking moves such as Crustle's Spikes and Floatzel's Taunt after Carbink's Mental Herb has already nullified it once. Explosion provides Carbink with a means to sacrifice itself, conserving limited turns of Trick Room for offensive teammates such as Toucannon and Wishiwashi and breaking Sturdy and Focus Sash from users such as Crustle and Smeargle.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Mental Herb lifts the effects of Taunt and Encore once, ensuring Carbink sets up Trick Room reliably. Sturdy prevents Carbink from being OHKOed by strong, super effective attacks such as Choice Specs Floatzel's Hydro Pump. Carbink's physically defensive spread and Relaxed nature allow it to take on a myriad of physical attackers such as Pinsir and Electivire with relative ease while decreasing Carbink's Speed even further to ensure it can outspeed as many foes as possible under Trick Room and pull off its Explosion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Trick Room variants of Carbink should almost always be selected to lead, as guaranteeing Sturdy is intact ensures Carbink sets up Trick Room safely for its teammates. An important question to ask after seeing what the opponent has chosen for their lead is if it commonly carries Taunt or if it can 2HKO Carbink. Additionally, the Carbink user should determine if switching out is more beneficial than using Explosion, such as when facing the risk of being locked into Trick Room after Mental Herb has been removed by a Prankster Encore user such as Volbeat. Carbink should avoid its passivity being used against itself to burn its own turns of Trick Room. Being aware of the likelihood of this will help determine whether or not Carbink can set Stealth Rock in addition to Trick Room against foes such as Bronzor and Crustle. Carbink should also consider when to use Magic Coat against non-attacking moves such as Smeargle's Spore, and it should always immediately use Explosion after setting Trick Room, so as to conserve as many turns of Trick Room as possible for its more offensively inclined teammates. This includes situations where Carbink faces a foe that resists or is immune to Explosion such as Bronzor or Gourgeist-XL.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Strong, slow wallbreakers such as Toucannon, Marowak, Camerupt, Wishiwashi, and Rampardos can make use of the Trick Room support Carbink provides. Due to Trick Room's short duration, additional Trick Room setters are also mandatory. Other options include Dusknoir, which can provide healing support with Z-Memento, and Gourgeist-XL, which, similarly to Carbink, can preserve turns of Trick Room with Explosion. Beheeyem is a great example of an offensive Trick Room user that can not only reliably set up Trick Room but also fire off Analytic-boosted attacks. Pokemon that can provide fast offense outside of Trick Room such as Floatzel and Choice Scarf Electivire are also helpful for cleaning up late-game.</p>"

  "Gourgeist-Super": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to a good defensive typing and solid stats, Gourgeist-XL is one of the premier defensive Pokemon in the metagame, capable of answering a wide variety of threats, such as Komala, Golem, physical Floatzel, non-Flamethrower Electivire, and Silvally-Fighting. Gourgeist-XL's movepool gives it access to several utility options, such as Synthesis, Foul Play, Will-O-Wisp, and Leech Seed. Notably, its access to both reliable recovery and passive recovery means it can afford to run a Colbur Berry, allowing it to easily take moves like Komala's Knock Off. Frisk is a very useful ability given that many of the Pokemon Gourgeist-XL tends to switch into, like Komala and Golem, run a variety of sets that are revealed upon uncovering their item. Thanks to Gourgeist-XL's Ghost typing, it can function as a spinblocker; it does so exceptionally well due to its ability to completely wall non-Toxic Komala, which is the best Rapid Spin user in the metagame. As opposed to other Ghost-types, Gourgeist-XL does not get Pursuit trapped very easily due to Will-O-Wisp, great bulk, and a tendency to run Colbur Berry, which Eviolite users like Misdreavus and Dusclops can't do. However, Gourgeist-XL has a lackluster Special Defense stat, and its typing leaves it weak to common special coverage moves such as Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Shadow Ball, meaning it is easily broken with such attacks. Its weakness to special attackers is exacerbated by its reliance on Foul Play and Will-O-Wisp, leaving it struggling to hurt them significantly. Gourgeist-XL is also very vulnerable to Toxic, which is commonly seen on attackers that aim to get around it, like Golem and Silvally-Fighting. Gourgeist-XL tends to lose momentum, as it lets in special breakers like Beheeyem and Swanna largely for free, forcing its team to play reactionary.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gourgeist-XL can function as a Trick Room setter for dedicated Trick Room teams, as it utilizes its excellent physical bulk to set up on a wide variety of threats before using Explosion to bring in a wallbreaker. However, Gourgeist-XL is outclassed by Dusknoir due to the latter's access to Z-Memento and the ability to break through Pawniard with Brick Break. In addition, it faces competition in this role from Carbink, which has access to Sturdy to nearly guarantee that Trick Room goes up. Gourgeist-XL can use Z-Trick-or-Treat to boost all of its stats and attempt to sweep, but due to its low Speed that leaves it unable to outspeed most Choice Scarf users even at +1 and lack of a good Ghost-type STAB move, with Phantom Force being its best option in a tier filled with Normal-types, there are Grass-types that utilize a similar strategy more effectively, such as other Gourgeist formes and Z-Celebrate Leafeon. Gourgeist-XL can utilize Toxic instead of Will-O-Wisp to wear down defensive Pokemon faster than a burn could, but the inability to severely cripple physical attackers makes this usually the inferior choice. Rocky Helmet can be used to punish U-turn users like Komala, but it leaves Gourgeist-XL weak to Knock Off and without passive recovery, making it less effective than the other item choices.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Silvally-Dragon, Mr. Mime, Swanna, and Beheeyem can all break through Gourgeist-XL by targeting its weaker defensive stat with powerful or super effective moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pokemon like Rapidash and Simisear are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can easily break through Gourgeist-XL with their super effective STAB moves, though they do not like being worn down by Leech Seed, Foul Play, and, in Rapidash's case, Flare Blitz recoil. Monferno and Combusken are especially notable for resisting Gourgeist-XL's only attacking move, allowing them to come in more easily.</p> <p><strong>Substitute and Taunt</strong>: Due to Gourgeist-XL's reliance on status moves, users of Substitute and Taunt like Vigoroth can easily cripple it and often set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Toxic very quickly wears down Gourgeist-XL, leaving it unable to answer the Pokemon it wants to answer, like specially defensive Komala. In a similar manner, entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes and pivoting moves like U-turn can whittle Gourgeist-XL down over time, allowing it to be broken eventually.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon like Rotom-S, Oricorio-F, and Swanna can switch into Gourgeist-XL with relative ease, especially since they are often special attackers, meaning they do not fear Will-O-Wisp or Foul Play, and threaten it with a super effective STAB move. Altaria can also beat Gourgeist-XL one-on-one with the combination of Toxic and Flamethrower.</p>",

      "Physically Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Foul Play is Gourgeist-XL's best offensive move, allowing to avoid relying on its own uninvested offensive stats and instead use those of its target, allowing it to 2HKO Komala and Electivire. Will-O-Wisp cripples the physical attackers Gourgeist-XL generally deals with while also whittling any target down. The combination of Will-O-Wisp and Foul Play also heavily discourages physical setup sweepers like Swords Dance Bouffalant and Silvally formes from switching in or setting up. Leech Seed provides Gourgeist-XL with passive recovery and slowly wears down foes. It also makes switching out to a teammate slightly easier, as they will get some health back after doing so. Seed Bomb is an alternative in the last slot to provide Gourgeist-XL with a STAB move, notably allowing it to OHKO Floatzel after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Colbur Berry allows Gourgeist-XL to consistently switch into Pokemon like Komala, as even Knock Off won't do much damage. Leftovers is an option over Colbur Berry to increase its longevity and allow it to not use Synthesis and Leech Seed as much, though it then takes a lot from Knock Off and thus becomes easier to take down. A Bold nature is usually preferred in order to lower the damage from opposing Foul Plays Play, although Impish should be used on Seed Bomb sets in order to avoid lowering the move's damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gourgeist-XL should be switched into physical attackers like Komala and Golem to prevent them from threatening its team, as it easily takes them on. In order to take these threats on, Gourgeist-XL needs to be healthy. Thus, especially if not running Leftovers, it is crucial to keep its health up with Synthesis and Leech Seed. If it is not needed to heal up, crippling a switch-in with Will-O-Wisp or Leech Seed is generally preferred over attacking with Foul Play, as this will make the foe easier to deal with for Gourgeist-XL's team. If a Pokemon immune to Will-O-Wisp or Leech Seed is predicted to come in, using the other one of the two or going for Foul Play is usually recommended. Note that Gourgeist-XL despises getting hit with Toxic, and since some Pokemon like Golem that it switches in on sometimes carry it, scouting their sets via use of Frisk and teammates is often recommended. Synthesis has low PP, so it is not recommended to use it as a method of PP stalling foes, and it should be used with care if the game is expected to go on for a long time, such as in a matchup between two defensive teams. While Gourgeist-XL can easily answer physical variants of Pokemon like Floatzel and Electivire, both of them can bust through it with special attacks in Ice Beam and Flamethrower, respectively. Thus, scouting their sets before blindly switching in is highly recommended.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Specially defensive Pokemon like Komala, Lickilicky, Muk, and Altaria can cover Gourgeist-XL's weaker Defense, while it covers physical attackers for them in return. Notably, Gourgeist-XL also covers Fighting-types like Silvally-Fighting for Komala and Lickilicky and Ground-types like Golem for Muk, while Altaria covers Fire-types for Gourgeist-XL. All four of these Pokemon can also absorb Toxic thanks to their typing, ability, or access to Heal Bell, which is very important for Gourgeist-XL. Since Fire-types like Rapidash and Simisear threaten Gourgeist-XL heavily, checks to them like Silvally-Water and Golem are solid teammates. In return, Gourgeist-XL switches into Grass-types like Leafeon that threaten them, while Golem also checks Flying-types. Similarly, checks to Ice-, Ghost-, and Dark-types like Rapidash, Silvally-Dark, and Silvally-Fighting are also all solid partners for Gourgeist-XL. Gourgeist-XL is one of the best spinblockers in the tier thanks to its high bulk, so Pokemon like Crustle greatly appreciate being paired with it. In return, Gourgeist-XL appreciates Crustle's Spikes to wear down opposing teams in tandem with Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed. Bronzor is an excellent teammate, as it is a great answer to Altaria, while Gourgeist-XL can absorb Knock Off. In general, Gourgeist-XL fits well on Fire / Grass / Water cores with the likes of the aforementioned Rapidash and Silvally-Water, as they all cover each others weaknesses quite well.</p>"

  "Toucannon": {
    "overview": "<p>A high Attack stat, a powerful STAB move in Brave Bird, and solid coverage moves such as Bullet Seed, Knock Off, and Brick Break allow Toucannon to break through various walls in the ZU metagame. It also has a pretty passable Special Attack stat, allowing it to use moves like Overheat. With access to Bullet Seed in particular, it can break through Golem, which many other attackers in the tier struggle to do. However, its base 60 Speed tier isn't the best to have and leaves it outsped by a lot of Pokemon, such as Electivire, Floatzel, and Zebstrika. In particular, most Volt Switch users outspeed Toucannon and can easily force it out. It's pretty frail as well, and with its Stealth Rock weakness and reliance on recoil moves, it can get worn down quite quickly. Lastly, it faces competition with Pokemon such as Choice Band Komala and Electivire as a wallbreaker, the former due to its much greater bulk and immunity to status and the latter for its great ability in Motor Drive, significantly better coverage, and much better Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toucannon has a decently sized movepool that includes some alternative options. A specially based mixed attacker set can be used with Boomburst, Heat Wave, Brave Bird, and Bullet Seed, allowing it to wallbreak without having to rely too much on Brave Bird, but this suffers from a worse matchup with Probopass and Bronzor. A Choice Scarf set can be utilized to let Toucannon do better against a lot of offensive threats in the metagame, but its Speed tier even with a Choice Scarf is underwhelming, and it fails to outspeed a lot of other common Choice Scarf users like Electivire. Most notably, it fails to outspeed particularly fast offensive threats like Floatzel and Zebstrika. Rock Blast offers coverage against Rotom-S, Crustle, and Shuckle and does better overall damage to Altaria. Roost can be used to heal off some recoil damage from Brave Bird and Life Orb from Toucannon, but Toucannon's frailty makes it a risky option, especially when it requires giving up one of Toucannon's coverage moves. Flyinium Z can be used to make Brave Bird into a powerful Supersonic Skystrike that lacks recoil but makes its other moves weaker overall. Swords Dance can be used to make Toucannon even stronger, but it is much too slow and frail to effectively set up. Lastly, Choice Band allows Toucannon to hit insanely hard but makes it very prediction reliant as well.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electivire, Raichu, and Zebstrika all outspeed Toucannon and easily KO it. Zebstrika with Sap Sipper additionally block Bullet Seed's use. Rotom-S in particular is a huge issue for Toucannon, since it takes little from Knock Off and resists Bullet Seed. In general, Toucannon is one of the biggest baits for Volt Switch from the majority of these Pokemon in the whole metagame.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While Toucannon can easily weaken Bronzor and Metang thanks to Knock Off, its four-moveslot syndrome means it can lack coverage against Pokemon such as Probopass and Mawile.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Low Speed and poor bulk leave Toucannon susceptible to revenge killers. In this regard, Pokemon such as Swanna, Rapidash, Floatzel, and Choice Band Komala are major concerns.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bullet Seed is used against bulky Rock- and Water-types such as Pyukumuku and Golem, breaking through the latter's Sturdy ability. It can also break through Focus Sash on Pokemon such as Kadabra and benefit from Skill Link. Knock Off allows Toucannon to get rid of items such as Eviolite from Pokemon like Bronzor and Mareanie, allowing them to be worn down far more easily. It can also 2HKO common Bronzor variants. U-turn uses Toucannon's offensive presence to gain momentum for its team. Alternatively, Overheat can be used to hit Mawile and weakened Grass-types such as Torterra and Gourgeist-XL when attempting to avoid recoil. Brick Break can also be used to hit Probopass, which otherwise completely walls this set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Skill Link is the ability of choice to enable Bullet Seed to hit five times, allowing it to viably break down targets of the move. An Adamant nature allows Toucannon to always OHKO Gourgeist-XL after Stealth Rock, as well as hit Altaria after it has used Roost due to Toucannon's low Speed. On the other hand, a Jolly nature allows Toucannon to outspeed Altaria before it can use Roost, though it is much less effective at wallbreaking. A Naughty or Naive nature can be used if Overheat is used in the fourth moveslot as to not lower its damage output when compared to Jolly or Adamant. 29 HP IVs give Toucannon the benefit of less recoil damage from Life Orb and less damage from Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's main use is to break down common walls in the ZU metagame such as Gourgeist-XL, Golem, and Bronzor to open holes in the opponent's team, which its teammates can take advantage of. Due to its mediocre Speed tier and bulk, it really needs the opportunity to be safely switched in. This can be done via Volt Switch or U-turn with Pokemon such as Probopass or Silvally-Fighting. Toucannon should use U-turn when you predict a Steel-type to switch in. It can then bring in a Magnet Pull user like Probopass or Alolan Golem to get rid of said Steel-types, which can be used to make Brave Bird usage more free for Toucannon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>To safely switch Toucannon in, it needs a U-turn or Volt Switch user. Probopass and Alolan Golem in particular are able to bring Toucannon in safely with a slow Volt Switch while also being able to trap Steel-types such as Mawile with Magnet Pull. A Pokemon that can effectively check Electric-types, such as Electivire, Golem, or Silvally-Ground, is key, as Toucannon has an overall bad matchup with Pokemon of that type. Due to Toucannon's low Speed and below average bulk, it appreciates having bulky teammates that can take on offensive threats in the metagame more easily. Examples of these include Silvally-Water, Muk, and Bronzor. Sticky Web setters such as Shuckle and Smeargle allow Toucannon to somewhat circumvent its mediocre Speed. However, one must note that Toucannon fails to outspeed threats such as Zebstrika and Floatzel after Sticky Web, even with a Jolly nature.</p>"

Moreover, Toxic Spikes can wear down Pokemon such as Pinsir, and Haze allows Mareanie to prevent Pokemon such as Combusken and Muk from setting up. Unfortunately, Mareanie is overwhelmingly passive and can easily be forced out by common Electric- and Ground-types such as Electivire, Zebstrika, and Golem. Its passivity also means that it becomes Taunt and setup bait to Pokemon such as Floatzel, Vigoroth, Substitute Swords Dance Bouffalant, and Calm Mind Kadabra, though it can somewhat mitigate being setup fodder thanks to Haze. In addition, Mareanie's passiveness is an invitation to strong wallbreakers such as Beheeyem. This confines its role as a bulky pivot to mostly Balance and Stall. Finally, Mareanie fears being hit by Knock Off, as it loses most of its bulk when Eviolite is removed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mareanie has no other viable options that wouldn't take away from its only set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mareanie struggles with Electric-types such as Electivire, Raichu, and Zebstrika due to their super effective STAB attacks.

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Recover is necessary for Mareanie so that it can continue pivoting and not have to rely on Regenerator. Scald is useful for its burn utility, as it discourages physical attackers such as Golem, Crustle, and Electivire from switching into Mareanie. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used to chip down Pokemon that Scald can't such as Floatzel, Silvally-Water, and Swanna. Mareanie tends to struggle with Taunt Floatzel, and Sludge Bomb allows Mareanie to beat it. Toxic Spikes allows Mareanie to wear down the opposing team and thus support its teammates. Thanks to Regenerator, Mareanie can set up Toxic Spikes consistently throughout the match, allowing constant pressure. Toxic can be run over Toxic Spikes in order to punish incoming switch-ins and Pokemon that try to use Mareanie as setup fodder. Haze prevents Mareanie from becoming setup fodder for a majority of the metagame's setup sweepers such as Combusken, Komala, Swords Dance Silvally-Fighting, and more. Knock Off is an option that allows Mareanie to cripple switch-ins such as Electivire. In addition, Knock Off is able to whittle down defensive Pokemon such as Altaria, Lickilicky, and Bronzor as well as remove helpful items such as Eviolite and Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>In order to maximize Mareanie's physical bulk, 248 HP and 252 Defense EVs are required. This allows Mareanie to more reliably check Pokemon such as Swords Dance Combusken. Alternatively, Mareanie can run a set consisting of 220 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature in order to better check Pokemon such as Swanna. Regenerator increases Mareanie's longevity and makes it much harder to wear down throughout the match. Eviolite is the only item Mareanie runs because of the buff it provides to Mareanie's defensive stats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mareanie should be brought in on Pokemon it walls such as Combusken, Silvally-Fighting, and Mawile. When in play, Mareanie should be setting up Toxic Spikes or firing off Scald or Sludge Bomb to fish for status or chip down wallbreakers that try to switch in. It's imperative that Mareanie stays healthy by utilizing Recover and Regenerator in order to maintain its role as a defensive pivot. When facing a setup sweeper, Mareanie should utilize Haze in order to negate the foe's stat changes. However, Mareanie may not be able to stomach boosted attacks from Pokemon such as Bouffalant and Pinsir, so it should mainly focus on setup sweepers it is able to check reliably such as Combusken and Swanna. Mareanie is incredibly reliant on its Eviolite, so it's important that moves like Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo from Pokemon like Komala, Rotom-S, and Floatzel aren't used on Mareanie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mareanie fits best on balanced and defensive teams due to its primarily passive nature and a handful of resistances. Entry hazard setters such as Golem, Crustle, and Bronzor wear down opposing offensive threats for Mareanie. Bronzor makes for a fantastic partner on both balance and defensive teams because Mareanie can check Pokemon like Combusken for Bronzor while Bronzor is able to check Golem and Zebstrika. Mareanie appreciates Pokemon that can switch into Electric- and Ground-type attacks such as Gourgeist-XL, Altaria, and Shiinotic. Pokemon that can switch into Knock Off such as Silvally formes and Z-Move users like Combusken, defensive Granbull, and Pinsir all pair well with Mareanie. Mareanie pairs well with Pokemon that discourage or negate hazard removal such as Pawniard, Servine, Purugly, Gourgeist-XL, and Dusclops, as Mareanie likes to whittle down the opposing team. Wallbreakers that appreciate Toxic Spikes support such as Pinsir, Floatzel, and Choice Band Komala all appreciate Mareanie as a defensive pivot. Gourgeist-XL makes for a great partner for Mareanie because it's able to check Ground-types and take advantage of Pokemon that rely on Knock Off as a coverage move. In return, Mareanie is able to check Pokemon like Combusken.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Shiinotic serves as a decent defensive Pokemon in ZU thanks to its typing, decent bulk, access to Strength Sap and Spore. Additionally, Effect Spore lets it reliably check many viable threats such as Silvally-Fighting, Silvally-Dark, Torterra, and Golem, while Spore can catch an incoming wallbreaker or setup sweeper off guard and put them to sleep. It's also able to spread status with Effect Spore to punish U-turn users like Silvally-Dark and Silvally-Dragon trying to pivot out. While Shiinotic mainly functions as a wall, it also threatens frailer Pokemon such as Crustle and Purugly with a moderately strong Moonblast and Giga Drain thanks to its decent attacking power, and, along with its naturally high Special Defense, it can soft check common special attackers like Silvally-Dragon, Simipour, and Kadabra, which further separates it from other defensive Grass-types in Gourgeist-XL and Torterra. However, it faces some stiff competition from them, since Torterra is able to provide Stealth Rock support, and Gourgeist-XL is able to further hinder physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp. For a physical wall, Shiinotic has mediocre physical bulk and cannot reliably switch into certain physical attackers that Gourgeist-XL can check like Marowak, Bouffalant, and Choice Band Komala, making it difficult for Shiinotic to fit onto teams sometimes. Furthermore, it can easily be worn down by entry hazards and chip damage, as it is one of the slowest Pokemon in the metagame. Strength Sap can also be exploited by the likes of Bronzor and Mareanie due to their low Attack stat, reducing how much health Shiinotic recovers. Shiinotic is also hard walled by threats like Bronzor, Muk, and Lickilicky, all of which either take it out completely or recover any damage dealt to them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fairium Z can be run to preserve Shiinotic's item when tanking a Knock Off as well as to OHKO potential switch-ins that are expecting a Strength Sap or Giga Drain like Pawniard and Combusken and heavily damage Sap Sipper switch-ins such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck. However, this does take up the Z-Move slot, is preferable on bulkier teams that do not have a better Z-Move user, and takes away the residual recovery that Shiinotic appreciates for its longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Threats like Muk and Silvally-Poison pose a problem for Shiinotic due to its gaping weakness to Poison. It must also be wary of being Toxic Spikes fodder for or taking a rare Sludge Bomb from Mareanie. Silvally-Poison and Mareanie don't like Spore, however.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon like Bronzor, offensive Mawile, Pawniard, Metang, and defensive Probopass all easily come in on either of Shiinotic's STAB moves and can OHKO it right back. Pawniard can even take advantage of Strength Sap and get a Defiant boost. None of them like being put to sleep with Spore, though.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon like Swanna, Rotom-S, Butterfree, and even Oricorio-F all have their ways with Shiinotic by taking it down with their respective STAB moves. However, they cannot switch into Shiinotic because of Spore, barring Swanna on rain teams.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Combusken, Rapidash, and Simisear give Shiinotic a hard time with their STAB moves and OHKO it easily.</p> <p><strong>Strength Sap Switch-ins</strong>: Weak walls like Mareanie and Bronzor can outstall and curb Shiinotic's recovery from Strength Sap, while Sap Sipper Bouffalant and Sawsbuck prevent recovery entirely. Defiant users such as Pawniard and Purugly can set up on predicted Strength Sap and fight back with STAB Iron Head and Return.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore cripples potential switch-ins like Swanna and Bronzor with sleep and debilitates special attacking switch-ins or walls that Gourgeist-XL can't touch. Strength Sap is Shiinotic's form of recovery and hinders physical attackers at the same time by weakening their attacks. Leech Seed is an option over Giga Drain to give Shiinotic a form of passive recovery while wearing the foe down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With the extra physical bulk, Shiinotic can survive one Return from Choice Band Komala and one Avalanche from Avalugg, while Leftovers gives it some passive recovery. Effect Spore has a chance to punish physical attackers like Silvally-Fighting and Silvally-Dark with status.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shiinotic is best used as a check to physical attackers with Effect Spore and as a means to put foes to sleep with Spore. The best way to utilize Effect Spore is to switch Shiinotic into common U-turn users like Silvally-Fighting and Silvally-Dark to cripple them with status. Shiinotic can do the same against common physical attackers like Machoke, Leafeon, and Torterra, but it should be wary of a Swords Dance-boosted Z-Move like Breakneck Blitz from Leafeon or Continental Crush from Torterra, as both will OHKO it. Strength Sap is best used when Shiinotic is low on HP or there's a physical wallbreaker on the opposing side of the field to recover its HP right back and hinder them. Since the EV spread focuses on physical bulk, keeping Shiinotic away from common special wallbreakers like Beheeyem and Choice Specs Exeggutor will allow it to do its job better in the long run. Shiinotic can be fairly predictable with either Strength Sap or Spore; threats like Komala, Vigoroth, and Grass-types can come in on a Spore and get a free turn, whereas Clear Body Pokemon like Metang avoid the Attack drop that comes with Strength Sap, so move prediction must be taken with care.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shiinotic fits best on a team that needs a defensive teammate that can absorb Knock Offs and plenty of U-turns from the opposing team. Therefore, teammates that appreciate Knock Off users like Machoke and Leafeon being gone, like Bronzor and Mareanie, appreciate Shiinotic's presence so they can benefit from their items much longer. Partners like Choice Band Komala, Metang, and Choice Band Golem help Shiinotic deal with Poison- and Steel-types that it doesn't like. Water-type walls like Mareanie and Poliwrath help check the physical Fire- and Steel-type attackers like Combusken, Rapidash, and Pawniard that Shiinotic can't handle; in return, it helps check Electric- and Grass-types. Since Shiinotic's special bulk is subpar, special walls like Lickilicky, Probopass, and Muk can all take hits for it and reliably recover any lost HP, while it can take the physical moves they can't. Shiinotic appreciates entry hazard removers like Komala and Mareanie because of its susceptibility to chip damage and Toxic Spikes. It also appreciates teammates like Electivire, Raichu, and Probopass that can handle Flying-types such as Swanna, Rotom-S, and Toucannon.</p>"

  "Pyukumuku": {
    "overview": "<p>Pyukumuku is the sole viable user of Unaware in ZU, which makes it a key Pokemon for stall teams. Unaware paired with impressive bulk allows Pyukumuku to confront a lot of Pokemon in the tier, such as Kecleon, Crustle, and Rapidash. However, Pyukumuku's shallow movepool doesn't pack any offensive move, making it unable to wall any Pokemon that packs Taunt or Substitute such as Floatzel or Vigoroth. This also means that Pyukumuku relies on Toxic and PP stalling to wear down opposing Pokemon. Its passive nature allows Pokemon such as Probopass and Komala to freely come on the field and set or remove entry hazards. Pyukumuku also has a hard time against a lot of wallbreakers such as Electivire and Pinsir because the former three have a super effective STAB move, whereas Mold Breaker Pinsir ignores Unaware.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Soak combined with Toxic can be run over Spite in order to remove the Toxic immunity from Steel- and Poison-types while also removing the foe's STAB boost. However, most Pokemon immune to Toxic aren't affected by the tactic; Probopass can just Volt Switch out, while Muk and Bronzor can use Rest. Furthermore, Komala's and Silvally-Poison's Toxic immunity can't be removed by Soak, and not running Spite leaves Pyukumuku unable to deal with Bulk Up Komala and Duosion. Specially defensive sets are also a possibility, though Pyukumuku's teammates such as Lickilicky, Muk, and Bronzor can cover special attackers. However, Pyukumuku can distinguish from other specially defensive walls because it learns Recover, whereas other specially defensive walls rely on shakier recovery moves in Wish and Rest. It also has a better matchup against specially offensive Water- and Fire-types such as Floatzel and Combusken. Counter allows Pyukumuku to have an offensive move that lets it act even if Taunted, but Pyukumuku lacks the room to pack this move. It also doesn't improve its matchup against special attackers such as Combusken and Beheeyem. Pyukumuku can run a support set with both dual screens and Memento, but this set is outclassed by Meowstic, which can more reliably the set up dual screens with Prankster and is less susceptible to Taunt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt and Substitute</strong>: Pyukumuku is forced to use Struggle if it gets Taunted. Therefore, any Pokemon that packs Taunt, such as Floatzel and Misdreavus, can beat Pyukumuku. Substitute users are also a major threat to Pyukumuku, since it can't break them and can only use Spite, such as against Vigoroth behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Electric- and Grass-types</strong>: Since Pyukumuku is weak to Grass- and Electric-type moves, Pokemon of these types, such as Electivire, Raichu, Zebstrika, and Leafeon can easily OHKO or 2HKO Pyukumuku.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers, such as Rampardos, Toucannon, and Raticate, can 2HKO Pyukumuku.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Mold Breaker users, such as Pinsir and Fraxure, ignore Unaware and can therefore break through it thanks to Swords Dance and Dragon Dance, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Natu</strong>: Thanks to its ability Magic Bounce, Natu is unaffected by all of Pyukumuku's moves and traps it with a bounced Block or badly poisons it with a bounced Toxic.</p>",

      "Unaware Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spite allows Pyukumuku to reliably PP stall Pokemon that it can't wear down with Toxic such as Komala, Muk, and Duosion. It's also Pyukumuku's sole move able to bypass Substitute. Toxic allows Pyukumuku to wear down Pokemon using less PP than with Spite. However, unlike Spite, Pokemon immune to Toxic such as Bronzor and Komala are common. Rest is a secondary recovery move that allows Pyukumuku to more reliably PP stall Pokemon that can't 3HKO it such as Floatzel and Bulk Up Komala. It also allows Pyukumuku to remove potential status, which allows it to beat Pokemon that rely on Toxic to break walls such as Regigigas. Block allows Pyukumuku to remove a Pokemon from the game, since it will lose its PP before Pyukumuku because of Spite, Rest, and the inability to switch to save PP. This also makes Toxic stalling more reliable, since the foe will lose more and more health at the end of each turn.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Unaware allows Pyukumuku to beat setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Komala and Swords Dance Combusken. Poisonium Z allows Pyukumuku to Toxic an opposing foe through Taunt. It also prevents Pyukumuku from suddenly becoming Choice-locked by Pokemon such as Switcheroo Floatzel. If Pyukumuku doesn't run Toxic, it can instead hold a Ghostium Z to still benefit from the immunity to Trick and Switcheroo and reduce Knock Off damage. It also provides Pyukumuku with one-time full recovery. Leftovers can be run over a Z-Crystal since it gives Pyukumuku passive recovery, which allows it to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Komala after Stealth Rock and the 3HKO from Duosion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch in Pyukumuku against Pokemon that can set up or can't 2HKO it, such as Crustle and Combusken. It's important from Team Preview to identify which opposing Pokemon is the most dangerous. Such Pokemon that must be trapped by Block will be the target of Pyukumuku's Z-Move in order to ease pressure off its teammates. Use Recover to keep Pyukumuku at full health to check threats such as Choice Band Komala. Switch out if the opposing Pokemon can 2HKO Pyukumuku or commonly packs Taunt or Substitute, such as Vigoroth or Regigigas. If the opposing Pokemon can 2HKO Pyukumuku, use Recover. Otherwise, it should use Block, Spite, or Toxic first and then Recover. If you know the foe can cripple Pyukumuku with Taunt, use Z-Toxic to bypass Taunt. The Defense boost is also nice, since it allows Pyukumuku to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Toucannon. However, since it can only be used once, it should not be prematurely wasted. Pyukumuku can use Rest to cure status such as poison; however, you shouldn't do this if Pyukumuku needs to be awake to take on an opposing Pokemon. Rest also improves Pyukumuku's effectiveness at PP stalling, and if the opposing Pokemon can't 3HKO Pyukumuku, using Rest will allow Pyukumuku to use less PP than the foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pyukumuku's passive nature limits it to only fitting on stall teams. If used in another archetype, Pyukumuku drains to much momentum and invites some threats to freely come on the field. Lickilicky is Pyukumuku's partner of choice because of its ability to take on special attackers and immunity to Taunt. It can also remove Pyukumuku's status thanks to Heal Bell. Pokemon such as Altaria, Avalugg, Bronzor, and Gourgeist-XL that can take on offensive Grass-types are potent teammates. Pokemon immune to Electric that can beat Electric-types and disturb VoltTurn cores such as Silvally-Ground are great partners. Entry hazard control is a requirement on any stall team; for example, with Stealth Rock up, Pyukumuku is unable to switch into Choice Band Komala. Good hazard removers on stall include Altaria, Avalugg, Silvally-Ground, and Silvally-Dark. Natu is also a great teammate for its ability to bounce Taunt back. If holding a Z-Crystal, Pyukumuku becomes a sufficient Knock Off absorber, which is appreciated by Pokemon that hold Eviolite such as Bronzor.</p>"

  "Silvally": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to a relatively high Speed tier, reasonable bulk, and a powerful STAB move in Double-Edge, Silvally is able to act as an offensive check to top threats in the metagame, with its Speed tier placing it above a variety of fast sweepers including Rock Polish Torterra, Combusken, and Z-Encore Chatot. Access to U-turn allows Silvally to quickly gain momentum for its team and solidifies it as one of the best Choice Scarf users in the tier. Silvally can also viably run a Swords Dance set with a Z-Crystal to break through bulkier Pokemon like Sandslash and Silvally-Fighting that are ordinarily used to check the Choice Scarf variant. However, using Silvally prevents other Silvally formes with more defensive utility such as Silvally-Fighting and Silvally-Dark from being used, making it difficult to fit on teams. Silvally is also somewhat reliant on its Normal-type moves to do damage and has a hard time dealing with common Pokemon that resist or are immune to them like Golem, Mawile, and Gourgeist-XL as a result. In addition, a weakness to entry hazards alongside recoil from Double-Edge can lead to Silvally being quickly worn down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Silvally can opt to use a special Choice Scarf set with Hyper Voice / Surf / Ice Beam / U-turn. However, the drop in power is very noticeable, leaving Silvally more reliant on its coverage moves to do damage and opening it up to being taken advantage of by a variety of Pokemon with high Special Defense such as Kecleon, specially defensive Mareanie, and Lickilicky. Defog can also be used over Ice Beam or Surf to provide entry hazard removal in emergency scenarios; however, a weakness to Toxic Spikes and inability to touch Golem, Crustle, and other entry hazard setters without the coverage provided by Surf or Ice Beam make Silvally an inadequate form of entry hazard control. Silvally can use U-turn on the Swords Dance set to bluff a Choice Scarf set and claim chip damage on switch-ins, but the additional utility provided by Explosion and Flame Charge is preferred. Silvally can use Psychium Z alongside Heal Block to increase its Special Attack by two stages and prevent the foe from using healing moves until it switches, giving Silvally a strong matchup against passive Pokemon like Pyukumuku, Bronzor, and Mareanie. Z-Heal Block can only be used once per game, however, and such a set has a hard time breaking through particularly bulky Pokemon such as Lickilicky. This set is also heavily reliant on Z-Heal Block to do damage and, as such, is unreliable against more offensive teams where Silvally is unable to find time to set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Machoke, Granbull, and Golem can use their bulk and typing to switch directly into Silvally and threaten it, although Golem has to be wary of being caught by Silvally's coverage options in Surf and Ice Beam, and Granbull is unable to take a +1 Breakneck Blitz without significant defensive investment.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mawile, Metang, Probopass, and Bronzor take virtually nothing from Choice Scarf Silvally's attacks and can take advantage of Silvally's presence to set up Stealth Rock or spread status with Toxic. Metang and Bronzor have to be careful of boosted Crunch, however.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While Gourgeist-XL cannot comfortably switch into Ice Beam, both it and Dusclops do a fantastic job of deterring Choice Scarf Silvally from locking into Double-Edge thanks to their immunity to Normal-type moves. Both Pokemon can also absorb boosted Crunch and cripple Silvally in return with Will-O-Wisp, with Gourgeist-XL in particular being able to tank Silvally's hits thanks to its use of Colbur Berry and further punish it with Foul Play and Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Silvally's lack of recovery leaves it vulnerable to residual damage from Toxic Spikes, Rocky Helmet, and status moves such as Toxic. Burns, in particular, hamper Silvally and can often be activated indirectly by abilities and moves such as Flame Body from Rapidash and Scald from Mareanie.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is the STAB move of choice due to the great damage output it can provide, securing OHKOs on Combusken and Rapidash after Stealth Rock damage. U-turn provides Silvally with a way to quickly gain momentum and pivot out of unfavorable matchups against physically defensive Pokemon like Machoke and Mawile. Explosion heavily damages bulky Pokemon such as Silvally-Fighting and Bouffalant and allows Silvally to avoid setup sweepers that may look to take advantage of it being locked into Double-Edge. Surf allows Silvally to revenge kill Shell Smash Crustle while also doing heavy damage to Golem, securing an OHKO on offensive variants after their Sturdy has been broken. Alternatively, Ice Beam not only hits Normal-type checks such as Golem and Gourgeist-XL but also Grass-type sweepers such as Leafeon and Rock Polish Torterra, although Silvally becomes unable to meaningfully hurt Crustle without Surf.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature should be used with Surf to avoid compromising Silvally's bulk, as Silvally is unable to OHKO Crustle even when using a Naive nature. A Naive nature is preferred when using Ice Beam, however, as the higher damage output allows Silvally to 2HKO Gourgeist-XL and defensive Golem after Stealth Rock damage and gives Silvally a 50% chance to OHKO Rock Polish Torterra after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Silvally does have respectable bulk, it's important to conserve its health as much as possible and avoid situations where it could be chipped into KO range of faster moves, such as +2 Aqua Jet or rain-boosted Surf from Swanna's Z-Mirror Move and Z-Rain Dance sets, respectively. To this end, keep the foe's health in mind when revenge killing with Silvally; it is often best to avoid recoil and opt for U-turn instead of Double-Edge if both moves will finish off a foe such as a weakened Simisage or Leafeon. Be careful when locking into Surf or Ice Beam, as they output underwhelming damage without a type advantage and, as such, can give setup opportunities to powerful sweepers like Bellossom and Combusken, respectively. While Double-Edge is notably stronger than these moves, it can also be taken advantage of by Rock-, Steel-, and Ghost-types, particularly setup sweepers like Pawniard and Shell Smash Crustle, so Explosion should sometimes be used to finish off a foe without losing momentum. Try to avoid using Explosion unless it's necessary, however, or Silvally is likely to be KOed regardless, such as by the foe or by recoil from Double-Edge. Silvally's main goal is to revenge kill foes, but it can also act as a strong late-game cleaner. As a result, avoid using Silvally early-game until it's either in a strong position to finish off a weakened team or necessary to revenge kill a foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally appreciates entry hazard support from Stealth Rock users like Mawile and Marowak, putting foes in KO range of its coverage and allowing it to put additional pressure on an opponent with U-turn. Torterra is an especially notable partner, as it is also able to switch into and heavily pressure traditional Normal-type checks such as defensive Mawile and Golem. Similarly, entry hazard removal can help keep Silvally healthy throughout a match, with Rotom-S and Swanna being examples of fantastic partners for this. The former is able to lure in Golem before crippling it with Will-O-Wisp and can soak up Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Machoke and Choice Scarf Electivire, while the latter can more easily break down Rock-, Ghost-, and Steel-types like Shuckle, Gourgeist-XL, and Mawile. Other Pokemon including Leafeon, Pawniard, and Rapidash that can break down Rock-, Ghost-, and Steel-types also make for great partners for Silvally, and they can use the U-turn support that it provides to find more opportunities to exert pressure on the opposing team and facilitate a late-game cleanup. Lastly, Silvally can create efficient VoltTurn cores alongside other pivots such as Monferno and the aforementioned Rotom-S, steadily wearing down foes and putting them in KO range of Silvally's Double-Edge.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Double-Edge is Silvally's most reliable damage option, notably allowing it to secure KOs on Pokemon such as Silvally-Dragon and non-physically defensive Poliwrath after a Swords Dance boost and Stealth Rock damage. Return is a safe alternative STAB option that does not inflict recoil. Crunch covers Ghost-types in addition to Psychic-types, particularly those that resist Normal-type moves like Bronzor and Metang. Flame Charge allows Silvally to raise its Speed and outspeed Choice Scarf users like Rotom-S and Pinsir in addition to naturally faster Pokemon like Floatzel while also hitting Steel-types like Mawile for moderate damage. Alternatively, Explosion trades the ability to boost Speed for a slightly stronger Breakneck Blitz and allows Silvally to function as a stronger wallbreaker, powering through defensive tanks like physically defensive Poliwrath. Shadow Claw can be used over Crunch to circumvent Colbur Berry users such as Gourgeist-XL, but it has a notably lower damage output outside of this niche.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Normalium Z turns Double-Edge, Explosion, or Return into Breakneck Blitz, avoiding the negative secondary effects in the case of the former two moves and allowing Silvally to take out defensive targets such as Sandslash, Silvally-Fighting, and Rotom-S after a Swords Dance boost. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Silvally to Speed tie with opposing Silvally formes, Leafeon, and Electivire.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally is vulnerable to being worn down by chip damage, particularly if it is using Double-Edge, so bringing it onto the field with slow pivots and double switches is ideal. While Silvally can threaten out passive Pokemon to set up Swords Dance, one must be careful of status, particularly burn and poison, from the likes of Mareanie and Altaria that may cripple Silvally and limit it to being used as a one-time wallbreaker. Aim to preserve Silvally's Breakneck Blitz until it's necessary to take out a specific target, such as defensive Silvally-Fighting, or to avoid fainting due to recoil damage from Double-Edge. Crunch can be used to catch Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Dusclops and Bronzor on the switch to weaken them for a later sweep. When possible, Flame Charge should be used to finish off a weakened target or after setting up. Explosion can be used to take out bulkier Pokemon such as Bouffalant and Exeggutor. This can be used when Silvally is expected to faint or simply to open the door for a teammate like Bellossom to take advantage of.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Even after a Swords Dance boost, Silvally can struggle to break past Steel- and Rock-types like Mawile and Golem, so Pokemon that can handle them like Sandslash, Torterra, and Simisage are beneficial. Stealth Rock support from Sandslash and Torterra also helps Silvally secure OHKOs on Pokemon like Leafeon and Muk with Double-Edge after a Swords Dance boost. Pivots like Volt Switch Rotom-S and U-turn Monferno can give Silvally free entry while also pressuring Pokemon like Mawile and Gourgeist-XL that give Silvally trouble. Alolan Golem and Probopass are especially notable as Volt Switch pivots that can also trap Steel-types with Magnet Pull. Silvally is prone to being worn down by entry hazards, so Pokemon that can clear them such as Swanna, Rotom-S, and Sandslash are valuable partners. Toxic Spikes in particular give Silvally trouble, so absorbers such as Mareanie and Muk should also be considered. Flying- and Poison-types such as Rotom-S, Mareanie, and Muk are also notable for pressuring Fighting-type Pokemon like Silvally-Fighting and Poliwrath for Silvally, chipping them into KO range of its Double-Edge. All of these Pokemon also check Gourgeist-XL, one of Silvally's most troublesome foes.</p>"

It also has utility options other Silvally formes possess such as the ability to pivot and remove entry hazards from play. However, Silvally-Dark is limited to a utility role due to the immense competition it faces as a Swords Dance Dark-type from Pawniard. Furthermore, Silvally-Dark doesn't have access to Knock Off, a staple for most other Dark-types, meaning it can't remove items from Pokemon such as Bronzor and Mareanie. Silvally-Dark also unfortunately draws in wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Pinsir, Shell Smash Crustle, Silvally-Fighting, and Combusken due to its limited coverage options.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance variants can forgo Pursuit for Zen Headbutt as coverage for Muk and Fighting-types such as Silvally-Fighting, Machoke, and Monferno. However, this set not only faces competition with other Swords Dance Dark-types such as Pawniard but also loses one-on-one to most physical walls, including Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL. Furthermore, utilizing a Swords Dance set draws attention away from Silvally-Dark's most defining feature: being the best Pursuit trapper the metagame has to offer. Silvally-Dark can also utilize a more defensively inclined EV spread and moveset of Rest, Toxic, Defog, and Multi-Attack to function as a dedicated Psychic-type check. However, while this is an extremely important function for stall teams, Silvally-Dark is considerably passive and has to utilize Rest as its only form of recovery. Additionally, Silvally-Dark almost always has to be used in tandem with a secondary entry hazard remover due to its susceptibility of being worn down fast while asleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Silvally-Fighting, Machoke, and Combusken resist all of Silvally-Dark's moves and can use it as setup opportunity to acquire boosts from Swords Dance, Bulk Up, or Speed Boost.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Granbull and Carbink resist Multi-Attack, Pursuit, and U-turn and threaten it out with their respective STAB moves. Mawile can also set Stealth Rock up again as Silvally-Dark Defogs and pivots out with the looming threat of Play Rough or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Walls</strong>: Physical walls, especially those with reliable recovery options such as Gourgeist-XL and Altaria, can be incredibly hard for Silvally-Dark to defeat on its own.</p> <p><strong>Pinsir and U-turn users</strong>: Pinsir can utilize Silvally-Dark as means of setting up with either Z-Me First or Swords Dance, while other U-turn users such as Choice Band Komala and Silvally-Ground can severely dent Silvally-Dark.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to its lack of reliable recovery options and having to switch into entry hazards every time to remove them from play, Silvally-Dark can easily fall victim the being worn down over time.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Multi-Attack is Silvally-Dark's strongest and most reliable STAB option, hitting Pokemon such as Bronzor and Beheeyem super effectively. Pursuit weakens the Pokemon Silvally-Dark forces out such as Exeggutor and the aforementioned Bronzor and Beheeyem. Parting Shot allows Silvally-Dark to pivot out of Pokemon it has a bad matchup against such as Granbull, Silvally-Fighting, and Pinsir while lowering their power, easing switches. Alternatively, U-turn can be used to a similar effect, trading the defensive utility offered by Parting Shot for chip damage on the opponent while also bypassing Defiant users such as Pawniard. Defog removes entry hazards for teammates such as Electivire, Swanna, and Mareanie. Swords Dance can also be run if Defog is not needed to allow Silvally-Dark to become the strongest Pursuit user in the tier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred to allow Silvally-Dark to Speed tie with other offensive Silvally formes and non-Choice Scarf Electivire, as well as outspeed Pokemon such as Misdreavus.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally-Dark doesn't have any reliable recovery options, and therefore it should be played conservatively, only switching in to take resisted hits, absorb Knock Offs, Pursuit trap weakened foes, and remove entry hazards. Silvally-Dark should pivot out of Pokemon it outspeeds and has a bad matchup against to conserve momentum and its health. Notably, Silvally-Dark has a rough matchup versus common entry hazard setters such as Golem, Crustle, and Mawile and should focus on pivoting in a teammate that has a better matchup against such threats. If you predict a Pokemon such as Bronzor to switch out, use Pursuit. If you believe it's going to stay in predicting the Pursuit and Silvally-Dark can't afford to be induced with Toxic status or have Stealth Rock be put up again, use Multi-Attack. Be wary of Focus Sash + Counter Kadabra when deciding whether or not to Pursuit trap it, if applicable.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Pursuit trapped targets being removed such as Exeggutor and Choice Band Golem benefit from having Silvally-Dark as a teammate. Silvally-Dark appreciates having checks to Pinsir such as Gourgeist-XL and Simisear on its side, as it eases pressure off of it to continue to remove entry hazards and Pursuit trap foes. Gourgeist-XL also happens to be a fantastic switch-in to Silvally-Fighting, while Simisear appreciates the removal of Stealth Rock Silvally-Dark provides. Beyond just Gourgeist-XL, however, Silvally-Dark also appreciates Fighting-type switch-ins such Altaria, physically defensive Beheeyem, and Granbull. In the same vein, additional Pokemon that appreciate the removal of entry hazards include Electivire, Swanna, and Rapidash. Silvally-Dark isn't the greatest entry hazard remover considering its lack of reliable recovery options and susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards. Therefore, Silvally-Dark can be used alongside another entry hazard remover such as the aforementioned Altaria or Swanna as a secondary means of entry hazard removal.</p>"

  "Silvally-Dragon": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its good defenses, powerful Draco Meteor, and access to U-turn, Silvally-Dragon is a potent pivot for bulky offensive and hyper offensive teams. Silvally-Dragon can circumvent the few Fairy- and Steel-types in the tier such as Mr. Mime and Bronzor with U-turn and Flamethrower, respectively. Because of the low number of Dragon-types in ZU, Silvally-Dragon doesn't face a lot of competition as an offensive Dragon-type. Silvally-Dragon's resistances to common types in ZU in Water, Grass, Electric, and Fire let it switch into a lot of common Pokemon such as Mareanie, Leafeon, Electivire, and Rapidash. Silvally-Dragon can threaten certain entry hazard setters, such as Golem and Mawile, which makes it a great hazard remover. However, it faces competition from other Silvally formes, such as Water, Fighting, and Ghost, for a team slot because, unlike them, Silvally-Dragon lacks the ability to switch into offensive threats such as Floatzel and Komala reliably. Moreover, they have access to more reliable STAB moves. It is also difficult for Silvally-Dragon to effectively break Bronzor and Probopass, two common hazard setters, because they resist Silvally-Dragon's STAB move and avoid the 2HKO from Flamethrower. Despite being a strong nuke, Draco Meteor isn't spammable due to the Special Attack drop, which forces Silvally-Dragon to switch out and can offer setup opportunities to the opponent. Silvally-Dragon is usually sent on the field to soft check foes, and this, coupled with the total absence of recovery, makes it easy to wear down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Silvally-Dragon can run a Swords Dance set thanks to its wide physical movepool including a STAB move in Multi-Attack, coverage for Fairy-types in Iron Head, which is Silvally-Dragon's only way to pressure Carbink, and coverage for Steel-types in Flame Charge, which also boosts Silvally-Dragon's Speed, increasing its cleaning capacities. At +1 Speed, Silvally-Dragon Speed ties with Choice Scarf Electivire, Sawsbuck, and Silvally and outspeeds Floatzel, Chatot, and Mr Mime. However, it faces a lot of competition from other physical Dragon-types such as Fraxure and Hakamo-o, as they have access to a superior setup move in Dragon Dance. Also, the former has far more raw power, while the latter has a better secondary typing and the bulk to use Dragon Dance several times. Also, physical sets struggle even more against Steel-types due to having a weaker Fire-type coverage, making them even easier to punish than sets with Draco Meteor. These sets also have to forgo Silvally-Dragon's utility in entry hazard removal. Silvally-Dragon can run a bulkier EV spread to better take on offensive threats such as Floatzel and Combusken; however, this hinders its offense capacities and is not worth it most of the time. If you already have hazard removal or don't need it, you can run a non-Defog Silvally-Dragon with Flash Cannon to deal with Fairy-types such as Granbull and Mr. Mime or Explosion to weaken specially bulky Pokemon such as Komala and Kecleon. However, these moves are pretty niche compared to the utility Defog brings.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types, such as Mr. Mime and Granbull, are immune to Silvally-Dragon's STAB Draco Meteor and don't take much damage from Flamethrower. Furthermore they can retaliate with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: A lot of Pokemon such as Floatzel and Electivire carry an Ice-type move, which can significantly damage Silvally-Dragon.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Due to its average Special Attack, specially bulky Pokemon such as Kecleon, Muk, and Lickilicky take little damage from Silvally-Dragon's moves. Moreover, Lickilicky can cripple it with Toxic, whereas Muk and Komala can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Silvally-Dragon struggles to break through bulky Steel-types such as Bronzor and Probopass, which resist Silvally-Dragon's STAB attacks. They can set entry hazards, use Toxic, or, in the case of Probopass, pivot with a slow Volt Switch. However, if there is a Magnet Pull user on Silvally-Dragon's team such as Alolan Golem or Probopass, they have to worry about Silvally-Dragon pivoting into it.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Silvally-Dragon's lack of recovery and tendency to switch several times through the game make it easily worn down by chip damage such as from hazards, hail, and VoltTurn and limit Silvally-Dragon's soft checking capacities.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is a powerful STAB move and is only resisted by few Pokemon in ZU. This move can remove a lot of foes after chip damage, such as Electivire and Swanna. Flamethrower is Silvally-Dragon's best coverage move. Indeed, the Dragon and Fire combination hits the entire tier outside of Carbink for at least neutral damage. It also allows Silvally-Dragon to hit Steel-types, such as Mawile and Pawniard, for super effective damage. Silvally-Dragon can pivot through U-turn. It allows for scouting an opposing switch and chips the opposing team. It can also threaten Pokemon weak to Bug, such as Grumpig. Silvally-Dragon can instead run Parting Shot, which swaps the chip damage for lowering foe's offenses, which lets the next Pokemon take less damage as it switches in. However, it's easily blocked and punished by Soundproof, Clear Body, and Defiant users, such as Mr. Mime, Regice, and Pawniard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A positive Speed nature allows Silvally-Dragon to Speed tie with other base 95 Speed Pokemon such as other offensive Silvally formes, Electivire, and Leafeon. Moreover, it allows Silvally-Dragon to outspeed dangerous wallbreakers such as Monferno, Oricorio-F, and Servine and threaten them back.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch only into resisted moves, such as Electivire's Wild Charge and Leafeon's Leaf Blade, or weak moves, such as Mawile's Knock Off. Silvally-Dragon can also be brought into the field by slow pivots such as Komala and Probopass. If Silvally-Dragon checks are weaken or removed, use Draco Meteor to deal huge amounts of damage to the opposing team. Silvally-Dragon shouldn't be directly switched into entry hazard setters to use Defog. It should instead use Defog on forced switches, which are not hard to pull off due to Draco Meteor's raw power. Silvally-Dragon's Flamethrower isn't powerful and should only be used against Pokemon that are weak to Fire such as Bronzor, Mawile, and Pawniard. You should also keep in mind that a super effective Flamethrower is weaker than a neutral STAB Draco Meteor. If you predict your opponent to switch out into a check to Silvally-Dragon, you can pivot with either U-turn or Parting Shot to maintain momentum or use Defog to remove entry hazards on your side. Using Draco Meteor lowers Silvally-Dragon's Special Attack by two stages, decreasing Silvally-Dragon's offensive capacities a lot and forcing it out. A weakened Silvally-Dragon is setup fodder for a lot of threatening sweepers, such as Shell Smash Crustle and Z-Me First Pinsir. Therefore, don't use Draco Meteor if your opponent can then send a setup sweeper that has the potential to clean your team. Because of this, Flamethrower is a safe neutral play to remove a weakened foe or hit a foe that avoids the OHKO from Draco Meteor and falls to two Flamethrowers such as Gourgeist-XL.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards such as Rapidash and Pinsir appreciate Silvally-Dragon's Defog support. Silvally-Dragon's U-turn or Parting Shot allows strong but slow wallbreakers such as Komala to come safely on the field. They can also take advantage of the special walls that Silvally-Dragon brings onto the field. Silvally-Dragon performs well with other VoltTurn users such as Komala and Electivire, forming a VoltTurn core. Silvally-Dragon struggling against bulky Steel-types makes Magnet Pull users such as Alolan Golem and Probopass very potent partners, as Silvally-Dragon can just pivot as a Steel-type switches in and bring in the Magnet Pull user to remove the bulky Steel-type. Pokemon that are weak to Fire-, Grass-, and Electric-types such as Leafeon, Floatzel, and Oricorio-F appreciate Silvally-Dragon's resistances and ability to come into moves of said types. Teammates that resist Ice, such as bulky Monferno and Mareanie, are appreciated for their ability to switch into Pokemon that carry strong Ice moves such as Glaceon.</p>"

  "Silvally-Electric": {
    "overview": "<p>While Silvally-Electric faces significant competition from Electric-types such as Rotom-S and Electivire and other Silvally formes such as Dragon, Dark, Water, and Fighting, it has a few traits that help set it apart. Silvally-Electric provides great role compression, being able to check Water- and Flying-types such as Swanna, Mareanie, Rotom-S, and Toucannon and provide both Defog and pivoting support. Moreover, Silvally-Electric 2HKOes most Ground-types with Ice Beam, something other Electric-types typically cannot do. Alternatively, with Toxic and Protect, Silvally-Electric acts as a great scout against Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Electivire and is able to whittle down much of the metagame at the cost of significantly less utility without U-turn and Defog. However, the Silvally formes mentioned earlier tend to overshadow Silvally-Electric due to its comparatively lower defensive utility and effectiveness as a Defogger. Similarly, Rotom-S gives Silvally-Electric heavy competition because it defensively checks a wider range of threats thanks to its Flying typing and ability to hold an item for passive recovery. Silvally-Electric also lacks recovery and is affected by all forms of entry hazards, which make it worse as an entry hazard remover compared to Pokemon such as Altaria, Swanna, and Komala. In addition to other Silvally formes and Rotom-S, Electric-types such as Electivire and Raichu give Silvally-Electric competition as well due to their ability to hold an item and act as revenge killers and breakers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower is an option over Defog on the first set if your team struggles with Pokemon such as Pinsir, Metang, and Pawniard and already has an entry hazard remover, but an all-out attacking set is usually outdone by Expert Belt Electivire. Silvally-Electric can run a bulkier spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe on the Defog set to better check threats such as Swanna and Toucannon, but the lack of Special Attack investment leaves Silvally-Electric easily walled and worse off against Water-types such as Mareanie and Poliwrath.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While most Ground-types are 2HKOed by Ice Beam and fear Toxic, Pokemon such as Golem, Silvally-Ground, Camerupt, and Sandslash can tank an Ice Beam and threaten to KO Silvally-Electric back.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Electivire, mixed Simisage, Kadabra, and Dugtrio threaten to OHKO Silvally-Electric after it has been weakened.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Bronzor, Lickilicky, and Dusclops wall Silvally-Electric and are immune to Toxic, have Heal Bell, or have Rest to play around Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Silvally-Electric is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and lacks recovery, which make it especially prone to being worn down.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam provides excellent coverage alongside Thunderbolt and enables Silvally-Electric to threaten Ground-, Dragon-, and Grass-types such as Golem, Silvally-Dragon, and Leafeon. U-turn allows Silvally-Electric to generate momentum against Pokemon it cannot break through such as Lickilicky and Bronzor as well as against Pokemon it forces out such as defensive Rotom-S and Poliwrath. Parting Shot can be used over U-turn to more easily bring in teammates, but without U-turn, Silvally-Electric cannot heavily damage or scout damage to predict the sets of Exeggutor, Komala, and Camerupt.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and a Timid nature allow Silvally-Electric to outspeed Pokemon such as Chatot and Mr. Mime while also Speed tying with opposing offensive Silvally formes and Leafeon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally-Electric should focus on pivoting and bringing teammates in safely. Preserve Silvally-Electric's health in order for it to pivot throughout the course of a game effectively. Avoid switching it into Toxic Spikes or attacks it does not resist, and be mindful of chip damage from resisted attacks such as Rotom-S's Air Slash, Electivire's Wild Charge, and Swanna's Brave Bird. Silvally-Electric must remain healthy enough to check setup sweepers such as Z-Mirror Move Swanna and Swords Dance Bibarel in a pinch. Silvally-Electric should use U-turn on bulkier switch-ins such as Assault Vest Kecleon and Muk that its teammates can take advantage of. Because Silvally-Electric cannot switch into entry hazard setters such as Golem, Torterra, and Bronzor, it should use Defog on Pokemon it checks and on forced switches against Pokemon such as Mareanie, Altaria, and Oricorio-F. Silvally-Electric must weigh the pros and cons of removing entry hazards or chipping away at its switch-ins; Ice Beam nails offensive switch-ins such as Silvally-Ground and Marowak, while defensive switch-ins such as Bronzor, Camerupt, and Muk are better targets for U-turn and Defog.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Electric best fits on balance and offensive teams that need an Electric-type to check Pokemon such as Swanna, Poliwrath, and Rotom-S and a pivot and Defogger in one slot. Setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Simipour, Swords Dance Pawniard, and Swords Dance Leafeon appreciate Silvally-Electric's ability to check Water- and Flying-types such as Mareanie, Poliwrath, Swanna, and Rotom-S. Similarly, wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Simisear, mixed Simisage, and Marowak appreciate Silvally-Electric's ability to pivot. Pokemon that can check Ground-types such as Stealth Rock Torterra, Gourgeist-XL, and defensive Poliwrath are great partners for Silvally-Electric. In return, Silvally-Electric provides Defog support to help keep them healthy. Additional pivots alongside Silvally-Electric such as Choice Band Furfrou, Choice Specs Chatot, and U-turn Monferno make for fantastic partners to keep up momentum.</p>"

      "Toxic + Protect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic is used to put switch-ins such as Lickilicky, Electivire, and Silvally-Ground on a timer. On top of racking up poison damage, Protect allows Silvally-Electric to scout out Choice item users such as Choice Scarf Electivire, Choice Specs Beheeyem, and Choice Band Komala. Ice Beam provides great neutral coverage alongside Thunderbolt and helps Silvally-Electric threaten Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Marowak, and Altaria.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature ensure Silvally-Electric can 2HKO foes such as Mareanie and Rotom-S and Speed tie with opposing Silvally formes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Silvally-Electric set is best used to Toxic stall and scout out Choice item users. Silvally-Electric should spread Toxic early-game, crippling foes so that its team can more easily break apart teams. Once Ground-, Dragon-, and Grass-types have been hit with Toxic, it is easier to make aggressive predictions with Ice Beam to nab 2HKOs. Protect is used for scouting, so be sure to scout foes in order to ease prediction the following turn. Scouting with Protect is usually free against Pokemon such as Assault Vest Kecleon and Electivire, as they do not run setup moves and you can find out their coverage moves. Protect is also useful to reduce damage against Z-Move users such as Rain Dance Swanna and Exeggutor, which is useful for preserving Silvally-Electric's health. Silvally-Electric needs to remain healthy in order to scout and Toxic stall effectively, so avoid switching it into unresisted attacks, and be mindful of the chip damage from resisted attacks. However, Protect has consequences against setup sweepers and walls such as Swords Dance Bouffalant, Shell Smash Crustle, and Heal Bell Lickilicky that can take advantage of the free turn. In these situations, play more aggressively and weaken setup Pokemon with Thunderbolt and switch in wallbreakers on the turns walls use to heal.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Silvally-Electric set works best on balance and semi-stall teams because of its ability to Toxic stall, act as a scout, and soft check Water- and Flying-types. Setup sweepers that appreciate Ground-, Grass-, and Dragon-types being crippled by Toxic such as Shell Smash Crustle, Nasty Plot Simisage, and Swords Dance Combusken pair well with this set. On bulkier teams, Silvally-Electric needs partners that support it defensively. Defensive Pokemon such as Bronzor, Gourgeist-XL, and Marowak are able to check Pokemon Silvally-Electric has trouble with, such as Exeggutor, Bouffalant, and Golem. Similarly, clerics such as Wish Lickilicky and Heal Bell Altaria pair well with Silvally-Electric because it easily worn down and vulnerable to status. Entry hazard removers such as Swanna, Komala, and Sandslash are a necessity alongside Silvally-Electric because it is worn down by all forms of entry hazards and lacks recovery.</p>"

  "Silvally-Fighting": {
    "overview": "<p>Silvally-Fighting's high Speed tier, adequate offense, good coverage, and access to Defog and two pivot moves in Parting Shot and U-turn make it a very solid pick for many teams in ZU. A good matchup against the tier's most common entry hazard setter in Golem and a resistance to Stealth Rock notably make Silvally-Fighting one of the best entry hazard removers in ZU. Its capability as a Defog user is further enhanced by its ability to deal with the tier's most common Defiant users in Pawniard and Purugly thanks to its STAB Multi-Attack. Furthermore, with Swords Dance, Silvally-Fighting can boost its Attack to high levels, making it a frightening late-game cleaner if it has not been revealed. These factors combine to make Silvally-Fighting one of the stronger Silvally forme in ZU. However, it is still worn down when switching into attacks because of its inability to hold Leftovers and a lack of recovery. Bronzor hurts Silvally-Fighting's ability to break the opposing team, and it needs Shadow Claw or Crunch to deal meaningful damage to Bronzor. Muk and Mareanie also get free switches on Silvally-Fighting as they can come into any move that isn't U-turn and deal significant damage or set up Toxic Spikes, respectively. Flying-types like Swanna and Altaria also threaten any Silvally-Fighting set out if it is lacking Rock Slide for the former or Ice Beam for the latter; Swanna can threaten the OHKO with Hurricane, whereas Altaria can win the Toxic war thanks to Natural Cure. As an offensive Fighting-type, Silvally-Fighting faces competition from Monferno and Combusken, though it differentiates itself from them with its higher Speed tier, pure Fighting-typing, and access to Defog, which makes it easier to fit Silvally-Fighting on a team. Despite its Speed tier, it still needs to watch out for faster attackers such as Swanna and Kadabra as well as Choice Scarf revenge killers in Mr. Mime and Rotom-S, which can pose significant threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The defensive pivot set can opt to run more Speed EVs in order to outspeed Pinsir, Monferno, and Vigoroth. Parting Shot can be used over U-turn on Offensive sets as Silvally-Fighting is able to force out any relevant Defiant users and can hit the Pokemon with Soundproof like Mr. Mime and Bouffalant with Shadow Claw and Multi-Attack, respectively, but the chip damage provided by U-turn is typically preferred. Zen Headbutt helps deal with Muk, Mareanie, and other Poison-types for the offensive pivot set and the Swords Dance set. Iron Head can be used on the Swords Dance set to deal notable damage to Fairy-types like Carbink and Granbull while still hitting Mr. Mime. However, this does not improve its overall coverage and is still unable to break past defensive Granbull. A RestTalk set can provide longevity but suffers from an inability to break past walls due to the lack of coverage and makes Silvally-Fighting too passive, as it lacks Swords Dance. Silvally-Fighting has a wide variety of utility moves in its arsenal, including Thunder Wave, Magic Coat, and Tailwind, but it lacks the moveslots to take advantage of them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Altaria, Swanna, and Rotom-S fear nothing but Rock Slide and Ice Beam from Silvally-Fighting. Because of this, Silvally-Fighting is often forced to switch out against these Pokemon. Rotom-S can also run a Choice Scarf set, allowing it to outspeed Silvally-Fighting. However, if Silvally-Fighting is running Rock Slide or Ice Beam, these Pokemon have issues switching in safely.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: If Silvally-Fighting is not running Zen Headbutt, Muk and Mareanie can reliably come into and force it out. This allows Mareanie to put down Toxic Spikes, further hindering the rest of your team's longevity, whereas Muk is able to set up or deal notable damage if running Choice Band.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Kadabra, Beheeyem, and Mr. Mime all threaten to deal significant damage with a powerful STAB move. Kadabra is especially a problem, as it can outspeed and threaten to OHKO Silvally-Fighting at any point. However, none of these Pokemon like coming into U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and Granbull can be a major nuisance for Silvally-Fighting because of its vulnerability to Will-O-Wisp from Gourgeist-XL, whereas Granbull can 2HKO or OHKO Silvally-Fighting. Granbull can also cure Toxic poison with Heal Bell, whereas Gourgeist-XL can Leech Seed or burn any Pokemon that is being pivoted into from U-turn.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>With Parting Shot or U-Turn, Silvally-Fighting can quickly generate momentum because the combination of Fighting-type Multi-Attack and Toxic limits the opponent's options. Parting Shot is typically preferred due to its ability to ease switchins when facing strong breakers such as Choice Band Torterra, however U-Turn can also be used to do damage to Psychic-types like Exeggutor and Beheeyem, and is not blocked by Clear Body users such as Metang. Toxic provide optimal coverage for Silvally-Fighting's limited damage output, heavily crippling many Fighting-type resists including Ghost-types like Gourgeist-XL and Trevenant as well as Flying-types like Swanna. Ice Beam may be used over Toxic to 2HKO Pokemon such as Torterra and Altaria while still doing notable damage to Gourgeist-XL and Trevenant. Defog provides entry hazard removal for the team, which is especially useful on Silvally-Fighting as it can threaten many Stealth Rock setters, notably Golem and Probopass.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>32 Attack EVs allow Silvally-Fighting to OHKO Komala, and 104 Speed EVs let it outspeed Jolly Komala with maximum Speed investment. Maximum HP EVs, 120 Defensive EVs and an Impish nature allow Silvally-Fighting to pivot into attacks and absorb Knock Off more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Focus on removing the opposing team's entry hazard setter, such as Golem or Probopass, by taking advantage of Silvally-Fighting's bulk and threatening them with STAB Multi-Attack. Thanks to the combination of Fighting-type Multi-Attack and Toxic, the opponent has limited counterplay, which allows Silvally-Fighting to quickly generate momentum with Parting Shot or U-turn. Because of RKS System, Fighting Memory can't be removed by Knock Off, so switch Silvally-Fighting into common users like Komala and Pawniard. Silvally-Fighting can also come in quite safely on Stealth Rock users like Probopass and more passive Normal-type Pokemon like Bulk Up Vigoroth. This shouldn't be taken for granted, however, as Silvally-Fighting's lack of any form of recovery limits the number of times it can come in. Furthermore, it's also susceptible to burn and Toxic, so try to scout for them beforehand. U-turn also helps overcome this issue, as most users of these status moves are slower than it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spamming Toxic and pivoting with U-turn are what most of the team wants from this set, so Pokemon like Golem and Beheeyem that deal with Poison-types like Muk and Mareanie are appreciated. Pokemon that deal with Altaria also help it out. These could be special walls like Muk and Bronzor. This set also fits greatly on stall teams, as it deals with common stallbreakers like Komala and Vigoroth while also being a valuable Knock Off absorber. However, this set also suffers from Silvally-Fighting's lack of recovery and inability to heal status conditions, so it can just as easily be crippled by Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, as well as repeated attacks from the likes of Gourgeist-XL and Vigoroth. Thus, a status absorber like Altaria or Komala is a welcome addition to its team, with Komala even providing Wish support, a wincon with Bulk Up, and an answer to Rotom-S and Swanna. Lickilicky similarly provides Silvally-Fighting with Wish support and removes its status with Heal Bell, while in return Silvally-Fighting checks previously mentioned stallbreakers in Komala and Vigoroth for Lickilicky. Similarly Muk and Mareanie can absorb Toxic Spikes, improving your matchup against opposing Poison-types and can deal with special attackers without Psychic-type coverage. Silvally-Fighting also provides Defog support, which a lot of Pokemon appreciate, even more so the ones that have issues dealing with Golem and Probopass, like Oricorio-F and Rotom-S. They also form a VoltTurn core with Silvally-Fighting and deal with Gourgeist-XL, while Rotom-S can even threaten Mareanie with STAB Thunderbolt or Volt Switch.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is essential for Silvally-Fighting's role as a pivot and helps it chip down the opposing team. Ice Beam is Silvally-Fighting's strongest attack to hit certain Fighting-type resists such as Rotom-S and Altaria, notably 2HKOing the latter even without investment. Crunch and Shadow Claw are also useful moves, as they let you deal notable damage to Ghost- and Psychic-types, with the former being able to 3HKO specially defensive Bronzor thanks to its higher Base Power and the latter ignoring the common Colbur Berry and hitting Mr. Mime for super effective damage. The last slot is reserved for Toxic, as this lets you whittle down even more durable walls like Gourgeist-XL, which doesn't mind even a super effective Shadow Claw or Crunch. Defog is another option, which provides valuable entry hazard control to your team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature gives Silvally-Fighting one of the best unboosted Speed tiers in the meta, with an edge over Monferno and offensive threats like Mr. Mime, Vigoroth, Rotom-S, and Oricorio. It also allows Silvally-Fighting to Speed tie with opposing Silvally forms and Sawsbuck. Even with a Jolly nature, Silvally-Fighting is able to 2HKO Torterra and Altaria after Stealth Rock with Ice Beam.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can pressure clerics and status absorbers, bar Poison-types, from trying to prevent Silvally-Fighting from spreading Toxic. This set can notably 2HKO common clerics seen on stall like Altaria and Lickilicky. Silvally-Fighting can pressure opposing entry hazard setters in Golem and Torterra and remove entry hazards with Defog. Crunch and Shadow Claw also help deal with Bronzor. As this set has Attack investment, Silvally-Fighting can take advantage of U-turn to chip the opposing team down, especially when you have entry hazards placed down. With the correct coverage move, Silvally-Fighting can lure in and deal notable damage to a lot of common Pokemon like Bronzor and Altaria. Therefore, you should keep these moves hidden from the opponent until their targets are in range of being 2HKOed or OHKOed by them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Because Silvally-Fighting can pivot out easily with U-turn, Pokemon that threaten its traditional answers in Muk and Gourgeist-XL, such as Golem, Rapidash, and Muk, make excellent partners. Bronzor and Bouffalant both provide answers to Psychic-types, while fast Electric-types such as Raichu and Choice Scarf Electivire help deal with Flying-types, specifically Swanna and Altaria, and are able to pivot on them with Volt Switch or hit Altaria with Ice-type coverage. Silvally-Fighting suffers from a lack of recovery and the inability to heal status conditions, so it can be crippled by Will-O-Wisp and Toxic as well as repeated attacks from the likes of Gourgeist-XL and Vigoroth, respectively. A status absorber like Altaria or Komala can help mitigate this issue.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Multi-Attack, Swords Dance, and Shadow Claw are essential for Silvally-Fighting to serve as a sweeper. Shadow Claw deals with Ghost- and Psychic-types like Bronzor and Mr. Mime while also hitting Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL. In the last slot, Silvally-Fighting can use Rock Slide to hit Flying-types like Swanna, Altaria, and Rotom-S with Rock Slide. U-turn allows Silvally-Fighting to pivot around, keeping up the momentum and dealing damage to its walls bluffing a Defog set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread allows Silvally-Fighting to be as fast as possible, maximizing its sweeping potential. With 317 Speed, Silvally-Fighting can outspeed its competitor Monferno and threats like Vigoroth, allowing you to check it. It also allows Silvally-Fighting to Speed tie with opposing Silvally and Sawsbuck.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Despite the lack of investment, Silvally-Fighting's natural bulk gives it plenty of opportunities to set up. However, it does not have recovery, so use the given opportunities wisely. Because of this, Probopass, Wish Komala, and Vigoroth help to bait in Pokemon for Silvally-Fighting to set up on. Silvally-Fighting should pivot around its answers with U-turn, not revealing it's a Swords Dance set and dealing chip damage until they are taken care of. Once Silvally-Fighting's checks are gone, it will become notably easier for Silvally-Fighting to break past the opposing team. Take advantage of the unpredictability of Silvally-Fighting, as the opponent has to play carefully to scout for Silvally-Fighting's set and keep its checks healthy.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Silvally-Fighting is unable to break through every Pokemon, teammates such as Zebstrika, Vigoroth, and Choice Band Komala all help out against its checks like Gourgeist-XL, Pyukumuku, Altaria, and Swanna. Because Swords Dance Silvally-Fighting forces a lot of switches, it fits very well with entry hazard stacking teams. Notable hazard setters include Bronzor, Golem, Crustle, and Probopass. Additionally, Golem is a notable check to Muk, whereas Crustle can provide Spikes, further increasing the pressure from entry hazards. Wallbreakers like Chatot, Abomasnow, and Choice Band Muk also provide valuable support by wearing down shared checks or walls that may prevent Silvally-Fighting from sweeping.</p>"

  "Silvally-Ground": {
    "overview": "<p>Silvally-Ground differentiates itself from other Ground-types thanks to its solid all-around bulk, defensive pivoting, and positive matchups against many physical attackers. Compared to other Silvally formes, Silvally-Ground stands out for its Electric immunity, resistance to Stealth Rock, and STAB Ground-type Multi-Attack. These traits allow Silvally-Ground to be a great Defog user, as entry hazard setters like Golem, Metang, and Mareanie are slower than it and weak to Ground. With defensive investment, Silvally-Ground also functions as a soft check to physical attackers that lack super effective coverage against it like Combusken, Muk, and Pawniard. Furthermore, its Ground typing and good bulk can make it a reliable switch-in to faster Pokemon like Electivire and Rapidash and enable it to generate momentum for the team with its slower U-turn. Silvally-Ground is limited in its use with a lack of recovery options, and that makes it vulnerable to residual damage and status conditions. As entry hazard control, Silvally-Ground can be underwhelming when dealing with some entry hazard setters like Torterra, Marrowak, and Bronzor, as they can easily outdamage or outstall it. While it can threaten some targets with Toxic, Silvally-Ground lacks immediate firepower. This is troublesome in that Silvally-Ground cannot threaten certain defensive threats like Altaria and Dusclops, as well as potentially letting in faster revenge killers like Swanna and Simisage with little consequence. These problems along with its competition with other defensive Ground-types like Golem and Torterra and Silvally formes like Silvally-Water and Silvally-Dragon can make Silvally-Ground hard to fit on teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam can help target Gourgeist-XL, Torterra, and Altaria, with the ladder two being relevant Pokemon that otherwise check Silvally-Ground, but it comes at the cost of being unable to inflict Toxic on walls that lack status recovery or immunity like Poliwrath and Vigoroth. Faster sets with more Speed investment have opportunities to outspeed or Speed tie more Pokemon such as Servine, Rotom-S, Electivire, and the other Silvally formes. However, Silvally-Ground loses a considerable amount of bulk in these cases, which usually is not worth it. Swords Dance sets with full Attack and Speed investment can potentially sweep unprepared teams and appreciate the coverage and cleaning opportunities from Silvally-Ground's access to moves like Rock Slide and Flame Charge. That said, the abundance of faster Water- and Grass-type Pokemon in the tier like Swanna, Simisage, and Floatzle means that these sets are too easily revenge killed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Offensive Grass-types like Leafeon, Simisage, and Servine easily force out Silvally-Ground. Defensive Grass-types such as Gourgeist-XL, Torterra, and Shiinotic take little from Multi-Attack, although they do not appreciate Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Multiple Water-types such as Swanna, Floatzel, Simipour, and Golduck outspeed and revenge kill Silvally-Ground. Meanwhile, defensive Water-types like Poliwrath, Mareanie, and Pyukumuku threaten it with Scald and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Silvally-Ground lacks recovery of any kind and is easily worn down from status ailments and residual damage. This is potent, as it is a Defog user that is affected by all entry hazards, and Toxic Spikes in particular can easily wear down Silvally-Ground.</p> <p><strong>Bronzor</strong>: Bronzor is immune to Multi-Attack and Toxic, and it can threaten Silvally-Ground back with Toxic itself. As Silvally-Ground is usually forced to use U-turn on Bronzor, it can also secure its Stealth Rock placement if Silvally-Ground is the only entry hazard remover on the team.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic allows Silvally-Ground to punish bulky Pokemon that resist or are immune to Multi-Attack like Torterra, Gourgeist-XL, and Rotom-S. U-turn is for pivoting out against slower Pokemon that Silvally-Ground does not want to stay in on like Bronzor and Poliwrath while also providing super effective coverage against Grass-type Pokemon like Exeggutor and Cacturne.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The suggested investment maximizes Silvally-Ground's physical bulk while still allowing it to outspeed threats such as Adamant Bibarel, Pawniard, and Torterra.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally-Ground works well early-game by being able to scout with U-turn while still having a STAB Ground-type attack to threaten common entry hazard users such as Golem, Monferno, and Metang. However, given that these threats may have offensive countermeasures like Weakness Policy and Toxic, it might not be worth it to stay in if Silvally-Ground's health is essential for checking sweepers like Combusken and Crustle later on. Silvally-Ground should avoid status effects at all cost, as burn and Toxic limit its capabilities severely. As a result, while it may want to switch into Mareanie while it uses Toxic Spikes, it might not be able to afford switching into a Scald and risking the burn chance. Preserve Silvally-Ground's health by bringing it in on free switches and as a revenge killer to slower threats like Exeggutor, Golem, Muk, and Camerupt. In the same vein, when forcing switches thanks to the revenge kill potential, Silvally-Ground may have a good opportunity to use Defog rather than attacking or pivoting out. Using U-turn against walls that Silvally-Ground cannot break is usually a safe play, but you should consider the opportunity to use Toxic on walls like Gourgeist-XL, Poliwrath, and Sandslash if wearing them down is essential to the team's setup sweeper.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Ground works well on VoltTurn cores that have other pivots that enjoy switching around like Rotom-S, Electivire, Komala, Furfrou, and Mareanie. Mareanie is extra notable for being a Toxic and Toxic Spikes absorber, as otherwise Silvally-Ground has to risk being afflicted with poison or burn to clear Toxic Spikes from opposing Mareanie. Grass- and Water-types are some of Silvally-Ground's biggest concerns, so it is helpful to have offensive teammates that threaten these types like Swanna, Exeggutor, and Rotom-S. These picks also help deter some entry hazard setters like Torterra and Marowak, while Silvally-Ground acts as a defensive pivot that can help bring them in. Water- and Flying-types like Mareanie, Poliwrath, and Toucannon appreciate Silvally-Ground for its immunity to Volt Switch, allowing it to block Choice-locked attackers like Rotom-S and Electivire from revenge killing or building momentum off them. Fire-types like Combusken, Rapidash, and Simisear can help provide a switch-in to Ice- and Grass-type attacks for Silvally-Ground, and it can remove Stealth Rock, switch into Golem and Sandslash, and pivot into them in return. Walls with reliable recovery like Gourgeist-XL, Lickilicky, Komala, and Altaria can help sponge hits for Silvally-Ground, while the latter three can also switch into or cure status effects for it. As common entry hazard setters tend to be Ground-types, Pokemon such as Bronzor, Metang, Monferno, and Corsola can be Stealth Rock options for teams with Silvally-Ground so that the team does not necessarily double down on Ice-, Grass-, and Water-type weaknesses. Silvally-Ground also provides a Knock Off switch-in when these support options are faced against Sandslash and Komala.</p>"

  "Silvally-Water": {
    "overview": "<p>Silvally-Water's solid defensive typing, well-balanced stat spread, good coverage, and access to Defog make it a very solid pick for many teams in ZU. Thanks to its typing, access to Thunderbolt, and lack of vulnerability to Taunt and Switcheroo, Silvally-Water is one of metagame's best defensive answers to Water-types such as Swanna and Floatzel. A good matchup against many of the tier's entry hazard setters such as Golem and Shuckle also makes Silvally-Water one of the best hazard removers in ZU, and thanks to Surf's good offensive synergy with BoltBeam coverage, Silvally-Water can perform well as an offensive pivot. However, a lack of recovery and inability to hold Leftovers mean Silvally-Water gets worn down quite easily, especially since it is often a team's Defogger, which leads to it switching into entry hazards quite often. This lack of recovery also means it hates getting statused, cutting into its longevity even more. Silvally-Water also has some four-moveslot syndrome, often having to choose between Surf, Ice Beam and Flamethrower, sacrificing either a strong STAB or its ability to hit common Water-resists like Silvally-Dragon and Shiinotic. As an offensive Water-type, Silvally-Water faces a lot of competition from Swanna, Floatzel and Simipour, though it carves a niche thanks to its access to U-turn and better defensive stats, which can make it easier to fit Silvally-Water on a team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The second attacking move on the defensive set can be replaced with Toxic to cripple a wide variety of defensive Pokemon, like specially defensive Pyukumuku and Vigoroth, but the ability to immediately hurt checks like Torterra and Altaria is generally more worth it. Flamethrower is also an option to retain coverage on Gourgeist-XL and Leafeon while targeting Pokemon like Pinsir as well, but misses out on Dragon-types such as Altaria and Silvally-Dragon and is generally outclassed as a coverage move by Ice Beam. Defog can be used on the offensive set, but without one of its coverage moves the set's effectiveness decreases significantly and the set gets chipped far more easily due to the lack of defensive investment, making it a worse Defogger. Silvally-Water has a wide variety of utility moves in its arsenal, including Thunder Wave, Magic Coat, Tailwind, and Heal Block, but it lacks the moveslots to make effective use of them. Silvally-Water can potentially use a Swords Dance set with Multi-Attack and coverage moves like the elemental fangs, Rock Slide, and Zen Headbutt, but this is outclassed by physical Floatzel and Swanna sets, gets walled completely by Gourgeist-XL, and suffers from low-Base Power coverage moves, especially when compared to its special moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-S can come in and outspeed both common Silvally-Water sets, heavily threatening it, although it has a hard time switching in. Electivire is bulky enough to come in on any move without risking a 2HKO, bar Surf from the offensive set, and immediately force out Silvally-Water, generating momentum via Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: If Silvally-Water is not running Ice Beam or Flamethrower, faster Grass-types like Leafeon and Gourgeist-Small can switch into it for free and heavily pressure the team. Other Grass-types like Simisage and Exeggutor can also come in, but do not comfortably take a U-Turn and still have to be careful of Ice- and Fire-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Silvally-Water's complete lack of recovery, getting worn down through moves like Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic, and Toxic Spikes can quickly take it out.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Komala, Lickilicky, and Muk can easily take any of Silvally-Water's hits while only having to fear Toxic, and Komala and Muk are immune even to that. Bronzor is also capable of taking any hit with ease while being immune to Toxic and beating Silvally-Water with a Toxic of its own, allowing it to keep up Stealth Rock easily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While not being a STAB move, Thunderbolt is the most important move on the set, as it threatens opposing Water-types, which this set is meant to reliably answer. Notably, it manages to KO Floatzel after two rounds of Stealth Rock, as well as 2HKOing physically defensive Mareanie and OHKOing Swanna. The second slot is reserved for another attacking move: Ice Beam is most common, as it synergizes very well with Thunderbolt, heavily threatening Altaria, Gourgeist-XL, Leafeon, and Golem. Surf is Silvally-Water's most powerful move due to STAB and does considerable damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it, but it leaves Silvally-Water walled by most Grass-types. Hazard control is essential on every team and Silvally-Water is a good user of Defog thanks to its good matchup with many of the metagame's entry hazard setters like Golem, Probopass, and Crustle. U-turn allows Silvally-Water to pivot out of bad matchups after removing hazards or keep up momentum on forced switches. It also does decent damage to Pokemon weak to it like Servine and Exeggutor thanks to Silvally-Water's solid base Attack, which means that Ice Beam is not as important as it otherwise would be. Parting Shot is an option over U-turn to offer utility in stat drops, but it can be blocked by Soundproof Bouffalant and Mr. Mime and gives Defiant Pawniard and Purugly +3 Attack, making U-turn much safer.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>160 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Silvally-Water to outspeed Servine, meaning it can U-turn out on it or threaten it with Ice Beam while also moving before Pokemon like Altaria and Monferno. 100 Special Attack EVs ensure that Floatzel goes down to Thunderbolt after two rounds of Stealth Rock damage, allow Silvally-Water to 2HKO Mareanie with Thunderbolt, and enable it to OHKO physically defensive Altaria with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally-Water should be focused on pivoting in and out, constantly keeping up momentum. In order to do this, it needs to ensure entry hazards are getting consistently removed, and it needs to avoid status, as it will get chipped too quickly otherwise. It has solid natural bulk, and this is bolstered by HP investment, which lets it switch in once or twice against certain attackers of which it does not resist the STAB moves, like Pinsir. This can be very useful to immediately remove hazards, threaten the opposing team, or generate momentum. If there is a Pokemon on the opposing team that Silvally-Water needs to check, like Floatzel or Swanna, it is important to keep it healthy to neutralize that threat. Remember that Silvally-Water does not have any way of getting its health back; while it wants to pivot in and out, it's important to carefully consider what damage is worth taking. Due to Silvally-Water's wide movepool, your opponent will often be unsure of exactly what moves Silvally-Water has, and you can use this to your advantage. By spending much of the early-game using U-turn to pivot in and out and not revealing Silvally-Water's set, you can lull your opponent into a false sense of security before suddenly catching them off guard with a coverage move. Silvally-Water can be used as a decent Knock Off absorber, as RKS System prevents Water Memory from being removed and prevents the move's power increase, allowing it to switch into Pokemon like Pawniard effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Especially if you're running Surf, a good answer to offensive Grass-types such as Torterra and Leafeon is necessary. Defensively, Steel-types like Bronzor and Mawile are the best, and offensive answers include Simisear and Rapidash. Bronzor and Mawile also form a good entry hazard control core with Silvally-Water. Since Silvally-Water is a solid answer to Water-types, Pokemon that hate their presence appreciate the support it offers. Thus, the previously mentioned Simisear and Rapidash but also Pokemon like Choice Band Bouffalant enjoy being paired with Silvally-Water. In return, each of them threatens Grass-types. Since Silvally-Water does not have any form of recovery, it can easily be crippled by status, most notably Toxic. Thus, a status absorber like Komala is quite useful. Note that Komala can also heal Silvally-Water back up with Wish, adding to its longevity. A Pokemon immune to Electric-type moves, like Electivire or Sandslash, is important as a teammate, as Silvally-Water is easily forced out by Volt Switch users like opposing Electivire. Silvally-Water fits well onto Fire / Water / Grass cores, so partners like Gourgeist-XL, Leafeon, Rapidash, and Combusken can form a deadly combination.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>On this set, Surf is used to give Silvally-Water a powerful move, allowing it to pressure and force switches more easily. Thunderbolt is the most important coverage move, hitting Pokemon like Mareanie, Floatzel, and Swanna hard, 2HKOing the former while OHKOing the latter two. The third slot is reserved for a move to dent Grass-types, with both capable of threatening Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and Leafeon. Ice Beam is generally preferred, as it has the added benefit of usually OHKOing even specially defensive Altaria after Stealth Rock. Flamethrower, meanwhile, is capable of OHKOing Pawniard as well as 2HKOing Bronzor after some chip damage. U-turn allows Silvally-Water to pivot around, especially with this more offensive set forcing more switches and thus allowing it to keep up momentum even more effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread allows Silvally-Water to hit as hard as possible while still outspeeding Pokemon like Monferno and Torterra. A Timid nature is an option over a Modest nature in order to outspeed Pokemon like Oricorio and Mr. Mime, but a Modest nature is generally preferred to threaten an OHKO roll on Floatzel with Thunderbolt, have a good chance to 2HKO specially defensive Probopass after Stealth Rock, and increase Silvally-Water's general damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Silvally-Water set should focus on using its wide coverage to force switches and generate momentum for its team with U-turn. Due to the Special Attack investment and Modest nature, it hits quite hard despite not having the highest base stats, and it can be quite a nuisance to switch into. A lot of the time, Silvally-Water is best off using Surf once it is on the field. The Pokemon that can take it easily usually do not outspeed it, and due to Silvally-Water's natural bulk, it will be able to stay in and take a hit to 2HKO them with a coverage move afterwards. Meanwhile, Pokemon that are faster and threaten it more significantly do not enjoy taking that much damage from Surf. Note that despite the lack of investment in its defensive stats, it is still a solid check to the likes of Floatzel, so it is often useful to keep it healthy to deal with the threat late-game. Early on, it is often smart to refrain from revealing exactly what coverage moves Silvally-Water is running in order to keep your opponent guessing as to whether or not their Altaria is a safe switch-in. This is especially relevant after revealing two attacking moves on this set, as most people will expect Silvally-Water to run Defog and U-turn, meaning a third move can catch them off guard.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Silvally-Water does not have any form of recovery and wants to switch in as much as possible, an entry hazard remover is necessary. Due to Species Clause, no other Silvally forme can used for this role, although other Pokemon such as Rotom-S, Altaria, Komala and Sandslash are still available. The former two are also able to take Grass-type attacks for Silvally-Water, while Komala can absorb status and use Wish to improve Silvally-Water's sustainability. Lastly, Sandslash forms a solid hazard core with Silvally-Water, while also checking Electric-types like Electivire and benefitting from Silvally-Water's ability to check the likes of Swanna and Golduck in return. If not using Sandslash, an alternative hazard setter should be paired with Silvally-Water, taking advantage of its ability to force switches. Notable setters include Bronzor, Golem, and Crustle. Bronzor also notably checks Torterra well, which pairs well with non-Ice Beam sets. Pokemon immune to Electric, like Electivire and Golem, pair well with Silvally-Water to prevent Volt Switch users from generating momentum for free. Lastly, while this set is fairly strong offensively, it is unable to get through common Pokemon on stall like Lickilicky, so a stallbreaker like Komala or Pinsir is a good partner.</p>"

  "Komala": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent ability and amazing Attack stat, Komala is a great Pokemon in the ZU metagame, especially since its access to a powerful STAB move in Return and good coverage moves like Earthquake and Knock Off makes it quite a nuisance to switch into. Utility moves like U-turn, Rapid Spin, Toxic, and Wish also allow it to offer a variety of support to its team, which is bolstered by good special bulk combined with only a single weakness, making it challenging to take down. In addition, setup moves like Bulk Up and Swords Dance allow it to break through Pokemon that otherwise wall it and add to its already incredible versatility and unpredictability. Komala especially excels at beating defensive builds thanks to its immunity to status because of Comatose.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Komala suffers from underwhelming Speed and low physical bulk, leaving it to easily succumb to offensive pressure and causing it to struggle against more offensive builds. The very common Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL is also hard for Komala to break through, although it can be worn down with repeated uses of U-turn. Lastly, Komala faces some competition from other Normal-types like Bouffalant, Kecleon, and Lickilicky, though its status immunity and great movepool mean that it generally outshines them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Komala can run a set consisting of Swords Dance, Return, Wood Hammer, and Knock Off with Grassium Z to heavily threaten common stall teams, as they lack a good answer for it due to Bloom Doom breaking through stall's most common answer to set up sweepers in Pyukumuku. However, due to a lack of setup opportunities, this set has a very lackluster matchup against offense, even moreso than its other sets, making it very matchup reliant. To relieve that issue, Sucker Punch can be used over Knock Off, but that leaves Komala unable to remove items from Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL and stallbreak. Due to Comatose's strange mechanics, Sleep Talk is successful even though Komala is immune to sleep. As such, a set consisting of only Sleep Talk and Last Resort with a Choice Band may seem alluring to fire off 140-Base Power STAB moves immediately, but the complete lack of coverage on this set leaves it entirely walled by Pokemon like Gourgeist-XL, physically defensive Golem, and Probopass, which makes it always inferior to the standard Choice Band set. In addition, Choice Band Reckless Head Charge Bouffalant hits about as hard as Last Resort while being able to fit on moves like Earthquake, making it a superior choice as well. Superpower is an option over Earthquake on the Choice Band set in order to still threaten Golem and Probopass while not letting Bronzor come in for free, but the stat drops make it usually a worse option. Lastly, a physically defensive variant with Wish / Protect / Rapid Spin / Toxic allows Komala to beat non-Choice Band Golem and thus remove its Stealth Rock. However, since Komala's natural physical bulk is lacking, it is unable to check many physical attackers, especially Fighting-types, making this set inferior to the specially defensive one.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gourgeist-XL:</strong>: Gourgeist-XL is immune to Komala's STAB moves and easily takes its Earthquakes while also easily taking Knock Off thanks to Colbur Berry. However, it must be wary of Toxic and Bulk Up on the defensive set and can be worn down by U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: While they can't switch in for fear of Choice Band Return, Silvally-Fighting and Monferno both outspeed any Komala set and can revenge kill it with ease. Combusken can do something similar, although it needs a Speed Boost first.</p> <p><strong>Faster Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon such as Electivire, Floatzel, and Pinsir can all take out Komala from full or after minor chip due to Komala's lacking Defense stat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake hits the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Return very hard, notably 2HKOing physically defensive Golem and Mawile and OHKOing Probopass. Knock Off is Komala's strongest move to hit Ghost-types like Dusclops, as well as Bronzor, which is 2HKOed even if it is physically defensive. Knock Off also offers crucial utility in removing Eviolite from Pokemon like Hakamo-o, allowing them to be more easily broken through later. U-turn allows Komala to utilize the switches it forces to generate momentum for its team while wearing down checks like Gourgeist-XL. Sucker Punch is an option over Knock Off to give Komala a form of priority, which helps in the matchup against offensive teams, but it leaves Komala completely walled by Pokemon like Bronzor and is thus usually inferior to Knock Off.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature is generally preferred for this set, as it allows Komala to outspeed Pokemon like Pawniard while also preventing Altaria from efficiently Speed creeping it. However, an Adamant nature is an option, as it allows Komala to OHKO offensive Golem with Earthquake after Sturdy is broken.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Focus on switching Komala in on passive Pokemon it heavily threatens, like Mareanie and Altaria, and begin breaking through the opponent's team. Notably, it is capable on coming in for free on those Pokemon, as well as others like Pyukumuku, thanks to Comatose. Otherwise, use U-turn and Volt Switch from its teammates to switch Komala in. Its bulk isn't great without investment, especially physically, so switching it in on strong attackers is ill-advised. Early-game, it is often useful to utilize Komala's U-turn to generate momentum for its team and wear down its switch-ins. Otherwise, it will be tough to break through the likes of physically defensive Golem without flawless predictions. Knock Off can be used in a similar manner, removing useful items like Leftovers and Eviolite from its checks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Komala's matchup against offensive teams is far from great, so fast attackers that can threaten the archetype like Floatzel, Rapidash, and Kadabra are very important. Pokemon like Oricorio-F, Silvally formes, and Electivire that can bring in Komala with moves like U-turn and Volt Switch synergize very well with it, especially if they can lure in Pokemon it can threaten. Since Komala forces a lot of switches, hazard setters like Golem, Bronzor, Crustle, and Probopass are important. Probopass also notably traps opposing Steel-types like Bronzor, allowing Komala to spam Return more easily. Komala tends to be forced out by powerful, faster attackers, so having switch-ins for them is crucial; as such, using a good defensive core like Golem + Gourgeist-XL or Altaria + Bronzor can greatly aid Komala.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Comatose, Komala is the only viable Rapid Spin user in the tier that is immune to Toxic Spikes, which allows it to prevent its team from becoming poisoned. If Komala's team already has hazard removal, then Bulk Up is an alternative over Rapid Spin, turning Komala into a bulky setup sweeper that can take over games late-game thanks to it being immune to Toxic, which would be common counterplay otherwise. Knock Off is the only offensive move on the set. It offers great utility in removing items and nothing is immune to it, ensuring Komala is rarely completely dead weight against any Pokemon. Knock Off also allows Komala to consistently beat Bronzor, which a very common Stealth Rock setter, and thus allows it to spin with ease. Toxic is an option over Knock Off if Rapid Spin is chosen in the first slot to punish Pokemon like Colbur Berry Gourgeist-XL, which can spinblock Komala with ease otherwise, and Silvally-Fighting, both of which take little damage from Knock Off and either do not mind having or cannot have their item removed. However, it leaves Komala completely passive once the opposing Pokemon has been badly poisoned and makes it a free switch-in for Pokemon immune to Toxic, like Mareanie, Probopass, Muk, and opposing Komala. Protect allows Komala to be sure to receive its own Wish and helps it scout Choice item users, like Electivire and opposing Komala.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This EV spread makes the most use of Komala's solid natural special bulk to check a variety of special attackers in the tier like Choice Scarf Chatot and Silvally-Dragon. In addition, if Komala is running Bulk Up, it can already boost its Defense, meaning further investment is unnecessary.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Komala set should focus on using its solid special bulk to answer powerful special attackers like Choice Scarf Chatot and Silvally-Dragon. It should be pivoting in and out often, using Wish to keep itself healthy and Knock Off to take on Bronzor and prevent itself from being a free switch-in for attackers that threaten it. If you're running Rapid Spin, switch Komala into entry hazard setters that rely on special attacks or status, like Mareanie and defensive Camerupt, to remove their hazards immediately; thanks to Komala's impressive special bulk and its ability Comatose, it can do so quite freely. If using Bulk Up, Komala should generally be kept healthy until late-game. Although it can still be used to pivot into special attackers, a healthy Komala can set up on many special attackers and passive Pokemon, like Altaria and Zebstrika, and sweep from there. Be careful around mixed attackers or ones that can run either physical or special sets, such as Floatzel and Electivire; while this Komala set can check their special sets, it struggles against their physical ones, so the set should be scouted before switching in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Komala's lackluster physical bulk, it pairs well with Pokemon that can efficiently cover many attackers that target Defense, like Gourgeist-XL, physically defensive Altaria, Granbull, and physically defensive Golem. The former three also cover Komala's sole weakness in Fighting, while the latter provides Stealth Rock, forming a solid hazard control core. Other checks to Fighting-types like Mareanie and Muk also pair well to take care of Komala's worst type matchup. They also notably cover Silvally-Fighting, which is one of the best switch-ins to Knock Off. Spikes setters like Crustle and Roselia appreciate Komala removing entry hazards from their side of the field without removing the ones they set like a Defogger would.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off covers the Pokemon immune to Return, notably allows Komala to beat one of the premier Stealth Rock setters in Bronzor, and offers valuable utility in removing items. Earthquake is another option as a coverage move, notably allowing Komala to beat Pokemon like Probopass, thus preventing them from setting Stealth Rock easily, but without a boosting item it's not strong enough to 2HKO the likes of physically defensive Golem and Mawile, and the Pokemon it does already do not appreciate losing their item to Knock Off. U-turn allows Komala to pivot, which synergizes well with an Assault Vest to easily switch in and out and generate a lot of momentum with its increased bulk. Sucker Punch can be used over the coverage move or Rapid Spin if the priority is needed, but it is weak without a boosting item and leaves Komala either walled by many Pokemon, namely those targeted by Knock Off or Earthquake, or unable to provide the excellent hazard control it is known for.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Assault Vest combined with the 160 HP EVs boosts Komala's already good Special Defense, allowing it to easily take special attacks. For example, it does not get OHKOed by Floatzel's All-Out Pummeling from Focus Blast after Stealth Rock and avoids the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Chatot's Boomburst. 96 Speed EVs allow Komala to outspeed offensive Golem, enabling to U-turn out before it can retaliate, thus breaking its Sturdy and generating momentum if the opponent decides to double switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should focus on generating and keeping up momentum and offensive pressure. However, do not be afraid to switch in on special attackers that it can take hits from, such as Chatot and Silvally-Dragon, before removing entry hazards or pivoting out with U-turn. Due to the low Speed investment on this set, Komala's U-turn will usually happen after the foe moves, allowing Komala to bring in strong wallbreakers like Mr. Mime and Pinsir without forcing them to take damage. While Return, Knock Off, and Earthquake won't be the moves you use the most, they are still very strong, and your opponent will have to keep them in mind; look for opportunities to wear down your opponent's team. Remember that Komala is completely immune to every status; do not be afraid to switch into Toxic users that are unable to dent Komala otherwise, such as Bronzor and Mareanie.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates like Gourgeist-XL, Golem, and physically defensive Altaria can cover Komala's lower Defense stat. Gourgeist-XL and Altaria also cover Fighting-types like Silvally-Fighting, while Golem forms a solid hazard control core with it. Since Komala is a slow pivot, frail wallbreakers that appreciate being brought in without taking damage like Chatot, Floatzel, and Pinsir enjoy its support, especially since each of them can beat or set up on Gourgeist-XL and the Rock-types that Komala lures in. Spikes setters like Crustle and Roselia appreciate Komala's Rapid Spin removing entry hazards without undoing their work. Depending on what coverage move is chosen, Pokemon that can deal with the Pokemon Komala loses to are appreciated; Knock Off variants enjoy support from Pokemon like Silvally-Fighting that can threaten Probopass, while Earthquake variants appreciate the likes of Silvally-Dark and Probopass to beat Bronzor.</p>"
