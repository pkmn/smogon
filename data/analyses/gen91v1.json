If you are certain it is a Choice-locked Pokemon, you can just use Disable on the second turn and force it to use Struggle, and if it utilizes a status move, you are free to use Encore on its move and attack with your main STAB move; otherwise, it is recommended to use Encore on the second turn to take a hit, then Protect on the third turn, then Disable on the fourth turn, and, once Encore is over, you use Encore again. This ensures 2 turns of Struggle from the foe, at which point Iron Valiant should be able to KO it. On more passive Pokemon that have moves that do little damage like Registeel, it sometimes can be better to opt out of using Protect and just use your main attack.</li> <li>Iron Valiant fits best on teams that can cover their main weakness to Steel-type Pokemon; therefore, Fire-type Pokemon like Volcarona and Skeledirge make great teammates. In return, Iron Valiant can handle threats like Choice Specs Greninja and Choice Band Ursaluna.

Alternatively, Psychic Noise can be used to check foes that rely on recovery moves, especially Pecharunt and Clear Amulet Cresselia. Moreover, Stored Power + Calm Mind allows Iron Crown to handle foes like Manaphy. Finally, Psychic allows Iron Crown to deal increased damage to foes such as Iron Hands and Speed Booster Energy Walking Wake.</li> <li>The bulk EVs allow Iron Crown to survive Knock Off from Adamant Choice Band Meowscarada and Hydro Cannon from Timid Choice Specs Primarina, with the rest of the EVs being put into Special Attack.</li> <li>Primarina is a great partner for Iron Crown, since Iron Crown is weak to Ground- Fire- and Dark-type attacks from foes like Landorus, Volcarona, and Urshifu-S; in return, Iron Crown provides an immunity to Poison. On top of this, Iron Crown's weakness to Ghost-type attacks can be remedied by using other Dark-types, such as Roaring Moon.</li> </ul>"

Leftovers is also chosen over Black Sludge to continue to provide healing after a Soak from Bellibolt.</li> <li>Against most Pokemon, Parting Shot should be used early to mitigate damage. Even against Encore Primarina, as after a few Parting Shots, Primarina won't be able to do substantial damage and Pecharunt will PP stall Encore out.</li> <li>Against SubSeed Ogerpon-W, Curse shouldn't be used until after Parting Shot has been used to minimize the damage from Ivy Cudgel so that Curse can be used safely.</li> <li>Against Volcarona and other Pokemon that may be able to OHKO Pecharunt, it's better to use Malignant Chain instead and play for a confusion from Poison Puppeteer.</li> </ul>"
