If you are certain it is a Choice-locked Pokemon, you can just use Disable on the second turn and force it to use Struggle, and if it utilizes a status move, you are free to use Encore on its move and attack with your main STAB move; otherwise, it is recommended to use Encore on the second turn to take a hit, then Protect on the third turn, then Disable on the fourth turn, and, once Encore is over, you use Encore again. This ensures 2 turns of Struggle from the foe, at which point Iron Valiant should be able to KO it. On more passive Pokemon that have moves that do little damage like Registeel, it sometimes can be better to opt out of using Protect and just use your main attack.</li> <li>Iron Valiant fits best on teams that can cover their main weakness to Steel-type Pokemon; therefore, Fire-type Pokemon like Volcarona and Skeledirge make great teammates.

The Special Attack investment is enough to OHKO Haxorus with Tachyon Cutter after the Special Defense drop from Close Combat.</li> <li>This Iron Crown set can struggle a lot against opposing Iron Crown due to the lack of Stored Power and matches up poorly against common Fire- and Ground-types and other miscellaneous threats like Hoopa-U and Corviknight, so it's recommended to utilize strong partners such as Air Balloon Volcanion and Ogerpon-W.</li> </ul>"

On top of this, Iron Crown's weakness to Ghost-type attacks can be remedied by using other Dark-types, such as Roaring Moon.</li> </ul>"
