        "description": "<p>Magnezone is one of the best Tapu Koko checks in the metagame, especially with Assault Vest, which makes it a decent Tapu Lele check as well if it avoids Focus Blast. Analytic makes Magnezone very powerful, since Magnezone usually moves last against most offensive threats. However, Sturdy gives Magnezone a pseudo-Focus Sash, letting it revenge kill sweepers as long as Stealth Rock is off the field and it's at full health. While difficult to slot in, Mirror Coat is very viable with Sturdy as well, allowing Magnezone to turn the tables on powerful special attackers while at full health. Also, note that running maximum Speed is an option on Magnezone to outspeed certain bulkier threats such as Primarina and Celesteela.</p> <p>Magnezone has plenty of viable item choices as well. Assault Vest lets it deal with special attackers fairly well, while Choice Specs makes Magnezone very powerful. Electrium Z works well for getting surprise KOs on certain threats, while Steelium Z can make up for its poor coverage by hitting Thunderbolt switch-ins such as Hippowdon, Serperior, and Mega Venusaur very hard. More niche items include Air Balloon, which makes checking Magnezone with Ground-types difficult early in the game, and Weakness Policy, which works well with Sturdy for giving Magnezone a huge amount of power when hit by a super effective attack.</p>"

      "Steel Trapper": {
        "description": "<p>Magnezone is one of the few viable Pokemon to have access to Magnet Pull, making it an extremely effective way to trap and remove troublesome defensive Steel-types for sweepers, such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, and even revenge kill some weakened offensive Steel-types such as Aegislash and Mega Mawile. Hidden Power Fire is important on this variant of Magnezone, since it allows it to effectively trap Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Note that Thunderbolt will be more powerful against other Steel-types that don't resist it. Substitute works especially well on this set for taking advantage of defensive Steel-types and scouting for Earthquakes from Celesteela, but Volt Switch is a reasonable option when scouting is preferred or when using Assault Vest. The given EV spread allows Magnezone to outspeed everything up to Tapu Bulu and Mega Scizor, including other important threats such as Aegislash, Celesteela, and Primarina. More Speed can be run for said threats that may also speed creep, or less can be run if more bulk is important.</p> <p>Electrium Z is a great fit for giving Magnezone one powerful attack, but Assault Vest makes Magnezone a much more reliable Tapu Koko check and buffers it against Tapu Lele. Leftovers is good for giving Magnezone some health back after a Substitute, while Air Balloon can let Magnezone trap and revenge kill weakened Excadrill.</p>"

It is also unable to immediately threaten strong special walls such as Snorlax and Gliscor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Its weakness to Fighting-type moves and Earthquake concedes a free turn to many of the prominent physical attackers such as Mega Salamence, Mega Metagross, and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p>It can be vulnerable to rogue Hidden Power Ground from the likes of Naganadel and Volcarona or All-Out Pummeling from Tapu Lele and Thundurus-T, which can cost the game.</p> </li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Heatran has so many options it is impossible to list them all. Every move listed in the above sets can be mixed and matched for the team's needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flame Charge can be used on offensive sets to act as a sweeping threat.</p> </li> <li> <p>Will-O-Wisp is a defensive tool that can cripple opposing physical attackers such as Landorus-T that switch in trying to use Earthquake on Heatran. However, it has shaky accuracy, and its targets can be hit hard with accurate, direct attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ancient Power and Stone Edge are alternative Rock-type moves, but they lack the utility of Rock Tomb.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Greninja and Tapu Fini resist Fire and force out Heatran. Greninja is particularly difficult to switch into, while Tapu Fini is notable for denying Heatran's ability to safely throw out a Toxic in most instances.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type physical attackers such as Tyranitar resist Fire and commonly carry Earthquake, which is capable of OHKOing Heatran. However, they can be threatened by Flash Cannon and Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type attacks</strong>: Ground-types such as Landorus-T are not the only Pokemon that frequently use Earthquake. Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Mega Metagross, and Mega Kangaskhan can OHKO Heatran with ease thanks to their access to Earthquake. Moves such as Hidden Power Ground and Earth Power may fail to OHKO Heatran but are still capable of crippling it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Offensive Fighting-types such as Mega Blaziken and Mega Lucario are capable of OHKOing Heatran with their STAB moves. However, they struggle to switch into Heatran's strong attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon such as Chansey and Gliscor are capable of walling Heatran and do not mind status or, in Gliscor's case, cannot be statused once Toxic Orb activates. Toxapex is immune to Toxic due to its Poison typing. However, Magma Storm variants can trap and remove these Pokemon rather handily.</p>",

It also threatens opposing Fire-types like Mega Blaziken.</p> </li> <li> <p>Substitute allows Heatran to most effectively take advantage of its strong Toxic + Protect combination, especially as Heatran beats opposing Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taunt stops opposing Pokemon from using recovery or setup moves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stealth Rock is a good support move, breaking any potential Focus Sash as well as chipping down the opposing team into KO range.</p> </li> <li> <p>Roar is also an option for denying faster setup attackers, forcing out Substitute users, and scouting for potential switches.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li> <p>Leftovers is mandatory because it is Heatran's only way of recovery, and Heatran can take great advantage of it with Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p>A Calm nature boosts Heatran's Special Defense, as Heatran's typing better lends itself to being a special wall.</p> </li> <li> <p>The spread maximizes Heatran's special bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is possible to Speed creep, as it will be a very important factor in a possible Heatran mirror.</p> </li> <li> <p>Usually, many opposing Heatran will have 44 Speed EVs due to their incorrect understanding of Leftovers numbers; Heatran with 252 HP EVs or 212 HP EVs will restore the same amount of HP from Leftovers, so there is little gain in intentionally dropping your overall bulk unless you really need the EVs elsewhere. So, if one were to invest in Speed, it is advised that they invest at least that much.</p> </li> <li> <p>For example, 68 Speed EVs will outspeed uninvested Tapu Fini, Suicune, and Mega Venusaur.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li> <p>Heatran's great special bulk and amazing defensive typing allow it to switch into threats such as Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard Y. Use the free turns to spread chip damage through status such as Toxic or poison and burn or simply from direct attacks from its strong base Special Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be careful of potential lure sets moves, such as Focus Blast—potentially with Fightinium Z—or Hidden Power Ground.</p> </li> <li> <p>If using Substitute, always be on the lookout for defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 that grant Heatran a free Substitute.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p>Heatran is such a versatile Pokemon that it goes well with most Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p>This set is best suited for defensive teams that can take advantage of the residual damage from Toxic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pair it with physically defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2, Celesteela, Mega Venusaur, and Slowbro that can check the Ground- and Fighting-types that can threaten Heatran.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pokemon such as Substitute Mega Salamence and Substitute Mega Gengar have good type synergy with Heatran and take advantage of Heatran putting defensive Pokemon on a timer with Toxic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pokemon such as Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Lopunny have access to Fake Out and thus has great synergy with Heatran's Toxic.</p> </li> </ul>"

Don't feel pressured to stay in and use King's Shield if switching out gives you a bigger advantage.</li> <li>If you opt to save Aegislash for later in the game, it becomes far less risky to take advantage of Weakness Policy, since you may know if foes like Garchomp have an Attack-boosting item or not.</li> <li>Although a bit risky, consider attacking setup sweepers such Garchomp if you see that they have an opening to sweep you, since opponents will often attempt to use your King's Shield turn as a setup opportunity.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Since Aegislash is a bulky attacker, focusing on Pokemon that resist its major weaknesses to Fire, Ground, Ghost, and Dark is a good idea.</li> <li>Mega Salamence provides a valuable switch-in to Fire- and Ground-type attacks, while Aegislash easily switches into Ice-, Dragon-, and Rock-type attacks.</li> <li>Gyarados and Mega Gyarados are also good options due to resisting Fire and either of Ground-type attacks and Ghost- and Dark-type attacks. Mega Gyarados in particular can set up on Pokemon that take advantage of Aegislash such as Garchomp after one Intimidate.</li> <li>While they share a Fire-type weakness, Tapu Bulu should be seriously considered as a teammate, since its Grassy Terrain will remove Garchomp's ability to effectively check Aegislash!</li> <li>Tapu Fini can take care of Hydreigon and offer status immunity, while Aegislash is perfect against Poison-type attacks. It can also surprise Celesteela by using Nature's Madness + Waterium Z on an offensive set.</li> <li>A Hydreigon of your own resists all of Aegislash's weaknesses, while Aegislash resists all of Hydreigon's weaknesses.</li> <li>Although they offer little defensive synergy beyond a Dark-type resistance, Fighting-types such as Buzzwole, Pheromosa, and Mega Lucario can help keep Porygon2 at bay. Surprise users of Toxic such as Garchomp and Celesteela are also a big help against Porygon2.</li> <li>Aegislash can be used as a lure to defeat Ground-types (most Ground-type Pokemon will not OHKO Aegislash without an offensive boost of some kind) so that Tapu Koko can sweep more easily.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Substitute is awesome on Aegislash, making it very difficult to revenge kill and protecting it from status.</li> <li>With Toxic, Aegislash can defeat Porygon2, one of its most common checks. It also allows Aegislash to become more of a team player against defensive Pokemon. It also can cripple Mandibuzz on the switch.</li> <li>Despite not affecting Normal-types, Shadow Ball is still Aegislash's best STAB option due to the lack of common Pokemon that resist it.</li> <li>King's Shield is important for letting Aegislash return to its Shield forme, since this Aegislash tends to stay in battle longer than other sets, and lets you Toxic stall foes even more effectively.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Leftovers is very important on this Aegislash, since it has no recovery otherewise. The HP EVs are designed for it to get maximum recovery from them as well.</li> <li>140 Speed EVs let Aegislash outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Alolan Marowak to avoid the easy OHKO from it. This also gets the jump on Tapu Bulu that lack Speed investment, as well as many Celesteela so you can use Substitute before they target Aegislash with Leech Seed.</li> <li>The rest are dumped in Special Attack for decent power.</li> <li>If you are seriously paranoid of the rare Jolly Alolan Marowak, you can run 212 Speed EVs to outpace it. Just be warned, this results in a pretty serious loss in power.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>While switching Aegislash into resisted attacks is fine, consider getting it on after a KO. This will keep Leftovers hidden, potentially luring in Porygon2.</li> <li>If you see Porygon2 in Team Preview, try to cripple it with Toxic on the switch so your foe will have no time to react with a better switch-in.</li> <li>Try to look out for Choiced attackers, since this Aegislash is particularly effective at taking advantage of them.</li> <li>Be warned: unlike other Aegislash sets, this one will lose to Celesteela that have either Flamethrower or Earthquake, since Shadow Ball won't 2HKO them.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Tapu Bulu's Grassy Surge is awesome at making Earthquake less of an issue for Aegislash, and the extra recovery makes Aegislash an even better Toxic staller.</li> <li>Mandibuzz is an effective defensive teammate that can Taunt Celesteela, giving Aegislash ample time to set up.</li> <li>Despite sharing a Fire-type weakness, Celesteela is a very effective teammate for this Aegislash. Aegislash spreading Toxic can let Celesteela outstall foes even more easily, while its Leech Seed support keeps Aegislash alive longer. Celesteela is also a great Ground-type switch-in.</li> <li>Consider Pokemon that are weak to Porygon2. Mega Salamence is a fantastic idea, since it synergizes so well with Aegislash defensively, but Pokemon such as Garchomp can also work.</li> </ul>"

It also hits Porygon2 harder than any other move.</li> <li>King's Shield can be used to make Aegislash more flexible at staying in. However, this does reduce coverage, which makes it not as good of a sweeper late-game.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Maximum HP and Attack allow Aegislash to effectively set up Swords Dance and deal good damage.</li> <li>A Brave Nature with 0 Speed IVs can help against Celesteela and opposing Aegislash. However, with Adamant, Aegislash may be able to outspeed Porygon2, which is important if you have weakened it into Sacred Sword's KO range.</li> <li>Weakness Policy can potentially allow Aegislash to get to +4 Attack in one turn.</li> <li>With Ghostium Z, Aegislash can effectively break Pokemon such as Celesteela if you use Shadow Claw.</li> <li>Life Orb is the most reliable boosting item and lets Aegislash pick off Pokemon with Shadow Sneak more reliably before setup.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>This Aegislash is best used late-game, especially if it lacks King's Shield, since it isn't as flexible as the average Aegislash.</li> <li>Try to scout for Choice items. Pokemon locked into resisted moves such as Garchomp into Dragon-type attacks are what Aegislash is best at setting up on. You can also set up on weaker super effective attacks from the likes of Celesteela to at least tear open a hole for another sweeper.</li> <li>If Aegislash lacks King's Shield, try to get it in a situation where after you use Swords Dance, you can use Iron Head, Shadow Claw, or Sacred Swords once, since this is often Aegislash's only chance to land a powerful hit before it either has to pick the rest off with Shadow Sneak or switch out.</li> <li>Aegislash that lack King's Shield may also opt to play in a more hit and run style if they can't set up due to the lack of being able to go back into Shield forme.</li> <li>Against Celesteela you'll need only one Swords Dance to OHKO it with Ghostium Z, and +4 Attack with Shadow Claw and Weakness Policy. Life Orb will have a hard time OHKOing it without +4 Shadow Claw, since Sacred Sword is only a 12% shot at +4.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Since this Aegislash relies on priority more often than usual, considering pairing it with a Tapu to get rid of Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain. Tapu Fini is a fantastic choice, since it also removes the threat of Will-O-Wisp, while Tapu Bulu makes Earthquake less of a problem. Tapu Koko also works since it can use Volt Switch or U-turn to wear down threats into Shadow Sneak's KO range.</li> <li>Consider pairing Aegislash with Pokemon that have trouble against Celesteela. Good examples include Mimikyu, Garchomp, and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Alolan Ninetales is a cool teammate despite sharing the Fire-type weakness, since it can set up Aurora Veil to make Aegislash very difficult to KO.</li> </ul>"

Hidden Power Ice is a good alternative to hit Landorus-T harder.</li> <li>Roost has good synergy with Calm Mind, letting Tapu Koko set up effectively against more defensive Pokemon. Substitute protects Tapu Koko from status moves, which is helpful against Cresselia and Porygon2.</li> <li>Extra coverage is a reasonable option.

While Cresselia has a higher Special Defense stat, it has a harder time taking on special attackers, since many common ones like Aegislash hit it super effectively.

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Alolan Ninetales sets itself apart from other dedicated leads in Battle Spot Singles with its access to Aurora Veil and Snow Warning. Unlike dual screens setters like Tapu Koko, Alolan Ninetales can justify more utility moves in its moveset to prevent it from being directly set up on due to Aurora Veil weakening both physical and special attacks.</li> <li>Apart from setting Aurora Veil, Alolan Ninetales can utilize Snow Warning to act as an anti-lead towards certain Pokemon like Breloom and Mimikyu that would otherwise set up safely with their Focus Sash intact. Though Alolan Ninetales's conventional teammates are vulnerable to hail damage, there are more instances where the hail damage on opposing Pokemon is more beneficial, as extra damage can turn a number of possible KOs into guaranteed KOs against bulkier foes like Porygon2, Tapu Fini, and Celesteela.</li> <li>Due to its underwhelming typing, low Special Attack, and frailty, Alolan Ninetales struggles to justify a role other than an Aurora Veil setter and is reliant on Encore and Sheer Cold for dealing with bulkier Pokemon.</li> <li>Due to how predictable it is, Alolan Ninetales will easily entice its checks from the Team Preview. There are many viable Pokemon like Hippowdon and Tyranitar that can switch into Alolan Ninetales and prevent Aurora Veil from being set, while foes like Mega Gengar, Mega Scizor, and Choice Scarf users like Kartana and Nihilego can pose a threat as well. In worse cases, Alolan Ninetales may have to deal with a group of defensive Pokemon chosen by an opponent that doesn't mind Aurora Veil being set at all.</li> <li>This means Alolan Ninetales typically mandates its team to be solidly prepared for a large portion of the metagame that can prevent it from performing its role when it provides no defensive presence and has little options for team support apart from setting Aurora Veil. These detriments make Alolan Ninetales compete with other dual screens setters like Tapu Koko and Serperior, which are more consistent and reliable.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Moonblast may be considered as a secondary STAB option, but most of the targets are already pressured by Icy-type attacks.</li> <li>Hypnosis puts a foe to sleep and eases the matchups against setup sweepers like Volcarona and Mega Charizard X, but low accuracy makes this quite risky.</li> <li>Roar can be an interesting countermeasure against Trick Room teams that can mess with Alolan Ninetales's Speed and phaze out setup sweepers that will otherwise get out of hand.</li> <li>Choice Scarf may be an interesting option to outspeed and revenge kill boosted sweepers like Mega Salamence and Mega Gyarados, but the inflexibility coming from the item will not be ideal.</li> <li>Icy Rock can be used to make hail last longer and thus improve the odds for Aurora Veil to be set, but the item's general usefulness is low.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Opposing Weather Setters</strong>: Hippowdon, Mega Charizard Y, Tyranitar, Pelipper, Politoed, and the rare Torkoal can simply switch into Alolan Ninetales to remove hail from the field and prevent Aurora Veil from being set.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Various Steel-types annoy Alolan Ninetales for various reasons. Mega Scizor, Mega Metagross, and Mega Lucario can threaten to OHKO it with Bullet Punch before it can set Aurora Veil, and they can switch into Alolan Ninetales quite safely. Other Steel-types like Celesteela and Ferrothorn can also be difficult to deal with if they are locked into Leech Seed by Encore, as this can be combined with hail damage to wear down Alolan Ninetales's teammates quite fast. Note that a lucky Sheer Cold from Alolan Ninetales can completely reverse the situation, however.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: If it manages to lead against Alolan Ninetales, Gengar can safely gain an opportunity to Mega Evolve and OHKO Ninetales with Sludge Bomb before it sets Aurora Veil. Variants with Taunt still cripple Alolan Ninetales, and giving Gengar a safe opportunity to Mega Evolve makes it harder for Alolan Ninetales's teammates to beat it. Though many Pokemon paired with Alolan Ninetales are capable of defeating it one-on-one, they will likely take a first blow as Alolan Ninetales is forced out and can be traded with Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Heatran barely takes any damage from Alolan Ninetales and can threaten to status the next teammate with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic. Both formes of Blaziken can force mind games against Alolan Ninetales by threatening it with Fire-type attacks and potentially setting up Swords Dance on a forced switch. Mega Charizard X can also ease predictions against Alolan Ninetales if carrying Flame Charge.</p>",

      "Aurora Veil Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>With Snow Warning, Alolan Ninetales can set Aurora Veil, which halves incoming damage from physical and special attacks. This exclusive team support can aid Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Mega Gyarados, which will be significantly more threatening under the better setup conditions. Aurora Veil also makes revenge killing much more difficult for Mimikyu and priority move users such as Breloom and Mamoswine.</li> <li>Encore locks a foe into the same move for three turns, preventing Alolan Ninetales from being easily set up on. Locking a foe into status or setup moves can potentially generate better setup conditions for Alolan Ninetales's teammates.</li> <li>Blizzard gives Alolan Ninetales an acceptable amount of offensive presence, becoming a perfectly accurate attack under hail.</li> <li>Sheer Cold is the best move to allow Ninetales to threaten bulky foes like Porygon2 and alleviate its matchup against defensive teams in a single moveslot.</li> <li>Freeze-Dry can be a solid option to beat Water-types such as Gyarados and Tapu Fini, as well as heavily threatening common Water-types found on rain teams like Pelipper, Mega Swampert, and Kingdra.</li> <li>Icy Wind eases prediction against setup sweepers like Mega Gyarados that Alolan Ninetales can survive a hit from, letting it safely scout the first move they use and lock them into that move with Encore.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature enables Alolan Ninetales to fully take advantage of its good Speed and have as much offensive presence as possible.</li> <li>Alolan Ninetales's meager offensive presence also gives it room to invest in HP as opposed to Special Attack, giving it enough bulk to survive Thunderbolt from Choice Specs Tapu Koko and Psychic from Modest Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T also has unfavorable odds to OHKO maximum HP Alolan Ninetales with Stone Edge.</li> <li>Light Clay is typically preferred, as Alolan Ninetales setting Aurora Veil and potentially locking a foe into Encore gives its teammates very few turns to take advantage of Aurora Veil otherwise.</li> <li>Focus Sash can be used instead to guarantee that Alolan Ninetales survives an attack from full health to improve the chances that Aurora Veil is set, and it is more justifiable with Alolan Ninetales's teammates typically using different items due to hail damage.</li> <li>Snow Warning summons hail when Alolan Ninetales switches in, allowing it to quickly set Aurora Veil.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Depending on the matchup, Alolan Ninetales should be used with caution. Faster checks like Mega Gengar and Bullet Punch users like Mega Metagross, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lucario can lead against Alolan Ninetales to prevent it from setting Aurora Veil and potentially take advantage of the forced switch. Handing momentum to these threats is going to be problematic even if Alolan Ninetales's teammates can take on them well, as Alolan Ninetales's effectiveness will progressively diminish throughout the match as its teammates will lose health from combat.</li> <li>Opposing weather setters can be problematic as well, as they simply prevent Alolan Ninetales from setting Aurora Veil. With the exception of Hippowdon, all weather setters can switch into Alolan Ninetales safely as long as Sheer Cold doesn't end up hitting them. If there are Pokemon like Tyranitar, Pelipper, and Politoed in Team Preview, consider benching Alolan Ninetales.</li> <li>In matchups where no particular foe can outspeed and OHKO Alolan Ninetales or change weather, leading with Alolan Ninetales is often the most sensible strategy for various reasons. While setting Aurora Veil early is important to minimize the incoming damage, hail damage from early-game can also limit the usefulness of Focus Sash users like Mimikyu and Breloom from the opposing team, and any passive damage dealt to problematic walls like such as Porygon2 and defensive Landorus-T can be helpful to Alolan Ninetales's teammates. With Icy Wind and Encore, Alolan Ninetales can also prevent a good number of threats from setting up too early.</li> <li>Note that Alolan Ninetales doesn't have to set Aurora Veil immediately. Foes like Mega Gyarados, which Alolan Ninetales can survive a hit from without Aurora Veil, can have their first move scouted by Icy Wind, preventing them from outspeeding Alolan Ninetales after using Dragon Dance. Make sure that Aurora Veil is set against threatening foes like Mega Mawile and Mega Blaziken immediately, however.</li> <li>Alolan Ninetales will have more room to breathe against slower and bulkier foes, but it is less likely that they will mind Aurora Veil on the field. Passive foes like Toxapex will use Scald and Haze to take care of its counters, and Chansey will Toxic stall most special attackers and do consistent damage with Seismic Toss. In these kinds of matchups, Alolan Ninetales can still aim to either provide its teammates with a free setup opportunity with Encore or set Aurora Veil and repeatedly use Sheer Cold. Overly passive Pokemon will struggle to take down Alolan Ninetales behind Aurora Veil before it ends up hitting Sheer Cold at least once.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Setup sweepers that typically engage in direct combat with foes or need multiple boosts to be successful can greatly benefit from Aurora Veil. Porygon-Z, which may have a hard time setting up against faster threats, can easily gain boosts under Aurora Veil and can become a terrifying sweeper. Mega Gyarados can easily pivot into Bullet Punch targeted at Alolan Ninetales and take full advantage of Aurora Veil if carrying Taunt or Substitute by preventing status moves and weak attacks. To a lesser extent, other setup sweepers like Mega Salamence, Mega Charizard X, and Naganadel are less vulnerable to Mimikyu behind Aurora Veil and can set up more easily.</li> <li>Teammates that do not necessarily need Aurora Veil should also be present on the team to discourage foes like Mega Gengar and Mega Metagross from easily anti-leading Alolan Ninetales. One of the aspects of using Alolan Ninetales includes luring in foes that remove hail and OHKOing them swiftly. Offensive Ground-types like Garchomp can be considered to counterlead Steel-types and threaten Tyranitar. Pokemon that can beat Mega Gengar and Tapu Koko should also be considered, as they may carry Taunt.</li> <li>Fire-types such as Volcarona and both formes of Blaziken are good partners to have around, whether Alolan Ninetales will be used or not. Both of them can punish Steel-types drawn in after seeing Alolan Ninetales in Team Preview, and they become significantly more difficult to take down behind Aurora Veil. Mega Charizard Y is a considerable option for similar reasons, and it can hinder sand or and rain teams that attempt to remove Alolan Ninetales's hail.</li> <li>Rain teams are possible as well due to Swift Swim sweepers such as Mega Swampert and Kingdra pressuring Steel- and Fire-types that typically lead against Alolan Ninetales. Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele that will limit Alolan Ninetales to using only one utility move and faster foes like Mega Gengar are also vulnerable to said archetype.</li> </ul>"

Apart from Pursuit trapping, Alolan Muk provides its team with the utility of Knock Off and Poison Jab by removing the items of foes and spreading poison status. However, due to the fact that Alolan Muk is forced to use Assault Vest to effectively take hits from foes it switches into, it lacks recovery and is prone to getting worn down over the match.

Lastly, although it has various coverage options such as Fire Punch, Rock Tomb, Shadow Sneak, Ice Punch, and Brick Break, Alolan Muk only has room for one of them, meaning common foes such as Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, Mega Mawile, Ferrothorn, and Mega Tyranitar can easily take advantage of Alolan Muk depending on what coverage move it opts for.</p>",

Alolan Muk can choose various coverage moves; Fire Blast lets Alolan Muk 2HKO Ferrothorn without taking damage from Iron Barbs and guarantees the OHKO on Kartana while retaining the ability to 2HKO Mega Scizor, but it does pitiful damage to Celesteela and has a chance to miss. Brick Break hits Heatran and Tyranitar and also breaks screens and Aurora Veil, but it doesn't have much use otherwise. Ice Punch surprises Mega Salamence and Garchomp, but the former can set up on Alolan Muk after Intimidate anyway. Lum Berry is a plausible option to more reliably Pursuit trap Mega Gengar by healing from sleep or burn once. Recycle in tandem with Figy Berry, Curse, and Minimize can function with heavy team support, but Curse sets are outclassed by Snorlax, while strategies employing Minimize are inconsistent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, Swampert, and Excadrill take little damage from Poison Jab and can force out Alolan Muk, and therefore are some of the best offensive checks to Alolan Muk. However, most Ground-types do not like losing their items to Knock Off or getting poisoned, and Excadrill must be wary of Fire Punch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although all of them dislike losing their items to Knock Off unless they have Z-Crystals, Steel-types can switch into Alolan Muk with ease thanks to their generally high bulk and immunity to Poison Jab. While Celesteela, Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor must be wary of Fire-type moves, they can otherwise easily take advantage of Alolan Muk. Heatran can beat variants of Alolan Muk that carry Fire-type moves, but it does not like losing its item to Knock Off and dislikes the occasional Brick Break.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Even when it is not hit super effectively, Alolan Muk is overwhelmed by a myriad of physical attackers in the tier, such as Mega Salamence, Mega Blaziken, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Kangaskhan, due to its mediocre Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: In general, Alolan Muk struggles with foes that are marginally bulky and resist its moves. Tyranitar is a hard stop to any Alolan Muk variants without Brick Break and is only bothered by poison. Toxapex is impossible to surmount thanks to its phenomenal bulk, Regenerator, and immunity to poison, and it can threaten to burn Alolan Muk with Scald. Skarmory is not even 3HKOed by Fire Punch and only needs to worry about the rare Fire Blast and losing its item to Knock Off. Mega Venusaur doesn't mind Fire-type moves at all thanks to Thick Fat, and it can slowly wear down Alolan Muk with Leech Seed while shaking off any damage taken with Synthesis.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Not only does burn residually damage Alolan Muk, but it also neuters Alolan Muk's damage output, leaving it unable to Pursuit trap foes effectively. Therefore, Alolan Muk must play with caution against Scald users like Suicune and Toxapex and Will-O-Wisp users like Mega Gengar and Rotom forms.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit is capable of hitting foes hard if they attempt to switch out, and it allows Alolan Muk to guarantee removal of threats like Mega Gengar and Latios while netting significant damage against Tapu Lele. Knock Off is a stronger Dark-type STAB move that has utility of removing items and scouting for potential Z-Crystals and Mega Stones from certain foes. The move also ensures that the likes of Heatran and Celesteela are punished should they switch directly into Alolan Muk. Poison Jab is a consistent Poison-type STAB move that is used to deal with Fairy-types and notably OHKOes Tapu Lele, leaving it with a risky situation if it attempts to stay in predicting Pursuit. Factoring in Poison Touch, Poison Jab has a very high chance to poison a foe which is hazardous to Alolan Muk's potential checks. The last moveslot depends on what foes Alolan Muk desires to hit. Fire Punch 2HKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, has a chance to OHKO Kartana, and has general utility of hitting Steel-types super effectively. Rock Tomb lets Alolan Muk OHKO Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y and prevents Mega Salamence from freely setting up on Alolan Muk. Lastly, Shadow Sneak picks off weakened threats, especially Focus Sash users, and this move notably lets Alolan Muk finish off Tapu Koko, which has a chance to avoid the OHKO from Poison Jab.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With 116 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature, Pursuit OHKOes Mega Gengar when it switches out, Poison Jab OHKOes Tapu Lele and 2HKOes Volcarona, and Knock Off almost always OHKOes maximum HP Aegislash in its Blade forme. Assault Vest in tandem with 140 HP EVs and 252 Special Defense EVs lets Alolan Muk avoid the 2HKO from Modest Choice Specs Tapu Lele, the 2HKO from +1 Volcarona after Stealth Rock, and the 3HKO from Life Orb Greninja. Minimizing Speed by using a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs is an option that lets Alolan Muk underspeed Quiet Aegislash and OHKO it with Knock Off after it attacks and transforms into its Blade forme.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Since Alolan Muk is capable of taking special hits well, it is a promising idea to switch it in on special attackers such as Mega Gengar, Tapu Lele, and Greninja. It can also switch into predicted uses of Toxic from passive walls such as Chansey. Once it comes in, Alolan Muk can KO or weaken Ghost- and Psychic-types with Pursuit as they are forced out, or it can proceed to hinder foes by removing their items with Knock Off or spreading poison with Poison Jab. Opponents are likely to switch in Steel-types, preferably the ones that can take advantage of or force out Alolan Muk, with an intention to prevent the spread of poison. Keep in mind that most common switch-ins to Alolan Muk can be punished with predictions and the coverage move Alolan Muk is carrying. Some Steel-types like Celesteela and Heatran are greatly hindered by a well-timed Knock Off on the switch, while Ferrothorn and Scizor will be harshly punished by Fire Punch. Lastly, be wary of foes that use Scald or Will-O-Wisp, as getting burned significantly hinders Alolan Muk's offensive capabilities, notably leaving it unable to effectively Pursuit trap a foe.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types make good partners for Alolan Muk; they can handle the Steel-types that annoy Alolan Muk, while Alolan Muk can dispose of Ghost- and Psychic-types, threaten Fairy-types, remove items from various physical walls like Celesteela, and spread poison. Mega Blaziken in particular appreciates Alolan Muk's ability to remove problematic Pokemon like Choice Scarf Latios and various Ghost-types, and Mega Blaziken can potentially stall out poisoned foes with Protect or Substitute to the point that it can KO them. Pokemon that can switch into Ground-type moves or handle physical attackers are good defensive partners for Alolan Muk. Landorus-T compresses both of these roles while threatening Steel-types with Earthquake. Rotom formes are good checks to Mega Salamence and Celesteela, and they can neuter physical attackers with Will-O-Wisp, giving Alolan Muk a better chance to take on them on. Serperior is a good offensive partner to Alolan Muk, as it appreciates Alolan Muk's ability to remove Mega Gengar and hinder Steel-types with Knock Off and Fire Punch, and in return it can take on Ground-types for Alolan Muk. Tapu Bulu summons Grassy Terrain, which weakens Earthquake and provides Alolan Muk with passive recovery. Defensive partners like Chansey, Skarmory, and Gliscor can pair well with Alolan Muk in defensive teams, as all of them appreciate removal of Mega Gengar. The latter two can also switch into Ground-type moves for Alolan Muk.</p>"

However, Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge can be troublesome for Cloyster given the prevention of priority moves against grounded targets.</li> <li>Waterium Z and Razor Shell in place of Ice Shard is an option to allow Cloyster to use Hydro Vortex, which can OHKO Heatran and Assault Vest Mamoswine without a boost, while also allowing +2 Cloyster to OHKO Aegislash and Mega Metagross after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Focus Sash guarantees Cloyster can use Shell Smash, which is essential in matchups against dedicated special attackers, as Cloyster's Special Defense is quite poor. Kings Rock works in conjunction with Icicle Spear and Rock Blast, granting a 41% chance to make the opponent flinch.</li> <li>252 Attack EVs ensure that Cloyster can hit to its full potential, while 252 Speed EVs are needed for Cloyster to outspeed Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. An Adamant nature is preferred, as +2 Speed from Shell Smash gives Cloyster enough Speed; however, a Jolly nature can still be used to ensure that +2 Cloyster is faster than Choice Scarf Garchomp and +1 Mega Charizard Y, which would otherwise OHKO it.</li> <li>Even at +2, Cloyster struggles to break bulky Water-types and Porygon2, so be sure to carry Electric-type coverage somewhere and a means of dealing with Porygon2.

Mega Blaziken can outspeed Eevee thanks to Speed Boost, while Breloom can use Spore to incapacitate Eevee or a switch-in. Mega Heracross can also hit through Eevee's Substitute and OHKO it. Finally, Mega Lucario's Close Combat, when coupled with Adaptability, hits extremely hard and will often KO Eevee even after the boost.</p>",

      "Extreme Evoboost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Last Resort can be powered up into Extreme Evoboost thanks to Eevium Z, giving Eevee +2 boosts in all of its stats. Last Resort itself is impossible to use successfully though, as Baton Pass must be used, and Last Resort's effects reset if you switch out.</li> <li>Baton Pass is the main draw to using Eevee, as it allows it to pass the stat boosts from Extreme Evoboost to an ally.</li> <li>Substitute allows Eevee to avoid status conditions, and its Substitute can be Baton Passed to an ally.</li> <li>Protect is good on Trick Room teams to waste Trick Room turns when you don't want it anymore, as well as being good to scout Z-Moves on Pokemon like Mimikyu.</li> <li>Stored Power becomes a 220 Base Power move after Extreme Evoboost and is Eevee's primary means of attacking in situations where it needs to attack on its own, such as against Mega Gengar to stop Perish Song or Taunt, against Toxapex to stop Haze and against Mimikyu if you want to break Disguise before your sweeper comes in.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>204 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Eevee to outspeed everything up to Modest Choice Scarf Tapu Lele in Tailwind after Extreme Evoboost.</li> <li>92 Special Attack allows Eevee to OHKO Toxapex with Stored Power after Extreme Evoboost.</li> <li>Eevium Z is mandatory in running Eevee since Extreme Evoboost is its only niche.</li> <li>Anticipation is good to scout for Pokemon that carry Fighting-type coverage, such as Sacred Sword Aegislash and Focus Blast Alakazam.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Speed control is essential when using Eevee, as going first allows Eevee to get boosts before the foe, and potentially allowing it to survive a hit. Tailwind is a huge help against most teams, but against teams with Speed Boost Pokemon such as Blaziken, Trick Room should be used.</li> <li>Eevee should be pivoted to be brought in safely, such as from a slow U-turn or via Memento, as its bulk is terrible.</li> <li>Eevee can usually set up on defensive Pokemon like Cresselia and Porygon2 due to them not doing much back.</li> <li>Eevee is very matchup dependent, so make sure to check the Team Preview to make sure the opponent doesn't have a counter to Eevee, as sometimes it may be better to not bring it if the opponent doesn't have anything that Eevee can set up on, as they can usually force it out or KO it.</li> <li>Seeing Eevee in Team Preview usually forces the opponent to prepare for it, so you can use that to your advantage to predict what they're likely to bring - the most important things to watch out for include Mega Gengar, Hippowdon, Toxapex and Primarina, who have access to Taunt, Whirlwind, Haze and Perish Song, respectively. Eevee's teammates should ideally use Taunt on any possible switch ins, as this can be crucial to ensuring a successful sweep with Eevee.</li> <li>Eevee becomes a liability after using Baton Pass, so be sure that its teammates can support it and sweep with the boosts it passes.</li> <li>Picking the right recipient for Eevee's Baton Pass is essential - against phazers such as Hippowdon, you may want Espeon, as it is immune to phazing moves. However, Clefable might be more helpful against teams where Clefable's bulk might be more suitable, or teams with Curse Mimikyu.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Espeon and Clefable can be great recipients of Baton Pass thanks to their access to Stored Power. Espeon in particular also has Magic Bounce, which makes it immune to status, preventing it from getting worn down by Toxic, and phazing moves like Roar and Whirlwind, while Clefable's Magic Guard helps in matchups against Curse Mimikyu, as the Curse gets Baton Passed, which can stop your sweep.</li> <li>Strong Pokemon such as Mega Gyarados and Mega Kangaskhan appreciate the boosts Eevee gives, as both of them gain the ability to break through physical walls after a boost - they also can break through Mimikyu's Disguise thanks to Mold Breaker in Mega Gyarados's case and Parental Bond in Mega Kangaskhan's.</li> <li>Supporting Pokemon can help Eevee get a Baton Pass off. Whimsicott in particular is a great candidate for this role, as it can use Memento and Taunt, which lets it enable Eevee to set up freely or force a switch from the foe, and prevent Taunt, Perish Song, Haze and Whirlwind from opposing Pokemon, respectively. It also has access to Tailwind to patch up Eevee's poor Speed. Whimsicott can also use Worry Seed to deal with Serperior, as otherwise it can set up easily on Eevee thanks to Contrary Leaf Storm, and can OHKO Eevee even through the Special Defense boosts. Mental Herb Dusknoir is another potential lead, as it gets access to Taunt, Memento, Haze and Trick Room. Trick Room is good against Pokemon with Speed Boost like Blaziken and against Dragon Dance users. Haze in conjunction with Trick Room is useful to remove potential boosts from opponents. Using a lead that is not Whimsicott is useful in certain situations, such as against Dark-types like Tyranitar and Mega Gyarados, which are immune to Whimsicott's Prankster. A useful teammate to have is a Smeargle with Geomancy, Cotton Guard and Taunt holding a Power Herb, as it can help for matchups against Primarina, Politoed, and Milotic. As those are users of Perish Song and Haze that Eevee can't OHKO, Eevee can be swapped for Smeargle to beat these Pokemon.</li> </ul>"

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Snorlax's excellent Special Defense and a lone weakness to Fighting make it difficult to KO without relying on dedicated Fighting-types. This allows Snorlax to blanket check a number of dangerous threats, such as Tapu Lele, Naganadel, Greninja, and Volcarona. On top of this, Snorlax can utilize Gluttony, a pinch Berry, and Recycle to give itself an access to consistent recovery, which further improves its defensive capabilities. These factors can make Snorlax a problematic Pokemon to deal with, especially for teams that lack a way to immediately threaten it. However, Snorlax can struggle with physical attackers due to a low Defense stat and a lack of resistances. This means setting up Curse can be somewhat difficult with the prevalence of powerful physical attackers. Abysmal Speed can also be a detrimental factor for Snorlax, as it will be vulnerable to status moves, particularly Taunt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fissure on the phazing set can let Snorlax occasionally outright KO a problematic foe, but its inconsistency leaves this generally an inferior option. Facade on Curse can be used to take advantage of status, but if a foe would status Snorlax, they would most likely afflict it with Toxic poison to make Snorlax eventually succumb to a residual damage, and this leaves Return a far more desirable STAB move due to its consistency. Double-Edge has a better damage output than Return, but it is somewhat counterproductive to Snorlax's gameplan to consistently take hits and set up Curse. Snorlax has access to other useful abilities like Immunity, which helps with one of Snorlax's greatest annoyances by granting it an immunity to poison status, and Thick Fat, which significantly improves Snorlax's ability to check Fire- and Ice-types. These abilities may make defensive sets like Assault Vest plausible options, but there are many other Pokemon in the metagame that can blanket check a significantly larger array of threats, and the fact that the most common Fire-type Pokemon in the metagame, Mega Blaziken, possesses a Fighting typing makes Snorlax a disappointing check for Fire-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type moves</strong>: Fighting-types are capable of bypassing Snorlax's enormous bulk by exploiting its weakness to their STAB attacks. If they would not outright OHKO it, most Fighting-type attacks are capable of weakening Snorlax to the point where it would no longer be effective. Mega Blaziken, Mega Lucario, and Pheromosa are terrifying threats to Snorlax in this regard, but none of them can safely switch into Snorlax, and they do not appreciate switching into Yawn either, as they are forced to switch out or fall asleep next turn. Pokemon that may carry a Fighting-type move as a coverage option, such as Tapu Bulu, Mega Metagross, and Kartana, can threaten to heavily damage Snorlax. Kartana in particular is more threatening due to its ability to take a few Earthquakes and hit Snorlax through Curse boosts with Sacred Sword. However, the former two may struggle bypassing a healthy Snorlax, as in some instances Snorlax's Iapapa Berry may prevent a 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Though Snorlax typically prepares for Ghost-types by employing moves like Heavy Slam and Earthquake, Ghost-types like Mega Gengar, Mimikyu, and Aegislash are notable threats to Snorlax for different reasons, aside from being immune to Snorlax's STAB Return. Mega Gengar can trap and cripple Snorlax with Taunt or Will-O-Wisp, force its removal with a well-timed use of Destiny Bond, or stall Snorlax and remove it with Perish Song should it lack a reliable way to threaten Mega Gengar. Mimikyu, although it dislikes offensively taking on Snorlax with Curse, is still capable of removing Snorlax with a boosted Let's Snuggle Forever. Variants with Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, or Curse prove to be an annoyance for Snorlax as well. Aegislash, if running a defensive set, can put Snorlax on a timer with Toxic and can easily stall out Curse sets with a combination of King's Shield and Substitute. Offensive variants with Weakness Policy can rather take advantage of Curse Snorlax as long as it hasn't been excessively boosted beforehand, as Aegislash can easily survive an Earthquake and then retaliate the next turn with a boosted Sacred Sword.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Without Iapapa Berry, Snorlax is no longer able to utilize its high bulk and fulfill its role efficiently. Therefore, it must play extremely cautiously against potential users of Knock Off or Trick, such as Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, Kartana, and all Rotom formes.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to Snorlax's tendency to avoid potential KOs with a combination of Recycle and Iapapa Berry, boosted attacks or wallbreakers often pose a problem to it. Users of Swords Dance or Nasty Plot such as Mimikyu and Garchomp for the former and Naganadel and Thundurus-T for the latter can KO Snorlax with a boosted Z-Move with or without prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Snorlax largely relies on its utility options to fulfill its roles and stay healthy, and due to this, it is vulnerable to Taunt users such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Mega Gengar. However, most of them can get 2HKOed by common Snorlax variants.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Snorlax's extremely low Speed leaves it vulnerable to all kind of status moves and even from many status inducers that are slow by the metagame's standards. Toxic puts Snorlax on a timer, while a burn induced by Will-O-Wisp, Scald, or Lava Plume neuters Snorlax's damage putout and forces Curse variants to fully set up to do notable damage to foes. Snorlax is vulnerable to Breloom's Spore as well.</p>",

      "Phazer": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Snorlax can reliably shuffle foes with Whirlwind and rack up damage when Stealth Rock is up. Yawn is another move that often forces a foe to switch out by discouraging it from staying in. It is also useful with preventing Snorlax's team from losing momentum in the event where a foe that offensively checks Snorlax switches in and potentially lets Snorlax provide a safe setup condition for one of its teammates. Recycle in tandem with Iapapa Berry (or other similar pinch berries) and Gluttony lets Snorlax recover itself and remain longer as an annoyance for opposing team. The fourth move should be an attacking move to prevent Snorlax from being completely passive. Heavy Slam is typically the best option, as no foes are immune to it and the move does heavy damage to Fairy-types and frail foes like Mega Gengar. Earthquake is an alternative option that can notably OHKO a problematic Heatran and can still 2HKO Mega Gengar and Tapu Koko.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>28 Attack EVs allow Snorlax to, with Stealth Rock on the field, OHKO Tapu Lele and Mimikyu and 2HKO Tapu Koko and bulky Mega Gengar with Heavy Slam, preventing it from taking too much damage or punishing them should they attempt to cripple Snorlax with Taunt. The rest of the EVs are invested into Defense and Special Defense to maximize Snorlax's overall bulk with an Impish nature. 4 HP EVs set Snorlax's HP to even number, making Iapapa Berry activate after getting hit by Nature's Madness. Investing into both defenses aids Snorlax in taking hits, notably letting it avoid 2HKO from Modest Tapu Lele's Psychic. Gluttony makes Snorlax consume its Berry after it loses more than half of its HP, and Iapapa Berry heals Snorlax's health by 50%. Aguav Berry and Figi Berry are alternatives to bypass item clause if one of Snorlax's teammates is already holding Iapapa Berry.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to its sheer bulk, Snorlax can continuously rack up damage on foes when Stealth Rock is up by forcing switches with Whirlwind and Yawn while keeping itself healthy with Recycle. Phazing a foe with Whirlwind is a good idea when a foe is going to switch out to Snorlax's offensive checks or attempt to set up on it. Otherwise, Yawn is usually a good move to use, as an opponent is forced into either switching out and making the switch-in take the damage from Stealth Rock or having one of their Pokemon fall asleep. Repeatedly using Yawn against bulkier teams is typically the best option, as this eventually forces one of the foes to be put to sleep, letting Snorlax take advantage of them to phaze foes more reliably or giving a safe switch to one of its teammates that can take advantage of a sleeping foe. Although a combination of Whirlwind and Yawn usually prevents Snorlax from being used as a setup fodder, be wary of Substitute users like Mega Salamence and Mega Gyarados, as they can use Snorlax as a setup fodder if they are the last Pokemon in the team and are behind Substitute. Substitute variants of Celesteela and Gliscor can pose problems to Snorlax in the same regard. Lastly, be very wary of foes that are capable of removing Snorlax's Iapapa Berry, as this can outright shut down Snorlax by preventing it from recovering. This means Snorlax must be cautious of Rotom's Trick and face the likes of Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Mega Mawile carefully. Status moves, while not as devastating as item removal moves, should also be avoided, as poison greatly reduces Snorlax's longevity while burn leaves it very passive.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A physically durable Stealth Rock user pairs the best with this variant of Snorlax, as Snorlax can take advantage of said entry hazard to rack up damage by phazing foes and handle special attackers in return. Landorus-T and Skarmory are excellent choices in this regard. Landorus-T, while it lacks a reliable recovery, can handle Steel-types and Ground-types, which are quite hard to wear down with Stealth Rock damage. It also handles Heatran, which is very problematic for Snorlax to deal with due to it typically carrying Toxic or Taunt. Skarmory, on the other hand, can switch into Toxic for Snorlax, blanket check strong physical attackers like Mega Salamence and Landorus-T, and phaze foes itself. Mega Gengar can remove Pokemon that are offensively threatening or defensively troublesome for Snorlax and Skarmory . It also benefits from Snorlax's Yawn, as its Hex will massively damage foes that are asleep. A bulky, strong teammate is recommended as well to ensure that the last foe, which cannot be phazed, is reliably dealt with. Mega Salamence and Mega Gyarados are excellent choices, as they can switch into predicted Fighting-type moves for Snorlax and vastly appreciate having their checks being put to sleep or worn down by Stealth Rock. Mega Blaziken is notable for being capable of turning itself into a fearsome cleaner after a turn of setup, which can be easily done if Snorlax put a foe to sleep. Priority users are also feasible choices to deal with the last Pokemon. Greninja can quickly dispose of offensive foes like Landorus-T and Mega Blaziken, both of which are capable of overpowering Snorlax and its common teammates if using Swords Dance.</p>"
      },
      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse improves both Snorlax's damage output and its bulk, and improving its Defense is especially important, as setting up multiple Curses helps Snorlax overcome one of its defensive shortcomings. Recycle in tandem with Gluttony and Iapapa Berry provides Snorlax with a reliable recovery. Return is a consistent STAB move that becomes progressively more dangerous as Snorlax accumulates boosts from Curse. Earthquake hits various foes that resist Return super effectively, such as Heatran, Aegislash, Mega Metagross, and Tyranitar, and serves as the quickest way to dispose of Mega Blaziken, Naganadel, and Mega Lucario after a Curse. Fire Punch, while it has worse coverage overall, still hits many Steel-types super effectively and deals heavy damage to Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Kartana. It also hits Celesteela hard, unlike Earthquake.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread is focused on improving Snorlax's physical bulk as much as possible, as Snorlax isn't physically durable until it manages to set up multiple Curses, and heavy investment in Defense EVs is needed to maximize Curse's efficiency. While making such investment, appropriate distribution of EVs to other stats and an Adamant nature are applied for Snorlax to meet a number of important benchmarks against extremely common threats. 148 HP, 252 Defense, and 92 Special Defense allow Snorlax to survive +1 Adamant Mega Salamence's Double-Edge, avoid the 2HKO from Modest Tapu Lele's Psychic and Garchomp's Outrage, and Jolly Blaziken's High Jump Kick most of the time. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack along with an Adamant nature to amplify Snorlax's damage output to a degree. Gluttony and Iapapa Berry are mandatory to keep Snorlax healthy to let it reliably set up Curse on foes that it isn't threatened too much against. Other pinch Berries like Aguav and Figi Berry can be used to get around Item Clause.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This variant of Snorlax aims to take advantage of a bulky foe that can't effectively combat it by setting up multiple Curses to the point where Snorlax becomes nigh impossible to surmount and gains enough offensive presence to make a sweep of its own. Snorlax can easily set up on common Pokemon like Greninja and Tapu Koko and repeat a combination of Recycle and Curse to the point where it can overpower them with boosted attacks. Although setting up with this set may seem simple, always be cautious about any Pokemon that may carry status moves, such as Heatran, Cresselia, and Zapdos. Although Snorlax can easily take any hits from them, said foes tend to carry Toxic, which prevents Snorlax from effectively fulfilling its role. Potential users of Knock Off and Trick, namely all Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, Mega Mawile, and all Rotom formes should also be scouted beforehand so that Snorlax won't lose its Iapapa Berry and be left unable to heal itself. Although less of an issue, potential OHKO move users like Gliscor or Excadrill and Perish Song users like Politoed must be played with caution as well.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Landorus-T is the best partner for Snorlax, being able to aid Snorlax in a variety of ways. Almost every variant of Landorus-T can viably run Stealth Rock to ensure that Focus Sash users can't recklessly take on boosted Snorlax. Both defensive and Assault Vest variants of Landorus-T can safely bring Snorlax into a favorable matchup so that it can easily set up Curse. Swords Dance variants can take care of problematic defensive Pokemon such as Gliscor, Hippowdon, and Tapu Fini by OHKOing them all with boosted Supersonic Skystrike. Landorus-T's ability to naturally threaten troublesome foes like Mega Gengar and Heatran and switch into Fighting-type moves for Snorlax is appreciated as well. Tapu Fini is another fantastic partner, as Misty Terrain prevents Snorlax from getting crippled by status ailments. On top of being able to handle physical attackers like Mega Salamence and Mega Blaziken that would overwhelm Snorlax, Tapu Fini can wear down various foes with Nature's Madness, or, if running an offensive set, can even lure and eliminate walls like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn. Tapu Lele, while it is not defensively capable of checking Fighting-types, can still massively threaten them and can potentially provide Snorlax with a situation to reliably set up Curse by afflicting a foe with Taunt before it is KOed. Heatran can switch into various status moves for Snorlax and can spread status ailments itself, meaning it can put a problematic Pokemon on a timer with Toxic or spread burn to make physical attackers struggle even more with Snorlax as it sets up Curse. As Snorlax can take on essentially any offensive foe that lacks setup options or can heavily damage it, any teammates that can alleviate Snorlax's vulnerability to status ailments and can handle Fighting-types are generally good fits.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Unlike other Electric-types, such as Tapu Koko and Thundurus-T, Zapdos has the ability to run defensive sets to take on dangerous attackers, including Mega Salamence, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Lucario. Zapdos is one of the few Electric-types with access to reliable recovery in the form of Roost, which helps it stay healthy and perform its defensive role. In addition, Zapdos has a unique niche with its access to Heat Wave, allowing it to threaten Steel-types, particularly Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, making it a good fit in a variety of team archetypes.</p> <p>However, Zapdos's defensive capability is sometimes hindered by Stealth Rock; furthermore, Zapdos's defensive stats are not stellar, so it is reliant on its typing to effectively function as a wall.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Specially defensive Zapdos can be a good fit for some teams; it trades being able to handle Dragon Dance Mega Salamence and Mega Gyarados for being significantly better at taking on offensive Tapu Fini and Primarina, especially their Z-move variants.</li> <li>Offensive sets using either Choice Scarf or Electrium Z can be effective options, utilizing Zapdos's access to Heat Wave to provide it a niche over the generally preferred Thundurus-T.</li> <li>Substitute can be used in conjunction with Pressure and Roost to further exhaust a foe's PP. This style of Zapdos is best played with high Speed investment, allowing the Substitute to take the brunt of most strong attacks. However, fitting Substitute in will mean giving up on valued coverage moves, which significantly changes how Zapdos is played.</li> <li>Roar allows Zapdos to phaze foes that are setting up to dangerous levels or rack up damage with Stealth Rock set by another member of your team. Though, as with Substitute, it can be difficult to find the space in an already tight moveset.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: While being resistant to Electric-type moves and immune to Toxic, Mega Venusaur's ability in Thick Fat lets it handle Heat Wave and Hidden Power Ice with ease. It can also wear down Zapdos quite quickly with Leech Seed and Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Strong Rock- and Ice-type Attacks</strong>: Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Cloyster, and Protean Greninja are able to super effectively hit Zapdos using their Ice-type STAB moves and substantially weaken it. Likewise, Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar can threaten Zapdos with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Strong Neutral Hits</strong>: Zapdos is often reliant on its typing to take on various threats. Due to its mediocre defensive stats, strong neutral hits can overwhelm Zapdos. For example, Mega Charizard X can OHKO Zapdos with Flare Blitz or Outrage after Stealth Rock damage and a Dragon Dance boost. Mega Charizard Y can also easily 2HKO Zapdos with a Drought-boosted Fire-type STAB move of its choice, and terrain boosts allow Tapu Lele to 2HKO it with Psychic and Tapu Koko to 2HKO it using Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Zapdos loses 25% of its max HP every time it switches in on Stealth Rock; this can seriously hinder its ability to wall certain threats.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Due to the fact that Zapdos has to keep itself healthy throughout the match to function as a wall, it dislikes any residual damage—especially Toxic, which will put a timer on Zapdos, leaving it unable to stay active for many consecutive turns without taking substantial amounts of damage.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Volt Switch functions as a STAB move that hits Water- and Flying-types super effectively while helping Zapdos's team gain momentum and bring in a teammate safely. However, being forced to switch is not always a positive trait of this move, as damage from Stealth Rock can build quickly with the additional pivoting.</li> <li>Thunderbolt is Zapdos's strongest accurate Electric-type move.</li> <li>Discharge has a considerable chance to paralyze foes, which can leave them significantly more vulnerable to being revenge killed.</li> <li>Heat Wave is one of Zapdos's primary selling points as a defensive tank; the coverage it provides alongside Zapdos's Electric-type STAB move is invaluable. It allows Zapdos to effectively check Kartana, Excadrill, Mega Lucario, and Mega Scizor.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice heavily damages Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Garchomp. This keeps them from setting up further, forcing them to launch a last-ditch effort attack or to simply switch out.</li> <li>Toxic is a good utility move that puts a timer on defensive behemoths such as Porygon2 and Cresselia.

This can be particularly useful when Zapdos has to switch frequently while Stealth Rock is active, as it will activate automatically when Zapdos is put below 25% of its max HP.</li> <li>Leftovers provides a steady and much-welcomed source of passive recovery. This can help alleviate the damage taken from harmful weather and status on a turn-by-turn basis.</li> <li>Static punishes contact attacks with a significant chance to paralyze. This can be particularly useful when Zapdos is being used to take on certain physical attackers that are either naturally fast or boost their own Speed, such as Kartana, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Pressure helps Zapdos use Roost to stall out foes that rely on low-PP moves such as Stone Edge and Fire Blast. It also allows for a means of checking the foe's Speed; when Zapdos is led or brought in after a double KO, take note of whether Pressure activates before a foe's ability to determine which Pokemon is faster.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Since this set aims to use Zapdos as a physical wall, use it to switch into the dangerous physical attackers it can handle such as Mega Salamence, Mega Gyarados, Azumarill, and Mega Scizor.</li> <li>When using Toxic in combination with either Discharge or Static, be careful not to paralyze Pokemon you need to badly poison. Accidentally paralyzing a Porygon2, for instance, could leave it significantly harder to KO than if it were badly poisoned.</li> <li>Even without much Speed investment, Zapdos is still faster than many bulky attackers. It can use its naturally high Speed to its advantage and attempt to stall out the PP of certain Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type moves with Pressure and Roost.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Zapdos is often paired with Pokemon that struggle with Mega Salamence or bulky Water-types, appreciating Zapdos handling them.

Dragonite’s movepool is also notably expansive, so it has a selection of good physical and special moves to use while boasting an outragingly high Attack stat and above average Special Attack stat, respectively. Unlike most Dragon-types similar to Dragonite, it does not need a mega stone to evolve which makes it easier to use for teambuilding purposes. Unfortunately, only having access to 4 move slots really hurts Dragonite’s usefulness as there are many coverage options it’d like to run all at once, and while its Attack stat is very high, it is often outclassed in power to other Dragon-types such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Salamence.</p> <p>Below are some sample sets. These sets are likely to be standard, but they will be expanded upon and updated as the metagame progresses.</p>",

Fly can be used to hit Tapu Lele very hard, and when used in tandem with Flyinium Z, Dragonite's usual checks much harder than it could with Dragonite’s other available options including Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Venusaur. Fire Punch hits Steel-types that are neutral or immune to Ground-type moves, such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Scizor.</li> <li>Lum Berry can be used on Dragonite to avoid status moves for a turn, as Dragonite is very susceptible to all of them.</li> <li>Flyinium-Z when used along with Fly gives Dragonite another STAB to use once in the game, hurting anything that doesn’t resist it for some nice damage.</li> <li>Dragonium-Z prevents Dragonite from being locked into Outrage once, and also gives it an insanely powerful attack that can dent something once.</li> <li>Jolly allows Dragonite to outspeed threats like Tapu Koko, Mega Gengar, and Adamant Choice Scarf Landorus-T, giving it the upper hand in these matchups.</li> <li>Adamant gives Dragonite more power to it attacks, most notably being able to OHKO Tapu Koko guaranteed without a Dragon Dance boost. Although the power boost is appreciated, Dragonite will fail to outspeed Tapu Koko and Mega Gengar after a Dragon Dance.</li> <li>If using Extreme Speed, it’s best to save Dragonite for late game when everything is weakened; this gives it both an easier time of setting up and being able to clean up the opposing team. Otherwise, Dragonite can be used either early-game to weaken teams or late-game to clean everything up after it’s all set up. Be careful of switching Dragonite into attacks though; Multiscale will only work at full health and it can be pretty frail otherwise.</li> <li>Dragonite absolutely despises Ice-type moves and Fairy-types, so a Steel-type to switch into these is highly recommended.</li> <li>Wallbreakers can help wear down Pokemon that Dragonite has a tough matchup against such as Cresselia, Porygon2, Tapu Fini, and Suicune.</li> <li>Stealth Rock support can help Dragonite secure more KOs when sweeping.</li> </ul>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its excellent bulk and great defensive typing, Mega Scizor can act as a solid offensive check to threats such as Mimikyu, Mega Metagross, Tapu Bulu, and Mamoswine. Access to reliable recovery in Roost allows Mega Scizor to not only stay healthy throughout the match but also set up Swords Dance more easily. It can use its Technician-boosted Bullet Punch to easily revenge kill weakened threats, particularly Focus Sash users. Mega Scizor can further support its teammates with utility moves like Knock Off to hinder walls and U-turn to gain momentum on predicted switches. In addition, Mega Scizor can utilize its bulk, access to Roost, and immunity to Toxic to proactively punish the likes of Gliscor, Ferrothorn, Cresselia, and defensive variants of Landorus-T by using them as setup fodder. However, Mega Scizor's offensive capabilities are limited due to the popularity of Hidden Power Fire and the presence of several Fire-types capable of checking it. Furthermore, Mega Scizor's mediocre Speed forces it to rely on Bullet Punch to threaten offensive teams, which leaves Mega Scizor checked by faster foes such as Mega Salamence, Zapdos, and Thundurus, and Mega Scizor is hard checked by a number of common defensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Celesteela, Zapdos, and Toxapex. Lastly, the prevalence of Tapu Lele is detrimental to Mega Scizor; while Tapu Lele itself can't do much back without Hidden Power Fire, Psychic Terrain prevents Mega Scizor from using Bullet Punch, leaving it unable to sweep and much easier to revenge kill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Quick Attack is another Technician-boosted priority move that hits Fire- and Water-types harder than Bullet Punch, but Mega Scizor mostly prefers the utility from U-turn or Knock Off. Bug Bite is a stronger Bug-type STAB move that can also take advantage of pinch Berry users such as defensive Landorus-T and Celesteela but does not generate momentum like U-turn does. Using Mega Scizor as a defensive pivot by forgoing Swords Dance and running Toxic or Iron Defense looks good on paper, but Skarmory outclasses Mega Scizor in this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Blaziken, and Heatran force Mega Scizor out and can advantage of the free turn. They can also easily survive a boosted Bullet Punch if they haven't taken excessive damage beforehand. However, they do not like losing their items to Knock Off, taking sizable damage from Thief, or losing momentum via U-turn as Mega Scizor switches into their counter.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Some Steel-types are problematic for Mega Scizor to bypass due to their resistance to Bullet Punch and high bulk. Celesteela is a hard stop to any Mega Scizor variant and is able to easily 2HKO it with Flamethrower and annoy potential switch-ins with Leech Seed. Aegislash hopelessly shuts down variants of Mega Scizor lacking Dark-type attack and forces variants with said moves into mind games due to King's Shield. Magnezone only fears Superpower and can 2HKO Mega Scizor in return with Analytic-boosted Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire. Defensive teams commonly run Skarmory, which can beat Mega Scizor thanks to Iron Defense.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Toxapex and Milotic easily take any attack from Mega Scizor and remove its boosts with Haze. Gyarados can use Mega Scizor as a setup fodder due to Intimidate, its typing, and the fact that it carries irremovable items in most instances to take even boosted Dark-type moves. Swampert can take hits from Mega Scizor well thanks to its good bulk and can with force Mega Scizor out with Yawn. Suicune is even harder to take down with brute force and can phaze Mega Scizor with Roar. Pelipper heavily damages Mega Scizor with rain-boosted attacks and easily switches in thanks to its typing. In general, it is risky for Mega Scizor to stay in against Water-types due to a potential burn from Scald.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Mega Manectric have enough bulk to handle boosted Bullet Punch and hit back with Heat Wave and Flamethrower, respectively. All Rotom formes naturally outspeed Mega Scizor and easily take any boosted hit after burning it with Will-O-Wisp. Thundurus-T can easily revenge kill Mega Scizor or use it as setup fodder thanks to its resistance to Bullet Punch. However, Electric-types that do not resist U-turn take notable chunk of damage from it if they are switched in carelessly.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Mega Salamence is relatively unfazed even by boosted Bullet Punch thanks to Intimidate and its great natural bulk, and it can 2HKO Mega Scizor in return using Double-Edge or OHKO it after a Dragon Dance. Mega Mawile is similarly advantaged against Mega Scizor and can remove it very easily if using Fire Fang.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Mega Scizor's Attack and lets it clean weakened teams and break through walls with brute force. Bullet Punch, factoring STAB and Technician, is a very strong priority move and Scizor's primary tool for sweeping. The third move can vary depending on what Mega Scizor needs to accomplish. U-turn allows Mega Scizor to pivot out of unfavorable matchups while doing chip damage and is extremely handy to gain momentum on forced switches. Knock Off hits Aegislash, which otherwise walls this set, and removes important items such as Leftovers and Eviolite from foes. Thief is an alternative option that allows Scizor to consistently use 90-Base Power Dark-type attack at the cost of being unable to remove items, while Superpower allows Mega Scizor to heavily damage and in some cases KO Heatran, Mega Lucario, Magnezone, Kartana, and Stakataka on switch as well as dent Blaziken. Roost allows Mega Scizor to stay healthy throughout the match while setting up Swords Dance against passive threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with Adamant nature ensures that Mega Scizor OHKOes Mega Gengar and Naganadel with +2 Bullet Punch and OHKOes Tapu Koko and Volcarona the same way after Stealth Rock damage. Defensively, the spread allows Mega Scizor to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Gengar's Shadow Ball and Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake and also lets it take a Hydro Pump from offensive Tapu Fini after being hit by Nature's Madness. The EV spread is very flexible depending on which threats Mega Scizor needs to check; 44 Defense EVs allow Mega Scizor to take two +2 Shadow Claw from Adamant Mimikyu, while 148 Special Defense EVs allow Mega Scizor to avoid the 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Psychic at a significant cost in power. A straightforward EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Speed with an Adamant nature is a viable option that allows Mega Scizor to OHKO Mega Charizard Y and the rare Blacephalon with +2 Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock damage and outspeed Modest Magnezone and Adamant Breloom. The spread also allows it to make faster and more aggressive play in general.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Scizor's performance is very dependent on the matchup, and careful decisions must be made in Team Preview. It is not a good idea to use Mega Scizor in the first place if a Fire-type from opposing team is likely to be chosen unless the rest of Mega Scizor's team is sufficiently prepared for it. Picking Mega Scizor is a promising idea against offensive teams so that it can pick off weakened threats with Bullet Punch and set up Swords Dance to effectively sweep. It is also a good idea to take advantage of passive walls like defensive Landorus-T and Ferrothorn. U-turn generates momentum on switches, so it is a good move to use when the opponent is likely to send in a physical wall or one of Mega Scizor's counters. Knock Off should be used to rid foes like Heatran, Zapdos, and Toxapex of their items while scouting potential Z-Crystals from other switch-ins. Especially against defensive teams, it is not a good idea to mindlessly start setting up Swords Dance until Mega Scizor's checks and counters have been sufficiently weakened or eliminated. Lastly, be wary of Hidden Power Fire users such as Porygon2 and Mega Venusaur, as they easily 2HKO Mega Scizor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon-types tend to pair well with Mega Scizor because they can switch into Fire-type moves for it and Mega Scizor can take Dragon-, Fairy-, and Ice-type attacks for them in return. Naganadel and Latios are good partners in this regard. Naganadel can either severely weaken opposing teams with brute force from Nasty Plot-boosted attacks or break walls that Mega Scizor weakens or hinders with Knock Off, while Latios works as a great revenge killer with Choice Scarf, threatens Toxapex, and can provide Mega Scizor better setup opportunities by crippling a wall with Trick. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp threaten Steel-types and set Stealth Rock for Mega Scizor. Landorus-T in particular weakens foes with Intimidate and uses U-turn to bring Mega Scizor in safely, and physically defensive variants are excellent switch-ins to Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Blaziken that immensely threaten Mega Scizor. Island Guardians remove Psychic Terrain for Mega Scizor to freely use Bullet Punch. Tapu Koko shuts down passive walls with Taunt, threatens Water-types, and brings Mega Scizor in safely with Volt Switch or U-turn. Tapu Fini is a great check to Mega Charizard X and Blaziken that also sets Misty Terrain, which blocks Will-O-Wisp and prevents burns from Scald.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 is one of the most versatile defensive threats in the Battle Spot Singles metagame, boasting incredible defenses with Eviolite and its Normal typing giving it only one weakness in Fighting. This makes Porygon2 incredibly difficult to OHKO, which also makes it one of the most reliable Trick Room setters in the format. Unlike other setters, Porygon2 has a decent offensive presence due to its respectable Special Attack and its Download ability, which allows it to take advantage of Trick Room effectively itself. Porygon2's bulk and great movepool also allow it to check a wide range of Pokemon including Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Mimikyu, functioning as an effective blanket check for teams lacking answers to various threats. Porygon2's reliance on Eviolite also makes it vulnerable to Knock Off, though, and its lack of resistances makes it difficult for Porygon2 to switch into boosted threats. Toxic and Stealth Rock damage also quickly chip away at Porygon2 and keep it from reliably checking more powerful threats, both of which are very common in Battle Spot Singles.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Thunder Wave can be used to cripple faster threats and create a sweeping opportunity for Porygon2's teammates, though relying on Discharge's paralysis chance is often safer, since it isn't completely shut down by Taunt and Substitute and provides some offensive pressure.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ground can be used on offensive variants specifically to deal with Heatran and Stakataka, which are often troublesome for common Trick Room setups. It provides little coverage beyond that, though, so it should only be considered if the aforementioned threats are an issue.</li> <li>Return can be used with Analytic on specially defensive sets to break through specially bulky foes such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y more easily. Return can also take advantage of Attack boosts from Download, though it relies on Attack boosts to be useful in this manner and can be a dead moveslot otherwise.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Blaziken, Mega Lucario, Breloom, Mega Lopunny, Mega Heracross, and Pheromosa can threaten Porygon2 with their STAB moves. Breloom in particular can threaten Trick Room setups with Spore, while Mega Heracross can take advantage of Trick Room itself, though the others must be wary of Trick Room, since they struggle if Trick Room is set up.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Porygon2 can't run coverage for all relevant Steel-types and can't use Toxic on them unlike most defensive threats, so Steel-types such as Aegislash, Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Heatran, and Mega Mawile can usually outlast or set up on Porygon2. Porygon2 typically beats special Aegislash unless it triggers Weakness Policy, since Sacred Sword isn't strong enough otherwise. It can also run coverage for any of the other Steel-types, so scouting out its set is important, though otherwise Porygon2 can't threaten them much.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Users</strong>: Porygon2 is difficult to take down without a Fighting-type move, so surprising it with an unexpected Toxic is an effective way to slowly break it down. Common defensive Pokemon such as Zapdos and opposing Porygon2 are effective Toxic users, but unexpected offensive threats such as Mamoswine are also effective Toxic users.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: While Z-Moves make Knock Off more difficult to use safely, it's still an effective way to shut down Porygon2 and make it much easier to deal with. Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Alolan Muk are all viable Knock Off users and most of them aren't overly threatened by Porygon2.</p> <p><strong>Z-Moves</strong>: Porygon2 is bulky enough to survive most Z-Moves, but as a defensive threat, Porygon2 is often a prime target of powerful Z-Moves that it struggles to recover from if it doesn't anticipate them. Fightinium Z users such as Thundurus-T, Tapu Bulu, and Kartana can realistically OHKO Porygon2, but other powerful Z-Move users such as Volcarona, Naganadel, and Tapu Lele can boost and surprise it to KO or come close enough to KOing that Porygon2 can't recover from it.</p>",

This notably allows Porygon2 to OHKO +2 Mimikyu with Foul Play, which it cannot achieve without the Analytic boost.</li> <li>The EV spread with a Bold nature minimizes the chance of Porygon2 being 2HKOed by Adamant Mega Salamence's Double-Edge while also minimizing the chance of it being 2HKOed by Modest Tapu Lele's Psychic.</li> <li>A Calm nature can be used with maximum Special Defense investment to function as more dedicated special wall if the ability to check physical attackers better isn't necessary.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Porygon2 is bulky enough to avoid being 2HKOed by a huge range of threats, so switching it directly into a Pokemon it's meant to check is often safe as long as it can safely use Recover on the next turn.</li> <li>While Porygon2's bulk allows it to outlast many threats, always be mindful of Porygon2's HP and be prepared to use Recover if it may be in 2HKO range even if it's healthy, because it will often act after the foe.</li> <li>Porygon2 hates losing its Eviolite, so be very careful around potential Knock Off users such as Landorus-T. However, Porygon2 can still function without Eviolite, so avoid letting it get KOed if its coverage can still prove useful.</li> <li>Porygon2's lack of resistances limits its ability to switch into boosted threats such as Mega Salamence, so avoid switching Porygon2 directly into these threats if Porygon2 is needed to check any boosting sweepers or powerful wallbreakers.</li> <li>If the opposing team appears to lack any answers to Porygon2, it can often win on its own, but always be careful of any potential Toxic users, since many teams will run Toxic solely to lure in Porygon2.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Porygon2 struggles against most Fighting-types, so it should be paired with teammates that can switch into these threats, such as Ghost- and Flying-types such as Mimikyu, Landorus-T, Aegislash, and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Primarina can deal with Fighting-types that threaten Porygon2.

Trick Room is typically not used with Recover, though, because using Recover under Trick Room wastes turns it should be using to attack.</li> <li>Tri Attack gives Porygon2 a reliable STAB move to hit foes that aren't weak to Ice Beam or Shadow Ball harder, making it a more consistent offensive threat.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire is primarily used to hit Ferrothorn, which otherwise walls Porygon2, but it also hits other Steel-types such as Celesteela and Mega Mawile.</li> <li>Thunderbolt can be used if Celesteela is a bigger problem than Ferrothorn, and it has the benefit of being able to take advantage of Tapu Koko's presence under Electric Terrain.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Eviolite is necessary for Porygon2 to take advantage of its solid defensive typing and bulk and gives it a lot of staying power even without full defensive investment.</li> <li>Download gives Porygon2 a chance to gain a 1.5x boost to its Special Attack, giving it a significant boost to break through foes.</li> <li>Many Pokemon are EVed specifically to avoid giving Porygon2 a Download boost, so Analytic can be used instead for a more consistent but smaller 1.3x boost. Analytic also requires Porygon2 to act after the foe, though its low Speed means this usually isn't a problem unless running Trick Room, in which case Download should be used instead.</li> <li>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature makes Porygon2 as powerful as possible, and the 244 HP EVs give it an odd HP value to reduce residual damage from the likes of Stealth Rock and sand. The remaining EVs are placed in Defense to increase its bulk.</li> <li>A Modest nature is typically used over a Quiet nature because minimizing Porygon2's Speed doesn't help it outspeed much under Trick Room. This also lets Porygon2 outspeed similarly slow Pokemon such as Azumarill outside of Trick Room and consistently attack after Aegislash under Trick Room.</li> <li>However, a Quiet nature can be used on teams that struggle with Mega Mawile, which most frequently runs an Adamant nature.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Porygon2 lacks the same level of bulk as a defensive variant, so be careful switching it into powerful attackers such as Mega Salamence and Tapu Lele, especially if it lacks Recover, since they're more likely to 2HKO Porygon2. It can still be relied upon as a blanket check to many threats, though, such as Mimikyu, Garchomp, and Greninja.</li> <li>If using Download, try to find opportunities to give Porygon2 the Special Attack boost so that it can break through teams more easily. Porygon2's Special Attack is still respectable without the boost, but it can have trouble breaking through bulkier foes such as Aegislash and Mega Kangaskhan without it.</li> <li>Porygon2 often forces switches due to its fantastic bulk, so take advantage of these switches to use Recover or to punish incoming threats if using Analytic.</li> <li>If running Trick Room, Porygon2 functions well as a lead so that it can set Trick Room up as soon as possible, since it has an easy time setting doing so unless the foe is a Fighting-type or running Fightinium Z.</li> <li>While Porygon2 will usually have teammates to take advantage of Trick Room as well, Porygon2 has enough offensive presence to make use of this itself, so it doesn't always need to rely on its teammates.</li> <li>Unlike defensive sets, losing its Eviolite doesn't bother offensive Porygon2 as much, since it can still rely on its power and coverage moves to beat foes, so avoid letting it get KOed too early even if it loses its Eviolite.</li> <li>Porygon2 struggles to take powerful hits without heavy defensive investment, so be mindful of situations where Porygon2 is better off getting in one last hit before going down instead of healing itself, especially if it can put a teammate in position to sweep.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Porygon2 appreciates teammates that can deal with Fighting-types, so Ghost-, Fairy-, and Flying-types that can switch into them safely such as Mimikyu, Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, Aegislash, and Mega Salamence are effective teammates.</li> <li>Fire-types such as Heatran, Blaziken, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y that can beat Steel-types pair well with Porygon2, since Porygon2 can't run coverage for all relevant Steel-types.</li> <li>Stall teams are problematic for Porygon2, since it lacks the power to break through bulkier teams, so it appreciates stallbreakers such as Taunt Tapu Fini and Mega Gengar to break through them.</li> <li>If running Trick Room, slow and powerful attackers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Heracross, Primarina, and Araquanid greatly benefit from Porygon2's reliable Trick Room support.</li> <li>While Porygon2 is a reliable Trick Room setter, it appreciates having another Trick Room user on the team that can threaten Breloom such as Safety Goggles Cresselia.</li> <li>Faster teammates such as Tapu Koko and Mega Salamence can still fit on teams with Trick Room Porygon2 and are particularly important so that you have fast teammates when setting Trick Room isn't a safe option.</li> </ul>"

  "Blaziken": {
    "overview": "<p>Blaziken is an incredibly versatile sweeper. Its access to Speed Boost allows Blaziken to easily snowball during late-game, threatening to outspeed and KO opposing Pokemon. This is made easier with its good Fire/Fighting-typing, making quick work of Pokemon such as Aegislash, Mamoswine, Ferrothorn, and Mega Mawile. Furthermore, its movepool allows it to act as a mixed attacker, capable of luring in Pokemon such as Mega Salamence or Landorus-T before KOing them with Hidden Power Ice, or being able to Baton Pass stat boosts onto one of its teammates. Finally, Blaziken has a strong Mega Evolution that allows it to outspeed key threats after one Speed Boost, such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p> <p>While it may reach an impressive Speed after a few boosts, its base stat is rather disappointing without Mega Evolving, leaving it outsped by most Choice Scarf users and fast Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Pheromosa at +1 if running a neutral nature. It is also frail, leaving it vulnerable to powerful priority moves, primarily Aqua Jet and boosted Extreme Speed. Even with its immense power, it struggles to break through particularly bulky Pokemon, most notably being Zapdos, Suicune, Cresselia, and Hippowdon, all of which can tank any unboosted move Blaziken throws at it while they threaten to KO it with their super effective STAB moves. Despite these flaws, Blaziken is an incredible attacker that can perform wonders when given the opportunity.</p> <p>Below are some sample sets.

High Jump Kick is its most powerful Fighting-type move, dealing heavy damage even to neutral targets, although it has a severe penalty if it misses. Superpower is more reliable than High Jump Kick, although it is less powerful and lowers Blaziken's Attack and Defense stats.</li> <li>Protect allows Blaziken to accumulate Speed boosts while potentially avoiding a fatal hit. However, Protect can be played around, allowing the opponent a free turn to set up or switch in a counter.</li> <li>Swords Dance allows Blaziken to more easily break through bulky foes.</li> <li>If Swords Dance's wallbreaking abilities are not needed, Stone Edge can be run to decimate Flying- and Fire-types, such as Gyarados, Mega Charizard Y, and Zapdos. Most notably, it prevents Blaziken from being walled by the rarer Chandelure and Alolan Marowak, both of which resist Flare Blitz, are immune to Blaziken's Fighting-type STAB, and deal severe damage with Shadow Ball and Shadow Bone, respectively.</li> <li>Baton Pass is additionally a viable option over Swords Dance, allowing Blaziken to maintain momentum while passing Speed boosts to its incoming teammate.</li> <li>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Blaziken to hit as hard as possible while being as fast as possible. A Jolly nature is preferred, allowing Blaziken to outspeed key threats such as Modest Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Mega Gengar.</li> <li>An Adamant nature is acceptable if using Mega Blaziken, though note that Timid Choice Scarf Tapu Lele will outspeed.</li> <li>Blazikenite allows the use of Mega Blaziken, whose extra Speed allows it to outspeed new threats such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, in addition to giving it a good power boost.</li> <li>Firium Z lets Blaziken use Z-Flare Blitz, capable of OHKOing even the likes of Cresselia after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>If a Z-Move or Mega Evolution is already taken, Life Orb is an acceptable substitute, boosting the power of all of Blaziken's moves at the cost of some of its health.</li> <li>Blaziken can be used early- to mid-game as a wallbreaker to weaken opposing teams for its own teammates to sweep afterwards.</li> <li>Blaziken can also be used as a sweeper itself late-game thanks to its excellent ability in Speed Boost, making it difficult for weakened teams to revenge kill it without priority.</li> <li>While using Protect is generally a safe move, scouting opponents while gaining a Speed boost, it can easily create mindgames. Keep this in mind when facing Pokemon that can take advantage of this.</li> <li>Blaziken greatly appreciates Stealth Rock support, allowing it to break through bulky opponents such as Suicune and Cresselia.</li> <li>Grass-types are great partners for Blaziken, as they can eliminate most Ground- and Water-types that pressure Blaziken.</li> <li>In a similar vein, Ice-types and Pokemon with Ice-type coverage moves can deal with Pokemon that threaten Blaziken like Mega Salamence and Landorus-T.</li> </ul>"

Unlike Flare Blitz, Overheat is able to circumvent moves and abilities that lower Attack, such as King's Shield and Intimidate.</li> <li>Superpower is the preferred Fighting-type STAB for this set, as mixed Blaziken doesn't mind the Attack drops as much, while being very reliable.

Solid defenses and an immunity to Electric make Mega Swampert a strong, bulky, and fast threat under the rain that is difficult to defensively check and swiftly take out. Apart from being a sweeper under rain support, Swampert can opt to stay in its regular forme and act as a bulky support Pokemon, using moves like Stealth Rock, Roar, and Yawn while retaining a different kind of offensive presence when compared to other leads.</p> <p>Though Mega Swampert's offensive prowess under rain cannot be overlooked, it is dependent on the rain to function due to its relatively low Speed in other weather conditions. This leaves Mega Swampert with a rigid and limited pool of Pokemon that it can synergize with. Mega Swampert can 2HKO many neutral targets with its STAB moves, but there are many Pokemon that can be used to pivot around Mega Swampert's STAB moves until the rain stops. Some Pokemon can switch into a resisted Waterfall, and other common Pokemon like Landorus-T and Mega Salamence can switch into Earthquake and weaken Mega Swampert in an emergency. This means there will be difficulty for Mega Swampert to function well as an offensive Pokemon even in rain. Mega Swampert also may compete with Kingdra as a Swift Swim sweeper, as Kingdra does not take a Mega slot, can hold an item of its choice, and sports a secondary typing that situationally has better coverage; however, Kingdra struggles against foes like Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Mimikyu that Mega Swampert fares better against.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Superpower can be used to heavily damage Ferrothorn and OHKO Kartana and Mega Gyarados. However, Mega Swampert is typically forced out after using Superpower due to the stat drops, and physically defensive Ferrothorn is not KOed by Superpower even after switching into Earthquake. Power-Up Punch allows Mega Swampert to take advantage of forced switches and serves as one of the very few ways to surmount over Porygon2. Ice Beam on a utility set heavily damages Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, and Garchomp, but it is hard to fit due to other moves that are typically more important for Mega Swampert.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Attacks</strong>: Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Breloom can easily dispose of Swampert with their STAB moves. As long as Mega Swampert lacks Superpower against Kartana and Tapu Bulu does not directly switch into Ice Punch, they can effectively mess with Mega Swampert. Tapu Bulu can pose further problems, as Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake. Breloom typically carries Focus Sash to check Mega Swampert, which its party cannot break beforehand due to the difficulty of fitting Stealth Rock onto another teammate. It can even anti-lead Rindo Berry Swampert due to Bullet Seed outright OHKOing it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Gyarados and Tapu Fini can prove to be nuisances that force hesitation from Mega Swampert. Gyarados is difficult to defeat due to its resistance to Mega Swampert's STAB moves and Intimidate, while Tapu Fini can avoid the 2HKO with Sitrus Berry even after directly switching into Earthquake and then retaliate. A healthy Primarina can revenge kill Mega Swampert with Oceanic Operetta. The rarer Rotom-W completely walls Mega Swampert, but it is punished by Substitute variants.</p> <p><strong>Weather Setters</strong>: Hippowdon and Tyranitar can switch in to remove rain, which is what Mega Swampert relies on to have the Speed advantage over various foes and power up its Waterfall. Mega Charizard Y can be more problematic, as it can pivot into a predicted Earthquake or survive any attack from full health under sun and immediately force a switch with the threat of Solar Beam.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Waterfall has the highest damage output of Mega Swampert's attacks under rain, and it can outright OHKO foes like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and uninvested Mimikyu. Earthquake is the biggest draw to using Mega Swampert, as it has a high damage output against foes like Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Primarina that are otherwise good checks to many Pokemon commonly employed on rain teams. Ice Punch is the best option that Mega Swampert can rely on to punish Grass-types like Breloom, Tapu Bulu, and Serperior. Ice Punch also has a varying damage output against Mega Salamence and Landorus-T (though note that Waterfall in the rain does more damage to Landorus-T), which can be lethal should they lack defensive investment.</p> <p>Substitute eases prediction against foes that attempt to switch around and wait for rain to stop, helps against Sucker Punch Mega Mawile and punishes Celesteela and Rotom-W, which can survive a hit and respond with status moves. Rock Tomb OHKOes Mega Charizard Y on the switch, and it eases the matchup against Mega Salamence and Mega Gyarados, which can use their abilities and typings to pivot into Mega Swampert until the rain stops. When rain support isn't available, Rock Tomb also eases the matchup against Mimikyu. Rain Dance is useful for setting up rain in case your rain setter has been KOed or you predict Mega Charizard Y to switch in.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>An Adamant nature is typically preferred to secure OHKOs against Tapu Lele and uninvested Landorus-T with an appropriate move and maximize Earthquake's damage output against Mega Metagross. Though it involves sacrificing a lot of power, a Jolly nature is possible to outspeed +1 Adamant Mega Salamence, Garchomp, and Choice Scarf Kartana. Damp prevents moves like Explosion, notably from Landorus-T, which may otherwise heavily damage Swampert before Mega Evolution.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Though Mega Swampert is difficult to deal with under the rain, it won't be too common for it to outright sweep the opposing team by itself. Most teams in Battle Spot Singles have airborne Pokemon to force mind games, and the prevalence of Focus Sash means it is likely that Mega Swampert is going to be revenge killed even when the matchup is in its favor. Therefore, it is typically better for Mega Swampert to focus on netting as much damage as possible during the rain. Unless there are Grass-types that can switch into Mega Swampert relatively easily and quickly force a switch, Mega Swampert can make aggressive moves to weaken various Pokemon and possibly benefit a secondary rain sweeper or another Pokemon on its team. Avoid needlessly wasting health against foes like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn that can win one-on-one and heal off the damage taken. Rather, be patient until they are sufficiently weakened or taken out by other teammates, as weakening Mega Swampert reduces the odds it can survive a hit against foes that it cannot outright run over. If teammates cannot effectively deal with a specific Pokemon, consider taking advantage of Waterfall's considerable chance to cause a flinch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A Pokemon with Drizzle is mandatory for Mega Swampert to immediately activate Swift Swim. Pelipper and Politoed are options, and Pelipper is typically preferred due to its ability to threaten Grass-types like Tapu Bulu with Hurricane and access to U-turn. However, Politoed is able to annoy Baton Pass teams with Perish Song and is bulkier, meaning it has more opportunities to set up rain throughout the game compared to Pelipper. It also is better at stomaching hits and bringing in Mega Swampert safely if its Eject Button is intact. Mega Swampert typically needs assistance from other offensive teammates, as it is common for most teams to be naturally prepared to stop it in some way. Kingdra can be a viable teammate should an opponent lack a solid Grass-type Pokemon to keep both Mega Swampert and Kingdra in check, and its ability to dispose of physical walls and Dragon-type Pokemon - particularly Mega Salamence, which can be an annoyance due to Intimidate and its resistance or immunity to Mega Swampert's moves - is appreciated.</p> <p>There has to be a sufficient countermeasure for Grass-types, as a rain setter and Mega Swampert struggle to effectively deal with them. Kartana can threaten Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and some Water-types, and it can benefit from Mega Swampert at worst weakening Mega Salamence and taking advantage of Celesteela if using Substitute. Ferrothorn can be used as an effective check to Serperior under rain and pivot into other Grass-types. Tapu Koko and Thundurus-T don't necessarily have good offensive or defensive synergy with Mega Swampert, but they can outpace many foes and fire strong Thunders under the rain, taking care of problematic Water-types that can force hesitation from Mega Swampert. Thundurus-T in particular can break through bulkier threats with Nasty Plot-boosted attacks, defeat Ferrothorn with Focus Blast, and even lure in Tapu Bulu and remove it with Sludge Wave if using a Choice Scarf set. Aegislash can be considered, as it can check Breloom and benefit from the offensive pressure applied to many Fire-types. Though they find it difficult to function under the rain, Fire-type Pokemon like Mega Charizard X and Y and Volcarona can be employed and supported by different teammates to punish Grass-types that are enticed by Mega Swampert's rain core from Team Preview.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swampert's good defensive typing, natural bulk, and EV investment combine to make it a viable Stealth Rock user that few Pokemon can threaten to immediately take down. Yawn prevents a foe from freely setting up on Swampert and can potentially provide an ideal setup condition for a teammate once a foe knocks out Swampert. Roar can forcefully remove a foe from the field, punishing Substitute users and racking up damage with Stealth Rock if a foe struggles to swiftly take down Swampert. Scald's burn chance may be counterproductive with Yawn inducing sleep, but Swampert's ability to at worst mildly annoy most foes that it leads against helps separate itself from Hippowdon. Earthquake prevents Swampert from being completely passive and hits foes like Mega Gengar, Mega Mawile, and Heatran.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Special Defense makes Swampert more difficult to break through for special attackers like Tapu Lele and Protean Greninja. A physically defensive EV spread with an Impish nature makes it possible for Swampert to better take hits against Pokemon like Landorus-T and Mega Charizard X and, notably, survive a boosted Double-Edge from Mega Salamence. Sitrus Berry enables Swampert to avoid a 2HKO from powerful attacks like Landorus-T's Earthquake, but Rindo Berry can be used to avoid being OHKOed by Mega Charizard Y's Solar Beam as well as Blaziken and Heatran's Bloom Doom. Rindo Berry also enables Swampert to survive Protean Greninja's Life Orb-boosted Grass Knot and grants it a higher chance to survive Bloom Doom.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swampert differentiates itself from other dedicated leads with limited options for foes to KO it before it uses Stealth Rock and other annoying status moves. If Grass-types are not present on the opposing team, Swampert will make for an effective lead the majority of the time due to its solid bulk and decent offensive presence. However, an opponent may use unusual Pokemon against Swampert, such as Greninja, Heatran, and Blaziken. This may be due to their potential to carry Grass-type moves that will swiftly take out Swampert, so if Swampert lacks a Rindo Berry, exercise caution against them. Depending on the foe, make appropriate decisions about what utility move should be used first. If Pokemon like Mega Salamence seem to be present on the opposing team and teammates will need prior damage to surmount them, prioritize setting up Stealth Rock. Against setup sweepers where a single free turn can bring harsh consequences, use Yawn first. If an opponent lacks Pokemon that will effectively pressure Swampert, focus on putting a Pokemon to sleep and chipping the opposing team as much as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Similarly to many teammates of a dedicated lead, powerful threats like Blaziken, Mega Salamence, and both formes of Mega Charizard can take advantage of the Stealth Rock support and a foe potentially being put to sleep. These Pokemon can also take advantage of Grass-types that attempt to lead against Swampert and limit its attempt to utilize Stealth Rock and Yawn. Tapu Lele can appreciate Swampert and its aforementioned partners applying massive pressure against Steel-types. It has room to customize its set to aid the team's matchup against faster teams by running a Choice Scarf set or by taking advantage of a foe being put to sleep and using Calm Mind to become more threatening. Mimikyu serves as a nice backup to foes that Swampert cannot sufficiently cover. It also packs Swords Dance to take advantage of foes being put to sleep, as well as other moves like Shadow Sneak and Let's Snuggle Forever to swiftly take out setup sweepers that may get out of hand in case Swampert can not handle them adequately.</p>"

U-turn also allows it to pivot into a rain sweeper more safely than Politoed and can help it maintain momentum against opposing weather setters. Pelipper's stats are generally underwhelming though, relegating it solely to a support role on teams utilizing rain sweepers such as Kingdra.</p> <p>Below is a sample set.

The newly introduced terrain setters in Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Fini also mess with Breloom’s usage, as Tapu Lele can prevent Breloom from using Mach Punch on opposing foes and both Tapu Koko and Tapu Fini make grounded Pokemon immune to Spore. It is worth mentioning that none of the Pokemon mentioned earlier can switch into Breloom safely to set up their respective terrains. However, these terrains are still fairly common in the Battle Spot Singles metagame, making Breloom tough to bring into battles.</p> <p>Below are some sample sets.

    "overview": "<p>Mega Mawile is a powerful wallbreaker capable of checking many common threats in Battle Spot Singles such as Mega Salamence and Tapu Lele. Its low Speed allows it to work as an effective Trick Room attacker, while access to Sucker Punch allows it to bypass its low Speed out of Trick Room. Mega Mawile's great defensive typing and access to Intimidate prior to Mega Evolution give it an easier time setting up and breaking through teams. However, Mawile's poor bulk before Mega Evolving makes it difficult to switch it into foes directly, and weaknesses to common Ground- and Fire-type moves bring it down. Its low Speed also makes it dependent on Trick Room to sweep reliably, so it usually requires support to be used effectively.</p> <p>Below is a sample set.

    "overview": "<p>Mega Manectric is a potent offensive pivot and revenge killer, capable of scouting opposing teams and generating momentum. Its blistering Speed tier lets it outpace a huge portion of the metagame, most notably including Tapu Koko and Mega Gengar. A sole weakness to Ground alongside Intimidate helps compensate for its mediocre bulk, and Intimidate in tandem with Volt Switch gives it the ability to easily scout and gain momentum. Mega Manectric also has a useful pre-Mega ability in Lightning Rod, which helps it switch into Electric-type moves such as Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt. However, Mega Manectric is held back by stiff competition from other Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, which has a Speed tier similar to Mega Manectric's but does not take a team’s Mega slot and deals greater damage with its Electric Terrain-boosted attacks. Even with outstanding coverage and a good Special Attack stat, Mega Manectric has slightly disappointing damage output for a Mega Evolution. Despite Intimidate and its decent typing, Mega Manectric struggles to take strong neutral hits, especially from special attackers such as Greninja and Tapu Lele, which limits its ability to pivot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Manectric's barren movepool leaves very few choices outside of the moves listed in the set above. Toxic could be used to cripple a Porygon2 switching in on Mega Manectric, but this forces Mega Manectric to give up on an important coverage move, making it a poor choice in most scenarios. It is also possible to run Thunder over Thunderbolt to have a 50% chance to OHKO Mega Gyarados, but its shaky accuracy makes it unreliable. This could be alleviated by pairing Mega Manectric with a rain setter such as Pelipper or Politoed, but the rain lowers the power of Manectric's Fire-type coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Anything faster than Mega Manectric becomes problematic for it; the naturally faster Pheromosa and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele, Landorus-T, and Excadrill can easily weaken Mega Manectric if not outright OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Porygon2, Heatran, and Chansey take pitiful damage from any attack that Mega Manectric can throw at them and slowly chip away at Manectric’s health.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Landorus-T, and Excadrill are immune to Mega Manectric’s Electric-type moves and threaten back with their STAB moves, though Landorus-T and Excadrill need to be cautious of Hidden Power Ice and Overheat.</p>",

Overheat or Flamethrower alongside Hidden Power Ice is vital because Fire- and Ice-type coverage on one set allows Manectric to hit Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Aegislash, which would otherwise wall Mega Manectric. This coverage also gives Mega Manectric a niche over Tapu Koko. Flamethrower is an option over Overheat that does not miss and conserves Manectric's Special Attack, though the power drop is very noticeable. Flamethrower misses out on the 50% chance Overheat has to OHKO Mega Metagross, and it cannot OHKO specially defensive Ferrothorn or Mega Mawile.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Mega Manectric to outspeed most of the unboosted Battle Spot metagame, giving as much momentum to its teammates as possible. A Timid nature is vital to let Manectric outspeed the likes of Tapu Koko and Mega Gengar. The Special Attack investment lets Mega Manectric hit as hard as possible, while the 4 Special Defense EVs ensure Porygon2 receives an Attack boost from Download. Lightning Rod is the preferred pre-Mega ability so that Manectric can easily switch into Electric-type moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Manectric likes to lead battles and immediately use Volt Switch so that you can gain the upper hand or preserve Mega Manectric's health for a Pokemon that threatens its teammates. Throughout the match, Mega Manectric is best used to weaken physical attackers and provide chip damage for its teammates. While it may be tempting to Mega Evolve immediately, keeping regular Manectric's Lightning Rod is occasionally more beneficial to discourage opposing Electric-types such as Thundurus-T and Tapu Koko from spamming STAB moves; however, not Mega Evolving can be a risky play because normal Manectric is slower and very frail.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Manectric likes having Landorus-T as a partner because it provides a double Intimidate core and is immune to Ground. Landorus-T also can provide chip damage to opponents with Stealth Rock, Rocky Helmet, and U-turn, which lets it form a VoltTurn core with Mega Manectric. Similarly, Gyarados and Celesteela are good teammates because they are immune to Ground and Lightning Rod Manectric can switch into Electric-type attacks aimed at them and get a free Special Attack boost.</p>"

  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Glalie is unlike any other Pokemon in the Battle Spot Singles metagame. Its viability solely stems from its ability Moody. Once Glalie is given a free turn or is able to outspeed the foe, it can spam Substitute and Protect until its appropriate defenses, Speed, or evasion sharply rises.</p> <p>However, Glalie's overall frailty, weaknesses to common attackers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Metagross, and lack of relevant resistances mean that it cannot be expected to see meaningful long-term success if simply tossed onto a team. Glalie is almost exclusively used to improve a dreadful matchup against defensive teams or paired with a paralysis user such as Thunder Wave Mimikyu, Thunder Wave Cresselia, or Glare Serperior that allows it to repeatedly use Substitute against a paralyzed foe until it gets fully paralyzed. Even when Glalie gets a free turn, it can be checked by opposing Ice-types, Taunt, status moves, phazing moves, attacks that go through Substitute like Hyper Voice, and attacks that ignore evasion like Sacred Sword. Despite all these weaknesses, once Glalie is allowed a free turn to use Substitute, it will likely gain the correct boosts and eventually steamroll an unprepared foe.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Glalie has minimal other options. Mega Glalie can use Explosion and trade one for one, which it usually accomplishes well because it pressures other Pokemon to stay in and break its Substitute. Whether it is worth the Mega Stone investment is a whole other question, though.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offense</strong>: Any Pokemon faster than Glalie with powerful, accurate attacks can generally beat it before it gets out of hand. The only concern is that Glalie generally comes with support, but it isn't difficult to keep your Mega Metagross or Mega Blaziken status free.</p> <p><strong>VoltTurn and Explosion</strong>: Volt Switch, U-turn, and Explosion capitalize on the fact that they deal damage and remove the current active Pokemon from the field. Glalie is only truly effective if it can be sent out with a paralyzed Pokemon in play. KOing the Thunder Wave user with these moves or giving a free switch to a faster threat that can finish them off leaves no room for Glalie to set up. Pokemon such as U-turn Scizor and Volt Switch Rotom-H could also move after Glalie, break its Substitute, and expose it to a faster threat.</p> <p><strong>Phazing Moves</strong>: Mimikyu often has the move Curse, which ignores Substitute and stops Glalie from setting up, forcing it to switch out and expose itself in a vulnerable position later in the match. Other moves such as Roar, Whirlwind, and Perish Song also accomplish the same job. However, Taunt will give these tactics trouble, except for Z-Curse Mimikyu.</p> <p><strong>Substitute-bypassing Moves</strong>: Sound-based moves and multi-hit moves can go through Substitute. Pokemon such as Primarina and Mega Kangaskhan will easily stop Glalie from setting up unless it gets lucky with Sheer Cold.</p> <p><strong>Moves that Ignore Evasion</strong>: Sacred Sword from Aegislash or Kartana, Smart Strike from Kartana and Excadrill, and various Z-Moves can be helpful against Glalie after it has already accumulated some boosts, as they ignore evasion.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Most Glalie counterplay that involves using a Pokemon slower than it can still fall prey a lucky string of Sheer Cold. However, niche Ice-types such as Dewgong and Lapras are hard counters to Glalie, as they are immune to Sheer Cold, though they will still take decent damage from boosted Earthquake. Similarly, a Glalie of your own will defeat the opposing Glalie as long as you have more PP.</p> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: While Glalie will usually aim to stay behind a Substitute, Toxic from a fast Pokemon like Greninja or Tapu Koko will put it on a timer, essentially ruining it.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Even if Glalie gets the Speed boost to Substitute + Protect in front of a faster offensive Pokemon, priority moves like Bullet Punch from Mega Metagross or Mega Scizor will stop it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>With access to Moody, Glalie becomes a serious threat with some luck, handily beating opposing Pokemon when given the correct boosts. The combination of Protect and Substitute allows Glalie to consistently fish for boosts while protecting itself from Z-Moves and status effects.</li> <li>Freeze-Dry is a more common choice that lets Glalie KO Water-types and attack with 100% accuracy. It is the preferred attacking move on Glalie for its higher PP, perfect accuracy, and its ability to hit Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Greninja super effectively.</li> <li>Frost Breath can land a guaranteed critical hit, ignoring any reduction to Glalie's Special Attack. However, it has less PP and is generally less consistent due to its imperfect accuracy, a problem potentially compounded by potential accuracy drops.</li> <li>Sheer Cold allows Glalie to OHKO the bulky Pokemon it sets up on regardless of their defensive stats or resistance to Ice. However, it leaves Glalie open to Ice-types that are immune to the move.</li> <li>Earthquake is an option that hits opposing Ice-types, as well as Steel-types such as Heatran and Mega Metagross, for decent damage once boosted.</li> <li>Taunt, on the other hand, stops most counterplay to Glalie such as Curse, Roar, and opposing Taunt.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>The given EV spread spread allows Glalie to be as fast as possible while maximizing its special bulk.</li> <li>The HP investment lets Glalie heal as much as possible with Leftovers.</li> <li>Moody is absolutely necessary for Glalie to function.</li> <li>Leftovers is the best recovery item for Glalie, since Substitute, Protect, and Moody take up a lot of turns to get going.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Glalie should ideally be picked against slow, defensive teams. Certain Pokemon such as Porygon2 will struggle to break its Substitute.</li> <li>Lead with paralysis users, which are perfect support for Glalie. Not only does this enable Glalie to outspeed offensive Pokemon and use Substitute and Protect, but the eventual full paralysis can also earn it a free Substitute.</li> <li>Repeatedly using Substitute and Protect may enable a faster attacker such as Metagross to switch in freely on the Protect as long as Glalie does not get a lucky Speed boost. Thus, it may be worth it to mix up the moves in order to deny free switches on Protect.</li> <li>Moody boosts Glalie's stats at the end of every turn. Thus, double switching to a defensive Pokemon can let Glalie fish for multiple Moody boosts for better odds.</li> <li>In a pinch, Glalie can tank weaker neutral attacks and set up a Substitute, starting its Substitute + Protect cycle without support. However, it will have much less chances to get going before it does not have enough HP to set up a Substitute.</li> <li>As a matchup-heavy Pokemon, it is helpful to leave Glalie on the bench against well-prepared teams.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Serperior and Mimikyu are classic support options for Glalie for their ability to reliably spread paralysis.</li> <li>Cresselia can support Glalie and other attackers such as Mega Kangaskhan, with Lunar Dance allowing Glalie to get a free switch.</li> <li>Fling + Light Ball on Pokemon such as Garchomp or Pheromosa can be highly unexpected, catching your opponent off guard.</li> <li>Use Glalie on teams that struggle with breaking switch-heavy teams.</li> <li>It is important to have a more reliable primary mode in case Glalie is better left on the bench.</li> </ul>"

Mega Salamence also has the access to support moves like Dragon Dance and Roost.</li> <li>It has excellent stats overall, boasting a huge Attack stat, a great Speed tier, and an impressive physical bulk also thanks to its non-Mega ability Intimidate.</li> <li>The 4x Ice weakness makes Mega Salamence heavily threatened by offensive Pokemon like Mamoswine or Ice Beam users such as Porygon2.</li> <li>Teams are usually well prepared for it, being one of the most popular Mega Evolutions.</li> </ul>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>A SubToxic set can be an option to deal with tanks that Salamence can't threaten such as Porygon2 and Cresselia.</li> <li>Facade could be used to absorb burns or status moves in general.</li> <li>Hydro Pump on the mixed set can be used to deal damage to Fire-types such as Heatran and to have a chance to OHKO Alolan Marowak.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Ice Users</strong>: Pokemon such as Cresselia, Porygon2, and Suicune can all take attacks from Mega Salamence and are able to fire back with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ice-type Move Users</strong>: Pheromosa is faster than Mega Salamence and can hit it very hard with Ice Beam, most likely OHKOing it. Mamoswine can threaten it with Ice Shard and likes to run Focus Sash or Choice Scarf to be able to hit it even with Icicle Spear. Alolan Ninetales would outspeed an Adamant or Rash Mega Salamence, OHKOing it with Blizzard, and it would threaten a Jolly or a Naive one as well if it is equipped with a Focus Sash. Even Blaziken's mixed set can deal huge damage with Hidden Powe Ice. However none of these Pokemon can really switch into Mega Salamence's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster or Bulky Fairy-types</strong>: Offensive variants of Tapu Koko have good chances to OHKO Mega Salamence with Dazzling Gleam, while Tapu Fini is bulky enough to survive its attack and answer with Moonblast or even with an Ice Beam. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele is a very popular set and OHKOes Salamence with Moonblast, and it can 2HKO Mega Salamence if it switches into a Psychic. Unware Clefable can ignore Dragon Dance, while Mimikyu has its ability Disguise that guards it from the first attack, firing back with a STAB Play Rough.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel- and Rock-types</strong>: Aegislash and Rhyperior can tank Salamence's Earthquake. Salamence needs to be at +2 to OHKO Aegislash and fails to OHKO Rhyperior even at +2 while being hit hard by both in return.</p> <p><strong>Faster or Bulky Dragon-types</strong>: Both of Garchomp's main sets, Choice Scarf with its fast Outrage and Focus Sash with the combination of Rock Tomb and Outrage, can threaten Mega Salamence. Dragonite can't be OHKOed by any of Mega Salamence's attacks thanks to Multiscale and can set up with Dragon Dance or attack with Outrage. Mega Charizard X could be a problem as well if it manages to get Dragon Dance boosts before Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Flying- / Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Thundurus are both able to deal with Mega Salamence's Dragon Dance set, specially if running bulky spreads, being resistant to its STAB moves and immune to Earthquake. Even Rotom-W and Rotom-H can deal with Mega Salamence for the same reason, as well as being able to burn it with Will-O-Wisp. If running a mixed set, Draco Meteor would deal good damage to them but wouldn't be enough to OHKO either of them.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Dragon Dance is Mega Salamence's setup move, boosting its already great Attack and Speed to sky-high levels and outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame at +1.</li> <li>Double-Edge when combined with Aerilate has an impressive 144 Base Power, hitting everything that doesn't resist it hard. Return has no recoil but has a lower 122 Base Power; it still hits hard, but it usually requires an Adamant nature to be viable. Facade is an option to better take on Pokemon with status moves while boosting.</li> <li>Earthquake grants coverage for Steel- (barring Celesteela), Eletric-, and Rock-types, OHKOing threats such as Tapu Koko even without a Dragon Dance boost.</li> <li>Roost gives Salamence the ability to set up in front of defensive Pokemon such as bulky Celesteela. When used, it also mitigates Mega Salamence's Ice-type weakness to 2x.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Running a 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread is usually the best option so Mega Salamence can hit as hard and fast as possible.</li> <li>An Adamant nature guarantees more damage and makes Return a viable choice while still allowing Mega Salamence to outspeed Pokemon such as Garchomp and Nihilego.</li> <li>Running a Jolly nature could be worth it in order to outspeed threats such as Alolan Ninetales, Mega Metagross, and Mega Lucario before a boost, but Salamence would usually need to run Double-Edge as a STAB move to make up for the power loss.</li> <li>A spread of 140 HP / 108 Atk / 8 SpD / 252 Spe can be used in order to always survive a Timid Tapu Koko's Life Orb-boosted Dazzling Gleam or Modest Tapu Lele's Moonblast while still being faster than Garchomp and Nihilego if running an Adamant nature; otherwise, you could take advantage of its fantastic Speed tier if running a Jolly nature. That set would usually need to run Double-Edge as its main STAB move.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Dragon Dance should be used mid- or late-game when Mega Salamence's checks are KOed or in range of a hit from +1 Salamence.</li> <li>Keep in mind that Mega Salamence still does a lot of damage without a boost, so when predicting a switch, an option could be to just attack rather than being forced to switch out with a boost and nothing done.</li> <li>Mega Salamence doesn't need to Mega Evolve immediately to take advantage of its non-Mega ability Intimidate. For example, this enables Salamence to more easily switch in and out while being able to Mega Evolve when it needs its Speed.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Steel-type checks are required, particurarly Pokemon that can handle Celesteela, which is immune to Earthquake and can tank Salamence's STAB moves fairly well. Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Alolan Marowak make good partners, even mitigating Mega Salamence's Ice weakness. Volcarona deserves a special mention as a Fire-type that can deal with Cresselia too. Buzzwole can deal with Cresselia as well.</li> <li>Fairy-types have always been good partners for Dragon-types. Tapu Fini covers Salamence's weakness very well and can clear Porygon2 from the field with the combination of Nature's Madness and Hydro Vortex, whereas Tapu Koko is a decent Celesteela check. Tapu Bulu is probably worse than Tapu Fini and Tapu Koko when paired with Salamence, but it can offer a better answer to those Garchomp that are not running Poison Jab and deal huge damage to Porygon2 if equipped with Choice Band or Grassium Z. Primarina can work instead of Tapu Fini, also checking Pokemon that like to use Substitute, such as Celesteela, thanks to its Sparkling Aria. Alolan Ninetales deserves a special mention, not only mitigating Salamence's Ice and Dragon weaknesses but also being able to set up Aurora Veil that hugely aids in setting up Dragon Dance and providing chip damage with hail to aid sweeps.</li> <li>Bulky Water-types could also work fine if paired with Mega Salamence, guarding it from its 4x Ice-type weakness and threatening checks such as Mamoswine. Tapu Fini and Primarina are both good choices. Slowbro can come in on Ice attacks and easily check threats like Garchomp, Rhyperior, and Mamoswine; even Suicune can be a great partner, since it is resistant to Ice, can deal with Ground-types, and thanks to its bulk and access to Ice Beam, can even offer a decent answer to opposing Dragon-types.</li> <li>Steel-types are also great partners for Salamence, both defensively and offensively. Aegislash and Celesteela are both good options. Ferrothorn and Heatran have both always been very solid choices for Mega Salamence cores. Magnezone can fulfill this role as well, being also able to trap opposing Celesteela thanks to Magnet Pull.</li> <li>Mamoswine offers a good answer to opposing Dragon-types while working as a check to Porygon2, being able to fire off several Fissures if running its Assault Vest set.</li> <li>Stealth Rock support could be a good idea to break Focus Sashes on foes. Mamoswine and Nihilego are good candidates for this role. Hippowdon and Tyranitar are two other great Stealth Rock setters, since Mega Salamence fits really well on sand teams; Excadrill can complete sand cores and offer Stealth Rock support as well. Ferrothorn deserves a special mention, since it can set up Stealth Rock while also doing pretty well against Water-types.</li> </ul>"

With a Rash nature, Flamethrower will be enough to always OHKO Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Earthquake completes the offensive coverage, hitting Electric-, Rock-, and Fire-types for super effective damage; Hyper Voice is a STAB option that hits fairly well while also giving Mega Salamence the ability to hit through Substitutes. Running Substitute itself is an option to answer to Celesteela's Leech Seed, to absorb status, and to scout for an Ice attack, while Roost sacrifices coverage for more staying power.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Maximizing Mega Salamence's Special Attack and Speed is the best idea so it can have the best possible offensive presence.</li> <li>Its nature should be either Naive or Rash, lowering Mega Salamence's average Special Defense to take the advantage of its fantastic Defense with Intimidate.

Offensive sets of Tapu Fini can KO Porygon2 with the combination of Nature's Madness and Hydro Vortex. Aegislash can take care of Porygon2 with a SubToxic set and can deal with Cresselia too. Mamoswine and Buzzwole can threaten Porygon2 when using an Assault Vest set, with Mamoswine also checking Dragon-types and Buzzwole also checking Steel-types. Even Tapu Koko can handle weakened Porygon2 if equipped with an Electrium Z while also easily dealing with Suicune.</li> </ul>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Due to its compact movepool, Hippowdon rarely deviates from its top moves due to its lack of effective alternatives and its lack of need for them. If anything, Hippowdon's versatility mainly comes from its EV spreads and its flexible move choice from both sets to suit its needs.</li> <li>Thus, it is important to note that Hippowdon can rarely afford a moveslot for other options.</li> <li>Rock Tomb can be used for the rare occasion that Hippowdon needs to hit Charizard and Gyarados and to slow down the foe as well.</li> <li>Toxic can be effective to rack up passive damage. However, it has adverse synergy with Yawn and is ineffective against popular switch-ins such as Tapu Fini and Gliscor.</li> <li>Protect can safely put the opponent to sleep in combination with Yawn.

Greninja in particular threatens a quick OHKO with Hydro Vortex or Life Orb Protean Grass Knot, while Tapu Fini nullifies its Yawn and Gyarados can use Taunt on Hippowdon and proceed to set up on it. Slowbro also has Regenerator to nullify any progress Stealth Rock and Yawn can make.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Moves</strong>: As mentioned, Hippowdon needs to be threatened by a 2HKO to stop it from making your team fall asleep. Pokemon such as Kartana, Breloom, Serperior, and Mega Venusaur will outspeed Hippowdon and threaten it with a 2HKO. Breloom can also safely use Spore on it or the switch-ins as Hippowdon switches out. Grass Knot from likes of Tapu Koko, Thundurus, and Mega Metagross, while rare, will also generally 2HKO Hippowdon unless it is specially defensive with Sitrus Berry.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Ice-type moves coming from Greninja and Download Porygon2 are also effective ways to take down Hippowdon before it starts becoming a nuisance. However, physical non-STAB Ice-type moves such as Ice Punch from Mega Metagross will not do enough damage against physically defensive Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Naganadel, Tapu Lele, and Mega Charizard Y threaten a lot of damage even to specially defensive Hippowdon. After some chip damage, these attackers can threaten an OHKO on Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Absorbers</strong>: Tapu Koko's and Tapu Fini's terrains are effective tools to combat Hippowdon's Yawn, though Tapu Koko must be afraid of switching into its Earthquake and will generally switch out immediately unless it has Reflect or Shuca Berry and Grass Knot. Pokemon such as Gliscor can also switch into Yawn with impunity and activate its Toxic Orb. Chansey can also chip down Hippowdon and wake up from Yawn thanks to Natural Cure. Substitute users like Porygon2 and Greninja can also put a damper on Hippowdon's Yawn antics. Finally, Lum Berry, while rare, allows sweepers to set up in front of Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Hippowdon struggles to do much once afflicted with Taunt by likes of Gyarados, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini. However, very few Taunt users can afford to take multiple Earthquakes from Hippowdon. Gyarados, Serperior, and Thundurus-T stand out as strong Taunt users that resist or are immune to Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from likes of Toxic seriously dampen physically defensive Hippowdon's ability to last the whole game to check physical sweepers. On the other hand, if Hippowdon is afflicted with Leech Seed, its main strategy of repeatedly using Yawn is neutered, as it is unable to spread meaningful chip damage due to Leech Seed recovery and loses valuable HP, preventing it from continuing to use Yawn.</p>",

  "Gliscor": {
    "overview": "<p>Gliscor holds an excellent niche in Battle Spot Singles as both a stall Pokemon and stallbreaker, often being used for both roles at at the same time. The combination of Poison Heal and its decent Speed tier makes it very difficult to break through Gliscor once it sets up a Substitute, allowing it to effectively shut down offensive and defensive foes alike with Guillotine or Toxic. Gliscor's Ground/Flying typing also grants it very useful immunities to Electric- and Ground-type moves, as well as a Fighting-type resistance, at the cost of two common weaknesses to Water- and Ice-type moves. Access to Roost also gives Gliscor more flexibility and consistency in its defensive roles, allowing it to focus more heavily on stalling foes if necessary. Gliscor still struggles against strong Ice-type moves and is completely shut down by sound-based moves and multi-hit moves such as Icicle Spear and Bullet Seed, but if the foe lacks these things, Gliscor can easily wall an entire team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Due to its high base Speed for a defensive Pokemon, Gliscor can make effective use of Taunt to hone in on the stallbreaking role and completely shut down defensive foes or prevent setup sweepers from setting up on it. However, this usually means giving up Protect, which makes it more difficult to deal with more immediately powerful wallbreakers.</li> <li>Gliscor can fill the role of the Stealth Rock user if the team has nowhere else to fit it, though it has difficulty making room for this on most teams. This is best used on Focus Sash sets with Taunt in order to anti-lead opposing Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Hippowdon. Hyper Cutter is used in these cases, since the Intimidate immunity is still consistently useful.</li> <li>Ice Fang is useful for dealing with Flying-types such as Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, though it's often difficult to justify dropping another move for it. It also mandates an Adamant nature with 148 Atk EVs in order to consistently break bulky Mega Salamence's Substitute, which can be too much investment for some teams to afford.</li> <li>A Swords Dance set is an unconventional way to wallbreak with Gliscor, since it doesn't fear status moves, making it harder to use Gliscor as setup bait. This is often paired with Baton Pass to set up an unexpected sweep for a teammate, though this is a very specific niche and most teams are better off with a usual Gliscor set, a stronger Baton Pass user such as Blaziken, or another Ground-type wallbreaker.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Any Pokemon with a powerful Ice-type move will typically make short work of Gliscor. Mamoswine in particular forces Gliscor out every time, since it will break through Gliscor's Substitute with Icicle Spear, though other common users of Ice-type moves such as Porygon2, Greninja, Mega Gengar, Thundurus-T, and Mega Metagross can easily force it out if it's not safely behind a Substitute. Hidden Power Ice users tend to be less effective against specially defensive Gliscor, though, since it can usually cycle with Protect and switching to keep itself healthy.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Moves</strong>: Gliscor is punished heavily by multi-hit moves, since it doesn't resist any of the common ones and is weak to Icicle Spear and Water Shuriken. In addition to the aforementioned Mamoswine and Greninja, Gliscor struggles with most users of multi-hit moves such as Breloom, Mega Heracross, Ferrothorn, and Cloyster.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers that can immediately outspeed and overpower Gliscor are problematic, since Gliscor doesn't have many resistances. Choice Specs Tapu Lele, Mega Gyarados, Mega Salamence, and Mega Charizard Y are all very dangerous wallbreakers that can break through even specially defensive sets due to Gliscor's lack of resistances, provided Gliscor doesn't get an opportunity to hide behind a Substitute beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Sound Moves</strong>: Users of sound-based moves such as Kommo-o, Mega Salamence, Mega Gardevoir, and Primarina can make quick work of Gliscor as long as they avoid Guillotine, with the latter's Sparkling Aria notably being super effective against Gliscor. It's important to note that Kommo-o's Clangorous Soulblaze also goes through Gliscor's Substitute, but Primarina's Oceanic Operetta does not.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory</strong>: Skarmory is the only relevant Sturdy Pokemon in the metagame that is immune to Toxic, Guillotine, and Earthquake, which means it puts a complete stop to Gliscor in combination with Taunt. While Skarmory can't do much back in most scenarios beyond Taunting it, this alone will often force Gliscor out, which can help regain a lot of leverage against it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Gliscor's primary means of dealing damage, hitting decently hard even with minimal Attack investment. Roost allows Gliscor to heal off a huge amount of damage in combination with Poison Heal, making it very resilient. Protect allows Gliscor to stall out a turn for Poison Heal and extra Toxic damage while avoiding taking an extra hit. However, Rock Tomb can provide useful speed control so that Gliscor can use Roost first against faster foes, and it also lets Gliscor threaten Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y without relying on Guillotine. Running Guillotine allows Gliscor to break through passive foes that are immune to Toxic or fish for an immediate OHKO and is typically the ideal stallbreaking tool despite its low PP and accuracy. Toxic can be used instead of Guillotine, though, if the consistency is desired and Toxic support cannot be fit elsewhere on the team. Running both moves is also an option but it comes at the cost of Protect or Rock Tomb, which can be risky without proper support.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread optimizes Poison Heal recovery while giving Gliscor the maximum possible special bulk with a Careful nature, with the leftover EVs being placed into Attack to give Earthquake some extra power, which is useful for securing KOs against threats such as Mega Gengar and Tapu Koko. In particular, this specially defensive spread allows Gliscor to take on powerful special attackers such as Volcarona, Mega Gengar, and Firium Z Rotom-H as well as weaker Hidden Power Ice users such as Tapu Koko. The Attack EVs can also be placed in Speed, though this is less useful if Rock Tomb isn't being used, since Gliscor doesn't outspeed many relevant threats with those Speed EVs. Toxic Orb is necessary in order to activate Poison Heal consistently, which is a crucial part of how Gliscor functions.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gliscor relies heavily on Poison Heal, so making sure it can get Toxic Orb to activate safely is crucial. Leading with Gliscor or sending it in against a foe that can't threaten it is ideal for this, especially since this can give Gliscor a free turn to use Guillotine against a potential switch-in. Even with heavy defensive investment Gliscor can be worn down quickly due to its short list of resistances, so playing defensively and using Roost to stay healthy should always be a priority. However, Gliscor also doesn't want to stay in against powerful wallbreakers that haven't been hit with Toxic since this can force it into a stalemate with Roost, so be proactive with switching it out against strong wallbreakers and only bringing it in against foes it can easily take advantage of, such as Landorus-T or Heatran. Likewise, Guillotine is primarily meant to break through passive foes more quickly rather than snag a surprise kill, so avoid fishing for a lucky hit against a powerful foe unless you have no other choice.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gliscor wants teammates such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini, which can comfortably deal with Ice- and Water-type attacks, though note that the latter's Misty Terrain can clash with Gliscor if it's running Toxic. Toxapex in particular is a popular teammate that also appreciates Gliscor's Electric- and Ground-type immunities and can reliably keep up switching in longer battles due to Regenerator. These two are often paired with Mega Metagross on bulky offense teams due to the excellent defensive backbone this trio forms without becoming too passive. Gliscor can just as easily be used on stall teams with the likes of Chansey and Skarmory as well, though this specially defensive set is most commonly used on bulky offense teams. Bulky Normal-types such as Porygon2 and Snorlax also appreciate Gliscor's Fighting-type resistance and can also shrug off most common Water- and Ice-type moves due to their high Special Defense.</p>"
      },
      "Fast Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is a powerful STAB move even without investment, allowing Gliscor to chunk away at foes without relying on stalling the foe. Substitute makes Gliscor very annoying to deal with for teams that lack a proper countermeasure, since the combination of Substitute, Protect, and Poison Heal allow it to reliably stall out any foe it can hit with Toxic. Protect also generally allows Gliscor to safely stall out a turn for recovery or Toxic damage, though powerful setup sweepers can take advantage of predictable Protects. Guillotine allows Gliscor to try to instantly remove a passive foe that can't reliably break its Substitute and punish switches to an otherwise reliable check. It can also be used to try and fish for a surprise KO against a dangerous foe if Gliscor is safely behind a Substitute. Toxic is a lower-risk alternative to Guillotine that allows Gliscor to stall foes more self-sufficiently, though this comes at the cost of being walled by defensive foes that are immune to Toxic such as Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela, which makes it harder to stallbreak.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Jolly nature makes Gliscor as fast as possible, allowing it to Substitute stall as many foes as possible while also optimizing Poison Heal recovery. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to give Gliscor some extra bulk against a stray Hidden Power Ice, though these EVs can also be placed elsewhere if extra power, physical bulk, or speed is desired. Toxic Orb and Poison Heal are also necessary, as Gliscor needs these in order to effectively stall out foes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Gliscor is often used on stall teams in order to stallbreak other annoying passive threats, such as Celesteela and Mega Venusaur. This means Gliscor will ideally be brought against other slow and passive teams in order to take advantage of its Speed to Substitute stall or fish for Guillotine hits. If a team is filled with many powerful wallbreakers or Pokemon that can bypass Substitute via multi-hit or sound moves, Gliscor is typically best left on the bench. However, Gliscor can still be effective against more offensive teams if you can bring it in against a passive foe or something that it forces out, such as Landorus-T or Hippowdon. If Gliscor can get a free turn to use Substitute, faster foes can also struggle to break Gliscor as it tries to land a Toxic or Guillotine and stall out on appropriate turns. Keep in mind that this Gliscor set is not very bulky overall, so being proactive with Protect and Substitute is important. If Gliscor can't safely heal enough damage in between Substitute turns and attempting to break through a foe, try to find an opportunity to safely switch out with enough HP in case it needs to come back in later.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxapex is a primary consideration for Gliscor's teammates, since the two of them can comfortably switch into most of each other's weaknesses, though other bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini are similarly effective for this role. Normal-types such as Snorlax, Chansey, and Porygon2 also benefit from having a teammate that can safely switch into Fighting-type attacks and are bulky enough to handle Water- and Ice-type attacks aimed at Gliscor. Steel-types such as Mega Metagross and Skarmory also handle Ice-type moves aimed at Gliscor and pair well with the aforementioned Water-type as well. This Gliscor set fits particularly well on stall teams that may be lacking in tools to break through opposing stall teams or similarly bulky teams, which may be forced to risk losing something to Guillotine if they're too passive. However, this Gliscor can still function outside of stall teams as long as it has bulky teammates to fall back on to make up for the lack of bulk on this set.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Both Life Orb and Choice Band bolster Mamoswine's power, aiding it in securing an OHKO with Earthquake versus Aegislash and making it much harder to switch into.</li> <li>Lum Berry is especially useful when dealing with Ghost-types, protecting Mamoswine from being burned by the likes of Mega Gengar and Mimikyu.</li> <li>A physically defensive set can be run with Rocky Helmet in order to discourage contact attackers such as Mega Salamence and Mega Kangaskhan, which dislike taking recoil damage.</li> <li>Freeze-Dry is 4x super effective against Gyarados and Pelipper, allowing Mamoswine to catch them both off guard on a predicted switch in, but it should never be used directly against either since Mamoswine is threatened by their Water-type STAB moves and Gyarados is able to reduce the amount of damage taken by Mega Evolving. Additionally, Freeze-Dry lacks the power of Mamoswine's other moves, making it a rather ineffective lure if not paired with a damage-boosting item like Life Orb.</li> <li>Groundium Z can turn Fissure or Earthquake into a 180-Base Power physical nuke capable of inflicting serious damage against unsuspecting foes and safely eliminating Porygon2 once it's fallen under 50% HP.</li> <li>Toxic possesses some merit as a safer alternative to wear down Porygon2.</li> <li>Choice Scarf coupled with a Jolly nature allows Mamoswine to outspeed typically faster Pokemon such as Mega Gengar and Tapu Koko, allowing it to KO them with an Earthquake before they can attack.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Floating Pokemon</strong>: Anything that is immune to Earthquake and isn't weak to Ice-type attacks will usually wall Mamoswine. Commone examples include Celesteela, Cresselia, Rotom-W, Skarmory, and Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Tapu Fini can come in on Mamoswine and threaten it with a powerful Hydro Vortex as well as take an Earthquake regardless of its defensive investment, allowing it to take out Mamoswine even if it's holding a Focus Sash. Similarly, Pelipper can switch into Mamoswine and take out offensive variants with a single rain-boosted Scald, and defensive Gyarados can also cause Mamoswine problems by being able to easily sponge attacks with its Intimidate ability and deal massive damage in return with a STAB Waterfall. Both make such excellent answers for their immunity to Ground-type moves, guaranteeing their safety won't be compromised by a timely Fissure. While not strictly a bulky Water-type, Cloyster's natural physical bulk and secondary Ice typing mean that Mamoswine can't pick it off with a combination of Earthquake and Ice Shard from high HP, allowing it to Shell Smash against it without fear and OHKO Mamoswine with a +2 Icicle Spear.</p> <p><strong>Buzzwole</strong>: Buzzwole resists Earthquake and shrugs off Mamoswine's Ice-type attacks only to bring Mamoswine down to its Focus Sash or possibly KO it with a STAB Superpower. However, since Buzzwole is grounded, it must be wary of a potential Fissure.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Steel-types</strong>: Mamoswine fears Kartana like the plague. It's able to KO Mamoswine with either of its STAB moves and its Steel typing decreases its susceptibility to Ice Shard; however, it dislikes taking an Earthquake. Mega Metagross and Mega Lucario are also able to outright KO Mamoswine once its Focus Sash has been broken, but neither should switch directly into it for fear of being hit by a super effective Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor</strong>: Mega Scizor deserves a special mention; unlike other Steel-types, it's able to use Mamoswine as setup fodder, safely setting up a Swords Dance before plowing through the rest of Mamoswine's team.</p> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur</strong>: Thanks to its own Thick Fat, Mega Venusaur can take on anything Mamoswine dishes out except for Fissure, and threaten massive damage with Giga Drain.</p>",

  "Ferrothorn": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn is one of the most effective Stealth Rock users in the Battle Spot Singles metagame, fitting well onto many teams due to its fantastic defensive typing. Ferrothorn's great bulk in conjunction with its numerous resistances allows it to check a wide range of threats such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Mimikyu, Garchomp, Mega Metagross, and Mega Kangaskhan. Its Iron Barbs ability, Stealth Rock, and Leech Seed combined allow it to effectively wear down teams and function as strong support. Powerful STAB moves and decent Attack make Ferrothorn less passive than most defensive Pokemon and allow it to function as an effective Choice Band user. However, Ferrothorn suffers from weaknesses to common Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, and with its low Speed, this makes it very susceptible to unexpected coverage moves such as Hidden Power Fire.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <ul> <li>Toxic gives Ferrothorn a more reliable option than Leech Seed for breaking down bulky foes such as Porygon2, though this is better left to one of Ferrothorn's teammates.</li> <li>Thunder Wave can punish fast foes that might otherwise set up relatively safely against Ferrothorn, though it has poor synergy with Gyro Ball and Ferrothorn has difficulty giving up a moveslot for it.</li> <li>Explosion can be used on the Choice Band set as a last-resort option, though it's difficult to fit onto such a slow Choice Band user.</li> <li>Payback is a more consistently powerful alternative to Knock Off on the Choice Band set that reliably 2HKOes Mega Metagross, though the utility of removing an item usually makes Knock Off the preferred choice.</li> <li>Curse gives Ferrothorn a way to increase its offensive presence while boosting its Defense further, though it's difficult to fit into a set and it doesn't help Ferrothorn against Fire-types.</li> <li>A Sitrus Berry or Figy Berry can be used to give Ferrothorn more immediate recovery than Leftovers, though Ferrothorn is bulky enough to take better advantage of Leftovers.</li> </ul> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Moves</strong>: Fire-types such as Blaziken, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran all easily OHKO Ferrothorn with their respective Fire-type moves and don't take much from either of its STAB moves. Ferrothorn's huge Fire-type weakness also leaves it vulnerable to common Fire-type coverage users such as Hidden Power Fire Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Greninja, Fire Fang Garchomp, and Fire Punch Mega Kangaskhan. Physical attackers should still be mindful of Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet recoil, though, especially in combination with Flare Blitz recoil.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mega Lucario, Mega Lopunny, Mega Heracross, and Pheromosa can all threaten Ferrothorn with their respective Fighting-type STAB moves. Mega Lucario and Mega Heracross in particular threaten to set up with Swords Dance, since they don't mind Gyro Ball. However, Mega Lopunny and Pheromosa rely on High Jump Kick to beat Ferrothorn, so they must be wary of Protect.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Ferrothorn has trouble breaking through physically bulky Pokemon that can't easily be worn down through Leech Seed such as Mega Mawile, Celesteela, and Kartana. While Celesteela doesn't like taking a Leech Seed, it often runs Flamethrower or Substitute to beat Ferrothorn. Meanwhile, Kartana and Mega Mawile can threaten to set up with Swords Dance and break through with Sacred Sword and Knock Off, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types</strong>: Bulky Electric-types such as Zapdos, bulky Thundurus-T, Magnezone, and Rotom-H all take very little from Ferrothorn's STAB moves, and they often run coverage for Ferrothorn such as Heat Wave or Focus Blast. Magnezone in particular can potentially trap Ferrothorn and remove it with Hidden Power Fire, and it only fears the uncommon Bulldoze from Choice Band variants.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Gyro Ball is Ferrothorn's strongest STAB move, hitting most offensive threats at maximum power due to Ferrothorn's low Speed.</li> <li>Stealth Rock offers team support in the form of residual damage that breaks Focus Sash and Sturdy while also pressuring Fire-types that threaten Ferrothorn such as Charizard and Volcarona.</li> <li>Leech Seed grants Ferrothorn extra recovery and another way to wear down foes. This also helps it threaten bulky foes it otherwise can't touch such as Porygon2 and Celesteela.</li> <li>Protect allows Ferrothorn to take full advantage of Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery to stay healthy while also allowing it to scout for potential Z-Moves.</li> <li>Power Whip increases Ferrothorn's offensive presence by being a secondary STAB option that hits most Water- and Ground-types harder than Gyro Ball. It can also be used over Stealth Rock to retain the utility that Protect provides.</li> <li>Bullet Seed gives Ferrothorn a better matchup against Mimikyu and provides a more accurate Grass-type STAB attack than Power Whip, though its damage output is less consistent than Power Whip's.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Leftovers gives Ferrothorn a steady source of recovery, allowing it to reliably stall out foes with Leech Seed and Protect.</li> <li>Figy Berry is an option for quick HP gain, especially if it does not elect to use Protect for the reliable Leftovers recovery.</li> <li>Iron Barbs allows Ferrothorn to punish physical attackers that make contact, slowly wearing them down for its team. Rocky Helmet can be used instead of Leftovers to augment this residual damage at the cost of reliable recovery.</li> <li>A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs maximizes Ferrothorn's physical bulk while making it as slow as possible to ensure Gyro Ball is hitting at maximum power most of the time.</li> <li>The EV spread makes Ferrothorn as physically bulky as possible, with the remaining EVs placed in Attack. Ferrothorn can be more specially defensive with a Sassy nature if checking the likes of Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele is more important than taking physical attacks.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Ferrothorn should prioritize setting Stealth Rock up as soon as possible, since its fantastic bulk and typing allow it to safely set up against anything that lacks a Fire- or Fighting-type move.</li> <li>Ferrothorn often forces switches due to its great defensive typing, so using Leech Seed in anticipation of a switch is often a safe play.</li> <li>While Stealth Rock punishes most Fire-types, Ferrothorn's presence often invites Fire-types to switch in immediately, so avoid setting Stealth Rock too soon if you have nothing that can afford to switch into a Fire-type attack afterwards.</li> <li>Despite being able to disrupt many Pokemon with its Leech Seed and powerful STAB moves, Ferrothorn should not be relied upon to break through very bulky foes, as it lacks the offensive presence to overpower them.</li> <li>Many Pokemon that Ferrothorn typically checks often run coverage specifically for it, such as Fire Punch Mega Kangaskhan and Hidden Power Fire Tapu Koko, so be wary of any such potential lures when against teams that otherwise look weak to Ferrothorn.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>Setup sweepers such as Mega Blaziken, Mega Salamence, and Mega Charizard X benefit greatly from Stealth Rock support wearing down the opposing team and breaking Focus Sash.</li> <li>Flying-types such as Zapdos and the aforementioned Mega Salamence appreciate Ferrothorn's ability to switch into Rock- and Ice-type moves, and in return, they're able to switch into Fighting-type moves that threaten Ferrothorn. They also ease Ferrothorn's matchup against Ground-types that might overpower it otherwise such as Garchomp and Landorus-T.</li> <li>Water-types such as Gyarados and Tapu Fini deal with Fire-types that threaten Ferrothorn, while Ferrothorn can handle Electric- and Grass-type moves in return. Pelipper or Politoed can also provide rain support to let Ferrothorn take weaker Fire-type attacks.</li> <li>Tyranitar benefits from Ferrothorn's resistances to Fairy, Water, Grass, and Steel while faring better against Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y than Water-types. Sandstorm damage also helps Ferrothorn wear down the opposing team.</li> <li>Ferrothorn struggles with bulky Electric-types such as Zapdos and some Thundurus-T variants, so it appreciates teammates that can handle them such as Landorus-T, Mamoswine, and Toxic Zapdos.</li> <li>Ferrothorn's great defensive typing allows it to fit well as glue on many teams, as it doesn't require much support to fill its role beyond having a teammate that can handle Fire-type moves.</li> </ul>"

      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <ul> <li>Curse provides a way for Ferrothorn to boost its offensive capabilities and actually beat bulky Pokemon with recovery, such as Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Gyro Ball is Ferrothorn's strongest STAB move, has good neutral coverage, and gets stronger with Curse.</li> <li>Bullet Seed provides a secondary STAB move that can hit Water-types super effectively, which is important because Ferrothorn is often tasked with the duty of checking threats such as Greninja and Mega Gyarados. Bullet Seed also has the utility of hitting through Substitute and Disguise.</li> <li>However, Knock Off is an option that provides better neutral coverage, in addition to hitting Steel-types like Aegislash and Mega Metagross super effectively. It also provides Ferrothorn with great utility in removing the items of its foes. Removing the Berry from Snorlax or Eviolite from Porygon2 can be devastating as usual, but removing Leftovers from Heatran or Celesteela allows Ferrothorn to limit the number of times they can switch in and defeat them in the long run.</li> <li>Leech Seed has multiple purposes on this set. In general, it is the best move to throw out on the forced switches that Ferrothorn tends to induce, as it chips down Fire-types and other Ferrothorn checks to eventually pave the way for a Curse sweep. In addition, it allows Ferrothorn to completely ignore damage from opposing physical attackers, especially after some Curse boosts.</li> </ul> <h4>Set Details</h4> <ul> <li>Figy Berry is the preferred item on Curse Ferrothorn because it allows Ferrothorn to set up against strong physical Z-Moves and super effective attacks as well as heal back up to high HP to survive subsequent attacks with the boosted Defense from Curse.</li> <li>Iron Barbs adds valuable chip damage for Ferrothorn to take on physical attackers, which usually use contact moves.</li> <li>The Defense investment allows Ferrothorn to survive a +2 Never-Ending Nightmare from Mimikyu as well as potentially take on Hammer Arm Metagross one-on-one.</li> <li>The EV spread also avoids a 3HKO from Breloom's Mach Punch and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele's Psychic.</li> <li>A more specially defensive spread such as 252 HP / 100 Def / 156 SpD with a Sassy nature is possible, as it will let Ferrothorn survive Tapu Lele's All-Out Pummeling, but it is an inferior option, as it gives Ferrothorn a harder time setting up Curse in front of physical attackers.</li> <li>Alternatively, a more physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Relaxed nature lets Ferrothorn best combat teams that stack physical attackers such as Mimikyu, Breloom, and Mega Salamence hoping to overwhelm the physically defensive wall. However, this opens up Ferrothorn to special attacks from the likes of Tapu Lele and Greninja that it should otherwise check.</li> </ul> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <ul> <li>Before blindly setting up with Curse, try to weaken and remove would-be counters with super effective Fire-type attacks.</li> <li>Pokemon like Celesteela and Heatran feel fairly comfortable switching into Ferrothorn, as they take minimal damage from any of its attacks and can threaten it out with a Fire-type move. Against such Pokemon, it is advised to slowly chip their HP away with Leech Seed and use Ferrothorn as a bulky pivot before attempting to set up with Curse. Using Curse will simply waste a turn, as Ferrothorn is forced to switch out.</li> <li>If the opponent's Ferrothorn checks are frail attackers such as mixed Mega Salamence and Mega Blaziken, throwing out Gyro Ball on the switch can put a lot of pressure on them, as they are limited in the number of times they can switch in.</li> <li>Once its counters have been removed, Ferrothorn easily finds room to set up Curse boosts thanks to its resistances to Water, Fairy, and Electric as well as its strong physical bulk, which Curse further augments.</li> <li>Even when going for a Curse sweep, look for an opportune time to use Leech Seed. The move can essentially nullify the amount of damage the foe can do to Ferrothorn with resisted special hits, as well as physical hits once Ferrothorn has some Curse boosts.</li> </ul> <h4>Team Options</h4> <ul> <li>As with most Ferrothorn sets, this one appreciates teammates that can repeatedly check opposing Fire- and Fighting-type Pokemon.</li> <li>Water- and Dragon-types such as Tapu Fini, Gyarados, and Mega Salamence are particularly good options for their resistances to both Fire- and Fighting-type attacks.</li> <li>Flying- and Fairy-type Pokemon that check Fighting-types are also appreciated. Defensive Landorus-T cannot switch into Fire-type moves particularly well, but it checks most Fighting-type attackers that lack Ice Punch.</li> <li>Pair Ferrothorn with specially defensive Pokemon such as Heatran and Porygon2, as this set lacks the special bulk and survivability to take on neutral attacks from the likes of Aegislash.</li> <li>Wallbreakers in general can wear down the opposing team with coverage moves. Once they manage to KO a threat, the opposing team has one fewer option to deal with Ferrothorn's Leech Seed. Mixed Mega Salamence is an example that has excellent type synergy with Ferrothorn with its resistance to Fire and Fighting.</li> </ul>"

Benefiting from a unique offensive typing and Quiver Dance for setup, Volcarona is a force to be reckoned with in the current metagame, capable of defeating common walls such as Cresselia and Celesteela. While its typing grants powerful STAB types, it also adds a crippling weakness to common offensive typings including Flying, Water, and a 4x weakness to Rock. While powerful initially, Volcarona does require setup to fully perform, and has a rather awkward movepool which forces it to chose what it can and can't beat with coverage options.</p> <p>Below are some sample sets. These sets are likely to be the standard, but it will be expanded upon and updated as the metagame progresses.</p>",

Flamethrower does miss out on some OHKO opportunities which Fire Blast however can have, such as Celesteela (68.8% chance to OHKO) and Mega Metagross (Guaranteed OHKO). Fiery Dance can be used over Flamethrower for an increased snowball effect.</li> <li>Bug Buzz is a STAB option which can hit through common Pokemon which take on Substitute such as Mega Gyarados and Suicune, while also providing a way of taking on Dragon-types if you use Hidden Power Ground.</li> <li>Giga Drain provides a minor form of recovery and hits both Tapu Fini and Azumarill which would otherwise wall Volcarona. Hidden Power Ground hits Heatran, Alolan-Marowak, and Blaziken which would otherwise wall Volcarona, while Hidden Power Ice hits Garchomp, Landorus, and Mega Salamence as well as Ground-types in general if you don't carry Giga Drain.</li> <li>Focus Sash ensures that Volcarona can set up at least one Quiver Dance. Lum Berry prevents Toxic from putting a timer on Volcarona and gives a free turn of setup while also preventing paralysis, which is a huge momentum drain for Volcarona. Firium Z helps break bulky Pokemon such as Porygon2, while with Buginium Z at +1, Volcarona can OHKO both Suicune and Rotom-W, which also provides utility against Dragon-types.</li> <li>The EV spread suggested is optimal for a special sweeper. Timid is suggested granting maximum Speed and the ability to outspeed Choice Scarf Tapu Lele at +1. However, Modest can be used with Flamethrower for a more accurate and still powerful STAB option, although this does make you slower than Timid Porygon-Z and Jolly Landorus-T.</li> <li>While sporting some good resistances, poor physical bulk means that Volcarona appreciates a partner which can easily sponge up hits. A weakness to Flying and Rock suggests that a check to Landorus-T, Tyranitar, and Mega Salamence is needed. Volcarona is also completely walled by Rotom-H, and needs a teammate that can deal with it. Tapu Lele can also be used as a nice partner, as Psychic Terrain makes Volcarona immune to foes carrying priority attacks such as Aqua Jet Azumarill and Quick Attack Mega Pinsir.</li> <li>Flame Body is the preferred ability due to its potential ability to punish Pokemon using contact moves; however, Swarm can be used nicely with Focus Sash, being able to OHKO Tapu Lele and Garchomp at +1 with Bug Buzz when at less than 1/3 HP.</li> </ul>"

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Unlike Thundurus-T, Thundurus can situationally utilize Prankster to anti-lead against Whimsicott and stall out defensive foes with a combination of Substitute, Toxic, and Protect. Furthermore, Thundurus boasts a base 111 Speed stat that allows it to outspeed Mega Metagross, Garchomp, and Kartana, meaning it is not obligated to use Agility to outspeed said threats, unlike Thundurus-T. However, Thundurus still suffers from its frailty and easily folds to weak super effective attacks and even strong neutral attacks. In addition, its Special Attack stat, while good and able to be boosted further with Nasty Plot, falls short of OHKOing the likes of Mega Charizard Y and Primarina without relying on prior damage or setup. If outspeeding Mega Metagross, Garchomp, and Kartana is not particularly a concern, Thundurus-T is a better alternative as an attacker.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt is an option on the SubToxic set to prevent recovery from walls, but forgoing Thunderbolt leaves Thundurus completely helpless against Celesteela, Tapu Fini, Mega Gengar, and essentially any Pokemon immune to Toxic. Life Orb trades Thundurus's longevity in exchange for the ability to achieve OHKOs on Mega Gyarados, Mega Charizard Y, and Primarina and improve its unboosted attacks. Sludge Wave allows Thundurus to OHKO Tapu Koko on the switch and dispose of Assault Vest Tapu Bulu after Stealth Rock or with a Life Orb boost, but this forces Thundurus to forgo Nasty Plot or Hidden Power Ice and either hinder its ability to break through defensive walls or significantly worsen its matchup against Ground-types. Grass Knot nails Hippowdon and Mamoswine, but the former is easily dealt by simply using Taunt, while the latter falls to Focus Blast. Psychic OHKOes Naganadel on the switch and 2HKOes Mega Venusaur and Mega Heracross, but it is generally an inferior coverage move. Thundurus can use Thunder Wave alongside Prankster as a last resort to shut down a setup sweeper, but this is difficult to pull off due to the prevalence of Tapu Lele and the fact that Thunder Wave is very hard to fit in the moveset.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Due to Thundurus's frailty, faster threats like Naganadel, Tapu Koko, Mega Gengar, and Greninja can easily KO it with their attacks. Although none of them can safely switch into Thundurus, they can KO or force it out without much trouble. Choice Scarf users with sufficient raw power such as Tapu Lele can outspeed and OHKO Thundurus.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mamoswine force Thundurus to think twice before using STAB Thunderbolt simply with their presence. Mispredicting against the former two is detrimental due to both of them being common Choice Scarf users, but they are harshly punished if carelessly switched into Hidden Power Ice. Mamoswine, in particular, doesn't mind any attack from Thundurus barring Focus Blast and the rare Grass Knot. In return, Mamoswine easily punishes SubToxic sets with Icicle Spear while at worst putting a dent on Nasty Plot variants using Ice Shard, putting Thundurus in KO range of priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tapu Bulu hopelessly shuts down any Thundurus lacking Sludge Wave and easily takes even boosted Hidden Power Ice if it is equipped with Assault Vest, although it despises getting stalled by Toxic. Ferrothorn and Venusaur don't even mind Toxic and easily take Hidden Power Ice thanks to the former's typing and the latter's ability. However, Ferrothorn is taken out by +2 Focus Blast or unboosted All-Out Pummeling.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Due to its ridiculous special bulk, Chansey barely takes any damage from unboosted attacks, only falling to +4 All-Out Pummeling. Chansey also doesn't mind Toxic due to Natural Cure removing status conditions upon switching out. However, Chansey will have a harder time against Thundurus with Nasty Plot and Taunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "SubToxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thundurus can afford to run Toxic stall set thanks to Prankster letting it put even faster foes on timer and set Substitute with priority. Substitute protects Thundurus from an attack at a cost of a quarter of its health and also blocks harmful status moves. Toxic puts passive foes like Porygon2 and Cresselia on a timer, punishing them as they switch in predicting offensive sets. Protect allows Thundurus to evade an attack for a turn and gain an extra turn of recovery from Leftovers while its foe takes another turn of damage from Toxic poison. Thunderbolt hits foes such as Celesteela and Tapu Fini that do not mind Toxic and prevents Thundurus from being completely passive.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Bold nature allows Thundurus to avoid the OHKO from +1 Double-Edge from Mega Salamence all the time and Ice Punch from Mega Metagross with considerable chance after Stealth Rock damage, survive +1 Ice Fang from Mega Gyarados and Flamethrower from Mega Charizard Y at full health, and make a Substitute that blocks Celesteela's Heavy Slam once. 124 Speed EVs let Thundurus outspeed unboosted Gyarados, preventing Dragon Dance variants from outspeeding and 2HKOing it. 132 EVs can be invested into Special Defense to prevent Celesteela's Flamethrower from breaking Substitute and lower the chance of getting 3HKOed by defensive Tapu Fini. Leftovers provide passive recovery and allows Thundurus to stall out its foe as long as possible. Prankster allows Thundurus to execute its status moves with +1 priority.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is a promising idea to send Thundurus into Pokemon it naturally threatens with Thunderbolt, such as Celesteela and Toxapex. Use Toxic on a switch-in that can take on Thundurus with ease and wear down the likes of Tapu Bulu, Landorus-T, and Cresselia. Thundurus can also be used against offensive threats such as Mega Salamence that it can survive a hit from; it also excels at Toxic stalling against these threats as thanks to Prankster allowing it to set Substitute almost always before it is attacked. Repeatedly use Substitute and Protect to wear down foes with Toxic, or use Thunderbolt for extra damage if the foe is too passive to break Substitute or threaten Thundurus in a significant way.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Note that the likes of Heatran and Ferrothorn will be very problematic to deal with, as they are immune to Toxic, resilient to Thunderbolt, and able to take advantage of Thundurus. Tyranitar causes problems in the same vein due to its immunity to Prankster moves and massive special bulk in sand, and it can even Pursuit trap Thundurus. Fighting-types like Blaziken can muscle through these walls, and Thundurus can lure and cripple Blaziken's checks with Toxic and handle Mega Salamence. In general, wallbreakers appreciate Thundurus crippling various walls like Porygon2, defensive Landorus-T, and Cresselia with Toxic and having a backup plan for Mega Salamence and Mega Gyarados, as most of them are vulnerable to said threats. Landorus-T draws in Celesteela and Tapu Fini, brings in Thundurus safely with U-turn, provides Stealth Rock support, and pressures Heatran and Excadrill. Mega Scizor is another pivot that can let Thundurus switch in safely. Mega Scizor also switches into Ice-type attacks, is a good check to most Rock-types, and takes advantage of Ferrothorn, while Thundurus can weaken various physical walls and Water-types by Toxic stalling or using Thunderbolt.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Thundurus's Special Attack by two stages and allows it to OHKO or 2HKO almost the entire metagame. STAB Thunderbolt hits Water-types and Flying-types super effectively while dishing out good damage against neutral targets. Focus Blast hits Heatran, Ferrothorn, Mamoswine, Tyranitar, Excadrill, Magnezone, Rotom-H, and Hippowdon, which are not too bothered by Thundurus's Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice. With Fightinium Z and after a Nasty Plot, all of the aforementioned foes are either OHKOed or significantly weakened. Said Z-Move also puts a heavy dent in Mega Charizard X. Hidden Power Ice hits threats like Landorus-T and Garchomp. Taunt improves Thundurus's matchup against foes that would need multiple Nasty Plot boosts to be surmounted, but bear in mind that forgoing Hidden Power Ice for Taunt makes opposing Landorus-T and Tapu Bulu very problematic to deal with.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Thundurus take advantage of its excellent Speed tier by outspeeding Mega Metagross, Kartana, and Garchomp. Electrium Z turns Thunderbolt into Gigavolt Havoc, which OHKOes Mega Metagross when unboosted and Porygon2 and Cresselia at +2. Alternatively, Fightinium Z turns Focus Blast into All-Out Pummeling, letting Thundurus hit Steel-types that would otherwise need the inaccurate Focus Blast to be defeated and putting a significant dent in most neutral targets after a Nasty Plot boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thundurus is very frail and therefore should not be switched into any attack. U-turn and Volt Switch from teammates or double switching when a foe is sure to switch out is the most ideal time for Thundurus to enter the field. Thundurus can take advantage of its typing to set up Nasty Plot against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Scizor or while forcing out Water- and Flying-types. The majority of the time, opponents will send in a Pokemon such as Heatran, Magnezone, or Mamoswine that can handle both Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Ice, as those two moves are the most expected attacks from Thundurus. All-Out Pummeling must be preserved to KO such foes so Thundurus won't fall short to KO them or have to rely on the inaccurate Focus Blast to dispose of them. Against offensive teams, Thundurus generally lacks an opportunity to set up and therefore can be used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker. If Thundurus opts to run Taunt, it can be used to anti-lead against passive walls like Hippowdon and Skarmory.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippowdon can provide Stealth Rock support and put a foe to sleep with Yawn to let Thundurus set up safely. In return, Thundurus takes on Tapu Fini and Celesteela, which prove to be annoyances for Hippowdon to deal with due to the former usually carrying Taunt and the latter running Leech Seed. Setup sweepers like Mimikyu, Blaziken, and Mega Gyarados can fit alongside Thundurus because they benefit from its ability to put a dent on bulky foes and potentially create a setup opportunity by shutting down passive foes with Taunt. When using Thundurus, it is important to ensure the team is prepared for Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, since the former can set up on Thundurus lacking All-Out Pummeling and the latter can do the same against unboosted Thundurus without much fear. Landorus-T, Tapu Fini, Tyranitar, Heatran, and Choice Scarf Garchomp can handle one or both of them.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T is a versatile threat in the Battle Spot Singles metagame capable of functioning as glue for many teams. Its Intimidate ability and huge Attack stat allow it to function as an effective pivot with a Choice Scarf, while its decent bulk allows it to fill a more defensive role as a Stealth Rock setter or Assault Vest tank. Landorus-T's typing also gives it useful immunities in Ground and Electric, which help it switch into numerous threats and take advantage of Intimidate. Said typing can be easily exploited due to its huge Ice weakness, though, and Landorus-T's average Speed leaves it easily revenge killed when without a Choice Scarf.

Assault Vest variants have a better time against special Water-types, though they still have an unfavorable matchup against most bulky ones.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Landorus-T often carries Rock Tomb or Rock Slide, but bulkier Flying-types such as Celesteela, Gliscor, Skarmory, and opposing Landorus-T don't mind a Rock Tomb and can stall it out or force it to switch out. Other Flying-types such as Salamence and Gyarados can also punish Choice Scarf variants and set up on Landorus-T if it locks into Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Ice-type moves are very common on a wide range of threats, and Landorus-T struggles to take many Ice-type attacks even with an Assault Vest. Mamoswine, Porygon2, Greninja, Zapdos, and Thundurus-T are all common users of Ice-type moves that have generally favorable matchups against Landorus-T, though the special attackers should be wary of Assault Vest variants because they can often take at least one Ice-type move.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Landorus-T has trouble breaking through most physical walls, including Celesteela, Cresselia, Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur, while they can heal off most of the damage it deals.

  "Greninja": {
    "overview": "<p>Greninja's stats may seem mediocre, but much like any accomplished ninja, it's second to none at assassination thanks to a wide variety of unique tools! The most prominent of these tools is its ability Protean, which functionally gives it STAB on every attack in the game, more than making up for its mediocre offenses. Greninja isn't limited to just type changing shenanigans, as it is also the best user of the ability Torrent in Battle Spot Singles, being able to annihilate most offensive Pokemon with a Torrent-boosted Hydro Vortex from Hydro Cannon. Combine this with Greninja's incredible Speed stat, which allows it to outspeed Naganadel and Mega Salamence, and this puts the silent assassin among the deadliest offensive threats in the metagame!</p> <p>Greninja may be a deadly offensive threat, but it has very lackluster defensive stats that make it very difficult to switch in. Even with Protean or Torrent making up for Greninja's low offensive stats, it still misses out on important KOs against Pokemon it hits for neutral damage and doesn't do particularly well against stall teams, meaning Greninja is a Pokemon that should not be used recklessly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grass Knot paired with Grassium Z can get surprise KOs on foes like Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, and Swampert. It has better accuracy than Hydro Pump and can give Greninja a useful defensive typing. However, it offers much lesser coverage than Greninja's other options. Spikes can be set up to destroy Focus Sashes, but its inability to affect Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate makes it less rewarding than using a Stealth Rock setter. Toxic Spikes is also usable, but it's generally outclassed by Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Porygon2</strong>: Porygon2 only fears a Torrent-boosted Hydro Vortex. Otherwise, its bulk is often too much for Greninja to handle, letting it punish Greninja with status or deal good damage to Greninja's soft Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Araquanid</strong>: Unless Greninja carries a Rock-type attack or Gunk Shot, it won't be doing much damage to Araquanid, whose Water-type attacks deal massive damage despite Greninja's resistance to them.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Tapu Koko is chief among Greninja's problems due to its superior speed and access to Volt Switch, although it must watch out for Choice Scarf Greninja's Gunk Shot. Choice Scarf Thundurus-T, Choice Scarf Rotom-W, and Mega Manectric are also problematic for similar reasons. Hitting Greninja's weaknesses isn't even needed most of the time due to its poor defensive stats, so most Choice Scarf Pokemon are problematic as long as Greninja does not carry a Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Mimikyu</strong>: Like many offensive Pokemon, Mimikyu will easily revenge kill Greninja as long as it has Disguise up. Even without it, a healthy Mimikyu can survive regular attacks from Greninja in most cases.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Greninja that lack Hidden Power Fire or Low Kick will have severe problems muscling past Ferrothorn. However, note that a Torrent-boosted Hydro Vortex coming from Hydro Cannon does over 50% to physically defensive Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Mega Kangaskhan</strong>: Mega Kangaskhan's good bulk and ability let it bust through Greninja fairly easily, though Low Kick and Torrent sets can still threaten to deal a lot of damage.</p> <p><strong>Breloom</strong>: While Breloom is easily KOed by Greninja, its access to Mach Punch means it can pick off Greninja early, especially before Protean kicks in.</p>",

      "Protean Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is a fantastic option on Greninja, letting it KO many prominent threats such as Landorus-T, Naganadel, Mega Salamence, and Thundurus-T. Water Shuriken is a good priority move that has the potential to do a lot of damage due to its multi-hit nature. It helps Greninja pick off weakened Blaziken, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Excadrill, and other offensive threats. Dark Pulse is the best shot Greninja has against Aegislash and Mega Metagross. It also prevents Cresselia from walling Greninja, and the flinch chance can come in handy. If Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor are serious problems, Hidden Power Fire can be used to deal with them. Hidden Power Fire is also notable for allowing a healthy Greninja to survive any attack a Focus Sash Kartana throws at it thanks to Protean.</p> <p>For the last slot, going mixed with Gunk Shot can be a good choice for OHKOing Tapu Lele, 2HKOing Tapu Fini, and blasting the less common Water / Fairy types, Azumarill and Primarina. Scald is a reliable Water-type attack, while Hydro Pump is a riskier, more powerful option that should be used with Waterium Z. Surf works as a mid-way option between the two if Scald's burn chance isn't appealing for the team. Finally, if using Focus Sash, Rock Tomb is a reasonable choice to give Greninja some speed control and a way to deal serious damage to Charizard formes and Volcarona.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>This Greninja set is extremely customizable, so using specific moves or items to cover team weaknesses is worthy of consideration. Focus Sash can have the most devastating potential consequences, making Greninja an excellent lead that can pressure common foes such as Landorus-T thanks to surviving at least one attack from them. Alternatively, Life Orb gives Greninja a significant boost in damage. For example, Dark Pulse has a 75% shot of OHKOing Mega Metagross with Stealth Rock up, Hydro Pump now 2HKOes Assault Vest Tyranitar, and Gunk Shot OHKOes offensive Tapu Fini after Stealth Rock damage. Waterium Z also works well if using Hydro Pump to give Greninja a powerful Water-type STAB attack with Hydro Vortex. If using only special attacks and a Timid nature, put the remaining 4 EVs in Special Defense to survive offensive Mega Gengar's Sludge Bomb.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Greninja is best used mid- or late-game, since missing out on a KO can lead to disaster. Since this is one of Greninja's most unpredictable sets, you can easily force out Pokemon that are weak to its common moves, such as Ice Beam, and predict the switch to gain an edge by using Greninja's less common moves such as Hidden Power Fire and Grass Knot. Greninja's knack for forcing switches also makes it a good candidate to double switch with.</p> <p>With a Focus Sash, using Greninja early in the game becomes a much more feasible task. Since Greninja excels in at forcing switches, consider predicting its switch-in and using an appropriate move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Greninja is frail, Pokemon with U-turn and Volt Switch are a great way to get it in unharmed. Landorus-T is an excellent choice with diverse options, being able to play a supportive role to set up Stealth Rock, use Assault Vest to sponge hits from Tapu Koko, or even run Knock Off to punish Porygon2 switch-ins for Greninja. Rotom-H is another great choice, as it's a good check to Tapu Koko and can use Trick to scare off Porygon2. Landorus-T and Rotom-H are also notable for underspeeding a wide variety of threats that Greninja can punish, but faster options, such as Tapu Koko and Thundurus-T, are also good choices.</p> <p>While most offensive Pokemon appreciate chip damage, it is key to Greninja's success as a cleaner rather than just a revenge killer. Stealth Rock support from bulky setters such as Landorus-T is the easiest way to achieve this, and Pokemon that can help against Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Electric-types such as Thundurus-T are particularly good choices. Good examples include Hippowdon, which is notable for kicking up a Sandstorm to rack up even more residual damage, and Ferrothorn, which does an excellent job at defeating Tapu Koko that lack Hidden Power Fire.</p>"

      "Substitute + Torrent": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>This Greninja attempts to bust through bulky foes with powerful Torrent-powered attacks. Substitute is the key to this tactic, safely whittling Greninja's HP into the one-third range for Torrent to activate. Hydro Cannon, when paired with Waterium Z and a Torrent boost, becomes an extremely powerful attack. Even foes that resist Hydro Vortex, such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Fini, will take over 50% from it! Additionally, Hydro Vortex also assassinates Blaziken through its Protect after Stealth Rock damage, thus removing its ability to revenge kill Greninja easily. Water Shuriken further accentuates Greninja's power against Blaziken, KOing Mega Blaziken after a Hydro Vortex through its Protect, in addition to picking off weakened threats. Ice Beam deals massive damage to Mega Salamence, Naganadel, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Serperior. Dark Pulse is a secondary STAB attack that does good damage to Aegislash and has a chance to make the foe flinch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Greninja should always have Waterium Z, which makes Hydro Cannon less risky. 4 Special Defense EVs are needed to allow Greninja to survive a Sludge Bomb from offensive Mega Gengar. A Timid nature lets Greninja outspeed Mega Salamence and Naganadel.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The general idea is to use Substitute three times against offensive Pokemon, which will put Greninja into Torrent's range. Using Hydro Vortex from Hydro Cannon is the best option when in Torrent range in most cases. While Hydro Vortex is extremely powerful when boosted by Torrent, some bulkier switch-ins to Greninja such as Ferrothorn will still survive it, so it's usually best to save Greninja for mid- or late-game, when such threats are in KO range.</p> <p>With Torrent, Hydro Canon on its own is still very powerful. When using this move, make sure setup sweepers are either gone or easily checked by your team, or you'll be severely punished due to the recharge turn. Regardless, expect to lose Greninja the next turn if this doesn't end the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Users of U-turn and Volt Switch are extremely useful to Greninja, since not only do these moves help scout your opponent's team to determine when to set up a Substitute more easily, they also get Greninja in safely. Good examples of such Pokemon that pair well with Greninja include Landorus-T, Rotom-H, Thundurus-T, Zapdos, and Scizor.</p> <p>It is a good idea to have checks to bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini, and Ferrothorn and Snorlax in particular even though Hydro Vortex hits them hard. Thundurus-T hits Tapu Fini hard and smashes Ferrothorn with Focus Blast while helping against Tapu Koko, a potential revenge killer. Mega Charizard X and Y and Blaziken do well against Ferrothorn, deal massive damage to Snorlax, and have ways around Tapu Fini. If bulky Water-types are especially problematic, Tapu Bulu can be used, as it does well against Tapu Fini and Mega Gyarados and can deal heavy damage to Snorlax.</p>"
      },
      "Torrent + Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Unlike other Focus Sash Greninja sets, this set focuses on Greninja's ability to disrupt opposing leads. Taunt is an excellent way to stop the opponent's gameplans such as setting up Stealth Rock or Trick Room, coming in handy later to stop other Pokemon from setting up. Greninja needs a reliable Water-type STAB attack to use when Torrent is activated, and Scald is a perfect fit with the bonus of potentially burning targets. Surf is also a reasonable option, as it is slightly more powerful and does not interfere with status from teammates. Water Shuriken is a useful priority attack that can easily pick off lead Blaziken after a hit from Scald as well as let Greninja sweep late-game when Torrent would be activated.</p> <p>The last moveslot is team specific. Ice Beam is useful for hitting Dragon-types like Mega Salamence, Naganadel, and Garchomp hard and does good damage to Breloom and Serperior. Dark Pulse is a reliable STAB attack that has a chance to make opposing Pokemon flinch and isn't affected by Mega Charizard Y's sun. Finally, Toxic may seem strange, but it's useful for crippling bulky switch-ins such as Porygon2 and Snorlax.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature with maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed is needed to outspeed major threats such as Mega Salamence and Naganadel and deal as much damage as possible. Since this Greninja usually focuses on using its STAB attacks, Torrent is a better option than Protean to take advantage of boosted Water-type attacks when Greninja is low on health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Greninja is best used early-game, since Focus Sash will allow it to survive an attack and it does a great job at stopping teams from executing their early-game plans with Taunt. However, Greninja doesn't need to be sacrificed early-game, since, with Torrent, it has the potential to sweep offensive teams late-game, especially if Stealth Rock isn't up on your side. However, note that due to its lower coverage in comparison to Protean Greninja, this Greninja isn't as effcient at late-game sweeping.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Consider Pokemon that benefit from Stealth Rock being off the field, since this Greninja prevents it early-game, as well as setup sweepers that benefit from bulky Pokemon being Taunted. Volcarona is an excellent example — it can easily set up Quiver Dance with Stealth Rock off the field and bulky foes such as Porygon2 and Hippowdon unable to inflict it with status or phaze it due to Taunt. Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y are also reasonable options, but note that Mega Charizard Y's sun will weaken Greninja's Water-type moves. Mega Salamence is an especially notable option, since this Greninja can cripple Porygon2 with Toxic. Landorus-T, having little issue with Stealth Rock can also work well here due to Greninja crippling common checks to it.</p>"

      "Physically Based Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Choice Scarf may seem strange on such a fast Pokemon, but it allows Greninja to revenge kill many prominent speedy Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko, and Pokemon that boost their Speed, such as Naganadel, Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Salamence. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types that would otherwise wall Greninja, such as Tapu Fini, and OHKOes Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko. Ice Beam allows Greninja to effectively revenge kill Landorus-T and Dragon-types. U-turn gives Greninja a way to break Mimikyu's Disguise without putting itself in danger and can work well when leading. Rock Slide allows Greninja to revenge kill Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y, deal massive damage to Mega Charizard X, and 2HKO Araquanid switch-ins. Rock Tomb is less powerful than Rock Slide, but its speed control can be useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack EVs are needed so Greninja can revenge kill its targets. A Naive nature is preferred, since this Greninja needs Ice Beam to KO Dragon-types and it leaves Greninja less vulnerable to priority attacks compared to a Hasty nature. Protean is required because Greninja's attacks are fairly weak without a STAB boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Using U-turn early-game gives Greninja increased scouting potential, making it an excellent lead. Its increased Speed also makes Greninja a great revenge killer of Speed-boosting threats such as Mega Salamence, Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Naganadel. Since this Greninja uses Choice Scarf and is physically based, bulky Pokemon, such as Porygon2, Chansey, and Ferrothorn are massive problems for it, so consider benching it when facing stall teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock support helps ensure that Greninja does not miss KOing important threats like Naganadel. Good, bulky candidates include Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Ferrothorn, but more offensive setters such as Garchomp can also work.</p> <p>Defensive Pokemon that often show up outside of stall teams, such as Porygon2 and Ferrothorn, are also big issues for this Greninja, and Kartana is more threatening than usual due to this Greninja's focus on physical attacks. These factors make Mega Charizard X an excellent teammate, since it easily sets up on Ferrothorn, forces out Kartana that lack Giga Impact, and also takes pressure off Greninja to surprise Tapu Koko. Volcarona is another awesome Fire-type that has the bonus of setting up against Porygon2 that lack a way to inflict paralysis. Mega Lopunny and Blaziken are less bulky but speedy teammates that can threaten many of Choice Scarf Greninja's threats as well.</p>"

Sparkling Aria not only ignores Substitutes, but it also allows the use of Oceanic Operetta with Primarium Z, an extremely powerful one-use attack that can KO weakened walls; however, note that, unlike Sparkling Aria, it does not ignore Substitute.

Thanks to Primarina's good special bulk, its lack of recovery, and offensive nature, it is a good user of Assault Vest as well. A Quiet nature is also a reasonable choice with 0 Speed IVs on Trick Room teams. Additionally, for more bulk, consider an EV spread of 236 HP / 148 Def / 124 SpA for surviving an Adamant Mega Salamence's Double-Edge. The last move slot is a major toss-up in particular. Hidden Power Fire lets Primarina hit Ferrothorn hard, a Pokemon that is usually a safe check. Encore punishes slower Pokemon, while Perish Song is great at stopping Baton Pass teams and setting up win conditions at the very last Pokemon.

While Hydro Pump and Scald may seem appealing, Sparking Aria is still the preferred option, since it ignores Substitute. Since bulk isn't a concern, Mild is actually the preferred nature, since it makes Aqua Jet a bit more powerful. Modest is still fine if more bulk is preferred.

  "Mimikyu": {
    "overview": "<p>Mimikyu sets itself apart from the rest of the metagame with its signature ability, Disguise, which lets it avoid taking damage once. Due to the fact that role compression is difficult and defensive counterplay against rampaging threats like Mega Salamence, Mega Blaziken, Naganadel, and Mega Charizard X is insufficient, Disguise is invaluable due to it letting Mimikyu reliably revenge kill many sweepers in the metagame. On top of easily making Mimikyu the best revenge killer, Disguise also eases setup, allowing Mimikyu to boost its mediocre Attack with Swords Dance and effectively clean late-game as well. In addition, a relevant Pokemon in BSS that resists Mimikyu's STAB moves is nowhere to be found, and this leaves it as one of the most dreaded foes for offensive teams, as switching into Mimikyu is difficult when taking into account its strong, exclusive Z-Move, Let's Snuggle Forever. Mimikyu is also capable of providing exceptional team support options. It can force a trade with Destiny Bond, be a reliable Trick Room setter thanks to Disguise and its ability to pressure Taunt users, and provide other utility options by using Destiny Bond, Taunt, Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and more.</p> <p>However, Mimikyu's reliance on Disguise comes with a few notable drawbacks. As Mimikyu is very vulnerable to getting revenge killed after its Disguise has been broken, it would attempt to preserve Disguise by any means necessary, and this limits Mimikyu's opportunity to switch into attacks despite having three immunities. Mold Breaker users like Mega Gyarados and Excadrill can easily KO Mimikyu through Disguise, although its matchup against the former can be alleviated by using a bulky EV spread. Lastly, the general prevalence of Fairy-types leaves many teams in Battle Spot Singles naturally prepared against Mimikyu to an extent. Mimikyu also suffers from the popularity of Steel-types like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Heatran and bulky foes such as Landorus-T and Porygon2, which are all capable of beating it or hampering its ability to sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mimikyu has various utility moves available. Will-O-Wisp can be used to punish foes like Landorus-T and Ferrothorn by crippling them on when they switch in, and it is also effective if used in tandem with Focus Sash or a bulky EV spread. Thunder Wave can be used to shut down foes like Mega Salamence and Naganadel by reducing their Speed, but it is usually better for Mimikyu to simply revenge kill them instead. Taunt can be used to shut down slower leads like Hippowdon when Mimikyu is using the Trick Room set, but it is generally hard to fit. Destiny Bond can be used to catch bulky foes like Porygon2 and Celesteela off guard. Coverage moves like Drain Punch and Wood Hammer can be used to surprise Steel-types and Swampert respectively, but they are too situational, and Mimikyu's boosted STAB Z-Moves already inflict heavy damage to most defensive foes.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Mega Mawile force Mimikyu to rely on Shadow Claw to effectively combat them and have enough bulk to easily take boosted attacks if healthy enough. The former two, on top of being able to OHKO Mimikyu with their Steel-type STAB attacks, can even avoid taking heavy damage from a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare with a well-timed use of Protect. Stakataka, although it is less common, can take advantage of the Trick Room that Mimikyu may attempt to set.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Foes</strong>: Mimikyu tends to struggle at effectively dealing with physically defensive foes such as Landorus-T, Porygon2, Hippowdon, Toxapex, and Mega Venusaur due to their formidable physical bulk. However, the former three do not appreciate Curse or boosted Let's Snuggle Forever if they have taken sufficient prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Mold Breaker Users</strong>: Mimikyu is reliant on Disguise to revenge kill a foe, and thus it struggles to stop Mega Gyarados and Excadrill, both of which can hit Mimikyu through Disguise. However, Mega Gyarados requires a boost to OHKO Mimikyu, and even if it has set up beforehand, it can still be revenge killed by variants of Mimikyu using a Focus Sash or a bulky EV spread.</p> <p><strong>Multi-hit Move Users</strong>: Icicle Spear from Mamoswine and Cloyster and Bullet Seed from Breloom can bust Disguise with the first hit and do heavy damage to Mimikyu. However, none of them can effectively handle boosted Mimikyu, and Breloom cannot take on Mimikyu without its Focus Sash intact. Torrent Greninja, especially if it is behind a Substitute, can take out Mimikyu with Torrent-boosted Water Shuriken if lucky enough.</p> <p><strong>Pivoting Moves</strong>: Normally, offensive threats would avoid the matchup with Mimikyu due to them fearing Mimikyu taking a hit with Disguise and retaliating with a strong Z-Move. However, U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Greninja can simultaneously bust Mimikyu's Disguise and let them pivot out without fearing retaliation.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance sharply increases Mimikyu's Attack, compensating for its rather lacking damage putout and immediately turning it into an offensive threat. Thanks to Disguise, Mimikyu can easily find an opportunity to set up Swords Dance. Play Rough is Mimikyu's strongest STAB move and hits Dragon-types super effectively, letting Mimikyu check threats like Mega Salamence and Garchomp. Shadow Sneak is indispensable, as it lets Mimikyu revenge kill weakened foes without risking the loss of Disguise. Shadow Sneak also aids Mimikyu's matchup against Focus Sash users and bulkier foes, which would otherwise proceed to KO Mimikyu after busting its Disguise and surviving a hit. Shadow Claw is a stronger Ghost-type STAB move that provides Mimikyu with a stronger way to damage Tapu Lele, Cresselia, and Steel-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature maximizes Mimikyu's damage output, and maximum Speed investment lets Mimikyu outspeed neutral-natured Tapu Lele and anything slower. Jolly nature might be an appealing option to outspeed Timid Tapu Lele, but Mimikyu desires as much power as possible, and the opportunity cost of forgoing Mimikyu's proficiency against bulky foes such as Porygon2 and the fact that Tapu Lele commonly runs Choice Scarf leaves this as an inferior option.</p> <p>Mimikium Z or Ghostium Z can be used, depending on which foe Mimikyu is aiming to defeat. Mimikium Z has better damage output and notably lets Mimikyu take out offensive Mega Salamence with a combination of Let's Snuggle Forever and Shadow Sneak most of the time, factoring inIntimidate. Ghostium Z allows Mimikyu to use Never-Ending Nightmare, which is weaker but has better coverage and gives Mimikyu a chance to defeat weakened Steel-types after a Swords Dance. Focus Sash trades Mimikyu's ability to swiftly take out offensive foes using a Z-Move for the ability to survive a hit from full health, essentially guarding it from two attacks as long as Mimikyu keeps its health and Disguise unharmed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This variant of Mimikyu should be saved until late-game in order to clean up weakened teams or revenge kill foes, as it is heavily reliant on Disguise to set up or take a hit. Although it would be hard to do so, it is the most ideal to set up on forced switches so that Mimikyu can boost its Attack while keeping its Disguise intact, making even harder to revenge kill. Against slower teams, Mimikyu with a Z-Crystal does not necessarily have to be preserved until late-game, as boosted Mimikyu's Z-Move is powerful in its own right and can heavily damage foes like Landorus-T and Porygon2 to the point where its team can pick them off. Ghostium Z variants can take advantage of Steel-types' tendency to switch into Mimikyu and heavily damage them early-game for its teammates to deal with them more easily late-game. Switching Mimikyu into any foe is usually discouraged due to how invaluable Disguise is to Mimikyu, but it can be switched in if Mimikyu's Disguise is no longer needed or if a switch-in for Normal-, Fighting-, and Dragon-type attack or a powerful Z-Move is desperately needed. Lastly, when Mimikyu is attempting to pick off a foe with Shadow Sneak, be wary of Psychic Terrain, as it prevents Mimikyu from effectively removing it while preserving Disguise.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Thanks to Mimikyu's role compression as a reliable cleaner and blanket check to most setup sweepers, it can fit into essentially most offensive teams. Strong attackers like Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Salamence are capable of causing serious damage to common defensive cores, and Mimikyu can benefit from their ability to weaken foes so that it won't be overly reliant on its Z-Move to sweep. Fire-types can threaten Steel-types that will have to be weakened or eliminated for Mimikyu to be successful. Teammates that can pivot are also useful, as they help Mimikyu reliably switch in while maintaining Disguise. Tapu Koko can threaten Celesteela while luring in and weakening Landorus-T thanks to Hidden Power Ice, while Landorus-T can provide Stealth Rock support and threaten Steel-types like Heatran. Tapu Fini checks Mega Gyarados and bulky foes like Mega Charizard X and Heatran, all of which Mimikyu does not have a favorable matchup against. Depending on the variant, it can weaken various walls like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn by utilizing either Nature's Madness or an offensive moveset employing Waterium Z and Hidden Power Fire.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance, Play Rough, and Shadow Sneak are all vital moves for variants of Mimikyu using offensively oriented sets, as Swords Dance allow Mimikyu to threaten bulky foes, Play Rough is needed to check Dragon-types, and Shadow Sneak is needed to pick off weakened foes without busting Disguise. Trick Room, however, can be used instead of Swords Dance if Mimikyu's team largely relies on Trick Room to effectively function. Curse can be used to wear down physically defensive foes like Landorus-T, Porygon2, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn, all of which Mimikyu tends to draw in often, and Curse also allows Mimikyu to preserve momentum after it has been weakened enough. Shadow Claw is a justifiable option that can be used to hit Steel- and Poison-types hard after Swords Dance boosts.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread ensures that Mimikyu will always survive Adamant Mega Blaziken's Flare Blitz and +1 Adamant Mega Gyarados's Waterfall and Crunch while almost always surviving Jolly Mega Salamence's Double-Edge. The EV spread also allows Mimikyu to take a Psyshock from Modest Tapu Lele and a Foul Play from Analytic Porygon2 when at +2. 16 EVs from Attack can be moved to HP or Defense so that Mimikyu is guaranteed to survive an unboosted attack from Jolly Mega Salamence while retaining an odd number of HP to use Curse effectively. An alternative EV spread of 228 HP / 252 Attack / 28 Defense an with Adamant nature is a viable option to maximize Mimikyu's damage output while retaining good matchup against Jolly Mega Gyarados. Even when running reduced Attack investment, Mimikyu is still strong enough to take out a good portion of offensive threats in the metagame with a combination of Let's Snuggle Forever and Shadow Sneak. This leaves Mimikium Z as the most ideal item.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If using Swords Dance and three attacks, Mimikyu has to be kept in pristine condition so that it can effectively clean up or revenge kill setup sweepers. However, as this set is capable of surviving a number of strong attacks, Mimikyu can take more aggressive approaches to stop Mega Blaziken and even Mega Gyarados. Mimikyu can also take advantage of its increased bulk to weaken foes early-game with Curse or boosted Let's Snuggle Forever. Curse is especially useful for wearing down a foe and retaining momentum when Mimikyu has been weakened and is no longer needed. When using Trick Room, depending on the matchup, Mimikyu can be used aggressively early-game to weaken a foe and set Trick Room for its team, or it can still be preserved for revenge killing a foe that the rest of its team is not likely going to be able to keep in check.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive teammates like Mega Blaziken and Tapu Koko pair well with Mimikyu, as Mimikyu's ability to blanket check most offensive threats is always appreciated. Mimikyu can lure in and heavily damage physically defensive foes like Celesteela and Porygon2 for teammates like Mega Salamence to easily defeat them later. In general, most foes that attempt to combat Mimikyu, such as Landorus-T, will resort to taking a boosted Let's Snuggle Forever or getting afflicted by Curse, and many offensive teammates can take advantage of this and have easier time dealing with their weakened checks. When running Trick Room, Primarina serves as a good partner, as it is capable of dealing with problematic Pokemon like Heatran and Celesteela, both of which Mimikyu can't deal with reliably. Sparkling Aria and Encore also help the matchup against Substitute users like Aegislash and Heatran. Mega Heracross also enjoys Trick Room support and is capable of breaking down walls like Porygon2 and Ferrothorn and revenge killing Mega Gyarados. Mega Mawile serves as one of the best partners, as not only does it enjoy Trick Room support, but it also appreciates having bulky foes weakened by Curse or even receiving a free turn to set up Swords Dance while a foe afflicted by Curse is forced out.</p>"

      "Curse + Pain Split": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thanks to Disguise, Mimikyu is able to reliably afflict a foe with Curse and repeatedly use Substitute to inflict sizable damage. Pain Split lets Mimikyu take advantage of bulky foes and use Curse multiple times in a match. The last move is used for Mimikyu to retain its offensive presence. Play Rough in tandem with Mimikium Z, especially with offensive investment, is capable of OHKOing many offensive foes like Mega Blaziken and Tapu Koko. Shadow Claw, while weaker, has much better coverage than Play Rough and can be used in tandem with Ghostium Z.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Offensive investment is the most effective so that Mimikyu will retain its usefulness against offensive foes as much as possible, and investing in HP makes Pain Split somewhat inefficient. An Adamant nature is generally preferred to maximize Mimikyu's damage output, but a Jolly nature is also an option to outspeed Timid Tapu Lele and set up Substitute against Heatran more reliably. Mimikium Z with Play Rough gives Mimikyu access to Let's Snuggle Forever, while Ghostium Z allows Mimikyu to use either Never-Ending Nightmare with Shadow Claw or Z-Curse to fully restore its health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set aims to draw in physically defensive foes and wear them down so that Mimikyu's teammates can easily defeat them later. This set is also very effective as a lead to net heavy damage on problematic foes by utilizing Curse and Pain Split. By utilizing Mimikyu's ability to force out offensive foes and draw in bulky walls, Mimikyu can set up a Substitute on forced switches, afflict a switch-in with Curse, and proceed to stall it out by using Substitute and Pain Split. This especially proves to be a great annoyance to foes like Celesteela and Ferrothorn, which lack reliable forms of recovery. This may prove ineffective against defensive Landorus-T, however, as it can safely bring in a check with U-turn. Although this set lacks Swords Dance and a secondary attacking move, Mimikyu is still powerful in its own right against offensive foes when it has not consumed its Z-Move yet. Mimikyu's Z-Move can be preserved until late-game to swiftly take out a weakened foe to prevent the rest of its team from taking excessive damage, to revenge kill a foe, or to finish a foe if it has been sufficiently weakened by Curse.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Any offensive partners that appreciate Mimikyu's ability to hinder bulky foes such as Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Porygon2 are appreciated. Setup sweepers like Mega Salamence, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gyarados, and Naganadel appreciate the heavy damage dealt on these foes and can even get a turn to freely set up if foes afflicted by Curse switch out. Offensive partners also appreciate Mimikyu's ability to greatly bother defensive teams, as they are often reliant on status to check Mimikyu, and this set can take advantage of this to reliably set up Substitute and wear down defensive foes with Curse and Pain Split.</p>"

Just be warned, this makes Garchomp a hard counter to Nihilego, with Dazzling Gleam becoming the only way Nihilego can deal good damage to it.</li> <li>Focus Sash is usually the best item for Nihilego to get around its extreme weakness to physical attacks, letting it revenge kill threats it normally couldn't such as boosted Mega Charizard X.</li> <li>If Focus Sash is already used up, Life Orb can make an acceptable alternative for the power boost it gives Nihilego, though it does make it harder to play due to its physical frailness.</li> <li>Maximum Special Attack is important for ensuring that Beast Boost gives Nihilego a Special Attack boost, making it capable of sweeping teams.

  "Pheromosa": {
    "overview": "<p>Pheromosa possesses excellent traits as an offensive threat in Battle Spot Singles. Its high offensive stats, nearly unparalleled Speed tier, and decent movepool let it pose a threat to almost the entire metagame. Pheromosa can run a variety of sets, such as mixed attacker and special attacker, both of which are threatening in their own right. In addition, Beast Boost amplifies Pheromosa's offensive presence, as with the right nature, it will progressively become harder to defensively handle due to Beast Boost. Pheromosa's access to U-turn allows it to effectively pivot out of unfavorable matchups, which few offensive threats can do.</p> <p>However, its reliance on Bug- and Fighting-type STAB moves to effectively dish out damage means Pheromosa suffers from the prevalence of Ghost-types such as Aegislash, Mega Gengar, and Mimikyu, all of which not only discourage Pheromosa's strongest STAB move, High Jump Kick, but also can effectively wall or defeat it, depending on what move Pheromosa opts for on its already crowded space for coverage options. Pheromosa's horrid bulk should also be noted, as essentially any neutral hit from an offensive foe will likely KO it, and some priority moves like Mamoswine's Ice Shard can pick off Pheromosa with some prior damage. This means Pheromosa is reliant on predictions and being able to KO a foe; if it fails to accomplish either, it will not likely be given a second chance.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>High Jump Kick's chance of missing and crash damage may make Low Kick seem like a reasonable substitute, but its inconsistent Base Power can prove to be quite detrimental against certain foes. Pheromosa generally has a hard time fitting any other moves other than the ones that are already listed. Lunge weakens a switch-in, and unlike U-turn, it aids Pheromosa better in an event when it can sweep without forcing Pheromosa out, but it is generally not worth forgoing Pheromosa's ability to pivot. Taunt might seem useful especially when Pheromosa is used as a lead, but Pheromosa it already forces out the majority of entry hazard setters, and its lack of bulk prevents it from effectively preventing the use of status moves even against the likes of Hippowdon, which 2HKOes Pheromosa with Earthquake and sandstorm damage. Protect prevents Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Lopunny from chunking away at Pheromosa's health with Fake Out and breaking its Focus Sash, but it has little use outside of this. Lastly, Groundium Z in tandem with Drill Run can be used to reliably 2HKO Aegislash and Toxapex as well as easing predictions against the former's King's Shield, but forgoing the consistent boost in power from Life Orb isn't ideal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Mimikyu, Aegislash, and Mega Gengar force Pheromosa into predictions by discouraging the use of High Jump Kick. Ghost-types also resist U-turn, meaning there isn't a significant risk involved when they switch into Pheromosa. Aegislash hopelessly shuts down any Pheromosa lacking Drill Run, and offensive variants can take advantage of the move to activate Weakness Policy and OHKO Pheromosa next turn with +2 Shadow Sneak after it has switched into Stealth Rock or has taken recoil damage from Life Orb. Mimikyu would generally avoid switching into Pheromosa in order to preserve Disguise unless desperately needed, but it is guaranteed to win in a one-on-one scenario thanks to its ability.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Toxapex and Mega Venusaur can take on Pheromosa thanks to their typing. However, the former is 2HKOed by Drill Run after Stealth Rock damage, and Life Orb-boosted U-turn from Naughty Pheromosa does upwards of 36% damage to the latter.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types resist both of Pheromosa's STAB moves. Therefore, Tapu Fini, Primarina, and Assault Vest Tapu Bulu can switch in and either force out or KO Pheromosa. However, it is important to note that Poison Jab can OHKO or 2HKO all of them, and some variants of Tapu Bulu may be 2HKOed by Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam after Stealth Rock, depending on Tapu Bulu's investment. After Intimidate, Mega Mawile narrowly avoids a 2HKO from High Jump Kick from Pheromosa lacking Life Orb and can easily OHKO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Pheromosa's horrendous bulk leaves it susceptible to priority moves like Fake Out, Bullet Punch, Sucker Punch, and Ice Shard from various foes like Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Mawile, Mamoswine, and Mamoswine, especially if it continues to take damage from Life Orb recoil or switching into entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Certain Choice Scarf users, such as Garchomp and Timid Tapu Lele, can outspeed and OHKO Pheromosa before it is able to pivot out with U-turn or KO them first.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick, with a Naughty nature and a boost from Life Orb, inflicts serious damage on any non-resistant foe, being capable of scoring 2HKOs on some of the physically bulkiest foes, such as Celesteela, Hippowdon, and Mega Scizor. U-turn allows Pheromosa to pivot out on forced switches and in unfavorable matchups, letting it do decent damage while securing momentum. Ice Beam OHKOes very common threats such as Landorus-T, Mega Salamence, Naganadel, and Garchomp, all of which can comfortably handle Pheromosa's other attacks. The last moveslot is flexible and can be chosen according to Pheromosa's teammates will benefit from. Drill Run can bulky Mega Gengar (with a Naughty nature) and has a chance to 2HKO defensive Aegislash and Toxapex. Poison Jab hits Fairy-types, notably letting Pheromosa 2HKO Tapu Fini, which it otherwise cannot 2HKO, and quickly dispose of Tapu Lele, Assault Vest Tapu Bulu, and Primarina.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Pheromosa's general damage output by letting it hit foes as hard as possible with physical moves. The nature can be chosen depending on what Pheromosa has to accomplish; a Naughty nature allows Pheromosa to meet many important offensive benchmarks, such as being able to 2HKO Hippowdon, Celesteela, and Skarmory with High Jump Kick, and usually OHKO bulky Mega Gengar with Drill Run. A Naughty nature also boosts Pheromosa's Attack with Beast Boost every time it KOes a foe. A Naive nature, on the other hand, forgoes damage output in exchange for Pheromosa's ability to outspeed neutral-natured Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T and Tapu Lele, +1 Mega Gyarados, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Manectric. Life Orb boosts Pheromosa's general damage output beyond serviceable levels by turning many 3HKOs into 2HKOs at the cost of recoil damage, which isn't too detrimental when accounting for Pheromosa's frailty. A Focus Sash prevents Pheromosa from getting OHKOed; if the item is properly preserved, it can let Pheromosa revenge kill dangerous threats like boosted Mega Salamence in a pinch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to the number of foes it can threaten, Pheromosa makes an effective lead that can force switches and grab momentum for its team. If not used as a lead, Pheromosa shouldn't be brought into any attacks but through pivoting from a different teammate, double switching, or switching in after a teammate faints instead. Use prediction to maximize Pheromosa's damage output, especially when using High Jump Kick. Unless Ghost-type foes are absent, it is safer to use U-turn early in order to analyze how an opponent responds to Pheromosa and avoid retaliation from Focus Sash users. Predicting Ghost-types switching in is a promising idea, especially if Pheromosa is sure to force out a foe, as an appropriate prediction against the likes of Aegislash and Mega Gengar will make them easier to take down later. If equipped with a Focus Sash, Pheromosa can be used in a straightforward way to revenge kill a foe by utilizing its item to survive any attack from full health. When using High Jump Kick, be wary of foes that may carry Protect, such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Although Pheromosa requires relatively minimal support from its team to successfully perform its role, some Pokemon are notable for providing invaluable support when paired with it. Tapu Lele is one of the best teammates to Pheromosa for a number of reasons. Not only does Tapu Lele break through Poison-types like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur with ease, it also summons Psychic Terrain, which protects Pheromosa from priority moves like Shadow Sneak from Mimikyu and Ice Shard from Mamoswine. Tape Lele is also capable of weakening physically defensive foes that Pheromosa could struggle to break past, depending on its moveset. Dark-types generally aid Pheromosa thanks to their ability to deal with Ghost-types. Tyranitar provides Stealth Rock support, removes or weakens Ghost-types with Pursuit, checks Mega Salamence and both Mega Charizard formes, and, if running an offensive set, benefits from Pheromosa's ability to threaten traditional physical walls like Landorus-T and Porygon2. The rare Hydreigon can threaten Ghost-types while also providing Pheromosa a safe switch-in with U-turn. If paired with Hydreigon, Pheromosa can run Poison Jab to effectively punish Fairy-types that massively threaten Hydreigon. Steel-types provide Pheromosa with a safe switch-in for Fairy- and Flying-types, depending on their own typing. Celesteela blanket checks all Fairy-types with the exception of Tapu Koko and offensive Tapu Fini, both of which Pheromosa can lure in and punish with Drill Run and Poison Jab. Ferrothorn provides Stealth Rock support to ensure Flying-types that attempt to switch into High Jump Kick or U-turn are punished and proves to be a more reliable check to Fairy-types than Celesteela. Heatran can also set Stealth Rock, lure in Tapu Fini and eliminate it with Bloom Doom, and check Aegislash.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Focus Blast is this set's main STAB move that does massive damage to foes, particularly the ones that can handle physically oriented variants of Pheromosa. While Focus Blast's accuracy is unreliable, with Fightinium Z it turns into a perfectly accurate attack that OHKOes Celesteela and Tapu Koko after some prior damage, even when unboosted. Ice Beam hits Flying-types that resist Focus Blast like Mega Salamence and Gliscor. It is also capable of 2HKOing most Tapu Bulu variants after Stealth Rock damage with investment in Special Attack. The third move allows Pheromosa to capitalize on the switches it forces in different ways. Quiver Dance boosts Pheromosa's already good damage output to the point where All-Out Pummeling's power reaches lethal levels, and it also lets Pheromosa outspeed all Choice Scarf users, making it significantly more difficult to revenge kill without a priority move. U-turn, on the other hand, is still a justifiable move due to the momentum Pheromosa can provide its team with on forced switches. Bug Buzz is a secondary STAB move that can 2HKO Mega Venusaur and specially defensive Mega Sableye after a boost, which Ice Beam fails to do. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ghost OHKOes both Mega Gengar and Mimikyu without Disguise after Stealth Rock damage and a Quiver Dance boost. Hidden Power Ground, on the other hand, 2HKOes Toxapex at +1. Shock Wave has a chance to OHKO Gyarados, which is otherwise a good check to this set, while still hitting Toxapex as hard as Hidden Power Ground would. Shock Wave also OHKOes Mega Charizard Y after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is ideal for maximizing Pheromosa's damage output and Speed. A Modest nature allows Pheromosa to hit as hard as possible while gaining a Special Attack boost every time it KOes a foe, while a Timid nature allows unboosted Pheromosa to outspeed some setup sweepers that are at +1 and some Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T. Fightinium Z turns Focus Blast into All-Out Pummeling, which is very hard to handle, especially when Pheromosa has accumulated boosts, and is perfectly accurate. Buginium Z lets Pheromosa use Savage Spin-Out to OHKO Tapu Lele, Mega Metagross, and Cresselia, which are offensive or defensive checks to Pheromosa. Life Orb, on the other hand, improves Pheromosa's general damage output and lets +1 Pheromosa OHKO Mega Gengar with Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Ghost and have a chance to OHKO Tapu Koko and Mega Charizard Y with Focus Blast and Shock Wave after Stealth Rock, respectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pheromosa aims to gain an opportunity to sweep by netting a surprise KO on a foe that expects a different set and gaining a boost from Beast Boost or by setting up with Quiver Dance on a forced switch. If Pheromosa opts for U-turn over Quiver Dance, it can bluff another set by acting as a pivot early-game. Otherwise, Pheromosa can proceed to set up Quiver Dance on a foe it naturally threatens and overwhelm the switch-in with coverage moves or a boosted All-Out Pummeling. However, as this set may lack a coverage move to hit Ghost-types or other foes like Toxapex, they must be weakened or removed beforehand. Mimikyu in particular is problematic, as it can't be OHKOed by any move with full HP and has Disguise to even take on boosted Pheromosa. Entry hazards aid Pheromosa with bypassing Focus Sash users and wearing down checks like Mega Charizard Y, Gyarados, and Volcarona.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pheromosa mostly needs teammates that can take on Ghost-, Fairy-, and Poison-types and reliably set entry hazards. This means that durable Steel-types that can switch into Fairy-types, set Stealth Rock, or do both, such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Celesteela, are good partners to this set. Tapu Lele protects Pheromosa from priority moves by summoning Psychic Terrain and blasts through Toxapex, which is very problematic for sets lacking Hidden Power Ground. Dark-types can combat Ghost-types that Pheromosa may struggle to defeat when lacking Hidden Power Ghost. Tyranitar is a good teammate that can weaken or remove Ghost-types for Pheromosa in advance with Pursuit. Should Pheromosa need a safe condition that guarantees a turn to set up, dedicated leads like Alolan Ninetales, Tapu Koko, and Hippowdon that can set dual screens or Aurora Veil and use Memento or Yawn are feasible options.</p>"

  "Xurkitree": {
    "overview": "<p>Xurkitree boasts a jaw-dropping Special Attack stat that can be further boosted with Tail Glow and Beast Boost, allowing it to be either a terrifying wallbreaker with Tail Glow or a dangerous cleaner with Choice Scarf. Xurkitree also has a small yet effective movepool, with access to both Hidden Power Ice and Energy Ball to rip through common Ground-types that check other Electric-types. Though Xurkitree's lack of relevant resistances, mediocre Speed, and rather poor bulk may make it seem helpless against offensive teams, it can overcome these shortcomings to an extent with the use of Z-Hypnosis. Choice Scarf also is a way to alleviate Xurkitree's issues with its middling Speed tier.</p> <p>However, Xurkitree tends to struggle with successfully functioning in practice, even with a dedicated team support. Xurkitree's reliance on hitting Hypnosis to feasibly gain a chance to sweep due to its bulk means that missing Hypnosis will likely result in Xurkitree being KOed. The Choice Scarf set also has notable flaws in being prediction reliant and unable to threaten defensive teams in a significant way. In addition, similarly to many frail setup sweepers in the metagame, Xurkitree's sweep can be cut short by priority moves or by a very common revenge killer, Mimikyu. Lastly, Xurkitree's rather inconsistent performance leaves it competing with other Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Thundurus-T, and Magnezone, due to their better Speed tier, better utility options, or both.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Xurkitree has few justifiable options apart from the ones that have already been addressed due to its rather barren movepool. Dazzling Gleam OHKOes Hydreigon and Kommo-o but has little use outsides this. Hidden Power Ground quickly disposes of Heatran and allows Xurkitree to deal with Assault Vest Magnezone and the rare Alolan Marowak, but Magnezone is set up on by Tail Glow variants of Xurkitree regardless and the opportunity cost of forgoing Hidden Power Ice makes this option rather unprofitable. The Z-Hypnosis set can opt to forgo Tail Glow for three attacks to maximize its coverage options, but this leaves Xurkitree unable to deal with bulkier teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Although Xurkitree always has ways to defeat them with right moves and predictions, Ground-types are capable of offensively checking Xurkitree and forcing Choice Scarf variants into predictions. Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill naturally outspeed Xurkitree and can viably run Choice Scarf to outspeed and revenge kill Choice Scarf Xurkitree, but the former two are OHKOed if switched into Hidden Power Ice. The former two may also be surprised by Xurkitree with the occasional Shuca Berry. Swampert is also capable of defeating Xurkitree that lack Energy Ball.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Xurkitree's frailty forces it to rely on outspeeding a foe with a boost from Z-Hypnosis or Choice Scarf to function effectively against offensive teams, and this leaves it vulnerable to faster foes and other Choice Scarf users. Pheromosa and Mega Alakazam can outspeed even Choice Scarf Xurkitree and KO it, while other Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele can do the same if given a safe switch. Mega Blaziken can use Protect to outspeed +1 Xurkitree and OHKO the next turn with a STAB move of its choice.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Assault Vest Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur resist Thunderbolt and can take Hidden Power Ice due to their item, typing, or ability. However, they are all prone to getting overwhelmed by boosted Xurkitree, and they might even find themselves being set up on by Z-Hypnosis Xurkitree.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types, such as Mega Charizard X and Hydreigon, resist Thunderbolt, do not fall to Hidden Power Ice, naturally outspeed Xurkitree, and can revenge kill Xurkitree with their STAB moves with or without prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's ridiculous special bulk allows it to easily take any attacks from unboosted Xurkitree. That said, Chansey cannot stop Xurkitree from setting up Tail Glow and boosted Xurkitree will KO Chansey faster than Chansey stalls Xurkitree with Toxic damage.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Xurkitree's frailty leaves it susceptible to priority moves, which can pick it off after it has taken sufficient prior damage. However, it is important to note that Sucker Punch users like Mega Mawile or Mega Kangaskhan has to play with caution, as the move fails if Xurkitree decides to use Hypnosis.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Z-Hypnosis": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hypnosis puts a foe to sleep, allowing Xurkitree to safely set up Tail Glow and potentially avoid getting revenge killed by Focus Sash users and Mimikyu. With Psychium Z, Xurkitree can use Z-Hypnosis, which allows it to gain a Speed boost and outspeed most of the unboosted metagame. Tail Glow boosts Xurkitree's already astronomical Special Attack stat to the point where it can rip through foes that resist its moves with brute force. Thunderbolt is Xurkitree's most consistent Electric-type STAB move and deals heavy damage to neutral foes even when unboosted. The fourth move rounds out Xurkitree's coverage by hitting Ground-types. Hidden Power Ice OHKOes the most common Ground-type in Battle Spot Singles in Landorus-T, hits Thundurus-T, and disposes of Assault Vest Tapu Bulu at +3 after Stealth Rock damage. Energy Ball handles Ground-types that are not weak to Hidden Power Ice, such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Mega Swampert. Unlike Hidden Power Ice, boosted Energy Ball also guarantees the immediate removal of specially defensive Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread is ideal for a special sweeper. A Timid nature is chosen, as Xurkitree's stellar Special Attack stat and access to Tail Glow means it is more beneficial to run a Timid nature over Modest to outspeed Mega Lopunny and neutral-natured Pheromosa and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele after Xurkitree has used Z-Hypnosis. Beast Boost increases Xurkitree's Special Attack upon KOing a foe, making boosted Xurkitree even harder to defensively keep in check.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Even if Xurkitree successfully gains +1 Speed from Z-Hypnosis and sets up Tail Glow, its sweep is not necessarily guaranteed, as Choice Scarf users and priority move users can easily revenge kill it, and Xurkitree will have to rely on hitting Hypnosis to bypass Mimikyu and Focus Sash users. This means using Xurkitree is rather a risky move unless there is no other way its team can have the upper hand against the opponent. Xurkitree is best when deployed against defensive or balanced teams, which are sometimes not offensively oriented enough to reliably stop its rampage. Z-Hypnosis is best used against foes that Xurkitree naturally forces out or when Xurkitree needs a boost in Speed to avoid getting revenge killed by faster foes. Especially if Hypnosis was used on the forced switch, Xurkitree will be given a second chance to use Hypnosis in case the move misses or buy more turns to set Tail Glow. Against slower and defensive teams, Xurkitree can aggressively set Tail Glow on passive foes and start obliterating them with boosted attacks while possibly utilizing Hypnosis to shut down problematic foes. Lastly, much like all other setup sweepers, Xurkitree appreciates Stealth Rock, as it breaks Focus Sashes and makes Xurkitree less reliant on hitting Hypnosis to defeat their users reliably.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensively inclined teams appreciate the presence of a Pokemon that can both pressure defensive teams and turn the tables of the match with Z-Hypnosis. Essentially most setup sweepers, such as Mega Salamence, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gyarados, and Mimikyu, appreciate the serious damage Xurkitree can cause on defensive cores or even buy a chance to safely set up if Xurkitree has put a foe to sleep. All aforementioned teammates have a good general performance against most other teams by virtue of better Speed, initial power, or unique ability in Mimikyu's case.</p> <p>Since Xurkitree struggles to find a proper setup opportunity against many teams, it also appreciates offensive threats like Mega Salamence and Tapu Lele naturally drawing in walls like Celesteela or Porygon2, which Xurkitree can attempt setting up on. Bringing in Xurkitree with pivoting is also an option to grant it a favorable matchup, and Landorus-T and Pheromosa are capable of fulfilling this job. The former blanket checks Ground-types like Garchomp and opposing Landorus-T, while the latter can generate momentum with ease thanks to the number of switches it naturally causes to draw in foes like Celesteela, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex, all of which Xurkitree can threaten out and buy a turn to set up.</p> <p>Lastly, just like every setup sweeper, Xurkitree appreciates Stealth Rock support so that it can rely less on Tail Glow in some matchups and bypass Focus Sash users. Dedicated leads that can set entry hazards and generate a setup opportunity with Yawn, such as Hippowdon and Swampert, are decent partners in this regard. Dual screens, Aurora Veil, and Memento users also greatly aid Xurkitree, as they give it more room to breathe and possibly let Xurkitree survive a hit which would KO it otherwise, reducing the risk involved from using Hypnosis. Landorus-T can make a lead and not only set Stealth Rock but also set Gravity for Xurkitree, letting it utilize Hypnosis much more reliably.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt dishes out good damage against neutral foes and is the main tool that Xurkitree can utilize to clean up late-game. Volt Switch is a second Electric-type STAB move that generates momentum on forced switches, though one must be wary of Ground-types possibly switching in. Hidden Power Ice harshly punishes Ground-types that attempt to block Volt Switch by OHKOing the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp. Energy Ball 2HKOes Hippowdon and Excadrill and OHKOes Swampert, all of which would easily check this set and consistently take momentum away from Xurkitree.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximized Special Attack and Speed are ideal for a special Choice Scarf user. A Timid nature allows Xurkitree to outspeed neutral-natured Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T. A Modest nature, on the other hand, slightly improves Xurkitree's damage output, letting it OHKO Tapu Fini most of the time while also granting it a chance to OHKO uninvested Mega Gengar and Mimikyu after Stealth Rock damage and still letting it outspeed base 130 Speed Pokemon. Using Modest does come at the cost of outspeeding a Mega Gyarados after a Dragon Dance, however. Beast Boost allows Xurkitree to effectively clean up late-game by making its attacks progressively harder to handle after it KOes a foe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Xurkitree can function as a fast pivot that can offensively handle Water-types while generating momentum for its team using Volt Switch. This set also sets itself apart from other Electric-type pivots like Tapu Koko or Rotom formes thanks to its ability to easily clean up weakened teams late-game with Beast Boost. However, both of these strengths can be hindered by Ground-types, which can simply render Xurkitree less effective by forcing it to think twice before using Thunderbolt, though most of them are harshly punished if they switch into a wrong move. Lastly, bear in mind that Xurkitree provides little to no defensive utility to its team, so it shouldn't be directly switched in carelessly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite the fact that Xurkitree can punish Ground-type foes with its coverage moves, switch-ins for them are necessary, as Xurkitree locked into an Electric-type move is immediately forced out. Landorus-T and Celesteela can aid Xurkitree, as the former sets Stealth Rock, which Xurkitree benefits from due to the switches it may force, while the latter checks other Choice Scarf users that outspeed Xurkitree if running maximum Speed, such as Tapu Lele, Garchomp, and opposing Landorus-T. Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Assault Vest Tapu Bulu, and Mega Venusaur prove to be a nuisance for this set. Therefore, Mega Salamence and Mega Blaziken are good offensive partners, as they can break through Grass-types, pressure specially defensive foes, and appreciate Xurkitree threatening Celesteela in the former's case and Tapu Fini and Gyarados in the latter's.</p>"
      },
      "Bulkitree": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Tail Glow drastically increases Xurkitree's damage output, letting it OHKO a good portion of the metagame after a boost. Thunderbolt is a STAB move that is mandatory on Xurkitree. Hidden Power Ice hits Ground-types and is capable of OHKOing offensive Mega Salamence and Landorus-T without investment, and the HP investment combined with Shuca Berry allows Xurkitree to survive a hit from them and hit back, offensively checking them. Substitute capitalizes on the switches Xurkitree forces or on passive foes like Celesteela and Ferrothorn by protecting Xurkitree from weak attacks and status moves, as well as making it much harder to revenge kill. The move is also useful for easing predictions. Alternatively, Energy Ball hits Ground-types that do not fall to boosted Hidden Power Ice, narrowing defensive counterplay against Xurkitree.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Xurkitree to meet various defensive benchmarks. From full HP, it always survives +1 Mega Salamence's Double-Edge, +1 Mega Gyarados's STAB moves, and Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech while also enduring Modest Tapu Lele's Psychic most of the time. The EV spread also prevents Ferrothorn from breaking Substitute with a Gyro Ball. Maximum Speed with Timid nature lets Xurkitree outspeed as many defensive foes as possible to reliably set up Tail Glow or use Substitute against as well as hitting the same Speed as Adamant Mimikyu. However, if Xurkitree is employed on teams using Trick Room, it can opt to shift the EV investment on Speed to Special Attack and use a Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs to maximize its damage output and move faster than as many foes as possible when Trick Room is up. Electrium Z gives Xurkitree access to a powerful attack, which is especially helpful when Xurkitree is unboosted, as Xurkitree's initial power is rather lower without investment. Electrium Z also aids Xurkitree with breaking through its defensive checks like Chansey and Assault Vest Magnezone along with Tail Glow. Shuca Berry allows Xurkitree to net surprise KOs on Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp; Wiki Berry, on the other hand, provides a sizable amount of recovery in a pinch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This variant of Xurkitree aims to utilize its increased bulk to ease setup or avoid getting revenge killed. Along with Electrium Z, Xurkitree is capable of surviving a hit from the likes of Tapu Lele or other offensive checks and OHKOing in return with Gigavolt Havoc. Increased bulk also allows Xurkitree to offensively check Earthquake users like Mega Salamence, Landorus-T, and Garchomp in an emergency with Shuca Berry intact. Against defensive teams, Xurkitree can take advantage of passive foes like Toxapex and Cresselia with Substitute, as the former's Scald and the latter's Ice Beam fail to break it in a hit. If Xurkitree has Wiki Berry, its item can further improve its setup opportunities against slower foes by allowing it to set up Substitute multiple times or letting it recover a significant portion of its health. While this Xurkitree must be kept in pristine condition to survive hits against offensive teams, it can set up against defensive teams immediately if no foe in particular is capable of reliably revenge killing it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite the fact that this set is considerably bulkier, team support is always appreciated, as Xurkitree still folds to strong attacks from foes like Mega Charizard X and Mega Kangaskhan. Dedicated leads that can improve Xurkitree's setup condition are appreciated. In this regard, teammates that can use screens, Yawn, and Memento, such as Alolan Ninetales and Hippowdon, are appropriate choices. Landorus-T and Pheromosa draw in passive foes and let Xurkitree safely switch in with U-turn. Essentially, most threats that can pick off weakened teams, such as Mimikyu and Mega Blaziken, appreciate the massive havoc that Xurkitree can wreak on defensive teams.</p>"

Rocky Helmet does make it a better check against physical attackers like Mega Kangaskhan, however, while Aguav Berry can give Celesteela a major boost in health if it goes below 25% of its HP.</p> <p>While Celesteela is usually a physically defensive threat, it can use a specially defensive set as well to better deal with threats such as Tapu Lele.

      "Physical Attacker": {"description": "<p>Beast Boost and Heavy Slam make Celesteela a surprisingly potent physical threat. Flamethrower and Hidden Power Ice help with its coverage issues, although they aren't particularly powerful. Assault Vest makes Celesteela rather difficult to KO and could potentially let it surprise Tapu Koko, which needs Thunderbolt or Gigavolt Havoc to OHKO, with Earthquake, while Expert Belt makes Flamethrower and Hidden Power Ice less weak against their most common targets. Just note that this Celesteela is much easier to KO than the defensive set.</p>"},

Naganadel can also be a bit difficult to set up against offensive teams due to this.</li> <li>Naganadel's bulk issue's also mean that it needs a team to be sufficently weakened, or it risks getting KOed.</li> <li>Naganadel's Special Attack stat is very good, but it can feel a bit weak without a boost, which can limit its effectiveness in the early parts of the game.</li> </ul>",

Fire Blast in particular will OHKO Aegislash after a boost, but Flamethrower's perfect accuracy can make it more reliable for late-game sweeps.</li> <li>If a team is desperate against Heatran and Stakataka, Hidden Power Ground can be used, but it usually isn't worth the loss in coverage against Ferrothorn and Celesteela.</li> <li>Dragonium Z is an excellent item for late-game sweeping and stallbreaking, letting Naganadel blast most defensive Pokemon with a +2 Devastating Drake. Just note that this item makes Naganadel often even more committed towards late-game sweeps.</li> <li>Focus Sash can leave Naganadel a bit weak, but it gives it a much easier time setting up Nasty Plot against offensive teams and can let Naganadel work as a solid revenge killer if Stealth Rock isn't up. Focus Sash also makes Naganadel easier to use early in the game.</li> <li>If Aegislash is a serious problem, Firium Z can be used to deal massive damage to Aegislash and Celesteela without needing a Special Attack boost, giving Naganadel another opportunity for boosting its Speed late-game via a KO.</li> <li>A Timid nature is highly recommended, as not only does it guarantee that Naganadel outspeeds Mega Salamence, it also ensures Beast Boost increases its Speed after a KO, preventing common Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Tapu Lele and Landorus-T from revenge killing Naganadel. A Modest nature can be used to boost Special Attack after a KO, but it requires much more support than Timid.</li> <li>The given EVs allow Naganadel to survive three uses of Chansey and Blissey's Seismic Toss, allowing Naganadel to set up three Nasty Plots more comfortably against stall teams. The Special Defense EVs ensure that Porygon2's Download will not boost its Special Attack. While difficult to get hold of, another option is to use Naganadel with 29 or 28 Defense IVs, which makes its Defense stat one point lower than its Special Defense stat, with an EV spread of 20 HP / 236 SpA / 252 Spe. This makes a minor difference in damage calculations overall, though.</li> <li>While Naganadel's excellent Speed tier makes it a good revenge killer, this set is for sweeping first and foremost, so it's best to keep this Naganadel for late-game if possible. Focus Sash variants are the exception, since they can surprise common setters of Stealth Rock such as Landorus-T.</li> <li>While Tapu Fini itself does poorly against Naganadel, its Misty Terrain will weaken Draco Meteor, which makes Naganadel easier to check, so consider running another Terrain setter to counteract this. Tapu Lele in particular is a good choice, since Psychic Terrain will block common priority attacks aimed at Naganadel, such as Ice Shard and Bullet Punch.</li> </ul>"

However, note that the Special Attack drop and the Choice lock can turn Naganadel into setup bait if it is used too early.</li> <li>A Fire-type attack is needed to punish Steel-type switch-ins. Fire Blast is usually the best for 2HKOing Aegislash, but Flamethrower's perfect accuracy makes it the more reliable option.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ground is a good choice for dealing severe damage to Heatran and Stakataka on the switch; however, U-turn is very useful early in the game for breaking Mimikyu's Disguise without staying in, and it also makes Naganadel a good scout.</li> <li>Timid is usually the best nature, as it ensures that Naganadel outspeeds Mega Salamence, and it is especially important on Choice Specs variants to get a Speed boost from Beast Boost.</li> <li>Modest is a reasonable alternative. While this does mean Naganadel will be unable to revenge kill Jolly +1 Mega Salamence, it does grant Naganadel a Special Attack boost with every KO, which can snowball into a surprise sweep.</li> <li>Carrying a Pokemon from the Tapu group is recommended to get rid of Misty Terrain, which weakens Draco Meteor.

The Water-type weakness is also rather prominent. This limits Stakataka's setup opportunities, even if it can survive some weak, non-STAB-boosted Earthquakes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Despite the huge weaknesses of Stakataka's typing, it can be useful for setting up against some major threats of Battle Spot Singles, with notable examples including Mimikyu, Tapu Lele, and Naganadel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Overall, Stakataka's home is on semi- and full Trick Room teams.

With Gyro Ball and 0 Speed IVs, Stakataka hits most offensive Pokemon for the full 150 Base Power.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you're using Rockium Z, Stone Edge is the Rock STAB attack of choice due to its stronger Z-Move. Otherwise, Rock Blast is highly recommended as Stakataka's secondary STAB attack. While it isn't as consistently powerful as Stone Edge, its multi-hit ability is extremely useful against Substitute Pokemon that may try to stall out Trick Room. It also hits Focus Sash Pokemon and Multiscale Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p>Earthquake gives Stakataka valuable coverage against opposing Steel-types, mainly Aegislash, Mega Metagross, and Heatran. Superpower leaves Stakataka walled by Aegislash, but it allows Stakataka to seriously damage Ferrothorn</p> </li> <li> <p>A big decision to make is which nature Stakataka will use. A Brave nature is the most reliable nature for setting up Trick Room. With maximum HP and 4 Defense EVs, Stakataka will survive Adamant Mega Salamence's Earthquake nearly all the time. The Defense boost after a KO can also make Stakataka very difficult to take down.</p> </li> <li> <p>If sweeping with Stakataka is of more importance, a Lonely nature with 16 or 17 Defense IVs can be used. This makes Stakataka's Defense stat the same as as its Attack stat, meaning that Beast Boost will boost Stakatakta's Attack stat instead of its Defense stat. This can make Stakataka a surprisingly fearsome sweeper when Trick Room is set up. However, the Defense drop makes Stakataka likely to be KOed by non-STAB Earthquakes, unlike Brave Stakataka.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rockium Z gives Stakataka a powerful STAB with Stone Edge-based Continental Crush, which is especially useful for hitting Water-types hard. Groundium Z is notable for OHKOing Mega Metagross and having a 75% chance of OHKOing Aegislash. Fightinium Z can also be used to avoid Superpower's stat drops and deal massive damage to Ferrothorn and Celesteela.</p> </li> <li> <p>Life Orb increases Stakataka's sweeping potential, especially when you're using a Lonely nature. However, the recoil compromises Stakataka's good bulk, making it even more committed towards sweeping under Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p>Air Balloon gives Stakataka one shot of switching into Earthquake, vastly increasing the number of Pokemon Stakataka can set Trick Room up on at the cost of easy sweeping power. Shuca Berry can also be used if one does not want to risk Air Balloon popping too soon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stakataka is bulky enough to usually barely survive non-STAB Earthquakes, so a super recovery Berry such as Iapapa can be used to give Stakataka a good amount of health back after surviving.</p> </li> <li> <p>While Stakataka is good at setting up Trick Room, it usually should not be the only user of it on its team due to its common weaknesses. Cresselia is a great partner to consider, since it can switch into Ground- and Fighting-type attacks with ease and can even use Lunar Dance to restore Staktakta's health for a sweep. Mimikyu is a more offensive alternative that happens to be immune to Fighting-type attacks. Mega Slowbro is also a reasonable option due to its massive physical bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although they can share checks, Tapu Bulu can work well with Stakataka, since Grassy Terrain will make Earthquake much easier to handle, and offensive Tapu Bulu appreciate Trick Room support.</p> </li> </ul>"

If using Stakataka on a dedicated Trick Room team, a Lonely nature with 16 or 17 Defense IVs can be used to boost Stakataka's Attack stat after a Beast Boost, but this greatly compromises Stakataka's ability to take non-STAB Earthquakes.</p> </li> <li> <p>This Stakataka can benefit from Trick Room support, though it does not need to be on a dedicated Trick Room team to function.  If Trick Room support is considered, Cresselia is an excellent partner, thanks to its ability to take Fighting- and Ground-type attacks easily and access to Lunar Dance to restore Stakataka at the right time for a sweep. Mimikyu is a great offensive alternative that can easily set up Trick Room due to Disguise, while Mega Slowbro provides a good mixture of bulk and offense.

It notably lacks Solar Beam, which is one of the best options for offensive Fire-types.</p> </li> <li> <p>A major restriction for Blacephalon is that Hidden Power Fighting is unobtainable, due to legendary Pokemon coming with a guaranteed 31 IVs in 3 stats.
