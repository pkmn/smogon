      "Screens Setter": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With the new Defense-boosting mechanic for Ice-types in snow, Alolan Ninetales is the premier screens setter in the current metagame, as well as being a decent check against fearsome physical attackers like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore can thwart bulkier setup foes that would otherwise take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's mediocre offenses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Blizzard versus Freeze-Dry</strong>: Blizzard's high Base Power helps make up for Alolan Ninetales's lack of power. Freeze-Dry is much less powerful but is more consistent at pressuring Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Basculegion-M.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pain Split</strong>: Pain Split punishes foes that assume Alolan Ninetales will simply allow revenge kills from slower Pokemon, giving it a new lease on life to check physical threats. This especially works well with Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Misty Terrain</strong>: Misty Terrain stops common users of status such as Yawn Ursaluna-B and Thunder Wave Porygon2 from having an impact, though it does weaken grounded Dragon-type teammates like Raging Bolt and Roaring Moon.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Thanks to its high Speed and increased physical bulk in snow, Alolan Ninetales does not normally want to Terastallize. It's true it can help with Steel-types moves from Scizor and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, but it is often more advisable to play around this weakness through its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a balanced defensive typing that completely flips Alolan Ninetales's Steel-type weakness, all but guaranteeing it can set Aurora Veil. It also lets it resist Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes—a common counter against screens—though Alolan Ninetales will normally survive it without Terastallizing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire can be used offensively and defensively against Steel-types, with invested Tera Blast usually OHKOing Scizor and 2HKOing Gholdengo. Do note though that this comes at the cost of having a dramatically worse Urshifu-R matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice lets Alolan Ninetales keep its Defense boost in snow while increasing its offensive output and making the devastating Steel weakness more manageable.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Light Clay</strong>: Light Clay extends Aurora Veil's duration and makes it much harder for the opponent to play around it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: If using a physically defensive EV spread, Rocky Helmet lets Alolan Ninetales severely punish Urshifu-R that lack Punching Glove.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash is good insurance against fast super effective hits, but it's overall less useful in the majority of matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p>Alolan Ninetales has a wide variety of possible EV spreads. If the examples below don't suit your needs, consider checking out some useful Speed and Defensive benchmarks later in this analysis to help create a custom EV spread!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 92 SpD / 172 Spe with Timid</strong>: This spread lets Alolan Ninetales outspeed up to Timid Iron Crown and Jolly Urshifu formes while surviving Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera-boosted Moonblast on all but the highest damage roll.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 76 Def / 4 SpA / 116 SpD / 84 Spe with Timid</strong>: With this investment in bulk, Alolan Ninetales survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera Fairy Moonblast, as well as avoiding an OHKO from Ogerpon-H's super effective Ivy Cudgel while the weather is still snow. The Speed investment lets Alolan Ninetales outrun Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 140 SpD / 188 Spe with Timid</strong>: This spread sacrifices some physical bulk in exchange for outspeeding Timid Chi-Yu and almost always survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera-boosted Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 244 Def / 84 Spe with Timid</strong>: This physically bulky spread avoids a 2HKO from Adamant Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes while outspeeding up to Modest Chi-Yu. It also avoids an OHKO from Scizor's unboosted Bullet Punch on all but the highest damage roll.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>A unique combination of Intimidate, Extreme Speed and multiple support tools make Arcanine a versatile and unpredictable defensive option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extreme Speed</strong>: Even on a defensive set, Extreme Speed's strong base power and priority combined with Arcanine's naturally high Attack make it a potent cleaning tool.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roar</strong>: Roar lets Arcanine phaze out troublesome set-up foes that are hard for teammates to switch into, such as Wo-Chien and Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: Bulldoze's speed control can be used to set up your own offense for a countersweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: After Intimidate, the given EV spread lets Arcanine avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Chien-Pao's Crunch and Baxcalibur's Earthquake. The HP investment minimizes Stealth Rock damage when not running Heavy-Duty Boots, and the Speed investment outspeeds Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Snarl</strong>: This move lets Arcanine pester special attackers that switch into it, potentially letting it stay in longer or ease a switch to a teammate.</li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: As a defensive switch-in with a Stealth Rock weakness, Arcanine heavily favors Heavy-Duty Boots to remove said weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Against targets like Chien-Pao, Arcanine can rack up passive chip damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Passive recovery is a valuable asset to have on a defensive Pokemon, but since Arcanine is an Intimidate user that switches a lot, Leftovers doesn't always have enough turns to produce good value.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization can do a lot to further improve Arcanine's unique set of attributes, but it's not necessarily something that Arcanine needs to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal gives Arcanine even more cleaning power by boosting Extreme Speed. It's also a nice pinch option for blocking Ghost-type moves, as Flutter Mane and Mimikyu are often forced to use them due to Arcanine's Fairy resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy provides defensive insurance against some of the hardest hitting Choice Band users, such as Tera Dark Chien-Pao and Outrage Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Shell Smash and Skill Link more than make up for Cloyster's weak Attack stat, making it a formidable sweeper that Focus Sash and Mimikyu can't easily stop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Priority may seem like overkill, but it helps pick off weakened threats without setup. It also gets around priority attacks from Breloom, Dragapult, and Meowscarada after a Shell Smash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Blast</strong>: This is Closyer's best shot at dealing with the many Tera Fires that resist Icicle Spear, as well as OHKOing Chien-Pao, Iron Bundle, and Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drill Run</strong>: This hits Gholdengo and other Steel-types hard without needing to Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the preferred nature to maximize offensive power, as a single Shell Smash lets you outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. However, Cloyster is in the same speed tier as Breloom, so Jolly is a consideration if you want to minimize Speed tie scenarios in that matchup.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: As a Focus Sash user, Cloyster wants to avoid using Tera when possible, but opposing priority attacks and defensive typings can sometimes make it a necessity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Since Cloyster will often be at extremely low health after Shell Smash, Tera Ghost helps it avoid getting revenge killed by Breloom's Mach Punch and Dragonite’s Extreme Speed. It also provides coverage against Gholdengo with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: The increased damage from Tera Ice makes it very difficult for Pokemon to wall Cloyster without resisting it, with even Corviknight getting OHKOed by +2 Adamant Icicle Spear after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Volt Switch users like Rotom-W love to take Cloyster down to its Focus Sash and pivot to a priority attacker; Tera Ground both nullifies the damage and prevents the switch, giving Cloyster significant momentum with a free turn to Shell Smash. It also lets Cloyster challenge defensive Gholdengo, blocking Thunder Wave and giving +2 Adamant Drill Run a strong chance to OHKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: While Tera Fire Tera Blast actually does less damage to Corviknight than Tera Ice Icicle Spear, Tera Fire otherwise helps Cloyster muscle past Steel-types it traditionally struggles to beat, such as Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal is a niche option that offers no offensive benefits to Cloyster, but it does prevent Mimikyu and Gallade from revenge killing it with Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Considering Cloyster's paper-thin Special Defense, Focus Sash gives Cloyster by far the most setup opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>King's Rock</strong>: King's Rock is a risky option that doesn’t help Cloyster set up, but it does give Icicle Spear and Rock Blast a 41% chance of flinching.</p> </li> </ul>"

It can give free setup when paired with Dragon Dance, or it can turn Dragonite into a long-term defensive disruptor when paired with Roost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: This set benefits immensely from the ability to Terastallize to both boost Extreme Speed's power while also removing Dragon type weaknesses.

Roar</strong>: Dragon Tail is preferred for it disregarding Taunt and providing some good chip damage. However, Roar can phaze out meddlesome Fairy-types and users of Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Teammates</strong>: For this Dragonite to be at its most effective, you'll need some partners to at least set up Stealth Rock. Ting-Lu and Archaludon are particularly bulky examples that pair well, but other options include Landorus-T, Swampert, and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake VS. Iron Head</strong>: Earthquake is the most wide-reaching coverage move, ensuring good damage against Normal resistances like Garganacl and Archaludon. If using Roar, Iron Head prevents Levitate Pokemon from completely walling Dragonite, and its flinch rate synergies well with Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Dragonite's bulk makes it an ace at spreading paralysis, making it more of a team supporter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute versus Encore</strong>: Substitute is a fantastic option against Pokemon with status moves that threaten Dragonite's phazing cycles, such as Garganacl, Porygon2, and Toxapex. Encore won't do as well against these threats but does punish opposing foes carrying Substitute that can be a problem for Dragon Tail along with slower foes that use status moves in general such as Ting-Lu and Ursaluna-B. Encore can even be used over extra coverage if teammates can deal with Fairy-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extreme Speed versus Aqua Jet</strong>: Extreme Speed's ability to pick off threats is useful, even on defensive variants of this set. Despite being half as powerful, Aqua Jet is still worth considering for its ability to pick off weakened Flutter Mane, which can be difficult for this set to handle due to its power when Multiscale isn't in play.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is a high value item, but it's worth using on Dragonite if using Substitute, as it gives Dragonite a serious chance of passively gaining Multiscale's effect back.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet allows Dragonite to play more passively, punishing Pokemon that rely on contact moves like Choice Item Urshifu-R and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots' Stealth Rock immunity makes Multiscale more flexible, especially if Dragon Tail brings in a threat Dragonite isn't equipped to handle.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread gives up quite a bit of bulk in exchange for outspeeding Adamant Breloom, while still often mantaining a Substitute against Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 124 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is optimized for use with Earthquake and Aqua Jet, allowing Dragonite to 2HKO 4 Defense Flutter Mane with that combination of moves without needing to Terastallize. Only Modest Tera Fairy Flutter Mane will have a chance to OHKO through Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is a far more offensive approach, mainly for use with Extreme Speed to pick off threats more effectively.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragonite's defensive typing can be quite helpful against foes like Urshifu-R and Chi-Yu, but some of the huge exploitable weaknesses to Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane will require Terastallization to cover.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dragon immunity gels well with Dragonite and is a great defensive typing in general against foes like Chien-Pao and Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is not only an incredible defensive typing that covers much of Dragonite's former weaknesses, but the power boost it provides to Iron Head lets it OHKO all but the most bulky Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal isn't that incredible defensively, but it can be worth it for boosting Extreme Speed's power, letting offensive EV spreads 2HKO Chien-Pao with it.</p> </li> </ul>"

Air Slash also does not trigger Rocky Helmet and is naturally boosted by Dragonite's STAB. The Iron Head variant of Paraflinch, however, gives Dragonite an easier time against a number of common threats such as Flutter Mane, at the cost of struggling against Gouging Fire before they Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore vs. Substitute</strong>: Encore will allow Dragonite to effectively check a wider variety of Pokemon such as Ursaluna-B by locking them into an unfavorable move, giving it a free opportunity to land Thunder Wave on your opponent's switch-in on the following turn.

Against either option, Encore can turn Dragonite practically invincible allowing it to reside on the field indefinitely in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire Spin</strong>: This allows Dragonite to defeat almost any Pokemon universally by simply making full use of its longevity. Trapping an Encore locked Pokemon in the field is also highly valuable. Fire Spin is used instead of Wrap because it affects Ghost-types and doesn't trigger chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Iron Head</strong>: Earthquake prevents Dragonite from being entirely passive against Archaludon, Gouging Fire, and Flutter Mane. Meanwhile, Iron Head fits using Tera Steel, and does massive damage to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor</strong>: With a Bold Nature, Draco Meteor is a powerful move that can catch opposing Dragon-types off-guard and deal big damage to Ursaluna-B and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Heavy-Duty Boots</strong> Generally, Leftovers preserves Dragonite’'s longevity best, as it cancels out the damage from Sandstorm and makes timer stall easier.

Low Kick trades smacking Gholdengo for revenge killing opposing Tera Normal Dragonite and dealing massive damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the best nature for needing less chip damage to revenge kill weakened targets with priority attacks, but Jolly can make sense if outspeeding foes like Modest Gholdengo, Adamant Gouging Fire, and the rare Jolly Breloom is appealing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Almost Required</strong>: This set is highly reliant on using Tera Blast as a luring tool, so Terastallization should be a top priority for Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sharp Beak</strong>: Sharp Beak gives Dragonite the most offensive presence with the fewest drawbacks, giving Flying-type Tera Blast just enough of a boost to usually 2HKO Ursaluna-B, or 3HKO defensive variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest vastly improves Dragonite's matchup against Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane, especially if Multiscale's protection has been lost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots means Stealth Rock will no longer remove this set's ability to trade blows with powerful threats.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>While giving up Extreme Speed and Scale Shot may seem unusual, it allows Dragonite to use both Multiscale and the unpredictability of Terastallization to become an extremely dangerous bulky sweeper that teams often have the wrong response to!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roost</strong>: Despite this set's more offensive approach, Roost is still highly recommended for taking full advantage of Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: Iron Head is a good choice if using Tera Steel, but even outside of that, it offers much more damage against Flutter Mane and common Tera Fairy foes like Raging Bolt and Toxapex than Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Outrage</strong>: Outrage has tremendous power compared to any other attack from Dragonite, but Flutter Mane flipping it into a chance to revenge kill means it's best to lock-in late-game when the sweeping shot is clear.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Ice Spinner works best with Clear Amulet, making sure Landorus-T and Dragonite are easy to break through before they Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is usually preferred for the extra damage output, and the given EV spread still outspeeds Adamant Chien-Pao after a Dragon Dance. Jolly is required for outspeeding Timid Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle though.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire Punch</strong>: Fire Punch is handy for roasting Scizor and dealing good damage to Corviknight, but it can't replace Earthquake, since hitting Archaludon hard is extremely important.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Punch</strong>: If using Tera Electric, Thunder Punch is a less risky alternative to Tera Blast in exchange for getting hit by Rocky Helmet. It's best used with Ice Spinner over Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Low Kick</strong>: Low Kick is an easy way to OHKO Chien-Pao compared to Earthquake, but Flutter Mane laughing at it means Iron Head becomes required coverage, and it does less damage to Archaludon than Earthquake.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Clear Amulet</strong>: Clear Amulet protects Dragonite from Pokemon that can ruin its sweep with Attack debuffs, such as Landorus-T and Charm Flutter Mane, as well as Breaking Swipe users like Gouging Fire and opposing Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry is an effective way around common status spreaders like Flutter Mane, Archaludon, and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Stealth Rock won't break Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: If using Roost, Rocky Helmet is a good way of punishing Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes if it lacks Punching Glove or if switching into Aqua Jet.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High / Medium</strong>: If making use of Tera Blast for Tera types like Flying, Dragonite will usually want to Terastallize as much as possible. Without Tera Blast, it becomes less necessary, but it's still often worth doing due to it making Dragonite a nightmare to OHKO!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Blast Flying offers incredible power with no drawbacks outside of Terastallizing, making it a great choice for sweeping!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a more defensive approach to this set, covering Dragonite's common weaknesses to Fairy, Dragon, and Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: When combined with Clear Amulet, Tera Ground gives Dragonite the tools to defeat common support Flutter Mane moves like Thunder Wave and Charm in addition to a powerful Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric works great with Ice Spinner covering Landorus-T, giving Dragonite another way to soak up Thunder Wave and even Serperior's Glare!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy isn't as great defensively for Dragonite as Tera Steel, but the Dragon immunity is great for keeping Multiscale intact, and it makes Dragonite a good check against Urshifu-S.</p> </li> </ul>"

When boosted by Belly Drum, Liquidation is fully capable of punching through bulky Steel-types—like Corviknight—that Play Rough can't.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore can create an opening to use Belly Drum against slower, more passive foes, such as Ting-Lu, though the decreased offensive coverage can hurt in the long run.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Belly Drum Usage</strong>: While finding a safe opportunity to use Belly Drum can be tough, Azumarill can cushion hits well from and set up on popular sweepers like Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, given that they don't have a Tera type that counters Azumarill. Azumarill can still hit hard even without Belly Drum, so don't force it if the situation looks too dangerous.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong> : 244 HP EVs are used to give Azumarill an even HP number, guaranteeing that Sitrus Berry activates after Belly Drum. The extra EVs are put into Speed to prevent Speed ties with opposing 4 Speed Azumarill.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Belly Drum is inherently risky; smart Tera usage can cushion an attack during setup or provide a stronger coverage option when Belly Drum simply isn't viable to use.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water combined with Belly Drum gives Aqua Jet nightmarish power. After Stealth Rock chip, it can even OHKO Iron Bundle!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire blocks Will-O-Wisp, and the Tera Blast coverage can hit Steel-types like Scizor and Corviknight hard even without Belly Drum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass turns both Grass- and Electric-type weaknesses into resistances, and when combined with Tera Blast, it makes dealing with Unaware Dondozo and Rotom-W much easier. It can also be used to block Spore and set up Belly Drum for free, but this must be done with discretion, as Spore users like Loaded Dice Breloom may just attack and leave Azumarill heavily wounded after Belly Drum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric with Tera Blast is Azumarill's best option to beat Toxapex, and it still deals big damage to Unaware Dondozo and Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul>"

In particular, it punishes Dragon Dance from Lum Berry Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Wish and Protect</strong>: Wish + Protect provides excellent recovery opportunies for both Umbreon and its teammates. With Leftovers's animation as well, its great at stalling out the timer. Protect also scouts for U-turn and Tera.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yawn</strong>: Yawn's ability to force switches generates extra Leftovers recovery and generates momentum for its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Thunder Wave has excellent synergy with Wish.

Thief does offer more consistent damage than Knock Off though, thanks to Technician.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dual Wingbeat</strong>: Dual Wingbeat is Scizor's best option against Ogerpon-H as well Fighting-types like Annihilape and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat is Scizor's best option to hit opposing Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu as well as Steel types, even when using defensive EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf is a shocking twist against Ogerpon-H and Urshifu formes to launch off a strong Dual Wingbeat, but this does mean Scizor's bulk is heavily compromised against the threats it usually checks, like Flutter Mane.</li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: While much less immediately threatening than Choice Band, Assault Vest lets Scizor more comfortably switch into stray special attacks like Gholdengo's and Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball or Rotom-W's Volt Switch, improving its longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band lets Scizor function as a scary late-game cleaner, especially with Tera Steel-boosted Bullet Punch. The high damage output also helps Scizor to break down walls for its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is perfect for more defensive Scizor, letting it continually switch into weaker physical attacks and wear down the team with U-turn and residual damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 92 Atk / 164 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This spread is meant to be used with Assault Vest, letting Scizor almost always avoid a 2HKO from Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball. It also maintains enough Attack investment to always OHKO uninvested Chien-Pao after Stealth Rock chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 68 Atk / 204 Def with Adamant</strong>: This spread avoids an OHKO from Tera Dark Life Orb Chien-Pao, is not 2HKOed by Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast, and reduces the amount of residual damage Scizor receives thanks to the HP stat being 1 lower than divisible by 16.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 68 Atk / 204 Def with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread lets Scizor survive +2 Life Orb Adamant Tera Ghost Mimikyu's Shadow Claw.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Defensive Scizor might seem strange, but when paired with Rocky Helmet, it becomes an effective pivot that can survive extreme attacks: it avoids the OHKO from Choice Band Tera Dark Chien-Pao's Crunch as well as the 2HKO from Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake. Just note that this will make Scizor focus more on pivoting than revenge killing with Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave or Relaxed with a Speed IV of 8 or 9</strong>: This Speed IV can be used to use U-turn after some Hippowdon use Yawn, but still outspeed Ting-Lu. Note that being slower than Ursaluna-B can be troublesome.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can be quite helpful in either cleaning teams or preparing against Scizor's classic Fire-type issues, the power of its priority and pivoting don't make it needed for it to function consistently.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water turns its Fire weakness into a resistance, giving Scizor a fighting chance against dangerous Fire-types such as Chi-Yu, Gouging Fire, and Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is ideal for more offensive Scizor variants, making Bullet Punch an even better cleaning tool. Tera Steel also softens Scizor's weakness to Fire, letting it avoid the OHKO from attacks like Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire is a great response most Ogerpon-H sets, and shields Scizor from burns that foes like Entei like to deal out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Increasing Dual Wingbeat's power with Terastallization nets Scizor some useful new OHKOs against offensive Urshifu formes and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: While not an incredible defensive typing, Tera Dragon is fantastic against most Fire and Water Pokemon that give Scizor trouble, with Ogerpon formes being a particularly prominent example. As a downside though, it harms Scizor's ability to check Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul>"

With Sitrus Berry, Modest Gholdengo's Shadow Ball is also no longer a 2HKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 124 Atk / 156 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized spread avoids a 2HKO from Jolly Chien-Pao's Crunch, Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, and Modest Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 28 Atk / 204 Def / 20 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread avoids the OHKO from Adamant Tera Ghost Life Orb Mimikyu's +2 Shadow Claw.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The old reliable special wall is still viable, but it now takes a more active role through the use of Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: Flamethrower is great at hitting Tera Steel users like Latios that are commonly employed against stall teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Alluring Voice</strong>: Alluring Voice catches targets trying to set up alongside Blissey, confusing them if they boosted their stats in the same turn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling with Poison Barb</strong>: Fling with Poison Barb gives Blissey a one-time opportunity to poison foes, and is preferred over Toxic Orb since it doesn't poison Blissey itself prior to being thrown. Fling also gets rid of Choice items from Trick users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock remains a trusty support move for Blissey, punishing teams that are forced to switch around Blissey and its teammates.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Shadow Ball can deal good damage to special Ghost-type sweepers like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo. However, Blissey will no longer be able to reliably hit Ursaluna-B, which is a matchup Blissey is normally expected to handle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling with Flame Orb or Toxic Orb</strong>: This is as close as it gets to Blissey regaining Toxic, though getting burned or badly poisoned is devestating if Blissey is the last Pokemon around, making it a risky option.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Blissey is known for shrugging off big special hits with ease. However, its presence at team preview often attracts hard counters, and Tera is one way of dealing with that.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel Tera resists the STAB attacks of Latios and Archuladon while also granting a Fairy resistance for the Flutter Mane matchup. It also prevents poison, which can otherwise force Blissey to switch out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Dark Tera completely ruins Latios's attempts to break through Blissey with Stored Power or Psychic Noise, at least forcing a Calm Mind war. However, Blissey becomes much more vulnerable to Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: The Fighting-type immunity comes in handy for Blissey and prevents it from being trapped, though it does become more vulnerable to Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water puts the brakes on Choice Specs Tera Fire Chi-Yu’s wallbreaking parade, ruining its ability to reliably 2HKO Blissey.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Poison Barb</strong>: Poison Barb complements Fling, letting Blissey use poison to outlast targets that can't heal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak grants a huge immunity to the healing block of Psychic Noise. Beyond that, it is also fantastic for blocking the passive damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure, flinches from Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse, and Special Defense drops from Latios's Luster Purge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: As is the case with most walls, Leftovers’ passive recovery is a great supplement to Softboiled and helps Blissey be less passive itself.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with Calm or Bold</strong>: Beyond making Tera Blissey that much harder to break by foes like Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu, going all-in on Special Defense means less frequent Softboiled uses against special attackers, especially with Leftovers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spd with Bold</strong>: Maximizing both HP and Defense gives Blissey a little extra boost in physical bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

Trailblaze</strong>: Tera Blast Grass has a chance of OHKOing offensive Primarina, OHKOes Swampert, and deals massive damage to Urshifu-R. Trailblaze misses out on these KOes, but the Speed boost can lead to easier sweeping late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze VS. Stomping Tantrum</strong>: Bulldoze is both a way to deal decent damage to opposing Fire-types and a useful support move with its Speed drop. Stomping Tantrum offers a bit more power and can match Sacred Fire in power if Entei misses an attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Crunch</strong>: Crunch is Entei's best coverage option for Latios and Latias.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Iron Head</strong>: Iron Head does a bit of extra damage against Flutter Mane but has limited use otherwise.</li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 244 Atk / 84 Def / 12 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread avoids an OHKO from Adamant Chien-Pao's Tera-boosted Crunch after Stealth Rock damage and a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball without Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>132 HP / 228 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 140 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This spread spread lets Entei outspeed Iron Bundle after using Trailblaze or Bulldoze while only having a 2% chance of being 2HKOed by Choice Specs Timid Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 HP / 132 Atk / 156 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This physically defensive spread survives Tera Dark Choice Band Adamant Chien-Pao's Crunch while still dodging a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball without Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 116 Atk / 4 Def / 252 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This specially defensive spread dodges a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane even when with Stealth Rock!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 236 Atk / 4 Def / 76 SpD / 188 Spe with with Jolly</strong>: This speedy and frailer spread outspeeds all Landorus-T that lack Choice Scarf while still having enough special bulk to almost always avoid a 2HKO Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Entei's Fairy resistance is a big selling point as an Assault Vest Pokemon, but Terastallization can help with some of its poor matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass helps Entei with Water-types like Primarina and offensive Urshifu-R. Just note that Suicune and Bulk Up Urshifu-R avoid a 2HKO from Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While this Entei doesn't have enough firepower to sweep until late-game, boosting Extreme Speed is still helpful in this regard. It can also save Entei from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy isn't as helpful against bulky Water-types, but it makes Urshifu-S and Choice Band Chien-Pao much more manageable and surprises Gouging Fire that may attempt to set up with Breaking Swipe and Dragon Dance.</p> </li> </ul>"

Grass Tera Blast</strong>: Trailblaze does decent damage to offensive Water-types and lets Entei outspeed the troublesome Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, but Tera Blast is needed to break through bulky Water-types like Suicune.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swagger and Mirror Herb</strong>: This is the closest Entei gets to setting up, giving Entei the chance to pull off a shocking sweep and even be a nuisance with confusion! Outside of Swagger, Mirror Herb can be used for some risky switch-ins to punish setup moves with a boosted Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly VS.

It also has good synergy with Mirror Coat and the less common Counter.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Swampert has excellent bulk and only a single weakness, but opponents will often try to exploit that weakness, often making Terastallization necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire grants a superb defensive typing. Not only does it flip the script on powerful Grass-types like Ogerpon-H and Rillaboom, but its Fairy resistance makes dealing with Flutter Mane much easier.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison covers up Swampert's massive Grass weakness while allowing it to neutralize Toxic and Toxic Spikes throughout the match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel's Dragon resistance can be pivotal for standing in the way of sweepers like Scale Shot Dragonite, giving Swampert an opening to use Yawn or Roar against them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water makes it so that not even Tera Water Choice Band Urshifu-R can 2HKO Sitrus Berry Swampert.

Tera boosted Mystical Fire will also 2HKO maximum HP Kingambit without Assault Vest.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy can patch up this set's lacking power by boosting Moonblast, and the removal of Gardevoir's Psychic typing makes dealing with opposing Ghost-types like Flutter Mane and Mimikyu more manageable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal's defensive attributes are lacking overall, but nullifying a key Ghost-type attack from the likes of Flutter Mane and Mimikyu can give an opening to deal extra damage or inflict a crucial burn.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p>The spreads listed below all have an even HP stat to guarantee that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination. All spreads are also capable of surviving one unboosted Shadow Ball from Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 244 Def / 20 Spe</strong>: Near maximum HP and Defense gives Gardevoir fantastic defensive calcs; after Sitrus Berry recovery and inflicting a turn 1 burn, Gardevoir has a strong chance of avoiding the 3HKO from Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and Assault Vest Ting-Lu's Heavy Slam. The Speed investment outspeeds maximum Speed Adamant Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 204 Def / 60 Spe</strong>: A little extra Speed investment lets Gardevoir outspeed defensive Gholdengo with 20 Speed EVs, but Gardevoir is much less likely to avoid the 3HKOs mentioned in the main spread.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Since it can sleep foes without restriction, Breloom is a monstrous foe that applies serious pressure at Team Preview!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: This is Breloom's best option against Gholdengo and provides valuable speed control.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spore</strong>: As good as Spore is, it's well prepared for enough by threats such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Lum Berry that going without it can make sense.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb provides a form of speed control that can't be walled by Flying-types like Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat lets Breloom muscle past bulkier threats more easily, such as Wo-Chien.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: While Breloom can certainly take advantage of Terastallization, Focus Sash variants are used fairly early in the game and often don't need it. Loaded Dice Breloom, however, does like Terastallization covering up its iffy defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: With Tera Blast, Tera Fire provides an alternative way to get past Gholdengo, avoids getting burned by other foes, and gives bulkier Breloom a chance against Flutter Mane and Focus Sash Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a good choice for picking off foes more easily with Mach Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Bullet Seed's boost from Tera Grass means it will OHKO Chien-Pao through its Focus Sash if Breloom rolls at least three hits.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Besides boosting Rock Tomb's damage output, Tera Rock prevents Sandstorm from breaking Breloom's Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground-boosted Bulldoze has a 93.8% chance to OHKO 4 HP Gholdengo, making Breloom a situational lure. It also severely punishes Rotom-W that attempt to Volt Switch out, and Hippowdon that don't Terastallize.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Since Breloom's bulk isn't very good, Focus Sash is the most reliable way to fire off Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: Guaranteeing 4 hits from Bullet Seed can be quite useful for bulkier Breloom sets, clinching an OHKO on Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Iron Bundle regardless of them running Substitute or Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe</strong>: If using Focus Sash, maximizing Speed is important to deal with slower foes that might invest in Speed, such as Corviknight and Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 180 Atk / 76 SpD</strong>: This bulkier spread makes sense if using Loaded Dice and Swords Dance, letting Breloom survive one hit from Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, or Choice Specs Flutter Mane with the correct Tera type.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Poison Heal, Breloom can act as a pivot versus defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo and Umbreon as it is unaffected by Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p>This set can catch opponents expecting the more popular Focus Sash set off guard. However, do note that this set is very susceptible to Taunt and Encore, which can make it difficult to even select Breloom in the team preview phase.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect gives Breloom an opportunity to scout out its opponents and further stall them out once Leech Seed has been set up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Timer Stalling</strong>: If you obtain a numerical advantage early in the match, you can utilize Breloom to win on timer. This is particularly effective since the Leech Seed damage happens after recovery from Leftovers and Poison Heal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: Bulldoze allows Breloom to further support its teammates and threaten Gholdengo, which likes to absorb status moves. Do be wary that many Gholdengo are Tera Flying, which can render Breloom ineffective versus it.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic can be difficult to fit into the set, but it allows Breloom to punish Tera Grass foes that attempt to circumvent Breloom's Spore and Leech Seed.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: While Breloom's typing does have some useful resistances, its low bulk means more favorable resistances granted by Terastallization can be key to setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: This defensive Tera type allows Breloom to resist Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear and Skeledirge's Torch Song, both of which are threats to Substitute. It also helps against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, though note that Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Tera Fire Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: This Tera type allows Breloom to resist Ice- and Fire-type attacks while also providing Breloom with a Fairy-type resistance. With Toxic, Breloom is able to fight back against common Grass-type switch-ins. However, this type has more weaknesses when compared to Water.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread allows for maximum physical bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>156 HP / 100 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread allows for maximum Speed and can survive a Choice Band Extreme Speed from Tera Normal Dragonite after Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>204 HP / 164 Def / 140 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread hits a Speed stat of 108 which ties 4 Spe Adamant Baxcalibur. Furthermore, the defensive investment means that after Terastallization, Breloom's Substitute has a high chance of surviving three hits from Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear.</p> </li> </ul>"

Along with its decent bulk, Thick Fat gives it key resistances to Fire- and Ice-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bullet Punch</strong>: Bullet Punch provides Hariyama with a non-situational priority move that can grab KOs on weakened targets, and, when boosted by Tera Steel, turn the tides against Fairy-type opponents such as Flutter Mane and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fake Out versus Knock Off</strong>: Fake Out gives Hariyama another source of priority, and it can even be used to scout for Covert Cloak users if the opponent doesn't get flinched by it. Knock Off cripples switch-ins by removing their items; however, it can't remove a Booster Energy from an opponent with the Protosynthesis or Quark Drive in Sun or Electric Terrain, respectively, as it's consumed before Hariyama gets to move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Drain Punch</strong>: Close Combat is the stronger move but at the cost of cutting into Hariyama's bulk with each use. Drain Punch can fail to get a 2HKO on specially defensive Ting-Lu more than 90% of the time, but it provides Hariyama with some recovery, bolstering its bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Headlong Rush</strong>: Headlong Rush drops Hariyama's defenses with each use, but it 2HKOes defensive Toxapex and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch gives Hariyama a strong option to hit Dragonite with and can catch it by surprise, considering it isn't pressured to Terastallize against Hariyama's other moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: Heavy Slam, coupled with Tera Steel, provides Hariyama with a strong move against lightweight foes such as Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, Mimikyu, and Terastallized Iron Moth and Volcarona that doesn't drop its defenses.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Hariyama can work without Terastallization, it can provide an extra kick to its coverage or improve its defensive presence against certain threats.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel Tera gives Hariyama STAB on Bullet Punch, a resistance to Fairy, Psychic, and Steel, and an immunity to Poison, greatly improving its matchup against Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, Psychic Chi-Yu, Gholdengo, and Tera Fairy Iron Moth and Volcarona. Thanks to Thick Fat, it can take on non-Choice Specs variants of Chi-Yu even after Terastallizing if it's kept healthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Besides the burn immunity, Tera Fire capitalizes on Hariyama's Thick Fat, discouraging threats like Tera Fire Chi-Yu and Choice Band Chien-Pao from using their most powerful moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: While Tera Fighting doesn't provide anything defensively for Hariyama, it makes Close Combat a force to be reckoned with.</p> </li> </ul>"

Drain Punch is weaker, but the recovery can help offset the burn damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Headlong Rush</strong>: Earthquake complements Hariyama's coverage nicely, hitting Poison-types that resist Close Combat. Headlong Rush is stronger, but comes with the drawbacks of lowering defenses and being a contact move, triggering Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch is Hariyama's best hope of hitting Dragonite, as it doesn't fear much from Hariyama's other moves.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Terastallization gives a much appreciated boost to Bullet Punch, but it isn't necessary on every match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Terastallizing into the Steel-type turns Hariyama's Fairy and Psychic weaknesses into resistances along with giving STAB to Bullet Punch.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Latios's useful array of resistances, fantastic use of Terastallization, and good offenses make it a strong choice for either a wallbreaker with Choice Specs or revenge killer with Choice Scarf!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Luster Purge</strong>: Despite its low PP and poor offensive coverage, Luster Purge's high chance of dropping Special Defense still makes it a great wallbreaking tool.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn</strong>: While Flip Turn is weak, Latios forces enough switches to make it a reasonable offensive pivot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick gives Choice Scarf Latios an option to nearly shut down defensive Pokemon like Porygon2 and Ting-Lu and situationally lock offensive foes like Dragonite and Chien-Pao into more manageable moves. Choice Specs Latios isn't quite as effective with this, but its it's still worth considering for crippling defensive foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball VS. Aura Sphere</strong>: Shadow Ball is Latios's best move against Gholdengo and will 2HKO most Flutter Mane sets as well. Aura Sphere leaves Latios reliant on Special Defense drops to deal with Gholdengo, but it is a more direct option against common Tera Steel foes like Dragonite and opposing Latios.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: While not a defensive set, Calm Mind is a reasonable option for boosting Draco Meteor and Luster Purge to dangerous power levels.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Beam</strong>: Ice Beam is handy for letting Choice Specs Latios OHKO Assault Vest Landorus-T and deal massive damage to Ting-Lu, though Draco Meteor has more general utility in many cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Knot</strong>: If using Choice Specs, Grass Knot pulls a 2HKO even on Sitrus Berry Ting-Lu, though it being resisted by so many popular Pokemon like Dragonite makes it a risky move to be locked into.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Surf</strong>: If using Tera Water, Surf is a reasonable coverage option against Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt offers good coverage against most Steel-types, but it is a very risky move to be locked into due to Ground-types like Landorus-T and Excadrill.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Latios's typing isn't amazing defensively, but the very useful resistances to Urshifu-R's and Ogerpon-H's STAB moves mean Terastallization isn't always an upgrade. Still, thanks to Levitate, Latios has some effective defensive options to consider.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has superb synergy with Levitate, making Latios an effective offensive check against common foes like Landorus-T and Dragonite while giving Latios great counterplay against Fairy-types like Flutter Mane defensively and offensively with Tera Blast. This also lets Latios tank a Blood Moon from Ursaluna-B, though the Vacuum Wave weakness can be bothersome afterwards.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire also gives Latios a vital resistance to Fairy-types while maintaining the resistances against Ogerpon-H's STAB moves and providing a powerful Tera Blast against most Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water covers Latios's issue with Ice-type attacks, which can save it in a pinch against Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, while still retaining an important resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric removes all of Latios's weaknesses except from Mold Breaker users with Earthquake like Excadrill and provides a useful paralysis immunity against common status spreaders like Porygon2, Flutter Mane, and Serperior.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a decent alternative to Tera Steel, giving Latios a good option against Dragon-types while still retaining a Fighting-type resistance.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs VS. Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Specs is preferred on Latios for the excellent wallbreaking potential. Choice Scarf Latios is a reasonable revenge killer, but it still doesn't deal well with Chien-Pao due to the Sucker Punch weakness, making it more reliant on unique qualities like Trick and Levitate to separate itself from other Choice Scarf revenge killers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Soul Dew</strong>: While not as effective at breaking walls as Choice Specs, Soul Dew is a reasonable alternative to still take advantage of Luster Purge's Special Defense drops, and it is a great way of getting around Item Clause issues if Latios still needs a power boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Latios isn't frail, but Focus Sash lets it threaten offensive threats it normally has no bussiness with, such as Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Neutral Nature</strong>: It's best to use a neutral nature with a Timid Mint to ensure that Latios can eat any berry without getting confused after using Trick.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Empoleon's fantastic typing and good movepool make it a great choice for a specially defensive Stealth Rock setter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yawn versus Roar</strong>: Yawn has fantastic synergy with Stealth Rock, forcing foes to either take damage or be put to Sleep. Roar is more reliant on Stealth Rock being set up first, but it isn't as vulnerable to common Substitute foes like Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flash Cannon versus Ice Beam</strong>: Flash Cannon is the preferred STAB move for dealing good damage to Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle. Ice Beam is still worth considering for dealing far more damage to Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn versus Surf</strong>: Flip Turn makes Empoleon a good pivot despite its low damage output, though Surf is still a reasonable alternative for doing good damage against Ground-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roost</strong>: Despite Empoleon's good defensive profile, Roost can be hard to fit in since it means either giving up support or coverage. Still, it does make Empoleon a better check with Flutter Mane when paired with Flash Cannon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm versus Sassy</strong>: In addition to making Flip Turn stronger, Sassy's lower Speed can help Empoleon pivot out last. However, Sassy forces a Speed tie with 4 Speed EV Ursaluna-B unless 20 Speed EVs are used. If the power drop isn't an issue, a Calm nature with a Speed IV of 17 can be used to reach the same Speed.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Empoleon's superb typing means Terastallization should only be used to flip certain troublesome match-ups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying floats above common Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ursaluna-B, and it additionally grants an important Fighting-type resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a good response against Fighting-types like Urshifu while making Electric-types such as Zapdos and Vikavolt less problematic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: In addition to a Ground-type resistance (though this can be risky against Landorus-T), Tera Grass saves Empoleon from Breloom's Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Bug isn't normally a great defensive type, but the resistances to Fighting and Ground, combined with not being weak to Electric, makes it a viable choice on Empoleon.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is the most reliable healing item, especially when getting free turns with Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry's quick burst of recovery is a decent alternative to Leftovers. Make sure to use 244 HP EVs with it so it activates after getting hit by Ting-Lu's Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: Empoleon is an especially effective user of Air Balloon with its offensive advantages against Ground-types, doing especially well against Gliscor thanks to Empoleon's Toxic immunity.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Empoleon's vital advantages against Fairy-types and good Special Attack make it a fantastic Assault Vest tank.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Surf</strong>: Surf is a reliable secondary STAB move that's particularly good against Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Beam versus Grass Knot</strong>: Ice Beam has a multitude of high value targets, such as Dragonite, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Grass Knot's coverage is less impressive, but it prevents Empoleon from being totally walled by bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Milotic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn</strong>: Flip Turn will require giving up coverage or priority, but Empoleon is a bulky enough pivot to justify it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vacuum Wave</strong>: While not being a strong priority move, Vacuum Wave is great for picking off weakened threats, especially Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Competitive versus Torrent</strong>: Competitive is the most reliable option for checking Flutter Mane, punishing Charm variants and ensuring that Special Attack drops from Moonblast turn into an advantage. Torrent can make some sense with Tera Water though, making Surf very difficult to switch into.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Empoleon relies on its excellent typing to be a great Assault Vest tank, but its lack of recovery means Terastallazation can still be important for flipping certain match-ups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water vastly improves Empoleon's match-up against common Ground-types like Ursaluna-B and Landorus-T, removing the Earthquake / Earth Power weakness and having a powerful Surf.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a great response against Fighting-types like Urshifu and also lets Empoleon tank Electric-types like Zapdos and Vikavolt more reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying's Ground-type immunity is perfect for saving it from sweepers like Garchomp and Landorus-T, and it additionally removes grievances with Dondozo's Fissure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass protects Empoleon from Breloom's Spore and makes Grass Knot more desirable.</p> </li> </ul>"

Mystic Water is an option for flexibility but sacrifices the listed KOs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Liquidation versus Waterfall</strong>: Liquidation is a secondary option, and it's preferred when facing frailer offensive teams due to the significant recoil drawback of Wave Crash. However, Waterfall is worth considering for its possible flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: Aqua Jet allows Floatzel to maintain offensive presence outside of rain, as well as being a great response to opposing priority moves, such as Kingambit's Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rain Setter</strong>: Pelipper's rain is mandatory for both Swift Swim and maximum damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water massively bolters Floatzel's damage output, and the weasel simply doesn't have the bulk needed for more defensive options.</li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>60 HP / 252 Atk / 196 Spe</strong>:196 Speed EVs are used to outspeed the entire tier in rain, including Choice Scarf Dragpault.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe</strong>: Maximum Speed investment outspeeds Hydreigon and Mimikyu outside of rain, in addition to tying with Salamence, at the cost of having less buffer HP for Wave Crash recoil.</p> </li> </ul>"

If using Focus Sash, Terastallization becomes far less needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: A Steel Tera type has excellent synergy with Garchomp's typing, letting it more effectively tackle faster Dragon-types, Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, Mimikyu, and Normal-type priority from Dragonite, Entei, and Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness is unfortunate against bulkier teams, a Fire Tera type still gives out a vital Fairy and Ice resistance, and gives a powerful Tera Blast against levitating Tera Steel Pokemon like Latias.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Fairy is an even stronger option against Dragon-types, and gives Garchomp a better matchup against Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water not only gives that sweet Ice resistance to Garchomp, but it makes Choice Scarf Urshifu-R regret ever using Surging Strikes thanks to Rough Skin!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: Loaded Dice keeps Scale Shot at its most reliable damage output, making it the ideal tool for sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Surviving shocking attacks with Focus Sash gives Garchomp new sweeping and revenge killing potential, and makes it a reliable setter of Stealth Rock if needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: If used with Tera Steel and Iron Head, Life Orb's damage boost can potentially push Garchomp past the dreaded Charm Flutter Mane with a 2HKO even after the Attack drop!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry lets Garchomp deal with major Yawn users more easily, such as Swampert and Hippowdon.</p> </li> </ul>"

Even on Choice Scarf sets, Scale Shot is a less risky Dragon-type attack over Outrage, and outspeeding extremely fast threats like Booster Energy Iron Bundle is welcome.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: With Tera Steel, Iron Head lets Choice Band Garchomp 2HKO Charm Flutter Mane, who can otherwise edge out a victory with Pain Split and repeated Attack drops.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stone Edge versus Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb is fairly weak, but the speed control can be very useful on Choice Scarf variants if sacrificing Garchomp. Stone Edge deals massive damage to common Tera Flying Pokemon such as Gholdengo, and it prevents it from being walled by Tera Fairy Levitate Pokemon like Latias.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Fire Fang</strong> While weak, this is Garchomp's best option against Corviknight and Tera Steel Latiias when not Tera Fire.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / Low</strong>: When using the slower Choice Band variants, Terastallization becomes important for avoiding revenge kills. If using Choice Scarf Garchomp, it's fully capable of revenge killing threats without needing Terastallization, only worrying about Ice Shard from Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a fantastic defensive Tera Type for Garchomp with key resistances to Ice and Fairy, and it makes Iron Head a much more powerful option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: When combined with Tera Blast, Tera Fire lets even Choice Scarf Garchomp 2HKO Tera Steel Latias. The Fairy and Ice resistance is also very helpful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy goes all in on the Dragon immunity, no longer being worried about common Fire and Ground coverage from other Dragon-types like Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: The incredible power boost Earthquake gets from Tera Ground is worth considering, with Choice Band possibly 2HKOing physically defensive Porygon2 and Dondozo with it.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band trades revenge killing for wallbreaking, letting Garchomp deal massive damage to Porygon2 and Ursaluna-B with Outrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: With Choice Scarf, Garchomp is able to revenge kill several other major Choice Scarf users, such as Gholdengo, Landorus-T, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

It’s also notable for letting Hippowdon retain immunity to its own Sandstorm chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water improves the lead matchup with Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R, and overall is a strong defensive type that still takes good advantage of Hippowdon’s imposing bulk.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry’s burst recovery is what allows properly invested Hippowdon to avoid 2HKO’s from some of the meta’s strongest attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: If Hippowdon is able to execute an extended Yawn loop, Leftovers passive recovery is a great boon.

With this maximized spread, Hippowdon has a 6.3% chance of surviving Timid Gholdengo's +2 Make It Rain, always survives Modest Chi-Yu’s unboosted Overheat, and avoids the 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane’s Moonblast if using Sitrus Berry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with Impish</strong>: A physically defensive spread means not even Choice Band Dragonite’s Outrage will be able to 2HKO Sitrus Berry Hippowdon.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also gives Magnezone a much-appreciated Fire resistance for Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Volcarona, and lets Magnezone take on Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying has wonderful defensive synergy with Magnezone, reversing its Ground and Fighting weaknesses, and lets Tera Blast hit Grass-types harder.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy-type Tera Blast is very useful against common Dragon-types, most notably Garchomp and Roaring Moon, and hitting bulky Dark-types such as Ting-Lu, Wo-Chien, and Umbreon hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Gaining a resistance to Dark allows Magnezone to surprise and defeat Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon, in addition to dealing plenty of damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Grass has excellent defensive and offense synergy with Magnezone, especially through its utility against Ground-type attackers and Spore immunity. Most notably, Tera Blast Grass can OHKO max SpD Hippowdon with Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: The boost from Tera Steel makes Steel Beam absurdly powerful, with Analytic letting Choice Specs Magnezone OHKO even offensive Multiscale Dragonite!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground helps against opposing Magnezone, OHKOs Iron Moth, and deals good damage against Gholdengo and Kingambit.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: Magnezone's excellent typing means investing in bulk is a great idea. However, note that some important targets such as Corviknight and Skeledirge are a tad faster than it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Calm</strong>: With maximum Special Defense investment and Assault Vest, Magnezone becomes a good soft check against Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, and one of the best pivots in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 SpA / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: While this spread sacrifices a large amount of power, in exchange it outspeeds Adamant maximum Speed Kingambit, who can threaten to deal massive damage otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest</strong>: If using Sturdy, Magnezone can run maximum Speed to outspeed unexpected foes, such as Specially Defensive Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: The increase in special bulk helps Magnezone against the myriad of Choice item special attacking Dragon-types, like Hydreigon and Dragapult. If using Calm, Magnezone can even take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs gives Magnezone a devastating amount of power, with even Clodsire having trouble handling it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: The temporary Ground-type immunity helps Magnezone against foes like Garchomp and Dragonite without Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Analytic</strong>: A Magnezone boosted by both Choice Specs and Analytic is incredibly hard to switch into, making it easier for Magnezone to generate momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: With Sturdy's guaranteed survivability and Magnezone's high damage output, Magnezone will very likely take down at least one Pokemon per game. Sturdy also helps Magnezone play around Dondozo, as it can safely come in on Fissure and use Volt Switch against it, which renders Yawn moot. However, if Magnezone switches into a Yawn and not Fissure, it should be noted that Dondozo often runs Protect to block Volt Switch and ensure Magnezone falls asleep.</p> </li> </ul>"

On the other hand, Earthquake Gliscor can pressure Steel-types to Terastallize into something that Eternatus can more easily deal with. Finally, Tera Fairy Eternatus can pair with Gliscor to make a good defensive core against Miraidon.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Speed EV Benchmarks</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>124 or 36+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds uninvested Ogerpon formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 or 44+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Adamant Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>188 or 92+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Modest Glimmora.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>172+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Adamant Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>188+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Timid Glimmora.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Landorus-T.</p> </li> </ul>",

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its great typing and incredible longevity thanks to Poison Heal, Gliscor is a frustratingly potent defensive threat that may be the single largest cause of matches being determined by the match timer running out!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Gliscor is one of few Pokemon to be given Toxic via TM, allowing it to put opposing walls on a timer while it stays healthy itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect + Substitute</strong>: Stalling turns with Protect + Substitute allows Gliscor to keep itself healthy despite not having access to a manual healing move. This also pairs well with Toxic to keep Gliscor safe as the opponent succumbs to poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake allows Gliscor to threaten Steel- and Poison-types that are otherwise immune to its Toxic-stalling antics.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off’s item removal can allow Gliscor to be more of a team player, removing items such as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet to assist a teammate’s sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Baton Pass</strong>: Gliscor’s immense longevity makes it particularly well suited to passing Substitutes, bolstering its team’s defense while giving them turns to set up.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 36 Def / 244 SpD with Impish</strong>: The physical bulk on this set allows Gliscor to live Jolly Choice Band Koraidon's Outrage on all but the highest damage roll. The special bulk gives Gliscor roughtly a 19% chance to place a Substitute after getting hit with Timid Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 4 Atk / 28 Def / 20 SpD / 228 Spe With with Jolly</strong>: The Speed investment allows Gliscor to outspeed major foes like Jolly Landorus-T and Adamant Urshifu-R, making it more of a nuisance against faster-paced teams at the cost of some survivability. Enough special bulk is maintained to avoid the OHKO from Timid Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. The leftover EVs are mostly used for some extra physical bulk, but can be reallocated to maximize Speed if desired.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium:</strong> Gliscor's natural immunities to troublesome attacks like Electro Drift, Volt Switch, and Fissure are huge benefits, but its vulnerability to popular multi-hit and sound-based attacks means Terastallization has strong defensive utility.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel allows Gliscor to resist Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type moves, giving it increased survivability against a wider array of threats, with the resistance against the Substitute-ignoring Hyper Voice from Ursaluna-B being a big boon. However, Steel leaves it more vulnerable to Fighting-types like Urshifu-S and Fire-types like Ogerpon-H. When using Tera Steel, make sure not to Terastallize on the first turn, or else Toxic Orb will fail!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Gliscor crucial Ice- and Water-type resistances, allowing it to get emergency Toxics off against threats like Urshifu-R and Primarina, both of whom can ruin Substitute with Surging Strikes and Sparkling Aria respectively. It's also a great response against Chien-Pao, especially since Substitute and Protect scout against Electric Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy completely negates Dragon-type attacks, making it impossible for Scale Shot and Outrage to overwhelm Gliscor. Tera Fairy also retains Gliscor's Fighting-type resistance, which can be important for bulky cores trying to defend against Choice Band users like Koraidon and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark's Ghost-type resistance and Psychic-type immunity can make handling Calyrex-S more feasible. Neutralizing Psychic Noise is particularly notable for keeping Poison Heal working.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its wide range of moveset options and its offense-boosting ability Sharpness, Gallade is excellent at dueling a wide variety of threats. Especially notable is Scared Sword, letting Gallade ignore Stamina Archaludon's accumulated boosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Night Slash versus Knock Off</strong>: Night Slash's consistent power is best for pure offense, potentially 2HKOing targets like Bold Gholdengo, assuming they can't stall with Recover and Rocky Helmet. If more utility is desired, Knock Off can be used for removing opposing items.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong>: Shadow Sneak Gallade's most consistent as a priority move, dealing good damage to targets like Gholdengo and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Blade</strong>: Leaf Blade OHKOes Primarina and is Gallade's best hope of muscling past Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Triple Axel</strong>: Though it suffers from some reliability issues, Triple Axel makes Dragonite rue the day it didn't Terastallize against Gallade!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Cutter</strong>: Aqua Cutter benefits from Sharpness, but it doesn't add a lot of extra coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Feint</strong>: Feint lets Gallade pick off weakened Dragonite before they can launch Extreme Speed, but otherwise hitting Gholdengo with Shadow Sneak is usually more useful.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Gallade uses Focus Sash or Assault Vest as its main tool for cushioning a big hit and has great natural coverage. Therefore, Tera is reserved mostly for emergency situations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Beyond offering a useful Fairy-type resistance, Tera Fire blocks Volcarona from burning Gallade.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark not only boosts Night Slash and Knock Off, but provides a key Ghost-type resistance against Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel flips Gallade's weakness to Fairy-type attacks to a resistance. The Ice resistance can also be used in a pinch to keep Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear from OHKOing Gallade through Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost's immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type moves can thwart revenge kill attempts from Mach Punch users and Extreme Speed Dragonite, giving Gallade an opportunity to break Multiscale on the latter.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Gallade has enough Special Defense to make good use of Assault Vest, which lets it survive Tera Normal Ursaluna-B. Compared to Focus Sash, Assault Vest isn't rendered useless by Stealth Rock chip, making Gallade a safer mid- or late-game option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: With Focus Sash, Gallade duels opposing Focus Sash users with its hard-hitting STAB attacks and priority moves, letting it focus on Speed investment.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scope Lens</strong>: While Scope Lens is risky due to Gallade's average bulk and Speed, it pairs well with the increased critical hit ratio many of Gallade's attacks have.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 244 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 116 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This spread is to be used with Assault Vest, surviving Silk Scarf Tera Normal Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon and Vacuum Wave together, while outspeeding even Timid Ursaluna-B and Jolly Ursaluna.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Adamant or Jolly</strong>: A maximum offense spread is standard for Focus Sash and Speed ties with offensive Adamant Dragonite. Jolly can be used to get the jump on Modest Archaludon, especially if using Shadow Sneak to stop Sturdy variants from activating Custap Berry in time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 244 Atk / 28 SpD with Adamant</strong>: Sacrificing Speed for bulk lets Assault Vest Gallade survive Life Orb Tera Normal Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon followed by Vacuum Wave.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Choice Scarf, Gallade is a decent anti-lead against several early-game setups and an unexpected revenge killer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off versus Night Slash</strong>: Knock Off remains a strong disruption move with or without Trick, provided you exercise caution if you've already used Trick. Night Slash has more offensive presence than Knock Off and is a good choice if you really need to hit Gholdengo with consistent damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Triple Axel versus Leaf Blade</strong>: Triple Axel makes Gallade a surprising revenge killer against Garchomp and severely punishes Dragonite that don't Terastallize. Leaf Blade helps against more defensive foes, being a great coverage option for slashing through Primarina and being your best move against Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick with Choice Scarf lets Gallade permanently cripple setup Pokemon like Annihilape and Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Choice Scarf Gallade normally isn't a strong user of Tera. It is best used in situations where Gallade already has momentum and needs to preserve it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire makes facing down Volcarona far less risky thanks to the burn immunity, as well as providing a useful Fairy-type resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel provides a welcome resistance to Fairy-type attacks and Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark stops Choice Scarf Gholdengo from revenge killing with Shadow Ball, while boosting Night Slash and Knock Off</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost grants immunity to Extreme Speed and Mach Punch, letting Gallade keep its speed advantage against Dragonite and Breloom even when its low on health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass can surprise Spore users like Breloom, letting Gallade score an easy KO or cripple them with Trick. Leaf Blade also becomes a 2HKO against Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul>"

When compared to Rotom-W, it is also much more effective at pressuring Flutter Mane, Gholdengo and Wo-Chien.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick gives Rotom-H an excellent tool against defensive foes, such as Dondozo and Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using a neutral nature with a Timid mint</strong>: Make sure to get a Rotom-H with a neutral nature and then use a Timid Mint on it. This way, it can't be confused by any Berries given with Trick.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Discharge</strong>: While weaker than Thunderbolt, the 30% paralysis chance can be devastating for some of Rotom-H's more troublesome matchups, such as Chi-Yu. Do note though that Choice Scarf Rotom-H will have a much harder time 2HKOing Assault Vest Azumarill and certain variants of Dondozo.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: If not running Tera Blast, Rotom-H normally wants to keep its unique typing for defensive purposes, allowing it to switch into several key threats.

Thunder Wave is still a reasonable choice, though, stopping special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Iron Moth in their tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick and Flame Orb</strong>: This one-use method of burning may seem silly, but taking away important items can be devastating against certain Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, and Rotom-H can use this to get rid of troublesome Choice items if it's taken a Trick as well. Note that Rotom-H will burn itself if it Terastallizes while holding Flame Orb, which is generally not good outside of blocking sleep or Toxic poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using a Neutral Nature with a Bold Mint</strong>: If using Trick, it's best to run a neutral nature such as Serious and change the stat boosts with a Bold Mint. This way, Rotom-H won't get confused by any Berry it receives.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Rotom-H's defensive typing is very valuable, so Tera is normally reserved for very specific situations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel with Levitate is a sublime defensive typing, letting Rotom-H better handle huge threats like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is an alternative option to soak up Dragon-type attacks, and it also gives Rotom-H a better matchup against Great Tusk and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While this unfortunately makes Gholdengo a much bigger issue, Tera Ghost is still worth considering for making Rotom-H immune to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Iron Valiant's Close Combat. It also lets Rotom-H switch out of trapping moves without using Volt Switch.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is Rotom-H's ticket to staying around the longest, usually avoiding 2HKOs from powerful unboosted attacks such as Dragonite's Outrage and Iron Valiant's Close Combat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rotom-H's typing makes it a good user of Rocky Helmet, passively punishing physical Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Iron Valiant and making it a good response to expected uses of U-turn.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Levitate and excellent status moves make Rotom-W a clean choice for a bulky pivot!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Foul Play</strong>: Foul Play is essential for hitting Baxcalibur hard, since it's immunity to burns would otherwise let it set up on Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp versus Thunder Wave</strong>: Will-O-Wisp's ability to cripple top-tier physically offensive threats such as Dragonite, Chien-Pao, and Scizor as well as punish the otherwise problematic Iron Hands makes it the best support option. However, Thunder Wave does provide additional insurance against Baxcalibur and punishes special attackers such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hydro Pump</strong>: Hydro Pump gives Rotom-W offensive presence against foes that don't care about the rest of the moveset, like Garganacl, Chi-Yu, Volcarona, and Skeledirge.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Discharge</strong>: Giving Rotom-W an Electric STAB attack to better deal with Flying-types like Corviknight and Tera Flying Roaring Moon is useful, but it can be tricky to fit into the set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hex</strong>: If using Tera Ghost, Hex gives Rotom-W a much fiercer offensive kick than usual after inflicting status.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Defensive Rotom-W works fine without Terastallizing, but some Tera types do make it harder to break through.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel gives Rotom-W an incredible defensive typing, vastly improving its matchups against Pokemon that rely on Ground-type coverage such as Dragonite, Baxcalibur, and Garchomp. It also provides a useful Freeze-Dry resistance against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy guards against fearsome powerful Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-type attacks that Rotom-W can have trouble handling and lets it use Tera Blast to hit Dragonite and Chien-Pao hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost offers Rotom-W a vast array of immunities with Levitate, enabling it to defeat certain Dragonite sets and do much better against Iron Hands and Iron Valiant when Rotom-W lacks Will-O-Wisp. Being a Ghost-type also prevents Rotom-W from getting trapped, letting it escape faster trappers without Volt Switch.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry will turn many powerful, unboosted attacks such as Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao's Crunch, Dragonite's Outrage and Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush into 3HKOs. Just make sure to run an even HP stat so that Sitrus Berry activates with one use of Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: If Sitrus Berry is already in use, Leftovers is a reasonable alternative.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet's extra chip damage can make Rotom-W a less passive pivot.</p> </li> </ul>"

Even when not Terastallized, it's a decent coverage move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hydro Pump versus Substitute</strong>: Hydro Pump is by far Rotom-W's strongest STAB, but it can be worth sacrificing for Substitute, which lets Rotom-W effectively defeat most Garganacl and defensive Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While this Rotom-W can sweep on its own, Terastallization can prevent revenge kills from the likes of Iron Bundle.</li> <li></li> <li><strong>Fairy</strong>: With a Fairy Tera type, Rotom-W can turn the tables on its Dragon-type adversaries, as well as catch Crunch Chien-Pao off guard.</li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry lets Rotom-W easily set up on Hippowdon, and avoid getting put to sleep by Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: If Sleep isn't a big issue, Rotom-W appreciates the burst recovery Sitrus Berry provides. Make sure to run an even HP stat so it activates after Rotom-W gets hit by Ruination once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If using Hydro Pump, this is Rotom-W's best way around Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe</strong>: Maximizing Speed with a Timid nature gives Rotom-W the jump on Gholdengo.

It also allows Cresselia to potentially beat Heatran with sheer power should it accrue enough boosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Beam</strong>: Ice Beam allows Cresselia to immediately threaten the many Ice weak Pokémon in the metagame, such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong> - Thunderbolt allows Cresselia to immediately threaten Urshifu-R and is a great general attacking move if used with an Electric Tera.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: While difficult to fit, Substitute can protect Cresselia from debilitating status from the likes of Toxapex and Dondozo, giving it a wider reach against slower paced teams without relying on Covert Cloak as much.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lunar Dance</strong>: While seemingly odd on a defensive set, Lunar Dance allows Cresselia to bring back a battered teammate in the event it itself cannot finish the game, giving formidable partners such as Chien-Pao and Ursaluna a second chance to break down the opponent.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak guards Cresselia from adverse effects such as flinches and Defense drops that would otherwise impede its ability to take over the endgame. It also negates the passive damage from Garganacl’s Salt Cure, allowing Cresselia to heavily punish it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers’s passive recovery allows Cresselia to better conserve its limited Moonlight PP, more safely set up against powerful attackers like Flutter Mane, and be a more active presence on the field by not mandating it use a turn to heal off every hit it takes manually.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Cresselia makes excellent use of Terastallization thanks to its bulk and Levitate, especially since its presence at team preview attracts hard counters.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Thanks to Levitate, Tera Electric grants Cresselia a complete lack of weaknesses, giving it an extremely diverse defensive profile courtesy of its immense bulk. It also guards against paralysis, minimizing the chance of an ill-timed lost turn ruining a sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison protects Cresselia against Toxic, allowing it to more safely set up against Pokémon like Toxapex. It also grants security against even Tera Fairy Choice Specs Flutter Mane by allowing Cresselia to resist Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel combined with Levitate puts the brakes on Tera Normal Ursaluna-B while also giving a great defensive matchup into Tera Flying Dragonite and Tera Fairy Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy grants Cresselia a crucial resistance to Dark, allowing it to better take on foes like Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

Since Dragonite can still switch out to reset its ability, this option works best with Stealth Rock support.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This set's support focus and bulk usually do not require Terastallization, making Cresselia an excellent partner for the sweepers it supports.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy lets it resist Dark-type attacks from the likes of Chi-Yu while also nullifying Scale Shot setups from attackers like Dragonite and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric remains a solid option thanks to Levitate, giving Cresselia essentially no weaknesses and providing an important paralysis immunity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel makes it much harder for Latios to muscle through Cresselia while still maintaining a very favorable matchup against Dragonite thanks to the synergy with Levitate.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Cresselia is frequently targeted by Taunt users like Flutter Mane, making Mental Herb a great option to guarantee Trick Room is set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is a strong general option for further augmenting Cresselia's longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is useful for breaking Focus Sash from targets like both formes of Urshifu, making it more difficult for them to stall out an incoming Trick Room sweep.</p> </li> </ul>"

Tera Poison also still retains Amoonguss's Toxic Spikes absorbing utility.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Fire isn't the best defensive typing, but it's a way to retain a Fairy resistance if dealing with Ice- and Fire-type attacks is needed.</p> </li> </ul>"

On the other hand, Clear Smog prevents Amoonguss from getting set up on unless the opponent is Steel-type or has a Substitute up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Sludge Bomb, Giga Drain OHKOs Iron Bundle after Stealth Rock damage, and doesn't have to worry about Tera Water.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic's conflicts with Spore make it a lesser option, but it's a devastating option against some bulky Spore absorbers such as Wo-Chien and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hex</strong>: Hex both punishes foes put to sleep by Spore and hits Air Balloon Gholdengo and Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stomping Tantrum</strong>: Stomping Tantrum deals decent damage to Gholdengo and Magnezone.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Despite Amoonguss's solid defensive typing, several major threats such as Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur will require Terastallization to deal with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is Amoonguss's ticket for dealing with Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark removes its weakness to Psychic-type attacks and makes Foul Play stronger.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison retains Amoonguss's ability to use Black Sludge and absorb Toxic Spikes, at the cost of being weak to the common Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: While it makes Amoonguss weak to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, it also grants Amoonguss a better matchup against Iron Bundle, especially if using Giga Drain.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: The extra recovery from Leftovers pairs well with the free turns Spore often grants Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge</strong>: Black Sludge is a great way to get around Item Clause if Leftovers is already in use.

It can also be used on Ogerpon-W's Water Absorb to make Flip Turn possible against it.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Physically bulky Alomomola already has good typing against the threats it wants to wall, but there are times when Terastallization is needed to augment its role.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Fighting-type resistance can be used to buy more time against Koraidon and Urshifu-R as well as just outright walling powerful Dragon-type moves like Outrage and Scale Shot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison improves the Flutter Mane matchup and provides important support for removing Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is fantastic for chipping the likes of Koraidon and Dragonite just by switching into their contact moves. Paired with Alomomola's recovery support, it has great potential to stack this damage up over time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers synergizes well with Protect, and the extra passive recovery can give Alomomola greater freedom to pass Wish to its teammates.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 252 Def / 140 SpD with Relaxed</strong>: The physical bulk on this EV spread is tuned for Scale Shot from Jolly Koraidon, guaranteeing Alomomola can survive up to nine individual hits before recovery.

Furthermore, targets like defensive Dragonite are still faster than Alomomola after a single Speed drop, allowing it to maintain its safe pivoting support.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Liquidiation</strong>: Liquidation helps Alomomola deal decent overall damage if forced into a situation where it has to play offensively such as against Calm Mind Flutter Mane.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Alomomola is extremely difficult to OHKO, and with Terastallization, it can thwart its counters and live even longer! Do note though that losing its original typing can make it much more vulnerable to wallbreakers like Tera Water Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison grants pivotal Fairy and Grass resistances against Flutter Mane, Rillaboom, and the Ogerpon formes. The immunity to Toxic and Toxic Spikes is also a big help.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy helps against Dark- and Fighting-type attacks from Chien-Pao and the Urshifu formes and can be used alongside Play Rough to give Alomomola more kick against these targets.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>52 HP / 212 Def / 244 SpD with Relaxed</strong>: This EV spread gives Alomomola a balanced defensive profile.

Terastallization is it's best way to flip these matchups when absolutely necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel can be used to get around the many Dragon and Fairy-types that try to revenge kill Hydreigon, though it is still vulnerable to Mach Punch from Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison has great synergy with Hydreigon's former typing, making it do especially well against Great Tusk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire will grant Hydreigon a resistance to Fairy-types while removing its weakness to Fighting-types and powering up Flamethrower or Fire Blast. However, unlike Tera Steel it does not grant a resistance to Dragon, and it also gives Hydreigon a few new weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosts Dark Pulse into an absurdly powerful weapon, and when coupled with its flinch rate, Tera Dark Hydreigon can potentially muscle its way out of otherwise hopeless situations.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, Hydreigon will likely still have to deal with its Dragon-type brethren, so Terastallization is sometimes necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: A Steel Tera type has fantastic synergy with Levitate, helping Hydreigon against Dragon- and Fairy-types without the dreaded Ground weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: With a Poison Tera type, Hydreigon can do well against Fairy-types without fear of powerful Fighting-type attacks.

Just note that Tera Fairy compromises Volcarona's ability to check Gholdengo effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: With a Grass Tera type, Volcarona can now 2HKO most Dondozo with Giga Drain and is better insulated against revenge kills from Water-types like Primarina and Basculegion, at the cost of being vulnerable against opposing Volcarona.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Besides removing all of Volcarona's old weaknesses, a Water Tera type also massively improves the match up against Primarina and Basculeigon, and gives a powerful Tera Blast to use against Skeledirge.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Stealth Rock is common enough that this is the safest item for Volcarona to hold.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry gives Volcarona more durability against teams that lack hazards, and with an even HP stat, it'll eat Sitrus Berry right away after switching into Sealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: This allows Volcarona to recover from status once against threats like Spore Breloom, Yawn Dondozo, and Thunder Wave Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If using Tera Water against Garganacl, Covert Cloak stops it from beating Volcarona with Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Kee Berry</strong>: Kee Berry's activated Defense boost makes Volcarona even more difficult to revenge kill, though it can only be used once per match.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Odd HP versus Even HP</strong>: Volcarona will usually prefer an odd HP stat to take less residual damage, with Stealth Rock no longer 2HKOing being the most important if Volcarona loses Heavy-Duty Boots from Knock Off.

The Attack EVs also let Earthquake 2HKO offensive variants of both Urshifu formes and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: Investing fully in special bulk makes Landorus-T much more consistent into special attackers like Flutter Mane.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While many matchups favor Landorus-T's natural typing, other threats such as Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R will require Terastallization if attempting to set up in front of them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dragon-type immunity is critical for stopping Scale Shot setup from Dragonite and making Substitute much harder to break.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its good natural bulk, Sylveon can serve as a potent special attacker and decent revenge killer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast serves as a good alternate STAB attack once Sylveon has Terastallized, providing highly valuable coverage against the Steel-types that could otherwise exploit it, like Scizor. It also gets around potential users of Throat Chop before Terastallization, such as Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock</strong>: This is Sylveon's best shot of dealing with Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Shadow Ball hits foes such as Mimikyu, Flutter Mane, and Gholdengo super effectively, and it means Sylveon does not have to Terastallize to hit Gholdengo for good damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Quick Attack</strong>: Though it is weak, Quick Attack gives valuable priority for picking off weakened threats, and thanks to Pixilate, surprise users of Tera Ghost aren't able to absorb it. A Quiet nature can be used to increase its power, though this risks Sylveon getting outsped by Kingambit.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: Psychic deals more damage to physically defensive Toxapex and Amoonguss, but its lower damage output against Iron Moth makes it disappointing if not using Tera Ground.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Beam</strong>: Despite the serious risks from the recharge turn, Hyper Beam's extreme power makes it a good filler move.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest lets even offensive Sylveon be specially resilient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: With the boost from Choice Specs, Sylveon is a surprisingly potent wallbreaker, making the most out of its many opportunities to switch in.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA</strong>: This spread capitalizes on Sylveon's good natural bulk while maximizing its power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe</strong>: While no bulk investment makes Sylveon more difficult to safely get in, Speed investment allows it to outrun and threaten a wider range of foes, such as Scizor and Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Sylveon suffers coverage issues on its own, so its heavily reliant on either Tera Blast or the sheer power of Tera Fairy Hyper Voice to break past them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire allows Sylveon to break past troublesome Steel-types, like Gholdengo and Kingambit, and gives it a key resistance to Ice- and Fire-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives good coverage against Fire-types like Iron Moth and Skeledirge, in addition to surprising Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu by resisting their strongest STAB attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground doesn't match up quite as well against Steel-types as Tera Fire, but it lets Sylveon turn the tables on Iron Moth, and deal massive damage to Toxapex and Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Getting an extra boost on Hyper Voice and Hyper Beam makes Choice Specs Sylveon far more difficult to wall, with even resists such as Gholdengo and physically defensive Skeledirge getting 2HKOed by Hyper Voice!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Giving Sylveon extra special bulk lets it take on powerful threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle more reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs turns Sylveon into a surprising wallbreaker, especially if using Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Throat Spray</strong>: With Hyper Voice activating Throat Spray, Sylveon could potentially break apart slower foes in the late-game, though it only gets one shot at this Special Attack boost. This is best used with Tera Blast to give Sylveon an alternative STAB attack that doesn't activate Throat Spray.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its good bulk and Special Attack and a reasonable healing move in Wish, Sylveon is a good choice for a bulky Fairy-type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Voice</strong>: Hyper Voice gives Sylveon a reliable STAB even when Terastallized, and hits through common Substitute users like Iron Bundle and Wo-Chien. While It's possible to drop this attack for Tera Blast in an attempt to run more coverage, this seriously worsens Sylveon's matchup against Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Beyond just Terastallization, Tera Blast is still impacted by Pixilate, making it a good move to use against foes that sometimes carry Throat Chop, like Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect pairs excellently with Leftovers, and makes Wish a more reliable recovery move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yawn</strong>: Sylveon's good bulk makes it a great choice for phazing with Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock</strong>: Psyshock is Sylveon's best hope for Iron Moth switch-ins.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Shadow Ball offers important coverage on Gholdengo without demanding that Sylveon Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Leftovers is the preferred recovery item for its synergy with Protect and Wish, but Sitrus Berry is a reasonable alternative if Protect isn't wanted, or if another teammate needs Leftovers more.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Sylveon's coverage issues are much easier to deal with when using Terastallization, but this set can still be used well defensively without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: A Fire Tera type grants Sylveon resistances to Steel and Fairy, allowing it to take on foes it would otherwise have to run from, such as Gholdengo, and a good STAB to hit Chien-Pao hard with if not using Hyper Voice. It also works against Scizor, but note that Tera Water is common on that foe. Tera Fire also makes Sylveon far more vulnerable to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a great mono-attacking option, making it ideal if only running Tera Blast to do decently well against Steel-types. It also gives Sylveon a better matchup against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, and is a safer option against Ting-Lu and Tera Water Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: If not using Tera Blast, Fairy becomes a reasonable option for boosting Hyper Voice's damage output. Note that Tera Blast is not needed to justify a different Tera Type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground worsens Sylveon's matchup with Chien-Pao, but it does let it deal big damage to Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Toxapex.</p> </li> </ul>"

While Heavy Slam isn't very useful against heavy targets, it's worth using for OHKOing offensive Flutter Mane, one of the biggest threats in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor versus Ice Beam</strong>: Draco Meteor's power makes switching offensive threats like Urshifu-R into Hisuian Goodra tricky, and it is notable for 2HKOing Dondozo. Ice Beam lets Hisuian Goodra punish important Ground-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acid Spray</strong>: Acid Spray is a useful wallbreaking tool, capable of making even specially bulky foes like Clodsire risk taking massive damage after the Special Defense drop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt is another way to 2HKO physically defensive Dondozo and OHKO offensive Urshifu-R and pairs very well with Ice Beam in terms of coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: While not particularly strong, Earthquake is highly recommended for 2HKOing Heatran and 3HKOing opposing Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra, as both of these will wall this set otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: For other Steel-types like Gholdengo and Scizor, Flamethrower will deal much more damage than Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Quiet</strong>: The importance of mirror matches makes Modest an appealing option for Hisuian Goodra, but Quiet will ensure that all but the bulkiest Flutter Mane will need to Terastallize to avoid an OHKO from Heavy Slam.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Surf</strong>: Surf is a decent option to hit Ground-types and Heatran with one attack, but Surf will, at best, usually only 3HKO Heatran.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Despite Hisuian Goodra's superb typing, its common weaknesses to Ground and Fighting make Terastallization a valuable route for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying covers Hisuian Goodra's former weaknesses fantastically, even giving it an out against Fissure Dondozo. This comes at the cost of doing much worse against Iron Bundle, Thundurus-T, Zapdos, and Rotom-W though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy still gives Hisuian Goodra a vital Fighting resistance, as well as being a good defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water has good synergy with Sap Sipper, giving Hisuian Goodra a sole weakness to Electric, in addition to gaining a useful Ice resistance against Chien-Pao, at the cost of doing worse against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: If using Heavy Slam, there is a a chance that Hisuian Goodra can become infatuated by the very rare Cute Charm Enamorus, making a female gender very slightly superior.</li> </ul>"

Ice Beam, on the other hand, is a safer and stronger option against Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rest and Chesto Berry</strong>: Rest and Chesto Berry combine to give Hisuian Goodra a great way to restore health, though the combination is only reliable once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Dew</strong>: Life Dew doesn't restore much health even with Leftovers, but it can help Hisuian Goodra last longer against some physical threats after setting up.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Hisuian Goodra's fantastic typing doesn't make Terastallization a requirement, but it does make setting up against major physical threats like Urshifu-R and Landorus-T much more feasible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only covers all of Hisuian Goodra's former weaknesses, but it also means Fissure is no longer an option to break through its boosts from the likes of Dondozo or Ting-Lu. The new weaknesses to Electric and Ice can harm it though, since Electric- and Ice-type coverage moves are commonly special.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Hisuian Goodra shielding from both Urshifu formes without giving it the harmful Electric and Ice weaknesses that Flying does, though it can harm mirror matches against Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful or Sassy</strong>: This specially defensive spread is Hisuian Goodra's best shot at avoiding a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera Fairy Moonblast, assuming extra Leftovers recovery from Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish or Relaxed</strong>: Maximum physical bulk means Hisuian Goodra won't check Flutter Mane nearly as well, but it let will let Body Press become a better sweeping tool.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Acid Armor</strong>: Acid Armor is the best option for boosting Defense due to its higher PP, but it requires Hisuian Sligoo to evolve while knowing the move in either Scarlet or Violet, as it's not able to be relearned by Hisuian Goodra. Shelter is still a viable, albeit strictly inferior, option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Female Gender</strong>: While very rare, Heavy Slam being a contact move means Hisuian Goodra does risk of activating Enamorus's Cute Charm, making a female gender a marginally better choice.</p> </li> </ul>"

This makes Icicle Crash the more consistent option for overall damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Support Partners</strong>: Even though Avalugg stops foes such as Dondozo from using Fissure, it lacks the power to cleanly beat these targets on its own. Common stall teammates such as Toxapex and Clodsire can bring Toxic or Toxic Spikes to spread status, allowing Avalugg to simply stall while poison wears down the opposition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: Full investment into HP and Defense give Avalugg insane physical bulk. Even Choice Band Chien-Pao’s Sacred Sword isn’t a reliable 2HKO!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: Combined with Sturdy, Mirror Coat is a tempting last resort against the special attackers that Avalugg can’t wall. However, this almost assuredly destroys Avalugg’s survivability afterwards, which can compromise the defensive cycle of its team.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Situational</strong>: Most commonly a member of stall-based teams, Avalugg’s bad matchups are supposed to be covered by the team’s defensive cycle. Tera is normally only used if it is necessary to prevent the collapse of said defensive cycle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting balances offense and defense, making Tera Dark targets like Urshifu-S and Choice Band Chien-Pao much easier to deal with while giving a sizable boost to Avalugg’s best attack in Body Press.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy provides both a Fighting- and Dark-type resistance, making it the best defensive type into Urshifu-S. Furthermore, it doesn't have the Flying-type weakness of Tera Fighting, so Tera Flying Dragonite and Landorus-T are still manageable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost lets Avalugg escape from precarious situations against trapping moves and Gothitelle. It also outright walls Close Combat from the likes of Iron Hands and Iron Valiant, although the new Dark-type weakness significantly worsens its matchup with Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Since Avalugg can expect to do a lot of switching, removing its vulnerability to Stealth Rock damage is extremely important for its longevity and preservation of Sturdy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Avalugg can punish many physical attackers it switches into with Rocky Helmet chip, slowly wearing them down without having to be offensively involved.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Toxapex stands out as a masterful spreader of poison to support its teammates, and an effective bulky pivot against common foes like Urshifu-R as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic is the most reliable way to spread the deadliest version of poison and is especially effective against Taunt users like Annihilape and Serperior if using Mental Herb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Toxic Spikes makes the team less reliant on Toxapex to spread status directly, and acts as excellent support for stalling teammates like Ting-Lu, Dragonite and Gliscor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Haze</strong>: Even with Toxapex's great bulk, powerful setup sweepers like Dragonite and Urshifu-S quickly get out of control for it, so Haze is the best solution to prevent Toxapex from being setup bait.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Liquidation versus Poison Jab</strong>: Liquidation isn't particularly strong but it allows Toxapex to 2HKO Chi-Yu and is a great option for breaking Substitute against targets like Flutter Mane. Poison Jab leaves Toxapex completely walled by Steel-types, but it does preform better against Water-types like Primarina and Ogerpon-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Baneful Bunker</strong>: If using Black Sludge or Leftovers, Baneful Bunker is a fantastic way to spread poison against physical attackers and get some extra recovery with one moveslot, but keep in mind that this won't work against Urshifu-R. It's also key for scouting dangerous uses of Trick from the likes of Gholdengo and Latios.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physically Defensive versus Specially Defensive</strong>: Physically defensive Toxapex does well against some hard-to-check threats, such as Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao. Maximizing Special Defense on the other hand, almost always lets Toxapex survive Tera Normal Life Orb Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Infestation</strong>: Infestation is Toxapex's best chance of doing chip damage to Toxic-immune threats, such as Corviknignt and Gholdengo, and the trapping works fairly well against foes that do have problems with Toxic. It also prevents double switching from being an issue for Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Chilling Water</strong>: Chilling Water gives Toxapex another tool against physical sweepers, but makes it much more vulnerable to Substitute in general.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can help Toxapex beat a new set of threats, its bulk and good defensive typing usually makes it a rare occurrence compared to its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy removes all of Toxapex's weaknesses and can save it from taking massive damage from Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse. It also does well against powerful Dragon-type attacks such as Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage and Choice Specs Archaludon's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass gives Toxapex an important Ground resistance while still preforming well against Urshifu-R, with the bonus of stopping Breloom's Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides making Toxapex far less vulnerable to Electric, which Chien-Pao often Terastallizes into, Tera Poison retains the ability to restore health with Black Sludge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While Normal isn't an impressive defensive type, Tera Normal can punish Choice locked Ghost-types, such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness can be an issue, Tera Bug is a niche way to resist Ground-type attacks while being neutral to both Ice- and Electric-type moves, unlike other methods.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only protects Toxapex from its irritating Ground-type weakness but also means Fissure Dondozo will no longer pressure Toxapex. However, this typing makes Toxapex much worse into general offense.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: With Mental Herb providing one-time protection from Taunt, Toxapex can surprise foes like Annihilape and Serperior with Toxic, which is especially helpful if not running an attack. It also provides some cushioning against common Encore users like Dragonite and Primarina.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge versus Leftovers</strong>: Having passive healing is wonderful, especially with Baneful Bunker. Black Sludge is a clever way to get around Item Clause, but Leftovers gives Toxapex less drawback when using Tera types that aren't Poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet makes Toxapex a superb response to Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, and generally lets it punish common users of contact moves like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S.</p> </li> </ul>"

Mimikyu can even surprise normally faster targets by using it with Choice Scarf.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using a neutral Nature with a mint</strong>: Mimikyu should have a neutral nature with the appropriate Mint used on it.

The rest is placed in Defense to wall top physical sweepers as best as possible.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Bright Powder</strong>: While not particularly reliable, even one miss against Mimikyu can be devastating!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Figy Berry</strong>: Figy Berry and its other counterparts give Mimikyu another method of healing after using Substitute enough times.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Mimikyu rarely Terastallizes, as it needs to keep the damaging effect of Curse at almost all times.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal can help prevent Calyrex-S from going unchecked, buying a turn to gain extra Curse damage or to land Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Terastallizing this Mimikyu for extra damage output is fairly situational, but getting a bit of extra power can help late game.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also has an advantage over Protect in that it isn't bypassed by the Urshifu formes, making it particularly dangerous to Urshifu-R that lack Punching Glove. On the other hand, Protect can block pivoting moves that would otherwise reset Curse, and it's generally better at stalling out effects such as Terrains and Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Thunder Wave is a good fallback that can permanently cripple targets, especially those that don't fear Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Mimikyu already has the tools it needs to perform its role without Terastallization. On the rare occasion that Terastallization is used, keep in mind that any Tera type that sheds Mimikyu's Ghost typing will remove Curse's damaging effect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar provides a good one-time boost on the rare occasions it's needed while maintaining Mimikyu's original typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost keeps Mimikyu's most important typing for Curse while powering up Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground, particularly when it's used late-game, can cause big issues for Choice item Miraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal's Ghost-type immunity is great for gaining extra turns against Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water allows Mimikyu to survive Tera Water Surging Strikes from Choice Band Urshifu-R, potentially forcing it to take even more Rocky Helmet chip damage. It is also strong against Koraidon's Flare Blitz.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a more niche option that makes it easier to cushion Zacian-C and rack up additional damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Odd HP Number</strong>: Though the situation rarely comes up, an odd HP number is desirable so that Mimikyu can use Curse twice from full health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>12 Speed EVs</strong>: Because Mimikyu is only 1 base Speed point lower than Urshifu, it is not uncommon to redistribute some EVs from Attack into Speed to outspeed bulky Urshifu. 12 Speed EVs is the minimum needed, though further investment is recommended, since even bulky Urshifu formes will bump their Speed by a few points.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Def / 4 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread survives Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash after Disguise has been broken. The HP investment is also optimized to reduce residual damage from the likes of Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 196 Atk / 164 Def with Adamant</strong>: The extra physical bulk now allows Mimikyu to survive Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash after both Stealth Rock damage and a Disguise break. If Disguise is still active, it almost always survives against Adamant Punching Glove Urshifu-R's Tera Water Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 28 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Full physical bulk can help Mimikyu live a little longer against threats like Assault Vest Koraidon that lack Flare Blitz.

      "Trick Room Support": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to Disguise, Mimikyu is a very consistent Trick Room setter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse</strong>: Curse is used as a way to sacrifice Mimikyu and safely bring in a Trick Room sweeper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Will-O-Wisp can cripple attackers that have already set up prior to deploying Trick Room. Disguise helps cover the fact that Mimikyu is using a slower Will-O-Wisp, but be wary of Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While dealing damage isn't this set's focus, Rocky Helmet is still useful for wearing down bulky physical attackers like Koraidon and Urshifu-R that might otherwise pose problems for common Trick Room sweepers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Mental Herb foils Taunt usage meant to stop Mimikyu from setting Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb allows Mimikyu to function better as a secondary attacker, especially when the opponent is trying to stall out Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak is for targets that rely on flinching to stop Mimikyu, such as Icicle Crash Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ability Shield</strong>: Ability Shield can stop Moongeist Beam Lunala and Mold Breaker Ogerpon-H from knocking out Mimikyu through Disguise.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Mimikyu usually wants to keep its original typing, both for maintaining Curse's Ghost-type effect and for the Scale Shot immunity versus Koraidon and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar keeps all the benefits of Mimikyu's superior typing while giving a little extra offensive power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal's Ghost-type immunity helps Mimikyu control momentum against Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water combined with Rocky Helmet can cause fits for the likes of Flare Blitz Koraidon and Surging Strikes Urshifu-R.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>0 Speed IV with a Relaxed or Brave Nature</strong>: Mimikyu generally wants the slowest Speed possible for moving first in Trick Room. The main disadvantage to this Speed outside of Trick Room is not being able to outrun uninvested Dragonite. If Mimikyu is running standard uninvested Speed, use an Impish or Adamant nature instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP EVs</strong>: All spreads below optimize HP to take as little damage as possible from sources like Stealth Rock and Disguise breaks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 28 Atk / 252 Def with Relaxed</strong>: Focusing on physical bulk makes it so that even Tera Water Choice Band Urshifu-R will struggle to OHKO Mimikyu. It also survives Adamant Scizor's Bullet Punch even after accounting for Stealth Rock damage and a Disguise break.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 252 Atk / 28 Def with Brave</strong>: This spread gives Mimikyu a much better offensive presence for when it's needed. Enough physical bulk is maintained to survive Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash after Disguise is broken.</p> </li> </ul>"

Thanks to its Mold Breaker property, a boosted Necrozma-DM can cleave through Pokemon with Unaware like Dondozo and Skeledirge as well as ignore abilities like Mimikyu's Disguise and Dragonite's Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sunsteel Strike</strong>: Sunsteel Strike is another powerful ability-ignoring STAB move that does huge damage to Tera Fairy Pokemon especially. However, running both STAB moves has the downside of being resisted by Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake is good complementary coverage that can be used to hit Steel-type foes like Scizor and Archaludon that can take Necrozma-DM's STAB attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: Swords Dance raises Necrozma-DM's already high Attack to extraordinary heights and allows it to rip through teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: With its naturally good bulk fortified even more by its ability Prism Armor, Necrozma-DM can survive many super effective hits, but there are times when Terastallization will be needed to survive especially powerful attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is the clear premium Tera type, as it is a generally solid defensive typing that critically affords Necrozma-DM a resistance to powerful Fire-type moves from threats like Koraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground should be used with Earthquake to give Necrozma-DM a STAB boost and also has the benefit of nullifying Miraidon's devastating Electric-type attacks. Blocking paralysis from Thunder Wave is an additional benefit that potentially provides a free turn of setup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Tera Dragon is an alternative defensive Tera type to Water that grants Necrozma-DM a resistance to both Koraidon's Fire-type moves and Miraidon's Electric-type moves as well as both of Ogerpon-H's STAB moves. However, it may leave Necrozma-DM vulnerable to Chien-Pao's Ice Shard.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is a good choice that provides Necrozma-DM with pinch healing, keeping it healthy enough to set up or continue a sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry helps protect Necrozma-DM against status conditions from moves like Yawn and Will-o-Wisp that foes may use to try to slow it down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Weakness Policy</strong>: With its good defensive stats, Prism Armor, and common weaknesses, Necrozma-DM is one of the best users of Weakness Policy. If it is activated on the turn Necrozma-DM sets up Trick Room, then it can start sweeping immediately!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>0 Speed IV with a Brave nature</strong>: This makes Necrozma-DM as slow as possible to function most optimally under Trick Room. However, even with minimum Speed, it will never be able to underspeed Ursaluna-B or anything slower than that.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>31 Speed IV with an Adamant nature</strong>: In light of the awkward Speed tier mentioned above, Necrozma-DM can opt to forgo minimum Speed. With this adjustment, Necrozma-DM can outspeed defensive foes in the base 60-70 Speed range, such as Skeledirge, Scizor, and Corvinight, outside of Trick Room.

Drum Beating's speed control can help incoming teammates, while Wood Hammer's high Base Power combined with the Terrain Boost can OHKO threats such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>High Horsepower</strong>: While Knock Off will deal more initial damage against Gholdengo, High Horsepower deals more damage afterwards against particularly bulky Gholdengo, and is Rillaboom's best attack against bulky Fire-types like Gouging Fire and Incineroar.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast can be a big commitment, but the ability to flip several important matchups can be worth it, especially if it supports incoming teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest versus Choice Band</strong>: Assault Vest is best for making Rillaboom a bulky offensive support Pokemon, letting it take on powerful special attackers like Flutter Mane and Ursaluna-B more effectively. Choice Band is more independent and relies much more on pivoting, but it makes Rillaboom an awesome revenge killer that strikes fear into the heart of all but very bulky Flutter Mane!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Rillaboom generally wants to save Tera for a teammate, but many poor matchups can be turned around with Terastallization when needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire grants a Fairy resistance alongside Fire and Ice resistances for Ogerpon-H and Chien-Pao, as well as protection from burn spreaders like Entei. However, this comes at the expense of no longer being able to defensively check Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Tera Rock can flip the script on Extreme Speed Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Gouging Fire by resisting their best attack and retaliating with big damage from Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass makes Grassy Glide even more effective at sniping foes, with Assault Vest Rillaboom now being able to OHKO offensive Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice is a poor defensive type outside of the Iron Bundle matchup, but with Tera Blast, it's Rillaboom’s most powerful option for hitting Dragonite and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water provides a balanced defensive profile, giving Rillaboom Ice and Fire resistances while maintaining its matchup into Urshifu-R.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 148 Atk / 4 Def / 156 SpD / 60 Spe with Adamant</strong>: With Assault Vest and Grassy Surge recovery, this spread avoids the 2HKO from Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry without having to Terastallize. The Speed investment lets Rillaboom outrun Jolly Garchomp after a single Drum Beating.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Adamant or Jolly</strong>: Severely compromising Rillaboom's bulk is risky, but outspeeding Modest or Timid Gholdengo depending on the nature used can be a big surprise when using Choice Band Rillaboom.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Grassy Seed turns Rillaboom into a bulky late-game sweeper, particularly one that can stand up to the dreaded Basculegion!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acrobatics</strong>: Acrobatics pairs excellently with Grassy Seed's instant usage and is Rillaboom's strongest option against Dragonite if not using Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: While it mandates using Tera on Rillaboom, Tera Blast is a great option for expanding Rillaboom's shallow offensive coverage.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>12 HP EVs and Grassy Seed</strong>: Thanks to the Defense boost from Grassy Seed, it only takes 12 HP EVs to guarantee that non-Terastallized Rillaboom will survive Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Def / 92 SpD / 12 Spe</strong>: This EV spread avoids the OHKO from Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast as well as the 2HKO (or OHKO if Tera Rock) from both Urshifu formes' Close Combat. The HP EVs help Rillaboom get the most efficient recovery out of Grassy Terrain. Finally, thek given Speed EVs let Rillaboom outrun up to paralyzed Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Spe</strong>: An offensive spread still works well with Grassy Seed, and the investment in Speed lets Rillaboom outrun Modest Gholdengo, Adamant Dragonite, and Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / High</strong>: Terastallization is often needed to help Rillaboom get going, either by taking attacks from would-be counters or blowing through key matchups with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire lets Rillaboom defend against Chien-Pao's and Ogerpon-H's best attacks simultaneously. It also works great alongside Grassy Surge, reducing Earthquake's damage back to neutral levels.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Tera Rock with Tera Blast gives Rillaboom a well-rounded matchup into Dragonite, allowing it to deal super effective damage while also resisting Extreme Speed. Earthquake is less of a problem too thanks to Grassy Terrain!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice is used offensively with Tera Blast to blindside targets like Dragonite and Landorus-T. While it is lacking defensively, it does still give Rillaboom a useful Ice resistance versus Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a bit more unorthodox, but the boost to Grassy Glide gives Rillaboom more immediate revenge killing power.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Corviknight's fantastic typing makes it a great physically defensive pivot, easily getting dangerous teammates in such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Ogerpon-H in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Body Press versus Iron Head</strong>: Body Press has decent damage output and helps massively against common Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S. Meanwhile, Iron Head ensures that Corviknight will not be walled by Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Corviknight might not be fast, but it's fast enough to shut down most other defensive Pokemon with Taunt, such as Ting-Lu and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave Bird</strong>: Brave Bird's recoil is unwelcome, but it's a fantastic response against Ogerpon-H, who otherwise will scare Corviknight off.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Neutral Speed Natures versus Negative Speed Natures with a Speed IV of 4 or 5</strong>: Negative Speed natures are handy for giving very slow U-turns when used in conjunction with lower Speed IVs, as well as not risking getting hit by Ursaluna-B's Earth Power while using Roost. Just note that going any lower than 4 Speed IVs will underspeed Ting-Lu before it can be shut down by Taunt, and powerful Special attackers like Primarina outspeeding Corviknight can be a problem for some teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Tailwind</strong>: Tailwind is an incredible support move for making powerful sweepers like Urshifu-R even more difficult to revenge kill, though its short time span can make it tricky to fully take advantage of.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight's defensive typing is fantastic, so don't Terastallize too hastily, or else it'll lose to threats it normally checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Dragon and Fairy weaknesses are devastating, but in the late-game, resisting Electric and Fire can give Corviknight new win conditions against foes such as Ogerpon-H that lack Play Rough and Tera Water Urshifu-R. Just note that Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire may not seem like a good fit for a pivot due to the Stealth Rock weakness, but it vastly improves Corviknight's chances of defeating Ogerpon-H and Tera Electric Chien-Pao, making it a worthy defensive choice. Do note that this won't help much against Choice Specs Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: While this set doesn't always use Brave Bird, Tera Flying lets Corviknight keep its typing while using Roost, meaning Earthquake and Fissure can no longer hit Corviknight while its restoring health. It also improves Corviknight's chances against Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Corviknight consistently survives all but Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Overheat, letting it deal serious damage with Body Press. It also gains a key resistance to Ice for Chien-Pao and Water for Tera Water Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Getting STAB on Body Press can give Corviknight a surprisingly decent chance at cleaning weakened teams, though this makes it especially vulnerable to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: While turning Corviknight's incredible Ground-type immunity into a weakness is unfortunate, Tera Electric otherwise improves a wide variety of match-ups, with Tera Electric Chien-Pao and Raging Bolt being particularly major ones.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: This lets Corviknight wear down physical threats more quickly while pivoting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's consistent recovery can be quite helpful for taking repeated hits from Ruination when attempting to stall it out with Pressure.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: Mirror Armor's ability to punish Flutter Mane for using Mystical Fire makes it a great ability choice on Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Corviknight's excellent bulk and Taunt makes Pressure a good alternative for stalling out foes such as Gliscor and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 SpD with Impish or Relaxed</strong> This spread has enough bulk to avoid a 2HKO from Timid Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump as long as they lack an offensive item, which can be especially useful if using Pressure. Just beware of Iron Bundle's Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 20 Def / 236 SpD with Careful or Sassy</strong>: This specially defensive spread won't check major physical threats like Dragonite nearly as well, but it does avoid a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "IronPress": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Corviknight stands out as one of the best choices around for sweeping with Iron Defense and Body Press, thanks to its excellent typing and Roost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head versus Brave Bird</strong>: Iron Head ensures Flutter Mane isn't a reliable check to Corviknight, in addition to making it an even better Swords Dance Mimikyu check. Brave Bird is less reliable at beating Flutter Mane, but severely punishes Ogerpon-H switch-ins.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn versus Taunt</strong>: While U-turn with this set may seem strange, Corviknight is still a decent pivot even if it must give up Taunt. Just note that this keaves Corviknight completely walled by Ghost-types like Flutter Mane. Taunt on the other hand, lets Corviknight effectively shut down slower defensive Pokemon, such as Ting-Lu and Dondozo. Note that both options leave Corviknight hopelessly walled by Flutter Mane.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight has a fantastic defensive typing, so only Terastallize if you need to win certain matchups, especially since it becomes vulnerable to Toxic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: With a Fighting Tera type, Body Press is easier to sweep with, with many Ting-Lu variants now being 2HKOed by boosted Body Press. It also gets rid of enough of Corviknight's common weaknesses that foes like Ogerpon-H and Raging Bolt will check Corviknight far less reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Corviknight a way to resist both Chien-Pao's and Chi-Yu's most powerful STAB attacks, though Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat. It also stops Tera Water Urshifu-R from cleaving through Corviknight's Iron Defense with Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: A Dragon Tera type lets Corviknight resist common attacks aimed at it, such as Electric- and Fire-type attacks from foes like Raging Bolt and Ogerpon-H respectively. However, the new weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon make this an especially reactive Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: While Tera Fire leaves Corviknight extremely vulnerable to Urshifu-R, in exchange it retains the important Fairy-type resistance and does well against Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Flying Tera type lets Corviknight retain its Flying typing even when using Roost, making it a more reliable check to Fissure users such as Dondozo and Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: The passive damage from Rocky Helmet against foes like Dragonite give Corviknight a much easier time using U-turn over Iron Head.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Since this Corviknight attempts to sweep, Sitrus Berry's burst of quick recovery can make it less pressured to spend a turn using Roost. Leftovers on the other hand, will still keep healing Corviknight even after being hit by Ruination, so it can make sense with Pressure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Maranga Berry</strong>: A Special Defense boost granted from Maranga Berry makes it far more difficult for foes like Flutter Mane to revenge kill Corviknight, and it can even be paired with Terastallization to defeat Raging Bolt!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: When paired with Taunt, Covert Cloak makes Corviknight an effective Garganacl check provided that it isn't Tera Ghost, though note Corviknight will no longer drop Flutter Mane's Special Attack with Mirror Armor.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: Mirror Armor means Flutter Mane can't use Mystical Fire without getting its Special Attack dropped, unless Corviknight is holding Covert Cloak.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Corviknight's ability to take powerful, low PP moves such as Close Combat after Iron Defense makes Pressure a viable alternative, in addition to giving Corviknight a better chance of dealing with Ruination from Ting-Lu effectively.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 SpD with Impish</strong> The Special Defense investment stops Iron Bundle from 2HKOing Corviknight with Hydro Pump, especially useful if revenge killing one with Body Press. Just remember that Encore means Corviknight is still vulnerable to Iron Bundle ruining set up attempts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 20 Def / 236 SpD with Careful</strong>: While Body Press will be significantly weaker on this specially defensive spread, it does avoid a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball, making this spread especially effective with Iron Head and Mirror Armor.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Bulk Up giving an Attack boost, Corviknight is free from having to use Body Press for good damage output, making it easier to run Taunt against defensive foes without fear of being walled by Ghost-types like Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head versus Brave Bird</strong>: Iron Head reliably 2HKOs Chien-Pao without a boost and is a fantastic tool against Flutter Mane, while Brave Bird is a great response against Ogerpon-H and the only hope of 2HKOing Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physically Defensive versus Specially Defensive</strong>: Physically Defensive Corviknight takes on common Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite and Urshifu-R more comfortably, while focusing on Special Defense stops Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane from 2HKOing Corviknight with Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Power Trip</strong>: Power Trip takes several boosts to get powerful, but it's Corviknight's best shot at dealing decent damage to Gholdengo. It also makes Corviknight a viable option on Baton Pass Blaziken teams, especially since it relies less on Terastallization to defeat Dark-types than Latias.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Remember that most of Corviknight's good Tera types leave it vulnerable to Toxic, so Terastallize carefully and only win a win condition is clear.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is an effective tool against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, though note that Choice Specs Chi-Yu can OHKO with Tera Fire boosted Overheat. It also prevents Urshifu-R from revenge killing Corviknight with Tera-boosted Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: This Tera type lets Corviknight retain its Flying typing while using Roost, meaning Fissure users such as Dondozo are much easier to handle, and giving Brave Bird a healthy boost in power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Once Fairy-, Ice-, and Dragon-types are out of the way, the Dragon Tera type allows Corviknight to turn the tables on most Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: There are few better Tera-types to use against Ogerpon-H than Tera Fire, which unlike Tera Dragon, will retain an important Fairy resistance. It does make Urshifu-R a huge problem as a drawback.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: If using Power Trip, Tera Dark is highly recommended to boost its damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: In addition to punishing Flutter Mane for using Mystical Fire when not using Covert Cloak, Mirror Armor stops pivoting Intimidate foes like Landorus-T and Incineroar from softening Corviknight's damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Pressure is a reasonable alternative for whittling down PP, which can be especially helpful against Ting-Lu's troublesome Ruination.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: When paired with Taunt, Corviknight can effectively take down Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Sitrus Berry is preferred due to the quicker burst of recovery better fitting a sweeper, but Leftovers can work very well with Pressure in an attempt to out-stall Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Maranga Berry</strong>: Maranga Berry's Special Defense boost can stop Special Attacking foes like Flutter Mane from 2HKOing physically defensive Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also forces opponents to use recovery moves or switch out, allowing Dragapult's teammates to get in and set up safely. Curse is Dragapult’s best option to bypass Substitute, Protect, and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: This breaks Focus Sash, hits Ghosts like Gholdengo and Flutter Mane that normally threaten it, and breaks Mimikyu's Disguise. Notably Gholdengo stops Curse with Good as Gold, making Dragapult totally helpless against it if it does not carry Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Darts</strong>: Dragon Darts can be used for more power to make Dragapult more self-sufficient when it has to stay on the field, and breaks Focus Sash as well. Its dual-hit nature makes it bypass most Substitutes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers. In tandem with Reflect, this can be a potent strategy to allow the next Pokemon to set up nearly risk-free.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Very Situational</strong>: As a dual screens lead, Terastallizing can compromise its teammates sweeping abilities, so it should only be done in emergencies.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost / Dragon</strong>: If you are in a bad spot, Ghost and Dragon power up its STAB move of choice.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: A defensive typing like Steel can allow Dragapult to survive certain moves like Iron Bundle's Ice Beam, boosted Cloyster's Icicle Spear, and boosted Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush and retaliate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy Tera type is useful for enemy Infiltrator Dragapult's Dragon Darts.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: While Light Clay is standard, Focus Sash nearly guarantees setting at least one screen without having to Terastallize, in the event Dragapult leads off against Choice Scarf users like Gholdengo, Hydreigon, and Meowscarada.</li> </ul>"

Black Glasses gives a slightly stronger boost, while Punching Glove helps to protect Urshifu-S from contact effects like Rocky Helmet and Zapdos's Static.

Drain Punch is usually preferred for bulkier Punching Glove sets to improve Urshifu-R's survivability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: Aqua Jet is perfect for picking off weakened foes that are faster than Urshifu-R, such as Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: With Swords Dance, Urshifu-R becomes far more difficult to wall by its defensive checks, though Dondozo is a notable exception.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner versus Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Spinner is more powerful when not using Punching Glove, and it also ruins terrain set up from the likes of Miraidon and Rillaboom. Ice Punch should always be used with Punching Glove, as it prevents Rocky Helmets users like Dragonite from passively wearing Urshifu-R down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute with Punching Glove let's Urshifu-R take advantage of Alomomola that try to wear down Urshifu-R with Rocky Helmet, and is also effective at foiling slower status users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the preferred nature for giving Urshifu-R as much breaking power as possible. Maximizing Speed with Jolly is often not needed for most matchups, but it does surpass some key targets in Jolly Mimikyu, Jolly Gliscor, and Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Bulk Up</strong>: Bulk Up takes advantage of Urshifu-R's underrated physical bulk, but it's far less consistent against powerful special attackers like Miraidon and Calyrex-S.</li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: Punching Gloves protects Urshifu-R from taking devastating damage by hitting Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin with Surging Strikes, in addition to boosting other punching moves. Just note that these moves will now be blocked by Protect and other variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: While it might seem strange with Urshifu-R's good physical bulk, Focus Sash lets it survive extremely powerful physical moves such as Chien-Pao's Electric Tera Blast without investing in bulk, as well as letting it survive powerful special attackers from Flutter Mane, Miraidon, and Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protective Pads</strong>: Protective Pads are a niche alternative to Punching Glove, not boosting any attacks but letting Surging Strikes bypass Protective moves from foes like Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Urshifu-R is able to function perfectly fine without Terastallization, though it has both offensive and defensive uses for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Tera Water boost to Surging Strikes makes Urshifu-R even more difficult to wall, with even Ting-Lu that lack Sitrus Berry being OHKOed by +2 Surging Strikes. It also makes Aqua Jet a more effective cleaning move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal is often paired with Punching Glove to block Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S, potentially letting it get off a devastating Surging Strikes against it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar with Adamant is notable not only for taking advantage of Urshifu-R's great offensive coverage, but also because Tera Stellar Close Combat into Tera Stellar Aqua Jet will OHKO offensive Miraidon variants.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternate EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>108 HP / 252 Atk / 148 Def with Adamant</strong>: Not only does this EV spread maintain maximum power, but the physical bulk let's Urshifu-R survive Adamant Chien-Pao's super-effective Tera Blast 87.5% of the time.</li> </ul>"

That being said, with high Speed and priority attacks being so prevalent in the current climate, Aqua Jet can still find a place on Choice Scarf sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Urshifu-R greatly appreciates having a move that prevents it from being walled by Dragonite, and it can also foil terrain-based strategies from Miraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf versus Choice Band</strong>: Choice Scarf transforms Urshifu-R into an effective revenge killer, outspeeding important threats such as Chien-Pao, unboosted Miraidon, and Flutter Mane that lack Booster Energy.

With Choice Band, Surging Strikes becomes practically unwallable by anything that doesn't resist it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal with Choice Band can blindside offensive Calyrex-S that attack with Astral Barrage, letting Urshifu-R handily dispatch it with Surging Strikes.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternate EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>108 HP / 252 Atk / 148 Def with Adamant</strong>: When using Choice Band Urshifu, this spread's physical bulk can be worth it against Tera Blast Electric from Chien-Pao, surviving 87.5% of the time.</li> </ul>"

It deals significant damage even when uninvested and slams Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: This combination helps get the most out of Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery while burning as many turns as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes Support</strong>: This set benefits immensely from Toxic Spikes, which allows Calyrex-I to stall for damage when Leech Seed isn't active. Clodsire is the most common partner utilized for this, as its high special bulk is a great compliment to Calyrex-I's physical bulk.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: In order to take full advantage of its bulk against threats like Koraidon, Calyrex-I will need Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water's Fire-type resistance makes shouldering Koraidon's Flare Blitz a breeze, and the Water-type resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes makes Substitute a lot more effective.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong> Tera Fire is another good way to weaken Koraidon's Flare Blitz while simultaneously making it much harder for Ogerpon-H to check Calyrex-I.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>15 or lower Speed IV or 20 Speed EVs</strong>: While optional, a low enough Speed IV makes it so that slow Alomomola's Flip Turn will always go first, letting Calyrex-I hit the incoming target with Leech Seed instead.

High Horsepower also has decent type synergy with Glacial Lance and doesn't immediately require Terastallization, but Unaware Dondozo becomes almost impossible to break.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: Swords Dance can be used to supercharge a Trick Room sweep, making Calyrex-I much harder to stall out.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: While Encore is difficult to fit, the unique pairing of Encore with Trick Room allows Calyrex-I punish a wide range of status users that it couldn't before.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icicle Spear and Bullet Seed with Loaded Dice</strong>: Calyrex-I does have the option to run a Loaded Dice offensive set that is less reliant on Terastallization.

However, this does come with the risk of Miraidon or Rillaboom weakening Expanding Force with their own Terrain.</li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Despite Calyrex-S's reasonable bulk, Focus Sash is an excellent item for reducing the pressure for it to Terastallize, in addition to potentially revenge killing powerful adversaries like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Booster Energy Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb makes Calyrex-S less reliant on boosts to clean teams, at the cost of being more vulnerable to priority from the likes of Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: If using Calm Mind, Leftovers is a reasonable option for increased longevity, especially if it is getting free turns with Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry severely punishes bulky users of Yawn such as Ursaluna-B and Hippowdon, as well as stopping Booster Energy Flutter Mane from hitting Tera Fairy Calyrex-S with Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spell Tag</strong>: While mostly outclassed by Life Orb, Spell Tag makes sense if another teammate needs Life Orb more.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li><strong>20 HP / 4 Def / 220 SpA / 12 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread is to be used with Calm Mind, allowing Calyrex-S to withstand Timid Choice Specs Miraidon's Electro Drift after a boost.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency: Medium / Low</strong>: Calyrex-S's typing makes it extremely vulnerable to Sucker Punch from the likes of Chien-Pao and faster Ghost-type attacks from foes like Booster Energy Flutter Mane, making Terastallization a gateway into opening up sweeps. However, if using Focus Sash, this becomes less important.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy Calyrex-S's crown jewel for Tera types, giving it a key resistance to Dark, as well as turning Draining Kiss into a reasonable secondary armament.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a good alternative to Tera Fairy because it offers similar advantages against Dark-types with the bonus of dealing massive damage to Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu with Tera Blast, as well as not being weak to Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While a more niche Tera type due to its lack of offensive benefits, Tera Normal can be paired with Encore to ambush Ghost-type revenge killers like Flutter Mane and opposing Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost makes Astral Barrage into a terrifying sweeping move, but the lack of any defensive benefits makes it a niche option, especially when not using Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>As One combines with a Choice item to either turn Calyrex-S into a revenge killer or potent cleaner.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock versus Psychic</strong>: Psyshock is usually the best option for a secondary STAB move, since it allows even Choice Scarf Calyrex-S to usually 2HKO Blissey, a problem for Calyrex-S on stall teams otherwise. Psychic is much stronger against Koraidon though, with Choice Scarf sets being able to OHKO offensive Koraidon that aren't Terastallized with it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draining Kiss versus Tera Blast</strong>: Despite its low Base Power, Draining Kiss is still enough to cleave through Chien-Pao and restores a good amount of HP when using Tera Fairy. However, Tera Blast's higher Base Power makes it a reasonable alternative for this set, with Tera Blast Fairy letting Choice Scarf Calyrex-S 2HKO Chi-Yu in particular.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick is an effective way of punishing Calyrex-S's more defensive checks, with Ting-Lu in particular loathing it. Just note that most Blissey can get around Trick by using Fling, so this is not entirely reliable against stall teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf versus Choice Specs</strong>: Calyrex-S's insane Speed might make Choice Scarf seem like overkill, but gaining the ability to outspeed Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, as well as Speed-boosted Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, is an extremely rare and valuable quality for a Choice Scarf revenge killer. Choice Specs is still worth considering for its impressive wallbreaking power though, especially since Psyshock cleanly 2HKOes Blissey.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Future Sight</strong>: Future Sight is an interesting tool against defensive teams, as if you force out special walls with strong physical Pokemon, Calyrex-S's Future Sight is likely to deal a huge amount of damage to their response later!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Expanding Force</strong>: If using Calyrex-S on a Psychic Surge team with Indeedee-M, Expanding Force outdamages even Astral Barrage! Just note that Miraidon and Rillaboom are common enough that maintaining the boosted Expanding Force can be tricky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Nasty Plot or Calm Mind</strong>: If using Trick, it's feasible to carry a setup move over a Psychic-type STAB move, especially if certain defensive foes like Ting-Lu have been saddled with it. However, setting up still should not be the main purpose of this set, as Encore does a better job of facilitating that.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency: High</strong>: With no Encore or Focus Sash to get around this, Calyrex-S's Dark and Ghost weaknesses are highly exploitable, meaning Terastallization is often key to stopping a revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is the best crown to be wearing against Dark-types like Chien-Pao, making Draining Kiss viable as a bonus.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is an alternative to Fairy, making Calyrex-S more vulnerable to Flutter Mane in exchange for OHKOing Chi-Yu with Tera Blast. Just note that being locked into Tera Blast Fighting is a problem against other Ghost-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal is a niche option, since it provides no offensive benefit, but it can be useful for Choice Specs Calyrex-S to dodge an OHKO from Choice Scarf Calyrex-S and Flutter Mane with a Speed boost.</p> </li> </ul>"

Kleavor being faster means it'll even outpace Dragonite's Extreme Speed!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: While Kleavor isn't known for easily sweeping, it's fast enough to outspeed Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle after Trailblaze, and Trailblaze is especially useful when using Tera Grass against Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>X-Scissor versus Close Combat</strong>: While X-Scissor's coverage on paper isn't impressive, the boost from Sharpness lets it 2HKO Cresselia and Ting-Lu that lack Sitrus Berry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: If using Feint, Adamant is the best nature choice for maximizing the amount of targets it can pick off after using Stone Axe. For Trailblaze variants, Jolly is preferred to outspeed Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and even Dragapult. Jolly also ensures it outspeeds all Gholdengo that lack Choice Scarf.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Tailwind</strong>: Tailwind is an unusual move for Battle Stadium Singles, but Kleavor's disposable nature with Focus Sash can make it justified as a move to use before fainting.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Kleavor's entry hazard setting nature may not make Terastallization seem important, but its archnemesis, Urshifu-R, makes it worth considering, since it can threaten to OHKO Kleavor through its Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a good response against Urshifu-R, not only resisting its deadly Surging Strikes, but also boosting Trailblaze.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water isn't as offensively useful, but it's still a good way to resist both Surging Strikes and powerful Steel-type attacks like Heatran's Flash Cannon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug isn't great defensively, but it allows Kleavor to 2HKO even Impish Sitrus Berry Ting-Lu with X-Scissor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Despite Kleavor's resistance to Extreme Speed, Dragonite often picks off Focus Sash variants, so Tera Ghost is a huge shock for it, though a rather risky Terastallization choice. It also blocks Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, even if it's not particularly common.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash makes Kleavor a good lead against a wide variety of foes such as Iron Bundle and lets it easily justify the maximum Speed investment needed to outspeed Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Kleavor's special bulk is mediocre at best, but Stone Axe's entry hazard setting powers can justify using Assault Vest to survive certain attacks that are otherwise impossible without Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Assault Vest EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>28 HP / 204 Atk / 4 Def / 204 SpD / 68 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This more specially bulky spread usually survives Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera Fairy Moonblast, and Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash while outspeeding Garchomp after one use of Trailblaze.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>28 HP / 108 Atk / 4 Def / 204 SpD / 164 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread has enough Speed to outspeed Iron Bundle after using Trailblaze once while usually surviving Timid Tera Fairy Choice Specs Moonblast from Flutter Mane, Non-Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, and Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 52 Atk / 4 Def / 244 SpD / 68 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This more extreme spread usually lets Kleavor survive even Timid Gholdengo's Make It Rain, almost always avoids a 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse, and avoids an OHKO from Adamant Life Orb Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash while still outspeeding Garchomp after one use of Trailblaze.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: While very rare, Cute Charm Enamorus can potentially impact Kleavor, meaning there are no drawbacks to using a female gender.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Flame Orb, Guts, and an incredible Attack stat, Ursaluna is an extremely brutal wallbreaker!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Headlong Rush</strong>: Earthquake is an easier move to recommend, avoiding contact with Rocky Helmet and preserving Ursaluna's hefty bulk. However, Headlong Rush's extra power can better fit the playstyles of Ursaluna that may aim for a sweep rather than just wallbreaking, such as Trick Room and Jolly variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch versus Close Combat</strong>: Drain Punch doesn't offer much extra coverage, but it's Ursaluna's only decent way of restoring health. Close Combat's sheer power does make it decent coverage though and can particularly punish Heatran for Terastallizing into a Grass-type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch versus Play Rough</strong>: Once Ursaluna is burned, Ice Punch will deal so much damage to Dragonite that even the bulkiest sets can not restore all their health with Roost. Play Rough isn't nearly as effective against Dragonite, but when used with Tera Fairy, Ursaluna can now OHKO Urshifu-R before Flame Orb kicks in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: While Ursaluna is powerful, it needs the Flame Orb activation to truly wallbreak, so Protect can help when switching it in isn't easy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulk Up versus Swords Dance</strong>: Bulk Up is the prefered setup move for making Ursaluna difficult to revenge kill with physical attacks, but Swords Dance does offer some truly absurd wallbreaking potential, allowing Ursaluna to OHKO even physically defensive Ting-Lu with Facade! Swords Dance can also be a better fit on Trick Room teams due to the limited amount of turns Ursaluna has to sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: If using Jolly Ursaluna, Trailblaze lets it outspeed key threats such as Zapdos, both Urshifu formes, Mimikyu, and even Speed tie with Timid Thundurus-T!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Ursaluna benefits from Terastallization, but it's not integral to its wallbreaking prowess.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Beyond getting rid of Ground's annoying weaknesses, Tera Normal turns Ursaluna into an even more fearsome wallbreaker,</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy does a great job of protecting Ursaluna from powerful Fighting-type attacks and Dragonite's Outrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While Tera Ghost does make the matchup against Flutter Mane and Gholdengo worse, the Fighting immunity can turn a match around in the blink of an eye.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is the prime Tera type to use when in need of an Ice and Water resistance, which is helpful against Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: If using Drain Punch, Tera Fighting is a reasonable option for restoring even more health, at the cost of being rather weak against Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Gass is a niche option that lets Ursaluna deal extra damage with Trailblaze while resisting Water-type attacks and taking Spore before Flame Orb activates.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Brave and a 0 Speed IV versus Adamant</strong>: On a Trick Room team, this lets Ursaluna underspeed some major Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Dondozo. However, some Trick Room teams may still prefer Adamant to outspeed such slow Pokemon if they also function outside Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 SpD with Adamant or Brave</strong>: This more specially defensive EV spread survives some powerful attacks even after burn damage, including Timid Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Thundurus-T's Grass Knot, Timid Greninja's Hydro Pump, and Modest Chi-Yu's Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximizing Speed may seem strange on such a slow Pokemon, but Ursaluna makes fantastic use of it, making Trailblaze viable due to outspeeding even offensive variants of Zapdos after a boost and letting it wallbreak common Pokemon that often don't invest in enough Speed such as Dragonite and Heatran.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: Since Ursaluna uses contact moves, a female gender will prevent it from being attracted to the rare Cute Charm Enamorus.</li> </ul>"

It can hit Gholdengo due to Mind's Eye.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong>: Earth Power gives great coverage against the Steel-types that resist Blood Moon, making Ursaluna-B nearly unwallable except by non-grounded Steel-types like Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Voice</strong>: Hyper Voice is a more spammable Normal-type STAB move that can bypass Substitute, allowing Ursaluna-B to thwart attempts to Substitute stall out Blood Moon, like Tera Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest remedies Ursaluna-B's middling Special Defense, allowing this slow but hard-hitting Pokemon to survive longer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Silk Scarf</strong>: Silk Scarf can be used instead of Assault Vest to boost the power of Ursaluna-B’s Normal-type STAB attacks, making it more difficult to switch into, though this makes match-ups against Special Attackers like Flutter Mane shakier.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: If using Ursaluna-B on a Trick Room team, Life Orb can be worth the recoil for the highest possible chance of sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash may sound absurd with Ursaluna-B's bulk, but it can allow more offensive variants to turn the tables on extremely powerful Special Attackers like Choice Specs Chi-Yu, and more easily justify faster EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Assault Vest EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>36 HP / 228 SpA / 244 SpD with Modest</strong>: This spread survives an opposing Life Orb Ursaluna-B's Tera Normal Blood Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 HP / 164 SpA / 244 SpD with Modest</strong>: This spread survives Timid Tera Water Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, even if Ursaluna-B doesn't Terastallize!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 52 Def / 196 SpA / 12 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread will never be OHKOed by Adamant Choice Scarf Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes unless it Terastallizes.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Item EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 4 Def / 132 SpA / 220 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This EV spread gives Ursaluna-B enough bulk to survive Tera boosted Choice Specs Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast on all but the highest damage roll, as well as the same odds for surviving Jolly Urshifu-R's Close Combat. If used with paralysis support, 32 EVs can be moved from Special Attack to Speed to outspeed paralyzed Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>20 HP / 4 Def / 172 SpA / 60 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong> This outspeeds up to -1 Speed Garchomp, and also often outspeeds Pokemon that focus on bulk such as Dragonite, Scizor, and Primarina.

Because many different Tera types are viable on it, it can play guessing games with opponents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal removes all weaknesses associated with Ursaluna-B’s Ground typing and boosts Blood Moon to phenomenal levels of power, making it ideal on Trick Room teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy allows Ursaluna-B to handle the Urshifu formes and Choice Band Dragon-types like Dragonite and Gouging Fire better while generally being a very solid defensive Tera type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison improves Ursaluna-B’s matchup against Flutter Mane, all Ogerpon formes' Horn Leech, and all Urshifu formes, while preventing Toxic from wearing Ursaluna-B down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water allows Ursaluna-B to fare better against the likes of Urshifu-R, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Hibernation (Yawn)": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Yawn doesn't transform Ursaluna-B into just a mere support Pokemon. When used in conjunction with Blood Moon, the bloodmoon beast becomes a master of putting offensive teams between a rock and a hard place: either the opponent's check falls asleep, or they switch out and something far less suited against Ursaluna-B gets shredded by Blood Moon!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Moonlight</strong>: Moonlight will require sacrificing either coverage or priority, but it makes Ursaluna-B far longer lasting and less vulnerable to lures like Grass Knot Landorus-T. It's a particularly strong choice on teams with strong hit-and-run Pokemon like Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vacuum Wave</strong>: While not amazingly powerful, Vacuum Wave is lovely for picking off Chien-Pao and cleaning up late-game in general. This is to the point where giving up reliable recovery can make sense for some more offensive teams that often can't afford to switch Ursaluna-B out often.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Leftovers is best paired with Moonlight, giving Ursaluna-B maximum longevity. If using Vacuum Wave, Sitrus Berry's quicker burst of recovery suits Ursaluna-B better and provides a better matchup against Urshifu-R. Sitrus Berry is also a reasonable alternative to Leftovers if another teammate needs it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The HP investment ensures Annihilape will not OHKO Ursaluna-B with Final Gambit, and the Defense EVs stop Choice Band Tera Water Urshifu-R from OHKOing Terastallized Ursaluna-B. This spread survives Modest Choice Scarf Chi-Yu's Overheat and Tera-boosted Moonblast from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane on all but the highest damage roll. Offensively, the Special Attack EVs ensure that Blood Moon OHKOes offensive Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>20 Speed EVs</strong>: 20 Speed EVs let Ursaluna-B outspeed paralyzed Adamant Urshifu formes at the cost of some bulk. This may seem to conflict with Yawn, but paralysis is often a viable secondary playstyle for teams with this set to deal with more offensive threats.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Ursaluna-B's typing is fairly good, but its weakness to common threats like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R mean Terastallization is often needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison has excellent synergy with Ursaluna-B's playstyle, not only granting it an important resistance to Urshifu-R's Close Combat and Flutter Mane's Moonblast but also ensuring that poison status will not wear it down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy doesn't help against Flutter Mane, but it does transform Ursaluna-B into a very strong Urshifu-S check, in addition to avoiding Choice Specs Latios's wrath.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal only helps defensively against Ice, Grass, and Water types, but the power boost to Blood Moon makes Ursaluna-B far more difficult to wall, with defensive Primarina in particular usually being put into Earth Power's KO range.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water offers a useful Ice resistance to flip Chien-Pao matchups more easily, but it doesn't help against Raging Bolt and Grass Knot users like Landorus-T.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its immense defensive profile and access to reliable recovery, Ursaluna-B lends itself very well to a Calm Mind set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Blood Moon</strong>: Even though the cool down time can be annoying for a Calm Mind set, the massive amount of power is still strongly recommended for being able to OHKO Urshifu-R without a boost using the given EV spread.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt can be used to shut down utility moves and attempts to stall out Ursaluna-B from the likes of Cresselia and slow Dragonite.</li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus berry allows Ursaluna-B to recover a significant chunk of health, which can be useful to set up boosts against special attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers improves Ursaluna-B's general longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Kee Berry</strong>: Kee Berry boosts Ursaluna-B's physical bulk, allowing it to keep pace with physical threats such as Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Despite its immense bulk, Ursaluna-B’s typing leaves it vulnerable to many common attacks, so a good defensive Tera type is essential for survivability and durability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy provides a good defensive typing that synergizes well with Ursaluna-B's natural weaknesses, allowing it to stick around.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison grants an immunity to Toxic, Making Toxic Spikes less of an issue. It also grants a Fighting resistance, allowing it to better handle Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal boosts the power of Blood Moon, which improves the matchup against opposing Calm Mind Flutter Mane. It leaves only a Fighting weakness, making Ursaluna-B quite hard to KO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water aids against both Chien-Pao and Choice Specs Gholdengo, in addition to being a great defensive typing in general.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Backed by Terastallization, Ursaluna-B can use its incredible physical bulk to wall even the mighty Koraidon!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Moonlight</strong>: Under Koraidon's sun, Moonlight's increased recovery makes Ursaluna-B that much harder to topple!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong>: Earth Power is strong against Steel-types like Scizor and Archaludon that otherwise resist Blood Moon, and it's also super effective against many of Koraidon's most popular Tera types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Voice</strong>: While it doesn't provide extra coverage, Hyper Voice is the best option to prevent Substitute Gliscor from completely shutting down Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vacuum Wave</strong>: Vacuum Wave is a solid option for picking off weakened threats, especially Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: Weaker physical attackers like Assault Vest Koraidon provide great opportunities to set up with Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: With full defensive investment and a neutral Tera type, a five-hit Scale Shot from +2 Koraidon only has about a 25% chance to OHKO. Even without Terastallization, this Ursaluna-B is so bulky that Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash into Ice Shard only has about a 6.25% chance to knock out Ursaluna-B! The leftover EVs are usually allocated to Speed; keep in mind that Ursaluna-B often Speed creeps, so reallocating some EVs for even a few more points in Speed can be useful in the mirror matchup.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet punishes many common attacks from Koraidon and Zacian-C, though Scale Shot from Koraidon is a notable exception.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry's burst recovery can be useful against Swords Dance Koraidon, guaranteeing that Ursaluna-B survives a +2 Scale Shot at five hits even if one of the hits is a critical hit.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Ursaluna-B has to change its typing in order to properly take on Koraidon and other physical threats it targets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire deters Koraidon from spamming its destructive Tera Fire Flare Blitz while remaining neutral against its powerful STAB attacks. Beyond that, it helps Ursaluna-B wall a litany of other physical threats like Calyrex-I, Zacian-C that lack an appropriate Tera Blast, Ogerpon-H, and Assault Vest Rillaboom. The Fairy-type resistance is also excellent against Flutter Mane, a common Koraidon teammate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Compared to Tera Fire, Tera Water is an alternative for resisting Koraidon's Flare Blitz that doesn't sacrifice Ground-type matchups like Landorus-T. It also helps Ursaluna-B against Urshifu-R when used against other types of teams. But without Tera Fire's Fairy-type resistance, Flutter Mane becomes harder to withstand if Ursaluna-B is not running Calm Mind, and Grass-types such as Ogerpon and Rillaboom will be much more threatening.</p> </li> </ul>"

When it's the last Pokemon standing, this vengeful attack will 2HKO almost anything that doesn't resist it at minimum, with the big exceptions being defensive Dragonite if Multiscale is intact and Dondozo if not using Life Orb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Endure and Custap Berry</strong>: Endure can be used to put Basculegion into Custap Berry's activation range against many powerful attacks, letting it fire off Last Respects on the top of its priority bracket. This can be a devastating surprise late-game, turning what could be a sure loss into new avenues to sweep!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn</strong>: Adaptability turns Flip Turn into a powerful pivoting move, giving Basculegion more utility early-game.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Fangs</strong>: While hitting Urshifu-R extra hard isn't a bad deal, the real use for Psychic Fangs is to get rid of dual screens that would otherwise stop Basculegion from sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Mold Breaker can be tempting for cleaving through Multiscale Dragonite, offensive Sturdy Archaludon, and the occasional Mimikyu with Last Respects, but Dragonite's habit of using Tera Normal and the big overall damage reduction makes it a rather niche option, especially since Mold Breaker announces its presence, removing any sort of surprise value.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb may compromise Basculegion's decent bulk, but it turns the fish into an absolute scourge against bulky Pokemon, with Last Respects now 2HKOing Dondozo at its maximum power and Tera Ghost even potentially 2HKOing defensive Dragonite through Mulitscale if it lacks Leftovers!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: When used with specialized EV spreads, Basculegion can send common revenge killers like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo to an early grave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Even with Wave Crash's recoil, Focus Sash is good for winning unexpected matchups against threats like Chi-Yu and Chien-Pao, though note that this item benefits best from a more specialized set.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>General EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>28 HP / 252 Atk / 228 Def with Adamant</strong>: This physically bulky EV spread survives Adamant Ogerpon-H's Horn Leech on all but the highest damage roll and does the same for Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon. It also always dodges a 2HKO from Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, usually survives +1 Jolly Dragonite's Scale Shot at five hits, and survives Jolly Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Def with Adamant</strong>: This spread always survives Adamant Ogerpon-H's Horn Leech but now has around a 19% chance of being OHKOed by Modest Ursaluna-B's Bloodmoon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Adamant</strong>: While maximizing Speed makes Basculegion notably frail, it does outspeed some otherwise troublesome foes like Modest Raging Bolt, although it needs to watch out for Thunderclap, and the rare but deadly Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave Nature</strong> Reducing Basculegion's Speed can give it an edge in mirror matches when used on Trick Room teams with setters like Porygon2 and Mimikyu, but note that going as far as using a Speed IV of 0 can harm Basculegion's matchups against normally slower foes like Scizor, Primarina, and Corviknight, so using a Speed IV of 31 is the most flexible option.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Assault Vest EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 172 Def / 68 SpD / 12 Spe</strong>: This bulky spread avoids an OHKO from Jolly Ogerpon-H's Horn Leech, survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball, and outspeeds paralyzed Adamant Dragonite even after one Dragon Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>212 Atk / 244 Def / 52 SpD</strong>: This spread survives all but the highest damage from Adamant Ogerpon-H's Horn Leech and Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball at the cost of some Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 Atk / 68 SpD / 196 Spe</strong>: This avoids an OHKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball while still outspeeding Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is a more double-edged sword than usual due to Adaptability, which only gives its damage bonus if Basculegion's current typing matches the attack. Because of this, while Terastallizing makes sense for Basculegion, it will lower the power of at least some of its attacks!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy trades Basculegion's wallbreaking power for a defense against Dark-types. With Tera Blast, this can even stop Urshifu-S!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water makes Aqua Jet into a potent late-game cleaning tool and lets Basculegion survive most Choice Specs Flutter Mane attacks as a bonus, with the exception of rare variants with Thunderbolt or Tera Blast Stellar.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost transforms Last Respects into a truly outrageous wallbreaking attack when Basculegion is the last fish swimming, with even Dondozo taking over 50% from it!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a more niche option against Dark-types, leaving Basculegion vulnerable to Fairy-type attacks in exchange for a stronger matchup against Archaludon and Urshifu-S via Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Don't Use Tera Stellar!</strong>: Basculegion may seem like a perfect candidate for Tera Stellar, but don't be fooled: Adaptability has no interactions with the Stellar-type, making it completely useless unless using the niche Mold Breaker!</p> </li> </ul>"

If Life Orb is needed elsewhere, Focus Sash can be a reasonable shift in focus, making Basculegion easier to use outside of rain, which makes benching Pelipper for some matchups easier to justify.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Liquidation or Waterfall</strong>: Wave Crash's constant recoil wears Basculegion down quickly, so Liquidation saves Bascluegion's scales if a foe is already in its KO range. Waterfall is a tad weaker, but the 20% chance to flinch can lead to huge upsets in a battle!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rain Dance</strong>: Setting up Rain Dance usually shouldn't be a job for Basculegion, but it does severely punish Torkoal's attempt to change weather.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Basculegion can function without Terastalliztion, its often the star sweeper of rain teams, making it a likely choice to Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water boosts Wave Crash to truly obscene power, with offensive Roaring Moon in particular being OHKOed 75% of the time by Adamant Wave Crash!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy not only saves Basculegion from Sucker Punch foes like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S, but it also shreds Roaring Moon if it doesn't Terastallize with Tera Blast Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar is a flexible method for sweeping, with the one-time boost to Last Respects reaping Urshifu-R's soul when Basculegion is the lone teammate alive!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While it doesn't have amazing synergy with rain, Tera Ghost still boosts Last Respects into a ghoulish wallbreaking tool regardless of the weather, being particularly useful against Urshifu-R, defensive Primarina, and Dondozo</p> </li> </ul>"

If doing this, seriously consider Tera Blast to rip Dark-types to shreds.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Don't Use Tera Stellar!</strong>: Tera Stellar is a siren song, having no impact on Basculegion's power at all due to Adaptability's mechanics.</p> </li> </ul>"

It's also a guaranteed OHKO vs. Calyrex-S that have not Terastallized.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acrobatics</strong> - Acrobatics is a natural pairing with Unburden, providing a massively powerful Flying-type attack once Sneasler's item is used.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fake Out</strong>: With a Normal Gem, Fake Out offers both good chip damage and the ability to safely activate Unburden.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: While it requires sacrificing a STAB attack or coverage move, Substitute helps Sneasler set up on threats such as Thunder Wave Porygon2 and Salt Cure Garganacl, as well as scout for surprise Terastallizations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Throat Chop</strong>: A slightly more powerful alternative to Shadow Claw, especially when used with a Dark Tera Type. However, it's more vulnerable to Calyrex-S Terastallizing into a Fairy-type.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / High</strong>: While Sneasler's offensive prowess is naturally strong, its average bulk and unique typing can cause serious matchup issues. Terastallization is excellent for patching up both.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gives Sneasler an immunity to Ground-type attacks, allowing it to set up on foes such as Landorus while also boosting the power of Acrobatics even further. If using terrain support, however, be warned that any benefit besides Seed activation will be lost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost grants Sneasler an immunity to Extreme Speed, notably allowing it to more consistently beat Dragonite. It does make Sneasler weak to Sucker Punch, but this weakness can be counteracted if using Psychic Terrain support.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: When used alongside Tera Blast, Tera Ice allows Sneasler to more reliably beat foes like Landorus-T and Dragonite, and deal massive damage to common Dragon-types such as Koraidon and Miraidon.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Electric Seed</strong>: Electric Seed allows for instant Unburden activation when paired with Miraidon. Keep in mind that Dire Claw will not put grounded foes to sleep while Electric Terrain is active.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Seed</strong>: When running Sneasler with Indeedee-M's Psychic Surge support, Psychic Seed allows for instant Unburden activation. The Special Defense Boost also helps against heavy hitters like Flutter Mane and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal Gem</strong>: When combined with Fake Out, Sneasler can activate Unburden efficiently and without extra support.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grassy Seed</strong>: Grassy Seed allows for instant Unburden activation when paired with Rillaboom. The Defense Boost and halved damage from Earthquake especially helps against Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>White Herb</strong>: While less easily activated, not relying on a specific move to activate Unburden allows Sneasler to diversify its move selection more, becoming more of a threat.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>36 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 212 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread will outspeed up to Timid Choice Scarf Calyrex-S upon activating Unburden, while maximizing attack. The 36 EVs in HP maximize recovery from Grassy Terrain.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Focus Sash, Sneasler can go all-in on high-powered disruption!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Claw</strong>: Shadow Claw is Sneasler's most reliable coverage move into Gholdengo, as well as a way to OHKO Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Toxic Spikes is a great support option as a lead, allowing Sneasler to build momentum for its teammates by disrupting bulkier foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fake Out</strong>: Not only does Fake Out help break Focus Sash and Multiscale, but the free attack gives an extra chance for Poison Touch to activate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Running an Adamant nature maximizes power while still outspeeding threats such as Jolly Garchomp. Running a Jolly nature will let Sneasler outspeed up to Jolly Roaring Moon.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Fire Punch</strong>: Fire Punch can OHKO maximum HP Scizor, which can otherwise bypass Focus Sash with Technician Dual Wingbeat.</li> </ul> <h4>Abilities</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Poison Touch</strong>: Poison Touch gives Sneasler extra chances to cripple threats, especially when paired with Fake Out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Unburden</strong>: If wanting to maximize your chances of paralyzing or putting a target to sleep with Dire Claw, Unburden should be used over Poison Touch. The extra Speed can also be helpful for turning the tables on speedy foes like Calyrex-S and Miraidon, but Sneasler's Focus Sash is not always in danger of being consumed against more passive Pokemon such as Alomomola.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While there are unique cases where Terastallization is useful, this set tends to do just fine without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost can surprise Extreme Speed Dragonite trying to revenge kill Sneasler, and the boost to Shadow Claw is a big help against Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting takes Sneasler's strongest STAB attack in Close Combat and pushes it even farther.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar is a great way to take advantage of Sneasler's diverse offensive options without losing its unique typing. With an Adamant nature, the one-time boost to Shadow Claw guarantees a 2HKO on maximum HP Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a situational option that gives Dire Claw a much-needed boost, and maintaining Sneasler's original Poison typing will let it absorb Toxic Spikes later if needed.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its good Attack, Speed, and access to Flower Trick and Knock Off, Meowscarada is a potent cleaner that is also hard to switch into.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flower Trick</strong>: With its guaranteed critical hit, Flower Trick is a dangerous cleaning move once resistances to it have been sufficiently chipped.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: If using Protean, Meowscarada is a pivot that does far more damage than most users of U-turn, and helps Choice Scarf Meowscarada get out of some tricky early-game situations such as Serperior leads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick can help Choice-locked sets incapacitate an annoying wall, such as Corviknight or Dondozo, by locking them into a single move. It also has the bonus of Protean letting Meowscarada resist Fighting-type attacks after using it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Triple Axel</strong>: Triple Axel may not be the most reliable move out there, but it strikes fear into the heart of Dragonite and offensive Mimikyu, who can both be big offensive issues for Meowscarda.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly versus Adamant</strong>: Jolly is usually preferred for for the speed tie in mirror matches, but Adamant 's extra power can be justified on Choice Scarf since it still outspeeds boosted Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band versus Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Band boosted Meowscarada hits incredibly hard, and with its naturally high Speed it can serve as a cleaner and a potential wallbreaker, especially against common Defense-boosting foes such as Bulk Up Annihilape and Tera Fairy Archaludon. With the Speed offered via Choice Scarf, Meowscarada can threaten otherwise faster foes, such as Dragapult and +1 Garchomp, potentially putting more pressure on offensive teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protean versus Overgrow</strong>: Protean’s type-shifting allows Meowscarada to make the most of its colorful movepool, particularly on Choice-locked sets, where the limitation to only changing types once is effectively nullified. If you intend to make use of a Tera type other than Grass or Stellar, Overgrow is worth considering, as it allows Meowscarada more flexibility with its moves by not changing type and removing STAB from Flower Trick or Knock Off.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Play Rough</strong>: Compared to Triple Axel, Play Rough isn't nearly as good at handling Dragon-types besides Hydreigon, but it does stop Terastallized Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur from grabbing a Speed boost with Scale Shot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch</strong>: Sucker Punch is a strong priority attack, but it can be rather risky with a Choice item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brick Break</strong>: Low Kick's superior damage output against Ursaluna-B usually makes it the better Fighting-type coverage, but with Choice Band, Brick Break still OHKOes Kingambit and breaks Alolan Ninetales's Aurora Veil.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Terastallization overriding Protean means Meowscarada should usually only Terastallize to clean a weakened team late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: While Terastallizing does override Protean, Tera Grass Meowscarada can be used to power through teams ill-prepared for it. Dual screens teams in particular are especially vulnerable to the sheer power of Choice Band-boosted Tera Grass Flower Trick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosted Knock Off isn't as reliable at sweeping as Flower Trick, but it can surprise bulky Steel-types such as Scizor and Archaludon, as well as deal incredible damage to bulky Volcarona.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost is a defensive option to stop Dragonite's Extreme Speed from revenge killing Meowscarada.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar's one-time boost per attack can give Meowscarada more flexible cleaning options. If Meowscarada Terastallizes after using Protean, the type it currently is will get the double base power boost, which can lead to unexpectedly powerful coverage moves!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives Meowscarada a Will-O-Wisp immunity and Fire resistance to combat bulky Volcarona.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternate EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>76 HP / 228 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 92 Speed with Jolly</strong>: This bulkier Choice Scarf spread allows Meowscarada to outspeed Jolly Garchomp while avoiding an OHKO from Breloom's Mach Punch and Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</li> </ul> <h4>Minor Optimizations</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Neutral Natures and Trick</strong>: Make sure to use a neutral nature and use a Jolly or Adamant Mint on Meowscarada, so it won't get confused by eating any Berry after Trick.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its good Speed and wide movepool, Meowscarada makes for a potent lead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Triple Axel</strong>: Triple Axel prevents Meowscarada from getting set-up on by Dragonite, and ruins Garchomp and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch</strong>: Sucker Punch allows Meowscarada to better handle fast foes such as Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Meowscarada is an excellent offensive choice to lay Toxic Spikes, since it puts immense pressure on Ursaluna-B leads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Low Kick</strong>: Low Kick is Meowscarada's only way through Kingambit, with the bonus of dealing immense damage to Tera Normal Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protean versus Overgrow</strong>: Protean offers the most offensive flexibility. For more supportive sets with Toxic Spikes, Overgrow lets it keep STAB on its attacks after it uses its support moves.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Thanks to its good Speed, Meowscarada makes particularly excellent use of Taunt, though two big targets, Archaludon and Annihilape, will put Meowscarada in immense danger.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Play Rough</strong>: While Triple Axel deals with most Dragon-types better, Play Rough can be a huge upset against Terastallized Scale Shot users like Dragonite and Garchomp!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Meowscarada has very little use for Terastallization, only using it in late-game situations where it can sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: When paired with an Overgrow boost, Tera Grass lets Flower Trick deal a huge amount of damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark makes Knock Off even more difficult to switch into, especially hitting Volcarona hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar is the more flexible option for late-game sweeping. Just remember that moves only get the double BP boost if they match Meowscarada's current typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost saves Meowscarada from Normal-type priority, which can flip the match on unsuspecting Dragonite!</p> </li> </ul>"

This is usually the preferred coverage move if using Skeledirge on a stall team.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute is a good way around status, especially Garganacl's Salt Cure. It also becomes effective when used on Toxic Spikes teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Encore</strong>: When paired with Substitute, Skeledirge can seriously punish passive Pokemon, though at a serious cost in coverage.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Skeledirge's defensive typing isn't without its merits, but the wide variety of weaknesses it has often forces Skeledirge to Terastallize to check major threats like Chien-Pao and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Terastallizing into the Fairy typing removes Skeledirges glaring weakness to Dark and provides an overall superior defensive typing, making Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu far more reasonable to deal with. It also provides a neutral typing for the inevitable Shadow Balls that will be thrown at Skeledirge, like from Flutter Mane or Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: A Water Tera type lets Skeledirge take on opposing Water-type attacks, providing a valuable turn to burn foes like Urshifu-R. It should be noted that Tera Water tends to be a safer option versus the common Gholdengo, as it does not often run Thunderbolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While Tera Normal isn't fantastic defensively, it lets Skeledirge severely punish attempts from special attacking Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo to check it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: A Dragon Tera type let's Skeledirge check Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-H simultaneously, though it will likely need help from teammates covering its newfound Fairy-type weakness.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Residual recovery helps Skeledirge use Torch Song more freely. Leftovers is the best option since Skeledirge has instant recovery, but Sitrus Berry with an even HP stat can be used to restore some health after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ability Shield</strong>: Ability Shield keeps Unaware active in the face of Mold Breaker users like Swords Dance Ogerpon-H, which can overwhelm Skeledirge with enough boosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak ignores the secondary effects of Garganacl's Salt Cure as well as stopping stat drops from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball and Ogerpon-H's Rock Tomb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: This makes Skeledirge less pressured to Terastallize to rid itself of its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a superb special stat line, Seed Sower, and good moveset coverage, Arboliva can be a deceptively strong and long-living Assault Vest user!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Seed Sower</strong>: Once activated, Grassy Terrain’s passive recovery and boosting of Grass-type attacks like Giga Drain can help Arboliva survive longer than expected. Grassy Terrain also halving Earthquake’s power is greatly appreciated by bulky teammates like Skeledirge, Arcanine, and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: This move keeps Arboliva from becoming setup bait against foes like offensive Dragonite, and is also your best move into Wo-Chien before Tera.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast is a great option for hitting types that Arboliva lacks natural coverage for. Tera Fire lets Arboliva hit Steel-types like Scizor and Tera Electric punishes Tera Flying users like Gholdengo. Both Tera Fire and Tera Electric cover Corviknight as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: This set’s massive special bulk can make getting one-shots with Mirror Coat awkward, but it is still a great option, particularly against boosted or super effective hits. Bear in mind though that this won’t work against Chi-Yu as long as it keeps its Dark typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Storm</strong>: Leaf Storm trades consistency for a single turn of high burst damage and can be worth it if investing in Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Arboliva’s raw special stats make it capable of tanking super effective hits without using Tera. Nonetheless, Tera is still a strong tool to extend Arboliva’s uptime and contest matchups that would otherwise capitalize on its mediocre defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire can flip matchups against Focus Sash Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu when healthy. If running Tera Blast, it also gives Arboliva the opportunity to contest Steel-types more effectively. Be aware, though, that this significantly worsens other key matchups, like Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a solid defensive option, especially into Toxic abusers like Toxapex and Clodsire. Notably, it flips several weaknesses, blocks Toxic, and allows for absorbing Toxic Spikes later in the match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric is Gholdengo's worst nightmare. It gives a resistance to Make It Rain, blocks Thunder Wave from defensive sets, and punishes Tera Flying usage that is meant to get around Earth Power. On top of that, Arboliva still hits Corviknight very hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is another great defensive option for neutralizing most of Arboliva's weaknesses, and the extra power behind Dazzling Gleam can make it easier to break defensive Dragonite variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass removes Arboliva’s Fighting weakness while maintaining Spore immunity, letting it check Breloom. If both Tera and Grassy Terrain are active, Modest Giga Drain can even 2HKO Breloom!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: While not as strong defensively, invested Tera Earth Power can OHKO uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 140 SpA / 124 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread balances bulk and power, avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Gholdengo's Make It Rain and almost always surviving Modest Chi-Yu’s Fire Blast before Tera! If running Tera Ground, there are enough Special Attack EV’s to turn Earth Power into an OHKO against uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo. The Speed EV's Speed tie with 4 Speed Gastrodon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 SpA / 20 SpD with Modest</strong>: This simple spread still provides plenty of bulk while maximizing Special Attack, working nicely with Leaf Storm and Tera Types that boost Arboliva's coverage moves. If Grassy Terrain is present, fully invested Leaf Storm has a 75% chance of OHKOing 4 Special Defense Garchomp. The bulk investment lets Arboliva always avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire after Grassy Terrain recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest</strong>: While maximum Speed investment may seem a bit strange, it can be worth it when running Tera Fire Tera Blast to get the jump on Scizor, Corviknight and the rare Timid Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 148 SpA / 20 SpD / 100 Spe with Modest</strong>: This alternative Speed spread gives Arboliva a nice boost in Special Attack while still letting it outrun 4 Speed Azumarill. This is usually more than enough Speed to outrun Ting-Lu as well.</p> </li> </ul>"

Just note that Covert Cloak will still block these statuses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy and Custap Berry</strong>: Getting rid of Garganacl's status immunity and Ghost resistance is a huge sacrifice, but it can let Garganacl lead against some surprising Pokemon effectively without needing to Terastallize, like Choice Specs Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle. Custap Berry's pseudo-priority can also lead to surprising Stealth Rock set-ups.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Rock may be an awful defensive typing, this Garganacl's complete focus on taking advantage of Salt Cure means that in some scenarios, it can get away without Terastallizing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison's Fighting and Fairy-type resistance vastly improves Garganacl's match-up against Flutter Mane, Ogerpon-H, and Urshifu-R, making it a prime Tera choice. As a bonus, this also lets Garganacl absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Garganacl a better matchup against Chien-Pao, Urshifu-R, and Gholdengo, in addition to being an excellent defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While removing Purifying Salt's Ghost resistance is a shame, Tera Ghost does wonderfully against Archaludon and opposing Garganacl due to the Body Press immunity, and in general removes all of Garganacl's common weaknesses. Tera Ghost also can make foes paranoid of it being the Curse set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gets rid of the Ground and Fighting weaknesses, giving it a far better chance of beating Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B. It also makes Fissure no longer an issue from Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and opposing Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy lets Garganacl tank powerful Fighting coverage such as Chien-Pao's Scared Sword, and shrug off powerful Dragon-type attacks from Latios and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> </ul>"

Boosting Salt Cure's meager power can also help against frailer Substitute users such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Ghost Curse</strong>: If using Tera Ghost, Curse will change its effect, which drastically changes Garganacl's playstyle. While the 50% health cut can make it a tad risky, the Curse affliction is very powerful at wearing down Pokemon, including major foes that take advantage of Salt Cure, such as Covert Cloak Pokemon, bulky Substitute users, and Blaziken Baton Pass chains. When combined with Salt Cure, it can even overwhelm bulky Pokemon with recovery, such as Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse and Earthquake</strong>: Ghost Curse unfortunately does not work against Gholdengo, so using regular Curse alongside Earthquake makes Garganacl far less passive against against Gholdengo and frail Substitute users such as Flutter Mane. This is especially recommended if using other Tera types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect versus Substitute</strong>: Protect is perfect for getting some extra Leftovers recovery, but Substitute comes in handy against Dragon Tail users like Archaludon and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Salt Cure means Garganacl can still without Terastallization, but to truly take advantage of either facet of Curse, expect to Terastallize it often.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: In addition to being a great defensive typing that leaves Garganacl with only a weakness to Dark thanks to Purifying Salt, this is the Tera type that enables the unique properties of Curse.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is Garganacl's best option against Flutter Mane, ensuring it resists both STAB attacks. Absorbing Toxic Spikes is also helpful against stall teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: If messing with Gholdengo is the goal, Tera Water is an excellent choice, resisting the powerful Make It Rain and being a good defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Beyond being a great typing that offers a Fighting-type resistance, it also means Garganacl no longer has to worry about Dragon Tail from Archaludon. This doesn't improve Garganacl's match-up against Gholdengo though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying has excellent synergy with Garganacl's former typing, making it immune to Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B's Ground-type attacks, and even removing any worry about Fissure from Ting-Lu and Dondozo. However, this comes at the cost of still making it vulnerable to Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul>"

The Fighting-type resistance against Urshifu formes and Toxic Spikes absorption is also quite helpful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water vastly improves Garganacl's chances of defeating Gholdengo, Urshifu-R, and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: A Ghost Tera type gives Garganacl an immunity to Body Press, giving it the edge against Archaludon and opposing Garganacl, especially when paired with Leftovers. It can also fool players into thinking Garganacl is using the Curse set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Flying typing lets Garganacl take on new foes such as Landorus-T, Ursaluna-B, and Garchomp, though it makes Garganacl fairly weak to Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Fairy is a good defensive type for Garganacl, giving it a useful Fighting and Dark resistance to help against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, and no longer worrying about powerful Dragon-type attacks. However, Garganacl still remains vulnerable to powerful Steel-type attacks from foes like Gholdengo. EV Spreads ========</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful</strong>: Maximizing Special Defense is the best choice for easier setup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong>: In addition to powering up Body Press, a focus on Defense makes setting up on powerful setup sweepers such as Dragonite an easier task.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 84 Def / 172 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread allows Tera Steel Garganacl to avoid a 2HKO from Breloom's Mach Punch after Iron Defense.</p> </li> </ul>"

On the other hand, Armarouge can specialize to handle certain matchups better, at which point Tera can become more necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: This Tera typing turns Armarouge's Water- and Ground-type weaknesses into resistances, and gives a vital Spore immunity against opposing Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: With a boost from Tera Psychic, Expanding Force OHKOes even relatively bulky foes such as Garchomp and Flutter Mane. With Stealth Rock, Expanding Force still achieves most notable KOs without Tera Psychic, but the extra damage is still appreciated.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: In cases where setting up Psychic Terrain proves to be more difficult, Tera Fairy grants a resistance to Sucker Punch and makes disrupting other Dark-types like Chi-Yu easier. Its also just a solid defensive typing that neutralizes all of its other weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a more niche option for a Dark-type resistance that also powers up Aura Sphere.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Weak Armor</strong>: This ability takes full advantage of Focus Sash, guaranteeing you live a single hit from a physical attacker and granting a big Speed boost thereafter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flash Fire</strong>: While more situational, Flash Fire is worth considering with certain Tera Types like Grass, keeping momentum against revenge killers who use Fire-type attacks.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Bulk Up Ceruledge makes excellent use of both its respectable bulk and Bitter Blade's high recovery. By changing its typing to a more defense oriented one, while maintaining the Fire immunity thanks to Flash Fire, Ceruledge can set up Bulk Ups on a variety of common Pokemon, ranging from Corviknight, Kingambit, Azumarill and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt lets Ceruledge set up Bulk Up without needing to fear common phasing moves (with the exception of attacking moves such as Dragon Tail), as well as opposing setup moves such opposing Bulk Up and Iron Defense, provided you outspeed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong> Priority of some form is always nice to have on a Pokemon, which makes Shadow Sneak an easy contender for the last move. Gaining extra added strength against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult and Annihilape is certainly charming.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Tera Blast</strong>: This allows Ceruledge to eliminate Dondozo more quickly. While Taunt can shut down Dondozo's Yawn, it cannot shut down Fissure. The only way to beat Dondozo would be to eliminate it as quickly as possibly, which Grass Tera Blast aids with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: Flame Charge provides Ceruledge an extra net of safety against potential Scarf users and Annihilape, who are capable of turning the tides against it. While normally, Ceruledge is prone to faster Taunt + Bulk Up users and Scarfed Trick, Flame Charge helps mitigate both of those weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Ceruledge can be a status spreader in games where it can't set up as easily. It also helps Ceruledge set up more easily against threats such as Unaware Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy helps Ceruledge's matchup against prominent Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: An immunity to Spore and a resistance to Water makes Grass the most notable Tera type for this set. Flash Fire eliminating one of Grass's many weaknesses is also noteworthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Increasing Bitter Blade's power will always be a valuable trait. Eliminating Ghost's weaknesses to Ghost and Dark also allows Ceruledge to set up more comfortably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug is similar to Tera Grass, but in exchange for losing the Water resistance and maintaining the Rock weakness of Fire / Ghost, Ceruledge can tank Volcarona's Bug Buzz with significantly more ease.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Investing into Defense prepares Ceruledge and its mediocre physical bulk for the physical-biased metagame. Bulk Up will boost its Defense, but it can struggle to take some physical hits even after a boost, and its special bulk is naturally high.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: A faster spread helps Ceruledge outspeed other Bulk Up users, like Annihilape opting to invest in bulk. Being faster, more often than not, lets Ceruledge win these matchups with ease.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: While most threats in the metagame at the moment are physical, a specially defensive spread is still noteworthy for its ability to surprise Hydreigon.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a stellar offensive typing, a unique set of attacks, Weak Armor allowing it to outspeed a large part of the metagame, and its immunity to Extreme Speed and Mach Punch, Ceruledge proves itself to be a very solid Focus Sash option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bitter Blade</strong>: Bitter Blade's recovery can make Focus Sash usable even if entry hazards chip it. If Ceruledge is brought down to 1 HP, a +2 Bitter Blade can heal it to the point that it can tank an extra attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Shadow Claw</strong>: Close Combat hits the Normal-, Dark-, and Rock-types that resist Ceruledge's STAB combination. Still, Shadow Claw is a noteworthy choice to guarantee the KO on Mimikyu and let Ceruledge pressure Skeledirge. Note, however, that maximum Defense Skeledirge can recover more than Shadow Claw's damage, barring critical hits, and a Terastallized Skeledirge can completely wall this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance versus Destiny Bond</strong>: As powerful as Swords Dance boosted attacks from Ceruledge are, the abundance of Unaware Pokemon, primarily Dondozo, has made some players opt to use Destiny Bond to snag surprise kills. Destiny Bond can also make the matchup against KOing common Sucker Punch Pokemon, such as Meowscarada and Kingambit, easier to win without having to rely on predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant's added damage output is valuable, but Jolly allows Ceruledge to outspeed non-Scarf Gholdengo, and gives it a chance at outspeeding Modest Rotom formes and Glimmora. All of the mentioned examples are Special Attackers, meaning Ceruledge's Weak Armor often does not trigger in these matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Giving Bitter Blade an extra push in damage is quite useful, giving Ceruledge more recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Normal is an exceedingly common Tera Type on Ghost types due to the immunity it brings to the table. Ceruledge makes particularly excellent use of Normal Tera by resisting both Steel and Fairy, making it very difficult for Gholdengo and Mimikyu to click anything other than a Ghost type move when facing off against Ceruledge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Giving extra reach power to Close Combat, a powerful option against Pokemon such as Hydreigon, makes Fighting a solid choice for a Tera Type.</p> </li> </ul>"

It's also a decent check against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass- or Fairy-type Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast is important coverage to have; with a Fairy Tera type, Bellibolt reliably checks non-Tera Steel Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Muddy Water versus Chilling Water</strong>: Muddy Water should be used with Tera Electric for much-needed coverage. Alternatively, Chilling Water weakens common switch-ins such as Garchomp and Baxcalibur, allowing you to reposition your team more safely.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acid Spray</strong>: This threatens non-Steel type switch-ins, and it also lets Bellibolt effectively use Electromorphosis without having to take damage first. It's also a powerful tool against Unaware walls such as Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch</strong>: While weak, Sucker Punch snipes Pokemon that activate Focus Sash and/or deals chip damage when Bellibolt is guaranteed to go down.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy-type</strong>: Tera Fairy Bellibolt offensively checks big threats like Roaring Moon and Dragapult by walling their non-Terastal sets and nabbing surprise KOs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass-type</strong>: Tera Grass Bellibolt can stay in versus common Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Breloom, sponge their attacks, and either chunk them or survive and reposition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric-type</strong>: Maximizing Parabolic Charge damage is a viable option.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 28 Def / 180 SpA / 44 SpD / 28 Spe</strong>: This spread is to avoid the 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Rotom-W and Hydreigon's Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor. 28 Speed EVs allow Bellibolt to outspeed 4 Speed EV Hippowdon. 28 Defense EVs are enough to survive Focus Sash Garchomp's Earthquake, which notably becomes a 3HKO if Bellibolt Terastallizes into a typing without a weakness to Ground.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 156 SpA / 124 SpD</strong>: This EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump. This spread can also use a Quiet nature and 0 Speed EVs for the slowest possible Volt Switch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 52 Def / 180 SpA / 44 SpD / 4 Spe</strong>: This spread sacrifices outspeeding Hippowdon for surviving a +1 or Choice Band Dragonite Earthquake.</p> </li> </ul>"

Tera Grass Bellibolt also absorbs Spore versus Breloom and Amoonguss, effectively walling them as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Fairy Tera Bellibolt comfortably walls Dragon-types, removing a lot of their offensive pressure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Water is just generally good to have as a defensive Tera type.

The physical bulk lets Bellibolt always survive Life Orb Garchomp's Earthquake, and after Terastallization into a neutral type, it becomes a 3HKO. 28 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed 4 Speed EV Hippowdon.</li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers provides long-term passive recovery alongside Slack Off, which can make Bellibolt very difficult to remove. Leftovers also removes any chance of a 2HKO from powerful physical threats such as Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is a good backup option if Leftovers is already in use.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet Bellibolt can switch into and passively punish physical attackers; the chip damage can also break Focus Sash and weaken foes into range of Electromorphosis-boosted attacks.</p> </li> </ul>"

With an Electromorphosis boost, Bellibolt can 2HKO common switch-ins without having to Terastallize, like Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast is important for coverage; with a Fairy typing, Bellibolt reliably checks non-Tera Steel Dragon-types. Muddy Water should be used with Tera Electric.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Muddy Water versus Parabolic Charge</strong>: Muddy Water lets Bellibolt win one-on-one against Hippowdon.

      "Sun Attacker": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Tera Fire Scovillain's damage under sun is absurd, managing to barely KO even Fire-resistant targets. Most notably, its ability to defeat most Pokemon, even powerful Dragon-types, without fearing surprise Terastallizations makes Scovillain a charming offensive option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat and Fire Blast</strong>: Overheat combined with Tera Fire and Choice Specs guarantees the KO on Garchomp  without bulk EVs, and OHKO offensive Roaring Moon after Stealth Rock damage. Against the frailer Dragapult, Tera Fire and Fire Blast is enough to earn the KO. It's recommended to run both Fire STAB moves because Overheat's added damage can be necessary to guarantee certain KOs, but its stat drop can be fatal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Solar Beam versus Leaf Storm</strong>: Solar Beam nails the few bulky Water-types that can survive Scovillain's absurd attacks, most notable examples being notably Gastrodon and Assault Vest Azumarill. However, Leaf Storm can be used in its stead for the ability to OHKO Hippowdon, despite it summoning sand.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: Flamethrower is perfectly accurateand is typically more than enough to nip off frailer foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: In spite of the type matchup, Scovillain is deceptively weak to Kingambit thanks to Sucker Punch. Additionally, many Pokemon will use Protect in front of Scovillain to waste sun turns— most notably Espathra and Dondozo. Against all of these foes, a well-timed Substitute can guarantee the win.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: It is almost mandatory to run Tera Fire on this Scovillain set. Tera Fire guarantees KOs on most Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: The abundantly common Dragonite is incredibly strong against Scovillain. Should Stealth Rock support be deemed enough to let Scovillain sweep teams reasonably, even without Tera Fire, using Tera Ghost to gain an immunity to Extreme Speed can be very useful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Tera Rock with Tera Blast can be a decent alternative to Tera Fire, as it gives Scovillain excellent coverage and also provides a much-needed countermeasure to Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Moody Ace": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The metagame's abundance of Unaware Pokemon makes it difficult to maneuver Moody Pokemon in general. On top of that, Scovillain is held back by the powerful Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination. However, Scovillain still carves a niche for itself by being the only Moody Pokemon with excellent recovery moves, Leech Seed and Ingrain, allowing it to win a variety of matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: Protect and Substitute are mandatory to get the most opportunities to activate Moody. Once you gain enough Defense or Special Defense boosts that Scovillain's Substitute can tank an attack without breaking, it tends to be easy to win the game. Note, however, that Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers's animation make Scovillain very vulnerable to losing via timer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: With enough Moody boosts, Scovillain's Flamethrower tends to be enough to break through an entire team. There are very few Pokemon that are immune or quadruply resistant to Fire, and Flamethrower has good PP and accuracy, which makes it an easy pick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Flamethrower, Giga Drain gets shrugged off by a lot of Pokemon, even at +6, notably Corviknight and Dragonite. However, an attacking move that helps recover HP lost from Substitutes gives Scovillain more mileage off of Moody. Giga Drain is also notable to more reliably defeat Dondozo, one of the Unaware Pokemon that would give Scovillain a lot of trouble otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leech Seed</strong>: Leech Seed combined with Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers helps Scovillain restore HP while collecting Moody boosts, as well as chipping Pokemon it'd otherwise have trouble against, such as Clodsire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain</strong>: Ingrain is an alternative recovery option that makes Scovillain impervious to phazing moves. When purely considering recovery, it's more reliable than the inaccurate 90% accurate Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast with Tera Fairy is an excellent option that helps remedy Scovillain's Dragon susceptibility, particularly making the Infiltrator Dragapult and Roaring Moon matchup easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Water resistance helps Scovillain beat Dondozo. Even though Dondozo ignores Scovillain's Defense boosts via Unaware, with Tera Water, Scovillain's Substitute can tank a Wave Crash. Tera Water also keeps the Scovillain's Steel resistance, unlike Tera Grass, which makes it easier to check Scizor—a common priority user that people attempt to use to check Moody Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy mitigating Scovillain's weakness to Dragon-types is massively helpful.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>180 HP / 220 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 100 Spe with Bold</strong>: This spread bolsters Scovillain’s physical bulk. Notably, Tera Water Scovillain's Substitute manages to survive Dondozo's Wave Crash with this spread. The Speed allows Scovillain to outspeed slow Baxcalibur and Gholdengo, as well as Dragapult with one Moody Speed boost. The HP is adjusted to make maximum use of Leftovers, with the resulting stat having a remainder of 1 when divided by 16. The remaining EVs are split between Special Attack and Special Defense because, at level 50, investing 8 EVs in either stat has no benefit over investing 4.</li> </ul>"

However, Tera Blast provides more flexible coverage that can also cover Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect versus Substitute</strong>: Protect is the most reliable way to get a free turn of Speed Boost. Substitute is a riskier option for Speed Boost stalling, but it severely punishes passive Pokemon and works extremely well on dual screen teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roost</strong>: Roost can make it incredibly difficult for special attackers to break Espathra after its used Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bold versus Timid</strong>: The given EV spread allows Espathra to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp after two turns of Speed Boost and unboosted Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle after one turn.

Bulldoze also becomes a more serviceable attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel powers up the already amazing Gigaton Hammer, but at the cost of being weaker to Fighting- and Dark-type attacks.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: Air Balloon let's Tinkaton set up Stealth Rock against other common entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Glimmora without the use of Flying Tera and pairs incredibly well with Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash allows Tinkaton to get support moves like Thunder Wave off even against powerful attacks from the likes of Terastallized Chi-Yu, Garchomp, and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers has great synergy with Swords Dance and Encore, allowing it to set up while healing off some of the damage from weak moves.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Speads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly or Adamant</strong>: This is a simple offensive spread that takes full advantage of Air Balloon or Focus Sash for survivability. If running Jolly, you can repurpose 24 Speed EVs to defensive stats and still outrun Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Atk / 148 Def / 20 SpD / 92 Spe with Careful</strong>: The HP and Defense investment let's Tinkaton survive Adamant Dragonite's Earthquake into Extreme Speed. The Special Defense investment allows Tinkaton to survive one Timid Choice Specs Fire Blast from Hydreigon, two Modest Choice Specs Shadow Balls from Dragapult, and three uninvested Shadow Balls from Gholdengo. The Speed investment allows Tinkaton to outspeed a paralyzed Choice Scarf Timid Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "This looks like a job for Palafin": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Palafin's stats are middling, but after switching out once it will forme change into Palafin-H, which boasts the highest base Attack in the format, making it an effective wall breaker with Wave Crash, and a great revenge killer with Jet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn</strong>: Flip Turn is perfect for letting Palafin do some chip damage and escaping before it transforms into the heroic Palafin-H! It's possible to drop if coverage is desperately needed, but forcing Palafin to switch and losing out on a useful pivot move is not the right call in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch is Palafin-H's best bet against Dragonite before it Terastallizes, and deals decent damage to Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Drain Punch</strong>: Close Combat is good coverage, hitting Rotom-W for neutral damage and covering Baxcalibur, Iron Bundle, and Roaring Moon. While weaker, Drain Punch's lack of defensive stat drops makes sense for a better matchup against Focus Sash Chien-Pao and restoring a good amount of health against Iron Bundle before usually KOing it with Jet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: An Adamant nature increases the damage Wave Crash and Jet Punch inflict, making Palafin-H a more effective wall breaker and revenge killer. A Jolly nature enables Palafin-H to outspeed Jolly Mimikyu, Jolly Baxcalibur, and Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Grass Knot</strong>: Grass Knot lets Palafin-H potentially 2HKO physically defensive Dondozo, whose normally a good Palafin-H check. It doesn't cover anything else that's useful, with Azumarill and Rotom-W being fairly lightweight.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Terastallization can make Palafin-H to an even more potent revenge killer and cleaner, but its not reliant on it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water makes Palafin-H a potent late-game cleaner, making it the Tera Type that makes sense for most teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: If willing to give up on consistent coverage by using Tera Blast, Tera Electric Palafin-H deals a big amount of damage against common bulky Water-types like Azumarill, Dondozo, and Toxapex, in addition to saving Palafin-H from Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: A Grass Tera type turns all of Palafin-H's weaknesses into resistances, giving it a favorable matchup against Rotom-W, and making it immune to Spore from Breloom, Amoonguss, and Brute Bonnet, and having a good Tera Blast against Azumarill and Dondozo. If using the niche Grass Knot, it consistently 2HKOs all but specially defensive Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band gives Palafin-H the most amount of wallbreaking and revenge killing power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Palafin-H's bulk is good enough to survive some powerful attacks with Assault Vest, such as Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry, and it works well with bulkier EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mystic Water</strong>: If Choice Band is used by another teammate, Mystic Water is a great alternative thanks to most of Palafin-H's attacks being Water-type anyways.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb works well with revenge killing and makes the niche Grass Knot always 2HKO specially defensive Dondozo, but the severe compromise to Palafin-H's bulk, especially with Wave Crash recoil, makes it a lesser option.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Bulkier EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Breloom, and lets Palafin-H survive Tera Flying Choice Band Tera Blast from Dragonite from full health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 236 Atk / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom, and survives Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast after Stealth Rock damage. If surviving that isn't important or if using Assault Vest, feel free to swap the HP and Attack investments.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>60 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 12 SpD / 180 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This speedy Assault Vest spread outspeeds Jolly Annihilape, survives Jolly Life Orb Tera Dark Chien-Pao's Crunch from full health, and survives Modest Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> </ul>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Palafin-H's powerful priority and good Speed tier separate it from other Bulk Up sweepers, such as Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch</strong>: Even without Tera Fighting, Drain Punch's extra healing makes it a great choice for coverage, and it does massive damage to Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Meowscarada.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt versus Substitute</strong>: With Taunt, Palafin-H excels at breaking through troublesome defensive Pokemon, such as Corviknight, Wo-Chien, and Skeledirge, and it also gives Palafin a decent move against Ting-Lu and Hippowdon before switching out for Zero to Hero. Substitute has a worse matchup defensive set-up Pokemon, but in exchange it turns Garganacl into an excellent set up opportunity and makes Palafin-H a fearsome sweeper with Toxic Spikes support.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: If using Tera Water, Ice Punch is a reasonable option for hitting Dragon-types, though it does leave Palafin-H walled by Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: While harder to justify than the other support options, Encore does give Palafin-H new chances to set up, punishing slower set-up sweepers like Annihilape in particular.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Unless using Tera Blast, Palafin-H is only pressured to Terastallize to improve certain matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Besides being an excellent defensive typing that punishes Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu for using Dark-type attacks, Tera Fairy gives Palafin-H a great offensive option against Dragon-types like Dragonite and Baxcalibur, as well as coverage against Wo-Chien and Meowscarada with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Boosting Drain Punch's power with Tera Fighting can make Palafin-H even more difficult to take down and can seriously compromise defensive Rotom-W thanks to Taunt or Substitute blocking Will-O-Wisp. However, it does make Palafin-H particularly vulnerable to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water helps Palafin-H pick off more threats with Jet Punch, having a good shot to OHKO offensive Flutter Mane unboosted after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides offering a useful Fairy resistance, Tera Poison lets Palafin-H absorb Toxic Spikes and stop Toxic without a support move, making it a viable alternative.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers takes advantage of Palafin-H's slow setup and is a requirement if using Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: If using Taunt, Punching Glove is a good option to free up Leftovers for a teammate. Palafin-H appreciates the extra power Jet Punch and Drain Punch gain, and it becomes harder for Rocky Helmet Dragonite to wear it down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If using Taunt, Covert Cloak turns the tables on the Garganacl matchup in addition to protecting Palafin-H from surprise Light Ball Flings from foes like Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 SpD / 116 Spe with Careful</strong>: This spread maximizes Palafin-H's Special Defense while still outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximizing Speed allows Palafin-H to outspeed fast support Pokemon like Mimikyu and Annihilape so it can Taunt them. This spread also outspeeds the rare Choice Specs Hydreigon, which can deal massive damage with Draco Meteor if not using Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 Atk / 116 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This is a far more offensive approach to the set, letting Palafin-H function more as a revenge killer with the potential to sweep rather than a bulky setup Pokemon. This is best used with Tera Water, as Palafin-H will then OHKO offensive Flutter Mane with unboosted Jet Punch. The given Speed is for outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> </ul>"

    "sets": {
      "IronPress": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to Earth Eater, Orthworm can wall sets of many physical Dragon-types like Garchomp and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head versus Heavy Slam</strong>: Iron Head is superior for Dragonite, Chien-Pao, and Baxcalibur. Heavy Slam can 2HKO offensive Dragapult and OHKO offensive Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rest</strong>: Rest gives Orthworm better longevity for stalling out physical threats. It can be run with Chesto Berry, but usually another item is preferable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shed Tail</strong>: In the early-game when IronPress may not be as effective, Shed Tail gives Orthworm a useful pivot for setting up teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute stops Salt Cure damage from Garganacl and phazing from Garchomp's Dragon Tail.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake can hit Gholdengo, but it won't 2HKO, so Recover is still a problem.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: IronPress sets have a more difficult time fitting it in, but Orthworm can run Stealth Rock if the team can't run it elsewhere.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry helps ensure that Orthworm can still Shed Tail after taking a big hit or, if able to stay healthy, gives it two uses of Shed Tail.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Not only does Rocky Helmet make it even easier to wear down physical attackers, but it makes running Body Press as the only attack much more feasible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is a consistent option, especially in conjunction with Substitute.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Orthworm's excellent bulk profile give it good setup opportunities, but combining Terastallization with Earth Eater can further augment its defensive capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison provides a key Fighting-type resistance and a single weakness and maintains a key resistance to Flower Trick, letting Orthworm perform better against Meowscarada, Great Tusk, and Iron Valiant.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy provides a Fighting-type resistance and Dragon-type immunity, turning Dragon Tail Garchomp into setup bait, and dealing with Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong>: Maximum physical bulk is ideal if relying on Orthworm to beat Dragonite and Baxcalibur in the late-game. A fully invested Body Press will also OHKO offensive Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful</strong>: This EV spread makes Orthworm much less likely to be 2HKOd by unboosted Flutter Mane and Life Orb Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 116 Def / 140 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread can be used to outspeed Adamant Kingambit, most Corviknight, and Skeledirge. This can be very useful if using Shed Tail.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Shed Tail Support": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Orthworm's good physical bulk and ability make it a great support with Shed Tail, and a reliable Stealth Rock user.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Body Press</strong>: Body Press has a good chance to OHKO offensive Chi-Yu and Meowscarada, and threatens Kingambit and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam versus Iron Head</strong>: A Steel-type STAB move helps hit some Ghost-types like busted Mimikyu and Flutter Mane, who are OHKOed by Heavy Slam. Iron Head is an alternative for heavy foes like Dragonite, Chien-Pao, and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Orthworm can also set Spikes at the cost of offensive coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>A Special Teammate</strong>: Many Pokemon can benefit from Orthworm's Shed Tail. One example is Air Balloon Gholdengo, which puts a lot of pressure on defensive foes when behind a Substitute.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Orthworm isn't usually meant to Terastallize, since that's better served by the teammates its passing a Substitute to.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison leaves Orthworm with only one fairly rare weakness, and aids it against former threats like Great Tusk and Iron Valiant.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Orthworm a Fighting resistance, as well as a way to absorb Garchomp's Dragon Tail while still staying in.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with Impish</strong>: This spread maximizes Orthworm's physical bulk. Running a Speed IV of 0 may be tempting, but being outsped by bulky Brute Bonnet is risky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 116 Def / 140 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread outspeeds Kingambit, and most Skeledirge and Corviknight. Outspeeding Kingambit and Corviknight prevents Taunt from stopping Shed Tail, and let's Orthworm bring in a teammate against Torch Song.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 44 Def / 212 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom and Jolly Brute Bonnet. Mach Punch still does a lot, but thanks to Sitrus Berry, Orthworm will have enough HP left to Shed Tail to a check or counter.</p> </li> </ul>"

Defensive Dragonite sets, Stamina Archaludon, Annihilape, and Gliscor are good examples to consider.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Glimmora can use Terastallization to improve match-ups against foes like Ursaluna-B or Primarina, other teammates will usually want the Terastallization option more.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: A Grass Tera type is the best option, surviving common Ground-type Pokemon such as Ursaluna-B and Garchomp, in addition to nullifying Breloom's Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying vastly improves Glimmora's matchup against Ground-types with a potential to retain Focus Sash, though this doesn't help Glimmora as much offensively as Tera Grass.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: This is the most reliable item for setting up Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: With Air Balloon, Glimmora vastly improves its match-up against Ground-type leads such as Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Meteor Beam": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Power Herb and Meteor Beam combined, Glimmora gains a huge amount of power compared to its other sets, making its softer checks such as Assault Vest Ursaluna-B and Assault Vest Kingambit far less reliable. This set is also less reliant on leading, though Toxic Debris still makes it a natural at this role.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong>: Coverage against Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Archaludon, and Kingambit is required for Glimmora to potentially sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Energy Ball</strong>: Energy Ball is Glimmora's most damaging attack against Ursaluna-B, and it pairs greatly with Tera Grass.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sludge Wave versus Dazzling Gleam</strong>: While Poison coverage may not seem particularly useful, it deals more damage to Primarina than Energy Ball, potentially preventing a revenge kill. Dazzling Gleam on the other hand, knocks out Hydreigon and deals serious damage to Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Since Meteor Beam only has one shot of boosting Special Attack without a charge-up turn, Terastallization is often key to prevent Glimmora's vulnerability to Ground-type attacks from ruining its shot at sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass stands out as the best option, boosting Energy Ball to the point where even some Assault Vest Ursaluna-B risk getting OHKOed after a boost while twisting the Ground-type weakness into a resistance. As a bonus, this also stops Breloom's Spore from derailing a potential sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying's Ground-type immunity is worth considering, and it also grants the bonus of not worrying about Toxic Spikes. However, it provides far less offensive benefit than Tera Grass.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is mainly useful for stopping Scale Shot users like Dragonite and Garchomp from setting up a sweep and revenge kill on Glimmora in one turn as well as punishing Choice-locked Dragon-types such as Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Specs Hydreigon. However, retaining the Steel-type weakness is a big problem against Gholdengo and Scizor.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, for teams that desperately need Toxic Spikes, using the move itself does ensure that special attackers can't play around Glimmora's ability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mortal Spin</strong>: Mortal Spin provides rare entry hazard removal in the format while also spreading poison, making it a must-have on a defensive set. This particularly pairs well with bulky Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Dragonite and Volcarona.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong> Even on a defensive set, Glimmora usually can't afford to be easy pickings for Steel-types like Archaludon and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Power Gem</strong>: Power Gem is Glimmora's best offense against Volcarona, Dragonite, and Baxcalibur, all threats that can threaten to set up on Glimmora otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Red Card versus Air Balloon</strong>: Red Card has excellent synergy with Toxic Debris, letting Glimmora punish a foe by switching into resisted hits such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed to not only set up a layer of Toxic Spikes but also potentially force in one of the foe's teammates to immediately get poisoned. Air Balloon doesn't have this amazing sweep-stopping potential, but it does ensure that Ground-type coverage from foes like Dragonite won't force Glimmora to switch out or Terastallize right away.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Toxic and Corrosion</strong>: Giving up the incredible Toxic Debris is a big sacrifice, but using Corrision and Toxic together can ruin defensive Steel-types like Corviknight, which otherwise may attempt to set up on Glimmora.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Glimmora's 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks is a massive thorn on its side, but while Terastallization can help solve this, this set's more supportive nature doesn't always make it the correct option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass gels with Glimmora defensively, giving it an important resistance to Ground and ensuring that Breloom doesn't stop it with Spore.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>52 Speed EVs versus 68 Speed EVs</strong>: 52 Speed EVs let Glimmora outspeed Jolly Ursaluna and Jolly Kingambit. While they aren't particularly common, these threats have the potential to ruin Glimmora. 68 EVs can be used to outspeed Timid Ursaluna-B, which is also an uncommon but serious threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 164 Def / 36 SpA / 4 SpD / 52 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread nets a 2HKO on maximum HP Gholdengo with Earth Power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 172 Def / 4 SpA / 28 SpD / 52 Spe with Bold</strong>: This more defensive spread avoids an OHKO from Adamant Gallade's Psycho Cut, assuming it doesn't use an offensive boosting item.</p> </li> </ul>"

Sludge Wave is still worth considering for the extra damage done to Primarina and common Tera Fairy Pokemon such as Archaludon and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Dazzling Gleam is a reasonable option for OHKOing Hydreigon and dealing huge damage to Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The given EV spread ensures that maximum HP Ursaluna-B is OHKOed by Tera Grass Energy Ball, while Glimmora will survive Tera Normal Ursaring-B's Silk Scarf-boosted Blood Moon. The Speed EVs let Glimmora outspeed Jolly Ursaluna and Jolly Kingambit, both rare but major threats to it.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependecy - High</strong>: Glimmora's awkward defensive typing means Terastallization is often key for surprising common revenge killers like Gholdengo and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a powerful defensive and offensive option, letting Glimmora tank against foes like Ursaluna-B, Gholdengo, and Primarina while boosting Energy Ball's power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground isn't as amazing as Tera Grass defensively due to retaining the Water-type weakness, but it ensures that Earth Power will now OHKO offensive Gholdengo and deal massive damage to defensive Archaludon.</p> </li> </ul>"

If a Water-type STAB attack is desired instead, Wave Crash is the preferred option over Liquidation in most cases, purely for the damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect is not only useful for scouting for unexpected Tera types, but pairs well with Yawn and Leftovers to give Dondozo more longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rest and Sleep Talk</strong>: When using Rocky Helmet, these two moves are an alternative way to keep Dondozo healthy. It also makes it much easier for Dondozo to deal with debilitating status conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake has good offensive synergy with Avalanche, and punishes some Tera Electric Pokemon that may attempt to mess with Dondozo, such as Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: This spread maximizes Dondozo's stopping power against physical threats and helps against powerful Tera users, with the ability to avoid a 2HKO from Adamant Chien-Pao's Electric Tera Blast with Leftovers and Protect.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Curse</strong>: Curse can be used to get around Substitute users like Punching Glove Urshifu-R, increasing Dondozo's already incredible bulk and gaining enough power to knock out Substitute in one attack.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Dondozo's defensive typing is fantastic, so Terastallization is usually only needed against the metagame's most fiercesome wall breakers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy Tera type lets Dondozo take on powerful Dark- and Dragon-type attacks much more easily, and is just a good defensive typing in general. Choice Band Koraidon's Outrage is one of the biggest targets, but blocking Scale Shot is also good for forcing Rocky Helmet contact damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: A Fire Tera type throws a wrench in the plans of Tera Electric attackers like Zacian-C and Chien-Pao while still resisting their best STAB attacks. It also makes dealing with Ogerpon-H much easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternate EV Spread</h4> <ul> <li><strong>252 HP / 196 Def / 60 SpD with Impish</strong>: By shifting some investment into special bulk, Dondozo can guarantee that it avoids an OHKO from Tera Fairy Moonblast coming from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</li> </ul>"

Just note that Chien-Pao is shockingly heavy, so Body Press or Wave Crash is preferred against that threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake offers more reliable Ground-type coverage at the cost of not being an instant KO like Fissure.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization will help against some specific checks to Dondozo, it's typing is great for general purposes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass removes Dondozo’s usual set of weaknesses and allows it to absorb spore from the likes of Amoonguss, Breloom, and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy grants Dondozo a new set of resistances to take advantage of with its phenomenal bulk and also grants it a powerful STAB to hit Dragon- and Fighting-types with if it runs Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: When paired with Heavy Slam, Dondozo can now 2HKO Iron Bundle without Stealth Rock support, in addition to gaining a fantastic defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Terastallizing into a Ground-type allows Dondozo to block the Electric-type attacks commonly aimed at it while also giving it STAB on Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Tera Dragon gives Dondozo a resistance to both Electric- and Water-type attacks, allowing it to stand up to Rotom-W much better.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>44 HP / 212 Atk / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This more offensive spread makes sense if you have better options for Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Annihilape's great bulk, fearsome offensive presence with Rage Fist, and wide support movepool make it an unpredictable and dangerous foe early-game!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Annihilape is among the most reliable offensive setters of Stealth Rock in the metagame, though it isn't required for Annihilape to be an effective early-game Pokemon for every team.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Final Gambit</strong>: Annihilape's impressive HP stat makes Final Gambit into a powerful KO trading tool, being able to take out bulky foes like Dragonite, Garganacl, Hippowdon, and Stamina Archaludon. Make sure to run at least 236 HP EVs when using Final Gambit to OHKO Hippowdon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb is an excellent Speed control option for its ability to punish Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt gives Annihilape a strong matchup into bulky support Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling and Light Ball</strong>: This gives Annihilape a chance to paralyze a foe, including Gholdengo that lack Covert Cloak, and turn the tables on fast Focus Sash foes like Flutter Mane and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: If using Focus Sash, Close Combat's Defense drop isn't as devastating, though it leaves more offensive Annihilape vulnerable to getting revenge killed by multi-hit users like Urshifu-R and Loaded Dice Scale Shot foes like Dragonite, Gouging Fire, and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an incredibly powerful move that can lock the opponent into an attacking move to boost Rage Fist's power. Alternatively, it can lock the opponent into a status move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse</strong>: This is an excellent way for Annihilape to retire itself from the battle while putting significant pressure on the opponent to switch out and shutting down gimmicks such as Baton Pass.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Endeavor</strong>: When paired with Focus Sash, Endeavor lets Annihilape massive amounts of damage before going down, though Annihilape's own bulk can lessen its effectiveness.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Annihilape is often used quite early in the game so Terastallization is often not needed unless it must check a specific threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Beyond offering a valuable Fairy resistance, the Ice and Fire resistances make Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-H, and Chi-Yu easier to deal with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has excellent defensive synergy with Annihilape thanks to the Fairy resistance and doing particularly well on spreads that are faster than -1 Chien-Pao to move before Sacred Sword lands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water lets Annihilape withstand Urshifu-R's Tera Water Surging Strike with any item on either Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison has a good matchup against Flutter Mane, and lets Annihilape deal with Toxic and Toxic Spikes without needing to Taunt or worry about Toxapex's Mental Herb.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Defiant</strong>: Defiant gives Annihilape the widest variety of winning match-ups, doing great against Intimidate Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Incineroar, punishing common Speed control foes like Rock Tomb Ogerpon-H, and ensuring that Charm Flutter Mane will not set up on Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: Vital Spirit adds to Annihilape’s flexibility against dangerous sleep inducers such as Yawn Ursaluna-B and Spore Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Inner Focus</strong>: This niche ability prevents flinches from Chien-Pao and Dragonite from happening, as well as stopping an Attack drop from Intimidate.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry can be used with specialized spreads to avoid certain 2HKOs and protect Annihilape from Urshifu-R's Tera-boosted Surging Strikes. Try to make sure to have an even HP stat, to ensure that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Even when using bulky EV spreads, Focus Sash is useful for surviving an attack from foes that can be difficult to EV for, such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Coba Berry</strong>: Coba Berry stops Tera Flying foes like Dragonite and Landorus-T from getting a surprise KO on Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roseli Berry</strong>: Roseli Berry works well on specially defensive EV spreads designed defeat Flutter Mane leads that lack Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Sitrus Berry EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Atk / 4 Def / 36 SpD / 220 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread outspeeds Adamant Urshifu formes plus Timid Archaludon and Gholdengo, survives Jolly Choice Band Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes on all but the highest roll, and has a 87.5% chance of surviving Modest Choice Specs Archaludon's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 140 Def / 124 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Thanks to Sitrus Berry, not even Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-R can OHKO Annihilape with Tera Water Surging Strikes! The Speed investment aims for Modest Gholdengo and Modest Archaludon, and also outspeeds up to Iron Bundle after a Speed drop from Rock Tomb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Atk / 4 Def / 220 SpD / 36 Spe with Careful</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized EV usually avoids a OHKO from Choice Specs Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, while outspeeding Adamant Breloom. It also survives Timid Tera-boosted Moonblast from Flutter Mane, meaning any Flutter Mane that gets a Speed boost from Booster Energy will be unable to OHKO Annihilape normally.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 196 Def / 68 Spe with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread avoids a 2HKO from Adamant Tera Fire Ogerpon-H and usually does the same for Adamant Life Orb Chien-Pao, while having enough Speed to outspeed Jolly Ogerpon formes after Rock Tomb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Def / 12 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong> This is the most offensive option for Sitrus Berry, surviving all but the highest roll from Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-R's Tera Water Surging Strikes, and having an astonishing 87.5% chance of OHKOing it with the now 200 BP Rage Fist!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 76 Attack / 4 Def / 12 SpD / 180 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread OHKOes up to Hippowdon with Final Gambit, while outspeeding Jolly Dragonite, and outspeeding Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle after a Speed drop from Rock Tomb. The Special Defense EVs dodge a OHKO from Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Beyond at least reaching a speedtie with opposing Annihilape, this spread avoids a OHKO from Timid Flutter Mane's unboosted Moonblast and even outspeeds paralyzed Speed boosted Flutter Mane. It also outspeeds paralyzed Iron Bundle after Booster Energy, but note that it often uses Substitute to block Fling.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to great bulk and the dangerous Rage Fist, Annihilape is a powerful bulky setup sweeper of Battle Stadium Singles.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt helps you deal with annoying support Pokemon like Whirlwind Ting-Lu, Thunder Wave Archaludon, and Hippowdon to mention a few, forcing them to attack and boost Rage Fist. This can work on Toxapex, but be warned that Toxapex commonly carries Mental Herb, which could get Annihilape poisoned if it doesn't Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an interesting alternative to Taunt, not able to directly shut down defensive answers to Annihilape, but it severely punishes them when Annihilape switches into a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant versus Vital Spirit</strong>: Defiant is the best option for this set, stopping Charm Flutter Mane from eeking out a win, and punishing common ways of dropping Annihilape's Attack such as Intimidate Landorus-T and Breaking Swipe Gouging Fire. Vital Spirit is easier to stop, but, it lets Annihilape can absorb sleep moves from foes like Yawn Ursaluna-B, Yawn Hippowdon, and Spore Breloom without needing Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is quite helpful at saving Annihilape from certain extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Flutter Mane, but Annihilape is perfectly functional without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison offers a better matchup against Flutter Mane, does well against Meowscarada's Flower Trick, and lets Annihilape freely switch into Toxic and Toxic Spikes later in the match. This also drastically reduces the risk of Taunting Toxapex, which makes this Tera type a menace against stall teams!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: In addition to giving a useful resistance to Fairy-, Fire-, and Ice-type attacks from dangerous foes like Flutter Mane, Ogerpon-H, and Chien-Pao, Tera Fire also protects Annihilape from burns.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a fantastic response to Urshifu-R, who otherwise can use Tera Water Surging Strikes to break through Annihilape regardless of Bulk Up boosts. It also works great against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, two powerful wallbreakers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel turns Annihilape's Psychic , Flying,and Fairy weakness into resistances, as well as being an excellent defensive type overall. It lets Annihilape deal with foes like Flutter Mane, Latios, and Iron Crown far more effectively at the cost of having issues with Ogerpon-H and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying is an effective Tera against stall teams for avoiding Fissure from Dondozo , forcing it to attack with moves that boost Rage Fist.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's residual recovery eases the long-game of setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs</strong>: Reducing the HP EVs to 244 gives Annihilape an even HP stat, which lets Annihilape recover its health with Sitrus Berry the moment it gets hit by Ruination. This makes dealing with Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien an easier task.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak makes Annihilape immune to being Salt Cured, making it a great check against Garganacl if using Taunt to prevent the deadly Tera Ghost Curse. It also gives peace of mind, avoiding potential flinches from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, or Special Defense drops from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximum Speed mainly helps Annihilape outspeed Timid Archaludon, Timid Gholdengo, Adamant Urshifu formes, and Modest Chi-Yu. The 4 Special Defense EVs are just enough to avoid being OHKOed by Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe with Careful</strong>: More special bulk can make it much more difficult for special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu to revenge kill Annihilape. This spread in particular has a 62.5% chance of surviving Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 Def / 100 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids an OHKO from +2 Chien-Pao, which can be especially helpful with Covert Cloak blocking the flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom while still giving Annihilape good special bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to Final Gambit and a decent Speed stat, Choice Scarf Annihilape can cause shocking upsets by revenge killing even bulky sweepers, such as Dragonite and Gouging Fire!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Claw versus Rage Fist</strong>: Shadow Claw is weak, but it's a reliable Ghost-type STAB move that can reliably OHKO offensive Flutter Mane even when using minimum Attack investment. Rage Fist is still preferred for being the more flexible option though, letting Annihilape potentially clean a weakened team if Final Gambit doesn't work out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant</strong>: While Vital Spirit's Sleep immunity increases Annihilape's switch-in potential, Defiant is the better ability for protecting it from being set up on by Charm Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong> U-turn turns Annihilape into a reasonable pivot and gets it out of unpredictable lead situations against unpredictable early-game offensive foes like Chien-Pao and Dragonite, though this will often lead your opponent to assume Annihilape is holding Choice Scarf even against naturally slower Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock is risky on a Choice Scarf Pokemon, but it can be useful early-game if Annihilape leads against foes it commonly scares out like Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an emergency way to punish set-up Pokemon Annihilape can switch into, such as Dragonite and Urshifu-S.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Since Annihilape often sacrifices itself with Final Gambit, Terastallization should only be done if Final Gambit isn't the path to winning the match, and is usually better with Rage Fist's increased late-game potential.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water stops Choice Scarf Urshifu-R from OHKOing Annihilape with Tera Water Surging Strikes, potentially turning a check into a sweeping vector with the now 200 BP Rage Fist!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel covers Annihilape's weakness to Fairy, Psychic, and Flying, all weaknesses that some potentially faster Speed boosted threats like Booster Energy Flutter Mane, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Latios seek to exploit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal gives Annihilape an immunity to Ghost-type attacks, potentially getting it a revenge kill against a bulky Flutter Mane it wouldn't otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While not very useful defensively, Tera Ghost seriously juices up Rage Fist's late-game sweeping potential, while still maintaining an important Normal-type priority immunity against Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Entei.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, Earth Power has a useful niche in that it can deal big damage to Glimmora without triggering Toxic Debris, as well as being more consistent into Stamina Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes versus Stealth Rock</strong>: Toxic Spikes support is fantastic on Clodsire, making it more difficult for opposing teams to play around getting poisoned. On the other hand, Stealth Rock can be used to pressure Poison- and Flying-types that might otherwise think they are safe from Clodsire's hazards, as well as being good support in general against Dragonite, Lunala and Focus Sash users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Amnesia</strong>: Amnesia elevates Clodsire's Special Defense to crazy levels, potentially shutting out special attacking aces like Miraidon and Terapagos, as well as Lugia when paired with Tera Dark.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Protect</strong>: In addition to benefiting from Leftovers and Black Sludge, Protect can pair well with the passive damage caused from either Toxic or Toxic Spikes.</li> </ul> <h4>Abilities</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water Absorb</strong>: Water Absorb has fantastic defensive utility in the current format against Urshifu-R’s Surging Strikes, Kyogre’s Water Spout, and Alomomola’s Flip Turn, and can even be combined with Terastallization to further disrupt Water-type Pokemon like the above.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Unaware</strong>: Unaware make Clodsire more consistent against the likes of Nasty Plot Calyrex-S and Calm Mind Miraidon.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Even with Clodsire's high Special Defense, the burst healing from Sitrus Berry goes a long way. With full special bulk investment, Sitrus Berry let's Clodsire always avoids the 2HKO from Choice Specs Miraidon's Draco Meteor after the Special Attack drop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge versus Leftovers</strong>: Black Sludge may seem appealing, but it punishes Clodsire for Terastallizing unless it becomes Tera Poison, so Leftovers is preferred unless Leftovers is already on something else.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If running something other than a Dark-type Terastallization, Covert Cloak is an alternate option to preventing Psychic Noise's heal block.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Clodsire's support focus often draws in Taunt users, so Mental Herb is one way to make sure a critical turn of Toxic or Toxic Spikes use still happens.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Clodsire is often a part of defensive cycles that help cover its weaknesses, but Terastallization can generate big momentum when used at the right time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Lugia's Psychic Noise is an issue for Clodsire, so Tera Dark can flip the tables on it as well as resisting Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S and Shadow Ball from Flutter Mane; keep in mind though that both Calyrex-S and Flutter Mane can heavily punish Clodsire's new Fairy-type weakness, so timing is key. Finally, Tera Dark also prevents Prankster Grimmsnarl from shutting down Clodsire with Taunt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost's Fighting-type immunity combined with Water Absorb can make Urshifu-R miserable even if Clodsire hasn't invested in physical bulk. It also allows Clodsire to escape from Shadow Tag Gothitelle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal's Ghost-type immunity makes walling Calyrex-S even easier and, unlike Tera Dark, avoids gaining a Fairy-type weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: With Tera Poison, Clodsire maintains its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes and can also safely run Black Sludge to punish users of Trick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: While Water Absorb prevents Kyogre from using its powerful Water-type attacks, Tera Electric goes further by taking away Clodsire's weakness to Ice Beam while still being strong against Thunder and paralysis.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternative EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>252 HP / 100 Def / 156 Spe with Careful or Calm</strong>: This spread sacrifices some special bulk in order to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Tera Normal Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</li> </ul>"

Low Kick does more damage to Ting-Lu, other Kingambit and Tera Normal Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Thunder Wave isn't a particularly common move on Kingambit, potentially letting it surprise some switch-ins like Iron Moth and Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Guillotine</strong>: With Guillotine, passive play from foes like Corviknight and Dondozo becomes far more risky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is effective at shutting down common support Pokemon such as Dondozo and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Fairy Blast is Kingambit's best shot against Iron Hands, one of its biggest checks.

It also lets Great Tusk hit troublesome Focus Sash Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Gengar, something Rapid Spin can't do.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: If using Tera Steel, Iron Head is a decent option for OHKOing Flutter Mane without using Headlong Rush, and it deals heavy damage to Baxcalibur and Tera Fairy Rotom-W.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization can help with Great Tusk's poor special bulk by resisting certain hits, but it works fine without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel greatly aids against the many Fairy-, Ice-, and Flying-types that would otherwise prey on Great Tusk, such as Mimikyu, Iron Bundle, and Tera Flying Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water massively improves the matchup against Chien-Pao, and can let Great Tusk survive an encounter with offensive Iron Moth or Chi-Yu that lack Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: The furious increase in power Tera Ground provides can be useful late game, giving Earthquake a high chance to OHKO even defensive Gholdengo and Headlong Rush the ability to 2HKO Terastallized Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Not only does Tera Fighting improve the Chien-Pao matchup, but it OHKOs even the bulkiest Ting-Lu with Close Combat.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: This patches up Great Tusk's poor Special Defense, which can be paired with the correct Tera Type to help against foes like Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, Iron Moth, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: When saving Great Tusk for late-game sweeps, Booster Energy is preferred over Life Orb for preserving its HP against priority attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash on such a bulky Pokemon may seem wasteful, but it vastly improves Great Tusk's matchups against special attackers such as Rotom-W and makes setting up Stealth Rock a far simpler task. If using Focus Sash, consider using the first alternate EV spread below.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li><strong>4 HP / 12 Def / 236 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This EV spread survives Adamant Focus Sash Meowscarada's Flower Trick followed by Sucker Punch, making it a good spread to use if using Focus Sash and Rapid Spin.</li> </ul> <h5>Assault Vest EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p>All of these EV spreads will at least avoid a 2HKO from Modest Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire if using Tera Steel.

Dragon Tail from Garchomp and Dragonite, and OHKO moves from the likes of Dondozo and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Dragonite is such a problematic foe that hitting it hard is worth more than a Fighting-type STAB move.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Body Press</strong>: Although it is difficult to fit in without sacrificing utility or coverage, Body Press is a reasonable option if a Fighting-type STAB move is needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat does not gel well with the defensive nature of this set, but it deals far more damage to Ting-Lu than any of Great Tusk's other options.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Great Tusk is a good bulky sweeper on its own, but Terstallization makes it far more difficult to revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Not only is Tera Water an excellent option against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, but it also means Dondozo will never break Great Tusk's Substitute with Wave Crash, and Assault Vest Azumarill become an easy target to set up on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a great option for dealing with Great Tusk's weaknesses, such as Fairy-types and makes Iron Bundle usually fail to 2HKO specially defensive Great Tusk without Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a decent alternative to Tera Steel, providing the vital Fairy-type resistance without the weaknesses to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks and an extremely useful immunity to being poisoned that eases the match-up against Toxic Spikes foes such as Clodsire and Meowscarada.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Fire is not a great defensive type; however, not only does it do well against Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane, it also protects Great Tusk from fast Will-O-Wisp users such as Dragapult, Mimikyu, and Volcarona.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: The residual recovery from Leftovers best suits the slow set-up of this set, especially if using Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Depending on the EV spread, Booster Energy can boost Attack or Speed to increase Great Tusk's late-game cleaning potential.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If a Garganacl check is desperately needed, Covert Cloak Great Tusk is up for the task.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 140 Atk / 4 Def / 36 SpD / 140 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom and the rare Timid Abomasnow, survives Timid Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry, and has a very good chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Adamant Azumarill after using Bulk Up. The Attack EVs OHKO Chien-Pao and defensive Gholdengo with Earthquake after Bulk Up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread gains a Speed boost from Protosynthesis, making Great Tusk an even better late-game sweeper at the cost of physical bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 20 Atk / 84 Def / 20 SpD / 140 Spe with Impish</strong>: This EV spread is meant for use with Tera Steel or Tera Poison, maintaining Great Tusk's Substitute against Dondozo's Wave Crash after Terastallization. It also outspeeds Adamant Breloom and the rare Timid Abomasnow, and survives Timid Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: Maximum investment in special bulk makes Great Tusk much more difficult to revenge kill with the likes of Gholdengo and Iron Bundle. The 4 Attack EVs gives an Attack boost from Protosynthesis, which is preferred for improving the Skeledirge matchup and sweeping more easily.</p> </li> </ul>"

It's also a fantastic response to Baton Pass foes such as Espathra and opposing Scream Tail.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb's additional Speed control is helpful against threats that boost their Speed, such as Dragonite and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: While a rather weak STAB move, Dazzling Gleam threatening to 2HKO offensive Great Tusk can make it a good way to punish Rapid Spin use.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: Flamethrower 2HKOes Scizor, though it does not 2HKO Gholdengo, making Recover sets still problematic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Disable</strong>: Disable is particularly apt at ruining Choice item foes that need a specific move to 2HKO Scream Tail, such as Scizor, though compared to Encore, it's less useful against support moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Fangs</strong>: In addition to 2HKOing Iron Moth, Psychic Fangs breaking dual screens can be extremely useful, though this doesn't work against Grimmsnarl.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal might seem like an underwhelming defensive option, but taking on Ghost-type attacks while avoiding a 2HKO from Gholdengo can be valuable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel gives a vital Steel resistance and is a great defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy improves Scream Tail's matchup against Dark-types such as Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: If using Flamethrower, Tera Fire Scream Taill will have a 97.3% chance to 2HKO Tera Steel Scizor, making it an effective lure.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Blocking the first use of Taunt makes Scream Tail an extremely reliable setter of Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is the safest way to increase Scream Tail's longetivity, and it can avoid certain 2HKOs depending on the EV spread, such as that from Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump with specially defensive spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Light Ball</strong>: Light Ball is a requirement when using Fling, ensuring Scream Tail can inflict paralysis once and get rid of Choice items with one move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy being instantly consumed makes Scream Tail less flexible, but boosting Speed lets it outspeed key threats such as Dragapult. This item can also be used with bulkier EV spreads to make Scream Tail even bulkier, pulling off incredible stunts such as surviving Timid Choice Specs Gholdengo's Make It Rain.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p>Scream Tail has an incredible number of viable EV spreads at its disposal: consider these as mere examples rather than all of its viable EV spreads!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 156 SpD / 172 Spe with Calm or Careful</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Baxcalibur and Great Tusk and survives Timid Choice Specs Iron Moth's Sludge Wave 93.7% of the time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 124 SpD / 204 Spe with Calm or Careful</strong>: The Speed investment outspeeds Jolly Annihilape, and Scream Tail avoids OHKOs from Timid Gholdengo and Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>220 HP / 220 Def / 68 SpD with Calm or Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids an OHKO from Timid Gholdengo's Make It Rain after Stealth Rock damage, and Scream Tail has a 93.7% chance of surviving Tera Steel Scizor's Choice Band Bullet Punch. If outspeeding Baxcalibur and Great Tusk is a must, a Speed-boosting nature and 68 Speed EVs can be used instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid or Jolly</strong>: With maximum Speed investment, Scream Tail outspeeds not only Iron Moth, but also major Encore targets such as Garchomp and Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul>"

With the lack of Sleep Clause, this Speed turns Brute Bonnet into a terrifying sleep inducer!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Crunch versus Sucker Punch</strong>: Crunch is the preferred STAB move, reliably hitting the most common Spore check, Gholdengo, which makes it the ideal STAB attack to use with Substitute. However, Sucker Punch lets Brute Bonnet pick off threats when it doesn't have the chance to Spore and set up Trailblaze.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Substitute</strong>: On one hand, Close Combat deals massive damage to Dark-type resistances, such as Roaring Moon, but it leaves Brute Bonnet fairly vulnerable to priority attacks. On the other hand, Spore gives Brute Bonnet ample opportunity to set up Substitute, easing the cost of early wake ups.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Powering up Crunch makes it easier to sweep with Crunch or Sucker Punch while still leaving it immune to Grimmsnarl's Prankster Taunt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire turns Brute Bonnet's devastating U-turn and Fairy-type weaknesses into resistances, giving it the edge against Flutter Mane and letting it fry Scizor and Tinkaton with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison grants Brute Bonnet important resistances to U-turn, Fighting, and Fairy without compromising itself against Water-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: With Tera Fairy, Brute Bonnet deals with Dragon-types far more reliably, and gains a valuable tool against opposing Dark- and Dragon-types with Tera Blast.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 100 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Adamant</strong>: With Adamant, Brute Bonnet will still outspeed Great Tusk and Annihilape after Trailblaze and Dragapult after two uses of Trailblaze.

Nontheless, Seed Bomb is the more reliable option when not using Loaded Dice.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute is easy to set up thanks to Spore and eases the risk early wake-ups can pose. If using Substitute, using Crunch or Payback over Sucker Punch is preferred due to the issues Substitute Gholdengo can cause.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Crunch versus Payback</strong>: Having a reliable Dark-type STAB move is helpful when facing foes like Substitute Gholdengo. Payback has higher damage potential, but Crunch won't have its power dropped by foes switching in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat crushes Roaring Moon and opposing Brute Bonnet, though the drop in bulk can be troublesome for this set.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark works fantastically with Sucker Punch, giving Brute Bonnet good revenge killing capability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison covers Brute Bonnet's major weaknesses to U-turn, Fairy, and Fighting, giving it an easy chance to use Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness can be troublesome, Tera Fire still does well against Flutter Mane and lets Brute Bonnet melt Scizor and Tinkaton with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Powerful Dragon-type attacks such as Outrage and Draco Meteor can be turned into Spore bait with Tera Fairy, in addition to arming Brute Bonnet with a powerful Tera Blast against them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: If using Bullet Seed, Tera Grass can make sense for increasing the chance of shooting down Focus Sash leads such as Flutter Mane and still keeping the Spore immunity against Breloom and opposing Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: The extra recovery pairs very well with Spore and Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: If not using Substitute, the quick burst of recovery with Sitrus Berry is preferred.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: Guaranteeing 4 hits with Bullet Seed means Brute Bonnet will always OHKO Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle through their Focus Sash, and the higher chance for 5 hits can even shoot down Mimikyu and offensive Great Tusk.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also heavily disrupts enemy special attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Power Gem</strong>: Power Gem gets a bit of extra damage against Fire-types like Ogerpon-H and Incineroar, which can be relevant when using Tera Stellar.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Calm Mind + Substitute is a classic duo that greatly assists Flutter Mane's setup attempts, allowing it to set up in-front of Thunder Wave Porygon2. Even without Calm Mind, it can save Flutter Mane from devastating uses of Thunder Wave from the likes of Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is hugely disruptive against a variety of support Pokemon, such as Swampert, Ting-Lu, and Porygon2.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Stellar Tera Blast</strong>: With Tera Stellar, Tera Blast can be some good insurance against Pokemon with unpredictable Terastallization options, but the Special Attack drop doesn't gel well with Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draining Kiss</strong>: When using extremely bulky Flutter Mane variants, Draining Kiss can be paired with Calm Mind to keep it around much longer. However, Tera Fairy is highly recommended when using this, as Draining Kiss is otherwise very weak.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Flutter Mane's incredible Speed is put to good use, outspeeding almost everything in the metagame with the major exceptions being Booster Energy Iron Bundle and the very rare Choice Scarf Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash patches up Flutter Mane's poor physical bulk, giving it new revenge kill chances.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p>All of these EV spreads are designed to give Flutter Mane a Speed Boost with Protosynthesis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 108 Defense / 140 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: The Defense investment usually allows Flutter Mane to survive Sucker Punch from Adamant Chien-Pao.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Flutter Mane utilizes high Speed and Thunder Wave to become a status spreader and sweeper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hex versus Shadow Ball</strong>: Hex is normally preferred for dealing massive damage after a successful Thunder Wave. Shadow Ball can be used if consistent damage is more desirable and is almost always the stronger option against Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is a great complement to Thunder Wave, shutting down opposing disruption and setup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pain Split</strong>: Pain Split can be used after a KO to heavily disrupt the next target and possibly stall out weaker attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mystical Fire</strong>: Defense-invested Flutter Mane can live unboosted Bullet Punch from Scizor and hit it back hard with Mystical Fire.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired with full paralysis chances and Pain Split, Flutter Mane can live for much longer than expected and snag some sneaky KOs. The main drawback is that Flutter Mane can only run one attack, usually Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: Booster Energy sets can still make great use of Calm Mind.

It allows Flutter Mane to cleanly beat Focus Sash Chien-Pao and Urshifu in a single turn, while making the combination of Thunder Wave into Hex much more potent into offensive Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 Def / 20 Spe with Bold or Timid</strong>: This spread gives great survivability, surviving unboosted Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and unboosted Bullet Punch from Scizor. 20 Speed EVs ensures that Booster Energy boosts Speed, outrunning Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Gouging Fire.

The Speed boost can also come in handy later against threats like Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The Defense investment avoids an OHKO from Jolly Landorus-T's Earthquake.

Its Steel-typing further makes it well-suited to clearing out Toxic Spikes mid-match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Endeavor</strong>: When used with defensive investment, Endeavor can be used to devastating effect against Ground-type checks that can't OHKO with Earthquake.

On Booster Energy sets, it can help overcome Swords Dance Chien-Pao that try to set up while Iron Treads uses Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While situational, Tera Ghost can guarantee you get a low HP Endeavor off against Extreme Speed Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy increases Iron Treads's speed even further, allowing it to outspeed key targets like Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao, making it very likely to get a move off first.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash is an option for ensuring Iron Treads can get at least one move off against faster foes that can KO it.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 92 Atk / 4 Def / 12 SpD / 212 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread is meant for Booster Energy sets.

The Speed investment outruns up to Timid Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: For Focus Sash sets, a simple offensive spread is often sufficient.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Good Speed, the useful ability to absorb Toxic Spikes, and great coverage make Iron Moth a reasonable alternative to other offensive Fire-types like Chi-Yu and Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Meteor Beam and Power Herb</strong>: Beyond being a more flexible way to boost Iron Moth's Special Attack than other options, Meteor Beam and Power Herb let Iron Moth crush opposing Fire-types who can otherwise use their bulk to be an issue, like Entei and opposing Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat</strong>: Even with the lack of extra coverage, Overheat is so strong that very few Pokemon can safely switch into it if using Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Energy Ball</strong>: Energy Ball is highly recommended to hit Urshifu-R and Ursaluna-B as hard as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Dazzling Gleam makes sense with Tera Fairy, dealing huge damage to Roaring Moon and OHKOing Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Iron Moth stands out as a good choice for an offensive Toxic Spikes setter, though note that it fears Ting-Lu far more than Meowscarada.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: If not using a Choice item, coverage can be sacrificed in exchange for giving Iron Moth the ability to outspeed major threats such as Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Iron Moth's sheer offensive power and good Speed tier means Terastallization isn't integral to it, but it can be a good tool to stop revenge kills.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass massively improves Iron Moth's matchup against common foes like Urshifu-R, Landorus-T, and Primarina, and also prevents the rare Breloom lead from launching Spore successfully.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives coverage against other Fire-types with Tera Blast, and is still a good option to prevent Choice Scarf Urshfu-R from revenge killing with Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost pairs best with Meteor Beam or Booster Energy variants, letting Iron Moth dodge Normal-type priority that would usually revenge kill it from Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Entei.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: When paired with Overheat and Choice Specs, Tera Fire means Fire-resistant foes aren't safe; with even physically defensive Incineroar taking over 60% from it!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: The Dark-type resistance Tera Fairy provides can be a good way to catch Chien-Pao off guard after its Focus Sash has been broken, and saves Iron Moth from Urshifu-S's Sucker Punch.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: While Booster Energy does make this Iron Moth less flexible in terms of switching out, the extra power can allow Iron Moth to run bulkier EV spreads, and the lack of recoil like Life Orb can make it a good late-game cleaner too.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs turns Iron Moth into a full blown wallbreaker.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash makes predicting against foes like Landorus-T less troublesome, and is a perfect fit if setting up Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Iron Moth's good special bulk makes Assault Vest a fine choice, letting it survive new attacks such as an unboosted Hydro Pump from Iron Bundle. It can be paired with bulkier EV spreads for even more impressive feats!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf outspeeds important threats such as Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Dragapult, who could otherwise outspeed and KO Iron Moth. Note that this item does compete heavily with the more powerful Chi-Yu, so make sure aspects of Iron Moth like Toxic Spikes absorption are important to the team.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Bulkier EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>164 HP / 100 Def / 60 SpA / 4 SpD / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: This EV spread survives Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Life Orb Chien-Pao's Throat Chop from full health, survives two Shadow Balls from Modest Flutter Mane that lack an offensive boost, and outspeeds Modest Chi-Yu and Adamant Urshifu formes. If using Assault Vest, even Choice Specs Flutter Mane fails to 2HKO with Shadow Ball!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 28 Def / 160 SpA / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: This Assault Vest based spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball, and OHKOes Iron Bundle with Fiery Dance.</p> </li> </ul>"
      },
      "Speedy Booster Energy": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Booster Energy in its circuits, Iron Moth can sacrifice some of its power to become a surprisingly effective late-game sweeper and emergency revenge killer. While Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle are the usual go-to for this, Iron Moth doesn't have to worry about Toxic Spikes or Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Energy Ball</strong>: Energy Ball is the best option for dealing damage to bulky foes like Ting-Lu and Suicune, and it also OHKOes Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Dazzling Gleam is Iron Moth's ticket to overloading Dragon-types like Garchomp and Roaring Moon, who can otherwise stop a sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes versus Toxic</strong>: This Iron Moth set is arguably the fastest offensive Toxic Spikes setter that makes sense, making it a reasonable option for Toxic Spike loving teammates like Garganacl. Toxic on the other hand, directly puts a timer on common bulky switch-ins like Dragonite and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: While not providing great coverage overall, Psychic is Iron Moth's best move against Toxapex and opposing Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The given EV Spread ensures Iron Moth gets a Speed boost upon consuming Booster Energy while providing as much protection from priority attacks as possible. It also avoids a OHKO from Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T's Flying Tera Blast.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong> If saved for late game, Iron Moth can often get itself in a position to sweep without worrying about revenge kills. Terastallization however, can reduce its vulnerability to certain priority attacks and allow it to be used earlier.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is among the best options, preventing foes Aqua Jet Urshifu-R from from easily stopping a late-game sweep, plus dealing big damage to physically defensive Ting-Lu with Energy Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water still aids against Urshifu-R, but does so while not being OHKOed by Choice Scarf Landorus-T's Flying Tera Blast, at the cost of doing less well against bulky Water and Ground Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost blocks common Normal-type priority, from foes like Dragonite, Entei, and Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy punishes Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S from attempting to revenge kill with Sucker Punch.</p> </li> </ul>"
      },
      "Toxic Spreader": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Iron Moth may seem like a strange Pokemon to use as a bulky Toxic spreader, but it sets itself apart from other Pokemon like Toxapex thanks to being far less passive and having access to phazing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fiery Dance</strong>: While Fiery Dance is not a particularly reliable away to sweep, taking the chance is worth it considering Iron Moth's Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes versus Toxic</strong>: Toxic Spikes is the preferred option for its excellent team support for bulky Pokemon like Garganacl, Charm Flutter Mane, and Latias. Toxic on the other hand, lets Iron Moth independently punish bulky responses to it like Ting-Lu and Porygon2.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Whirlwind</strong>: A phazing move may not seemingly gel well with Speed investment, but it has incredible utility when Toxic Spikes are set up, punishing teams that leave their Toxic Spikes absorber in on Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sludge Wave versus Energy Ball</strong>: Giving up on Whirlwind does lose a unique selling point as a Toxic Spikes setter, but in exchange makes Iron Moth much harder to check with Chi-Yu and Primarina. Sludge Wave's damage output makes it the best choice, but Energy Ball stops Swampert from having a field day.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: When the aim is to simply set up Toxic Spikes, Terastallization is not that important. However, Iron Moth's typing gives it enough weaknesses that Terastallization can give it a far longer life span.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Iron Moth a resistance to Water-type moves without losing its resistance to Ice and Fire, which is helpful against Urshifu-R, Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu. It's also a great type to use with Tera Blast for dealing damage to Chi-Yu and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass lets Iron Moth deal with powerful Earthquakes from the likes of Ting-Lu and Landorus-T, gives it a vital resistance to Water, and nullifies Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dark resistance can surprise Chien-Pao looking to revenge kill Iron Moth and protects it from powerful Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Choice Band Dragonite and Gouging Fire.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy can be paired with specialized EV spreads to either get easier KOs, gain a Speed boost, or survive surprising special attacks at the cost of the flexibility of more general EV spreads designed to switch in multiple times.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: The quick burst of recovery Sitrus Berry gives can be paired with specialized EV spreads, allowing Iron Moth to survive a wider range of attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak protects Iron Moth from the dreaded Salt Cure, which can otherwise put a timer on phazing. It also prevents specially defensive Iron Moth from losing to Chi-Yu's flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Black Sludge</strong>: Leftovers's residual recovery pairs well with using Whirlwind as much as possible, but it's a fairly high-value item. Black Sludge is an acceptable alternative, but note that it will hurt Iron Moth after Terastallization if not using Tera Poison.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Booster Energy Exclusive EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 244 Def / 36 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe with Modest</strong>: This Booster Energy optimized spread OHKOes 4 Special Defense EVs Iron Bundle with a Quark Drive-boosted Fiery Dance while having good enough physical bulk to have a good chances of surviving powerful attacks from full health, like Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Psyshock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 220 SpD / 36 Spe with Calm</strong>: This EV spread gives Iron Moth a Special Defense boost with Quark Drive, making it so bulky that even a Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu has a low chance of 2HKOing it with Dark Pulse!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Sitrus Berry Exclusive EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p>When using Sitrus Berry, make sure to run an even HP stat, so that one use of Ruination will activate it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 228 Def / 100 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread almost always survives two hits from Jolly Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Crunch with Sitrus Berry, and it outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 188 Def / 12 SpA / 12 SpD / 52 Spe with Bold</strong>: This EV spread has around a 90% chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Adamant Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Crunch. The minor Special Defense investment also avoids a 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse and Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 228 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe with Modest</strong>: This EV spread survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Psyshock from full health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 HP / 132 SpD / 180 Spe with Calm</strong>: This EV spread almost always avoids the 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse while outspeeding it alongside Adamant Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 SpD / 100 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Annihilape and, as a bonus, gives Leftovers Iron Moth a nearly guaranteed chance to avoid being 2HKOed by Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse and Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 52 Def / 4 SpA / 12 SpD / 196 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread sacrifices some bulk to outspeed Garchomp while still surviving Life Orb Chien-Pao's Crunch and having a great shot of surviving two uses of Dark Pulse from Timid Chi-Yu. It also gets a Speed boost from Quark Drive.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Benchmarks for Speed EVs</h5> <p>Like many fast bulky Pokemon, Iron Moth has a huge variety of viable EV builds. If you'd like to make your own EV spread though, keep these Speed tiers in mind! Natures that can efficiently use these Speed tiers will be mentioned.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>36 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature</strong>: This is the minimum amount of Speed to run, outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>52 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature</strong>: This outspeeds Modest Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>76 Speed EVs with Timid or 180 Speed EVs with Calm</strong> This outspeeds Modest Chi-Yu and Adamant Urshifu formes. Note that Timid will give Iron Moth a bonus point to Speed, but a Calm nature has a greater chance of surviving some special attacks with specific EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>132 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This is the minimum investment for Iron Moth to get a Speed boost from Quark Drive, assuming no Special Attack investment, since doing so will increase Special Attack instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>156 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Urshifu formes and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With good bulk, an immunity to burn, multiple ways to boost its Speed, Baxcalibur is a unique and dangerous sweeper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icicle Spear</strong>: Icicle Spear KOes Breloom and Mimikyu through Focus Sash and Disguise respectively, and is also more reliable than Scale Shot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Dance versus Swords Dance</strong>: Dragon Dance's Speed boost is generally more effective against offensive teams, but Swords Dance is still viable for breaking through more defensive foes like Corviknight due to Scale Shot still providing a Speed boost. Swords Dance also pairs nicely with Ice Shard for late-game sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Ice Shard means Baxcalibur will have a difficult time breaking past bulky Steel-types early-game, but it makes it an effective cleaner otherwise, especially with Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly versus Adamant</strong>: Jolly ensures that Baxcalibur outspeeds Dragapult after one Speed boost, but Adamant makes plenty of sense with Ice Shard or when using Dragon Dance with Scale Shot.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash may seem like a waste with Baxcalibur's bulk, but it provides new set up opportunities and eases match-ups against other Dragon-types, though Icicle Spear and Scale Shot become far less reliable.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is required for Baxcalibur to cover the most amount of threats via Tera Blast, and patches up its mediocre defensive typing, but Baxcalibur's bulk and tendency to force switches means it's still viable without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground makes Earthquake an especially reliable sweeping tool, removes most of Baxcalibur's weaknesses, and makes it immune to Thunder Wave from the likes of Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric lets Baxcalibur set-up against Gholdengo and Scizor, and when paired with Tera Blast, is Baxcalibur's best way of wearing down Dondozo, The paralysis immunity also helps Baxcalibur set up against Serperior with less risk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy protects Baxcalibur from faster Dragon-types like Garchomp, and lets Baxcalibur come out on top against Terastallized Scale Shot Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost provides even better protection against Fighting-type attacks than Tera Fairy, and ensures that Dragonite doesn't revenge kill Baxcalibur with Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: With a Tera type of Steel, Baxcalibur has a much better matchup against Dragon-types and Mimikyu, and a handy resistance to Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> </li> </ul>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Baxcalibur's fantastic bulk, immunity to burns, and access to a priority attack make it a strong option for an Assault Vest tank, despite its iffy defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icicle Spear</strong>: Icicle Spear is recommended despite its inconsistent damage, as it deals damage through Mimikyu's disguise and potentially KOes Focus Sash users like Breloom and Meowscarada. Just be careful about hitting Stamina Archaludon, who can threaten to gain multiple Defense boosts from it.</p> </li> <li> <p>**Glaive Rush versus Scale Shot **: Glaive Rush makes Baxcalibur very vulnerable to getting KOed the next turn (especially by OHKO users like Fissure Dondozo), but it is still the least risky Dragon-type STAB move. Remember that Ice Shard will remove Glaive Rush's negative effects as well. Scale Shot's Defense drop may not seem like it gels well with this set's bulky focus, but the Speed boost can lead to some late-game clean-ups that would be impossible otherwise.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Icicle Crash</strong>: Icicle Crash's chance of missing and being less effective against Dragonite's Multiscale and Mimikyu's Disguise usually makes it the inferior choice to Icicle Spear, but it doesn't risk activating Archaludon's Stamina multiple times, as well as potentially flipping matches by occasionally flinching slower foes like Ursaluna-B.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Baxcalibur is fully functional without Terastallization, but doing so makes it a far more effective tank due to its poor defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: A Ground Tera type gives Baxcalibur a reliable STAB move in Earthquake, resistance to Stealth Rock, and removes a ton of weaknesses, at the cost of becoming more vulnerable to Primarina, Basculegion, and Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: With Tera Electric, Baxcalibur's Tera Blast deals massive damage to Corviknight that lack a set up move, and helps break through Primarina. Tera Electric also makes Baxcalibur a great Gholdengo check thanks to resisting Steel.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy helps Baxcalibur against opposing Terastallizations from Dragon-types like Garchomp and Hydreigon, though being weak to Steel is a big problem.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This simple EV spread maximizes Baxcalibur's bulk and power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 204 Atk / 52 Spe with Adamant</strong>: If using Scale Shot, this Speed investment outspeeds Garchomp, who will often Terastallize in front of Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 156 Atk / 236 Spe with Adamant</strong>: The Speed investment here outspeeds Modest Gholdengo and Adamant Dragonite at the cost of some bulk, in addition to outspeeding Meowscarada after Scale Shot.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Trick and an immunity to status moves, Gholdengo is a dangerous Choice item attacker for offensive and stall teams alike!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Nasty Plot</strong>: This can be used to give Gholdengo more bite against defensive, slower teams after using Trick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt OHKOes Pelipper and matches Make It Rain for damage against Primarina. It also stops Tera Water Garganacl from walling Gholdengo. It does make Gholdengo very vulnerable to Ground-types like Ursaluna-B and Garchomp though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Blast</strong>: Focus Blast slices through Kingambit, who otherwise walls Gholdengo, but the accuracy can be a big issue in close matches.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Power Gem</strong>: Power Gem severly punishes Volcarona switch-ins, who otherwise can be very difficult to deal with. Otherwise, most Pokemon weak to Rock-type attacks will take more damage from Make It Rain.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Dazzling Gleam can be paired with Tera Fairy to crush Hydreigon, though Make It Rain deals more damage to most other Dragon-type targets like Dragonite and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: With this, Gholdengo outspeeds key threats such as Garchomp, Dragapult, and Hydreigon. It also outspeeds Meowscarada, but beware of Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs make Gholdengo much more difficult to wall, with Assault Vest Ursaluna-B in particular being much easier to break through.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid or Modest</strong>: Gholdengo mirror matches are common enough that maximizing Speed is usually a wise idea.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Nasty Plot makes Gholdengo a terror against slower teams, especially with its good bulk, unpredictable coverage, and diverse Tera Types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute lets Gholdengo avoid residual damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure and eases prediction in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Blast</strong>: Despite its reliability issues, Focus Blast OHKOes Kingambit, who otherwise is a great check against Gholdengo, in addition to ripping through Ursaluna-B switch-ins.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Psyshock</strong>: Psyshock lets Gholdengo break through Clodsire more easily as well as OHKOing Sneasler without a boost.

Note that both are viable together if you're willing to give up a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired together with Toxic Spikes, Protect and Substitute makes even foes that should beat Wo-Chien get worn down before they can KO it, such as Chi-Yu. Substitute itself protects Wo-Chien from slow users of Yawn such as Dondozo and Hippowdon, and slow OHKO moves from Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ruination</strong>: Ruination gives Wo-Chien powerful chipping down potential, though it should never be used as Wo-Chien's only attack due to it being extremely difficult to KO with.

Toxapex is one of the best options thanks to its good defensive synergy with Wo-Chien, but other options include Iron Moth, Glimmora, Clodsire, Focus Sash Meowscarada, and the niche Gengar.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Snarl</strong>: Snarl makes fearsome special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu far easier to switch into when Wo-Chien needs to escape, though Wo-Chien will need to have the correct Tera Type to outstall these foes itself.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain</strong>: In addition to providing some extra recovery, Ingrain makes phazers such as Ting-Lu and Hippowdon fail to stop Wo-Chien consistently, though Wo-Chien being trapped is a serious drawback.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Despite Wo-Chien's fantastic bulk, its vulnerability to Toxic Spikes and poor defensive typing mean it must often Terastallize to stall out teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison provides a vital resistance to Fairy and Fighting, and it also lets Wo-Chien absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Besides being a great defensive type, Tera Fairy helps Wo-Chien against Fighting-types that'd normally beat it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water provides Ice and Fire resistances, helpful against Baxcalibur, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives useful resistances to Fairy, Fire, and Ice, which help against major threats like Flutter Mane, Baxcalibur, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Wo-Chien's stalling playstyle makes Leftovers the most consistent recovery item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Big Root</strong>: If another Pokemon desperately needs Leftovers, Big Root is a viable alternative for getting extra recovery from Leech Seed and Giga Drain.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads and Adjustments</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish or Bold</strong>: Maximizing Wo-Chien's physical bulk lets it pull off some incredible stunts, such as avoiding a 3HKO from Breloom's Mach Punch with Leftovers and, after Terastallization, avoiding a 2HKO from Choice Band Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful or Calm</strong>: With the correct Tera Type and maximum Special Defense, Wo-Chien can take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle much more effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using 60 SpA EVs</strong>: If you're willing to give up a bit of bulk, this investment is required to OHKO Iron Bundle with Giga Drain with either a Bold or a Calm nature.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using 100 Speed EVs</strong>: With some sacrifice to bulk, this Speed investment lets Wo-Chien outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Kingambit, and it can be vital in Wo-Chien mirror matches after Terastallization makes it vulnerable to Leech Seed, due to Substitute blocking Leech Seed.</p> </li> </ul>"

Additionally, not being a contact move allows Chien-Pao to avoid unnecessary chip damage from Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch</strong>: Sucker Punch offers priority with a strong base power. While it comes with the cost of necessitating prediction, it is effectively mandatory for putting extreme pressure on Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Sword</strong>: Sacred Sword provides coverage for Pokemon that resist one or both of Chien-Pao's STAB attacks, like Chi-Yu and other Chien-Pao. Additionally, ignoring defense boosts allows Chien-Pao to deal more consistent damage to foes who boost their Defense like Archaludon and Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: With Chien-Pao's incredible power, Tera Blast can be used to surprise would-be checks with powerful super-effective attacks!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Crunch</strong>: Crunch is a more standard Dark-type attack that can pressure switch-ins as well as passive targets like Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brick Break</strong>: While Brick Break isn't as powerful as Sacred Sword, it does break dual screens and still provides excellent damage against opposing Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: Swords Dance boosts Chien-Pao's Attack to unwallable levels, making it an even more potent sweeper.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sheer Cold</strong>: While an OHKO move may look out of place on Chien-Pao and ultimately rely on luck, it cannot be understated how powerful it is to flip a matchup like Dondozo or Ho-oh on its head.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Ice Shard is a more consistent albeit weaker priority move compared to Sucker Punch that doesn't require attack prediction.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant gives Chien-Pao a significant power boost for sniping Pokemon with Sucker Punch, but Jolly is important for Speed tying with Flutter Mane and opposing Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>0-1 SpA IV</strong>: If using Tera Blast on Jolly Chien-Pao, make sure to use a SpA IV that's 0-1. This is because if Flutter Mane uses Charm, any SpA IV that's higher will result in Tera Blast becoming a Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Fangs</strong>: Psychic Fangs is an alternative to Brick Break for dealing with dual screens while also dealing good damage to Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lash Out</strong>: Lash Out is a situational but powerful response to Charm Flutter Mane thanks to the doubled BP on the turn Chien-Pao's Attack is lowered.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: This is the most reliable item for Chien-Pao, almost always guaranteeing Chien-Pao at least one attack and flipping many potential match-ups such as offensive Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb makes Chien-Pao a terrifying sweeper and wall-breaker in one!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: While Sitrus Berry may seem strange on such an offensive Pokemon, it can save Tera Electric Chien-Pao from being OHKOed by Adamant Choice Scarf Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. 36 HP and 36 Defense EVs can be used to guarantee this, but even without investment, Chien-Pao has around a 93% chance of surviving.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Chien-Pao offers power in spades without needing to Terastallize, but it ultimately comes down to how much Chien-Pao relies on Tera Blast for coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric can be used in tandem with Tera Blast to improve Chien-Pao's matchup against key threats such as Urshifu-R, Kyogre, and Primarina, while also making it immune to paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Stellar's one-time boost per attacking type can open up new sweeping opportunities for Chien-Pao. Maintaining its Dark typing is also strong in consideration of the Calyrex-S matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch to extreme power levels while making Crunch difficult to switch into without a resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire provides Chien-Pao with a host of new resistances against Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Ogerpon-H's Ivy Cudgel, and Scizor's Bullet Punch. These surprise resistances work particularly well with finding a turn to use Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost doesn't offer much offensive benefit, but it allows Chien-Pao to dodge Normal-type priority from Dragonite and the Ogerpon formes, which can be particularly useful if using Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice can allow Chien-Pao to finish foes off with Ice Shard from higher ranges and makes Icicle Crash an even more formidable tool. If combined with Life Orb, even offensive Urshifu-R can be 2HKOed!</p> </li> </ul>"

Sucker Punch is one of the most powerful priority moves in the metagame, but falters against support moves like Substitute and Thunder Wave. Thanks to Choice Band Chien-Pao's insane power, it is entirely possible to sacrifice coverage and run both if desired.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Sword versus Brick Break</strong>: Sacred Sword gives Chien-Pao useful coverage against bulky foes like Archaludon, as well as opposing Chien-Pao. Brick Break is less powerful but the utility of breaking dual screens can be worth it for some teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Chien-Pao can still opt for extra coverage to pressure would-be checks. However, this can require prediction because of the move lock, and often Chien-Pao will do more than enough damage hammering targets with Tera-boosted STAB attacks.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Chien-Pao is already plenty powerful, Choice Band combined with Tera can make some of the strongest walls in the game fold before Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark turns Choice Band Crunch into a devastating wallbreaker move that few can withstand, OHKOing checks like Scizor if using an Adamant nature. Neutralizing Chien-Pao's Steel-type weakness also makes it less vulnerable to Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice gives Choice Band Icicle Crash enough power to challenge even physically defensive Ting-Lu, having approximately a 69% chance to OHKO if using an Adamant nature; be warned, however, that Ting-Lu often Terastallizes in front of Chien-Pao, making this inconsistent. The extra power behind Ice Shard is also a welcome boost.</p> </li> </ul>"

Note that while using Taunt against Toxapex can be useful, it is highly likely to run Mental Herb, which risks getting Ting-Lu poisoned.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect with Leftovers is a strong choice when running Ting-Lu with high sustain teammates such as Toxapex, and can keep Ting-Lu's health up when its in risky situations like trapped by Dragonite's Fire Spin.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: Heavy Slam deals serious damage to Fairy-types, with Flutter Mane in particular needing a huge amount of defensive investment to avoid being OHKOed by it.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fissure</strong>: Fissure lets Ting-Lu potentially punish passive Pokemon without Substitute, such as Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Getting Stealth Rock and Spikes together makes Whirlwind a very effective damage dealing tool, in addition to supporting other offensive Pokemon. However, it can be difficult to set up without compromising Ting-Lu's damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Even with Ting-Lu's fantastic bulk, Terastallization greatly increases the amount of Pokemon it can beat one-on-one, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison gives Ting-Lu an important resistance to Fairy and Fighting, and it lets it absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: In addition to a useful Fighting resistance, Tera Fairy helps Ting-Lu against powerful Dragon-types like Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Band Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Ting-Lu has a significantly better matchup against Urshifu-R. The Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu matchups can also benefit, but be mindful of potential Tera Blast coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel retaining a Fighting weakness is unfortunate, but in exchange, Heavy Slam will OHKO even most bulky Flutter Mane, and it gives Ting-Lu a good matchup against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Ting-Lu's lack of reliable recovery usually makes Sitrus Berry the most reliable method of surviving an extra attack. Leftovers is a good alternative if Sitrus Berry is needed somewhere else, and even preferable if running Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Mental Herb can be used to nullify one use of Taunt or Encore, which Ting-Lu is fairly vulnerable to, at the cost of reducing its lifespan with a lack of any recovery.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spread Information</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Physical Defense versus Special Defense</strong>: Specializing in one defensive stat depends on which threats Ting-Lu needs to handle, with physically defensive variants preforming better against threats like Dragonite and Roaring Moon, and when Terastallized, Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-H, and Urshifu-R. For specially defensive variants, major targets include Gholdengo and Latios, and when Terastallized, Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>HP Stat Adjustments with Sitrus Berry</strong>: When using a Sitrus Berry, running an even HP number is the best option, so Ting-Lu will eat its berry right after being hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 SpD with Impish</strong>: When Terastallized to a neutral typing and holding a Sitrus Berry, Ting-Lu survives up to four Icicle Crashes from Jolly Focus Sash Chien-Pao. It also avoids a 2HKO from Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast even without Terastallizing thanks to Sitrus Berry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 116 Def / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: This Specially Defensive spread withstands even Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Overheat!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Speed Benchmarks With Taunt</h5> <ul> <li> <p>Investing in Speed may seem absurd, but with paralysis support, Ting-Lu can realistically outspeed some major threats!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>60 Speed EVs</strong>: This outspeeds up to paralyzed Jolly Dragonite, which can save Ting-Lu from Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>76 Speed EVs</strong>: This outspeeds up to paralyzed Adamant Urshifu-R, and many variants of Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>92 Speed EVs</strong>: This outspeeds up to paralyzed Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

With Tera Fire, the heat gets so extreme that even Blissey is 2HKOed by Overheat!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Bulkier EV Spread</h5> <ul> <li><strong>228 HP / 12 Def / 124 SpA / 4 SpD / 140 Spe with Modest</strong>: This is a bulky spread meant for Choice Scarf, outspeeding up to Iron Bundle. The bulk investment survives Breloom's Mach Punch, Mimikyu's Play Rough followed by Shadow Sneak, and has a good shot of surviving Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed. 40 EVs can be moved from Special Attack to Speed to outspeed Dragapult at a serious cost to power.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Chi-Yu's damage output is red hot even without Terastallization, making it a fairly flexible Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire Overheat is extremely difficult to wall without a resistance, making it an easy choice for Chi-Yu. It also lets Tera Blast become a powerful STAB move while Chi-Yu is locked into using it, letting it get around the normal limitations of using a Choice item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a good response to Urshifu-R and Primarina, and lets Chi-Yu avoid being OHKOed by Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is Chi-Yu's best shot of defeating Roaring Moon and and gives it an important Fighting-type resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost lets Chi-Yu surprise common users of Normal-type priority such as Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Entei, with the bonus of blocking Breloom from an easy revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: While Tera Dark is nowhere near as impressive as a boosted Overheat, Dark Pulse has excellent coverage and also removes Chi-Yu's troublesome Stealth Rock weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Getting a Water-type resistance is always useful against Urshifu-R, but the real key for Tera Water is that it helps Chi-Yu in the mirror match-up, especially against Assault Vest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

Note that Overheat will out-damage targets like Annihilape though.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: If not using Assault Vest, Will-O-Wisp severely punishes bulky physical threats like Roaring Moon and Dragonite that may switch in and works great with Terastallization to surprise other bulky threats such Ting-Lu.</li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Chi-Yu has shockingly decent Special Defense, so Assault Vest lets it preform much better against Flutter Mane and opposing Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb lets you get away with playing this set far more offensively at the cost of being even weaker to priority attacks than usual.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: If using a more offensive spread, Focus Sash can be worth it to flip the tables on fast offensive foes such as Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Eject Pack</strong>: This turns Overheat into a one-use pivot move, surprising foes with a momentum shift in your favor.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 12 Def / 124 SpA / 4 SpD / 140 Spe with Modest</strong>: This bulky spread is perfect for Assault Vest and Flame Charge, letting Chi-Yu outspeed Iron Bundle after a boost and avoid an OHKO from Breloom's Mach Punch. It also avoids a KO from Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak following Play Rough and often survives Tera Normal Dragonite's Choice Band Extreme Speed. If outspeeding the rare Dragapult after Flame Charge is a priority, 40 Special Attack EVs can be moved to Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Modest or Timid</strong>: When using more offensive items like Life Orb or Focus Sash, going a more offensive route makes Chi-Yu a better late-game sweeper.

It also eases the matchup against Urshifu-R.</p> </li> </ul>"

If Terastallized, Chi-Yu has a good chance of retaining its Substitute against Salt Cure as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Timid versus Modest</strong>: While this Chi-Yu is more focused on extreme wall-frying than sweeping, Timid is nice for outspeeding Urshifu formes and Annihilape, whom certainly can't handle boosted attacks well.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash makes setting up Nasty Plot much easier, at the cost of power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: While it makes Chi-Yu even more vulnerable to priority moves, Life Orb is otherwise an excellent wallbreaking item, notably giving Chi-Yu a better matchup against stall teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li><strong>24 HP / 12 Def / 220 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid or Modest</strong>: If using Substitute, this spread prevents Garganacl with 4 Attack EVs from breaking a Terastallized Chi-Yu's Substitute with Salt Cure.

In particular, Choice Specs Chi-Yu can now 2HKO Blissey with Flamethrower!</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Speed EV Benchmarks</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Jolly Nature with maximum Speed</strong>: Investing in more power with Adamant may seem tempting, but Koraidon's contentious Speed tier ties with Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Miraidon even after a Speed boost, as well as Chien-Pao with no boosts, Speed ties can easily decide which Pokemon gets KOed. Dropping Speed usually only makes sense on bulkier sets instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>20 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>68 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Urshifu formes and Jolly Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Timid Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>60+ Spe or 188 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Ogerpon formes, Timid Iron Moth, and Timid Alolan Ninetales.

Low Kick may seem appealing, but its dependence on the foe’s weight means it is particularly weak when used against targets like Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flare Blitz</strong>: Thanks to the sun set by Orichalcum Pulse, Flare Blitz is arguably Koraidon’s most spammable attack, easily cutting through the Steel- and Fairy-types that would try to switch into its Dragon-type STAB moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Outrage</strong>: While it is a risky move to lock into, Outrage’s sheer power makes it Koraidon’s preferred Dragon-type STAB attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn and Teammates</strong>: Thanks to the sun it sets with Orichalcum Pulse, Koraidon facilitates sun teams beautifully. Teammates like Flutter Mane and Ogerpon-H benefit greatly from Koraidon’s sun and can easily be brought in via U-turn.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: While giving up one of Koraidon’s other moves can be a big sacrifice, Flame Charge gives Choice Band sets an option to clean up weakened teams thanks to its Speed boost making Koraidon significantly harder to revenge kill. However, it is very reliant on the power boost gained from Tera Fire to be consistent at all.</li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Thanks to its high natural power and great Speed tier, Koraidon is an excellent Choice Scarf user, easily capable of stopping attempted sweeps from foes like boosted Kyurem-B, Zacian-C, and Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band elevates Koraidon’s power to nearly unfathomable levels, allowing it to perform feats such as OHKOing Fire-resistant foes like Urshifu-R with Tera-boosted Flare Blitz in sun.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Koraidon makes excellent use of Terastallization, it is far from necessary for it to succeed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire grants Koraidon a crucial Fairy resistance and STAB on Flare Blitz, allowing it to more easily clean up late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting boosts Collision Course’s power even further, making it easier to spam while also ridding Koraidon of most of the weaknesses that come from its Dragon typing.</p> </li> </ul>"

Only physically defensive Unaware Pokemon like Dondozo and Skeledirge, Tera Fairy Pokemon with Flash Fire like Ceruledge and Heatran, and the rare Dachsbun have any hope of walling it!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Collision Course versus Drain Punch</strong>: Collision Course's lack of drawbacks makes it an easy choice over Close Combat, especially since Koraidon is rather bulky even without investment; after Swords Dance, it still deals over 50% to Hippowdon even without Orichalcum Pulse kicking in. Drain Punch trades a lot of that power against Hippowdon in particular in exchange for healing, which suits Koraidon's reasonable bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flare Blitz versus Flame Charge</strong>: Flare Blitz offers brutal power beyond imagination, usually making it the prime choice. However, boosted Flame Charge with Tera Fire still does good damage and can be paired with Outrage to muscle through certain targets such as Ho-Oh and Toxapex more easily</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scale Shot with Loaded Dice versus Flame Charge</strong>: Koraidon will want a way to boost its Speed to keep revenge killers like Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Landorus-T at bay. Scale Shot works well as both a multi-hit move to shred common Focus Sash users like Chien-Pao and Calyrex-S after a boost. Flame Charge trades ripping through Focus Sash and power for reliability, hitting Fairy-types, and making Koraidon less vulnerable to priority from foes like Choice Band Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Outrage</strong>: Outrage offers vicious power on the level of Flare Blitz, making it a decent alternative when using Flame Charge to deal heavier damage to defensive foes like Dondozo and Ho-Oh. However, it leaves Koraidon very vulnerable to being revenge killed by Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane, Zacian-C, and Tera Fairy Calyrex-S.</li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: If using Scale Shot, Loaded Dice is a must for more consistently pummeling foes after a boost. The minimum of 4 hits from Scale Shot notably gives Koraidon a high chance of OHKOing Focus Sash Chien-Pao without a boost, a rare feat for a multi-hit attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry is a fantastic option against Yawn users like Hippowdon and Ursaluna-B, and it also stops Flutter Mane from sneaking a Thunder Wave in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Clear Amulet</strong>: Clear Amulet ensures that debuff tactics such as Intimidate and Rock Tomb will bounce off Koraidon like pebbles, as well as stopping Charm from Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb boosts Koraidon's power to extinction levels, with Tera Fire Flare Blitz even having around a 50% shot of OHKOing Toxapex after Swords Dance!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is a great way to keep common revenge killers like Flutter Mane and Ice Shard Chien-Pao from stopping Koraidon cold.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire offers the best combination of offense and defense, turning its devastating Fairy weakness into a resistance and letting Flare Blitz blast foes back to the stone age. Even bulky Fire-resistant foes like Toxapex are actually 2HKOed by a boosted Flare Blitz in sun!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a niche alternative to Fire, providing no offensive benefit but flipping Koraidon's Dragon, Fairy, and Psychic weaknesses on their head, as well as protecting it from Toxic Spikes and Toxic users like Gliscor and Toxapex. Just note that the Fire weakness is especially problematic due to Koraidon setting up sun.</p> </li> </ul>"

Flare Blitz’s higher power makes it much easier to break through bulky checks, though the recoil can impact Koraidon's longevity. If Koraidon is using Tera Fire, it is not uncommon to run both simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: U-turn is a great way to bring in sun teammates like Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu against Koraidon's checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: When utilized with Tera Electric, Tera Blast can pressure some of Koraidon's most troublesome defensive checks in Dondozo and Primarina.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Claw versus Outrage</strong>: Dragon Claw gives Koraidon a flexible Dragon-type STAB with decent power. Outrage's raw damage is better for breaking through defenses, but the move lock can put Koraidon in danger of getting set up on or revenge killed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The Special Defense investment allows Koraidon to withstand two unboosted Astral Barrages from Timid Calyrex-S. The Speed investment lets it outspeed targets up to a base Speed of 100, most notably Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Scale Shot</strong>: Scale Shot can be used as an alternative to Flame Charge as a Speed-boosting move, allowing Koraidon to have a Dragon-type move without sacrificing coverage elsewhere. The Defense drops can be concerning for Koraidon's longevity, however.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Terastallization is an integral part of this set's strategy, as even with Assault Vest Koraidon has to shed its Dragon- and Fairy-type weaknesses to withstand threats like Miraidon and Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives more reliable attack power to Flame Charge and amps the already dangerous strength of Flare Blitz to incredible levels. It also flips Koraidon's troublesome x4 Fairy-type weakness to a resistance and makes burns a non-issue, potentially tripping up targets like Will-O-Wisp Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric grants a well-rounded defensive typing that is particularly favorable for the Miraidon matchup, and the paralysis immunity gives extra security against Flutter Mane's Thunder Wave sets. Tera Electric also widens offensive coverage when paired with Tera Blast.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also hits the rare Iron Treads, which resists all of Miraidon's other coverage moves except Tera Blast Ice or Water.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Koraidon and Flutter Mane boost their Speed often enough where Choice Scarf gives Miraidon a fighting chance of moving first anyway and it makes Miraidon a powerful revenge killer in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs wires up Miraidon into a powerful wallbreaker, with only Blissey, Chansey, and Ground-types being able to effectively handle repeated Electro Drifts. With Tera Electric, not even Blissey can withstand Electro Drift!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Magnet, Life Orb, and Assault Vest</strong>: While the following items grant less offensive benefit to Miraidon, not being choice locked against common Ground-type switch-ins can be very worth it. Magnet gives a modest boost to Miraidon's best move in Electro Drift, while Life Orb grants extra power across the board at the cost of compromising Miraidon's bulk. Assault Vest is another option that, even without any bulk investment, still allows Miraidon to avoid the 2HKO from Timid Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Miraidon is perfectly capable of ripping through teams on its own, but Terastallization can either stop certain revenge kill attempts or open up new foes to zap.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Despite being a poor defensive typing, Tera Ice stops Chien-Pao from defeating Miraidon with Icicle Crash while giving it a new coverage attack against Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Rillaboom in Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Not only is Tera Fairy great for soaking up Dragon-type attacks, it also provides handy coverage against Ting-Lu with a boosted Dazzling Gleam.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a far better defensive alternative to Tera Ice for drowning Ground-types with Tera Blast, most notably Iron Treads. Tera Water is also less exploitable by Chien-Pao and Scizor, but it does come at the cost of making Miraidon mirror matchups shaky as well as the occasional Rillaboom becoming a huge problem.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Removing the weaknesses of Miraidon's part-Dragon typing makes Tera Electric already good, and jolting up Electro Drift's power means even Blissey and Electric-resistant Pokemon like bulky Ogerpon-H and specially defensive Wo-Chien take serious damage, especially if Miraidon is holding Choice Specs! Tera Electric also allows Choice Scarf sets to OHKO most Flutter Mane with Electro Drift.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternative EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p>Miraidon's natural bulk is impressive, so investing even a little into bulk can make a big difference. These EV spreads can help you get started, but these are just a few examples of what offensive Miraidon can run!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>124 HP / 4 Def / 196 SpA / 12 SpD / 172 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread is specialized for Choice Scarf with enough physical bulk to almost always survive +2 Adamant Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. The special bulk also allows Miraidon to survive +1 Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. Finally, the Speed investment combined with Choice Scarf allows Miraidon to outrun Adamant Dragonite at +2 Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 52 Def / 68 SpA / 4 SpD / 140 Spe with Timid</strong>: This speedy Choice Specs spread outruns Adamant Koraidon and Chien-Pao as well as Modest Miraidon and Flutter Mane. In the case of Jolly Chien-Pao, Miraidon almost always survives Icicle Crash as well as Jolly Landorus-T's Earthquake. Enough Special Attack is maintained that Choice Specs Draco Meteor has a very strong chance to OHKO Terastallized Koraidon that is neutral against Dragon-type damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: Knocking out threats before they can hit Miraidon is sometimes the best defense! Because Miraidon is in a highly contested Speed tier, a Timid nature is the preferred option in case of Speed ties.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Focusing on bulk with Assault Vest rather than Speed and raw power may seem counter to Miraidon's purpose, but this set showcases its impressive skills as a tank!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Volt Switch versus U-turn</strong>: Miraidon's bulk makes it a great pivot with Volt Switch, especially once Ground-types are dealt with. Just note that it does come at the cost of healing or coverage. If wanting to guarantee Miraidon can pivot against common Ground-type switch-ins, U-turn is also a viable option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: If Miraidon is using Tera Fairy, Dazzling Gleam is a reasonable way to wear down Ting-Lu switching in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: With such high special bulk from Assault Vest, Miraidon can land surprise KOs on strong special attackers like Flutter Mane and opposing Miraidon.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Parabolic Charge</strong>: Electric Terrain juices Parabolic Charge up into one of the most powerful healing attacks around. Even foes like Calyrex-S are still usually 2HKOed by Parabolic Charge! Unfortunately, it usually involves sacrificing something else critically important like a pivot move or Tera Blast coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat</strong>: This Miraidon variant is particularly vulnerable to the power reduction from Rillaboom's Grassy Surge and the troublesome Iron Treads, giving Overheat a niche to hit them hard without using Terastallization.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Assault Vest Miraidon has enough bulk that even some Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks are unlikely to KO it, but Terastallization still helps it keep in good shape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice provides both a vital resistance to Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and powerful coverage against Ground- and Dragon-types alike in Tera Blast, but note that its poor defensive qualities are a bigger sticking point for a tank.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water greatly helps against potential Chien-Pao revenge kills as well as making Tera Blast into a powerful tool against Ground-types. Just be warned that this Tera type gives Rillaboom, the Ogerpon formes, and opposing Miraidon a much easier time revenge killing this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy makes powerful Dragon-type attacks bounce off Miraidon, which is perfect for revenge killing Outrage-locked threats like Koraidon, and it increases Dazzling Gleam's power for wearing down Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal can cause serious problems for Calyrex-S, forcing it to break Miraidon without its strongest attack in Astral Barrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: While this set isn't focused on wallbreaking, Tera Electric boosts Electro Drift such that it still electrocutes most Pokemon anyways, and it comes with the bonus of removing all weaknesses associated with Miraidon's part-Dragon typing.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 116 SpA / 68 SpD / 68 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread is designed to survive Draco Meteor from opposing Timid Miraidon and from opposing Modest Miraidon 63.5% of the time, assuming no boosts from items. The Speed investment allows Miraidon to outspeed Jolly Urshifu formes and Mimikyu, both of which can threaten serious damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 196 SpA / 36 SpD / 20 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread lets Miraidon outspeed Jolly Landorus-T, giving it an extra bit of power while still surviving unboosted Draco Meteor from Timid Miraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 196 SpA / 4 SpD / 52 Spe with Modest</strong>: While Miraidon is no longer guaranteed to live Draco Meteor from opposing Timid Miraidon, the small boost in Speed stays ahead of Jolly Gliscor. Alternatively, the Special Defense investment can be increased to 20 EVs by taking from Special Attack, so that opposing Timid Miraidon will only be able to OHKO on the highest Draco Meteor roll.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With several options to boost its stats, Miraidon can become an unstoppable force if given the opportunity!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electro Drift</strong>: Electro Drift's consistent power works well for both Agility and Calm Mind sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Parabolic Charge and Calm Mind</strong>: Calm Mind is a great boosting option for Miraidon, but those with slower spreads in particular will often take sizable damage while trying to set up. Parabolic Charge's healing works well for offsetting this, and the Calm Mind boosts help make up for its lower Base Power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Pulse versus Draco Meteor</strong>: Dragon Pulse may be weaker, but it doesn't compromise Miraidon's offense in the long term. Draco Meteor's high burst damage can be worth it in lieu of the Special Attack drop, since this Miraidon often tries to sweep late-game, but it can otherwise be problematic if Miraidon has to face multiple targets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Agility</strong>: With the appropriate Speed investment, Agility will let Miraidon outrun the most common Choice Scarf users in the metagame!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Due to the one-time nature of Electric Seed, Terastallization is almost mandatory so that Miraidon can overcome its checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is Miraidon's best hope of taking out the troublesome Iron Treads. Its also a strong defensive typing, though notably, it does make the Miraidon mirror matchup much trickier if the opponent still has their own Terastallization available.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Blast Ice provides the best offensive coverage with Electric-type STAB moves if Miraidon is trying to fit both Calm Mind and Agility into the same set. While Tera Ice is not as strong defensively, the Ice-type resistance is still good against Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p>With the Defense boost from Electric Seed, all of the spreads shown below let Miraidon survive the 2HKO from Tera Normal Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>156 HP / 252 SpA / 100 Spe with Modest</strong>: The given Speed investment lets Miraidon outrun up to Timid Chi-Yu; after an Agility, Miraidon outruns all the way up to Choice Scarf Calyrex-S! After maximizing offensive power, the rest is put into HP.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 SpA / 20 Spe with Modest</strong>: It's recommended that this bulkier spread is used with Calm Mind and Parabolic Charge. Just enough Speed is maintained to outrun Jolly Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>132 HP / 252 SpA / 124 Spe with Timid</strong>: This spread is meant as a faster variation for Calm Mind setups, as the Speed investment will outrun other base 135 Speed Pokemon that have neutral Speed natures, such as Koraidon and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul>"

Iron Head has excellent synergy with Thunder Wave thanks its flinch rate and easily 2HKOes most Flutter Mane. Flash Cannon sets risk getting set up on by Calm Mind Flutter Mane but deal more damage to Tera Fairy Pokemon like Gouging Fire and opposing Archaludon.

This can easily be done with 244 HP EVs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 Def / 100 SpD Impish or Bold</strong>: This Sitrus Berry-optimized spread avoids a 2HKO from Timid Flutter Mane's unboosted Moonblast and also survives two hits of Earthquake from Jolly Landorus-T thanks to Stamina.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 252 Def / 12 SpD Impish or Bold</strong>: Maximizing Defense means it takes Adamant Choice Band Landorus-T to have a good shot of OHKOing Archaludon, with other Landorus-T variants usually failing to OHKO it, at the cost of a worse Flutter Mane matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 12 Def / 252 SpD Careful or Calm</strong>: This specially defensive spread almost always survives Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock damage and has around an 88% chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Modest Choice Specs Gholdengo's Shadow Ball with Sitrus Berry recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe Careful or Calm</strong>: The extra bit of special bulk ensures Archaludon will survive Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock, even on the highest roll! Just note that Ruination will no longer immediately activate Sitrus Berry.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry has excellent synergy with Stamina, letting Archaludon take on foes it normally wouldn't dream of, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp with the correct EV spread!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's gradual recovery rewards Archaludon that manage to get multiple Stamina boosts, making it even more difficult to take down than usual! This can usually be done by switching into a weak priority attack like Primarina's Aqua Jet</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is an effective tool against physical attackers, being especially helpful on Tera Flying Archaludon to force Tera Normal Dragonite to use Extreme Speed.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Archaludon's fantastic typing can make Terastallization a net negative, so make sure to Terastallize only if it's needed for the matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy solidifies Archaludon against Urshifu-S and Chien-Pao, making the Defense boost-ignoring moves Wicked Blow and Sacred Sword far less of a problem, and saves it from powerful Draco Meteors from foes like Latios.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying fixes up its weakness to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, which can save Archaludon from Ursaluna-B for a turn. Just note that losing its Blood Moon resistance could be detrimental in the long run without a boosted Body Press.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is Archaludon's best option against Urshifu-R, removing its Fighting weakness while allowing it not to worry about Surging Strikes ignoring Defense stages.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>This Archaludon takes advantage of Sturdy to get around Item Clause for Focus Sash, making it a surprising offensive support Pokemon or revenge killer depending on the matchup!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Thunder Wave is especially brutal with Custap Berry, letting Archaludon fire off one last priority Thunder Wave to support an incoming teammate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electro Shot and Power Herb</strong>: Electro Shot's Special Attack boost when combined with Power Herb's recharge removal makes Archaludon far more difficult to wall, with offensive Gholdengo in particular being in KO range of Flash Cannon afterwards!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam VS. Mirror Coat</strong>: Heavy Slam OHKOes all but the bulkiest of Flutter Mane, giving Archaludon even more early-game power. Mirror Coat is the riskier option, since Archaludon must get hit, but it can lead to a shocking demise for many a special attacker!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest VS. Timid</strong>: Modest is preferred to get as much power out of Archaludon as possible, but Timid happens to outspeed Gholdengo and Adamant Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Steel Beam</strong>: Steel Beam is an insanely powerful kaboom to go out with, but Archaludon's reasonable bulk even when uninvested makes it a rather constraining move to slot in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark Pulse</strong>: Dark Pulse is Archaludon's strongest attack against Gholdengo but does little else, especially if using Power Herb and Electro Shot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb</strong>: This Archaludon is fast enough to fully take advantage of the speed control Rock Tomb provides. While not as devastating as paralysis, it is less vulnerable to Lum Berry, Taunt, and Encore, in addition to breaking Iron Bundle's Substitute. Just make sure to use a Timid nature so Iron Bundle will be outsped after the Speed drop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Tail or Roar</strong>: Phazing with such an offensive set may seem odd, but it makes Archaludon less passive after using Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Metal Burst</strong>: Metal Burst is a seemingly less risky alternative to Mirror Coat, but its lack of negative priority doesn't bode well against slower special attackers like Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Naive with 0 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense</strong>: Going this route is the most likely way to get Custap Berry to activate on Archaludon, but the bulk loss makes it less flexible overall.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Custap Berry</strong>: Custap Berry gives Archaludon a pseudo-priority move in the situation it gets hit hard, giving it a chance to completely ruin gameplans or even revenge kill later in the game!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jaboca Berry</strong>: This Berry guarantees that the first physical attack to hit Archaludon will deal damage to its foe, potentially ruining common Focus Sash leads such as Chien-Pao and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Archaludon's great physical bulk means even if Sturdy is activated, it's capable of surviving resisted priority attacks from foes like Adamant Urshifu-R, Dragonite, and Entei while at 26% of its health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Red Card</strong>: Red Card makes early-game setup foes like Dragonite much less of a worry when Sturdy is intact.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency: Very Low</strong>: Since this Archaludon is usually used in the early parts of the game to support the rest of the team, Terastallization isn't usually a good idea unless a matchup absolutely requires it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Ground immunity can come in handy against Landorus-T, a common early-game Stealth Rock setter that can give Archaludon some issues.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a big surprise to powerful Dragon-type wallbreakers like Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Specs Latios.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: In the rare situation Terastallization is needed, Tera Stellar's one-time power boost for each attack could be situationally useful for cleaning up late-game.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a Choice Specs in tow, Archaludon becomes a surprising and powerful wallbreaker that can ruin the days of its usual defensive checks like Ting-Lu!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt is not only good coverage against Steel-types like Corviknight, but it also 2HKOes Assault Vest Primarina, an otherwise troublsome foe for other offensive Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark Pulse</strong>: Dark Pulse 2HKOes bulky Gholdengo, and it even has a shot at OHKOing offensive Gholdengo. It also deals decent damage to uncommon Steel-types that are immune to Thunderbolt like in Excadrill and Iron Treads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel Beam</strong>: Steel Beam is absurdly powerful, with even bulky Steel-resistant Pokemon like Scizor needing Assault Vest to avoid a 2HKO! This does come at the cost of ruining Sturdy by losing half of Archaludon's health, though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aura Sphere</strong>: While risky to be locked into because of Ghost-types, Aura Sphere deals plenty of damage to Chi-Yu and opposing Archaludon without committing to a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Pulse</strong>: Dragon Pulse is a less risky back-up to Draco Meteor, making the revenge killing of Dragon-types like Dragonite less risky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: While Stamina is potentially workable with Archaludon's good bulk, Sturdy is highly recommended for ensuing very few Pokemon can OHKO it without Stealth Rock support, making it far more difficult to check offensively!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Timid</strong>: Modest's extra power is preferred if using Dark Pulse for a potential OHKO on offensive Gholdengo, but Timid is a reasonable consideration for outspeeding Adamant Urshifu formes, Timid Gholdengo, and Jolly Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Archaludon focuses so much on offense that Terastallization is best for either dealing more damage or giving it useful immunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar's one-time boost per type makes Archaludon a fearsomely flexible wallbreaker, with even support Landorus-T sets being OHKOed by Draco Meteor and Steel Beam!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Floating with Tera Flying is a strong way to punish attempts to revenge kill Archaludon with Ground-type attacks, with Landorus-T and and Ursaluna-B in particular being ripe targets. The Fighting resistance also comes in handy if Sturdy is broken by a weak attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy ruins strong special attacking Dragon-types like Choice Specs Latios, and it makes Archaludon a solid Urshifu-S check even when Sturdy isn't in play.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Tera Dragon's defensive benefits aren't strong beyond resisting Ogerpon-H's STAB attacks, but a consistently powerful Draco Meteor makes it a good offensive choice.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel's Fairy resistance can save Archaludon from revenge kills if a weak attack has broken Sturdy, but its main use is for firing off an extremely powerful Steel Beam twice.</p> </li> </ul>"

Flare Blitz</strong>: Heat Crash hits plenty of targets for high power thanks to Gouging Fire's high weight without compromising its bulk like Flare Blitz. However, beware that some heavy targets that sometimes use Tera Fairy like Ting-Lu, Ursaluna-B, and opposing Gouging Fire will take very little from Heat Crash compared to Flare Blitz.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scale Shot and Loaded Dice</strong>: Scale Shot with Loaded Dice not only gives Gouging Fire an alternate way to boost its Speed but also provides it with a way to bust through Focus Sash Pokemon after a boost, such as Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Outrage VS. Dragon Claw</strong>: Outrage is preferred for maximum late-game sweeping potential, but Dragon Claw is a safer option if you don't always bring good Fairy-type checks like Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake is a good response to bulky Fire-types like Incineroar and the rare Heatran, and it is the strongest attack against Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute lets Gouging Fire block Yawn from troublesome foes like Swampert and Torkoal and not worry about Thunder Wave from slow, bulky foes like Gholdengo and Porygon2.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: If not using Scale Shot, Booster Energy's power or Speed boost is the most useful for late-game sweeping without compromising Gouging Fire's good bulk like Life Orb would.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Gouging Fire's typing is fine defensively, but the high profile weaknesses to Ground and Dragon mean Terastallizing gives it far more versatile setup opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy turns the tables on fearsome Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Latios and Dragonite and is a good defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives Gouging Fire plenty of extra power and a useful Fairy resistance against Flutter Mane, even if the irritating Earthquake weakness remains.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a godsend against Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and gives a setup opportunity against Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Although it's awkward against several targets like Tera Flying Landorus-T and opposing Gouging Fire, Tera Grass's Earthquake resistance and Spore immunity give it a niche.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li><strong>84 HP / 164 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: With this spread, Gouging Fire gets a Speed boost with Protosynthesis, letting it become a competent revenge killer with Booster Energy or have an extra use on sun teams.

Heat Crash fulfills a similar purpose, though heavy threats like Ting-Lu and Ursaluna-B will take very little from it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Claw VS. Breaking Swipe</strong>: Dragon Claw is the most powerful option for a no-drawback Dragon-type STAB move, but Breaking Swipe's Attack drop can open up some support opportunities for Gouging Fire's teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake hits Incineroar and bulky Tera Fire users like Scizor hard, though it can be a risky move to choose with the large number of Ground-immune foes in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Torkoal</strong>: If using this set on a sun team, Torkoal is among the best options for setting up sun for Gouging Fire thanks to its access to Stealth Rock and Yawn, which can soften up foes for a sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Vs. Choice Band</strong>: Choice Scarf functions the best outside of sun teams and is able to outspeed major threats like Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle. Choice Band is harder to clean with outside of sun teams, and it can use a specialized EV spread to get a Speed boost in sun.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Double Kick</strong>: If using Choice Scarf, Double Kick can be used to OHKO Chien-Pao through its Focus Sash in a surprise revenge kill.

Dragon Claw</strong>: Dragon Claw is the more reliable late-game cleaning attack, but Breaking Swipe eases Gouging Fire's setup against physical threats.</p> </li> <li> <p>** Heat Crash VS. Flare Blitz**: Gouging Fire is heavy enough for Heat Crash to be just as powerful as Flare Blitz against several lightweight targets, such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo. However, common, heavy foes like Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu will only take 40 Base Power of damage from it, which can justify Flare Blitz's recoil for some teams. <a href=\"https://calc.pokemonshowdown.com/\">Checking our damage calculator can help decide if Heat Crash or Flare Blitz is better for your team!</a></p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Gouging Fire's typing isn't bad defensively, its common weaknesses to Ground- and Dragon-type attacks mean Terastallization will greatly increase its setup opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong> Tera Fairy is a fantastic defensive choice, fending off Dragon-type attacks that can break through Gouging Fire and making it a great option against Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water vastly eases the matchup against Urshifu-R, which can bypass Breaking Swipe with Surging Strikes otherwise. It also makes dealing with Chien-Pao easier.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Fire isn't an impressive defensive choice beyond the useful Fairy resistance and losing the Dragon weakness, but the power boost still makes it worth considering.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is awkward against opposing Fire-types and Tera Flying Landorus-T, but the Ground resistance and Spore immunity do give it a niche.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Minimum Speed EVs</strong>: Gouging Fire's EV spreads are fairly customizable, but usually it's best to have at least 212 Speed EVs with a neutral nature or 116 EVs with a Jolly nature. This ensures that Gouging Fire outspeeds Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao after one use of Dragon Dance. If the rare Dragapult is a special concern, 252 Speed EVs with a neutral nature or 148 Speed EVs with Jolly can be run to outspeed that after Dragon Dance.</li> </ul> <h5>Physically Defensive Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Atk / 44 Def / 4 SpD / 212 Spe Impish</strong>: This spread avoids a 2HKO from Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>108 HP / 188 Def / 212 Spe Impish</strong>: This spread is the second most physically defensive spread possible with the given Speed, sacrificing some special bulk to have about an 85% chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Jolly Choice Band Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash with Leftovers recovery. The HP investment is worth it over making Gouging Fire slightly more physically bulky for some extra cushioning against special attacking threats, such as surviving Choice Specs Gholdengo's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Specially Defensive Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p>All of these spreads avoid a 2HKO from Flutter Mane that lack Choice Specs, provided Stealth Rock is off the field.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 204 SpD / 116 Spe Jolly</strong> or <strong>188 HP / 108 SpD / 212 Spe Careful</strong>: These identical spreads usually allow Gouging Fire to survive Blood Moon followed by Vacuum Wave from Modest Ursaluna-B when taking Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery into account.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 52 Atk / 4 Def / 220 SpD / 116 Jolly</strong> or <strong>116 HP / 52 Atk / 4 Def / 124 SpD / 212 Spe Careful</strong>: These identical spreads sacrifice some overall bulk to get an Attack boost from Protosynthesis, which can be helpful against sun teams or when using Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 108 SpD / 148 Spe Jolly</strong>: This spread gives Gouging Fire a Speed boost with Protosynthesis, which is especially helpful for outspeeding Booster Energy Flutter Mane after a Dragon Dance.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is best for easing Gouging Fire's setup, especially when paired with Breaking Swipe.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy can be used with the specialized EV spreads above to boost a specific stat once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: When using physically defensive spreads or Breaking Swipe, Rocky Helmet is an effective passive damage dealer against threats like Dragonite and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Clear Amulet</strong>: Clear Amulet prevents Landorus-T and Incineroar from obstructing Gouging Fire with Intimidate cycling.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: While not as cripplingly weak to Stealth Rock as something like Volcarona, Heavy-Duty Boots lets Gouging Fire check threats more consistently overall.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak makes losing to Garganacl far less likely and prevents dreaded flinch scenarios from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

If using Modest, it'll still put most Flutter Mane into Thunderclap's KO range as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Quiet</strong>: Quiet is mainly used for OHKOing offensive Flutter Mane with Heavy Slam, but even with that move, Modest makes sense if your team requires Speed investment.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Raging Bolt's good typing means Terastallization does have some drawbacks, such as making Urshifu-R harder to switch-into, but it has enough common weaknesses to types like Ground and Fairy that mean Terastallization will often be optimal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a fantastic defensive typing, making Raging Bolt a spectacular check to most Urshifu-S and prancing around strong Dragon-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Retaining the common Ground weakness is unfortunate, but Tera Steel makes up for it by tanking Fairy-type attacks and shredding Flutter Mane with Heavy Slam.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: When used with Tera Blast, Tera Ice chills Landorus-T to the bone and deals tremendous damage to Ursaluna-B without firing off Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Raging Bolt a cool resistance to Ice-type attacks from the likes of Chien-Pao while still retaining the Surging Strikes resistance against Urshifu-R. Just watch out for Tera Electric Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric makes sense for making Thunderclap an even more effective revenge killing tool and ridding Raging Bolt of its Fairy and Dragon weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: This niche Tera type grants Raging Bolt a resistance to Ground without making it weak to Ice.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 156 Def / 204 SpA with Modest or Quiet</strong>: This survives both Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake and Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash on all but the highest roll of damage, and it also OHKOes offensive Flutter Mane with +2 Thunderbolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 20 Def / 180 SpA / 4 SpD / 156 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread outspeeds the rare but dangerous Timid Ursaluna-B while avoiding an OHKO from Timid Flutter Mane's unboosted Moonblast and +1 Ogerpon-H's Play Rough.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 236 SpA / 132 SpD with Modest or Quiet</strong>: These EVs are optimized for Assault Vest, letting Terastallized Raging Bolt to avoid a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet lets Raging Bolt punish Urshifu-R that lack Punching Glove for using Surging Strikes, since most Urshiu-R will switch out from Raging Bolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy gives Raging Bolt a useful increase in power, with Thunderbolt now OHKOing Primarina that lack Assault Vest. However, it doesn't work well with Volt Switch and will usually tell your opponent that you aren't carrying it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Weakness Policy</strong>: Raging Bolt is bulky enough to take full advantage of Weakness Policy, turning Thunderclap into a vicious cleaning tool!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Raging Bolt's excellent bulk and pivoting prowess make it a great user of Assault Vest.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry's quick burst of recovery is especially helpful when Terastallized into a type that doesn't resist Water against Urshifu-R. Just make sure to use an even HP number to eat the Berry after being hit by Ruination once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs transforms Raging Bolt into a fearsome wallbreaking pivot! However, it makes Thunderclap even riskier to use.</p> </li> </ul>"

Draco Meteor is harder to sweep teams with, but it severely damages Assault Vest Ursaluna-B enough that it's worth considering.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt versus Discharge</strong>: A reliable Electric-type attack ensures that the risky Thunderclap isn't Raging Bolt's only option against Water-types, with Thunderbolt offering a tad more power, while Discharge's 30% paralysis rate is helpful for slow teammates like Ursaluna-B and Basculegion.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Volt Switch with Draco Meteor</strong>: Volt Switch may seem completely contrary to sweeping with Calm Mind boosts, but it can be combined with Draco Meteor to transform Raging Bolt into a wallbreaking pivot rather than a bulky sweeper.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Raging Bolt's common weaknesses like Ground and Fairy, combined with its awesome bulk, makes it a good candidate for Terastallization to prevent revenge kills.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a brilliant defensive typing, ruining Dragon-type attacks and transforming Raging Bolt into a good Urshifu-S check in a pinch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is perfect for soaking up Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao while still resisting Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: In addition to removing the annoying Fairy and Dragon weaknesses, Tera Electric makes Thunderclap an even more fearsome priority attack!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice is awful defensively, but when paired with Tera Blast, Raging Bolt can freeze specially defensive Landorus-T's smug grin off with an OHKO!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong> Steel unfortunately retains that annoying Ground weakness, but the resistance to Dragon and Fairy is good enough to consider it against threats like Flutter Mane and offensive Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: This niche Tera type gives Raging Bolt a Ground resistance without an Ice weakness that would doom it against Chien-Pao like Tera Flying would.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers rewards Raging Bolt's longevity more than any item, making it the prime cut of items.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: With Rocky Helmet, Raging Bolt can consistently punish Choice Scarf Urshifu-R for using Surging Strikes, giving it the perfect chance to set up Calm Mind as Urshifu-R switches out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry can be used with specalized EV spreads to prevent some useful 2HKOs. Just make sure to use an even HP stat so it's eaten after Raging Bolt is hit by Ruination one time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy is a more immediately offensive approach to Raging Bolt, letting it deal good damage without needing to set up Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Figy, Aguav, Mago, Iapapa, or Wiki Berry</strong>: These berries restore more health than Sitrus Berry, though the 25% HP activation does make them riskier.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 180 Def / 44 SpA / 140 SpD / 4 Spe</strong>: This spread survives Annihilape's Final Gambit, Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake, and Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With an incredible ability to resist any attack at full HP and the completely unresisted Tera Starstorm after Terastallization, Terapagos is one of the most terrifying bulky sweepers in the game!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Polish</strong>: Rock Polish ensures that Terapagos outspeeds most of the metagame, with only extremely fast Speed-boosted Pokemon such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Calyrex-S, and Flutter Mane outspeeding it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect pairs excellently with Leftovers and Toxic Spikes support to whittle down foes and give Terapagos an even longer lifespan.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power versus Flamethrower</strong>: Using a coverage move over Protect doesn't make Terapagos as long-lasting, but it makes Terapagos less of a liability if a different Pokemon needs to Terastallize in a given match. Earth Power ruins Glimmora and does big damage to Miraidon and Zacian-C, while Flamethrower still hits Zacian-C and roasts the irritating Knock Off Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Besides benefitting Terapagos's impressive bulk, getting any chance to gain Tera Shell's effect back is devastating enough to seriously consider Leftovers.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rest and Chesto Berry</strong>: When Rest and Chesto Berry are combined, Terapagos has an easy way to gain Tera Shell's protection back! However, this combination won't work nearly as well with Toxic Spikes as Protect does and is very vulnerable to Knock Off.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark Pulse</strong>: Dark Pulse nails Calyrex-S regardless of whether or not Terapagos is Terastallized, though the great coverage isn't all that useful after Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rapid Spin and an Attack IV of 31</strong>: Terapagos is great at removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, especially since most foes won't expect it, plus Terapagos can still boost its Speed even if it's Taunted. As a bonus, Rapid Spin breaks Focus Sash on powerful users like Sneasler. However, Terapagos will now need 244 Speed EVs and a Timid nature to outspeed Calyrex-S after a Speed boost.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Almost Required</strong>: Terapagos is heavily dependent on Terastallization to transform into the incredibly bulky Terapagos-S. This is especially the case if Tera Starstorm is its only attack, meaning Terastallization is necessary to hit Ghost-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Terapagos-S</strong>: Tera Stellar is the only possible option for Terapagos, but thankfully Terapagos-S's incredible bulk and perfect coverage make Terastallizing worth it. However, Tera Shell is a fantastic ability for enabling setup, and Tera Starstorm actually does more damage to neutral targets when Terapagos is not Terastallized, so it shouldn't be in a rush to Terastallize either. Also, take special note of Teraform Zero; while its not the main selling point of Terapagos-S, clearing Koraidon's sun or Miraidon's Electric Terrain at the correct times can have a huge impact on the match!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>172 HP EVs</strong>: This HP investment gives Terapagos maximum Leftovers recovery before Terastallizing and minimizes Terapagos-S's damage from entry hazards. It also ensures that +1 Psyshock from Calyrex-S will not 2HKO Terapagos-S after Leftovers recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 Speed EVs versus 140 Speed EVs</strong>: 100 Speed EVs let Terapagos outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, a common revenge killer. 140 Speed EVs will require losing some power, but they do enable Terapagos to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Urshifu formes, which can potentially revenge kill Terapagos-S with Close Combat.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Terapagos's offensive power may seem underwhelming compared to most Restricted Pokemon, but Tera Starstorm hitting every Pokemon neutrally in its Stellar forme makes it a strong and easy-to-use Choice Specs threat!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark Pulse</strong>: Dark Pulse is Terapagos's best attack against Calyrex-S, making it especially important when Terapagos is not Terastallized.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Power Gem</strong>: Power Gem hits Ho-Oh and Tera Fire Koraidon without needing to Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam versus Ice Beam</strong>: Dazzling Gleam ruins Koraidon that don't Terastallize, while Ice Beam does more damage to other Dragon-types, with Dragonite being a big target.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power versus Flamethrower</strong>: Earth Power deals huge damage to Tera Fire Koraidon while keeping Tera Shell in play, and it's good coverage against Steel-types like Zacian-C. Flamethrower goes all in against Steel-types, roasting Scizor and Corviknight in particular.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Healing Wish / Lunar Dance Support</strong>: A Healing Wish or Lunar Dance teammate lets Terapagos go on another Tera Starstorm rampage, pairing well with its superb bulk. Some good users of these include Latias, Cresselia, and Indeedee formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Flash Cannon</strong>: Flash Cannon is Terapagos's most damaging attack against Flutter Mane, but its coverage is otherwise poor.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Very High</strong>: Terapagos needs to Terastallize into Terapagos-S in order to gain perfect coverage and bulk. However, if the flow of the match suggests a different Pokemon should Terastallize, Terapagos still has the useful Tera Shell and good coverage as backup, even if it's rather mediocre without Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>When to Terastallize</strong>: Before Terastallization, Tera Starstorm is actually more powerful, and the superb Tera Shell lets Terapagos revenge kill a wide variety of weakened Pokemon. Terastallizing before Terapagos has taken damage is often not advised, but it makes sense if predicting your opponent is difficult.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>196 HP / 252 SpA / 60 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread lets Terapagos outspeed the extremely powerful Jolly Ursaluna, which can OHKO it through Tera Shell with boosted Facade.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 68 Def / 204 SpA with Modest</strong>: This spread lets Terapagos survive Adamant Koraidon's Collision Course after it Terastallizes to get rid of the sunny weather.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: Maximizing Speed allows Terapagos to outspeed Adamant Urshifu formes, which otherwise revenge kill Terapagos-S.</p> </li> </ul>"
