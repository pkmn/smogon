      "Screens Setter": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With the new Defense-boosting mechanic for Ice-types in snow, Alolan Ninetales is the premier screens setter in the current metagame, as well as being a decent check against fearsome physical attackers like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore can thwart bulkier setup foes that would otherwise take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's mediocre offenses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Blizzard versus Freeze-Dry</strong>: Blizzard's high Base Power helps make up for Alolan Ninetales's lack of power. Freeze-Dry is much less powerful but is more consistent at pressuring Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Basculegion-M.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pain Split</strong>: Pain Split punishes foes that assume Alolan Ninetales will simply allow revenge kills from slower Pokemon, giving it a new lease on life to check physical threats. This especially works well with Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Misty Terrain</strong>: Misty Terrain stops common users of status such as Yawn Ursaluna-B and Thunder Wave Porygon2 from having an impact, though it does weaken grounded Dragon-type teammates like Raging Bolt and Roaring Moon.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Thanks to its high Speed and increased physical bulk in snow, Alolan Ninetales does not normally want to Terastallize. It's true it can help with Steel-types moves from Scizor and Choice Scarf Gholdengo, but it is often more advisable to play around this weakness through its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a balanced defensive typing that completely flips Alolan Ninetales's Steel-type weakness, all but guaranteeing it can set Aurora Veil. It also lets it resist Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes—a common counter against screens—though Alolan Ninetales will normally survive it without Terastallizing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire can be used offensively and defensively against Steel-types, with invested Tera Blast usually OHKOing Scizor and 2HKOing Gholdengo. Do note though that this comes at the cost of having a dramatically worse Urshifu-R matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice lets Alolan Ninetales keep its Defense boost in snow while increasing its offensive output and making the devastating Steel weakness more manageable.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Light Clay</strong>: Light Clay extends Aurora Veil's duration and makes it much harder for the opponent to play around it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: If using a physically defensive EV spread, Rocky Helmet lets Alolan Ninetales severely punish Urshifu-R that lack Punching Glove.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash is good insurance against fast super effective hits, but it's overall less useful in the majority of matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p>Alolan Ninetales has a wide variety of possible EV spreads. If the examples below don't suit your needs, consider checking out some useful Speed and Defensive benchmarks later in this analysis to help create a custom EV spread!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 92 SpD / 172 Spe with Timid</strong>: This spread lets Alolan Ninetales outspeed up to Timid Iron Crown and Jolly Urshifu formes while surviving Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera-boosted Moonblast on all but the highest damage roll.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 76 Def / 4 SpA / 116 SpD / 84 Spe with Timid</strong>: With this investment in bulk, Alolan Ninetales survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera Fairy Moonblast, as well as avoiding an OHKO from Ogerpon-H's super effective Ivy Cudgel while the weather is still snow. The Speed investment lets Alolan Ninetales outrun Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 140 SpD / 188 Spe with Timid</strong>: This spread sacrifices some physical bulk in exchange for outspeeding Timid Chi-Yu and almost always survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera-boosted Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 244 Def / 84 Spe with Timid</strong>: This physically bulky spread avoids a 2HKO from Adamant Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes while outspeeding up to Modest Chi-Yu. It also avoids an OHKO from Scizor's unboosted Bullet Punch on all but the highest damage roll.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>A unique combination of Intimidate, Extreme Speed and multiple support tools make Arcanine a versatile and unpredictable defensive option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extreme Speed</strong>: Even on a defensive set, Extreme Speed's strong base power and priority combined with Arcanine's naturally high Attack make it a potent cleaning tool.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roar</strong>: Roar lets Arcanine phaze out troublesome set-up foes that are hard for teammates to switch into, such as Wo-Chien and Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: Bulldoze's speed control can be used to set up your own offense for a countersweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: After Intimidate, the given EV spread lets Arcanine avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Chien-Pao's Crunch and Baxcalibur's Earthquake. The HP investment minimizes Stealth Rock damage when not running Heavy-Duty Boots, and the Speed investment outspeeds Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Snarl</strong>: This move lets Arcanine pester special attackers that switch into it, potentially letting it stay in longer or ease a switch to a teammate.</li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: As a defensive switch-in with a Stealth Rock weakness, Arcanine heavily favors Heavy-Duty Boots to remove said weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Against targets like Chien-Pao, Arcanine can rack up passive chip damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Passive recovery is a valuable asset to have on a defensive Pokemon, but since Arcanine is an Intimidate user that switches a lot, Leftovers doesn't always have enough turns to produce good value.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization can do a lot to further improve Arcanine's unique set of attributes, but it's not necessarily something that Arcanine needs to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal gives Arcanine even more cleaning power by boosting Extreme Speed. It's also a nice pinch option for blocking Ghost-type moves, as Flutter Mane and Mimikyu are often forced to use them due to Arcanine's Fairy resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy provides defensive insurance against some of the hardest hitting Choice Band users, such as Tera Dark Chien-Pao and Outrage Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Shell Smash and Skill Link more than make up for Cloyster's weak Attack stat, making it a formidable sweeper that Focus Sash and Mimikyu can't easily stop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Priority may seem like overkill, but it helps pick off weakened threats without setup. It also gets around priority attacks from Breloom, Dragapult, and Meowscarada after a Shell Smash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Blast</strong>: This is Closyer's best shot at dealing with the many Tera Fires that resist Icicle Spear, as well as OHKOing Chien-Pao, Iron Bundle, and Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drill Run</strong>: This hits Gholdengo and other Steel-types hard without needing to Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the preferred nature to maximize offensive power, as a single Shell Smash lets you outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. However, Cloyster is in the same speed tier as Breloom, so Jolly is a consideration if you want to minimize Speed tie scenarios in that matchup.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: As a Focus Sash user, Cloyster wants to avoid using Tera when possible, but opposing priority attacks and defensive typings can sometimes make it a necessity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Since Cloyster will often be at extremely low health after Shell Smash, Tera Ghost helps it avoid getting revenge killed by Breloom's Mach Punch and Dragonite’s Extreme Speed. It also provides coverage against Gholdengo with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: The increased damage from Tera Ice makes it very difficult for Pokemon to wall Cloyster without resisting it, with even Corviknight getting OHKOed by +2 Adamant Icicle Spear after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Volt Switch users like Rotom-W love to take Cloyster down to its Focus Sash and pivot to a priority attacker; Tera Ground both nullifies the damage and prevents the switch, giving Cloyster significant momentum with a free turn to Shell Smash. It also lets Cloyster challenge defensive Gholdengo, blocking Thunder Wave and giving +2 Adamant Drill Run a strong chance to OHKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: While Tera Fire Tera Blast actually does less damage to Corviknight than Tera Ice Icicle Spear, Tera Fire otherwise helps Cloyster muscle past Steel-types it traditionally struggles to beat, such as Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal is a niche option that offers no offensive benefits to Cloyster, but it does prevent Mimikyu and Gallade from revenge killing it with Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Considering Cloyster's paper-thin Special Defense, Focus Sash gives Cloyster by far the most setup opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>King's Rock</strong>: King's Rock is a risky option that doesn’t help Cloyster set up, but it does give Icicle Spear and Rock Blast a 41% chance of flinching.</p> </li> </ul>"

It can give free setup when paired with Dragon Dance, or it can turn Dragonite into a long-term defensive disruptor when paired with Roost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: This set benefits immensely from the ability to Terastallize to both boost Extreme Speed's power while also removing Dragon type weaknesses.

Roar</strong>: Dragon Tail is preferred for it disregarding Taunt and providing some good chip damage. However, Roar can phaze out meddlesome Fairy-types and users of Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Teammates</strong>: For this Dragonite to be at its most effective, you'll need some partners to at least set up Stealth Rock. Ting-Lu and Archaludon are particularly bulky examples that pair well, but other options include Landorus-T, Swampert, and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake VS. Iron Head</strong>: Earthquake is the most wide-reaching coverage move, ensuring good damage against Normal resistances like Garganacl and Archaludon. If using Roar, Iron Head prevents Levitate Pokemon from completely walling Dragonite, and its flinch rate synergies well with Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Dragonite's bulk makes it an ace at spreading paralysis, making it more of a team supporter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute versus Encore</strong>: Substitute is a fantastic option against Pokemon with status moves that threaten Dragonite's phazing cycles, such as Garganacl, Porygon2, and Toxapex. Encore won't do as well against these threats but does punish opposing foes carrying Substitute that can be a problem for Dragon Tail along with slower foes that use status moves in general such as Ting-Lu and Ursaluna-B. Encore can even be used over extra coverage if teammates can deal with Fairy-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Extreme Speed versus Aqua Jet</strong>: Extreme Speed's ability to pick off threats is useful, even on defensive variants of this set. Despite being half as powerful, Aqua Jet is still worth considering for its ability to pick off weakened Flutter Mane, which can be difficult for this set to handle due to its power when Multiscale isn't in play.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is a high value item, but it's worth using on Dragonite if using Substitute, as it gives Dragonite a serious chance of passively gaining Multiscale's effect back.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet allows Dragonite to play more passively, punishing Pokemon that rely on contact moves like Choice Item Urshifu-R and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots' Stealth Rock immunity makes Multiscale more flexible, especially if Dragon Tail brings in a threat Dragonite isn't equipped to handle.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread gives up quite a bit of bulk in exchange for outspeeding Adamant Breloom, while still often mantaining a Substitute against Garganacl's Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 124 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is optimized for use with Earthquake and Aqua Jet, allowing Dragonite to 2HKO 4 Defense Flutter Mane with that combination of moves without needing to Terastallize. Only Modest Tera Fairy Flutter Mane will have a chance to OHKO through Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread is a far more offensive approach, mainly for use with Extreme Speed to pick off threats more effectively.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragonite's defensive typing can be quite helpful against foes like Urshifu-R and Chi-Yu, but some of the huge exploitable weaknesses to Pokemon like Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane will require Terastallization to cover.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dragon immunity gels well with Dragonite and is a great defensive typing in general against foes like Chien-Pao and Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is not only an incredible defensive typing that covers much of Dragonite's former weaknesses, but the power boost it provides to Iron Head lets it OHKO all but the most bulky Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal isn't that incredible defensively, but it can be worth it for boosting Extreme Speed's power, letting offensive EV spreads 2HKO Chien-Pao with it.</p> </li> </ul>"

Air Slash also does not trigger Rocky Helmet and is naturally boosted by Dragonite's STAB. The Iron Head variant of Paraflinch, however, gives Dragonite an easier time against a number of common threats such as Flutter Mane, at the cost of struggling against Gouging Fire before they Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore vs. Substitute</strong>: Encore will allow Dragonite to effectively check a wider variety of Pokemon such as Ursaluna-B by locking them into an unfavorable move, giving it a free opportunity to land Thunder Wave on your opponent's switch-in on the following turn.

Against either option, Encore can turn Dragonite practically invincible allowing it to reside on the field indefinitely in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire Spin</strong>: This allows Dragonite to defeat almost any Pokemon universally by simply making full use of its longevity. Trapping an Encore locked Pokemon in the field is also highly valuable. Fire Spin is used instead of Wrap because it affects Ghost-types and doesn't trigger chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Iron Head</strong>: Earthquake prevents Dragonite from being entirely passive against Archaludon, Gouging Fire, and Flutter Mane. Meanwhile, Iron Head fits using Tera Steel, and does massive damage to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor</strong>: With a Bold Nature, Draco Meteor is a powerful move that can catch opposing Dragon-types off-guard and deal big damage to Ursaluna-B and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Heavy-Duty Boots</strong> Generally, Leftovers preserves Dragonite’'s longevity best, as it cancels out the damage from Sandstorm and makes timer stall easier.

Low Kick trades smacking Gholdengo for revenge killing opposing Tera Normal Dragonite and dealing massive damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the best nature for needing less chip damage to revenge kill weakened targets with priority attacks, but Jolly can make sense if outspeeding foes like Modest Gholdengo, Adamant Gouging Fire, and the rare Jolly Breloom is appealing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Almost Required</strong>: This set is highly reliant on using Tera Blast as a luring tool, so Terastallization should be a top priority for Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sharp Beak</strong>: Sharp Beak gives Dragonite the most offensive presence with the fewest drawbacks, giving Flying-type Tera Blast just enough of a boost to usually 2HKO Ursaluna-B, or 3HKO defensive variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest vastly improves Dragonite's matchup against Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane, especially if Multiscale's protection has been lost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots means Stealth Rock will no longer remove this set's ability to trade blows with powerful threats.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>While giving up Extreme Speed and Scale Shot may seem unusual, it allows Dragonite to use both Multiscale and the unpredictability of Terastallization to become an extremely dangerous bulky sweeper that teams often have the wrong response to!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roost</strong>: Despite this set's more offensive approach, Roost is still highly recommended for taking full advantage of Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: Iron Head is a good choice if using Tera Steel, but even outside of that, it offers much more damage against Flutter Mane and common Tera Fairy foes like Raging Bolt and Toxapex than Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Outrage</strong>: Outrage has tremendous power compared to any other attack from Dragonite, but Flutter Mane flipping it into a chance to revenge kill means it's best to lock-in late-game when the sweeping shot is clear.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Ice Spinner works best with Clear Amulet, making sure Landorus-T and Dragonite are easy to break through before they Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is usually preferred for the extra damage output, and the given EV spread still outspeeds Adamant Chien-Pao after a Dragon Dance. Jolly is required for outspeeding Timid Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle though.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire Punch</strong>: Fire Punch is handy for roasting Scizor and dealing good damage to Corviknight, but it can't replace Earthquake, since hitting Archaludon hard is extremely important.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Punch</strong>: If using Tera Electric, Thunder Punch is a less risky alternative to Tera Blast in exchange for getting hit by Rocky Helmet. It's best used with Ice Spinner over Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Low Kick</strong>: Low Kick is an easy way to OHKO Chien-Pao compared to Earthquake, but Flutter Mane laughing at it means Iron Head becomes required coverage, and it does less damage to Archaludon than Earthquake.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Clear Amulet</strong>: Clear Amulet protects Dragonite from Pokemon that can ruin its sweep with Attack debuffs, such as Landorus-T and Charm Flutter Mane, as well as Breaking Swipe users like Gouging Fire and opposing Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry is an effective way around common status spreaders like Flutter Mane, Archaludon, and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Heavy-Duty Boots ensures that Stealth Rock won't break Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: If using Roost, Rocky Helmet is a good way of punishing Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes if it lacks Punching Glove or if switching into Aqua Jet.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High / Medium</strong>: If making use of Tera Blast for Tera types like Flying, Dragonite will usually want to Terastallize as much as possible. Without Tera Blast, it becomes less necessary, but it's still often worth doing due to it making Dragonite a nightmare to OHKO!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Blast Flying offers incredible power with no drawbacks outside of Terastallizing, making it a great choice for sweeping!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a more defensive approach to this set, covering Dragonite's common weaknesses to Fairy, Dragon, and Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: When combined with Clear Amulet, Tera Ground gives Dragonite the tools to defeat common support Flutter Mane moves like Thunder Wave and Charm in addition to a powerful Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric works great with Ice Spinner covering Landorus-T, giving Dragonite another way to soak up Thunder Wave and even Serperior's Glare!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy isn't as great defensively for Dragonite as Tera Steel, but the Dragon immunity is great for keeping Multiscale intact, and it makes Dragonite a good check against Urshifu-S.</p> </li> </ul>"

When boosted by Belly Drum, Liquidation is fully capable of punching through bulky Steel-types—like Corviknight—that Play Rough can't.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore can create an opening to use Belly Drum against slower, more passive foes, such as Ting-Lu, though the decreased offensive coverage can hurt in the long run.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Belly Drum Usage</strong>: While finding a safe opportunity to use Belly Drum can be tough, Azumarill can cushion hits well from and set up on popular sweepers like Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, given that they don't have a Tera type that counters Azumarill. Azumarill can still hit hard even without Belly Drum, so don't force it if the situation looks too dangerous.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong> : 244 HP EVs are used to give Azumarill an even HP number, guaranteeing that Sitrus Berry activates after Belly Drum. The extra EVs are put into Speed to prevent Speed ties with opposing 4 Speed Azumarill.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Belly Drum is inherently risky; smart Tera usage can cushion an attack during setup or provide a stronger coverage option when Belly Drum simply isn't viable to use.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water combined with Belly Drum gives Aqua Jet nightmarish power. After Stealth Rock chip, it can even OHKO Iron Bundle!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire blocks Will-O-Wisp, and the Tera Blast coverage can hit Steel-types like Scizor and Corviknight hard even without Belly Drum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass turns both Grass- and Electric-type weaknesses into resistances, and when combined with Tera Blast, it makes dealing with Unaware Dondozo and Rotom-W much easier. It can also be used to block Spore and set up Belly Drum for free, but this must be done with discretion, as Spore users like Loaded Dice Breloom may just attack and leave Azumarill heavily wounded after Belly Drum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric with Tera Blast is Azumarill's best option to beat Toxapex, and it still deals big damage to Unaware Dondozo and Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul>"

In particular, it punishes Dragon Dance from Lum Berry Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Wish and Protect</strong>: Wish + Protect provides excellent recovery opportunies for both Umbreon and its teammates. With Leftovers's animation as well, its great at stalling out the timer. Protect also scouts for U-turn and Tera.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yawn</strong>: Yawn's ability to force switches generates extra Leftovers recovery and generates momentum for its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Thunder Wave has excellent synergy with Wish.

Thief does offer more consistent damage than Knock Off though, thanks to Technician.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dual Wingbeat</strong>: Dual Wingbeat is Scizor's best option against Ogerpon-H as well Fighting-types like Annihilape and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat is Scizor's best option to hit opposing Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu as well as Steel types, even when using defensive EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf is a shocking twist against Ogerpon-H and Urshifu formes to launch off a strong Dual Wingbeat, but this does mean Scizor's bulk is heavily compromised against the threats it usually checks, like Flutter Mane.</li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: While much less immediately threatening than Choice Band, Assault Vest lets Scizor more comfortably switch into stray special attacks like Gholdengo's and Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball or Rotom-W's Volt Switch, improving its longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band lets Scizor function as a scary late-game cleaner, especially with Tera Steel-boosted Bullet Punch. The high damage output also helps Scizor to break down walls for its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is perfect for more defensive Scizor, letting it continually switch into weaker physical attacks and wear down the team with U-turn and residual damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 92 Atk / 164 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This spread is meant to be used with Assault Vest, letting Scizor almost always avoid a 2HKO from Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball. It also maintains enough Attack investment to always OHKO uninvested Chien-Pao after Stealth Rock chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 68 Atk / 204 Def with Adamant</strong>: This spread avoids an OHKO from Tera Dark Life Orb Chien-Pao, is not 2HKOed by Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast, and reduces the amount of residual damage Scizor receives thanks to the HP stat being 1 lower than divisible by 16.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 68 Atk / 204 Def with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread lets Scizor survive +2 Life Orb Adamant Tera Ghost Mimikyu's Shadow Claw.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Defensive Scizor might seem strange, but when paired with Rocky Helmet, it becomes an effective pivot that can survive extreme attacks: it avoids the OHKO from Choice Band Tera Dark Chien-Pao's Crunch as well as the 2HKO from Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake. Just note that this will make Scizor focus more on pivoting than revenge killing with Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave or Relaxed with a Speed IV of 8 or 9</strong>: This Speed IV can be used to use U-turn after some Hippowdon use Yawn, but still outspeed Ting-Lu. Note that being slower than Ursaluna-B can be troublesome.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can be quite helpful in either cleaning teams or preparing against Scizor's classic Fire-type issues, the power of its priority and pivoting don't make it needed for it to function consistently.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water turns its Fire weakness into a resistance, giving Scizor a fighting chance against dangerous Fire-types such as Chi-Yu, Gouging Fire, and Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is ideal for more offensive Scizor variants, making Bullet Punch an even better cleaning tool. Tera Steel also softens Scizor's weakness to Fire, letting it avoid the OHKO from attacks like Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire is a great response most Ogerpon-H sets, and shields Scizor from burns that foes like Entei like to deal out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Increasing Dual Wingbeat's power with Terastallization nets Scizor some useful new OHKOs against offensive Urshifu formes and Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: While not an incredible defensive typing, Tera Dragon is fantastic against most Fire and Water Pokemon that give Scizor trouble, with Ogerpon formes being a particularly prominent example. As a downside though, it harms Scizor's ability to check Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul>"

With Sitrus Berry, Modest Gholdengo's Shadow Ball is also no longer a 2HKO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 124 Atk / 156 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized spread avoids a 2HKO from Jolly Chien-Pao's Crunch, Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, and Modest Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 28 Atk / 204 Def / 20 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This bulky spread avoids the OHKO from Adamant Tera Ghost Life Orb Mimikyu's +2 Shadow Claw.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The old reliable special wall is still viable, but it now takes a more active role through the use of Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: Flamethrower is great at hitting Tera Steel users like Latios that are commonly employed against stall teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Alluring Voice</strong>: Alluring Voice catches targets trying to set up alongside Blissey, confusing them if they boosted their stats in the same turn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling with Poison Barb</strong>: Fling with Poison Barb gives Blissey a one-time opportunity to poison foes, and is preferred over Toxic Orb since it doesn't poison Blissey itself prior to being thrown. Fling also gets rid of Choice items from Trick users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock remains a trusty support move for Blissey, punishing teams that are forced to switch around Blissey and its teammates.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Shadow Ball can deal good damage to special Ghost-type sweepers like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo. However, Blissey will no longer be able to reliably hit Ursaluna-B, which is a matchup Blissey is normally expected to handle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling with Flame Orb or Toxic Orb</strong>: This is as close as it gets to Blissey regaining Toxic, though getting burned or badly poisoned is devestating if Blissey is the last Pokemon around, making it a risky option.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Blissey is known for shrugging off big special hits with ease. However, its presence at team preview often attracts hard counters, and Tera is one way of dealing with that.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel Tera resists the STAB attacks of Latios and Archuladon while also granting a Fairy resistance for the Flutter Mane matchup. It also prevents poison, which can otherwise force Blissey to switch out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Dark Tera completely ruins Latios's attempts to break through Blissey with Stored Power or Psychic Noise, at least forcing a Calm Mind war. However, Blissey becomes much more vulnerable to Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: The Fighting-type immunity comes in handy for Blissey and prevents it from being trapped, though it does become more vulnerable to Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water puts the brakes on Choice Specs Tera Fire Chi-Yu’s wallbreaking parade, ruining its ability to reliably 2HKO Blissey.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Poison Barb</strong>: Poison Barb complements Fling, letting Blissey use poison to outlast targets that can't heal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak grants a huge immunity to the healing block of Psychic Noise. Beyond that, it is also fantastic for blocking the passive damage from Garganacl's Salt Cure, flinches from Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse, and Special Defense drops from Latios's Luster Purge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: As is the case with most walls, Leftovers’ passive recovery is a great supplement to Softboiled and helps Blissey be less passive itself.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with Calm or Bold</strong>: Beyond making Tera Blissey that much harder to break by foes like Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu, going all-in on Special Defense means less frequent Softboiled uses against special attackers, especially with Leftovers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spd with Bold</strong>: Maximizing both HP and Defense gives Blissey a little extra boost in physical bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

Trailblaze</strong>: Tera Blast Grass has a chance of OHKOing offensive Primarina, OHKOes Swampert, and deals massive damage to Urshifu-R. Trailblaze misses out on these KOes, but the Speed boost can lead to easier sweeping late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze VS. Stomping Tantrum</strong>: Bulldoze is both a way to deal decent damage to opposing Fire-types and a useful support move with its Speed drop. Stomping Tantrum offers a bit more power and can match Sacred Fire in power if Entei misses an attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Crunch</strong>: Crunch is Entei's best coverage option for Latios and Latias.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Iron Head</strong>: Iron Head does a bit of extra damage against Flutter Mane but has limited use otherwise.</li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 244 Atk / 84 Def / 12 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread avoids an OHKO from Adamant Chien-Pao's Tera-boosted Crunch after Stealth Rock damage and a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball without Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>132 HP / 228 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 140 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This spread spread lets Entei outspeed Iron Bundle after using Trailblaze or Bulldoze while only having a 2% chance of being 2HKOed by Choice Specs Timid Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 HP / 132 Atk / 156 Def / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This physically defensive spread survives Tera Dark Choice Band Adamant Chien-Pao's Crunch while still dodging a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball without Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 116 Atk / 4 Def / 252 SpD / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This specially defensive spread dodges a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane even when with Stealth Rock!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 236 Atk / 4 Def / 76 SpD / 188 Spe with with Jolly</strong>: This speedy and frailer spread outspeeds all Landorus-T that lack Choice Scarf while still having enough special bulk to almost always avoid a 2HKO Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Entei's Fairy resistance is a big selling point as an Assault Vest Pokemon, but Terastallization can help with some of its poor matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass helps Entei with Water-types like Primarina and offensive Urshifu-R. Just note that Suicune and Bulk Up Urshifu-R avoid a 2HKO from Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While this Entei doesn't have enough firepower to sweep until late-game, boosting Extreme Speed is still helpful in this regard. It can also save Entei from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy isn't as helpful against bulky Water-types, but it makes Urshifu-S and Choice Band Chien-Pao much more manageable and surprises Gouging Fire that may attempt to set up with Breaking Swipe and Dragon Dance.</p> </li> </ul>"

Grass Tera Blast</strong>: Trailblaze does decent damage to offensive Water-types and lets Entei outspeed the troublesome Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, but Tera Blast is needed to break through bulky Water-types like Suicune.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swagger and Mirror Herb</strong>: This is the closest Entei gets to setting up, giving Entei the chance to pull off a shocking sweep and even be a nuisance with confusion! Outside of Swagger, Mirror Herb can be used for some risky switch-ins to punish setup moves with a boosted Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly VS.

It also has good synergy with Mirror Coat and the less common Counter.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Swampert has excellent bulk and only a single weakness, but opponents will often try to exploit that weakness, often making Terastallization necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire grants a superb defensive typing. Not only does it flip the script on powerful Grass-types like Ogerpon-H and Rillaboom, but its Fairy resistance makes dealing with Flutter Mane much easier.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison covers up Swampert's massive Grass weakness while allowing it to neutralize Toxic and Toxic Spikes throughout the match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel's Dragon resistance can be pivotal for standing in the way of sweepers like Scale Shot Dragonite, giving Swampert an opening to use Yawn or Roar against them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water makes it so that not even Tera Water Choice Band Urshifu-R can 2HKO Sitrus Berry Swampert.

Tera boosted Mystical Fire will also 2HKO maximum HP Kingambit without Assault Vest.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy can patch up this set's lacking power by boosting Moonblast, and the removal of Gardevoir's Psychic typing makes dealing with opposing Ghost-types like Flutter Mane and Mimikyu more manageable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal's defensive attributes are lacking overall, but nullifying a key Ghost-type attack from the likes of Flutter Mane and Mimikyu can give an opening to deal extra damage or inflict a crucial burn.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p>The spreads listed below all have an even HP stat to guarantee that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination. All spreads are also capable of surviving one unboosted Shadow Ball from Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 244 Def / 20 Spe</strong>: Near maximum HP and Defense gives Gardevoir fantastic defensive calcs; after Sitrus Berry recovery and inflicting a turn 1 burn, Gardevoir has a strong chance of avoiding the 3HKO from Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and Assault Vest Ting-Lu's Heavy Slam. The Speed investment outspeeds maximum Speed Adamant Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 204 Def / 60 Spe</strong>: A little extra Speed investment lets Gardevoir outspeed defensive Gholdengo with 20 Speed EVs, but Gardevoir is much less likely to avoid the 3HKOs mentioned in the main spread.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Since it can sleep foes without restriction, Breloom is a monstrous foe that applies serious pressure at Team Preview!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: This is Breloom's best option against Gholdengo and provides valuable speed control.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spore</strong>: As good as Spore is, it's well prepared for enough by threats such as Gholdengo, Garganacl, and Lum Berry that going without it can make sense.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb provides a form of speed control that can't be walled by Flying-types like Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat lets Breloom muscle past bulkier threats more easily, such as Wo-Chien.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: While Breloom can certainly take advantage of Terastallization, Focus Sash variants are used fairly early in the game and often don't need it. Loaded Dice Breloom, however, does like Terastallization covering up its iffy defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: With Tera Blast, Tera Fire provides an alternative way to get past Gholdengo, avoids getting burned by other foes, and gives bulkier Breloom a chance against Flutter Mane and Focus Sash Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a good choice for picking off foes more easily with Mach Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Bullet Seed's boost from Tera Grass means it will OHKO Chien-Pao through its Focus Sash if Breloom rolls at least three hits.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Besides boosting Rock Tomb's damage output, Tera Rock prevents Sandstorm from breaking Breloom's Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground-boosted Bulldoze has a 93.8% chance to OHKO 4 HP Gholdengo, making Breloom a situational lure. It also severely punishes Rotom-W that attempt to Volt Switch out, and Hippowdon that don't Terastallize.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Since Breloom's bulk isn't very good, Focus Sash is the most reliable way to fire off Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: Guaranteeing 4 hits from Bullet Seed can be quite useful for bulkier Breloom sets, clinching an OHKO on Flutter Mane, Chien-Pao, and Iron Bundle regardless of them running Substitute or Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe</strong>: If using Focus Sash, maximizing Speed is important to deal with slower foes that might invest in Speed, such as Corviknight and Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 180 Atk / 76 SpD</strong>: This bulkier spread makes sense if using Loaded Dice and Swords Dance, letting Breloom survive one hit from Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, or Choice Specs Flutter Mane with the correct Tera type.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Poison Heal, Breloom can act as a pivot versus defensive Pokemon such as Dondozo and Umbreon as it is unaffected by Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p>This set can catch opponents expecting the more popular Focus Sash set off guard. However, do note that this set is very susceptible to Taunt and Encore, which can make it difficult to even select Breloom in the team preview phase.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect gives Breloom an opportunity to scout out its opponents and further stall them out once Leech Seed has been set up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Timer Stalling</strong>: If you obtain a numerical advantage early in the match, you can utilize Breloom to win on timer. This is particularly effective since the Leech Seed damage happens after recovery from Leftovers and Poison Heal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulldoze</strong>: Bulldoze allows Breloom to further support its teammates and threaten Gholdengo, which likes to absorb status moves. Do be wary that many Gholdengo are Tera Flying, which can render Breloom ineffective versus it.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic can be difficult to fit into the set, but it allows Breloom to punish Tera Grass foes that attempt to circumvent Breloom's Spore and Leech Seed.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: While Breloom's typing does have some useful resistances, its low bulk means more favorable resistances granted by Terastallization can be key to setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: This defensive Tera type allows Breloom to resist Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear and Skeledirge's Torch Song, both of which are threats to Substitute. It also helps against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, though note that Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Tera Fire Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: This Tera type allows Breloom to resist Ice- and Fire-type attacks while also providing Breloom with a Fairy-type resistance. With Toxic, Breloom is able to fight back against common Grass-type switch-ins. However, this type has more weaknesses when compared to Water.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread allows for maximum physical bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>156 HP / 100 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread allows for maximum Speed and can survive a Choice Band Extreme Speed from Tera Normal Dragonite after Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>204 HP / 164 Def / 140 Spe with Impish</strong>: This spread hits a Speed stat of 108 which ties 4 Spe Adamant Baxcalibur. Furthermore, the defensive investment means that after Terastallization, Breloom's Substitute has a high chance of surviving three hits from Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear.</p> </li> </ul>"

Along with its decent bulk, Thick Fat gives it key resistances to Fire- and Ice-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bullet Punch</strong>: Bullet Punch provides Hariyama with a non-situational priority move that can grab KOs on weakened targets, and, when boosted by Tera Steel, turn the tides against Fairy-type opponents such as Flutter Mane and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fake Out versus Knock Off</strong>: Fake Out gives Hariyama another source of priority, and it can even be used to scout for Covert Cloak users if the opponent doesn't get flinched by it. Knock Off cripples switch-ins by removing their items; however, it can't remove a Booster Energy from an opponent with the Protosynthesis or Quark Drive in Sun or Electric Terrain, respectively, as it's consumed before Hariyama gets to move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Drain Punch</strong>: Close Combat is the stronger move but at the cost of cutting into Hariyama's bulk with each use. Drain Punch can fail to get a 2HKO on specially defensive Ting-Lu more than 90% of the time, but it provides Hariyama with some recovery, bolstering its bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Headlong Rush</strong>: Headlong Rush drops Hariyama's defenses with each use, but it 2HKOes defensive Toxapex and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch gives Hariyama a strong option to hit Dragonite with and can catch it by surprise, considering it isn't pressured to Terastallize against Hariyama's other moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: Heavy Slam, coupled with Tera Steel, provides Hariyama with a strong move against lightweight foes such as Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, Chien-Pao, Mimikyu, and Terastallized Iron Moth and Volcarona that doesn't drop its defenses.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Hariyama can work without Terastallization, it can provide an extra kick to its coverage or improve its defensive presence against certain threats.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel Tera gives Hariyama STAB on Bullet Punch, a resistance to Fairy, Psychic, and Steel, and an immunity to Poison, greatly improving its matchup against Flutter Mane, Mimikyu, Psychic Chi-Yu, Gholdengo, and Tera Fairy Iron Moth and Volcarona. Thanks to Thick Fat, it can take on non-Choice Specs variants of Chi-Yu even after Terastallizing if it's kept healthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Besides the burn immunity, Tera Fire capitalizes on Hariyama's Thick Fat, discouraging threats like Tera Fire Chi-Yu and Choice Band Chien-Pao from using their most powerful moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: While Tera Fighting doesn't provide anything defensively for Hariyama, it makes Close Combat a force to be reckoned with.</p> </li> </ul>"

Drain Punch is weaker, but the recovery can help offset the burn damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Headlong Rush</strong>: Earthquake complements Hariyama's coverage nicely, hitting Poison-types that resist Close Combat. Headlong Rush is stronger, but comes with the drawbacks of lowering defenses and being a contact move, triggering Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch is Hariyama's best hope of hitting Dragonite, as it doesn't fear much from Hariyama's other moves.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Terastallization gives a much appreciated boost to Bullet Punch, but it isn't necessary on every match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Terastallizing into the Steel-type turns Hariyama's Fairy and Psychic weaknesses into resistances along with giving STAB to Bullet Punch.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Latios's useful array of resistances, fantastic use of Terastallization, and good offenses make it a strong choice for either a wallbreaker with Choice Specs or revenge killer with Choice Scarf!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Luster Purge</strong>: Despite its low PP and poor offensive coverage, Luster Purge's high chance of dropping Special Defense still makes it a great wallbreaking tool.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn</strong>: While Flip Turn is weak, Latios forces enough switches to make it a reasonable offensive pivot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick gives Choice Scarf Latios an option to nearly shut down defensive Pokemon like Porygon2 and Ting-Lu and situationally lock offensive foes like Dragonite and Chien-Pao into more manageable moves. Choice Specs Latios isn't quite as effective with this, but its it's still worth considering for crippling defensive foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball VS. Aura Sphere</strong>: Shadow Ball is Latios's best move against Gholdengo and will 2HKO most Flutter Mane sets as well. Aura Sphere leaves Latios reliant on Special Defense drops to deal with Gholdengo, but it is a more direct option against common Tera Steel foes like Dragonite and opposing Latios.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: While not a defensive set, Calm Mind is a reasonable option for boosting Draco Meteor and Luster Purge to dangerous power levels.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Beam</strong>: Ice Beam is handy for letting Choice Specs Latios OHKO Assault Vest Landorus-T and deal massive damage to Ting-Lu, though Draco Meteor has more general utility in many cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Knot</strong>: If using Choice Specs, Grass Knot pulls a 2HKO even on Sitrus Berry Ting-Lu, though it being resisted by so many popular Pokemon like Dragonite makes it a risky move to be locked into.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Surf</strong>: If using Tera Water, Surf is a reasonable coverage option against Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt offers good coverage against most Steel-types, but it is a very risky move to be locked into due to Ground-types like Landorus-T and Excadrill.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Latios's typing isn't amazing defensively, but the very useful resistances to Urshifu-R's and Ogerpon-H's STAB moves mean Terastallization isn't always an upgrade. Still, thanks to Levitate, Latios has some effective defensive options to consider.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has superb synergy with Levitate, making Latios an effective offensive check against common foes like Landorus-T and Dragonite while giving Latios great counterplay against Fairy-types like Flutter Mane defensively and offensively with Tera Blast. This also lets Latios tank a Blood Moon from Ursaluna-B, though the Vacuum Wave weakness can be bothersome afterwards.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire also gives Latios a vital resistance to Fairy-types while maintaining the resistances against Ogerpon-H's STAB moves and providing a powerful Tera Blast against most Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water covers Latios's issue with Ice-type attacks, which can save it in a pinch against Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle, while still retaining an important resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric removes all of Latios's weaknesses except from Mold Breaker users with Earthquake like Excadrill and provides a useful paralysis immunity against common status spreaders like Porygon2, Flutter Mane, and Serperior.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a decent alternative to Tera Steel, giving Latios a good option against Dragon-types while still retaining a Fighting-type resistance.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs VS. Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Specs is preferred on Latios for the excellent wallbreaking potential. Choice Scarf Latios is a reasonable revenge killer, but it still doesn't deal well with Chien-Pao due to the Sucker Punch weakness, making it more reliant on unique qualities like Trick and Levitate to separate itself from other Choice Scarf revenge killers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Soul Dew</strong>: While not as effective at breaking walls as Choice Specs, Soul Dew is a reasonable alternative to still take advantage of Luster Purge's Special Defense drops, and it is a great way of getting around Item Clause issues if Latios still needs a power boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Latios isn't frail, but Focus Sash lets it threaten offensive threats it normally has no bussiness with, such as Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Neutral Nature</strong>: It's best to use a neutral nature with a Timid Mint to ensure that Latios can eat any berry without getting confused after using Trick.</li> </ul>"

Its wallbreaking powers are impressive too, with Choice Band Surging Strikes in the rain 2HKOing even maximum HP Miraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ogerpon-W</strong>: Ogerpon-W doesn't share any of Kyogre's weaknesses beyond Freeze-Dry, making it a good bulkier rain beneficiary that still has plenty of power. Ogerpon-W also has Play Rough, ensuring that Koraidon switch-ins are not entirely safe.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Archaludon</strong>: Electro Shot's lack of a charge turn in the rain makes Archaludon a fearsome bulky sweeper, especially since Stamina and Body Press combine to help against Blissey and Ting-Lu before Archaludon Terastallizes.</p> </li> </ul>",

Choice Specs with a Modest nature trades cleaning for being extremely difficult to wall, with even Blissey risking a 2HKO from Water Spout! Ice Beam will also now OHKO offensive Koraidon.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Kyogre already has a fantastic offensive and defensive typing, so Terastallization is more of a bonus than a necessity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water brings Kyogre's wallbreaking potential to the next level, with even Choice Scarf Kyogre now being able to 2HKO Blissey with Water Spout and Choice Specs Kyogre being able to 2HKO even the bulkiest of Assault Vest Alomomola with Water Spout.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy puts Koraidon in a tough spot, with the rain weakening all of its offensive tools.

It's also key for taking on other Dragon-types such as Dragonite and Miraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder</strong>: Thunder lets Kyogre zap opposing Water-types such as Tera Water Calyrex-I and opposing Kyogre.

Just note that most Ho-Oh run Earthquake, which means Tera Electric isn't a perfect response to its Brave Bird.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: This Kyogre is usually best off with defensive Tera types, but Tera Water's absurd damage output lets Water Spout 2HKO even Blissey, making it a better option against stall teams.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Empoleon's fantastic typing and good movepool make it a great choice for a specially defensive Stealth Rock setter.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yawn versus Roar</strong>: Yawn has fantastic synergy with Stealth Rock, forcing foes to either take damage or be put to Sleep. Roar is more reliant on Stealth Rock being set up first, but it isn't as vulnerable to common Substitute foes like Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flash Cannon versus Ice Beam</strong>: Flash Cannon is the preferred STAB move for dealing good damage to Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle. Ice Beam is still worth considering for dealing far more damage to Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn versus Surf</strong>: Flip Turn makes Empoleon a good pivot despite its low damage output, though Surf is still a reasonable alternative for doing good damage against Ground-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roost</strong>: Despite Empoleon's good defensive profile, Roost can be hard to fit in since it means either giving up support or coverage. Still, it does make Empoleon a better check with Flutter Mane when paired with Flash Cannon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm versus Sassy</strong>: In addition to making Flip Turn stronger, Sassy's lower Speed can help Empoleon pivot out last. However, Sassy forces a Speed tie with 4 Speed EV Ursaluna-B unless 20 Speed EVs are used. If the power drop isn't an issue, a Calm nature with a Speed IV of 17 can be used to reach the same Speed.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Empoleon's superb typing means Terastallization should only be used to flip certain troublesome match-ups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying floats above common Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ursaluna-B, and it additionally grants an important Fighting-type resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a good response against Fighting-types like Urshifu while making Electric-types such as Zapdos and Vikavolt less problematic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: In addition to a Ground-type resistance (though this can be risky against Landorus-T), Tera Grass saves Empoleon from Breloom's Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Bug isn't normally a great defensive type, but the resistances to Fighting and Ground, combined with not being weak to Electric, makes it a viable choice on Empoleon.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is the most reliable healing item, especially when getting free turns with Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry's quick burst of recovery is a decent alternative to Leftovers. Make sure to use 244 HP EVs with it so it activates after getting hit by Ting-Lu's Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: Empoleon is an especially effective user of Air Balloon with its offensive advantages against Ground-types, doing especially well against Gliscor thanks to Empoleon's Toxic immunity.</p> </li> </ul>"

Grass Knot's coverage is less impressive, but it prevents Empoleon from being totally walled by bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Milotic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn</strong>: Flip Turn will require giving up coverage or priority, but Empoleon is a bulky enough pivot to justify it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vacuum Wave</strong>: While not being a strong priority move, Vacuum Wave is great for picking off weakened threats, especially Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Competitive versus Torrent</strong>: Competitive is the most reliable option for checking Flutter Mane, punishing Charm variants and ensuring that Special Attack drops from Moonblast turn into an advantage.

The Fairy and Ice resistance is also very helpful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy goes all in on the Dragon immunity, no longer being worried about common Fire and Ground coverage from other Dragon-types like Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: The incredible power boost Earthquake gets from Tera Ground is worth considering, with Choice Band possibly 2HKOing physically defensive Porygon2 and Dondozo with it.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band trades revenge killing for wallbreaking, letting Garchomp deal massive damage to Porygon2 and Ursaluna-B with Outrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: With Choice Scarf, Garchomp is able to revenge kill several other major Choice Scarf users, such as Gholdengo, Landorus-T, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

It’s also notable for letting Hippowdon retain immunity to its own Sandstorm chip.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water improves the lead matchup with Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R, and overall is a strong defensive type that still takes good advantage of Hippowdon’s imposing bulk.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry’s burst recovery is what allows properly invested Hippowdon to avoid 2HKO’s from some of the meta’s strongest attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: If Hippowdon is able to execute an extended Yawn loop, Leftovers passive recovery is a great boon. Such loops can often force the opponent to sacrifice something to sleep to prevent Hippowdon from healing up to full.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While Hippowdon’s support focus makes this a less common item choice, Slack Off combined with smart usage of Terastallization can make this item work to surprising effect.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: Patching up Hippowdon's weaker Special Defense is extremely useful against special attackers. With this maximized spread, Hippowdon has a 6.3% chance of surviving Timid Gholdengo's +2 Make It Rain, always survives Modest Chi-Yu’s unboosted Overheat, and avoids the 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane’s Moonblast if using Sitrus Berry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with Impish</strong>: A physically defensive spread means not even Choice Band Dragonite’s Outrage will be able to 2HKO Sitrus Berry Hippowdon.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also gives Magnezone a much-appreciated Fire resistance for Pokemon like Chi-Yu, Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and Volcarona, and lets Magnezone take on Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying has wonderful defensive synergy with Magnezone, reversing its Ground and Fighting weaknesses, and lets Tera Blast hit Grass-types harder.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy-type Tera Blast is very useful against common Dragon-types, most notably Garchomp and Roaring Moon, and hitting bulky Dark-types such as Ting-Lu, Wo-Chien, and Umbreon hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Gaining a resistance to Dark allows Magnezone to surprise and defeat Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hydreigon, in addition to dealing plenty of damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Grass has excellent defensive and offense synergy with Magnezone, especially through its utility against Ground-type attackers and Spore immunity. Most notably, Tera Blast Grass can OHKO max SpD Hippowdon with Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: The boost from Tera Steel makes Steel Beam absurdly powerful, with Analytic letting Choice Specs Magnezone OHKO even offensive Multiscale Dragonite!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground helps against opposing Magnezone, OHKOs Iron Moth, and deals good damage against Gholdengo and Kingambit.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: Magnezone's excellent typing means investing in bulk is a great idea. However, note that some important targets such as Corviknight and Skeledirge are a tad faster than it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Calm</strong>: With maximum Special Defense investment and Assault Vest, Magnezone becomes a good soft check against Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, and one of the best pivots in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 SpA / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: While this spread sacrifices a large amount of power, in exchange it outspeeds Adamant maximum Speed Kingambit, who can threaten to deal massive damage otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest</strong>: If using Sturdy, Magnezone can run maximum Speed to outspeed unexpected foes, such as Specially Defensive Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: The increase in special bulk helps Magnezone against the myriad of Choice item special attacking Dragon-types, like Hydreigon and Dragapult. If using Calm, Magnezone can even take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs gives Magnezone a devastating amount of power, with even Clodsire having trouble handling it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: The temporary Ground-type immunity helps Magnezone against foes like Garchomp and Dragonite without Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Analytic</strong>: A Magnezone boosted by both Choice Specs and Analytic is incredibly hard to switch into, making it easier for Magnezone to generate momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: With Sturdy's guaranteed survivability and Magnezone's high damage output, Magnezone will very likely take down at least one Pokemon per game. Sturdy also helps Magnezone play around Dondozo, as it can safely come in on Fissure and use Volt Switch against it, which renders Yawn moot. However, if Magnezone switches into a Yawn and not Fissure, it should be noted that Dondozo often runs Protect to block Volt Switch and ensure Magnezone falls asleep.</p> </li> </ul>"

On the other hand, Earthquake Gliscor can pressure Steel-types to Terastallize into something that Eternatus can more easily deal with. Finally, Tera Fairy Eternatus can pair with Gliscor to make a good defensive core against Miraidon.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Speed EV Benchmarks</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>124 or 36+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds uninvested Ogerpon formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 or 44+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Adamant Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>188 or 92+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Modest Glimmora.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>172+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Adamant Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>188+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Timid Glimmora.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Landorus-T.</p> </li> </ul>",

This also pairs well with Toxic to keep Gliscor safe as the opponent succumbs to poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake allows Gliscor to threaten Steel- and Poison-types that are otherwise immune to its Toxic-stalling antics.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off’s item removal can allow Gliscor to be more of a team player, removing items such as Leftovers and Rocky Helmet to assist a teammate’s sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Baton Pass</strong>: Gliscor’s immense longevity makes it particularly well suited to passing Substitutes, bolstering its team’s defense while giving them turns to set up.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 36 Def / 244 SpD with Impish</strong>: The physical bulk on this set allows Gliscor to live Jolly Choice Band Koraidon's Outrage on all but the highest damage roll. The special bulk gives Gliscor roughtly a 19% chance to place a Substitute after getting hit with Timid Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 4 Atk / 28 Def / 20 SpD / 228 Spe With with Jolly</strong>: The Speed investment allows Gliscor to outspeed major foes like Jolly Landorus-T and Adamant Urshifu-R, making it more of a nuisance against faster-paced teams at the cost of some survivability. Enough special bulk is maintained to avoid the OHKO from Timid Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. The leftover EVs are mostly used for some extra physical bulk, but can be reallocated to maximize Speed if desired.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium:</strong> Gliscor's natural immunities to troublesome attacks like Electro Drift, Volt Switch, and Fissure are huge benefits, but its vulnerability to popular multi-hit and sound-based attacks means Terastallization has strong defensive utility.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel allows Gliscor to resist Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type moves, giving it increased survivability against a wider array of threats, with the resistance against the Substitute-ignoring Hyper Voice from Ursaluna-B being a big boon. However, Steel leaves it more vulnerable to Fighting-types like Urshifu-S and Fire-types like Ogerpon-H. When using Tera Steel, make sure not to Terastallize on the first turn, or else Toxic Orb will fail!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Gliscor crucial Ice- and Water-type resistances, allowing it to get emergency Toxics off against threats like Urshifu-R and Primarina, both of whom can ruin Substitute with Surging Strikes and Sparkling Aria respectively. It's also a great response against Chien-Pao, especially since Substitute and Protect scout against Electric Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy completely negates Dragon-type attacks, making it impossible for Scale Shot and Outrage to overwhelm Gliscor. Tera Fairy also retains Gliscor's Fighting-type resistance, which can be important for bulky cores trying to defend against Choice Band users like Koraidon and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark's Ghost-type resistance and Psychic-type immunity can make handling Calyrex-S more feasible. Neutralizing Psychic Noise is particularly notable for keeping Poison Heal working.</p> </li> </ul>"

Especially notable is Scared Sword, letting Gallade ignore Stamina Archaludon's accumulated boosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Night Slash versus Knock Off</strong>: Night Slash's consistent power is best for pure offense, potentially 2HKOing targets like Bold Gholdengo, assuming they can't stall with Recover and Rocky Helmet. If more utility is desired, Knock Off can be used for removing opposing items.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong>: Shadow Sneak Gallade's most consistent as a priority move, dealing good damage to targets like Gholdengo and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Blade</strong>: Leaf Blade OHKOes Primarina and is Gallade's best hope of muscling past Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Triple Axel</strong>: Though it suffers from some reliability issues, Triple Axel makes Dragonite rue the day it didn't Terastallize against Gallade!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Cutter</strong>: Aqua Cutter benefits from Sharpness, but it doesn't add a lot of extra coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Feint</strong>: Feint lets Gallade pick off weakened Dragonite before they can launch Extreme Speed, but otherwise hitting Gholdengo with Shadow Sneak is usually more useful.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Gallade uses Focus Sash or Assault Vest as its main tool for cushioning a big hit and has great natural coverage. Therefore, Tera is reserved mostly for emergency situations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Beyond offering a useful Fairy-type resistance, Tera Fire blocks Volcarona from burning Gallade.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark not only boosts Night Slash and Knock Off, but provides a key Ghost-type resistance against Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel flips Gallade's weakness to Fairy-type attacks to a resistance. The Ice resistance can also be used in a pinch to keep Baxcalibur's Icicle Spear from OHKOing Gallade through Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost's immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type moves can thwart revenge kill attempts from Mach Punch users and Extreme Speed Dragonite, giving Gallade an opportunity to break Multiscale on the latter.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Gallade has enough Special Defense to make good use of Assault Vest, which lets it survive Tera Normal Ursaluna-B. Compared to Focus Sash, Assault Vest isn't rendered useless by Stealth Rock chip, making Gallade a safer mid- or late-game option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: With Focus Sash, Gallade duels opposing Focus Sash users with its hard-hitting STAB attacks and priority moves, letting it focus on Speed investment.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scope Lens</strong>: While Scope Lens is risky due to Gallade's average bulk and Speed, it pairs well with the increased critical hit ratio many of Gallade's attacks have.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 244 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 116 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This spread is to be used with Assault Vest, surviving Silk Scarf Tera Normal Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon and Vacuum Wave together, while outspeeding even Timid Ursaluna-B and Jolly Ursaluna.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Adamant or Jolly</strong>: A maximum offense spread is standard for Focus Sash and Speed ties with offensive Adamant Dragonite. Jolly can be used to get the jump on Modest Archaludon, especially if using Shadow Sneak to stop Sturdy variants from activating Custap Berry in time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 244 Atk / 28 SpD with Adamant</strong>: Sacrificing Speed for bulk lets Assault Vest Gallade survive Life Orb Tera Normal Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon followed by Vacuum Wave.</p> </li> </ul>"

Night Slash has more offensive presence than Knock Off and is a good choice if you really need to hit Gholdengo with consistent damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Triple Axel versus Leaf Blade</strong>: Triple Axel makes Gallade a surprising revenge killer against Garchomp and severely punishes Dragonite that don't Terastallize. Leaf Blade helps against more defensive foes, being a great coverage option for slashing through Primarina and being your best move against Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick with Choice Scarf lets Gallade permanently cripple setup Pokemon like Annihilape and Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Choice Scarf Gallade normally isn't a strong user of Tera.

This way, it can't be confused by any Berries given with Trick.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Discharge</strong>: While weaker than Thunderbolt, the 30% paralysis chance can be devastating for some of Rotom-H's more troublesome matchups, such as Chi-Yu. Do note though that Choice Scarf Rotom-H will have a much harder time 2HKOing Assault Vest Azumarill and certain variants of Dondozo.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: If not running Tera Blast, Rotom-H normally wants to keep its unique typing for defensive purposes, allowing it to switch into several key threats.

Thunder Wave is still a reasonable choice, though, stopping special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Iron Moth in their tracks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick and Flame Orb</strong>: This one-use method of burning may seem silly, but taking away important items can be devastating against certain Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, and Rotom-H can use this to get rid of troublesome Choice items if it's taken a Trick as well. Note that Rotom-H will burn itself if it Terastallizes while holding Flame Orb, which is generally not good outside of blocking sleep or Toxic poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Using a Neutral Nature with a Bold Mint</strong>: If using Trick, it's best to run a neutral nature such as Serious and change the stat boosts with a Bold Mint. This way, Rotom-H won't get confused by any Berry it receives.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Rotom-H's defensive typing is very valuable, so Tera is normally reserved for very specific situations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel with Levitate is a sublime defensive typing, letting Rotom-H better handle huge threats like Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is an alternative option to soak up Dragon-type attacks, and it also gives Rotom-H a better matchup against Great Tusk and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While this unfortunately makes Gholdengo a much bigger issue, Tera Ghost is still worth considering for making Rotom-H immune to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Iron Valiant's Close Combat. It also lets Rotom-H switch out of trapping moves without using Volt Switch.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is Rotom-H's ticket to staying around the longest, usually avoiding 2HKOs from powerful unboosted attacks such as Dragonite's Outrage and Iron Valiant's Close Combat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rotom-H's typing makes it a good user of Rocky Helmet, passively punishing physical Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Iron Valiant and making it a good response to expected uses of U-turn.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Rotom-W's Speed access to Volt Switch and great typing make it an excellent pivot and revenge killer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick and Neutral Natures</strong>: If using a Choice item, Trick is seriously worth considering for its ability to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Garganacl and Dondozo. Make sure Rotom-W is a neutral nature that has had a Timid Mint used on it. This way, Rotom-W can eat any Berry without getting confused.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Rotom-W's excellent typing means its fully functional without Terastallizing, but thanks to Levitate, it's still a powerful user of it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: When combined with Tera Blast, a Fairy Tera type lets Rotom-W take on Chien-Pao Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Roaring Moon far more effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Not only does the damage boost from Tera Electric come in handy, but it also removes any weaknesses Rotom-W has.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Terastallizing back to its Ghost-type roots gives Rotom-W a vast array of immunities, helping against Dragonite and Great Tusk in particular. It also makes Shadow Ball viable for picking off Ghost-types with Choice Scarf.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs tends to be safer to Trick than Choice Scarf, and it gives a big power boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf lets Rotom-W outspeed major threats such as Iron Bundle, Chi-Yu, and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Increasing Rotom-W's special bulk gives it a far better matchup against foes like Flutter Mane, Chi-Yu, Iron Bundle, and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD with Modest</strong>: This spread sacrifices Rotom-W's revenge killing potential, but, in exchange, it makes it a better pivot, and the better bulk makes Rotom-W more suited to finding the right time to cripple a wall with Trick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: Maximizing Rotom-W's Special Attack is part of what makes it an effective revenge killer if using a Choice Scarf.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 108 SpA / 140 SpD / 4 Spe with Calm</strong>: This spread is meant for Assault Vest, letting Rotom-W avoid a 3HKO from Modest Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Levitate and excellent status moves make Rotom-W a clean choice for a bulky pivot!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Foul Play</strong>: Foul Play is essential for hitting Baxcalibur hard, since it's immunity to burns would otherwise let it set up on Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp versus Thunder Wave</strong>: Will-O-Wisp's ability to cripple top-tier physically offensive threats such as Dragonite, Chien-Pao, and Scizor as well as punish the otherwise problematic Iron Hands makes it the best support option. However, Thunder Wave does provide additional insurance against Baxcalibur and punishes special attackers such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hydro Pump</strong>: Hydro Pump gives Rotom-W offensive presence against foes that don't care about the rest of the moveset, like Garganacl, Chi-Yu, Volcarona, and Skeledirge.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Discharge</strong>: Giving Rotom-W an Electric STAB attack to better deal with Flying-types like Corviknight and Tera Flying Roaring Moon is useful, but it can be tricky to fit into the set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hex</strong>: If using Tera Ghost, Hex gives Rotom-W a much fiercer offensive kick than usual after inflicting status.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Defensive Rotom-W works fine without Terastallizing, but some Tera types do make it harder to break through.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel gives Rotom-W an incredible defensive typing, vastly improving its matchups against Pokemon that rely on Ground-type coverage such as Dragonite, Baxcalibur, and Garchomp. It also provides a useful Freeze-Dry resistance against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy guards against fearsome powerful Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-type attacks that Rotom-W can have trouble handling and lets it use Tera Blast to hit Dragonite and Chien-Pao hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost offers Rotom-W a vast array of immunities with Levitate, enabling it to defeat certain Dragonite sets and do much better against Iron Hands and Iron Valiant when Rotom-W lacks Will-O-Wisp. Being a Ghost-type also prevents Rotom-W from getting trapped, letting it escape faster trappers without Volt Switch.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry will turn many powerful, unboosted attacks such as Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao's Crunch, Dragonite's Outrage and Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush into 3HKOs. Just make sure to run an even HP stat so that Sitrus Berry activates with one use of Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: If Sitrus Berry is already in use, Leftovers is a reasonable alternative.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet's extra chip damage can make Rotom-W a less passive pivot.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a great typing, ability, and good bulk, Rotom-W makes for an effective user of Nasty Plot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: This move is essential for getting past Dragon-types like Dragapult and Roaring Moon. Even when not Terastallized, it's a decent coverage move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hydro Pump versus Substitute</strong>: Hydro Pump is by far Rotom-W's strongest STAB, but it can be worth sacrificing for Substitute, which lets Rotom-W effectively defeat most Garganacl and defensive Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While this Rotom-W can sweep on its own, Terastallization can prevent revenge kills from the likes of Iron Bundle.</li> <li></li> <li><strong>Fairy</strong>: With a Fairy Tera type, Rotom-W can turn the tables on its Dragon-type adversaries, as well as catch Crunch Chien-Pao off guard.</li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry lets Rotom-W easily set up on Hippowdon, and avoid getting put to sleep by Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: If Sleep isn't a big issue, Rotom-W appreciates the burst recovery Sitrus Berry provides. Make sure to run an even HP stat so it activates after Rotom-W gets hit by Ruination once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If using Hydro Pump, this is Rotom-W's best way around Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe</strong>: Maximizing Speed with a Timid nature gives Rotom-W the jump on Gholdengo. If Gholdengo isn't an issue, a Modest nature will still outspeed Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD with Modest</strong>: Rotom-W's good bulk can be maximized instead of outspeeding Breloom; this spread avoids the 2HKO from Timid Gholdengo's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 180 Def / 84 SpA with Bold</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized spread avoids a 2HKO from Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao and Timid Flutter Mane.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its great bulk and the advent of Terastallization, Cresselia is a formidable defensive presence with the ability to take over late in the game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: Calm Mind allows Cresselia to bolster its defensive profile while also increasing its damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Moonblast</strong>: While lacking STAB, Moonblast has no immunities, which makes it Cresselia’s most reliable offensive move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stored Power</strong>: While blanked by Dark-types, Stored Power allows Cresselia to threaten walls like Unaware Dondozo and more reliably win Calm Mind wars against foes like Flutter Mane. It also allows Cresselia to potentially beat Heatran with sheer power should it accrue enough boosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Beam</strong>: Ice Beam allows Cresselia to immediately threaten the many Ice weak Pokémon in the metagame, such as Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong> - Thunderbolt allows Cresselia to immediately threaten Urshifu-R and is a great general attacking move if used with an Electric Tera.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: While difficult to fit, Substitute can protect Cresselia from debilitating status from the likes of Toxapex and Dondozo, giving it a wider reach against slower paced teams without relying on Covert Cloak as much.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lunar Dance</strong>: While seemingly odd on a defensive set, Lunar Dance allows Cresselia to bring back a battered teammate in the event it itself cannot finish the game, giving formidable partners such as Chien-Pao and Ursaluna a second chance to break down the opponent.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak guards Cresselia from adverse effects such as flinches and Defense drops that would otherwise impede its ability to take over the endgame. It also negates the passive damage from Garganacl’s Salt Cure, allowing Cresselia to heavily punish it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers’s passive recovery allows Cresselia to better conserve its limited Moonlight PP, more safely set up against powerful attackers like Flutter Mane, and be a more active presence on the field by not mandating it use a turn to heal off every hit it takes manually.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Cresselia makes excellent use of Terastallization thanks to its bulk and Levitate, especially since its presence at team preview attracts hard counters.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Thanks to Levitate, Tera Electric grants Cresselia a complete lack of weaknesses, giving it an extremely diverse defensive profile courtesy of its immense bulk. It also guards against paralysis, minimizing the chance of an ill-timed lost turn ruining a sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison protects Cresselia against Toxic, allowing it to more safely set up against Pokémon like Toxapex. It also grants security against even Tera Fairy Choice Specs Flutter Mane by allowing Cresselia to resist Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel combined with Levitate puts the brakes on Tera Normal Ursaluna-B while also giving a great defensive matchup into Tera Flying Dragonite and Tera Fairy Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy grants Cresselia a crucial resistance to Dark, allowing it to better take on foes like Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

Since Dragonite can still switch out to reset its ability, this option works best with Stealth Rock support.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This set's support focus and bulk usually do not require Terastallization, making Cresselia an excellent partner for the sweepers it supports.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy lets it resist Dark-type attacks from the likes of Chi-Yu while also nullifying Scale Shot setups from attackers like Dragonite and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric remains a solid option thanks to Levitate, giving Cresselia essentially no weaknesses and providing an important paralysis immunity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel makes it much harder for Latios to muscle through Cresselia while still maintaining a very favorable matchup against Dragonite thanks to the synergy with Levitate.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Cresselia is frequently targeted by Taunt users like Flutter Mane, making Mental Herb a great option to guarantee Trick Room is set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is a strong general option for further augmenting Cresselia's longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is useful for breaking Focus Sash from targets like both formes of Urshifu, making it more difficult for them to stall out an incoming Trick Room sweep.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Wish and a slow Flip Turn, Alomomola has a strong combination for providing team healing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Alomomola can use Wish and Protect to give itself reliable self-recovery, and this combination makes Alomomola great at stalling out turns against weather, Terrains, and Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: Aqua Jet is weak on Alomomola but still excellent at picking off severely weakened threats such as Focus Sash Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Play Rough</strong>: Play Rough deals sizable damage to Koraidon without Terastallization but is otherwise fairly situational.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Scald</strong>: Scald's burn chance can punish physical attackers like Dragonite and Chien-Pao for trying to set up on it, but it's rather inconsistent.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Skill Swap</strong>: Skill Swap is a unique way to prevent Gliscor that lack Taunt from setting up on Alomomola and its team. It can also be used on Ogerpon-W's Water Absorb to make Flip Turn possible against it.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Physically bulky Alomomola already has good typing against the threats it wants to wall, but there are times when Terastallization is needed to augment its role.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Fighting-type resistance can be used to buy more time against Koraidon and Urshifu-R as well as just outright walling powerful Dragon-type moves like Outrage and Scale Shot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison improves the Flutter Mane matchup and provides important support for removing Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is fantastic for chipping the likes of Koraidon and Dragonite just by switching into their contact moves. Paired with Alomomola's recovery support, it has great potential to stack this damage up over time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers synergizes well with Protect, and the extra passive recovery can give Alomomola greater freedom to pass Wish to its teammates.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 252 Def / 140 SpD with Relaxed</strong>: The physical bulk on this EV spread is tuned for Scale Shot from Jolly Koraidon, guaranteeing Alomomola can survive up to nine individual hits before recovery. With Leftovers and Protect, it almost always guarantees that Alomomola can live two unboosted Moonblasts from Timid Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with Relaxed</strong>: A simple spread that tops out physical bulk, but the main benefit is that maximizing Alomomola's HP bumps the recovery teammates will receive from Wish.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD with Relaxed</strong>: While it sacrifices some physical bulk, the higher special bulk investment helps Alomomola to almost always avoid the 2HKO from Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast, all without needing Leftovers.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Flip Turn and Regenerator combine to make Alomomola one of the hardest pivots to efficiently take out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: Alomomola makes excellent use of Mirror Coat with its high base HP, retaliating comfortably against top special attackers like Ursaluna-B and Raging Bolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scald</strong>: Scald's moderate burn chance makes Alomomola even more threatening to physical attackers like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: Uninvested Aqua Jet may not do much, but it's still useful for picking off common Focus Sash users and Sturdy Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Play Rough</strong>: Play Rough lets Alomomola deal more direct damage to the likes of Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R, especially when paired with Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icy Wind</strong>: Icy Wind's speed control can be useful for wallbreakers like Choice Band Chien-Pao and Choice Specs Chi-Yu. Furthermore, targets like defensive Dragonite are still faster than Alomomola after a single Speed drop, allowing it to maintain its safe pivoting support.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Liquidiation</strong>: Liquidation helps Alomomola deal decent overall damage if forced into a situation where it has to play offensively such as against Calm Mind Flutter Mane.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Alomomola is extremely difficult to OHKO, and with Terastallization, it can thwart its counters and live even longer! Do note though that losing its original typing can make it much more vulnerable to wallbreakers like Tera Water Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison grants pivotal Fairy and Grass resistances against Flutter Mane, Rillaboom, and the Ogerpon formes. The immunity to Toxic and Toxic Spikes is also a big help.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy helps against Dark- and Fighting-type attacks from Chien-Pao and the Urshifu formes and can be used alongside Play Rough to give Alomomola more kick against these targets.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>52 HP / 212 Def / 244 SpD with Relaxed</strong>: This EV spread gives Alomomola a balanced defensive profile. The Special Defense investment avoids the OHKO from Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Overheat even if Alomomola is Terastallized.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 76 Def / 244 SpD with Relaxed</strong>: This spread contributes extra to surviving special attacks; in particular it has an approxiately 90% chance to avoid the 2HKO from Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast as well as having about a 75% chance to avoid the 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse. Enough Defense investment is maintained so that Jolly Chien-Pao's Tera Blast Electric only OHKOes Alomomola on the highest damage roll.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, unlike Tera Steel it does not grant a resistance to Dragon, and it also gives Hydreigon a few new weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosts Dark Pulse into an absurdly powerful weapon, and when coupled with its flinch rate, Tera Dark Hydreigon can potentially muscle its way out of otherwise hopeless situations.</p> </li> </ul>"

Just note that Tera Fairy compromises Volcarona's ability to check Gholdengo effectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: With a Grass Tera type, Volcarona can now 2HKO most Dondozo with Giga Drain and is better insulated against revenge kills from Water-types like Primarina and Basculegion, at the cost of being vulnerable against opposing Volcarona.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Besides removing all of Volcarona's old weaknesses, a Water Tera type also massively improves the match up against Primarina and Basculeigon, and gives a powerful Tera Blast to use against Skeledirge.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Stealth Rock is common enough that this is the safest item for Volcarona to hold.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry gives Volcarona more durability against teams that lack hazards, and with an even HP stat, it'll eat Sitrus Berry right away after switching into Sealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: This allows Volcarona to recover from status once against threats like Spore Breloom, Yawn Dondozo, and Thunder Wave Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If using Tera Water against Garganacl, Covert Cloak stops it from beating Volcarona with Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Kee Berry</strong>: Kee Berry's activated Defense boost makes Volcarona even more difficult to revenge kill, though it can only be used once per match.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Odd HP versus Even HP</strong>: Volcarona will usually prefer an odd HP stat to take less residual damage, with Stealth Rock no longer 2HKOing being the most important if Volcarona loses Heavy-Duty Boots from Knock Off.

However, it still retains Thundurus-T's weakness to Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs versus Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Specs makes Thundurus-T difficult to wall without an extremely sturdy special wall, with even Pokemon like Clodsire and Cresselia at risk of a 2HKO. Choice Scarf, on the other hand, allows Thundurus-T to double as a good revenge killer, outspeeding major threats like Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: While Thundurus-T isn't known for its bulk, Volt Absorb means Assault Vest makes Thundurus-T more effective at checking other Electric-types, especially when using bulkier EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Bulkier EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>20 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 228 Spe with Timid</strong>: This Assault Vest spread outspeeds both Urshifu formes and takes 70% maximum from Timid Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry without sacrificing power.</p> </li> <li> <p>188 SpA / 68 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid or Modest**: This spread is optimized for Assault Vest, letting Thundurus-T survive Timid Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry without Terastallizing.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>0-3 Attack IV</strong>: Foes that commonly run Foul Play such as Amoonguss and Rotom-W have more powerful moves to use against Thundurus-T, but there's no drawback to minimizing Foul Play's damage.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thundurus-T's massive Special Attack stat and array of immunities make it a good user of Nasty Plot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Knot</strong>: Grass Knot is integral for potentially OHKOing physically defensive Ting-Lu after a boost and usually OHKOing offensive Ursaluna.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Life Orb is great for wallbreaking, allowing Thundurus-T to potentially OHKO Ting-Lu with a boosted Grass Knot. Sitrus Berry is still a good option, though allowing Thundurus-T to instantly restore some health after being hit by Ruination, as long as its maximum HP is an even number.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired with Tera Water, Substitute lets Thundurus-T set up on Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Blast</strong>: Focus Blast's unreliability makes it hard to recommend for most teams, but it's the only way Thundurus-T will break through Hisuian Goodra without Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Giving up coverage is risky, but Taunt shuts down a lot of defensive counterplay against Thundurus-T such as Whirlwind Ting-Lu and Toxic Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Thundurus-T's typing is totally functional for sweeping and wallbreaking, but Terastallization makes it far harder to revenge kill thanks to Volt Absorb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gives Thundurus-T a powerful STAB option, letting it cleave through specially bulky foes, like Water Absorb Clodsire, particularly easily.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: While Tera Water does leave Thundurus-T vulnerable to certain Pokemon, such as Water Absorb Clodsire and Hisuian Goodra, it's a fantastic defensive Tera type that lets it deal with other common Electric-types that Terastallize like Regieleki and Zapdos.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice is a great offensive option, letting Thundurus-T cleave through most Ground-types that aren't weak to Grass such as Landorus-T and Clodsire. Thundurus-T even makes good defensive use of it, resisting Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Bulkier EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li><strong>108 HP / 4 Def / 140 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread lets Thundurus-T survive Timid Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry, if it doesn't have an offensive item, making it a good choice for more defensive items Thundurus-T may use such as Sitrus Berry.</li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>0-3 Attack IV</strong>: Thundurus-T isn't getting hit by Foul Play that often, but a lower Attack IV is marginally useful regardless.</li> </ul>"

The Attack EVs also let Earthquake 2HKO offensive variants of both Urshifu formes and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: Investing fully in special bulk makes Landorus-T much more consistent into special attackers like Flutter Mane.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While many matchups favor Landorus-T's natural typing, other threats such as Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R will require Terastallization if attempting to set up in front of them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dragon-type immunity is critical for stopping Scale Shot setup from Dragonite and making Substitute much harder to break.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its good natural bulk, Sylveon can serve as a potent special attacker and decent revenge killer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast serves as a good alternate STAB attack once Sylveon has Terastallized, providing highly valuable coverage against the Steel-types that could otherwise exploit it, like Scizor. It also gets around potential users of Throat Chop before Terastallization, such as Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock</strong>: This is Sylveon's best shot of dealing with Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Shadow Ball hits foes such as Mimikyu, Flutter Mane, and Gholdengo super effectively, and it means Sylveon does not have to Terastallize to hit Gholdengo for good damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Quick Attack</strong>: Though it is weak, Quick Attack gives valuable priority for picking off weakened threats, and thanks to Pixilate, surprise users of Tera Ghost aren't able to absorb it. A Quiet nature can be used to increase its power, though this risks Sylveon getting outsped by Kingambit.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: Psychic deals more damage to physically defensive Toxapex and Amoonguss, but its lower damage output against Iron Moth makes it disappointing if not using Tera Ground.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Beam</strong>: Despite the serious risks from the recharge turn, Hyper Beam's extreme power makes it a good filler move.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest lets even offensive Sylveon be specially resilient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: With the boost from Choice Specs, Sylveon is a surprisingly potent wallbreaker, making the most out of its many opportunities to switch in.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA</strong>: This spread capitalizes on Sylveon's good natural bulk while maximizing its power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe</strong>: While no bulk investment makes Sylveon more difficult to safely get in, Speed investment allows it to outrun and threaten a wider range of foes, such as Scizor and Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Sylveon suffers coverage issues on its own, so its heavily reliant on either Tera Blast or the sheer power of Tera Fairy Hyper Voice to break past them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire allows Sylveon to break past troublesome Steel-types, like Gholdengo and Kingambit, and gives it a key resistance to Ice- and Fire-type attacks from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives good coverage against Fire-types like Iron Moth and Skeledirge, in addition to surprising Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu by resisting their strongest STAB attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground doesn't match up quite as well against Steel-types as Tera Fire, but it lets Sylveon turn the tables on Iron Moth, and deal massive damage to Toxapex and Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Getting an extra boost on Hyper Voice and Hyper Beam makes Choice Specs Sylveon far more difficult to wall, with even resists such as Gholdengo and physically defensive Skeledirge getting 2HKOed by Hyper Voice!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Giving Sylveon extra special bulk lets it take on powerful threats like Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle more reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs turns Sylveon into a surprising wallbreaker, especially if using Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Throat Spray</strong>: With Hyper Voice activating Throat Spray, Sylveon could potentially break apart slower foes in the late-game, though it only gets one shot at this Special Attack boost. This is best used with Tera Blast to give Sylveon an alternative STAB attack that doesn't activate Throat Spray.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its good bulk and Special Attack and a reasonable healing move in Wish, Sylveon is a good choice for a bulky Fairy-type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Voice</strong>: Hyper Voice gives Sylveon a reliable STAB even when Terastallized, and hits through common Substitute users like Iron Bundle and Wo-Chien. While It's possible to drop this attack for Tera Blast in an attempt to run more coverage, this seriously worsens Sylveon's matchup against Chien-Pao and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Beyond just Terastallization, Tera Blast is still impacted by Pixilate, making it a good move to use against foes that sometimes carry Throat Chop, like Chien-Pao and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect pairs excellently with Leftovers, and makes Wish a more reliable recovery move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yawn</strong>: Sylveon's good bulk makes it a great choice for phazing with Yawn.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock</strong>: Psyshock is Sylveon's best hope for Iron Moth switch-ins.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: Shadow Ball offers important coverage on Gholdengo without demanding that Sylveon Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Leftovers is the preferred recovery item for its synergy with Protect and Wish, but Sitrus Berry is a reasonable alternative if Protect isn't wanted, or if another teammate needs Leftovers more.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Sylveon's coverage issues are much easier to deal with when using Terastallization, but this set can still be used well defensively without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: A Fire Tera type grants Sylveon resistances to Steel and Fairy, allowing it to take on foes it would otherwise have to run from, such as Gholdengo, and a good STAB to hit Chien-Pao hard with if not using Hyper Voice. It also works against Scizor, but note that Tera Water is common on that foe. Tera Fire also makes Sylveon far more vulnerable to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a great mono-attacking option, making it ideal if only running Tera Blast to do decently well against Steel-types. It also gives Sylveon a better matchup against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, and is a safer option against Ting-Lu and Tera Water Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: If not using Tera Blast, Fairy becomes a reasonable option for boosting Hyper Voice's damage output. Note that Tera Blast is not needed to justify a different Tera Type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground worsens Sylveon's matchup with Chien-Pao, but it does let it deal big damage to Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Toxapex.</p> </li> </ul>"

While Heavy Slam isn't very useful against heavy targets, it's worth using for OHKOing offensive Flutter Mane, one of the biggest threats in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor versus Ice Beam</strong>: Draco Meteor's power makes switching offensive threats like Urshifu-R into Hisuian Goodra tricky, and it is notable for 2HKOing Dondozo. Ice Beam lets Hisuian Goodra punish important Ground-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acid Spray</strong>: Acid Spray is a useful wallbreaking tool, capable of making even specially bulky foes like Clodsire risk taking massive damage after the Special Defense drop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt is another way to 2HKO physically defensive Dondozo and OHKO offensive Urshifu-R and pairs very well with Ice Beam in terms of coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: While not particularly strong, Earthquake is highly recommended for 2HKOing Heatran and 3HKOing opposing Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra, as both of these will wall this set otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: For other Steel-types like Gholdengo and Scizor, Flamethrower will deal much more damage than Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Quiet</strong>: The importance of mirror matches makes Modest an appealing option for Hisuian Goodra, but Quiet will ensure that all but the bulkiest Flutter Mane will need to Terastallize to avoid an OHKO from Heavy Slam.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Surf</strong>: Surf is a decent option to hit Ground-types and Heatran with one attack, but Surf will, at best, usually only 3HKO Heatran.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Despite Hisuian Goodra's superb typing, its common weaknesses to Ground and Fighting make Terastallization a valuable route for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying covers Hisuian Goodra's former weaknesses fantastically, even giving it an out against Fissure Dondozo. This comes at the cost of doing much worse against Iron Bundle, Thundurus-T, Zapdos, and Rotom-W though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy still gives Hisuian Goodra a vital Fighting resistance, as well as being a good defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water has good synergy with Sap Sipper, giving Hisuian Goodra a sole weakness to Electric, in addition to gaining a useful Ice resistance against Chien-Pao, at the cost of doing worse against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: If using Heavy Slam, there is a a chance that Hisuian Goodra can become infatuated by the very rare Cute Charm Enamorus, making a female gender very slightly superior.</li> </ul>"

Ice Beam, on the other hand, is a safer and stronger option against Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rest and Chesto Berry</strong>: Rest and Chesto Berry combine to give Hisuian Goodra a great way to restore health, though the combination is only reliable once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Dew</strong>: Life Dew doesn't restore much health even with Leftovers, but it can help Hisuian Goodra last longer against some physical threats after setting up.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Hisuian Goodra's fantastic typing doesn't make Terastallization a requirement, but it does make setting up against major physical threats like Urshifu-R and Landorus-T much more feasible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only covers all of Hisuian Goodra's former weaknesses, but it also means Fissure is no longer an option to break through its boosts from the likes of Dondozo or Ting-Lu. The new weaknesses to Electric and Ice can harm it though, since Electric- and Ice-type coverage moves are commonly special.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Hisuian Goodra shielding from both Urshifu formes without giving it the harmful Electric and Ice weaknesses that Flying does, though it can harm mirror matches against Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Careful or Sassy</strong>: This specially defensive spread is Hisuian Goodra's best shot at avoiding a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera Fairy Moonblast, assuming extra Leftovers recovery from Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe with Impish or Relaxed</strong>: Maximum physical bulk means Hisuian Goodra won't check Flutter Mane nearly as well, but it let will let Body Press become a better sweeping tool.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Acid Armor</strong>: Acid Armor is the best option for boosting Defense due to its higher PP, but it requires Hisuian Sligoo to evolve while knowing the move in either Scarlet or Violet, as it's not able to be relearned by Hisuian Goodra. Shelter is still a viable, albeit strictly inferior, option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Female Gender</strong>: While very rare, Heavy Slam being a contact move means Hisuian Goodra does risk of activating Enamorus's Cute Charm, making a female gender a marginally better choice.</p> </li> </ul>"

This makes Icicle Crash the more consistent option for overall damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Support Partners</strong>: Even though Avalugg stops foes such as Dondozo from using Fissure, it lacks the power to cleanly beat these targets on its own. Common stall teammates such as Toxapex and Clodsire can bring Toxic or Toxic Spikes to spread status, allowing Avalugg to simply stall while poison wears down the opposition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: Full investment into HP and Defense give Avalugg insane physical bulk. Even Choice Band Chien-Pao’s Sacred Sword isn’t a reliable 2HKO!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: Combined with Sturdy, Mirror Coat is a tempting last resort against the special attackers that Avalugg can’t wall. However, this almost assuredly destroys Avalugg’s survivability afterwards, which can compromise the defensive cycle of its team.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Situational</strong>: Most commonly a member of stall-based teams, Avalugg’s bad matchups are supposed to be covered by the team’s defensive cycle. Tera is normally only used if it is necessary to prevent the collapse of said defensive cycle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting balances offense and defense, making Tera Dark targets like Urshifu-S and Choice Band Chien-Pao much easier to deal with while giving a sizable boost to Avalugg’s best attack in Body Press.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy provides both a Fighting- and Dark-type resistance, making it the best defensive type into Urshifu-S. Furthermore, it doesn't have the Flying-type weakness of Tera Fighting, so Tera Flying Dragonite and Landorus-T are still manageable.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost lets Avalugg escape from precarious situations against trapping moves and Gothitelle. It also outright walls Close Combat from the likes of Iron Hands and Iron Valiant, although the new Dark-type weakness significantly worsens its matchup with Chien-Pao.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: Since Avalugg can expect to do a lot of switching, removing its vulnerability to Stealth Rock damage is extremely important for its longevity and preservation of Sturdy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Avalugg can punish many physical attackers it switches into with Rocky Helmet chip, slowly wearing them down without having to be offensively involved.</p> </li> </ul>"

A Careful nature allows Incineroar to outspeed important threats in Speed-invested Ursaluna-B and Calyrex-I, while a Sassy nature allows it to pivot more slowly in mirror matches.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 212 Atk / 44 SpD with Adamant</strong>: This more offensive spread allows Incineroar to have a much greater offensive presence, notably OHKOing Flutter Mane and 2HKOing Calyrex-I with Flare Blitz, while still enabling it to take a Tera Blast Fighting from Choice Specs Calyrex-S.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Toxapex stands out as a masterful spreader of poison to support its teammates, and an effective bulky pivot against common foes like Urshifu-R as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic is the most reliable way to spread the deadliest version of poison and is especially effective against Taunt users like Annihilape and Serperior if using Mental Herb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes</strong>: Toxic Spikes makes the team less reliant on Toxapex to spread status directly, and acts as excellent support for stalling teammates like Ting-Lu, Dragonite and Gliscor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Haze</strong>: Even with Toxapex's great bulk, powerful setup sweepers like Dragonite and Urshifu-S quickly get out of control for it, so Haze is the best solution to prevent Toxapex from being setup bait.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Liquidation versus Poison Jab</strong>: Liquidation isn't particularly strong but it allows Toxapex to 2HKO Chi-Yu and is a great option for breaking Substitute against targets like Flutter Mane. Poison Jab leaves Toxapex completely walled by Steel-types, but it does preform better against Water-types like Primarina and Ogerpon-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Baneful Bunker</strong>: If using Black Sludge or Leftovers, Baneful Bunker is a fantastic way to spread poison against physical attackers and get some extra recovery with one moveslot, but keep in mind that this won't work against Urshifu-R. It's also key for scouting dangerous uses of Trick from the likes of Gholdengo and Latios.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physically Defensive versus Specially Defensive</strong>: Physically defensive Toxapex does well against some hard-to-check threats, such as Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao. Maximizing Special Defense on the other hand, almost always lets Toxapex survive Tera Normal Life Orb Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Infestation</strong>: Infestation is Toxapex's best chance of doing chip damage to Toxic-immune threats, such as Corviknignt and Gholdengo, and the trapping works fairly well against foes that do have problems with Toxic. It also prevents double switching from being an issue for Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Chilling Water</strong>: Chilling Water gives Toxapex another tool against physical sweepers, but makes it much more vulnerable to Substitute in general.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization can help Toxapex beat a new set of threats, its bulk and good defensive typing usually makes it a rare occurrence compared to its teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy removes all of Toxapex's weaknesses and can save it from taking massive damage from Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse. It also does well against powerful Dragon-type attacks such as Choice Band Dragonite's Outrage and Choice Specs Archaludon's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass gives Toxapex an important Ground resistance while still preforming well against Urshifu-R, with the bonus of stopping Breloom's Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides making Toxapex far less vulnerable to Electric, which Chien-Pao often Terastallizes into, Tera Poison retains the ability to restore health with Black Sludge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While Normal isn't an impressive defensive type, Tera Normal can punish Choice locked Ghost-types, such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: While the Stealth Rock weakness can be an issue, Tera Bug is a niche way to resist Ground-type attacks while being neutral to both Ice- and Electric-type moves, unlike other methods.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying not only protects Toxapex from its irritating Ground-type weakness but also means Fissure Dondozo will no longer pressure Toxapex. However, this typing makes Toxapex much worse into general offense.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: With Mental Herb providing one-time protection from Taunt, Toxapex can surprise foes like Annihilape and Serperior with Toxic, which is especially helpful if not running an attack. It also provides some cushioning against common Encore users like Dragonite and Primarina.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge versus Leftovers</strong>: Having passive healing is wonderful, especially with Baneful Bunker. Black Sludge is a clever way to get around Item Clause, but Leftovers gives Toxapex less drawback when using Tera types that aren't Poison.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet makes Toxapex a superb response to Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, and generally lets it punish common users of contact moves like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also has an advantage over Protect in that it isn't bypassed by the Urshifu formes, making it particularly dangerous to Urshifu-R that lack Punching Glove. On the other hand, Protect can block pivoting moves that would otherwise reset Curse, and it's generally better at stalling out effects such as Terrains and Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Thunder Wave is a good fallback that can permanently cripple targets, especially those that don't fear Rocky Helmet.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Mimikyu already has the tools it needs to perform its role without Terastallization.

It is also strong against Koraidon's Flare Blitz.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a more niche option that makes it easier to cushion Zacian-C and rack up additional damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Odd HP Number</strong>: Though the situation rarely comes up, an odd HP number is desirable so that Mimikyu can use Curse twice from full health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>12 Speed EVs</strong>: Because Mimikyu is only 1 base Speed point lower than Urshifu, it is not uncommon to redistribute some EVs from Attack into Speed to outspeed bulky Urshifu. 12 Speed EVs is the minimum needed, though further investment is recommended, since even bulky Urshifu formes will bump their Speed by a few points.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 252 Atk / 20 Def / 4 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread survives Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash after Disguise has been broken. The HP investment is also optimized to reduce residual damage from the likes of Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 196 Atk / 164 Def with Adamant</strong>: The extra physical bulk now allows Mimikyu to survive Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash after both Stealth Rock damage and a Disguise break.

Disguise helps cover the fact that Mimikyu is using a slower Will-O-Wisp, but be wary of Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: While dealing damage isn't this set's focus, Rocky Helmet is still useful for wearing down bulky physical attackers like Koraidon and Urshifu-R that might otherwise pose problems for common Trick Room sweepers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Mental Herb foils Taunt usage meant to stop Mimikyu from setting Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb allows Mimikyu to function better as a secondary attacker, especially when the opponent is trying to stall out Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak is for targets that rely on flinching to stop Mimikyu, such as Icicle Crash Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ability Shield</strong>: Ability Shield can stop Moongeist Beam Lunala and Mold Breaker Ogerpon-H from knocking out Mimikyu through Disguise.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Mimikyu usually wants to keep its original typing, both for maintaining Curse's Ghost-type effect and for the Scale Shot immunity versus Koraidon and Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar keeps all the benefits of Mimikyu's superior typing while giving a little extra offensive power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal's Ghost-type immunity helps Mimikyu control momentum against Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water combined with Rocky Helmet can cause fits for the likes of Flare Blitz Koraidon and Surging Strikes Urshifu-R.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>0 Speed IV with a Relaxed or Brave Nature</strong>: Mimikyu generally wants the slowest Speed possible for moving first in Trick Room. The main disadvantage to this Speed outside of Trick Room is not being able to outrun uninvested Dragonite. If Mimikyu is running standard uninvested Speed, use an Impish or Adamant nature instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP EVs</strong>: All spreads below optimize HP to take as little damage as possible from sources like Stealth Rock and Disguise breaks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 28 Atk / 252 Def with Relaxed</strong>: Focusing on physical bulk makes it so that even Tera Water Choice Band Urshifu-R will struggle to OHKO Mimikyu. It also survives Adamant Scizor's Bullet Punch even after accounting for Stealth Rock damage and a Disguise break.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 252 Atk / 28 Def with Brave</strong>: This spread gives Mimikyu a much better offensive presence for when it's needed. Enough physical bulk is maintained to survive Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash after Disguise is broken.</p> </li> </ul>"

Thanks to its Mold Breaker property, a boosted Necrozma-DM can cleave through Pokemon with Unaware like Dondozo and Skeledirge as well as ignore abilities like Mimikyu's Disguise and Dragonite's Multiscale.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sunsteel Strike</strong>: Sunsteel Strike is another powerful ability-ignoring STAB move that does huge damage to Tera Fairy Pokemon especially. However, running both STAB moves has the downside of being resisted by Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake is good complementary coverage that can be used to hit Steel-type foes like Scizor and Archaludon that can take Necrozma-DM's STAB attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: Swords Dance raises Necrozma-DM's already high Attack to extraordinary heights and allows it to rip through teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: With its naturally good bulk fortified even more by its ability Prism Armor, Necrozma-DM can survive many super effective hits, but there are times when Terastallization will be needed to survive especially powerful attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is the clear premium Tera type, as it is a generally solid defensive typing that critically affords Necrozma-DM a resistance to powerful Fire-type moves from threats like Koraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground should be used with Earthquake to give Necrozma-DM a STAB boost and also has the benefit of nullifying Miraidon's devastating Electric-type attacks. Blocking paralysis from Thunder Wave is an additional benefit that potentially provides a free turn of setup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Tera Dragon is an alternative defensive Tera type to Water that grants Necrozma-DM a resistance to both Koraidon's Fire-type moves and Miraidon's Electric-type moves as well as both of Ogerpon-H's STAB moves. However, it may leave Necrozma-DM vulnerable to Chien-Pao's Ice Shard.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry is a good choice that provides Necrozma-DM with pinch healing, keeping it healthy enough to set up or continue a sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry helps protect Necrozma-DM against status conditions from moves like Yawn and Will-o-Wisp that foes may use to try to slow it down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Weakness Policy</strong>: With its good defensive stats, Prism Armor, and common weaknesses, Necrozma-DM is one of the best users of Weakness Policy. If it is activated on the turn Necrozma-DM sets up Trick Room, then it can start sweeping immediately!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>0 Speed IV with a Brave nature</strong>: This makes Necrozma-DM as slow as possible to function most optimally under Trick Room. However, even with minimum Speed, it will never be able to underspeed Ursaluna-B or anything slower than that.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>31 Speed IV with an Adamant nature</strong>: In light of the awkward Speed tier mentioned above, Necrozma-DM can opt to forgo minimum Speed. With this adjustment, Necrozma-DM can outspeed defensive foes in the base 60-70 Speed range, such as Skeledirge, Scizor, and Corvinight, outside of Trick Room. If Necrozma-DM is not using minimum Speed, it is important to be mindful of the timing of Trick Room when facing foes in that Speed range!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 228 Atk / 36 Def with Brave or Adamant</strong>: This spread maximizes Necrozma-DM's bulk and Attack while ensuring it is guaranteed to survive one unboosted Astral Barrage from Timid Calyrex-S as well as giving it a very high chance of surviving Adamant Tera Water Choice Band Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, without requiring a defensive Tera type in either case.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Rillaboom’s physical stats, Grassy Surge, and decently powerful priority give it a unique niche over Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: Rillaboom is a fairly good pivot, especially when paired with teammates that love Grassy Terrain support like Raging Bolt and Grassy Seed Sneasler.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drum Beating versus Wood Hammer</strong>: A secondary Grass-type attack can be considered for extra power. Drum Beating's speed control can help incoming teammates, while Wood Hammer's high Base Power combined with the Terrain Boost can OHKO threats such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>High Horsepower</strong>: While Knock Off will deal more initial damage against Gholdengo, High Horsepower deals more damage afterwards against particularly bulky Gholdengo, and is Rillaboom's best attack against bulky Fire-types like Gouging Fire and Incineroar.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast can be a big commitment, but the ability to flip several important matchups can be worth it, especially if it supports incoming teammates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest versus Choice Band</strong>: Assault Vest is best for making Rillaboom a bulky offensive support Pokemon, letting it take on powerful special attackers like Flutter Mane and Ursaluna-B more effectively. Choice Band is more independent and relies much more on pivoting, but it makes Rillaboom an awesome revenge killer that strikes fear into the heart of all but very bulky Flutter Mane!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Rillaboom generally wants to save Tera for a teammate, but many poor matchups can be turned around with Terastallization when needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire grants a Fairy resistance alongside Fire and Ice resistances for Ogerpon-H and Chien-Pao, as well as protection from burn spreaders like Entei. However, this comes at the expense of no longer being able to defensively check Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Tera Rock can flip the script on Extreme Speed Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Gouging Fire by resisting their best attack and retaliating with big damage from Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass makes Grassy Glide even more effective at sniping foes, with Assault Vest Rillaboom now being able to OHKO offensive Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice is a poor defensive type outside of the Iron Bundle matchup, but with Tera Blast, it's Rillaboom’s most powerful option for hitting Dragonite and Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water provides a balanced defensive profile, giving Rillaboom Ice and Fire resistances while maintaining its matchup into Urshifu-R.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 148 Atk / 4 Def / 156 SpD / 60 Spe with Adamant</strong>: With Assault Vest and Grassy Surge recovery, this spread avoids the 2HKO from Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry without having to Terastallize. The Speed investment lets Rillaboom outrun Jolly Garchomp after a single Drum Beating.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Adamant or Jolly</strong>: Severely compromising Rillaboom's bulk is risky, but outspeeding Modest or Timid Gholdengo depending on the nature used can be a big surprise when using Choice Band Rillaboom.</p> </li> </ul>"

The HP EVs help Rillaboom get the most efficient recovery out of Grassy Terrain. Finally, thek given Speed EVs let Rillaboom outrun up to paralyzed Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Spe</strong>: An offensive spread still works well with Grassy Seed, and the investment in Speed lets Rillaboom outrun Modest Gholdengo, Adamant Dragonite, and Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / High</strong>: Terastallization is often needed to help Rillaboom get going, either by taking attacks from would-be counters or blowing through key matchups with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire lets Rillaboom defend against Chien-Pao's and Ogerpon-H's best attacks simultaneously. It also works great alongside Grassy Surge, reducing Earthquake's damage back to neutral levels.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock</strong>: Tera Rock with Tera Blast gives Rillaboom a well-rounded matchup into Dragonite, allowing it to deal super effective damage while also resisting Extreme Speed. Earthquake is less of a problem too thanks to Grassy Terrain!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice is used offensively with Tera Blast to blindside targets like Dragonite and Landorus-T. While it is lacking defensively, it does still give Rillaboom a useful Ice resistance versus Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a bit more unorthodox, but the boost to Grassy Glide gives Rillaboom more immediate revenge killing power.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Corviknight's fantastic typing makes it a great physically defensive pivot, easily getting dangerous teammates in such as Chien-Pao, Flutter Mane, and Ogerpon-H in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Body Press versus Iron Head</strong>: Body Press has decent damage output and helps massively against common Dark-types like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S. Meanwhile, Iron Head ensures that Corviknight will not be walled by Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Corviknight might not be fast, but it's fast enough to shut down most other defensive Pokemon with Taunt, such as Ting-Lu and Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave Bird</strong>: Brave Bird's recoil is unwelcome, but it's a fantastic response against Ogerpon-H, who otherwise will scare Corviknight off.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Neutral Speed Natures versus Negative Speed Natures with a Speed IV of 4 or 5</strong>: Negative Speed natures are handy for giving very slow U-turns when used in conjunction with lower Speed IVs, as well as not risking getting hit by Ursaluna-B's Earth Power while using Roost. Just note that going any lower than 4 Speed IVs will underspeed Ting-Lu before it can be shut down by Taunt, and powerful Special attackers like Primarina outspeeding Corviknight can be a problem for some teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Tailwind</strong>: Tailwind is an incredible support move for making powerful sweepers like Urshifu-R even more difficult to revenge kill, though its short time span can make it tricky to fully take advantage of.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight's defensive typing is fantastic, so don't Terastallize too hastily, or else it'll lose to threats it normally checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Dragon and Fairy weaknesses are devastating, but in the late-game, resisting Electric and Fire can give Corviknight new win conditions against foes such as Ogerpon-H that lack Play Rough and Tera Water Urshifu-R. Just note that Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire may not seem like a good fit for a pivot due to the Stealth Rock weakness, but it vastly improves Corviknight's chances of defeating Ogerpon-H and Tera Electric Chien-Pao, making it a worthy defensive choice. Do note that this won't help much against Choice Specs Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: While this set doesn't always use Brave Bird, Tera Flying lets Corviknight keep its typing while using Roost, meaning Earthquake and Fissure can no longer hit Corviknight while its restoring health. It also improves Corviknight's chances against Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Corviknight consistently survives all but Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Overheat, letting it deal serious damage with Body Press. It also gains a key resistance to Ice for Chien-Pao and Water for Tera Water Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Getting STAB on Body Press can give Corviknight a surprisingly decent chance at cleaning weakened teams, though this makes it especially vulnerable to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: While turning Corviknight's incredible Ground-type immunity into a weakness is unfortunate, Tera Electric otherwise improves a wide variety of match-ups, with Tera Electric Chien-Pao and Raging Bolt being particularly major ones.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: This lets Corviknight wear down physical threats more quickly while pivoting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's consistent recovery can be quite helpful for taking repeated hits from Ruination when attempting to stall it out with Pressure.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: Mirror Armor's ability to punish Flutter Mane for using Mystical Fire makes it a great ability choice on Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Corviknight's excellent bulk and Taunt makes Pressure a good alternative for stalling out foes such as Gliscor and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 SpD with Impish or Relaxed</strong> This spread has enough bulk to avoid a 2HKO from Timid Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump as long as they lack an offensive item, which can be especially useful if using Pressure. Just beware of Iron Bundle's Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 20 Def / 236 SpD with Careful or Sassy</strong>: This specially defensive spread won't check major physical threats like Dragonite nearly as well, but it does avoid a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "IronPress": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Corviknight stands out as one of the best choices around for sweeping with Iron Defense and Body Press, thanks to its excellent typing and Roost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head versus Brave Bird</strong>: Iron Head ensures Flutter Mane isn't a reliable check to Corviknight, in addition to making it an even better Swords Dance Mimikyu check. Brave Bird is less reliable at beating Flutter Mane, but severely punishes Ogerpon-H switch-ins.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn versus Taunt</strong>: While U-turn with this set may seem strange, Corviknight is still a decent pivot even if it must give up Taunt. Just note that this keaves Corviknight completely walled by Ghost-types like Flutter Mane. Taunt on the other hand, lets Corviknight effectively shut down slower defensive Pokemon, such as Ting-Lu and Dondozo. Note that both options leave Corviknight hopelessly walled by Flutter Mane.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Corviknight has a fantastic defensive typing, so only Terastallize if you need to win certain matchups, especially since it becomes vulnerable to Toxic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: With a Fighting Tera type, Body Press is easier to sweep with, with many Ting-Lu variants now being 2HKOed by boosted Body Press. It also gets rid of enough of Corviknight's common weaknesses that foes like Ogerpon-H and Raging Bolt will check Corviknight far less reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Corviknight a way to resist both Chien-Pao's and Chi-Yu's most powerful STAB attacks, though Modest Tera Fire Choice Specs Chi-Yu can still OHKO with Overheat. It also stops Tera Water Urshifu-R from cleaving through Corviknight's Iron Defense with Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: A Dragon Tera type lets Corviknight resist common attacks aimed at it, such as Electric- and Fire-type attacks from foes like Raging Bolt and Ogerpon-H respectively. However, the new weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon make this an especially reactive Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: While Tera Fire leaves Corviknight extremely vulnerable to Urshifu-R, in exchange it retains the important Fairy-type resistance and does well against Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Flying Tera type lets Corviknight retain its Flying typing even when using Roost, making it a more reliable check to Fissure users such as Dondozo and Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: The passive damage from Rocky Helmet against foes like Dragonite give Corviknight a much easier time using U-turn over Iron Head.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Since this Corviknight attempts to sweep, Sitrus Berry's burst of quick recovery can make it less pressured to spend a turn using Roost. Leftovers on the other hand, will still keep healing Corviknight even after being hit by Ruination, so it can make sense with Pressure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Maranga Berry</strong>: A Special Defense boost granted from Maranga Berry makes it far more difficult for foes like Flutter Mane to revenge kill Corviknight, and it can even be paired with Terastallization to defeat Raging Bolt!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: When paired with Taunt, Covert Cloak makes Corviknight an effective Garganacl check provided that it isn't Tera Ghost, though note Corviknight will no longer drop Flutter Mane's Special Attack with Mirror Armor.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: Mirror Armor means Flutter Mane can't use Mystical Fire without getting its Special Attack dropped, unless Corviknight is holding Covert Cloak.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Corviknight's ability to take powerful, low PP moves such as Close Combat after Iron Defense makes Pressure a viable alternative, in addition to giving Corviknight a better chance of dealing with Ruination from Ting-Lu effectively.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 76 Def / 180 SpD with Impish</strong> The Special Defense investment stops Iron Bundle from 2HKOing Corviknight with Hydro Pump, especially useful if revenge killing one with Body Press. Just remember that Encore means Corviknight is still vulnerable to Iron Bundle ruining set up attempts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 20 Def / 236 SpD with Careful</strong>: While Body Press will be significantly weaker on this specially defensive spread, it does avoid a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball, making this spread especially effective with Iron Head and Mirror Armor.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Bulk Up giving an Attack boost, Corviknight is free from having to use Body Press for good damage output, making it easier to run Taunt against defensive foes without fear of being walled by Ghost-types like Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head versus Brave Bird</strong>: Iron Head reliably 2HKOs Chien-Pao without a boost and is a fantastic tool against Flutter Mane, while Brave Bird is a great response against Ogerpon-H and the only hope of 2HKOing Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Physically Defensive versus Specially Defensive</strong>: Physically Defensive Corviknight takes on common Pokemon like Dragon Dance Dragonite and Urshifu-R more comfortably, while focusing on Special Defense stops Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane from 2HKOing Corviknight with Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Power Trip</strong>: Power Trip takes several boosts to get powerful, but it's Corviknight's best shot at dealing decent damage to Gholdengo. It also makes Corviknight a viable option on Baton Pass Blaziken teams, especially since it relies less on Terastallization to defeat Dark-types than Latias.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Remember that most of Corviknight's good Tera types leave it vulnerable to Toxic, so Terastallize carefully and only win a win condition is clear.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is an effective tool against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, though note that Choice Specs Chi-Yu can OHKO with Tera Fire boosted Overheat. It also prevents Urshifu-R from revenge killing Corviknight with Tera-boosted Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: This Tera type lets Corviknight retain its Flying typing while using Roost, meaning Fissure users such as Dondozo are much easier to handle, and giving Brave Bird a healthy boost in power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Once Fairy-, Ice-, and Dragon-types are out of the way, the Dragon Tera type allows Corviknight to turn the tables on most Ogerpon-H.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: There are few better Tera-types to use against Ogerpon-H than Tera Fire, which unlike Tera Dragon, will retain an important Fairy resistance. It does make Urshifu-R a huge problem as a drawback.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: If using Power Trip, Tera Dark is highly recommended to boost its damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Armor</strong>: In addition to punishing Flutter Mane for using Mystical Fire when not using Covert Cloak, Mirror Armor stops pivoting Intimidate foes like Landorus-T and Incineroar from softening Corviknight's damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Pressure is a reasonable alternative for whittling down PP, which can be especially helpful against Ting-Lu's troublesome Ruination.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: When paired with Taunt, Corviknight can effectively take down Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Sitrus Berry is preferred due to the quicker burst of recovery better fitting a sweeper, but Leftovers can work very well with Pressure in an attempt to out-stall Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Maranga Berry</strong>: Maranga Berry's Special Defense boost can stop Special Attacking foes like Flutter Mane from 2HKOing physically defensive Corviknight.</p> </li> </ul>"

That being said, outspeeding Pokemon that commonly have their Speed boosted via an item, such as Flutter Mane, Gholdengo, and Iron Bundle, can lead to surprising win conditions.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Dragapult's cleaning capabilities are improved quite a bit by Terastallization, though it doesn't need to rely on it to be functional.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Boosting the power of Dragon Darts makes Dragapult very effective at shredding through Focus Sash Pokemon such as Chien-Pao, in addition to removing the annoying Sucker Punch weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel has a fantastic synergy with Dragapult's former typing, giving it a far better match-up against foes such as Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost is notable for letting Dragapult use a less risky STAB move in Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives a valuable Fairy-type resistance and is a more powerful tool against Steel-types at the cost of a Stealth Rock weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dragon-type immunity can help win Tera wars against foes like Garchomp, Great Tusk, and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting vastly improves Dragapult's match-up against Kingambit, Chi-Yu, Chien-Pao, and Choice Scarf Meowscarada.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band guarantees that Breloom is OHKOed through its Focus Sash with Dragon Darts, and gives a 75% shot to the same happening to Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb makes Sucker Punch a less risky option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Dragaoult's bulk isn't terrible, but Focus Sash will save it from the huge amount of top tier Pokemon that are capable of OHKOing it, such as Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: This may seem like overkill, but Choice Scarf gives Dragapult the edge over Booster Energy users such as Iron Bundle, Roaring Moon, and Flutter Mane, and other Choice Scarf foes such Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Dragapult's high Speed combined with Reflect and Light Screen make it an effective dual screens lead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse</strong>: Curse reduces Dragapult's HP to get it off the field quickly once it has set up screens. It also forces opponents to use recovery moves or switch out, allowing Dragapult's teammates to get in and set up safely. Curse is Dragapult’s best option to bypass Substitute, Protect, and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Ball</strong>: This breaks Focus Sash, hits Ghosts like Gholdengo and Flutter Mane that normally threaten it, and breaks Mimikyu's Disguise. Notably Gholdengo stops Curse with Good as Gold, making Dragapult totally helpless against it if it does not carry Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Darts</strong>: Dragon Darts can be used for more power to make Dragapult more self-sufficient when it has to stay on the field, and breaks Focus Sash as well. Its dual-hit nature makes it bypass most Substitutes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers. In tandem with Reflect, this can be a potent strategy to allow the next Pokemon to set up nearly risk-free.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Very Situational</strong>: As a dual screens lead, Terastallizing can compromise its teammates sweeping abilities, so it should only be done in emergencies.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost / Dragon</strong>: If you are in a bad spot, Ghost and Dragon power up its STAB move of choice.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: A defensive typing like Steel can allow Dragapult to survive certain moves like Iron Bundle's Ice Beam, boosted Cloyster's Icicle Spear, and boosted Baxcalibur's Glaive Rush and retaliate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy Tera type is useful for enemy Infiltrator Dragapult's Dragon Darts.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: While Light Clay is standard, Focus Sash nearly guarantees setting at least one screen without having to Terastallize, in the event Dragapult leads off against Choice Scarf users like Gholdengo, Hydreigon, and Meowscarada.</li> </ul>"

It can survive hits from Fairy-types like Flutter Mane as well as powerful special attackers like Iron Bundle. With an Adamant nature, Urshifu-S can reliably beat offensive Tera Fairy Flutter Mane with Wicked Blow + Sucker Punch, provided Focus Sash is still intact.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Black Glasses versus Punching Glove</strong>: Both items boost the power of Urshifu-S's signature move, Wicked Blow. Black Glasses gives a slightly stronger boost, while Punching Glove helps to protect Urshifu-S from contact effects like Rocky Helmet and Zapdos's Static. Urshifu-S is much less vulnerable to these effects compared to Urshifu-R due to lack of a multi-hit move. Finally, despite the name, Punching Glove does not boost the power of Sucker Punch, while Black Glasses does.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Typically, Urshifu-S will utilize Terastallization offensively to bolster the power of its Dark-type moves, but this set can benefit more from a defensive Tera type in order to stay on the field longer and make use of its ability to switch moves, which the Choice-locked attacker set cannot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark strengthens Wicked Blow and allows Urshifu-S to power its way through opposing walls. After a Swords Dance boost, Tera Dark-boosted Wicked Blow is a guaranteed OHKO on physically defensive Zapdos, while Close Combat has a high chance to OHKO Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: This Tera type allows Urshifu-S to survive common Fairy-type and Fighting-type attacks that would otherwise threaten to KO Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: For Focus Sash sets, Tera Ghost blocks Normal-type priority from the likes of Dragonite, Ogerpon formes, or Entei from picking Urshifu-S off.</p> </li> </ul>"

Drain Punch is usually preferred for bulkier Punching Glove sets to improve Urshifu-R's survivability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aqua Jet</strong>: Aqua Jet is perfect for picking off weakened foes that are faster than Urshifu-R, such as Chien-Pao and Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: With Swords Dance, Urshifu-R becomes far more difficult to wall by its defensive checks, though Dondozo is a notable exception.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner versus Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Spinner is more powerful when not using Punching Glove, and it also ruins terrain set up from the likes of Miraidon and Rillaboom. Ice Punch should always be used with Punching Glove, as it prevents Rocky Helmets users like Dragonite from passively wearing Urshifu-R down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute with Punching Glove let's Urshifu-R take advantage of Alomomola that try to wear down Urshifu-R with Rocky Helmet, and is also effective at foiling slower status users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is the preferred nature for giving Urshifu-R as much breaking power as possible. Maximizing Speed with Jolly is often not needed for most matchups, but it does surpass some key targets in Jolly Mimikyu, Jolly Gliscor, and Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Bulk Up</strong>: Bulk Up takes advantage of Urshifu-R's underrated physical bulk, but it's far less consistent against powerful special attackers like Miraidon and Calyrex-S.</li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: Punching Gloves protects Urshifu-R from taking devastating damage by hitting Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin with Surging Strikes, in addition to boosting other punching moves. Just note that these moves will now be blocked by Protect and other variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: While it might seem strange with Urshifu-R's good physical bulk, Focus Sash lets it survive extremely powerful physical moves such as Chien-Pao's Electric Tera Blast without investing in bulk, as well as letting it survive powerful special attackers from Flutter Mane, Miraidon, and Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protective Pads</strong>: Protective Pads are a niche alternative to Punching Glove, not boosting any attacks but letting Surging Strikes bypass Protective moves from foes like Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Urshifu-R is able to function perfectly fine without Terastallization, though it has both offensive and defensive uses for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Tera Water boost to Surging Strikes makes Urshifu-R even more difficult to wall, with even Ting-Lu that lack Sitrus Berry being OHKOed by +2 Surging Strikes. It also makes Aqua Jet a more effective cleaning move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal is often paired with Punching Glove to block Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S, potentially letting it get off a devastating Surging Strikes against it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar with Adamant is notable not only for taking advantage of Urshifu-R's great offensive coverage, but also because Tera Stellar Close Combat into Tera Stellar Aqua Jet will OHKO offensive Miraidon variants.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternate EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>108 HP / 252 Atk / 148 Def with Adamant</strong>: Not only does this EV spread maintain maximum power, but the physical bulk let's Urshifu-R survive Adamant Chien-Pao's super-effective Tera Blast 87.5% of the time.</li> </ul>"

That being said, with high Speed and priority attacks being so prevalent in the current climate, Aqua Jet can still find a place on Choice Scarf sets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Urshifu-R greatly appreciates having a move that prevents it from being walled by Dragonite, and it can also foil terrain-based strategies from Miraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf versus Choice Band</strong>: Choice Scarf transforms Urshifu-R into an effective revenge killer, outspeeding important threats such as Chien-Pao, unboosted Miraidon, and Flutter Mane that lack Booster Energy. Choice Band, on the other hand, makes Urshifu-R a far more effective wallbreaker, letting it deal massive damage to foes like Ting-Lu, Scizor, Ho-oh, and Calyrex-I.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant is far and away the preferred option for getting the most damage out of each attack.

With Choice Scarf, Urshifu-R can OHKO Focus Sash Chien-Pao before it has a chance to attack. With Choice Band, Surging Strikes becomes practically unwallable by anything that doesn't resist it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal with Choice Band can blindside offensive Calyrex-S that attack with Astral Barrage, letting Urshifu-R handily dispatch it with Surging Strikes.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternate EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>108 HP / 252 Atk / 148 Def with Adamant</strong>: When using Choice Band Urshifu, this spread's physical bulk can be worth it against Tera Blast Electric from Chien-Pao, surviving 87.5% of the time.</li> </ul>"

It deals significant damage even when uninvested and slams Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: This combination helps get the most out of Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery while burning as many turns as possible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes Support</strong>: This set benefits immensely from Toxic Spikes, which allows Calyrex-I to stall for damage when Leech Seed isn't active. Clodsire is the most common partner utilized for this, as its high special bulk is a great compliment to Calyrex-I's physical bulk.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: In order to take full advantage of its bulk against threats like Koraidon, Calyrex-I will need Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water's Fire-type resistance makes shouldering Koraidon's Flare Blitz a breeze, and the Water-type resistance to Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes makes Substitute a lot more effective.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong> Tera Fire is another good way to weaken Koraidon's Flare Blitz while simultaneously making it much harder for Ogerpon-H to check Calyrex-I.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>15 or lower Speed IV or 20 Speed EVs</strong>: While optional, a low enough Speed IV makes it so that slow Alomomola's Flip Turn will always go first, letting Calyrex-I hit the incoming target with Leech Seed instead. Do note that this will also make Calyrex-I slower than Ting-Lu. On the other hand, Calyrex-I can outrun uninvested Ursaluna-B with only 20 Speed EVs, though more may be necessary because Ursaluna-B commonly bumps up its Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 212 Def / 44 SpD with Impish</strong>: With just a small amount of Special Defense investment, Astral Barrage from Timid Calyrex-S only has around a 50% chance to 2HKO if Calyrex-I is Terastallized. This spread also avoids an OHKO from Timid Choice Specs Miraidon's Electro Drift on all but the highest damage roll.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 124 Def / 132 SpD with Impish</strong>: While it sacrifices some physical bulk, a higher Special Defense investment combined with Terastallization makes it so that Astral Barrage from Timid Calyrex-S almost never 2HKOes.</p> </li> </ul>"

High Horsepower also has decent type synergy with Glacial Lance and doesn't immediately require Terastallization, but Unaware Dondozo becomes almost impossible to break.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: Swords Dance can be used to supercharge a Trick Room sweep, making Calyrex-I much harder to stall out.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: While Encore is difficult to fit, the unique pairing of Encore with Trick Room allows Calyrex-I punish a wide range of status users that it couldn't before.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icicle Spear and Bullet Seed with Loaded Dice</strong>: Calyrex-I does have the option to run a Loaded Dice offensive set that is less reliant on Terastallization. While good against Focus Sash and Substitute users, it tends to constrict Calyrex-I's overall power.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Since Trick Room restricts the range of coverage Calyrex-I can run, Terastallization is key in extending Calyrex-I's offense while also removing its common weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric is the go-to option for good defensive typing and Tera Blast coverage, giving Calyrex-I the coveted BoltBeam attack type combination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground can be used with High Horsepower to give it a sizable boost in strength as well as buying extra turns against Miraidon's Electric-type attacks.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>0 Speed IV with a Brave nature</strong>: Calyrex-I usually wants the lowest Speed possible for sweeping in Trick Room. This will make it slower than Ting-Lu and Dondozo though, so adjustments can be made if outrunning these targets out of Trick Room is deemed necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 212 Atk / 44 SpD with Brave or Adamant</strong>: The Special Defense investment allows Calyrex-I to almost always survive Timid Choice Specs Miraidon's Electro Drift. If Terastallized, it also has roughly a 50% chance to avoid the 2HKO from Timid Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 124 Atk / 132 SpD with Brave or Adamant</strong>: By leaning into Special Defense and using Terastallization, Timid Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage won't 2HKO Calyrex-I except on the highest damage rolls.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With absurd offensive stats and an ability that takes that further, Calyrex-S is the king of sweeping in Battle Stadium Singles!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draining Kiss</strong>: Despite the low Base Power, Draining Kiss deals plenty of damage to Dark-types like Chien-Pao, especially if using Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock versus Psychic</strong>: Psyshock is preferred for the massive damage potential against Blissey, but Psychic will OHKO Koraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Calyrex-S is able to outspeed any relevant foe without a Choice Scarf, making Encore an especially dangerous option even if it comes at the cost of a Psychic-type STAB move or setup option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Nasty Plot versus Calm Mind</strong>: Nasty Plot Calyrex-S is nearly impossible to wall, making it an especially deadly option with Focus Sash. While not as immediately dangerous for sweeping, Calm Mind lets Calyrex-S set up more easily without a Focus Sash with some minor EV tweaking.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Expanding Force</strong>: If using Calyrex-S on a Psychic Terrain team with Indeedee-M, Expanding Force is much more powerful than other Psychic-type options. However, this does come with the risk of Miraidon or Rillaboom weakening Expanding Force with their own Terrain.</li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Despite Calyrex-S's reasonable bulk, Focus Sash is an excellent item for reducing the pressure for it to Terastallize, in addition to potentially revenge killing powerful adversaries like Choice Scarf Koraidon and Booster Energy Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb makes Calyrex-S less reliant on boosts to clean teams, at the cost of being more vulnerable to priority from the likes of Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: If using Calm Mind, Leftovers is a reasonable option for increased longevity, especially if it is getting free turns with Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry severely punishes bulky users of Yawn such as Ursaluna-B and Hippowdon, as well as stopping Booster Energy Flutter Mane from hitting Tera Fairy Calyrex-S with Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spell Tag</strong>: While mostly outclassed by Life Orb, Spell Tag makes sense if another teammate needs Life Orb more.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternate EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>20 HP / 4 Def / 220 SpA / 12 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread is to be used with Calm Mind, allowing Calyrex-S to withstand Timid Choice Specs Miraidon's Electro Drift after a boost.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency: Medium / Low</strong>: Calyrex-S's typing makes it extremely vulnerable to Sucker Punch from the likes of Chien-Pao and faster Ghost-type attacks from foes like Booster Energy Flutter Mane, making Terastallization a gateway into opening up sweeps. However, if using Focus Sash, this becomes less important.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy Calyrex-S's crown jewel for Tera types, giving it a key resistance to Dark, as well as turning Draining Kiss into a reasonable secondary armament.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a good alternative to Tera Fairy because it offers similar advantages against Dark-types with the bonus of dealing massive damage to Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu with Tera Blast, as well as not being weak to Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While a more niche Tera type due to its lack of offensive benefits, Tera Normal can be paired with Encore to ambush Ghost-type revenge killers like Flutter Mane and opposing Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost makes Astral Barrage into a terrifying sweeping move, but the lack of any defensive benefits makes it a niche option, especially when not using Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>As One combines with a Choice item to either turn Calyrex-S into a revenge killer or potent cleaner.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psyshock versus Psychic</strong>: Psyshock is usually the best option for a secondary STAB move, since it allows even Choice Scarf Calyrex-S to usually 2HKO Blissey, a problem for Calyrex-S on stall teams otherwise. Psychic is much stronger against Koraidon though, with Choice Scarf sets being able to OHKO offensive Koraidon that aren't Terastallized with it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draining Kiss versus Tera Blast</strong>: Despite its low Base Power, Draining Kiss is still enough to cleave through Chien-Pao and restores a good amount of HP when using Tera Fairy. However, Tera Blast's higher Base Power makes it a reasonable alternative for this set, with Tera Blast Fairy letting Choice Scarf Calyrex-S 2HKO Chi-Yu in particular.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trick</strong>: Trick is an effective way of punishing Calyrex-S's more defensive checks, with Ting-Lu in particular loathing it. Just note that most Blissey can get around Trick by using Fling, so this is not entirely reliable against stall teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf versus Choice Specs</strong>: Calyrex-S's insane Speed might make Choice Scarf seem like overkill, but gaining the ability to outspeed Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon, as well as Speed-boosted Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, is an extremely rare and valuable quality for a Choice Scarf revenge killer. Choice Specs is still worth considering for its impressive wallbreaking power though, especially since Psyshock cleanly 2HKOes Blissey.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Future Sight</strong>: Future Sight is an interesting tool against defensive teams, as if you force out special walls with strong physical Pokemon, Calyrex-S's Future Sight is likely to deal a huge amount of damage to their response later!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Expanding Force</strong>: If using Calyrex-S on a Psychic Surge team with Indeedee-M, Expanding Force outdamages even Astral Barrage! Just note that Miraidon and Rillaboom are common enough that maintaining the boosted Expanding Force can be tricky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Nasty Plot or Calm Mind</strong>: If using Trick, it's feasible to carry a setup move over a Psychic-type STAB move, especially if certain defensive foes like Ting-Lu have been saddled with it. However, setting up still should not be the main purpose of this set, as Encore does a better job of facilitating that.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency: High</strong>: With no Encore or Focus Sash to get around this, Calyrex-S's Dark and Ghost weaknesses are highly exploitable, meaning Terastallization is often key to stopping a revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is the best crown to be wearing against Dark-types like Chien-Pao, making Draining Kiss viable as a bonus.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is an alternative to Fairy, making Calyrex-S more vulnerable to Flutter Mane in exchange for OHKOing Chi-Yu with Tera Blast. Just note that being locked into Tera Blast Fighting is a problem against other Ghost-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal is a niche option, since it provides no offensive benefit, but it can be useful for Choice Specs Calyrex-S to dodge an OHKO from Choice Scarf Calyrex-S and Flutter Mane with a Speed boost.</p> </li> </ul>"

Draining Kiss allows Calyrex-S to threaten the Dark-types that would switch into Astral Barrage, while Giga Drain threatens the likes of Ursaluna-B more immediately.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind versus Nasty Plot</strong>: Calm Mind trades out Nasty Plot's more immediate boost to give Calyrex-S more survivability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Agility</strong>: Agility lets Calyrex-S punish switches to faster threats like Choice Scarf Koraidon, Miraidon, and Booster Energy Flutter Mane by suddenly outspeeding them and threatening a sweep.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry allows Calyrex-S to set up more safely in the face of threats like Ursaluna-B, giving it a better shot at a successful sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry lets Calyrex-S set up in the face of status users like Eternatus, Dondozo, and Gliscor, allowing it more opportunities to mount a sweep against bulkier teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <p><strong>Tera Dependecy - High</strong>: Although its base typing has advantages like an immunity to Extreme Speed, Calyrex-S will often need to Terastallize to maintain its longevity and mitigate its weakness against common threats.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy grants Calyrex-S a valuable resistance to Dark-type attacks such as Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch and boosts the power of Draining Kiss, allowing it to more easily threaten foes like Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass strengthens Giga Drain's power, dealing solid damage to Ting-Lu and Ursaluna-B. It also grants Calyrex-S the benefit of resisting Miraidon’s Electro Drift and Ground-type attacks. However, it becomes more vulnerable to Ice-type moves like Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance and Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and Ice Shard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water grants a resistance to Koraidon's Flare Blitz and Scizor's Bullet Punch and can be used with Tera Blast to deal massive damage to threats like Ursaluna-B and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>172 HP / 252 Def / 60 SpA / 4 SpD / 20 Spe with Modest</strong>: With Sitrus Berry, this spread can allow Calyrex-S withstand Chien Pao’s Icicle Crash and Ice Shard. After a Calm Mind boost, it can withstand Choice Specs Miraidon’s Electro Drift, Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane’s Moonblast, and Silk Scarf Tera Normal Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon after Stealth Rock damage. 20 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Jolly Landorus-T before an Aglity boost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>124 HP / 100 Def / 252 SpA / 12 SpD / 20 Spe with Modest</strong>: Maximizing Special Attack lets Tera Grass Giga Drain 2HKO Sitrus Berry Ting-Lu after a Nasty Plot boost and OHKO maximum HP Dondozo fifty percent of the time.</p> </li> </ul>"

Kleavor being faster means it'll even outpace Dragonite's Extreme Speed!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: While Kleavor isn't known for easily sweeping, it's fast enough to outspeed Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle after Trailblaze, and Trailblaze is especially useful when using Tera Grass against Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>X-Scissor versus Close Combat</strong>: While X-Scissor's coverage on paper isn't impressive, the boost from Sharpness lets it 2HKO Cresselia and Ting-Lu that lack Sitrus Berry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: If using Feint, Adamant is the best nature choice for maximizing the amount of targets it can pick off after using Stone Axe. For Trailblaze variants, Jolly is preferred to outspeed Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and even Dragapult. Jolly also ensures it outspeeds all Gholdengo that lack Choice Scarf.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Tailwind</strong>: Tailwind is an unusual move for Battle Stadium Singles, but Kleavor's disposable nature with Focus Sash can make it justified as a move to use before fainting.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Kleavor's entry hazard setting nature may not make Terastallization seem important, but its archnemesis, Urshifu-R, makes it worth considering, since it can threaten to OHKO Kleavor through its Focus Sash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a good response against Urshifu-R, not only resisting its deadly Surging Strikes, but also boosting Trailblaze.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water isn't as offensively useful, but it's still a good way to resist both Surging Strikes and powerful Steel-type attacks like Heatran's Flash Cannon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug isn't great defensively, but it allows Kleavor to 2HKO even Impish Sitrus Berry Ting-Lu with X-Scissor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Despite Kleavor's resistance to Extreme Speed, Dragonite often picks off Focus Sash variants, so Tera Ghost is a huge shock for it, though a rather risky Terastallization choice. It also blocks Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, even if it's not particularly common.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash makes Kleavor a good lead against a wide variety of foes such as Iron Bundle and lets it easily justify the maximum Speed investment needed to outspeed Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Kleavor's special bulk is mediocre at best, but Stone Axe's entry hazard setting powers can justify using Assault Vest to survive certain attacks that are otherwise impossible without Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Assault Vest EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>28 HP / 204 Atk / 4 Def / 204 SpD / 68 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This more specially bulky spread usually survives Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Tera Fairy Moonblast, and Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash while outspeeding Garchomp after one use of Trailblaze.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>28 HP / 108 Atk / 4 Def / 204 SpD / 164 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread has enough Speed to outspeed Iron Bundle after using Trailblaze once while usually surviving Timid Tera Fairy Choice Specs Moonblast from Flutter Mane, Non-Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, and Jolly Life Orb Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 52 Atk / 4 Def / 244 SpD / 68 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This more extreme spread usually lets Kleavor survive even Timid Gholdengo's Make It Rain, almost always avoids a 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse, and avoids an OHKO from Adamant Life Orb Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash while still outspeeding Garchomp after one use of Trailblaze.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: While very rare, Cute Charm Enamorus can potentially impact Kleavor, meaning there are no drawbacks to using a female gender.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Flame Orb, Guts, and an incredible Attack stat, Ursaluna is an extremely brutal wallbreaker!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake versus Headlong Rush</strong>: Earthquake is an easier move to recommend, avoiding contact with Rocky Helmet and preserving Ursaluna's hefty bulk. However, Headlong Rush's extra power can better fit the playstyles of Ursaluna that may aim for a sweep rather than just wallbreaking, such as Trick Room and Jolly variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch versus Close Combat</strong>: Drain Punch doesn't offer much extra coverage, but it's Ursaluna's only decent way of restoring health. Close Combat's sheer power does make it decent coverage though and can particularly punish Heatran for Terastallizing into a Grass-type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch versus Play Rough</strong>: Once Ursaluna is burned, Ice Punch will deal so much damage to Dragonite that even the bulkiest sets can not restore all their health with Roost. Play Rough isn't nearly as effective against Dragonite, but when used with Tera Fairy, Ursaluna can now OHKO Urshifu-R before Flame Orb kicks in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: While Ursaluna is powerful, it needs the Flame Orb activation to truly wallbreak, so Protect can help when switching it in isn't easy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bulk Up versus Swords Dance</strong>: Bulk Up is the prefered setup move for making Ursaluna difficult to revenge kill with physical attacks, but Swords Dance does offer some truly absurd wallbreaking potential, allowing Ursaluna to OHKO even physically defensive Ting-Lu with Facade! Swords Dance can also be a better fit on Trick Room teams due to the limited amount of turns Ursaluna has to sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Trailblaze</strong>: If using Jolly Ursaluna, Trailblaze lets it outspeed key threats such as Zapdos, both Urshifu formes, Mimikyu, and even Speed tie with Timid Thundurus-T!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Ursaluna benefits from Terastallization, but it's not integral to its wallbreaking prowess.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Beyond getting rid of Ground's annoying weaknesses, Tera Normal turns Ursaluna into an even more fearsome wallbreaker,</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy does a great job of protecting Ursaluna from powerful Fighting-type attacks and Dragonite's Outrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While Tera Ghost does make the matchup against Flutter Mane and Gholdengo worse, the Fighting immunity can turn a match around in the blink of an eye.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is the prime Tera type to use when in need of an Ice and Water resistance, which is helpful against Urshifu-R and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: If using Drain Punch, Tera Fighting is a reasonable option for restoring even more health, at the cost of being rather weak against Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Gass is a niche option that lets Ursaluna deal extra damage with Trailblaze while resisting Water-type attacks and taking Spore before Flame Orb activates.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Brave and a 0 Speed IV versus Adamant</strong>: On a Trick Room team, this lets Ursaluna underspeed some major Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Dondozo. However, some Trick Room teams may still prefer Adamant to outspeed such slow Pokemon if they also function outside Trick Room.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 SpD with Adamant or Brave</strong>: This more specially defensive EV spread survives some powerful attacks even after burn damage, including Timid Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Thundurus-T's Grass Knot, Timid Greninja's Hydro Pump, and Modest Chi-Yu's Overheat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximizing Speed may seem strange on such a slow Pokemon, but Ursaluna makes fantastic use of it, making Trailblaze viable due to outspeeding even offensive variants of Zapdos after a boost and letting it wallbreak common Pokemon that often don't invest in enough Speed such as Dragonite and Heatran.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Minor Optimizations</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Female Gender</strong>: Since Ursaluna uses contact moves, a female gender will prevent it from being attracted to the rare Cute Charm Enamorus.</li> </ul>"

It's a great way to cover a switch or predicted Terastallization, but it requires some forethought to maximize efficiency because it cannot be used on consecutive turns.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vacuum Wave</strong>: Vacuum Wave is highly valuable for revenge killing foes, notably hitting Chien-Pao. It can hit Gholdengo due to Mind's Eye.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong>: Earth Power gives great coverage against the Steel-types that resist Blood Moon, making Ursaluna-B nearly unwallable except by non-grounded Steel-types like Corviknight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Voice</strong>: Hyper Voice is a more spammable Normal-type STAB move that can bypass Substitute, allowing Ursaluna-B to thwart attempts to Substitute stall out Blood Moon, like Tera Garganacl.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Assault Vest remedies Ursaluna-B's middling Special Defense, allowing this slow but hard-hitting Pokemon to survive longer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Silk Scarf</strong>: Silk Scarf can be used instead of Assault Vest to boost the power of Ursaluna-B’s Normal-type STAB attacks, making it more difficult to switch into, though this makes match-ups against Special Attackers like Flutter Mane shakier.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: If using Ursaluna-B on a Trick Room team, Life Orb can be worth the recoil for the highest possible chance of sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash may sound absurd with Ursaluna-B's bulk, but it can allow more offensive variants to turn the tables on extremely powerful Special Attackers like Choice Specs Chi-Yu, and more easily justify faster EV spreads.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Assault Vest EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>36 HP / 228 SpA / 244 SpD with Modest</strong>: This spread survives an opposing Life Orb Ursaluna-B's Tera Normal Blood Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 HP / 164 SpA / 244 SpD with Modest</strong>: This spread survives Timid Tera Water Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, even if Ursaluna-B doesn't Terastallize!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 52 Def / 196 SpA / 12 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread will never be OHKOed by Adamant Choice Scarf Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes unless it Terastallizes.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Item EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 4 Def / 132 SpA / 220 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This EV spread gives Ursaluna-B enough bulk to survive Tera boosted Choice Specs Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast on all but the highest damage roll, as well as the same odds for surviving Jolly Urshifu-R's Close Combat. If used with paralysis support, 32 EVs can be moved from Special Attack to Speed to outspeed paralyzed Modest Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>20 HP / 4 Def / 172 SpA / 60 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong> This outspeeds up to -1 Speed Garchomp, and also often outspeeds Pokemon that focus on bulk such as Dragonite, Scizor, and Primarina. The defensive EVs survive Choice Specs Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast and Life Orb Adamant Chien-Pao's Sacred Sword if Ursaluna-B sticks with Tera Normal.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Ursaluna-B often uses Terastallization to compensate for its lackluster defensive typing; however, it is often capable of functioning without Tera. Because many different Tera types are viable on it, it can play guessing games with opponents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal removes all weaknesses associated with Ursaluna-B’s Ground typing and boosts Blood Moon to phenomenal levels of power, making it ideal on Trick Room teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy allows Ursaluna-B to handle the Urshifu formes and Choice Band Dragon-types like Dragonite and Gouging Fire better while generally being a very solid defensive Tera type.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison improves Ursaluna-B’s matchup against Flutter Mane, all Ogerpon formes' Horn Leech, and all Urshifu formes, while preventing Toxic from wearing Ursaluna-B down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water allows Ursaluna-B to fare better against the likes of Urshifu-R, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Hibernation (Yawn)": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Yawn doesn't transform Ursaluna-B into just a mere support Pokemon. When used in conjunction with Blood Moon, the bloodmoon beast becomes a master of putting offensive teams between a rock and a hard place: either the opponent's check falls asleep, or they switch out and something far less suited against Ursaluna-B gets shredded by Blood Moon!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Moonlight</strong>: Moonlight will require sacrificing either coverage or priority, but it makes Ursaluna-B far longer lasting and less vulnerable to lures like Grass Knot Landorus-T. It's a particularly strong choice on teams with strong hit-and-run Pokemon like Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vacuum Wave</strong>: While not amazingly powerful, Vacuum Wave is lovely for picking off Chien-Pao and cleaning up late-game in general. This is to the point where giving up reliable recovery can make sense for some more offensive teams that often can't afford to switch Ursaluna-B out often.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Leftovers is best paired with Moonlight, giving Ursaluna-B maximum longevity. If using Vacuum Wave, Sitrus Berry's quicker burst of recovery suits Ursaluna-B better and provides a better matchup against Urshifu-R. Sitrus Berry is also a reasonable alternative to Leftovers if another teammate needs it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The HP investment ensures Annihilape will not OHKO Ursaluna-B with Final Gambit, and the Defense EVs stop Choice Band Tera Water Urshifu-R from OHKOing Terastallized Ursaluna-B. This spread survives Modest Choice Scarf Chi-Yu's Overheat and Tera-boosted Moonblast from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane on all but the highest damage roll. Offensively, the Special Attack EVs ensure that Blood Moon OHKOes offensive Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>20 Speed EVs</strong>: 20 Speed EVs let Ursaluna-B outspeed paralyzed Adamant Urshifu formes at the cost of some bulk. This may seem to conflict with Yawn, but paralysis is often a viable secondary playstyle for teams with this set to deal with more offensive threats.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Ursaluna-B's typing is fairly good, but its weakness to common threats like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-R mean Terastallization is often needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison has excellent synergy with Ursaluna-B's playstyle, not only granting it an important resistance to Urshifu-R's Close Combat and Flutter Mane's Moonblast but also ensuring that poison status will not wear it down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy doesn't help against Flutter Mane, but it does transform Ursaluna-B into a very strong Urshifu-S check, in addition to avoiding Choice Specs Latios's wrath.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal only helps defensively against Ice, Grass, and Water types, but the power boost to Blood Moon makes Ursaluna-B far more difficult to wall, with defensive Primarina in particular usually being put into Earth Power's KO range.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water offers a useful Ice resistance to flip Chien-Pao matchups more easily, but it doesn't help against Raging Bolt and Grass Knot users like Landorus-T.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Smarter than the Average Bear (Calm Mind)": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its immense defensive profile and access to reliable recovery, Ursaluna-B lends itself very well to a Calm Mind set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Blood Moon</strong>: Even though the cool down time can be annoying for a Calm Mind set, the massive amount of power is still strongly recommended for being able to OHKO Urshifu-R without a boost using the given EV spread.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt can be used to shut down utility moves and attempts to stall out Ursaluna-B from the likes of Cresselia and slow Dragonite.</li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus berry allows Ursaluna-B to recover a significant chunk of health, which can be useful to set up boosts against special attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers improves Ursaluna-B's general longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Kee Berry</strong>: Kee Berry boosts Ursaluna-B's physical bulk, allowing it to keep pace with physical threats such as Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Despite its immense bulk, Ursaluna-B’s typing leaves it vulnerable to many common attacks, so a good defensive Tera type is essential for survivability and durability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy provides a good defensive typing that synergizes well with Ursaluna-B's natural weaknesses, allowing it to stick around.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison grants an immunity to Toxic, Making Toxic Spikes less of an issue. It also grants a Fighting resistance, allowing it to better handle Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal boosts the power of Blood Moon, which improves the matchup against opposing Calm Mind Flutter Mane. It leaves only a Fighting weakness, making Ursaluna-B quite hard to KO.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water aids against both Chien-Pao and Choice Specs Gholdengo, in addition to being a great defensive typing in general.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Ancient Defense (Physical Wall)": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Backed by Terastallization, Ursaluna-B can use its incredible physical bulk to wall even the mighty Koraidon!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Moonlight</strong>: Under Koraidon's sun, Moonlight's increased recovery makes Ursaluna-B that much harder to topple!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong>: Earth Power is strong against Steel-types like Scizor and Archaludon that otherwise resist Blood Moon, and it's also super effective against many of Koraidon's most popular Tera types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hyper Voice</strong>: While it doesn't provide extra coverage, Hyper Voice is the best option to prevent Substitute Gliscor from completely shutting down Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vacuum Wave</strong>: Vacuum Wave is a solid option for picking off weakened threats, especially Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: Weaker physical attackers like Assault Vest Koraidon provide great opportunities to set up with Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: With full defensive investment and a neutral Tera type, a five-hit Scale Shot from +2 Koraidon only has about a 25% chance to OHKO. Even without Terastallization, this Ursaluna-B is so bulky that Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash into Ice Shard only has about a 6.25% chance to knock out Ursaluna-B! The leftover EVs are usually allocated to Speed; keep in mind that Ursaluna-B often Speed creeps, so reallocating some EVs for even a few more points in Speed can be useful in the mirror matchup.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet punishes many common attacks from Koraidon and Zacian-C, though Scale Shot from Koraidon is a notable exception.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry's burst recovery can be useful against Swords Dance Koraidon, guaranteeing that Ursaluna-B survives a +2 Scale Shot at five hits even if one of the hits is a critical hit.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Ursaluna-B has to change its typing in order to properly take on Koraidon and other physical threats it targets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire deters Koraidon from spamming its destructive Tera Fire Flare Blitz while remaining neutral against its powerful STAB attacks. Beyond that, it helps Ursaluna-B wall a litany of other physical threats like Calyrex-I, Zacian-C that lack an appropriate Tera Blast, Ogerpon-H, and Assault Vest Rillaboom. The Fairy-type resistance is also excellent against Flutter Mane, a common Koraidon teammate.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Compared to Tera Fire, Tera Water is an alternative for resisting Koraidon's Flare Blitz that doesn't sacrifice Ground-type matchups like Landorus-T. It also helps Ursaluna-B against Urshifu-R when used against other types of teams. But without Tera Fire's Fairy-type resistance, Flutter Mane becomes harder to withstand if Ursaluna-B is not running Calm Mind, and Grass-types such as Ogerpon and Rillaboom will be much more threatening.</p> </li> </ul>"

When it's the last Pokemon standing, this vengeful attack will 2HKO almost anything that doesn't resist it at minimum, with the big exceptions being defensive Dragonite if Multiscale is intact and Dondozo if not using Life Orb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Endure and Custap Berry</strong>: Endure can be used to put Basculegion into Custap Berry's activation range against many powerful attacks, letting it fire off Last Respects on the top of its priority bracket. This can be a devastating surprise late-game, turning what could be a sure loss into new avenues to sweep!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flip Turn</strong>: Adaptability turns Flip Turn into a powerful pivoting move, giving Basculegion more utility early-game.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Fangs</strong>: While hitting Urshifu-R extra hard isn't a bad deal, the real use for Psychic Fangs is to get rid of dual screens that would otherwise stop Basculegion from sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mold Breaker</strong>: Mold Breaker can be tempting for cleaving through Multiscale Dragonite, offensive Sturdy Archaludon, and the occasional Mimikyu with Last Respects, but Dragonite's habit of using Tera Normal and the big overall damage reduction makes it a rather niche option, especially since Mold Breaker announces its presence, removing any sort of surprise value.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb may compromise Basculegion's decent bulk, but it turns the fish into an absolute scourge against bulky Pokemon, with Last Respects now 2HKOing Dondozo at its maximum power and Tera Ghost even potentially 2HKOing defensive Dragonite through Mulitscale if it lacks Leftovers!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: When used with specialized EV spreads, Basculegion can send common revenge killers like Flutter Mane and Gholdengo to an early grave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Even with Wave Crash's recoil, Focus Sash is good for winning unexpected matchups against threats like Chi-Yu and Chien-Pao, though note that this item benefits best from a more specialized set.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>General EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>28 HP / 252 Atk / 228 Def with Adamant</strong>: This physically bulky EV spread survives Adamant Ogerpon-H's Horn Leech on all but the highest damage roll and does the same for Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon. It also always dodges a 2HKO from Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes, usually survives +1 Jolly Dragonite's Scale Shot at five hits, and survives Jolly Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Def with Adamant</strong>: This spread always survives Adamant Ogerpon-H's Horn Leech but now has around a 19% chance of being OHKOed by Modest Ursaluna-B's Bloodmoon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe with Adamant</strong>: While maximizing Speed makes Basculegion notably frail, it does outspeed some otherwise troublesome foes like Modest Raging Bolt, although it needs to watch out for Thunderclap, and the rare but deadly Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brave Nature</strong> Reducing Basculegion's Speed can give it an edge in mirror matches when used on Trick Room teams with setters like Porygon2 and Mimikyu, but note that going as far as using a Speed IV of 0 can harm Basculegion's matchups against normally slower foes like Scizor, Primarina, and Corviknight, so using a Speed IV of 31 is the most flexible option.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Assault Vest EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 Atk / 172 Def / 68 SpD / 12 Spe</strong>: This bulky spread avoids an OHKO from Jolly Ogerpon-H's Horn Leech, survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball, and outspeeds paralyzed Adamant Dragonite even after one Dragon Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>212 Atk / 244 Def / 52 SpD</strong>: This spread survives all but the highest damage from Adamant Ogerpon-H's Horn Leech and Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball at the cost of some Attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 Atk / 68 SpD / 196 Spe</strong>: This avoids an OHKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball while still outspeeding Adamant Breloom.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is a more double-edged sword than usual due to Adaptability, which only gives its damage bonus if Basculegion's current typing matches the attack. Because of this, while Terastallizing makes sense for Basculegion, it will lower the power of at least some of its attacks!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy trades Basculegion's wallbreaking power for a defense against Dark-types. With Tera Blast, this can even stop Urshifu-S!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water makes Aqua Jet into a potent late-game cleaning tool and lets Basculegion survive most Choice Specs Flutter Mane attacks as a bonus, with the exception of rare variants with Thunderbolt or Tera Blast Stellar.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost transforms Last Respects into a truly outrageous wallbreaking attack when Basculegion is the last fish swimming, with even Dondozo taking over 50% from it!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a more niche option against Dark-types, leaving Basculegion vulnerable to Fairy-type attacks in exchange for a stronger matchup against Archaludon and Urshifu-S via Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Don't Use Tera Stellar!</strong>: Basculegion may seem like a perfect candidate for Tera Stellar, but don't be fooled: Adaptability has no interactions with the Stellar-type, making it completely useless unless using the niche Mold Breaker!</p> </li> </ul>"

If Life Orb is needed elsewhere, Focus Sash can be a reasonable shift in focus, making Basculegion easier to use outside of rain, which makes benching Pelipper for some matchups easier to justify.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Liquidation or Waterfall</strong>: Wave Crash's constant recoil wears Basculegion down quickly, so Liquidation saves Bascluegion's scales if a foe is already in its KO range. Waterfall is a tad weaker, but the 20% chance to flinch can lead to huge upsets in a battle!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rain Dance</strong>: Setting up Rain Dance usually shouldn't be a job for Basculegion, but it does severely punish Torkoal's attempt to change weather.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Basculegion can function without Terastalliztion, its often the star sweeper of rain teams, making it a likely choice to Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water boosts Wave Crash to truly obscene power, with offensive Roaring Moon in particular being OHKOed 75% of the time by Adamant Wave Crash!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy not only saves Basculegion from Sucker Punch foes like Chien-Pao and Urshifu-S, but it also shreds Roaring Moon if it doesn't Terastallize with Tera Blast Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar is a flexible method for sweeping, with the one-time boost to Last Respects reaping Urshifu-R's soul when Basculegion is the lone teammate alive!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While it doesn't have amazing synergy with rain, Tera Ghost still boosts Last Respects into a ghoulish wallbreaking tool regardless of the weather, being particularly useful against Urshifu-R, defensive Primarina, and Dondozo</p> </li> </ul>"

Life Orb can pull off sweeps with less damage though and is a reasonable alternative if another teammate already has Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Terastallization guaranteeing that at least one of Basculegion's STAB attacks gets a downgrade is a bummer, but this set focuses so heavily on late-game sweeping that it's likely to go that route regardless.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Even though Tera Ghost doesn't offer much defensive benefit, boosting Last Respects is often a key ingredient for sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Basculegion more flexibility in sweeping without the lives of its teammates being over, though Last Respects can become a disappointing cleaning tool later in the match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy provides insurance against Sucker Punch throwers like Urshifu-S and Chien-Pao, but both STAB attacks receiving a power downgrade is a big problem. If doing this, seriously consider Tera Blast to rip Dark-types to shreds.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Don't Use Tera Stellar!</strong>: Tera Stellar is a siren song, having no impact on Basculegion's power at all due to Adaptability's mechanics.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With its good Speed tier and access to Unburden, Sneasler is one of the most potent cleaners in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dire Claw</strong>: Dire Claw is Sneasler's preferred Poison STAB move due to its highly disruptive secondary effects, making it a very difficult move to switch into, even for Pokemon that wall it like Dondozo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: While it can be difficult to fit and somewhat risky to go for, Swords Dance allows Sneasler to increase its damage output and clean through teams more reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Claw</strong>: Shadow Claw is an option to allow Sneasler to better handle otherwise problematic foes, such as Gholdengo. It's also a guaranteed OHKO vs. Calyrex-S that have not Terastallized.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acrobatics</strong> - Acrobatics is a natural pairing with Unburden, providing a massively powerful Flying-type attack once Sneasler's item is used.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fake Out</strong>: With a Normal Gem, Fake Out offers both good chip damage and the ability to safely activate Unburden.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: While it requires sacrificing a STAB attack or coverage move, Substitute helps Sneasler set up on threats such as Thunder Wave Porygon2 and Salt Cure Garganacl, as well as scout for surprise Terastallizations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Throat Chop</strong>: A slightly more powerful alternative to Shadow Claw, especially when used with a Dark Tera Type. However, it's more vulnerable to Calyrex-S Terastallizing into a Fairy-type.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / High</strong>: While Sneasler's offensive prowess is naturally strong, its average bulk and unique typing can cause serious matchup issues. Terastallization is excellent for patching up both.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gives Sneasler an immunity to Ground-type attacks, allowing it to set up on foes such as Landorus while also boosting the power of Acrobatics even further. If using terrain support, however, be warned that any benefit besides Seed activation will be lost.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost grants Sneasler an immunity to Extreme Speed, notably allowing it to more consistently beat Dragonite. It does make Sneasler weak to Sucker Punch, but this weakness can be counteracted if using Psychic Terrain support.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: When used alongside Tera Blast, Tera Ice allows Sneasler to more reliably beat foes like Landorus-T and Dragonite, and deal massive damage to common Dragon-types such as Koraidon and Miraidon.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Electric Seed</strong>: Electric Seed allows for instant Unburden activation when paired with Miraidon. Keep in mind that Dire Claw will not put grounded foes to sleep while Electric Terrain is active.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Seed</strong>: When running Sneasler with Indeedee-M's Psychic Surge support, Psychic Seed allows for instant Unburden activation. The Special Defense Boost also helps against heavy hitters like Flutter Mane and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal Gem</strong>: When combined with Fake Out, Sneasler can activate Unburden efficiently and without extra support.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grassy Seed</strong>: Grassy Seed allows for instant Unburden activation when paired with Rillaboom. The Defense Boost and halved damage from Earthquake especially helps against Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>White Herb</strong>: While less easily activated, not relying on a specific move to activate Unburden allows Sneasler to diversify its move selection more, becoming more of a threat.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>36 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 212 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread will outspeed up to Timid Choice Scarf Calyrex-S upon activating Unburden, while maximizing attack.

Running a Jolly nature will let Sneasler outspeed up to Jolly Roaring Moon.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Fire Punch</strong>: Fire Punch can OHKO maximum HP Scizor, which can otherwise bypass Focus Sash with Technician Dual Wingbeat.</li> </ul> <h4>Abilities</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Poison Touch</strong>: Poison Touch gives Sneasler extra chances to cripple threats, especially when paired with Fake Out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Unburden</strong>: If wanting to maximize your chances of paralyzing or putting a target to sleep with Dire Claw, Unburden should be used over Poison Touch. The extra Speed can also be helpful for turning the tables on speedy foes like Calyrex-S and Miraidon, but Sneasler's Focus Sash is not always in danger of being consumed against more passive Pokemon such as Alomomola.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While there are unique cases where Terastallization is useful, this set tends to do just fine without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost can surprise Extreme Speed Dragonite trying to revenge kill Sneasler, and the boost to Shadow Claw is a big help against Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting takes Sneasler's strongest STAB attack in Close Combat and pushes it even farther.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar is a great way to take advantage of Sneasler's diverse offensive options without losing its unique typing. With an Adamant nature, the one-time boost to Shadow Claw guarantees a 2HKO on maximum HP Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a situational option that gives Dire Claw a much-needed boost, and maintaining Sneasler's original Poison typing will let it absorb Toxic Spikes later if needed.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also has the bonus of Protean letting Meowscarada resist Fighting-type attacks after using it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Triple Axel</strong>: Triple Axel may not be the most reliable move out there, but it strikes fear into the heart of Dragonite and offensive Mimikyu, who can both be big offensive issues for Meowscarda.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly versus Adamant</strong>: Jolly is usually preferred for for the speed tie in mirror matches, but Adamant 's extra power can be justified on Choice Scarf since it still outspeeds boosted Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band versus Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Band boosted Meowscarada hits incredibly hard, and with its naturally high Speed it can serve as a cleaner and a potential wallbreaker, especially against common Defense-boosting foes such as Bulk Up Annihilape and Tera Fairy Archaludon. With the Speed offered via Choice Scarf, Meowscarada can threaten otherwise faster foes, such as Dragapult and +1 Garchomp, potentially putting more pressure on offensive teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protean versus Overgrow</strong>: Protean’s type-shifting allows Meowscarada to make the most of its colorful movepool, particularly on Choice-locked sets, where the limitation to only changing types once is effectively nullified. If you intend to make use of a Tera type other than Grass or Stellar, Overgrow is worth considering, as it allows Meowscarada more flexibility with its moves by not changing type and removing STAB from Flower Trick or Knock Off.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Play Rough</strong>: Compared to Triple Axel, Play Rough isn't nearly as good at handling Dragon-types besides Hydreigon, but it does stop Terastallized Dragonite, Garchomp, and Baxcalibur from grabbing a Speed boost with Scale Shot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch</strong>: Sucker Punch is a strong priority attack, but it can be rather risky with a Choice item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Brick Break</strong>: Low Kick's superior damage output against Ursaluna-B usually makes it the better Fighting-type coverage, but with Choice Band, Brick Break still OHKOes Kingambit and breaks Alolan Ninetales's Aurora Veil.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Terastallization overriding Protean means Meowscarada should usually only Terastallize to clean a weakened team late-game.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: While Terastallizing does override Protean, Tera Grass Meowscarada can be used to power through teams ill-prepared for it. Dual screens teams in particular are especially vulnerable to the sheer power of Choice Band-boosted Tera Grass Flower Trick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosted Knock Off isn't as reliable at sweeping as Flower Trick, but it can surprise bulky Steel-types such as Scizor and Archaludon, as well as deal incredible damage to bulky Volcarona.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost is a defensive option to stop Dragonite's Extreme Speed from revenge killing Meowscarada.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar's one-time boost per attack can give Meowscarada more flexible cleaning options. If Meowscarada Terastallizes after using Protean, the type it currently is will get the double base power boost, which can lead to unexpectedly powerful coverage moves!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives Meowscarada a Will-O-Wisp immunity and Fire resistance to combat bulky Volcarona.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternate EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>76 HP / 228 Atk / 108 Def / 4 SpD / 92 Speed with Jolly</strong>: This bulkier Choice Scarf spread allows Meowscarada to outspeed Jolly Garchomp while avoiding an OHKO from Breloom's Mach Punch and Choice Band Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</li> </ul> <h4>Minor Optimizations</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Neutral Natures and Trick</strong>: Make sure to use a neutral nature and use a Jolly or Adamant Mint on Meowscarada, so it won't get confused by eating any Berry after Trick.</li> </ul>"

It should be noted that Tera Water tends to be a safer option versus the common Gholdengo, as it does not often run Thunderbolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While Tera Normal isn't fantastic defensively, it lets Skeledirge severely punish attempts from special attacking Ghost-types such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo to check it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: A Dragon Tera type let's Skeledirge check Urshifu-R and Ogerpon-H simultaneously, though it will likely need help from teammates covering its newfound Fairy-type weakness.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Sitrus Berry</strong>: Residual recovery helps Skeledirge use Torch Song more freely. Leftovers is the best option since Skeledirge has instant recovery, but Sitrus Berry with an even HP stat can be used to restore some health after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ability Shield</strong>: Ability Shield keeps Unaware active in the face of Mold Breaker users like Swords Dance Ogerpon-H, which can overwhelm Skeledirge with enough boosts.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak ignores the secondary effects of Garganacl's Salt Cure as well as stopping stat drops from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball and Ogerpon-H's Rock Tomb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: This makes Skeledirge less pressured to Terastallize to rid itself of its Stealth Rock weakness.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a superb special stat line, Seed Sower, and good moveset coverage, Arboliva can be a deceptively strong and long-living Assault Vest user!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Seed Sower</strong>: Once activated, Grassy Terrain’s passive recovery and boosting of Grass-type attacks like Giga Drain can help Arboliva survive longer than expected. Grassy Terrain also halving Earthquake’s power is greatly appreciated by bulky teammates like Skeledirge, Arcanine, and Iron Hands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: This move keeps Arboliva from becoming setup bait against foes like offensive Dragonite, and is also your best move into Wo-Chien before Tera.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast is a great option for hitting types that Arboliva lacks natural coverage for. Tera Fire lets Arboliva hit Steel-types like Scizor and Tera Electric punishes Tera Flying users like Gholdengo. Both Tera Fire and Tera Electric cover Corviknight as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: This set’s massive special bulk can make getting one-shots with Mirror Coat awkward, but it is still a great option, particularly against boosted or super effective hits. Bear in mind though that this won’t work against Chi-Yu as long as it keeps its Dark typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leaf Storm</strong>: Leaf Storm trades consistency for a single turn of high burst damage and can be worth it if investing in Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Arboliva’s raw special stats make it capable of tanking super effective hits without using Tera. Nonetheless, Tera is still a strong tool to extend Arboliva’s uptime and contest matchups that would otherwise capitalize on its mediocre defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire can flip matchups against Focus Sash Chien-Pao and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu when healthy. If running Tera Blast, it also gives Arboliva the opportunity to contest Steel-types more effectively. Be aware, though, that this significantly worsens other key matchups, like Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a solid defensive option, especially into Toxic abusers like Toxapex and Clodsire. Notably, it flips several weaknesses, blocks Toxic, and allows for absorbing Toxic Spikes later in the match.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric is Gholdengo's worst nightmare. It gives a resistance to Make It Rain, blocks Thunder Wave from defensive sets, and punishes Tera Flying usage that is meant to get around Earth Power. On top of that, Arboliva still hits Corviknight very hard.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is another great defensive option for neutralizing most of Arboliva's weaknesses, and the extra power behind Dazzling Gleam can make it easier to break defensive Dragonite variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass removes Arboliva’s Fighting weakness while maintaining Spore immunity, letting it check Breloom. If both Tera and Grassy Terrain are active, Modest Giga Drain can even 2HKO Breloom!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: While not as strong defensively, invested Tera Earth Power can OHKO uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 140 SpA / 124 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread balances bulk and power, avoiding the 2HKO from Choice Specs Gholdengo's Make It Rain and almost always surviving Modest Chi-Yu’s Fire Blast before Tera! If running Tera Ground, there are enough Special Attack EV’s to turn Earth Power into an OHKO against uninvested Chi-Yu and Gholdengo. The Speed EV's Speed tie with 4 Speed Gastrodon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 SpA / 20 SpD with Modest</strong>: This simple spread still provides plenty of bulk while maximizing Special Attack, working nicely with Leaf Storm and Tera Types that boost Arboliva's coverage moves. If Grassy Terrain is present, fully invested Leaf Storm has a 75% chance of OHKOing 4 Special Defense Garchomp. The bulk investment lets Arboliva always avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Mystical Fire after Grassy Terrain recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 20 SpD / 252 Spe with Modest</strong>: While maximum Speed investment may seem a bit strange, it can be worth it when running Tera Fire Tera Blast to get the jump on Scizor, Corviknight and the rare Timid Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 4 Def / 148 SpA / 20 SpD / 100 Spe with Modest</strong>: This alternative Speed spread gives Arboliva a nice boost in Special Attack while still letting it outrun 4 Speed Azumarill. This is usually more than enough Speed to outrun Ting-Lu as well.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With some entry hazard support, this Garganacl can be very difficult to outstall, thanks to the constant passive damage from Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Not only does Protect scout for surprise Tera types, but it also goes well with the passive healing from Leftovers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Since this set benefits so much from Stealth Rock support, running it on its own is a reasonable sacrifice if Garganacl needs to be more self-sufficient.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: This makes Garganacl even more difficult to properly switch into, providing protection against Trick, OHKO moves, and opposing Salt Cure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fissure</strong>: Garganacl's great bulk makes it a prime candidate for fishing with Fissure itself, though its low PP can be an issue in mirror matches.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fling with Light Ball, Toxic Orb, or Flame Orb</strong>: Although the loss of Leftovers can be a huge blow for Garganacl, Fling and its associated status inducing items can be a devastating surprise for some of its checks, such as Annihilape and Urshifu formes. Just note that Covert Cloak will still block these statuses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy and Custap Berry</strong>: Getting rid of Garganacl's status immunity and Ghost resistance is a huge sacrifice, but it can let Garganacl lead against some surprising Pokemon effectively without needing to Terastallize, like Choice Specs Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle. Custap Berry's pseudo-priority can also lead to surprising Stealth Rock set-ups.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Rock may be an awful defensive typing, this Garganacl's complete focus on taking advantage of Salt Cure means that in some scenarios, it can get away without Terastallizing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison's Fighting and Fairy-type resistance vastly improves Garganacl's match-up against Flutter Mane, Ogerpon-H, and Urshifu-R, making it a prime Tera choice.

Tera Ghost also can make foes paranoid of it being the Curse set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying gets rid of the Ground and Fighting weaknesses, giving it a far better chance of beating Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B. It also makes Fissure no longer an issue from Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and opposing Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy lets Garganacl tank powerful Fighting coverage such as Chien-Pao's Scared Sword, and shrug off powerful Dragon-type attacks from Latios and Roaring Moon.</p> </li> </ul>"

Boosting Salt Cure's meager power can also help against frailer Substitute users such as Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Ghost Curse</strong>: If using Tera Ghost, Curse will change its effect, which drastically changes Garganacl's playstyle. While the 50% health cut can make it a tad risky, the Curse affliction is very powerful at wearing down Pokemon, including major foes that take advantage of Salt Cure, such as Covert Cloak Pokemon, bulky Substitute users, and Blaziken Baton Pass chains. When combined with Salt Cure, it can even overwhelm bulky Pokemon with recovery, such as Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse and Earthquake</strong>: Ghost Curse unfortunately does not work against Gholdengo, so using regular Curse alongside Earthquake makes Garganacl far less passive against against Gholdengo and frail Substitute users such as Flutter Mane. This is especially recommended if using other Tera types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect versus Substitute</strong>: Protect is perfect for getting some extra Leftovers recovery, but Substitute comes in handy against Dragon Tail users like Archaludon and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Salt Cure means Garganacl can still without Terastallization, but to truly take advantage of either facet of Curse, expect to Terastallize it often.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: In addition to being a great defensive typing that leaves Garganacl with only a weakness to Dark thanks to Purifying Salt, this is the Tera type that enables the unique properties of Curse.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is Garganacl's best option against Flutter Mane, ensuring it resists both STAB attacks. Absorbing Toxic Spikes is also helpful against stall teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: If messing with Gholdengo is the goal, Tera Water is an excellent choice, resisting the powerful Make It Rain and being a good defensive typing in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Beyond being a great typing that offers a Fighting-type resistance, it also means Garganacl no longer has to worry about Dragon Tail from Archaludon. This doesn't improve Garganacl's match-up against Gholdengo though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying has excellent synergy with Garganacl's former typing, making it immune to Landorus-T and Ursaluna-B's Ground-type attacks, and even removing any worry about Fissure from Ting-Lu and Dondozo.

The Fighting-type resistance against Urshifu formes and Toxic Spikes absorption is also quite helpful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water vastly improves Garganacl's chances of defeating Gholdengo, Urshifu-R, and Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: A Ghost Tera type gives Garganacl an immunity to Body Press, giving it the edge against Archaludon and opposing Garganacl, especially when paired with Leftovers. It can also fool players into thinking Garganacl is using the Curse set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Flying typing lets Garganacl take on new foes such as Landorus-T, Ursaluna-B, and Garchomp, though it makes Garganacl fairly weak to Iron Bundle and Chien-Pao</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Fairy is a good defensive type for Garganacl, giving it a useful Fighting and Dark resistance to help against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, and no longer worrying about powerful Dragon-type attacks.

With Stealth Rock, Expanding Force still achieves most notable KOs without Tera Psychic, but the extra damage is still appreciated.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: In cases where setting up Psychic Terrain proves to be more difficult, Tera Fairy grants a resistance to Sucker Punch and makes disrupting other Dark-types like Chi-Yu easier.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Bulk Up Ceruledge makes excellent use of both its respectable bulk and Bitter Blade's high recovery. By changing its typing to a more defense oriented one, while maintaining the Fire immunity thanks to Flash Fire, Ceruledge can set up Bulk Ups on a variety of common Pokemon, ranging from Corviknight, Kingambit, Azumarill and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt lets Ceruledge set up Bulk Up without needing to fear common phasing moves (with the exception of attacking moves such as Dragon Tail), as well as opposing setup moves such opposing Bulk Up and Iron Defense, provided you outspeed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Shadow Sneak</strong> Priority of some form is always nice to have on a Pokemon, which makes Shadow Sneak an easy contender for the last move. Gaining extra added strength against Pokemon such as Flutter Mane, Dragapult and Annihilape is certainly charming.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass Tera Blast</strong>: This allows Ceruledge to eliminate Dondozo more quickly. While Taunt can shut down Dondozo's Yawn, it cannot shut down Fissure. The only way to beat Dondozo would be to eliminate it as quickly as possibly, which Grass Tera Blast aids with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge</strong>: Flame Charge provides Ceruledge an extra net of safety against potential Scarf users and Annihilape, who are capable of turning the tides against it. While normally, Ceruledge is prone to faster Taunt + Bulk Up users and Scarfed Trick, Flame Charge helps mitigate both of those weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong>: Ceruledge can be a status spreader in games where it can't set up as easily. It also helps Ceruledge set up more easily against threats such as Unaware Clodsire.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy helps Ceruledge's matchup against prominent Dark-types such as Roaring Moon and Hydreigon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: An immunity to Spore and a resistance to Water makes Grass the most notable Tera type for this set. Flash Fire eliminating one of Grass's many weaknesses is also noteworthy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Increasing Bitter Blade's power will always be a valuable trait. Eliminating Ghost's weaknesses to Ghost and Dark also allows Ceruledge to set up more comfortably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: Tera Bug is similar to Tera Grass, but in exchange for losing the Water resistance and maintaining the Rock weakness of Fire / Ghost, Ceruledge can tank Volcarona's Bug Buzz with significantly more ease.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Def with Impish</strong>: Investing into Defense prepares Ceruledge and its mediocre physical bulk for the physical-biased metagame. Bulk Up will boost its Defense, but it can struggle to take some physical hits even after a boost, and its special bulk is naturally high.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: A faster spread helps Ceruledge outspeed other Bulk Up users, like Annihilape opting to invest in bulk. Being faster, more often than not, lets Ceruledge win these matchups with ease.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: While most threats in the metagame at the moment are physical, a specially defensive spread is still noteworthy for its ability to surprise Hydreigon.</p> </li> </ul>"

If Ceruledge is brought down to 1 HP, a +2 Bitter Blade can heal it to the point that it can tank an extra attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Shadow Claw</strong>: Close Combat hits the Normal-, Dark-, and Rock-types that resist Ceruledge's STAB combination. Still, Shadow Claw is a noteworthy choice to guarantee the KO on Mimikyu and let Ceruledge pressure Skeledirge. Note, however, that maximum Defense Skeledirge can recover more than Shadow Claw's damage, barring critical hits, and a Terastallized Skeledirge can completely wall this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance versus Destiny Bond</strong>: As powerful as Swords Dance boosted attacks from Ceruledge are, the abundance of Unaware Pokemon, primarily Dondozo, has made some players opt to use Destiny Bond to snag surprise kills. Destiny Bond can also make the matchup against KOing common Sucker Punch Pokemon, such as Meowscarada and Kingambit, easier to win without having to rely on predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: Adamant's added damage output is valuable, but Jolly allows Ceruledge to outspeed non-Scarf Gholdengo, and gives it a chance at outspeeding Modest Rotom formes and Glimmora. All of the mentioned examples are Special Attackers, meaning Ceruledge's Weak Armor often does not trigger in these matchups.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Giving Bitter Blade an extra push in damage is quite useful, giving Ceruledge more recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Normal is an exceedingly common Tera Type on Ghost types due to the immunity it brings to the table. Ceruledge makes particularly excellent use of Normal Tera by resisting both Steel and Fairy, making it very difficult for Gholdengo and Mimikyu to click anything other than a Ghost type move when facing off against Ceruledge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Giving extra reach power to Close Combat, a powerful option against Pokemon such as Hydreigon, makes Fighting a solid choice for a Tera Type.</p> </li> </ul>"

Alternatively, Chilling Water weakens common switch-ins such as Garchomp and Baxcalibur, allowing you to reposition your team more safely.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Acid Spray</strong>: This threatens non-Steel type switch-ins, and it also lets Bellibolt effectively use Electromorphosis without having to take damage first. It's also a powerful tool against Unaware walls such as Skeledirge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch</strong>: While weak, Sucker Punch snipes Pokemon that activate Focus Sash and/or deals chip damage when Bellibolt is guaranteed to go down.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fairy-type</strong>: Tera Fairy Bellibolt offensively checks big threats like Roaring Moon and Dragapult by walling their non-Terastal sets and nabbing surprise KOs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass-type</strong>: Tera Grass Bellibolt can stay in versus common Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Breloom, sponge their attacks, and either chunk them or survive and reposition.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric-type</strong>: Maximizing Parabolic Charge damage is a viable option.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 28 Def / 180 SpA / 44 SpD / 28 Spe</strong>: This spread is to avoid the 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Rotom-W and Hydreigon's Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor. 28 Speed EVs allow Bellibolt to outspeed 4 Speed EV Hippowdon. 28 Defense EVs are enough to survive Focus Sash Garchomp's Earthquake, which notably becomes a 3HKO if Bellibolt Terastallizes into a typing without a weakness to Ground.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 156 SpA / 124 SpD</strong>: This EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump.

Against the frailer Dragapult, Tera Fire and Fire Blast is enough to earn the KO. It's recommended to run both Fire STAB moves because Overheat's added damage can be necessary to guarantee certain KOs, but its stat drop can be fatal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Solar Beam versus Leaf Storm</strong>: Solar Beam nails the few bulky Water-types that can survive Scovillain's absurd attacks, most notable examples being notably Gastrodon and Assault Vest Azumarill. However, Leaf Storm can be used in its stead for the ability to OHKO Hippowdon, despite it summoning sand.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: Flamethrower is perfectly accurateand is typically more than enough to nip off frailer foes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: In spite of the type matchup, Scovillain is deceptively weak to Kingambit thanks to Sucker Punch.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>The metagame's abundance of Unaware Pokemon makes it difficult to maneuver Moody Pokemon in general. On top of that, Scovillain is held back by the powerful Dragon-types that resist its STAB combination. However, Scovillain still carves a niche for itself by being the only Moody Pokemon with excellent recovery moves, Leech Seed and Ingrain, allowing it to win a variety of matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect and Substitute</strong>: Protect and Substitute are mandatory to get the most opportunities to activate Moody. Once you gain enough Defense or Special Defense boosts that Scovillain's Substitute can tank an attack without breaking, it tends to be easy to win the game. Note, however, that Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers's animation make Scovillain very vulnerable to losing via timer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: With enough Moody boosts, Scovillain's Flamethrower tends to be enough to break through an entire team. There are very few Pokemon that are immune or quadruply resistant to Fire, and Flamethrower has good PP and accuracy, which makes it an easy pick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Giga Drain</strong>: Unlike Flamethrower, Giga Drain gets shrugged off by a lot of Pokemon, even at +6, notably Corviknight and Dragonite. However, an attacking move that helps recover HP lost from Substitutes gives Scovillain more mileage off of Moody. Giga Drain is also notable to more reliably defeat Dondozo, one of the Unaware Pokemon that would give Scovillain a lot of trouble otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leech Seed</strong>: Leech Seed combined with Protect, Substitute, and Leftovers helps Scovillain restore HP while collecting Moody boosts, as well as chipping Pokemon it'd otherwise have trouble against, such as Clodsire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ingrain</strong>: Ingrain is an alternative recovery option that makes Scovillain impervious to phazing moves. When purely considering recovery, it's more reliable than the inaccurate 90% accurate Leech Seed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy Tera Blast</strong>: Tera Blast with Tera Fairy is an excellent option that helps remedy Scovillain's Dragon susceptibility, particularly making the Infiltrator Dragapult and Roaring Moon matchup easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: The Water resistance helps Scovillain beat Dondozo. Even though Dondozo ignores Scovillain's Defense boosts via Unaware, with Tera Water, Scovillain's Substitute can tank a Wave Crash. Tera Water also keeps the Scovillain's Steel resistance, unlike Tera Grass, which makes it easier to check Scizor—a common priority user that people attempt to use to check Moody Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy mitigating Scovillain's weakness to Dragon-types is massively helpful.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>180 HP / 220 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 100 Spe with Bold</strong>: This spread bolsters Scovillain’s physical bulk. Notably, Tera Water Scovillain's Substitute manages to survive Dondozo's Wave Crash with this spread. The Speed allows Scovillain to outspeed slow Baxcalibur and Gholdengo, as well as Dragapult with one Moody Speed boost. The HP is adjusted to make maximum use of Leftovers, with the resulting stat having a remainder of 1 when divided by 16. The remaining EVs are split between Special Attack and Special Defense because, at level 50, investing 8 EVs in either stat has no benefit over investing 4.</li> </ul>"

However, Tera Blast provides more flexible coverage that can also cover Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect versus Substitute</strong>: Protect is the most reliable way to get a free turn of Speed Boost. Substitute is a riskier option for Speed Boost stalling, but it severely punishes passive Pokemon and works extremely well on dual screen teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roost</strong>: Roost can make it incredibly difficult for special attackers to break Espathra after its used Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bold versus Timid</strong>: The given EV spread allows Espathra to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp after two turns of Speed Boost and unboosted Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle after one turn. If running Timid over Bold, you can reallocate 8 Speed EVs elsewhere.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / High</strong>: Tera Blast sets will almost always require Terastallization to have adequate offensive coverage. Having Dazzling Gleam as coverage makes Terastallization less necessary, but Espathra's weaknesses to common types such as Ghost and Dark will remain problematic without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: When paired with Tera Blast, Tera Fighting is Espathra's best hope of defeating Ting-Lu, Chi-Yu, and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire and Tera Blast roast Scizor, and deal massive damage to Chien-Pao, Gholdengo, and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy Tera type flips the Dark-type weakness to a resistance and severely punishes Choice-locked Dragon-types like Dragonite, but at the cost of making Espathra even more vulnerable to Steel-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal provides Espathra with a valuable Ghost-type immunity, blocking Shadow Sneak users in particular that try to get around Espathra's Speed Boost.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers works best when stalling with Protect and Substitute, giving Espathra great long-term healing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Roost sets normally can't fit Substitute, so Lum Berry is good insurance against foes who attempt to hit Espathra with status.</p> </li> </ul>"

Meanwhile, Play Rough provides offensive STAB and is Tinkaton's best option against Dragon-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: With Mold Breaker, Tinkaton is capable of paralyzing Gholdengo and Garganacl with Thunder Wave.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: Despite Tinkaton's low offensive stats, it can still perform as an offensive Pokemon thanks to Gigaton Hammer's enormous 160 Base Power and Swords Dance.

Its reliance on Tera largely depends on the matchups it wants to patch up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water turns Tinkaton's Fire-type weakness into a resistance, allowing it to potentially lock Chi-Yu and Volcarona into resisted moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying makes Tinkaton immune to Ground, which can be useful in avoiding Earthquake from the likes of Ting-Lu, Garchomp, and Great Tusk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy gives Tinkaton a stronger Play Rough. With Mold Breaker ignoring Multiscale, fully invested Adamant Tera Fairy Play Rough almost always OHKOs offensive Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground thwarts Volt Switch pivoting, potentially giving Tinkaton extra turns to set up for itself or teammates. Bulldoze also becomes a more serviceable attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel powers up the already amazing Gigaton Hammer, but at the cost of being weaker to Fighting- and Dark-type attacks.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: Air Balloon let's Tinkaton set up Stealth Rock against other common entry hazard setters such as Garchomp and Glimmora without the use of Flying Tera and pairs incredibly well with Encore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash allows Tinkaton to get support moves like Thunder Wave off even against powerful attacks from the likes of Terastallized Chi-Yu, Garchomp, and Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers has great synergy with Swords Dance and Encore, allowing it to set up while healing off some of the damage from weak moves.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Speads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly or Adamant</strong>: This is a simple offensive spread that takes full advantage of Air Balloon or Focus Sash for survivability.

It's possible to drop if coverage is desperately needed, but forcing Palafin to switch and losing out on a useful pivot move is not the right call in most cases.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch is Palafin-H's best bet against Dragonite before it Terastallizes, and deals decent damage to Amoonguss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Drain Punch</strong>: Close Combat is good coverage, hitting Rotom-W for neutral damage and covering Baxcalibur, Iron Bundle, and Roaring Moon. While weaker, Drain Punch's lack of defensive stat drops makes sense for a better matchup against Focus Sash Chien-Pao and restoring a good amount of health against Iron Bundle before usually KOing it with Jet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Adamant versus Jolly</strong>: An Adamant nature increases the damage Wave Crash and Jet Punch inflict, making Palafin-H a more effective wall breaker and revenge killer. A Jolly nature enables Palafin-H to outspeed Jolly Mimikyu, Jolly Baxcalibur, and Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Grass Knot</strong>: Grass Knot lets Palafin-H potentially 2HKO physically defensive Dondozo, whose normally a good Palafin-H check. It doesn't cover anything else that's useful, with Azumarill and Rotom-W being fairly lightweight.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Terastallization can make Palafin-H to an even more potent revenge killer and cleaner, but its not reliant on it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water makes Palafin-H a potent late-game cleaner, making it the Tera Type that makes sense for most teams.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: If willing to give up on consistent coverage by using Tera Blast, Tera Electric Palafin-H deals a big amount of damage against common bulky Water-types like Azumarill, Dondozo, and Toxapex, in addition to saving Palafin-H from Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: A Grass Tera type turns all of Palafin-H's weaknesses into resistances, giving it a favorable matchup against Rotom-W, and making it immune to Spore from Breloom, Amoonguss, and Brute Bonnet, and having a good Tera Blast against Azumarill and Dondozo. If using the niche Grass Knot, it consistently 2HKOs all but specially defensive Dondozo.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Band</strong>: Choice Band gives Palafin-H the most amount of wallbreaking and revenge killing power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Palafin-H's bulk is good enough to survive some powerful attacks with Assault Vest, such as Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry, and it works well with bulkier EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mystic Water</strong>: If Choice Band is used by another teammate, Mystic Water is a great alternative thanks to most of Palafin-H's attacks being Water-type anyways.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb works well with revenge killing and makes the niche Grass Knot always 2HKO specially defensive Dondozo, but the severe compromise to Palafin-H's bulk, especially with Wave Crash recoil, makes it a lesser option.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Bulkier EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 252 Atk / 116 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Breloom, and lets Palafin-H survive Tera Flying Choice Band Tera Blast from Dragonite from full health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 236 Atk / 20 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom, and survives Modest Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast after Stealth Rock damage. If surviving that isn't important or if using Assault Vest, feel free to swap the HP and Attack investments.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>60 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 12 SpD / 180 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This speedy Assault Vest spread outspeeds Jolly Annihilape, survives Jolly Life Orb Tera Dark Chien-Pao's Crunch from full health, and survives Modest Choice Specs Tera Fairy Flutter Mane's Moonblast after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Palafin-H's powerful priority and good Speed tier separate it from other Bulk Up sweepers, such as Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch</strong>: Even without Tera Fighting, Drain Punch's extra healing makes it a great choice for coverage, and it does massive damage to Kingambit, Chien-Pao, and Meowscarada.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt versus Substitute</strong>: With Taunt, Palafin-H excels at breaking through troublesome defensive Pokemon, such as Corviknight, Wo-Chien, and Skeledirge, and it also gives Palafin a decent move against Ting-Lu and Hippowdon before switching out for Zero to Hero. Substitute has a worse matchup defensive set-up Pokemon, but in exchange it turns Garganacl into an excellent set up opportunity and makes Palafin-H a fearsome sweeper with Toxic Spikes support.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: If using Tera Water, Ice Punch is a reasonable option for hitting Dragon-types, though it does leave Palafin-H walled by Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: While harder to justify than the other support options, Encore does give Palafin-H new chances to set up, punishing slower set-up sweepers like Annihilape in particular.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Unless using Tera Blast, Palafin-H is only pressured to Terastallize to improve certain matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Besides being an excellent defensive typing that punishes Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu for using Dark-type attacks, Tera Fairy gives Palafin-H a great offensive option against Dragon-types like Dragonite and Baxcalibur, as well as coverage against Wo-Chien and Meowscarada with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Boosting Drain Punch's power with Tera Fighting can make Palafin-H even more difficult to take down and can seriously compromise defensive Rotom-W thanks to Taunt or Substitute blocking Will-O-Wisp. However, it does make Palafin-H particularly vulnerable to Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water helps Palafin-H pick off more threats with Jet Punch, having a good shot to OHKO offensive Flutter Mane unboosted after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Besides offering a useful Fairy resistance, Tera Poison lets Palafin-H absorb Toxic Spikes and stop Toxic without a support move, making it a viable alternative.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers takes advantage of Palafin-H's slow setup and is a requirement if using Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Punching Glove</strong>: If using Taunt, Punching Glove is a good option to free up Leftovers for a teammate. Palafin-H appreciates the extra power Jet Punch and Drain Punch gain, and it becomes harder for Rocky Helmet Dragonite to wear it down.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If using Taunt, Covert Cloak turns the tables on the Garganacl matchup in addition to protecting Palafin-H from surprise Light Ball Flings from foes like Annihilape.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 SpD / 116 Spe with Careful</strong>: This spread maximizes Palafin-H's Special Defense while still outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximizing Speed allows Palafin-H to outspeed fast support Pokemon like Mimikyu and Annihilape so it can Taunt them. This spread also outspeeds the rare Choice Specs Hydreigon, which can deal massive damage with Draco Meteor if not using Tera Fairy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 140 Atk / 116 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This is a far more offensive approach to the set, letting Palafin-H function more as a revenge killer with the potential to sweep rather than a bulky setup Pokemon. This is best used with Tera Water, as Palafin-H will then OHKO offensive Flutter Mane with unboosted Jet Punch. The given Speed is for outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With a solid early-game Speed tier, utility, high Special Attack, and decent coverage options, Glimmora can set the tone of a battle with its hazard setting and removing options.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong>: Earth Power ensures that Glimmora is not walled by common Steel-types such as Gholdengo and Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mortal Spin</strong>: If using Stealth Rock weak teammates like Dragonite or Volcarona, clearing the hazards with Mortal Spin can be quite useful, though it's not required for this set to function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sludge Wave versus Energy Ball</strong>: Sludge Wave deals plenty of damage to Primarina, while Energy Ball deals more damage to Ursaluna-B and pairs well with Tera Grass.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes Partners</strong>: While Toxic Debris doesn't mean Toxic Spikes will be set up, it's still good to consider running a teammate with it in mind. Defensive Dragonite sets, Stamina Archaludon, Annihilape, and Gliscor are good examples to consider.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Glimmora can use Terastallization to improve match-ups against foes like Ursaluna-B or Primarina, other teammates will usually want the Terastallization option more.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: A Grass Tera type is the best option, surviving common Ground-type Pokemon such as Ursaluna-B and Garchomp, in addition to nullifying Breloom's Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying vastly improves Glimmora's matchup against Ground-types with a potential to retain Focus Sash, though this doesn't help Glimmora as much offensively as Tera Grass.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: This is the most reliable item for setting up Stealth Rock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: With Air Balloon, Glimmora vastly improves its match-up against Ground-type leads such as Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul>"
      },
      "Meteor Beam": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Power Herb and Meteor Beam combined, Glimmora gains a huge amount of power compared to its other sets, making its softer checks such as Assault Vest Ursaluna-B and Assault Vest Kingambit far less reliable. This set is also less reliant on leading, though Toxic Debris still makes it a natural at this role.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong>: Coverage against Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Archaludon, and Kingambit is required for Glimmora to potentially sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Energy Ball</strong>: Energy Ball is Glimmora's most damaging attack against Ursaluna-B, and it pairs greatly with Tera Grass.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sludge Wave versus Dazzling Gleam</strong>: While Poison coverage may not seem particularly useful, it deals more damage to Primarina than Energy Ball, potentially preventing a revenge kill. Dazzling Gleam on the other hand, knocks out Hydreigon and deals serious damage to Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Since Meteor Beam only has one shot of boosting Special Attack without a charge-up turn, Terastallization is often key to prevent Glimmora's vulnerability to Ground-type attacks from ruining its shot at sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass stands out as the best option, boosting Energy Ball to the point where even some Assault Vest Ursaluna-B risk getting OHKOed after a boost while twisting the Ground-type weakness into a resistance. As a bonus, this also stops Breloom's Spore from derailing a potential sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying's Ground-type immunity is worth considering, and it also grants the bonus of not worrying about Toxic Spikes. However, it provides far less offensive benefit than Tera Grass.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is mainly useful for stopping Scale Shot users like Dragonite and Garchomp from setting up a sweep and revenge kill on Glimmora in one turn as well as punishing Choice-locked Dragon-types such as Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Specs Hydreigon. However, retaining the Steel-type weakness is a big problem against Gholdengo and Scizor.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Bulky Support": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Glimmora's defensive typing isn't spectacular, but Toxic Debris is so effective at setting up Toxic Spikes that it still makes sense to use a defensive set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock versus Toxic Spikes</strong>: Stealth Rock is the more general option that pairs greatly with Toxic Debris. However, for teams that desperately need Toxic Spikes, using the move itself does ensure that special attackers can't play around Glimmora's ability.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mortal Spin</strong>: Mortal Spin provides rare entry hazard removal in the format while also spreading poison, making it a must-have on a defensive set. This particularly pairs well with bulky Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock, such as Dragonite and Volcarona.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong> Even on a defensive set, Glimmora usually can't afford to be easy pickings for Steel-types like Archaludon and Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Power Gem</strong>: Power Gem is Glimmora's best offense against Volcarona, Dragonite, and Baxcalibur, all threats that can threaten to set up on Glimmora otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Red Card versus Air Balloon</strong>: Red Card has excellent synergy with Toxic Debris, letting Glimmora punish a foe by switching into resisted hits such as Dragonite's Extreme Speed to not only set up a layer of Toxic Spikes but also potentially force in one of the foe's teammates to immediately get poisoned. Air Balloon doesn't have this amazing sweep-stopping potential, but it does ensure that Ground-type coverage from foes like Dragonite won't force Glimmora to switch out or Terastallize right away.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Toxic and Corrosion</strong>: Giving up the incredible Toxic Debris is a big sacrifice, but using Corrision and Toxic together can ruin defensive Steel-types like Corviknight, which otherwise may attempt to set up on Glimmora.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Glimmora's 4x weakness to Ground-type attacks is a massive thorn on its side, but while Terastallization can help solve this, this set's more supportive nature doesn't always make it the correct option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass gels with Glimmora defensively, giving it an important resistance to Ground and ensuring that Breloom doesn't stop it with Spore.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>52 Speed EVs versus 68 Speed EVs</strong>: 52 Speed EVs let Glimmora outspeed Jolly Ursaluna and Jolly Kingambit. While they aren't particularly common, these threats have the potential to ruin Glimmora. 68 EVs can be used to outspeed Timid Ursaluna-B, which is also an uncommon but serious threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 164 Def / 36 SpA / 4 SpD / 52 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread nets a 2HKO on maximum HP Gholdengo with Earth Power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 172 Def / 4 SpA / 28 SpD / 52 Spe with Bold</strong>: This more defensive spread avoids an OHKO from Adamant Gallade's Psycho Cut, assuming it doesn't use an offensive boosting item.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Wearing an Assault Vest takes advantage of most opponents aiming to avoid Toxic Debris's activation, giving this set good luring potential against revenge killers like Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earth Power</strong>: Hitting Gholdengo and Archaludon super effectively is essential for Glimmora to truly take advantage of Assault Vest and Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Energy Ball</strong>: Ursaluna-B is a high-value target for this set, making Energy Ball the best coverage move for the job.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mortal Spin versus Sludge Wave</strong>: Mortal Spin is another unique selling point, giving Glimmora far more support potential than most Assault Vest tanks. Sludge Wave is still worth considering for the extra damage done to Primarina and common Tera Fairy Pokemon such as Archaludon and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Dazzling Gleam is a reasonable option for OHKOing Hydreigon and dealing huge damage to Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The given EV spread ensures that maximum HP Ursaluna-B is OHKOed by Tera Grass Energy Ball, while Glimmora will survive Tera Normal Ursaring-B's Silk Scarf-boosted Blood Moon. The Speed EVs let Glimmora outspeed Jolly Ursaluna and Jolly Kingambit, both rare but major threats to it.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependecy - High</strong>: Glimmora's awkward defensive typing means Terastallization is often key for surprising common revenge killers like Gholdengo and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is a powerful defensive and offensive option, letting Glimmora tank against foes like Ursaluna-B, Gholdengo, and Primarina while boosting Energy Ball's power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground isn't as amazing as Tera Grass defensively due to retaining the Water-type weakness, but it ensures that Earth Power will now OHKO offensive Gholdengo and deal massive damage to defensive Archaludon.</p> </li> </ul>"

If a Water-type STAB attack is desired instead, Wave Crash is the preferred option over Liquidation in most cases, purely for the damage output.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect is not only useful for scouting for unexpected Tera types, but pairs well with Yawn and Leftovers to give Dondozo more longevity.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rest and Sleep Talk</strong>: When using Rocky Helmet, these two moves are an alternative way to keep Dondozo healthy. It also makes it much easier for Dondozo to deal with debilitating status conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake has good offensive synergy with Avalanche, and punishes some Tera Electric Pokemon that may attempt to mess with Dondozo, such as Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: This spread maximizes Dondozo's stopping power against physical threats and helps against powerful Tera users, with the ability to avoid a 2HKO from Adamant Chien-Pao's Electric Tera Blast with Leftovers and Protect.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Curse</strong>: Curse can be used to get around Substitute users like Punching Glove Urshifu-R, increasing Dondozo's already incredible bulk and gaining enough power to knock out Substitute in one attack.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Dondozo's defensive typing is fantastic, so Terastallization is usually only needed against the metagame's most fiercesome wall breakers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy Tera type lets Dondozo take on powerful Dark- and Dragon-type attacks much more easily, and is just a good defensive typing in general. Choice Band Koraidon's Outrage is one of the biggest targets, but blocking Scale Shot is also good for forcing Rocky Helmet contact damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: A Fire Tera type throws a wrench in the plans of Tera Electric attackers like Zacian-C and Chien-Pao while still resisting their best STAB attacks. It also makes dealing with Ogerpon-H much easier.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternate EV Spread</h4> <ul> <li><strong>252 HP / 196 Def / 60 SpD with Impish</strong>: By shifting some investment into special bulk, Dondozo can guarantee that it avoids an OHKO from Tera Fairy Moonblast coming from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane.</li> </ul>"

Just note that Chien-Pao is shockingly heavy, so Body Press or Wave Crash is preferred against that threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake offers more reliable Ground-type coverage at the cost of not being an instant KO like Fissure.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Terastallization will help against some specific checks to Dondozo, it's typing is great for general purposes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass removes Dondozo’s usual set of weaknesses and allows it to absorb spore from the likes of Amoonguss, Breloom, and Brute Bonnet.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy grants Dondozo a new set of resistances to take advantage of with its phenomenal bulk and also grants it a powerful STAB to hit Dragon- and Fighting-types with if it runs Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: When paired with Heavy Slam, Dondozo can now 2HKO Iron Bundle without Stealth Rock support, in addition to gaining a fantastic defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Terastallizing into a Ground-type allows Dondozo to block the Electric-type attacks commonly aimed at it while also giving it STAB on Earthquake.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Tera Dragon gives Dondozo a resistance to both Electric- and Water-type attacks, allowing it to stand up to Rotom-W much better.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>44 HP / 212 Atk / 252 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 252 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This more offensive spread makes sense if you have better options for Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Annihilape's great bulk, fearsome offensive presence with Rage Fist, and wide support movepool make it an unpredictable and dangerous foe early-game!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Annihilape is among the most reliable offensive setters of Stealth Rock in the metagame, though it isn't required for Annihilape to be an effective early-game Pokemon for every team.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Final Gambit</strong>: Annihilape's impressive HP stat makes Final Gambit into a powerful KO trading tool, being able to take out bulky foes like Dragonite, Garganacl, Hippowdon, and Stamina Archaludon. Make sure to run at least 236 HP EVs when using Final Gambit to OHKO Hippowdon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb</strong>: Rock Tomb is an excellent Speed control option for its ability to punish Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt gives Annihilape a strong matchup into bulky support Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fling and Light Ball</strong>: This gives Annihilape a chance to paralyze a foe, including Gholdengo that lack Covert Cloak, and turn the tables on fast Focus Sash foes like Flutter Mane and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: If using Focus Sash, Close Combat's Defense drop isn't as devastating, though it leaves more offensive Annihilape vulnerable to getting revenge killed by multi-hit users like Urshifu-R and Loaded Dice Scale Shot foes like Dragonite, Gouging Fire, and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an incredibly powerful move that can lock the opponent into an attacking move to boost Rage Fist's power. Alternatively, it can lock the opponent into a status move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Curse</strong>: This is an excellent way for Annihilape to retire itself from the battle while putting significant pressure on the opponent to switch out and shutting down gimmicks such as Baton Pass.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Endeavor</strong>: When paired with Focus Sash, Endeavor lets Annihilape massive amounts of damage before going down, though Annihilape's own bulk can lessen its effectiveness.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: This Annihilape is often used quite early in the game so Terastallization is often not needed unless it must check a specific threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Beyond offering a valuable Fairy resistance, the Ice and Fire resistances make Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-H, and Chi-Yu easier to deal with.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel has excellent defensive synergy with Annihilape thanks to the Fairy resistance and doing particularly well on spreads that are faster than -1 Chien-Pao to move before Sacred Sword lands.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water lets Annihilape withstand Urshifu-R's Tera Water Surging Strike with any item on either Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison has a good matchup against Flutter Mane, and lets Annihilape deal with Toxic and Toxic Spikes without needing to Taunt or worry about Toxapex's Mental Herb.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Abilities</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Defiant</strong>: Defiant gives Annihilape the widest variety of winning match-ups, doing great against Intimidate Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Incineroar, punishing common Speed control foes like Rock Tomb Ogerpon-H, and ensuring that Charm Flutter Mane will not set up on Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vital Spirit</strong>: Vital Spirit adds to Annihilape’s flexibility against dangerous sleep inducers such as Yawn Ursaluna-B and Spore Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Inner Focus</strong>: This niche ability prevents flinches from Chien-Pao and Dragonite from happening, as well as stopping an Attack drop from Intimidate.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry can be used with specialized spreads to avoid certain 2HKOs and protect Annihilape from Urshifu-R's Tera-boosted Surging Strikes. Try to make sure to have an even HP stat, to ensure that Sitrus Berry activates after getting hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Even when using bulky EV spreads, Focus Sash is useful for surviving an attack from foes that can be difficult to EV for, such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Coba Berry</strong>: Coba Berry stops Tera Flying foes like Dragonite and Landorus-T from getting a surprise KO on Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Roseli Berry</strong>: Roseli Berry works well on specially defensive EV spreads designed defeat Flutter Mane leads that lack Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Sitrus Berry EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Atk / 4 Def / 36 SpD / 220 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread outspeeds Adamant Urshifu formes plus Timid Archaludon and Gholdengo, survives Jolly Choice Band Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes on all but the highest roll, and has a 87.5% chance of surviving Modest Choice Specs Archaludon's Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 140 Def / 124 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Thanks to Sitrus Berry, not even Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-R can OHKO Annihilape with Tera Water Surging Strikes! The Speed investment aims for Modest Gholdengo and Modest Archaludon, and also outspeeds up to Iron Bundle after a Speed drop from Rock Tomb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Atk / 4 Def / 220 SpD / 36 Spe with Careful</strong>: This Sitrus Berry optimized EV usually avoids a OHKO from Choice Specs Gholdengo's Shadow Ball, while outspeeding Adamant Breloom. It also survives Timid Tera-boosted Moonblast from Flutter Mane, meaning any Flutter Mane that gets a Speed boost from Booster Energy will be unable to OHKO Annihilape normally.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 196 Def / 68 Spe with Impish</strong>: This defensive spread avoids a 2HKO from Adamant Tera Fire Ogerpon-H and usually does the same for Adamant Life Orb Chien-Pao, while having enough Speed to outspeed Jolly Ogerpon formes after Rock Tomb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 HP / 252 Atk / 140 Def / 12 SpD / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong> This is the most offensive option for Sitrus Berry, surviving all but the highest roll from Adamant Choice Band Urshifu-R's Tera Water Surging Strikes, and having an astonishing 87.5% chance of OHKOing it with the now 200 BP Rage Fist!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 76 Attack / 4 Def / 12 SpD / 180 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread OHKOes up to Hippowdon with Final Gambit, while outspeeding Jolly Dragonite, and outspeeding Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle after a Speed drop from Rock Tomb. The Special Defense EVs dodge a OHKO from Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Beyond at least reaching a speedtie with opposing Annihilape, this spread avoids a OHKO from Timid Flutter Mane's unboosted Moonblast and even outspeeds paralyzed Speed boosted Flutter Mane. It also outspeeds paralyzed Iron Bundle after Booster Energy, but note that it often uses Substitute to block Fling.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Thanks to great bulk and the dangerous Rage Fist, Annihilape is a powerful bulky setup sweeper of Battle Stadium Singles.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt helps you deal with annoying support Pokemon like Whirlwind Ting-Lu, Thunder Wave Archaludon, and Hippowdon to mention a few, forcing them to attack and boost Rage Fist. This can work on Toxapex, but be warned that Toxapex commonly carries Mental Herb, which could get Annihilape poisoned if it doesn't Terastallize.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an interesting alternative to Taunt, not able to directly shut down defensive answers to Annihilape, but it severely punishes them when Annihilape switches into a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant versus Vital Spirit</strong>: Defiant is the best option for this set, stopping Charm Flutter Mane from eeking out a win, and punishing common ways of dropping Annihilape's Attack such as Intimidate Landorus-T and Breaking Swipe Gouging Fire. Vital Spirit is easier to stop, but, it lets Annihilape can absorb sleep moves from foes like Yawn Ursaluna-B, Yawn Hippowdon, and Spore Breloom without needing Taunt.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is quite helpful at saving Annihilape from certain extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, and Flutter Mane, but Annihilape is perfectly functional without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison offers a better matchup against Flutter Mane, does well against Meowscarada's Flower Trick, and lets Annihilape freely switch into Toxic and Toxic Spikes later in the match. This also drastically reduces the risk of Taunting Toxapex, which makes this Tera type a menace against stall teams!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: In addition to giving a useful resistance to Fairy-, Fire-, and Ice-type attacks from dangerous foes like Flutter Mane, Ogerpon-H, and Chien-Pao, Tera Fire also protects Annihilape from burns.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a fantastic response to Urshifu-R, who otherwise can use Tera Water Surging Strikes to break through Annihilape regardless of Bulk Up boosts. It also works great against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, two powerful wallbreakers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Steel turns Annihilape's Psychic , Flying,and Fairy weakness into resistances, as well as being an excellent defensive type overall. It lets Annihilape deal with foes like Flutter Mane, Latios, and Iron Crown far more effectively at the cost of having issues with Ogerpon-H and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying is an effective Tera against stall teams for avoiding Fissure from Dondozo , forcing it to attack with moves that boost Rage Fist.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's residual recovery eases the long-game of setting up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry and 244 HP EVs</strong>: Reducing the HP EVs to 244 gives Annihilape an even HP stat, which lets Annihilape recover its health with Sitrus Berry the moment it gets hit by Ruination. This makes dealing with Ting-Lu and Wo-Chien an easier task.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak makes Annihilape immune to being Salt Cured, making it a great check against Garganacl if using Taunt to prevent the deadly Tera Ghost Curse. It also gives peace of mind, avoiding potential flinches from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, or Special Defense drops from Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: Maximum Speed mainly helps Annihilape outspeed Timid Archaludon, Timid Gholdengo, Adamant Urshifu formes, and Modest Chi-Yu. The 4 Special Defense EVs are just enough to avoid being OHKOed by Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 244 SpD / 12 Spe with Careful</strong>: More special bulk can make it much more difficult for special attackers such as Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu to revenge kill Annihilape. This spread in particular has a 62.5% chance of surviving Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 Def / 100 SpD with Careful</strong>: This EV spread avoids an OHKO from +2 Chien-Pao, which can be especially helpful with Covert Cloak blocking the flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 SpD / 100 Spe with Careful</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom while still giving Annihilape good special bulk.</p> </li> </ul>"

Rage Fist is still preferred for being the more flexible option though, letting Annihilape potentially clean a weakened team if Final Gambit doesn't work out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Defiant</strong>: While Vital Spirit's Sleep immunity increases Annihilape's switch-in potential, Defiant is the better ability for protecting it from being set up on by Charm Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong> U-turn turns Annihilape into a reasonable pivot and gets it out of unpredictable lead situations against unpredictable early-game offensive foes like Chien-Pao and Dragonite, though this will often lead your opponent to assume Annihilape is holding Choice Scarf even against naturally slower Pokemon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock is risky on a Choice Scarf Pokemon, but it can be useful early-game if Annihilape leads against foes it commonly scares out like Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Encore is an emergency way to punish set-up Pokemon Annihilape can switch into, such as Dragonite and Urshifu-S.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Since Annihilape often sacrifices itself with Final Gambit, Terastallization should only be done if Final Gambit isn't the path to winning the match, and is usually better with Rage Fist's increased late-game potential.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water stops Choice Scarf Urshifu-R from OHKOing Annihilape with Tera Water Surging Strikes, potentially turning a check into a sweeping vector with the now 200 BP Rage Fist!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel covers Annihilape's weakness to Fairy, Psychic, and Flying, all weaknesses that some potentially faster Speed boosted threats like Booster Energy Flutter Mane, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Latios seek to exploit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal gives Annihilape an immunity to Ghost-type attacks, potentially getting it a revenge kill against a bulky Flutter Mane it wouldn't otherwise.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: While not very useful defensively, Tera Ghost seriously juices up Rage Fist's late-game sweeping potential, while still maintaining an important Normal-type priority immunity against Dragonite, Ogerpon-H, and Entei.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, Earth Power has a useful niche in that it can deal big damage to Glimmora without triggering Toxic Debris, as well as being more consistent into Stamina Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes versus Stealth Rock</strong>: Toxic Spikes support is fantastic on Clodsire, making it more difficult for opposing teams to play around getting poisoned. On the other hand, Stealth Rock can be used to pressure Poison- and Flying-types that might otherwise think they are safe from Clodsire's hazards, as well as being good support in general against Dragonite, Lunala and Focus Sash users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Amnesia</strong>: Amnesia elevates Clodsire's Special Defense to crazy levels, potentially shutting out special attacking aces like Miraidon and Terapagos, as well as Lugia when paired with Tera Dark.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Protect</strong>: In addition to benefiting from Leftovers and Black Sludge, Protect can pair well with the passive damage caused from either Toxic or Toxic Spikes.</li> </ul> <h4>Abilities</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Water Absorb</strong>: Water Absorb has fantastic defensive utility in the current format against Urshifu-R’s Surging Strikes, Kyogre’s Water Spout, and Alomomola’s Flip Turn, and can even be combined with Terastallization to further disrupt Water-type Pokemon like the above.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Unaware</strong>: Unaware make Clodsire more consistent against the likes of Nasty Plot Calyrex-S and Calm Mind Miraidon.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Even with Clodsire's high Special Defense, the burst healing from Sitrus Berry goes a long way. With full special bulk investment, Sitrus Berry let's Clodsire always avoids the 2HKO from Choice Specs Miraidon's Draco Meteor after the Special Attack drop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Black Sludge versus Leftovers</strong>: Black Sludge may seem appealing, but it punishes Clodsire for Terastallizing unless it becomes Tera Poison, so Leftovers is preferred unless Leftovers is already on something else.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If running something other than a Dark-type Terastallization, Covert Cloak is an alternate option to preventing Psychic Noise's heal block.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Clodsire's support focus often draws in Taunt users, so Mental Herb is one way to make sure a critical turn of Toxic or Toxic Spikes use still happens.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Clodsire is often a part of defensive cycles that help cover its weaknesses, but Terastallization can generate big momentum when used at the right time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Lugia's Psychic Noise is an issue for Clodsire, so Tera Dark can flip the tables on it as well as resisting Astral Barrage from Calyrex-S and Shadow Ball from Flutter Mane; keep in mind though that both Calyrex-S and Flutter Mane can heavily punish Clodsire's new Fairy-type weakness, so timing is key. Finally, Tera Dark also prevents Prankster Grimmsnarl from shutting down Clodsire with Taunt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost's Fighting-type immunity combined with Water Absorb can make Urshifu-R miserable even if Clodsire hasn't invested in physical bulk. It also allows Clodsire to escape from Shadow Tag Gothitelle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal's Ghost-type immunity makes walling Calyrex-S even easier and, unlike Tera Dark, avoids gaining a Fairy-type weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: With Tera Poison, Clodsire maintains its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes and can also safely run Black Sludge to punish users of Trick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: While Water Absorb prevents Kyogre from using its powerful Water-type attacks, Tera Electric goes further by taking away Clodsire's weakness to Ice Beam while still being strong against Thunder and paralysis.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternative EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>252 HP / 100 Def / 156 Spe with Careful or Calm</strong>: This spread sacrifices some special bulk in order to avoid the 2HKO from Adamant Tera Normal Dragonite's Extreme Speed.</li> </ul>"

Dragon Tail from Garchomp and Dragonite, and OHKO moves from the likes of Dondozo and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Spinner</strong>: Dragonite is such a problematic foe that hitting it hard is worth more than a Fighting-type STAB move.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Body Press</strong>: Although it is difficult to fit in without sacrificing utility or coverage, Body Press is a reasonable option if a Fighting-type STAB move is needed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat</strong>: Close Combat does not gel well with the defensive nature of this set, but it deals far more damage to Ting-Lu than any of Great Tusk's other options.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Great Tusk is a good bulky sweeper on its own, but Terstallization makes it far more difficult to revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Not only is Tera Water an excellent option against Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu, but it also means Dondozo will never break Great Tusk's Substitute with Wave Crash, and Assault Vest Azumarill become an easy target to set up on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a great option for dealing with Great Tusk's weaknesses, such as Fairy-types and makes Iron Bundle usually fail to 2HKO specially defensive Great Tusk without Choice Specs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison is a decent alternative to Tera Steel, providing the vital Fairy-type resistance without the weaknesses to Fighting- and Fire-type attacks and an extremely useful immunity to being poisoned that eases the match-up against Toxic Spikes foes such as Clodsire and Meowscarada.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Fire is not a great defensive type; however, not only does it do well against Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane, it also protects Great Tusk from fast Will-O-Wisp users such as Dragapult, Mimikyu, and Volcarona.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: The residual recovery from Leftovers best suits the slow set-up of this set, especially if using Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Depending on the EV spread, Booster Energy can boost Attack or Speed to increase Great Tusk's late-game cleaning potential.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: If a Garganacl check is desperately needed, Covert Cloak Great Tusk is up for the task.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 140 Atk / 4 Def / 36 SpD / 140 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Adamant Breloom and the rare Timid Abomasnow, survives Timid Iron Bundle's Freeze-Dry, and has a very good chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Adamant Azumarill after using Bulk Up. The Attack EVs OHKO Chien-Pao and defensive Gholdengo with Earthquake after Bulk Up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread gains a Speed boost from Protosynthesis, making Great Tusk an even better late-game sweeper at the cost of physical bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 20 Atk / 84 Def / 20 SpD / 140 Spe with Impish</strong>: This EV spread is meant for use with Tera Steel or Tera Poison, maintaining Great Tusk's Substitute against Dondozo's Wave Crash after Terastallization.

Fling can also get rid of devastating Choice items from Trick users such as Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Scream Tail's great Speed tier makes it an especially effective user of Encore, letting it punish foes that attempt to set up, such as Roaring Moon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Perish Song</strong>: Perish Song is another way for Scream Tail to threaten setup sweepers such as Dragonite, and it can become a win condition late in the game.

With the lack of Sleep Clause, this Speed turns Brute Bonnet into a terrifying sleep inducer!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Crunch versus Sucker Punch</strong>: Crunch is the preferred STAB move, reliably hitting the most common Spore check, Gholdengo, which makes it the ideal STAB attack to use with Substitute. However, Sucker Punch lets Brute Bonnet pick off threats when it doesn't have the chance to Spore and set up Trailblaze.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Close Combat versus Substitute</strong>: On one hand, Close Combat deals massive damage to Dark-type resistances, such as Roaring Moon, but it leaves Brute Bonnet fairly vulnerable to priority attacks. On the other hand, Spore gives Brute Bonnet ample opportunity to set up Substitute, easing the cost of early wake ups.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Powering up Crunch makes it easier to sweep with Crunch or Sucker Punch while still leaving it immune to Grimmsnarl's Prankster Taunt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire turns Brute Bonnet's devastating U-turn and Fairy-type weaknesses into resistances, giving it the edge against Flutter Mane and letting it fry Scizor and Tinkaton with Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison grants Brute Bonnet important resistances to U-turn, Fighting, and Fairy without compromising itself against Water-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: With Tera Fairy, Brute Bonnet deals with Dragon-types far more reliably, and gains a valuable tool against opposing Dark- and Dragon-types with Tera Blast.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 100 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Adamant</strong>: With Adamant, Brute Bonnet will still outspeed Great Tusk and Annihilape after Trailblaze and Dragapult after two uses of Trailblaze.

Nontheless, Seed Bomb is the more reliable option when not using Loaded Dice.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute is easy to set up thanks to Spore and eases the risk early wake-ups can pose. If using Substitute, using Crunch or Payback over Sucker Punch is preferred due to the issues Substitute Gholdengo can cause.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Crunch versus Payback</strong>: Having a reliable Dark-type STAB move is helpful when facing foes like Substitute Gholdengo.

It also heavily disrupts enemy special attackers.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Power Gem</strong>: Power Gem gets a bit of extra damage against Fire-types like Ogerpon-H and Incineroar, which can be relevant when using Tera Stellar.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Calm Mind + Substitute is a classic duo that greatly assists Flutter Mane's setup attempts, allowing it to set up in-front of Thunder Wave Porygon2. Even without Calm Mind, it can save Flutter Mane from devastating uses of Thunder Wave from the likes of Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is hugely disruptive against a variety of support Pokemon, such as Swampert, Ting-Lu, and Porygon2.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Stellar Tera Blast</strong>: With Tera Stellar, Tera Blast can be some good insurance against Pokemon with unpredictable Terastallization options, but the Special Attack drop doesn't gel well with Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draining Kiss</strong>: When using extremely bulky Flutter Mane variants, Draining Kiss can be paired with Calm Mind to keep it around much longer. However, Tera Fairy is highly recommended when using this, as Draining Kiss is otherwise very weak.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Flutter Mane's incredible Speed is put to good use, outspeeding almost everything in the metagame with the major exceptions being Booster Energy Iron Bundle and the very rare Choice Scarf Dragapult.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash patches up Flutter Mane's poor physical bulk, giving it new revenge kill chances.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p>All of these EV spreads are designed to give Flutter Mane a Speed Boost with Protosynthesis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 108 Defense / 140 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: The Defense investment usually allows Flutter Mane to survive Sucker Punch from Adamant Chien-Pao.

Note that this spread's vulnerability to priority makes it a poor fit for Booster Energy variants.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 Def / 20 Spe with Bold</strong>: This extremely defensive spread allows Flutter Mane to survive Tera Dark Life Orb Jolly Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch without needing to Terastallize itself, while still outspeeding Choice Scarf Jolly Landorus-T and Gouging Fire after Booster Energy.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: While Flutter Mane benefits from Terastallization, it's generally flexible enough to go without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Flutter Mane boosting all of its offensive moves once gives it good offensive flexibility, especially since it retains the important immunity to Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy makes Moonblast a potent sweeping move, while reducing damage against Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch and Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is handy for giving a resistance to Steel, Ice, and Fire, giving improved matchups against Scizor, Ting-Lu, Chien-Pao, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: In addition to resisting Bullet Punch, Tera Electric protects Flutter Mane from the dreaded Thunder Wave and Glare!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives Flutter Mane an offensive and defensive edge against Scizor, though the weakness to Urshifu-R's Aqua Jet is quite unwelcome.</p> </li> </ul>"

The defensive investment survives an Aqua Jet from a +2 Adamant Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 204 Def / 116 SpA / 4 SpD / 68 Spe with Modest</strong>: This EV spread only outspeeds up to the Jolly Urshifu formes but maximizes Flutter Mane's ability to take hits, such as surviving a Tera Dark Sucker Punch from an Adamant Urshifu-S after Stealth Rock damage, surviving Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash, and having a 93% chance to survive Surging Strikes from Adamant Urshifu-R.</p> </li> </ul> <p>116 HP / 204 Def / 52 SpA / 4 Def / 132 Spe with Timid: This EV spread only outspeeds up to Jolly Roaring Moon, and survives a Tera Dark Sucker Punch from an Adamant Urshifu-S after Stealth Rock damage, survives Icicle Crash from Adamant Chien-Pao, and has a 93% chance to survive Surging Strikes from Adamant Urshifu-R.

Shadow Ball can be used if consistent damage is more desirable and is almost always the stronger option against Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt is a great complement to Thunder Wave, shutting down opposing disruption and setup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Pain Split</strong>: Pain Split can be used after a KO to heavily disrupt the next target and possibly stall out weaker attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mystical Fire</strong>: Defense-invested Flutter Mane can live unboosted Bullet Punch from Scizor and hit it back hard with Mystical Fire.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired with full paralysis chances and Pain Split, Flutter Mane can live for much longer than expected and snag some sneaky KOs. The main drawback is that Flutter Mane can only run one attack, usually Moonblast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Calm Mind</strong>: Booster Energy sets can still make great use of Calm Mind. It is possible to get free setup turns thanks to full paralysis, but be aware that this is more of an occasional bonus than a consistent strategy to rely on.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: With the Speed increase from Booster Energy, it is nearly guaranteed that Flutter Mane can cripple something.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash can be used with more offensive spreads, and is particularly strong against already boosted opponents.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jaboca Berry</strong>: Jaboca Berry's damage is a sneaky option against physical attackers. It allows Flutter Mane to cleanly beat Focus Sash Chien-Pao and Urshifu in a single turn, while making the combination of Thunder Wave into Hex much more potent into offensive Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 252 Def / 20 Spe with Bold or Timid</strong>: This spread gives great survivability, surviving unboosted Surging Strikes from Urshifu-R and unboosted Bullet Punch from Scizor. 20 Speed EVs ensures that Booster Energy boosts Speed, outrunning Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Gouging Fire. Bold is preferable to maximize bulk, but Timid is still viable to get the jump on other “slow” Flutter Mane and outrun Choice Scarf Urshifu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>124 HP / 252 Def / 132 Spe with Timid</strong>: This spread maintains enough bulk to almost always survive unboosted Surging Strikes while also having enough Speed to outrun Roaring Moon after a single Dragon Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 108 Def / 140 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: This spread allows Flutter Mane to be more offensively oriented while still maintaining some bulk, almost always surviving Adamant Chien-Pao's unboosted Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: A full offensive spread can be used if opting for Focus Sash.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Flutter Mane's high Speed and support options allow it to disrupt with ease. Terastallization is therefore only needed for specific matchups where maintaining momentum is important.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water resists Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes and Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash, and gains a Steel-type resistance for the Gholdengo and Scizor matchups.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric prevents Flutter Mane from being paralyzed itself–an important consideration for the mirror–while still giving a pivotal Steel-type resistance.</p> </li> </ul>"

However, this leaves Flutter Mane quite vulnerable to Steel-types, so Shadow Ball and Mystical Fire are reasonable alternatives.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draining Kiss versus Moonblast</strong>: Moonblast's far superior damage output is a great option versus more defensive teams, while Draining Kiss supplies superior lasting power against more offensive teams and is a great fit for Tera Fairy.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li><strong>124 HP / 252 Def / 132 Spe with Timid</strong>: The chosen EVs ensure that Flutter Mane will always outspeed Jolly Booster Energy Roaring Moon.

For Assault Vest sets, however, it'll be needed to handle Choice Specs Flutter Mane, argubly the most dangerous special attacker in the metagame.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water's Ice and Fire resistances help a lot against Chien-Pao, Urshifu-R, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying lets Iron Hands greatly improve its matchup against Ground-types like Ursaluna-B and Landorus-T and dodge Fissure attempts from the likes of Dondozo and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: A Fairy-type Tera allows Iron Hands to take advantage of its great bulk by giving it a better defensive typing, though previously walled Steel-types like Gholdengo and Archaludon become a lot more threatening.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel grants a resistance to Fairy and boosts Heavy Slam's power, drastically improving defensive Iron Hands's matchup against Flutter Mane.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>28 Speed EVs versus negative Speed nature</strong>: 28 Speed EVs are required to outrun 4 Speed EV Ursaluna-B. However, some sets prefer to run a negative speed nature to make Volt Turn as slow and as powerful as possible. If using a negative Speed nature, you can allocate the 28 Speed EVs elsewhere.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>228 HP / 252 Def / 28 Spe with Impish or Relaxed</strong>: This spread is meant to be used with Sitrus Berry, giving Iron Hands incredible survivability against physical threats such as Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-H and Urshifu-R. With Sitrus Berry recovery, not even Terastallized Jolly Ogerpon-H's Ivy Cudgel can 2HKO Iron Hands!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>68 HP / 168 Atk / 252 Def / 4 SpD / 28 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This balanced spread invests enough Defense to avoid the 2HKO from Jolly Tera Flying Choice Band Dragonite's Tera Blast. After outrunning 4 Speed EV Ursaluna-B, the rest is invested into improving Attack. Sitrus Berry is not required for the Dragonite caluclation above, though it is generally recommended for this spread.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 Atk / 228 SpD / 28 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This Assault Vest spread balances power and special bulk. With Drain Punch recovery, even Tera Normal Bloodmoon can struggle to 2HKO Iron Hands!</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Iron Hands's incredible bulk gives it one of the game's strongest Substitutes, letting it set up on a unique list of threats.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: Swords Dance lets Iron Hands set up on the passive foes it blocks with Substitute. The Attack boost also pairs very well with Drain Punch, keeping Iron Hands healthy and making it much harder to break.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Punch</strong>: Ice Punch provides more immediate damage against pure Ground-types and the ever-present Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Earthquake hits Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Tera Fire Chi-Yu hard. It also does well against foes that try to block Drain Punch with Tera Poison.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Despite having a strong bulk profile, Iron Hands frequently needs to remove its common Ground- and Fairy-type weaknesses to be effective.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy removes all of Iron Hands's most troublesome weaknesses while also granting a powerful Dragon-type immunity. This does, however, make Iron Hands much easier to revenge kill with Gholdengo and Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is another solid defensive option that drastically improves the Chi-Yu matchup. Likewise, the resistance to Ice is fantastic against Chien-Pao and Baxcalibur, with the latter no longer being able to rely on Icicle Spear to effectively break through Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting boosts Drain Punch's output while removing Iron Hands's Ground weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire can block Will-O-Wisp from support Dragapult and Rotom formes, which otherwise outspeed and burn Iron Hands if it doesn't already have Substitute up.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass can turn the tide against faster Grass-types like Breloom and Wo-Chien, blocking their status moves and buying a free turn to start setting up.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li><strong>92 HP / 4 Atk / 172 Def / 212 SpD / 28 Spe with Impish</strong>: The defensive investment keeps uninvested Dondozo's Wave Crash from breaking Iron Hands's Substitute, providing superior protection from Fissure spam. After Terastallizing, non-STAB Earthquake from the likes of Dragonite and Baxcalibur often fails to break Substitute as well. On the specially defensive side, a full health Iron Hands can survive a Fire Blast from Modest Tera Fire Chi-Yu.</li> </ul>"

It can be paired with bulkier EV spreads for even more impressive feats!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Choice Scarf outspeeds important threats such as Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Dragapult, who could otherwise outspeed and KO Iron Moth.

If using Assault Vest, even Choice Specs Flutter Mane fails to 2HKO with Shadow Ball!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 28 Def / 160 SpA / 180 Spe with Modest</strong>: This Assault Vest based spread avoids a 2HKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball, and OHKOes Iron Bundle with Fiery Dance.</p> </li> </ul>"

While Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle are the usual go-to for this, Iron Moth doesn't have to worry about Toxic Spikes or Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Energy Ball</strong>: Energy Ball is the best option for dealing damage to bulky foes like Ting-Lu and Suicune, and it also OHKOes Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Dazzling Gleam is Iron Moth's ticket to overloading Dragon-types like Garchomp and Roaring Moon, who can otherwise stop a sweep.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Toxic Spikes versus Toxic</strong>: This Iron Moth set is arguably the fastest offensive Toxic Spikes setter that makes sense, making it a reasonable option for Toxic Spike loving teammates like Garganacl. Toxic on the other hand, directly puts a timer on common bulky switch-ins like Dragonite and Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: While not providing great coverage overall, Psychic is Iron Moth's best move against Toxapex and opposing Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The given EV Spread ensures Iron Moth gets a Speed boost upon consuming Booster Energy while providing as much protection from priority attacks as possible. It also avoids a OHKO from Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T's Flying Tera Blast.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong> If saved for late game, Iron Moth can often get itself in a position to sweep without worrying about revenge kills.

Toxic on the other hand, lets Iron Moth independently punish bulky responses to it like Ting-Lu and Porygon2.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Whirlwind</strong>: A phazing move may not seemingly gel well with Speed investment, but it has incredible utility when Toxic Spikes are set up, punishing teams that leave their Toxic Spikes absorber in on Iron Moth.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sludge Wave versus Energy Ball</strong>: Giving up on Whirlwind does lose a unique selling point as a Toxic Spikes setter, but in exchange makes Iron Moth much harder to check with Chi-Yu and Primarina. Sludge Wave's damage output makes it the best choice, but Energy Ball stops Swampert from having a field day.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: When the aim is to simply set up Toxic Spikes, Terastallization is not that important. However, Iron Moth's typing gives it enough weaknesses that Terastallization can give it a far longer life span.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Iron Moth a resistance to Water-type moves without losing its resistance to Ice and Fire, which is helpful against Urshifu-R, Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu. It's also a great type to use with Tera Blast for dealing damage to Chi-Yu and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass lets Iron Moth deal with powerful Earthquakes from the likes of Ting-Lu and Landorus-T, gives it a vital resistance to Water, and nullifies Spore.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy's Dark resistance can surprise Chien-Pao looking to revenge kill Iron Moth and protects it from powerful Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Choice Band Dragonite and Gouging Fire.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy can be paired with specialized EV spreads to either get easier KOs, gain a Speed boost, or survive surprising special attacks at the cost of the flexibility of more general EV spreads designed to switch in multiple times.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: The quick burst of recovery Sitrus Berry gives can be paired with specialized EV spreads, allowing Iron Moth to survive a wider range of attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak protects Iron Moth from the dreaded Salt Cure, which can otherwise put a timer on phazing. It also prevents specially defensive Iron Moth from losing to Chi-Yu's flinch chance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers versus Black Sludge</strong>: Leftovers's residual recovery pairs well with using Whirlwind as much as possible, but it's a fairly high-value item. Black Sludge is an acceptable alternative, but note that it will hurt Iron Moth after Terastallization if not using Tera Poison.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Booster Energy Exclusive EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 244 Def / 36 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe with Modest</strong>: This Booster Energy optimized spread OHKOes 4 Special Defense EVs Iron Bundle with a Quark Drive-boosted Fiery Dance while having good enough physical bulk to have a good chances of surviving powerful attacks from full health, like Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Psyshock.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 220 SpD / 36 Spe with Calm</strong>: This EV spread gives Iron Moth a Special Defense boost with Quark Drive, making it so bulky that even a Modest Choice Specs Chi-Yu has a low chance of 2HKOing it with Dark Pulse!</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Sitrus Berry Exclusive EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p>When using Sitrus Berry, make sure to run an even HP stat, so that one use of Ruination will activate it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>180 HP / 228 Def / 100 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread almost always survives two hits from Jolly Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Crunch with Sitrus Berry, and it outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 188 Def / 12 SpA / 12 SpD / 52 Spe with Bold</strong>: This EV spread has around a 90% chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Adamant Focus Sash Chien-Pao's Crunch. The minor Special Defense investment also avoids a 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse and Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 228 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 36 Spe with Modest</strong>: This EV spread survives Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Psyshock from full health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 HP / 132 SpD / 180 Spe with Calm</strong>: This EV spread almost always avoids the 2HKO from Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse while outspeeding it alongside Adamant Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 SpD / 100 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread outspeeds Jolly Annihilape and, as a bonus, gives Leftovers Iron Moth a nearly guaranteed chance to avoid being 2HKOed by Modest Chi-Yu's Dark Pulse and Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Shadow Ball.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 52 Def / 4 SpA / 12 SpD / 196 Spe with Timid</strong>: This EV spread sacrifices some bulk to outspeed Garchomp while still surviving Life Orb Chien-Pao's Crunch and having a great shot of surviving two uses of Dark Pulse from Timid Chi-Yu. It also gets a Speed boost from Quark Drive.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Benchmarks for Speed EVs</h5> <p>Like many fast bulky Pokemon, Iron Moth has a huge variety of viable EV builds. If you'd like to make your own EV spread though, keep these Speed tiers in mind! Natures that can efficiently use these Speed tiers will be mentioned.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>36 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature</strong>: This is the minimum amount of Speed to run, outspeeding Jolly Breloom.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>52 Speed EVs with any Neutral Nature</strong>: This outspeeds Modest Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>76 Speed EVs with Timid or 180 Speed EVs with Calm</strong> This outspeeds Modest Chi-Yu and Adamant Urshifu formes. Note that Timid will give Iron Moth a bonus point to Speed, but a Calm nature has a greater chance of surviving some special attacks with specific EV spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Annihilape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>132 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This is the minimum investment for Iron Moth to get a Speed boost from Quark Drive, assuming no Special Attack investment, since doing so will increase Special Attack instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>156 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Urshifu formes and Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>196 Speed EVs with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul>"

Swords Dance also pairs nicely with Ice Shard for late-game sweeping.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice Shard</strong>: Ice Shard means Baxcalibur will have a difficult time breaking past bulky Steel-types early-game, but it makes it an effective cleaner otherwise, especially with Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jolly versus Adamant</strong>: Jolly ensures that Baxcalibur outspeeds Dragapult after one Speed boost, but Adamant makes plenty of sense with Ice Shard or when using Dragon Dance with Scale Shot.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: Focus Sash may seem like a waste with Baxcalibur's bulk, but it provides new set up opportunities and eases match-ups against other Dragon-types, though Icicle Spear and Scale Shot become far less reliable.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is required for Baxcalibur to cover the most amount of threats via Tera Blast, and patches up its mediocre defensive typing, but Baxcalibur's bulk and tendency to force switches means it's still viable without it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: Tera Ground makes Earthquake an especially reliable sweeping tool, removes most of Baxcalibur's weaknesses, and makes it immune to Thunder Wave from the likes of Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric lets Baxcalibur set-up against Gholdengo and Scizor, and when paired with Tera Blast, is Baxcalibur's best way of wearing down Dondozo, The paralysis immunity also helps Baxcalibur set up against Serperior with less risk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy protects Baxcalibur from faster Dragon-types like Garchomp, and lets Baxcalibur come out on top against Terastallized Scale Shot Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost provides even better protection against Fighting-type attacks than Tera Fairy, and ensures that Dragonite doesn't revenge kill Baxcalibur with Extreme Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: With a Tera type of Steel, Baxcalibur has a much better matchup against Dragon-types and Mimikyu, and a handy resistance to Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Baxcalibur's fantastic bulk, immunity to burns, and access to a priority attack make it a strong option for an Assault Vest tank, despite its iffy defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Icicle Spear</strong>: Icicle Spear is recommended despite its inconsistent damage, as it deals damage through Mimikyu's disguise and potentially KOes Focus Sash users like Breloom and Meowscarada. Just be careful about hitting Stamina Archaludon, who can threaten to gain multiple Defense boosts from it.</p> </li> <li> <p>**Glaive Rush versus Scale Shot **: Glaive Rush makes Baxcalibur very vulnerable to getting KOed the next turn (especially by OHKO users like Fissure Dondozo), but it is still the least risky Dragon-type STAB move. Remember that Ice Shard will remove Glaive Rush's negative effects as well. Scale Shot's Defense drop may not seem like it gels well with this set's bulky focus, but the Speed boost can lead to some late-game clean-ups that would be impossible otherwise.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Icicle Crash</strong>: Icicle Crash's chance of missing and being less effective against Dragonite's Multiscale and Mimikyu's Disguise usually makes it the inferior choice to Icicle Spear, but it doesn't risk activating Archaludon's Stamina multiple times, as well as potentially flipping matches by occasionally flinching slower foes like Ursaluna-B.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Baxcalibur is fully functional without Terastallization, but doing so makes it a far more effective tank due to its poor defensive typing.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ground</strong>: A Ground Tera type gives Baxcalibur a reliable STAB move in Earthquake, resistance to Stealth Rock, and removes a ton of weaknesses, at the cost of becoming more vulnerable to Primarina, Basculegion, and Rotom-W.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: With Tera Electric, Baxcalibur's Tera Blast deals massive damage to Corviknight that lack a set up move, and helps break through Primarina. Tera Electric also makes Baxcalibur a great Gholdengo check thanks to resisting Steel.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy helps Baxcalibur against opposing Terastallizations from Dragon-types like Garchomp and Hydreigon, though being weak to Steel is a big problem.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This simple EV spread maximizes Baxcalibur's bulk and power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 204 Atk / 52 Spe with Adamant</strong>: If using Scale Shot, this Speed investment outspeeds Garchomp, who will often Terastallize in front of Baxcalibur.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 156 Atk / 236 Spe with Adamant</strong>: The Speed investment here outspeeds Modest Gholdengo and Adamant Dragonite at the cost of some bulk, in addition to outspeeding Meowscarada after Scale Shot.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Trick and an immunity to status moves, Gholdengo is a dangerous Choice item attacker for offensive and stall teams alike!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Nasty Plot</strong>: This can be used to give Gholdengo more bite against defensive, slower teams after using Trick.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: Thunderbolt OHKOes Pelipper and matches Make It Rain for damage against Primarina. It also stops Tera Water Garganacl from walling Gholdengo. It does make Gholdengo very vulnerable to Ground-types like Ursaluna-B and Garchomp though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Focus Blast</strong>: Focus Blast slices through Kingambit, who otherwise walls Gholdengo, but the accuracy can be a big issue in close matches.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Power Gem</strong>: Power Gem severly punishes Volcarona switch-ins, who otherwise can be very difficult to deal with. Otherwise, most Pokemon weak to Rock-type attacks will take more damage from Make It Rain.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Dazzling Gleam can be paired with Tera Fairy to crush Hydreigon, though Make It Rain deals more damage to most other Dragon-type targets like Dragonite and Garchomp.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: With this, Gholdengo outspeeds key threats such as Garchomp, Dragapult, and Hydreigon. It also outspeeds Meowscarada, but beware of Sucker Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs make Gholdengo much more difficult to wall, with Assault Vest Ursaluna-B in particular being much easier to break through.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid or Modest</strong>: Gholdengo mirror matches are common enough that maximizing Speed is usually a wise idea. Choice Scarf Gholdengo particularly needs Timid to outspeed Dragapult. If using Choice Specs, Modest becomes easier to justify for cracking through Ursaluna-B more reliably.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>172 HP / 252 SpA / 84 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread focuses on outspeeding Timid Ursaluna-B, Jolly Ursaluna, and Jolly Kingambit, all of whom are uncommon but very deadly to Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>212 HP / 236 Def / 52 SpA / 4 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This bulky Choice Specs spread survives Dragonite's +1 Earthquake, while outspeeding maximum Speed Modest Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Def / 12 SpA / 244 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This extremely bulky spread allows Tera Flying Choice Speccs Gholdengo to survive Tera Normal Ursaluna-B's Blood Moon followed by Vacuum Wave.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Choice Gholdengo is perfectly functional without Terastallizing, it's particularly vulnerable to common Pokemon that Terastallization can solve such as Hydreigon, Garchomp, and Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: With a Flying Tera type, Gholdengo gains an extremely useful immunity to Ground, which is especially useful on Choice Specs sets against Ursaluna-B and Garchomp.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: This Tera type gives Gholdengo a valuable resistance to Fire and Water, massively improving the matchup against Primarina and Volcarona.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Make It Rain becomes very powerful with a Tera boost, giving Choice Specs the chance to OHKO several Ursaluna-B variants in particular.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting saves Gholdengo from Kingambit's Sucker Punch, and can be paired with Tera Blast for a far more reliable Fighting-type attack than Focus Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: A Normal Tera type gives Gholdengo the edge against opposing Ghost-types, potentially flipping the table against hard to check sets like Trick Mimikyu.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Minor Optimizations</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Neutral Nature and Nature Mints</strong>: Use a neutral nature Gholdengo that has a Timid or Modest Mint used on it.

It often isn't particularly useful outside of stall match-ups though.</li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak prevents Salt Cure from chipping down Gholdengo, making it far easier for it to run Recover against Garganacl.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: This is the most reliable option for keeping Gholdengo healthy and pairs especially well with Substitute.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Air Balloon</strong>: Air Balloon prevents Dragonite and Ursaluna-B from hitting Gholdengo particularly hard until its popped. It also ruins Breloom's chances of winning the lead war against Gholdengo and makes Hippowdon easy set-up bait.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>156 HP / 124 SpA / 228 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread outspeeds Adamant Dragonite, while having the same Special Attack stat as a fully invested Timid Gholdengo to disguise itself as the Choice Scarf set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>84 HP / 252 SpA / 172 Spe with Timid</strong>: This outspeeds up to Modest Archaludon and Jolly Dragonite, two foes that otherwise can revenge kill Gholdengo.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>212 HP / 236 Def / 52 SpA / 4 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: This physically bulky spread survives Dragonite's boosted Earthquake, which can be particularly helpful from stopping a Choice Band Dragonite revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: Maximizing Speed is useful on more offensive sets to at least speedtie with opposing Gholdengo, and outspeeding several threats close to this Speed tier, such as Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Def / 12 SpA / 244 SpD / 4 Spe with Modest</strong>: Focusing on special bulk allows Tera Flying Gholdengo to survive Tera Normal Ursaluna's Blood Moon followed by Focus Blast.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Gholdengo may have a great typing, but common Pokemon such as Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Meowscarada will usually revenge kill it without Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Flying Gholdengo gets the jump on dangerous offensive Ground-types like Ursaluna-B and Garchomp, as well as Pokemon that use Ground-type coverage like Dragonite.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With this Tera type and Tera Blast, Gholdengo can severely punish Volcarona, who otherwise is very dangerous to this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fighting</strong>: Tera Fighting is a good stop to Dark-types such as Kingambit, as well as making Tera Blast into a far more reliable alternative to Focus Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy stops defensive Archaludon from being able to phaze Gholdengo at all, in addition to saving it from Dark-type attacks. This comes at the cost of losing the mirror match up though, as well as being easily revenge killed by offensive Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: While it's a much worse defensive typing, Tera Normal does let Gholdengo surprise faster Ghost-types like Mimikyu and opposing Gholdengo, at the cost of being revenge killed by Annihilepe and faster Gallade.</p> </li> </ul>"

Note that both are viable together if you're willing to give up a support move.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: When paired together with Toxic Spikes, Protect and Substitute makes even foes that should beat Wo-Chien get worn down before they can KO it, such as Chi-Yu. Substitute itself protects Wo-Chien from slow users of Yawn such as Dondozo and Hippowdon, and slow OHKO moves from Ting-Lu, Dondozo, and Kingambit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ruination</strong>: Ruination gives Wo-Chien powerful chipping down potential, though it should never be used as Wo-Chien's only attack due to it being extremely difficult to KO with.

Additionally, not being a contact move allows Chien-Pao to avoid unnecessary chip damage from Rocky Helmet users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sucker Punch</strong>: Sucker Punch offers priority with a strong base power.

This is because if Flutter Mane uses Charm, any SpA IV that's higher will result in Tera Blast becoming a Special Attack.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Psychic Fangs</strong>: Psychic Fangs is an alternative to Brick Break for dealing with dual screens while also dealing good damage to Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lash Out</strong>: Lash Out is a situational but powerful response to Charm Flutter Mane thanks to the doubled BP on the turn Chien-Pao's Attack is lowered.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Focus Sash</strong>: This is the most reliable item for Chien-Pao, almost always guaranteeing Chien-Pao at least one attack and flipping many potential match-ups such as offensive Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb makes Chien-Pao a terrifying sweeper and wall-breaker in one!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: While Sitrus Berry may seem strange on such an offensive Pokemon, it can save Tera Electric Chien-Pao from being OHKOed by Adamant Choice Scarf Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes. 36 HP and 36 Defense EVs can be used to guarantee this, but even without investment, Chien-Pao has around a 93% chance of surviving.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low / Medium</strong>: Chien-Pao offers power in spades without needing to Terastallize, but it ultimately comes down to how much Chien-Pao relies on Tera Blast for coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric can be used in tandem with Tera Blast to improve Chien-Pao's matchup against key threats such as Urshifu-R, Kyogre, and Primarina, while also making it immune to paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Stellar's one-time boost per attacking type can open up new sweeping opportunities for Chien-Pao. Maintaining its Dark typing is also strong in consideration of the Calyrex-S matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch to extreme power levels while making Crunch difficult to switch into without a resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire provides Chien-Pao with a host of new resistances against Flutter Mane's Moonblast, Ogerpon-H's Ivy Cudgel, and Scizor's Bullet Punch. These surprise resistances work particularly well with finding a turn to use Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ghost</strong>: Tera Ghost doesn't offer much offensive benefit, but it allows Chien-Pao to dodge Normal-type priority from Dragonite and the Ogerpon formes, which can be particularly useful if using Swords Dance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice can allow Chien-Pao to finish foes off with Ice Shard from higher ranges and makes Icicle Crash an even more formidable tool. If combined with Life Orb, even offensive Urshifu-R can be 2HKOed!</p> </li> </ul>"

Sucker Punch is one of the most powerful priority moves in the metagame, but falters against support moves like Substitute and Thunder Wave. Thanks to Choice Band Chien-Pao's insane power, it is entirely possible to sacrifice coverage and run both if desired.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sacred Sword versus Brick Break</strong>: Sacred Sword gives Chien-Pao useful coverage against bulky foes like Archaludon, as well as opposing Chien-Pao. Brick Break is less powerful but the utility of breaking dual screens can be worth it for some teams.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: Chien-Pao can still opt for extra coverage to pressure would-be checks. However, this can require prediction because of the move lock, and often Chien-Pao will do more than enough damage hammering targets with Tera-boosted STAB attacks.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Chien-Pao is already plenty powerful, Choice Band combined with Tera can make some of the strongest walls in the game fold before Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark</strong>: Tera Dark turns Choice Band Crunch into a devastating wallbreaker move that few can withstand, OHKOing checks like Scizor if using an Adamant nature. Neutralizing Chien-Pao's Steel-type weakness also makes it less vulnerable to Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice gives Choice Band Icicle Crash enough power to challenge even physically defensive Ting-Lu, having approximately a 69% chance to OHKO if using an Adamant nature; be warned, however, that Ting-Lu often Terastallizes in front of Chien-Pao, making this inconsistent. The extra power behind Ice Shard is also a welcome boost.</p> </li> </ul>"

Note that while using Taunt against Toxapex can be useful, it is highly likely to run Mental Herb, which risks getting Ting-Lu poisoned.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Protect</strong>: Protect with Leftovers is a strong choice when running Ting-Lu with high sustain teammates such as Toxapex, and can keep Ting-Lu's health up when its in risky situations like trapped by Dragonite's Fire Spin.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: Heavy Slam deals serious damage to Fairy-types, with Flutter Mane in particular needing a huge amount of defensive investment to avoid being OHKOed by it.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Fissure</strong>: Fissure lets Ting-Lu potentially punish passive Pokemon without Substitute, such as Toxapex.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Spikes</strong>: Getting Stealth Rock and Spikes together makes Whirlwind a very effective damage dealing tool, in addition to supporting other offensive Pokemon. However, it can be difficult to set up without compromising Ting-Lu's damage output.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Even with Ting-Lu's fantastic bulk, Terastallization greatly increases the amount of Pokemon it can beat one-on-one, such as Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Poison</strong>: Tera Poison gives Ting-Lu an important resistance to Fairy and Fighting, and it lets it absorb Toxic Spikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: In addition to a useful Fighting resistance, Tera Fairy helps Ting-Lu against powerful Dragon-types like Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Band Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: With Tera Water, Ting-Lu has a significantly better matchup against Urshifu-R. The Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu matchups can also benefit, but be mindful of potential Tera Blast coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel retaining a Fighting weakness is unfortunate, but in exchange, Heavy Slam will OHKO even most bulky Flutter Mane, and it gives Ting-Lu a good matchup against Iron Bundle.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry versus Leftovers</strong>: Ting-Lu's lack of reliable recovery usually makes Sitrus Berry the most reliable method of surviving an extra attack. Leftovers is a good alternative if Sitrus Berry is needed somewhere else, and even preferable if running Protect.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mental Herb</strong>: Mental Herb can be used to nullify one use of Taunt or Encore, which Ting-Lu is fairly vulnerable to, at the cost of reducing its lifespan with a lack of any recovery.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spread Information</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Physical Defense versus Special Defense</strong>: Specializing in one defensive stat depends on which threats Ting-Lu needs to handle, with physically defensive variants preforming better against threats like Dragonite and Roaring Moon, and when Terastallized, Chien-Pao, Ogerpon-H, and Urshifu-R. For specially defensive variants, major targets include Gholdengo and Latios, and when Terastallized, Flutter Mane, Iron Bundle, and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>HP Stat Adjustments with Sitrus Berry</strong>: When using a Sitrus Berry, running an even HP number is the best option, so Ting-Lu will eat its berry right after being hit by Ruination.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 156 Def / 100 SpD with Impish</strong>: When Terastallized to a neutral typing and holding a Sitrus Berry, Ting-Lu survives up to four Icicle Crashes from Jolly Focus Sash Chien-Pao.

It also avoids a KO from Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak following Play Rough and often survives Tera Normal Dragonite's Choice Band Extreme Speed.

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With Swords Dance, Koraidon's already volcanic power crushes almost everything in its path. Only physically defensive Unaware Pokemon like Dondozo and Skeledirge, Tera Fairy Pokemon with Flash Fire like Ceruledge and Heatran, and the rare Dachsbun have any hope of walling it!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Collision Course versus Drain Punch</strong>: Collision Course's lack of drawbacks makes it an easy choice over Close Combat, especially since Koraidon is rather bulky even without investment; after Swords Dance, it still deals over 50% to Hippowdon even without Orichalcum Pulse kicking in. Drain Punch trades a lot of that power against Hippowdon in particular in exchange for healing, which suits Koraidon's reasonable bulk.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flare Blitz versus Flame Charge</strong>: Flare Blitz offers brutal power beyond imagination, usually making it the prime choice. However, boosted Flame Charge with Tera Fire still does good damage and can be paired with Outrage to muscle through certain targets such as Ho-Oh and Toxapex more easily</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scale Shot with Loaded Dice versus Flame Charge</strong>: Koraidon will want a way to boost its Speed to keep revenge killers like Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Landorus-T at bay. Scale Shot works well as both a multi-hit move to shred common Focus Sash users like Chien-Pao and Calyrex-S after a boost. Flame Charge trades ripping through Focus Sash and power for reliability, hitting Fairy-types, and making Koraidon less vulnerable to priority from foes like Choice Band Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Outrage</strong>: Outrage offers vicious power on the level of Flare Blitz, making it a decent alternative when using Flame Charge to deal heavier damage to defensive foes like Dondozo and Ho-Oh. However, it leaves Koraidon very vulnerable to being revenge killed by Fairy-types such as Flutter Mane, Zacian-C, and Tera Fairy Calyrex-S.</li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Loaded Dice</strong>: If using Scale Shot, Loaded Dice is a must for more consistently pummeling foes after a boost. The minimum of 4 hits from Scale Shot notably gives Koraidon a high chance of OHKOing Focus Sash Chien-Pao without a boost, a rare feat for a multi-hit attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Lum Berry</strong>: Lum Berry is a fantastic option against Yawn users like Hippowdon and Ursaluna-B, and it also stops Flutter Mane from sneaking a Thunder Wave in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Clear Amulet</strong>: Clear Amulet ensures that debuff tactics such as Intimidate and Rock Tomb will bounce off Koraidon like pebbles, as well as stopping Charm from Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Life Orb</strong>: Life Orb boosts Koraidon's power to extinction levels, with Tera Fire Flare Blitz even having around a 50% shot of OHKOing Toxapex after Swords Dance!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Terastallization is a great way to keep common revenge killers like Flutter Mane and Ice Shard Chien-Pao from stopping Koraidon cold.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire offers the best combination of offense and defense, turning its devastating Fairy weakness into a resistance and letting Flare Blitz blast foes back to the stone age. Even bulky Fire-resistant foes like Toxapex are actually 2HKOed by a boosted Flare Blitz in sun!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel is a niche alternative to Fire, providing no offensive benefit but flipping Koraidon's Dragon, Fairy, and Psychic weaknesses on their head, as well as protecting it from Toxic Spikes and Toxic users like Gliscor and Toxapex. Just note that the Fire weakness is especially problematic due to Koraidon setting up sun.</p> </li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Koraidon makes for a terrifying bulky attacker, capitalizing on its versatile movepool to adapt to a variety of threats!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Drain Punch</strong>: Drain Punch's recovery pairs nicely with Koraidon's bulk and makes it harder to revenge kill.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flame Charge and Flare Blitz</strong>: Flame Charge is Koraidon's most consistent attack option for raising Speed, and after one use, Koraidon will outrun unboosted targets like Miraidon and Calyrex-S. Flare Blitz’s higher power makes it much easier to break through bulky checks, though the recoil can impact Koraidon's longevity. If Koraidon is using Tera Fire, it is not uncommon to run both simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>U-turn</strong>: U-turn is a great way to bring in sun teammates like Flutter Mane and Chi-Yu against Koraidon's checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast</strong>: When utilized with Tera Electric, Tera Blast can pressure some of Koraidon's most troublesome defensive checks in Dondozo and Primarina.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Claw versus Outrage</strong>: Dragon Claw gives Koraidon a flexible Dragon-type STAB with decent power. Outrage's raw damage is better for breaking through defenses, but the move lock can put Koraidon in danger of getting set up on or revenge killed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>EV Spread</strong>: The Special Defense investment allows Koraidon to withstand two unboosted Astral Barrages from Timid Calyrex-S. The Speed investment lets it outspeed targets up to a base Speed of 100, most notably Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Scale Shot</strong>: Scale Shot can be used as an alternative to Flame Charge as a Speed-boosting move, allowing Koraidon to have a Dragon-type move without sacrificing coverage elsewhere. The Defense drops can be concerning for Koraidon's longevity, however.</li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Terastallization is an integral part of this set's strategy, as even with Assault Vest Koraidon has to shed its Dragon- and Fairy-type weaknesses to withstand threats like Miraidon and Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire gives more reliable attack power to Flame Charge and amps the already dangerous strength of Flare Blitz to incredible levels. It also flips Koraidon's troublesome x4 Fairy-type weakness to a resistance and makes burns a non-issue, potentially tripping up targets like Will-O-Wisp Calyrex-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric grants a well-rounded defensive typing that is particularly favorable for the Miraidon matchup, and the paralysis immunity gives extra security against Flutter Mane's Thunder Wave sets. Tera Electric also widens offensive coverage when paired with Tera Blast.</p> </li> </ul>"

While the Defense drops can be problematic in some matchups, Dondozo doesn't benefit because its Unaware ability ignores them!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Head</strong>: Iron Head provides excellent synergy with Scale Shot, punishing Fairy-types and Tera Fairy users trying to stop Koraidon's Scale Shot momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt stops options like Yawn and Rest from Dondozo, and is generally disruptive to many other targets thanks to Koraidon's Speed. Though incredibly versatile, Taunt does leave Koraidon open to Dondozo's Fissure spam.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Substitute</strong>: Substitute provides insurance against Dondozo's Fissure while still stopping status moves like Yawn. With Koraidon's great Speed, Substitute also works great for scouting Terastallization. Finally, Substitute can make it harder for Pokemon like Extreme Speed Dragonite and Sucker Punch Chien-Pao to revenge kill a weakened Koraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Collision Course</strong>: Collision Course deals massive damage to bulky targets like Ting-Lu and Ursaluna-B, which otherwise have an easier time keeping up with this set. It's also a way to hit common Steel-types, though usually these targets will be reluctant to engage Koraidon until it's been scouted for Fire-type moves.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swords Dance</strong>: This may seem like an odd inclusion given the set's focus on Unaware Dondozo, but Koraidon's ability to jumpstart an unstoppable sweep is still viable as ever.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium / High</strong>: The need for Tera Steel largely comes down to making Koraidon more consistent defensively, though it may not be necessary in some instances, such as the case where Dondozo is using Wave Crash over Avalanche. Regardless, the boost to Iron Head makes Koraidon's offensive profile even more threatening, and the resistance to STAB attacks from common Fairy-types like Flutter Mane and Primarina is always great to have.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternative EV Spread</h4> <ul> <li><strong>188 HP / 212 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 100 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This spread is specialized for Substitute use against Dondozo, making it so that Koraidon's Substitute will almost never be OHKOed by unboosted Avalanche as well as always surviving unboosted Body Press and Earthquake, all assuming no Terastallization. The Speed investment makes it so that Koraidon outspeeds up to Timid Chi-Yu.</li> </ul>"

While almost any Pokemon appreciates sleep moves being shut down, there are a few specific types of Pokemon that love Electric Terrain being set up.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Electric Seed Sweepers and Sneasler</strong>: The one-time Defense boost from Electric Seed can be just what some sweepers need to set up. While most bulky sweepers can benefit from Electric Seed, Sneasler is one of the best options thanks to taking advantage of Unburden as well, meaning it'll outspeed even Choice Scarf Calyrex-S!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Iron Treads</strong>: Iron Treads reigns as the supreme choice that most teams should consider over other Quark Drive Pokemon. It can use the ability's Speed boost to outpace Pokemon like Chien-Pao, Calyrex-S and opposing Miraidon, and its impressive typing, offensive coverage, and utility options give it a lot of range. The main weakness to pay attention to is that Miraidon and Iron Treads share a Ground-type weakness.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Other Quark Drive Pokemon</strong>: There are more niche Paradox Pokemon that benefit from Miraidon's Electric Terrain, such as Iron Bundle, Focus Sash Iron Valiant, Power Herb Iron Moth, and Iron Hands.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Speed EV Benchmarks</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>20 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Landorus-T.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>52 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Gliscor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>68 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Urshifu formes and Jolly Mimikyu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Timid Chi-Yu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>60+ Spe or 188 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Ogerpon formes, Timid Iron Moth, and Timid Alolan Ninetales.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>68+ Spe or 196 Spe</strong>: This outspeeds positive-natured Scream Tail.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>132+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Roaring Moon as well as neutral-natured Miraidon, Koraidon, Chien-Pao, and Flutter Mane.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Jolly Sneasler that have not activated Unburden.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>220+ Spe</strong>: This outspeeds Timid Eternatus.</p> </li> </ul>",

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>With the boosts from Hadron Engine and Electric Terrain driving up its power to horrifying measurements, Miraidon is a shocking combination of special offense and support!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Volt Switch versus U-turn</strong>: Miraidon is a fantastic pivot thanks to its high Speed and power. Volt Switch deals a massive surge of damage compared to most pivoting moves in the game, but U-turn's low power is made up for by the ability to pivot out of Ting-Lu, a common Miraidon check.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tera Blast versus Dazzling Gleam</strong>: Tera Blast Ice is Miraidon's go to attack for hitting Ground-types, even OHKO'ing Assault Vest Landorus-T, whereas Tera Blast Water allows Miraidon to put heavy pressure on Iron Treads. If Miraidon is using Tera Fairy or Tera Electric instead, Dazzling Gleam is a handy alternative that still deals decent damage to Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Timid</strong>: For any Miraidon that runs bulk, Modest is usually the desired nature. On the flip side, offensive Miraidon is in a highly contested Speed tier, making a Timid nature the preferred option in case of Speed ties.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Pulse</strong>: Although it doesn't offer the sheer wallbreaking power of Draco Meteor, Dragon Pulse is a better cleaning tool while Ground-types are still lurking around.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat</strong>: Overheat deals huge damage to Rillaboom, which will often try to reduce Miraidon's power with Grassy Surge. It also hits the rare Iron Treads, which resists all of Miraidon's other coverage moves except Tera Blast Ice or Water.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Choice Scarf</strong>: Koraidon and Flutter Mane boost their Speed often enough where Choice Scarf gives Miraidon a fighting chance of moving first anyway and it makes Miraidon a powerful revenge killer in general.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs wires up Miraidon into a powerful wallbreaker, with only Blissey, Chansey, and Ground-types being able to effectively handle repeated Electro Drifts. With Tera Electric, not even Blissey can withstand Electro Drift!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Magnet, Life Orb, and Assault Vest</strong>: While the following items grant less offensive benefit to Miraidon, not being choice locked against common Ground-type switch-ins can be very worth it. Magnet gives a modest boost to Miraidon's best move in Electro Drift, while Life Orb grants extra power across the board at the cost of compromising Miraidon's bulk. Assault Vest is another option that, even without any bulk investment, still allows Miraidon to avoid the 2HKO from Timid Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Miraidon is perfectly capable of ripping through teams on its own, but Terastallization can either stop certain revenge kill attempts or open up new foes to zap.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Despite being a poor defensive typing, Tera Ice stops Chien-Pao from defeating Miraidon with Icicle Crash while giving it a new coverage attack against Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Rillaboom in Tera Blast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Not only is Tera Fairy great for soaking up Dragon-type attacks, it also provides handy coverage against Ting-Lu with a boosted Dazzling Gleam.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is a far better defensive alternative to Tera Ice for drowning Ground-types with Tera Blast, most notably Iron Treads. Tera Water is also less exploitable by Chien-Pao and Scizor, but it does come at the cost of making Miraidon mirror matchups shaky as well as the occasional Rillaboom becoming a huge problem.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Removing the weaknesses of Miraidon's part-Dragon typing makes Tera Electric already good, and jolting up Electro Drift's power means even Blissey and Electric-resistant Pokemon like bulky Ogerpon-H and specially defensive Wo-Chien take serious damage, especially if Miraidon is holding Choice Specs! Tera Electric also allows Choice Scarf sets to OHKO most Flutter Mane with Electro Drift.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Alternative EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p>Miraidon's natural bulk is impressive, so investing even a little into bulk can make a big difference. These EV spreads can help you get started, but these are just a few examples of what offensive Miraidon can run!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>124 HP / 4 Def / 196 SpA / 12 SpD / 172 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread is specialized for Choice Scarf with enough physical bulk to almost always survive +2 Adamant Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. The special bulk also allows Miraidon to survive +1 Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. Finally, the Speed investment combined with Choice Scarf allows Miraidon to outrun Adamant Dragonite at +2 Speed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 52 Def / 68 SpA / 4 SpD / 140 Spe with Timid</strong>: This speedy Choice Specs spread outruns Adamant Koraidon and Chien-Pao as well as Modest Miraidon and Flutter Mane. In the case of Jolly Chien-Pao, Miraidon almost always survives Icicle Crash as well as Jolly Landorus-T's Earthquake. Enough Special Attack is maintained that Choice Specs Draco Meteor has a very strong chance to OHKO Terastallized Koraidon that is neutral against Dragon-type damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Timid</strong>: Knocking out threats before they can hit Miraidon is sometimes the best defense! Because Miraidon is in a highly contested Speed tier, a Timid nature is the preferred option in case of Speed ties.</p> </li> </ul>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Focusing on bulk with Assault Vest rather than Speed and raw power may seem counter to Miraidon's purpose, but this set showcases its impressive skills as a tank!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Volt Switch versus U-turn</strong>: Miraidon's bulk makes it a great pivot with Volt Switch, especially once Ground-types are dealt with. Just note that it does come at the cost of healing or coverage. If wanting to guarantee Miraidon can pivot against common Ground-type switch-ins, U-turn is also a viable option.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dazzling Gleam</strong>: If Miraidon is using Tera Fairy, Dazzling Gleam is a reasonable way to wear down Ting-Lu switching in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: With such high special bulk from Assault Vest, Miraidon can land surprise KOs on strong special attackers like Flutter Mane and opposing Miraidon.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Parabolic Charge</strong>: Electric Terrain juices Parabolic Charge up into one of the most powerful healing attacks around. Even foes like Calyrex-S are still usually 2HKOed by Parabolic Charge! Unfortunately, it usually involves sacrificing something else critically important like a pivot move or Tera Blast coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Overheat</strong>: This Miraidon variant is particularly vulnerable to the power reduction from Rillaboom's Grassy Surge and the troublesome Iron Treads, giving Overheat a niche to hit them hard without using Terastallization.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Assault Vest Miraidon has enough bulk that even some Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks are unlikely to KO it, but Terastallization still helps it keep in good shape.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice provides both a vital resistance to Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash and powerful coverage against Ground- and Dragon-types alike in Tera Blast, but note that its poor defensive qualities are a bigger sticking point for a tank.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water greatly helps against potential Chien-Pao revenge kills as well as making Tera Blast into a powerful tool against Ground-types. Just be warned that this Tera type gives Rillaboom, the Ogerpon formes, and opposing Miraidon a much easier time revenge killing this set.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy makes powerful Dragon-type attacks bounce off Miraidon, which is perfect for revenge killing Outrage-locked threats like Koraidon, and it increases Dazzling Gleam's power for wearing down Ting-Lu.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Normal</strong>: Tera Normal can cause serious problems for Calyrex-S, forcing it to break Miraidon without its strongest attack in Astral Barrage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: While this set isn't focused on wallbreaking, Tera Electric boosts Electro Drift such that it still electrocutes most Pokemon anyways, and it comes with the bonus of removing all weaknesses associated with Miraidon's part-Dragon typing.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 116 SpA / 68 SpD / 68 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread is designed to survive Draco Meteor from opposing Timid Miraidon and from opposing Modest Miraidon 63.5% of the time, assuming no boosts from items. The Speed investment allows Miraidon to outspeed Jolly Urshifu formes and Mimikyu, both of which can threaten serious damage.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 196 SpA / 36 SpD / 20 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread lets Miraidon outspeed Jolly Landorus-T, giving it an extra bit of power while still surviving unboosted Draco Meteor from Timid Miraidon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Def / 196 SpA / 4 SpD / 52 Spe with Modest</strong>: While Miraidon is no longer guaranteed to live Draco Meteor from opposing Timid Miraidon, the small boost in Speed stays ahead of Jolly Gliscor. Alternatively, the Special Defense investment can be increased to 20 EVs by taking from Special Attack, so that opposing Timid Miraidon will only be able to OHKO on the highest Draco Meteor roll.</p> </li> </ul>"

Parabolic Charge's healing works well for offsetting this, and the Calm Mind boosts help make up for its lower Base Power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Pulse versus Draco Meteor</strong>: Dragon Pulse may be weaker, but it doesn't compromise Miraidon's offense in the long term. Draco Meteor's high burst damage can be worth it in lieu of the Special Attack drop, since this Miraidon often tries to sweep late-game, but it can otherwise be problematic if Miraidon has to face multiple targets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Agility</strong>: With the appropriate Speed investment, Agility will let Miraidon outrun the most common Choice Scarf users in the metagame!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - High</strong>: Due to the one-time nature of Electric Seed, Terastallization is almost mandatory so that Miraidon can overcome its checks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is Miraidon's best hope of taking out the troublesome Iron Treads.

Rock Tomb</strong>: Play Rough is good coverage for foes such as Dragonite and the Urshifu formes, as well as Pokemon that might try to use Tera Dragon to resist Ogerpon-H’s STAB combination.

The Special Defense EVs give Ogerpon-H a high chance of surviving both Blood Moon and Vacuum Wave from Ursaluna-B that lack an offensive item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 4 Atk / 156 Def / 36 SpD / 60 Spe with Adamant</strong>: This spread sacrifices some Speed to survive even Adamant Punching Glove Urshifu-R's Tera Water Surging Strikes while still usually surviving Blood Moon followed by Vacuum Wave from Assault Vest Ursaluna-B. The Speed investment outspeeds Modest Gholdengo, Jolly Breloom, and up to Timid Iron Bundle after Rock Tomb.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>236 HP / 212 Defense / 60 Spe with Impish</strong>: This extremely defensive spread sacrifices plenty of power and some reliability against Ursaluna-B, but makes Ogerpon-H so physically durable that even Jolly Focus Sash Chien-Pao will fail to 2HKO Ogerpon-H! The bulk also gives Ogerpon-H its 2nd-best ah shot at surviving Jolly Choice Band Tera Water Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes at around 69%, while the Speed EVs outspeed Timid Iron Bundle after being smacked by Rock Tomb's Speed debuff.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Embody Aspect</strong>: Ogerpon-H is locked into a Tera Fire, but it trades that and Mold Breaker in exchange for an Attack boost via Embody Aspect! This is perfect for cleaning up teams late-game and saving Ogerpon-H from opposing Ogerpon-H, but note that it completely nullifies Ogerpon-H's potential to check Urshifu-R rc and can open it up to being picked off by other Aqua Jet users like Basculegion and Primarina late-game.</li> </ul>"

While the Defense boost can be useful, note that Ogerpon-C loses Sturdy, which ironically can make it easier to OHKO! If needing the Defense boost, it's usually best to do this if Ogerpon-C is not at full health or needs a boosted Ivy Cudgel to KO a threat.</p>"

Flash Cannon VS. Heavy Slam</strong>: Archaludon should always take advantage of its Steel-type STAB moves to whack Fairy-types. Iron Head has excellent synergy with Thunder Wave thanks its flinch rate and easily 2HKOes most Flutter Mane. Flash Cannon sets risk getting set up on by Calm Mind Flutter Mane but deal more damage to Tera Fairy Pokemon like Gouging Fire and opposing Archaludon. Finally, Heavy Slam crushes all but the most bulky Flutter Mane but does poorly against heavy Tera Fairy foes like Gouging Fire.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Body Press</strong>: Body Press works great with Stamina to make Archaludon a less passive threat.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Archaludon's decent Speed means it outspeeds almost anything that lacks a Choice Scarf after paralyzing them, which can be especially frightening when paired with Iron Head's flinch rate stacking with full paralysis.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Tail VS. Roar</strong>: Archaludon is a fantastic phazer that also happens to outspeed most other phazers. Dragon Tail is easy to recommend, being usable through Taunt and dealing extra chip damage, but Roar is required to force out Fairy-types and Pokemon behind Substitute.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mirror Coat</strong>: While it can be tricky to fit in, Mirror Coat on specially defensive Archaludon can cause huge upsets against foes like Flutter Mane and Latios.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Draco Meteor</strong>: Draco Meteor deals massive damage to opposing Dragon-types and Ursaluna-B that lack Assault Vest, but it's rather tricky to fit in without losing some utility or running a Speed-decreasing nature.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rest and Chesto Berry</strong>: Rest and Chesto Berry give Archaludon even more time to rack up Defense boosts and also make Yawn foes like Swampert and Hippowdon less momentum-killing. Both the move and item require giving up more generally useful slots, though.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p>When using Sitrus Berry, make sure Archaludon's HP is an even number at Level 50 so that one hit by Ruination activates it. This can easily be done with 244 HP EVs.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 164 Def / 100 SpD Impish or Bold</strong>: This Sitrus Berry-optimized spread avoids a 2HKO from Timid Flutter Mane's unboosted Moonblast and also survives two hits of Earthquake from Jolly Landorus-T thanks to Stamina.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 252 Def / 12 SpD Impish or Bold</strong>: Maximizing Defense means it takes Adamant Choice Band Landorus-T to have a good shot of OHKOing Archaludon, with other Landorus-T variants usually failing to OHKO it, at the cost of a worse Flutter Mane matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 12 Def / 252 SpD Careful or Calm</strong>: This specially defensive spread almost always survives Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock damage and has around an 88% chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Modest Choice Specs Gholdengo's Shadow Ball with Sitrus Berry recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Spe Careful or Calm</strong>: The extra bit of special bulk ensures Archaludon will survive Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock, even on the highest roll! Just note that Ruination will no longer immediately activate Sitrus Berry.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry has excellent synergy with Stamina, letting Archaludon take on foes it normally wouldn't dream of, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp with the correct EV spread!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers's gradual recovery rewards Archaludon that manage to get multiple Stamina boosts, making it even more difficult to take down than usual! This can usually be done by switching into a weak priority attack like Primarina's Aqua Jet</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet is an effective tool against physical attackers, being especially helpful on Tera Flying Archaludon to force Tera Normal Dragonite to use Extreme Speed.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Archaludon's fantastic typing can make Terastallization a net negative, so make sure to Terastallize only if it's needed for the matchup.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy solidifies Archaludon against Urshifu-S and Chien-Pao, making the Defense boost-ignoring moves Wicked Blow and Sacred Sword far less of a problem, and saves it from powerful Draco Meteors from foes like Latios.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Tera Flying fixes up its weakness to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, which can save Archaludon from Ursaluna-B for a turn. Just note that losing its Blood Moon resistance could be detrimental in the long run without a boosted Body Press.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is Archaludon's best option against Urshifu-R, removing its Fighting weakness while allowing it not to worry about Surging Strikes ignoring Defense stages.</p> </li> </ul>"

Mirror Coat</strong>: Heavy Slam OHKOes all but the bulkiest of Flutter Mane, giving Archaludon even more early-game power. Mirror Coat is the riskier option, since Archaludon must get hit, but it can lead to a shocking demise for many a special attacker!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest VS. Timid</strong>: Modest is preferred to get as much power out of Archaludon as possible, but Timid happens to outspeed Gholdengo and Adamant Urshifu formes.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Steel Beam</strong>: Steel Beam is an insanely powerful kaboom to go out with, but Archaludon's reasonable bulk even when uninvested makes it a rather constraining move to slot in.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark Pulse</strong>: Dark Pulse is Archaludon's strongest attack against Gholdengo but does little else, especially if using Power Herb and Electro Shot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rock Tomb</strong>: This Archaludon is fast enough to fully take advantage of the speed control Rock Tomb provides. While not as devastating as paralysis, it is less vulnerable to Lum Berry, Taunt, and Encore, in addition to breaking Iron Bundle's Substitute. Just make sure to use a Timid nature so Iron Bundle will be outsped after the Speed drop.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Tail or Roar</strong>: Phazing with such an offensive set may seem odd, but it makes Archaludon less passive after using Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Metal Burst</strong>: Metal Burst is a seemingly less risky alternative to Mirror Coat, but its lack of negative priority doesn't bode well against slower special attackers like Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Naive with 0 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense</strong>: Going this route is the most likely way to get Custap Berry to activate on Archaludon, but the bulk loss makes it less flexible overall.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Items</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Custap Berry</strong>: Custap Berry gives Archaludon a pseudo-priority move in the situation it gets hit hard, giving it a chance to completely ruin gameplans or even revenge kill later in the game!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Jaboca Berry</strong>: This Berry guarantees that the first physical attack to hit Archaludon will deal damage to its foe, potentially ruining common Focus Sash leads such as Chien-Pao and Urshifu formes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Archaludon's great physical bulk means even if Sturdy is activated, it's capable of surviving resisted priority attacks from foes like Adamant Urshifu-R, Dragonite, and Entei while at 26% of its health.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Red Card</strong>: Red Card makes early-game setup foes like Dragonite much less of a worry when Sturdy is intact.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency: Very Low</strong>: Since this Archaludon is usually used in the early parts of the game to support the rest of the team, Terastallization isn't usually a good idea unless a matchup absolutely requires it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: A Ground immunity can come in handy against Landorus-T, a common early-game Stealth Rock setter that can give Archaludon some issues.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a big surprise to powerful Dragon-type wallbreakers like Choice Band Dragonite and Choice Specs Latios.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: In the rare situation Terastallization is needed, Tera Stellar's one-time power boost for each attack could be situationally useful for cleaning up late-game.</p> </li> </ul>"

It also deals decent damage to uncommon Steel-types that are immune to Thunderbolt like in Excadrill and Iron Treads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel Beam</strong>: Steel Beam is absurdly powerful, with even bulky Steel-resistant Pokemon like Scizor needing Assault Vest to avoid a 2HKO! This does come at the cost of ruining Sturdy by losing half of Archaludon's health, though.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Aura Sphere</strong>: While risky to be locked into because of Ghost-types, Aura Sphere deals plenty of damage to Chi-Yu and opposing Archaludon without committing to a Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon Pulse</strong>: Dragon Pulse is a less risky back-up to Draco Meteor, making the revenge killing of Dragon-types like Dragonite less risky.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sturdy</strong>: While Stamina is potentially workable with Archaludon's good bulk, Sturdy is highly recommended for ensuing very few Pokemon can OHKO it without Stealth Rock support, making it far more difficult to check offensively!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Timid</strong>: Modest's extra power is preferred if using Dark Pulse for a potential OHKO on offensive Gholdengo, but Timid is a reasonable consideration for outspeeding Adamant Urshifu formes, Timid Gholdengo, and Jolly Dragonite.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Archaludon focuses so much on offense that Terastallization is best for either dealing more damage or giving it useful immunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stellar</strong>: Tera Stellar's one-time boost per type makes Archaludon a fearsomely flexible wallbreaker, with even support Landorus-T sets being OHKOed by Draco Meteor and Steel Beam!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Flying</strong>: Floating with Tera Flying is a strong way to punish attempts to revenge kill Archaludon with Ground-type attacks, with Landorus-T and and Ursaluna-B in particular being ripe targets. The Fighting resistance also comes in handy if Sturdy is broken by a weak attack.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy ruins strong special attacking Dragon-types like Choice Specs Latios, and it makes Archaludon a solid Urshifu-S check even when Sturdy isn't in play.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dragon</strong>: Tera Dragon's defensive benefits aren't strong beyond resisting Ogerpon-H's STAB attacks, but a consistently powerful Draco Meteor makes it a good offensive choice.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Tera Steel's Fairy resistance can save Archaludon from revenge kills if a weak attack has broken Sturdy, but its main use is for firing off an extremely powerful Steel Beam twice.</p> </li> </ul>"

Choice Band</strong>: Choice Scarf functions the best outside of sun teams and is able to outspeed major threats like Chien-Pao and Iron Bundle. Choice Band is harder to clean with outside of sun teams, and it can use a specialized EV spread to get a Speed boost in sun.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Other Options</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Double Kick</strong>: If using Choice Scarf, Double Kick can be used to OHKO Chien-Pao through its Focus Sash in a surprise revenge kill. It's too weak to be used for much else though.</li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Low</strong>: Since Gouging Fire is focused on cleaning and revenge killing, defensive Terastallization isn't usually an important factor for it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Tera Fire makes Gouging Fire even more difficult to wall, especially in late-game scenarios. It also gives Gouging Fire a handy Fairy resistance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy can turn the tables on other Dragon-types, making it by far the most useful defensive Tera type for this set.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Alternate EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li><strong>84 HP / 164 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with Jolly</strong>: This spread gives Gouging Fire a Speed boost with Protosynthesis, allowing potentially easier cleaning with Choice Band sets in sun. The bulk investment allows Gouging Fire to survive Choice Band Tera-boosted Crunch from Adamant Choice Band Chien-Pao.</li> </ul>"

        "description": "<ul> <li> <p>Gouging Fire's incredible dual STAB coverage and good defensive stats make running a bulky Dragon Dance set a great choice!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Breaking Swipe VS. Dragon Claw</strong>: Dragon Claw is the more reliable late-game cleaning attack, but Breaking Swipe eases Gouging Fire's setup against physical threats.</p> </li> <li> <p>** Heat Crash VS. Flare Blitz**: Gouging Fire is heavy enough for Heat Crash to be just as powerful as Flare Blitz against several lightweight targets, such as Flutter Mane and Gholdengo. However, common, heavy foes like Ursaluna-B and Ting-Lu will only take 40 Base Power of damage from it, which can justify Flare Blitz's recoil for some teams. <a href=\"https://calc.pokemonshowdown.com/\">Checking our damage calculator can help decide if Heat Crash or Flare Blitz is better for your team!</a></p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: While Gouging Fire's typing isn't bad defensively, its common weaknesses to Ground- and Dragon-type attacks mean Terastallization will greatly increase its setup opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong> Tera Fairy is a fantastic defensive choice, fending off Dragon-type attacks that can break through Gouging Fire and making it a great option against Urshifu-S.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water vastly eases the matchup against Urshifu-R, which can bypass Breaking Swipe with Surging Strikes otherwise. It also makes dealing with Chien-Pao easier.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fire</strong>: Fire isn't an impressive defensive choice beyond the useful Fairy resistance and losing the Dragon weakness, but the power boost still makes it worth considering.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Grass</strong>: Tera Grass is awkward against opposing Fire-types and Tera Flying Landorus-T, but the Ground resistance and Spore immunity do give it a niche.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spreads</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Minimum Speed EVs</strong>: Gouging Fire's EV spreads are fairly customizable, but usually it's best to have at least 212 Speed EVs with a neutral nature or 116 EVs with a Jolly nature. This ensures that Gouging Fire outspeeds Iron Bundle, Flutter Mane, and Chien-Pao after one use of Dragon Dance. If the rare Dragapult is a special concern, 252 Speed EVs with a neutral nature or 148 Speed EVs with Jolly can be run to outspeed that after Dragon Dance.</li> </ul> <h5>Physically Defensive Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>244 HP / 4 Atk / 44 Def / 4 SpD / 212 Spe Impish</strong>: This spread avoids a 2HKO from Timid Flutter Mane's Moonblast and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>108 HP / 188 Def / 212 Spe Impish</strong>: This spread is the second most physically defensive spread possible with the given Speed, sacrificing some special bulk to have about an 85% chance of avoiding a 2HKO from Jolly Choice Band Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash with Leftovers recovery. The HP investment is worth it over making Gouging Fire slightly more physically bulky for some extra cushioning against special attacking threats, such as surviving Choice Specs Gholdengo's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Specially Defensive Spreads</h5> <ul> <li> <p>All of these spreads avoid a 2HKO from Flutter Mane that lack Choice Specs, provided Stealth Rock is off the field.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>188 HP / 204 SpD / 116 Spe Jolly</strong> or <strong>188 HP / 108 SpD / 212 Spe Careful</strong>: These identical spreads usually allow Gouging Fire to survive Blood Moon followed by Vacuum Wave from Modest Ursaluna-B when taking Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery into account.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>116 HP / 52 Atk / 4 Def / 220 SpD / 116 Jolly</strong> or <strong>116 HP / 52 Atk / 4 Def / 124 SpD / 212 Spe Careful</strong>: These identical spreads sacrifice some overall bulk to get an Attack boost from Protosynthesis, which can be helpful against sun teams or when using Booster Energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>252 HP / 108 SpD / 148 Spe Jolly</strong>: This spread gives Gouging Fire a Speed boost with Protosynthesis, which is especially helpful for outspeeding Booster Energy Flutter Mane after a Dragon Dance.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers is best for easing Gouging Fire's setup, especially when paired with Breaking Swipe.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy can be used with the specialized EV spreads above to boost a specific stat once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: When using physically defensive spreads or Breaking Swipe, Rocky Helmet is an effective passive damage dealer against threats like Dragonite and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Clear Amulet</strong>: Clear Amulet prevents Landorus-T and Incineroar from obstructing Gouging Fire with Intimidate cycling.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy-Duty Boots</strong>: While not as cripplingly weak to Stealth Rock as something like Volcarona, Heavy-Duty Boots lets Gouging Fire check threats more consistently overall.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Covert Cloak</strong>: Covert Cloak makes losing to Garganacl far less likely and prevents dreaded flinch scenarios from Chien-Pao and Chi-Yu.</p> </li> </ul>"

Discharge's higher paralysis chance can make the power drop worth it if using slow teammates like Ursaluna-B.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heavy Slam</strong>: When used with a Quiet nature, Heavy Slam OHKOes offensive Flutter Mane! If using Modest, it'll still put most Flutter Mane into Thunderclap's KO range as well.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Modest versus Quiet</strong>: Quiet is mainly used for OHKOing offensive Flutter Mane with Heavy Slam, but even with that move, Modest makes sense if your team requires Speed investment.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Raging Bolt's good typing means Terastallization does have some drawbacks, such as making Urshifu-R harder to switch-into, but it has enough common weaknesses to types like Ground and Fairy that mean Terastallization will often be optimal.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a fantastic defensive typing, making Raging Bolt a spectacular check to most Urshifu-S and prancing around strong Dragon-type attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong>: Retaining the common Ground weakness is unfortunate, but Tera Steel makes up for it by tanking Fairy-type attacks and shredding Flutter Mane with Heavy Slam.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: When used with Tera Blast, Tera Ice chills Landorus-T to the bone and deals tremendous damage to Ursaluna-B without firing off Draco Meteor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water gives Raging Bolt a cool resistance to Ice-type attacks from the likes of Chien-Pao while still retaining the Surging Strikes resistance against Urshifu-R. Just watch out for Tera Electric Chien-Pao.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: Tera Electric makes sense for making Thunderclap an even more effective revenge killing tool and ridding Raging Bolt of its Fairy and Dragon weaknesses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: This niche Tera type grants Raging Bolt a resistance to Ground without making it weak to Ice.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 156 Def / 204 SpA with Modest or Quiet</strong>: This survives both Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake and Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash on all but the highest roll of damage, and it also OHKOes offensive Flutter Mane with +2 Thunderbolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>148 HP / 20 Def / 180 SpA / 4 SpD / 156 Spe with Modest</strong>: This spread outspeeds the rare but dangerous Timid Ursaluna-B while avoiding an OHKO from Timid Flutter Mane's unboosted Moonblast and +1 Ogerpon-H's Play Rough.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 236 SpA / 132 SpD with Modest or Quiet</strong>: These EVs are optimized for Assault Vest, letting Terastallized Raging Bolt to avoid a 2HKO from Timid Choice Specs Flutter Mane's Moonblast after Stealth Rock damage.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: Rocky Helmet lets Raging Bolt punish Urshifu-R that lack Punching Glove for using Surging Strikes, since most Urshiu-R will switch out from Raging Bolt.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy gives Raging Bolt a useful increase in power, with Thunderbolt now OHKOing Primarina that lack Assault Vest. However, it doesn't work well with Volt Switch and will usually tell your opponent that you aren't carrying it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Weakness Policy</strong>: Raging Bolt is bulky enough to take full advantage of Weakness Policy, turning Thunderclap into a vicious cleaning tool!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assault Vest</strong>: Raging Bolt's excellent bulk and pivoting prowess make it a great user of Assault Vest.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry's quick burst of recovery is especially helpful when Terastallized into a type that doesn't resist Water against Urshifu-R. Just make sure to use an even HP number to eat the Berry after being hit by Ruination once.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Choice Specs</strong>: Choice Specs transforms Raging Bolt into a fearsome wallbreaking pivot!

Draco Meteor is harder to sweep teams with, but it severely damages Assault Vest Ursaluna-B enough that it's worth considering.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Thunderbolt versus Discharge</strong>: A reliable Electric-type attack ensures that the risky Thunderclap isn't Raging Bolt's only option against Water-types, with Thunderbolt offering a tad more power, while Discharge's 30% paralysis rate is helpful for slow teammates like Ursaluna-B and Basculegion.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Volt Switch with Draco Meteor</strong>: Volt Switch may seem completely contrary to sweeping with Calm Mind boosts, but it can be combined with Draco Meteor to transform Raging Bolt into a wallbreaking pivot rather than a bulky sweeper.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Tera Types</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Medium</strong>: Raging Bolt's common weaknesses like Ground and Fairy, combined with its awesome bulk, makes it a good candidate for Terastallization to prevent revenge kills.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairy</strong>: Tera Fairy is a brilliant defensive typing, ruining Dragon-type attacks and transforming Raging Bolt into a good Urshifu-S check in a pinch.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water</strong>: Tera Water is perfect for soaking up Ice-type attacks from Chien-Pao while still resisting Urshifu-R's Surging Strikes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electric</strong>: In addition to removing the annoying Fairy and Dragon weaknesses, Tera Electric makes Thunderclap an even more fearsome priority attack!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ice</strong>: Tera Ice is awful defensively, but when paired with Tera Blast, Raging Bolt can freeze specially defensive Landorus-T's smug grin off with an OHKO!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Steel</strong> Steel unfortunately retains that annoying Ground weakness, but the resistance to Dragon and Fairy is good enough to consider it against threats like Flutter Mane and offensive Archaludon.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bug</strong>: This niche Tera type gives Raging Bolt a Ground resistance without an Ice weakness that would doom it against Chien-Pao like Tera Flying would.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>Items</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Leftovers rewards Raging Bolt's longevity more than any item, making it the prime cut of items.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet</strong>: With Rocky Helmet, Raging Bolt can consistently punish Choice Scarf Urshifu-R for using Surging Strikes, giving it the perfect chance to set up Calm Mind as Urshifu-R switches out.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sitrus Berry</strong>: Sitrus Berry can be used with specalized EV spreads to prevent some useful 2HKOs. Just make sure to use an even HP stat so it's eaten after Raging Bolt is hit by Ruination one time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Booster Energy</strong>: Booster Energy is a more immediately offensive approach to Raging Bolt, letting it deal good damage without needing to set up Calm Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Figy, Aguav, Mago, Iapapa, or Wiki Berry</strong>: These berries restore more health than Sitrus Berry, though the 25% HP activation does make them riskier.</p> </li> </ul> <h5>EV Spread Examples</h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>140 HP / 180 Def / 44 SpA / 140 SpD / 4 Spe</strong>: This spread survives Annihilape's Final Gambit, Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake, and Adamant Chien-Pao's Icicle Crash.

Earth Power ruins Glimmora and does big damage to Miraidon and Zacian-C, while Flamethrower still hits Zacian-C and roasts the irritating Knock Off Scizor.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Besides benefitting Terapagos's impressive bulk, getting any chance to gain Tera Shell's effect back is devastating enough to seriously consider Leftovers.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Other Options</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rest and Chesto Berry</strong>: When Rest and Chesto Berry are combined, Terapagos has an easy way to gain Tera Shell's protection back! However, this combination won't work nearly as well with Toxic Spikes as Protect does and is very vulnerable to Knock Off.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dark Pulse</strong>: Dark Pulse nails Calyrex-S regardless of whether or not Terapagos is Terastallized, though the great coverage isn't all that useful after Terastallization.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rapid Spin and an Attack IV of 31</strong>: Terapagos is great at removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, especially since most foes won't expect it, plus Terapagos can still boost its Speed even if it's Taunted. As a bonus, Rapid Spin breaks Focus Sash on powerful users like Sneasler. However, Terapagos will now need 244 Speed EVs and a Timid nature to outspeed Calyrex-S after a Speed boost.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Tera Types</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Tera Dependency - Almost Required</strong>: Terapagos is heavily dependent on Terastallization to transform into the incredibly bulky Terapagos-S. This is especially the case if Tera Starstorm is its only attack, meaning Terastallization is necessary to hit Ghost-types.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Terapagos-S</strong>: Tera Stellar is the only possible option for Terapagos, but thankfully Terapagos-S's incredible bulk and perfect coverage make Terastallizing worth it. However, Tera Shell is a fantastic ability for enabling setup, and Tera Starstorm actually does more damage to neutral targets when Terapagos is not Terastallized, so it shouldn't be in a rush to Terastallize either. Also, take special note of Teraform Zero; while its not the main selling point of Terapagos-S, clearing Koraidon's sun or Miraidon's Electric Terrain at the correct times can have a huge impact on the match!</p> </li> </ul> <h4>EV Spreads</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>172 HP EVs</strong>: This HP investment gives Terapagos maximum Leftovers recovery before Terastallizing and minimizes Terapagos-S's damage from entry hazards. It also ensures that +1 Psyshock from Calyrex-S will not 2HKO Terapagos-S after Leftovers recovery.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>100 Speed EVs versus 140 Speed EVs</strong>: 100 Speed EVs let Terapagos outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Landorus-T, a common revenge killer. 140 Speed EVs will require losing some power, but they do enable Terapagos to outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf Urshifu formes, which can potentially revenge kill Terapagos-S with Close Combat.</p> </li> </ul>"

Flamethrower goes all in against Steel-types, roasting Scizor and Corviknight in particular.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Healing Wish / Lunar Dance Support</strong>: A Healing Wish or Lunar Dance teammate lets Terapagos go on another Tera Starstorm rampage, pairing well with its superb bulk.
