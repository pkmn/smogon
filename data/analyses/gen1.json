      "overview": "<p>Venusaur used to be used more often in earlier RBY OU metagames, but it fell out of favor due to the amount of Psychic- and Ice-type moves, as well as paralysis, thrown around. Still, it stands out as a Swords Dance wallbreaker that isn't hindered by Rhydon, and it can cleave through bulky Water-types like Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro thanks to Razor Leaf: Razor Leaf is one of the most consistent ways to dispatch Slowbro in the tier, and deceptively few teams are actually prepared for it. Venusaur is one of faster viable sleepers in the tier, only being outsped by Jynx and Gengar. It can act as a soft check to Snorlax, which is unlikely to 3HKO Venusaur and may be forced into a Rest loop by Razor Leaf, letting Venusaur set up. Venusaur often can be a two-for-one with sleep as one \"KO\", and Swords Dance + Hyper Beam picking up the second.</p> <p>However, a horrible defensive typing makes Venusaur harder to use effectively. It takes super effective damage from the very common Psychic and Blizzard, which will often deal heavy damage or force it out. Because of this, Venusaur adds very little defensive synergy to a team. Secondly, Venusaur's coverage is limited to Grass and Normal, allowing Gengar to hard wall it. Finally, it has competition with Victreebel. Victreebel also has STAB Razor Leaf, gets Wrap and Stun Spore, and has a higher Attack stat. It, however, has lower Defense and Speed than Venusaur. This means that, although Venusaur is less prone to being revenge killed by Tauros and never has to worry about Cloyster speed ties, it lacks the surprise factor and misses out on a few important damage ranges when compared to Victreebel, further narrowing its niche.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Sleep Powder allows Venusaur to keep a Pokemon out of play for up to the entirety of the game. Combined with Venusaur's Speed, you should be able to find an opportunity to land sleep in most games. Razor Leaf is Venusaur's best STAB option, landing a critical hit 99.6% of the time. Razor Leaf's primary target will be Water-types such as Starmie and Slowbro in addition to Rhydon. However, Razor Leaf also notably can 2HKO Tauros after just a little chip damage, while Tauros is unable to 2HKO Venusaur back. Swords Dance allows Venusaur to wallbreak and sweep when paired with Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Venusaur primarily uses sleep from itself or a teammate to set up Swords Dance. One of the best times to set up is immediately after sleeping a Pokemon, which gives a free turn whether it switches or stays in. Another good time is when an opposing Pokemon such as Snorlax or Slowbro is about to use Rest; you can also use Razor Leaf instead to deal damage to a switch-in or force Snorlax into a Rest loop. Before setting up, you also should deal with key threats that outspeed Venusaur and threaten it with high damage or paralysis—especially Gengar, which hard walls it—and avoid any damage or status unless Venusaur absolutely has to take it. After one Swords Dance, Venusaur has a 74.4% chance to OHKO Alakazam and OHKOes Chansey with a bit of initial damage; after a second Swords Dance, it has an 84.6% to KO Starmie with a single Hyper Beam. At +6 Attack, a majority of Pokemon that do not resist Hyper Beam will be OHKOed. Even if Venusaur fails to sweep an entire team, you likely got sleep off and took out at least one fast Pokemon on the opponent's team, possibly Tauros. This lets Venusaur enable Rhydon due to Tauros being one of the main obstacles for Rhydon. Rhydon also pairs nicely with Venusaur because it handles threats such as Zapdos and Pin Missile Jolteon that threaten Venusaur.</p> <p>When using Venusaur, you should not put it in the lead spot. Its Speed does not allow it to do well against any of the common leads, and leading off puts Venusaur in the face of danger early, which can weaken its offensive potential. Waiting to deploy Venusaur lets it get sleep off without risking any Speed ties with Exeggutor. If you paralyze the common leads—Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx—before getting sleep, they often cannot switch in comfortably anyway. Starmie will be threatened by Razor Leaf, and Alakazam and Jynx will usually fall to a +2 Hyper Beam. Body Slam may look enticing for its paralysis chance and lack of recharging, but it is not strong enough to make as much use out of Swords Dance as Hyper Beam.</p>"

Additionally, while Swords Dance could make you assume it has some sort of niche, many better Swords Dance users exist such as Kingler, Kabutops, and Sandslash. The only benefits to using Charizard over Moltres are its base 100 Speed, Swords Dance, and Slash. +2 Hyper Beam or Earthquake can threaten most Pokemon, but it's difficult to use Swords Dance due to the omnipresence of Thunder Wave users like Alakazam and Starmie, and being paralyzed makes Charizard's fragility much more apparent. Its weaknesses to common attacking types leave it 2HKOed by Starmie, Slowbro, Zapdos, Jolteon, most Blizzards, and Gengar, as well as OHKOed by Rhydon and Golem.

Earthquake threatens Jolteon and Rock-types, which threaten Charizard. Slash gives Charizard immediate power without the need for setup, ignoring Reflect and knocking most Pokemon into range for a +2 Hyper Beam. Fire Blast threatens Jynx, Exeggutor, and Victreebel while scaring Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax with the risk of game-losing burns. However, it risks thawing frozen Pokemon and burning Pokemon that appreciate the resulting immunity to other status effects, such as Starmie.

      "overview": "<p>A cursory glance at Raticate may lead one to quickly disregard it as simply a worse Persian. Indeed, the cat and mouse share many similarities such as a Normal typing and access to Thunderbolt and Bubble Beam to strengthen specific matchups, but Raticate suffers from worse attacking stats and a significantly worse Speed tier. However, Raticate has a distinct niche thanks to its exclusive access to Super Fang. RBY OU is a metagame where KO ranges are a crucial factor for players to keep in mind, as nothing wants to be in range of an enemy Tauros. Super Fang's consistent damage is incredible for getting foes to these KO ranges and is guaranteed to leave a dent in anything that attempts to switch in; most importantly, Super Fang ignores type immunity against Gengar, which is one of Raticate's major strengths over Persian, as it limits the number of times that Gengar can switch in safely. Against frailer or weakened targets, Raticate can also threaten them with a Hyper Beam afterwards to KO; additionally, with its great base 97 Speed, it outpaces many Pokemon in the metagame, such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, and threatens them with massive damage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it's not all cheddar and fruit for this humble rodent. Raticate is incredibly frail, making it difficult to switch in and repeatedly wear down foes. This, combined with Super Fang's 89.5% accuracy and 16 PP, can allow faster foes like Starmie and Alakazam with reliable one-turn recovery moves to stall out Raticate's Super Fangs until it misses or runs out of PP. Raticate isn't just frail, either: its defensive profile is decidedly mediocre, meaning it can't afford to trade blows often and thus often loses a flat one-on-one fight; Super Fang's imperfect accuracy also means that missing an attack will force Raticate to take a potentially fatal blow in return, something it cannot afford. Finally, Raticate's attacking stats are very average, which often prevents it from KOing bulkier foes even after a Super Fang. As a result of these flaws, Raticate is heavily reliant on good prediction to be effective in its role, and as such, it is not recommended for most RBY OU teams because Tauros is normally all that's necessary. Even if a \"second Tauros\" is desirable, Persian is usually the better choice.</p>",

Super Fang is obligatory, as it is Raticate's only notable niche in OU and allows it to consistently deal significant damage; notably, it's able to wear down Snorlax, one of the premier defensive Pokemon in RBY. Hyper Beam is Raticate's strongest follow-up after a Super Fang, KOing non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam as well as Victreebel most of the time. Body Slam is spammable and allows Raticate to fish for paralysis on common switch-ins like Starmie. It's also useful after Super Fang as a way to fish for paralysis as Alakazam or Starmie uses Recover. Bubble Beam is Raticate's preferred coverage move because it is very likely to KO Rhydon after Super Fang, which is likely to switch in anticipating a Body Slam or Hyper Beam.</p> <p>While Raticate's first three moves are too important to drop, its last moveslot is more flexible; though, it should be noted that with the exception of Blizzard, replacing Bubble Beam will significantly compromise the Rhydon matchup. Thunderbolt can be used to hit Cloyster, potentially taking it out with a critical hit after a Super Fang. Tail Whip is an option that can be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing a paralyzed Raticate to once again outspeed opposing paralyzed Pokemon while also putting foes in range for Raticate's attacks. Blizzard has a useful freeze chance and is Raticate's strongest option against Gengar and Dragonite, but it has a lower chance to KO Rhydon after a Super Fang than Bubble Beam. Finally, Quick Attack can be used to chip a faster foe such as Tauros before Raticate goes down, but it's very situational and Raticate struggles to find much room for it.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Sandslash is often overlooked in RBY OU, but it realizes a dangerous niche with its unique combination of typing, movepool, and Speed tier. After a Swords Dance, Sandslash can 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier, and it is just fast enough to outpace many crucial threats, including Rhydon, Chansey, and Exeggutor. As a Ground-type, it is frailer than Rhydon and Golem, less powerful to start, and doesn't resist Normal, making it a poor pivot. However, it can sweep, is faster, and beats the two one-on-one by virtue of its Ground neutrality. As a Swords Dance user, its winning matchup against Rhydon, Electric immunity, and consistent STAB Earthquake make up for its lower offensive stats. In particular, its Thunder Wave immunity provides both a consistent entry point for sweeping and a partial safeguard against sweep-ending paralysis, a weakness that plagues all other viable Swords Dance users. Overall, though, Sandslash is frequently defined by its shortcomings. No Normal or Flying resistance means it can't be a primary physical tank or a firm Zapdos answer, unlike Rhydon or Golem. It has low Speed, low Special, a plethora of weaknesses, and merely respectable power before setup, which leave it easily forced out and picked off. Most notably, the excellent Starmie can harry it in all stages of a battle. Unlike all other viable Swords Dance users, it misses the crucial OHKO on Chansey after a boost. Still, with paralysis support and against slower teams, Sandslash can be a very potent offensive weapon while checking Rhydon, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Golem in emergencies.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandslash has other moves that seem appealing, but all of the legitimate options have already been discussed. Rest could theoretically help it defensively, but it's too slow and burdened by weaknesses. A traditional physical tank set would be outclassed by Rhydon, Kabutops, or even Snorlax. Slash is a good move, but Kabutops uses it better, and it has poor synergy with Swords Dance. Toxic discourages partial trapping and forces out Reflect users, but it's too fringe and has many better users. Sand Attack can let Sandslash fish for safe turns to survive attacks or set up, but it's an overly inconsistent gimmick for spending a moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: All OU Ice-types can easily OHKO Sandslash. Cloyster is particularly threatening, as it outspeeds Sandslash and tanks its hits for easy momentum, though with accuracy factored in, Blizzard only has about a 60% chance to OHKO it from full health. Furthermore, Cloyster can get overburdened as a check to many threats, and lure options like Thunderbolt Tauros and Self-Destruct Snorlax can remove it. Lapras has less physical bulk and is outsped by Sandslash, making it vulnerable if worn down, but it can comfortably survive a +2 hit and always OHKO Sandslash with Blizzard. Articuno and Jynx fold to boosted Rock Slide and Earthquake, respectively, but they outspeed and safely revenge kill Sandslash.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Although it requires the rare Hydro Pump to OHKO Sandlash without a critical hit, Starmie is nonetheless the most common impediment to a Sandslash sweep. Great Speed, high Special, and Recover all help Starmie check Sandslash consistently. It can have some difficulty switching in, though, as it detests being paralyzed by Body Slam and takes a solid chunk from Earthquake. Starmie also takes upwards of 74% from a +2 Earthquake, meaning Sandslash can often power through if Starmie is worn down or paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros tends to stop Sandslash dead in its tracks late-game by 2HKOing it with Blizzard, serving as one of its biggest obstacles. However, it takes more than 60% from a +2 Earthquake, which can let the opposing Tauros easily win the vital mirror matchup. Oddball sets lacking Blizzard have a more difficult time, as Sandslash can sometimes survive two Body Slams into Hyper Beam. If Sandslash can boost to +4 Attack, it has good odds to OHKO Tauros with Earthquake or Submission, a feat that can often be game-deciding.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Although its improved matchup against Exeggutor is a major advantage of Sandslash over other Ground-types, overall it is far from guaranteed to win one-on-one. Hyper Beam misses, full paralysis from Stun Spore, and Mega Drain recovery can potentially let Exeggutor win. Even when Sandslash KOes Exeggutor, it often ends up paralyzed by Stun Spore or in Tauros's Blizzard or Hyper Beam KO range. Exeggutor can, however, end up worn down throughout a match, letting Sandslash get past it more safely. In a pinch, +2 Body Slam into Hyper Beam will KO Exeggutor 84% of the time assuming both moves connect, while Earthquake or Rock Slide instead of Body Slam drops the odds to ~45% without the possibility of paralysis. If Exeggutor manages to switch into an unboosted Sandslash without taking heavy damage, the matchup shifts dramatically in Exeggutor's favor. Explosion and Mega Drain can also allow Exeggutor to force a direct trade. Beyond Exeggutor, Sandslash is completely vulnerable to Victreebell and Venusaur, being outsped and usually OHKOed while failing to OHKO either at +2, though neither enjoys switching in considering their neutrality to Earthquake and dislike of paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Alakazam can easily revenge kill weakened Sandslash, halting a sweep. Its prevalence in the lead matchup means it is often paralyzed though, allowing Sandslash to OHKO it risk free when set up. Jynx has a similar dynamic. Sandslash can try to set up on them late-game if your opponent's Pokemon are paralyzed and especially if Sandslash is running Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Sandslash is a shaky counter to Zapdos. It can't 2HKO Zapdos unboosted unless it runs Rock Slide, and Drill Peck makes it significantly more vulnerable when switching in and after setting up. Other Flying-types have better matchups still, as Moltres threatens it with a burn and 2HKOes it with Fire Blast, while Articuno OHKOes Sandslash with just Ice Beam. Dragonite performs the best, as Sandslash rarely OHKOes it at +2 without the inferior Rock Slide, and it is susceptible to Wrap and easily 2HKOed by Surf or Blizzard. Even niche Flying-types such as Dodrio and Gyarados can give Sandslash quite a bit of trouble. Rock Slide can substantially threaten these Pokemon, especially Moltres and Articuno, but it is not standard.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave but still vulnerable to Body Slam and Exeggutor's Stun Spore, both of which cripple its effectiveness. Swords Dance can somewhat compensate for this if the foe is also paralyzed, as using it will reapply the paralysis's Speed drops, rendering them slower. That being said, losing its already middling Speed tier is a death sentence with its vulnerability to special attacks, especially considering the prevalence of Ice Beam and Blizzard on slow Pokemon like Chansey, Lapras, and even Snorlax. Even independent of the Speed drop, any full paralysis turns are particularly devastating for a sweeper.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is obligatory for Sandslash's niche. STAB Earthquake provides great neutral coverage and heavily chunks the majority of the metagame after a boost. If running Body Slam, Sandslash can use it into Hyper Beam for the best odds to 2HKO Exeggutor at +2, one of its advantages over Golem and Rhydon. Body Slam also allows Sandslash to fish for paralysis on its common switch-ins, which can help it or Tauros sweep late-game. Alternatively, Rock Slide can cover Flying-types and the rare Pinsir, but it's no stronger than Earthquake against Pokemon like Cloyster, Lapras, and Exeggutor. Furthermore, Body Slam into Hyper Beam still 2HKOes Zapdos at +2. Despite its poor accuracy, Submission allows Sandslash to secure an OHKO on Tauros at +4, which is important because Tauros can impede a Sandslash sweep; it also occasionally OHKOes Chansey at +2 and Snorlax at +4. Substitute can be used over a coverage move, as it can afford Sandslash a free turn against a paralyzed foe, though it can be difficult to set up. Substitute further amplifies Sandslash's unique ability among Swords Dance users to defeat Zapdos, as Drill Peck only breaks Substitute around 30% of the time, allowing Sandslash to safely set up and sweep more effectively. If not used in the third moveslot, Body Slam can also be used in exchange for Hyper Beam due to the danger of Sandslash needing to recharge.</p> <p>Sandslash can reliably check most Rock- and Electric-types, with the exception of Jolteon, but doing so will usually prevent it from sweeping late-game. Therefore, you must determine whether a trade or the potential for a sweep is more valuable. To stay healthy to sweep, Sandslash is best brought in on Thunder Wave, via partial-trapping pivots, or with double switches. It benefits from being hidden until late in the game when it is in a position to sweep. If Sandslash is forced onto the field before a sweep is likely, it should generally lead with Body Slam to chip and potentially paralyze its checks, as using Swords Dance is rarely useful before the opponent's team has been fully scouted. When saved until late in the game, Sandslash can greatly benefit from an opportunity to boost to +4, which allows Earthquake to secure OHKOs on Chansey and Starmie and OHKO Tauros a majority of the time. Additionally, +4 Hyper Beam OHKOes Zapdos about 60% of the time and Exeggutor about 40% of the time, limiting their ability to impede a sweep. Be aware that calculations for +4 Hyper Beam assume it hits and doesn't critically hit, a combined 78.09% chance, so it's riskier in practice.</p> <p>Sandslash is at its most dangerous with paralysis support, and it has good synergy with many paralysis spreaders, including Zapdos, Starmie, Snorlax, and Chansey. The offensive prowess of Zapdos and Starmie in particular often forces paralysis on the opponent's team, either neutralizing foes like Jynx, Alakazam, and opposing Starmie or providing setup opportunities against slower foes like Chansey, Snorlax and Exeggutor, which Sandslash enjoys coming in on. In return, Sandslash can set up and threaten the slow special tanks that limit them offensively, as well as effectively checking the Rock- and Electric- types that threaten them if a Sandslash sweep seems infeasible. Its reduced physical tanking capabilities versus Golem and Rhydon and weakness to Ice-type moves make Cloyster an ideal defensive partner, and Sandslash synergizes well by switching in on the Thunderbolts Cloyster draws in. Sandslash shares many switch-ins with Tauros, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Slowbro, Snorlax, and Starmie; it often clears the way for a late-game Tauros sweep even if it cannot sweep. Lastly, Sandslash is prone to being crippled by Body Slam paralysis, so Reflect Snorlax can also be effective to block that paralysis and generally help with tanking physical hits despite its lower immediate physical bulk. In return, Sandslash threatens an immediate OHKO on Gengar and heavily pressures Golem and Rhydon, which can give mono-Normal attacking Snorlax sets issues. Snorlax is also invaluable for drawing in, pressuring, and paralyzing Cloyster throughout a match, which is essential to the success of Sandslash.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Nidoking manages to find a niche in the Stadium OU metagame as a mixed sweeper thanks to Focus Energy. The move boosts its critical hit rate to a fearsome 62%, which, alongside its perfect coverage and decent attacking stats to back them up, allows it to deal huge damage. In addition, Nidoking has a solid Speed tier that enables it to outpace everything up to Articuno. Its typing isn't entirely without merit, either, as it walls Jolteon and grants it an important immunity to Thunder Wave, a trait that is unique among viable Focus Energy users.</p> <p>Nidoking has its drawbacks, though. Its horrid defensive typing burdens it with weaknesses to Psychic, Ice, and Ground and leaves it without a resistance to Flying, making it a shakier Zapdos check than Rhydon and Golem. To make matters worse, it's outsped by metagame staples such as Alakazam, Starmie, and Tauros, all of which 2HKO Nidoking. This fragility makes paralysis support a necessity to get the most out of Nidoking. On that note, while Nidoking itself is immune to Thunder Wave, it still hates paralysis and can be crippled by Body Slam or Stun Spore. Additionally, Nidoking is unreliable, as it requires setup and, even after setting up, scoring a critical hit is inconsistent. Nevertheless, with the proper support, it can be an effective addition to a team.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Focus Energy significantly boosts Nidoking's critical hit rate, making it very difficult to switch into. Earthquake is Nidoking's most powerful attack; it needs just one critical hit to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Starmie and Chansey. Nidoking 2HKOes Tauros and Snorlax as well if it scores two critical hits, but it only has a 38.4% chance to do so. Blizzard is necessary in the third moveslot, as it gives Nidoking the best shot at muscling through Rest Exeggutor before it can retaliate. It has other uses besides this; a critical hit is guaranteed to OHKO Rhydon and Golem and will usually let Nidoking 2HKO Zapdos, and it has a small freeze chance, letting it KO Pokemon it normally would not be able to as a last resort. Finally, with a single critical hit, Thunderbolt 2HKOes Slowbro and OHKOes the rare Cloyster after a little chip damage.</p> <p>For Nidoking to fulfill its role effectively, it should be kept away from damage and status whenever possible, and faster Pokemon such as Alakazam and Starmie should be paralyzed before it attempts to set up for a sweep. This is easier said than done due to Team Preview, meaning your opponent will know that you have Nidoking on your team and will try to keep these Pokemon as healthy as is feasible so they can keep it in check. Getting Nidoking on the field is not a simple task either due to its horrific defensive typing allowing it to be hit for super effective damage by most metagame staples, but it still has some decent opportunities to switch in and set up with Focus Energy. The most obvious would be the aforementioned Jolteon, which is unable to do anything meaningful to it. Once again, though, your opponent will be aware of Nidoking and will be able to prepare for it by switching out. Another good chance to switch in is on a predicted Rest from Pokemon like Exeggutor. There is also an element of risk here, as most Rest users can predict the switch and deal major damage with their coverage moves, preventing Nidoking from setting up.</p> <p>Slowbro and Starmie are good partners for Nidoking, as they resist Ice, Psychic, and Water and provide paralysis support for it. Slowbro in particular is adept at drawing in enemy Starmie to paralyze it. In return, Nidoking can protect them from Electric-type moves. Exeggutor is another Pokemon that can spread paralysis, but it differentiates itself from Slowbro and Starmie with a handy resistance to Ground that can make the Rhydon matchup easier.</p> <p>Thanks to its immense movepool, Nidoking has plenty of room for customization. Substitute can be used in order to protect it from status and critical hits, but it can be difficult to set up alongside Focus Energy, and it puts Nidoking in OHKO range of Rhydon, Alakazam, and Exeggutor. Ice Beam is a more accurate alternative to Blizzard, but it requires an additional critical hit to 2HKO Exeggutor and almost never OHKOes Rhydon and Golem even with a critical hit. Thunder has poor accuracy, but it can be used instead of Thunderbolt; the greater power allows a critical hit to OHKO Cloyster and KO Starmie and Slowbro after minimal chip damage. Body Slam can paralyze switch-ins like Starmie. Rock Slide OHKOes the rare Articuno and Moltres with a critical hit, but Nidoking is OHKOed and 2HKOed by their Blizzard and Fire Blast and requires paralysis support to reliably outspeed them. Surf reliably KOes Rhydon and Golem without needing a critical hit if they are not at full health and has perfect accuracy, but it is inferior to Blizzard otherwise.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Persian profits immensely from the Substitute mechanics in Stadium OU, which give it a degree of safety against the threat of Thunder Wave. With the strongest Slash in the game in addition to special coverage in Bubble Beam and Thunderbolt, Persian is well-equipped for dealing with Pokemon like weakened Tauros, Cloyster, Rhydon, and Reflect Chansey. Persian is also extremely fast, outrunning Tauros and boasting a 19% critical hit rate, giving it strong revenge killing utility and notable volatility. Because of this, when paired with Tauros, Persian forms a strong Normal-type attacking core that can be difficult for teams to stop.</p> <p>However, Persian should never be used over Tauros—only alongside it—and for good reason: its power is simply inferior. While Slash itself is very strong, Persian itself isn't, making it still struggle against bulkier Pokemon like Snorlax. Persian's special coverage deals middling damage to most targets, meaning it is very reliant on Slash; Tauros possesses Earthquake and Blizzard, allowing it to muscle past Gengar and Exeggutor, respectively. In fact, seeing Gengar in Team Preview often makes Persian dead weight for a majority of the game, forcing its teammates to remove it before it can make any progress. Like many fast Pokemon in the tier, Persian is ruined by paralysis as well, leading to it being forced out if it can't KO Thunder Wave users before they paralyze it. Paralysis also exposes its awful fragilty: critical hits from tier staples like Tauros, Alakazam, and Rhydon can outright OHKO it. Persian also competes with Kangaskhan as a \"second Tauros\", the latter possessing 101 HP Substitutes and superior bulk to better contest Chansey and Snorlax, as well as Earthquake to fight Gengar. However, Persian's Speed and Slash access give it much better qualities as a revenge killer, providing it with a strong niche in the metagame.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Slash is Persian's main outlet for damage, having a 99% critical hit rate to effectively ignore Reflect; it also 2HKOes Alakazam, preventing it from using Substitute if it's already used it once. Bubble Beam allows Persian to 2HKO Rhydon, which otherwise counters it. Common switch-ins to Bubble Beam—such as Alakazam and Starmie—can also have their Speed dropped switching in, which can potentially let Persian threaten them head-on. Thunderbolt lets Persian attempt to 3HKO Cloyster and Slowbro, the latter of which is also particularly vulnerable to critical hits if it tries to set up Amnesia. However, it should be noted that Thunderbolt deals less damage to Starmie than Slash without a critical hit. Finally, Substitute can be used against resting Pokemon like Exeggutor and Slowbro for free, guarding against status and poising Persian to get serious damage in. It can similarly be used against paralyzed Alakazam, Chansey, or Starmie to fish for full paralysis—especially on predicted Recover uses—foes which Persian can muscle past from there.</p> <p>Persian performs best as an expendable mid-game revenge killer, but thanks to Substitute, it can also be a successful late-game cleaner. Once a Pokemon is forced to use Recover, use Rest, or otherwise end up in KO range, Persian can usually come in and profit immensely so long as its checks have been removed. Late-game Persian also has a minor advantage against Substitute Tauros, which put themselves into Slash 2HKO range when using it, so there is value in holding it back to the point where a Tauros mirror would otherwise be appropriate. In terms of other moveset options, Body Slam can be used to let Persian scout while spreading paralysis, though giving up either Bubble Beam or Thunderbolt is often necessary, making Persian more easily checked. Thunder can be used instead of Thunderbolt for a guaranteed 2HKO on Cloyster, as well as dealing more damage to Starmie than Slash, but its consistency gives Persian its own trouble. While Hyper Beam can be used to squeeze 2HKOs on Chansey and Starmie alongside Slash, the forced recharge makes it a far cry from regular RBY and thus generally not recommended.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Persian carves out a niche in RBY OU thanks to its ability to consistently land critical hits with Slash. Slash bypasses Reflect, allowing it to break through Reflect Snorlax. Its solid special coverage ensures that it's only fully walled by Gengar and is able to handle potential answers to Normal-types, such as Rhydon and Cloyster. Persian’s impressive Speed allows it to outspeed Tauros and tie with Starmie, making it an effective revenge killer. It also grants Persian a strong 22.46% critical hit rate. Tauros and Persian form a devastating offensive duo that's tough to handle, as absorbing their combined damage becomes a significant challenge.</p> <p>Despite its offensive potential, Persian is not a replacement for the rampaging bull, Tauros, which partly explains why it has never achieved true OU prominence. Persian is significantly less bulky, often getting 2HKOed by many attacks that Tauros can typically survive. Due to this weakness, Persian is often forced out by Thunder Wave users, such as Alakazam and Starmie. This lack of defensive utility is a key weakness, as Persian cannot afford to switch into any attacks, making it hard to get onto the field safely. Furthermore, since Persian is almost always paired with Tauros, this creates a team with two Pokemon that do not want to take hits, leading to a lack of space for defensive tools.</p> <p>Finally, although Slash is a strong move and always lands a critical hit by design, this means Persian's damage output with Slash is capped. In contrast, Tauros can deal nearly as much damage with Body Slam, but also has the potential to score critical hits and inflict paralysis, giving it higher overall potential in terms of both damage and utility. Persian demands sharp prediction and aggressive play to make the most of its strengths, but when used effectively, it can be very rewarding, particularly against more defensive strategies.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Persian’s other options are not very interesting. Screech can be used alongside Hyper Beam to OHKO Pokemon like Starmie, creating mind games and encouraging switches. It also offers a helpful way to check for Counter from Chansey and Snorlax, potentially allowing Persian to land the move for free. Just like Growl, it can also allow to reapply a Speed drop to a paralyzed Pokemon. However, running Screech means sacrificing too many of Persian's essential moves. Thunder, on the other hand, 2HKOes Cloyster and deals more damage to Starmie than Thunderbolt, but its accuracy and reliability leave much to be desired, making it a less consistent option overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gengar: Persian can't fight Gengar at all, possessing only its special coverage to have even a hope in doing so. Even Thunder only has a vague chance to 5HKO it, so Persian is often forced out while giving Gengar free rein to use an uncontested Hypnosis or force damage onto Persian's teammates. Ideally, Gengar should be accounted for and dispatched before even revealing Persian.</p> <p>Paralysis: Persian can't handle paralysis, which makes its lack of bulk much more apparent and easier to exploit. Worse still, being paralyzed completely diminishes Persian's potential to revenge kill, making it little more than food for opposing Snorlax and Tauros. Many Pokemon, like Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Cloyster, can even 2HKO it with little consequence when it's paralyzed.</p> <p>Starmie: Starmie is capable of stomaching Slash + Hyper Beam and Speed ties with Persian, which, combined with its access to Thunder Wave, makes it very capable of downing the cat. Persian is capable of winning against a paralyzed Starmie, but it will often rely on full paralysis to win if Starmie is at full HP.</p> <p>Tauros: Without Growl shenanigans, Tauros can 2HKO Persian with Body Slam + Hyper Beam, while Persian can only threaten it with Slash followed by a critical hit from Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Snorlax: Snorlax with Hyper Beam can take on Persian, as it 2HKOes with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, and it has the bulk necessary to withstand Persian’s attacks. It just needs to be cautious of a potential Growl.</p> <p>Exeggutor: With its fantastic bulk, Exeggutor can win against Persian one-on-one, threatening it with Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, or a 2HKO from Psychic. However, it will take massive damage in the process, often being forced to use Explosion much sooner than usual.</p> <p>Counter: Counter is a major annoyance for Persian because it doesn’t have an efficient way to scout for it. This makes Snorlax and Chansey with Counter tough for Persian to handle. If Persian revenge kills something, Chansey can easily come in and threaten Thunder Wave, forcing Persian to switch out to avoid paralysis. This allows Chansey to use Counter on the incoming Pokemon, dealing significant damage and putting the Persian player in a tough spot.</p> <p>Rhydon: While it is 2HKOed by Bubble Beam, Rhydon is capable of threatening Persian, as it 2HKOes Persian with Earthquake and resists Slash. Due to it effectively forcing Persian to use Bubble Beam, it can pivot to a specially bulky Pokemon like Alakazam to switch in with relative impunity unless a Speed drop occurs. Ergo, defeating Rhydon with Bubble Beam can actually be quite difficult, so Bubble Beam should be seen as a way to encourage it to switch out and force Slash damage onto the opposing team.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Slash is the main reason Persian is viable, effectively ignoring Reflect thanks to its near-guaranteed critical hit rate. Body Slam is crucial against Reflect Snorlax; after two hits with Slash, the third will only KO 6.5% of the time, and Snorlax can simply use Rest, undoing your progress. However, Persian can fish for a critical hit with Body Slam to secure the KO, as Snorlax can’t afford to skip Rest. Additionally, Body Slam can fish for paralysis when Starmie switches in, potentially crippling it. Bubble Beam allows Persian to 2HKO Rhydon, and its Speed drop chance can occasionally help against faster switch-ins like Alakazam and Starmie, forcing them into a tricky situation.</p> <p>For the 4th move, Thunderbolt 3HKOes Cloyster and Slowbro, giving Persian a fighting chance against them. It also can critically hit Starmie, unlike Slash, providing Persian more offensive pressure, and it is a way to chip away at Gengar if it is asleep or at low HP. Growl gives Persian a way to handle Tauros. Persian is 2HKOed by Body Slam + Hyper Beam, but using Growl on the Hyper Beam turn prevents the KO unless Tauros critically hits, allowing Persian to retaliate with Slash and take it down. However, this tactic is somewhat predictable, and if the opponent anticipates it, they could simply use Body Slam instead. Still, Growl is enough to put Tauros in an awkward position in a matchup that is otherwise unfavorable for Persian. Growl can also be useful against Hyper Beam Snorlax depending on its remaining HP and helps prevent a Self-Destruct OHKO. Additionally, it can reapply a Speed drop to a paralyzed Pokemon, which is particularly useful against Starmie.</p> <p>Hyper Beam, meanwhile, allows Persian to finish off Pokemon like Starmie, Victreebel, and Chansey after Slash and provides a slight damage boost to secure KOs where Slash would otherwise fall short. It’s also a viable option for a final stand in a tight spot, with Persian’s critical hit rate giving it a chance to turn the tables in critical moments.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Poliwrath's ugly typing and unremarkable stats give it a lot of trouble in RBY OU, but access to the rare Amnesia gives it a real niche as a wallbreaker. Unlike Amnesia users such as Slowbro and Snorlax, Poliwrath lacks the stats and typing to become unbreakable, but its Speed gives it a niche over them. Poliwrath outspeeds Exeggutor and can nail it with Blizzard after some chip damage, rather than having to fear Sleep Powder and Explosion like the other Amnesia users in the tier. It also possesses immediate threats against Chansey in the form of Hypnosis and Submission, which OHKOes with a critical hit.</p> <p>However, while Poliwrath possesses these advantages over Slowbro, it suffers from all of Slowbro's flaws and more. It needs a lot of setup to break past Starmie and Chansey, which often threaten it with Thunderbolt, and it is vulnerable to Psychic, making Pokemon like Alakazam and Jynx much more problematic than they are for Slowbro. Like Slowbro, even after setting up, Poliwrath needs to watch for enemy Explosions that can stop the party before it even starts. Perhaps most importantly of all, Slowbro is able to heal itself throughout the game and provide utility thanks to superior defensive stats paired with Thunder Wave, while Poliwrath does not possess the bulk nor the movepool to be anything other than a one-time breaker.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Poliwrath's Hydro Pumps deal incredible damage after only a few turns of Amnesia, which it can often find against paralyzed or sleeping foes, and it is capable of taking down multiple Pokemon in a single game if its primary checks, usually Starmie and Chansey, are either KOed by teammates or statused and weakened enough to be handled by Poliwrath itself. While inconsistent, Poliwrath is a Pokemon that can lead to good results if you build towards its strengths.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Amnesia": {
          "description": "<p>Poliwrath's viability in OU revolves around the combination of Amnesia and Hydro Pump. All would-be checks fall to it if they allow enough free turns: Starmie has great odds to be 2HKOed at +4, Alakazam is 2HKOed at +2 and OHKOed at +6, and even Chansey cannot survive two +6 Hydro Pumps. Other Pokemon that may attempt to finish off a weakened or crippled Poliwrath are also significantly easier to take down with Hydro Pump than with Surf: Snorlax is OHKOed by +6 Hydro Pump but always stomachs a +6 Surf, while +4 is enough to drop Tauros. While the prospects of Hydro Pump's accuracy and PP will understandably scare players off, the favorable ranges this move reaches are simply too important.</p> <p>In the third slot, a tool against Exeggutor is highly recommended: Blizzard will hit for over half its HP after a single Amnesia, but if the team has no plans to put any other foes to sleep, then Hypnosis is also a valid way of threatening it, while also doubling as a way for Poliwrath to give itself free turns. For the last slot, many options are viable: Submission provides an immediate critical hit OHKO threat on Chansey, though the accuracy and recoil make it fairly inconsistent, while Surf's accuracy can be appreciated in specific scenarios where the extra damage from Hydro Pump is not required. Other options such as Body Slam, Counter, Psychic, and Rest can also have merits in very specific scenarios but are strongly discouraged, as they do not contribute to Poliwrath's primary purpose as a wallbreaker.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "tradebacksou": {
      "overview": "<p>Alakazam received some serious upgrades in Tradebacks OU, gaining the elemental punches to give it coverage outside of Seismic Toss. However, its usual roles remain: Alakazam is a strong lead, revenge killer, and paralysis support guru thanks to its exceptional Speed—allowing it to outrun even Persian—a trait which also gives it a fantastic critical hit rate. Indeed, Alakazam's offense allows it to close out end games very quickly if left unparalyzed. With effectively no weaknesses thanks to its typing, Alakazam has notable defensive utility; it can switch into Pokemon like Chansey and opposing Psychic-types like Starmie, Hypno, and opposing Alakazam. These traits culminate to form a strong, multi-faceted threat that can be used at any stage of the game with few truly losing matchups.</p> <p>However, Alakazam is not flawless, as its physical bulk is very poor. If paralyzed, while it's an amazing sleep blocker thereafter, it's also very vulnerable to Pokemon like Snorlax, Tauros, and Persian, which eat it alive. Furthermore, Psychic's PP only goes so far, and this is what defines Alakazam: it must be used conservatively. Alakazam has a very difficult time breaking past the mandatory Chansey without a mix of full paralysis, critical hits, and Special drops, and even if it succeeds, it's not going to sweep thereafter. Alakazam also finds itself cancelled out by opposing Psychic-types, which, similar to Chansey, often goad it into prolonged interactions that leave it with little attacking PP thereafter.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alakazam's movepool is deeper than it seems, making customization very possible. Generally, Psychic and Recover should never be dropped, as they are the roots of its power and longevity. Sets using two of Seismic Toss, Thunder Punch, and Ice Punch are possible if dropping Thunder Wave, but this significantly reduces its threat level against Pokemon like Tauros, which become capable of trading hits with it once the set is revealed. All things considered, Alakazam's single coverage moveslot is the most droppable, and anything further than that is ill-advised.</p> <p>Barrier is a significant upgrade to the classic Reflect Alakazam set from regular RBY OU, letting Alakazam stack Defense buffs and reapply the Speed drop from Thunder Wave paralysis. These traits make it a lot stronger against Pokemon like Snorlax long-term, and because it can reapply the paralysis Speed drop, its own paralysis-absorbing antics are far more effective. However, all of this comes with a crucial caveat: it has to drop its coverage, leaving it with just 16 attacking PP in Psychic, which is generally undesirable in a metagame with high bulk and lots of recovery. If its checks are removed, though, Barrier Alakazam can spark endgame scenarios that are very difficult for opponents to dig out of.</p> <p>Counter gives Alakazam more utility against opposing Seismic Toss Alakazam, severely damaging it if it lands. It also has utility against Pokemon like Snorlax, which can't OHKO Alakazam without extremely strong attacks like Hyper Beam. Outside of this, bringing in Alakazam after a Pokemon like Tauros has KOed something to threaten paralysis and instead go for Counter allows it to severely damage a switch-in, possibly even landing a free KO.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Alakazam's low physical bulk makes it highly vulnerable to physical attacks if paralyzed. Tauros, Persian, Rhydon, and Snorlax all mortally threaten it on this front, especially if switching in on a recovery turn. If Alakazam has taken even minor damage, all of these Pokemon are capable of threatening it with a KO.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Because it relies on Psychic, Alakazam tends to find itself in awkward situations against opposing Psychic-types, with them often cancelling each other out. While its elemental punches can allow it to specialize in defeating Starmie or Exeggutor quickly, it can still find itself walled due to the hole in its coverage, and prolonged interactions involving Seismic Toss can result in it being taken out by repeated full paralysis. Surf variants of Starmie can be particularly dicey, with critical hits dealing massive damage. Plus, if the opposing team has more than one Psychic-type, or a Chansey to go with it, the opponent can mitigate Special drops from Psychic by switching between them.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is a royal pain for Alakazam, healing off any damage Alakazam dishes out thanks to its monstrous special bulk and access to Soft-Boiled. In lead situations, Chansey also likes to switch in on turn 1 to take paralysis and put Alakazam to sleep. However, even with just Psychic, Alakazam can force its way through with a mix of critical hits, Special drops, and repeated full paralysis, albeit with a significant hit to its attacking PP.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor resists Psychic and is often willing to take paralysis if it means putting Alakazam to sleep. If Alakazam isn't running Seismic Toss or Ice Punch, Exeggutor also shrugs off any damage taken, giving it more opportunities to incapacitate Alakazam.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro would love nothing more than to trade a Thunder Wave with Alakazam, set up Amnesia to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis to become faster, and than just blow past and deal massive damage to the opposing team. If Alakazam has Thunder Punch, it can often win out short-term with a 3HKO or win out later with critical hits. Seismic Toss also works for forcing Slowbro to use Rest, which leaves it open for a stronger attacker to come in and force Slowbro out.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Alakazam's Psychic is nothing to scoff at, dealing massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it, with Alakazam's high critical hit rate and Psychic's chance for a Special drop frequently able to turn 3HKO ranges into 2HKOs frequently. Psychic can potentially 2HKO Rhydon, Persian, and even Tauros if either occurs. Alakazam's Speed makes its Thunder Wave largely uncontested in many instances, forcing slower Pokemon like Starmie and Gengar out if they wish to remain threatening later. Recover's 32 PP gives Alakazam excellent longevity, ensuring it can remain offensively threatening for long periods of time.</p> <p>The choice of coverage for Alakazam in Tradebacks OU requires a good bit of forethought. Seismic Toss remains its most consistent option: its fixed damage and the low HP of opposing Alakazam and Starmie mean it should win most interactions against foes that resist Psychic. It also makes Exeggutor far more inclined to use Explosion if even one connects, as it lacks recovery. Ice Punch functions similarly, improving Alakazam's matchups against Exeggutor, Rhydon, Zapdos, and Dragonite. It can also let Alakazam fish for freeze against Chansey, though it's unreliable against it due to the possibility of Alakazam being overwhelmed by repeated full paralysis and Seismic Toss. Thunder Punch allows Alakazam to be far stronger against Starmie, 2HKOing it with even a tiny bit of prior chip damage. It also improves Alakazam's matchups against Lapras, Cloyster, Articuno, and the niche Vapeoreon. However, if running the new elemental punches, Alakazam will always lose to something unless it drops its trusty Thunder Wave: running Psychic + Thunder Punch means it loses to Exeggutor, while Psychic + Ice Punch means it loses to Starmie and gets set up on by Slowbro and Vaporeon. Simply put, these moves improve its consistency in some matchups but forfeit others, so they should be used in cases where a less consistent but more potent Alakazam is affordable.</p> <p>Alakazam makes for a strong lead, as it can paralyze virtually any target before they can make a move, something notably effective when paired with physical sleepers like Snorlax and Persian, which can break through paralyzed Psychic-types and Chansey. Gengar and Persian tend to be forced out; if it isn't for the Thunder Wave, it's for Alakazam's devastating Psychic. In some situations it can force out opposing Starmie, which might want to avoid getting paralyzed. This is usually to Chansey, which absorbs Thunder Wave well and can threaten with Sing thereafter. If faced with a sleep lead like Jynx, Alakazam is content with taking sleep, as it can wake up against opposing Psychic-types like Exeggutor, Hypno, and non-Seismic Toss Alakazam. Against sleep lead Alakazam has a positive matchup against, such as Gengar and Persian, Alakazam is best off using Thunder Wave and pressuring the switch-in or double switching into a sleeper. Chansey is also relatively easy to wake up on if it lacks Seismic Toss. Given its speed and power, Alakazam is also usable in the back as a strong late-game cleaner. The elemental punches let Alakazam excel here so long as its teammates remove its checks. Starmie makes for a strong partner here, making use of the coverage Alakazam lacks to form a concentrated offensive core with a strong backbone. In the case Alakazam is used in the back, it should avoid paralysis in most situations, but adapting Alakazam's role to the situation at hand is essential for succeeding with it.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Alakazam's great typing and stellar base stats give it the most threatening Psychic in the tier and more Speed than every viable Pokemon bar Jolteon. Even with Stadium's changes, it maintains a 19.1% critical hit rate; in conjunction with paralysis and Special drops, this allows Psychic to eventually break through even Chansey and Psychic-resistant foes. Alakazam has exceptional moves in Thunder Wave and Recover, granting it considerable utility against most threats. Alakazam can serve as a status spreader, special wall, and potential sweeper; its Speed allows it to use Substitute to block Thunder Waves and preserve its sweeping potential. It can also function well when paralyzed, as it becomes a reasonable status absorber. A paralyzed Alakazam has its limits, however—physical threats like Snorlax and Tauros can outspeed and 2HKO it or set up Substitute to thwart its Thunder Wave.  Alakazam faces another obstacle in the pervasive Rest Exeggutor, which can stall out its Seismic Toss and threaten it with Stun Spore and Double-Edge. Nevertheless, Alakazam is an extremely common sight thanks to its versatility and support capability.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reflect is a shaky alternative to Substitute; its benefits are outweighed by the fact it doesn't protect Alakazam from critical hits or status. Counter theoretically allows Alakazam to surprise physical attackers, but mechanics changes in Stadium reduce its utility. Alakazam's low HP also means it will rarely OHKO attackers and risks Body Slam paralysis, neutering it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Once Alakazam is paralyzed, Snorlax, Tauros, Rhydon, Persian, Kangaskhan, and other physically potent threats can switch in on Recover and threaten Alakazam. None of these like taking Psychics, though, and most despise Thunder Wave. However, attempting to paralyze physical Pokemon is risky once they are already in, as they can potentially block it with Substitute and become even more difficult to stop.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggutor and Slowbro both check Alakazam; Exeggutor can threaten it with Double-Edge and Stun Spore, while Slowbro can set up Amnesia freely. Both also carry Rest to thwart Thunder Wave and heal off Seismic Toss. Despite this, Seismic Toss will eventually force them to use Rest, providing opportunities to pressure them with other attackers. Starmie and opposing Alakazam can also hamstring Alakazam with Thunder Wave, stall it with Recover, or force it to Recover and switch to a physical attacker, potentially catching Alakazam as it fully paralyzes. However, this comes at a cost, as Starmie and Alakazam will almost certainly be paralyzed in the process.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's special bulk and access to instant recovery in Soft-Boiled allows it to sponge multiple Psychics from Alakazam, giving it room to use Thunder Wave or inflict chip damage so a physical teammate can switch in on its Recover. With some luck, though, Alakazam can break through paralyzed Chansey, particularly if it is already chipped prior to switching in. Chansey especially has trouble against Substitute Alakazam if it lacks Seismic Toss, as none of its other moves are capable of breaking Substitute in one hit.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Psychic is a threat to any non-resistant Pokemon—even Chansey cannot withstand extended exposure if it is paralyzed. Thunder Wave is irreplacable, as paralysis is what allows Alakazam to break down Chansey and opposing Psychic-types. Unlike in RBY, however, Substitute blocks Thunder Wave, making it a risky move if Alakazam is paralyzed itself—fast physical users like Tauros, Persian, and Kangaskhan become much more threatening if given the opportunity to set it up. Recover lets Alakazam heal off damage, but can invite in physical attackers if Alakazam is paralyzed. Seismic Toss is strongly recommended, as it allows Alakazam to pressure opposing Psychic-types effectively while saving Psychic PP, but Substitute can be used instead to protect Alakazam from status moves and critical hits, making it an effective late-game sweeper if opposing Psychic-types are removed. Chansey cannot break Substitute in one hit without Seismic Toss, so Alakazam can pressure BoltBeam Chansey safely. Furthermore, Substitute can help Alakazam PP stall some foes more effectively, as Alakazam won't be vulnerable to secondary effects from damaging moves when using it. Unfortunately, Substitute Alakazam itself is much easier to PP stall by switching between Psychic-types and Chansey to waste PP.</p> <p>Alakazam is better used in the back, but as a lead it sports fair matchups against Chansey and the rare Jynx, as it can paralyze them with Thunder Wave and then proceed to pressure them with Psychic or Seismic Toss. Unfortunately, Exeggutor is the most common lead and fares well against it, as Exeggutor can scout for Substitute with Double-Edge and hamstring it with Stun Spore when it is forced to use Recover. Snorlax performs well against Alakazam too; Body Slam 2HKOes and threatens paralysis simultaneously. Alakazam can choose to take paralysis and become a decent status absorber, providing an avenue to protect teammates like Reflect Chansey from paralysis so it can switch into and wall Snorlax for Alakazam. However, this forfeits its excellent Speed. Unparalyzed Alakazam can revenge kill fast offensive threats like Tauros, Zapdos, and the rare Persian, threaten them with Thunder Wave, and act as a sweeper.</p> <p>Psychic's ability to break past paralyzed Chansey can provide an opportunity for Alakazam to paralyze a Pokemon when Chansey switches out or use Seismic Toss to pressure paralyzed Psychic-types as they enter. In an Alakazam mirror match, the typical strategy is to paralyze the opposing Alakazam, use Seismic Toss to chip it down, and switch out to a physical attacker when it is expected to use Recover. Unlike in RBY, Special drops from Psychic no longer reapply the paralysis Speed penalty, so there is little reason to waste Psychic PP in the mirror match. The threat of Thunder Wave puts pressure on fast Pokemon, such as Starmie and Tauros, to switch out to a paralyzed teammate or Chansey to absorb it. While this means Alakazam will rarely paralyze multiple Pokemon, it can use Psychic or Seismic Toss instead to pressure and potentially overwhelm these status absorbers as they come in, or it can switch out to a physical threat that can deal significantly higher immediate damage to them, like Snorlax.</p> <p>Alakazam works well with teammates that can deal with other Psychic-types and Chansey. Zapdos' STAB moves 2HKO Starmie, Slowbro, and the omnipresent Exeggutor; Zapdos also 3HKOes Chansey and opposing Alakazam. In return, Alakazam can threaten Rhydon and take Psychic and Ice-type moves for Zapdos. Tauros and Persian can threaten most of Alakazam's walls, though care must be taken with them, as they despise being paralyzed. Notably, Persian 3HKOes Exeggutor with Slash, allowing it to switch in on its Rest and KO it or force it out. Alakazam returns the favor by providing valuable paralysis support and dealing with Gengar. Alakazam also appreciates teammates that can switch into physical attackers. Cloyster walls Snorlax and Tauros lacking Thunderbolt, 2HKOes Exeggutor with Blizzard, and leaves Starmie in OHKO range with Explosion. Gengar is another excellent partner, as it can wall Snorlax and Tauros should they lack Earthquake. Offensively, it carries a strong Thunderbolt to hit Starmie and Slowbro, and its Explosion can be used to deal significant damage to Chansey.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>In a generation where Psychic-type attacks are only resisted by the same type, and because its only weakness may as well not exist, it's not surprising that Alakazam is an incredible threat in RBY OU. Alakazam is most commonly seen in the lead slot due to possessing excellent Speed and access to Thunder Wave; it outspeeds every Pokemon that has access to a sleep move, allowing it to immediately cripple them with paralysis. It also has the strongest Psychic in OU by virtue of its excellent Special and as such can heavily pressure its most common checks. This Special stat also makes it a decent sponge for opposing moves like Psychic, though its HP limits this slightly. It is also good at absorbing sleep, since it resists Exeggutor's Psychic. Unlike Starmie, Alakazam doesn't have a weakness to Thunderbolt, which can come in handy for absorbing sleep from the likes of Gengar and Lapras. Alakazam can also prove to be very effective outside the lead slot, maintaining excellent utility against various threats and potentially turning into a dangerous sweeper if its most common checks have been removed. However, it can be difficult to consistently keep Alakazam safe from paralysis; if paralyzed, Alakazam often finds its low Defense being exploited by strong physical attackers such as Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros. It's also very reliant on its Psychic, which means it is difficult to break past Chansey. Overall, Alakazam is a regular presence in RBY OU and one of the best Psychic-types available, but its extreme vulnerability to strong physical attacks and paralysis keeps it firmly below the top of the pyramid.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave, Psychic, and Recover should never be dropped. Though the last move is somewhat flexible, Alakazam's movepool is very shallow, so it should generally stick to the options mentioned. Counter has some utility when forcing out threats after the opponent KOed one of your Pokemon with a hard-hitting Normal-type attack from high health, such as Explosion, Self-Destruct, or Hyper Beam. This can be used to force damage against whatever switches in or even outright KO it. It also has situational use in Alakazam mirrors, as countering Seismic Toss can leave the opposing Alakazam severely weakened.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon can hit Alakazam through its weak Defense and KO it, especially if it's paralyzed. They should try to switch in on Recover, though, as Psychic will do a big chunk of damage to all of them. Snorlax deserves a special mention for early-game, as it's crippled way less by paralysis and Psychic damage than the other Pokemon mentioned. Rhydon can also switch in on Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Almost all Psychic-types can check Alakazam, although most of them can be broken through with paralysis and Special drops. Although it generally should not come out early-game, Slowbro is particularly dangerous, as it can set up on Alakazam safely and heal its paralysis with Rest. Starmie and opposing Alakazam can also take Alakazam's Psychic and Seismic Toss and threaten it in return with their own attacks and paralysis, but these matchups can swing either way with repeated full paralysis or Special drops from either side. Surf variants of Starmie are especially dangerous, as they can deal heavy damage to Alakazam. Jynx can be used to check Alakazam in an emergency, but it is passive when doing so, vulnerable to critical hits, and better used for other tasks.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Alakazam is a special attacker, and like all special attackers, Chansey makes a decent check. Chansey can attempt to paralyze Alakazam and pressure with Seismic Toss and to a lesser extent Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. This can force Alakazam to heal with Recover, allowing the opponent to switch into a physical threat. However, due to Psychic's secondary effect, paralysis, and Alakazam's high critical hit rate, Chansey will eventually be forced to either use Soft-Boiled or switch out. Should it get unlucky with full paralysis when trying to use Soft-Boiled, it can even be KOed. It's common to see Chansey switch in on a lead Alakazam and take a Thunder Wave to block sleep later. It can then attempt to put Alakazam to sleep with Sing on the next turn. Chansey can also attempt to fish for a freeze with Ice Beam if Alakazam isn't paralyzed, though this is risky.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch into Alakazam on Turn 1 to immediately try to put it to sleep. However, the opponent would need to be content taking paralysis and getting hit by at least one Seismic Toss, which reduces the longevity of Exeggutor. This makes it much worse at checking Rhydon later in the game. If you try to prevent Alakazam from being paralyzed by switching to Chansey, the opponent gains a huge advantage, as Exeggutor can outspeed Chansey and put it to sleep. In general, though, Exeggutor checks Alakazam well. However, it struggles to pressure Alakazam enough before getting worn down by Seismic Toss, often forcing it to use Explosion.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Alakazam is one of the best leads in RBY OU. Since it's the fastest lead that regularly sees use, it's almost guaranteed to be able to immediately cripple something from the start of the game, be it through paralysis or serious damage with Psychic. This means Alakazam is great for pressuring opposing leads. Against other Alakazam, one generally wants to paralyze it and try to get a physical attacker like Snorlax in on a predicted Recover. However, be careful to not leave the field too damaged, as Exeggutor can have Double-Edge or Hyper Beam to pressure Alakazam. Generally, you don't want to switch out at less than 80% in order for Alakazam to avoid the 2HKO from Exeggutor's Double-Edge most of the time. Gengar leads generally switch out against Alakazam due to the threat of a 2HKO from Psychic as well as an OHKO with a critical hit. Starmie should generally be approached the same way as an opposing Alakazam. However, one must be wary of Chansey when using Thunder Wave early on; its extreme bulk turns it into a phenomenal sleep blocker when paralyzed. As a result, it becomes very difficult to put anything to sleep until the now-paralyzed Chansey is KOed.</p> <p>A lead Alakazam's role, besides crippling the opposing lead, is mostly to absorb sleep. If used in this fashion, Alakazam should absolutely be running Seismic Toss. This allows Alakazam to hit Starmie and Exeggutor rather than waste Psychic's PP. Lead Alakazam can also be used to absorb paralysis from those who propagate it, such as Chansey, Starmie, and other Alakazam. This especially goes for Chansey without Seismic Toss. It's also effective against Starmie without Surf or Psychic, the latter of which can force Alakazam out after a few Special drops. Alakazam also tends to attract physical attackers like Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon on a forced Recover turn. If you can correctly predict the switch, you might be able to sneak in a Thunder Wave or Psychic on them. Moreover, due to Alakazam being one of the few pure special attackers that can force Chansey out, it is also an efficient paralysis spreader that can be used as such throughout the course of the battle.</p> <p>In some situations, you might still resort to using non-lead Alakazam as if it were in the lead slot to check or pressure opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Starmie. It can also be used to function as a sweeper late-game. This strategy revolves around keeping Alakazam hidden, then attempting to clean up once its checks have been removed. Reflect can be used on sweeper Alakazam to give it a much-needed Defense boost, but it also means Alakazam will only have Psychic to attack with. In addition, Reflect Alakazam can still be taken care of through paralysis, critical hits from Tauros and Zapdos, and Explosion. Explosion is especially pressing if paralyzed, as even if Reflect Alakazam survives, it's still easily revenge killed by threats such as Tauros. However, Seismic Toss remains very usable in this context for beating Starmie and other Psychic-types more consistently.</p> <p>When using Alakazam as a sweeper, the rest of the team should work on removing Alakazam's checks before it's revealed. These checks include special sponges such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Pokemon that resist Psychic, such as Slowbro and Exeggutor, are also important to remove. For maintaining maximum sweeping potential, Alakazam should also try to avoid paralysis as much as possible, as its Speed is the reason it's able to compete with other late-game sweepers for a team slot. Ideally, Tauros should also be put in range of Psychic to avoid its high critical hit rate and Body Slam's paralysis chance. Fortunately, that can easily be accomplished through a Tauros mirror, a common scenario in RBY OU battles, since two Body Slams will leave the opponent's Tauros in said range.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>With STAB Fighting-type haymakers at its disposal, Machamp can look enticing to the average player. Being as fast as Exeggutor ensures it edges out and 2HKOes Chansey with even Low Kick, which many Pokemon simply cannot achieve. Similarly, Machamp has the potential to give Tauros and Snorlax trouble, albeit to a lesser extent due to a deathly fear of paralysis. It's also got some fair physical bulk and a handy resistance to Rock Slide, allowing it to switch into and threaten Rhydon. This boils down to solidifying Machamp as a straightforward attacker that benefits strongly from paralysis support.</p> <p>Machamp's main problem is that while nearly every team includes the \"Big 3\" Normal-types — which Machamp can excel against in a flat one-on-one — a Psychic-type usually isn't far behind them. Machamp simply can't deal with Psychic-types, often failing to muster even a 2HKO on most and taking massive damage in return. Ergo, while Machamp hits like a freight train, it offers little defensive utility, which often opens gaping holes in its team. Additionally, Machamp despises paralysis, as what little Speed it has is what ensures it can threaten the Normal-types it wants to go after. When looking for a Pokemon to pummel paralyzed teams, Rhydon is often a better choice, possessing much greater defensive utility, immunity to Thunder Wave, and generally superior STAB moves. Machamp is thus a rare sight in RBY OU and generally isn't recommended.</p>",

          "description": "<p>STAB Low Kick may seem unassuming, but its 30.1% flinch rate in RBY makes Machamp excellent at bullying paralyzed Pokemon, making up for its mediocre defensive stats. Thanks to this, Machamp can potentially 2HKO a paralyzed Chansey — a very common sight in RBY OU — before it can muster a response. Alternatively, Submission can be used for more power, allowing Machamp to 2HKO Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, albeit at the cost of significant recoil. Body Slam lets Machamp be a little more self-sufficient, paralyzing potential switch-ins to turn the tables on them. Hyper Beam is Machamp's strongest Normal-type attack, allowing it to KO Pokemon that otherwise shrug off its STAB move. Alakazam is a noteworthy target, as it can end up being 2HKOed switching in if it's paralyzed by Body Slam first. Finally, Earthquake ensures Machamp isn't completely helpless against Gengar, 2HKOing it and Jolteon.</p> <p>Machamp has a wide offensive movepool, allowing it to fine-tune itself to fit a team. Using both Submission and Low Kick can let Machamp 2HKO Tauros, allowing it to more cleanly win a one-on-one interaction. Fire Blast deals up to 34.6% to Exeggutor with a high burn rate that can ruin its Explosion. Counter can be effective with Machamp's stat line, allowing it to switch in on a Hyper Beam and score a guaranteed OHKO on Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax. This also applies when switching into Snorlax's Body Slam and Chansey's Seismic Toss; both Pokemon will often switch out in response, allowing Machamp to severely damage the switch-in. Since Machamp struggles a bit against Reflect Chansey, Karate Chop can be a serviceable option, being what's effectively a 100-Base Power Normal-type move that ignores Reflect thanks to its near-guaranteed critical hit rate. Unfortunately, Machamp's Speed leaves Karate Chop short of the 99.6% cap, making it a tad inconsistent. Finally, Rock Slide can be used for better matchups against Articuno and Zapdos, but it falls short of 2HKOing the latter, which makes it questionable.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Victreebel finds a niche in RBY Ubers thanks to its decent Speed and access to Wrap, dual status moves in Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, and a strong STAB Razor Leaf. Wrap makes it tricky for paralyzed Pokemon to block sleep, as Victreebel can use Wrap on them for free chip damage. Wrap can also make Victreebel dangerous late-game, heavily punishing teams that allow paralysis to spread throughout their Pokemon, as well as teams with many slow Pokemon, such as Snorlax, Chansey, Exeggutor, and Rhydon. Victreebel also enjoys the lower usage Alakazam and Starmie have compared to OU, as outspeeding and paralyzing it is one of the most consistent ways to take it out.</p> <p>However, Victreebel has several flaws that prevent it from being one of the top threats in the metagame. Wrap is only 85% accurate, which is troublesome, since Victreebel often needs to hit Wrap multiple times in a row, and one miss can get Victreebel paralyzed, effectively making it useless. Although its Speed is decent, it is still outsped by Mewtwo, Mew, Tauros, and Zapdos. This generally means Victreebel needs heavy paralysis support to function. Unparalyzed Mewtwo in particular is a terrible matchup for Victreebel, as it threatens both Thunder Wave and STAB Psychic. Mew carries Thunder Wave often, and Tauros threatens Body Slam paralysis. Victreebel is also completely blanked by Gengar, which is immune to Wrap and has a resistance to Razor Leaf. However, Victreebel still is able to threaten all of these Pokemon with status moves. Lastly, Victreebel faces competition from Pokemon like Exeggutor and Chansey as sleepers and from Dragonite as a wrapper.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Victreebel has seen fringe use as a lead, as it outspeeds Exeggutor and Hypno leads while still having access to a reliable way to spread paralysis in Stun Spore, which other fast sleep leads like Jynx and Gengar don't have. However, Victreebel struggles against faster leads such as Jynx, Gengar, Zapdos, and Mewtwo, making this quite niche.</p> <p>Victreebel can opt for a Swords Dance set, generally forgoing Wrap and Razor Leaf for Swords Dance and one of Body Slam or Hyper Beam. This set is able to put a foe to sleep then set up Swords Dance the next turn. If a faster foe, such as Mewtwo, tries to revenge kill this Victreebel set, it can sacrifice itself and use Stun Spore. However, this set is walled by Rhydon and Gengar, and Wrap is a huge part of Victreebel's viability, so it is difficult to justify dropping.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo gives Victreebel immense trouble, dealing a minimum of 73.5% with Psychic and only being 5HKOed in return with Razor Leaf. Many Mewtwo sets also carry Thunder Wave, which ruins Victreebel. Although trading status with Mewtwo is generally a good trade for Victreebel, Mewtwo's 25.39% critical-hit rate as well as Sleep Powder and Stun Spore's poor accuracy means Victreebel can easily be KOed without landing a status move.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Once paralyzed, Victreebel is generally deadweight, as Wrap relies heavily on it outspeeding foes. This makes a Wrap miss fatal against foes with Thunder Wave, such as Chansey. Even if the foe is also paralyzed, a paralyzed Victreebel's Wrap accuracy is effectively 63.75%, which is extremely unreliable considering Wrap needs to hit multiple times in a row.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Since Wrap relies heavily on Victreebel outspeeding a foe, faster Pokemon such as Zapdos, Alakazam, Jynx, Mewtwo, and Mew give Victreebel trouble. Although Victreebel can threaten them with Stun Spore, many faster Pokemon can paralyze Victreebel back, preventing it from taking advantage of Wrap. Although uncommon, Articuno deserves a special mention, as it is great not only against Victreebel but also its common teammates, such as Dragonite and mono-Earthquake Thunder Wave Mew.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Wrap and takes pitiful damage from Razor Leaf, making it a hard counter to Victreebel. However, Gengar hates getting paralyzed by Stun Spore, and Victreebel can still use Wrap to pivot on Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Ice-type moves run rampant in RBY Ubers, which Victreebel does not enjoy. Although it can comfortably wrap foes like Chansey, it has trouble switching in due to the threat of Ice Beam. This also makes Victreebel's matchup with Cloyster quite swingy. Although Victreebel 2HKOes it with Razor Leaf, Cloyster Speed ties with and 2HKOes it in return with Blizzard. Using Wrap on a paralyzed Pokemon like Articuno is also risky, since Victreebel gets hit hard by Blizzard if it misses.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: If Victreebel is running a Swords Dance set that lacks Razor Leaf, it is walled by Rhydon. However, the threat of Razor Leaf means the opponent will not send Rhydon in on Victreebel until all of its moves are revealed. Rhydon can also help PP stall Wrap if necessary thanks to its resistance to the move, though a Wrap miss is bad for Rhydon, since Victreebel can follow up with Razor Leaf.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Wrap": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Sleep Powder in conjunction with Wrap makes Victreebel effective at forcing a foe to sleep. If a paralyzed Pokemon attempts to block Victreebel's Sleep Powder, then Victreebel can use Wrap to chip and force out the paralyzed foe and threaten sleep again. Victreebel's ability to push sleep past paralyzed Pokemon allows its teammates to spread paralysis before Victreebel lands Sleep Powder. Stun Spore allows Victreebel to spread paralysis after landing Sleep Powder, which is useful on faster foes such as Tauros and Mew. Razor Leaf lets Victreebel OHKO the Normal-resistant Rhydon and deal massive damage to Water-types, such as Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro. It is also a great tool at damaging neutral targets like Snorlax. Razor Leaf's near-guaranteed critical hit chance means it can bypass the Special boost from Mewtwo and Slowbro's Amnesia as well, although Victreebel should usually only do this if Mewtwo is already paralyzed and at low HP.</p> <p>Victreebel generally has trouble switching in due to a poor defensive typing and fear of getting paralyzed. It most commonly finds entry on a double switch or a predicted recovery turn from Chansey, Mew, or paralyzed Mewtwo. This is still risky, though, as a missed prediction can result in Victreebel taking paralysis or heavy damage. Victreebel's easiest entry point is on a Pokemon using Rest, such as Snorlax or Slowbro. However, Rest on Snorlax is uncommon in Ubers, making this hard to come by. In dire situations, Victreebel can switch directly into Body Slam from Snorlax or Earthquake from Rhydon, but the paralysis chance of the former and heavy damage of the latter make this option a last resort.</p> <p>Victreebel can use Wrap as a pivoting tool, switching out while the foe is immobilized so that Victreebel's teammates can hit the field safely. Though all of Victreebel's teammates appreciate being able to switch for free, those that have good offensive potential but trouble switching into moves, such as Tauros and Rhydon, benefit most heavily from this. Victreebel can also use Wrap's chip damage to get Pokemon into certain ranges for its teammates, such as getting Mewtwo into KO range of Snorlax's Self-Destruct, Water-types such as Starmie and Slowbro into KO range of Victreebel's own Razor Leaf, or Snorlax into KO range of +4 Mewtwo's Psychic.</p> <p>Victreebel's best teammates are those that can spread paralysis throughout an opposing team, as this enables its Wrap antics. Thunder Wave variants of Mew and Mewtwo are great teammates for Victreebel, since their high damage output often forces the opponent's Mew or Mewtwo in, which they can then paralyze. Zapdos is also an effective paralysis spreader, making it a good teammate. Victreebel helps Zapdos against Rhydon; although Victreebel cannot directly switch in, its Razor Leaf threatens Rhydon immensely. Chansey is able to switch into Alakazam, Starmie, and unboosted Mewtwo and threaten paralysis, while Slowbro can switch into Mewtwo sets that lack Thunderbolt. Dragonite can be used with Victreebel for a more Wrap-dedicated teamstyle, allowing Victreebel and Dragonite to enable each other and tear apart paralyzed teams. However, it is important to note that using Victreebel and Dragonite together stacks weaknesses to Ice-type moves, so having teammates that alleviate this is important.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Victreebel got lucky in RBY OU. It lacks obvious strengths, having just decent offensive capabilities, mediocre bulk, and a lousy typing. However, Victreebel has several useful tools that allow it to exploit certain metagame trends. Thanks to its average Speed and access to Wrap and Sleep Powder, Victreebel is able to keep itself safe while bullying the tier's slowest staples, like Exeggutor, Chansey, and Snorlax. Likewise, anything paralyzed is liable to fall victim to Victreebel's repetitive Wraps. Victreebel also has a powerful Razor Leaf that can deal hefty damage to several key Pokemon, like Starmie, Slowbro, Lapras, and Rhydon, the last of which it will always OHKO. Victreebel has plenty of other toys to play with as well, such as Stun Spore and Swords Dance. These traits make Victreebel a menace against slower teams and teams that have mismanaged paralysis. It is undoubtedly one of the best Pokemon for closing games against weakened teams.</p> <p>Victreebel, however, has numerous flaws that have reduced it to more of a niche threat than a tier staple in recent times. In the modern metagame, teams are typically much faster than they were in the past and leads like Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx are more inclined to switch early on and dodge paralysis. While Chansey is very likely to become paralyzed over the course of the game, Victreebel may find it difficult to pressure anything else, and its mere presence is often an invitation for fast Psychic-type Pokemon. Additionally, the slight decrease in Exeggutor usage has been to Victreebel's detriment. Although the two compete as sleepers, Exeggutor's reduced role in the metagame has contributed to faster teams and reduced the presence of a prime Pokemon Victreebel can dominate with Sleep Powder or Wrap. Other more general issues include Victreebel's horrendous weaknesses to Ice and Psychic, vulnerability to paralysis, inability to threaten Gengar, and poor consistency, due to the imperfect accuracy of virtually every move it uses, most notably Wrap. Finally, while its defensive stats are somewhat workable, its mediocre Speed, poor typing, and lack of recovery make it deceptively frail; Tauros will typically KO Victreebel with a Blizzard followed by a Hyper Beam, for example.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam is Victreebel’s most notable alternative option for either set. The decent Base Power and paralysis chance allow Victreebel to punish switch-ins without committing to moves like Stun Spore and Sleep Powder, which can potentially be blocked by a statused Pokemon or just miss. However, the middling payoff and rather high value of Victreebel’s moveslots make it a rare sight. Double-Edge can potentially be run on the Swords Dance set for additional power without risking a Hyper Beam recharge turn, but it is generally outclassed by the utility moves that give Victreebel its niche. Toxic is another possible option on the standard set because it pairs well with Wrap, causing damage to accumulate much more quickly. Once again, however, Victreebel seldom has room to run a move like this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Victreebel is incapacitated by paralysis. With all of its healthy foes faster than it, Victreebel will no longer be able to use Wrap to pressure slower targets and pivot. Additionally, Wrap will hit only a mere 66% of the time once Victreebel is paralyzed, making it an inconsistent option even against paralyzed targets. Likewise, the imperfect accuracies of Razor Leaf, Hyper Beam, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore are exacerbated by the chance for full paralysis. Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will typically try to use Thunder Wave to dispatch Victreebel as fast as possible, and slower Pokemon like Chansey and Exeggutor will be happy to punish any Wrap misses with Thunder Wave and Stun Spore, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is a hard counter to Victreebel. Aside from status moves, Victreebel is incapable of threatening Gengar at all, as it takes no damage from Wrap or Hyper Beam and very little from Razor Leaf. Gengar, on the other hand, can put Victreebel to sleep or quickly KO it with Night Shade or the occasional Psychic. Wrap still immobilizes Gengar despite not doing any damage, allowing Victreebel to pivot to a teammate, so Gengar can’t switch in entirely for free.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon tend to be strong answers to Victreebel. Zapdos is by far the most common and can easily dispatch Victreebel with Thunder Wave or 2HKO it with Drill Peck. Unless Victreebel is partnered with Rhydon or Golem, Zapdos is very likely to claim a KO if it gets the chance to face Victreebel. Articuno and Moltres also outspeed and can 2HKO Victreebel with Blizzard and Fire Blast, respectively. All three Pokemon also have impressive bulk, so they can survive even a +2 Hyper Beam if necessary. Dragonite is also a rather sturdy check, as it shrugs off most of Victreebel’s moves and can inhibit it with Thunder Wave or its own Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Psychic and Ice-type Moves</strong>: Psychic and Ice-type moves deal hefty damage to Victreebel, typically scoring a 2HKO. Alakazam, Starmie, and Jynx all outspeed Victreebel and can 2HKO it with Psychic or Blizzard. Slower Pokemon can also harshly punish misses and poor switches from Victreebel. Exeggutor and Lapras both score 2HKOs with their super effective STAB moves, though the latter takes a lot from Razor Leaf. Chansey can also get a 3HKO with Ice Beam. Cloyster is an incredibly awkward matchup, as the two Speed tie and 2HKO each other with their STAB moves, with Victreebel potentially getting the KO outright if Cloyster has sustained even the slightest chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Victreebel has difficulty threatening Pokemon faster than it, as it typically cannot stay in and use Wrap safely. Essentially every common Pokemon faster than Victreebel has the potential to simply wait out Victreebel’s Wrap turns, provided it doesn't switch out, and eventually punish it with a super effective attack or paralysis. Victreebel can typically weaken these Pokemon before going down, such as hitting Starmie with Razor Leaf or Tauros with Stun Spore, but these matchup are generally losing for Victreebel overall.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its middling Speed, Victreebel can threaten about half of the tier with Sleep Powder. In general, Victreebel is most effective as a sleeper when it can get in against a slower foe with minimal risk. For example, when Chansey is likely to use Soft-Boiled or Snorlax is about to wake up from Rest, Victreebel can usually sneak in and use Sleep Powder. Likewise, if a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Slowbro is likely to come in, Victreebel can usually find an entry point. From there, Victreebel can pivot with Wrap or pressure slower Pokemon like Snorlax with Razor Leaf and Wrap. While going for sleep early on is a viable strategy, Victreebel frequently shines late-game, as revealing it too early may make paralyzing some of your opponent's faster Pokemon more difficult. Therefore, Sleep Powder is often an endgame tool that it can use to threaten Tauros and other common endgame Pokemon. Wrap makes Victreebel a capable pivot and occasional sweeper; it can use the move to quickly get its teammates great matchups with little risk. For example, using Wrap against Chansey can provide entrance for Snorlax and using it against Exeggutor can provide entrance for Cloyster. Faster Pokemon are also vulnerable; if a foe like Alakazam, Starmie, or Zapdos tries to switch into Wrap and threaten paralysis, then a teammate like Snorlax, Jolteon, or Rhydon can come in for free. Finally, if the opposing team is made entirely slower than Victreebel, either by KOing or paralyzing every faster Pokemon, Victreebel can gradually chip away the team's health with Wrap until it can pick foes off with its attacks or swap out to a sweeper like Tauros to finish the job. Razor Leaf is Victreebel's strongest STAB move and primary attacking move. Water- and Rock-type Pokemon typically fold after just a hit or two, allowing Victreebel to reliably force switches when facing Pokemon like paralyzed Starmie, paralyzed or Resting Cloyster, Slowbro, and Rhydon. In the case of Slowbro, Razor Leaf's near-guaranteed critical hit enables Victreebel to deal hefty damage regardless of how many times it has used Amnesia. Victreebel's ability to pressure both Starmie and Rhydon is fairly unique and one of the key traits that allowed it to rise to OU. Victreebel's last move is its least important and most flexible. Stun Spore improves Victreebel's utility with Wrap and gives it the ability to pressure faster Pokemon even after Sleep Clause has taken effect. This is especially potent when the opponent's only Pokemon faster than Victreebel is Tauros. Hyper Beam makes Victreebel a more effective sweeper in late-game scenarios, picking up early KOs on Pokemon like Chansey and Alakazam.</p> <p>Depending on how Victreebel is played, it has a number of strong potential teammates. Starmie and Rhydon are typical partners, as they create a potent offensive core. Starmie can stymie Pokemon that threaten Victreebel like Alakazam, Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, while Victreebel can take advantage of Starmie’s ability to spread paralysis by using Wrap and applying pressure to Starmie’s strongest check, Chansey. Rhydon rounds out the core by handling Electric-type Pokemon, particularly Zapdos, which heavily threaten both Starmie and Victreebel. Rhydon also benefits from paralysis spread by these allies. Electric-type Pokemon also tend to work well with Victreebel on offensive teams, as Wrap can be a valuable tool for allowing them to switch in safely; Zapdos and Jolteon are quite good at finishing off a team that has been chipped by Wrap. Victreebel can also punish the switches to Rhydon or Golem that Electric-type Pokemon tend to encourage. Victreebel is also a fixture of Wrap teams. While a less common strategy in competitive play, Victreebel can be paired with Pokemon such as Cloyster and Dragonite to easily maintain momentum and annihilate paralyzed teams. Due to the many free switches generated by Wrap, such teams often feature multiple fast offensive Pokemon such as Tauros, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Alakazam.</p>"
        },
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>While Victreebel often gets the most value from a utility set based around pivoting and spreading status, it can make use of a Swords Dance set. Victreebel boasts an above-average Attack stat and can secure many important KOs after a Swords Dance. Frailer Pokemon such as Alakazam and Jynx drop to a single +2 Hyper Beam and Chansey will drop from full health about 17.9% of the time. Thanks to its decent Speed tier, Victreebel can severely weaken or outright sweep a team with Swords Dance after only a little chip damage and paralysis. Razor Leaf complements Hyper Beam quite well, as it threatens many of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier, such as Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro. The final move on the set largely comes down to team structure and personal preference. Wrap remains useful as a pseudo-pivot move and can help Victreebel get a little more chip damage on a Pokemon to bring it into range of Hyper Beam or Razor Leaf. Sleep Powder helps Victreebel find turns to set up with Swords Dance and punish Pokemon that might be brought in to stop a sweep, like Tauros or Electric-type Pokemon. Stun Spore acts similarly, heavily punishing common late-game switch-ins. While paralysis is generally weaker than sleep, Stun Spore has a case over Sleep Powder, as it is not inhibited by Sleep Clause and can be used at any point in the match. Moreover, because Victreebel is often best at switching in and setting up on Pokemon that are already asleep, Sleep Powder may be redundant.</p> <p>While Victreebel can succeed with this set, it has several notable limitations. Victreebel’s poor typing, underwhelming bulk, and vulnerability to paralysis make setting up quite difficult, forcing Victreebel to rely on free turns from sleep and risky double switches. Victreebel needs a lot of support to not only set up with Swords Dance, but also to weaken the opposing team enough that Victreebel can do real damage. This generally means all Psychic-type Pokemon on the opposing team need to be paralyzed and hard walls like Gengar need to be eliminated. Finally, while Victreebel is arguably the best user of Swords Dance in the tier, it is not necessarily the best fit for every team. Pokemon like Sandslash, Kingler, Venusaur, Pinsir, and Kabutops all offer a variety of positive traits and give Victreebel pretty stiff competition for an already niche role.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>While in heavy competition with Rhydon for a spot on a team, Golem has merit for its access to Explosion, letting it blow holes in opposing teams for its allies to exploit. Golem's higher Speed compared to Rhydon also pays dividends in Stadium, giving it a 12% critical hit rate that helps it break through opposing Reflect Snorlax and Chansey. These traits make Golem a fair pick on teams weak to Rhydon that need a consistent way to beat bulkier Pokemon like the aforementioned Normal-types, as well as Slowbro and Rest Exeggutor. When provided with paralysis support, Golem is a serious threat, dealing massive damage with its STAB moves while still maintaining the threat of Explosion, often securing the late-game for its team as a result.</p> <p>However, Golem's Explosion and Speed are all it has over Rhydon. Rhydon has superior overall bulk, 103 HP Substitutes to consistently beat Seismic Toss Chansey, and a better Attack stat that gives it more consistent KO ranges. Because of this, on top of Snorlax having a superior self-KO move in STAB Self-Destruct, Golem is very hard to fit onto teams. Golem still has Rhydon's flaws as well: it's very slow and specially frail, making it take mortal damage against special attackers like Starmie, Alakazam, and Lapras, forcing it to use Explosion earlier than one would expect. Its slowness also causes it to lose one-on-one matchups surprisingly frequently, such as against Tauros and Exeggutor. Like Rhydon’s, while Golem's defensive typing does provide a useful Electric immunity for combatting Zapdos and Jolteon, it also gives massive weaknesses to Ice- and Water-type coverage from Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax, making it very difficult for Golem to successfully enter battle and do its job. These problems make Golem a rare sight in Stadium OU, but it’s still a serviceable pick for teams that need a better Rhydon matchup in addition to an Explosion user.</p>",

          "description": "<p>The combination of Rock Slide and Earthquake lets Golem hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage. Rock Slide particularly hits Exeggutor for neutral damage, ensuring it can't repeatedly switch in, lest it be forced to use Rest early. It also hits Flying-types like Articuno and Zapdos for heavy damage, forcing them out and letting Golem scout with Body Slam. Earthquake has the potential to OHKO Gengar and Jolteon while serving as its strongest attack without a drawback. Body Slam serves as a midground option, letting Golem spread paralysis for itself while punishing potential switch-ins. Explosion allows Golem to trade with an important Pokemon; note, however, that it doesn't let Golem survive breaking a Substitute, unlike in regular RBY. This means that scouting the target for Substitute or paralyzing it is recommended.</p> <p>Stadium's Team Preview benefits Golem’s Explosion, as you will always know whether the opponent has a Zapdos, Jolteon, or Gengar on their team. If Zapdos or Jolteon is present, it's best to hold back the Explosion until late-game, where Golem can check them more effectively. Still, remember that Golem struggles to actually get in to check them, as it can be somewhat predictable. Similarly, in Gengar's case, saving Explosion until it’s used its own Explosion or otherwise been crippled is recommended, or it can be used to nullify Explosion completely. Rhydon poses a risk for similar reasons, but it struggles to switch in due to the threat of Earthquake, though it's notable regardless. If none of these Pokemon are present, Explosion can be used much earlier to KO important mid-game Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey. It's also perfectly viable to use it as an emergency check to Slowbro if it's picked up too many Amnesia boosts.</p> <p>Golem has room for customization to further differentiate itself from Rhydon, but this is often a misguided effort, as it has to drop Body Slam or Rock Slide, opening it up to exploitation. Defense Curl or Harden can be used to make Golem more consistently check Snorlax, but this still loses to Amnesia variants. Fire Blast is a somewhat viable option for hitting Exeggutor and burning switch-ins, but this can backfire against Pokemon that prefer being burned, such as Starmie and Chansey. Substitute can potentially be used to guard against status and get more hits in, but Rhydon does this better by a long shot and it makes Golem inclined to use Explosion earlier, so it's not recommended.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Golem stands out in RBY Ubers as a Ground-type with access to Explosion. This gives it a significant niche over Rhydon, letting it deal up to 80% to tier king Mewtwo. With unresisted QuakeSlide coverage, it's not just an Explosion that it offers; its coverage helps immensely against Rhydon, Zapdos, Gengar, and Jolteon. With adequate paralysis support, Golem can deal massive damage and blow up on a high-value Pokemon, providing its teammates with incredible momentum. Golem's typing also gives it a valuable Normal resistance and an Electric immunity, helping to check threats like Tauros and Snorlax and soundly beating Zapdos and Jolteon.</p> <p>However, Golem is only favored over Rhydon on offensive teams that look to overwhelm the opponent with Explosion. Rhydon fits on more team styles and offers added consistency that Golem simply can’t muster. Self-Destruct Snorlax and Explosion Mew, while great partners on offensive teams, are also capable of compressing Golem's role while having potential surprise value and allowing for more consistent team options; notably, Snorlax also possesses a stronger self-KO move thanks to STAB. Ergo, the bulkier and harder-hitting Rhydon can often fill Golem's place just fine, 3HKOing Mewtwo with Earthquake, while Golem can only do so inconsistently. Additionally, Rhydon is capable of walling non-Earthquake Mew sets and making 103 HP Substitutes, which can absorb a Seismic Toss from Chansey. Thus, Rhydon is often recommended if Golem's Explosion isn't required. Furthermore, Golem shares all of Rhydon's flaws: it's slow, specially frail, and has common weaknesses to Ice and Water. Without paralysis support, Golem struggles to win consistently in one-on-one battles, which can't always be afforded in the harsh world of RBY Ubers.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>When customizing Golem's set, it's best to replace Rock Slide, Substitute, or Body Slam, but these come with caveats. Removing Rock Slide makes it difficult for Golem to damage Exeggutor and Zapdos, removing Substitute makes it impossible for Golem to set up in front of paralyzed foes, and removing Body Slam leaves Golem without a midground option while becoming more reliant on its team for paralysis. With this in mind, attempts to customize Golem are not recommended.</p> <p>If you must customize Golem, using Defense Curl or Harden isn't terrible, as these allow Golem to consistently wall non-Earthquake Snorlax variants. In the long run, however, this doesn't pan out, as most non-Earthquake Snorlax variants use Reflect + Rest or Amnesia, which overwhelm Golem through sheer longevity and firepower, respectively. Against the latter, Golem is likely to use Explosion anyway, as Amnesia Snorlax threatens severe damage to its team. Outside of this, Fire Blast is plausible for hitting Exeggutor slightly harder when it switches in and potentially burning it, removing the threat of its Explosion, but the risk of thawing a Pokemon and lack of utility outside of this makes it hard to justify.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: While Mewtwo does not appreciate taking Explosion—which is a guaranteed KO after a single Earthquake—unboosted Psychic 2HKOes Golem and can force Explosion much earlier than desired. If Mewtwo has used Amnesia even once, it must be paralyzed for Golem to do anything. Ice Beam variants completely incapacitate Golem; high damage rolls do enough to even let Zapdos win out. While rare, an unboosted Blizzard from Mewtwo OHKOes Golem half the time. If Mewtwo is paralyzed, however, a single full paralysis lets Golem attempt to 3HKO it with Earthquake, which works a quarter of the time but otherwise leaves Mewtwo easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Thunderbolt + Submission Mewtwo sets actually struggle against Golem, failing to 3HKO it and getting 2HKOed in return by Earthquake + Explosion; thus, it is forced to repeatedly use Recover or switch out. Finally, Barrier Mewtwo completely stops Golem in its tracks, as after a single Defense boost, Earthquake becomes a 6HKO at best, while Explosion deals less than 40%. However, both aforementioned Mewtwo sets are rare.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Users</strong>: Reflect throws a spanner in the works for Golem, swiftly taking a Pokemon out of Explosion KO range; faster Pokemon using Reflect as Golem uses Explosion is particularly depressing. Mew isn't completely incapacitated by an Explosion if it's at full HP and walls Golem if using Reflect sets. If using Earthquake, Mew 3HKOes Golem consistently without having to boost. Golem cannot 3HKO non-Reflect Mew without prior chip damage. Thus, Golem is largely limited to using Explosion and hoping Mew doesn't switch out. Chansey isn't always OHKOed by Explosion, and if it's running Reflect Golem has no hope of winning outside of luck. Moreover, if Chansey is using Ice Beam, it can 2HKO Golem, and this is sometimes run on the same set. Reflect Snorlax is a similarly unfeasible matchup for Golem unless it gets extreme luck, especially if Snorlax is using Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch in on Golem without much fear and put it to sleep. In the event sleep isn't an option, Exeggutor still 2HKOes Golem with Psychic a quarter of the time. However, Exeggutor can't repeatedly switch in on Rock Slide, as it tends to lose out against Seismic Toss users such as Chansey later or otherwise get forced into using Explosion sooner. If Exeggutor is paralyzed and at around half HP, Golem can win with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro and the rarer Starmie and Lapras can all OHKO Golem with Surf. However, Slowbro dislikes having Golem switch in on a predicted Rest, as it forces it to Rest stall with repeated Earthquakes by threat of a 4HKO; a single critical hit can mean it loses outright. If Slowbro has set up prior, Earthquake + Explosion is a viable route to dispatch it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: If Golem takes a super effective hit, it is normally forced into Explosion, which is a less than ideal situation. Mega Drain Exeggutor adores any opportunity to use it against Golem, recovering a minimum of 37.6%. Blizzard users such as Tauros, Jynx, Cloyster, and the rare Dragonite and Articuno also mortally threaten Golem, with the latter even OHKOing it. Tauros can switch in on Golem's Body Slam and threaten a 2HKO with Blizzard. Snorlax may use Blizzard alongside Amnesia to try to sweep, which OHKOes Golem at +2. The rare Victreebel can OHKO Golem with Razor Leaf or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. While it's not likely to win the interaction, Jolteon's Double Kick deals up to 19.8% each time, which can wear Golem down and force an early Explosion.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Earthquake and Rock Slide gives Golem unresisted physical coverage; when factoring in the threat of Explosion, this makes Golem very difficult to switch into. Golem's Earthquake may OHKO Gengar and Jolteon and 2HKOes Alakazam and—rarely—Chansey. It also serves as Golem's best option against Mewtwo and Mew, 3HKOing Mewtwo about a quarter of the time and 3HKOing Mew if it's taken minor damage prior. Furthermore, just a single Earthquake puts Mewtwo in range for Explosion. Golem has a fair shot at wearing down any non-Ice Beam Mewtwo if it's paralyzed, though it's also 2HKOed by Psychic. Rock Slide potentially OHKOes Jynx and 2HKOes Zapdos, ensuring the latter can be consistently dealt with. It is also Golem's best option against Exeggutor, which likes to switch in on it and threaten with sleep. Substitute can allow Golem to place itself in a favorable position if it can set up against paralyzed foes, such as Mewtwo and Chansey. Alternatively, Body Slam allows Golem to be more self-sufficient in spreading paralysis, which can let it turn the tables on switch-ins.</p> <p>Explosion is Golem's claim to fame and should not be taken lightly. It OHKOes non-Reflect Chansey, Jynx, and Alakazam, as well as Starmie 38% of the time. It also deals up to 80% to Mewtwo and up to 75.9% to Mew. Golem itself holds little value once the opposing team's Electric-type has been removed, so using Explosion to incapacitate Mewtwo or Mew is very desirable. In practice, however, this is very difficult, as the threat of Explosion can be enough to force out Mewtwo and Mew if they're in range. Snorlax and Mew often succeed with their self-KO moves because of their set variety, allowing for more effective bluffs, which Golem cannot afford. Another ideal situation for Explosion is when threatened with an Amnesia Snorlax or Slowbro sweep, as it's one of the only consistent ways to prevent them from sweeping once they set up. Landing Explosion on Chansey can enable Mewtwo, and removing Snorlax can be similarly useful for preventing its powerful early-game offense, but this isn't ideal, as it may leave Golem’s team vulnerable to opposing Electric-types late-game. It's recommended to account for opposing Gengar, Rock-types, and frozen or sleeping Pokemon that can switch in to absorb Explosion. Thus, it may be appropriate to keep Golem unrevealed for extended periods of time, whereas Mew and Snorlax generally don't imply their self-KO moves until they actually use them. As a rule of thumb, using Explosion should be a game of trades; understanding the value that each Pokemon holds to the opposing team is pivotal to succeeding.</p> <p>Golem is best played on offensive teams with multiple self-KO move users, such as Self-Destruct Snorlax, Explosion Mew, and Exeggutor; while prediction-heavy and thus inconsistent, these teams are capable of closing out games very quickly. In other cases, Rhydon tends to outclass Golem and should be looked to first. Golem also pairs well with Water-types like Slowbro and the rarer Starmie and Lapras, which appreciate its Electric immunity. Slowbro notably punishes non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo, and the combination of Slowbro and Golem is capable of muscling past it without compromising your own Mewtwo. However, both are painfully slow, which can be problematic on a poorly built team. Paralysis support is paramount so that the opposition doesn't recover out of KO range, so Pokemon like Chansey, Starmie, Stun Spore Exeggutor, and the aforementioned Slowbro are recommended. Golem tends to hold little value to a team due to its disposable nature, so sacrificing it against sleepers like Exeggutor and Sing Chansey isn't unusual. In fact, against Chansey, it's plausible to cut your losses and have Golem use Explosion in response to a missed Sing, potentially OHKOing it and enabling Mewtwo.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Golem's Rock / Ground typing makes it a strong attacker that crucially hard counters Zapdos and Jolteon while resisting Normal-type attacks. Its QuakeSlide coverage is completely unresisted and able to 2HKO Pokemon like Rhydon, Zapdos, and Alakazam. This makes Golem excellent at bullying paralyzed Pokemon, but what tops this all off is Explosion. Golem's Explosion, while just shy of Snorlax's Self-Destruct's strength, is terrifyingly strong, even having a chance to OHKO Starmie. Explosion Golem is likely to break even (at worst) against most Pokemon, and this has kept it relevant for decades.</p> <p>However, Golem is very slow and has devastating weaknesses to most common special attacks; it has to run from Blizzard, Surf, Razor Leaf, and whatnot. Even neutral special attacks such as Psychic will deal significant damage to Golem. Further, being so slow means Golem gets forced to use Explosion in many one-on-one fights. Due to these two setbacks, Golem is very reliant on enemy teams being riddled with paralysis before it gets going. Plus, while Explosion can theoretically compensate for Golem's Speed and let it break even frequently, Golem generally shouldn't use Explosion until the opponent's Zapdos or Jolteon is accounted for, lest its team crumble to them. Therefore, decision-making with Explosion is difficult until Zapdos or Jolteon is paralyzed or KOed, after which it can be deployed more freely and actually exert offensive pressure. This can make its role seem a little paradoxical to the uninitiated.</p> <p>Golem famously fell from RBY OU in 2019, ending a long-standing battle between it and Rhydon for places on competitive teams. Understanding this is important, as while many teams can use Golem adequately, they tend to be better off with Rhydon instead. This is because Rhydon has a higher Attack stat, which allows it to achieve damage thresholds like 2HKOing Chansey and rarely 2HKOing Starmie. It's also capable of sometimes 3HKOing Slowbro, defusing a key threat if it switches in on Rest. The extra damage output against Exeggutor, Rhydon's and Golem's biggest counter and most common switch-in, is also a key advantage; Exeggutor cannot safely switch in as much as it would like against the rocky rhino. Additionally, Rhydon is bulkier thanks to its higher HP, which also enables 104 HP Substitutes to stomach Seismic Toss or Night Shade. This quirk helps Rhydon reliably run and use Substitute in general; it can fish for Substitute in situations where Golem is forced to use Explosion, making it even harder for Golem to justify itself on teams. Regardless, Golem's strong perks over Rhydon remain recognized: possessing the second-strongest self-KO move and outrunning Rhydon allow it to indisputably succeed over Rhydon on highly specific teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Customizing Golem usually involves looking at what it has over Rhydon, but this tends to be a fool's errand when looking beyond Explosion. If you must customize Golem, Body Slam is the most replaceable option, but note that this means its team will need at least one more reliable paralysis-spreading Pokemon to be effective.</p> <p>Golem can run Substitute to try and be like its brother Rhydon, but at that point, it's usually better to bite the bullet and use the stony superior. The utility of having both Substitute and Explosion is typically just not enough. Fire Blast can burn Exeggutor switching in, effectively ruining its Explosion, but it deals just barely more damage than Rock Slide, and Golem is usually forced out thereafter anyway. Defense Curl or Harden can let Golem consistently wall Snorlax and reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, but these perks are dubious at best in respect to what Golem wants to do.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch into Golem's Earthquake and threaten it with Sleep Powder or Psychic, forcing it out and granting Exeggutor's team significant momentum. Mega Drain variants are particularly soul-crushing, almost OHKOing Golem while letting Exeggutor recover almost half its HP. Once Exeggutor is at half HP and paralyzed, however, it's in Rock Slide's 2HKO range and cannot switch in.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: It's hard to name a Pokemon in RBY OU that doesn't have a super effective move against Golem. Any Pokemon with Surf or Razor Leaf, such as Starmie, Venusaur, or Victreebel, can OHKO Golem outright. Blizzard or Ice Beam users like Starmie, Chansey, Articuno, Tauros, and Amnesia Snorlax can also deal significant-to-heavy damage to Golem. Even Rhydon's Earthquake 2HKOes. Golem can usually take non-STAB Blizzard from full HP though, so keep this in mind for when a risky trade is necessary.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Normal-types</strong>: Reflect Snorlax doesn't care about anything Golem can throw at it, effortlessly trading blows with it. If it has Ice Beam, the matchup becomes completely unwinnable. The best Golem can offer in the matchup is using Explosion before Snorlax can use Reflect, after Reflect has already been revealed, but this should only be done in desperate situations. Reflect Chansey can perform similar feats, being just fast enough to use Reflect before Golem can use Explosion by default, but it should be at least a little afraid if paralyzed and without Reflect set up.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: While it's afraid of Body Slam paralysis, Starmie normally runs at least one super effective move against Golem, namely Surf or Blizzard. Surf OHKOes Golem outright, while Blizzard deals up to 79.8%. Unlike Rhydon, Golem can't 2HKO Starmie without a very lucky critical hit or Explosion. While Golem does like to use Explosion against Starmie, it's only 38.5% to OHKO, so the matchup remains a bad situation for it in a vacuum. Golem can only outright win this matchup if Starmie has taken prior damage or paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: You know it's bad when Clamp deals over half a Pokemon's HP. While Cloyster greatly fears Rock Slide, especially if paralyzed, it can use Blizzard to potentially OHKO Golem in return, or Clamp—liberally—to scout for its switch-in.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>QuakeSlide coverage allows Golem to hit the entire RBY roster for at least neutral damage. Rock Slide potentially OHKOes Articuno, Moltres, and Jynx; it also 2HKOes Zapdos and sometimes Dragonite. Earthquake is Golem's strongest attack without drawbacks and should be used liberally; it can OHKO Gengar and Jolteon and 2HKO Alakazam and Rhydon. Body Slam lets Golem be more self-sufficient in the paralysis-spreading effort, and it's useful to potentially incapacitate checks like Starmie and Exeggutor.</p> <p>What defines Golem, however, is Explosion. The dream of a Golem player is to beat out Zapdos or Jolteon late-game, then use Explosion on the opponent's last healthy Pokemon. This is a difficult dream to attain, but not impossible. Golem should ideally use Explosion very late into a game; usually, this is when the trade is clearly game-winning and the potential Electric-type threat has been accounted for. If Golem uses Explosion before Zapdos or Jolteon is revealed, its team may fall apart. Knowing common team structures and strategies involving these Pokemon is essential to predict if Explosion is safe prior to the last Pokemon being revealed. Tauros, Snorlax, and Chansey are omnipresent, so this can alleviate prediction by a chunk. Golem should ideally use Explosion against Starmie, which normally threatens Golem's partners with its sublime coverage and Speed. Starmie should ideally be ever-so-slightly chipped or paralyzed before doing this, as an OHKO isn't guaranteed. If Starmie lacks Surf, Golem can add the chip damage itself, as Blizzard deals 79.3% at most without a critical hit. If Starmie isn't present, Golem can also use Explosion on Chansey or Snorlax to pave the way for Tauros. Outside of this, Explosion can be a handy contingency plan in the event Slowbro snowballs out of control.</p> <p>Golem is frequently pushed out by Rhydon on teams, as its Explosion and favorable matchup against its rocky friend are typically unnecessary. Parties that require these traits typically use Pokemon like Moltres, which appreciate a better matchup against Rhydon- and Zapdos-centric teams. Teams that can't afford to compress the self-KO role onto Snorlax with Self-Destruct, or that wish to use an Explosion user alongside it, can also utilize Golem over Rhydon. Teams that feature many Explosion users—\"Boom Offense\"—will sometimes include Golem, but its low defensive utility makes it a tough fit even then.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>In a time where Mewtwo ravaged the RBY Ubers landscape and players desperately searched for a good check to it, Slowbro came to answer the call. Slowbro's Amnesia set, known as \"TobyBro\" and first created by Wintermute in the early 2000s, is the best check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo in the tier while being a very strong Pokemon in its own right. Amnesia, along with a great typing and excellent bulk, gives Slowbro immense sweeping potential. A boosted Surf is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing almost everything in the tier, and even resistant foes are 3HKOed. Amnesia also helps Slowbro patch up its Electric weakness, since Special is used for both offense and defense. Slowbro can even use Thunder Wave to fix its miserable Speed, and it can also reapply the foe's Speed drops from paralysis by using Amnesia.</p> <p>However, Slowbro will take very heavy damage from a critical hit Thunderbolt regardless of boosts, forcing it to use Rest earlier, and many Electric-type Pokemon have very high critical hit rates courtesy of their high Speed. Slowbro's abysmal Speed, while mitigated by Thunder Wave, can give it trouble as it tries to boost against faster threats while also necessitating some amount of paralysis support from teammates. Slowbro is also very one-dimensional and predictable; however, it will always be one of the most dangerous sweepers, no matter how much the opponent might know it is coming.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowbro has the option of forgoing Thunder Wave to run any one of the following options. Withdraw is a very strong option to bolster Slowbro's Defense and allow it to take Explosions, removing a prime option for dealing with it. Withdraw also allows Slowbro to reapply paralysis Speed drops more easily. Its massive 61 PP, combined with Rest, allows Slowbro to PP stall almost any Pokemon it needs to, such as opposing Thunder Wave Slowbro. The Defense boost also lets Slowbro counter Snorlax and Mew, which would otherwise be able to hit Slowbro for decent damage. However, Withdraw Slowbro can be very passive, and teams can take advantage of that with faster threats that Slowbro cannot outspeed without Thunder Wave. Reflect is also an option, as an instant +2 in Defense can be crucial in certain situations, such as Snorlax and Tauros needing instant walling as opposed to permitting multiple turns of setup. However, lower PP, an inability to reapply Speed drops, and an inability to boost past +2 make Reflect less desirable.</p> <p>Slowbro can also run two attacks, Surf and either Ice Beam or Psychic. Ice Beam prevents Exeggutor from checking Slowbro and can freeze Mewtwo, Chansey, and opposing Slowbro. On the other hand, Psychic allows Slowbro to hit Lapras and pressure Mewtwo, Starmie, and Light Screen Chansey with Special drops. However, running two attacks makes Slowbro more reliant on paralysis support from teammates to be able to outspeed and threaten certain Pokemon like Tauros and Mew. Two attacks Slowbro also gets PP stalled by Thunder Wave Slowbro. Toxic is a niche option to win mirrors against Withdraw Slowbro, since using Rest does not reset the bad poison timer. Also, Toxic can allow Slowbro to effectively pressure and even remove Light Screen Chansey, which otherwise walls it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode all carry Thunderbolt, which can stop Slowbro from setting up easily. All three of these Pokemon also have good critical hit rates, and a critical hit Thunderbolt from any of them will OHKO Slowbro outright. However, none of them can switch into a boosted attack, and all three are devastated by paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage</strong>: Non-Electric types like Starmie, Gengar, and Mewtwo can all run Thunderbolt to pressure Slowbro. All three have good critical hit rates, and a critical Thunderbolt can ruin Slowbro. Chansey can also run Thunderbolt, but it is less common; it also has a mediocre critical hit rate, meaning it struggles to pressure Slowbro after it has set up.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Exeggutor and Lapras avoid the 2HKO from +6 Surf and can put Slowbro to sleep with Sleep Powder and Sing, respectively. Lapras also carries Thunderbolt and can deal heavy damage with a critical hit. However, +6 Ice Beam OHKOes Exeggutor, while +2 Ice Beam 2HKOes it, and +4 Psychic 2HKOes Lapras, meaning you must scout for these moves before using these Pokemon to check Slowbro. In a similar vein, Victreebel and Cloyster avoid the OHKO from +6 Surf and can remove Slowbro with Wrap + Razor Leaf or Clamp + Explosion, respectively. However, a single miss of their partial trapping moves can spell doom for either.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen Chansey</strong>: Slowbro cannot 3HKO Chansey after Light Screen with +6 Surf, and it will eventually PP stall Slowbro.

Slowbro carrying Toxic also does not fear Light Screen Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Depending on the set, Slowbro can be checked by its other sets.

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Surf is very strong after a few Amnesia boosts, achieving things like a high chance to 2HKO Chansey at +6 and 2HKOs on Mew, Mewtwo, and Snorlax at +4. Amnesia is what makes this set threatening, letting Slowbro become very bulky and very powerful. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to patch up its awful Speed and more effectively threaten faster Pokemon. This is amplified by the threat of Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops. Slowbro can also use paralysis to have a chance at beating its checks, like Light Screen Chansey and Starmie. Rest allows Slowbro to stick around for much longer and ensures that a single critical hit cannot end its sweep. It also protects Slowbro from chip damage, which is likely to accumulate while switching in and boosting with Amnesia. However, a sleeping Slowbro is very easy to take advantage of, and many opponents will use it as a chance to switch in their Explosion user or Thunderbolt Mewtwo.</p> <p>When using Slowbro, it is very important to scout your opponent's team for Electric-type coverage, especially Thunderbolt on Chansey or Mewtwo. However, Chansey very rarely uses Thunderbolt in Ubers, meaning it is usually safe to set up against. Slowbro is very good at setting up against and paralyzing Mewtwo, as it takes very little damage from Mewtwo's attacks even after it has boosted, unless Mewtwo reveals Thunderbolt or gets a critical hit. Either can force Slowbro to repeatedly use Rest and allow Mewtwo to win the interaction with some luck. Slowbro itself is a very good paralysis absorber, since its pitiful Speed means it is not affected much by it. Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops means even a paralyzed Slowbro can outspeed most foes after a few uses of the move. The most common way to remove Slowbro is with Explosion, so users such as Snorlax, Golem, Mew, Exeggutor, and Gengar should be watched carefully. Slowbro should be used with a good absorber of the move, such as Jynx, Rhydon, or your own Golem or Gengar. Absorbing Explosion with these Pokemon requires good prediction on when the foe is about to use the move to switch them in at the right time. Predicting wrong can result in Slowbro getting KOed or the opponent gaining momentum. Alternatively, you can choose to not reveal your Slowbro until later in the game, after the rest of your team has already dealt with opposing Explosion users.</p> <p>Slowbro especially appreciates Rhydon and Golem as Explosion absorbers, since they are immune to the Electric-type moves that give Slowbro so much trouble. However, Rhydon and Slowbro are both very slow, so using them together requires extra care. If your chosen strategy is to deal with Explosion users before revealing Slowbro, other Pokemon that attract the move such as Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo can be used. Slowbro can struggle to beat certain checks such as Exeggutor and Lapras, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as BoltBeam Chansey, are appreciated.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Amnesia Slowbro has gone down in history as one of the most famous and well-known sets in the world of competitive Pokemon. Generally known as TobyBro, Amnesia Slowbro is a moveset that combines both simplicity and efficiency. The RBY version of Amnesia is arguably the best stat-boosting move of all time, raising the Special stat by two stages. It quickly powers up Slowbro's Special moves, while covering its main defensive weakness: Electric-type attacks. Having one of the best physical defense stats in the game and learning Thunder Wave to make up for its awful Speed greatly helps make Slowbro more threatening as well.</p> <p>However, Slowbro is also a bit of an all-or-nothing Pokemon and requires some luck, which are the main reasons why it's often an overlooked Pokemon. Without setting up, Slowbro is basically a useless Pokemon; it can't Recover to work as a wall for a long time, and offensively, it lacks Explosion or a sleep move, unlike other specially based Pokemon. On the other hand, if Slowbro sets up, it's meant never to switch out, so the user is inevitably taking some risks; Electric-type moves fail to get past a +6 Slowbro normally, but with a critical hit, a non-STAB Thunderbolt will nearly OHKO Slowbro while a STAB Thunderbolt will OHKO outright. With critical hit rates being much higher in RBY than in later generations, it's not really \"bad luck\" when Slowbro ultimately ends up falling to a critical hit Thunderbolt. To a lesser extent, this can also be applied to the physical side, potentially turning 4HKOs into 3HKOs, letting a physical sweeper get past Rest. However, while it's true that Slowbro depends on quite a bit on luck, it also requires a good deal of skill, and Slowbro can be one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the first generation, being the best Amnesia user in RBY after Mewtwo.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is another attacking move Slowbro can use. Its biggest upside is hitting Grass-types and Zapdos for super effective damage, including Exeggutor and Victreebel. Ice Beam will often surprise Exeggutor, OHKOing it at +6. At the very least, it will force Exeggutor to use Explosion earlier, making it more predictable. Meanwhile, Zapdos is 2HKOed by a +2 Ice Beam and OHKOed when Slowbro is at +6. Ice Beam's freeze chance might also save you in a pinch and could make a difference against another Slowbro or Amnesia Snorlax. Ice Beam, however, should only be used over Thunder Wave, because the STAB move is necessary to 2HKO Chansey and Starmie. Withdraw has the same goal as Reflect, with the difference that it can maximize Slowbro's Defense, but requires two turns to reach Reflect's potential. Reflect will generally turn out to be more useful and safer. Withdraw's high PP will let Slowbro outstall other Slowbro, however. Counter can surprise common Slowbro switch-ins like Starmie if you switch into a Body Slam from a physical attacker and scare it out, or if you predict a Hyper Beam. Counter has hardly any other uses other than these though because Slowbro generally only takes physical attacks when it's asleep, excluding Explosion. Disable is a funny option that can prevent some Pokemon from Thunderbolting Slowbro for some time, but it's very unreliable and shouldn't really be used.</p> <p>Slowbro can also be used as a lead with a set of Thunder Wave, Amnesia, Surf, and Fire Blast or Blizzard. This set is incredibly vulnerable to sleep leads such as Jynx, Exeggutor, Gengar, and Sing Chansey; however, when it finds itself against other Thunder Wave leads, namely Alakazam and Starmie, its ability to boost up with Amnesia and pump out damage with +2 coverage moves is remarkable. It still struggles in doing significant damage if the opponent has Thunderbolt Chansey or Starmie anywhere on their team, and due to its lack of recovery it is incredibly easy to wear down and incredibly vulnerable to full paralysis, so this set is not recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage</strong>: The higher the user's critical hit ratio and the number of turns it can resist Slowbro's Surf, the better. Starmie is a good choice, having a very high Speed and thus a high critical hit ratio, while also resisting all of Slowbro's moves. It's not a surefire counter though, and in case Starmie prevails, it won't like having to eat a Thunder Wave. Gengar makes a good choice too, having a high critical hit ratio and being able to Explode for around 50% damage when it's about to be KOed. However, it doesn't resist Surf and is weak to Psychic. Zapdos and Jolteon have the luxury of getting STAB in their Electric-type attacks; even when Slowbro is at +6, their Thunderbolts will still do significant damage. They also have a high critical hit ratio, but like Gengar, they don't resist Surf, and, unlike Gengar, can't Explode.</p> <p><strong>Explosion users</strong>: Explosion makes a very viable choice for taking Slowbro down when you have no other option. No user can OHKO a healthy Slowbro, but many put it in the KO range of Tauros's Hyper Beam or Rhydon's Earthquake. Pokemon with Explosion or Self-Destruct include Exeggutor, Snorlax, Golem, Cloyster, and Gengar, although Gengar's Explosion is weaker. A Resting Slowbro that gets Exploded on is pretty much a dead Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Amnesia Snorlax will often defeat Slowbro, as its Body Slam is an almost guaranteed 4HKO while Slowbro's Surf only manages a 5HKO when both are at +6. Due to the Speed tie, a 4HKO could turn into a 3HKO, depending on who goes first the turn Slowbro uses Rest. If Snorlax is packing Thunderbolt instead, it will fare even better, 3HKOing Slowbro after both have set up. As far as the physical side goes, Rhydon makes a surprisingly viable option, although risky as well; it has to switch in when Slowbro uses Rest, and then try to 3HKO it with its STAB Earthquake, which will happen around 75-80% of the time. Tauros needs a critical hit Body Slam to get the chance to 3HKO it after finishing it off with a Hyper Beam. If Tauros gets paralyzed, though, you can pretty much forget about beating Slowbro. Snorlax's critical hit ratio is much smaller than Tauros's, but its Body Slam is almost a guaranteed 4HKO, and has an easier chance if Body Slam paralyzes Slowbro. For instance, if Snorlax moves first while Slowbro tries to use Rest, but moves last on the previous turn that Slowbro Rested, Snorlax beats Slowbro with only Body Slam. Both Tauros and physical Snorlax should really be careful when trying to counter Slowbro and should generally only be sent in when Slowbro is sleeping because they will otherwise fall to previously-boosted Surfs more often than not. If Slowbro's set contains Reflect, though, trying to counter it with physical attacks becomes impractical unless you are willing to sacrifice at least two Exploders. In this case, however, any unparalyzed Thunderbolt user becomes a much more effective check, including the slow ones, such as Chansey and Lapras, which, despite their low critical hit rate, will get more chances to fish for it, as it's much more likely that Slowbro is forced to Rest more often. Chansey and especially Starmie will get the chance to keep using their recovery move until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed, which is when they get the chance to use Thunderbolt. Starmie is much better at doing this because Recover outlasts Surf in terms of PP.</p> <p><strong>Razor Leaf users</strong>: Victreebel and Venusaur are known for having a guaranteed critical hit in their STAB signature move, Razor Leaf. They won't like switching into a Thunder Wave, and could be surprised and OHKOed by a boosted STAB Psychic, but, otherwise, either of the Grass-types can KO Slowbro when it is below 70% or 2HKO it while it is Resting.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen users</strong>: Starmie or Chansey packing Light Screen will completely counter Slowbro unless they get really unlucky with full paralysis. Light Screen is never seen on them, however, as it has no use outside of walling Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: It's worth noting that Slowbro, as a Rest user, is one of those Pokemon that should be attacked whenever given the chance, because when it's Resting, you can apply a much higher and more effective variety of tactics to try to take it down. Exeggutor's Mega Drain and Alakazam and Jynx's Seismic Toss, for instance, may not do enough to kill Slowbro, but will cause some decent damage on it before being forced to switch out, which will force it to Rest earlier than desired.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Everybody knows the set, but this doesn't make it less dangerous. Amnesia boosts Slowbro's decent Special, being able to reach the maximum 999 after three Amnesia boosts, letting Slowbro 2HKO Chansey with its STAB Surf at +6. Amnesia, like all boosting moves, also has the great side effect of further reducing the speed of paralyzed enemies, allowing Slowbro to muscle through paralyzed would-be walls a lot more easily. When playing Slowbro, it's really useful to know some significant damage rolls or otherwise have a damage calculator handy. As said, Slowbro has a good chance of 2HKOing Chansey but must be at +6. The same can be said about Starmie, although a 999 Special STAB Surf is a guaranteed 2HKO. On the other hand, Starmie is much more of a problem for Slowbro due to having a much higher critical hit ratio. Beating Tauros is about using Amnesia once and then 2HKOing it with Surf, although a +4 Slowbro stands a good chance of OHKOing Tauros. Snorlax, however, requires Slowbro to use Amnesia twice to get the 2HKO; a +6 Surf almost never OHKOes Snorlax. Zapdos also requires two Amnesia boosts, while Jolteon, like Tauros, is 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Gengar will fall to two +2 Surfs half of the time, so it's generally advised to only use Amnesia once. Exeggutor and Lapras are 3HKOed by a +6 Surf; boosting either twice or three times is the way to go. All these calculations have been made considering that the opposition is at full health, so they may vary depending on the health of the opponent as well as on the situation of the battle itself.</p> <p>Having said that, using Thunder Wave first is almost always a good idea. Slowbro is tied with Snorlax as the slowest Pokemon in the game, so paralyzing Snorlax is also a good idea to guarantee Slowbro is faster than it or to fish for full paralysis. Against common Slowbro switch-ins, such as Starmie, Gengar, or Electric-types, Thunder Wave will have to be used as they switch in, so that you can get a boost before they are able to attack. However, it's generally advised to switch Slowbro back after paralyzing the switch-in to get the chance to move two consecutive times the next time they switch in. This way, you can maximize your chances of KOing said check before they are able to score a deadly critical hit Thunderbolt. Even if Starmie or Chansey paralyze Slowbro back in order to outspeed again, using Thunder Wave yourself first was the best move, because the chances of beating an unparalyzed Chansey and especially Starmie are slim, as they can just keep using Recover or Soft-Boiled until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed and they get a chance to use Thunderbolt. An unparalyzed Starmie can also attempt to PP stall Slowbro out of Surfs as well.</p> <p>Rest is perfectly suited for Slowbro. During the setup, Slowbro generally takes some residual damage and gets paralyzed, but Rest can keep Slowbro healthy and free of status. After maximizing its Special, no special attack can get past Slowbro's Rest without a critical hit, and due to Slowbro's great Defense and lack of exploitable physical weaknesses, it's going to be hard to beat Slowbro from the physical side without Explosion. Tauros, for example, needs a critical hit Body Slam and Hyper Beam to 3HKO Slowbro, which is the only way it has to get past Rest; furthermore, if Tauros gets paralyzed, its chances of beating Slowbro become very small. Snorlax, meanwhile, will generally have to resort to Self-Destruct to take Slowbro down. Rhydon has the luxury of being able to 3HKO Slowbro with its powerful STAB Earthquake most of the time, but will have to switch into the predicted Rest and is OHKOed by even a +0 Surf. As said, Explosion makes a good way to eliminate Slowbro, but an Explosion might not even guarantee that a full health Slowbro goes down or gets revenge killed easily due to Slowbro's already mentioned great Defense. Exeggutor's Explosion, for instance, will only hit Slowbro for around 60%. Lowering Slowbro to around 80% or forcing it to Rest first is the safest way to ensure that one Explosion is enough to let a physical attacker, such as Tauros, Golem, Rhydon, or Persian, to revenge kill it safely.</p> <p>Psychic is a STAB alternative to Surf, and trades 5 extra power for a 30% chance of scoring a Special fall. As far as type effectiveness is concerned, Psychic gains a neutral hit against Lapras and Cloyster and a super effective hit against Gengar and Victreebel, three of which are effective Slowbro checks, but loses the neutral hit against Alakazam as well as the ability to OHKO Golem and Rhydon at +0, needing two Amnesia boosts to OHKO them. Seismic Toss Alakazam, in particular, will have the opportunity to force you to Rest before Slowbro is able to get past it. Psychic's lower PP could also be a problem against users of recovery moves, especially considering that, without Surf, Alakazam will also require more time to take down. It could also be an issue if your opponent keeps using Recover or Soft-Boiled and gets lucky with full paralysis. Having 8 fewer PP could also be significant in an odd Slowbro war.</p> <p>Reflect is a possible alternative to Thunder Wave, as it doesn't change the general concept of the set, but changes the way it works in some way and some of its counters. The first thing to notice is the loss of Thunder Wave, which will be problematic in several match-ups. Unless you can paralyze Starmie with another Pokemon, it will hard counter Slowbro. Other specially based Pokemon, such as Chansey, Lapras, Gengar, and Electric-types will also become more problematic if you can't paralyze them; they will have a higher chance of scoring a critical hit Thunderbolt, as they will move first and avoid possible full paralysis. Lastly, Victreebel and Venusaur will have nothing to worry about a Slowbro lacking Thunder Wave unless its attacking move is Psychic. Letting Victreebel in for free could get especially problematic if it's packing Wrap.</p> <p>The reward of using Reflect comes from the physical side. It almost ensures that none of Snorlax, Golem, and Rhydon will have a chance to take Slowbro down due to their low critical hit rate. Tauros will have a lot of difficulties too, needing two critical hit Body Slams to beat Slowbro while it Rests. Reflect is also great for weakening Explosions, which is one of the most common and \"safe\" ways of getting rid of Slowbro; even Snorlax's Self-Destruct will only manage around 40% damage. Reflect makes double Explosions necessary to lower Slowbro to the point where it can be revenge killed, which, for the opponent, involves sacrificing at least two Pokemon.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Being extremely fast and hitting as hard as Snorlax, Dodrio can be a frightening foe in RBY OU, acting as a strong revenge killer and late-game sweeper. Its offensive prowess is no joke, with Body Slam + Hyper Beam 2HKOing many Pokemon in the tier, including Chansey and Starmie. With STAB Drill Peck under its belt, Dodrio has the potential to even OHKO Exeggutor with a critical hit, as well as play around Counter users like Chansey. When used alongside Tauros, Dodrio is very capable of tearing holes in the opposing team that can leave it ripe for exploitation from its teammates.</p> <p>However, Dodrio is by no means a standard, and there are many reasons why. For starters, it is extremely frail, struggling to even stomach neutral hits and being OHKOed by Zapdos, Articuno, and even Cloyster. This fragility, combined with paralysis incapacitating it, makes it very difficult to utilize outside of late-game scenarios, which many teams will struggle to facilitate. Furthermore, similar to Zapdos, Dodrio is completely hopeless against Rhydon, getting effortlessly stonewalled. Finally, like many Normal-type attackers, Dodrio is strictly outclassed by Tauros, which possesses superior coverage and Speed; ergo, Dodrio must be used alongside it.

Drill Peck allows Dodrio to duel Gengar and Exeggutor far more effectively; it also does not enable Counter, which lets Dodrio scout users like Chansey while not losing any offensive pressure. Hyper Beam can potentially OHKO Jynx and Alakazam, as well as secure 2HKOs on Chansey and Starmie in tandem with Body Slam. With critical hit Hyper Beam, Dodrio can 2HKO any Pokemon in the tier barring Rhydon after a Body Slam. Finally, Agility allows Dodrio to outrun the entire unboosted metagame, giving it a more secure late-game sweep, while bypassing the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>Dodrio's movepool is quite barren, but it has some niche options worth exploring. While it doesn't protect from status in RBY, Substitute is a viable choice to scout for free turns, such as the opponent switching or full paralysis, allowing Dodrio to stomach harder hits than it otherwise could. However, Substitute's HP cost makes Dodrio much easier to revenge kill later, cutting into its already poor bulk. Mimic is a serviceable option, giving Dodrio a potential coverage move like Earthquake to better handle Rhydon, but is extremely unreliable.</p>"

Despite this, Cloyster is able to carve out a niche for itself thanks to its high Defense and immunity to freeze, allowing it to wall most common Snorlax sets. Stadium's nerf to Hyper Beam and revamped critical hit rates also make Cloyster more effective at checking Tauros. Cloyster also still has access to a powerful Explosion as well as Ice-type STAB moves that threaten freeze on foes.</p> <p>Despite its robust defenses, Cloyster can get into trouble if luck does not go its way.

Snorlax and Tauros can both use Thunderbolt to catch Cloyster off guard, making it a much less effective wall. Additionally, Cloyster is weak against other tier staples such as Starmie, Chansey, Zapdos, and Persian. The changes to Substitute's mechanics also makes Cloyster's Explosion riskier, as using Explosion on a Substitute will now knock Cloyster out. Overall, Cloyster has a strong niche in the metagame as a physical wall, but its flaws keep it from being among the top threats.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite the nerf, Clamp can still be used on Cloyster as a pivot tool and a means to chip down paralyzed and slower foes. However, Clamp no longer doing damage as a Pokemon switches in heavily reduces the effectiveness of the move. Cloyster can use Substitute or Reflect to improve its resilience against Tauros and Snorlax. Reflect makes it much harder for the Normal-types to break through Cloyster, while Body Slam cannot break a Substitute. However, dropping an attacking move will give Cloyster PP issues, and dropping Explosion will make Cloyster very passive. Double-Edge can be used to try to break through Chansey and paralyzed Psychic-types, but the recoil hinders Cloyster's defensive capabilities, and it generally wants to switch out of these foes, since it takes heavy damage in return. Cloyster can also use Bubble Beam over Surf for more PP and a chance to slow down a foe, since Cloyster outspeeds every relevant Pokemon except for Jolteon at -1 Speed. However, Bubble Beam's lower damage output is noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Starmie switches into all of Cloyster's non-Explosion attacks with ease and 2HKOes it in return with Thunderbolt. Starmie can also safely click Recover on Cloyster, and it always survives Explosion from full health, taking a maximum of 96.9%. However, an unparalyzed Starmie can be ruined by an Ice Beam freeze. Slowbro also switches into Cloyster and can set up Amnesia in front of it. At +4 Special, Surf almost always 2HKOes it, preventing Cloyster from Rest looping. Opposing Cloyster can switch in safely and is immune to freeze, and Lapras can also switch in and threatens Cloyster with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Alakazam</strong>: Chansey and Alakazam are both capable of switching into Cloyster and healing any damage they take with their instant recovery moves. Chansey 2HKOes Cloyster with Thunderbolt, while Alakazam 3HKOes it with Psychic. However, both must watch out for Explosion, as Alakazam is outright OHKOed by it, and Chansey gets OHKOed 74.4% of the time.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hits</strong>: Cloyster relies on Rest looping Tauros and Snorlax to wall them effectively, allowing them to break through with critical hits.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Jolteon deal massive damage to Cloyster with Thunderbolt , doing a minimum of 88.1% and 80.8%, respectively. Zapdos cannot switch directly into Cloyster due to the threat of an Ice-type attack, so it is better off revenge killing it or switching in when Cloyster uses Rest. Jolteon's lack of an Ice weakness means it can switch in better than Zapdos can.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types with Thunderbolt</strong>: Although Cloyster checks standard Snorlax and Tauros sets, both can equip Thunderbolt to catch Cloyster off guard. Both Tauros and Persian 3HKO Cloyster with Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt on Snorlax is typically seen on Amnesia sets, and a +4 Thunderbolt OHKOes Cloyster.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar switches into Cloyster's attacks relatively safely, taking a maximum of 28.7% from Ice Beam and 35.6% from Blizzard. Gengar threatens a 2HKO with Thunderbolt. It is also immune to Cloyster's Explosion, a huge advantage it has over Cloyster's other checks. However, it has no way to recover HP outside of Rest.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard Wall": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Cloyster most often runs two Ice-type attacks in Ice Beam and Blizzard. Ice Beam's greater PP and accuracy make it better at freeze fishing, while Blizzard's extra power gets important KO ranges, such as a 2HKO on Exeggutor. These moves' freeze chance mean switching in an unparalyzed Starmie or Chansey is never truly safe. Surf is able to hit the rare Jynx, and it has more PP than Blizzard, which can be useful in longer games. However, forgoing Surf doesn't give Cloyster many coverage issues, since the two most viable Ice-resistant Pokemon—Starmie and Slowbro—also resist Surf. Rest is essential to Cloyster's function as a wall, as it gives Cloyster longevity against foes such as Tauros and Snorlax. Explosion lets Cloyster remove or heavily damage a foe and prevents it from being completely passive against Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam. However, Cloyster must watch out for Substitute, as using Explosion on a Substitute will KO Cloyster.</p> <p>Cloyster's best teammates are those that appreciate its walling capabilities and can fill in any defensive holes Cloyster creates. Chansey is a great partner for Cloyster, since it can switch into special attackers such as Starmie and Alakazam that force Cloyster out, while Cloyster can check Tauros and Snorlax. Rhydon is also a good teammate, as it switches into Zapdos and Jolteon with ease, while Cloyster can switch into Blizzard from Tauros. One physical attacker that gives Cloyster trouble is Persian, since Thunderbolt 3HKOes it, and even if Persian drops Thunderbolt, Slash 4HKOes it. For this reason, Gengar can be a helpful teammate thanks to its great Persian matchup. Gengar is also useful for forcing opposing Tauros and Snorlax to use Earthquake, a move that Cloyster can switch into more safely than Body Slam. Cloyster's ability to lure in and use Explosion on Starmie and Chansey makes Amnesia Snorlax and Slowbro more effective, as breaking through these special walls is one of their biggest hurdles.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Cloyster holds a niche in Ubers thanks to its combination of unique traits; it has fantastic physical bulk, letting it tank Snorlax's Self-Destruct, Mew's +2 Earthquake, and Tauros's Hyper Beam with relative comfort. Its Ice typing gives it a powerful STAB Blizzard as well as an immunity to freeze. It also has access to the mighty Explosion, a potent tool in Ubers, and its signature move Clamp can choke down slower foes and provide free switches for its teammates.</p> <p>However, Cloyster is weighed down by multiple detrimental traits that prevent it from being a true oppressive force in Ubers. Its matchup into unparalyzed Mewtwo is horrendous, only 5HKOing it with Blizzard while being 2HKOed by Psychic and Thunderbolt in return, letting Mewtwo switch in with little risk. It can't reliably switch into the physical attackers it wants to tank hits from, as it becomes much worse if it is paralyzed by Body Slam or Thunder Wave. Cloyster also finds it difficult to heal off the damage it takes, as its only way of healing is Rest, which forces it into complete passivity for two turns. Cloyster also relies on heavy paralysis support to effectively use Clamp and Explosion due to its mediocre Speed and weakness to special moves.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hyper Beam can be used in place of Rest, as it allows Cloyster to finish off weakened Chansey and Ice-resistant foes. However, this leaves Cloyster completely unable to switch into physical attackers, as paralysis will permanently ruin it. Ice Beam has double the PP of Blizzard and better accuracy. However, it is significantly weaker than Blizzard, failing nearly every important KO range. Although incredibly niche, Reflect can replace Explosion to make Cloyster better into Mew and Snorlax, with Cloyster taking a paltry 30.6% maximum from Mew's +6 Earthquake and only 37.9% maximum from Snorlax's Self-Destruct. However, lacking Explosion leaves Cloyster much less threatening and much easier to answer, and physical attackers will usually just switch to a Water-type or Mewtwo to answer Cloyster, usually rendering Reflect useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Starmie, Slowbro, and Lapras switch into Cloyster with minimal risk and threaten it back with heavy damage or paralysis. However, Slowbro and Starmie have to worry about getting frozen, and all of them take heavy damage from Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outspeeds and 2HKOes Cloyster with Psychic or Thunderbolt, while it's only 5HKOed in return by Blizzard, though it must be wary of being frozen. Mewtwo becomes much worse at switching into Cloyster if it's paralyzed, as Cloyster can choke it down or pivot to a teammate with Clamp; it can also do heavy damage to it with Explosion while also preventing Recover that turn.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Cloyster despises paralysis, as it relies on its Speed and cannot afford to lose turns to full paralysis. Paralysis also makes Cloyster's chance of hitting Clamp a mere 56.25%. Cloyster's only means of removing paralysis is Rest, which is difficult to pull off successfully. This makes switching into Body Slam extremely risky.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Jolteon both outspeed and 2HKO Cloyster with Thunderbolt, with Zapdos even having a 23.1% chance to OHKO it. However, the former is 2HKOed by Blizzard and the latter is 3HKOed, so they cannot switch into Cloyster well.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can switch into Cloyster with ease, taking a mere 18.9% maximum from Blizzard and threatening it with paralysis and a 4HKO from Seismic Toss. However, Chansey has to be wary freeze as well as Explosion, as it is OHKOed by the move 74.4% of the time. Chansey is also quite passive and cannot do much to threaten Cloyster's team beyond using Thunder Wave. Cloyster can also choose to pivot out with Clamp, which denies Chansey the chance to recover HP or paralyze anything and can result in it slowly getting worn down over time.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Gengar cannot switch into Cloyster's Blizzard well, as it is 3HKOed 30.8% of the time, it 2HKOes Cloyster with Thunderbolt and can absorb Cloyster's Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx outspeeds Cloyster and 3HKOes it with Psychic, while Cloyster's Blizzard only 6HKOes in return, but Cloyster's Explosion OHKOes Jynx. However, this is often a bad trade for the Cloyster user.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blizzard is Cloyster's primary attacking option, OHKOing Rhydon 33.3% of the time, 2HKOing Exeggutor and Zapdos, and 3HKOing Tauros. Clamp can provide free switches for Cloyster's teammates. It can also be used to whittle down slower foes into KO range from another attack, but this is unreliable due to its poor accuracy. Explosion allows Cloyster to take out or do heavy damage to a foe, OHKOing frailer foes such as Alakazam and Chansey 74.4% of the time and doing a hefty chunk to bulkier foes, such as doing 60% minimum to Snorlax and 62.1% minimum to Mewtwo. Explosion also has the benefit of prematurely ending the turn, which can deny recovery on slower foes. Rest increases Cloyster's longevity and clears paralysis, but it is left completely helpless for two turns and cannot regain its Speed until it switches out, allowing Pokemon that threaten it, such as Mewtwo, Starmie, and Zapdos, to switch in and fire off strong attacks or set up.</p> <p>Cloyster necessitates paralysis support to function, so Thunder Wave Mewtwo and Mew make great partners, as they can spread paralysis across the opposing team, particularly to the opposing Mewtwo and Mew. Chansey is also good at spreading paralysis to support Cloyster, and it is a good switch-in to the special attackers Cloyster is afraid of, such as Mewtwo, Starmie, and Alakazam. Rhydon can make a good teammate, as it walls Zapdos and Jolteon, which both threaten Cloyster immensely; Cloyster also switches into Tauros's Earthquake and Blizzard well to support Rhydon. Rhydon—much like Cloyster—also benefits heavily from spreading paralysis across the opposing team. Cloyster can be paired with other Explosion and Self-Destruct users such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, Explosion Mew, and Self-Destruct Mewtwo to attempt to overwhelm the opponent and trade down Pokemon until a strong sweeper, such as Zapdos or Tauros, can win the game. Cloyster should be kept hidden until the opponent's Mewtwo is paralyzed, as once it is, Cloyster becomes far more offensively threatening. Cloyster should only use Rest if it absolutely needs to, as waking up is incredibly difficult.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Cloyster is a Pokemon with coverage limited to STAB moves and Normal-type attacks, yet despite this, it has access to one of the most diverse toolsets in RBY OU. Through the use of Clamp, Cloyster can provide free switches to its teammates while also walling some of the most prominent physical threats, such as Snorlax, particularly those running Reflect, and Tauros. It possesses a reasonably powerful Blizzard, with the ability to threaten freeze on special walls, and has the option of using Explosion on Starmie to set up a Rhydon or Tauros sweep. Its part-Ice typing gives it immunity to freeze and STAB on Blizzard, at the expense of being weaker to Rock Slide. However, Cloyster has some drawbacks that stop it from being one of the top threats of RBY OU. Firstly, not being a Normal-type means it can be paralyzed by Body Slam, unlike Chansey or Snorlax. Secondly, Clamp's subpar accuracy could prove deadly to Cloyster's pretensions, especially if it's paralyzed. Lastly, it needs to rely on Rest as means of recovery, which means it's going to remain completely passive for three turns whenever it wants to recover HP.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The options listed give Cloyster the best tools to perform its roles effectively, so other options should generally not be considered. Reflect could be used in place of Clamp or Explosion to wall Normal-types even more reliably, but Cloyster loses on one of its key supporting roles when doing so and the extra bulk is generally not needed. Ice Beam is an option, though the drop in power is noticeable; most notably, Snorlax is 4HKOed instead of 3HKOed with Blizzard, but the added PP can come in handy in longer games where neither player manages to break the opponent. Toxic, when combined with Clamp, can allow Cloyster to wear down the special walls that usually threaten it with higher degrees of efficiency; however, it's difficult to justify making space for it when all of Cloyster's default moves are so valuable. Paralysis is generally very efficient at enabling Clamp chains and already present on virtually every RBY team anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Starmie is the premier Cloyster counter; it takes virtually no damage from Clamp or Blizzard and is able to Recover any damage done effortlessly. It can also cripple Cloyster with Thunder Wave or do heavy damage to it with Thunderbolt or Psychic. However, it must watch out for Explosion, as it can be KOed if not at full health. Lapras or an opposing Cloyster can also completely shrug off Cloyster's attacks, and the former can threaten a powerful Thunderbolt or even Sing. It should be noted that if these Water-types are paralyzed they struggle considerably more, as Cloyster will now be faster, allowing it to use Clamp and switch out safely, with the only danger being the unlikely case of a Clamp miss coupled with lack of full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey and Alakazam can also shrug off Blizzard relatively easily thanks to their high Special bulk and easy, accessible recovery; however, if they are paralyzed, Cloyster has the option to partial trap them with Clamp to deny their recovery and switch out freely. They are also very vulnerable to Explosion, meaning that they have to tread carefully when attempting to take on Cloyster.</p> <p><strong>Electric types</strong>: Electric-types such as Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed and 2HKO Cloyster, with the latter having a small chance to OHKO. They must be wary of switching in, though, as Blizzard threatens significant damage, especially to Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can switch in on Cloyster with impunity, cripple it with Thunder Wave, and start setting up on it. If it's carrying Reflect, it's even worse, as Cloyster does a measly 30% to it with Explosion after Reflect has been set up. Slowbro is even more dangerous for Cloyster if it's packing Psychic; a +4 Psychic is already more than 50% likely to OHKO Cloyster. Thus, Cloyster is forced to use Clamp and then switch out as soon as Slowbro enters the field. This is risky and predictable due to the low accuracy and imminent threat that Slowbro poses.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Tauros</strong>: If Tauros chooses to run the rare Thunderbolt instead of the standard Earthquake, it can lure in Cloyster and seriously cripple it, especially if Cloyster is already caught in Rest cycles or suffers a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel Speed ties with Cloyster and can do at least 85% damage with Razor Leaf. However, it's a shaky check at best, as it's also 2HKOed by Cloyster's Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Though it does not particularly enjoy switching into Blizzards, Gengar does not suffer Clamp much, outspeeds Cloyster, and threatens a 2HKO with Thunderbolt. It is also able to completely nullify Explosion, though this is reliant on prediction.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx enjoys switching into Cloyster's attacks and threatening it with Psychic. It is faster, making it a good switch-in to Clamp, and can use Cloyster's weaker attacks to its advantage to wake up after a Rest.</p>",

          "description": "<p>This is Cloyster's best set and the one you should expect when you see it. Clamp provides a free switch to another teammate. It also does respectable amounts of damage due to having a higher Base Power than similar moves such as Wrap as well as being boosted by STAB. Blizzard is Cloyster's best attacking option, a powerful STAB move that only Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Starmie and Lapras or special walls such as Chansey and Alakazam can handle; it also has a possibility of scoring a freeze. Explosion allows Cloyster to act as a wallbreaker once its support capabilities are no longer needed, blowing up on a Pokemon such as Starmie or Chansey and allowing a sweeper to perform its job more easily. For the third move, Rest is the the most common option by far, as it allows Cloyster to perform its walling duties much more easily. However, Hyper Beam can also be used if the team favors the possibility of doing extra damage to Chansey. It is also the best option on dedicated Wrap teams, since they can't afford to lose any momentum, but those teams tend to be inconsistent and are thus rarely seen.</p> <p>Cloyster provides unique utility to RBY teams in that it provides the user with a sturdy Tauros answer, something that very few other Pokemon in the tier can do. Therefore, despite being an excellent Pokemon to lure in and KO walls like Starmie and Chansey through Explosion, it is often best to preserve Cloyster for the later stages, until the opposing Tauros has been crippled enough for Cloyster's defensive prowess to be superfluous. However, Cloyster is not simply a late-game Tauros answer; its positive matchup against Snorlax also gives it plenty of positional utility in the early stages, especially when combined with Clamp to gain free and safe switches. Managing Cloyster's health demands making many tricky decisions: switching in on Snorlax or using Explosion on Chansey early on may seem like great propositions, but they will weaken your team against the opponent's Tauros, so it is necessary to think about your long-term plans whenever you expose Cloyster to danger.</p>"

However, most of the time teams don't want two Pokemon that perform essentially the same role and vastly prefer just keeping Gengar around.

Once Gengar faints, the opponent may reveal a mono-Normal attacker, letting the player use Haunter to wall it. Many Normal-types, like Slash Tauros, drop Earthquake in favor of Glare to help against faster foes and opposing Normal-types, making Haunter a usable partner to Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Starmie, and one's own Tauros. Haunter can wall Exeggutor if it drops Psychic, letting it support Pokemon such as Starmie and Vaporeon. The opponent will also likely use Explosion less carefully with Gengar out of the picture, letting the player gain a lead if they trick the opponent into sacrificing an important Pokemon like Tauros or Exeggutor for nothing. Haunter struggles heavily against Normal-types that run Earthquake, such as Tauros and Kangaskhan, as well as Psychic-types, such as Starmie, Exeggutor, and especially Alakazam. One's own Tauros, Kangaskhan, Starmie, and Exeggutor can check and trade hits with their opposing counterparts, and Explosion users such as Clefable and Dodrio can remove them as well. Since Haunter and Gengar both run Hypnosis, it is recommended to pressure the opponent to sacrifice their slept Pokemon before sending out Haunter, so that it can put another foe to sleep.</p>"

Its typing also lets it catch Explosion from Cloyster, Exeggutor, Snorlax, and opposing Gengar. Its high Special allows it to deal solid damage with Thunderbolt and Ice Punch, and access to Explosion allows it to threaten walls and bulky foes like Chansey and Exeggutor.

Its Poison-type allows Earthquake users and STAB Psychic users to greatly threaten it. Gengar also has reliability concerns as a sleeper, as its frailty combined with Hypnosis's 60% accuracy means it may fail to put a foe to sleep before it is KOed or forced to use Explosion. Tradebacks OU also features more strategies involving early paralysis spreading compared to OU. This also frustrates it, as Gengar's base 110 Speed is one of its greatest strengths, letting it outspeed otherwise much more threatening Pokemon such as Snorlax and Exeggutor.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis is necessary to facilitate Gengar’s role as a sleep inducer. Thunderbolt is Gengar’s primary attack, allowing it to put immense pressure on the Water-types of the tier. Explosion, despite coming off of a poor base 65 Attack stat, still manages to let Gengar remove or cripple threatening foes. It is used to break physically frail Pokemon, such as Jynx and Alakazam, who are usually OHKOed, as well as Chansey with prior chip damage. It can also gain momentum on slower threats such as Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Slowbro, as Snorlax and Slowbro cannot set up or Rest off damage if Gengar uses Explosion, instantly ending the turn. The remaining move is mostly a choice between Ice Punch and Night Shade. Ice Punch can flip matchups against Rhydon and Zapdos while scaring Exeggutor with a 2HKO if one hit is a critical hit or with Ice Punch followed by Explosion, and Ice Punch also threatens to freeze most switch-ins. Night Shade deals consistent damage to everything, mainly hitting Alakazam, which takes minimal damage from Gengar's other moves.</p> <p>Gengar’s unreliability in securing sleep makes a second sleeper strongly recommended, with Sing Chansey and Exeggutor as the most common partners. Gengar can also pair alongside a Snorlax with Lovely Kiss and use Explosion, then Snorlax can put something to sleep after the opponent has sacrificed their sleeping Pokemon. Gengar is most commonly run as a lead. If it can land Hypnosis, it can then be used to pressure Water-types and wall Physical Attackers lacking Earthquake, or it can be used as a sacrifice to the opposing sleep inducer. If Gengar cannot put something to sleep before being forced out, the backup sleep inducer can try to induce sleep later. Gengar's best opportunity to switch in to try to land Hypnosis is against Snorlax. It can either try to switch into an expected Body Slam or against a Snorlax confirmed to not be carrying Earthquake, which is more common than in OU. It can also switch into non-Amnesia Persian variants after a teammate has been put to sleep and get more chances at securing sleep.</p> <p>Psychic is a possible other option for Gengar's moveset as a strong Thunderbolt alternative with the ability to fish for Special drops. It 3HKOes opposing Gengar while hitting Chansey and Snorlax harder, but this leaves Gengar walled by Starmie and Alakazam. Confuse Ray can be used to prevent Chansey from healing and to generally increase the opportunities for luck. Counter can be used to catch switches if Gengar is brought in against something it forces out—for example, Gengar can utilize Counter's damage storing mechanics after a strong Normal-type hit or Explosion KO to inflict massive damage.</p>"

It outpaces relevant threats like Jynx, Mew, and Zapdos, allowing it to cripple them with Hypnosis before they can threaten it in return. Gengar's Normal immunity carries substantial utility, letting it absorb the plentiful Explosions in the metagame for free and walling Mew and Snorlax sets carrying only Normal-type moves. Additionally, it can come in handy against Persian and Wrap users like Dragonite and Victreebel, though these Pokemon do not see much use. Gengar can use its own Explosion, armed with a fearsome 21.47% critical hit rate, to significantly damage anything that is not Rock- or Ghost-type, making problematic foes simpler to dispatch and enabling offensive teammates like Mewtwo to make progress. Aside from this, Gengar packs Night Shade to do decent, consistent damage to all Pokemon and a powerful Thunderbolt to threaten Water-types like Slowbro.</p> <p>Gengar is hindered by its inconsistency—it has to rely on Hypnosis's low accuracy, and this is exacerbated by its poor physical bulk and unfortunate weaknesses to Psychic and Ground. Moreover, while Gengar is immune to Body Slam and thus its paralysis chance, other moves like Thunder Wave and Stun Spore can still cripple it, preventing it from outpacing naturally slower Pokemon and paralyzed Mewtwo and threatening them with Explosion. After Gengar gets off sleep, it can't do much to Rhydon and Golem unless it decides to drop a move for the otherwise useless Mega Drain, and it needs Explosion to threaten many other relevant Pokemon like Exeggutor, Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo. These flaws do not outweigh Gengar's unique utilities, however, and it is a solid pick on an RBY Ubers team.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gengar's other moves are all niche at best. Mega Drain 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and restores some of its HP, but this move has no use otherwise, and they OHKO it with their Earthquakes, so it needs to hit them on a predicted switch-in. Confuse Ray might seem like an appealing option for paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo, as it further reduces their chances of threatening Gengar or healing off damage. Unfortunately, confusion is unreliable, it wears off after a few turns, and it can be removed by switching out. Moreover, Mew and Mewtwo can deal major damage to Gengar or cripple it with paralysis if they manage to hit it regardless. Seismic Toss has greater PP than Night Shade, but it isn't preferable, as it is subject to Counter and Gengar's lack of recovery means its PP advantage will not realistically matter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis prevents Gengar from outspeeding naturally slower Pokemon and, importantly, paralyzed Mewtwo, making it more difficult to threaten with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Exeggutor</strong>: Alakazam and Exeggutor threaten 2HKOs on Gengar with Psychic, and they can cripple it with their status moves. Alakazam, particularly, is faster than Gengar, has Recover to shrug off Night Shade and Thunderbolt, and is fine with being sacked to Hypnosis. Exeggutor generally does not run a recovery move, and, although Night Shade only 4HKOes it, it doesn't appreciate the damage regardless, as it pressures it into using Explosion sooner.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: These Pokemon both OHKO Gengar and take little damage from all of its moves, aside from the niche Mega Drain. Rhydon's Substitutes survive a Night Shade, so it can set up on it. On the other hand, they would prefer not to take damage if it is not necessary, as their only option for recovery is Rest, and Golem is pressured into using Explosion earlier.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros shares its Speed with Gengar and 2HKOes it with Earthquake, with a solid critical hit rate backing it up. The two usually interact as leads, so Gengar can try to nullify it as a threat with Hypnosis, but this is dangerous, and Tauros doesn't mind taking sleep for its teammates. If sleeping Tauros is not possible, Gengar's next best option for it is Thunderbolt, which only 4HKOes.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Like Tauros, Snorlax 2HKOes Gengar with its Earthquake, but Gengar's Thunderbolt only 5HKOes it. However, Snorlax does not want to take its Explosion or be put to sleep by Hypnosis, or take chip damage in the event it is not running Rest.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew can use any of Earthquake, Thunder Wave, and Psychic to threaten Gengar, but it's outsped and it despises Hypnosis. Explosion is a major threat for it, too, as a critical hit can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outpaces Gengar and OHKOes it with Psychic after an Amnesia boost or with a critical hit. Mewtwo must keep away from Hypnosis at all costs, though, and it wants to avoid Gengar if it is paralyzed: Explosion will more likely than not OHKO it on a critical hit, and a regular hit is still liable to leave Mewtwo in range for other Pokemon to finish it off.</p>",

Explosion lets Gengar remain relevant after it lands sleep, threatening sizable damage, preventing the victim from recovering if it is slower, and allowing one of its teammates to switch in for free and finish the victim off. A critical hit can notably OHKO Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Gengar is usually used as a lead, possessing favorable matchups against Exeggutor and the rare Jynx. However, Gengar stands to take severe damage from their super effective STAB Psychics or get crippled with status itself if it misses Hypnosis. It can avoid this risk against Jynx specifically by trading for it with Explosion. If paired with a backup sleeper, this can give Gengar's team room to get sleep off on a more valuable target. Explosion is generally not preferable over putting Jynx to sleep, though, as it means the team can't wall Mew or Snorlax carrying only Normal-type moves and absorb Explosions, and it can leave a more valuable teammate at risk of taking sleep itself. Gengar has worse prospects against other leads—Tauros is the most common in the metagame, and, although they share the same Speed, Tauros always carries Earthquake, which 2HKOes Gengar, or OHKOes it in the significantly likely event of a critical hit. Faster paralysis leads like Starmie and Alakazam scare Gengar out with the threat of Thunder Wave or a critical hit Psychic. If Gengar gets off Hypnosis, it can apply pressure with Night Shade or switch to a teammate that can scare the sleeping foe out. Sacking Gengar to sleep when facing a sleeper can be a wise choice—it can still take advantage of its Normal immunity asleep, and its good Speed means it is more likely to be useful if it wakes up later in the game. It should be noted that Gengar's presence on a team can dissuade opponents from using moves like Body Slam and Explosion. This can make predicting these moves and switching it in risky, as many Pokemon using these moves also have the coverage moves necessary to hit it for severe damage.</p> <p>Gengar's Explosion can help its partners make progress against the opposing team, but there a few points to consider before using it. First of all, the opponent's movesets on Mew and Snorlax should be scouted beforehand; if they carry only Normal-type moves, sacrificing Gengar makes them much more threatening. It is also important to check for any Ghost- or Rock-types such as other Gengar, Rhydon, and Golem, as they can render Explosion useless by switching in on it. Even if these Pokemon aren't present, sleeping or frozen Pokemon are often used to take Explosion, as they are not likely to be useful otherwise.</p> <p>Gengar appreciates backup sleepers to compensate for its unreliability. Exeggutor pairs well with it thanks to its resistances to Ground and Psychic and fair bulk. It can switch into Earthquake from lead Tauros and land sleep in Gengar's stead, while Gengar can break through certain threats Exeggutor has trouble with, like Slowbro and Starmie. Sing Chansey and Jynx take little damage from Psychic and can block sleep moves from the opposing team if they get paralyzed on the switch. In addition, they have Ice-type coverage to hit the Pokemon that wall Gengar. Chansey has instant recovery and Thunder Wave, letting it remain useful throughout the game, while Jynx is the next fastest sleeper after Gengar. They benefit from Gengar's immunity to Normal, especially Jynx, as its reliance on Rest for recovery can lure in physical threats like Mew and Snorlax. Offensive threats often work well alongside Gengar. Slowbro is another Pokemon that resists Psychic, and it OHKOes Rhydon and Golem with its unboosted Surf. It profits nicely from having Gengar as a teammate, as it tends to draw in Explosions and has difficulties dealing with other Water-types. Articuno and Zapdos are immune to Ground, and Gengar's immunity to Body Slam gives them room to come in safely through double switching. Articuno blasts through Rhydon and Golem, while Zapdos performs better against Chansey and has Thunder Wave to paralyze Pokemon that switch into it, like Mewtwo. Tauros can clean up foes that are put to sleep by Hypnosis and threaten anything that walls Gengar. In return, Gengar's Explosion can put Pokemon in its KO range and provide it an opportunity to switch in.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>As the only fully evolved Ghost-type Pokemon in RBY, Gengar fulfills a unique role that no other Pokemon in the generation manages to accomplish; its immunity to Normal-type moves means that it does not take damage from Body Slam, Hyper Beam, Explosion, and Self-Destruct, four moves that completely shape the tier. Gengar is also the fastest sleep inducer available, getting the jump on other sleepers such as Jynx and Exeggutor, an extremely strong trait in a generation where the sleep status is so centralizing. Finally, its high Special and Speed mean that it is capable of dishing out strong attacks that come with a 21.48% critical hit rate attached to them. This high critical hit rate also comes into relevance when Gengar uses Explosion, turning it into a very dangerous and disruptive Pokemon.</p> <p>However, Gengar also comes with an array of shortcomings. First, its Poison typing brings virtually no upsides and gives Gengar two very crippling weaknesses to Earthquake and Psychic, two of the most common attacking moves in the tier. Most notably, Tauros and Snorlax 2HKO Gengar with Earthquake, and Starmie, Exeggutor, Alakazam, and Jynx 2HKO it with Psychic, severely hindering Gengar's ability to take on these Pokemon. Second, the two most important moves in its arsenal both come with a caveat: Hypnosis has a very shaky 60% accuracy that will often prove extremely crippling when it misses, and Explosion comes off of a mediocre Attack stat, meaning that barring critical hits, it is one of the weakest Explosions in the tier. Third, since its attacking options do not benefit from a STAB boost, Gengar's damage output can oftentimes prove to be underwhelming. Lastly, despite being by no means a slow Pokemon, Gengar's Speed can still leave much to be desired, as it Speed ties with Tauros and is outsped by Starmie and Alakazam.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The most common other options include Mega Drain and Confuse Ray. Mega Drain is used with the purpose of 2HKOing Rhydon. However, Psychic already has a roll to 3HKO it before factoring in the chance of a Special drop, and Mega Drain does not turn the matchup in Gengar's favor, since Rhydon has a guaranteed OHKO on Gengar with Earthquake. Confuse Ray is used with the intent of denying recovery to Pokemon such as Chansey, Alakazam, and Rest Snorlax or providing teammates safer entry points, but the fact it is RNG reliant makes it an inconsistent option.</p> <p>Gengar can also use Submission to threaten a 3HKO on Chansey, but its accuracy and recoil make it a fringe option; Gengar will take 60% in recoil damage to KO a Chansey from full HP. Nevertheless, since a turn immediately ends in RBY once a Pokemon has been KOed, Gengar can use Submission to inflict heavy damage and KO itself with recoil, setting up a better game state for Pokemon like Moltres, Articuno, and Lapras. However, the same can be achieved with Explosion.</p> <p>Gengar can use Toxic on teams utilizing partial trapping strategies, but these are often inconsistent and luck reliant as a whole. Rest can seem like an appealing option on Gengar, but its frailty and typing mean that it is 2HKOed by a very significant number of the Pokemon in the tier, which makes waking itself up hard. However, Rest's ability to let Gengar wall Chansey carrying Thunderbolt and Ice Beam is a nice perk. The two moves can also be paired together in more stall-oriented teams, but they tend to be very niche in RBY, since wallbreaking is extremely facilitated by the way critical hits work.</p> <p>Lastly, it should be noted that although Gengar learns Seismic Toss, which has eight more PP than Night Shade, it generally does not last enough to make use of the extra PP. Additionally, unlike Night Shade, Seismic Toss can be exploited by a foe's Counter as Gengar switches out, making Night Shade the superior choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: Gengar is 2HKOed by every STAB Psychic user in the tier. Alakazam and Exeggutor deserve special mentions because the former outspeeds it and always carries Psychic, whereas the latter can use Psychic to push past Gengar and put another Pokemon to sleep. Opposing Gengar is also very threatening because one Psychic is enough to leave Gengar in range of Exeggutor's Psychic and Tauros's and Snorlax's Earthquakes, severely hindering its defensive ability. However, Slowbro and Starmie may not necessarily be running Psychic, and Thunderbolt turns the tides on them.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Gengar is OHKOed by Rhydon's Earthquake, and even if Sleep Clause is not active, using Hypnosis is often suboptimal, as Gengar is gambling a 60% chance to put a Pokemon to sleep over a 40% chance of getting outright KOed, and that's before considering wake up chances. However, Rhydon is generally more of a check than a counter, as it can usually only switch in safely once due to Psychic's damage output, and it depends a lot on keeping its HP as high as possible to be threatening.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake</strong>: Gengar is 2HKOed by Snorlax's and Tauros's Earthquake; in addition, Tauros's high Speed means that a critical hit OHKO is also a realistic prospect. By contrast, Gengar can only 4HKO Tauros and 5HKO Snorlax with any of its moves without Explosion or Special drops. Hence, Gengar should be very wary of its HP, as its ability to be threatening becomes hindered once it is in range of these two Pokemon's Earthquake. However, with Sleep Clause active, Gengar can also force both Pokemon out, since Tauros is often perceived as too valuable to risk the interaction, and Snorlax is outsped. Moreover, Snorlax might not be using Earthquake, and although doing so is rare, Tauros can also choose to drop it for other moves, significantly improving the matchup for Gengar because they can now only threaten a 5HKO or 6HKO.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Once Sleep Clause is active, Chansey can come in and take very little damage from Gengar's attacks, threatening Gengar with paralysis and damaging moves while only being wary of the threat of Explosion. In fact, with Reflect, Chansey doesn't even fear Explosion unless it scores a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Gengar is notoriously weak to paralysis. In fact, opponents often desire to paralyze it even with Sleep Clause not yet active. A paralyzed Gengar cannot block a sleep move from the opponent's Pokemon consistently, since all of Jynx, opposing Gengar, and Exeggutor carry a strong move to damage it with, and Chansey can chip it with attacking moves until it is forced to use Explosion. Moreover, Tauros is guaranteed to outspeed it, and Snorlax with Earthquake becomes a much bigger threat. Paralysis also hinders the chances of landing Hypnosis, which, coupled with the fact that a very significant number of Pokemon in the tier can 2HKO it, makes landing Hypnosis a difficult proposition. All of this means that a paralyzed Gengar will often be forced to use Explosion fairly early in a predictable fashion, making it significantly easier for the opponent's team to take Explosion in the most optimal way possible.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: As mentioned before, Gengar heavily relies on its HP to be able to switch in safely, be a check, and be more threatening. This means that chipping Gengar's HP down to the point it is in range of an Earthquake or Psychic is often good progress to beating it.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Sleeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis is pivotal to Gengar's success; it possesses the fastest sleep-inducing move in the tier, which means it can use the move before other prevalent sleepers such as Jynx, Exeggutor, and Sing Chansey.</p> <p>Despite coming off of a mediocre base 65 Attack stat, Explosion is still a very strong move that should never be dropped. Gengar's Speed also means that it will manage to use the move more consistently than slower explosive move users such as Exeggutor and Snorlax. Moreover, its high base Speed means that the move comes with a high critical hit chance, which can significantly increase the value of Gengar's Explosion by netting a guaranteed KO on almost every Pokemon in the tier.</p> <p>When used in the lead slot, Gengar is often the Pokemon one is willing to sacrifice to sleep. This means that the final two moves' value is closely tied to how effective they are against the Pokemon Gengar is matched up against early-game, since once it's asleep, Gengar's moveset will seldom matter anymore. Psychic allows Gengar to hit opposing Gengar harder than any other move. Thunderbolt allows it to hit Starmie, but the move does not necessarily flip the matchup around, since Starmie commonly carries Psychic when used in the lead slot. Moreover, non-Psychic Starmie variants often switch out of Gengar to a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Jynx in the hopes of catching Gengar switching out to a Pokemon such as Sing Chansey. However, if Starmie is not expected to carry Psychic, or if your early-game plan revolves around paralyzing Starmie and subsequently forcing another Pokemon to sleep by threatening Starmie with Gengar's Thunderbolt, it becomes a considerably stronger option. Night Shade allows Gengar to pressure Exeggutor, the most consistent and common sleeper in the tier, which could switch in with impunity otherwise. Without Night Shade, Exeggutor is not really in a rush to use Sleep Powder, even being able to use Stun Spore and Psychic instead to attempt to beat Gengar or force it out, which lets Exeggutor put another Pokemon to sleep instead.</p> <p>Gengar excels in the lead slot due to both its ability to immediately threaten sleep using its fast Hypnosis and being arguably the best Pokemon in the tier to sacrifice to sleep, since it retains a lot of its utility even while asleep through its Normal immunity. Outspeeding Jynx is especially relevant, since both are most commonly found in the lead slot, and teams with Jynx frequently do not carry any other sleeper, which creates an awkward situation for the Jynx user through both the threat of Hypnosis and the threat of Explosion paired with a backup sleeper. Some of Gengar's utility also includes deterring the opponent's Pokemon from using Explosion simply by virtue of its existence, as well as walling Tauros and Snorlax variants not packing Earthquake or Amnesia. Moreover, its typing allows it to switch into Body Slam and Hyper Beam, drawing in weaker moves such as Earthquake or Ice-type moves from the aforementioned Snorlax and Tauros for a cleaner entry to another Pokemon. These two reasons also give Gengar opportunities to try to wake up—as its foes may use their Normal-type moves again, expecting the switch—or burn sleep turns against the aforementioned Tauros and Snorlax sets.</p> <p>Gengar's perks while asleep mean that it should generally opt to hit opposing Gengar with Psychic instead of using Hypnosis. One Psychic leaves opposing Gengar in a very awkward position against Pokemon such as Exeggutor—which can now much more effectively push sleep past it, since Psychic now KOes it—and Snorlax, which can also threaten the KO with Earthquake. In fact, even if Snorlax is not packing Earthquake, opposing Gengar will still have to respect its threat and oftentimes switch out, allowing even mono-attacking Snorlax variants to capitalize on the opponent's lack of information to generate progress it would otherwise not be able to. When using Gengar for its defensive abilities, you must be very aware of its HP, because Gengar relies on it a lot to perform that job.</p> <p>Nevertheless, leading Gengar often translates into high variance and a lot of mind games in the first turns of the game. This is especially acute in mirror matchups because of Psychic's Special drop chance, Gengar's critical hit rate, and Hypnosis's shaky accuracy. Even if the opponent is not leading Gengar, experienced opponents will often try to beat Gengar instead putting it to sleep. This includes both damaging it with a strong move to create the dynamics mentioned in the previous paragraph and even paralyzing it, since opponents often prefer a paralyzed Gengar over a sleeping one. These dynamics result in several early-game mind games revolving around incapacitating, paralyzing, or attacking Gengar.</p> <p>Despite being less common than lead variants, a non-lead Gengar dodges early-game mind games and high-variance dynamics it otherwise often experiences. Not leading also allows Gengar to come in against Snorlax and Tauros early-game, since these Pokemon will generally opt for Body Slam until Gengar has been revealed—unless they have a specific reason not to, such as scouting for Counter on Chansey. This allows Gengar to turn the tables on them and immediately threaten their teams through sleep; it outspeeds Snorlax, and Tauros is often perceived as too valuable to be put to sleep, thus being forced out.</p> <p>While still worthy of consideration, Night Shade's ability to hit Exeggutor generally becomes of less importance outside the lead slot, since Gengar is subject to considerably less pressure from it when brought out from the back. Thunderbolt allows Gengar to hit Water-types such as Starmie, Cloyster, Slowbro, and Lapras for super effective damage and Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Jynx for more damage than Psychic, as well as coming with a nice 10% paralysis chance, all traits that are more relevant when Gengar is used outside the lead slot. Lastly, Psychic provides the ability to hit Rhydon hard and reliably forces Rest Snorlax without Earthquake out, two traits Gengar heavily appreciates. When kept awake, non-lead Gengar can also be more effectively used for the aforementioned defensive traits against Snorlax and Tauros, since it can actually damage them in return.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to the inconsistency and exploitability of Hypnosis and the wide range of Pokemon that can 2HKO Gengar by exploiting its Poison typing, it should be paired with another sleep-inducing Pokemon. The most common options include Sleep Powder Exeggutor and Sing Chansey. The former is the most consistent sleeper, since Exeggutor is less exploitable than Sing Chansey and packs a more accurate sleep move. However, Gengar + Exeggutor is a core notoriously weak to Starmie carrying both Psychic and Blizzard. Early in a game, you should expect to play on the backfoot at the sight of a Starmie lead if using this core, especially if the opponent also has an Exeggutor of their own. The latter doesn't have any notoriously bad early-game matchups; however, it relies on two considerably inaccurate moves, which allows Pokemon such as Alakazam and Starmie to muscle past Chansey through repeated Sing misses, Psychic's Special drops, full paralysis chance, or, in the case of Starmie, freezing it. Even against opposing lead Gengar, especially if they're paired with Exeggutor, it is not unrealistic to end up with one of Gengar and Chansey KOed and the other asleep without putting a foe to sleep beforehand because of the aforementioned early-game dynamics between Gengar and Exeggutor. Using Sing will also mean Chansey misses out on Thunder Wave or the great coverage Ice Beam and Thunderbolt provide when paired together.</p> <p>When including Gengar in teams using the Chansey / Snorlax / Tauros core, you should generally also pair it with at least one Psychic-type. Exeggutor is an especially good partner for Gengar, as it resists both Psychic and Earthquake, whereas Gengar can take the Normal-type moves thrown at Exeggutor; this creates the possibility of one granting safe entry points for the other, especially early-game when full teams are not revealed yet. Starmie also appreciates Gengar drawing Earthquake from Tauros and Snorlax, avoiding the threat of paralysis from Body Slam upon entry. These dynamics also allow an asleep Gengar to more easily burn sleep turns should it attempt to wake up. When it comes to the Normal-type trio's movesets, the presence of Gengar discourages the use of Counter Chansey, since the utility provided by both overlaps considerably, whereas the choice of the movesets on Tauros and Snorlax generally depends more on the rest of the team than Gengar itself.</p> <p>Outside of teams including the aforementioned trio of Normal-type Pokemon, Gengar can also take part in a core of Explosion users including Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, Cloyster, and Golem, which pave the way for fast potential wincons such as Tauros, Starmie, Alakazam, and Jolteon or Pokemon carrying Agility such as Zapdos to sweep late-game.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Hypno holds a niche in the tier as the fastest viable Pokemon that has access to both a sleep-inducing move and a paralysis-spreading move. This allows Hypno to outspeed and put Exeggutor to sleep with Hypnosis as well as paralyze faster foes such as Tauros, Gengar, and Zapdos and attempt to brute-force them with STAB Psychic. Hypno's biggest strength is its role compression, being a jack-of-all-trades lead that covers many matchups at least neutrally, with Thunder Wave being one of the main reasons to use it over Jynx. Thunder Wave even gives Hypno a slight edge over Exeggutor, which has to use the inaccurate Stun Spore; Submission also gives it a better time against Chansey. Hypno has decent bulk, being able to survive a couple stray hits from foes such as Tauros and Zapdos with relative ease. Hypno's mono-Psychic typing also grants it no common weaknesses, unlike Exeggutor, which has weaknesses to Jynx and Mewtwo's Blizzard and Zapdos' Drill Peck. It also has much better physical bulk than Jynx, which is incredibly physically frail.</p> <p>While Hypno does fill many roles decently, it fails to do any of these roles particularly well: it's fast enough to outspeed Exeggutor and Lapras but not fast enough to outspeed any other relevant threats, being outsped and completely shut down by Jynx. It's bulky enough to tank a few hits from foes such as Tauros and Zapdos, but it has little staying power due to its lack of recovery. Hypno also has to rely on Hypnosis to put something to sleep, making it somewhat unreliable in getting sleep off. Hypno has heavy competition as a Psychic-type lead, with Exeggutor being the objectively better sleeper, Jynx being faster than it and having STAB Blizzard, and Alakazam and Starmie having Recover. Finally, while Hypno has effectively no weaknesses, it also lacks many of the resistances that Exeggutor has, taking neutral damage from Rhydon's Earthquake, Gengar's Thunderbolt, and Slowbro and Starmie's Surf, making it much worse at switching into those threats.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Meditate can be used in place of Psychic to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis and make Hypno's Submission more powerful, with +1 Submission 2HKOing Chansey and +2 Submission 2HKOing Snorlax 75.4% of the time. However, this set is walled by Gengar and does next to nothing to opposing Psychic-types such as Exeggutor and Mewtwo. Headbutt can be used over Submission on Meditate sets to attempt to paraflinch foes. Headbutt also has higher accuracy than Submission and does more than Submission to Psychic-types but does much less to Chansey and Snorlax and is incredibly unreliable due to only having a 47.5% chance to immobilize a paralyzed foe with Headbutt. Rest can be used in Hypno's fourth moveslot to try and stall out Chansey, Alakazam, and Exeggutor if Sleep Clause is activated, but this is easily exploitable, as Hypno is extremely vulnerable during its sleep turns, becoming setup fodder for Mewtwo, Mew, and Slowbro. Psychic can be dropped in favor of running Submission and Seismic Toss on the same set, as it deals with common Chansey and Exeggutor variants within the same build. It also forces Psychic-types with Rest to use Rest more predictably, which can provide safer switch-in opportunities for Hypno's teammates, although it has a much worse time against Gengar, Tauros, and Zapdos.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Sleepers</strong>: Jynx and Gengar both outspeed and put Hypno to sleep with relative ease, with Jynx having the opportunity to attempt to freeze something with Blizzard as Hypno switches out. Gengar is less reliable at putting Hypno to sleep than Jynx, and it can be paralyzed and 2HKOed by Psychic if it misses Hypnosis, but it nevertheless is still favored to beat Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Recovery</strong>: Pokemon with recovery moves, such as Alakazam, Starmie, Mew, and Mewtwo, sit on Hypno and exploit its lack of recovery to KO it with ease. However, these Pokemon hate paralysis and will usually avoid a one-on-one interaction with Hypno. Chansey also checks Hypno if it lacks Submission.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Most physical attackers beat Hypno one-on-one, such as Snorlax and Mew if Sleep Clause is activated and Tauros if Hypno lacks Counter.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Rest</strong>: Slowbro can switch into Hypno with ease if Sleep Clause is activated, set up on it with Amnesia or paralyze it, and shrug off damage with Rest. Jynx outspeeds Hypno and 3HKOes it with Blizzard, Exeggutor with Rest also walls Hypno, although it can't do much damage to Hypno in return. Opposing Hypno with Rest also walls Hypno without Rest. Slowbro, Jynx, Exeggutor, and Hypno all avoid 3HKOes from Seismic Toss Hypno, letting them Rest loop Hypno and stall it out. However, these Rests are easy to exploit by Hypno switching out as the Rest Psychic-type sleeps.</p>",
      "sets": {

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Psychic is Hypno's main STAB move, notably 2HKOing Gengar while also doing decent damage to other common leads such as Tauros and Zapdos. Hypnosis is Hypno's only sleep-inducing move, letting it put foes to sleep and notably doing so before Exeggutor can do the same to Hypno. However, it is quite unreliable due to its low accuracy, and Hypno would rather paralyze most faster foes such as Tauros and Gengar with Thunder Wave and attempt to KO them with Psychic. Thunder Wave is a pivotal tool for Hypno, letting it come out victorious in many situations it may not have otherwise. For example, if Gengar misses its Hypnosis, Hypno can paralyze it and 2HKO it with Psychic, while Gengar is either forced to switch out, use Explosion, or attempt to land a second Hypnosis through paralysis, which only hits 44.8% of the time. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage to all foes, notably 4HKOing Exeggutor and Jynx, while Psychic and Submission do paltry damage to them. Submission 3HKOes Chansey, which switches into Hypno with ease if it lacks the move. The recoil from Submission can also be used in your favor, as Hypno can use it to knock itself out before Chansey can heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled, making it easily revenge killed by one of Hypno's teammates such as Snorlax or Tauros. Counter can be used to help against Tauros, as a countered Body Slam followed by a Psychic KOes it, letting Hypno beat Tauros in the one-on-one if it attacks with Body Slam, which Hypno can fail to do without Counter. It's worth noting that Tauros can still beat Hypno with Counter if it goes for Earthquake or flinches it with Stomp. Hypno without Counter also benefits from the mere threat of Counter, with Tauros being wary of using Body Slam on it. A Hypno with a Defense stat of 154 can OHKO Tauros with a countered Body Slam; this is achieved with a Defense DV of 1 and 29 IVs, although a critical hit Body Slam has a 59% chance to OHKO a Hypno with 154 Defense, and Earthquake followed by Hyper Beam KOes Hypno with this reduction in bulk. Hypno is the best anti-lead against lead Mewtwo and also a good anti-lead against the uncommon lead Lapras. Jynx is also a good anti-lead to Mewtwo, but it is OHKOed by Mewtwo's Self-Destruct and 2HKOed by the very rare Fire Blast.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Hypno has the best typing in RBY, serviceable base stats, and the uncommon ability to spread both sleep and paralysis through Hypnosis and Thunder Wave. While these qualities are good in a vacuum, Hypno is unfortunately outclassed by the most dominant Psychic-types in the tier; Starmie and Alakazam have Recover, while Exeggutor has Explosion, giving all three great options to play out of potentially difficult situations. Hypno, meanwhile, is stuck with Rest as its only recovery option and no way to match or break through its Psychic-type cousins in most scenarios. This means that Hypno struggles both defensively and offensively in practice, failing to find real defensive niches and to threaten much more than Thunder Wave on its Psychic-type foes.</p> <p>Hypno's niche mostly exists alongside these superior Psychic-types, rather than in their place, offering unusual options its competitors lack or struggle to combine. For example, one may use their Exeggutor to lure a paralyzed target into blocking its Sleep Powder, KO it with Explosion, and then follow up with Hypno's Hypnosis for easy sleep. However, there are two use cases for Hypno as a primary Psychic-type that are worth mentioning. Hypno is better than either Jynx or Exeggutor at sleeping a foe, spreading paralysis, and later absorbing sleep thanks to its decent Defense, which allows it to run Rest without being overwhelmingly punished, thus potentially healing its own paralysis so that it may absorb sleep at a later point. Jynx struggles with using Rest due to its terrible Defense, while Exeggutor struggles because of Ice-type moves breaking its Rest cycles. Hypno's diverse toolkit also includes oddball moves such as Submission, which allows for more pressure on Chansey than the other Psychic-types can usually offer, and it can lead to some extremely favorable scenarios with some lucky paralysis and critical hits. These advantages are incredibly specific and marginal, though, so Hypno is nothing more than a fringe pick in RBY OU.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypno can run a moveset of Hypnosis / Thunder Wave / Reflect / Rest, preferably as a lead. It allows Hypno to land Hypnosis, then paralyze any potential switch-ins, and then simply sit in place with Reflect and Rest until the opponent gives in and puts it to sleep, activating Sleep Clause to keep all its teammates safe. However, should this plan not come to fruition, this set can become entirely useless. Other Reflect + Rest sets can also exist, as these moves make Hypno generally hard to take down, but it will generally struggle with making progress due to Hypno's lackluster offense.</p> <p>Submission allows Hypno to break through Chansey with some luck between full paralysis and critical hits. However, it is pretty much useless otherwise, and the recoil will leave Hypno significantly weakened even if it cripples or KOes Chansey. Nevertheless, due to Chansey's omnipresence, it can be viable to lure it in and break through it with some consistency.</p> <p>Hypno has access to Meditate, Body Slam, and Hyper Beam, which can theoretically help it break through its Psychic-type walls, but in practice it takes far too long to set up and will usually get KOed before dealing any significant damage. If it elects to run just Meditate + Body Slam or Hyper Beam + Reflect + Rest, then it won't be KOed too quickly, but it also won't be able to break through a vast number of foes, including Gengar, Rhydon, and Reflect Snorlax. Headbutt's 30% flinch chance can give Hypno odds to break through foes in the long run, but it comes at the cost of Base Power.</p> <p>Hypno can use Toxic in conjunction with Rest to try and defeat its Psychic-type walls through extremely passive stalling, something that standard Hypno cannot achieve by any other means. However, Toxic has proven to be a generally unsuccessful strategy at high level play, with only occasional appearances and no results to write home about.</p> <p>Counter can be used to try and catch Snorlax and Tauros, but Hypno already struggles for moveslots, and spending one for Counter generally leaves it much less useful in the long term, banking almost its entire utility on the ability to land one Counter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Recover</strong>: Starmie and Alakazam are unthreatened by Hypno's entire movepool bar Hypnosis. Hypno is able to cripple them with Thunder Wave, but it is pretty much forced to switch out immediately after, as it has no prospects in a one-on-one matchup without an extremely unlikely run of Psychic Special drops.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Rest</strong>: While they do not handle Hypno quite as comfortably as Psychic-types with Recover, Rest Jynx, Slowbro, and Exeggutor can generally stop it from making progress, especially if Hypno lacks Seismic Toss. Because Hypno will force them into passivity for a few turns, they are not quite as efficient as other checks. Slowbro deserves a special mention due to its ability to set up with Amnesia against Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: While it has to respect the potential for Submission, Chansey is entirely happy against any other Hypno set, and even when Hypno is running Submission, misses and recoil can often lead to its demise.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: While not as frail as other Psychic-types, Hypno is still not physically bulky enough to shrug off attacks from the likes of Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, unless it is running the rare Reflect. All of these Pokemon can trade hits favorably against Hypno, especially if it ever attempts to use Rest.</p>",

        "Double Status": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypno's main draw is Hypnosis, as it incapacitates a Pokemon in a single turn, possibly making one would-be counter into nothing more than a momentum sink. The second best option against these counters is Thunder Wave; this won't help Hypno break through them much, but it will at least enable its teammates to do so. A number of options contest the fourth moveslot: Seismic Toss is the most common and appealing, as it is Hypno's best bet at pressuring Psychic-types. Rest allows it to stick around for longer, shrugging off weaker attacks from many special attackers, though it can be difficult for Hypno to wake up in the presence of strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon.</p> <p>Hypno's toothlessness against Alakazam and Starmie can most easily be addressed by an Explosion teammate that can lure and remove them—Exeggutor being by far the most reliable, though Gengar can also lure in the former. Once either is removed, Hypno's sleep and paralysis can actually significantly improve one's odds in the endgame. Endgames are usually left for Pokemon that are very dangerous but also very fragile, such as tier icon Tauros, for which Thunder Wave is often a death sentence. Alternatively, if one really needs to cripple Alakazam, Starmie, or Chansey for a teammate, Hypno's strong Psychic will most often force players to expose one of those three targets to its Thunder Wave, which can be very useful for specific teammates trying to break through them. Ultimately, though, this is no different from Alakazam's ability to force Thunder Wave onto special sponges, and Alakazam outclasses Hypno in most scenarios, so make sure you have further reasons to select Hypno—such as Hypnosis—if your primary goal is to paralyze special sponges.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>With a cataclysmic Attack stat that can be boosted by Swords Dance, Kingler can function as a serviceable late-game sweeper that bullies paralyzed Pokemon. With the exclusive STAB Crabhammer, its mediocre Special is largely made up for and gives it unresisted coverage, meaning Kingler is capable of dealing with common obstacles to its sweep such as Rhydon and Gengar. Furthermore, Kingler's Speed is just high enough to pose an offensive threat, being faster than defensive presences like Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax. Thus, stopping Kingler from steamrolling or breaking holes in a team can be quite difficult if the stage is set.</p> <p>However, Kingler is only barely viable in Stadium OU. Hyper Beam is massively nerfed in Stadium, so its offensive capabilities are noticeably worse. Furthermore, its low Special and middling Speed mean that any strong special attacker like Alakazam or Starmie can 2HKO and revenge kill it with ease; this also makes it very difficult to switch in. A somewhat related weakness is that Kingler's frailty and Speed reliance mean it cannot afford to be paralyzed at all. Its weakness to the abundant Thunderbolt only worsens this; many users can outright OHKO it. Kingler is monumentally reliant on paralysis support, which is very hard to provide. Due to these factors, finding opportunities for Kingler to succeed is very difficult; ergo, it is generally not recommended on conventional teams.</p>",

        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to deal massive damage to virtually any Pokemon in the tier; note that it cannot boost past +4. +2 Body Slam deals just enough damage to prevent Alakazam, Starmie, and even Chansey from using their recovery moves to stall it out; thus, they cannot switch in lest they get severely punished. Crabhammer backs this up with unresisted coverage, preventing Gengar from repeatedly switching in and threatening a 3HKO. It also OHKOes Rhydon and is Kingler's best option against Tauros even at +2; it also has a high chance to 3HKO Snorlax, meaning Reflect variants can't consistently Rest stall it. Kingler's final moveslot defines its role. Double-Edge acts as a potent finishing tool, as recoil is not sustained when it KOes in Stadium, including breaking Substitutes. Thus, Double-Edge makes Kingler more of a wallbreaker that can pressure Substitute users like Chansey. +2 Double-Edge also has a chance to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Exeggutor, which makes it a good opportunity to punish Rest. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to give Kingler safety against status and exploit resting Pokemon like Snorlax and Exeggutor.</p> <p>Kingler has a terrible movepool, but there is room for customization; usually, the fourth moveslot is the most replaceable. Stomp is the most compelling, letting Kingler fish for flinches on paralyzed Pokemon while using its strong Attack stat. Hyper Beam is technically usable at +2 for OHKOs on Alakazam, Chansey, Jolteon, and sometimes Starmie, but its forced recharge turn can completely ruin any chance of sweeping, defeating the purpose of using it.</p> <p>Kingler should be used on teams that can provide ample paralysis support, which can be a bit difficult given status protection being available in Stadium. Ideally, partners like Alakazam, Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Starmie should be used to consistently get uncontested paralysis. Jolteon is of particular note for luring in Rhydon very consistently while resisting Electric-type hits itself, thus giving it a decent Zapdos matchup. Special sponges like the ubiquitous Chansey make up for Kingler's terrible weakness to special attacks; Chansey also has access to Thunder Wave. Kingler should ideally be used when an opposing Pokemon is at its most vulnerable; paralyzed Pokemon using Recover, resting Pokemon, and those using Substitute are ample opportunities to bring it in. Generally, most of the opposing team should be paralyzed for it to be successful.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Kingler is the strongest Pokemon with access to the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam, possessing a dizzying base 130 Attack. This gives Kingler cataclysmic wallbreaking potential, outright OHKOing Chansey given the chance. It also has exclusive access to Crabhammer, which will nearly always land a critical hit, largely making up for its mediocre Special. Kingler isn't exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, being just above Cloyster and Victreebel. This means it isn't completely reliant on paralysis support and is very capable of mowing down teams without it. Overall, while an uncommon threat, Kingler is very capable of running over weakened teams if given a mere turn to set up. Even if it doesn't get a full sweep, the holes Kingler can tear in a team can be more than enough for its teammates to finish the job.</p> <p>So why isn't Kingler often seen on the big stage, fighting tooth and nail with Kanto's finest? Kingler's sweeping prospects are swiftly put down by paralysis, and this weakness often forces it out, causing it to forfeit any Swords Dance boosts it may have gained beforehand. Kingler's special bulk is also a pressing issue, with even neutral hits like Alakazam's Psychic 2HKOing it. Furthermore, its weakness to Electric-type attacks makes Pokemon like Starmie a royal pain, often causing it to be KOed even at around 75%. These factors make it deceptively difficult to find an opening for Kingler to sweep, and it therefore requires an experienced player to be successful.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Generally, Kingler should never drop any move other than Body Slam, and even this is very difficult to justify. Stomp is a potential choice, allowing Kingler to take a paraflinch approach, but it mandates far more team support to work, which teams can't always afford.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Kingler can deal sizable chip to Gengar with Crabhammer to prevent it from repeatedly switching in, Gengar KOes Kingler with Thunderbolt if it has taken any amount of damage. Furthermore, Gengar has ample opportunity to switch in on Kingler's Normal-type attacks and force sleep on the player's team, as it's immune to them.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos can switch into Hyper Beam or Crabhammer and subsequently OHKO Kingler with Thunderbolt; for Kingler to win, Zapdos has to have been chipped and paralyzed prior, and even then, it requires a +2 Hyper Beam. Much of the same applies to Jolteon, although it is OHKOed by a +2 Hyper Beam and takes very high damage from Body Slam. Furthermore, if Jolteon is asleep, it is nothing more than setup fodder for Kingler.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Kingler is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, as it can no longer mow down paralyzed teams and its poor special bulk becomes much more apparent. The threat of paralysis can make setting up with Kingler quite difficult, as it's very possible for Kingler to be paralyzed on the turn that it attempts Swords Dance. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Zapdos can easily switch in and threaten it with their paralysis-inducing moves, forcing Kingler out if it can't KO them first. Paralysis from Body Slam can be a particularly depressing experience for any Kingler player, especially when attempting to wrestle down Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros, so this warrants consideration in prolonged interactions. Pokemon like Lapras and Victreebel become much better Kingler checks if it's paralyzed, as they can outspeed and KO it with super effective hits without fear of Hyper Beam. Reflect Chansey can also be problematic, as it effectively invalidates Kingler's Swords Dance boost and threatens it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: Kingler is extremely frail specially, which makes many special attackers suitable Kingler checks, especially when attempting to revenge kill it. Switching these Pokemon in on a Swords Dance can put Kingler into a fairly awkward position as well. Alakazam and Starmie can paralyze Kingler while threatening it with 2HKOs from their strong special attacks. In fact, even Tauros and Chansey can adapt with Thunderbolt to 2HKO Kingler. However, few of these Pokemon want to actually be attacked by Kingler themselves; if they are paralyzed and Kingler has set up, with the exception of Tauros and sometimes Starmie, these Pokemon can be OHKOed by +2 Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes</strong>: While a +2 Hyper Beam from Kingler is strong, there are Pokemon that can handle it surprisingly well while paralyzing it in return. Slowbro can switch in and paralyze Kingler and doesn't mind stomaching a +2 Hyper Beam if it means stopping a sweep. However, a +2 Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam has good odds to KO Slowbro. Lapras can easily take a Hyper Beam from Kingler while threatening with Thunderbolt afterward. Exeggutor can also take most hits Kingler can throw at it and threaten with status or a 2HKO from Psychic, though it can take massive damage in the process—or even get KOed if it has taken prior damage—if Kingler has boosted with Swords Dance. Finally, if push comes to shove, Cloyster can switch in and use Explosion, though it can't do anything else lest it become setup fodder.</p>",

        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to boost its Attack and wreak havoc. Using it also allows Kingler to reapply a foe's Speed drop from paralysis, which helps if Kingler has been paralyzed itself. +2 Hyper Beam can OHKO Chansey, Jynx, Jolteon, and Alakazam. It can also OHKO Starmie and Victreebel 30.8% and 56.4% of the time, respectively. The rest of the tier isn't far behind, with foes often crumbling if even a third of their HP has been chipped off. Body Slam lets Kingler deny switch-ins by the threat of paralysis, allowing it to be more self-sufficient rather than mandating team support; if a Pokemon is paralyzed on the switch after Kingler has boosted, a +2 Hyper Beam will likely follow for the KO. Crabhammer allows Kingler to OHKO Rhydon and 3HKO Gengar, the latter of which is immune to Kingler's other attacks, making Crabhammer valuable to prevent it from repeatedly switching in. It also allows Kingler to 3HKO Snorlax 87.2% of the time, allowing it to muscle past Reflect sets. It should be noted that Crabhammer isn't just some better Slash, though; it has some very unfortunate accuracy issues, and a single miss will most likely be Kingler's undoing.</p> <p>Kingler should be kept until late-game when the opposing team has been weakened or riddled with paralysis. This gives it the best chance of setting up successfully and serving as a wincon. If an entire team has been paralyzed, Kingler will happily take a hit if it means blowing the opposition away. Finding an opportunity to set up can be difficult, though; the best way is to punish a Pokemon using Rest, such as Snorlax or Jolteon. However, simply exploiting weakened, paralyzed Pokemon also gives a worthy payoff. Kingler should ideally be paired with an Electric-type like Zapdos or Jolteon, as they can beat Kingler's primary counters in opposing Electric-types, Starmie, and Slowbro. More offensively, an Electric-type is also a perfect way to lure Rhydon in for Kingler to either set up on or cleave through, which can instantly mean a win with its Electric-type ally in the back.</p>"

Its longevity allows it to support its team throughout the game by spreading paralysis with Stun Spore and threatening foes with its powerful STAB Psychic backed up by its impressive Special.

Its subpar Speed generally forces it to take a hit before it is able to move, allowing it to be worn down more easily. While Exeggutor can use Rest effectively, it makes it passive for two turns and gives opportunities for Pokemon that can threaten it to switch in. Exeggutor also has little offensive coverage, meaning that, if it chooses to drop Explosion, it can be walled itself.</p>",

Stun Spore cripples threats, but note that it is blocked by Substitute. Double-Edge is an incredibly useful move that can pressure Chansey, Alakazam, and their Substitutes, which is ideal, as its recoil damage doesn't apply when it scores a KO or breaks a Substitute. Breaking their Substitutes prevents them from setting up Substitute again and gives Exeggutor an opportunity to land Stun Spore when they're forced to recover. Furthermore, Double-Edge also deals more damage to enemy Exeggutor than Psychic can, allowing it to wear it down and force its Rest more quickly. Pressuring other Exeggutor and Chansey into using their recovery moves lets you switch out to a teammate that can threaten them. Explosion can be run over Double-Edge to let Exeggutor trade for a Pokemon on the opposing team and allow a teammate to switch in. However, it is risky, because Rhydon is common and takes little damage from it, and Explosion KOes Exeggutor when it hits a Substitute in Stadium. Finally, Rest heals Exeggutor and wipes off paralysis and the Speed loss that comes with it, keeping enemy Exeggutor, Alakazam, Rhydon, Jolteon, Snorlax, and others in check long term. Be aware that using Rest gives offensive threats like Starmie, Zapdos, and Snorlax an opportunity to switch in and apply pressure.</p> <p>Exeggutor makes a potent lead choice in Stadium OU to status common leads like other Exeggutor, Chansey, and Snorlax and scout for Substitute on Alakazam with Double-Edge. In addition, leads that can threaten Exeggutor like Jynx are rare in Stadium OU. Later on, care should be taken if Exeggutor is paralyzed; though it can remove the status with Rest, Pokemon like Snorlax and Rhydon have an easier time putting pressure on Exeggutor, especially if they are behind a Substitute, as it will then not be able to paralyze them. Exeggutor should generally stick to the moves listed above, but it does have other options. Sleep Powder puts a foe to sleep, but it's a shadow of its former self in Stadium; it cannot hit Pokemon behind a Substitute, sleep is limited to 0-3 turns, and Rest is counted under Sleep Clause, making it useless if one of the opponent's Pokemon is sleeping from Rest. Mega Drain hits Starmie, Slowbro, and Rhydon while letting Exeggutor recover some HP in the process. Unfortunately, it is blocked by Substitute and does little damage to most other Pokemon. Egg Bomb is an alternative to Double-Edge that never causes recoil damage, but it's held back by its shaky accuracy. Hyper Beam has a surprise factor and will KO Chansey at 40%, but it's undesirable, as Exeggutor will always have to recharge after using it in Stadium.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Exeggutor is arguably the most reliable sleeper in RBY Ubers. Its relatively accurate Sleep Powder and good stats mean it will almost always manage to put a foe to sleep. This, alongside Stun Spore, allows Exeggutor to provide incredible team support that facilitates strong sweepers like Slowbro and Mewtwo. Exeggutor also has access to Explosion, meaning it will always pose a threat even after it has finished spreading its status, effectively making it a two-for-one in an ideal scenario. Exeggutor's stats are very well-rounded, boasting excellent bulk that allows it to check threats such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Mew under the right conditions. It can even check Mewtwo not carrying an Ice-type move. Moreover, Exeggutor's niche is unique, as no other Pokemon has the combination of a sleep move, a paralysis move, and Explosion. Exeggutor also hits very hard and can effectively pressure foes such as paralyzed Pokemon, Snorlax, and Chansey with Special drops from Psychic.</p> <p>However, Exeggutor does have a few flaws. It is forced out by strong Ice-type attackers such as Jynx, Cloyster, Articuno, and Lapras, as well as Mewtwo if it is carrying Ice Beam or Blizzard. Exeggutor's lack of coverage means it is reliant on Psychic and Explosion to deal damage, causing it to struggle to damage other Psychic-types and Chansey without using Explosion. Exeggutor is also very slow for Ubers, and it will usually take a hit before it can do anything, often forcing it to use Explosion earlier than it would like to. Also, Exeggutor lacks any kind of recovery, and players must be aware of the risks of switching Exeggutor in against attacks like Tauros's Body Slam.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stun Spore can be replaced by a number of options. Double-Edge can damage Psychic-types like Jynx and Alakazam more reliably. However, Double-Edge's recoil causes Exeggutor to be chipped down even faster, meaning it will likely use Explosion earlier than desired. Mega Drain is an option to 2HKO Rhydon and Golem while also healing Exeggutor a little bit. However, Exeggutor already has a favorable matchup against the two, and Psychic is usually sufficient to handle them. Mega Drain also makes Exeggutor a good Starmie check, especially if Starmie lacks Blizzard. Even if Starmie uses Blizzard, Mega Drain can stop a paralyzed Starmie from absorbing Sleep Powder and prevents Starmie from staying in after it is put to sleep. Hyper Beam is useful for certain ranges where foes might take another Psychic but aren't worth using Explosion on. However, using Hyper Beam requires good prediction and calculations, as failing to KO will result in Exeggutor being forced out or revenge killed. Rest may seem good to provide Exeggutor with semi-reliable recovery; however, it is very easy to pressure a sleeping Exeggutor with strong attacks, and finding opportunities to wake up is a difficult prospect. Being asleep also makes it more likely that Exeggutor will faint before it has a chance to use Explosion. Furthermore, a sleeping Exeggutor is a prime opportunity for setup sweepers such as Mewtwo and Slowbro to come in and wreak havoc.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type attacks</strong>: Exeggutor's weakness to Ice means it is afraid of the common moves Ice Beam and Blizzard, especially STAB Blizzard from Jynx, Articuno, Lapras, and Cloyster, as well as coverage moves from Chansey, Mewtwo, and Starmie. Any of these Pokemon can force Exeggutor to switch out or take massive damage. Notably, any critical hit STAB Blizzard will OHKO Exeggutor.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggutor's lack of coverage options means it often cannot do much to Psychic-types after it has statused them. Against Alakazam, Slowbro, Jynx, Mew, Mewtwo, or opposing Exeggutor, Exeggutor will be forced to switch out or use Explosion earlier than it would like to. Alakazam also has Seismic Toss to quickly rack up damage, which usually cannot be recovered. Moreover, these Pokemon make fantastic sleep blockers if they are paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Because it uses its great bulk to switch in often, Exeggutor is very prone to getting worn down by chip damage to the point where it can no longer switch in. Exeggutor's low Speed compounds this issue, as it will usually be forced to take two hits before it can attack whenever it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Ice Beam Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo carrying Ice Beam or Blizzard can lure in Exeggutor and OHKO it with +4 Ice Beam or +2 Blizzard. For this reason, scouting Mewtwo's set beforehand is very important.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey reliably switches into Exeggutor and threatens it in a variety of ways in return. However, Chansey is likely to be OHKOed by Explosion and does not want to be put to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Exeggutor and can outright OHKO with a critical hit from Drill Peck. However, Zapdos hates being statused, and takes sizable damage from Psychic, so it cannot switch in safely.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Sleep Powder allows Exeggutor to disable a foe for a large portion of the game, creating opportunities for its teammates, particularly the tier king Mewtwo. Stun Spore allows Exeggutor and slower teammates to make more progress against faster foes such as Mew, Tauros, and Zapdos. Psychic hits Pokemon like Tauros, Rhydon, and Snorlax for solid damage, which can quickly turn into 2HKOs or 3HKOs with Special drops. Explosion makes sure Exeggutor will be useful at every stage of the game, always applying immense pressure even if Exeggutor is at low HP or paralyzed. Explosion should be used to remove Chansey and Alakazam and deal heavy damage to Mewtwo, allowing a teammate to come in and revenge kill.</p> <p>Exeggutor should be paired with teammates that appreciate the status it spreads. Setup sweepers like Amnesia Mewtwo, Amnesia Slowbro, and Swords Dance Mew can take full advantage of a sleeping foe. Slow, powerful attackers such as Rhydon, Snorlax, Golem, Slowbro, and, to some extent, Articuno enjoy having faster foes paralyzed by Stun Spore. Rhydon, in particular, greatly appreciates having its foes paralyzed, as this can sometimes allow it to use Substitute for free. Exeggutor can also paralyze and use Explosion against Mewtwo, opening an easy path for a teammate such as Snorlax or Tauros to KO it. This will make it much easier for your own Mewtwo to sweep with Amnesia later on. Zapdos is a particularly good teammate with Exeggutor, which handles Rhydon very well and induces sleep uncontested. Note that Exeggutor's generally good matchup against Rhydon is no longer safe after taking two Rock Slides while switching in.</p> <p>Exeggutor makes a decent lead because it can consistently put a foe to sleep on turn 1. Lead Exeggutor has a particularly good matchup against lead Tauros, as it can tank any hit from Tauros and easily put it to sleep. Against lead Gengar, Exeggutor can be used as sleep fodder; and against lead Jynx, it can simply use Explosion to remove it so long as Jynx misses Lovely Kiss. However, sacrificing Exeggutor too early could cause troubles later in the game when Mewtwo or another threat may need checking. Lead Exeggutor also has a poor matchup against other sleep leads. When using Exeggutor, it is important to not mindlessly use Thunder Wave or Stun Spore early game, as skilled opponents will switch in their Exeggutor check to absorb the paralysis, creating a sleep blocker. Exeggutor's lack of recovery means it should be on the lookout for safe ways to switch in, such as against the various users of Rest and Recover on the turns they heal. Such users include Snorlax, Mewtwo, and Alakazam. Exeggutor can also switch in against moves it resists, such as Psychic and Rhydon's and Tauros's Earthquake. Exeggutor should always be looking for opportunities to safely use Explosion and scouting for anything that could prevent it from doing so. Experienced players will be able to predict Explosion the majority of the time and will switch in their Rock-type, Gengar, or other fodder to absorb it. If Exeggutor faints before using Explosion, much of its utility and potential momentum is wasted. This mandates scouting for Ice Beam or Blizzard on opposing Mewtwo.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Once widely considered to be the fourth best Pokemon in the RBY metagame as well as the best sleeper available, Exeggutor has recently suffered a drop in reputation and viability, though it remains a popular choice. A combination of Explosion, Sleep Powder, and Psychic, in addition to unique typing and solid base stats, makes it an easy pick for a large number of RBY teams. Despite the unfortunate Ice weakness, its resistance to Ground-type attacks makes it one of the most reliable Rhydon switch-ins; it is also the most reliable answer to the uncommon but threatening Slowbro. A combination of defensive utility and wallbreaking power earns Exeggutor a spot on many RBY teams; however, teams that already feature other sleepers may find it redundant, and its inability to recover damage can make it undesirable to some teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Exeggutor has a large movepool that can allow it to fill different roles, but none of the following options has seen high-level success in in any combination. Exeggutor can use Rest to get consistent value out of its strong Psychic and Stun Spore, as well as consistently check opposing Exeggutor, Rhydon, Alakazam, Jolteon without Pin Missile, and Blizzard-less Starmie variants throughout a game. However, this often invites in offensive behemoths like Tauros for free, which makes it very difficult to justify over conventional, standard sets. Alternatively, Egg Bomb hits as hard as Double-Edge and has no recoil, but its low accuracy makes it a generally inferior choice. Finally, Exeggutor has access to decent defensive and utility moves such as Reflect, Toxic, Leech Seed, and even Mimic, but these are often seen as strictly suboptimal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx</strong>: These Pokemon are often on the receiving end of a turn 1 Thunder Wave, which makes them solid switch-ins to Sleep Powder, although they must watch out for aggressive predictions from the Exeggutor user. Although they are not fully reliable in all situations, they are often the best available option to safely switch in on Exeggutor, and should be able to threaten it with Thunder Wave or Blizzard while keeping themselves healthy to answer it repeatedly thanks to Recover or Rest.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Exeggutor simply has no ways to consistently get through Chansey outside of Sleep Powder and Explosion, which come with their obvious limitations. A paralyzed Chansey leaves Exeggutor with no options other than to Explode, pray for multiple full paralysis + Special drops with Psychic, or switch out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can't really harm each other much, and unless one of the Exeggutor is able to land Sleep Powder on the other, this one-on-one matchup most often ends with one of the Exeggutor Exploding on the other to trade evenly.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Zapdos</strong>: Although they are by no means switch-ins, Lapras and Zapdos threaten a 2HKO with Blizzard and Drill Peck respectively, while Lapras also outspeeds Exeggutor and is able to threaten it with Sing, which means that either of these Pokemon find themselves in a one-on-one against Exeggutor they are generally favored.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Sleep Powder is an extremely threatening move, as incredibly dangerous Pokemon such as Tauros can switch on a sleeping Pokemon with little risk and cause havoc; counterplay to Exeggutor is often centered around absorbing it and containing its effects. Psychic is a powerful attack that threatens significant damage to anything other than special sponges, and is Exeggutor's main weapon against threats such as Snorlax. Explosion is an incredibly useful move that allows Exeggutor to bring something down with it and can create incredibly favorable situations if used correctly; however, the user must be careful of its Explosion being too predictable, as there are a number of ways to neutralize it, such as with Rock- or Ghost-type Pokemon, or sacrificing a Pokemon already affected by a strong status condition such as sleep or freeze. The fourth slot is the most contentious, as none of the four moves listed clearly outshine the other options. Double-Edge is a strong attack capable of breaking down paralyzed Jynx or Alakazam with minimal previous damage, an excellent tool to have at your disposal because both of these Pokemon commonly switch in on Exeggutor to absorb its Sleep Powder. Stun Spore allows Exeggutor to continue to cripple potential answers even after Sleep Clause is activated; this is especially useful when facing teams with multiple special sponges. Despite Mega Drain's pitiful Base Power, it ends up being Exeggutor's best tool against Starmie, and while the move is otherwise relatively useless, Starmie is another very common answer to Exeggutor, so Mega Drain has its merits. Finally, Hyper Beam is capable of sniping Starmie, Alakazam, Jynx, and even Chansey if they have taken sufficient damage before attempting to switch in into Exeggutor, but it is entirely useless if they have not, and it can have terrible drawbacks if predicted correctly by the opponent; nevertheless, its utility against every common special sponge should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Thanks to this set, Exeggutor is able to answer tier titans such as Chansey and Snorlax and apply huge amounts of pressure on the opponent's team. While its lack of recovery and susceptibility to status makes it a fairly difficult piece to maneuver with, the options in its toolbox make it a difficult threat to answer. Exeggutor players should try to damage or KO paralyzed opposing Pokemon that are able to block Sleep Powder in order to clear the way for it, as landing a Sleep Powder is often game-changing. The easiest and most common ways to find opportunities to send Exeggutor out on the field are on a predicted Chansey using Soft-Boiled or Snorlax using Rest; the former will have to respect the Sleep Powder threat and switch out, while the latter is not only scared of the sleep threat, but also vulnerable to Psychic itself. Once Exeggutor is on the field, the threat that Sleep Powder poses generates strong momentum for the player using it, but it must be followed up by strong predictions to progress the game favorably; using Sleep Powder on an incoming paralyzed Pokemon is simply a wasted turn, but so is Double-Edge on a Snorlax. The stress of prediction can be eased by sending Exeggutor on the field before paralyzing any foes, such as by leading with it. Although landing Sleep Powder this way is much easier, it is also less rewarding due to having to absorb early pressure, status, or damage on Exeggutor.</p> <p>The last detail to touch on is the usage of Explosion. Although most players are tempted to keep Explosion as a tool to get value out of a low health Exeggutor, one should try to recognize when such a line of play might be too greedy. For example, in situations where Exeggutor would not be able to make much progress at all even with a full health bar, it can be advantageous to use Explosion earlier on, when it is harder to predict and therefore more likely to hit the intended target. However, you should be careful of your matchup against Rhydon when choosing to get rid of your Exeggutor early, as it can be very dangerous to get rid of your sturdiest defensive answer to it. It's also possible to use Explosion to get rid of a Sleep Powder answer for a secondary sleeper on your team, most commonly Lapras, but this is a last resort option only in most cases.</p>"

Wrap is a useful utility move that can be used to pivot out of bad matchups and chip paralyzed foes into Hyper Beam range while keeping Lickitung safe from paralysis. Water-type coverage can be considered; Bubble Beam 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and has a 33% chance to drop their Speed, which allows Lickitung to outspeed and KO them on the next turn, whereas Surf deals enough damage to prevent Rhydon from using Substitute later.

      "overview": "<p>Rhydon’s massive Attack, STAB Earthquake, 103 HP Substitutes, and Electric immunity give it a powerful role within the Stadium OU metagame. Like in RBY OU, it blanks Zapdos and Jolteon, but it gains more depth in its ability to handle other threats with paralysis support from its team. Its Substitutes can survive a Seismic Toss, which Chansey commonly runs due to its 32 PP and ability to break weaker Substitutes. Additionally, Stadium's Substitute offers Rhydon added utility, most notably blocking Exeggutor’s Stun Spore, and while allowing it to throw off strong attacks or attempt a Body Slam paralysis with little to no drawbacks. Rest is also used by many Pokemon in Stadium, including, Exeggutor, Snorlax, Slowbro, and Cloyster; this further helps Rhydon get on the field and get up a Substitute without risking damage or a status ailment. Rhydon’s defensive typing—while not great—allows it to also be a Thunder Wave and Explosion absorber.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon is slower than all OU Pokemon besides Snorlax and Slowbro. Despite its Normal resistance, its poor defensive typing and Special allow common Pokemon such as Chansey, Tauros, and Starmie to outspeed and 2HKO with Ice Beam or Blizzard, which they very commonly carry. This means Rhydon absolutely requires paralysis support to be effective, and while this may seem high-maintenance, with proper team support Rhydon is capable of busting massive holes mid-game or cleaning up late-game.</p> <p>Rhydon also competes with Golem, which has access to Explosion—and is slightly faster than Rhydon, at base 45—meaning it wins one-on-one with its own Earthquake. However, what Golem lacks is the ability to create Substitutes that survive Seismic Toss. This makes Golem’s gameplan very prediction reliant because wallbreaking and cleaning up is much less safe. Rhydon also has the edge offensively, as its higher Attack allows it to meet better KO ranges against common Pokemon in the metagame. Finally, while Golem does outspeed Rhydon, they effectively share the same Speed tier, being outsped by Chansey and thus both requiring paralysis support. For these reasons, Rhydon is preferred on most competitive teams.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<p>Rhydon looks to capitalize on its opportunities and massive Attack stat with its standard Substitute set. Its Earthquake is the strongest physical attack in the game with no drawbacks. It can easily enter the field against Zapdos and Jolteon, as these threats fail to threaten Rhydon with significant damage or status, with it taking less than 20% from the super effective Double Kick seen on Jolteon. If Chansey is revealed to only have Seismic Toss for attacks, it can also act as a point of entry. However, it's still best to not switch into Seismic Toss, as you can switch in on a predicted Thunder Wave or Soft-Boiled for free, keeping Rhydon healthy to create Subsitutes and stay out of range of Starmie’s and Tauros’s Blizzard. Once it gets in, it can get a Substitute up for free—usually forcing a switch—to attack accordingly. Common checks in Starmie and Exeggutor risk Body Slam paralysis as they break your Substitute, which can help tremendously long term, although Exeggutor commonly runs Rest and can remove the paralysis if it manages to get it off. Not only does your team appreciate these checks being paralyzed, but next time they will be unable to beat Rhydon behind a Substitute one-on-one, as Body Slam chip damage means Earthquake 2HKOes Starmie and Rock Slide 3HKOes Exeggutor.</p> <p>It’s important to note just how devastatingly strong Rhydon is. For reference, with Earthquake it OHKOes Jolteon and the rare Gengar, 2HKOes Alakazam, Chansey, Rhydon, and the uncommon Persian and Golem, has a small chance to 2HKO Starmie, and 3HKOes Tauros and Snorlax. It’s also worth noting These are some of the most common Pokemon in the metagame. Also, if Tauros uses Substitute it will be in 2HKO range, meaning it can no longer switch into Rhydon behind a Substitute. With Rock Slide, it OHKOes Jynx and Articuno, 2HKOes Zapdos, and 3HKOes Cloyster. However, it still loses to all the threats listed above in a one-on-one situation where Rhydon doesn’t have a Substitute and the opposing Pokemon isn’t paralyzed, aside from Zapdos, Jolteon, and Gengar. Additionally, these Pokemon potentially 2HKOing or even OHKOing Rhydon means you must be very careful, as a stray critical hit or mistake is enough to put Rhydon down.</p> <p>Stadium's Team Preview is a double-edged sword for Rhydon. Knowing if your opponent has Zapdos or Jolteon is important to using Rhydon’s defensive utility most effectively. However, your opponent can plan around Rhydon, meaning a “free switch” can turn bad if your opponent double switches to a Rhydon check such as Starmie or Exeggutor.</p> <p>Rhydon is capable of fitting Rest, and it is no gimmick. With so many Pokemon often using Rest themselves or paralyzed, Rhydon can usually find a time to use Rest. It also completely walls Seismic Toss Chansey and Snorlax if it lacks Ice Beam, Blizzard, or Earthquake, using Rest to stay healthy in the face of these threats. If Rhydon happens to be behind a Substitute, you gain an extra turn at the minimum to wake up. If you do decide to run Rest, it will most likely be over Rock Slide, but Body Slam is also an option. Replacing Rock Slide gives Rhydon a worse Exeggutor matchup, as it only 5HKOes with Body Slam. However, Earthquake hits enough of your key targets, and Body Slam paralysis is very valuable to punish switch-ins and gain better one-on-one matchups. Leer and Tail Whip are plausible to negate Reflect, which Snorlax and Chansey often use. This isn’t reliable or necessary, as you’d drop a more consistent option in Body Slam, Rock Slide, or Rest.</p>"

Its STAB Earthquake is the most powerful unboosted physical attack without a downside 2HKOing Chansey and 3HKOing tier titans Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax. Rhydon is incredible at threatening paralyzed teams and is very difficult to switch into. It's no slouch defensively either; its typing lets it wall Zapdos and Jolteon as well as Mew and Snorlax that drop Earthquake. Rhydon is also immune to Thunder Wave, which makes it much harder to paralyze reliably. Its typing also gives it a Normal resistance, which allows it to absorb Explosion for other team members and switch into Hyper Beam to force a recharge turn while taking minimal damage. Rhydon's outstanding HP stat ensures its Substitute survives a Seismic Toss from Chansey, further improving its matchup against it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon is held back by it necessitating paralysis support to function effectively, as its abysmal Speed leaves it outpaced by all viable Pokemon except for Slowbro and Snorlax. This, by extension, means it despises being paralyzed itself; though it's immune to Thunder Wave, it can still be threatened with Stun Spore and Body Slam. Rhydon's low Speed, alongside its poor special bulk and weaknesses to common attacking types such as Ice and Ground, means it will have trouble in most one-on-one matchups without paralysis support. To further worsen this issue, Rhydon only has Rest for recovery, which forces it into passivity for two turns and invites in threats that can apply pressure on it or set up, such as Mewtwo and Slowbro.</p> <p>Rhydon competes with Golem for a team slot due to Golem's access to the mighty Explosion, which also prevents slower Pokemon from recovering and gives opportunities for teammates to switch in. This isn't the only advantage it has to offer; it has slightly higher Speed and 2HKOes Rhydon with Earthquake, giving it the edge one-on-one. However, it lacks Rhydon's remarkable Attack stat, which prevents it from reaching key damage ranges that Rhydon can; for example, Golem 4HKOes Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax and is unlikely to 2HKO Chansey, while Rhydon 3HKOes the first three and always 2HKOes Chansey. Golem's Substitute is also unable to survive a Seismic Toss from Chansey. Moreover, Golem's worse physical bulk and lack of access to a Defense-lowering move make it inferior against Mew. Because of these problems, Rhydon is the superior choice on many competitive teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon has few other usable moves to its name, and they are difficult to fit on a moveset. Fire Blast is an arguable option thanks to its 30% burn chance, which lets Rhydon cripple Exeggutor and Mew on the switch. While Mew is able to use Swords Dance to remove the Attack penalty, boosting moves from Rhydon's teammates, such as Amnesia from Mewtwo, will reapply the stat drop, keeping its physical attacks ineffective for the rest of the game. However, Fire Blast is inconsistent, relies on its surprise factor to be successful, and carries the risk of burning foes such as Mewtwo and Starmie. Stomp's flinch chance can come in handy against paralyzed foes, as they will only have a 52.4% chance to move. However, it's unreliable, and even with Rhydon's mammoth Attack stat it's incredibly weak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor possesses solid bulk and a rare resistance to Ground-type moves alongside a neutrality to Rock, making it one of the best Rhydon switch-ins in the game. Once it's on the field, it can threaten Rhydon with paralysis and sleep—even if Rhydon is behind a Substitute—or deal major damage with Psychic. Rhydon can only 5HKO it in return with Body Slam or 4HKO it with Rock Slide. That being said, it can threaten paralysis on Exeggutor with the former, preventing it from reliably checking Rhydon later on.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outpaces Rhydon and 2HKOes it with Psychic and Ice Beam, while Rhydon can only 3HKO back with Earthquake. Mewtwo also has Recover to heal off any damage. Moreover, it packs Amnesia and a superb 25.39% critical hit rate, so Rhydon is at risk even if it is at full HP. Rhydon can try to paralyze Mewtwo as it switches in with Body Slam, making it easier for it and other physical attackers to pressure it. Afterwards, it can use Substitute to fish for a full paralysis turn and then apply pressure with Earthquake if it succeeds. A paralyzed Mewtwo is also much worse at switching into Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Although Rhydon is difficult to paralyze reliably thanks to its Thunder Wave immunity, it can no longer outspeed paralyzed Pokemon after it is paralyzed itself, severely hindering its offensive potential. If Rhydon has Leer, it can outspeed faster paralyzed Pokemon via reapplying the paralysis Speed drop, giving it another option, but remaining unparalyzed is still preferable by far. Rhydon can be paralyzed by Stun Spore from Exeggutor and Victreebel or Body Slam from Pokemon like Mew and Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon</strong>: Cloyster, Articuno, and Lapras all outspeed Rhydon and OHKO it reliably with Blizzard except for Cloyster, which still manages to do so a third of the time. Lapras can use Sing, which bypasses Rhydon's Substitute and lets it try to put Rhydon or a switch-in to sleep, while Cloyster comes with Clamp, which destroys Rhydon's Substitute and prevents it from moving on the same turn. Rock Slide is a worry for these Pokemon—especially Articuno, which it OHKOes—but if Rhydon lacks it, they all make serviceable switch-ins, though they do not like being paralyzed by Body Slam. Jynx is another Pokemon that outspeeds and usually OHKOes Rhydon with Blizzard, but it's very difficult for it to switch in, as it is incredibly physically frail.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew has multiple effective moves against Rhydon at its disposal, 3HKOing it with Earthquake and the rare Psychic or 2HKOing it with the equally rare Ice Beam. It very frequently runs Swords Dance too, allowing it to 2HKO with Earthquake at +2 or OHKO it half the time at +4. Mew also has Soft-Boiled to remove any damage it takes in the process and Reflect to significantly reduce the effectiveness of Rhydon's attacking moves. However, it's not an ideal check; Rhydon can 3HKO Mew with Earthquake and is able to threaten it much more effectively if it is paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros has a staggering 21.47% critical hit chance as well as coverage moves in Blizzard and Earthquake that 2HKO and 3HKO Rhydon respectively, but Rhydon does significant damage to it with Earthquake, which it has no way to heal off, so it's limited as an answer. If Tauros lacks Blizzard, it becomes a much worse switch-in to Rhydon, as it cannot switch in and wi without a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Most of the time, Rhydon will only 3HKO Starmie with Earthquake, and Starmie threatens it with an OHKO with Surf or a 2HKO with Blizzard backed by a 22.46% critical hit rate along with the chance to freeze. Starmie's access to Recover might make it seem like an appealing switch-in, but it runs the risk of being paralyzed by Body Slam, which badly cripples it.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Snorlax</strong>: The uncommon Reflect Snorlax is capable of 3HKOing Rhydon with Earthquake and breaking its Substitute with Self-Destruct, and it walls Rhydon fairly reliably after it sets up Reflect. Snorlax can also paralyze Rhydon with Body Slam, forcing it to use Rest to regain its Speed. Being outsped is a major problem for Snorlax, though; Rhydon 3HKOes it with Earthquake until it sets up. Another issue is that Rhydon can run Leer, which can negate Snorlax's Defense boost while it is sleeping. Even if it doesn't, Rhydon can potentially break through it if it gets a single critical hit, which it has many chances to fish for. Snorlax also has to be wary of giving Mewtwo free setup turns as it is sleeping.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite is unaffected by Earthquake and 2HKOes Rhydon with Blizzard. Rhydon can switch out, but this carries the risk of Dragonite setting up Agility and whittling down Rhydon's team with Wrap. Rhydon has noway to reliably cripple Dragonite as it sets up, as Rock Slide only 2HKOes it,and Body Slam only has a 30% chance to paralyze it. Rhydon does have space to mitigate Dragonite thanks to its Normal resistance—it can switch into Hyper Beam, forcing a recharge turn and letting it either deal major damage or attempt to land Body Slam paralysis, and it can switch into and out of Wrap to stall out its PP.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro's Surf OHKOes Rhydon, and it can paralyze a Pokemon on a predicted switch. However, it's outsped and 3HKOed by Rhydon's Earthquake more often than not. In addition, Slowbro relies on Rest for recovery, giving Rhydon opportunities to switch in and either force Slowbro out or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel's Razor Leaf is guaranteed to OHKO Rhydon, and it has fearsome status moves in its arsenal to cripple switch-ins as well as Wrap to let it pivot to a teammate for free. However, Rhydon has a 59.6% chance to 2HKO Victreebel with Earthquake and can also cripple it with Body Slam paralysis, making it a temporary and risky switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Sandslash and Golem</strong>: Although they are rare, both of these Pokemon outspeed Rhydon and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Sandslash has some room to switch in, as Rhydon can only 3HKO it in return. That being said, it doesn't appreciate taking damage, as doing so could jeopardize its ability to sweep. Golem has much more difficulty finding a time to come in, as its Ground weakness means Rhydon will 2HKO it.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake deals massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Body Slam lets Rhydon fish for valuable paralysis on switch-ins that are not Normal-type, including Exeggutor and Mewtwo. Substitute is Rhydon's primary utility move, allowing it to scout the opponent's choices. It can then take advantage of the free turn to pressure the foe with Earthquake or attempt to paralyze it with Body Slam. Caution is advised when doing this, however, as certain Pokemon, such as Exeggutor and Cloyster, can switch into Rhydon as it sets up Substitute and force it out using Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, and Clamp. Rhydon's gargantuan HP and Defense allow its Substitute to always survive a Seismic Toss from Chansey and survive a +6 Body Slam from Mew 79.5% of the time. Furthermore, it gives it the option to fish for full paralysis against Mewtwo, potentially giving Rhydon an opening to break through. However, Rhydon has to be careful not to overuse Substitute, as it values keeping its HP dearly. If Rhydon does become low on HP, its ability to switch into foes such as Mew and Chansey is severely compromised. Rock Slide OHKOes Jynx, Moltres, and Articuno, 2HKOes Lapras and Dragonite, 3HKOes Cloyster, and does more damage than other options to Exeggutor. Rock Slide also prevents Rhydon from being stalled out by Toxic Zapdos. It isn't mandatory, though—these Pokemon are rare save for Exeggutor and Jynx, so Rock Slide is often less useful than Rhydon's other moves. Rest allows Rhydon to stonewall Mew and Snorlax using only Normal-type attacks. It also lets Rhydon switch into Chansey without getting worn down over time and prevents it from being stalled out by Toxic Zapdos. However, Rest invites in threats such as Mewtwo and Slowbro, which easily set up on Rhydon.</p> <p>Rhydon works best late-game when faster Pokemon on the opposing team have either been KOed or paralyzed. Once this support is provided, Rhydon can switch into Pokemon it walls, such as Zapdos, or foes that does not majorly threaten it, such as Seismic Toss Chansey. Rhydon is not exclusively a late-game Pokemon, however—its mid-game utility is also a force to be reckoned with, as it can switch into the foes listed above and threaten paralysis on switch-ins with Body Slam. After Rhydon is first revealed, however, this can be quite predictable, and the opponent may switch these Pokemon out immediately rather than risk giving it free turns. Rhydon can also switch into a predicted Hyper Beam or Explosion, though it needs to be careful; Pokemon that carry these moves often have coverage for Rhydon. Finally, Rhydon can switch into Thunder Wave and recovery moves like Soft-Boiled and Rest. Substitute should be used carefully; Rhydon has no way to recover outside of Rest, and the HP reduction from using Substitute can put it into range of many threats after it's broken, such as Mewtwo's Ice Beam and a 2HKO from Exeggutor's Psychic. Rhydon should only use Substitute when it is more advantageous to set up one compared to just attacking, such as when the opponent is likely to sacrifice a Pokemon.</p> <p>Bringing paralysis inducers alongside Rhydon is essential given its poor Speed. Starmie and Chansey are excellent teammates, as they take little damage from Ice-, Psychic-, and Water-type moves and possess the coverage to help against Pokemon that trouble Rhydon, like Exeggutor and Slowbro. Slowbro has an identical typing to Starmie and is more effective at luring in Mewtwo and enemy Starmie to paralyze them. In addition, it appreciates Rhydon's ability to block Electric moves and take Explosion, a move Slowbro often attracts. Zapdos is effective against Water-types and Exeggutor and stops Mew carrying only Earthquake in its tracks. However, both Rhydon and Slowbro are very slow, making them somewhat shaky partners. Cloyster can be serviceable partner to Rhydon alongside Thunder Wave Mew and Mewtwo, as Cloyster can cover many matchups Rhydon struggles into, such as Tauros, while Rhydon walls the Electric-types that Cloyster struggles against. However, Cloyster + Rhydon is extremely weak to unparalyzed Mewtwo. Exeggutor is another decent choice that packs Sleep Powder, useful resistances to Ground and Psychic, and Explosion to give Rhydon another opportunity to come in. Rhydon helps these Pokemon in return by stonewalling Zapdos and breaking through paralyzed Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo. Though Tauros only has Body Slam for paralysis support, it boasts a great Speed stat, perfect coverage, and a considerable critical hit rate, and it tends to draw in and pressure Pokemon that cause difficulties for Rhydon, such as Mewtwo and Exeggutor. Rhydon makes a great partner to Mew with Earthquake as its sole attacking option, as Rhydon can switch into and wall Zapdos, which walls this Mew set, and Mew can spread paralysis across the opposing team, which Rhydon appreciates greatly.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Rhydon possesses a very important place in RBY OU thanks to a fairly unique typing and formidable Attack stat; moreover, its Earthquake is the most powerful physical attack in the game without a drawback. Rhydon's typing gives it a good amount of defensive utility, such as switching in to force and punish Hyper Beam recharges, taking Explosions, staving off Thunder Wave, and stonewalling Zapdos and Jolteon. Thanks to its immense Attack stat, Rhydon can hit very high damage ranges, most notably a guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey. It's also capable of KOing Tauros after two Body Slams from your own Tauros. This power makes it very difficult to switch into, with would-be checks such as Exeggutor taking surprising damage. While initially slow, Rhydon is also very scary for paralyzed teams to fight—they often fold to it outright. Naturally, this means it appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Chansey. It can still outspeed Slowbro and Snorlax, however, to force damage if they lack Reflect.</p> <p>Golem has competed with Rhydon for a teamslot for many years. Golem has the strongest Explosion in the game, only beaten by Snorlax's Self-Destruct, along with slightly higher Speed to win against Rhydon specifically. However, because Golem's niche hinges on Explosion, it often has to eschew Substitute. The lower damage output also causes Golem to lose out on some very valuable ranges, notably losing to Reflect Chansey more often than not, which Rhydon excels against. Due to these factors, Rhydon is generally favored over Golem in the metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Out of all of Rhydon's moves, the most replaceable would be Rock Slide. This is because its coverage is rather specific, while the other listed moves add key utility. When dropping Rock Slide, be wary of the lower damage output, such as only 4HKOing Cloyster and 3HKOing Lapras with Earthquake, as well as the loss of coverage against Articuno and Moltres. Should these qualities be useful, Body Slam can be dropped instead. In this case, though, Rhydon can't set up paralysis for itself, making it much more reliant on teammates and matchups against threats such as Starmie noticeably worse.</p> <p>Rest can be used to give Rhydon more longevity, but it's hard to wake up due to being 2HKOed by Tauros. Rest is generally used on more defensive teams to better handle Zapdos and Jolteon throughout a game, but it's also extremely helpful against Reflect Chansey, enabling Rhydon to be more aggressive and freely burn Rest turns behind Substitute. It also helps against Snorlax without coverage, as Rhydon despises being paralyzed by Snorlax on the switch. Another option is Leer to beat Reflect Chansey much more reliably and potentially get past Reflect Snorlax. However, these Pokemon can switch out to get rid of the Defense drops. Using Leer also lets faster Pokemon switch in while taking no damage, which can give the opponent opportunities to play around Rhydon's usual sweeping. In contrast, when spamming Earthquake, a critical hit still ruins Reflect Chansey and Snorlax, and switch-ins will likely take damage. Counter can be used to more heavily punish Hyper Beam and Explosion—bringing in Rhydon after a foe's Explosion and using Counter after forcing their switch-in out can usually lead to a free KO. While gimmicky, Bubble Beam could be used for other Rhydon or Golem; if it drops Speed, it guarantees a KO with Earthquake. It can also allow Rhydon to move first against Exeggutor switch-ins, allowing it to situationally win the interaction should Exeggutor be worn down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is the best check for Rhydon in the game. It resists Earthquake and is only 4HKOed by Rock Slide. However, it must watch out for Body Slam. In fact, Rhydon will usually use Body Slam expecting an Exeggutor switch-in if it's still healthy. A paralyzed Exeggutor won't be able to reliably check Rhydon anymore, as two Rock Slides will deal upwards of 55% of damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and can 2HKO Rhydon with Blizzard in return, which, when combined with Tauros's absurdly high critical hit rate and the chance of freeze, means that Rhydon is almost always forced out. Even if it doesn't switch out, there's a respectable chance that it does absolutely nothing in return. However, Tauros doesn't appreciate being damaged, especially if the Tauros on Rhydon's team is still at full HP. After Rhydon KOes a Pokemon, Tauros can usually force it out and start exerting its sweeping prowess.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster is only 4HKOed by Earthquake and 3HKOed by Rock Slide, and it can OHKO a third of the time in return with Blizzard. It even packs Clamp for denying a free move to Rhydon behind a Substitute, as Clamp will break the Substitute and render Rhydon immobile in the process.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Chansey</strong>: These two Pokemon are able to switch in on Rhydon and duel it, but only if they are not paralyzed, and Chansey requires Reflect. Chansey is 2HKOed by Earthquake, and Starmie, while very rarely 2HKOed by Earthquake, can be paralyzed by Body Slam on the switch or on a predicted Recover, turning the tides in Rhydon's favor. The paralysis factor makes these matchups extremely variable.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel outspeeds and OHKOes Rhydon with Razor Leaf. However, it takes a huge chunk of damage from Earthquake, which is a likely 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro threatens to OHKO Rhydon with Surf, and with Reflect, it can effortlessly set up Amnesia against it. It can also use Thunder Wave when predicting a switch to worsen the situation. However, it does take significant damage coming in, making it a check at best.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Jynx</strong>: These Pokemon can OHKO Rhydon with their Ice-type moves, but they struggle to switch in because of the threat of Rock Slide, as it will almost always 2HKO Lapras and always OHKO Jynx. Paralyzing them also turns them into prey for Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem outspeeds Rhydon and 2HKOes it with Earthquake. However, Rhydon also 2HKOes Golem with its own Earthquake, meaning Golem cannot switch in at all.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Snorlax</strong>: While Rhydon is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and Ice Beam, it struggles heavily to actually KO Snorlax without critical hits if Reflect is active. Earthquake can deal up to 38% before Reflect goes up, but after that, the damage is negligible at best. Reflect Snorlax does give Rhydon a good number of opportunities to fish for critical hits, so this matchup can be quite volatile. Snorlax also has issues switching in, making it a check at best.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rhydon's Earthquake is the strongest physical move in the game with no drawbacks, hitting anything that doesn't resist it extremely hard. Rock Slide covers Zapdos and hits Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Lapras harder. Body Slam is extremely valuable, allowing Rhydon to generate its own paralysis support against the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and Lapras. Rhydon's Substitute is hard for inexperienced players to understand the true potential of, but it can single-handedly win games. Its Substitute tanking one Seismic Toss gives Rhydon the edge one-on-one against Chansey, though Ice Beam still stings. Also, Rhydon can create Substitutes versus Pokemon that can't significantly damage it, such as Zapdos and Jolteon, giving it a free hit against whatever comes in afterwards. This can instantly win the game or impart a huge chunk of damage to a replacement like Tauros. Substitute is also extremely helpful against paralyzed Starmie, letting Rhydon fish for full paralysis to stay in. Rhydon can then go for the uncommon 2HKO with Earthquake or even a possible OHKO with a critical hit.</p> <p>Despite being slow, Rhydon is very hard to switch into if you lack Exeggutor, making it one of the key reasons for Exeggutor's success in RBY OU. It's an absolute nightmare for paralyzed teams, easily rampaging through them. It's very viable to build a team around Rhydon, providing it the paralysis support it needs to clean up. Its key immunity to Electric-type moves, namely Thunder Wave, means it's very hard to reliably paralyze and gives it switch-in opportunities on Pokemon such as Alakazam and Chansey. It is also the premier counter to Zapdos and Jolteon, two Pokemon that can be very dangerous in its absence—especially Zapdos—due to the few Electric-resistant Pokemon in RBY OU. Rhydon also resists Normal, which means it can switch into a predicted Explosion or Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Despite all of the advantages, Rhydon is heavily reliant on opposing Pokemon being paralyzed to get in safely. It has very poor Special; this and its typing can make it easy prey for almost every special attacker in the tier. As a result, Rhydon tends to struggle one-on-one against non-paralyzed threats, notably Tauros, Starmie, and Exeggutor.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Chansey's unrivaled special bulk and exceptional movepool make it a staple of Stadium OU and mandatory on most teams. Its ability to paralyze foes, heal itself, and steadily chip away at the foe's HP throughout a match grant it an outstanding defensive presence. Chansey can even set up Reflect to increase its physical bulk and take on strong physical attackers like Snorlax. Despite it lacking a Psychic-type resistance, its sheer bulk is more than enough to let it switch into the tier's various Psychic users and force them to waste valuable PP. Another benefit of Chansey's titanic special bulk is that it can serve as an excellent paralysis absorber, making further status attempts much more difficult. It's also a potential user of Stadium's buffed Substitute against paralyzed foes, as no unboosted special move can break its Substitute in one hit.</p> <p>Chansey's main weakness is its pitiful Defense stat, which leaves it easily overwhelmed by common physical attackers like Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon. This is compounded by its rather lackluster offensive presence despite its amazing movepool and high Special; without the right attacking move, like Ice Beam for Rhydon and Seismic Toss for Alakazam, it has the tendency to just sit there and eventually fall to critical hits, Special drops, or running out of Soft-Boiled PP. Chansey's Speed leaves it outsped by the majority of the tier, forcing it to usually take two hits when switching in. Despite it being an excellent paralysis absorber, a paralyzed Chansey is very susceptible to losing to RNG, as Alakazam and Starmie have decent odds of eventually breaking through Chansey with Psychic. Stadium's mechanic changes are a double-edged sword for Chansey; the nerf to Hyper Beam means Chansey is significantly less threatened by many physical attackers, especially Tauros. However, Rest and Substitute being more common means that Chansey is more susceptible to being walled or stalled out. The changes to critical hit rates makes some foes like Tauros weaker against Chansey, while others like Snorlax and Rhydon have a much higher likelihood of getting lucky against it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can score some stylish KOs against Snorlax and Tauros on sets not using Substitute, but once the opponent is aware of it, it's much less useful. Defense Curl is an alternative over Reflect, with its massive 61 PP helping in prolonged PP wars. However, it requires extra turns to set up, leaving Chansey far more vulnerable. Sing can provide sleep support, but it's ill-advised due to Substitute and the nerfs to Sleep in Stadium OU.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's Body Slam 3HKOes Chansey, and its 24 PP will eventually beat Chansey's 16 PP of Soft-Boiled. In return, Chansey generally threatens a 6HKO with Seismic Toss, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam. Sets carrying Reflect can PP stall Snorlax's attacking moves, though Snorlax still has good odds of breaking through with critical hits, as its rate is about 10.3% in Stadium. Hyper Beam also threatens Chansey considerably, as it does a minimum of 67.1% and thus OHKOes with a critical hit. If Chansey gets paralyzed, it tends to lose quickly, as a single full paralysis can end it and Snorlax can clear paralysis from itself with Rest to outpseed Chansey. In the short-term, however, an unparalyzed Chansey can usually force Snorlax to use Rest, and while Snorlax has little reason to switch out, it can be threatened by Chansey's teammates. Snorlax carrying Ice Beam can threaten to freeze an unparalyzed Chansey, though this goes both ways. Snorlax must also be wary of Counter. In a pinch Snorlax can use Self-Destruct to OHKO Chansey, though Reflect and Substitute can both prevent this.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: Alakazam generally wins one-on-one against Chansey with a combination of Psychic Special drops, critical hits, and full paralysis. Chansey paralyze Alakazam and can force it to use up valuable Psychic PP, but Alakazam will usually win PP wars due to Recover and Seismic Toss having 32 PP. Chansey lacking Seismic Toss also cannot break through Alakazam's Substitutes in one hit, allowing Alakazam to avoid getting paralyzed. Starmie is in a similar situation, though it might not always run Psychic, generally has fewer PP than Chansey in total, and loses to Chansey variants carrying Thunderbolt. However, it can try to freeze Chansey using Ice Beam and Blizzard. Chansey can also use Ice Beam to try to freeze an unparalyzed Alakazam or Starmie, however.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Rhydon's Earthquake almost always 2HKOes Chansey, and thus its boosted 11.3% critical hit rate will almost always OHKO; Chansey's Seismic Toss doesn't even break Rhydron's Substitute, making it favored to win in one-on-one. However, Chansey does outspeed Rhydon, so it must be wary of an unparalyzed Chansey carrying Ice Beam, which 2HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey carrying Ice Beam usually beat opposing unparalyzed Chansey lacking it. However, Seismic Toss variants beat Ice Beam variants one-on-one if freeze if off the table. Reflect Chansey also tends to be effective at PP stalling other Chansey variants, especially when paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Explosion from foes like Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Golem can often OHKO Chansey outright. Gengar's Explosion fails to OHKO, though it still does 72% minimum. Reflect can allow Chansey to survive at least one Explosion when at full health, though many users can outspeed and attack before Chansey can set up. Explosion also immediately ends the turn, and thus Chansey is often easy pickings for a faster teammate afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Seismic Toss only 4HKOes Slowbro and Ice Beam does negligible damage, so Slowbro can paralyze Chansey with Thunder Wave and use it as setup fodder. However, Slowbro is threatened by Thunderbolt, and Chansey's higher critical hit rate gives it an easier time breaking through Slowbro in Stadium. Slowbro also cannot reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, so if it gets paralyzed it will still be slower than Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Fast Normal-types</strong>: Tauros's Body Slam and Double-Edge 3HKO Chansey, and even Reflect sets must be wary due to its massive critical hit rate; Double-Edge notably does upwards of 80% with a critical hit. Persian's Slash ignores Reflect and has a 53.8% chance to 2HKO. In return, Chansey can generally only 4HKO them with Seismic Toss, Ice Beam, or Thunderbolt. However, both Pokemon are reliant on their Speed, so they fear Thunder Wave, though both can run Substitute, sometimes leaving Chansey in an awkward 50/50. Chansey sets using Counter can also KO them outright.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: Jolteon carrying Rest can use its high critical hit rate, paralysis from Thunder Wave, and Double Kick to PP stall Chansey's Soft-Boiled. However, it must be wary of Chansey's teammates when asleep due to its frailty.</p> <p><strong>Focus Energy</strong>: Users of Focus Energy like Flareon and Nidoking can 2HKO Chansey through Reflect and overwhelm it one-on-one. However, these options are extremely niche.</p>",

        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<p>Reflect lets Chansey take on physical attackers, notably Snorlax, more effectively. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage and puts pressure on paralyzed foes. Its 32 PP also helps it win certain PP wars, such as against opposing Chansey when paralyzed. Ice Beam is an alternative, letting Chansey fish for freezes on opposing Chansey, Snorlax, and other big threats. It also targets foes weak to Ice, notably threatening Exeggutor, which can otherwise use Rest to stall out Seismic Toss, and 2HKOing Rhydon, though it does minimal damage to foes with high Special bulk, like Snorlax and Alakazam, making Chansey extremely passive once Freeze Clause has activated. Soft-Boiled serves as reliable recovery, and Thunder Wave lets Chansey spread paralysis and assist with speed control. However, Chansey must be wary of Substitute.</p> <p>This set acts as a check to Snorlax, as Reflect and its immunity to Body Slam paralysis let it wall most variants; it can easily switch in, set up Reflect, and proceed to force Snorlax to switch out or use Rest, freeing up teammates for other roles. Given that Snorlax will be seen on every team, often as an early-game wallbreaker, Chansey is a natural partner to the variety of Pokemon that struggle against it, like Alakazam, physical-centric Snorlax sets, and Starmie. This is especially notable since Reflect Snorlax is a shakier check to Snorlax in Stadium OU given the increased prevalence of Ice Beam. However, Snorlax lands critical hits twice as often in this format, making Reflect less effective against it. Beyond Snorlax, Chansey naturally lures in a lot of physical attackers, so it can use the opportunity to set up Reflect and gain momentum to paralyze another foe or fish for a freeze. Tauros and Persian still threaten Chansey through Reflect thanks to their high critical hit chances, but these fast physical attackers rely on their Speed to function, so they are very afraid of Thunder Wave. If Chansey is running Seismic Toss, Rhydon is an especially bad matchup. Chansey cannot break its Substitute in one hit, while Rhyhdon can repeatedly hit Chansey with Earthquake until it gets a critical hit, which is about an 11.3% chance in Stadium and is an almost guaranteed OHKO. Chansey also doesn't enjoy facing Alakazam and Starmie: they can paralyze Chansey with Thunder Wave, and while it can force them to waste PP and threaten them with its own Thunder Wave, they will usually win one-on-one. Chansey must manage its status carefully. Once paralyzed, it's a very shaky answer to opposing physical attackers, including Snorlax, the Pokemon teams often rely on it to check; it also becomes extremely vulnerable to Rhydon. However, being paralyzed does make it immune to freeze, helping it beat opposing unparalyzed Chansey when carrying Ice Beam.</p>"
        },
        "BoltBeam": {
          "description": "<p>Thunderbolt and Ice Beam make up the classic BoltBeam combo, which provides unresisted coverage. Ice Beam notably 2HKOes Rhydon and hits common foes like Exeggutor and Zapdos super effectively. It's crucial in helping Chansey fend off opposing unparalyzed Chansey and Snorlax in freeze wars, allowing it to avoid getting PP stalled. Thunderbolt primarily targets Water-types like Starmie and Cloyster. Soft-Boiled serves as reliable recovery, while Thunder Wave lets Chansey act as speed control, notably preventing speedy physical attackers like Tauros and Persian from trying to break through Chansey freely.</p> <p>Chansey's combination of BoltBeam and Thunder Wave makes it threatening to the majority of Stadium OU and thus a natural fit for teams looking for the extra coverage. This set notably beats Starmie very consistently. Due to its lack of Seismic Toss, Alakazam takes minimal damage from Chansey's attacks and can easily break through Chansey with Special drops, critical hits, and full paralysis from Thunder Wave. Even if it runs out of Psychic PP, it will usually win a PP war. Variants carrying Substitute can be troublesome, as they can use it to dodge status and try to break through Chansey more safely. A check to Alakazam such as Double-Edge Exeggutor can assist in this matchup, but Substitute Alakazam has very limited attacking PP and is easily stalled. Chansey must be very careful about taking paralysis; as much as it likes the immunity to being frozen, it's completely destroyed by Snorlax afterwards, so it must manage its status carefully or have a partner that can switch into Snorlax for it.</p>"

Since no unboosted special attack can break through its Substitutes in one hit, Chansey can wall paralyzed Alakazam and Starmie without risking paralysis or Special drops. It can then proceed to PP stall Psychic; its Substitutes also exceed 100 HP and thus require Alakazam and other Seismic Toss users to use up two Seismic Toss PP trying to break through them. However, Chansey is outsped by these Psychic-types, so it relies on its teammates to paralyze them, and thus unable it's to play in the early game much at all. Since Self-Destruct and Explosion KO the user when they connect with a Substitute in Stadium, Chansey can use it to block attempts by slower or paralyzed users. Seismic Toss is an excellent way for Chansey to spread consistent damage and pressure foes like the Psychic-types, though Ice Beam lets Chansey beat Rhydon with consistency. Ice Beam also allows Chansey to threaten foes like Chansey and Snorlax and avoid PP wars, while Substitute will prevent Chansey from getting statused by its foe. However, Ice Beam does negligible damage to Starmie and Lapras. Thunder Wave lets Chansey paralyze faster foes, primarily targeting speedy physical attackers like Tauros and Persian.</p> <p>Counter is a niche option on this set that can punish physical attackers. The most notable example is Snorlax, as sets lacking Earthquake or Amnesia can only break Chansey's Substitute in one hit by using Body Slam, forcing it to lose around 67% of its health. Additionally, Persian is OHKOed by Counter, and Tauros will only survive on one HP when at full health. Counter also OHKOes Snorlax and Tauros if they use Body Slam when Substitute is not up.</p> <p>Chansey is reliant on opposing Psychic-types and Chansey being paralyzed for its Substitute to protect it, leaving paralysis support essential. Thunder Wave from one's own Alakazam and Starmie as well as Stun Spore from Exeggutor work effectively in this regard. Chansey should avoid getting paralyzed, as paralysis makes it less consistent against Alakazam and Starmie and leaves Chansey easily overwhelmed by physical attackers like Snorlax and Rhydon.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Chansey holds a strong niche in Ubers due to having the best Special bulk in the game; it's one of the best switch-ins available to special attackers such as Starmie, Alakazam, and particularly tier titan Mewtwo, taking a mere 21.4% maximum from its STAB Psychic and threatening it and its team with paralysis and sleep. It can also switch into Mew when healthy and threaten it with paralysis, as it survives all of Mew's regular attacks even at +2. It is one of the most reliable paralysis spreaders in the tier thanks to its access to reliable recovery and consistent entry points.</p> <p>However, outside of threatening status, Chansey is extremely passive, as Seismic Toss can only 4HKO or 5HKO most foes, and it completely thuds into Rhydon, failing to break its Substitute. Ice Beam, meanwhile, does not particularly threaten non-Ice weak foes. Chansey can't even wall Mewtwo well in the long term, as it takes 44.2% minimum from a +4 Mewtwo Psychic; even with Light Screen it can easily be overwhelmed by Special drops and critical hits. Mewtwo can also use Self-Destruct or Submission to break through Chansey. It also can very easily run out of Soft-Boiled PP in longer games. Its low base Speed, which leaves it outsped by every relevant threat outside of Snorlax, Rhydon, and Slowbro, along with its physical frailty, notably being 2HKOed by Rhydon's Earthquake and taking 38.1% minimum from a Snorlax Body Slam, can at times make Chansey quite exploitable and a potential liability on teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sing can be dropped if there is already a sleeper on Chansey's team, such as an Exeggutor or Jynx, and Light Screen is droppable for teams that are not dedicated to stalling. Counter can be used to OHKO Snorlax and Tauros by returning damage from Body Slam, and it also OHKOes Mewtwo using Submission and Mew using +2 Body Slam. However, Counter becomes practically useless once it is revealed and can easily be scouted by Snorlax, Mew, and Tauros with Earthquake. Reflect makes Chansey far better into physical attackers such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Zapdos, and it also allows Chansey to survive Self-Destruct and Explosion. However, Reflect leaves Chansey without many tools to adequately deal with Mewtwo and other special attackers outside of paralysis. It also has a major Soft-Boiled PP issue, as it cannot stall Mewtwo or Slowbro at all. Thunderbolt can be used alongside Ice Beam to give Chansey perfect coverage and deal super effective damage to many threats, such as Water-types. However, Water-types are quite uncommon, so Chansey rarely has to give up a moveslot to cover for them. On top of this, this perfect coverage still does not threaten Mewtwo or Mew in the slightest. Flash allows Chansey to prevent Mewtwo and Mew from setting up safely in front of it and reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, but it is inaccurate and fishing for misses is inherently unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Paralyzed Mewtwo can switch into Chansey and start boosting with Amnesia, 2HKOing Chansey with +4 Psychic 20.2% of the time while only being 5HKOed in return by Seismic Toss. Even with Light Screen, Chansey can be overwhelmed by Psychic Special drops and critical hits, especially if it's paralyzed. Chansey also has to be wary of the rare Submission Mewtwo, which 2HKOes it 86.7% of the time. Mewtwo can also use Self-Destruct, which does 80.3% minimum. However, if Mewtwo is unparalyzed, it should be wary of switching in due to Sing, and it becomes far more vulnerable to physical attackers if it becomes paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Paralyzed Mew can switch into Chansey quite easily, tanking Seismic Toss and Ice Beam well and threatening it in return with Thunder Wave and boosted physical attacks. UnparalyzedMew has to be cautious of Sing and dislikes paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is only 6HKOed by Seismic Toss and Ice Beam, and it threatens Chansey back with a KO from Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam. It also OHKOes Chansey with Self-Destruct, but Snorlax hates paralysis if it lacks Rest.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Rhydon is immune to Thunder Wave and is only 5HKOed by Seismic Toss, letting it set up a Substitute in front of Chansey with ease and 2HKO it with Earthquake. However, Rhydon has to be conservative with its HP, as it lacks recovery bar Rest and can find itself worn down quickly. Rhydon also has to be wary of Ice Beam, as it's 2HKOed by the move.</p> <p><strong>Explosion users</strong>: Explosion and Self-Destruct users, such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, Mew, Mewtwo, Cloyster, Gengar, and Golem, all OHKO or do heavy damage to Chansey with the move. Snorlax's Self-Destruct and Golem's Explosion OHKO Chansey, while Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Mew's Explosion are heavily favored to OHKO it. Mewtwo's Self-Destruct and Gengar's Explosion never OHKO Chansey, but both still deal significant damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can switch into Chansey lacking Sing and Thunderbolt with ease, as it's only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and takes barely any damage from Ice Beam. Slowbro threatens Chansey with Thunder Wave and boosted Surf, 2HKOing it 76.2% of the time with +6 Surf and 4HKOing it 88.4% of the time if it has Light Screen up. Slowbro only has to be wary of its predictable Rest being exploited by the likes of Mewtwo, Snorlax, and Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Chansey, can paralyze it, and 3HKOes it with Drill Peck 76.2% of the time. It also has Agility to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. However, Zapdos is 3HKOed by Ice Beam and 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, and it needs critical hits or full paralysis to break through Chansey. However, with the amount of turns Chansey needs to KO Zapdos safely, it is likely that Zapdos will break through it.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and Ice Beam and KOes Chansey in return with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam. However, Tauros becomes far less threatening once paralyzed and can only reliably beat Chansey one-on-one if Chansey is also paralyzed, so it should only fight Chansey if it absolutely has to.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Sing": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Chansey can switch into Mewtwo and other special attackers and attempt to land Sing, as Mewtwo usually cannot risk being put to sleep. Seismic Toss threatens consistent damage on every foe in the tier, 4HKOing or 5HKOing most foes and forcing predictable recovery turns from the likes of Starmie, Alakazam, Mewtwo, and Mew, which can be exploited to switch in strong physical attackers, such as Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros. However, Seismic Toss can be exploited by Rhydon, as its Substitute is not broken by the move. Ice Beam 2HKOes Ground-types and threatens freeze on unparalyzed foes; however, it has far less PP than Seismic Toss and does pathetic damage to boosted Mewtwo. Chansey is usually better off just paralyzing the foe than fishing for freeze. Thunder Wave allows Chansey to spread paralysis across the opposing team, with Pokemon such as Tauros, Starmie, and Alakazam being completely crippled if they become paralyzed, and paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo becoming being far more vulnerable to physical attackers such as Snorlax and Rhydon.</p> <p>Chansey is one of the best status spreaders and Mewtwo switch-ins in the tier, so Pokemon that want Mewtwo and other Special attackers paralyzed, such as Cloyster, Tauros, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Sandslash, make great partners to Chansey. Exeggutor and Zapdos make good switch-ins to Mew, which may otherwise cause Chansey issues. Exeggutor can also switch into Rhydon, which threatens Seismic Toss Chansey immensely. Pokemon that get forced out by strong Psychic-types, such as Tauros, Rhydon, and Cloyster, also make good teammates to Chansey, as Chansey can switch into special attackers for them.</p>"

        "Light Screen": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Light Screen lets Chansey be a proper wall to Special attackers, taking only 26.4% maximum from Mewtwo's +4 Psychic and only 27.8% maximum from Slowbro's +6 Surf, allowing Chansey to stall them out of attacking PP. However, Chansey can be overwhelmed by Special drops and critical hits from Mewtwo or potentially get stalled out of Soft-Boiled PP, as it does not have enough PP to stall both Mewtwo and Slowbro. Seismic Toss is Chansey's best option for solid damage across the entire tier and to force recovery turns for Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Alakazam, and Starmie, which can be taken advantage of by the likes of Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon. Ice Beam allows Chansey to hit Ground-types for super effective damage, notably 2HKOing Rhydon, which otherwise is only 5HKOed by Seismic Toss and can set up a Substitute freely. Ice Beam also lets Chansey fish for freeze against unparalyzed foes. Thunder Wave allows Chansey to hamstring fast threats such as Tauros, Starmie, and Alakazam, and paralysis makes the omnipotent Mew and Mewtwo much more vulnerable to strong physical attackers such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon.</p> <p>Light Screen Chansey makes a great partner to Pokemon that appreciate status on fast foes such as Tauros, Rhydon, Cloyster, and Snorlax. These Pokemon are usually threatened by strong Psychic-types, which Chansey can switch into. Light Screen Chansey is much more of a dedicated stall set than Sing Chansey, so Pokemon with high longevity, such as Reflect Snorlax, Cloyster, Exeggutor, and even Aerodactyl, can make good partners to it.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Chansey is a staple in the RBY metagame, present on nearly 100% of competitive teams. The reason for its extreme popularity mostly lies in its gargantuan special bulk neutralizing Psychic-types, an otherwise incredibly difficult task without using Psychic-types of your own, as well as its ability to completely wall other special attackers like Lapras. It does not perform as well against physical attackers, however; strong hits from the likes of Snorlax and Rhydon can threaten an easy 2HKO, so Chansey must be wary of these threats whenever entering the field, although it does possess tools to ease these matchups despite its generally innocuous offensive presence. Nonetheless, Chansey is somewhat of a requirement in any RBY team due to the risks you would take against Psychic-types without it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While it is generally recommended to stick to the above combinations, Chansey is free to mix and match its options, with the only mandatory move being Soft-Boiled. Sets such as Counter + Sing or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss, Reflect + Ice Beam + Thunderbolt, and Seismic Toss + Ice Beam + Thunder Wave can all perform admirably on the right team, so if you want to rebalance certain matchups for your team, feel free to explore different, less conventional ways to combine Chansey's best moves.</p> <p>Defense Curl is an option over Reflect in the typical Reflect set. Boosting Chansey's Defense past +2 usually makes little difference, but its 64 PP allow you to win PP wars against opposing Reflect Chansey and Snorlax handily as well as significantly increase Chansey's odds in a PP stall against Alakazam and Starmie, which is a useful advantage in its own right; however, Reflect's one-turn setup is significantly better when Chansey switches in on Snorlax, so it's generally preferred.</p> <p>Toxic is another curveball that synergizes well with partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, or Victreebel, as the damage quickly stacks up on targets that would otherwise be able to endure their hits, such as opposing Chansey; also, a Chansey carrying Toxic should beat any Chansey that isn't carrying Ice Beam in the long run due to the damage from the poison.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's Body Slam 3HKOes Chansey, forcing it to keep using Soft-Boiled in most situations; as Body Slam's 24 PP outlasts Soft-Boiled's 16, Chansey cannot afford to outstall the attacks, especially when you also factor in the odds of critical hits as well as the potential Hyper Beam from Snorlax. Even when Chansey is carrying Reflect, a Snorlax with Rest is often not even forced to switch out, as it has really good odds of breaking through eventually between critical hits and PP count. The best option for Chansey is to force Snorlax to use Rest and then switch out to something that can threaten it while it's sleeping. While this is not an awful short-term scenario for the Chansey player, as the Snorlax will need some free turns to wake up, Snorlax can easily find those turns whenever Chansey hits the field again, putting it in yet another situation where it is bound to lose if it doesn't switch out. If the Snorlax carries Ice Beam, it can also attempt to freeze Chansey, and in the worst case for Snorlax, it can trade with Chansey by using Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: Chansey has no way to significantly damage Alakazam, and while it won't be doing much damage back, it can win the PP war thanks to Recover's massive 32 PP unless it gets fully paralyzed several times in a row. Alakazam can also simply fire off Psychic until Chansey's Special drops low enough that it's forced to switch out, but Psychic's limited 16 PP means this can generally only happen two or three times per game. Starmie functions very similarly, as long as the Chansey doesn't have Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Sleepers</strong>: Chansey will be healing up a lot throughout the game. If you can send a sleep move user such as Exeggutor out on a predicted Soft-Boiled, Chansey will have to respect the threat of Sleep Powder and switch out.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Depending on the sets, Chansey can be an excellent Chansey counter. Ice Beam threatens to freeze any unparalyzed Chansey, while a paralyzed Reflect Chansey is going to PP stall most other Chansey with ease. Sing Chansey can also surprise the opponent's Chansey and land a sleep on it, and even if it misses, Sing will remain threatening and have to be respected with a switch.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Lures</strong>: Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Gengar can usually manage to get Chansey on the field to sponge one of their powerful special attacks and catch it with an Explosion to take it out. This is especially viable for teams running a Pokemon such as Lapras or Psychic-less Starmie, which are otherwise completely walled by Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While Rhydon has to respect the Ice Beam threat, its Earthquake achieves a guaranteed 2HKO, so it can sometimes accept taking the Ice Beam damage in exchange for a KO on Chansey. It's even better against Chansey sets that don't run Ice Beam, as it can create Substitutes with enough HP to tank two Seismic Tosses and use Earthquake freely. Both of these situations only really favor Rhydon if the Chansey is paralyzed, however, so make sure to set up its status properly before attempting to win with Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: If Chansey is not running Thunderbolt, Slowbro can freely get Amnesia boosts on it, periodically heal any damage with Rest, and eventually KO via the STAB move of choice as soon as Chansey gets fully paralyzed. Chansey should generally switch out of Slowbro whenever possible, as it can get very threatening very quickly otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: If Jolteon carries Rest, it is able to repeatedly shrug off Chansey's attempts at damage until Double Kick critical hits and paralysis manages to take Chansey down. This leaves Jolteon very vulnerable during its Rest turns, so you should be careful when attempting this.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: If all else fails, Tauros can come in on a paralyzed Chansey and take it out with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, but Tauros really hates being paralyzed, so you should only use this option as a last resort.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "BoltBeam": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>BoltBeam coverage allows Chansey to put pressure on a large part of the metagame. Thunderbolt threatens Water-type Pokemon such as Starmie and Lapras, while Ice Beam threatens to freeze opposing Chansey and deals heavy damage to other common threats such as Rhydon, Exeggutor, and Zapdos. Soft-Boiled is necessary to remain healthy throughout the game, and Thunder Wave is Chansey's main weapon to cripple threats like Tauros and hinder anything else that tries to beat Chansey one-on-one.</p> <p>BoltBeam Chansey will always have to be careful maneuvering around Snorlax, as it doesn't have the tools to face Snorlax one-on-one; this is especially true for Snorlax that carry Rest. BoltBeam Chansey often wants to get paralyzed so it can avoid freezes and sleep, but this makes the Snorlax matchup even worse, and since it's such a threatening Pokemon to begin with, you may want to be careful with accepting Thunder Wave on your Chansey. Another tough matchup is Alakazam, which can easily sponge all of Chansey's attacks and retaliate with repeated Psychic that will eventually cause multiple Special drops and force Chansey off the field; even if Alakazam runs out of Psychic PP, it can often win an all-out PP stall. However, BoltBeam Chansey has a much happier time against the other common Psychic users due to super effective coverage on both Starmie and Exeggutor. Ice Beam also allows Chansey to win against non-Ice Beam Chansey thanks to the freeze chance, so long as the opposing Chansey isn't paralyzed — when it is, this matchup turns around, as Ice Beam's relatively low 16 PP will usually cause BoltBeam Chansey to lose the PP war.</p>"
        },
        "Sing": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Sing is one of the premier Chansey sets. Although the high risk of missing may appear dangerous, Chansey is unlikely to take much punishment in return from any special attacker, so it is a common and successful strategy to simply switch Sing Chansey on a Pokemon like Starmie very early on and put it to sleep immediately. As Soft-Boiled is mandatory, using Sing leaves two moveslots open, usually to be filled with one attacking move and one utility move. The most common attacking move is Ice Beam, as the freeze threat is quite potent against most special attackers, which cannot harm Chansey all that much. However, running Ice Beam as your only damaging move leaves Chansey entirely toothless against Ice-types such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Lapras, so you may want to opt for Seismic Toss instead. As for the utility move, Thunder Wave is handy to cripple various threats, most notably physical attackers that pose an urgent threat to Chansey but really dislike being paralyzed, such as Tauros. Counter, on the other hand, is a specific tool to take care of Snorlax. Due to Chansey's gigantic HP stat, it will OHKO Snorlax after taking a single Body Slam, which is Snorlax's go-to STAB move and main way to damage Chansey. Once Counter is revealed, Snorlax can use moves that Counter can't reply to, such as Earthquake and Ice Beam, and then switch out to a more appropriate check; this means that it is of vital importance for Chansey to land its Counter the first time it uses it, as getting any mileage out of it in the rest of the game is going to be quite unlikely.</p> <p>Sing Chansey's dream scenario is to switch in on a Turn 1 Thunder Wave, allowing it to neutralize incoming sleep moves for the rest of the game, and immediately firing off Sing to achieve what is essentially a full Pokemon advantage due to RBY's notorious sleep mechanics. This threat means Sing Chansey is a strong antimeta pick, as it is commonplace for leads such as Starmie and Alakazam to want to use Thunder Wave in the first turn of the game. However, this strategy is very well known, especially at higher levels of play, so expecting opponents to use Thunder Wave on the first turn may result in heartbreak. Should these types of mindgames not appeal to you, it is also possible to hide Chansey's Sing until later in the game, attempting to bluff a different set and catch a more valuable target than you otherwise would have; however, this is largely reliant on hitting your very first Sing, which is only a 55% chance, as the surprise factor will be blown afterwards.</p> <p>It should be mentioned that Sing Chansey can also function as a lead; although its matchup against faster sleepers such as Gengar, Jynx, and Exeggutor is abysmal, it is able to comfortably land a Sing when facing common leads such as Alakazam and Starmie.</p>"
        },
        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Reflect halves the damage received from physical attacks, patching up Chansey's biggest weakness. Soft-Boiled is a necessity to allow Chansey to check threats and stay healthy throughout the game. Thunder Wave is necessary to punish any Tauros that may attempt to ruin your fun by negating Reflect with a critical hit; it's also generally strong utility and one of the most threatening tools in Chansey's arsenal. Seismic Toss is the preferred move to deal damage, as it hits for a consistent 100 HP, but Ice Beam, while resisted by many Pokemon, still threatens a deadly freeze on everything other than Ice-types. If you choose to rely on Ice Beam as your only attacking move, you will have to be careful not to paralyze Pokemon such as Starmie, as Chansey loses all offensive pressure against it without the possibility to freeze it.</p> <p>Reflect Chansey is one of the best early- and mid-game pivots, while also retaining good enough one-on-one matchups to remain a threat in the later stages of the game. This set's biggest selling point is the ability to switch into Snorlax's Body Slam without having to fear paralysis, allowing it to always set up Reflect, heal off all the damage with Soft-Boiled, and then safely chip away at the opposition via Seismic Toss. An important decision is going to present itself often when playing Reflect Chansey: letting it take a Thunder Wave will make it immune to freezes, allowing it to take on Ice Beam Chansey and win the PP war as well as making it a reliable answer to Exeggutor since it won't have to fear Sleep Powder anymore; however, this will make Chansey much less effective at switching in on Snorlax, and other threats such as Rhydon will also have a much better time against it. Managing the status of your Reflect Chansey is extremely important, and making the right decisions can often swing the tides of the game in your favor. It should be mentioned that a paralyzed Reflect Chansey will also have much more trouble facing Psychic-types due to the 30% chance of dropping its Special via Psychic; it is relatively easy for one of them to accumulate two or more drops and force it to switch out, thus removing Reflect and significantly weakening its effectiveness against physical threats for the rest of the game, unless it is given the free turns to set it up again.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is often labelled as a \"second Tauros\", and while Tauros is usually a better Normal-type attacker, Kangaskhan is not unusable and this label belies how differently it can act in practice. Kangaskhan is much more expendable during a game, fulfilling tasks that are normally too risky for the king of RBY OU. When compared with Tauros, Kangaskhan has some unique moves that make it more effective for this role as well, although they can be difficult to fit onto a set. For instance, Counter helps it oppose Normal-type attackers, and Mega Kick 2HKOes Chansey. Furthermore, Kangaskhan has formidable defensive bulk, which makes it more effective at switching into Body Slam, which cannot paralyze it.</p> <p>However, Kangakhan's hefty Normal-type competition does make it redundant on most teams. It has awful Special, completely failing to take strong neutral hits from Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Zapdos. Consequently, it's very challenging to switch Kangaskhan in against a lot of the tier, as one wrong move can mean significant damage; it often requires a double switch. Worse still, its Speed is just below what would be desirable to sweep, which makes it very reliant on extensive paralysis support to face these strong, fast special attackers. Overall, while Kangaskhan is not a replacement for Tauros by any stretch of the imagination, it retains a small niche when used alongside it, forming a strong wallbreaking core.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kangaskhan's fourth moveslot is the most flexible, and it has a movepool to make use of it. Substitute is an interesting option to relieve prediction because Kangaskhan's HP gives it 103 HP Substitutes, just like Rhydon. This makes Kangaskhan a difficult adversary for Chansey, forcing it to use Seismic Toss twice to break its Substitute. However, Kangaskhan is vulnerable to paralysis throughout these interactions due to Substitute not blocking status in RBY, so it should only be attempted if Chansey is already paralyzed as well. Mega Kick is a valid option for 2HKOing Chansey, Starmie, and Tauros, but it can be difficult to fit into a set, and a miss often leads to Kangaskhan's demise. Rock Slide is another tempting option, allowing Kangaskhan to 2HKO Articuno and Jynx as well as 3HKO Zapdos 47.1% of the time, but it is very matchup-reliant. Thunderbolt is another valid option strictly for beating Cloyster, with two hits putting it in KO range for Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Thunder can 2HKO it after Body Slam.</p> <p>Kangaskhan is capable of using Counter to check Snorlax and Tauros, making them liable to KO themselves if they use Body Slam. Counter also lets Kangaskhan switch in on Hyper Beam, take it very well, and KO the user while it recharges. However, Kangaskhan's exploitable Special makes it deceptively difficult to find situations where Counter can be used. For instance, Kangaskhan is one of the few Pokemon where it's optimal for Tauros to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam before using Hyper Beam. Kangaskhan even takes relatively high damage from Ice Beam Snorlax. With the two most relevant targets for Kangaskhan's Counter being fully capable of scouting for it, it requires patience to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attacks</strong>: The main reason Kangaskhan doesn't see much high-level usage is because of how awful its Special is. Many Pokemon in RBY OU, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and more, will 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, few of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Body Slam, as getting paralyzed or critically hit could let Kangaskhan subsequently blast them away with Hyper Beam. Bulkier special attackers like Slowbro and Lapras don't mind Hyper Beam much, though, and can often muscle past Kangaskhan with their STAB moves. Zapdos deserves a special mention for being immune to Earthquake and threatening a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: While Kangaskhan loves facing paralyzed Pokemon, this also means it wants to avoid paralysis itself. Ergo, Kangaskhan will often find itself being forced out by paralysis inducers like Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Chansey, at least if it can't KO them first. If Kangaskhan is paralyzed, it becomes significantly more vulnerable to 2HKOs from special attackers like Exeggutor and Lapras. Ideally, Kangaskhan should only get paralyzed if it's a do-or-die situation.</p> <p><strong>Tauros Checks</strong>: Due to the dominance of Tauros in RBY OU, the tier is already well-equipped for dealing with Kangaskhan. Cloyster has amazing physical bulk, which makes it difficult for Kangaskhan to break past. Even Thunder is only a 3HKO, while Cloyster has an 84.7% chance to 2HKO in return with Blizzard and can recover the damage with Rest. However, Cloyster dislikes switching into Body Slam due to the potential paralysis making it difficult for it to utilize Clamp later on. To Kangaskhan's credit, it's capable of breaking past Cloyster with Thunderbolt or Thunder, although this isn't reliable. Slowbro possesses the physical bulk to trade blows with Kangaskhan, effortlessly paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and get Amnesia boosts on it. However, a Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan will KO it from 44.2% on a maximum damage roll, so it can be a high-variance matchup. Reflect Snorlax is another thorn in Kangaskhan's side, shrugging off anything thrown at it and forcing Kangaskhan out. Kangaskhan can try to use Counter on Body Slam, but this is somewhat predictable. Exeggutor can stomach most attacks from Kangaskhan and 2HKO with Psychic in return. Finally, Starmie is faster than Kangaskhan, can paralyze it, and 2HKOes with its special move of choice.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is Kangaskhan's main STAB move, spreading paralysis and ensuring that nothing can switch in for free. A STAB Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan should never be underestimated, KOing most Pokemon from around 65%, including Chansey and Jolteon. Plus, it can KO Alakazam if it's taken minimal chip damage. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar and Jolteon, but it also helps with scouting for Counter users like Chansey and Snorlax. Surf prevents Rhydon from walling Kangaskhan, 2HKOing it. It should be noted that Kangaskhan takes middling damage from Rhydon's Body Slam and can't be paralyzed by it, making it a very valuable point of entry.</p> <p>Despite Kangaskhan's \"second Tauros\" title, it should not be forgotten that it is both a mid-game utility attacker—think Snorlax—and a capable revenge killer, particularly against paralyzed teams. Once Kangaskhan has safely entered the field, it's challenging to switch into due to its coverage and the threat of paralysis from Body Slam, so scouting with the latter should be its main aim. Kangaskhan is very capable of scouting for Counter users thanks to its coverage, so it's good to be patient and settle for Earthquake against Pokemon that carry it, such as Chansey. Remember that Kangaskhan is extremely specially frail, so it should ideally only fight special attackers if they are paralyzed. Even then, it will rely heavily on being eased in through double switches, sleeping Pokemon, and Explosions.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>With the addition of Swords Dance into its movepool, Seaking manages to function as a competent setup sweeper. With STAB Surf as an added bonus, it also blasts through common Hyper Beam switch-ins, such as Rhydon. Agility distinguishes Seaking from its competing Swords Dance users, as, even when paralyzed, it still poses a threat to sweep if the opposing team has been damaged. Once set up, Seaking can be a difficult Pokemon to stop, KOing frailer Pokemon such as Persian and Jolteon from over 75% HP with Hyper Beam. Seaking is decently sturdy as well, surviving two hits from Starmie's Thunderbolt and Alakazam's Thunder Punch a significant majority of the time, giving it more opportunities to set up than Kingler.</p> <p>However, Seaking has to use both Swords Dance and Agility to pose any threat to the opposition. With only Surf and a single physical attack in its attacking moveset due to this—most likely Hyper Beam or the middling Double-Edge—Seaking is not surpassingly rewarding either, struggling to break through bulky Pokemon like Reflect Chansey. It's also completely incapable of breaking through the common Gengar and is struck with Thunderbolt in return; the improved coverage of staples like Thunder Punch for Alakazam and Hypno does not help its case either. Seaking is rarely seen in Tradebacks OU by account of its committal nature and unexceptional reward, normally finding itself competing with Kingler, which, while lacking Agility, has far better damage output for the effort put in.</p>",

A +2 Hyper Beam can also KO Pokemon such as Persian, Rapidash, Chansey, Jolteon, and Hypno if around 20% damage has been dealt prior. At +4, Seaking can OHKO Chansey, Hypno, Starmie, and even Tauros a third of the time. Surf covers Rock-types such as Rhydon, as well as dealing around 25% to Gengar, while also serving as an attack without a drawback.</p> <p>Seaking's movepool is barren but does have other options worth exploring; generally, it should always use a Double Dance set, or it's outclassed by Pokemon like Kingler. Blizzard is a plausible alternative to Surf for the freeze chance and 3HKOing Exeggutor and Zapdos, but the damage is otherwise unimpressive and it fails to OHKO Rhydon. Double-Edge, while having less drawback than Hyper Beam, is weak enough to largely diminish Seaking's threat level once set up. Hydro Pump may seem enticing, but it isn't compatible with the event-only Swords Dance, defeating its purpose.</p> <p>Seaking should commit to boosting only when it is possible to sweep. +4 Attack is needed to OHKO most Pokemon in the tier, and +2 Speed is needed to avoid being revenge killed by faster unparalyzed Pokemon. This amount of setup is daunting, but achievable. Seaking's bulk can withstand two hits from almost everything besides Razor Leaf or very strong Thunderbolts. Taking paralysis is also normally inconsequential in the process; thanks to its setup-heavy nature, Seaking is efficient as reapplying foes' Speed drops from paralysis if an opposing team has been riddled with it. Once Gengar, Electric-types, and Razor Leaf users are eliminated or confirmed to be absent, and extra-bulky Pokemon like Snorlax have taken a little damage, a single free turn can be all the opening Seaking needs to complete the three turns of setup needed to sweep. Against slower teams, Swords Dance can be all that's necessary to break through slower, bulkier Pokemon in Hypno, Chansey, and non-Reflect Snorlax variants. To achieve optimal conditions for a sweep, Seaking should be paired with consistent sleepers such as Jynx and Exeggutor, and Reflect Snorlax to check opposing Snorlax. Seaking is overwhelmed by Gengar, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electabuzz, so Jolteon can be a helpful partner to safely switch into their attacks, while Seaking in turn can check Ground-types like Rhydon in a pinch for Jolteon. Rhydon, Chansey, and Alakazam can also check these Pokemon by comfortably switching into Thunderbolt, though, depending on the coverage of those Seaking checks, these partners might struggle to consistently switch in.</p>"

Its access to a wide array of coverage moves means it can hit many important foes, such as Exeggutor and Slowbro, for super effective damage. On top of this, it has access to Recover, giving it extreme longevity. It also has better physical bulk than Alakazam and Chansey, which are its main competition for the role of paralysis spreader with recovery. Starmie has more flexibility in Stadium OU than standard OU, as it doesn't have to commit to the lead slot or a non-lead slot before seeing the enemy team thanks to the addition of team preview, allowing it to reactively choose a role as needed. The nerf to Hyper Beam in Stadium also works in Starmie's favor, as Tauros and Snorlax with Hyper Beam are less common than in standard OU; this makes them worse at pressuring Starmie.</p> <p>However, Starmie is completely unable to meaningfully threaten Chansey outside of paralysis and can't fit all the moves it wants to, as it only has 2 free moveslots after Thunder Wave and Recover. This means it either has to give up crucial coverage for foes such as Exeggutor and Slowbr or be unable to offensively pressure Pokemon that take neutral damage from Blizzard + Thunderbolt, such as Snorlax and Jolteon. Starmie is also ruined by paralysis, as it becomes far less offensively and defensively potent, making its job of spreading paralysis quite difficult to do without incurring paralysis itself.

Starmie can use Surf over Psychic, as it OHKOes Rhydon and Golem and hits neutral targets for slightly more damage than Psychic, notably always 2HKOing Snorlax with two critical hits; it also has far more PP than Psychic. However, Surf does not hit Gengar super effectively and can't drop the foe's Special. Using Surf alongside Ice-type coverage also means Starmie is walled by Lapras and Cloyster.

      "overview": "<p>Despite being an OU staple, Starmie struggles to find an impactful niche in Ubers outside of the lead slot. Both its offensive and defensive presence are outclassed by other Pokemon in the tier. Still, Starmie can be a serviceable lead in specific team compositions that benefit from extra paralysis. Its high Speed enables it to outpace much of the metagame and threaten damage or paralysis. Lead Starmie can inflict high damage on common early-game sleepers like Gengar and Exeggutor while also threatening freeze or paralysis on any switch-ins. Its best role is disrupting the opposing team’s sleepers by inflicting damage and status and then taking sleep for its teammates. Additionally, its bulk and recovery fares well against physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon, provided its teammates are able to eliminate opposing special walls like Mewtwo and Chansey. Starmie fits well into team compositions that benefit an additional fast Thunder Wave user, such as compositions with Rhydon, Tauros, Dragonite, and Thunderbolt Mewtwo.</p> <p>However, the roles described above can be filled by other, more reliable options. While Starmie combines paralysis threat with special offense, Pokemon such as Chansey and Exeggutor are better at spreading status, and Pokemon like Mewtwo and Slowbro are more potent special threats. Slowbro specifically is an excellent option over Starmie in any role outside of the lead. Both share the same typing, weaknesses, and access to Thunder Wave, but Slowbro's access to Amnesia allows it to better withstand Mewtwo's assault while simultaneously threatening to sweep the opposing team. Alakazam also competes for the same role as a paralysis spreader, though both have merits. Starmie has valuable physical bulk to take on Tauros and Snorlax while also being stronger against Exeggutor and Rhydon. Alakazam, meanwhile, is better into Zapdos and Gengar, can better threaten paralyzed Chansey due to its higher Special, and can use Seismic Toss to deal consistent damage to Amnesia users. Starmie cannot threaten Mewtwo or Mew with anything beyond paralysis, and Starmie will crumble if Mewtwo carries Thunderbolt. Starmie also possesses no reliable tools to force paralysis past Chansey, meaning if it fails to secure a freeze, Chansey can prevent Starmie from making any progress in the game. Thus, Starmie will often fail to do more than paralyze something and take sleep. While Starmie can serve as a decent special attacker and status spreader, many teams are better supported by Pokemon that are more committed to either role.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt is a tempting choice to replace Blizzard in order to punish Slowbro, which will frequently switch into Starmie without it. However, the loss of Blizzard makes Exeggutor extremely difficult to deal with, and also leaves Starmie toothless against Zapdos and Dragonite. Thunderbolt may also be tempting for potential Starmie mirrors, but Starmie is generally not used enough to make it worth the moveslot. Running Blizzard and Thunderbolt together simply leaves Starmie’s special offense minuscule without the benefit of STAB, and it cannot fight Gengar without Psychic.</p> <p>Surf or Hydro Pump could be considered over Blizzard or Psychic to empower Starmie as a special attacker, enabling slightly better damage ranges on neutral targets and scoring OHKOs on Rock / Ground types. Unfortunately, this will again leave Starmie unable to threaten either Gengar or Exeggutor, making these moves much more trouble than they are worth.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Mewtwo</strong>: Thunderbolt is a common option on Mewtwo, and it can guarantee an OHKO on Starmie after one Amnesia. Since Thunderbolt Mewtwo does not usually mind paralysis, there is little Starmie can do to threaten it, and it has no trouble setting up Amnesia and threating Starmie’s entire team. This is a hard counter, and Starmie must avoid this matchup at all costs.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Starmie struggles to progress through Chansey, and it can threaten status back. Sing variants will happily switch into Starmie and put it to sleep, putting Starmie in a difficult position to either paralyze Chansey or fish for a freeze. Non-Sing Chansey can still consistently switch into Starmie whenever it hits the field, enabling it to paralyze the Starmie and mitigate its threat all game.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>- Slowbro is both one of Starmie’s biggest checks and one of the most common choices instead of Starmie in the teambuilder for any position outside of the lead. Slowbro has the same typing, access to Thunder Wave, and Amnesia, which makes it simultaneously more threatening offensively and defensively. Slowbro will frequently enter the field once Starmie has revealed it lacks Thunderbolt, and it will take minimal damage doing so and set up Amnesia for free. Not only will Starmie not be able to threaten it, but it must switch to something that can force it off the field before it executes a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Jolteon</strong>: Although neither is comfortable switching into Starmie, STAB Thunderbolt from Zapdos and Jolteon is guaranteed to 2HKO Starmie and OHKOes with a critical hit. While Zapdos does take heavy damage from Blizzard, it still has a 19.53% chance to OHKO Starmie. Jolteon, although less commonly seen, is also faster than Starmie and can survive 2 non-critical attacks, making it the better check.</p> <p><strong>Non-STAB Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Although rare in the Ubers metagame, a stray Thunderbolt from Chansey, Lapras, or Dragonite is still a significant threat. One of the most reliable ways to dispatch a Starmie is to paralyze and threaten it with Thunderbolt. Gengar's Thunderbolt is particularly notable, as it can 2HKO Starmie and OHKO on a critical hit. Usually, Starmie's greater Speed keeps Gengar at bay, but if Starmie is paralyzed and Gengar is not, this matchup is turned to Gengar's favor. Gengar players also have the option to risk Starmie's Psychic in exchange for a chance at a Thunderbolt critical hit, but this risk is not statistically favored and is generally not a preferred option in the Ubers metagame.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: While Mew certainly doesn’t want to take paralysis early, in certain endgame states Mew can use Starmie to set up for a sweep. Starmie cannot threaten Mew once it’s paralyzed, so it depends on another teammate removing Mew. If nothing can come in and quickly threaten or remove the paralyzed Mew, Mew can set up Swords Dance and clear Starmie’s team.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Paralysis Lead": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Starmie’s primary role on any team is to act as a fast Thunder Wave user, as the goal of a Starmie team is to spread paralysis through the opponent’s team and open endgame sweepers. Outspeeding much of the metagame, Starmie can immediately paralyze an opponent’s sleep lead and any potential switch-ins. However, the early paralysis can make it more difficult to secure sleep, so lead Starmie should be used on teams that prioritize paralysis over sleep or have a plan to push sleep past a paralyzed Chansey. Recover supports its role as a paralysis spreader and helps it take on physical attackers. Once it paralyzes the foe, Starmie will usually outspeed and be able to heal off damage.</p> <p>Psychic is a guaranteed 2HKO against Gengar and is capable of an OHKO on a critical hit, making this move essential on a lead Starmie set. Gengar is one of the most common leads in the Ubers metagame, and Starmie’s primary role in the lead slot is to force Gengar off the field, giving the Starmie user the option to attack, immediately use Thunder Wave, or double switch to a sleeper and induce sleep to grab momentum. Further, Psychic is Starmie’s best option to muscle past a paralyzed Chansey, as consecutive Special drops can force a switch, allowing a chance to spread paralysis onto one of Chansey's teammates. Combined with Starmie’s significant 22.46% critical hit chance, STAB Psychic can deal significant damage to neutral targets; it will normally 3HKO Tauros and 4HKO Snorlax, and it can 2HKO both with the aid of critical hits and Special drops.</p> <p>Blizzard is Starmie’s best choice for a fourth move when operating as a lead. Blizzard threatens a 3HKO on both Exeggutor and Zapdos, which are common partners to Gengar and are sometimes leads themselves. The damage on Exeggutor is especially significant, as this prevents Exeggutor from getting sleep for free, as it will take massive damage and risk freeze if it tries to fight Starmie. Blizzard also has a 38.5% chance to OHKO Dragonite, bolstered further by critical hit and freeze chances. A sleeping Starmie can attempt to wake on Dragonite using Wrap and threaten significant damage. However, unlucky wake attempts can be punished by the opposing team switching in potent threats for free, so this strategy must be used sparingly. Further, Blizzard can allow Starmie to fish for freeze early-game, potentially scoring a massive advantage in the opening. While Ice Beam could be considered for better freeze fishing due to higher accuracy and PP, the drop in damage is significant, as 3HKOs on Exeggutor and Zapdos are no longer guaranteed. The major drawback to freeze fishing is that it delays or prevents Starmie from spreading paralysis, which is more consistent. Since its role is primarily a paralysis spreader, Blizzard is usually chosen for the damage on the above targets.</p> <p>If Starmie does not take sleep early, Thunder Wave can allow it to switch into common threats and deal paralysis back. Mew, Tauros, and Dragonite, specifically, are slower than Starmie and do not appreciate paralysis, so Starmie can often force them off the field. A healthy Starmie can be a valuable check to Tauros, preventing it from breaking open the team. Starmie must be careful of taking paralysis from Body Slam or Thunder Wave, but it can still usually fire off Thunder Wave and outspeed again, allowing it to use Recover more effectively. However, offense in Ubers is more potent than in OU, and Starmie must be wary of threats that outpace Recover—Thunderbolt from Zapdos, Gengar, and Mewtwo is the most notable danger, but Swords Dance Mew can be equally threatening. Mew has a near-guaranteed 2HKO with +2 Earthquake. Once Explosion users have been cleared, Mew and Mewtwo can set up freely while Starmie cannot threaten them beyond paralysis. Once they have set up, they can easily clear through a paralyzed Starmie and win the game. Thus, Starmie is much less effective late-game, so it is greatly preferred to have it take sleep.</p> <p>It is best to pair Starmie with teammates that can take advantage of the opposing team being paralyzed. As special walls like Chansey will often switch in to stop Starmie's progress, physical attackers can take advantage of the now-paralyzed Chansey and force damage onto the opposing team. Pokemon like Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon are able to 2HKO a paralyzed Chansey, so they are great at removing it to allow teammates to spread status onto further targets. The slow, offensive ground types, such as Rhydon and Sandslash, make natural partners to Starmie. Their Ground typing is appreciated to cover Starmie’s weakness to Thunderbolt, and Starmie’s Blizzard can weaken Exeggutor early and prevent it from walling them. Further, the opponent’s Mewtwo and Chansey often do not carry both Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, meaning one of the two will generally provide chances to gain momentum. Starmie and Rhydon together can be used to target the common Gengar + Zapdos team core; Starmie will generally force Gengar off the field early-game and paralyze the incoming Chansey, allowing Rhydon to cover the Zapdos threat and sweep late-game.</p>"

Additionally, its access to many special attacks such as Blizzard, Psychic, and Thunderbolt turns it into an offensive threat versus anything without instant recovery. Although Starmie naturally outspeeds many common Pokemon, most notably Tauros, oftentimes a paralyzed Starmie functions well in its defensive role due to its ability to block sleep-inducing moves from almost anything, while the ability to paralyze any non-Ground-type Pokemon via Thunder Wave makes it difficult to pressure offensively even then. Among the Recover and Soft-Boiled users in OU, Starmie also possesses a special defensive utility, as it's the only one of them to not be forced out immediately by Snorlax when paralyzed and is able to fight back against it offensively as well when running a STAB move. Those traits make Starmie usable in pretty much any state of the game, turning it into a very flexible Pokemon and easy addition to most RBY OU teams.</p>",

Hydro Pump is an option on a late-game Starmie, as it can 2HKO Tauros and generally do decent damage to anything that does not resist it, especially with a critical hit.</p> <p>Hydro Pump can be used for strong STAB hits, and can be especially powerful when combined with Special drops from Psychic, but running the two moves in combination severely limits Starmie's coverage options and leaves it struggling to hit Pokemon such as Exeggutor or an opposing Starmie.</p> <p>Starmie also has access to Reflect and the rare Light Screen. However, it will struggle to fit those moves onto its moveset most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is the number one counter to Starmie, as Starmie realistically cannot beat it with any of its movesets, especially when Chansey is paralyzed. In return, Chansey beats Starmie by paralyzing it and beating it down with Thunderbolt, which Starmie will almost certainly fail to outstall with Recover due to full paralysis and critical hit chance. Alternatively, a Chansey lacking Thunderbolt can attempt to freeze an unparalyzed Starmie, as it runs little risk of losing by doing that. However, in order for Chansey to reliably beat a paralyzed Starmie, it needs to run Thunderbolt, since Seismic Toss's PP does not surpass Recover's massive 32 PP, meaning Starmie can outstall variants without Thunderbolt. It's also worth noting that an unparalyzed Chansey runs the risk of getting frozen by Starmie's Ice-type attacks, especially if it cannot threaten with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam</strong>: Alakazam has little to fear from Starmie as well. Although it does not possess any super effective move to hit Starmie with, its higher Speed and Special mean Alakazam can trade paralysis against Starmie and proceed to damage it with Seismic Toss or go for Special drops with its own, vastly stronger Psychic. The best Starmie can do is try to freeze an unparalyzed Alakazam or paralyze it and go for Special drops of its own in order to gain the Speed advantage and make Blizzard do more damage. Recover's massive PP leaves Starmie outstalled relatively quickly with that approach, though, since Alakazam can switch out to something like Chansey to relieve the Special drops. Additionally, while Surf can help Starmie in the Alakazam matchup, it usually still is not enough to beat it, since it only 4HKOes. The possibility of critical hits combined with multiple full paralysis turns on Alakazam, however, does give Starmie a fighting chance.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Even though Starmie is relatively bulky for a Pokemon with instant recovery, it still takes a good chunk from Snorlax's Body Slam. Alongside Starmie's relative trouble to deal great damage to Snorlax plus Snorlax frequently running Rest to heal damage and sometimes carrying Hyper Beam, this makes it a solid check to Starmie. If nothing else, Snorlax's Body Slam is another tool to paralyze Starmie, which generally makes it easier to handle. However, Snorlax has to be careful versus Starmie carrying a STAB move, especially Psychic, since one Special drop means it can no longer reliably Rest stall even a paralyzed Starmie. Another tool Snorlax has to dispose of Starmie is Amnesia. Since Amnesia Snorlax frequently only carries Blizzard and Body Slam as attacking moves, it still does not reliably beat Starmie, but outspeeding Starmie thanks to the additional Speed drop caused by using Amnesia when both are paralyzed surely helps break it with Body Slam. However, Amnesia does not protect Snorlax from Starmie's high critical hit chance, meaning Starmie can even break through Amnesia Snorlax with two consecutive Psychic critical hits or a potential freeze from an Ice-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Starmie struggles to stay in against Electric-type STAB moves from Jolteon and Zapdos or trade a Thunder Wave with them, since it cannot attempt to Recover off the damage they inflict piece by piece. Jolteon is definitely the best offensive check to Starmie. It does not like paralysis very much, but since it is one of the rare Pokemon that naturally outspeed Starmie, it can afford to take Starmie on even when paralyzed. Starmie can at best 4HKO Jolteon with Psychic, while Jolteon outspeeds and 2HKOes it. Zapdos does not fare as brilliantly against Starmie as Jolteon does due to being weak to Blizzard and not naturally outspeeding it, but it still does beat Starmie one-on-one, though it greatly appreciates it being paralyzed beforehand. Note that both Zapdos and Jolteon have a high critical hit rate thanks to their high Speed. One critical hit Thunderbolt from them will easily OHKO Starmie.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks</strong>: Razor Leaf from Victreebel does upwards of 73% to Starmie, meaning that Victreebel does not need to hit many Wraps to put a paralyzed Starmie in range of being KOed by Razor Leaf. If Sleep Clause is already active, Starmie absolutely needs to be paralyzed for Victreebel to beat it, though, since Starmie 2HKOes Victreebel with either Psychic or Blizzard. Mega Drain on Exeggutor is another option to pressure paralyzed Starmie trying to block Sleep Powder, since it 3HKOes Starmie and 2HKOes it after a Special drop from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Attacks</strong>: Other non-STAB Electric-type attacks coming from the likes of Gengar, Lapras, and opposing Starmie will put enormous pressure on Starmie, potentially taking it down with a single untimely full paralysis or critical hit.</p>",

        "Special Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Recover and Thunder Wave alongside Starmie's incredible Speed turn Starmie into a very sturdy Pokemon that possesses the ability to paralyze the foe and outspeed it after, even when paralyzed itself, and proceed to recover its health, since most attacks do not deal 50% to it. This makes Starmie tough to break and is why this move combination allows Starmie, despite its high Speed, to take paralysis even early on in the game and avoid being crippled by it as much as most other Pokemon. In fact, a paralyzed Starmie is very good at blocking sleep-inducing moves from common sleepers like Exeggutor and Sing Chansey lacking Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Starmie's traits do not end at its defensive role, however. In its last two moveslots, Starmie is able to run a variety of powerful special attacks, which can be chosen to hit almost every Pokemon in the tier except Chansey super effectively or at least decently hard. In that context it is worth noting that, due to its high Speed, Starmie has a very high chance of 22.46% to score a critical hit, which frequently enables Starmie to successfully knock out opposing Pokemon by shooting for critical hits.</p> <p>Blizzard most notably hits Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Rhydon, as well as Victreebel and Dragonite. It is chosen over Ice Beam due to having more power while only being 10% less accurate. In addition to the coverage Blizzard provides, another reason to use it lies in its chance to score a freeze on opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Alakazam or just about any Pokemon if you're desperate. Moves that typically go alongside Blizzard are Psychic and Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Psychic is Starmie's best option to hit Pokemon like Gengar and the Normal-types, thanks to gaining STAB. This is especially important against Snorlax, as a Starmie without STAB moves struggles quite a bit to really hurt it. Another important feature of Psychic is the chance to score Special drops, which can help force switches and thus spread paralysis on the opposing team. This is especially noteworthy against Chansey, especially those running Reflect, since enough Special drops can force it out even when it has already set up a Reflect, which Starmie will otherwise fail to achieve. It can be useful against Alakazam as well, albeit not as consistently, since Alakazam itself can cause Starmie's Special to drop. It is worth mentioning however, that the Blizzard + Psychic set does have some issues with running out of PP rather quickly against opposing Recover users and will not be able to hurt opposing Starmie and Slowbro.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is used to hit opposing Water-types super effectively, including Lapras, Cloyster, and especially opposing Starmie and Slowbro. Being able to threaten other Starmie, especially when they lack Thunderbolt themselves, and beating Slowbro with a critical hit are the biggest selling points for Thunderbolt. Additionally, Thunderbolt is Starmie's only super effective move against Articuno, which itself doesn't really threaten Starmie much but can be annoying to actually knock out. If Thunderbolt is chosen alongside Blizzard, it should be noted that Starmie will struggle to properly threaten Gengar and Snorlax, as the latter can usually Rest stall Starmie, especially if it is paralyzed.</p> <p>Either move can be run alongside Blizzard whether or not Starmie is used as a lead, though as a lead Starmie usually prefers Psychic, as it's usually more useful for early-game purposes; Thunderbolt's coverage alongside Blizzard is appreciated if Starmie is kept for late-game, when opposing Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax are taken care of otherwise.</p> <p>Psychic and Thunderbolt can be used on the same set if you want to retain the power versus Starmie and Slowbro and the ability to threaten Snorlax, which can be very dangerous for teams that have to rely on either of those Pokemon to fend off Starmie if Chansey is taken out already. Not being able to do much versus Exeggutor, especially when facing it as a lead, plus being unable to hit Rhydon super effectively can be annoying, but neither of them really likes going up against Starmie, since Psychic still does a lot to Rhydon, and Exeggutor usually cannot do much back if it lacks Mega Drain and Starmie cannot be put to sleep anymore. Exeggutor will be paralyzed and receive permanent chip damage in the process of trying to beat Starmie. However, Starmie cannot beat it without giving it multiple chances to fish for Special drops, which might force Starmie out and give Exeggutor the opportunity to put a switch-in to sleep. Additionally, Exeggutor has plenty of time to go for its Explosion, meaning Starmie will likely only trade with Exeggutor. Furthermore, not running Blizzard means you miss out on hitting especially the rare Dragonite super effectively, which then does not have to fear being outright KOed by Starmie and may be able to try its luck with setting up Agility on a weakened team.</p> <p>Another STAB option Starmie has is Surf. However, Water-type moves do not provide much in terms of coverage in the RBY OU metagame, since Fire-types are basically nonexistent and will be unable to beat Starmie anyway, and the ones you might meet such as Moltres are already hit super effectively by Blizzard. Nevertheless, Surf is used to OHKO Rhydon, hitting it by surprise, and it's Starmie's best option against Alakazam and Jynx, giving it a chance to take them down with some luck. It is worth noting that even with Surf, Starmie does not necessarily beat Alakazam; it will force it to Recover more frequently, though, and thus create turns to gain momentum by switching in a physical attacker on a Recover. Like Psychic, Surf also serves as a stronger STAB move against neutral targets such as Snorlax. The lack of a Special drop chance, however, makes it the inferior choice for that purpose. Usually the move to go alongside Surf is Thunderbolt, since Blizzard and Psychic are somewhat redundant with Surf. Since Surf and Thunderbolt both have 24 PP, this Starmie set is best suited for drawn-out games that include PP stalling. It must be noted that with Thunderbolt and Surf, Starmie is walled by Victreebel and Exeggutor, the latter of which has a good chance to force Starmie out due to its high Special and Psychic dropping Starmie's Special, giving Exeggutor opportunities to use Sleep Powder on a switch-in. Additionally, Starmie can no longer hurt opposing Zapdos and Dragonite. Pairing Surf with Blizzard is possible to avoid these issues, but the inability to hit opposing Water-types makes this less desirable.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Jynx's role remains virtually unchanged from its job in standard OU play—using Lovely Kiss on Psychic-type leads, absorbing or blocking sleep for its own team, and fishing for a freeze if given the chance. What changes, however, is the relevance of that role. Jynx remains just as capable at inducing sleep, but teams that utilize sleep-inducing physical attackers make it much harder for Jynx to absorb sleep. Jynx's horrendous physical bulk lets Pokemon like Persian and Snorlax pulverize it after Jynx is paralyzed, preventing it from being an effective sleep blocker. Jynx also struggles to remove paralysis via Rest against these teams, as using it allows every physical attacker free entry. This essentially means that against teams that employ physical sleep inducers, Jynx's only use will be to induce sleep early and to potentially annoy Pokemon like Chansey, without ever getting the chance to block or absorb sleep for its teammates. Jynx also performs horribly against sleep leads that outspeed it, such as Gengar and Persian. Hypno also competes with Jynx as a Psychic-type sleep inducer, which trades out accuracy on its sleep move for access to Thunder Wave and Amnesia, which makes it much deadlier later in the game. Fortunately, though, Jynx still manages to perform well against teams that still use traditional methods of inducing sleep, like Sing Chansey or non-Double-Edge Exeggutor. This relegates Jynx to being a more matchup-specific Pokemon rather than one of the most consistent leads in the tier.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Jynx is still the fastest Pokemon with access to a 75% accurate sleep move, despite the new sleep inducers added in Tradebacks. This makes Lovely Kiss completely mandatory for Jynx to have any relevant niche. STAB Blizzard is incredibly powerful, usually forcing Alakazam to use Recover if it switches in on it and dealing significant damage to most other Pokemon, notably OHKOing Rhydon and 2HKOing Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Persian. Ice Beam can be used for a marginal increase in odds to freeze the opponent, but the decrease in power is very noticeable in nearly every matchup. Psychic is a good tool to hit Pokemon that would normally resist Jynx's Ice-type STAB, like Cloyster and Vaporeon, as well as to fish for Special drops on paralyzed Pokemon. The last slot is the most flexible, but Jynx generally wants to run Rest. While the potential risk for using it is increased, its still just as good against teams with traditional sleep inducers.</p> <p>Unlike most other Pokemon, Jynx gains almost nothing of significance in its Tradebacks moveset. The only somewhat relevant new option is Petal Dance, which can allow Jynx to 3HKO Starmie 60% of the time. With a critical hit, Jynx can potentially eviscerate a Starmie expecting a free switch in. However, Jynx will be locked into Petal Dance for 3-4 turns, meaning that if Petal Dance doesn't get the KO, Jynx becomes a sitting duck. Beyond that, Jynx can use Counter to improve its matchup against Normal-types and to deal a chunk of damage to special walls as Normal-types switch out. It can also use Seismic Toss to deal consistent damage to Slowbro and Starmie, both of which resist its STAB options.</p>"

The nerfs to sleep and addition of Team Preview make its main niche—the one-two punch of a speedy Lovely Kiss followed by a Blizzard freeze—far rarer and much less impactful. Regardless, being the most reliable sleeper available is still a decent niche to have, and Jynx can pave the way for teammates like Rhydon or Zapdos to bring down the hammer thanks to the status requiring a turn for the foe to wake up. Additionally, Jynx's other traits remain relevant: Ice-type STAB gives it a fantastic matchup against Pokemon like Exeggutor, and its Psychic resistance lets it handle opposing Psychic-types like Alakazam and non-Surf Starmie. However, its drawbacks remain; Jynx's limited offensive coverage and barely good enough Special leave it easily stopped by Pokemon like Chansey and Starmie, and it also struggles to break past Substitute, a somewhat frequent move in Stadium OU. Furthermore, its pitiful physical bulk means Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros can effortlessly exploit it to score big damage on Jynx's team as it's forced out. Double-Edge being much more common on Exeggutor also hurts it greatly, as it has a much harder time using Rest in front of it.</p>",

Given Stadium OU's penchant for long games, Ice Beam is a valid choice to fish for a freeze; if every hit connects, Ice Beam should score one around 82% of the time. However, Blizzard is superior in terms of raw damage, notably 2HKOing Exeggutor, which is especially effective if Jynx switches in on a predicted Rest. Psychic complements this for excellent neutral coverage, being Jynx's strongest attack against some uncommon foes like Cloyster, Lapras, and Gengar. Rest lets Jynx stay healthy throughout a game while triggering Stadium Sleep Clause and blocking paralysis attempts from Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Exeggutor. However, Rest must be used carefully, as using it too predictably will leave Jynx helpless against a foe that switches in as it uses Rest. Tauros is particularly problematic, as Jynx being a constant free Tauros switch is very dangerous even in Stadium's less offensive metagame.</p> <p>Outside of Rest, Jynx can use other options, but dropping Rest makes Jynx far more vulnerable to status. Given that Psychic generally hits uncommon foes, Seismic Toss is an alternative that puts more pressure on Psychic-types, making it harder for them to PP stall Jynx's attacking moves. Seismic Toss is useful for dealing with Jynx's Substitute issues, breaking Alakazam and Starmie's Substitute easily and also helping against Slowbro; however, because these are uncommon sights, the move is niche. 7 Defense DVs alongside Counter guarantees a KO if Jynx lands Counter against Tauros's Body Slam. Alternatively, Mimic can be used to take a potentially more useful move, such as Recover or Thunder Wave from Alakazam and Starmie. Substitute is usable for scouting switches and protecting Jynx from paralysis, but the offensive cost is quite steep. Jynx should generally be used on teams that appreciate its sleep-inducing prowess for high payoffs, such as those with Zapdos, Rhydon, or Slowbro.</p>"

What holds Jynx back are its low HP and Defense stats, which prevent it from survivng longer on the field without its trademark move, Lovely Kiss. Jynx's attacks are quite good in certain matchups, but other Psychic-type Pokemon have better traits, like Alakazam's great Speed, Starmie's outstanding bulk, and Exeggutor's combination of Leech Seed and Toxic, leaving Jynx as a niche but viable Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jynx’s last moveslot has a few options available to it. One option is Ice Beam, which has more PP and therefore more opportunities to freeze than Blizzard alone. Another option is Seismic Toss, which allows Jynx to pressure threats it wouldn't otherwise be able to deal with, like Slowbro and Mewtwo after Amnesia. Body Slam can spread paralysis, but its inconsistency and Jynx's very low Attack stat make this mostly not worth it. Mimic is a gimmick that can give Jynx useful moves such as Recover, Thunder Wave, and Amnesia but is very matchup- and luck-based. Jynx has the option of dropping Psychic to run two other moves and potentially catch something off guard at the cost of not being able to pressure Chansey. An interesting option is running 7 DVs in Defense to OHKO Tauros with Counter after getting hit by Body Slam. However, this significantly hurts Jynx, as it already somewhat lacks longevity, and it can also be useless if the opponent is careful and uses Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro sets up on Jynx, takes minimal damage from Psychic and Blizzard, can heal Seismic Toss damage, and doesn’t care about Body Slam paralysis. However, it does fear a freeze. A Slowbro that is asleep from Rest can be chipped by Seismic Toss into the range of a teammate’s Explosion. Keep in mind that Slowbro with only Ice Beam must be at +6 to even 3HKO Jynx.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: While less common, Starmie always walls Jynx's coverage and heals the little damage it may take. It can also effectively absorb Jynx's Lovely Kiss and use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, too many Psychic Special drops can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is a very common lead, is faster than Jynx, and carries Hypnosis. It can also use Explosion to OHKO Jynx, which can put Jynx's team at a big disadvantage if there is no backup sleeper. However, Hypnosis's chance to miss means Gengar should fear possibly being put to sleep itself or taking big damage from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Pokemon that can use Thunder Wave such as Mew, Jolteon, and Alakazam can severely cripple Jynx, as it has very little use without the option of a fast Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes minimal damage from any of Jynx's moves and forces it out with Seismic Toss. It can also put Jynx to sleep with Sing or paralyze it with Thunder Wave. However, Jynx can freeze Chansey or drop its Special, forcing it out. Also, if Ice Beam is Chansey's only attacking move, Jynx can wall it and use Rest to heal damage.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo sets up on Jynx as long as it does not get frozen. Mewtwo can also use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, Jynx has a chance to beat Mewtwo if it gets fully paralyzed for a few turns before it sets up, or if Jynx lands some critical hits.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Lead Tauros versus lead Jynx is a gamble for both sides. Tauros is able to fish for Body Slam paralysis, a critical hit Body Slam that OHKOes 66% of the time, or Stomp flinches. On the other hand, if Tauros fails to get any of those, Jynx can try to put it to sleep, use Counter, or use Blizzard for heavy damage. However, Tauros can also use Earthquake on the first turn to avoid Counter and guarantee a KO with Hyper Beam on the next turn. Also, Tauros is able to come in later in the game and finish off a weakened Jynx with little issues.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Lovely Kiss is Jynx's best move, allowing it to likely disable one of the opponent's Pokemon for most of the game. Blizzard and Psychic hit the majority of the tier for solid damage. Psychic also has a chance to lower the foe's Special, helping Jynx deal a little bit more damage with subsequent attacks. Counter allows Jynx to fire off massive damage after taking a Normal-type move, usually Body Slam from Tauros, Snorlax, or Mew. However, it is very prediction reliant, as all three run Earthquake and can use it to avoid damage from Counter. Rest helps Jynx stall Chansey, eliminating an obstacle for your own Mewtwo, as well as increasing Jynx's overall longevity. One must be aware that many physical attackers and setup sweepers can take advantage of a sleeping Jynx, so Rest must be used carefully.</p> <p>Jynx sometimes gets an early-game freeze before it can try to freeze Mewtwo, so Light Screen Chansey is a premier teammate, as it provides one of the tier’s best checks to Mewtwo. Light Screen allows Chansey to avoid the 3HKO from Mewtwo's Psychic and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Another good option is Flash Chansey to PP stall opposing Mewtwo if Jynx is running Rest. Jynx is great both with and against Explosion. Teammates with Explosion such as Gengar, Mew, and Exeggutor, or Snorlax with Self-Destruct, appreciate Jynx chipping the opposing team into their range. Also, Jynx should be used to take Explosion or as sleep fodder after it has inflicted its status effects to prevent Mewtwo and Slowbro from using it as setup fodder.</p> <p>Teammates that can check Mew are very helpful, as Mew can come in against Jynx and set up for free with Swords Dance, especially if Jynx has used Rest. The best check to Mew is Mew itself; Transform Mew is a very solid counter to opposing Swords Dance Mew, as it can easily turn the opponent's strategy against them. Gengar is another good teammate that completely counters mono-Body Slam Mew. Rhydon and Golem are other good checks to mono-Normal Mew and can support Jynx by absorbing other Normal- and Electric-type attacks, both of which can be problematic for it. Rhydon is stronger and bulkier than Golem and can help pressure the opposing team more immediately. However, both Jynx and Rhydon are somewhat slow for the Ubers metagame, and Amnesia users can use them as setup fodder. Golem, while weaker and frailer than Rhydon, is slightly faster and has Explosion as a one-time nuke, which can take out almost anything on the opposing team and applies immense constant pressure.</p>"

Despite its key resistances to Ice- and Psychic-type attacks, Jynx can become easily trampled over by physical attacks, namely from Normal-types such as Tauros and Snorlax, due to its pitiful HP and Defense stats. While its key resistances to Blizzard and Psychic may say otherwise, the main way Jynx provides defensive utility is being the switch-in for predicted sleep-inducing moves. Additionally, nearly all teams run at least two solid checks to Jynx between Chansey and either Starmie or Alakazam, sometimes both. Due to the omnipresence of these checks, their access to Thunder Wave and reliable recovery, and Jynx's susceptibility to paralysis and being worn down over time, Jynx's role is undermined. Jynx can use Rest to restore its health and alleviate its paralysis, burning off sleep turns against Pokemon that can't do much back to it like a paralyzed BoltBeam Starmie. However, doing so opens itself up to a slew of physical attackers such as Tauros and Snorlax that can freely switch into it while it's asleep.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As previously stated, Jynx's most useless move is Rest, and therefore if one wishes to use one of these other options, it should usually replace Rest. Ice Beam can be used over Blizzard to give Jynx more PP on its Ice-type STAB option. Running Ice Beam can also come in handy in long, drawn-out games to secure a freeze against one of the opponent's Pokemon, although the drop in power is noticeable. A healthy Jynx can use Counter to improve its matchup against Tauros and Snorlax; it is situational, and Jynx has to be at a sizable amount of health for this strategy to be pulled off, although it can also be used after taking damage from a previous turn and the foe switching out. Mimic can be utilized to potentially copy an important utility or coverage move such as Thunder Wave, Soft-Boiled, Recover, or Thunderbolt from one of Jynx's switch-ins such as Chansey or Starmie. However, forfeiting Rest for only a chance to copy a useful coverage move is somewhat risky and still leaves Jynx prone to being paralyzed. Body Slam can be utilized to fish for paralysis against incoming switch-ins like Alakazam, although it is not guaranteed, cannot paralyze Chansey and Snorlax, and is fired off of Jynx's exceedingly below-average Attack stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Gengar cannot switch in safely on Jynx whatsoever, it can put Jynx out of commission from the very beginning of the game with Hypnosis. Gengar is also faster than Jynx and can threaten to use Explosion at any time.</p> <p><strong>Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam</strong>: Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam can sponge all of Jynx's attacks, paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and restore their health with Soft-Boiled or Recover, acting as some of the most consistent Jynx checks after one of their teammates has been put to sleep. Although they are all susceptible to being frozen with Blizzard, they can whittle Jynx down and force it to use Rest early, limiting the number of chances Jynx has of freezing something.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Tauros and Snorlax can take advantage of Jynx's low HP and Defense and love switching into it after it uses Rest, forcing in a teammate to take the incoming Body Slam. Tauros can also pick up the KO against Jynx with Hyper Beam with a little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, like Starmie, resists Jynx's dual STAB combination of Ice and Psychic and can use Jynx as a setup opportunity to boost with Amnesia and Rest off all the damage it has taken. Lapras is another great example of an offensive check to Jynx despite its lack of reliable recovery due to its 4x resistance to Blizzard and access to Body Slam, although one of its teammates will need to have already been put to sleep. The Jynx user may also decide to trade damage off against Lapras with the end goal of revenge killing it later with another teammate such as Tauros or Alakazam. Getting too much damage off on these Pokemon after Jynx puts something to sleep will often lead to the defensive core of a team crumbling.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Jynx's primary goal is to use Lovely Kiss and incapacitate the foe's lead such as Starmie or Alakazam. Blizzard is Jynx's strongest STAB option against certain Psychic-types such as Alakazam and nails Pokemon such as Zapdos and Exeggutor. It can also be used to fish for a potential freeze while scouting which of the opponent's Pokemon has a sleep-inducing move. Psychic rounds out Jynx's coverage, receives STAB, and hits Pokemon such as Gengar and Lapras. It also has the potential to lower a foe's Special stat, which can come in handy to more convincingly win matchups versus special attackers, notably an opposing paralyzed Chansey. Rest provides Jynx with a way of restoring its health and alleviating paralysis. While Jynx doesn't have too many opportunities to use Rest due to its lackluster physical bulk, it can use Rest and burn sleep turns on more passive foes such as Chansey, Alakazam, and Exeggutor lacking Double-Edge. Burning off sleep turns is not always easy, however, as generally speaking most teams pack anywhere from two to three solid checks to Jynx, leaving it liable to exploitation. Jynx is primarily used as a lead due to its above-average Speed tier and access to a fairly accurate sleep-inducing move. However, Jynx can also be used mid-game due to its high Special and fantastic offensive dual STAB combination of Blizzard and Psychic. Note that removing statused Pokemon such as paralyzed Alakazam and Chansey from play allows for Jynx to more freely use Lovely Kiss. The ideal way to utilize Jynx is to put one check to sleep with Lovely Kiss, potentially freeze one of Jynx's remaining checks, and then switch it into potential sleep inducers.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir is the sole viable Bug-type in RBY OU thanks to an amazing Attack stat that can be further boosted by Swords Dance, allowing it to let loose nuclear Hyper Beams while trapping with Bind. A +2 Pinsir is nothing to be trifled with, capable of beating Snorlax outright with Submission and possessing a Hyper Beam that can OHKO the physically frailer Pokemon in the tier, including Jolteon, Chansey, Jynx, Alakazam, and Victreebel. Additionally, Pinsir has the strongest non-STAB Slash in the game, hitting nearly as hard as Persian right out of the gate. This makes it one of the few physical attackers that can contest Reflect users like Snorlax and Chansey, the latter of which it can 2HKO. Pinsir's typing gives it surprising defensive utility as well, resisting Earthquake and not being hit super effectively by Thunderbolt, giving it use over other Swords Dance users like Kingler. Pinsir is by no means slow relative to OU either, outpacing Victreebel and Cloyster, and, with paralysis support, it can absolutely mow down even the faster Pokemon in the tier, acting as a surprisingly strong late-game sweeper.</p> <p>However, like all RBY Bug-types, Pinsir suffers from some severe downsides. While powerful, Pinsir cannot hit Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing strictly Normal- and Fighting-type attacks in its offensive movepool. Ergo, Gengar can effortlessly switch in and let out a completely uncontested Hypnosis while Pinsir is forced to switch out or pivot out with Bind. Pinsir also suffers from a bit of four moveslot syndrome, demanding Swords Dance and Hyper Beam while having to pick between Slash, Submission, and Bind for its last two slots, all of which can significantly affect its matchups. Worse still, Pinsir is very reliant on its Speed to sweep, as being outsped exposes its noticeably mediocre special bulk, leading to it getting forced out by paralysis inducers such as Alakazam, Starmie, and full HP Chansey. These flaws make Pinsir a rare sight in RBY OU, but a serviceable pick nonetheless.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While a highly contested slot, Pinsir's fourth moveslot is the most flexible. If a team absolutely needs another Pokemon to hit Gengar, Seismic Toss is a suitable option, allowing Pinsir to punish its attempts to switch in. After two strikes, Gengar often becomes much more inclined to Explode, making it a bit more predictable. However, fitting Seismic Toss always brings severe opportunity cost, causing Pinsir to lose out on Submission's fantastic damage against Normal-types or Bind's utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Pinsir can't even touch Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing no alternatives to hit it. Worse still, Gengar's Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 3HKO, dealing up to 41.4% per hit, or it can fire off a completely uncontested Hypnosis. However, Bind can immobilize Gengar while allowing Pinsir to bring in a teammate such as Alakazam for free, which does add a degree of risk.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis rains on Pinsir's parade, exposing its severely lacking special bulk and making it near-incapable of running over the opposing team. There is counterplay if Pinsir's foe is paralyzed as well, though, as Pinsir can attempt to use Swords Dance to reapply the Speed drop and continue whaling on them. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Lapras become much more threatening when Pinsir is paralyzed, utilizing their powerful special attacks to 2HKO it. As a result, Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will often force Pinsir out by the threat of paralysis alone unless it's in a situation where paralysis doesn't matter. This also makes Body Slam paralysis from Pokemon like Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon particularly annoying, as Pinsir can't often stomach more than two hits from any given Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pinsir's special bulk of 65/55 is awful; even Jolteon's Thunderbolt and Starmie's Surf have a high chance to 2HKO it. As a result, Pinsir is very frequently forced out by special attackers unless it can KO them first, such as if they're paralyzed or chipped. However, Pinsir does often have the chance to attack them once, which can situationally be all it needs in endgame scenarios.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes</strong>: Pokemon like Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro put large amounts of pressure on Pinsir—especially if it's paralyzed—while being able to stomach its hefty physical blows. These Pokemon can also strike back with equally devastating attacks; in Rhydon's case, Rock Slide can deal upwards of 80% in a single hit, which can be a KO if Pinsir even tries to respond with Submission.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: If Pinsir can't KO Chansey outright, Counter Chansey will OHKO Pinsir if it uses any of its offensive attacks bar Bind. This can also apply to more niche Counter users, such as Snorlax, Alakazam, and Kangaskhan. However, if Pinsir has Bind, it has a solid way to counter-play the strategy, immobilizing the Counter users and chipping them into Hyper Beam range.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance and Hyper Beam are Pinsir's bread and butter, allowing it to swiftly end games if its team can successfully chip and paralyze the opposing team. It should be noted that Swords Dance reapplies the paralysis Speed drop to paralyzed foes, so if Pinsir itself is paralyzed, it isn't game over just yet. This effect also applies to paralyzed Pokemon attempting to switch in, making doing so extremely risky.</p> <p>Pinsir's last two moveslots largely depend on what its user wants. For the third moveslot, Slash gives Pinsir immediate power and provides a better matchup against Reflect users, while Body Slam lets Pinsir spread its own paralysis, making it more self-sufficient. For the fourth slot, Submission, while unreliable and giving Pinsir significant blowback for its use, is an amazing way to dispatch Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax at +2, dealing well over 50% to each of them. In fact, after two boosts, Pinsir can outright OHKO non-Reflect Snorlax. Alternatively, Bind can occupy either the third or fourth moveslot, letting Pinsir pivot into its teammates to gain a better position while also dealing serious chip damage. This works especially well against paralyzed teams, forcing them to switch around to PP stall it while often taking around 7% each time if Pinsir has picked up even a single boost, which rapidly adds up over the course of the move.</p> <p>While this is all well and good on paper, using Pinsir in practice is fairly difficult. It's best to keep it to endgame scenarios, when the opposing team has likely been thoroughly paralyzed. However, it's perfectly fair to switch it in on a Chansey's Soft-Boiled turn or a Snorlax's Rest or Earthquake, both options that Pinsir doesn't really care about. Similarly, Recover turns from paralyzed Alakazam and Starmie are good opportunities for Pinsir to sneak in and force damage on the opposing team; if either of these Pokemon experience full paralysis when attempting to respond, they could absolutely be KOed the following turn. Fellow partial trapping pivots and Explosions are other good switch-in chances. Picking up a boost with Pinsir is also quite difficult, though Pinsir is not against taking a hit to set up if it means winning the game there and then. Punishing a Snorlax Rest with Pinsir is among the best ways to get a boost with impunity, often forcing Snorlax out lest it is KOed from there. Pinsir works best on teams that have multiple paralysis inducers, one of which will likely be the ubiquitous Chansey. Jolteon synergizes very well with Pinsir, appreciating Pinsir's Ground resistance and ability to 2HKO Rhydon with +2 Submission.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Tauros is the most powerful physical sweeper in the Stadium OU metagame. It has solid offensive stats backed up by a vast attacking movepool that contains Body Slam, Stomp, and coverage options in Blizzard, Earthquake, and Thunderbolt. In addition, its superb base 110 Speed lets it outpace most Pokemon in the metagame and grants it a noteworthy critical hit rate of 18%. However, Tauros has to avoid status at all costs to remain a threat. The reduced viability of Hyper Beam compared to standard RBY does it no favors either, as it now has more difficulty breaking through staples like Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Chansey, as well as knocking out status inducers before they can cripple it. Tauros can run Substitute to avoid status, but this drops Tauros's HP to the point of putting it in 2HKO range of many common threats. Despite these shortcomings, Tauros is a great pick for most Stadium OU teams.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<p>Body Slam is Tauros's main attacking option; its paralysis chance on most Pokemon makes switching into it difficult. Blizzard 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and has a 32.1% chance to 3HKO Exeggutor. It also carries a small freeze chance, which gives Tauros the option to fish for an effective KO in a desperate situation. Substitute protects Tauros from status and critical hits and is a useful tool for sweeping. Double-Edge can be used instead; it is guaranteed to 2HKO Alakazam, and its greater power than Body Slam gives Tauros more room to finish off foes before they can threaten it. It comes at the cost of recoil damage, although this can be avoided if Tauros scores a KO or destroys a Substitute. There are a few moves that can fit in the last moveslot. Stomp's flinch chance allows Tauros to put threats in range of its other moves without taking damage. It is especially effective against paralyzed foes, as they will only have a 52.5% chance to move, and it is also safer if Tauros is behind a Substitute, as it won't risk paralysis or damage. Earthquake usually KOes Jolteon after a Body Slam and 2HKOes the rare Gengar, which walls Tauros otherwise. Furthermore, it hits Rhydon and the uncommon Golem and Kabutops for super effective damage while dealing decent damage to Chansey, should it switch in predicting Blizzard. Tauros can use it to avoid Counter from Chansey, though Counter sees little use. Alternatively, Thunderbolt 3HKOes Starmie, Slowbro, and the uncommon Cloyster and Kabutops. Cloyster is notably able to wall Tauros if it lacks Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Tauros wants to avoid damage and status whenever it can to best use its offensive abilities and avoid being disadvantaged in a potential mirror matchup. Thus, using Tauros means having it active whenever possible while keeping it as healthy as possible. A good way to get mileage out of it while keeping it safe is to switch it in on sleeping or frozen Pokemon, a predicted Rest, or a predicted switch. Another, slightly riskier option is to switch into a predicted Recover or Soft-Boiled from a paralyzed Pokemon; if they get paralyzed when trying to recover, Tauros can finish them off. Substitute should generally be saved for the late-game, as using it once puts Tauros in 2HKO range of common threats like Rhydon, Exeggutor, Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Starmie. Besides the listed options, very few other moves are worth considering on Tauros. Hyper Beam is still incredibly powerful and will allow it to reliably break through Chansey and Exeggutor, but it's much less appealing because it always forces a recharge turn, even if it misses. However, it can work if Tauros is behind a Substitute to protect it from paralysis on the following turn. Fire Blast has a high burn chance, which can be useful against enemy Tauros and Snorlax, but it's a weaker choice in Stadium, as the latter can wipe off the Attack loss with Rest.</p>"

Just like in OU, Tauros's powerful Normal-type STAB moves and complementary coverage coupled with its high critical hit rate make it difficult to switch into and almost impossible to fully stonewall. While its bulk is passable, it lacks resistances and instant recovery, so it offers very little defensive value to a team. Also, the bulkier metagame of Ubers blunts Tauros's edge; the mandatory Mew and Mewtwo can withstand its hits and either retaliate hard or cripple it with paralysis, forcing it out. Tauros is therefore less valued, though this frees it to be used much more aggressively, as it isn't critical to preserve Tauros for late-game.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Double-Edge's increased Base Power over Body Slam greatly improves Tauros's odds to 3HKO Mew and Mewtwo. Two Double-Edges followed by a Hyper Beam will usually KO Mew and Mewtwo. A single critical hit Double-Edge may also put Mewtwo and Mew in range of Hyper Beam. It is guaranteed to OHKO Jynx on a critical hit, unlike Body Slam, and can secure KOs outside of Body Slam's range without Hyper Beam's recharge turn. While Double-Edge strengthens Tauros's matchups against Mewtwo and Mew, it does come at the cost of coverage, and the recoil from Double-Edge can compromise Tauros's bulk. Moreover, its utility compared to Leer's Defense drop and paralysis reapplication is limited.</p> <p>Thunderbolt 3HKOes Cloyster and inflicts more damage on Slowbro than Body Slam does before it boosts its Special with Amnesia; it also hits other Electric-weak Pokemon slightly harder, but these benefits are minimal, and Cloyster is less common in Ubers than OU. Fire Blast can be used to burn physical attackers, such as Snorlax and Tauros, but it has limited utility beyond that. Furthermore, Swords Dance users like Mew are unimpeded by the Attack drop after boosting, and special attackers like Mewtwo welcome a burn shielding them from all other status effects. Substitute can be used to fish for full paralysis against threats like Mewtwo. However, this move is rarely worth the loss of a fourth attack, as it does not protect from status moves. Overall, Tauros has little room to cover specific matchups, and its moveslots are generally better geared toward beating omnipresent threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Tauros relies heavily on its Speed and Attack stats to function. Once paralyzed or burned, Tauros has much greater difficulty applying pressure and loses much of its value as a revenge killer. Status renders matchups that are otherwise favorable to Tauros, like Chansey and Alakazam, very poor and forces it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro's high physical bulk makes it an excellent switch-in to Tauros, as it is able to survive even a critical hit Hyper Beam and cripple Tauros with paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew can cripple Tauros with Thunder Wave, greatly reduce its damage output with Reflect, set up in front of it with Swords Dance, and even punish Tauros's STAB attacks with Counter. Mew also has instant recovery with Soft-Boiled, outpacing Tauros's damage output unless it has Leer. However, Mew is more often than not forced out due to full paralysis, critical hits, Defense drops, and flinches, and it's generally not worthwhile to let Mew risk paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo can threaten Tauros out with its massively powerful special attacks, making it an effective offensive check. Mewtwo has a chance to OHKO Tauros with a critical hit or +2 Psychic. Mewtwo can sometimes run Thunder Wave, making Tauros much less threatening. However, switching Mewtwo into Tauros's attacks is generally not a good idea, as it risks paralysis, after which Tauros pressures it heavily with physical attacks.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is a fairly common foe both as a lead and in the back. It can withstand Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam and can paralyze Tauros with Thunder Wave, and it does massive damage in return with Thunderbolt. However, Zapdos cannot safely switch into Tauros, as Body Slam paralysis greatly reduces its ability to pressure the opposing team, and a critical hit Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam has a 97.70% chance to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: With Thunder Wave to cripple Tauros with paralysis, enough bulk to survive Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, and Recover to heal off the damage, Starmie makes for one of the best available switch-ins to Tauros. However, with Body Slam's 30% paralysis chance and high critical hit rate, Starmie won't be able to deal with Tauros consistently.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax has enough bulk to switch into Tauros and retaliate with a couple of attacks before getting KOed. Self-Destruct KOes Tauros 15% of the time at full HP, so any attack followed by Self-Destruct will reliably take it down. Counter in tandem with Hyper Beam can also catch Tauros by surprise; landing Counter against Body Slam puts Tauros into Hyper Beam range or outright KOes it on a critical hit. Reflect Snorlax is incredibly frustrating for Tauros, forcing it to rely on critical hits to break through.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor doesn't reliably beat Tauros one-on-one, it can switch into a predicted Hyper Beam or Earthquake and cripple Tauros with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore, then maim it with Psychic or take it down with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Lapras</strong>: These bulky Ice-types can stomach multiple hits from Tauros and threaten it with STAB Blizzard. Cloyster's Blizzard falls short of a 2HKO, but it can take four hits from Body Slam—requiring an exploitable Hyper Beam to finish it off—and can also use Explosion. Lapras can 2HKO Tauros with Blizzard 25% of the time, gamble on Confuse Ray to make Blizzard a guaranteed 2HKO, or even use Sing to put Tauros to sleep, but Tauros can finish off Lapras with four hits from Body Slam a little over half of the time.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: While they fear Tauros's coverage, Rock-types can switch into Normal-type attacks and bait weaker coverage moves for a teammate to switch in more easily. If Tauros forgoes Blizzard, Rhydon and Golem are able to trade blows with it. Aerodactyl is also a potent check to Tauros if it has neither Blizzard or Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar can switch into predicted Normal-type moves freely and either threaten Tauros with sleep or bait Earthquake for a teammate to switch in safely. If Tauros lacks Earthquake, Gengar switches into Tauros with ease.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam and Hyper Beam are Tauros's primary attacks and greatest sources of pressure. Would-be checks like Exeggutor and Snorlax can be overwhelmed by Body Slam critical hits and paralysis chance for non-Normal-types. A critical hit Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam has a 97.70% chance to KO Zapdos, Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam KOes Jynx, and a critical hit Body Slam has a 66.7% chance to OHKO Jynx. Tauros also forces bulky threats like unboosted Mew out for fear of being paralyzed by Body Slam and finished off by Hyper Beam. Earthquake threatens Gengar, which otherwise easily switches into Tauros, with a 2HKO and safely scouts for Counter from the likes of Chansey and Snorlax. Blizzard is Tauros's strongest attack against Rhydon, Golem, and the rare Aerodactyl, 2HKOing them while also inflicting heavy damage against other Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Exeggutor and Zapdos.</p> <p>Leer can be used to soften up boosting Pokemon such as Slowbro and Mew, forcing them out to reset their Defense stat. This is particularly useful when the opponent has only one Pokemon left, allowing other physical attackers, like Snorlax and Rhydon, to threaten them even more. Leer's paralysis reapplication is also very useful against faster, paralyzed boosting targets like Mewtwo and Mew, allowing physical attackers to outspeed them even when paralyzed themselves. Tauros can use Leer to enable paralyzed allies to outspeed a paralyzed Mewtwo or Mew, allowing them to set up, heal themselves, or threaten Explosion. This especially helps Tauros itself, increasing its damage and allowing it to always 3HKO Mew and Mewtwo. Stomp is another alternative to Blizzard, trading coverage to exploit Stomp's 30.1% flinch chance against slower, preferably paralyzed Pokemon. Stomp threatens Jynx and Exeggutor in the lead matchup as well as paralyzed Mew, Mewtwo, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Tauros is often used as a lead, utilizing its strong STAB moves and coverage to threaten common leads, forcing them out proactively and spreading damage and paralysis among the opposing team. For example, common sleepers like Jynx and Gengar are 2HKOed by Body Slam and Earthquake, making a miss or a critical hit from Tauros deadly. If Tauros opts for Stomp instead, Jynx's odds of hitting Lovely Kiss get worse, and Stomp's lower damage prevents Counter from OHKOing Tauros. Zapdos will generally either try to trade hits with Tauros or switch out for fear of Body Slam's paralysis chance and Tauros's high critical hit rate. Faster leads like Alakazam and Jolteon generally dislike facing Tauros due to its high damage output and ability to spread paralysis, putting high pressure on them. Against these leads, Tauros also has the possibility of switching out, which can offer a strong sleep blocker in the form of paralyzed Chansey, and keeping Tauros healthy will help it apply pressure later.</p> <p>Tauros can also be used outside of the lead slot, functioning as a strong late-game cleaner. Paralyzed Mewtwo, Mew, and Chansey are particularly vulnerable against Tauros, which can easily spiral out of control with the combined odds of full paralysis, critical hits, and potential flinches from Stomp. In this role, Tauros generally switches in on a predicted recovery move from a paralyzed target like Mewtwo, Mew, or Slowbro, or it can be used as a revenge killer. Leer's ability to reapply paralysis is particularly valuable in this role, allowing Tauros to consistently force out or significantly weaken paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo. Additionally, it enables slower attackers like paralyzed Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Mew to outspeed foes, which is crucial late-game to enable Self-Destruct and Explosion. Leer can also allow paralyzed Mewtwo and Mew to outspeed opposing paralyzed Mewtwo and Mew, providing safer opportunities to recover.</p>"

This makes switching into Tauros a very arduous prospect for most teams, as potential checks like Starmie have to fear a sizable chance of paralysis or a critical hit from Body Slam. Other Pokemon with the theoretical physical bulk, such as Snorlax, Cloyster, and Slowbro, can only shrug off Tauros's hits via Rest, leaving them in an exploitable state. Overall, although some special attackers can trade blows advantageously with Tauros, and it has to be very wary of paralysis, its sheer offensive prowess makes it an automatic inclusion on a vast majority of RBY teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt and Thunder can be used to damage Cloyster, which is one of the sturdiest Tauros switch-ins available. Thunder manages to 2HKO it but has to deal with much lower accuracy, while Thunderbolt misses out on that damage range but is generally far more reliable, and is therefore the preferred option a vast majority of the time.</p> <p>Given the generally low usage of Gengar and Counter Chansey, it is reasonable to cut Earthquake in favor of Fire Blast; while this move does not hit any targets for extra damage, it does carry a 30.1% burn chance that can give Tauros an upper hand in a one-on-one matchup with opposing Tauros.</p> <p>Stomp has a 30.1% flinch chance, and while definitely unreliable, it can be used to bring opposing Pokemon into KO range with no damage traded back with some luck. This is an especially appealing option if the enemy Pokemon is already paralyzed, which further increases the chances of it not managing to attack.</p> <p>Double-Edge's 100 Base Power can be used to safely snipe out KOs that Body Slam cannot reach while not having to rely on Hyper Beam; the recoil is a generally unpleasant side effect, but it can be used to your advantage, as whenever a Pokemon faints from recoil the turn ends immediately. This mechanic can occasionally be used to damage an opponent and prevent them from healing back up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Tauros's below average bulk is difficult to exploit because it is usually faster and strong enough to KO the foe before they can strike back. Paralysis and sleep are both very common in the RBY metagame, and they can shut down this element of Tauros's gameplay, making it much easier to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor lacks recovery, and therefore cannot repeatedly switch in on Tauros, simply having Exeggutor in the back will often dissuade Tauros players from clicking Hyper Beam, as Exeggutor could switch in, tank the Hyper Beam, and land a Sleep Powder or a Stun Spore on Tauros during the recharge turn, effectively putting it out of commission for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is the only Pokemon with access to Recover that can survive a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, which makes it an obvious candidate for a reliable switch-in on Tauros throughout the game; however, Body Slam can ruin its day with decent frequency due to the chance of paralysis. Regardless, Starmie outspeeds Tauros and can even threaten it with Thunder Wave, which makes a healthy Starmie one of the best Tauros answers available.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Lapras</strong>: These Pokemon possess great bulk and access to a powerful Blizzard that is generally enough to scare Tauros away. Lapras's Blizzard is stronger and has a chance to 2HKO, while Cloyster takes Body Slams better and more commonly runs Rest to heal the damage back up. As a side note, Articuno also possesses 2HKO potential via Blizzard, but it's significantly frailer and generally less viable than both Cloyster and Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro is part of the small list of Pokemon that are guaranteed to survive a critical hit Hyper Beam from full HP, making it an appealing option to switch in on a predicted Hyper Beam in order to guarantee landing a Thunder Wave on the recharge turn. It does not mind a Body Slam either, but it can be hard for it to use Rest and wake up unpunished.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Tauros's much slower and bulkier counterpart is a good asset when trying to answer an opposing Tauros, as its natural bulk will often at least guarantee that some damage gets traded back, and if it carries Self-Destruct, it can somewhat reliably trade one-for-one if your opponent chooses to leave Tauros on the field.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Although mauled by Earthquake, Gengar can switch in on Normal-type attacks from Tauros at no cost and threaten it with Hypnosis. Although the exchange is somewhat likely to end very poorly, between Hypnosis's miss chance and Earthquake's critical chance, the Tauros user is generally expected to keep it away from danger if possible, which means Gengar can somewhat reliably be used to prevent Tauros from making any progress as long as it doesn't get hit with an Earthquake on a predicted switch in. Gengar is also the best check to Tauros without Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Alakazam</strong>: Although they definitely do not want to pick a full one-on-one against Tauros or ever switch in on it, Alakazam and Jolteon deserve a mention as they can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Tauros, which is a fairly rare quality.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Tauros's combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam makes it an incredibly difficult threat to switch into, as a majority of Pokemon only need to receive minimal chip damage before being unable to tank a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, and some are KOed by this sequence even from full health. Body Slam's paralysis chance on some of the most common Tauros switch-ins such as Starmie and Exeggutor is yet another addition to Tauros's already threatening arsenal. Blizzard is Tauros's best attack to threaten Rhydon and Golem, the two OU-viable Rock-types that would otherwise be able to switch in on its Body Slam, and force them to face the threat of being 2HKOed (or being OHKOed on a critical hit). Earthquake is the preferred move in the last slot, as it gives Tauros a tool to hit Gengar, which otherwise walls it, as well as a way to play around Counter Chansey, although Tauros still risks taking a Thunder Wave in a direct one-on-one situation. Additionally, it can finish off a weakened Rhydon or Golem with greater accuracy than Blizzard. Earthquake also gives Tauros a safe move to hit both Chansey and Rock-types, which eliminates the need to predict a switch with Body Slam or Blizzard in certain situations.</p> <p>Tauros is such a potent tool to break the opposition down that it is generally preferred to keep it as healthy as possible throughout the game while also trying to get it on the field as often as possible; this is a tricky balance to achieve that often sets apart new players from experienced ones. Great opportunities to switch it in can be found against Pokemon that are asleep, on a predicted switch, or on a recovery move that will leave the opponent's active Pokemon in KO range for Tauros. Quite frequently, Tauros will be able to clean up teams that have appropriately been crippled with status or weakened beforehand thanks to its extremely strong Hyper Beam; this is one of the most common win conditions in RBY, and as such, your game plan should generally account for the possibility of a late-game Tauros sweep. This means you should capitalize on opportunities to set up a Tauros sweep while trying to reduce your opponent's chances to do the same thing. The biggest obstacle in these plans is often the fact that both Tauros are kept as healthy as possible and always able to try a last-resort mirror, even when the rest of the team has fallen apart; this is one of the many reasons for keeping your own Tauros safe.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Gyarados clings to RBY OU relevance thanks to a combination of massively inflated stats, expansive coverage in moves like Thunderbolt and Blizzard, and a unique typing that makes it the only Water-type immune to Ground, letting it switch in on a predicted Earthquake with impunity. That typing lets it synergize with Pokemon like Chansey, Gengar, and Jolteon, which not only appreciate this immunity, but also help patch up its own Thunderbolt weakness. Gyarados's attacking stats are extremely high, allowing it to achieve feats such as 2HKOing Tauros and 3HKOing Snorlax with Hydro Pump, letting it win against them one-on-one. Plus, it's bulky to the point that even a Thunderbolt from Starmie fails to OHKO it without a critical hit. It's not exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, outrunning Pokemon like Cloyster, Dragonite, and Victreebel while threatening them with its coverage. Overall, Gyarados can be seen as a battering ram that blows past paralyzed teams.</p> <p>However, while it may have been a big threat in the early days of the generation, Gyarados fell out of favor due to its typing giving it some horrendous weaknesses. While its Ground immunity looks enticing to switch in on Rhydon, it also takes huge damage from Rock Slide: its bulk isn't as good as it looks. It also gets a quadruple weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Blizzard and Psychic, making it hard for Gyarados to get in against the special attackers of the tier and forcing teams to make up for it. If paralyzed, this gets even worse, as Gyarados's lack of reliable recovery makes it very easy to wear down as is. Even offensively, because of a criminal lack of physical STAB moves, Gyarados struggles to damage specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Gengar. Finally, Gyarados has issues distinguishing itself from Lapras outside of its typing and superior Attack, which has the same coverage and higher overall bulk. As a result of these flaws, Gyarados is a very rare sight in RBY OU, often requiring extensive support from a dedicated team to function properly, but it remains a serviceable pick in the hands of an experienced player.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf can be used if Hydro Pump's consistency is problematic, but this reduces Gyarados's immediate threat level. Worse still, it's not that much better than Blizzard in practice damage-wise, making it largely redundant. Thunder is a serviceable option to 2HKO Starmie and Slowbro, but its criminally low accuracy and lack of benefit outside of this make it mostly suboptimal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar can switch in on Gyarados and KO it with Thunderbolt if it's taken even a modicum of damage. However, it can't repeatedly switch into Hydro Pump, lest it get 3HKOed in the process.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can effortlessly take Gyarados's special coverage; Reflect sets are also depressing to fight against. Additionally, Chansey's access to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave makes it very risky for Gyarados to contest unless its moveset has already been successfully scouted. However, Gyarados can KO Chansey with Hyper Beam from 49.3% onwards if Reflect isn't active—even above 75% with Body Slam + Hyper Beam—which makes a paralyzed Chansey very possible to beat.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Lapras</strong>: While it gets Thunderbolt, Gyarados struggles to deal with Starmie and Lapras due to their Hydro Pump resistance and ability to simply outdamage Gyarados with their own coverage. Starmie is of particular note because of its access to Thunder Wave, which firmly shuts down Gyarados. However, it has to risk Body Slam paralysis when switching in, which can potentially incapacitate it for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type coverage</strong>: Any Pokemon with Thunderbolt is automatically a Gyarados check. Jolteon and Zapdos cleanly OHKO Gyarados with their STAB Thunderbolts. If Tauros and Persian run Thunderbolt, they can 2HKO Gyarados off the bat, the latter of which is arguably more threatening because of its high critical hit rate. However, all of these Pokemon would rather avoid taking direct damage, as they have mediocre bulk; they win one-on-one, but they are not reliable defensive answers by any means.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: If not running Blizzard, Exeggutor resists both of Gyarados's special coverage options and threatens with massive damage or sleep in return. Even with Blizzard in the equation, a Special drop from Psychic can instantly ruin any chance of Gyarados actually winning. However, Exeggutor doesn't want to take a Blizzard, as it often wants to save its bulk for more pressing matchups, particularly Rhydon and Snorlax.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Gyarados's Hydro Pump is no joke, letting it potentially 3HKO Snorlax and 2HKO Tauros, winning against them one-on-one. However, it should be remembered that Hydro Pump's inconsistency can and will lead to wasted turns. Additionally, Thunderbolt Tauros can tear Gyarados apart anyway, so it must be scouted for first. Thunderbolt gives Gyarados a fighting chance against all Water-types, most importantly Starmie, Cloyster, Slowbro, and Lapras. However, Blizzard can be used to 3HKO Exeggutor instead, which Gyarados otherwise struggles against. Body Slam allows Gyarados to scout for switch-ins while threatening with paralysis, making use of its great Attack stat in the process; this also prevents Starmie, Alakazam, and Jolteon from switching in safely, and it allows Gyarados to pressure Chansey with significant damage on a critical hit. To top it off, Hyper Beam blows past non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam, KOing them from 58% and 63.5% onwards, respectively, which Body Slam can set it up for.</p> <p>Gyarados functions as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker that forces the opponent into making predictable decisions. It can be brought in early on a predicted Rest from Snorlax—a common sight in the early-game in RBY—then threaten it with Hydro Pump from there to force damage onto the opposing team. Gyarados's high Special and Water resistance make it one of the best Clamp absorbers in the game too, so it's very capable of switching in on a predicted one from Cloyster. Outside of this though, due to its typing, Gyarados's switch-in opportunities are quite limited, mostly being reserved to generic methods like pivoting with partial trapping, gambling on full paralysis, and Explosion. However, Gyarados's typing makes it well-equipped for double switching against Earthquake, allowing it to ease in Pokemon like Jolteon and Chansey if the situation calls for it.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Lapras's STAB Blizzard and tremendous bulk give it positive matchups against many of the physical attackers of Ubers, namely Swords Dance Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax. Its Speed is just enough to outrun Chansey and Exeggutor, which it can potentially threaten with Sing, disrupting common sleep strategies. Because Lapras is so hard to wall as a result of BoltBeam coverage, absorbing its Sing with paralyzed Pokemon is also very difficult; it can blow past Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie easily when they're paralyzed. Furthermore, Lapras is generally not concerned with taking paralysis itself, and when it's paralyzed it can potentially switch in on sleep moves from Pokemon like Exeggutor and threaten massive damage thereafter. Lapras's quadruple resistance to Ice and immunity to freeze lets it switch into certain Ice-type moves, notably against Chansey, softening a somewhat common Mewtwo removal strategy. Lapras's ability to trade hits favorably against almost the entirety of Kanto's finest allows it to clear the way for even stronger allies, positioning them for a quick beatdown.</p> <p>However, Lapras's lack of reliability comes back to bite it very frequently. It's easily worn down over the course of a game, as its Speed often forces it to take a hit before it can make a move, and it crucially lacks reliable recovery. Being weak to Thunderbolt and neutral to Psychic doesn't help it either, and an untimely critical hit can significantly limit the impact it will have over the course of a game. Additionally, Lapras faces stiff Water-type competition in Cloyster and Starmie. Both are faster than Lapras, and Cloyster has access to Clamp and Explosion, while Starmie has Recover and Thunder Wave. While they can't replicate its power or Sing access, they usually bring more consistent utility to a team, which often pushes Lapras out during teambuilding.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lapras has a massive movepool that's worth delving into; however, Blizzard and Thunderbolt are generally undroppable. Hyper Beam can be used on Lapras's Confuse Ray set over Body Slam, providing a better matchup against Jynx by allowing a KO with two Thunderbolts followed by Hyper Beam. Lapras has access to Psychic, which can trigger a Special drop overflow against a +5 Mewtwo with maximum investment, but it has little use outside of this. Ice Beam can be used for the additional PP and accuracy, but the drop in power noticeable—for example, Ice Beam fails to reliably 2HKO Exeggutor or come close to 2HKOing Tauros. Since Lapras wants to win a single notable KO through sheer bulk and power, it tends to be counterproductive.</p> <p>Lapras can attempt to use a Rest set that allows it to try to repeatedly win trades, but this cedes momentum to Mewtwo and Thunderbolt users like Zapdos. This can be used alongside Reflect to make Lapras a pain for Swords Dance Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax to deal with, but this is performed more effectively by Pokemon like Zapdos and Aerodactyl. This set also ends up making it extremely weak against Mewtwo, which pressures it effortlessly with nuclear special attacks and the ability to set up while Lapras is asleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While Lapras deals massive damage to Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode, notably 2HKOing the former due to its Blizzard weakness, Lapras will quickly get forced out if it can't KO them outright. They deal massive damage with STAB Thunderbolt, with Jolteon and Zapdos 2HKOing it and Electrode doing so after mild chip damage. Additionally, their high critical hit rates can turn a 2HKO into an OHKO. Lapras should only attempt to win if they are paralyzed and the team lacks adequate switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo frequently uses Thunderbolt, and while this can't 2HKO Lapras unboosted, Mewtwo will frequently be at +2 or higher. Lapras struggles to damage Mewtwo at all, with an unboosted Mewtwo only taking around a quarter from Blizzard. The maximum damage Lapras can deal to it is 29.8% with Hyper Beam. The best shot Lapras has of winning is via parafusion tactics.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: While Lapras can use Hyper Beam to KO Chansey from a range of 37.9% to 44.6% and has the potential to freeze it or put it to sleep, Chansey has numerous ways to beat Lapras. A paralyzed Chansey is generally not afraid of non-Confuse Ray Lapras, stonewalling it, and Sing variants can fire off uncontested sleep with little Lapras can do. Light Screen variants designed to beat Mewtwo can also nullify Lapras's main strength, its powerful STAB Blizzard. Chansey can also threaten Lapras with a 3HKO from Thunderbolt. Sing Lapras teams should not paralyze Chansey and instead aim to use Lapras's faster Sing to force sleep onto the opposing team. This can be done through switching in on a predicted Seismic Toss or Ice Beam, both of which Lapras shrugs off.</p> <p><strong>Amnesia Snorlax</strong>: The minute Snorlax scores an Amnesia boost, Lapras is incapable of making any meaningful progress against it outside of a lucky freeze or critical hit. Because Snorlax takes a chunk from Blizzard switching in or trying to set up on Lapras, it's not the worst matchup, but it can quickly become unwinnable if Snorlax gets a free chance to set up.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: While uncommon, Rock Slide Mew is a terrible matchup for Lapras, 2HKOing it at +2. Niche Mew variants may also use Thunderbolt to possibly 3HKO it. However, other sets are terrified of sustained assaults from Lapras, especially when paralyzed, as Lapras's Blizzard has a favorable chance to 3HKO Mew. Confuse Ray Lapras variants are very annoying for Swords Dance Mew to deal with, as confusion damage increases due to its Attack boosts. Confusion damage uses the opponent's Reflect in damage calculation, so if Mew has Reflect active, confusion damage will ignore it.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: While rarer in the Ubers landscape, these Pokemon can paralyze and trade blows with Lapras easily if not paralyzed themselves, mostly thanks to their access to Recover. Alakazam can 3HKO Lapras with Psychic if it lands a single Special drop or critical hit, which is likely in a prolonged interaction. Starmie is a particularly poor matchup, possessing Thunderbolt to potentially 3HKO Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar 3HKOes Lapras with Thunderbolt while only being 3HKOed by Blizzard, and it can switch into Lapras's Thunderbolt or Normal-type coverage and still win one-on-one. It also possesses a more accurate sleep-inducing move in Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Leads</strong>: When faced with a faster sleep lead, such as Gengar, Jynx, or Hypno, Sing Lapras tends to be nothing more than a free opportunity for the opponent to try to land sleep or KO Lapras, which is dissuaded from switching out and letting a teammate be put to sleep.</p>",

        "Confuse Ray": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Lapras's STAB Blizzard is no joke, OHKOing Dragonite and almost always OHKOing Rhydon and Golem. It also 2HKOes notable Pokemon like Zapdos, Exeggutor, Persian, and sometimes even Tauros. Tauros is a notable matchup, as few Pokemon are capable of beating it in a head-on fight; not only can Lapras potentially 2HKO it, but it can also survive two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. Thunderbolt ensures Water-types like Cloyster, Starmie, and Slowbro can't wall Lapras, as it 2HKOes Cloyster and 3HKOes the others. Body Slam allows Lapras to be more self-sufficient in spreading paralysis, which also supports parafusion with Confuse Ray. It also gives Lapras an effective move against Jynx, rarely 3HKOing it.</p> <p>Thanks to RBY's brutal confusion mechanics, when supported with paralysis, Lapras can position itself into a positive matchup against most Swords Dance Mew variants, including Reflect sets. A single +2 self-hit puts Mew into Blizzard 2HKO range, and from there, Lapras tends to win the interaction. Another application consists of disrupting paralyzed Mewtwo and Slowbro's Amnesia setup, but outside of this, it's generally quite weak.</p> <p>Confuse Ray Lapras works best as a mid-game threat that disrupts conventional offensive strategies. Progress-makers like Snorlax and Mew tend to have trouble combatting Lapras, as they cannot KO it quickly. However, this only works consistently from full HP: thus, Lapras should be kept for one single, favorable trade before going on its rampage. Lapras benefits from an allied Mew with Thunder Wave, which is one of the most consistent methods of landing paralysis against a myriad of threats, most notably including opposing Mew. Other paralysis support options include Alakazam, Chansey, Jolteon, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Slowbro. Lapras teams tend to struggle against Zapdos, so Jolteon is a suitable partner, though Rhydon is also suitable for a more definitive answer.</p>"

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to the presence of Exeggutor and Tauros in the lead slot, Lapras is capable of being a decent lead itself. It possesses the ability to outspeed and 2HKO Exeggutor with its STAB Blizzard or land Sing before getting put to sleep itself. Against Tauros, it is able to stomach two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam and is virtually never KOed without a critical hit. In return, it can attempt to put Tauros to sleep or fire off Blizzard, which will 2HKO a little over a quarter of the time. Lapras can use its excellent coverage and bulk to use Thunderbolt against Starmie and unboosted Slowbro mid-game. It also completely stonewalls Cloyster, forcing it to use Explosion or switch out in fear of being 2HKOed by said Thunderbolt. Blizzard's 10.2% freeze chance also means Lapras can potentially flip a game on its head by securing a freeze on the likes of Chansey or Mewtwo. Hyper Beam is used in the last slot as a decent finishing tool against Chansey, KOing from about 40%.</p> <p>While Lapras does have many qualities that make it enticing as a lead, it also suffers from some bad matchups. Jynx, Gengar, Jolteon, and Zapdos all are common leads that make the Lapras user start off on a terrible foot. Zapdos and Jolteon are massively threatening with STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes Lapras, and they have a good chance to OHKO outright thanks to their high critical hit rates. While Zapdos is 2HKOed by Blizzard, this is still a very favorable matchup for it. Jynx and Gengar both outspeed and carry their own more accurate sleep-inducing moves, threatening to put Lapras to sleep before it can do anything. Lapras also suffers from its lack of recovery, often being worn down very quickly while taking stray hits from Snorlax and Mew. This makes it quite difficult to facilitate Lapras, especially when common Pokemon like Chansey and Thunderbolt Mewtwo can switch in repeatedly and shrug off the damage with their reliable recovery, only fearing being frozen.</p> <p>Lapras and its traits make it somewhat matchup dependent, as it can be quite devastating against teams that rely on Exeggutor for sleep or Cloyster for their Snorlax check. It is best to maximize your gain early on, putting something to sleep and using Blizzard to aim for a freeze. If these goals are achieved, then sacrificing Lapras to the likes of Sing Chansey is often optimal. One additional benefit is the lack of Thunderbolt on Chansey in Ubers, meaning it is typically safe to stay in and fish for a freeze while Chansey tries to put it to sleep. Additionally, if threats such as Cloyster are revealed, Lapras should be kept healthy to repeatedly switch in and freely use Blizzard into incoming Chansey and Mewtwo.</p>"

Access to STAB Blizzard, as well as Thunderbolt, enables it to hit almost every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage, making it quite difficult to switch into. Its Speed is just enough to get by Chansey as well, allowing it to potentially put it to sleep one-on-one.

It also struggles mightily against Chansey if it can't put it to sleep, which stonewalls it with its incredible bulk. Regardless, Lapras holds a niche in RBY OU, and it sees success on quite a few teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is an alternative STAB option to use in place of Blizzard, but the lack of power is really noticeable and generally not worth the extra accuracy and PP. Rest and Reflect can be used in conjunction to give Lapras much appreciated survivability to answer threats such as Tauros more reliably throughout the game, but the set is easy to pressure via powerful special attacks, particularly Psychic- or Electric-type ones, and the lack of offensive pressure makes it a risky and generally undesirable pick.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Lapras struggles immensely in attempting to break through Chansey. It can easily Soft-Boiled away any damage taken and force Lapras out with the threat of Thunder Wave. Lapras may attempt to put it to sleep with Sing, but the move is inaccurate, somewhat predictable, and completely useless against a paralyzed Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Jolteon</strong>: While Lapras's Blizzard respectively 2HKOes and 3HKOes these Pokemon, team structures that include Lapras generally leave themselves very vulnerable to Electric-type attacks, which Zapdos and Jolteon can easily exploit and punish with powerful Thunderbolts. It may even be preferable to sacrifice Lapras in a one-on-one scenario just to get some chip damage on Zapdos in particular, but the same cannot be said for Jolteon, which should nearly always have the upper hand against Lapras and only fears a potential Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Alakazam</strong>: If they are not paralyzed, these two Pokemon can tank any hit Lapras throws at them and Recover off the damage easily while threatening it with Thunder Wave. All Lapras needs to turn the tides on them is paralysis and some correct predictions.</p> <p><strong>Amnesia Snorlax</strong>: Although it takes a while to get going and has to worry about Sing, Snorlax doesn't take much damage from any of Lapras's attacks after one or two Amnesia boosts and can retaliate with Body Slam. Although it is unlikely Amnesia Snorlax would be used as a switch-in, it dominates one-on-one.</p>",

Thunderbolt allows Lapras to hit Water-types, giving it the ability to muscle through paralyzed Starmie, which would otherwise be a poor matchup. In the third slot, Hyper Beam is Lapras's best bet to finish off Pokemon with a high Special but low Defense, such as Chansey and Alakazam, which are otherwise good answers to Lapras; however, Body Slam may be preferred, as it gives Lapras the ability to somewhat reliably paralyze opposing Starmie. The last slot is usually Sing, a move that provides great utility and scares off Pokemon that would otherwise function as great Lapras answers, with Chansey usually being the main target. Its low accuracy can be unfortunate, as Lapras doesn't have easy ways to shrug off any status or damage that may come its way, so misses can be particularly devastating. If the sleep move is not necessary, you may opt to run Confuse Ray instead, which is Lapras's best shot at powering through paralyzed special walls.</p> <p>When using Lapras, you should first figure out a plan to take care of Chansey, as it can shrug off Blizzard quite easily. Snorlax's Self-Destruct and Exeggutor's Explosion are usually the best ways to achieve this, as your opponent should be able to preserve their Chansey quite easily by simply switching out if you try to defeat it via repeated Ice Beams, PP stalling, or strong physical attacks. However, it is still possible for Lapras to pressure Chansey via Sing, so if you cannot find an opportunity to threaten it via Explosion, you can still rely on Sing to get the job done. Non-paralyzed Starmie and Alakazam are both answers to Lapras as well, threatening to shut it down with Thunder Wave, as they are simply able to use Recover until Lapras is fully paralyzed. If running Body Slam, you should attempt to predict their entrance and hit them with it; should you manage to paralyze them, Lapras will outspeed them and be much harder to stop. Lapras has great potential to create significant advantages between access to Sing and strong matchups against very popular Pokemon such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon, but its checks must be taken care of before it can have any impact on the game.</p>"

It can also attempt to PP stall Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Chansey. However, it can't PP stall effectively because the first two are extremely hard to switch into once Ditto runs out of PP itself, and the latter 3HKOes Ditto with Seismic Toss due to its HP not changing after it's transformed. Ditto takes on the reduced Speed stat of the paralyzed Pokemon it's transforming into even if it isn't paralyzed itself. It also uses its own stats when landing or receiving a critical hit, making it extremely weak to them. Ditto is completely crippled by paralysis, and its niche of forcing Mew out is done far better by other Pokemon, such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Aerodactyl.

      "overview": "<p>Vaporeon finds a niche in Tradebacks OU as it gains Growth, which allows it to boost its already high Special even higher. Once boosted, Surf mows down most foes with little issue, 2HKOing foes such as Tauros and Persian at +1 and 2HKOing even bulky foes such as Snorlax and Zapdos at +2. This, combined with Acid Armor to patch up its lacking base 60 Defense, lets Vaporeon be a great wall not only specially, but also physically; at just +2 Defense, Snorlax's Body Slam becomes a 6HKO. Vaporeon has much higher base Special compared to the other notable Water-type setup sweeper, Slowbro, dealing good damage with Surf even without any Growth boosts. Vaporeon's higher base Special also allows it to tank special hits much easier; Starmie or Chansey only 4HKO with Thunderbolt. This higher base Special also allows Vaporeon to live a critical hit Thunderbolt from Starmie and Chansey with relative ease, taking just 63.4% maximum from a Starmie Thunderbolt critical hit. Vaporeon's large amount of boosting moves also lets it reapply a paralyzed foe's Speed drop up to nine times, while Slowbro can only reapply a paralyzed foe's Speed drop three times.</p> <p>However, Vaporeon is in stark competition with Slowbro for the role of bulky Water-type, and Slowbro has Amnesia, better physical bulk, and Thunder Wave. Vaporeon also shares Slowbro's issues of having to rely on Rest for recovery and takes a lot more turns than Slowbro to set up, making it quite exploitable. However, once Vaporeon gets the ball rolling, it's hard to stop it, with a +5 Surf mowing over even Water-resistant foes. It also can tank one critical hit Thunderbolt from Starmie, Chansey, or Gengar, which Slowbro can't do due to its worse special bulk. Vaporeon is also noticeably faster than Slowbro, outspeeding the likes of Snorlax, Chansey, Exeggutor, and Rhydon, although it's still not fast enough to outspeed most common foes.</p>",

Surf 2HKOes Tauros, Persian, and often Jolteon at +1, though bulkier foes, such as Snorlax, Zapdos, and Hypno require two Growth boosts to 2HKO. Acid Armor lets Vaporeon boost up its measly base 60 Defense, taking paltry damage at +2 from even the strongest physical attacks; it's 6HKOed at +2 by Snorlax's Body Slam, and 7HKOed by Tauros's Body Slam, allowing Vaporeon to shrug off the damage and use Rest with ease, although Tauros's high critical hit rate makes using Rest in front of it risky, as Vaporeon takes 52.9% minimum from a critical hit Body Slam. Acid Armor also has 61PP, which, in combination with Growth, gives Vaporeon a staggering 122PP at its disposal without cutting into Surf and Rest PP, letting it PP stall any foe with ease. Rest lets Vaporeon heal off any stray hits it may take while setting up. Acid Armor can be dropped within reason, as it isn't always needed for Vaporeon to be an effective sweeper. Ice Beam hits Grass and Flying-types for super effective damage, and at +1 Vaporeon is heavily favored to 2HKO Zapdos and Exeggutor. Body Slam allows Vaporeon to paralyze non-Normal-types, but it deals very little damage. Hydro Pump hits much harder than Surf, notably 2HKOing Tauros and Persian unboosted and 2HKOing Snorlax, Alakazam, and Gengar at +1. However, it's often unreliable due to its low accuracy and PP. Substitute can be used to protect Vaporeon from stray critical hits and grant safety when using Rest, as a +1 Vaporeon's Substitute is not broken by Starmie or Chansey's Thunderbolt; Gengar's Thunderbolt is also not favored to break it.</p> <p>Vaporeon should be used on a team with good paralysis support, as it lacks any meaningful way to paralyze Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey, which might otherwise pose issues to it. Vaporeon can also use Growth and Acid Armor to reapply the speed drop from paralysis, letting it outspeed a paralyzed Starmie or Alakazam even if paralyzed itself. Vaporeon needs physical attacking support to help break through special walls like Chansey and Starmie, so it benefits from partners like a Lovely Kiss or all-out attacking Snorlax, as well as Explosion users such as Exeggutor and Golem, as they can neutralize foes that may cause Vaporeon issues with Explosion or status.</p>"

    "tradebacksou": {
      "overview": "<p>Jolteon stands out as one of the few Pokemon able to stop Zapdos's rampage, resisting its STAB moves while having the capacity to beat it one-on-one. Tradebacks gifts it Growth, making it a threatening setup sweeper as well. Otherwise, Jolteon remains largely the same: having the highest Speed just behind Electrode also gives it one of the highest critical hit rates in the game, standing at 25.39%, which distinguishes it as a strong special attacker. Crucially, this means it outruns tier king Tauros while threatening it with Thunder Wave, a trait shared with only Alakazam, Starmie, and the unviable Electrode. Thus, Jolteon will frequently get off uncontested paralysis that forces predictable plays out of the opponent, taking back momentum very quickly. Finally, Jolteon possesses useful physical coverage in Double Kick and Pin Missile, which gives it the potential to specialize in the matchup against Chansey or Exeggutor.</p> <p>However, much like Zapdos, Jolteon is also countered by Rhydon, which means teams featuring Jolteon will often come across similar weaknesses. Being weak to Ground also doesn't bode well for it, as it means Pokemon like Tauros can exploit it if it gets paralyzed, which frequently happens in the matchups Jolteon comes across. Jolteon is frail in general, taking significant damage from Body Slam. Its damage output outside of Thunderbolt is also quite meager and reliant on its critical hit rate, which makes Jolteon quite inconsistent. While Growth is a useful tool that can patch up Jolteon's power issues, it gives Jolteon four-moveslot syndrome, as it's forced to drop Rest and forfeit its ability to be a Zapdos answer as well as making it deathly afraid of Thunder Wave.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest or Growth is usually Jolteon's most expendable move, though this forfeits either a consistent Chansey matchup or sweeping potential. Pin Missile is an inconsistent option to cover Exeggutor, but a lack of STAB, bad accuracy, and high damage variance mean that it can often fail and lead to a paralyzed or KOed Jolteon. If leading Jolteon, Pin Missile is recommended to ensure it doesn't let Exeggutor in early. Agility can be used to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis, but using Rest and switching out usually does the job fine in conventional game states. Body Slam helps Jolteon more consistently contest Exeggutor while spreading paralysis and damage at once, but its damage is pitiful. Thunder is a niche option to use alongside Thunderbolt, and it can OHKO Cloyster and 2HKO Alakazam and Snorlax at +1, but its unreliable accuracy makes it dubious.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor dislikes facing Pin Missile, but without it, Jolteon can't fight Exeggutor at all, as it resists Thunderbolt and Double Kick. In return, Exeggutor can threaten Jolteon with STAB Psychic, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: A Rhydon at full HP is the bane of Jolteon's existence, threatening an OHKO with Earthquake. However, Rhydon can't switch in repeatedly, as Double Kick deals 15.4% minimum and up to 33.8% on a critical hit. Once Rhydon is below half HP it is very uncomfortable having to switch in again.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is a strong check to Jolteon if its running Earthquake, which 2HKOes, and even Body Slam threatens Jolteon with a 3HKO and paralysis. In return, unboosted Jolteon can only 4HKO Snorlax without critical hits. At +1 Jolteon falls just short of 2HKOing Snorlax from full, but it has decent odds of breaking through when factoring critical hits, and it can consistently beat Snorlax if it's under 90% HP.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Jolteon is a fragile, fast Pokemon, which makes it one of the Pokemon most debilitated by paralysis. Rest can remove the status, but Jolteon still needs to switch out to remove the Speed drop. Pokemon like Alakazam, Chansey, Zapdos, and Stun Spore Exeggutor all force non-Rest Jolteon out and majorly inconvenience Rest Jolteon. Starmie and Slowbro can also threaten paralysis if they're healthy and Jolteon hasn't set up Growth yet. However, Growth Jolteon can stay faster than its foes by reapplying the paralysis Speed drop.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Jolteon's bread-and-butter, 2HKOing Pokemon like Cloyster, Starmie, Slowbro, and Lapras. Double Kick primarily targets Chansey, 4HKOing it; Jolteon is favored to break through with critical hits and it will eventually PP stall Soft-Boiled. Double Kick also targets Rhydon, chipping it moderately on entry and essentially preventing it from switching in when below 50% HP due to the risk of a critical hit. Thunder Wave lets Jolteon threaten Pokemon like Tauros and Persian, forcing them out and setting up a sweep for its teammates. Rest lets it consistently counter Zapdos and gives it a long-term advantage against Chansey. Chansey struggles to beat Jolteon even with Seismic Toss because two critical hits or repeated full paralysis are all Jolteon needs to beat it with Double Kick. However, Jolteon tends to let Tauros and other heavy hitters in once it uses Rest, so Jolteon requires careful play and use of double switches to prevent free entry for these threats. An alternative over Rest is Growth, which lets Jolteon assume the role of a setup sweeper. At +1, Jolteon 2HKOes foes like Persian and Tauros and OHKOes Water-types. However, this means losing out on Rest, which forfeits Jolteon's ability to switch into Zapdos and Chansey.</p> <p>If running Rest, Jolteon can remain hidden until either Zapdos reveals itself or a need to break through Chansey emerges. Jolteon finds entry routes on Zapdos and Chansey quite easily, particularly when they are disincentivized to click Thunder Wave, and it otherwise doesn't mind coming in via double switches. Alternatively, Jolteon can be used as a lead, aiming to paralyze whatever is in front of it and force the opponent to make a difficult decision out of the gate. This is especially effective support to physically attacking sleepers like Lovely Kiss Snorlax, as they greatly appreciate paralysis on Psychic-types and Chansey. However, Jolteon dislikes getting paralyzed early itself, and sleep leads can potentially disable it for the rest of the game. Rest Jolteon is best used on teams that are weak to Zapdos, namely those that stack Water-types. Thus, Cloyster, Starmie, and Slowbro all make valid partners. In return, they help stifle Rhydon's attempts to stop Jolteon. If running Growth, Jolteon shouldn't be used as a switch-in to Zapdos and Chansey and should reveal itself when a sweeping route has been established. Given that Chansey, Exeggutor, and Alakazam all pose issues for Jolteon, it enjoys support from sleepers like Lovely Kiss Snorlax, especially if it's running Growth. Exeggutor is also an excellent partner to Jolteon, being one of the most consistent Rhydon switch-ins in the game while also helping to break through the opposing team with Sleep Powder and Explosion.</p>"

It also has access to a powerful STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes the omnipresent Starmie and 3HKOes many other foes, such as Tauros and Kangaskhan.

They also absorb its Explosion extremely well. However, they have to be wary of Super Fang putting them into KO range of a switch-in or revenge killer, such as Tauros and Kangaskhan's Earthquake after two hits with Super Fang.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor resists Thunderbolt and only takes a maximum of 62% from Jolteon's Explosion, and it threatens Sleep Powder and a 3HKO from Razor Leaf.

It also 3HKOes Tauros and Jynx, 3HKOes Clefable 69.4% of the time, and 4HKOes many bulkier foes, such as Snorlax, Gengar, Alakazam, and Zapdos. Thunder Wave allows it to spread paralysis across the opposing team, with its high base Speed allowing it to get the jump on any unboosted foe. Super Fang is Jolteon's best option against many full HP foes, such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Snorlax, and it makes Jolteon's best switch-ins—such as Golem and Exeggutor—think twice about switching in. However, unlike Thunderbolt, it can miss and cannot score critical hits, making it unreliable at times. Explosion is a powerful tool, OHKOing Jynx and Alakazam 66.7% of the time and doing 72.9% minimum to Chansey. It also does serviceable damage to physically bulkier foes, doing 52.6% minimum to Exeggutor and 54.9% minimum to Tauros. Explosion is also useful for finishing off foes weakened by moves such as Super Fang and Thunderbolt, or it can put a foe into revenge kill range. With Jolteon being the fastest viable Pokemon, it has a lot of leeway in its ability to weaken or paralyze a foe before using Explosion.</p> <p>Jolteon can be used as a lead, a mid-game progress maker, or a late-game cleaner. Its most notable position is in the lead slot, as it can take advantage of its high base Speed, Thunder Wave, and Explosion to be able to threaten all relevant leads, paralyzing lead Gengar and cutting the accuracy of its Hypnosis down to a mere 45% while also threatening other common leads, such as Jynx and Alakazam, with paralysis and Explosion. As a mid-game progress maker, Jolteon uses Thunder Wave and good coverage to revenge kill and force trades with important threats such as Gengar, Clefable, Kangaskhan, and Tauros. Jolteon as a cleaner uses its high base Speed and powerful STAB to pick off weakened foes at the end of a game, beating out other common late-game cleaners such as Starmie. In this case, Jolteon should be kept hidden until the end of the game, as it is much more effective at cleaning if the opponent is caught off guard. It should also be kept hidden until Exeggutor and Ground-types have been eliminated, as these foes pose massive issues for it. All of these Jolteon sets work extremely well when paired with other Explosion users, such as Kangaskhan and Exeggutor, as they can either carry on momentum that Jolteon generates early- and mid-game, or they can remove barriers to Jolteon cleaning, such as Kangaskhan, Exeggutor, and Tauros. Lead Jolteon and mid-game progress maker Jolteon's main utility lies in outspeeding and paralyzing at least one foe, and then threatening foes with strong attacks and Explosion.</p>"

It is also good to use against Tauros, as it is no longer a threat once it's paralyzed. Thunderbolt takes care of Water-types like Starmie and Slowbro and can do a lot of damage to Pokemon that don't resist it if Jolteon lands a critical hit. Double Kick scares out Chansey because it is 2HKOed on a critical hit.

Rest allows Jolteon to get HP back and cure itself of paralysis, which is useful against Pokemon like Chansey, Starmie, and Zapdos; however, outside of these Pokemon, Jolteon will find it hard to use Rest, as the move is more useful late-game, and putting Jolteon to sleep allows Tauros to come in safety. Pin Missile gives Jolteon a way to deal with Grass-types such as Exeggutor, as it will deal major damage if it lands a critical hit on them. If Jolteon is being used as a lead, the best move to start the game is Thunder Wave in order to slow down opposing leads like Jynx, Exeggutor, and Alakazam; however, Jolteon must be careful, as this can lead to it being put to sleep with Lovely Kiss or Sleep Powder or paralyzed from Thunder Wave or Stun Spore. Because of its poor bulk, the best way to have Jolteon come in safely is against Pokemon like Chansey, on a predicted switch, or when a Pokemon faints. Jolteon should be saved to use late-game because of its Speed, as it can pick off most weakened Pokemon with Thunderbolt. Jolteon will need Pokemon like Exeggutor and Starmie on the team because it struggles against common Ground-types like Rhydon and Golem. Pokemon that can also help with Snorlax and Tauros like Cloyster and Exeggutor are needed.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Flareon experiences a stark shift from its original role in cartridge RBY, now functioning as a Focus Energy user in Stadium OU. Once boosted, Flareon becomes extremely threatening, with even Fire-resistant Pokemon like Slowbro and Starmie taking over 40% if Fire Blast lands a critical hit thereafter. It's not just a strong special attacker either; Flareon has a solid base 130 Attack stat to support it against Pokemon like Chansey, which it can 2HKO with consecutive critical hit Body Slams. If an opposing team has been paralyzed, Flareon can savagely rip into it with some of the strongest mixed offense available.</p> <p>However, that's about all Flareon can offer: its firepower is no joke, but it's terrible on the defensive, taking serious damage from any attack, having zero defensive utility in its typing, and lacking reliable recovery. Its Speed also leaves a bit to be desired, with it being narrowly outrun by Cloyster, often meaning it requires paralysis support to be effective; this also makes it terrified of receiving paralysis itself. Because it demands paralysis support and offers little defensive utility, Flareon is difficult to build around. Additionally, it has no consistent methods of handling Water-types like Starmie and Slowbro, forcing it out and giving these two powerhouses significant momentum. Furthermore, Flareon is extremely inconsistent, relying on consecutive critical hits to KO Pokemon, which tend to only happen around a third of the time at best even after Focus Energy. Ergo, Flareon is a rare sight in the metagame.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Boasting a 58% critical hit rate when Focus Energy is used, Flareon can deal massive damage to anything it hits with critical hit Fire Blast, even possessing chances to OHKO Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Tauros. In fact, even Rhydon can take up to 60% while being outsped, though that KO is extremely risky to go for. The burn chance is also very helpful, crippling Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros while also aiding in KO ranges; however, landing a burn against Pokemon like Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey can make it significantly harder to beat them in the long run. Body Slam complements Fire Blast well, making Flareon more self-sufficient with paralysis while 2HKOing Chansey and Starmie with consecutive critical hits; however, it's recommended to use Substitute first in this scenario to avoid paralysis. A single critical hit can also put Alakazam into sub-25% range, meaning it cannot use Substitute thereafter; this also puts it in range for Quick Attack to KO. Quick Attack can be used to pick off Pokemon that barely survive Flareon's attacks, or that alternatively have used Substitute to the point they're left with 1 HP. However, Flareon can use Substitute itself for additional safety against paralysis users like Chansey and Exeggutor. It's worth attempting to set up Substitute against paralyzed Pokemon to try and get it for free with full paralysis. However, this is inconsistent, as setting up both Substitute and Focus Energy naturally means giving the opponent free turns, meaning the turns spent can be for naught.</p> <p>Flareon has minor potential to be customized further; generally, the fourth moveslot is used. Double-Edge is a valid option, providing a good option to finish off limping Pokemon or pressure Substitute users while avoiding recoil. Additionally, a critical hit Double-Edge can KO Alakazam if it's taken minor damage or used Substitute. Flamethrower is also a fair option as an accurate Fire Blast alternative with far more PP, but the drop in damage is significant. While Hyper Beam's downsides are poor, a critical hit can OHKO Chansey, Jolteon, and Alakazam while KOing Starmie if it's taken even minute damage, though the recharge turn usually leads to Flareon taking paralysis right after.</p> <p>Flareon is best used late-game when the opposing team has likely been paralyzed, though it can also be used to punish a Snorlax or Exeggutor asleep from Rest, which are decently common sights in the Stadium OU metagame. From there, Flareon can set up Focus Energy with impunity and start firing off potentially nuclear blows at the opposing team. While its consistency is poor, the reward often means removing crucial parts of the opposing team, which Flareon's teammates should greatly appreciate. Flareon works best alongside Pokemon that can consistently land paralysis on the opposing team, such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Because it struggles to break past Slowbro, Starmie, and the rare Kabutops, it's recommended to use it alongside consistent checks to them, such as Thunderbolt Chansey alongside Exeggutor.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Porygon's extremely poor stats make it unappealing at first sight, but its access to Recover and Thunder Wave alongside its immunity to Body Slam paralysis gives it a niche. Porygon can switch into the omnipresent Snorlax and use its 32 Recover PP to stall Snorlax out of its 24 Body Slam PP. Non-Amnesia Snorlax sets can only hope to land multiple critical hits in a row or freeze with Ice Beam if Porygon is not carrying Substitute. Porygon can also act as a pseudo-check to other Pokemon unable to reliably status it such as Tauros, Persian, Cloyster, and Gengar, but their higher Speed and likewise higher critical hit rates make switching in a risky proposition.</p> <p>The biggest issue with Porygon is its passivity. Pokemon like Chansey and Exeggutor take minimal damage and threaten to paralyze Porygon, forcing it to switch out, as paralysis makes it incapable of reliably walling Snorlax. Porygon also struggles heavily against the common Amnesia Snorlax; Porygon can only temporarily stall it with Substitute or attempt to freeze it with Ice Beam. To make things worse, Cloyster gives Porygon strong competition as a more reliable check to Amnesia Snorlax and other Normal-types.</p>",

        "Standard": {
          "description": "<p>Recover and Thunder Wave are both essential for walling Snorlax and threatening paralysis on switch-ins, so Porygon should never drop either of these moves. Ice Beam is Porygon's main attacking move, as it does decent damage, has a chance to freeze, and prevents Rhydon from using Porygon as free entry. Thunderbolt pairs well with Ice Beam as coverage, notably threatening Starmie and Cloyster with a 3HKO, and its 24 PP can be useful in PP stalling. Double-Edge can be used instead of Thunderbolt to threaten Chansey and Alakazam, but it only 3HKOes Alakazam and has a chance to 3HKO Chansey while dealing significant recoil to Porygon. When using Thunderbolt or Double-Edge against Chansey, Starmie, Alakazam, and Slowbro, Porygon should only attack on the switch or if the foe is in KO range, as these Pokemon have Thunder Wave. Porygon can use Blizzard over Ice Beam for high odds of 3HKOing Exeggutor and always 2HKOing Rhydon, but it only has 8 PP, so Porygon needs to play more conservatively than it would with Ice Beam. Psychic can force out Snorlax with repeated Special drops but gives completely free entry to the many Psychic-types that can paralyze Porygon. Thunder can be used as a stronger alternative to Thunderbolt that 2HKOes Cloyster and has a chance to 2HKO Starmie, but its poor accuracy makes this unrealistic. Lastly, Conversion can be used to copy a foe's typing, but this is only useful if Snorlax is already dealt with, as Porygon is extremely likely to take paralysis when using this move.</p> <p>The key to making this set work is paralyzing Snorlax, preferably before Porygon switches in so it doesn't have to risk a critical hit when using Thunder Wave. Once Snorlax is paralyzed, Porygon should use Recover every time Snorlax attacks and only attack when Snorlax is fully paralyzed. Porygon needs to remain unparalyzed to wall Snorlax effectively, so it should almost always switch out when facing Pokemon that can paralyze it. Once Snorlax is forced to use Rest, the Porygon user can bring in a strong special attacker to force Snorlax out. If the opposing Snorlax has Amnesia, Porygon should paralyze it and switch to a teammate that can handle it, such as Starmie, Slowbro, or one's own Amnesia Snorlax. Once the opposing Snorlax is revealed to have Amnesia, Porygon can be used as a weaker Chansey to check an opposing Chansey or Starmie. At full HP, Porygon can also threaten Thunder Wave on faster Pokemon like Tauros and Zapdos, but a critical hit attack puts it in range of being KOed by a non-critical hit attack, making switching in extremely risky.</p>"

        "Substitute": {
          "description": "<p>Porygon makes use of the buffed Stadium Substitute to block status moves and create free turns against paralyzed foes. Snorlax's Ice Beam fails to break Substitute, giving Porygon a free turn and dissuading Snorlax from trying for a freeze. Substitute also makes Recover more efficient, as it allows Porygon to dip below 50% HP risk-free as long as it maintains enough HP to heal out of range of a critical hit Body Slam. Recover and Thunder Wave are crucial, as Recover enables Porygon to stall with Substitute, and paralysis is Porygon's main way of threatening Pokemon that otherwise don't mind switching in and gaining free turns. Ice Beam is the most common choice of attack for its ability to threaten freeze and its solid coverage, hitting Exeggutor, Rhydon, and Zapdos super effectively. Double-Edge is Porygon's strongest reliable STAB move and has more PP than Ice Beam. It does decent damage against most Pokemon, but it does almost nothing to Rhydon, Reflect Snorlax, and Cloyster while dealing recoil damage to Porygon.</p> <p>Substitute Porygon greatly appreciates paralysis support, especially against Snorlax so that Porygon does not have to risk a critical hit when paralyzing it. After Snorlax has been paralyzed, Porygon can use Recover and Substitute to fish for full paralysis and use these opportunities to attack. Depending on the opponent's team, Porygon may not want to reveal its only attack, so it can also PP stall and limit switches with Thunder Wave. This set should be paired with counters for the Pokemon that wall its only attack; for example, Chansey is on nearly every team and supports Porygon greatly, helping against the strong Psychic-types and other special attackers while paralyzing them with Thunder Wave. Slowbro is another great teammate, as it handles Amnesia Snorlax and helps check and paralyze foes that can trouble Porygon such as Exeggutor, Alakazam, Cloyster, and opposing Slowbro. Exeggutor is good for handling Rhydon, making it a great teammate for Double-Edge sets. Porygon can also drop its Speed stat by a single point to underspeed Rhydon, allowing Porygon to constantly use Recover and stall out Earthquake. Unfortunately, Rhydon is still heavily favored to win this matchup, as its Earthquake usually does over 50% to Porygon and OHKOes it with a critical hit, while Ice Beam seldom 2HKOes in return. However, being able to waste Earthquake PP can be quite useful, and Porygon is unlikely to gain anything from speed tying Rhydon if it lacks Ice Beam anyway.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Porygon is a small fish in a big pond. Its stats are typical of an unevolved Pokemon, making it much slower and weaker than just about everything. Despite this issue, Porygon's access to Recover and immunity to paralysis from Body Slam give it just enough to be a surprisingly viable pick in OU. These two traits make Porygon an impeccable switch-in to one of the most important Pokemon in OU, Snorlax. Porygon has just enough Speed and physical bulk to switch in against Snorlax and stall out its 24 Body Slam PP with its 32 Recover PP. Most variants of Snorlax will struggle to make any progress against Porygon, meaning Porygon can consistently force it to switch out, as it is almost never worth using Snorlax's Self-Destruct against such a low-value Pokemon. Porygon should always be used with Chansey to create a defensive core; Chansey can handle special attackers like Alakazam and Starmie, while Porygon can handle Snorlax and paralyzed physical attackers.</p> <p>While its matchup against Snorlax is its main selling point, Porygon can wall some other Pokemon in a pinch. Pokemon that are unable to reliably status Porygon will usually struggle to defeat it in a head-to-head matchup. Especially if they are paralyzed, Porygon is relatively comfortable against Tauros and Gengar, for example. However, Porygon has some consistency issues in even its best matchups. Critical hits and strong attacks can expose its poor defensive stats, Ice Beam and Blizzard can freeze it, Special drops from Psychic can overwhelm it, and paralysis can render it unable to wall Snorlax securely. Perhaps worst of all, Porygon can be easily overpowered by Amnesia Snorlax, meaning it will have almost nothing to do against teams with that set.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Porygon has a very deep movepool to play with, both offensively and defensively. Psychic is likely the most valuable alternative coverage move. Psychic comes with a useful chance to drop the foe's Special, but Thunderbolt or a Normal-type move tends to be superior because of the many Psychic-type Pokemon that can come in and scare Porygon out. Psywave is mildly useful as a universal coverage option that can deal up to 150 damage. However, its low accuracy and heavy randomness make it less than reliable.</p> <p>Reflect can make Porygon even more consistent against Snorlax and Tauros. However, it can be difficult to find an opportunity to use it, as Porygon will generally want to heal or use Thunder Wave first in most cases. Flash is another move for bullying Snorlax and common switch-ins. While the move has poor accuracy itself, it can help Porygon keep up some momentum, as most Pokemon will want to switch out after sustaining the accuracy drop. Sharpen can slowly but surely boost Porygon’s Attack so it can deal hefty damage with Tri Attack or Hyper Beam. Setting up with Sharpen is often quite difficult because Porygon is easy to scare off with paralysis, but it can potentially succeed against a weakened or paralyzed team. Recover also makes Porygon unique among other boosting Pokemon, as it can heal and doesn’t necessarily need to commit to attacking once it starts setting up.</p> <p>Conversion is a mildly interesting option that Porygon can use to combat certain special attackers like Alakazam, Jynx, Cloyster, and Jolteon. Realistically, however, Conversion will only be useful if Snorlax is already dealt with, as most special attackers have a way to paralyze Porygon—negating its primary purpose in handling Snorlax—or can simply overwhelm it with strong attacks. Toxic allows Porygon to deal passive damage to Snorlax while it repeatedly uses Recover, thus forcing Snorlax to use Rest sooner, even if it is carrying Amnesia. However, a number of Pokemon that are likely to switch into Porygon, like Chansey, Alakazam, and Starmie, generally don't mind Toxic, as it allows them to dodge more dangerous status effects like sleep, freeze, and paralysis. Finally, Mimic is a decent option on Porygon. The main purpose of Mimic is to pick up Amnesia from Amnesia Snorlax, which otherwise completely bulldozes Porygon. At a mere 25% chance, though, this is not a reliable option, unfortunately.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Paralysis completely ruins Porygon, so Pokemon with Thunder Wave or Stun Spore can consistently force it to switch. This means many Pokemon are very capable of threatening it, including Chansey, Alakazam, Starmie, Zapdos, Jolteon, Slowbro, and some variants of Exeggutor and Victreebel. Unless Porygon has an opportunity to KO these Pokemon, it must almost always switch out into a teammate that can absorb paralysis. Sleep and freeze also quickly deal with Porygon, and it is quite vulnerable to the former due to its low Speed. However, because Porygon has relatively low value, it is often good for Porygon to take sleep or freeze so nothing else on the team must. While rare, confusion also inhibits Porygon a lot, as Porygon isn’t bulky enough to risk hitting itself and giving up a free turn to the opponent.</p> <p><strong>Stat Alteration</strong>: Because Porygon has mediocre defensive stats, it becomes easy to exploit if the foe begins to boost their stats or lower Porygon’s stats. Amnesia users like Snorlax and Slowbro can boost largely unfettered against Porygon and begin doing a lot of damage. Slowbro in particular only needs to get to +4 before it has a chance to OHKO Porygon. Swords Dance users, while not particularly common, also can set up rather comfortably in front of Porygon and overwhelm it. Special drops from Psychic also threaten Porygon quite a lot. Exeggutor, for example, is guaranteed to 2HKO Porygon with Psychic if the first hit drops its Special. Other users like Alakazam and Starmie also have no issue breaking through Porygon after a Special drop.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hits</strong>: Porygon often has trouble with faster foes even if they can’t paralyze it as critical hits imperil Porygon quickly. Tauros, even if it is paralyzed, can potentially break through Porygon if it gets multiple consecutive critical hits. If Snorlax gets a critical hit, it often places Porygon on the backfoot, as it will lose more health than it can recoup with Recover in a single turn. Moreover, a desperate Hyper Beam will cleanly OHKO Porygon if Snorlax manages to score a critical hit. Heavy hitters like Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Zapdos will also make short work of Porygon if they can get a critical hit or two.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Porygon’s poor Speed leaves it vulnerable to partial trappers like Cloyster, Victreebel, and Dragonite. Partial trappers can accumulate significant damage on Porygon and pivot to a hard counter, all before Porygon has a chance to heal.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Wall": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Recover is one of the most important moves in RBY and the primary reason Porygon has a niche. The move is mandatory for Porygon to wall and stall Snorlax. Given Recover's 32 PP, Porygon can easily absorb all 24 Snorlax Body Slam hits and then some. Unless Snorlax is carrying Amnesia, it lacks any solid option to break through Porygon. Outside of a freeze from Ice Beam or multiple consecutive critical hits, Snorlax can only feasibly beat a healthy Porygon with Self-Destruct. Considering this is generally a poor trade for the Snorlax user, they will often be forced to switch it out. This gives the Porygon user the opportunity to double switch or attack to maintain some momentum. Porygon can prevent Snorlax from getting offensive momentum while keeping Pokemon that often answer Snorlax, like Chansey, Starmie, and one's own Snorlax, safe and available to fill other roles. Porygon is a rather frail Pokemon, so it should use Recover very liberally. It should avoid switching out until it is at or near full health, as it would otherwise risk falling to a heavier hit from Snorlax, like Hyper Beam or any critical hit.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is also essentially required. Paralysis is critical for mitigating Snorlax: full paralysis generates free turns for Porygon, enabling it to attack instead of simply using Recover on most every turn. Paralysis also makes other physical attackers much more manageable. While Tauros is very unlikely to stay in against a healthy Porygon, if it must do so in a desperate endgame, Porygon can rather safely win the one-on-one by using Thunder Wave, using Recover, and waiting for full paralyses to attack and eventually KO Tauros. Similarly, Thunder Wave is a good way to pressure Pokemon like Gengar and Exeggutor. Additionally, because Porygon pretty consistently forces Snorlax to switch, Porygon can potentially paralyze the Pokemon that commonly switch in like Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam. However, doing this may prevent Porygon from reaching full health before it switches out, as Porygon will have to switch out in fear of paralysis.</p> <p>While Porygon may have dismal offensive stats, it has a large and diverse offensive movepool. Ice Beam is the most common attack on Porygon primarily due to its ability to freeze foes. While Porygon generally defeats Snorlax via a war of attrition regardless, it is more than happy to cut the war short with a freeze. Ice Beam allows Porygon to participate in freeze wars and keep higher value Pokemon, like Chansey and one’s own Snorlax, safe from bad luck. Ice Beam is also a reasonable coverage move with a potential 2HKO on Rhydon and likely 4HKOs on Exeggutor and Zapdos. Being able to chip or even potentially freeze switch-ins like Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam is also significant. Porygon’s final move extends its coverage. Thunderbolt is the most common choice, as it complements Ice Beam famously well. It notably enables Porygon to bully or finish off Water-type Pokemon like Starmie, Slowbro, Cloyster, and Lapras, especially if they are paralyzed. It also has a fair amount of PP to improve Porygon's ability to stall. Tri Attack is a fairly strong option that can pressure Pokemon with more special bulk, like Chansey, Alakazam, and Jynx. Finally, Hyper Beam is an option that can catch switch-ins and paralyzed foes by surprise. It can reliably pick off Chansey below 45% health and Alakazam below 60%. The choice for Porygon’s second offensive move often comes down to its teammates and player preference.</p> <p>Porygon has a very straightforward gameplan. Generally, it needs to do two things to stay successful. First, Porygon should try to stay as healthy as possible. Porygon should aim to switch out with as much health as possible so it can consistently answer Pokemon like Snorlax. It should generally only attack when it is close to or at full health. Two important benchmarks to keep in mind are 76.5% and 84.6% HP; Porygon must be at or above these points to survive a Hyper Beam and a critical hit Body Slam, respectively, and thus feel comfortable attacking instead of healing. It is imperative that Porygon ends every turn above both of these benchmarks, especially before it is switched out. In general, Porygon should prioritize Recover and Thunder Wave over attacking. Second, Porygon should avoid paralysis. Paralysis is often a death sentence for Porygon, as it will become slower than Snorlax and very easy to exploit on turns when it is fully paralyzed. Unless it can KO them immediately, Porygon should generally switch out when faced with paralysis inducers like Chansey, Starmie, Alakazam, Slowbro, Jolteon, Zapdos, and Stun Spore Exeggutor. The bigger-picture purpose of using Porygon often comes down to getting more out of one’s Snorlax and Chansey, as neither should need to deal with the opponent’s Snorlax when Porygon can do so. Snorlax is more free to forgo Reflect and explore more offensive options thanks to Porygon’s assistance. Additionally, if Porygon loses a freeze war against Snorlax, one’s own Snorlax can engage in a freeze war with no fear. Chansey works similarly, as it can focus on checking special attackers and be more difficult to exploit.</p>"

Omastar's typing is a double-edged sword that gives it weaknesses to Earthquake and Thunderbolt, which are both common in the metagame.

Hydro Pump also 3HKOes most other Pokemon that are not named Chansey and do not resist Water. This includes Snorlax, so, even if it is carrying Earthquake, Omastar can still force it out if it switches in on a predicted Snorlax Rest. If Hydro Pump's low PP and 79.7% accuracy are a concern, Surf can be used instead at the cost of a noticeable reduction in power. Ice Beam 3HKOes Exeggutor and Zapdos, and it can also be used to fish for a freeze. Body Slam is used specifically to fish for paralysis on switch-ins like Starmie, though it cannot paralyze Chansey, which also likes to switch into Omastar. Seismic Toss is an alternative option to do consistent damage to Starmie, Slowbro, and Cloyster. Rest restores Omastar to full HP and removes any status it had beforehand. With it, Omastar can loop the rare Amnesia Snorlax that runs Ice Beam as its only move. Unfortunately, Snorlax more commonly runs Blizzard when using Amnesia and 3HKOes Omastar with it at +6.</p> <p>Omastar has some other options. Blizzard is usable because it 2HKOes Victreebel and requires less prior chip damage than Ice Beam to 2HKO Exeggutor and Zapdos. However, Victreebel is rare, and Blizzard has less PP and accuracy than Ice Beam. Submission 3HKOes Chansey, but it has little other use, causes recoil damage, and only has 79.7% accuracy. Substitute protects Omastar from Ice Beam freezes and paralysis from Body Slam and allows it to burn a Rest turn for free. Reflect and Withdraw boost Omastar's Defense so it can check Snorlax carrying Earthquake, but they do nothing to stop Chansey, Starmie, and Slowbro from walling it. Mimic is unreliable but can get Omastar solid moves from its switch-ins like Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, and Sing.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Kabutops is a very dangerous Pokemon and among the best Swords Dance users in OU. First of all, its base 115 Attack stat is very respectable, and it sports the best high critical hit rate move in the game—Slash. While this may seem counterproductive for Swords Dance, since in RBY critical hits ignore stat boosts, it means Kabutops can pose an immediate threat without having to raise its Attack. Slash also gives it wallbreaking potential, mostly because critical hits also ignore Reflect. Because Kabutops can switch in on recovery moves such as Rest and Recover and immediately pose a threat, it commonly forces the opponent to switch in a check that lacks recovery, like Exeggutor or Tauros, to force it out. This means Kabutops will do permanent damage. Its typing grants it a valuable resistance to Normal and Ice. This means it can freely set up against Pokemon such as Cloyster, sometimes against Chansey without Thunderbolt (depending on circumstance, the threat of Thunder Wave may pose a problem) and on any variant of Snorlax not packing Earthquake—or the very rare Thunderbolt.</p> <p>However, while Kabutops's typing is certainly one of its key assets, it also leaves it with very unfortunate weaknesses to Electric and Ground. This means it can't switch in as much as it would want against Rhydon despite its Surf and good Defense. Also, Kabutops is easy to force out with Thunderbolt users such as Jolteon, Zapdos, Gengar, Starmie, and Lapras—the first four outspeed it, and Lapras easily survives a +2 Hyper Beam. Kabutops can struggle to discourage them from switching in, giving them great momentum. Surf is weak enough against them to almost give a free switch. A Hyper Beam use can be punished by Gengar, while Swords Dance usually gives free entry to Thunderbolt users. Every move besides Slash is fairly easy to punish—and Gengar even ignores that, countering Kabutops outright. Slash is still a great move and helps deter these threats, but again its critical hits ignore Swords Dance boosts. Therefore, if these threats can pressure Kabutops into using Slash often, they reduce its threat ceiling in practice. Also, Hyper Beam's 10.4% miss chance or Kabutops's 15.6% critical hit rate can just ruin its sweep, a likely scenario if Kabutops is expected to KO several Pokemon consecutively.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can be used to paralyze switch-ins, potentially paralyzing a Pokemon such as Starmie or Exeggutor and thus facilitating a sweeper like Rhydon, but it is difficult to drop one of the listed moves. Dropping Surf means losing to Rhydon and not being able to damage Gengar at all. Dropping Slash makes Kabutops's job of wallbreaking much harder, with it unable to reliably get past Reflect Snorlax and Chansey or hit switch-ins hard, and dropping Swords Dance or Hyper Beam severely hinders its sweeping capabilities. Blizzard may also seem a good choice, but missing out on the OHKO on Rhydon is very detrimental, and Slash hits Exeggutor and Zapdos harder.</p> <p>For a completely different approach, a more defensive set using Rest, Slash, Surf, and either Reflect or Body Slam could be used. It makes use of Kabutops's key resistances to Normal and Ice, with Slash allowing it to not forfeit momentum. However, Reflect is generally only useful against Earthquake from Tauros and Snorlax, the former having a very high critical hit rate anyway and the latter often forgoing Earthquake for overall more useful moves, giving Reflect fringe utility at best. However, Body Slam is fringe too: it moves Kabutops away from purer defense towards a sort of offensive support role, a less unique role that other Pokemon such as Snorlax and Rhydon fulfill better. They don't need to sacrifice as much of their offensive presence—remember that this Kabutops set drops Swords Dance and Hyper Beam—to be physical walls or lure in and paralyze certain threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is undoubtedly the best Kabutops counter, since it can easily come in on any of Kabutops's moves and threaten it directly with Thunderbolt. It easily takes Kabutops down, even while paralyzed, since Surf is a 5HKO. If Sleep Clause is not in effect and no statused Pokemon can safely switch in, Gengar can also safely go for Hypnosis to punish the switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Kabutops and has a 61.5% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt. If Zapdos is paralyzed, it's a check at best though, because Slash and +2 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO. Jolteon only has a 2.4% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt, but its critical hit rate is very high and should be kept in mind. However, if Jolteon is paralyzed or asleep from Rest, it can no longer switch in either, because both Slash + Hyper Beam and +2 Hyper Beam are almost always a KO.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is never OHKOed by Slash + Hyper Beam or +2 Hyper Beam, which means it can easily come in and threaten Kabutops with Thunder Wave, Thunderbolt, or to a lesser extent even Surf and Psychic. However, if it's paralyzed, it has to watch out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor needs Mega Drain to counter Kabutops, since it is almost always KOed by Slash and +2 Hyper Beam. Otherwise, sets without it can come in once and threaten with a status move—or even heavy damage with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Razor Leaf OHKOes Kabutops, and Kabutops cannot realistically expect to KO Victreebel even if it switches in, since a +2 Hyper Beam only has a 1 in 39 chance to OHKO. Much like Gengar, it can somewhat safely go for Sleep Powder if circumstances allow for it.</p> <p><strong>Lapras</strong>: Lapras checks Kabutops in a similar way to Exeggutor, with the notable difference that it can generally switch in twice instead of once, and Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 2HKO. It can also use Sing similarly to Gengar.</p>",

        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set makes Kabutops a very menacing threat in OU, although the reasons why may not be immediately apparent. While Slash does not benefit from Swords Dance boosts, it comes off of a very high 115 base Attack stat, which allows it to immediately threaten a paralyzed Alakazam or Chansey (and Starmie to a lesser extent), as well as Rest Snorlax. If the former two have full paralysis on a recovering turn or Kabutops comes in on Rest from the latter, the opponent will be forced to switch them out, most likely to a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Tauros that takes permanent damage. Slash is not a 3HKO on Snorlax, but Snorlax cannot just stall Kabutops with Rest because it is too easy to predict the Rest and use Swords Dance. Once Kabutops is at +2, two Slashes and a Hyper Beam KO Snorlax after Rest before it can attack, forcing Snorlax to switch or risk fainting. Even if Snorlax uses Reflect, it offers little protection because Kabutops has plenty of opportunities to boost to +4. Alternatively, Kabutops can fish for a critical hit with Surf while Snorlax is asleep—a viable strategy considering Kabutops's respectable critical hit rate.</p> <p>The benefits of Slash don't end here, though. Slash with +2 Hyper Beam is enough to KO Zapdos and Tauros 100% of the time, as well as Exeggutor 95.4% of the time. If Chansey is at 88.6% health, Slash + Hyper Beam becomes a guaranteed KO. At 84.4%, Slash becomes a guaranteed 2HKO too, so a little bit of chip damage comes a long way in breaking through Chansey.</p> <p>Kabutops also packs a big, big punch as a late-game sweeper. +4 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO on Exeggutor and anything more frail than it. With a bit of chip damage, +2 Hyper Beam KOes Starmie and Chansey. Kabutops is not very hard to find setup opportunities with, either: any sleeping Pokemon such as Rest Cloyster, Snorlax, or Jolteon (provided it comes in on the latter's Rest turn) will do. Sleep fodder your opponent is trying to sack, a Rhydon switching out fearing Surf, and an untimely full paralysis are other possible setup windows.</p> <p>Kabutops also distinguishes itself from other setup sweepers because paralysis does not end its usability in the game. While its late-game sweeping abilities are hindered, its respectable Speed means it's still very capable of beating several Pokemon such as Chansey, Snorlax, Cloyster, and paralyzed Alakazam, using Swords Dance to reapply the latter's paralysis Speed drop and outspeed it. Paralyzed Kabutops also still does significant damage with Slash to potential switch-ins.</p> <p>Kabutops's typing plays a key role in the Tauros matchup, and typing is perhaps the main asset it has over Sandslash and Kingler. Kabutops's Rock typing means that Tauros will generally resort to Earthquake to beat it, or the much rarer Thunderbolt. Not only does Earthquake have a mere 2.2% chance to 2HKO, it will also never OHKO a full health Kabutops with a critical hit. Sandslash is always 2HKOed by Tauros's Blizzard and OHKOed if it's a critical hit, while Kingler taking on Tauros is likely to find itself paralyzed by a neutral Body Slam, severely hindering its ability to continue the sweep. Earthquake also comes without a freeze or paralysis chance, which gives Kabutops much better odds at late-game sweeping. Unboosted Kabutops can even beat Tauros one-on-one in some situations, usually winning if Tauros is damaged by Slash beforehand or switches in on it. Kabutops also has the most reliable way of disposing of Rhydon and Golem with Surf, since Kingler's Crabhammer has unreliable accuracy, and Sandslash must be at +4 to always OHKO with Earthquake, but this comes the expense of being worse against Gengar.</p> <p>Lastly, Kabutops also has good synergy with Electric-types such as Zapdos. They can seriously threaten each other's counters, and most players will switch Rhydon in without second thought upon sight of Zapdos, allowing for a double switch to Kabutops and subsequent threat of a setup sweep.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl finds a niche on defensive teams in Ubers for its ability to completely stonewall standard Mew and Snorlax sets as well as some variants of Tauros thanks to its unique Rock / Flying typing. Once it sets up Reflect, it takes negligible damage from even a +6 Mew Body Slam. Aerodactyl is also gifted with an exceptional base 130 Speed, which gives it a sky high 25.39% critical hit rate and ties it with Jolteon and Mewtwo as the second fastest Pokemon in the game.</p> <p>However, Aerodactyl's flaws massively outweigh its benefits. Its damage output is mediocre at best, struggling to threaten strong special attackers such as Mewtwo and Slowbro even on a critical hit, while it gets 2HKOed or 3HKOed in return by most special attacks; this lets Mewtwo and Slowbro switch in with little issue. Aerodactyl also cannot meaningfully threaten physical attackers outside of trying to burn them with Fire Blast, which is extremely risky, as it risks accidentally burning a special attacker switching in. Aerodactyl's movepool is extremely shallow, forcing it to run Double-Edge as its main attacking option, and recoil combined with stray hits from Mew and Snorlax wears it down quickly. This chip damage will eventually force it to use Rest, and while it may be able to do so safely against standard Mew and Snorlax, it's forced out by strong special attackers, such as Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Starmie. Once forced out while asleep, Aerodactyl has difficulty getting back in safely due to its frailty and passivity.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast can be dropped within reason, as it has a mere 8 PP and will rarely ever burn its intended target, instead usually burning a special attacker that can shrug off the chip damage and block other status later on. Fire Blast is also completely useless in front of a paralyzed Mew, as Aerodactyl cannot burn it anymore. Sky Attack can be used, as it is Aerodactyl's only way of doing meaningful damage to bulky foes, as a critical hit Sky Attack does 79.2% minimum to Mewtwo and 72.7% minimum to Slowbro. However, Sky Attack is extremely exploitable due to the charge turn. Mimic can be used to attempt to copy a useful move from Mew, such as Swords Dance, Soft-Boiled, Thunder Wave, or Body Slam. However, Mewtwo and Slowbro can still switch in with little issue. Wing Attack has a whopping 56 PP, which, in combination with Reflect and Double-Edge, gives Aerodactyl 112 spare PP to slowly stall out Mew and Snorlax.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo switches into all of Aerodactyl's attacks with little issue, taking negligible damage from even a critical hit Double-Edge while forcing Aerodactyl out with the threat of a 2HKO from any of its special attacks. If Mewtwo gets burned by Fire Blast, this allows it to block other status later on. Mewtwo only has to fear a critical hit Sky Attack, which does 79.2% minimum to it.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro, much like Mewtwo, switches into all of Aerodactyl's attacks with ease and threatens it out with the threat of paralysis and a 2HKO from Surf. Slowbro does have to fear a critical hit from Sky Attack though, as it takes 72.7% minimum and, unlike Mewtwo, is slower than Aerodactyl and lacks immediate recovery.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Aerodactyl takes heavy damage from all Ice-type moves from the likes of Tauros, Chansey, and Amnesia Snorlax. Amnesia Snorlax can be a major issue for Aerodactyl, as Aerodactyl is OHKOed by a +2 Blizzard, preventing it from fulfilling its role as a Snorlax check.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types, such as Zapdos and Jolteon, deal significant damage to Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt, with Zapdos even having a 46.2% chance to OHKO it, whereas Zapdos takes negligible damage in return from Double-Edge and does not fear burn from Fire Blast. Jolteon Speed tying Aerodactyl means Aerodactyl can't attempt to break through it with critical hits, as it risks getting KOed by Thunderbolt after recoil from Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Aerodactyl's Double-Edge and is only 6HKOed by Fire Blast, while it 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt in return, although getting burned by Fire Blast limit's Gengar's longevity as a pivot. Burn also halves the power of Gengar's already middling Explosion. Gengar also has to fear Sky Attack, as it's OHKOed by a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie forces out Aerodactyl with the threat of paralysis and a 2HKO from any of its super effective coverage moves, while Aerodactyl can only 4HKO it with Double-Edge; however, Starmie has to fear Sky Attack, as it's OHKOed by a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Rhydon and Golem both 2HKO Aerodactyl with Rock Slide and take next to no damage from Double-Edge and Fire Blast; however, they have to be wary of getting burned by Fire Blast, as a burned Rhydon or Golem is effectively decommissioned.</p> <p><strong>Non-standard Mew</strong>: Uncommon Mew sets, such as Rock Slide Mew, special attacking Mew, and Transform Mew can catch Aerodactyl off guard; +6 Mew 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Rock Slide even with Reflect up, and special attacking Mew 2HKOes Aerodactyl with super effective moves and 3HKOes with Psychic. Special attacking Mew also does not fear burn from Fire Blast. Transform Mew stalls Aerodactyl out of PP over time.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Rest + Reflect lets Aerodactyl comfortably switch into most Mew and Snorlax sets as well as Tauros lacking Blizzard. Aerodactyl can take up to 5 Body Slam hits from a +6 Mew and 11 Body Slams from Snorlax once it sets up Reflect, so it can use Rest very safely. This lets Aerodactyl stall these foes out of attacking PP, as it can switch in repeatedly to shut them down offensively; special attackers like Mewtwo and Slowbro will usually switch in, so Aerodactyl needs to be partnered with teammates that can switch into them consistently, such as Chansey, Slowbro, and Soft-Boiled Mew. Reflect is imperative on Aerodactyl, as without it, it can be broken through with ease by Mew carrying Body Slam. Snorlax and Tauros lacking Blizzard can also give Aerodactyl issues if it lacks Reflect. With paralysis from Body Slam and Tauros's 21.48% critical hit rate, Tail Whip Tauros can also break a chipped Aerodactyl quite easily if it lacks Reflect.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's main attacking move is Double-Edge, as it does serviceable damage to less bulky foes. However, Double-Edge deals poor damage to bulkier foes such as Mewtwo and Slowbro, which threaten it back with strong special attacks and paralysis. Fire Blast has a 30% chance to burn the foe, incapacitating physical attackers such as Mew, Snorlax, and Tauros. However, Aerodactyl has to be wary of burning foes such as Mewtwo and Starmie, as the burn damage is negligible to them and lets them switch in and block other status later on.</p>"

    "tradebacksou": {
      "overview": "<p>Snorlax is the single most centralizing and defining Pokemon in the tier; the addition of a reliable sleep move to its already wide movepool pushes it to even further heights than before, as nothing can reliably block its Lovely Kiss with paralysis. Nothing switches into Snorlax with complete safety; even Pokemon that resist or are immune to its STAB moves, such as Rhydon and Gengar, are at the mercy of one of its many coverage moves. Snorlax is also incredibly bulky, being one of the few Pokemon that can take a hit from the likes of Tauros and Starmie and hit back even harder with a powerful STAB Body Slam or Hyper Beam; it can also use its STAB Self-Destruct, which demolishes non-resistant foes. Snorlax is on nearly every single serious team and cannot afford to be dropped.</p> <p>However, Snorlax has an abysmal base 30 Speed, tying it with Slowbro for slowest Pokemon in the tier. Its reliance on Rest for recovery makes it exploitable and easily forced out by Pokemon with high critical hit rates such as Alakazam, Starmie, and Tauros. This poor base Speed also saddles Snorlax with a measly 5.86% critical hit rate. That isn't Snorlax's only issue though, as while it has many different options to cover a wide array of matchups, it has to either give up longevity or coverage to do so, meaning there is always something to exploit no matter what set Snorlax runs.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Punch can be used over Ice Beam on Amnesia sets, as it has more PP, which allows Snorlax to stick around for even longer and take more chances to attempt to freeze a foe; however, it is weaker than Ice Beam. Ice Punch can also be used on Reflect sets, as it can freeze opposing Reflect Snorlax and Reflect Chansey and also 3HKOes Rhydon; however, it does negligible damage to even neutral targets. A set consisting of three attacks + Rest can be used to give Snorlax the extra utility of a third attacking move over Reflect while still being able to last longer, but it is difficult to wake Snorlax up without Reflect, as many Pokemon threaten to KO it while it's asleep. A set consisting of two attacks, Lovely Kiss, and Rest can also be used to let Snorlax threaten sleep and preserve itself without falling short in the coverage department. Thunderbolt can be used on Amnesia sets, with a +4 Thunderbolt OHKOing Cloyster and being favored to OHKO Starmie. However, it's generally preferred to run another move, as it doesn't do much else; Body Slam, Self-Destruct, and Snorlax's various utility options all tend to be more useful. Thunderbolt can also replace Amnesia Snorlax's Ice-type move, as Amnesia Snorlax doesn't need the Ice-type coverage to have a decent matchup against most foes. However, this is generally inadvisable, since Snorlax is then walled by Rhydon and Golem. Amnesia can be used in conjunction with Reflect to wall foes both physically and specially. However, this leaves Snorlax with only one attacking move. Headbutt can be used against paralyzed foes to attempt to paraflinch them, but it is unreliable and weaker than Body Slam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is on every competitive team, meaning it will usually end up facing itself. The most important factor in the matchup is whether Sleep Clause has been activated for either side, as Lovely Kiss Snorlax threatens to instantly remove its opposition. A paralyzed Lovely Kiss Snorlax can switch into a Snorlax using Lovely Kiss to deny sleep and threaten it in return. If neither Snorlax threatens Lovely Kiss, Reflect Snorlax can switch into offensive Snorlax sets bar Amnesia and beat them quite comfortably when healthy. If Reflect Snorlax is paralyzed, it struggles to consistently switch into opposing Snorlax, as the chance to lose a turn to full paralysis can cost the game. Amnesia Snorlax can catch a Reflect Snorlax off-guard (RH) and threaten it with boosted special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster switches into Snorlax's Body Slam relatively safely thanks to its staggering base 180 Defense; it also walls most variants of Amnesia Snorlax thanks to its 4x resistance to Ice. Cloyster is also able to tank Snorlax's Self-Destruct decently, as it only does 75.5% maximum. Cloyster 4HKOes Snorlax with Blizzard and can chip it with Clamp. Cloyster can also use Explosion on Snorlax if it's weakened to put Snorlax into KO range of a revenge killer, doing 60% minimum. However, Cloyster must be wary of Lovely Kiss as well as Body Slam paralysis. Cloyster is particularly wary of Hyper Beam Snorlax, as if it is paralyzed by Body Slam, it is at serious risk of being put into Hyper Beam's KO range.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro switches into Snorlax's Body Slam with relative ease, as it is 4HKOed most of the time and threatens Snorlax with paralysis and Amnesia-boosted Surf. Slowbro can also set up Reflect to become even better at tanking Snorlax's hits. However, Slowbro can quickly get worn down into Hyper Beam's KO range and fears Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: While there aren't many special attackers that enjoy taking a Body Slam, many special attackers, such as Alakazam, Starmie, Exeggutor, and Zapdos, can 3HKO Snorlax with their STAB attacks, applying significant pressure. This is especially true if Snorlax has used Rest, often forcing it out while it's still asleep.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar walls non-Amnesia Snorlax without Earthquake, although Gengar risks getting frozen if Snorlax has an Ice-type move. Gengar is a great Lovely Kiss absorber, as even if it's asleep, it can freely attempt to wake up in front of Snorlax without Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: The passive and unassuming Porygon finds a niche in completely stonewalling non-Amnesia variants of Snorlax once Sleep Clause is activated, as it is 3HKOed by Body Slam and stalls Snorlax out of attacking PP with Recover. Snorlax can OHKO it with Self-Destruct, but trading Snorlax for Porygon is an awful trade for the Snorlax user in most circumstances. Even if Sleep Clause is not activated, Porygon's generally low value makes it a good choice to absorb sleep.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Unparalyzed Chansey switches into Snorlax and sets up Reflect once Sleep Clause is active, while Counter Chansey can OHKO Snorlax by correctly predicting Body Slam. If Chansey is paralyzed, it finds it much harder to reliably check Snorlax, as unparalyzed Snorlax now outspeeds it, and the full paralysis chance makes it unreliable even against paralyzed Snorlax. Once it's paralyzed, Chansey is also extremely susceptible to Hyper Beam, even if Snorlax is paralyzed. Snorlax can also choose to use Self-Destruct to OHKO Chansey without Reflect set up to enable its special attacking teammates.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types wall Snorlax lacking coverage, as they take negligible damage from Snorlax's STAB attacks. Rock-types without Rest are, however, prone to getting worn down over time and hamstrung by Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Persian</strong>: Persian can switch into a Snorlax that has used Rest and put it under major pressure, as two Slashes followed by either a critical hit Body Slam or Body Slam and another Slash KO Snorlax. Persian can also threaten Snorlax and its teammates with Hypnosis.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the defining set of RBY Tradebacks, combining utility and raw power in a way that completely restructures the rest of the metagame. With just two moves, Body Slam and Lovely Kiss, Snorlax exerts a tremendous amount of pressure on the opposing team the moment it hits the field, threatening to deal significant damage to most of the tier and incapacitating anything that attempts to check it with Lovely Kiss before continuing on its rampage. Earthquake is Snorlax’s best coverage option, dealing heavy damage to Rhydon and Gengar—two of the few Pokemon not threatened by its Body Slam—and allowing Snorlax to scout for Counter on Chansey and opposing Snorlax while still doing serviceable damage. Hyper Beam is the other common choice, allowing Snorlax to threaten KOs against many common Pokemon, such as Chansey, Persian, Tauros, Exeggutor, and Hypno, after only one or two hits. Self-Destruct rounds out this moveset, allowing Snorlax to threaten extreme damage while low on health or when its team needs it to force immediate progress. It OHKOes physically frail foes such as Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam and does heavy damage to even physically bulky threats, doing a minimum of 72.2% to Slowbro and 64% to Cloyster. However, Snorlax is usually forced to use Self-Destruct rather early due to its awful base Speed.</p> <p>This set single-handedly influences the tier in numerous ways, making the tier faster paced compared to standard OU. With this Snorlax set, it is far less risky for teams to focus on spreading paralysis early, since its physical moves let it reliably push sleep past common sleep blockers, such as Alakazam, Chansey, and Starmie This set makes Snorlax extremely difficult to check because it can rely on allies to paralyze physically frail foes, and it can then put the physically defensive foes that would otherwise withstand its attacks to sleep. After Snorlax has put a foe to sleep, it still is extremely threatening and can continue battering away at the enemy team due to its raw damage output.</p> <p>Despite these upsides, this Snorlax set requires team support due to its lack of defensive utility. Without any form of recovery, Snorlax is not able to reliably switch into physical attackers throughout the game, necessitating it be paired with teammates such as Starmie and Cloyster, which can help cover these roles traditionally filled by Snorlax. This set’s lack of recovery also makes Snorlax vulnerable to getting worn down, as it is often forced to take a hit before it can land an attack or Lovely Kiss due to its poor base Speed. Snorlax benefits greatly from teammates that can spread paralysis, such as Chansey, Alakazam, Starmie, Zapdos, and Exeggutor, which alleviate some of this pressure. This Snorlax set also works well on fast-paced hyper offensive teams that attempt to mow down the foe with multiple Explosion users.</p>"

        "Mixed Attacker (Amnesia)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Amnesia can not only let Snorlax perform as a threatening mixed attacker, but it can also give it a decent defensive profile depending on the moves it uses, allowing it to either play the role of wallbreaker or a less immediately threatening but longer-lasting mixed attacker. The offensive variant uses Blizzard and either Lovely Kiss or Self-Destruct to mow down foes quickly. +2 Blizzard OHKOes Rhydon and Golem, 2HKOes Zapdos, Persian, and Exeggutor, and has a 76.2% chance to 2HKO Tauros. It also 3HKOes Gengar and opposing Snorlax, which allows it to break through opposing Reflect Snorlax. Lovely Kiss allows Snorlax to put a foe it might otherwise struggle against, such as Cloyster or Starmie, to sleep; it also gives Snorlax a good opportunity to set up Amnesia, which it may otherwise struggle to do. Self-Destruct lets it KO or heavily damage a foe once it has been worn down, and it also gives Snorlax a good way to free itself from dire situations. The more defensive variant forgoes Blizzard for Ice Beam and runs Rest in place of Lovely Kiss or Self-Destruct. Ice Beam is much weaker than Blizzard; at +2 it 3HKOes Tauros, Exeggutor, and Zapdos and 4HKOes opposing Snorlax, but it allows Snorlax to stick around for longer and attempt to freeze a foe.</p> <p>Amnesia Snorlax requires paralysis support to make significant progress for its team, as foes such as Chansey and Starmie may thwart it if they are left unparalyzed. Body Slam is also usually not sufficient enough to handle a healthy Cloyster. Offensive Amnesia Snorlax should try to switch in on either a Pokemon using a recovery move or an attack that will deal minimal damage, as it needs to be at or near full HP to pressure the opposing team. Defensive Amnesia Snorlax should attempt to do the same, but it can afford to switch into a stray special attack from the likes of a paralyzed Starmie or Exeggutor if need be. The defensive set can also attempt to get past the likes of Starmie and Reflect Chansey by freezing them.</p>"

        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Reflect lets Snorlax take full advantage of its good physical bulk, allowing it to shrug off hits from the likes of Tauros, Rhydon, and opposing Snorlax while still being offensively threatening itself. The fourth move on Reflect sets can change depending on what coverage is required for Snorlax's team. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar and Jolteon, 3HKOes Rhydon, and scouts for Counter on Chansey and opposing Snorlax, although it lacks the offensive power of Hyper Beam or Self-Destruct. Hyper Beam is Snorlax's best move against chipped foes; it also allows it to feasibly beat Cloyster and Slowbro one-on-one, but Hyper Beam leaves Snorlax walled by Rock-types and Gengar and has a limited amount of PP. Self-Destruct allows Snorlax to remove or heavily damage a foe after it has fulfilled its role as a wall. It is also a good option to KO a foe in an emergency, and it makes Reflect Snorlax less reliant on its teammates to force progress, although it shares similar issues to Hyper Beam. Lovely Kiss allows Reflect Snorlax to push sleep past paralyzed Chansey, Alakazam, and Starmie to remove foes it may have trouble breaking otherwise, such as Cloyster. However, it leaves Snorlax with only Body Slam as an attacking move, giving it limited PP to threaten things and leaving it walled by Rock-types and Gengar.</p> <p>Reflect allows Snorlax to be a durable check to the tier's best physically offensive threats. Reflect is crucial to Snorlax's longevity, as it allows it to reliably use Rest to heal off damage and paralysis; without Reflect, Snorlax's bulk is not good enough to reliably wake up. Reflect Snorlax is one of the tier's best switch-ins to most opposing Snorlax sets if an ally has already been put to sleep. It's also a decent switch-in to Tauros, though Tauros's high critical hit rate makes any switch-in somewhat unsafe. Snorlax has to utilize its HP carefully to balance its role as an offensive powerhouse with its use as a durable physical tank that can last throughout the game. While it doesn't love getting paralyzed, it is much more willing to take it than sets lacking Rest, as it can reliably cure itself at a later point in the game; Snorlax also still pressures the vast majority of the tier even when it's paralyzed.</p>"

        "PhysLax (All-Out Attacker)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Snorlax's good bulk and amazing Attack allow it to function well as an all-out physical attacker, being able to go one-on-one against nearly every single foe with the combination of Body Slam, Hyper Beam, Earthquake, and Self-Destruct. Hyper Beam threatens KOs against many common threats after only one or two hits, such as Chansey, Persian, Tauros, Exeggutor, and Hypno. Earthquake is Snorlax’s best coverage option, threatening heavy damage on Rock-types and Gengar, which aren't threatened by its STAB moves. Earthquake also has the advantage of being able to scout for Counter on Chansey and opposing Snorlax, with Earthquake still putting Chansey into Hyper Beam KO range. Earthquake or Hyper Beam can be dropped in favor of Counter to catch opposing Snorlax and Tauros off guard—landing Counter against Tauros's Body Slam leaves it in Hyper Beam range, and landing Counter on opposing Snorlax's Body Slam deals at least 48.4% to it. Once Snorlax is low on HP, it can use Self-Destruct to punch another hole in the opposing team; physically frail threats such as Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam are OHKOed and even physically bulky threats such as Cloyster and Slowbro take heavy damage.</p> <p>PhysLax, much like Lovely Kiss Snorlax, is on a timer to get things done due to its lack of recovery and poor Speed. It also needs to play around the threat of paralysis, losing much of its offensive pressure and struggling to break many foes without using Self-Destruct if it takes paralysis. PhysLax can be used on teams that already have a reliable sleeper, such as Exeggutor or Jynx, that also want the extra utility of an additional attack. To make full use of PhysLax, it's vital to know when to preserve it and when to sacrifice it with Self-Destruct; it usually wants to use Self-Destruct when it's either backed into a corner or relatively low on HP. This Snorlax set greatly enjoys heavy paralysis support, so Pokemon such as Starmie, Chansey, and Exeggutor make great teammates to it. This set also pairs well with other Explosion users, such as Exeggutor and Golem, on fast-paced hyper offense teams that aim to overwhelm the opponent. Starmie and Cloyster make good partners to this set, as it lacks defensive utility; without recovery, Snorlax is not able to reliably switch into physical attackers throughout the game, which Starmie and Cloyster can do well in Snorlax's place. This set’s lack of recovery also makes it prone to getting worn down quickly and being forced to use Self-Destruct quite early, as it is often forced to take a hit before it can land an attack due to its poor base Speed.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Thanks to its incredible bulk, offensive prowess, and varied movepool, Snorlax is a near-mandatory Pokemon for every RBY Ubers team. Its Body Slam is incredibly powerful, and few Pokemon can consistently handle it. However, Body Slam isn’t the only weapon Snorlax has in its arsenal. Earthquake and its Ice-type coverage allows Snorlax to deal with Normal-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Rhydon, Golem, and Gengar. Snorlax also has access to STAB Self-Destruct, which, paired with its base 110 Attack, is the strongest unboosted move in the game. With Self-Destruct, Snorlax is one of the best Pokemon to deal with the kings of RBY Ubers: Mewtwo, Mew, and Chansey. Moreover, in order to increase its physical bulk and longevity, Snorlax can sometimes run Reflect and Rest, allowing it to consistently check opposing Snorlax and Tauros.</p> <p>However, Snorlax is incredibly slow. With base 30 Speed, it’s slower than every other fully evolved Pokemon except Slowbro. Therefore, Snorlax has to take a hit before acting, meaning it will be easier to KO, especially if Snorlax doesn’t run Rest. Rest is the only option Snorlax has to heal. Once Rest is used, Snorlax becomes passive, giving the opponent the chance to send anything in against it, especially special attackers like Exeggutor, Alakazam, and Mewtwo, which can effectively pressure it with the nuclear Psychic.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Amnesia is conceivable. Paired with Reflect and Rest, Snorlax becomes nigh unbreakable, but, in return, Snorlax has only one slot for an attacking move, severely limiting its offensive potential. Ice Beam and Blizzard are terrible against Ice-type Pokemon and only pressure Chansey and Mewtwo with the threat of a freeze. This is quite notable, as it will essentially KO them and free up your own Mewtwo, but this can be easily played around. On the other hand, opting for Body Slam leaves Snorlax helpless against common bulky answers like Cloyster, Mew, Slowbro, Mewtwo, Gengar, and Rhydon. You can also choose to pair Amnesia with Rest, Body Slam, and Blizzard, but this set has trouble with opposing physical attackers, which can exploit the fact that Snorlax is not an immediate danger. Unfortunately, this Snorlax combines both PhysLax and ReflectLax's problems, since it is weak to physical attacks and very passive once Rest is used. Finally, every Amnesia Snorlax can realistically lose against Mewtwo due to its very high critical hit ratio.</p> <p>Snorlax has access to plenty of Normal-type moves. Double-Edge and Mega Kick are stronger than Body Slam, but due to their negative aspects—namely, Double-Edge's recoil and Mega Kick's low accuracy—Body Slam remains a better option. Headbutt lets Snorlax fish for flinches against paralyzed foes, which can be useful in some situations; however, it’s hard to find the space for this move in Snorlax's moveset without compromising its offensive prowess.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Opposing Snorlax</strong>: With Reflect and Rest, Snorlax is able to nullify the action of opposing Snorlax without losing its offensive potential. However, it will eventually be forced to use Rest, leaving it open for setup sweepers like Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Mew to break it. To some extent, PhysLax can come in to wear down opposing PhysLax with Body Slam and Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Thanks to its natural bulk, Slowbro stomachs everything Snorlax can do, repeatedly using Rest to PP stall Body Slam. In addition, Slowbro can threaten Snorlax and the opposing team with Thunder Wave and Amnesia before it threatens to sweep. Slowbro will usually win one-on-one through sheer brute force, often forcing PhysLax sets to use Self-Destruct in a desperate bid to stop it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Many special attackers are able to inflict a lot of damage to Snorlax. However, these Pokemon, namely Mewtwo, Exeggutor, Alakazam, Zapdos, and Starmie, hate to eat take a Body Slam due to high damage and paralysis chance, the latter of which can completely flip the situation and possibly allow Snorlax to win outright. However, they can effectively pressure a Snorlax that has just used Rest, usually forcing it out. Mewtwo can also set up with Amnesia as Snorlax switches out, which can be monumentally difficult to check.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: With its base 180 Defense and Rest, Cloyster is able to handle Snorlax long-term, staving off its Body Slam. Its Blizzard deals a large amount of damage to Snorlax, 3HKOing it if even slightly chipped, all while backed by a small freeze chance. However, freezing Snorlax is often detrimental in RBY Ubers, as freezing Chansey or Mewtwo is often a priority. Cloyster's unique access to Clamp allows it to easily chip Snorlax into Blizzard 3HKO range or pivot to a more effective Pokemon to check Snorlax. Snorlax can situationally win against Cloyster if it lands Body Slam paralysis or gets lucky with critical hits, but this is often ill-advised, as it leaves Snorlax vulnerable to being PP stalled by opposing Reflect Snorlax or Chansey in the long-run.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Rhydon is faster than Snorlax, and its Earthquake 3HKOes Snorlax in 97% of cases. On the other side, Snorlax’s Earthquake also 3HKOes Rhydon. Rhydon's Normal resistance gives it many opportunities to come onto the field. However, Rhydon should be careful of paralysis from Body Slam, which can tip the outcome of the duel in Snorlax's favor. Finally, Rhydon with Rest totally walls a Snorlax without Earthquake, Ice Beam, or Blizzard, but these Snorlax sets remain uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Thanks to its Normal immunity, Gengar can easily switch on Snorlax, trying to absorb Body Slam or Self-Destruct and threatening it with Hypnosis or Explosion. Unfortunately, in most cases, Snorlax runs Earthquake in its moveset, making the task harder to complete for Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Surprisingly, Snorlax is unable to beat Porygon without using Self-Destruct or having it paralyzed prior. Indeed, Porygon is faster and can repeatedly use Recover, waiting for Snorlax to run out of Body Slam PP. However, Porygon is very passive and totally useless against every other Pokemon, meaning Snorlax can just switch out without fear, although Thunder Wave can be irksome. However, the tables are turned if Snorlax uses Amnesia, which lets it muscle past Porygon completely. Snorlax shouldn't Self-Destruct, freeze, or really interact with Porygon at all, as its low value outside of checking Snorlax means every move spent trying to beat it is batter spent on anything else outside of forcing it to use Recover.</p>",

        "PhysLax (All-out Attacker)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set, often abbreviated as \"PhysLax,\" is the most popular set in RBY Ubers. With this combination of moves, Snorlax is one of the most difficult Pokemon to switch in on. In addition to the terrifying power of Snorlax's Body Slam, foes must be wary of its paralysis chance on non-Normal-types. With the most powerful Self-Destruct in the game, Snorlax can take down almost any opposing Pokemon other than Rhydon, Golem, and the Normal-immune Gengar, creating a favorable situation; the threat of Self-Destruct forces out high-value Pokemon like Mew and Mewtwo, letting Snorlax make further use of its powerful Body Slam while spreading paralysis. Also, note that Body Slam immediately followed by Self-Destruct KOes Mewtwo and nearly KOes Mew. Hyper Beam has incredible wallbreaking potential after Body Slam, letting Snorlax score 2HKOs against Jolteon and paralyzed Chansey; after two Body Slams, Hyper Beam can even KO Mewtwo. Earthquake allows Snorlax to hit Gengar and Rhydon, which may switch into Snorlax's Normal-type moves. Against opposing Normal-types, Snorlax can use Counter on their very likely Body Slam. This will put Tauros into Body Slam KO range or KO it if Tauros lands a critical hit. Counter also allows you to pressure your opponent if they switch Tauros out after using Body Slam, doing good damage thanks to Snorlax’s massive HP stat. Unfortunately, Snorlax has to drop Earthquake or Hyper Beam to fit Counter in its moveset. If Snorlax is not running Earthquake, it is helpless against Gengar and Rock-types, whereas by choosing to drop Hyper Beam, Snorlax loses a great part of its offensive potential.</p> <p>Snorlax mainly acts as a wallbreaker, whch can tear holes in the opposing team with Body Slam. Once on the field, Snorlax is pretty self-sufficient, so it requires little support. However, it needs to switch in safely. At first glance, Snorlax eats low-damaging moves and can easily switch on them. Even though it takes low damage from many attacks, this Snorlax can't recover HP, and chip damage may be enough to wear it down, so be attentive to any damage taken. Paralysis support benefits Snorlax greatly, as switching in on a paralyzed Pokemon often gives Snorlax the opportunity to threaten the now-slower Pokemon—and by extension, the opposing team that may want to protect it—with heavy damage. One of the most appreciated switch-in opportunities is a paralyzed Chansey, as it lacks the firepower to contest Snorlax and is physically frail, being OHKOed by Self-Destruct and 2HKOed by Body Slam + Hyper Beam. Because many RBY Ubers teams rely on Chansey to duel Mewtwo, it's often not worth it to stay in on Snorlax, forcing it out. Another common way to safely bring in Snorlax is to force a paralyzed Pokemon to heal; this lets Snorlax come in safely on moves like Recover, Soft-Boiled, and Rest, granting immense momentum. Snorlax checks, such as Porygon and Cloyster, trouble the common paralysis gameplan. Cloyster is very bulky but is susceptible to Body Slam paralysis; with some luck, Snorlax can break through Cloyster, though there are alternative solutions such as having Mewtwo or Mew use it as setup fodder while it is asleep. Ways to play around opposing Porygon are similar: it's very passive, so you can send almost anything else in and usually force it out. Finally, a Reflect Snorlax might attempt to switch into Snorlax, trying to curb its action. If you can force it to Rest, you can then pressure it with your strong special attackers, such as Mewtwo, while also creating opportunities to switch in later.</p> <p>Self-Destruct can take down a very useful opposing Pokemon, opening doors for the rest of your team while bringing strong allies in with impunity. Self-Destruct is one way to deal with a paralyzed threat, such as a paralyzed Mewtwo, inflicting between 78% and 93% damage, which may KO it or allow you to revenge kill it with a faster Pokemon like Tauros or Mew. The threat of Self-Destruct may force out the opposing Pokemon, creating favorable momentum. Finally, at low HP, Snorlax can also use Self-Destruct, hoping to take down an opposing Pokemon with it. Keep in mind that Self-Destruct is very predictable, and an experienced player will try to predict it by sending in Pokemon like Gengar, Golem, and Rhydon, or they may opt to sacrifice a sleeping, frozen, or heavily weakened Pokemon. Moreover, be careful not to use Self-Destruct too early, as you might need Snorlax later.</p>"

        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is mandatory, being one of the most difficult attacks to switch into due to its power and paralysis chance. Reflect increases Snorlax’s physical bulk, giving it the ability to check opposing physical attackers like Rhydon, Golem, Tauros, and opposing Snorlax. With Rest, Snorlax is able to stay healthy to maintain its role throughout the game. Snorlax can either run Earthquake ro Self-Destruct in its last moveslot. Earthquake gives Snorlax coverage to beat Rhydon, Golem, and Gengar. However, Snorlax might lack an offensive presence, especially against Mew and Mewtwo, which love to use it as setup fodder. In order to compensate this lack of power, Snorlax can run Self-Destruct instead of Earthquake. With Self-Destruct, Snorlax threatens almost every Pokemon in the game. However, with this set, Gengar and Rock-types totally wall Snorlax.</p> <p>Reflect Snorlax can repeatedly enter the battle to sponge weaker moves. Since Snorlax carries Body Slam and other physical moves, it's able to put pressure on paralyzed Pokemon. With Reflect, Snorlax becomes the best answer to opposing Snorlax and Tauros, which inflict superficial damage while Reflect is active, and Snorlax strikes them back with a nuclear Body Slam. Mew sets lacking Earthquake are also walled by this Snorlax set, since Mew’s Body Slam inflicts 30% to Snorlax at most. A huge drawback to this set is the passivity of Snorlax once it has used Rest. Like any sleeping Pokemon, Snorlax is fodder for both Amnesia Mewtwo and Swords Dance Mew.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Snorlax is a centerpiece of the RBY OU metagame. It is present on almost every team due to its incredible strength, bulk, and versatility, in spite of its terrible Speed. Thanks to Reflect, Snorlax can upgrade its physical bulk to truly remarkable levels and begin firing powerful Body Slams with little concern about incoming hits. Defensive answers to its Body Slam do exist, but Snorlax has access to a plethora of options to threaten them, such as Earthquake to get around Gengar and Counter users, or Ice Beam to freeze Pokemon which try to fight Snorlax's Reflect with their own. Furthermore, Snorlax can even opt to give up a traditional Reflect set and catch opponents off-guard by using less common moves such as Amnesia or Counter, which can allow it to bypass some common answers, and it even has access to the strongest Self-Destruct in the game, giving it the ability to eliminate almost any Pokemon if necessary, with only Gengar and Rhydon being able to comfortably absorb it.</p> <p>Despite all these positive qualities, Snorlax comes with two inherent flaws: the lowest Speed in the metagame, only tied with Slowbro, and a lack of recovery outside of Rest. This means that once Snorlax is put to sleep it is possible for many special attackers in the tier to threaten it with their STAB moves: Psychic from the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and even Jynx can rapidly snowball out of control due to the high chance of Special drops, and other strong attacks such as STAB Thunderbolt from Zapdos or STAB Blizzard from any of the Ice-types in the tier can also ensure Snorlax is punished for its Rest turns. Nevertheless, Snorlax is one of the biggest offensive threats and one of the hardest Pokemon to KO at the same time, and its set can be tailored to cover any desirable match ups effectively, which means it's usually hard to find reasons not to run Snorlax on your team.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Snorlax can drop Body Slam entirely to run an Ice Beam / Reflect / Amnesia / Rest set that simply aims to soak up damage and spam Ice Beam until it manages to freeze a foe, but it generally needs to be on very specific types of teams to function, is completely helpless against Ice-types, and needs some luck to break through paralyzed Starmie and Chansey, as Ice Beam's limited PP means so Snorlax cannot fish for consecutive paralysis for long.</p> <p>Surf is the best option available to Snorlax to hit Rhydon and Golem, but given that most Snorlax sets run either Reflect or an Ice-type attack, if not both, the situations where Surf is useful are rare.</p> <p>Harden is sometimes preferred over Reflect for the higher PP count and ability to reapply the Speed drop on paralyzed foes, but it is considerably weaker at answering physical attackers, which is usually the primary duty of Reflect Snorlax.</p> <p>Another unusual set is Body Slam / Amnesia / Thunderbolt / Self-Destruct or Rest: given that Starmie and Cloyster are common switch-ins once Amnesia is revealed and that Thunderbolt is a very, very uncommon attack on Snorlax, this set can attempt to lure them in and cripple them with a strong super-effective attack. Self-Destruct is preferred in the final slot as an emergency option that allows Snorlax to bail out of unsuccessful lure attempts with an even trade, but it is possible to use Rest instead in an attempt to preserve Snorlax as a long-term defensive answer. On this set, it is also possible to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam to avoid being completely walled by Rhydon, though it makes Snorlax much weaker against Chansey and Alakazam, so it is usually not preferred.</p> <p>Body Slam / Reflect / Rest sets can afford a few more options in the fourth moveslot. Toxic can allow partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, Victreebel, and Dragonite to be significantly more dangerous, as any poisoned Pokemon attempting to stall out their PP will run out of HP much more quickly, and Snorlax is particularly good at luring in optimal Toxic targets such as Reflect Chansey. Another move that can fill that slot is Amnesia, making Snorlax incredibly difficult to threaten via special attacks alone but ultimately leaving it relatively powerless, with Body Slam as its only attack. Counter is also viable, as after Reflect has been revealed, opponents will most likely stop playing around Counter, giving you some opportunities to net surprise KOs with it.</p> <p>Other Normal-type attacks such as Mega Kick and Double-Edge are rarely seen due to their drawbacks and overall lack of usefulness when Body Slam is such a reliable move and Hyper Beam is a much stronger one, but the ability to repeatedly hit with a greater Base Power can occasionally come in handy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Reflect Users</strong>: Reflect users, particularly Chansey and opposing Snorlax, can switch in on Body Slam and neutralize the damage output from Snorlax fairly efficiently. They are by far the most reliable defensive answers to Snorlax, and a vast majority of RBY teams are forced to include one of the two, if not both, to check it.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar deserves a special mention due to its unique Ghost typing, which allows it to wall all Snorlax sets that lack Earthquake and use Snorlax as an opportunity to threaten either status with Hypnosis or damage with Thunderbolt. It is especially useful against Snorlax sets that only run Normal-type attacks, but it also performs well against any set that lacks Earthquake or Amnesia (unless Snorlax gets a lucky freeze with Ice Beam).</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Slowbro</strong>: Cloyster and Slowbro are the next best options to switch into Body Slam. Their high defensive stats allow them to come out of the one-on-one matchup on top, but their reliance on Rest to stay healthy and failure to pose a significant immediate threat mean they aren't always the most reliable answers to Snorlax. Slowbro is especially notable, as it can use a sleeping Snorlax as a golden opportunity to set up Amnesia; however, Cloyster has better physical bulk, allowing it to avoid a 4HKO from Body Slam, as well as the ability to use Explosion in case things start to go wrong after paralysis from Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Other Special Attackers</strong>: Although there aren't many special attackers that enjoy taking a Body Slam to the face, many of them are powerful enough to 3HKO Snorlax, which means they can exert a lot of pressure over it, especially when it's forced to use Rest and sit still for a few turns. Starmie, Lapras, Exeggutor, and Zapdos are some good examples of Pokemon that can force Snorlax out with their strong STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Although Porygon's base stats are pitiful, it has access to a very specific set of qualities that make it just good enough to handle Snorlax: it is faster, it is immune to Body Slam's paralysis due to its typing, and Recover's 32 PP allow it to outstall Body Slam's 24 PP. Snorlax's only hopes of breaking down Porygon usually rest on the possibility of landing either a critical hit with Body Slam or a freeze with Ice Beam; however, Porygon is very weak, and it is incredibly easy for the Snorlax player to simply switch out.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types Carrying Rest</strong>: Another very specific countermeasure, Rock-types carrying Rest are generally able to outstall any Snorlax variant that isn't carrying the specific coverage for them. As long as the Rock-type has Rest to stall out repeated Body Slams, there are quite a few of them that can win the one-on-one matchup: non-Earthquake Snorlax will be unable to break through Omastar and Kabutops, non-Ice Beam Snorlax will struggle to wear down Aerodactyl, and even Rhydon can beat a Snorlax in the long run if Snorlax is only carrying Normal-type moves.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Snorlax's Body Slam is one of the most difficult attacks to switch into in the tier due to its sheer power, its paralysis chance, and the relative lack of Normal-type switch-ins in the tier. Reflect allows Snorlax to take on physical attackers, most importantly opposing Snorlax, much more comfortably. Rest gives Snorlax the ability to remain healthy throughout the game. A lot of moves can fit in the last moveslot. The most common one is Ice Beam, as it allows Snorlax to potentially freeze opposing Reflect users, which can otherwise neutralize its Body Slam; however, this leaves Snorlax unable to threaten large amounts of damage in one turn, which means its matchup against many important Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, Cloyster, and Lapras goes from bad to worse, and even its ability to power through a paralyzed Starmie or Chansey goes down significantly. Self-Destruct allows Snorlax to function as a wallbreaker if needed, as well as a defensive piece thanks to Reflect and Rest if preferred, while Hyper Beam provides some of Self-Destruct's wallbreaking power without you having to sacrifice your Snorlax for it; however, a Snorlax that is only carrying Normal-type attacks will struggle against Rock-types and will be entirely unable to damage Ghost-types. Lastly, although Earthquake doesn't provide the freeze threat of Ice Beam or the immediate power of the other moves, it allows Snorlax to beat Gengar and Counter Chansey, two Pokemon that, albeit rare, are usually specifically devised to beat it.</p> <p>Using Reflect Snorlax is particularly nuanced due to having to balance Snorlax as both an offensive and defensive tool. If used too aggressively, it might take a KO but subsequently struggle to find turns to heal back up with Rest, making it a trade that is not always worth taking. On the other hand, if used too passively, it will invite too much offensive pressure and eventually collapse without achieving much of anything. Optimal usage of Reflect Snorlax requires careful analysis of the game state as well as appropriate prediction, but when properly managed, it is incredibly potent, as the special attackers that can threaten it lack either recovery or physical bulk, meaning that teams will generally resort to various stalling tactics to force Snorlax to use Rest first and then pressure it during its sleep turns. Reflect Snorlax is at its best early-game when the opponent has one or more paralyzed Pokemon to take advantage of, most commonly Alakazam and Chansey, and when its teammates can offer the necessary defensive cover against special attackers, but it is no slouch late-game either, as it can trade one-for-one with most Pokemon and has an important positive matchup against Tauros.</p>"

        "Physical Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This moveset is fairly straightforward: maximize offensive prowess to wallbreak as well as possible. Body Slam is the go-to attack to inflict damage, and combined with Hyper Beam, it makes Snorlax particularly dangerous and hard to switch into, especially for paralyzed foes. Self-Destruct is an incredibly potent move to take down an extra Pokemon with Snorlax's last breath or even to take opposing Pokemon by surprise earlier on if the situation calls for it. The last moveslot is a toss-up: Earthquake allows Snorlax to play around Counter Chansey much more comfortably, as well as hitting Gengar and threatening Rhydon, but it can be dropped in favor of Counter, a tool that allows this Snorlax set to muscle through an opponent's Reflect Snorlax with correct prediction. Counter may also be used in conjunction with Earthquake and in place of Hyper Beam; the lack of Hyper Beam is quite noticeable, as it makes Snorlax much less threatening as a wallbreaker, but Earthquake offers unique coverage that could be worth keeping for specific matchups.</p> <p>The absence of recovery on this Snorlax set makes it far riskier to utilize, as it can only take a few hits before being forced to use Self-Destruct. Therefore, this Snorlax set needs to be considered as a tool to accelerate the game and little else, as its defensive capabilities are very limited. This often just means using an early-game Self-Destruct on the opponent's Reflect user to remove them from the situation before they get a chance to set up Reflect. It must be noted that this is a one-for-one trade, which is not always advantageous, but it is often the best that can be achieved with this set, as it is often endlessly walled by Reflect users otherwise; recognizing when to be greedy and when to accept a simple Self-Destruct trade is key to achieving good results with this Snorlax set.</p>"

The last move defines the type of game you want to play with this set: Self-Destruct means hard and fast wallbreaking, as Snorlax simply doesn't have the durability to set up Amnesia multiple times throughout the game, while Rest gives Snorlax those opportunities to set up but leaves it notably vulnerable to Tauros. Ice Beam is an option over Blizzard for the higher PP, which is especially relevant on Rest sets, but Blizzard's considerably greater damage output is generally preferred.</p> <p>This set is quite dangerous to play against due to how difficult it is to answer if your Chansey is paralyzed. Nearly every other common Pokemon is threatened by either Body Slam or a boosted Blizzard, with Water-types like Starmie and Lapras being the best answers defensively but struggling to deal significant damage in return thanks to the Special boost. However, a healthy Chansey usually has no issues switching in and walling this Snorlax variant until it's forced to use Rest, which, in turn, leaves it vulnerable against Tauros. The conditions for this set to excel are difficult to set up, but when they are achieved, this Snorlax set can decide games on its own.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Articuno possesses the most powerful unboosted special attack in the game in its Blizzard, giving it offensive prowess rivaled only by the less consistent Moltres. This alone grants Articuno a strong niche in the tier, outspeeding and 2HKOing the mighty Exeggutor. This offense is backed by a reasonable 15% critical hit rate, with critical hit Blizzard OHKOing even Tauros. With Agility, Articuno can function as a late-game sweeper that is very difficult to stop when the stage is set. This is because it isn't just a strong offensive threat: it's also quite bulky, winning against Tauros one-on-one, or even Zapdos if at +2 Speed. Because of the increased presence of Rest Exeggutor, there are many opportunities for Articuno to switch in and turn the game on its head with nuclear damage output.</p> <p>However, Articuno has some deep pitfalls that make it difficult to use in Stadium OU. Team Preview is a massive hit to its viability, removing all surprise factor that helps set up for a sweep in cartridge play. Articuno only has Normal-type coverage and a poor Attack stat to use it with, so Pokemon like Chansey and Starmie, as well as the rarer Lapras and Cloyster, tend to wall it out. Additionally, its valuable Speed, while high relative to OU, means paralysis inducers force it out, which is worsened by Agility not negating the paralysis Speed drop, unlike standard play. It can use Rest to get rid of it, but this isn't ideal. Due to these flaws, Articuno can be seen as very linear, but its immense power is nothing to sneeze at.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Articuno's Blizzard is the main reason it sees play, OHKOing Rhydon, Golem, and the rare Nidoking; it also 2HKOes a majority of the tier, notably Exeggutor, Tauros, Zapdos, Persian, Kangaskhan, and Alakazam after using Substitute once. The freeze chance also cannot be ignored, giving Articuno a degree of volatility that means even consistent checks like Chansey aren't safe. Double-Edge allows Articuno to consistently pressure Substitute without losing valuable PP against users such as Chansey and Alakazam. It also pressures Blizzard-resistant Pokemon like Starmie and Lapras. Rest is crucial for allowing Articuno to make use of its bulk, giving it staying power against Snorlax and Tauros while removing the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>The third moveslot defines how Articuno will act for its team. Ice Beam acts as a weaker alternative to Blizzard with more PP while still finishing off Exeggutor, ensuring a sustained assault; it can also let Articuno fish for a freeze against big targets like Chansey. Reflect is a viable third option for a bulky approach, stonewalling Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros without much effort; they require two critical hit Body Slams to stop it from repeatedly using Rest if Reflect is active. Reflect doesn't protect Articuno from Persian, though, and it's threatened with a 3HKO from Slash. Agility lets Articuno take a late-game sweeping approach, which, combined with Rest, can be difficult for weakened teams to stop.</p> <p>Articuno cannot break through bulky Water-types, so it's best to cut your losses and have its teammates deal with them. Articuno is often used alongside Thunderbolt Chansey, Zapdos, or Jolteon, forming a two-pronged special offense that can be difficult for teams to counter; Jolteon also appreciates Articuno's Ground immunity. Additionally, Pokemon like Tauros and the ubiquitous Snorlax, which can muscle past physically frail Pokemon like Alakazam, are also of great assistance; Self-Destruct Snorlax also tends to help against Pokemon like Slowbro. Rhydon warrants consideration for reducing the holes opened up by Articuno's weaknesses to Electric and Rock. Gengar shuts down Persian offensively, has good Speed, and has access to Thunderbolt, all of which highly benefit Articuno; Gengar's Explosion also puts Chansey in KO range for Articuno's Double-Edge. Articuno functions best late-game when its bulky Water-type checks have been removed, though Team Preview often makes the opponent less inclined to use them, which frequently means aggressive double switching is necessary to force them in earlier than usual. Articuno can function as a mid-game tank if the opponent lacks a good check. If using Agility and intending to sweep, it's best to bring Articuno in upon a forced Rest from Pokemon like Exeggutor, letting it set up and attempt to muscle past. Articuno can arguably run Hyper Beam alongside Double-Edge despite the drawbacks, namely to finish off Starmie and Chansey from a minimum of 33.4% and 37.9%, respectively. However, it is somewhat difficult to fit into its moveset and comes at severe opportunity cost outside of these matchups.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Articuno’s Blizzard is the strongest attack in RBY that is not Explosion or Hyper Beam. It can even outdamage Mewtwo’s mighty Psychic against neutral targets if both are unboosted. Articuno specializes in tearing huge holes in opposing teams, achieving things like 3HKOs on Mew and Snorlax, 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Zapdos, and clean OHKOs on Rhydon and Golem. Blizzard is very easy to spam, as even resistant Pokemon usually take noticeable damage. The move also comes with a nice chance to freeze and disable a foe for the rest of the game. Articuno also is decently bulky and can take a few strong attacks. For example, Tauros's Body Slam usually takes less than a quarter of its health, assuming it does not get a critical hit.</p> <p>However, Articuno's movepool is abysmal, with almost exclusively Ice- and Normal-type moves to choose from. The latter come off of its mediocre Attack stat, leaving it unable to deal with certain bulky Pokemon like Cloyster and Starmie. Articuno is also rather slow, requiring paralysis support or an Agility in order to function effectively against faster Pokemon. Articuno's low Speed also prevents it from functioning as a good lead, as it is outsped by common leads like Gengar, Jynx, and Starmie. These weaknesses can make Articuno hard to fit on teams at times. Still, Articuno's devastating Blizzard will reward you handsomely for the compensation it needs.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Articuno’s barren movepool leaves it with very few other options to choose from. Sky Attack is a decent option, being Articuno’s only Flying-type STAB move and very powerful in its own right. It can be used over Articuno’s Normal-type coverage, dealing huge damage to Chansey and more damage to Mewtwo. However, its two-turn nature makes it less reliable and harder to use than other moves, and Blizzard does more damage to Mewtwo over two turns. Another option is Ice Beam to save precious Blizzard PP in certain situations. Alongside Rest, it can be used to fish for a freeze, with about an 85% chance to get one with all of its PP used. However, Ice Beam Articuno is completely walled by Jynx and Chansey, since it must drop its Normal-type coverage.</p> <p>Articuno can also utilize Reflect, alongside Rest, to become a good tank that easily staves off hits from Tauros, Mew, and Snorlax. Reflect Articuno's main goal is to freeze a foe, so it should run Ice Beam to maximize that chance. If Articuno uses Reflect, it will likely forgo Agility. This means that, while not completely ruined by paralysis, Reflect Articuno is threatened more by it, since it is forced to use Rest and switch out to negate the Speed drop.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Cloyster completely walls Articuno, since it is 4x resistant to Ice, can't be frozen, and has huge Defense to make Hyper Beam deal next to no damage. Similarly, Lapras takes almost zero damage from Blizzard, can't be frozen, and threatens Articuno with Thunderbolt; however, it must watch out for Hyper Beam if it's at low health. Slowbro can easily set up Amnesia on Articuno but fears a stray freeze or critical hits from Blizzard. Starmie can hit Articuno hard with Thunderbolt and heal from Blizzard damage with Recover, but it too must be wary of a freeze.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: While Chansey must be somewhat healthy to switch in on Articuno carrying Hyper Beam, it takes relatively little damage from Blizzard and can scare Articuno away with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss. However, Chansey must be cautious to not be frozen in the process. Although rare, Articuno can use Sky Attack on a predicted switch to do massive damage the next turn; however, Chansey will likely just heal the damage off.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Jolteon outspeeds Articuno and will almost always 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Articuno also barely misses the 2HKO with Blizzard, meaning it needs a critical hit or a freeze to win one-on-one. Zapdos, albeit weak to Ice, outspeeds Articuno and threatens to 2HKO it with Thunderbolt while narrowly surviving one Blizzard. Jolteon and Zapdos can also paralyze an Agility-boosted Articuno with Thunder Wave to negate its Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: None of Articuno’s attacks hit Mewtwo very hard after it has used Amnesia, except a critical hit Blizzard, and Mewtwo has Recover to heal off any damage it does take. Even unorthodox Mewtwo sets can take at least two Blizzards, allowing Mewtwo to use Thunder Wave on Articuno followed by heavy-hitting moves like Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Mew, Gengar, and Snorlax, among others, can finish off a weakened Articuno with their powerful Explosions even after Articuno has set up with Agility. However, an Articuno using Reflect does not fear them.</p>",

Hyper Beam gives Articuno better odds to defeat Chansey, as Blizzard + Hyper Beam deals a minimum of 59% of damage to it, while also dealing massive damage to Jynx. Double-Edge can be used if Articuno wants to avoid Hyper Beam recharge mind games, but the recoil damage can easily put it into KO range of other threats. Rest allows Articuno to stick around for much longer and fire off more Blizzards. Agility lets Articuno outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. It also makes Articuno less reliant on team paralysis support.</p> <p>Articuno is best used early-game to rip holes into the opposing team with the sheer power of Blizzard, as even Water-types are afraid of switching into Blizzard because of its freeze chance. Switch Articuno in against weaker attacks, such as Chansey's attacks bar Thunderbolt, or on a predicted Earthquake from opposing Mew, Snorlax, or Tauros. It can also switch in against Earthquake from Rhydon or Golem, but it must be very careful, as Rock Slide from either can OHKO Articuno. However, if it manages to come in on their Earthquakes, Articuno will either OHKO them or force them out and do massive damage to something else. Articuno can also be used to absorb paralysis, since it can use Rest later to heal itself or use Agility to negate the Speed drop. Once Articuno is on the field, it should use Blizzard as often as it can and do as much damage to opposing teams as possible.</p> <p>Articuno greatly appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Exeggutor, Mew, and Zapdos. This allows it to be less reliant on Agility, letting it start doing damage faster and more consistently. However, one must be careful when using Thunder Wave, as a Water-type switching into it becomes immune to freeze, meaning Articuno cannot threaten it at all. Tauros can capitalize on holes Articuno makes in the opponent’s team while supporting it by dealing with opposing Chansey, Starmie, and Jynx. It can also spread paralysis with Body Slam to assist Articuno. Articuno appreciates teammates that can deal with Slowbro, which it is helpless against most of the time. Zapdos, Jolteon, and Thunderbolt Mewtwo can use critical Thunderbolts to bypass Amnesia boosts and do huge damage to Slowbro, while Cloyster, Starmie, Lapras, and Light Screen Chansey wall Slowbro even after it has gained boosts. Light Screen Chansey can also check Amnesia Mewtwo, which Articuno struggles to damage after it has set up. Teams with Articuno tend to be weak to Electric-types, so a check to them like Rhydon, Golem, or Jolteon is appreciated.</p>"

OHKOing Golem and Rhydon and 2HKOing Exeggutor are feats few Pokemon can muster, but Blizzard allows Articuno to do just that. It can force switches and deal heavy damage throughout the match, softening up your opponent's team and possibly causing a freeze. It can even make for a very nice end-game sweeper by boosting its mediocre base 85 Speed with Agility and blasting away with its STAB Blizzard, potentially getting a freeze in the process.</p> <p>Why isn't Articuno more common, then? Again, its Speed stat is frustratingly low, as it is not able to outspeed Pokemon like Tauros and Alakazam without a boost, while both are capable of paralyzing Articuno. It is walled to kingdom come by the many OU Pokemon that resist Blizzard, namely Lapras, Starmie, Cloyster, and to an extent, Slowbro, as well as Chansey with its massive 250/105 Special bulk. Its movepool is shallow as well, as it leaves Articuno relying on mediocre Ice / Normal coverage, the latter of which runs off its so-so Attack stat. Other Ice-types such as Lapras and Cloyster are generally preferred, due to access to helpful moves such as Thunderbolt and Explosion respectively. However, they can never dream of matching the raw power of Articuno's Blizzard. All-in-all, if you are looking to unleash a nasty surprise on your opponent, don't overlook Articuno.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Articuno's barren yet focused movepool, there are very few other options it can run. Mimic is probably the best unlisted option, as if Articuno gets lucky enough to copy Thunderbolt from Starmie, it will always 2HKO back. Reflect is another option to help Articuno absorb Body Slam from Snorlax and even Rock Slide from Golem and Rhydon should it find itself paralyzed against them. It also helps Articuno win against Tauros, which needs Body Slam critical hits to win. However, it is typically only useful when your opponent's special walls are gone, as they don't care at all whether Reflect is up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although Articuno's Blizzard is a frosty nuke and no Pokemon enjoys a freeze, there are quite a few solid counters to it. Lapras and Cloyster are some of the best Articuno counters, as they 4x resist Blizzard and can wear it down with any of their attacks. Starmie has to worry about the freeze chance, but can otherwise shrug off all of Articuno's attacks with Recover and threaten it back with any attack of its choosing. Cloyster also 4x resists Blizzard and has a ton of physical bulk, allowing it to absorb any physical attacks that Articuno might be running, then threaten either Articuno or a switch-in with Clamp, Blizzard, or Explosion. Slowbro is also a decent Pokemon to send out against Articuno one-on-one because it can paralyze it with Thunder Wave, but switching in is not recommended because it takes about 50% from two Blizzards before it even has a chance to move.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey is as good a special wall as ever, shrugging off attacks with Soft-Boiled and firing back with Thunderbolt or Seismic Toss. It also takes 37.9 - 44.6% from Hyper Beam, so it has little hope in getting the chance to use Soft-Boiled if its health is low. Alakazam can also use Thunder Wave, Recover off any damage, and spam Psychic until Articuno eventually faints, but it is 3HKOed by Blizzard, meaning it needs to be weary of switching in if paralyzed or weakened.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Though they are far from solid defensive checks to Articuno, Zapdos and Jolteon naturally outspeed it and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, which makes them effective offensive options to take it down if no more defensive options are available.</p>",

It can also switch in on a predicted Earthquake from Snorlax or Tauros, dealing heavy damage with Blizzard and hopefully causing a freeze. Rhydon and Golem are a bit harder to switch in on, as Rock Slide will KO Articuno, but if you are fortunate enough to switch in on Earthquake, Blizzard will OHKO either. Double-Edge does chip damage to Lapras, who laughs at a 4x resisted Blizzard, as well as Starmie. Don't use Double-Edge against Chansey though, as it only does 5% more than Blizzard, causes recoil, and does not have a freeze chance. Don't use Agility until the late-game, when the remains of your opponent's team are within KO range. Finally, Hyper Beam is there to finish off weakened Chansey and Alakazam.</p> <p>Ice Beam is a viable alternative over Double-Edge for a 99.6% accurate STAB, but it is significantly weaker than Blizzard and further weakens Articuno against Lapras and Starmie. Rest is great for recovering from status, allowing Articuno to act as a status sponge throughout the battle until you need it again. Another interesting option Articuno has is Sky Attack, which is its most powerful physical attack, possessing a huge 210 Base Power after STAB. With a critical hit, it is guaranteed to OHKO Chansey and has a 52% chance to OHKO Starmie; without a critical hit, it has a 46% chance to OHKO Alakazam, who would normally be 3HKOed by Blizzard.

Rest could be a good idea to recover some HP, but similarly to Reflect and Light Screen, it's at the cost of a crucial move, and Zapdos will have little to no room to wake up, as it can't switch in against most attackers. A sleeping Zapdos is also a free opportunity for Mewtwo and Mew to switch in and set up, making it setup fodder for the most important sweepers of the tier. Thunder could be used, because its higher Base Power lets Zapdos KO Tauros after a Thunderbolt, and Thunder can KO Mewtwo with two consecutive critical hits. However, it's a very unreliable strategy due to Thunder's low accuracy. Flash is an option that annoys a lot of paralyzed threat, such as Mewtwo, Mew, and Chansey, and comes in handy once there's only one remaining Pokemon. However, its low accuracy and the lack of room on Zapdos's moveset makes it an unreliable choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Zapdos has no way to deal with Rhydon and Golem. Both can use Zapdos to either set up a Substitute or use Body Slam on the switch and try to paralyze it. While it's way more uncommon and it does not resist Drill Peck, Sandslash can also be an issue, as it can freely switch in on Zapdos's Electric-type moves and poses a threat if Zapdos is paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Not only is Zapdos unable to 3HKO Mewtwo even with a critical hit, but Mewtwo can also use Zapdos as setup fodder with Amnesia and threaten it with Psychic and Ice Beam. Zapdos is also very sensitive to Pokemon like Alakazam, Gengar, Jolteon, and Tauros, which can all threaten it severely with either paralysis or sleep. Mewtwo should take care however, as it cannot paralyze Zapdos with Thunderbolt, and once it is itself paralyzed, physical wallbreakers like Mew, Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon can take advantage of its reduced Speed to put it under pressure with Explosion, Self-Destruct, or Stomp. Paralysis also hinders Zapdos severely if it doesn't have Agility, as slower Pokemon like Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Chansey can threaten it far more easily.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks</strong>: While they can't switch in on Zapdos's STAB moves, Jynx and Cloyster both 2HKO Zapdos with STAB Blizzard and prevent it from switching in. However, they are both likely to use Rest once they have been weakened, so Zapdos can use this opportunity to switch in safely. Zapdos also fears Ice Beam from threats it is supposed to deal with, such as Chansey, Mewtwo, and Slowbro, which all deal massive damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can shrug off a lot of Zapdos's attacks thanks to its high Special Defense and Soft-Boiled and can cripple it with paralysis or sleep. However, it cannot infinitely switch into Zapdos's attacks due to Drill Peck's high damage output and critical hit chance.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Drill Peck are Zapdos's best STAB options, and they are difficult to switch into thanks to Zapdos's high Speed, granting it a good critical hit rate. In particular, Zapdos easily 2HKO Water-types like Slowbro and Starmie, and has a chance to OHKO Cloyster with Thunderbolt. It has a 54.5% chance to 2HKO non-Reflect Chansey with one critical hit Drill Peck and a solid chance to KO Exeggutor with a critical hit after slight chip damage. It also has a possible 3HKO against Mew and Snorlax, which becomes guaranteed if it critically hits one Thunderbolt. Thunder Wave is an excellent tool to hobble most threats, and lets Zapdos spam its STAB moves even more. Paralysis also provides excellent support to teammates such as Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax. Agility suppresses the Speed drop from paralysis and lets Zapdos outrun the entire metagame, including Mewtwo and Alakazam. Against a paralyzed threat like Mew and Mewtwo, Agility also reapplies paralysis's Speed drop, helping slow teammates like paralyzed Snorlax to menace them. Hyper Beam can be used instead to beat Chansey and Jynx that would like to force Zapdos out; Chansey is left in KO range of Hyper Beam after a critical hit Drill Peck, and Zapdos has a 88.89% chance to KO Jynx with Drill Peck followed by Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Zapdos is usually seen as a mid- to late-game wallbreaker thanks to its ability to spread paralysis against staples like Tauros, Chansey, and Mewtwo. Its high critical hit rate and high offensive stats also make Zapdos very good at pressuring paralyzed foes; for example, spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave on predicted switch-ins is especially useful against Chansey, as it is one of the most common switch-ins to Zapdos, but critical hits, full paralysis chances, and low damage output from Chansey grant Zapdos far more chances to win the duel. Moreover, typical status absorbers like Starmie and Chansey cannot handle Zapdos very well; thanks to its sheer power and STAB moves, it can take advantage of them as well as Rest users such as Slowbro. This is essential because Zapdos has no way to recover its HP, so each hit it takes is permanent. The pressure Zapdos puts on the enemy team thanks to its high damage output and ability to spread paralysis can force fairly predictable switch-ins like Rhydon, Golem, Snorlax, or a paralyzed Pokemon, which can be punished by teammates like Mewtwo, Exeggutor, Mew, and Tauros. Paralyzing Mewtwo with Thunder Wave can also be a strategy to break it when Zapdos is paired with physical wallbreakers like Mew, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Stomp Tauros. Gengar is a notable teammate, as it synergizes well with Zapdos; as a lead, Gengar can switch into Zapdos to scout moves from Tauros. Zapdos can then proceed to threaten it with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave. As a pair, they can also wall most Reflect + Swords Dance variants of Mew, as Gengar and Zapdos are respectively immune to Normal- and Ground-type attacks. With their respective immunities, Gengar and Zapdos can even play around Earthquake + Body Slam Mew to some degree, forcing it to predict correctly and threatening it with a status, whether it be Zapdos's paralysis or Gengar's sleep. Earthquake + Explosion Mew is hindered to an even more extreme degree, as it forces Mew to switch out or to try to trade with Explosion, allowing more space for powerful sweepers like Mewtwo and Mew.</p> <p>Zapdos can also be used as lead. Its Speed lets it outrun Jynx, while Thunder Wave and its STAB combination lets it threaten most common leads, including Chansey, Tauros, and Alakazam. It's important to notice that Drill Peck can never OHKO Jynx even with a critical hit, and that Gengar is a faster lead, meaning Zapdos can be put to sleep easily by these two threats via Lovely Kiss and Hypnosis, respectively. Hyper Beam is a good option for this set, as Drill Peck + Hyper Beam has a strong chance to KO Jynx, and a critical hit Drill Peck + Hyper Beam will always KO Chansey—both Jynx and Chansey are likely to stay in on Zapdos to put it to sleep.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Zapdos is without a doubt the best Electric-type in the metagame thanks to its high stats and two powerful moves in Thunderbolt and Drill Peck. It is an incredible late-game sweeper, being a mixed attacker on top of having access to Agility. However, Rhydon and Golem hinder Zapdos's effectiveness. While they do take slight chip damage from Drill Peck, they can't be hit by any of Zapdos's other moves and must be dealt with by the rest of the team. Due to this, Zapdos generally requires minor support to work effectively in all matchups, keeping it from being considered one of the best Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest is an option for Zapdos to get some HP back, but you'll rarely ever get the chance to use it. Generally, Zapdos should be attacking or use Thunder Wave anyway; there's not a lot of room to put it on the set, as you lose out on either a pivotal attack, the ability to consistently paralyze opposing Pokemon, or the ability to pull off a late-game sweep. Thunder is usable to OHKO Starmie and to 2HKO Tauros and Slowbro, but it is not as used due to its poor accuracy. Toxic is a nice option in order to pressure the Rock-types, but this is generally not worth using over other moves. Final options for Zapdos are Reflect and Light Screen. Generally you would choose one over the other and replace Agility. Having Reflect or Light Screen up mid-game can be incredibly useful; however, due to Zapdos's lack of recovery without Rest, which is already noted to be unreliable, this option is generally not favored. The combination of Rest and Reflect can also be good at letting Zapdos check the Rock-type Pokemon that it usually loses to, but it risks taking a potential critical hit from Rock Slide.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: The Ground-types of the metagame, Rhydon and Golem, are Zapdos's biggest threats to deal with. They soak up any attack Zapdos has to offer, which forces you to play around them before Zapdos can be effective. One can scout early-game for these Pokemon, but if you spend the whole game trying to play around them, you may find yourself in a pickle by late-game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Jolteon can also make good checks to Zapdos, although unlike the above Ground-types, they are susceptible to Thunder Wave. Jolteon would preferably use Rest to better check Zapdos, but ones without Rest work as well. Zapdos itself gets a special mention because it can come in on a Drill Peck to create an even matchup. Despite this, it is still worse than Jolteon as a check, as it is neutral to Thunderbolt damage which should be noted is unable to paralyze Electric-types making it a bit harder for Zapdos to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can act as a good check to Zapdos thanks to its high Special Defense and access to Reflect, but it is generally unfavorable as a check due to the tendency of Drill Peck landing a critical hit.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Drill Peck are Zapdos's STAB moves. Zapdos hits most targets for strong damage, comfortably 3HKOing Tauros and threatening 3HKOs on Snorlax and Alakazam. However, it should be noted that Thunderbolt cannot paralyze other Electric-types. Drill Peck hits two of the main Pokemon that tank Thunderbolt, Exeggutor and Chansey. Exeggutor is sometimes 2HKOed by Drill Peck, and while Chansey can take two Drill Pecks comfortably, it tends to lose to repeated Drill Pecks, as it can't hit Zapdos very hard, and a single critical hit or full paralysis tends to end the fight in Zapdos's favor. However, Chansey does have access to Reflect to increase its chances of winning the matchup. Thunder Wave is used to paralyze Pokemon such as Tauros and Chansey to give openings for Zapdos to sweep late-game or get a chance to prevent recovery to get an extra turn of damage. Agility can be used on a free turn to allow Zapdos to outspeed faster threats like Alakazam and Tauros. It can also be used to remove the Speed drop from paralysis, which can allow Zapdos to sweep through Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill it.</p> <p>In general, you want to keep Zapdos as healthy as possible throughout the match in order to give it sweeping potential. However, this doesn't mean that you should keep it in the back the whole game, as it has a lot of potential to be useful in the early- and mid-game stages. For example, Zapdos can take advantage of sleeping Pokemon such as Snorlax as long as it comes in on the turn the Pokemon uses Rest. One should try to use Zapdos to spread status through Thunder Wave. This is especially helpful to do on a Pokemon like Chansey, which can be prevented from recovering through status, allowing Zapdos to potentially 3HKO with Drill Peck. Early-game, be sure to scout for the Ground-types of the tier, Rhydon and Golem. Do this with Pokemon like Exeggutor, Tauros, Cloyster, and Lapras, which can pressure them through super effective or status moves. Tauros is probably the best example there, as it has a great matchup versus Exeggutor, Snorlax, Chansey, and Tauros, as well as being a great late-game cleaner on top of that. You could also lure them out with Zapdos itself, which can be done fairly early on, putting you at an information advantage. Whether or not you manage to find a Rock-type, though, you should keep Rock-type checks like Exeggutor and Lapras healthy so they better check them if they come out later in the match. Don't use Agility unless most Pokemon on the opposing team are weakened enough for Zapdos to sweep. To give a reference frame, you should probably wait until Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey have about a third of their health left. However, if they Rest, you can take advantage of them earlier.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Moltres stands out as the strongest special attacker in RBY OU, tied with Articuno. It shares a lot of strengths and weaknesses with the other legendary bird: Moltres can also 2HKO Tauros and threaten Snorlax significantly while nailing Exeggutor and having Agility to clean up late-game. However, it too has a hard time breaking through very common special walls such as Starmie and Chansey, which holds it back tremendously. Should these walls be incapacitated or removed, Moltres can wreak havoc and make great use of its titanic Special stat.</p> <p>Due to these shared traits with Articuno, it is worth analyzing where they differ to understand which fits your team best. Moltres has access to Fire Spin in tandem with higher Attack, giving it a stronger Hyper Beam. These two qualities allow Moltres to muscle through checks like Starmie and Chansey more effectively than Articuno, especially when these Pokemon have been paralyzed and chipped beforehand. Moltres also possesses no hard walls: while Articuno really struggles against Lapras and Cloyster, there aren't any Pokemon that shut down Moltres quite so hard. However, Moltres's lower physical bulk and a weakness to Ice make it considerably easier to take down. Additionally, the type chart is unkind to Fire-type attacks in RBY, making Moltres considerably weaker in various matchups compared to Articuno, such as Zapdos and especially Rhydon. Furthermore, Fire Spin's accuracy makes it very unreliable; Fire Blast also suffers from this problem to a lesser degree. Overall, Moltres is a phenomenal late-game threat, despite being niche overall, as the ability to beat Tauros one-on-one is of crucial importance; while supporting it can be difficult, this Pokemon remains a sweeping threat that can tear down passive builds.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moltres possesses a few other viable moves, but they are all hard to justify in most cases. Double-Edge gives it a strong move to hit Chansey on the switch, and to a lesser extent Starmie, which might make its job of taking down these checks a little easier, though you will usually be content to source your extra damage from an additional Fire Spin. Sky Attack hits for over 50% on both Starmie and Chansey, threatening to OHKO on a critical hit, but it requires good prediction to get away with the charge turn. Toxic allows Moltres to functionally empower its own Fire Spin without needing to land a Fire Blast burn, which helps with working around Chansey as long as Moltres can chain enough Fire Spins without missing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Starmie and Slowbro stop Moltres dead in its tracks thanks to their great special bulk and lack of concern for burns, which allows them to switch into Fire Blast frequently. Starmie is particularly brutal, being faster and threatening hefty damage with any of Blizzard, Thunderbolt, or Surf, or even paralysis from Thunder Wave. Slowbro can use Moltres as setup fodder after paralyzing it, usually forcing it to try and pivot out with Fire Spin as to not give it a free Amnesia boost, though it needs to be wary when burned, as Fire Spin chains can rapidly rack up sufficient residual damage for Moltres to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can put a hard stop to Moltres thanks to its gargantuan Special bulk; however, Moltres outspeeds it and can therefore stop it from recovering with Fire Spin. Therefore, it can muscle through Chansey with some luck, especially with a Fire Blast burn alongside Fire Spin, as Hyper Beam hits for over 40%. However, this can be quite risky for Moltres, as a miss lets Chansey cripple its late-game with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: While neither is particularly willing to take a Fire Blast, both Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed Moltres while 2HKOing it with STAB Thunderbolt. However, Moltres can beat a chipped or resting Jolteon, having a good shot at 2HKOing it with Fire Blast + Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While it looks enticing to switch Rhydon in on Fire Blast, its pathetic Special makes it take surprisingly high damage; there is even a chance of a 3HKO. Additionally, being burned is an utter death sentence for Rhydon, making it little more than fodder in the long run. However, Rhydon is otherwise one of the better Moltres checks, absorbing Hyper Beam well and PP stalling Fire Spin better than most OU staples, all while having an OHKO against it in Rock Slide; if it drops Rock Slide in favor of Rest, it gives up the OHKO, but it gains the ability to heal off the burns and can stall Moltres out of Fire Blasts, which is just as good.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fire Blast is the main draw to Moltres. It threatens significant damage to a majority of the tier, including notable 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Cloyster, and has a nice 30.1% burn chance that forces sturdier physical attackers such as Snorlax and Rhydon to tread very carefully around Moltres. However, much like most special attackers in RBY OU, it must contend with the existence of Chansey and Starmie. These two Pokemon can comfortably heal off all damage taken by Fire Blast, and due to Fire Blast only having 8 PP, Moltres usually doesn't want to waste any on Pokemon that can just shrug it off; furthermore, landing a burn on these Pokemon can sometimes be counterproductive, as it removes the option of paralyzing them. Moltres packs a relatively powerful Hyper Beam to help it deal with special walls, thankfully; in tandem with a Fire Blast, it can hit both Chansey and Starmie for over 60% of their HP over two turns, meaning that, if such walls have been weakened, it stands a good chance of finishing the job. Agility is extremely helpful to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis and gain the upper hand on other fast late-game Pokemon such as Tauros and Zapdos; it is especially powerful in combination with Fire Spin, as a fast partial trapping move completely shuts down the opponent's ability to attack as long as it doesn't miss. Fire Spin excels when the opposition has been statused; it has great synergy with paralysis, which enables Moltres to move faster than any foe even without setting up Agility, and with burn, as repeatedly stopping the foe from moving racks up burn damage.</p> <p>Moltres's specialty is cleanup. If you are running Moltres, you ought to spend the early-game trying to cripple, chip, and potentially even remove the opposing Chansey and Starmie. Moltres is very unconventional in that it doesn't synergize particularly well with the two most powerful statuses in RBY, freeze and sleep. Fire Blast will thaw frozen opponents, and Fire Spin provides sleeping enemies with opportunities to wake while only taking minimal damage per turn. This means Moltres needs a very deliberate plan early-game and beyond to weaken checks and make your opponent play into your hand, especially against Starmie. Many teams are willing to let Starmie absorb sleep early-game, which is great for other Pokemon that struggle with it, like Articuno and Slowbro, but Moltres's resisted Fire Spin is the perfect opportunity for Starmie to burn sleep turns. You might want to try luring your opponent into letting you sleep a different Pokemon, even forgoing sleep altogether if you are feeling creative, or hoping sleeping Starmie falls victim to players' willingness to sacrifice sleeping Pokemon. Similarly, it won't be much use gambling your early-game trying to freeze a Chansey.</p>"

Dragonair's unique mono-Dragon typing gives it useful resistances to Water- and Electric-type attacks. However, Dragonair's base stats are atrocious; it barely threatens anything offensively and is 2HKOed or 3HKOed by most neutral hits. Its weakness to Ice-type attacks also exacerbates Wrap teams' weaknesses to Ice-type attacks even further.

Blizzard is Dragonair's most versatile coverage move; it hits Flying- and Grass-types such as Zapdos and Exeggutor for super effective damage, as well as 2HKOing Rhydon. Blizzard is also Dragonair's best option to finish off weakened foes. Thunderbolt is Dragonair's strongest move against Water-types, 3HKOing Cloyster and Starmie. Hyper Beam allows Dragonair to meaningfully threaten and finish off physically frailer foes such Chansey and Alakazam, doing 37.4% minimum to the former and 48.2% minimum to the latter. Agility can be used in favor of a secondary coverage move, as it allows Dragonair to spread chip and paralysis across the opposing team and not just become a useless sacrifice after it becomes paralyzed. Dragonair can also use Agility against foes that do not carry paralysis-afflicting moves, such as Rhydon.</p> <p>Dragonair wants to be used early-game to get paralysis off on faster threats as soon as possible, as the Wrap teams it fits on live and die by their ability to paralyze these foes.

      "overview": "<p>Everyone knows Dragonite’s claim to fame. While a wide move pool, a base stat total bested only by that of Mewtwo, and a unique Dragon typing are all distinguishing features, Dragonite’s true niche rests in its access to Wrap. With an unparalleled Attack stat and two excellent speed control options in Thunder Wave and Agility, Dragonite can immobilize and whittle away at its foes. In Ubers, Dragonite is much the same frustrating but effective Pokemon it is in other tiers.</p> <p>Dragonite is a powerful pivot and potential sweeper with a lot of utility options. It can meticulously prepare favorable endgames against paralyzed and slow teams for its teammates to sweep, or it can even painfully choke out entire teams itself. A wide pool of coverage moves makes Dragonite unpredictable and quite difficult to wall. Its Flying typing is also quite nice for slowing down Earthquake users, most notably Mew. It’s not terribly uncommon for Mew to run Earthquake as its only reliable attacking move, meaning that Dragonite can wall some variants indefinitely.</p> <p>Despite many positive traits, Dragonite has many limitations that keep it from dominating the tier. For starters, Dragonite relies heavily on paralysis to function. If Dragonite is slower than its foe, it cannot use Wrap safely. It is very vulnerable to paralysis itself, as it becomes incapable of using Wrap effectively or reliably given its already imperfect accuracy. Its typing, while useful for some matchups, also means that Ice-type moves from common Pokemon like Mewtwo are a terror. Thus, Dragonite requires strategic play to position such that it can actually make its way through teams with little risk. Another obvious issue is its reliance on Wrap, which, even in the best of circumstances, can miss and immediately result in Dragonite failing to pivot or sweep.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonite has a lot of interesting moves that it can try, but few are practical and better than what can be found in the main set. Thunderbolt is likely Dragonite’s next best move, as it gives it a very strong option against Slowbro, Starmie, and Cloyster. Dragonite is not extremely likely to face these Pokemon, so Thunderbolt has fairly limited utility. Thunderbolt generally needs to be used alongside Blizzard so Dragonite will not struggle with Exeggutor or Ground-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Fire Blast is a novel option primarily because of its ability to burn foes. In addition to cutting the Attack stat of a Pokemon, the extra damage from burn synergizes well with Wrap. Notably, a burned Gengar can no longer stall out Dragonite's Wrap, as the damage will eventually cause it to faint, even though Wrap itself is doing no damage. The move is often outclassed by Blizzard, which hits a better array of targets and has a higher accuracy.</p> <p>Double-Edge can be an alternative to Hyper Beam that trades the higher Base Power for greater accuracy, more PP, and no risky recharge turn. The move is rather uncommon, as the drop in power is very noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Using Ice-type moves, Mewtwo, Starmie, Jynx, Lapras, Cloyster, and Articuno all have at least a chance to OHKO Dragonite outright. Aside from Lapras and Cloyster, they are all faster than Dragonite, meaning Dragonite cannot safely use Wrap against most users of Ice-type moves. Other Pokemon like Tauros, Chansey, and occasionally Snorlax can all 2HKO Dragonite with their common Ice-type moves as well. Tauros is particularly dangerous, as a critical hit will take Dragonite out immediately.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis often hampers Dragonite, as it heavily drops the consistency of Wrap. Faster users of Thunder Wave, such as Alakazam, Starmie, Mew, Zapdos, and Jolteon can all immediately threaten Dragonite. Other users of paralysis moves, like Chansey, Slowbro, and Exeggutor can all also heavily punish Dragonite on a switch or if Wrap misses. Users of Body Slam, especially fast ones, can also threaten Dragonite in a pinch.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Wrap</strong>: Gengar will generally beat Dragonite in a straight head-to-head, especially if Dragonite does not have Blizzard. Furthermore, Gengar is quite good at getting Dragonite to waste Wrap PP due to its immunity to its damage. While Surf and, to a lesser extent, Blizzard can threaten Rhydon and Golem, their resistance to Wrap can help them stall out Wrap PP as well. Both can also switch into Hyper Beam to punish it.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Wrap is Dragonite’s most important move, giving it the ability to both pivot and sweep. Wrap enables it to pressure slower foes like Chansey, Snorlax, and paralyzed Pokemon with chip damage and then switch out to a potent partner, such as Tauros, Rhydon, or Zapdos to finish the job without either Pokemon taking damage in the process. In general, Dragonite thrives on paralysis support and loathes being paralyzed. As such, Dragonite tends to favor the late-game, steadily mounting damage after paralysis has been spread or faster Pokemon have been knocked out.</p> <p>Teammates can spread paralysis for Dragonite, but Dragonite can also be quite good at spreading paralysis itself with Thunder Wave. Because Dragonite can theoretically use Agility at any time to set up for a sweep, few Pokemon will feel comfortable switching out against it and will often try to attack it first, even if a different move or switch seems likely. Additionally, trying to block paralysis by switching in an already paralyzed Pokemon is largely ineffective, as Dragonite can simply use Wrap with little risk. In most cases, Dragonite will aim to paralyze Pokemon that are quick and threatening but can’t consistently paralyze or KO it in return. This includes Pokemon like Tauros and certain variants of Mew and Mewtwo. This creates a stronger position for both Dragonite and offensive teammates. While Dragonite must avoid paralysis to use Wrap consistently, it may occasionally risk trading paralysis with high value targets that may otherwise be dangerous in the endgame, such as Mew, Zapdos, and Alakazam, if it must. Moreover, Dragonite will be more willing to accept paralysis if the opposing Mew only has Earthquake as an attacking move, as Dragonite will still be able to fill an important role in checking it even after being slowed down.</p> <p>Using Agility allows Dragonite to become a powerful sweeper capable of outspeeding the entire metagame. With Wrap and strong attacks, a Dragonite can wipe out fairly healthy teams by itself after using Agility. Agility can also reverse the Speed-dropping effects of paralysis, but the 25% chance of immobilization is still very problematic if Dragonite plans on using Wrap at any point. The challenge with Agility, aside from Wrap misses, is finding an opportunity to use it safely. Dragonite can’t comfortably set up on many common Pokemon in Ubers, as almost all of them have at least a chance to paralyze or KO it. This means Dragonite will most often be clicking Agility when risking a critical hit or paralysis chance from Body Slam is worth it, when the opponent is expected to switch out, or when the opposing Pokemon is asleep or frozen. Agility can be used with or without Thunder Wave; while Agility Dragonite does appreciate access to two attacking moves, the utility of Thunder Wave, sometimes even after Agility has been used, is too much to give up. While Agility is generally considered as an option to strengthen Wrap, it can instead occasionally be used to strengthen Thunder Wave when spreading paralysis is more important than chip damage or pivoting. This is most applicable if Dragonite is expected to check Earthquake Mew. While Dragonite will likely take a Thunder Wave in this scenario, it may be able to paralyze Mew and threaten the Pokemon that will switch in after. Agility can be used safely against Mew to give itself the Speed advantage against dangerous Pokemon looking to switch in, such as Tauros, Mewtwo, Rhydon, and Golem.</p> <p>Dragonite can round out its set with one or two of the many strong and diverse attacks in its arsenal. Surf has decent base power, hits every Pokemon in the game, and has a fair amount of PP, making it one of the safest choices for Dragonite. Surf also instantly takes out Rhydon and Golem, which otherwise take only a little damage from Wrap and can potentially PP stall it. Blizzard hits a bit harder than Surf but is less reliable. It is notably Dragonite’s strongest move against Exeggutor and Gengar, the latter of which can be quite difficult for Dragonite to handle given it takes no damage from Wrap at all. Hyper Beam is Dragonite’s strongest move and thus an excellent choice for finishing off foes. As with Blizzard though, Hyper Beam is not overly reliable, and it can also land Dragonite in a bad situation if it fails to KO. Body Slam is a reliable and fairly strong move with a good chance to paralyze foes, making it an excellent option to punish switches. It is, however, not the best for finishing Pokemon off during a sweep and it doesn’t help much against Rhydon, Golem, and most notably Gengar. This means pairing Body Slam with Hyper Beam is generally not viable.</p> <p>Dragonite teams well with Pokemon that can spread paralysis effectively, such as Slowbro and Thunder Wave Mew. The strong offensive capabilities and boosting moves of these Pokemon can make blocking paralysis quite difficult. Thunder Wave Mewtwo can accomplish this as well, though the opportunity cost of running that set is often higher. Because Dragonite and its common teammates tend to spread paralysis well, offensive Pokemon tend to be good team options. Slow Pokemon like Rhydon and Golem appreciate gaining a Speed advantage after paralysis. Tauros becomes a lot more threatening after its teammates spread paralysis because the free turns from full paralysis can often allow Tauros to break through powerful foes like Mew and Mewtwo. Tauros can attempt to capitalize even further with Stomp. Paralysis and chip damage from Wrap can also do a lot to support Mew and Mewtwo. Pokemon like Mewtwo and Chansey become significantly less capable of switching into a boosted Mewtwo if they are paralyzed and have sustained some Wrap damage.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Dragonite is one of the most well-known Pokemon in RBY OU, thanks to its access to Wrap, which gives Dragonite a niche in OU as a mid-game wallbreaker and pivot as well as a late-game cleaner. As a sweeper, Dragonite wears down opposing Pokemon with Wrap then finishes them off with a strong attack, such as Hyper Beam or Blizzard. Its high attacking stats and wide movepool provide plenty of offensive power, more than making up for its lack of good STAB moves. Wrap also makes Dragonite an excellent pivot. If Dragonite uses Wrap on a Pokemon then switches out, the opposing Pokemon won't be able to attack on the turn Dragonite switches, allowing teammates such as Tauros to switch in for free. Dragonite's base 80 Speed, in combination with Wrap, allows it to shut down metagame staples such as Chansey, Snorlax, and Exeggutor. Although a good potion of the tier still outspeeds Dragonite, this can be remedied by Dragonite's two forms of speed control: Agility and Thunder Wave. Agility makes Dragonite faster than every unboosted Pokemon, allowing it to chain together Wraps until it runs out of PP or misses. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, can allow Dragonite to threaten faster Pokemon, such as Tauros, Alakazam, and Starmie, with paralysis, crippling them for the rest of the game. Dragonite is great at forcing paralysis onto foes that run away from other Thunder Wave users, since they might stay in and attack Dragonite in fear of Agility. Dragonite is not frail either; even with a 4x weakness to Ice, it survives Tauros's Blizzard, even having the chance to survive it after taking Body Slam. Dragonite also has a 61.5% chance to survive Starmie's Blizzard. Dragonite's typing also gives it a nice immunity to Ground, letting it switch into Rhydon and scaring it with Blizzard.</p> <p>Despite these positive traits, Dragonite is held back by a mediocre typing and inconsistency. Dragonite's typing makes it 4x weak to Ice-type moves, which are everywhere in OU. Dragonite is also deathly afraid of paralysis, since it prevents Dragonite from outspeeding naturally slower Pokemon while also decreasing Wrap’s already mediocre accuracy. This forces Dragonite to run away from Body Slam, a move that it would otherwise be able to take thanks to its high bulk. These traits mean Dragonite has a lot of trouble getting on the field, let alone trying to find a free turn to set up. Likewise, Wrap only has 84.4% accuracy, and a miss leaves it open to a potential Thunder Wave or Blizzard. Although Dragonite is fast relative to the OU tier, Jynx and Starmie outspeed it and OHKO it with Blizzard, though the latter is not guaranteed. Offensively, although Dragonite is strong, the lack of a STAB move means Dragonite can't use its high attacking stats to its fullest potential. Due to these flaws, Dragonite requires heavy team support in order to take advantage of the offensive traits it offers. Additionally, since Wrap is a very weak move, it is the perfect move for sleeping Pokemon such as Alakazam and Starmie to burn sleep turns on.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Although Dragonite has a wide variety of options, almost all of them are hard to fit on a set, as Wrap and a speed control move are undroppable, while Hyper Beam and Blizzard are both powerful options. Despite this, Surf can be used over Blizzard to guarantee a KO on Rhydon and Golem from full health. However, this will require patience before revealing Dragonite's moves. All other options apart from Surf are either sacrificing the power of Hyper Beam or the anti-Ground-type coverage of Blizzard, so they should be treated more carefully. Thunderbolt can be used in order to do increased damage on Cloyster, Slowbro, Lapras, and Starmie. Body Slam can be used over Hyper Beam to deal damage on opposing Pokemon while also threatening paralysis, as well as not requiring Dragonite to recharge if it fails to KO them, and Fire Blast can be used to burn opposing Pokemon, most notably Gengar, in order to put them on a timer with Wrap.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>PP Stalling:</strong> Once Dragonite sets up Agility, the primary way to deal with it is PP stalling. Wrap's 32 PP, can easily be stalled out by constant switching, and once Dragonite runs out of Wrap PP it becomes much less threatening. Wrap-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Gengar, Rhydon, and Golem, as well as physically bulky Pokemon such as Cloyster and Slowbro, should be accounted for because of this. Gengar is particularly pressing due to it taking minimal damage from any of Dragonite's coverage moves, forcing Dragonite out immediately. However, Gengar remains immobilized from Wrap, giving partners that can contest it, such as Tauros or Alakazam, a safe switch in. When PP stalling, it is very important for the opponent to count how many times Dragonite has used Wrap. If Dragonite uses its final Wrap, and the opponent switches out their Pokemon while it is still locked into Wrap, then Dragonite will be forced to use Wrap again, causing its PP to underflow to 63, making it near impossible to stall it out at that point. Once Dragonite uses its final Wrap, the opponent must make sure their Pokemon stays in until it is completed.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis:</strong> Paralysis is essentially a death sentence for Dragonite. If it's not running Agility, it no longer outspeeds Pokemon such as Cloyster, Lapras, and Chansey. Although Agility will allow Dragonite to ignore its Speed drop, Wrap's accuracy will be an effective 63.6% after accounting for full paralysis, making the strategy even more inconsistent than it already is. This means Thunder Wave users such as Alakazam and Starmie, Body Slam users such as Tauros and Snorlax, and Stun Spore Exeggutor are all able to force out Dragonite.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon:</strong> Every viable Pokemon faster than Dragonite except Persian can either threaten it with status, such as Alakazam and Jolteon, or with Ice-type moves, such as Jynx and Articuno. Some Pokemon such as Tauros and Starmie threaten Dragonite with both. In addition, since Dragonite will attack second against these Pokemon, they will always be able to get off an attack before Dragonite can use Wrap, meaning Dragonite has to either paralyze these faster threats or use Agility to outspeed them.</p> <p><strong>Ice-Type Attacks:</strong> Since Dragonite is 4x weak to Ice, most Pokemon with Ice-type attacks force it out. However, Dragonite can use Wrap on slower Pokemon such as Cloyster and Lapras to safely switch to something that can deal with them. Additionally, Dragonite is capable of taking a non-STAB Ice-type move from Pokemon like Tauros and Chansey to set up Agility, so it is important for the opposing team to damage it beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types:</strong> Because of their strong physical bulk, Cloyster, Lapras, and Slowbro are capable of staying in against non-Thunderbolt Dragonite to fish for Blizzard or, in Slowbro's case, Thunder Wave during a Wrap sequence, usually forcing it out. However, what they force in, such as Starmie and Zapdos, can often put severe pressure on them thereafter.</p> <p><strong>Burn and Poison:</strong> Although both of these status effects are rare in OU, they severely cripple Dragonite. The passive damage from these status effects puts Dragonite's Wrap chain on a timer. A burn is especially detrimental, since it halves the damage from Wrap and Hyper Beam, and it can often be inflicted when Dragonite attempts to switch into Pokemon like Moltres.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Wrap": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Wrap is mandatory on Dragonite, as it lets Dragonite pivot against foes as well as tear down weakened and paralyzed teams. Hyper Beam is Dragonite's strongest move, dealing a minimum of 51.4% to Chansey and a minimum of 45.5% to Starmie. If the opposing Pokemon is out of Hyper Beam's KO range, Dragonite can chip its HP with Wrap in order to get it to the desired HP. Blizzard is used for dealing with Rhydon and the rare Golem, which resist Wrap and Hyper Beam, while also helping against Gengar, Zapdos, and Exeggutor. Since Wrap relies heavily on Dragonite outspeeding its foe, the fourth move is a form of speed control, either Thunder Wave or Agility.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is used to incapacitate foes with paralysis, making it easier for Dragonite and its teammates to break through the opposing team. What makes Dragonite unique compared to other Thunder Wave users is that the threat of Agility generally forces a foe to stay in and attack it, giving Dragonite an opportunity to crucially paralyze a foe that would run away from other Thunder Wave users, such as Tauros and Starmie. However, this exchange typically means Dragonite either trades paralysis with a foe or loses a significant chunk of its HP, although trading damage on Dragonite for paralysis on Tauros is almost always a favorable trade.</p> <p>Agility is Dragonite's less commonly used option. If Dragonite finds a chance to switch in on a Pokemon that has used Rest, it can find the free turn necessary to set up Agility and proceed to chain together Wraps. Although this sequence is hard to stop once started, it is not unstoppable. Wrap only has 32 PP, and constant switching will drain it quickly. In addition, physically bulky Pokemon such as Cloyster and Lapras can stay in on Dragonite and wait for Wrap to miss before OHKOing with Blizzard. Dragonite also has to make sure Gengar is accounted for before attempting a sweep, since Gengar is immune to Wrap, although it is still immobilized, so you can safely switch to something else that forces it out.</p> <p>Due to the abundance of Ice-type moves and paralysis-inducing moves in RBY, Dragonite struggles to find opportunities to get in safely. As mentioned before, this is typically done against a Pokemon that has used Rest or with an aggressive prediction. Alternatively, you can utilize other partial-trapping moves to get Dragonite in safely. This makes Pokemon such as Victreebel and Cloyster good teammates. Victreebel can also force out Reflect Snorlax, which could otherwise stay in and stall out Dragonite's Wrap PP. In addition to partial trapping support, Cloyster has a 4x resistance to Ice and an immunity to freezing, meaning it complements Dragonite defensively quite well. Starmie and Chansey can also switch into Ice-type moves from opposing Starmie, Chansey, Jynx, and Articuno, as well as providing Dragonite with paralysis support, which it greatly appreciates to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon. Alakazam, Zapdos, and Jolteon also provide paralysis support to Dragonite as well being good teamamtes for it to pivot to. Alakazam also has a great matchup against Gengar, one of Dragonite's hardest counters.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Feast your eyes on the most destructive Pokemon in any tier in history. Not one stat Mewtwo has can be called bad or even average, including the highest Special in the game and a tie with Aerodactyl and Jolteon for second-highest Speed. It's not just an offensive juggernaut: Mewtwo's bulk is absolutely titanic, stomaching even blows from the mighty Snorlax and Tauros. Its Psychic typing comes into this as well, giving it effectively no type-based weaknesses to exploit. Because of these qualities, taking Mewtwo down often requires a concentrated effort from multiple Pokemon. As if that wasn't enough, it has a plethora of fantastic moves, such as Amnesia, Recover, STAB Psychic, Self-Destruct, and more. If given even a single turn of breathing room, Mewtwo can immediately take over a game. There is no true way to defeat Mewtwo head-on other than sending in your own, statusing it, or getting plain lucky. Thus, many RBY Ubers games are decided by a Mewtwo mirror match. Mewtwo was designed to be the world's strongest Pokemon, and Game Freak certainly succeeded: Mewtwo has zero inarguable flaws and is an automatic pick on any RBY Ubers team that aims to win.</p> <p>Mewtwo's only arguable flaws stem from it being quite literally too powerful for a Game Boy to process. A maximum DV and EV Mewtwo can end up overflowing its Special if it's boosted to +4 or higher and subsequently sustains a Special drop, minimizing its Special and leaving it effortless to KO. Similarly, Mewtwo's Speed gives it a very high critical hit rate—25.39%—which, combined with the fact that critical hits ignore the attacker's offensive boosts, means that +3 or higher Mewtwo will sometimes deal less damage than expected. Finally, while Mewtwo is incredible, it will always have some check it has trouble beating outside of brute force, as it often only has two moveslots available after Amnesia and Recover. However, brute force remains a fine option in a tight spot because Mewtwo is an utter juggernaut.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>To prevent Mewtwo's Special from overflowing, 8 EVs and 13 DVs in Special can make the stat 341 on any given Mewtwo set, which amounts to 1023 at +4, albeit capped at 999 in practice. This is known as the \"SafeTwo\" spread, pioneered by Enigami. Doing this, however, severely cuts into Mewtwo's bulk, making critical hits from special attacks deal noticeably higher damage. Thus, using this spread depends on whether your Mewtwo set aims for short-term reward or maximum mileage throughout a game.</p> <p>If a move is good in RBY, there is a good chance that Mewtwo learns it. Customizing Mewtwo usually consists of patching up offensive holes in a team while ensuring it doesn't leave itself open to its checks; in other words, without compromising its power level or making it more situational. Generally, Mewtwo's only free moveslot is one of its two attacking ones, as Amnesia and Recover are pivotal to its success.</p> <p>Rest is an interesting choice over Recover, especially on Barrier + Amnesia sets, which generally aim to last as long as possible, as it stalls for three turns at the cost of 1 PP, effectively amounting to 48 PP. It also comes with erasing the Speed drop from paralysis when switching out, though this can make Mewtwo somewhat difficult to wake up later if it hasn't woken up prior to switching; this is because Mewtwo regularly attracts self-KO move users like Snorlax and Golem, which it can't contest when asleep. Even worse, Swords Dance Mew can often set up and break through Mewtwo right away if not chipped or paralyzed, so it's recommended to incapacitate it with a teammate first. Rest also notably removes Mewtwo's paralysis, and paralysis arguably helps with PP stalling more, as it ensures it doesn't remain passive for extended periods of time.</p> <p>Mewtwo can potentially make use of the strong elemental attacks of RBY—Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Thunder—but they come with significant PP issues. Mewtwo mirrors often result in both losing a very large amount of PP, and putting your own at such a deficit right away frequently results in a loss. Additionally, each comes with its own disadvantage from a status perspective: Fire Blast's burn chance means it can thaw frozen Pokemon, while Blizzard and Thunder have less overall chance to inflict status because of their lower PP. Because Mewtwo often needs the superior status chances, the increased damage output is often just not worth it. This is to say nothing of the accuracy issues, which decrease the consistency of the one Pokemon that you can't afford to be inconsistent. However, the increased damage still leaves them situationally acceptable on teams able to PP stall Mewtwo without using their own Mewtwo; for example, +2 Blizzard or Fire Blast can OHKO Exeggutor, and an unboosted Thunder KOes Cloyster with even minor chip damage.</p> <p>Mewtwo's Attack is very usable, which makes Body Slam and Hyper Beam seem enticing. Body Slam can allow Mewtwo to spread paralysis while dealing physical damage, but compared to everything else Mewtwo can dish out, it's generally unimpressive. Hyper Beam is particularly interesting, as Mewtwo can then KO Chansey from a minimum of 44.6%. Against Mewtwo, a critical hit deals slightly more damage than Self-Destruct. Thus, it can be used as a substitute for BooM2 sets to try and get opposing Mewtwo in range for a critical hit or regular Hyper Beam instead of Self-Destruct. However, against any non-Psychic resistant Pokemon, including Chansey, the damage dealt is almost the same as +4 Psychic. Further, Psychic comes with the bonuses of not requiring a recharge, Special drops to further increase damage, and more attacking PP. Ergo, the only non-opposing Mewtwo reason to use Hyper Beam is for a better Light Screen Chansey matchup, which, while common, isn't omnipresent. If you're looking for a physical option, Submission is often the superior choice for hitting Chansey harder than Hyper Beam and having a significant PP advantage for Mewtwo.</p> <p>Mewtwo has fantastic physical bulk, making Counter appear viable. However, Counter is often best placed on Chansey, a Pokemon with higher potential damage that often draws physical attackers like Snorlax in more consistently. Mewtwo has little opportunity to use the attack, as it's often faced with opposing Mewtwo or Chansey before it even gets the chance to use it. Ergo, should these matchups come down to PP stalling, there is a very high chance that Counter will be revealed by force, ruining the gimmick entirely.</p> <p>BooM2 sets can arguably run Seismic Toss to make KOing opposing Mewtwo with Self-Destruct easier, making it a much more effective lure. However, fitting this into the set is extremely difficult and worsens its matchups against essentially anything other than Mewtwo, which it can't often afford. It's also possible to drop Amnesia entirely on these types of sets to add more coverage options or secure a slot for Recover, but this has seen little success.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo is arguably the best check to itself. The combination of Amnesia and Recover means your standard Amnesia set has a lot of trouble breaking through, requiring three critical hits in a row with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam to get the KO. Using Self-Destruct is one way to attempt to break through an opposing Mewtwo, but this requires sacrificing your own, and even then you only OHKO with a critical hit. This means even using Self-Destruct requires you to have the team support and setup necessary to finish Mewtwo off. Another option is having enough PP to successfully stall Mewtwo out; Submission is a great way to accomplish this, thanks to the 48 PP it offers. However, it oftentimes simply comes down to which Mewtwo will be frozen first, as getting a freeze often leaves nothing left to handle a boosted Mewtwo.</p> <p><strong>Freezing</strong>: Thanks to freeze being the virtual equivalent of a KO, freezing Mewtwo is often the best way to deal with it. Common Pokemon like Jynx, Starmie, Slowbro, and Chansey run Ice Beam or Blizzard, which both carry a 10.1% freeze chance. Additionally, these Pokemon are typically able to take a hit from even a boosted Mewtwo, meaning every turn spent against them carries a degree of risk. Managing to freeze the opponent's Mewtwo is a way to gain massive momentum, freeing up your own Mewtwo or Slowbro to wreak havoc with their biggest check out of the way.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen Chansey</strong>: As a testament to just how powerful Mewtwo is, the phenomenal special wall Chansey must run Light Screen to truly be a check. However, it's one of the most consistent Mewtwo checks in the game. A Mewtwo boosted to the 999 cap only possesses a 17.4% chance to 4HKO with Psychic through Light Screen. With Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, it's only a possible 6HKO. Chansey is one of the most consistent methods of overflowing a +6 Mewtwo's Special as well, using Psychic's Special drop chance and subsequently forcing a switch. Additionally, Chansey often has a significant PP advantage. This means Chansey can wall Mewtwo and force it to burn precious PP while healing off the damage it deals. However, even Chansey isn't safe. Psychic's 33.2% Special drop can degrade Light Screen and make Chansey much more vulnerable, making it arguably a temporary solution. Submission also 2HKOes it 86.7% of the time, making for a great anti-Chansey measure. Chansey is also a magnet for freeze attempts, which can be either a sigh of relief for your own Mewtwo or a catastrophic situation depending on your team's defensive integrity and Mewtwo set.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew has some interesting tricks that can allow it to check, set up on, or otherwise handle Mewtwo. With paralysis support and Swords Dance, it can set up to +4 Attack and then 2HKO with Earthquake while virtually never being 3HKOed in return by 999 Special Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. At +6, Mew is capable of OHKOing Mewtwo with Hyper Beam. Alternatively, some Mew variants simply opt to use Swords Dance and then Explosion to erase Mewtwo from the battle without any doubt. Defensively, Mew can use Transform to copy Mewtwo's stats and moves. Transform leaves Mew vulnerable for a turn, but the player gains crucial information about the opposing Mewtwo's set, walls it completely, and gains 5 PP for each move it holds. This 5 PP resets each time Mew uses Transform, meaning it is able to PP stall the opposing Mewtwo. It's not like Transform Mew only has the opposing Mewtwo's attacks either, as it can run other options to cripple it prior. These include Thunder Wave, Explosion to take a big chunk out of its health, Reflect to increase defensive integrity while transformed, and Soft-Boiled to stay healthy. Unless Mewtwo lands multiple critical hits or inflicts status, Mew is able to come in and check it somewhat consistently. However, Mew is far from an ironclad Mewtwo check; without paralysis support, Mewtwo is able to muscle through Mew on most occasions through brute force, as well as often ruining it completely with an untimely freeze.</p> <p><strong>PP Stall</strong>: Stalling Mewtwo out of PP is another way to deal with it, usually attempted with your own Mewtwo or Light Screen Chansey. Once it runs out of attacking PP, it's little more than a status absorber. However, accomplishing this is much easier said than done. With its monstrous Special, critical hit rate, and coverage, PP stall can sometimes be in vain, as crucial team members can fall to a freeze or massive damage. If Mewtwo lacks Thunderbolt, Slowbro is able to stand in its way, stalling PP while setting up its own brutal sweep. Thanks to its own Amnesia and Rest, Slowbro has a good chance to win one-on-one as well.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralyzing Mewtwo can open opportunities for powerful Pokemon such as Snorlax, Tauros, Mew, Golem, and Rhydon. Getting in on a paralyzed Mewtwo and being able to fire off big hits or threaten Explosion or Self-Destruct often forces it out. However, paralyzing Mewtwo can actually benefit it, as it can now no longer be frozen or put to sleep, and skipping turns with paralysis lets Mewtwo PP stall more effectively. Generally, Mewtwo despises being paralyzed early on, as it loses momentum against Mew, Snorlax, and Mewtwo specifically tailored to break through opposing Mewtwo. However, later on, when Mew and Snorlax have likely been taken out, Mewtwo tends to appreciate paralysis more. If you have the tools on your team to take advantage of a paralyzed Mewtwo early on, then it is absolutely worth it, as finding a way to break the opposing Mewtwo without risking your own is a key way to win consistently in RBY Ubers.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro is a fairly notorious check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo, being able to set up freely or even PP stall it if all goes well. The only risk to Slowbro in this scenario is a freeze from Ice Beam, which can be somewhat made up for with Rest preventing further status. Slowbro can also muscle past non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo through Thunder Wave and +6 Surf, which will eventually 4HKO a +6 Mewtwo and deal mortal damage otherwise. However, if Mewtwo has Thunderbolt, Slowbro will be 3HKOed even at +6 if Mewtwo is also at +6.</p> <p><strong>Self-KO Moves</strong>: The sheer power of Self-Destruct and Explosion makes them common methods of dispatching Mewtwo, primarily because it's often the highest-value Pokemon on its team and normally the most threatening. These strategies are at their most potent when Mewtwo is paralyzed, as it ends up becoming slower than the strongest users of self-KO moves in the game, namely Snorlax and Golem. While not even a STAB Self-Destruct from Snorlax will OHKO Mewtwo, it will often leave it in a position to be revenge killed by Pokemon like Tauros. Snorlax can also use Body Slam and then Self-Destruct, which is a guaranteed KO. Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets are often expressly made to trade against opposing Mewtwo too, and it's often paired with deadly sweepers like Slowbro, which become significantly more threatening with Mewtwo off the table. While their Explosions are quite weak, Gengar and Electrode also tend to Explode against Mewtwo, coming very close to OHKOing it on a critical hit.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mewtwo's defining set makes full use of the incredible Amnesia. With its astronomical Special, Amnesia leaves it almost impossible to switch into until it's scouted and just as hard to KO with special moves. A Mewtwo boosted up to the maximum of 999 Special can only fall to three or more critical hit special attacks. This tremendous bulk and Recover allow Mewtwo to stay healthy while hammering away. However, after these two mandatory moves, Mewtwo's coverage is impressive and has multiple viable options, making it a multifaceted threat able to plow through just about everything. The coverage options you choose will largely decide what your Mewtwo's primary role is.</p> <p>Mewtwo's STAB Psychic is one of the scariest no-drawback moves in the game. A 33.2% chance to drop Special as an added bonus can allow Mewtwo to muscle through something like Light Screen Chansey. The Special drops can also be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing paralyzed Mewtwo to outspeed an opposing paralyzed Mewtwo or incapacitate it for something else to handle; because of this, a paralyzed Mewtwo isn't out of the game just yet. Finally, Psychic has a significant benefit in causing an opposing +4 Mewtwo's Special to overflow if it doesn't have a \"SafeTwo\" stat spread, which consists of 13 DVs and 8 EVs in Special to ensure it starts at 341. Unfortunately, with the bevy of Psychic-types in Ubers, Mewtwo's targets are often resistant and thus take Psychic decently before striking back. Common examples include Exeggutor, Slowbro, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo.</p> <p>Slotting in Thunderbolt gives Mewtwo some unique coverage possibilities while bringing its PP up to 104. Mewtwo is now able to easily beat Slowbro; if both boost to the 999 cap, Mewtwo still 3HKOes with Thunderbolt, and that's to say nothing of its 25.39% chance to OHKO with a critical hit. Thunderbolt also gives Mewtwo access to paralysis. While the odds are slim, this can help Mewtwo and teammates immensely against opposing Mewtwo and Chansey. You're statistically likely to get at least one instance of paralysis from Thunderbolt's full PP, so it's fair to fish for it. On the downside, using it in the third moveslot means Mewtwo lets Exeggutor in for free, as it's only 3HKOed by a 999 Special Psychic from full HP; it can then use this opportunity to spread status or use Explosion. You also lose out on the potential to freeze by forgoing Ice Beam, which can really hurt against Chansey, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo. Also, paralyzed Mewtwo can inadvertently allow Rhydon a free switch should it use Thunderbolt or Recover, which puts it in a very difficult spot, as Rhydon can fish for Substitute on full paralysis and 3HKO with Earthquake from there.</p> <p>Ice Beam slots in nicely alongside Psychic, and the biggest reason is the 10.1% freeze chance. While the coverage is nice to help deal with Exeggutor, Ice Beam's primary draw is to freeze opposing Mewtwo or, less ideally, one of its major checks, like Chansey. This can open up the entire game and oftentimes win it outright. However, Slowbro is able to soak up this set's hits and use Amnesia, Thunder Wave, and Rest to have a good chance to beat Mewtwo head-on. Additionally, while Starmie doesn't pose much of a threat offensively, it can also paralyze Mewtwo or attempt to freeze it; it can take at least one hit from a Mewtwo with this coverage boosted up to 999. Opponents must be careful though, as +4 Psychic will 2HKO Starmie. Another drawback to this set is the mere 96 total PP, which can often become crucial when battling against other Mewtwo and trying to break down Chansey. This makes freezing the wrong Pokemon possibly quite deadly, as opposing Mewtwo tend to win from there through PP stall. When using Psychic + Ice Beam, it's best to avoid paralyzing the opposing Mewtwo in favor of winning by PP stall or freezing it.</p> <p>Even without a STAB option, Mewtwo still threatens the entire metagame with BoltBeam coverage. Instead of using its STAB Psychic, it can combine the coverage and benefits of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt while reaching 104 PP. While lacking Psychic means it no longer KOes the powerful and Self-Destruct-using Snorlax after some chip damage, the coverage allows Mewtwo to deal with almost everything else. It gains the advantage against both Slowbro and Exeggutor while bearing a 10.1% freeze chance for opposing Mewtwo, Mew, or Chansey. Since it handles almost the entire metagame besides these three Pokemon and Snorlax, it can blow the game wide open by freezing one of them. One drawback to this set is that, if your opponent has both Chansey and Mewtwo active, it will only be able to take out one while being walled by the other because of relying on a freeze. However, you can use Thunderbolt to attempt paralysis, meaning Mewtwo isn't completely shut down and can still help its team against these threats. Boosted up to 999, Mewtwo is able to OHKO Slowbro, Exeggutor, Tauros, and Starmie to name a few, making this combination a Swiss Army knife that is very difficult to deal with.</p> <p>A unique option that Mewtwo can run is Submission. First, Submission holds a whopping 48 PP, bringing the total to 128 if using Ice Beam or 136 if using Thunderbolt. This lets Mewtwo win PP wars against opposing Mewtwo consistently while having the advantage against Chansey. One must be careful of it getting frozen though. Submission destroys Light Screen Chansey, one of Mewtwo's most common adversaries, without risking PP stall. Submission Mewtwo has an 86.7% chance to 2HKO, and with its high critical hit ratio, it has a decent chance to OHKO. The primary drawback of this set is only running one special coverage option. Running Thunderbolt is the most common, as this allows Mewtwo to beat all of its most common checks, these being Chansey via Submission, Slowbro via Thunderbolt, and opposing Mewtwo via PP stall. However, this set struggles against Exeggutor and Rhydon, often allowing Explosion or status from the former and giving a free switch in to the latter. Ice Beam can be chosen over Thunderbolt to alleviate this, making the set weak to Slowbro but gaining the advantage against Exeggutor and Rhydon. Having a freeze chance is never bad either. Psychic, on the other hand, should not be chosen here; alongside Submission, it simply leaves Mewtwo vulnerable against too many common Psychic-types.</p>"

        "BooM2 (Self-Destruct)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>By bluffing the standard set with Amnesia and your chosen coverage option, this Mewtwo can lure in the opposing Mewtwo, occasionally paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and then use Self-Destruct after some chip damage. Self-Destruct also comes with the bonus of beating set-up Slowbro, which is otherwise a common check to the set.</p> <p>Self-Destruct will KO opposing Mewtwo from 52.2% minimum, which means two uses of +2 Thunderbolt will set it up. It's recommended to run Thunderbolt, as well as paralysis support, to make it harder for the opposing Mewtwo to heal its way out of Self-Destruct range with Recover. Other options tend to only make this set worse, as matching up worse against Slowbro usually forces Mewtwo to use Self-Destruct. The normally ubiquitous Recover can be dropped for Thunder Wave, which guarantees that Mewtwo can use Self-Destruct before the opposing one can heal out of KO range. Naturally, this also means Mewtwo itself should avoid getting paralyzed whenever possible, or it becomes very difficult to succeed.</p> <p>This set carries inherent risks, as Self-Destruct is naturally inconsistent: it being absorbed by Gengar or Rhydon can be a game loss, and less common Mewtwo sets using Flash or even Barrier match up extremely well against it. However, it remains viable for the sheer reward the trade can provide. If supported by Seismic Toss Chansey, the set can be more consistent at securing trades, as two uses of Seismic Toss can also put opposing Mewtwo in KO range.</p>"
        },
        "Staller": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mewtwo can focus on stalling, which can be approached in two ways: Flash or Barrier. While they play differently in practice, the aim is very similar, that being stonewalling opposing Mewtwo. Because of the long-term role of these sets, the \"SafeTwo\" Special stat is highly recommended; the given spread gives Mewtwo a Special stat of 341, which ensures that it hits 1023 Special at +4, meaning that a Special drop does not trigger an overflow. Mewtwo's attacking option on this type of set largely depends on the rest of the team, and it only has one, so care should be taken. Thunderbolt hits Mew and Slowbro while giving Mewtwo the best PP advantage; however, Rhydon becomes extremely threatening, especially if running Flash. Alternatively, Ice Beam lets Mewtwo muscle past Exeggutor and Rhydon, as well as providing the option of freezing the opposing Mewtwo, possibly cutting off the Flash interaction early. STAB Psychic can serve as a generic option on Barrier sets, being the strongest attack Mewtwo has and also giving it the best shot of beating Snorlax before it paralyzes with Body Slam or uses Self-Destruct.</p> <p>The Flash approach aims to gain the most advantage in the Mewtwo mirror match without making a trade, so it should be kept in waiting until that opportunity arises. It works most effectively against Ice Beam Mewtwo, as Flash can decrease the opposing Mewtwo's chance of freezing your own while also giving a PP advantage against all standard sets, totaling to 112 PP with Psychic or Ice Beam, or 120 if running Thunderbolt. This forces the opponent to either switch out and risk losing a Pokemon or stay in and inevitably lose if enough accuracy drops set in. Attacking the opposing Mewtwo is generally unnecessary; stalling its attacking PP is all you need, leaving yourself with a fully boosted Mewtwo to wreak havoc thereafter. This set isn't wholly opposed to being paralyzed—skipping turns is arguably beneficial once the accuracy drops have piled on, though paralysis does drastically decrease its consistency prior to that.</p> <p>The combination of Barrier and Amnesia can be used instead to turn Mewtwo into a sweeper that also has a large PP advantage against opposing Mewtwo, which can be 112 PP with Recover added on, not factoring in offensive options. This alone is enough to PP stall any standard Mewtwo set, allowing you to end up with a fully boosted Mewtwo by the time they run out. It is strongly recommended to get this Mewtwo paralyzed as soon as possible, as this further improves its PP stalling capabilities and ensures it cannot get frozen later. With the assistance of Barrier, exploding on Mewtwo becomes an impossibility without something like Swords Dance + Explosion Mew, which forces the opposing team to PP stall it themselves. Even the mighty Snorlax, with the strongest physical move in STAB Self-Destruct, rarely hits for even a quarter of +6 Barrier Mewtwo's health. This set works especially well against Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets, as they cannot afford a PP war and lose the ability to KO it from half HP due to the Defense boost. While still vulnerable to critical hits, Mewtwo is very difficult to KO after boosting both Defense and Special, often surviving for astonishing periods of time.</p> <p>The main drawback to stall-centric Mewtwo sets is that they often require some momentum to function; Flash usually takes multiple hits to begin making your own Mewtwo difficult to hit, and Barrier sets add more turns of setup time. Ergo, any unfortunate luck during these sequences is often devastating, and making your own Mewtwo less consistent must be for good reason. Additionally, because of the aforementioned lack of coverage and specialized nature, stall-centric Mewtwo sets often end up being weaker to Pokemon other than opposing Mewtwo. Depending on the offensive option of choice, Mewtwo can become weak to any of Chansey, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Transform Mew. Slowbro is the most notable if not running Thunderbolt, being able to accumulate a sizable PP advantage through Rest while having high enough damage output to muscle past with repeated full paralysis. If running Thunderbolt, though, Light Screen Chansey becomes a big threat if not paralyzed, possessing a PP advantage and enough bulk to shrug off what Mewtwo throws at it. Regardless of offensive option and Mewtwo's sheer power, though, Barrier Mewtwo often has limited attacking PP to punish switch stalling, which is worsened when paralyzed. Ergo, teams using this set should make up for its shortcomings. Explosion Mew, Golem, and Self-Destruct Snorlax make fine choices, often making it easier to break through Chansey and Slowbro. Zapdos or Jolteon can also be effective—especially the latter, which tends to have a more consistent Chansey matchup and has a high critical hit rate to break through Slowbro. Slowbro is also an excellent partner, profiting greatly from a Thunderbolt Mewtwo being incapacitated to set up and sweep later.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Mew is recommended to feature on all of your RBY Ubers teams and is one of only two Uber Pokemon—Pokemon banned from standard first generation play dating back to the earliest Nintendo sponsored tournaments. The mythical Pokemon may learn every TM, but it is uncommon in high-level play to see it without Swords Dance. Mew is the tier's premier physical sweeper; its base 100 stats all around let it outspeed Jynx and Speed tie with Zapdos, have an unboosted Attack stat equivalent to Tauros, and have bulk rivaling Snorlax's. Additionally, Soft-Boiled can capitalize on Mew's impressive bulk and Reflect can enhance it, which also makes Mew one of the top physical walls in the tier; conversely, it can sacrifice itself with Explosion to hopefully take another high-value Pokemon down with it. As a Special sweeper, it is outclassed by its clone, Mewtwo, which has Amnesia and a far superior Special stat, as well as by Amnesia Slowbro. Also, Mew's wallbreaking tool, STAB Psychic, is weaker than Alakazam's and Exeggutor's Psychics due to their higher Special stats.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Kick and Double-Edge are single-turn attacks more powerful than Body Slam, but, in addition to their respective poor accuracy and recoil, they lack Body Slam's paralysis chance. Ice Beam or Blizzard used with Reflect threatens to freeze opposing Mew, and both inflict more damage onto Exeggutor, Golem, Rhydon, and Zapdos before Swords Dance boosts, but both force Mew to give up offensive potential.</p> <p>A couple of consecutive Seismic Toss used without reply can get paralyzed Mew not behind Reflect in Explosion's KO range.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Since Mew has to set up before inflicting heavy damage, even Pokemon with somewhat weak defenses can paralyze it with Thunder Wave before switching out the following turn. Like any Pokemon, Mew doesn't appreciate the sleep status either.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Mew</strong>: Any Mew set with both Reflect and Soft-Boiled is a good Mew answer. Thunder Wave paralyzes Mew, and Swords Dance combined with Explosion can take both Mew out of the picture. Swords Dance-boosted attacks also attempt to KO the other Mew.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Mew without Earthquake generally lacks the means to deal any damage to Gengar, usually firing off a Thunder Wave at most.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Reflect Snorlax is particularly effective against Mew lacking Earthquake, as +6 Body Slam is only a 4HKO against Snorlax behind Reflect. Snorlax can use Rest to recover health and is immune to Body Slam paralysis. It can paralyze Mew with its own Body Slam, though, and can deal at least 74% damage with Self-Destruct—assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect's boost.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Both Rhydon and Golem can exploit Mew lacking Earthquake. Rhydon's Substitutes aren't broken by even a +6 Body Slam most of the time. In return, Rhydon is extremely likely to 3HKO with Earthquake, assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect up. Golem lacks the same power and bulk as Rhydon but can threaten with a 64% or more damage Explosion. Explosion's usage can be predictable though, and Golem finds Reflect Mew extremely tough to break down. Rhydon manages to dismantle Body Slam variants with Leer or stall with Substitute and Rest.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Although considered to have low viability, Articuno makes for a solid check to the typical Mew; it is immune to Earthquake, and unboosted Body Slam from Mew isn't even a guaranteed 6HKO. Blizzard 3HKOes Mew in return. Articuno can also run Reflect; unlike Snorlax, it isn't immune to Body Slam paralysis, though.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster functions similarly to Articuno, except for it not being immune to Earthquake. It notably suffers from a less-powerful Blizzard but instead has an improved Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Mew is only a match for Reflect Zapdos when fully boosted. In the meantime, Zapdos can deal a minimum of 30% damage with Thunderbolt, forcing Mew to recover, while threatening possible critical hits. Mew recovering, especially from critical hits, gives extra opportunities for Thunderbolt's 10.2% chance of inflicting paralysis—assuming Mew isn't already paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is resistant to Earthquake and is usually only 6HKOed by Mew's Body Slam without boosts. It threatens Mew out with potential Stun Spore and Sleep Powder. It can also do 58% damage minimum to Mew with Explosion if Reflect is not up.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can paralyze Mew with Thunder Wave or set up Reflect or Withdraw with paralysis support. Slowbro's Surf has a small chance of 2HKOing at +2 Special.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros, which is faster than Mew when not paralyzed, can take it out with enough critical hits or full paralysis triggerings. Tauros benefits from its immunity to Body Slam paralysis, though the matchup slowly reverses as Swords Dance Mew gains its Attack boosts.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: If necessary, Mewtwo can 2HKO Mew on average at +2 Special. Mew, on the other hand, only 3HKOes at +2 Attack unless it possesses Hyper Beam.</p>",

        "Traditional Sweeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mew's traditional aim is to set up with Swords Dance, recover from any damage via Soft-Boiled, and then attempt to sweep with its two attacks. Earthquake is generally Mew's most damaging attack, OHKOing Gengar and 2HKOing Golem and Rhydon at +2 Attack. Body Slam hits Zapdos and Exeggutor neutrally, albeit being initially weak; it also aims to paralyze targets including opposing Mew, using paralysis and damage to pressure it to recover or use Explosion. At +6 Attack, Body Slam has guaranteed 2HKOs on every Pokemon that isn't Cloyster, behind Reflect or Defense boosts, or a Rock- or Ghost-type. Hyper Beam provides a more powerful move to finish off targets besides Golem, Rhydon, or Gengar, but additional paralysis support and care to avoid being exploited by Transform Mew are advised. Another downside of Hyper Beam is the risk that +4 or +6 Attack Hyper Beam is weakened by one of Mew's 19.5% likely critical hits, which can cost it the KO and force Mew to recharge. Soft-Boiled is the choice for longevity, but often Explosion can be useful to cancel out an opposing Mew in an advantageous position.</p>"

        "GGMew (Reflect Sweeper)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set was popularised during various RBY Ubers tournaments in 2016. It simultaneously performs well against opposing Mew and sets up to sweep. Thanks to Reflect, it can't be KOed by another Mew outside of a +4 Explosion—given no status, enough PP, and consistent recovery. The downside is having to choose between Body Slam or Earthquake; however, when you consider the viable Pokemon in the tier, your opponent will probably have at most two Pokemon that your chosen move cannot hit neutrally or super effectively. Body Slam is the slightly preferred choice due to it hitting Exeggutor and Zapdos, which are collectively considered more viable than Gengar and Rhydon. It also has 8 more PP, and Gengar and Rhydon can be baited into weakening themselves fighting Mew's teammates prior to revealing the set. Earthquake is usually more effective as a counter-team option because, like the traditional sweeper set, opting out of Body Slam for Earthquake means it is best to search for paralysis support. Soft-Boiled is recommended to take advantage of Reflect more.</p>"

        "Explosive Lure": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set exists to nullify an opposing Mew. Once your Mew has landed a Thunder Wave, the opposing Mew is slowed down and vulnerable to full paralysis. Next, boost with Swords Dance so that, on any following turn, Mew is ready to take it down with Explosion. If the opposing Mew uses Reflect, boost your Mew's Attack stat all the way up to +6 if you can in order to guarantee an OHKO with Explosion. Alternatively, you can chip the opposing Mew with Body Slam or Earthquake before delivering a +4 Explosion. With enough paralysis luck, your Mew may be able to KO the opposing Mew and save its Explosion for another Pokemon. Reflect can be used in this set to stall needing to use Explosion, although, since Mew's only attack will be Explosion, it relies on your opponent not playing around it and either giving away a less valuable Pokemon or sending in Gengar, Golem, or Rhydon. This set can also function as an emergency Mewtwo check; it is only 2HKOed by 999 Special Mewtwo, so Mew can reliably paralyze Mewtwo, and it does a minimum of 63% damage with an unboosted Explosion.</p>"

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set was created by Lutra in the mid-2010s to counter traditional Swords Dance Mew sets—particularly the Hyper Beam variant—and greatly departs from the traditional sweeper set. Once in against opposing Mew, use Thunder Wave and Reflect first as it sets up Swords Dance, use Soft-Boiled if needed to stay healthy, and, finally, use Transform. This sequence makes your Mew into the traditional sweeper set with the bonus of Reflect protection and an opposing Mew that can become fully paralyzed. If you make your Mew transform before its target reaches +6, it can use Swords Dance again to both boost itself and lower its target's Speed under paralysis. The Reflect sweeper set, unfortunately, ruins it plans, stalling it out by taking advantage of Transform's 5 PP. This set will also result in a stalemate with fellow Transform Mew, possibly resulting in an endless battle. Worse yet, its lack of offensive threat means the opponent can easily switch to another Pokemon.</p>"
