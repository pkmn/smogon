      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Venusaur is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>For a while, Venusaur was close to obsolete in UU because Victreebel, which was an already fairly uncommon pick, largely outclassed it. However, Victreebel eventually exited the tier for OU, opening a power vacuum Venusaur was happy to occupy. Thanks to this and a few significant metagame shifts, Venusaur has become a permanent resident of RBY UU.</p> <p>Despite its humble origins, Venusaur is a powerful threat. Sleep is deadly in RBY and Venusaur boasts the second-fastest reliable sleep move in UU, behind only Venomoth. While Venusaur is much slower than tier staples like Tentacruel and Kadabra, its Speed tier is still a cut above several bulky Pokemon, like Hypno and Vaporeon, and happens to be shared with Dragonite. It is in these matchups where Venusaur most often thrives, as it can either use Sleep Powder uncontested or fire off its surprisingly powerful Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a threat that can bully Pokemon with Sleep Powder early-game and continue to exert some offensive pressure once a foe is asleep.</p> <p>Like Victreebel before it, Venusaur is notably restricted by its typing; while Poison does grant an immunity to Toxic, it isn't good for much else. It leaves Venusaur quite vulnerable to Psychic from common Pokemon like Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz while making Earthquake deal neutral damage. Combine this with an Ice weakness and you get a Pokemon with numerous troublesome matchups and some difficulty switching in.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Venusaur has a few interesting moves available to it, though most are not especially useful. Hyper Beam is arguably its best alternative, being used over Toxic to hit a few targets for extra damage and finish off foes like Hypno a bit earlier. Rather impressively, it does well over 60% to Kadabra. Just note that dropping Toxic leaves Venusaur much more susceptible to partial-trapping.</p> <p>A Swords Dance set is possible, but it doesn't exactly take advantage of Venusaur's strengths, and other Pokemon like Tentacruel and Pinsir run the move with more consistency.</p> <p>Leech Seed is a possible alternative to Toxic to deal with partial-trapping while also giving Venusaur some health back; it gives roughly as much as Wrap takes away. The move does have higher accuracy than Toxic, but the effect isn't permanent, and it deals much less damage. Leech Seed also has the advantage of affecting Tentacruel, though it is unable to hit Tangela. The move can also be used in tandem with Toxic to continuously escalate Leech Seed's drained health, but setting this up in a real match is much easier said than done.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: If Venusaur has already used Sleep Powder on something else, Haunter is a pretty big issue. Venusaur's only option is Razor Leaf, which is 5HKO or worse. Haunter can 3HKO it if it's carrying Psychic or 4HKO with Night Shade.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Venusaur's Body Slam isn't particularly strong, so most Flying-type Pokemon can easily scare it away. Dragonite and Articuno take very little damage from any of Venusaur's moves and can 2HKO with Blizzard, though it is only guaranteed for the latter. Dodrio can set up Agility fairly freely in front of Venusaur, as Drill Peck is a 2HKO and Body Slam can't paralyze it. While rare, Moltres performs almost identically to Articuno against Venusaur.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Users</strong>: Kadabra is the scariest foe that can exploit Venusaur's weakness to Psychic, as it outpaces Venusaur and 2HKOes it. Due to the risk of a critical hit, Venusaur will almost always switch out, assuming Kadabra is healthy. Note that Hyper Beam is a legitimate threat to a paralyzed Kadabra, however. Hypno also 2HKOes but is slower, so it only really acts as a check if it is paralyzed or if one of its teammates is already asleep. Electabuzz is very likely to 3HKO Venusaur if it has Psychic, though Razor Leaf is also a 3HKO. Interestingly, the uncommon Venomoth is a premier Venusaur check. It effortlessly shrugs off Razor Leaf, outspeeds, carries Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, and 3HKOes with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Fortunately for Venusaur, it is faster than most users of Ice-type moves, so it is much less afraid of them than its rival Tangela. Nonetheless, there are a few Pokemon that can outspeed and threaten Venusaur. Tentacruel is the most prominent, as it can use Wrap and score a KO as early as 63.9%. Gyarados doesn't take Razor Leaf very well, but it barely outspeeds and threatens a likely 2HKO with Blizzard. If Venusaur is paralyzed, it becomes a lot more afraid of Pokemon like Vaporeon, Omastar, and especially Dewgong.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Razor Leaf will virtually always land a critical hit, so it provides Venusaur with a reliable and powerful STAB move that gives it a key advantage over Tangela. Its base damage is higher than Raichu's Thunderbolt and even with Tentacruel's Surf. Razor Leaf will always OHKO Dugtrio and Omastar and deal well over 50% to Water-type Pokemon like Poliwrath and Dewgong. The move will also 2HKO Vaporeon 78.6% of the time, making Venusaur the only Pokemon in UU to do so reliably. Some neutral targets take hefty damage as well, with Kangaskhan and Kadabra dropping to two and three hits, respectively. Additionally, Razor Leaf's critical hits make it a very good move for taking out rare Amnesia users like Poliwrath and Golduck. Because Venusaur was unfortunately denied access to Stun Spore, it makes use of Body Slam to try to spread paralysis. This is helpful against common switch-ins like Dragonite, Tentacruel, Articuno, and Kadabra. The move is also Venusaur's best option for hitting some targets that resist Razor Leaf. Toxic prevents Dragonite from using Wrap effectively. It also happens to be Venusaur's best move against Tangela, notably shutting down variants that run Bind. Other, less common users of partial-trapping moves, like Pinsir and Moltres, also prefer to avoid Toxic, though they are more capable of fighting off Venusaur in general.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is Venusaur's most significant move. Working Venusaur into battle against slower foes so it can use Sleep Powder is essential to using it effectively. Most often, Venusaur will try to somehow get in against Hypno. Most simply, Venusaur can just switch in whenever the opponent is likely to switch in a healthy Hypno. Special attackers, especially Kadabra, are quite good at baiting in Hypno; note that this can be done as early as turn 1 by leading with Kadabra. Venusaur can also come in after Hypno, or really any Pokemon, has used Rest and use Sleep Powder to catch a switch-in or put the Rest user right back to sleep. While exploiting Hypno and resting Pokemon is Venusaur's main route to success, it isn't its only one. For example, it can switch well into Dugtrio despite not quite walling it, as it can threaten an OHKO with Razor Leaf in addition to sleep. Venusaur also punishes Substitute Dugtrio exceptionally well, as Sleep Powder breaches the Substitute. Venusaur is also pretty good against Electric-type Pokemon, especially Raichu, but the threat of paralysis makes the matchup a little less desirable. It is important not to paralyze many Pokemon before Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, as many Pokemon can easily wall it once they are paralyzed. Once Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, it will usually will transition right away to using Body Slam to try to paralyze a switch-in. After that, it can serve as an answer to sleeping Water-type Pokemon or an auxiliary check to Dugtrio in the endgame. Venusaur is also fairly common sleep fodder.</p> <p>Venusaur's traits make it a good teammate for several key Pokemon in the UU metagame. Leads like Kadabra and Electabuzz that goad Pokemon like Hypno and Dugtrio to switch in work very well with Venusaur, as they allow it to use Sleep Powder early on before paralysis is spread. Articuno is uniquely suited to partner with Venusaur. It appreciates Venusaur's ability to effortlessly thwart Water-type Pokemon as well as its Sleep Powder, which can make setting up Agility much easier. Articuno, in turn, does well against a lot of Pokemon that can scare or bully Venusaur, like Dragonite, Dodrio, and Tangela. Other wallbreakers and sweepers like Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, and Dragonite appreciate Venusaur for similar reasons.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Venusaur used to be used more often in earlier RBY OU metagames, but it fell out of favor due to the amount of Psychic- and Ice-type moves, as well as paralysis, thrown around. Still, it stands out as a Swords Dance wallbreaker that isn't hindered by Rhydon, and it can cleave through bulky Water-types like Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro thanks to Razor Leaf: Razor Leaf is one of the most consistent ways to dispatch Slowbro in the tier, and deceptively few teams are actually prepared for it. Venusaur is one of faster viable sleepers in the tier, only being outsped by Jynx and Gengar. It can act as a soft check to Snorlax, which is unlikely to 3HKO Venusaur and may be forced into a Rest loop by Razor Leaf, letting Venusaur set up. Venusaur often can be a two-for-one with sleep as one \"KO\", and Swords Dance + Hyper Beam picking up the second.</p> <p>However, a horrible defensive typing makes Venusaur harder to use effectively. It takes super effective damage from the very common Psychic and Blizzard, which will often deal heavy damage or force it out. Because of this, Venusaur adds very little defensive synergy to a team. Secondly, Venusaur's coverage is limited to Grass and Normal, allowing Gengar to hard wall it. Finally, it has competition with Victreebel. Victreebel also has STAB Razor Leaf, gets Wrap and Stun Spore, and has a higher Attack stat. It, however, has lower Defense and Speed than Venusaur. This means that, although Venusaur is less prone to being revenge killed by Tauros and never has to worry about Cloyster speed ties, it lacks the surprise factor and misses out on a few important damage ranges when compared to Victreebel, further narrowing its niche.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Sleep Powder allows Venusaur to keep a Pokemon out of play for up to the entirety of the game. Combined with Venusaur's Speed, you should be able to find an opportunity to land sleep in most games. Razor Leaf is Venusaur's best STAB option, landing a critical hit 99.6% of the time. Razor Leaf's primary target will be Water-types such as Starmie and Slowbro in addition to Rhydon. However, Razor Leaf also notably can 2HKO Tauros after just a little chip damage, while Tauros is unable to 2HKO Venusaur back. Swords Dance allows Venusaur to wallbreak and sweep when paired with Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Venusaur primarily uses sleep from itself or a teammate to set up Swords Dance. One of the best times to set up is immediately after sleeping a Pokemon, which gives a free turn whether it switches or stays in. Another good time is when an opposing Pokemon such as Snorlax or Slowbro is about to use Rest; you can also use Razor Leaf instead to deal damage to a switch-in or force Snorlax into a Rest loop. Before setting up, you also should deal with key threats that outspeed Venusaur and threaten it with high damage or paralysis—especially Gengar, which hard walls it—and avoid any damage or status unless Venusaur absolutely has to take it. After one Swords Dance, Venusaur has a 74.4% chance to OHKO Alakazam and OHKOes Chansey with a bit of initial damage; after a second Swords Dance, it has an 84.6% to KO Starmie with a single Hyper Beam. At +6 Attack, a majority of Pokemon that do not resist Hyper Beam will be OHKOed. Even if Venusaur fails to sweep an entire team, you likely got sleep off and took out at least one fast Pokemon on the opponent's team, possibly Tauros. This lets Venusaur enable Rhydon due to Tauros being one of the main obstacles for Rhydon. Rhydon also pairs nicely with Venusaur because it handles threats such as Zapdos and Pin Missile Jolteon that threaten Venusaur.</p> <p>When using Venusaur, you should not put it in the lead spot. Its Speed does not allow it to do well against any of the common leads, and leading off puts Venusaur in the face of danger early, which can weaken its offensive potential. Waiting to deploy Venusaur lets it get sleep off without risking any Speed ties with Exeggutor. If you paralyze the common leads—Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx—before getting sleep, they often cannot switch in comfortably anyway. Starmie will be threatened by Razor Leaf, and Alakazam and Jynx will usually fall to a +2 Hyper Beam. Body Slam may look enticing for its paralysis chance and lack of recharging, but it is not strong enough to make as much use out of Swords Dance as Hyper Beam.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Charizard is generally considered less viable in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Charizard is defined by Swords Dance in RBY UU, which, when combined with its near-unresisted coverage in Body Slam and Earthquake, lets it threaten a large portion of the tier once set up. Additionally, STAB Fire Blast lets it immediately threaten teams featuring Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur, which normally perform admirably against teams using staple Normal-types like Persian and Kangaskhan. Plus, it can Speed tie tier-king Tentacruel while threatening significant damage with Earthquake or a burn with Fire Blast, the latter of which severely dampens its Wrap. Thus, Charizard is a fine pick on offensive teams that need a specialised wallbreaker that can spread burns.</p> <p>However, Charizard's typing is generally not suitable for UU, being weak to some of the most common offensive types in the tier, which makes it much frailer than it lets on. In addition, Charizard suffers greatly from Wrap; AgiliWrap Dragonite shuts it down and can set up on it very consistently, and slower Wrap users force it to choose between switching out and losing Swords Dance boosts or being worn down. In Tentacruel's case, Charizard can potentially win the Speed tie if it stays in, but Surf often causes it to lose if it hasn't set up prior. Because Charizard is reliant on its Speed to succeed, it is also ruined by paralysis, and the threat of this frequently forces it out before it can deal any significant damage.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charizard has a very wide movepool. Replacing Fire Blast or its fourth moveslot is feasible, though it loses its near-unresisted coverage in the process. This can end up hurting Charizard's matchups against either Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur or Gyarados and Dragonite, both of which are hard to work around.</p> <p>Charizard can use Fire Spin to pivot out against its checks, making it more versatile and supplementing its offense. This can improve its Dragonite matchup, letting it pivot out to a Pokemon with Toxic, such as Persian. However, the punishment for missing with Charizard can be paralysis, which it can't afford with its wallbreaking role. Worse still, Fire Spin often ends up inviting in checks like Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Vaporeon, which take minimal damage while forcing Charizard out. Other Pokemon tend to make better use of Fire Spin, most notably Moltres, which has higher Special, and Rapidash, which has higher Speed, notably outpacing Tentacruel. Both have access to Agility as well, letting them use the aggressive AgiliSpin combination.</p> <p>Counter is a fringe option for Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dodrio, all of which have powerful Normal-type STAB moves. Counter is useful if Charizard survives a Hyper Beam to fire back during the recharge turn, which indirectly gives Charizard a switch-in opportunity. Charizard can also use Hyper Beam itself, which is an incredibly strong finisher if one decides to use an even more aggressive set. In fact, Charizard can even 2HKO Vaporeon with +2 Earthquake followed by Hyper Beam. However, this further increases Charizard's reliance on Swords Dance and leaves it without a midground option. Mega Kick is also a valid option for 2HKOing Vaporeon half the time, though its utility outside of this is questionable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Charizard cannot deal with paralysis at all, often being forced out by the threat of it. Without its Speed, Charizard loses its valuable Speed tie against Tentacruel and can be chipped down by Wrap and dispatched with Surf. Kadabra and Electabuzz outspeed Charizard while threatening it with Thunder Wave,making them common switch-ins to Swords Dance attempts. Electabuzz is particularly notable for having STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes Charizard. Thus, these Pokemon must be paralyzed—or ideally, removed—if Charizard is to attempt a sweep. Charizard can situationally win if they're paralyzed, as +2 Earthquake OHKOes Electabuzz and has a small chance to OHKO Kadabra. Furthermore, Body Slam paralyzing them on the switch can completely turn the tables on them. Tangela, while being 2HKOed by Fire Blast and disliking burns, can paralyze Charizard with Stun Spore, meaning it should be chipped into KO range. Body Slam users such as Dodrio, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Vaporeon are also minor ways for Charizard to be paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Without Toxic, Fire Spin, or a lucky Fire Blast burn, Charizard can't hinder AgiliWrap Dragonite, thus letting it switch in, set up, and take over the game from there. Furthermore, even non-AgiliWrap variants can threaten Charizard directly with a 2HKO from Blizzard or paralysis from Body Slam, as well as a 2HKO from Thunderbolt with minor chip damage prior.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Without switching in on a predicted Rest and setting up, Charizard fails to make an impact against the Water-types of the tier. Gyarados is notable for being immune to Earthquake, only being remotely threatened with a 3HKO from +2 Body Slam, and KOing Charizard with Hydro Pump if it's taken even minor damage. Vaporeon and Dewgong can survive a 2HKO from +2 Earthquake while threatening back with their STAB moves, dealing massive damage. Omastar can OHKO Charizard a quarter of the time with Hydro Pump but takes significant damage from +2 Earthquake. Tentacruel can shut Charizard down with Wrap and deals massive damage with Surf, but +2 Earthquake OHKOes it half the time, making this a matchup it can't really afford to play into due to its high value. Generally, if any Water-type uses Rest and Charizard switches in, it can make use of those free turns to win, but it must KO them by the turn they wake up to not lose momentum.</p> <p><strong>Aerodactyl</strong>: Aerodactyl is the only Pokemon in the entire game to resist the combination of Fire, Normal, and Ground, which makes it effective at revenge killing Charizard. While it can't afford to take a burn, Aerodactyl shrugs off any attack Charizard throws at it while threatening a 3HKO with two Double-Edge uses followed by Hyper Beam. Aerodactyl can also use Toxic on rare Fire Spin variants to cause Charizard to take more damage than Fire Spin deals.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Dugtrio and Kangaskhan can't switch in on Fire Blast by threat of a burn, but both 2HKO Charizard with Rock Slide. Dugtrio is of particular note for excellently revenge killing Charizard, as it outspeeds it. However, Dugtrio cannot switch in on Body Slam, which may incapacitate it with paralysis. Additionally, if Dugtrio or Kangaskhan has taken damage, Charizard is likely to come out on top with Fire Blast, which has a strong probability to 2HKO both. Golem, while rare, can OHKO Charizard with Rock Slide, but it is threatened with a 2HKO from +2 Earthquake, and Fire Blast burns ruin its valuable Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: While outsped and 2HKOed by Fire Blast, Articuno can OHKO Charizard with Blizzard half the time, so Charizard can only really afford to fight Articuno if it has already taken damage. Articuno has ample opportunity to switch in on Earthquake as well, which forces Charizard to either gamble on a critical hit or switch out. In the event Charizard uses Fire Spin, it can chip Articuno down to Fire Blast range, but this will take around seven turns at minimum without critical hits, all of which risk a miss or low Fire Spin duration.</p>",

        "Swords Dance Wallbreaker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is essential for Charizard to do any significant damage to many foes, as its Attack is initially quite mediocre. Fire Blast is very powerful, 2HKOing Articuno, Venusaur, and Tangela. The burn chance is also highly beneficial for incapacitating resistant Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Tentacruel, and some Dragonite and Gyarados variants. However, it arguably benefits Persian, which can no longer be paralyzed—and Slash bypasses the Attack drop. Earthquake is Charizard's best chance at beating Tentacruel during the Speed ties. At +2, it OHKOes Electabuzz, Raichu, and Haunter, as well as Tentacruel half the time; it also 2HKOes Omastar. Charizard's last moveslot is largely based on its team, but one of the two choices is crucial for providing near-unresisted coverage alongside Earthquake. Body Slam is a solid fourth move for its paralysis chance, giving Charizard a midground option and having much higher damage output when boosted with Swords Dance. On the other hand, Slash is a near-guaranteed critical hit, making it almost equal to Hyper Beam and thus giving Charizard immediate power; however, it ignores boosts and thus lacks synergy with Swords Dance.</p> <p>Charizard succeeds as a wallbreaker and is thus an effective punishment for Pokemon using Rest. Most notably, it can switch in on a predicted Rest from Hypno, set up Swords Dance, and threaten up to 51.2% damage with Earthquake. This forces Hypno to either attempt to Rest stall or switch out, both of which are less than ideal situations. Similarly, Pokemon like Omastar fail to wall Charizard if it switches in on their Rests. Despite this, Charizard should not set up without prior scouting, as the mere risk of it setting up often prompts an immediate switch-in from the opponent, which can be anything from a counter to a paralysis spreader, the latter of which makes it little more than death fodder. Charizard is very capable of sweeping late-game once such checks are removed.</p> <p>Charizard is best used on teams that struggle against those featuring Venusaur and Tangela, which often employ Articuno to set up against a sleeping Pokemon and sweep. Persian makes another excellent partner, being faster than Tentacruel while profiting heavily from the openings Charizard can provide against common defensive cores. Like many Pokemon, Charizard benefits significantly from Hypno, which grants it significant openings with its longevity, paralysis, and sleep. Teams using Charizard should account for its lack of defensive utility: the most it can offer is double switching into Earthquake. Bulky Water-types like Omastar and Dewgong cover its weaknesses very well, being resistant to Ice and Water at once; Omastar particularly benefits thanks to Charizard's immunity to Earthquake. Pokemon immune to Electric also very helpful, coming with the added bonus of limiting the spread of Thunder Wave paralysis. Dugtrio works particularly well, as its Speed and power ensure it keeps momentum after absorbing Thunder Wave. Charizard also tends to draw in Grass- or Water-types that try to check it, allowing Dugtrio to force damage onto them; however, other Pokemon like Aerodactyl and Gyarados can also perform this task admirably. Because Charizard cannot normally deal with Dragonite without a Fire Blast burn, Dragonite checks such as the ubiquitous Tentacruel, Gyarados, Articuno, and Toxic users such as Aerodactyl, Persian, Dugtrio, and Kangaskhan are all viable teammates.</p>"

Additionally, while Swords Dance could make you assume it has some sort of niche, many better Swords Dance users exist such as Kingler, Kabutops, and Sandslash. The only benefits to using Charizard over Moltres are its base 100 Speed, Swords Dance, and Slash. +2 Hyper Beam or Earthquake can threaten most Pokemon, but it's difficult to use Swords Dance due to the omnipresence of Thunder Wave users like Alakazam and Starmie, and being paralyzed makes Charizard's fragility much more apparent. Its weaknesses to common attacking types leave it 2HKOed by Starmie, Slowbro, Zapdos, Jolteon, most Blizzards, and Gengar, as well as OHKOed by Rhydon and Golem.

Fire Blast threatens Jynx, Exeggutor, and Victreebel while scaring Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax with the risk of game-losing burns.

      "overview": "<p>Fire-types may be disappointing in RBY on the whole, but Charizard completely warps NU around it thanks to its incredibly threatening combination of Swords Dance, base 100 Speed, and Earthquake coverage. It may not be on every team, but every team needs overlapping Charizard checks to avoid getting obliterated if it ever finds a free turn. Terrifyingly, this is not the extent of Charizard's power. It also makes an excellent lead, mixed attacker, and revenge killer, packing options like Fire Blast, Slash, and Counter to cover a variety of situations. Charizard crucially outspeeds Venomoth, serving as the most consistent way to block its entry and prevent it from putting something to sleep, and Mr. Mime, allowing it to revenge kill effectively. It also exploits Fire-type opposition like Moltres, which cannot do much to stop it from setting up Swords Dance and tearing through the enemy team. Earthquake is the real clincher, though; Earthquake hits many would-be Charizard checks well, helping it break through Kabutops and Nidoking and giving it a chance against Golem.</p> <p>For all these upsides, Charizard is still held back by its lack of physical STAB, mediocre Attack stat, and horrible defensive typing. It's terrifying once it sets up Swords Dance against a worn-down team, but without STAB and with only base 84 Attack, it cannot OHKO most foes at +2. In fact, +2 Hyper Beam only has a 31% chance to OHKO the frail Mr. Mime, so it heavily relies on team support to wear foes down into range. Its weaknesses to Water, Ice, Electric, and Rock allow most foes to hit it super effectively, and its bulk is not good enough to compensate—every prominent Pokemon in NU can 2HKO it except for Wigglytuff, Raticate, and Charizard, and Golem outright OHKOes it with Rock Slide. Additionally, paralysis completely ruins its ability to sweep and revenge kill; it becomes a great sleep blocker when paralyzed but has to hope to switch in safely on Venomoth, which can backfire if it lands a critical hit or Special drop with Psychic.</p>",

Counter can, for example, heavily punish opposing Charizard for attacking at +2 or using Slash, and it can allow Charizard to switch into and return a +2 Hyper Beam from Charizard, Kabutops, or Kingler. It can even use Counter on Clefable's Hyper Beam to leave it in range of Fire Blast or Hyper Beam, or it can come in to revenge kill Raticate and use Counter to catch whatever it switches out to. This can be especially devious if Charizard takes paralysis, lulling the opponent into expecting it to switch out. Reflect can be run with Swords Dance to win an arms race with opposing Swords Dance Charizard, blocking even a +6 Hyper Beam. Toxic appears viable with Fire Spin at first, but this is an incredibly inconsistent strategy that leaves Charizard with poor coverage; a single miss usually results in Charizard getting KOed after blessing opposing Pokemon with an easy way to block sleep and paralysis.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Once paralyzed, Charizard is limited to sleep blocking and revenge killing paralyzed foes. This is a major problem for Charizard due to its plethora of common weaknesses, mediocre bulk, and inability to KO anything at full HP even after using Swords Dance. If Charizard does take paralysis, its best move is to sleep block Venomoth a few times to delay the opponent from landing sleep, hopefully giving its own team a chance to put something to sleep first. Paralysis often comes at a cost as well, as Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Wigglytuff all take massive damage from Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Charizard has a difficult time with Water-types. For starters, they all 2HKO Charizard with their choice of STAB move, but they each have other advantages as well. The ubiquitous Blastoise 2HKOes Charizard and usually survives even +2 Earthquake into Hyper Beam, and it threatens a brutal Counter against Hyper Beam or as Charizard switches out after using Slash or Body Slam. Kingler's impressive physical bulk nearly matches Blastoise's, and it's guaranteed to KO Charizard with Body Slam followed by Crabhammer, letting it fish for paralysis before dealing the coup de grace. Crabhammer also hits Charizard for at least 77%, letting Kingler secure a KO after minor chip from teammates. Both Blastoise and Kingler also survive a +4 Hyper Beam, so Charizard cannot try to reach +4 against them to sweep if they're at full health. Seadra is not quite as bulky, but it has Agility to set up a countersweep, and its Hydro Pump deals a minimum of 78%, allowing it to snipe Charizard similarly to Kingler. Kabutops is the odd one out, as its Earthquake weakness hampers its matchup and makes it a poor check; if Charizard uses Swords Dance or Earthquake as it switches in, it easily wins one-on-one, potentially even setting up a second Swords Dance in front of it before KOing it, but Kabutops can still check a weakened Charizard.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem is only rarely 3HKOed by Earthquake and OHKOes Charizard with Rock Slide, allowing it to switch into even a set-up Charizard and drive it out easily. Golem has a major issue, though; if it gets burned, it becomes setup bait for Charizard, which can use Swords Dance to reapply the burn Attack drop and cut Golem's damage to pathetic levels. After a single reapplication, Rock Slide deals a laughable maximum of 34%, letting Charizard easily continue boosting in front of its hapless foe.</p> <p><strong>Electrode</strong>: Electrode outspeeds and 2HKOes Charizard, and its 27.3% critical hit rate makes it especially terrifying. However, Charizard 2HKOes back with Earthquake, so if Electrode switches into an Earthquake or Swords Dance, it cannot win without a critical hit or luck with paralysis. Electrode can also use Thunder Wave to stop a Charizard sweep, usually suffering an OHKO immediately after</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable is bulky enough to switch into Charizard and paralyze it in an emergency, even surviving a +2 Hyper Beam comfortably; a +4 Hyper Beam has a 33% chance to OHKO, and the potential for a critical hit lowers these odds further. After paralyzing it, Blizzard 2HKOes Charizard consistently, allowing Clefable to outright win the matchup rather than just weaken it.</p> <p><strong>Charizard</strong>: Charizard can be its own worst enemy. In a Charizard mirror match, either Charizard can potentially run away with the game by boosting to +4 or even +6, so luck can swing the game heavily—Body Slam paralysis, Hyper Beam misses, and Speed tie luck can allow one Charizard to KO the other while taking minimal damage, which can then allow it to take another KO or even end the game in a mid- to late-game scenario.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Mixed Attacker Lead": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Charizard is a strong lead that can trade blows well with any typical lead. Fire Blast 3HKOes Mr. Mime and Clefable, and Blastoise—the typical Charizard check—has difficulty switching in early without allowing Venomoth in freely to put something to sleep. Earthquake is Charizard's strongest physical move without drawbacks and provides solid damage into everything except Charizard and Moltres, crucially nearly 2HKOing Kabutops and Nidoking and dealing significant damage to Golem. Body Slam lets Charizard fish for paralysis against Mr. Mime and still 3HKO it by following up with Fire Blast, and it can also paralyze opposing Charizard. It also gives Charizard a chance to hamstring switch-ins like Blastoise and Seadra, but Charizard can instead choose Slash for consistent high damage, notably 4HKOing Blastoise, 3HKOing Mr. Mime without risking a Fire Blast miss, and dealing more damage to Seadra than Charizard's other options. Charizard's fourth moveslot is flexible. Counter helps it against an opposing Charizard lead, allowing it to return Body Slam or Slash for massive damage, especially against Swords Dance Charizard, which tends to attack with Body Slam after boosting to +2. It can also use Slash; Body Slam twice followed by Slash twice usually 4HKOes Charizard while providing good odds to paralyze it, and Body Slam followed by Slash twice efficiently 3HKOes Mr. Mime. Fire Spin is a rarer but still dangerous option, allowing Charizard to pivot around its checks, albeit inconsistently. It notably also wears down Nidoking and Mr. Mime into 2HKO range quickly, potentially allowing Charizard to turn around a desperate game with a little luck if it's able to avoid paralysis until late-game.</p> <p>This Charizard set can be played in two main ways. It can either trade hits and take down the opposing lead, sacrificing itself to remove a crucial threat like Mr. Mime, or it can land one hit, take paralysis, and flee, which allows it to perpetually block sleep from Venomoth. Usually, Charizard will simply take the trade to remove Mr. Mime, freeing up its teammates, like Venomoth and Mr. Mime, to exploit this. Since Charizard often wins this matchup, it gets KOed after the opposing lead, allowing its team to take advantage of the opposing revenge killer—for example, by sending Venomoth in against slower foes. This also frees up Mr. Mime to deal immense damage later with less fear of taking paralysis. Taking paralysis to sleep block instead enables more methodical play, but it does come with drawbacks; it requires Charizard to switch a teammate into a scary threat, potentially making for a very poor trade, and paralyzed Charizard's switch-ins are fairly predictable and punishable with smart double switching or attacking. Still, blocking sleep can potentially enable much more aggressive play from slower teammates like Clefable, Blastoise, and Golem. If Charizard escapes the lead matchup unparalyzed, it can use its Speed and coverage to effectively revenge kill most foes later on or to chip foes down and pivot with Fire Spin. In the Charizard versus Charizard matchup, Body Slam is the usual choice to weaken and hopefully paralyze it; however, a Swords Dance Charizard can take advantage of this 70% of the time, so switching out to Blastoise is a reasonable move to ensure it can't set up. However, this invites Venomoth in, so double switching back to Charizard afterward may be the correct choice to gain an advantage. Against more unorthodox leads like Wigglytuff and Clefable, Charizard often has no choice but to trade hits, as nothing switches into them well; unfortunately, these are often worse trades for Charizard than other matchups.</p> <p>Charizard has a few notable options for teammates beyond obvious choices like Mr. Mime, Clefable, Venomoth, and Blastoise. Exeggcute can take advantage of opposing lead Mr. Mime, switching into Thunder Wave before putting it to sleep and acting as a passable sleep blocker against Venomoth. Electrode can deal immense damage if Charizard takes out Mr. Mime, cleaning up the opposing Charizard and Blastoise late-game. Raticate provides another fast option to help clean up or wallbreak, especially if the lead matchup is Charizard versus Charizard, leaving both paralyzed or KOed; Raticate crucially outspeeds Mr. Mime, allowing Charizard to wallbreak recklessly without giving up the ability to revenge kill Mr. Mime. Seadra is a great teammate, as Charizard baits in and weakens Blastoise for it, freeing it up to sweep with Agility.</p>"
        },
        "Swords Dance Lead": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Charizard can use a somewhat greedy Swords Dance set as a lead to attempt to exploit an opposing Charizard lead without Swords Dance, boosting in front of it once or twice to possibly end the game before it begins. At +2, Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam KOes Charizard, allowing it to boost and attempt to win the matchup while remaining unparalyzed and moderately healthy. Even without Hyper Beam, Body Slamstill enables it to deal massive damage and makes it difficult to switch into. Fire Blast is the usual last move to avoid losing to Venomoth, and it's Charizard's best move against Clefable and deals solid damage to Mr. Mime; however, Charizard may opt for the riskier Hyper Beam to secure the aforementioned 2HKO on Charizard and to potentially deal massive damage after winning the lead matchup.</p> <p>If Charizard is able to reach +4, it can OHKO most foes with Hyper Beam, even nearly OHKOing Blastoise, allowing it to trade hits incredibly favorably and open up the game for its teammates. This is especially effective against opposing Charizard sets that lack Body Slam or are too quick to use Counter; Slash is a mere 4HKO, easily allowing Charizard to get to +4 and eviscerate the opposing team, and Counter can be predicted by simply continuing to boost. An opposing Charizard with Body Slam, however, is highly likely to paralyze Charizard before it can set up a sweep, having a 51% chance to paralyze it in two attempts and often getting three attempts. The opponent can also immediately switch to Blastoise, which prevents this strategy from gaining traction, but this can be punished by double switching to Venomoth.</p> <p>This set is entirely sacrificial in nature, seeking to break holes in the opposing team and set its teammates up for success. It heavily relies on landing the Charizard versus Charizard lead matchup; it struggles into Mr. Mime if lacking Fire Blast, usually switching out to an allied Mr. Mime to play the mirror match and remove this threat or switching into Exeggcute to soften the matchup and secure sleep early. Unless the team has an Exeggcute, this means accepting paralysis on Mr. Mime for free, which can immediately create problems. In this case, Charizard acts as a late-game sweeper, seeking an opportunity to return later and set up. Clefable and Wigglytuff are also poor matchups for Swords Dance Charizard, with Clefable especially being difficult; if Charizard has Fire Blast, it can stay in and attack twice, failing to KO Clefable but dealing heavy damage. In rare cases, Charizard may take out the opposing lead but take paralysis in the process, allowing it be act as a sleep blocker against Venomoth later in the match. This is generally more effective if Charizard has Fire Blast. If Hyper Beam Charizard gets the correct lead matchup, it will ideally set up and take out the opposing Charizard then deal upwards of 50% to the next Pokemon to fight it, usually Blastoise or another Water-type, creating holes for allies like Mr. Mime to exploit.</p> <p>Exeggcute is an effective teammate to improve Charizard's matchup against Mr. Mime and avoid losing too much momentum. Since Hyper Beam Charizard ideally removes Charizard and Blastoise, powerful attackers like Nidoking, Moltres, and Kabutops thrive after a successful lead matchup; Moltres also Speed ties Venomoth, acting as a soft check to prevent it from landing Sleep Powder. Seadra benefits if the opponent sends Blastoise in immediately against Charizard as it uses Swords Dance; in this case, Charizard can simply use Body Slam and Hyper Beam to leave Blastoise at about 10% HP, which allows Seadra to finish it off, check the opposing Charizard, and sweep late-game. Venomoth is likely the least bad switch-in to a lead Clefable, as it still has decent odds to land Sleep Powder even as it inevitably takes Thunder Wave, potentially bailing Charizard out of an absolutely horrendous lead matchup. Fire Blast Charizard has a better matchup spread as a lead, so it may appreciate teammates like Kingler that can sweep in its stead and appreciate it removing or weakening Mr. Mime.</p>"
        },
        "Swords Dance Sweeper": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>The classic NU Charizard set is the late-game sweeper, lurking in the back and seeking an opportunity to set up and sweep. Earthquake and Hyper Beam provide perfect coverage: Earthquake handles Nidoking and Rock-types and also deals heavy damage when Hyper Beam would cause a recharge; it also has better accuracy. Hyper Beam provides the most physical damage possible, having a chance to OHKO Mr. Mime at +2 and KOing common neutral foes at +4, barring Blastoise, Kingler, and Clefable. Once these foes are chipped, Charizard can look for an opportunity to revenge kill a heavily weakened foe and instead use Swords Dance on a predicted switch, allowing it to sweep. Ideally, Charizard wants to reach +4, as it is unlikely to clear through the opposing team without taking paralysis otherwise, but this requires weakening Thunder Wave users enough to ensure they won't switch in and weakening Blastoise enough to KO it with +4 Hyper Beam, which luckily only requires about 20% in damage. This is easily dealt by Fire Blast or Earthquake, and even Body Slam makes for a favorable roll to KO it later. Charizard can choose from several options for its final move. Fire Blast provides coverage for Venomoth without needing a boost and is Charizard's most damaging option against most neutral targets, like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Raticate. Body Slam grants a safe midground option to hit Charizard and Moltres or to fish for paralysis. Fire Spin can bring Nidoking and Mr. Mime into range of a +2 attack after just one or two hits, and it's capable of securing chip damage to save a desperate game against other foes as well.</p> <p>When acting as a late-game sweeper, Charizard relies heavily on setting up a favorable revenge kill that allows it to boost. For example, if Charizard can revenge kill an Exeggcute, Ninetales, or Moltres, it can easily set up Swords Dance as they exit or land an ineffectual attack, and it may even be able to boost again if the opposing check is, for example, a Water-type, which cannot OHKO Charizard without a critical hit nor paralyze it consistently. However, most Pokemon pack Body Slam, so Charizard is always under threat of a sweep-stopping paralysis from foes like Blastoise, Ninetales, and Kingler. Charizard may have to settle for one KO and heavy damage on another foe, which is usually enough to allow its team to win the game. Charizard can also attempt to sweep at +2, allowing it to set up much more consistently; for this to work it needs to first scout for opposing Rock-types, and it needs bulky checks like Blastoise and Clefable weakened into range of +2 Hyper Beam or Earthquake. Electrode can also completely stop a Charizard sweep with Thunder Wave, so it needs to be handled at any cost if Charizard is to sweep.</p> <p>Charizard appreciates teammates that facilitate good entry points for it to sweep. Sleep inducers like Venomoth and Exeggcute can create an early opportunity by putting a foe to sleep, though Charizard is not really equipped to sweep against Pokemon at full HP. These Pokemon can also spread paralysis to help Charizard out later by giving it a chance to get a second boost in front of a paralyzed foe. Explosion users like Exeggcute and Golem can remove key targets for Charizard or do something even more devious; by using Explosion into a target they will not KO, they can facilitate Charizard's entry against a foe that cannot stop it from setting up. For example, Exeggcute can use Explosion against a target it's just put to sleep, giving Charizard a free boost against a sleeping foe. Fast attackers with good coverage like Nidoking, Raticate, and Kabutops can help spread damage through the enemy team, allowing Charizard to clean up chipped foes later. Moltres can force in typical Charizard checks like Blastoise and Kabutops, allowing it to soften them up for Charizard to finish off later; two hits with Fire Blast puts Blastoise in range of +2 Hyper Beam, and a single Fire Blast on Kabutops gives Charizard a chance to OHKO it with +2 Earthquake.</p>"

As a special attacker and tank, it is outclassed by Vaporeon, which has higher HP and Special. As a physical tank, it is outclassed by Poliwrath, which has access to Hypnosis and a powerful STAB Submission. However, Blastoise has higher Defense than Vaporeon and higher Special than Poliwrath, giving it some merit as a mixed tank.

      "overview": "<p>Mr. Mime and Clefable define RBY NU, but Blastoise is the glue that holds it together. Blastoise is the catch-all check to Fire- and Water-types and the main line of defense against an early Charizard sweep. It's also one of the few Pokemon able to take a hit from Golem, forcing it out immediately with Surf. Blastoise's offense cannot be discounted due to the lack of recovery in NU; even checks like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Electrode hate taking a Surf as they enter, and many switch-ins fear Body Slam paralysis too. Blastoise often ends up serving as a check to itself, since switching in against it is so difficult. Nothing but Electrode can 2HKO Blastoise without a critical hit, allowing it to trade hits effectively with almost any foe, and the threat of Counter makes it difficult for foes to unleash Hyper Beam with impunity, lest Blastoise switch in and punish them.</p> <p>Blastoise's biggest flaw is its mediocre Speed, which leaves it open to Venomoth entering to put it to sleep. Blastoise is so critical that allowing this is often game-losing, but switching out gives Venomoth even more momentum; this interaction makes it extremely hard to use Blastoise early-game. Even with sleep off the table, Mr. Mime, Nidoking, and Kabutops all outspeed it and will invariably damage it heavily should it stay and fight. Blastoise also struggles to check Kingler and Kabutops; while it easily weakens both into KO range of allies like Charizard or Mr. Mime, losing Blastoise early in the process can make Charizard or Moltres a major threat. Also, once Blastoise has lost roughly 45% of its HP, it's no longer an effective switch-in to unparalyzed Charizard, which can use Swords Dance as it enters and OHKO it with Hyper Beam from this range. Further, Blastoise usually draws opposing Blastoise in, and they tend to trade with each other. Blastoise thus only gets one or two switch-in opportunities per game, but the opponent will pay a price to remove it for their sweepers.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Blastoise has a plethora of niche options that can substitute for Counter or its fourth move. Toxic is a potential response to Charizard's or Moltres's Fire Spin and can also help to defeat opposing Blastoise without risking Counter. Rest allows Blastoise to eternally wall Ninetales and Seadra and can assist in Toxic stalling opposing Blastoise, but using it allows Mr. Mime and Swords Dance users free entry. Rest is best used to secure endgames against foes lacking setup, rather than as a mid-game defensive play. Blastoise may also consider Hydro Pump, sacrificing accuracy for power. It 2HKOes Moltres, possibly 2HKOes Kabutops, and 3HKOes Clefable. Ice Beam over Blizzard guarantees a 2HKO against Exeggcute without risking a miss chance, but it gives worse damage against other targets. Earthquake is Blastoise's strongest attack versus Electrode and the extremely rare Gastly, 2HKOing the former and having a 59% chance to OHKO the latter. Finally, Bubble Beam can drop the Speed of Nidoking or Charizard, and it doesn't forfeit the 2HKO if Surf follows it up, potentially allowing Blastoise to fish for an even better situation with no downside. In an emergency, it may stop Charizard from setting up and sweeping late-game.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Nearly all teams contain a Mr. Mime, which outspeeds Blastoise and 3HKOes it with Thunderbolt if it can switch in safely. Clefable, while slower, has superior bulk, switches safely into Body Slam, and threatens a Thunderbolt 3HKO or Thunder Wave. Electrode's STAB Thunderbolt is a 2HKO with a high critical hit rate, forcing Blastoise out. However, Mr. Mime and Electrode fear Body Slam paralysis and are generally frail, so they're usually only able to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Venomoth</strong>: Venomoth outspeeds Blastoise and can easily enter after a KO or switch into Surf. Blastoise is often a team's defensive centerpiece and cannot afford to take sleep early-game, which gives Venomoth a free sleep attempt as Blastoise switches out, compensating for Sleep Powder's shaky accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Blastoise</strong>: Blastoise will often trade hits with its opposing counterpart, which is often a team's only reliable Blastoise switch-in, resulting in one Blastoise being KOed and the other being severely weakened in most cases. Smart prediction with Counter may result in one Blastoise still having significant health left, but in most cases the winning Blastoise can be revenge killed by nearly any foe.</p> <p><strong>Kingler and Kabutops</strong>: Both Water-type Swords Dance users are middling checks to Blastoise, removing it but ensuring their own demise shortly after. However, a trade often suits them, as Blastoise is usually more valuable. Kingler is just bulky enough to use Swords Dance in front of Blastoise and KO or severely weaken it, often leaving a team with no further check to Charizard. Similarly, Kabutops can win the one-on-one fight or weaken Blastoise into KO range of other threats.</p>",

Seismic Toss enables Blastoise to duel opposing Blastoise and Seadra, 4HKOing both. Counter plays off of this interaction and deals 55.4% to opposing Blastoise after a Seismic Toss. It also lets Blastoise send back Charizard's or Kabutops's Slash twice over, heavily punishing anything they switch into, and Counter can return massive damage after switching into Hyper Beam from Kingler, Raticate, or Clefable. Raticate also must fear a Counter on Super Fang, usually forcing it to use Thunderbolt instead. Blastoise's final moveslot is more flexible. Body Slam can potentially hobble Mr. Mime or Electrode as they switch in, or it can gain an advantage versus opposing Blastoise without risking a massive Counter. Blizzard is also a possibility, notably 2HKOing Exeggcute and the occasional Fearow while potentially freezing other foes.</p> <p>Blastoise is a mainstay of every viable NU team, often forcing opposing Blastoise to trade for it, as few Pokemon can switch into it well. It can function well alongside other Water-types like Kabutops and Kingler, which can assist in fending off opposing Blastoise and Charizard. Golem is a notably good teammate for Blastoise, as it safely switches into Electric-type attacks, can exploit paralysis spread by Body Slam, and helps Blastoise check Charizard. Alternatively, Exeggcute can check Electrode and Mr. Mime after they force Blastoise out, utilizing the opportunity to land Sleep Powder. Electrode can pair surprisingly well with Blastoise, allowing it to play more aggressively, as Electrode can stop opposing Blastoise and Charizard late-game.</p> <p>Blastoise should only be sparsely used early-game, as opponents can easily send in Venomoth to get a free sleep attempt against it. Once Sleep Clause is in effect, it can come in to stop Fire-types and Golem in their tracks and force a response. This will usually lead to a Blastoise mirror match that removes both from the game or leaves them too weakened to check anything; should the opponent send in Mr. Mime or Clefable instead, Blastoise can happily hit them with Surf on entry, and then it can switch out to blockade Charizard later. If Blastoise gets in on a Slash from Charizard, the opponent also must consider the risk of a massive Counter against their switch-in. If Blastoise remains healthy late-game, it can stop an attempted sweep by Charizard, Moltres, or Seadra and secure victory.</p>"

Beedrill can only effectively contribute by setting up with Swords Dance and Agility, which is nearly impossible to pull off since even the weakest foes 3HKO it. One would think Twineedle gives it a niche against Psychic-types, but Beedrill flops even against the incredibly frail Abra, OHKOing it a mere 25.6% of the time. Meanwhile, Abra OHKOes Beedrill 72% of the time, before accounting for critical hits, and is faster. Beedrill outspeeds Drowzee but isn't even guaranteed to 2HKO it, and Drowzee has a small chance to OHKO back. The ubiquity of Fire-types does Beedrill no favors, as it deals pitiful damage to them and they outspeed and OHKO it, leaving it few chances to even find entry, let alone progress. In short, Pinsir and Fearow are better attackers than Beedrill on any team.</p>",

Beedrill can run Mega Drain to hit Omanyte and Graveler, but it 3HKOes at best and both foes still easily defeat it. Beedrill's best hope is for its teammates to spread sleep and paralysis, hopefully also chipping down its many checks. If Beedrill can use Swords Dance once or twice safely and faster foes are paralyzed, it may manage a sweep, or at least heavy damage.</p>"}},

      "overview": "<p>Raticate is a bit of a mixed bag. Its unique access to Super Fang allows it to weaken a Pokemon for threats like Dodrio to clean up later or outright KO foes itself with Hyper Beam. Not only that, Raticate also has an interesting special movepool that it can tap into akin to Persian, making it possible to fine-tune for a team. Raticate is also in a very unique Speed tier, being just above Haunter, and is immune to Body Slam paralysis thanks to being a Normal-type. Raticate's 18.97% critical hit rate adds significant volatility to many matchups as well, making it difficult to switch into when also considering Super Fang. These factors often let Raticate score at least one Super Fang before it goes down, which is more than enough for its teammates to break through and wreak havoc. All of these factors enable Raticate to fulfil a supportive role for its team while remaining a decent sweeper in its own right.</p> <p>However, Raticate faces some stiff competition from Kangaskhan and Persian, which possess much better stats, coverage, and general offensive potential. In addition, Raticate has poor special bulk, with attacks like Tentacruel's Surf being a guaranteed 2HKO. This makes it a nightmare to bring in without heavy support or one-for-one trades. Furthermore, Raticate relies heavily on its Speed to make progress, making paralysis a death sentence due to its fragility. Overall, this makes Raticate a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bubble Beam can replace Blizzard to 2HKO Golem or KO after a Super Fang on the switch. In addition, Bubble Beam's chance to lower Speed can let Raticate beat normally faster Pokemon that switch in expecting a Blizzard, such as Tentacruel. Without Blizzard, though, Raticate doesn't have a convincing way of stopping Dragonite from paralyzing it with Thunder Wave. Thunder can be used for a better matchup against Gyarados, possessing a guaranteed KO after Super Fang. It has little use outside of this, however, as Omastar and Vaporeon are only 2HKOed after Super Fang and will always win prolonged interactions. It is possible for Raticate to run two special moves at once—usually Blizzard and either Thunder or Bubble Beam—though this comes at the cost of Body Slam's consistency and potentially game-changing paralysis chance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Raticate can still halve Haunter's HP with Super Fang, but Blizzard does extremely poor damage. On the other hand, Haunter can 3HKO Raticate with Thunderbolt or put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Raticate will sometimes win one-on-one thanks to its Speed and Super Fang, but this is not consistent enough to recommend.</p> <p><strong>Omastar</strong>: Omastar resists Raticate's STAB moves, doesn't get OHKOed after a Super Fang, and easily 2HKOes Raticate with Hydro Pump. Omastar can switch in on a Hyper Beam, forcing Raticate out after it recharges and inflicting significant damage in the process. Raticate can use Thunder to try and get a better matchup, but Omastar takes no more than 36.1%, thus still winning one-on-one unless paralysis or critical hits are involved.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Raticate's best qualities are its Speed and access to Super Fang, which forces slower threats to take significant damage before they can land a hit. Ergo, paralysis is a massive threat to its success, and Raticate should avoid chipping threats that can paralyze it. Paralysis's Speed drop exposes Raticate's extreme fragility while further reducing the consistency of Super Fang, making it effectively dead weight in many situations. Threats like Hypno, Tangela, Dragonite, and Electabuzz that can paralyze Raticate force it out unless they're chipped already. Once Raticate has scored a KO, opponents often bring these Pokemon in, causing the Raticate user to lose a significant amount of momentum. It should be noted that Hypno and paralyzed Electabuzz can't switch into Raticate, as Super Fang + Hyper Beam has a favorable chance to KO them outright. Dragonite also can't switch into Raticate, as Blizzard will KO it after Super Fang.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Tentacruel and Vaporeon possess very effective ways to force out Raticate. Tentacruel can switch in on Super Fang if it isn't paralyzed and subsequently scare Raticate out with a 2HKO from Surf. However, Tentacruel is threatened with an outright KO from Super Fang + Hyper Beam. Vaporeon, on the other hand, survives Hyper Beam after a Super Fang and can still 2HKO Raticate with Surf.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem's Rock typing lets it easily switch in on Raticate's Hyper Beam and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Should Raticate lack a super effective move against Golem, it is very likely to lose the matchup. However, after a Super Fang, Raticate has a 41% chance to KO Golem with Blizzard and KOes it outright with Bubble Beam.</p>",

Raticate is best used mid- or late-game, though, where Super Fang is most likely to help its teammates. Raticate is best switched in on passive foes that won't damage it, such as those immobilized by Wrap or about to use Recover or Rest. Smart double switching is also a good way to bring it in. However, bringing in Raticate to revenge kill a threat isn't out of the question either, especially if that threat is a faster Pokemon that has been bogged down with paralysis. Raticate should be playing hit-and-run first and foremost, as not only is it frail, but landing a Super Fang is more than enough to leave foes open to exploitation by Raticate's teammates anyway.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>A cursory glance at Raticate may lead one to quickly disregard it as simply a worse Persian. Indeed, the cat and mouse share many similarities such as a Normal typing and access to Thunderbolt and Bubble Beam to strengthen specific matchups, but Raticate suffers from worse attacking stats and a significantly worse Speed tier. However, Raticate has a distinct niche thanks to its exclusive access to Super Fang. RBY OU is a metagame where KO ranges are a crucial factor for players to keep in mind, as nothing wants to be in range of an enemy Tauros. Super Fang's consistent damage is incredible for getting foes to these KO ranges and is guaranteed to leave a dent in anything that attempts to switch in; most importantly, Super Fang ignores type immunity against Gengar, which is one of Raticate's major strengths over Persian, as it limits the number of times that Gengar can switch in safely. Against frailer or weakened targets, Raticate can also threaten them with a Hyper Beam afterwards to KO; additionally, with its great base 97 Speed, it outpaces many Pokemon in the metagame, such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, and threatens them with massive damage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it's not all cheddar and fruit for this humble rodent. Raticate is incredibly frail, making it difficult to switch in and repeatedly wear down foes. This, combined with Super Fang's 89.5% accuracy and 16 PP, can allow faster foes like Starmie and Alakazam with reliable one-turn recovery moves to stall out Raticate's Super Fangs until it misses or runs out of PP. Raticate isn't just frail, either: its defensive profile is decidedly mediocre, meaning it can't afford to trade blows often and thus often loses a flat one-on-one fight; Super Fang's imperfect accuracy also means that missing an attack will force Raticate to take a potentially fatal blow in return, something it cannot afford. Finally, Raticate's attacking stats are very average, which often prevents it from KOing bulkier foes even after a Super Fang. As a result of these flaws, Raticate is heavily reliant on good prediction to be effective in its role, and as such, it is not recommended for most RBY OU teams because Tauros is normally all that's necessary. Even if a \"second Tauros\" is desirable, Persian is usually the better choice.</p>",

Super Fang is obligatory, as it is Raticate's only notable niche in OU and allows it to consistently deal significant damage; notably, it's able to wear down Snorlax, one of the premier defensive Pokemon in RBY. Hyper Beam is Raticate's strongest follow-up after a Super Fang, KOing non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam as well as Victreebel most of the time. Body Slam is spammable and allows Raticate to fish for paralysis on common switch-ins like Starmie. It's also useful after Super Fang as a way to fish for paralysis as Alakazam or Starmie uses Recover. Bubble Beam is Raticate's preferred coverage move because it is very likely to KO Rhydon after Super Fang, which is likely to switch in anticipating a Body Slam or Hyper Beam.</p> <p>While Raticate's first three moves are too important to drop, its last moveslot is more flexible; though, it should be noted that with the exception of Blizzard, replacing Bubble Beam will significantly compromise the Rhydon matchup. Thunderbolt can be used to hit Cloyster, potentially taking it out with a critical hit after a Super Fang. Tail Whip is an option that can be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing a paralyzed Raticate to once again outspeed opposing paralyzed Pokemon while also putting foes in range for Raticate's attacks. Blizzard has a useful freeze chance and is Raticate's strongest option against Gengar and Dragonite, but it has a lower chance to KO Rhydon after a Super Fang than Bubble Beam. Finally, Quick Attack can be used to chip a faster foe such as Tauros before Raticate goes down, but it's very situational and Raticate struggles to find much room for it.</p>"

Raticate's diverse coverage threatens Pokemon like Golem and Kabutops, and its sheer Speed allows it to threaten revenge kills against foes like Mr. Mime and Blastoise.

This can allow it to sweep or help enable sweepers like Charizard, Kabutops, and Kingler. STAB Body Slam deals excellent damage and is incredibly difficult to switch into, as opponents have to fear Super Fang obliterating their bulky Rock- or Normal-types.

Body Slam's paralysis chance makes Raticate difficult to switch into in general, and Body Slam + Hyper Beam also KOes Mr. Mime, allowing Raticate to fish for paralysis to maintain its Speed advantage while still 2HKOing it easily. Super Fang is a common component of Raticate's strategy, making switches incredibly risky even for Rock-types, Clefable, and Wigglytuff. The Super Fang + Hyper Beam combination notably 2HKOes Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and Exeggcute, sometimes 2HKOes Charizard and Nidoking, and rarely can even 2HKO Clefable. Even if Super Fang Raticate can't get the KO, its teammates probably will. Bubble Beam is the ideal coverage move, 2HKOing Golem. Thunderbolt 3HKOes Kabutops and Kingler, and Thunderbolt twice followed by Hyper Beam is enough to defeat Blastoise while avoiding a lethal Counter.</p> <p>Raticate's strategy is simple: revenge kill weakened, slower foes where possible and look for safe opportunities to get in on valuable targets lacking Thunder Wave. Once in, Raticate can use Super Fang to leave the foe in KO range of Hyper Beam or Bubble Beam, or it can use Body Slam to deal heavy damage and punish switches. It can also potentially revenge kill one foe and then take paralysis in order to damage Mr. Mime or Clefable. Raticate baits switches due to its reliance on KOing with Hyper Beam, meaning Body Slam and Super Fang can punish pivots. Due to Raticate's low bulk, switching in is quite difficult; it can benefit from Fire Spin users if you are willing to risk a miss, or it can come in after an ally puts a foe to sleep. Raticate is ideally used on highly offensive teams that seek to leave the opposing team weakened and open to a fast attacker, whether that's Raticate itself or a teammate such as Mr. Mime or Charizard. Helpful teammates for Raticate include Golem, which can switch into Thunder Wave and help check Charizard, and paralysis spreaders like Mr. Mime and Clefable, which let Raticate defeat bulky foes such as Blastoise and opposing Clefable.</p>"

Arbok is also very unreliable—Wrap is only as accurate as Fire Blast, while Glare is even worse at 74.6%. Even if it can get in against a slower threat, Arbok may just miss twice and get KOed without accomplishing anything. Thus, despite its useful tools, players should generally avoid using Arbok.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Drain can be used as coverage against Graveler, but it only has a 40.7% chance to 2HKO. Body Slam may seem like a means to attack while inflicting paralysis, but Arbok always prefers Glare's higher paralysis odds or Hyper Beam's damage. Rock Slide may seem like good coverage against Fearow and Pinsir, but Arbok always prefers to use Glare or Wrap against them, and Hyper Beam does similar amounts of damage to them.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Once paralyzed, Arbok is completely useless, as it can no longer outspeed and Wrap unparalyzed foes, and the chance of full paralysis means it can't reliably use Wrap against paralyzed targets. While Arbok outspeeds every viable Thunder Wave user besides Abra and Staryu, it still risks being paralyzed if Wrap misses or if it switches into Thunder Wave users.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Fearow and Pinsir outspeed Arbok; the former has high odds to KO it with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam, while the latter has a 26.3% chance to 2HKO with Slash. Rapidash and Arcanine also outspeed Arbok and have a 32.1% chance to 2HKO it with Fire Blast, which is accompanied by a 30% burn chance and a high critical hit rate. All of these threats must be wary of Glare, but Arbok's low damage output gives them the opportunity to KO it if it misses Wrap once or twice.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While Nidoqueen, Sandslash, and Graveler are outsped by Arbok, Earthquake 2HKOes it. Arbok is likely to miss Wrap before it can get them into KO range due to their physical bulk and Arbok's poor damage output.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Wrap and Glare is Arbok's primary draw, as the former immobilizes slower foes, letting it pivot around them or chip them down, while the latter lets it spread paralysis, making more foes vulnerable to its Wrap. While spammable, these moves have low accuracy, and Wrap may give sleeping targets free turns to wake. Earthquake hits Gastly and Rock-types for super effective damage and serves as coverage against top threats like Nidoqueen and Rapidash. Hyper Beam is Arbok's strongest attack against targets that are not weak to Earthquake, serving as a decently powerful finisher against foes like Pinsir and Machamp.</p> <p>Since Arbok is useless when paralyzed, its worst matchups are against faster Thunder Wave users, namely Abra and Staryu. Abra also 2HKOes Arbok with Psychic and is rarely OHKOed by Arbok's Hyper Beam. Drowzee is an excellent partner for its ability to check these threats and has the added benefit of spreading paralysis of its own. Arbok isn't completely helpless against faster threats, as it can try to tank a hit and retaliate with paralysis, but it still often loses due to Glare's low accuracy and the possibility of critical hits or secondary effects like burn. It's also easily overwhelmed by multiple faster opponents. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine all give Arbok a good deal of trouble, so Omanyte is an essential partner for its ability to check all of them. These same fast wallbreakers help Arbok against Pinsir, which outspeeds and does huge damage to it. Other paralysis spreaders like Dragonair and the aforementioned Drowzee also work well in hamstringing these faster threats for Arbok. Using Arbok with multiple Thunder Wave users has the added benefit of making it easier for powerful wallbreakers like Nidoqueen and Fearow to break past their checks.</p>"

It's a faster Wrap user than Dragonair, outspeeding key targets like Blastoise and Kingler, and while Glare is less accurate than Thunder Wave, it's also able to paralyze Ground-types, allowing Arbok to outspeed Nidoking. Arbok's coverage is decent—while it lacks STAB options, it has QuakeSlide coverage to hit the entire tier well. This is, unfortunately, where the positives end; Arbok's stats are mediocre, its defensive typing is incredibly detrimental, and it lacks consistency thanks to its inaccurate moves. Base 80 Speed falls short of many key threats, like Mr. Mime, Venomoth, Charizard, and Nidoking. Arbok's mediocre bulk and Poison typing leaves it 2HKOed by all of these Pokemon and more, and non-STAB moves coming off a mediocre base 85 Attack fails to threaten them enough in return. This leaves Arbok reliant on landing Glare so it can use Wrap to chip down and pivot around these foes, a strategy with low consistency that is easily ruined by paralysis, misses, and critical hits. Its main competition, Dragonair, may be slower, but it has a better movepool, Agility to easily set up and outspeed all foes, and several useful resistances, so Arbok is generally considered a terrible option for most teams.</p>",

This ensures the opponent must send in an unparalyzed Pokemon and risk taking a Glare to make consistent progress, unless they intend to wait for a Wrap miss. Wrap's control lets Arbok safely pivot in threatening allies if it does not want to attempt to land Glare against the opponent's switch-in. Earthquake provides useful coverage and is Arbok's strongest move without drawbacks, hitting foes like Nidoking, Golem, and Ninetales super effectively.

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Raichu is generally considered good in the current metagame</p> <hr /> <p>Raichu has a niche in UU as an Electric-type that can threaten Ground-types like Golem thanks to its access to Surf. The combination of Surf and STAB Thunderbolt gives it excellent coverage and sweeping potential that can be difficult for many teams to handle. In addition, Raichu's Speed allows it to tie with the ever-present Tentacruel, as well as Dodrio. On top of that, the 19.53% critical hit rate its base Speed provides makes it surprisingly powerful offensively. It can further increase this Speed while invalidating the Speed drop from paralysis thanks to Agility, which comes with the added bonus of outspeeding Dugtrio. Furthermore, Raichu is quite customizable, possessing a wide movepool with moves like Body Slam and Seismic Toss to make use of.</p> <p>However, Raichu is physically frail, taking significant damage from threats like Dodrio, Persian, and Kangaskhan. In fact, it's not uncommon to see Raichu get KOed by their STAB Hyper Beams from around 80%. This fragility notably comes into play against Dugtrio, which can KO it consistently with Earthquake if it's taken even a minute amount of damage. It's not stellar on the Special end either, with threats like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, Hypno, and Kadabra all claiming 3HKOs on it with their STAB attacks. This has a negative effect on its offenses as well, with its Thunderbolt only 3HKOing Vaporeon and occasionally missing the OHKO on Gyarados. Raichu also competes heavily with Electabuzz for a place on teams, which has higher Speed than tier-king Tentacruel without the need to boost.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Raichu's customizable nature gives it a fair amount of room to explore alternative options without much opportunity cost. However, Thunderbolt and Surf should never be dropped, as they are what allow it to perform well in the tier. If using Agility, Hyper Beam is quite desirable for closing out games against Pokemon like Hypno and Kadabra, which may come in to try and stop a sweep. It serves as Raichu's single best option against opposing Electric- and Grass-types, dealing surprisingly high damage to them and enabling it to break through. Seismic Toss is another appealing option, allowing Raichu to fight Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur and Electric-types like Electabuzz and opposing Raichu. Surf tends to deal more damage to other Pokemon, though, making Seismic Toss a bit more specific in utility. Thunder has a significant enough damage difference to net Raichu near-guaranteed 2HKOs on Persian, Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon and an OHKO against Dodrio, but the inconsistency makes it difficult to recommend, especially considering Raichu's fragility. Substitute can be used to give Raichu an opportunity to scout and spread paralysis without needing to predict. It has the added benefit of letting Raichu safely fish for critical hits and full paralysis. It also makes Raichu an even better Dugtrio lure, letting it fish for a critical hit from Surf to OHKO it or paralysis from Body Slam without taking massive damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangela is one of the few Pokemon in the tier that resists Raichu's Thunderbolt + Surf combination, and, as a result, Raichu can't do much to it. The only way for Raichu to win is through Seismic Toss, but even then, Tangela's Stun Spore will paralyze Raichu and put it into an awkward position. Tangela will usually use Raichu as setup fodder thereafter, picking up Growth boosts or using it to pivot out with Bind. While less common, Venusaur is also a large threat to Raichu's success, resisting everything thrown at it while threatening with Sleep Powder or a 3HKO with Razor Leaf. In addition, it's only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, which is, unfortunately, Raichu's best bet at trying to win.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Raichu is extremely frail on the physical side, and there are threats in RBY UU that are well equipped to exploit this. Kangaskhan and Dodrio can KO Raichu from well above half HP with Hyper Beam, meaning all Raichu can do is threaten them with Thunder Wave if it's at full HP. Furthermore, Persian can revenge kill Raichu from half HP with Slash if it hasn't set up Agility. On the flip side, Raichu can fight back hard against all of these threats; none of them want to switch into Thunder Wave, Dodrio falls to Thunderbolt if it's taken any amount of damage, and Kangaskhan takes heavy damage from any special hit. As a result, while Raichu is very threatened by these Pokemon, they really don't want to switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite can shrug off Thunder Wave with its own Agility and KO Raichu with Hyper Beam from 68.7% onwards. This can be facilitated through Wrap, which gradually chips Raichu into KO range; at minimum, it takes five Wrap uses for Raichu to be placed in Hyper Beam range. Raichu can't deal much damage to Dragonite at all, with Thunderbolt dealing less than 30%. As a result, Raichu is forced out.</p> <p><strong>Hypno</strong>: Hypno can take Raichu's attacks quite well by virtue of its excellent special bulk. This, combined with Thunder Wave and the power of Psychic, enables it to check Raichu well. However, it can only check Raichu from full HP, as, otherwise, it's very possible for Raichu to break through with critical hits. Alternatively, Raichu can use Hypno as setup fodder for Agility if it has used Rest, especially if brought in on the turn Hypno uses it, but it needs multiple critical hits to break through in this scenario. Furthermore, it risks paralysis and heavy damage in the process.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raichu tends to struggle against opposing Electric-types, as they take mediocre damage from Surf while resisting Thunderbolt. Electabuzz tends to win one-on-one with Seismic Toss while being faster and threatening with paralysis. Opposing Raichu may also be equipped to win against your own depending on the set, with moves such as Seismic Toss and Hyper Beam further complicating matters for the electric rodent.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Raichu can't stomach Dugtrio's Earthquake if it's taken any amount of damage, and Dugtrio's 23.4% critical hit rate makes it an even more decisive matchup. However, if Raichu has set up Agility or if Dugtrio is switching in, Dugtrio has to risk getting hit with Surf, which 2HKOes it. This also means that Dugtrio has a lot of trouble beating Raichu if it's been paralyzed prior to the interaction. Body Slam is also a risk for Dugtrio, potentially paralyzing it and allowing Raichu to take it out if it's taken damage prior.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Surf provide Raichu with nigh-unresisted coverage, making it challenging to counter once it's in safely. Thunder Wave gives Raichu ample opportunity to spread paralysis for its teammates, which can be helpful for forcing out faster threats like Persian and Tentacruel. Agility enables Raichu to double its Speed, making it difficult to revenge kill or pin down with Wrap. This is very important, as, in RBY, boosting Speed allows Raichu to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. However, Body Slam can be used instead to paralyze threats like Dugtrio switching in and beat physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra.</p> <p>Raichu wants to set up Agility to sweep through weakened teams, and it should be kept healthy so Dugtrio cannot KO it after surviving Surf. As such, Raichu does best mid- or late-game. While setting up can be difficult in RBY UU at times, Raichu has a decent amount of freedom to set up Agility, as it can afford to take a hit if Dugtrio is absent or unable to survive Surf. Forcing out Pokemon like Omastar, which can't handle Raichu's coverage, can also allow Raichu to set up. Sleeping Pokemon can be fairly useful for Raichu to set up against; however, bulkier Pokemon like Hypno may be difficult if the sleep was induced by Rest, as Raichu can't KO it before it wakes up.</p> <p>Raichu tends to find points of entry through Wrap pivots like Tentacruel, ensuring safety from physical attacks. However, it can switch into weaker special attackers if necessary, as well as more passive Pokemon using recovery moves. Thanks to its Speed and coverage, it also makes a good revenge killer, especially after an Explosion, which usually softens up a threat for Raichu to consistently threaten the KO. On the flip side, Raichu's Speed can let it switch in on opposing Wrap, though with repeated switches it may take enough chip damage to enter KO range for strong physical attacks. This only gets worse if the Wrap user pivots out to a counter. Ergo, switching into Wrap even a few times severely limits Raichu's ability to take hits and check threats, so this risk should only be taken if heavy-hitting physical attackers like Dugtrio have been accounted for or removed, or if Raichu can reliably threaten to KO the Wrap user. Raichu finds itself on teams that benefit from its ability to check Rock- and Ground-types that threaten teammates like Dodrio and Persian, making them effective lures for said Rock- and Ground-types.</p>"

It also 6HKOes Exeggutor, but it is generally lacking in power, and Raichu would much rather run Submission or Seismic Toss. Hyper Beam 2HKOes Jynx and Alakazam and deals decent damage to other foes, such as Chansey and Jolteon. Agility can be used to outspeed faster foes, such as Alakazam, even if Raichu is paralyzed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor walls Raichu's usual coverage and threatens back with status and a strong Psychic. However, Exeggutor is outsped and dislikes taking paralysis.

      "overview": "<p>Sandslash falls into a strange spot in RBY PU. Since Nidoqueen is very common, it can be difficult to envision where Sandslash fits on a team, but its excellent Attack, physical bulk, and superior typing give it a distinct role and matchup spread. While Sandslash isn't a replacement for Nidoqueen, it can check foes that take advantage of Nidoqueen's lower damage output or hit it super effectively due to its terrible Poison typing, like Gastly, Porygon, Machamp, Graveler, Abra, and Drowzee. Gastly in particular is a notable matchup; Nidoqueen takes massive damage from Gastly's Psychic, but it only 4HKOes Sandslash. Sandslash also punishes Porygon's passivity; Porygon's Psychic is unlikely to break Substitute, and Sandslash can set up in front of it to break past its recovery and claim a KO. Sandslash's bulk also allows it to fight Fearow and Scyther effectively, much like Nidoqueen. Sandslash also counters Magneton, of course, letting it fill in for several of Nidoqueen's roles while improving matchups against foes with Psychic- and Ground-type moves.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Sandslash, most of the foes it checks effectively are somewhat niche or rarely seen, making its unique matchup spread wasted in most matches; the more common targets that it checks are also checked by Nidoqueen. Against typical foes, Sandslash's main flaws are its mediocre Speed and Special. It unfortunately struggles against Nidoqueen and Pinsir due to the Speed disadvantage, and many Water-types, such as Staryu and Seaking, also outrun it and threaten painful super effective attacks. Its Attack, while excellent, falls just short of some crucial benchmarks like 2HKOing Fearow, Porygon, and Dragonair, so a sweep is extremely unlikely without immense paralysis support and multiple turns of setup. It also struggles against Fire-types, since they outspeed it and threaten heavy damage and burn. That said, Sandslash does not need to set up to deal effective damage, and its combination of wallbreaking potential and ability to punish passivity with Swords Dance can create difficult games for the opponent. Sandslash, therefore, can fill a role over Nidoqueen on teams that need a Ground-type without the terrible weaknesses afforded by Poison typing, and it can be used over Graveler on teams where its Speed and setup opportunities are more beneficial. However, Sandslash is rare for a reason, and the other Ground-types have broader applicability.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandslash generally lacks other move choices. Slash can be used to cover for pivot attempts and can be used over Swords Dance or Substitute. Body Slam can be used instead of Substitute to fish for paralysis, but it deals relatively poor damage. Hyper Beam initially seems appealing, but Ground-resistant foes like Pinsir and Fearow are weak to Rock Slide anyway, so Sandslash has no reason to take this risk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Sandslash is outsped by Staryu and Seaking, which nearly OHKO it and can survive an Earthquake. Seaking can even set up Agility in front of Sandslash and still win the matchup. Staryu is frail, however, and cannot switch into a healthy Sandslash and win. While Omanyte cannot beat Sandslash one-on-one, it still deals heavy damage and can easily put Sandslash in range of any revenge killer.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Sandslash, which cannot OHKO Nidoqueen without a critical hit. Sandslash is capable of winning the matchup if it sets up Substitute or Swords Dance, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragonair</strong>: Dragonair outspeeds Sandslash and can chip it into range of other threats quickly with Wrap; two or three cycles of Wrap are generally enough to put it in range of Water-types, and a few more cycles put it in range of various Blizzard users, including Dragonair itself. Wrap also allows Dragonair to incentivize a set-up Sandslash to switch out to preserve its health, frustrating its attempt to make progress.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Sandslash struggles with most faster foes, as it only tenuously wins these matchups and is vulnerable to critical hits and burns. Arcanine and Rapidash both have a 38.2% chance to 2HKO Sandslash, which is exacerbated by their high critical hit chances and Fire Blast's burn chance. Magmar fares better with a 76.2% chance to 2HKO Sandslash, but Sandslash has a 43.6% chance to OHKO it in return; while this is a little better for Sandslash, it's still favorable for Magmar overall. Pinsir has a 53% chance to 3HKO Sandslash with Slash, and it can potentially use Bind or Hyper Beam to boost its odds; Sandslash can only 3HKO it in return with Rock Slide. Fearow cannot 3HKO Sandslash outright, but its excellent critical hit rate gives it passable odds to get lucky and win anyway, since Sandslash can only 3HKO it. All of these foes can also revenge kill Sandslash once it takes a hit or two.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake is Sandslash's main attacking option, as the only Pokemon that don't mind it—Fearow, Scyther, and Pinsir—are vulnerable to Rock Slide. After a Swords Dance, Sandslash deals immense damage, notably OHKOing every Fire- and Rock-type as well as Nidoqueen, Scyther, Staryu, and Drowzee; in fact, Sandslash 2HKOes or OHKOes every single Pokemon in the tier after a boost. Swords Dance also helps in some rare scenarios by reapplying Speed and Attack drops from paralysis and burn, respectively, as well as cancelling out burn on Sandslash if it happens to get burned. Substitute helps to facilitate setup and exploit switches or full paralysis, permitting Sandslash to use Swords Dance or begin attacking; since Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave and deals heavy damage to common sleepers, it becomes extremely difficult to stop once safely behind a Substitute. If Sandslash is able to set up both Swords Dance and Substitute, it becomes nearly impossible to stop.</p> <p>Sandslash generally functions as a mid-game attacker, exploiting Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt attempts from Gastly, Magneton, Drowzee, Abra, and Porygon to find entry then following up with Earthquake. Sandslash reliably beats both Psychic-types one-on-one, and Porygon cannot afford to trade hits with Sandslash, as its best-case scenario still leaves it too chipped to avoid a revenge kill; Porygon also often does not run Blizzard, leaving it with inadequate options to damage Sandslash. Gastly and Magneton, of course, are helpless against Sandslash; Gastly's Psychic is a mere 4HKO, leaving it imperiled when Sleep Clause is active, and Magneton has no good options to hit Sandslash, which can easily set up Substitute in front of it. Since Pinsir is rare and neither Fearow nor Scyther can beat Sandslash one-on-one, Sandslash can afford to simply use Earthquake and expect to make decent progress. Sandslash can also duel Fearow late-game to clear the way for teammates to finish the game. Sandslash, therefore, benefits from teammates that can spread paralysis and incentivize opposing Thunder Wave, such as Staryu and Porygon. It also appreciates allies that can chip down faster checks for it; Nidoqueen and Seaking, for example, can help to weaken Fearow and Fire-types for Sandslash to finish off later. Dragonair is notable for its combination of Thunder Wave and Wrap, which can paralyze checks on entry then grant Sandslash a free switch-in.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Sandslash is often overlooked in RBY OU, but it realizes a dangerous niche with its unique combination of typing, movepool, and Speed tier. After a Swords Dance, Sandslash can 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier, and it is just fast enough to outpace many crucial threats, including Rhydon, Chansey, and Exeggutor. It is frail in comparison to Rhydon and Golem and hits less hard, making it a poor pivot. However, it is faster, can sweep with Swords Dance, and beats the two one-on-one by virtue of its Ground neutrality. Its winning matchup against Rhydon, Electric immunity, and consistent STAB Earthquake make up for its lower offensive stats. In particular, its Thunder Wave immunity provides both a consistent entry point and a partial safeguard against sweep-ending paralysis, a weakness that plagues all other viable Swords Dance users. Unfortunately, Sandslash's lack of Normal and Flying resistances means it can't be a primary physical tank or a firm Zapdos answer, unlike Rhydon and Golem. It has low Speed, low Special, a plethora of weaknesses, and less Attack before setup, leaving it easily forced out and picked off. Most notably, Starmie can harry it in all stages of a battle. Unlike most other viable Swords Dance users, it misses the crucial OHKO on Chansey after a boost. Still, with paralysis support or against slower teams, Sandslash can be a potent offensive weapon while checking Rhydon, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Golem in emergencies.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandslash has other moves that seem appealing, but all of the legitimate options have already been discussed. Rest could theoretically help it defensively, but it's too slow and burdened by weaknesses. A traditional physical tank set would be outclassed by Rhydon, Kabutops, or even Snorlax. Slash is a good move, but Kabutops uses it better, and it has poor synergy with Swords Dance. Seismic Toss is simply too weak to use, even before setting up. Toxic discourages partial trapping and forces out Reflect users, but it's too fringe and has many better users. Sand Attack can fish for safe turns to survive attacks or set up, but it's an inconsistent gimmick to spend a moveslot on.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: All OU Ice-types can easily OHKO Sandslash. Cloyster is particularly threatening, as it outspeeds Sandslash and tanks its hits for easy momentum, though Blizzard only has about a 60% chance to OHKO from full health considering its accuracy. Further, Cloyster can get overburdened as a check to many threats, and lure options like Thunderbolt Tauros and Self-Destruct Snorlax can remove it. Lapras has less physical bulk and is outsped, making it vulnerable if worn down, but it can comfortably survive a +2 hit and always OHKO with Blizzard. Articuno and Jynx fold to boosted Rock Slide and Earthquake, respectively, but they outspeed and safely revenge kill Sandslash.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Although it requires the rare Hydro Pump to OHKO Sandlash without a critical hit, Starmie is nonetheless the most common impediment to a Sandslash sweep. Great Speed, high Special, and Recover all help Starmie check Sandslash consistently. It can have some difficulty switching in, though, as it detests being paralyzed by Body Slam and takes a solid chunk from Earthquake. Starmie also takes upwards of 74% from a +2 Earthquake, meaning Sandslash can often power through if Starmie is worn down or paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros tends to stop Sandslash dead in its tracks late-game by 2HKOing with Blizzard, serving as one of its biggest obstacles. However, it takes more than 60% from a +2 Earthquake, which can let the opposing Tauros easily win the vital mirror matchup. Oddball sets lacking Blizzard have a more difficult time, as Sandslash can sometimes survive two Body Slams into Hyper Beam. If Sandslash can boost to +4 Attack, it has good odds to OHKO Tauros with Earthquake or Submission, a feat that can often be game-deciding.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Although its improved matchup against Exeggutor is a major advantage of Sandslash over other Ground-types, it is far from guaranteed to win one-on-one. Hyper Beam misses, full paralysis from Stun Spore, and Mega Drain recovery can potentially let Exeggutor win. Even when Sandslash KOes Exeggutor, it often ends up paralyzed by Stun Spore or in Tauros's KO range. Exeggutor can, however, end up worn down throughout a match, letting Sandslash get past it more safely. In a pinch, +2 Body Slam into Hyper Beam will KO Exeggutor 84% of the time assuming both moves connect, while Earthquake or Rock Slide instead of Body Slam drops the odds to ~45% without the possibility of paralysis. If Exeggutor manages to switch into an unboosted Sandslash without taking heavy damage, the matchup shifts dramatically in Exeggutor's favor. Explosion and Mega Drain can also allow Exeggutor to force a direct trade. Beyond Exeggutor, Sandslash is completely vulnerable to Victreebel and Venusaur, being outsped and usually OHKOed while failing to OHKO either at +2, though neither enjoys switching in considering their neutrality to Earthquake and dislike of paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Fast Special Attackers</strong>: Alakazam can easily revenge kill weakened Sandslash, halting a sweep. Its prevalance in the lead matchup means it is often paralyzed, though, allowing Sandslash to OHKO it risk-free when set up. Jynx has a similar dynamic. Sandslash can try to set up on them late-game if they are paralyzed, especially with Substitute, but this is risky.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Sandslash is a shaky counter to Zapdos. It can't 2HKO Zapdos unboosted unless it runs Rock Slide, and it doesn't resist Drill Peck, making it significantly more vulnerable when switching in and after setting up. Other Flying-types have even better matchups, as Moltres threatens a burn and 2HKO with Fire Blast, while Articuno OHKOes Sandslash with just Ice Beam. Dragonite performs the best, as it is rarely OHKOed at +2 without the inferior Rock Slide, and Sandslash is both susceptible to Wrap and easily 2HKOed by Surf or Blizzard. Even niche Flying-types such as Dodrio and Gyarados can give Sandslash quite a bit of trouble. Rock Slide can substantially threaten these Pokemon, especially Moltres and Articuno, but neither are standard.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave but still vulnerable to Body Slam paralysis and Exeggutor's Stun Spore, both of which heavily diminish its effectiveness. Swords Dance can somewhat compensate for this if the foe is also paralyzed, as boosting will reapply the paralysis Speed drop, rendering the foe slower. That being said, losing its already-middling Speed tier is a death sentence with Sandslash's vulnerability to special attacks, especially considering the prevalence of Ice Beam and Blizzard on slow Pokemon like Chansey, Lapras, and even Snorlax. Even independent of the Speed drop, any full paralysis turns are particularly devastating for a sweeper.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is obligatory for Sandslash's niche. STAB Earthquake provides great neutral coverage and heavily chunks the majority of the metagame after a boost. If running Body Slam, Sandslash can use Body Slam + Hyper Beam for the best odds to 2HKO Exeggutor at +2—one of its most valuable advantages over Rhydon and Golem. Body Slam also allows Sandslash to fish for paralysis on its common switch-ins, which can help it or Tauros sweep late-game. Alternatively, Rock Slide can cover Flying-types and the rare Pinsir, but it's no stronger than Earthquake against Pokemon like Cloyster, Lapras, and Exeggutor. Furthermore, Body Slam into Hyper Beam still 2HKOes Zapdos at +2. Despite its poor accuracy, Submission allows Sandslash to OHKO on Tauros at +4 and can occasionally OHKO Chansey at +2 and Snorlax at +4. Tauros often spells the end of a Sandslash sweep, so Submission is a valuable option to consider. Substitute can be used over a coverage move, as it can afford Sandslash a free turn against a paralyzed foe, though it can be difficult to set up. Substitute further amplifies Sandslash's unique ability among Swords Dance users to defeat Zapdos, as Drill Peck only breaks it around 30% of the time, which may let Sandslash set up safely and sweep.</p> <p>Sandslash can effectively check most Rock- or Electric-types, but—with the exception of Jolteon—doing so will usually prevent it from sweeping late-game. Therefore, you must determine whether a trade or the potential for a sweep is more valuable. To stay healthy to sweep, Sandslash is best brought in on Thunder Wave, partial trapping pivots, or double switches rather than directly into attacks. It greatly benefits from being hidden until late-game when it is in a position to sweep. If Sandslash is forced onto the field before a sweep is likely, it should generally lead with Body Slam to chip and potentially paralyze its checks, as using Swords Dance is rarely useful before the opponent's team has been fully scouted. When saved until late-game, Sandslash can greatly benefit from an opportunity to boost to +4, which allows Earthquake to secure OHKOs on Chansey and Starmie and OHKO Tauros a majority of the time. Additionally, +4 Hyper Beam OHKOes Zapdos about 60% of the time and Exeggutor about 40% of the time, limiting their ability to impede a sweep. Be aware that calculations for +4 Hyper Beam assume it hits and doesn't critically hit, a combined 78.09% chance, so it's riskier in practice.</p> <p>Sandslash is at its most dangerous with paralysis support, and it has good synergy with many paralysis spreaders, including Zapdos, Starmie, Snorlax, and Chansey. The offensive prowess of Zapdos and Starmie in particular often forces paralysis on the opponent's team, either neutralizing foes like Jynx, Alakazam, and opposing Starmie or providing setup opportunities against slower foes like Chansey, Snorlax, and Exeggutor. Sandslash will then greatly enjoy coming in on these foes. In return, Sandslash can set up on and threaten the slow special tanks that limit them offensively, as well as effectively checking the Rock- and Electric- types that threaten them if a sweep seems infeasible. Its reduced physical tanking capabilities versus Rhydon and Golem and its Ice weakness make Cloyster an ideal defensive partner, and Sandslash feasts on the Thunderbolts Cloyster draws in. Additionally, Sandslash shares many switch-ins with Tauros, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Slowbro, Snorlax, and Starmie, so it often clears the way for a Tauros endgame even if it cannot sweep. Lastly, Sandslash is prone to being hamstrung by Body Slam paralysis, so Reflect Snorlax can also be effective to block that paralysis and generally help with physical tanking, despite its lower immediate physical bulk. In return, Sandslash threatens an immediate OHKO on Gengar and heavily pressures Rhydon and Golem, which can give mono-Normal Snorlax issues. Snorlax is also invaluable for drawing in, pressuring, and paralyzing Cloyster throughout a match, which is essential to Sandslash's success.</p>"

      "outdated": true,
      "overview": "<p>Sandslash is able to carve out a small niche in NU as the only fully evolved Ground-type that possesses Swords Dance and a neutrality to Earthquake. Thanks to its immunity to Thunder Wave, Sandslash can switch in more easily than other Swords Dance users, like Kingler and Pinsir, by predicting Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Electrode, Drowzee, and Mr. Mime. It further benefits from the coveted Earthquake + Rock Slide combination, alongside other key offensive moves like Substitute and Body Slam. Its Speed tier is also serviceable enough to outspeed key staples like Golem, Clefable, and Porygon. Lastly, Sandslash possesses good physical bulk, allowing it to combat physical attackers like Golem effectively. With paralysis support from Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Clefable, Sandslash can ravage the opposing team late-game.</p> <p>However, while having some use, Sandslash's Speed tier is still poor: the relevant Water-types of the tier, such as Kingler, Blastoise, Seadra, and Kabutops, will outspeed it, threatening significant damage before it can set up with Swords Dance. Ergo, they must be removed, severely weakened, or crippled for Sandslash to be effective. This usually causes it to rely on paralysis support, which many teams cannot afford to easily provide. Although Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave, paralysis from Body Slam, Stun Spore, or Glare cripples its chances to sweep late-game, exposing its poor special bulk and cutting into what Speed it does have. Lastly, it faces heavy competition as a Ground-type from Nidoking and Golem: the former has a much more flexible movepool, better Speed, and a Toxic immunity, while the latter has access to STAB Rock Slide, an important resistance to Fire, more immediate power, and Explosion.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Swords Dance is Sandslash's calling card, driving its Attack stat to terrifying levels. At +2, it can threaten OHKOs on Pokemon like Electrode, Mr. Mime, and Nidoking with Earthquake. Rock Slide complements Earthquake, providing unresisted coverage and securing OHKOs on Charizard and Moltres after a boost; it also hits Pinsir and Fearow hard. Body Slam discourages switch-ins from Poliwhirl and Blastoise, potentially paralyzing them. Alternatively, Substitute can exploit predicted switches and grants Sandslash more opportunities to set up, especially given its immunity to Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Sandslash has a surprisingly interesting movepool, making it quite customizable. Slash gives Sandslash immediate power and tears through Pokemon relying on Reflect, such as Abra and rare variants of Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Wigglytuff. Toxic prevents partial trappers like AgiliWrap Dragonair, Charizard, Moltres, and Rapidash from pinning it down. Submission is its best option against Clefable, Porygon, and Wigglytuff; however, the recoil, shaky accuracy, and lower damage than Earthquake against neutral targets make it a niche option at best. Hyper Beam is Sandslash's best move against Exeggcute and matches Earthquake’s power but fails to notably hit other targets.</p> <p>As a result of its typing and good physical bulk, Sandslash can pivot in against Electrode and Golem as well as Pokemon running Rest, such as Moltres and Blastoise, which let it also break holes in the opposition with Swords Dance. Since they let Sandslash set up, sleeping Pokemon are effectively left on the sidelines until it is eliminated. Pokemon carrying Thunderbolt, like Clefable, that can deter Water-types like Seadra and Blastoise from staying in allows Sandslash to set up more easily. Chip damage from Fire Spin users like Moltres, Rapidash, and Charizard, as well as Wrap from Dragonair, is also appreciated to help secure OHKOs after a Swords Dance, which makes Sandslash more difficult to deal with over the course of a game. Lastly, paralysis support from the likes of Electrode and Mr. Mime allows Sandslash to not only have more setup opportunities, but also to fish for full paralysis with Substitute and become even more lethal.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is a staple of PU and is considered mandatory on the vast majority of teams. Its high bulk, good offensive stats, and phenomenal coverage make it the best progress maker in the tier. Since Nidoqueen can 2HKO the majority of the metagame, getting it onto the field unscathed will almost always force the opponent to sacrifice a Pokemon or risk their switch-in taking massive damage, which usually leads to that switch-in losing anyways. Furthermore, Nidoqueen's immunity to Thunder Wave makes it very difficult to cripple without attacking directly. As a result, Nidoqueen is potent at capitalizing on double switches into slower Pokemon, especially those reliant on paralysis like Drowzee and Dragonair, as Nidoqueen usually beats them one-on-one and dissuades them from switching out. These traits also make it effective at removing paralyzed foes. Additionally, Nidoqueen is an excellent check to some of the tier's best offensive threats; it avoids a 2HKO from Fire Blast users and Pinsir and Scyther's Slash and also isn't KOed by Double Edge + Hyper Beam from Fearow, while it can 2HKO them back with super effective moves.</p> <p>However, while Nidoqueen's Speed tier defines PU, for this reason teams typically have no shortage of Pokemon that can outspeed it, leading to it being easily revenge killed. Nidoqueen's typing is far from ideal; as great as its Ground typing is, it has weaknesses to common attacks like Surf and Blizzard, while its useless Poison typing gives it weaknesses to Psychic and Earthquake. Nidoqueen's offensive presence isn't flawless either, as it can't 2HKO Porygon, which can heal off the damage with Recover, though it must be wary of critical hits. Despite its immunity to Thunder Wave, every relevant Thunder Wave user can hit it super effectively, limiting the utility of this trait. In spite of its limitations, Nidoqueen's ability to check so much of PU defines team compositions, and every team needs multiple checks to it to be competitive.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Surf OHKOes Graveler, though it has little use elsewhere. Body Slam can fish for paralysis, but Nidoqueen prefers raw damage over an inconsistent paralysis chance. Counter may seem useful for its ability punish foes that use Normal-type attacks, but since Nidoqueen already 2HKOes most foes, it doesn't allow any faster KOs. Nidoqueen's high physical bulk also means Counter will deal less damage compared to other users of the move. However, Counter can punish certain Pokemon after they get a KO, like Fearow, as even when they switch out, Nidoqueen can still use Counter to deal massive damage to the switch-in. Tail Whip can be used to allow Nidoqueen to 2HKO Porygon with Earthquake. While Nidoqueen will likely lose one-on-one if Porygon immediately uses Blizzard, Nidoqueen is favored to win if Porygon uses another move, such as Recover. However, Tail Whip has no use against any other Pokemon in PU, and Porygon can always switch out if it has a teammate that can tank an Earthquake. Initially, Rock Slide may seem like a useful coverage option, but Nidoqueen's Earthquake, Blizzard, and Fire Blast already 2HKO foes that are weak to Rock, leaving it only useful against irrelevant Pokemon like Butterfree. Submission may seem like an option to target Porygon, but it's only marginally stronger than Earthquake with the downsides of terrible accuracy and recoil, and it still fails to 2HKO, rendering it completely useless.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: None of Nidoqueen's attacks 2HKO Porygon, and it can heal off the damage with Recover and threaten Nidoqueen back with Ice-type coverage. However, it must be wary of critical hits, and Porygon loses its ability to consistently check Nidoqueen once paralyzed. Nidoqueen rarely runs Tail Whip, which lets Earthquake 2HKO Porygon, though Porygon is still favored to wint one-on-one when at high health.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: While it's outsped, Seaking is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and Thunderbolt, and it can 2HKO Nidoqueen with Surf. It can even set up Agility and still win one-on-one. Staryu outspeeds Nidoqueen and can 2HKO with Surf, though Earthquake and Thunderbolt 2HKO back, so Nidoqueen wins if Staryu gets paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: Given that Nidoqueen is often tasked with checking Fire-types, it's very susceptible to burns from Fire Blast. Once burned, Nidoqueen is unable to beat them and other foes that it relies on Earthquake to break through, like Omanyte and Drowzee. While these matchups were shaky before, a burned Nidoqueen has no hope of breaking through Porygon and Machamp. If it lacks Thunderbolt, a burned Nidoqueen also has no effective means to make a lasting impact against Staryu, and it struggles to deal significant damage to other Water-types, like Seaking and Slowpoke.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Abra outspeeds and 2HKOes Nidoqueen with Psychic, while Nidoqueen only has a 12.8% chance to OHKO back with Earthquake. While they usually lose one-on-one, faster foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, Magmar, Fearow, and Pinsir can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Nidoqueen. Pinsir is notable as while it loses one-on-one, it can easily switch into Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Nidoqueen 4HKOes Machamp, while it can 2HKO with Earthquake, forcing a teammate to switch into Machamp's powerful Body Slam or Earthquake. However, due to its lack of recovery, Machamp cannot check Nidoqueen long-term.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Inducers</strong>: Poliwag and Gastly outspeed Nidoqueen and can put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Poliwag can then use Nidoqueen as setup fodder with Amnesia or 2HKO with Hydro Pump, while Gastly can 2HKO Nidoqueen with Psychic. However, their abysmal bulk and reliance on an inaccurate move mean Nidoqueen can get past them with some luck, as it 2HKOes the former and OHKOes the latter. While slower, bulkier sleepers like Vileplume and Weepinbell can easily tank a hit and attempt to put Nidoqueen to sleep with Sleep Powder; Vileplume is notably not 2HKOed by any of Nidoqueen's attacks.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "The Queen": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>This set gives Nidoqueen perfect coverage, allowing it to deal significant damage to any foe. Earthquake is Nidoqueen's strongest attack against neutral targets, and it's incredibly safe to use, since nothing resists Earthquake without also taking super effective damage from one of Nidoqueen's coverage moves. Additionally, it 2HKOes prominent foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, and opposing Nidoqueen. Blizzard 2HKOes every Flying- and Ground-type besides Nidoqueen itself. Thunderbolt hits Water-types super effectively—it 2HKOes the rare Slowpoke, but it doesn't do significantly more damage than Earthquake to foes like Staryu and Seaking. It's best used to ease prediction, as opponents may try to switch in Fearow or Scyther to take an Earthquake aimed at their Water-type, or if Nidoqueen is burned, as without Thunderbolt it would struggle to damage Water-types. It also helps against the rare Mirror Move Fearow, as a copied Blizzard does significant damage to Nidoqueen. Substitute  eases prediction against foes switching out, and it can exploit attempted sacrifices, which commonly happen once Nidoqueen gets in. However, it's advised not to recklessly use Substitute, as it can cut into Nidoqueen's bulk and make it lose some matchups. For example, setting up a single Substitute leaves Nidoqueen with a 74.2% chance to be 2HKOed by Rapidash and Arcanine's Fire Blast. After losing two Substitutes, it is OHKOed by Nidoqueen's Earthquake. Fire Blast is used to 2HKO Pinsir, which is one the few viable Pokemon that doesn't mind Earthquake or Blizzard. It also lets Nidoqueen fish for burns, which can punish physical attackers like Machamp and Fearow trying to switch in.</p> <p>Nidoqueen should be used on almost every team. It's often used as a mid-game progress maker, as it's fantastic at breaking down the opponent's defenses, priming a cleaner like Fearow or Seaking for an endgame sweep. While it's rarely a team's best option, it can also check offensive threats like Rapidash, Arcanine, Fearow, and Scyther. It can switch into them after they get a KO and force them to stay in as it revenge kills them, eliminating a major threat to its team. Thunder Wave users, like Staryu and Drowzee, are the most effective form of support for Nidoqueen; paralysis mitigates Nidoqueen's mediocre Speed and ruins its single consistent long-term check: Porygon. Machamp is another Pokemon that can consistently switch in and beat Nidoqueen, but it lacks recovery and cannot repeatedly switch in. While Nidoqueen isn't helpless against it, a check like Fearow or Pinsir can handle Machamp. Staryu and Seaking pose issues to Nidoqueen thanks to their Water STAB, so checks to them, like Drowzee for the former and one's own Staryu for the latter, work well. Nidoqueen is a strong lead, being among the few Pokemon that can beat Arcanine one-on-one while not being easy to switch into. However, it tends to take significant damage taking on Arcanine, often losing to critical hits or burns.</p>"

Moreover, it can freely pivot into an incoming Toxic, as well as Electric-type attacks like Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt from Electabuzz and Haunter, giving it some decent defensive utility. With adequate paralysis support from Pokemon like Hypno and careful play, Nidoking can feasibly work.</p> <p>However, Nidoking comes with an egregious problem: its typing. Poison and Ground are among the worst possible defensive types in the game, making it weak to the many Water-, Ice-, Ground-, and Psychic-type attacks in the tier, and its Speed only worsens this situation. Therefore, despite its seemingly powerful offensive presence, it can hardly ever switch in because it struggles with so many metagame staples, namely Tentacruel, Hypno, Dragonite, Gyarados, and Articuno. Nidoking also struggles with damage output at many points, causing it to fail to even OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard. Ergo, on competitive RBY UU teams, Nidoking is often passed over in favor of better Ground-types, such as Dugtrio.</p>",

Alternatively, Submission can let Nidoking 2HKO Raticate, as well as 3HKO Persian and Kangaskhan.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Nidoking manages to find a niche in the Stadium OU metagame as a mixed sweeper thanks to Focus Energy. The move boosts its critical hit rate to a fearsome 62%, which, alongside its perfect coverage and decent attacking stats to back them up, allows it to deal huge damage. In addition, Nidoking has a solid Speed tier that enables it to outpace everything up to Articuno. Its typing isn't entirely without merit, either, as it walls Jolteon and grants it an important immunity to Thunder Wave, a trait that is unique among viable Focus Energy users.</p> <p>Nidoking has its drawbacks, though. Its horrid defensive typing burdens it with weaknesses to Psychic, Ice, and Ground and leaves it without a resistance to Flying, making it a shakier Zapdos check than Rhydon and Golem. To make matters worse, it's outsped by metagame staples such as Alakazam, Starmie, and Tauros, all of which 2HKO Nidoking. This fragility makes paralysis support a necessity to get the most out of Nidoking. On that note, while Nidoking itself is immune to Thunder Wave, it still hates paralysis and can be crippled by Body Slam or Stun Spore. Additionally, Nidoking is unreliable, as it requires setup and, even after setting up, scoring a critical hit is inconsistent. Nevertheless, with the proper support, it can be an effective addition to a team.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Focus Energy significantly boosts Nidoking's critical hit rate, making it very difficult to switch into. Earthquake is Nidoking's most powerful attack; it needs just one critical hit to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Starmie and Chansey. Nidoking 2HKOes Tauros and Snorlax as well if it scores two critical hits, but it only has a 38.4% chance to do so. Blizzard is necessary in the third moveslot, as it gives Nidoking the best shot at muscling through Rest Exeggutor before it can retaliate. It has other uses besides this; a critical hit is guaranteed to OHKO Rhydon and Golem and will usually let Nidoking 2HKO Zapdos, and it has a small freeze chance, letting it KO Pokemon it normally would not be able to as a last resort. Finally, with a single critical hit, Thunderbolt 2HKOes Slowbro and OHKOes the rare Cloyster after a little chip damage.</p> <p>For Nidoking to fulfill its role effectively, it should be kept away from damage and status whenever possible, and faster Pokemon such as Alakazam and Starmie should be paralyzed before it attempts to set up for a sweep. This is easier said than done due to Team Preview, meaning your opponent will know that you have Nidoking on your team and will try to keep these Pokemon as healthy as is feasible so they can keep it in check. Getting Nidoking on the field is not a simple task either due to its horrific defensive typing allowing it to be hit for super effective damage by most metagame staples, but it still has some decent opportunities to switch in and set up with Focus Energy. The most obvious would be the aforementioned Jolteon, which is unable to do anything meaningful to it. Once again, though, your opponent will be aware of Nidoking and will be able to prepare for it by switching out. Another good chance to switch in is on a predicted Rest from Pokemon like Exeggutor. There is also an element of risk here, as most Rest users can predict the switch and deal major damage with their coverage moves, preventing Nidoking from setting up.</p> <p>Slowbro and Starmie are good partners for Nidoking, as they resist Ice, Psychic, and Water and provide paralysis support for it. Slowbro in particular is adept at drawing in enemy Starmie to paralyze it. In return, Nidoking can protect them from Electric-type moves. Exeggutor is another Pokemon that can spread paralysis, but it differentiates itself from Slowbro and Starmie with a handy resistance to Ground that can make the Rhydon matchup easier.</p> <p>Thanks to its immense movepool, Nidoking has plenty of room for customization. Substitute can be used in order to protect it from status and critical hits, but it can be difficult to set up alongside Focus Energy, and it puts Nidoking in OHKO range of Rhydon, Alakazam, and Exeggutor. Ice Beam is a more accurate alternative to Blizzard, but it requires an additional critical hit to 2HKO Exeggutor and almost never OHKOes Rhydon and Golem even with a critical hit. Thunder has poor accuracy, but it can be used instead of Thunderbolt; the greater power allows a critical hit to OHKO Cloyster and KO Starmie and Slowbro after minimal chip damage. Body Slam can paralyze switch-ins like Starmie. Rock Slide OHKOes the rare Articuno and Moltres with a critical hit, but Nidoking is OHKOed and 2HKOed by their Blizzard and Fire Blast and requires paralysis support to reliably outspeed them. Surf reliably KOes Rhydon and Golem without needing a critical hit if they are not at full health and has perfect accuracy, but it is inferior to Blizzard otherwise.</p>"

      "outdated": true,
      "overview": "<p>Nidoking is the most diverse threat in RBY NU and boasts several key strengths that differentiate it from other mid-game attackers. Nidoking has the best coverage in the tier and boasts super effective coverage for nearly every foe, as well as STAB Earthquake for powerful neutral damage. Its Electric immunity grants it entry against opposing Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt users, blessing Nidoking with a variety of effective entry points. For example, one's own Mr. Mime or Clefable often baits in and paralyzes their opposing counterpart, after which Nidoking can switch into the predicted Thunder Wave and threaten them heavily. This immunity additionally makes Nidoking a hard counter to Electrode, helping to protect teams from a surprise sweep and exploiting Electrode for free turns. Nidoking can clean up endgames against the tier's various Water-types and Golem due to its superior Speed, 2HKOing Kingler, Kabutops, and Golem before they are able to 2HKO back.</p> <p>Despite these advantages, Nidoking's typing is a double-edged sword and its Speed leaves it vulnerable to Mr. Mime and Venomoth. Nidoking's Poison typing adds weaknesses to Psychic and Earthquake, making nearly all of Nidoking's matchups risky for both sides, as every top Pokemon in NU has at least one super effective attack against it. Nidoking competes with Golem for a teamslot, in particular missing out on Golem's superior typing. Golem's Rock typing grants it useful Normal and Fire resistances as well as STAB on Rock Slide, whereas Nidoking misses the OHKO against Charizard. Also, Nidoking will leave even victorious fights at low HP, and this is where its imperfect Speed becomes noticeable, as Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and all Fire-types can revenge kill it with ease. Venomoth especially punishes an early Nidoking entry, as it is only 3HKOed by Earthquake, allowing it to switch in, gain massive momentum with Sleep Powder, and then threaten Stun Spore on the switch.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Nidoking's other options all end up surprisingly lacking. Substitute initially looks appealing, but Nidoking's lower bulk means that after using Substitute twice, it is in OHKO range of most of the tier, unlike Golem. Body Slam can potentially paralyze, but this is unreliable and it deals poor damage compared to every other option. Thunder's power allows it to rarely secure 2HKOs that Thunderbolt misses, but the odds are extremely low; its best feat is a 42% chance to 2HKO Seadra after considering accuracy. Overall, the loss in consistency often leaves Nidoking in a far worse position than simply using Thunderbolt. Fire Blast seems like it could cover Venomoth, but it only has a 40% chance to 2HKO and otherwise provides very little. Finally, Submission to hit Clefable is useless, as it has only slightly more power than Earthquake with far worse accuracy. Any of these options create exploitable holes in Nidoking's coverage and should not be considered.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Venomoth</strong>: Venomoth is perhaps the premier Nidoking check, easily landing sleep in retaliation if Nidoking secures an early-game KO. Venomoth also outspeeds and 3HKOes Nidoking while being one of the few Pokemon to be only 3HKOed back, allowing Venomoth to stop Nidoking even late-game. Nidoking also essentially cannot switch into Venomoth, as Stun Spore leaves it ineffective and Double-Edge often leaves it in range of a Psychic 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Mr. Mime</strong>: Mr. Mime outspeeds and 2HKOes Nidoking, which can't OHKO back. Mr. Mime cannot switch in, but unparalyzed Mr. Mime easily revenge kills Nidoking and is difficult to switch into itself, shifting the momentum from Nidoking's team with a successful entry. Nidoking should not revenge kill early-game due to the threat of Mr. Mime revenge killing it, even when facing Venomoth-less teams.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable is slower than Nidoking, but Blizzard 2HKOes and Nidoking can only 3HKO. Also, Body Slam can paralyze Nidoking as it tries to enter, hamstringing it permanently.</p> <p><strong>Seadra and Blastoise</strong>: Both Seadra and Blastoise are 3HKOed by Thunderbolt while 2HKOing in return. Seadra notably Speed ties Nidoking and can set up Agility to ensure it can use another attack after KOing Nidoking. Blastoise can check Nidoking in a pinch, though its utility as a check to other Pokemon means it will rarely want to take this fight. It also cannot switch in and win, as it is slower than Nidoking.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: A number of fast Pokemon can check Nidoking given its propensity for taking heavy damage when trading hits. Charizard and Moltres can switch into Earthquake and outspeed Nidoking, with Moltres even 2HKOing it with Fire Blast. Charizard normally needs mild chip damage or a critical hit in order to win one-on-one, but it can also win with a Fire Spin or two, though this is an uncommon set. Raticate has a 51% chance to 2HKO with Super Fang + Hyper Beam, while Nidoking only has a 23.5% chance to 2HKO with Earthquake, and after a mere 8% chip damage, the 2HKO becomes guaranteed. Ninetales and Fearow can defeat Nidoking after approximately 15-20% chip damage as well.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Earthquake is Nidoking's strongest move, particularly against Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Kabutops, as well as an effective midground option to cover most switches. Thunderbolt covers the Water-types of the tier, 3HKOing Blastoise and Seadra and 2HKOing the others, while also dealing decent damage to Charizard or Moltres. Blizzard 2HKOes Golem and Exeggcute while also covering Flying-type switches, acting as a generally safe midground option. Rock Slide provides a 2HKO against Charizard and Moltres, both of which are too bulky for Blizzard or Thunderbolt to 2HKO; Charizard is KOed by either Blizzard or Thunderbolt followed by Rock Slide, while Moltres generally requires two Rock Slides to 2HKO. While the overlapping coverage may seem like overkill, Nidoking can at worst 3HKO every single Pokemon in NU with this set, and the overlapping coverage usually makes it near-impossible to safely switch into Nidoking.</p> <p>Utilizing Nidoking effectively requires an awareness of how and when to get it into battle, as well as knowing how to utilize midground options to cover switches without giving up KOs. Nidoking can effectively enter battle when opposing Mr. Mime or Clefable is likely to use Thunder Wave or Thunderbolt. As these Pokemon often trade hits with their opposing counterparts, only to be revenge killed after, it is important to set up mismatched situations: for example, getting your own Mr. Mime in on Blastoise to incentivize the opponent to switch their Mr. Mime or Clefable into paralysis. This allows you to switch Nidoking into their retaliatory Thunder Wave. Nidoking can also enter to revenge kill targets such as Water-types, Golem, and Clefable regardless of whether they're paralyzed, especially later in the game when sleep is no longer a concern. Once Nidoking enters battle, the opponent is pressured to either sacrifice their current Pokemon to chip Nidoking or to try to find a relatively safe switch, such as getting Mr. Mime in against a special attack or Charizard in against Earthquake. For example, Nidoking can 2HKO Kabutops with either two Earthquakes or Thunderbolt + Earthquake; the former provides safe entry to Charizard, while Thunderbolt allows Mr. Mime in to force Nidoking out. Knowing Nidoking's KO ranges and the opponent's switch options allows it to heavily punish desperate switches while still securing KOs if the foe stays in.</p> <p>Nidoking partners well with Mr. Mime, as mentioned, and other paralysis spreaders such as Clefable and Venomoth work the same way. Besides baiting opposing Thunder Wave, they also slow foes down for Nidoking. Exeggcute can also create mismatches by checking Mr. Mime, and it may even paralyze an additional foe as Mr. Mime switches out or use Explosion to grant Nidoking a perfect entry point. It also pairs well with Water-types such as the ubiquitous Blastoise, which baits Electric-type moves late-game and helps to chip down bulkier foes, such as Blastoise and Charizard, for Nidoking to later remove; in return, Nidoking helps to insulate Water-types from a potential Electrode sweep and finish KOs for them. Blastoise and Kingler also often find opportunities to catch switches with Body Slam, potentially paralyzing more opponents.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Clefable is generally considered good in the current metagame</p> <hr /> <p>Clefable succeeds in RBY UU as a strong early-game offensive threat with great unpredictability and versatility, possessing an incredible movepool with Thunder Wave, STAB Body Slam, Thunderbolt, Blizzard, Counter, Sing, and more. With respectable bulk in tow, Clefable will incapacitate many Pokemon in some form before it goes down; this bulk also helps it take Wrap decently well, letting it stay in and punish misses with Thunder Wave in a tight spot. Furthermore, Clefable has coverage for every Pokemon in the tier, letting it fine-tune itself for a team and punish switch-ins if they get paralyzed prior; still, it won't have the right move for every situation at once.</p> <p>However, because of its low Speed, Clefable often finds itself getting easily worn down by wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite. Additionally, it is near-effortless to revenge kill with strong attackers that aren't normally even fast enough to revenge kill, such as Hypno, and critical hits don't help. This is compounded by a lack of recovery and resistances, causing it to sometimes struggle as a defensive team piece. Because Clefable provides inconsistent defensive utility and not quite elite offensive pressure, it is often outcompeted by other early-game wallbreakers like Kangaskhan. Regardless of this, Clefable pairs well alongside many Pokemon in the tier—particularly other Normal-types, Kadabra, and Articuno—for its support movepool, which backs its offensive pressure extremely well.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clefable has among the most customizable movesets in the game. Generally, Clefable should always use Body Slam and usually Thunder Wave so it can incapacitate any one foe, but the rest of its moveset is fair game to alter.</p> <p>Counter is the most notable choice, as Clefable can easily switch in on Persian's Slash and force it out with the threat of Thunder Wave, thereby allowing Counter to massively damage the switch-in. This situation can similarly be applied to Body Slam uses from Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Additionally, switching in on a predicted Hyper Beam can allow Counter Clefable to deal massive damage. Counter is easily played around once revealed, but it only needs to succeed once for Clefable to do its job.</p> <p>Mega Kick deals more damage than Body Slam and doesn't require a recharge turn like Hyper Beam, allowing Clefable to 2HKO Tentacruel and Hypno, but the accuracy can lead to Clefable taking extra damage that it can't always afford. Sing is a fair surprise option that lets Clefable compress roles on a team, but repeated misses allow foes to wear it down quickly. Rest lets Clefable attempt to stay healthy throughout a game, and the abundance of Wrap can let it burn sleep turns. However, due to a complete lack of resistances, it is difficult to safely wake up against anything but Wrap, often making Clefable less consistent. Furthermore, a sleeping Clefable is ripe for exploitation from the likes of Tentacruel and Dugtrio. Reflect can be used to take minimal chip damage from Dragonite's Wrap, even PP stalling it when combined with Rest. It can also make Clefable more effective against the powerful Kangaskhan and Dodrio. However, it's ineffective against Pokemon that use Slash, such as Persian and Pinsir, and Tentacruel can 3HKO Clefable with Surf, so it can be difficult to fit into sets. Light Screen lets Thunderbolt Clefable muscle past Articuno, cutting off the monumental power of Articuno's Blizzard.</p> <p>Clefable has a surfeit of additional coverage options that can be situationally justified. Fire Blast 3HKOes Articuno and potentially incapacitates Kangaskhan and Dragonite switch-ins with burns. It can also 2HKO the rare Pinsir, which otherwise has an amazing matchup against Clefable. Thunder or Ice Beam can be used over Thunderbolt and Blizzard, but Thunder doesn't improve Clefable's KO ranges by much and Ice Beam's PP increase fails to make up for its damage output. Submission allows Clefable to 3HKO Persian and is its best option against opposing Clefable, but it has little use outside of this; Dewgong and Kangaskhan are damaged more by Thunderbolt and Blizzard, respectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Wrappers like Dragonite, Tentacruel, and Pinsir wear Clefable down, exploiting its vulnerability to sustained offensive pressure, before switching to a Pokemon that can KO it like Kangaskhan. Dragonite is particularly effective, as its Wrap deals up to 5% per turn. If AgiliWrap Dragonite sets up prior to fighting Clefable, Clefable struggles mightily to stop it, as it fails to OHKO with Blizzard and usually has to resort to Thunder Wave. Tentacruel can gradually choke it out with Wrap before KOing it with Surf. However, Clefable's bulk increases the chance of an eventual miss—and taking crippling paralysis in return. On the other hand, Swords Dance or repeated critical hits can drastically quicken the process. While rare, Pinsir has Swords Dance + Bind, which lets it swiftly bring Clefable down and KO it from around 85% with +2 Hyper Beam; it can also use +2 Submission after even less damage. The similarly rare Moltres chips Clefable down quickly with Fire Spin while dealing massive damage with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Sleepers</strong>: Clefable is slow and used early-game, so it often risks taking sleep. Common faster Pokemon like Venusaur, Haunter, and Hypnosis Hypno often force it to sacrifice itself or switch out. Clefable can't consistently trade with them either; Venusaur is not likely to be 2HKOed by Blizzard, Haunter is only remotely scared by Psychic, and Hypno has enough bulk and special attacking prowess to make the matchup inconsistent at best.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno outspeeds and 3HKOes Clefable with its nuclear Blizzard, while Clefable needs Fire Blast or Light Screen to stand a realistic chance in a flat one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Omastar switches into Blizzard Clefable, while Golem handles Thunderbolt variants, and both deal heavy damage with STAB moves. While Aerodactyl is Rock-type and shrugs off Clefable without either move, it loses to Blizzard and Thunderbolt alike, making it a non-issue for most Clefable sets. All Rock-types are excellent Hyper Beam absorbers as well.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Vaporeon and Dewgong outspeed Clefable and threaten it with 3HKOs. However, both take massive damage from Thunderbolt in the process, and they become dicey answers if paralyzed. Notably, Dewgong is 3HKOed by Clefable's Thunderbolt itself, and Hyper Beam Clefable can KO Vaporeon after two Thunderbolt uses first. Poliwrath is faster and can put Clefable to sleep with Hypnosis; it also possesses Submission to 2HKO Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: Because Clefable excels when it's using its Normal-type STAB moves, it can take mortal damage from the rare Counter. Pokemon such as Poliwrath, opposing Clefable, Kangaskhan, and Hypno are sometimes seen using the move. A notable way to trap Clefable is by switching one of these Pokemon in on Hyper Beam and using Counter as Clefable recharges.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Offensive Utility": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set lets Clefable succeed as a strong early-game attacker, providing ample paralysis support while trading with common early-game Psychic-types like Kadabra and Hypno. Because of Clefable's bulk and Thunder Wave, it will typically incapacitate foes in a one-on-one fight. Staying in against repeated Wrap uses before crippling the opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave is a viable—albeit risky—strategy, as its physical bulk makes it take minimal chip damage. STAB Body Slam deals sizable damage and threatens to paralyze any would-be switch-in. Hyper Beam is very powerful, KOing Pokemon like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, Persian, and even Hypno from around half HP; a critical hit Body Slam prior can often put these Pokemon in range for Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Clefable's special coverage move should be chosen based on what the team is lacking. Thunderbolt covers Water-types, 3HKOing Poliwrath, Dewgong, and Omastar as well as 2HKOing Gyarados. Blizzard 2HKOes Dodrio, Dragonite, Tangela, and Golem; it is also Clefable's best option for Kangaskhan and Venusaur. Psychic is the best against Haunter, 3HKOing it, though Special drops can improve this. Additionally, it can 3HKO Tentacruel with a Special drop, though Thunderbolt is comparably effective against it.</p> <p>Clefable can be a difficult Pokemon to bring in, primarily due to its low Speed causing it to get worn down quickly. It's best brought in through Wrap or double switching on Kadabra or Electabuzz, common sights for their Speed and special offense; Kadabra is a particularly big target, as Clefable 2HKOes it with Body Slam. Because they lack the firepower to break past Clefable and it threatens them with paralysis in return, it's easy for Clefable to gain momentum. These Pokemon can be easily drawn in through early-game use of Tentacruel; for instance, leading with Wrap Tentacruel regularly draws Kadabra in right away and gives Clefable a free switch. Clefable can heavily punish Pokemon by predicting Rest—particularly from Tentacruel and Hypno—as it can easily 3HKO both with Body Slam twice followed by Hyper Beam. In respect to Hypno, Clefable is very capable of switching in via Wrap pivoting and denting it enough to the point that it can be traded with. Kadabra, Tentacruel, and, to a lesser extent, Electabuzz are all extremely common early-game Pokemon that can be regularly lured in through your own Kadabra, Tentacruel, or Hypno; Kadabra and Hypno can force Tentacruel to use Rest through paralysis and super effective damage, while Hypno is forced in through prolonged mirror matches. Dugtrio is also a good opportunity for Clefable to come in, as it fails to 3HKO without critical hits and gets threatened with Body Slam paralysis or severe damage from Blizzard. Dugtrio regularly switches in on predicted Thunder Wave uses, so consider double switching to Clefable from a damaged Kadabra, Electabuzz, Dragonite, or Hypno.</p> <p>Clefable can be used as a lead, as it forces Tentacruel to pivot with Wrap by the threat of Thunder Wave, threatens non-Hypnosis Hypno, and shrugs off Kadabra's Thunder Wave. In the event the opponent is using a slower team, such as one featuring Tangela or multiple bulky Water-types like Omastar, lead Kadabra may even switch out. However, Clefable can often be more threatening outside of the lead slot because of its ability to pummel paralyzed Pokemon, and Pokemon like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, and Kadabra often perform more favorably as leads. Because of Clefable's low Speed, paralysis inducers such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, and the omnipresent Hypno are excellent partners for making it a late-game threat. They also become much more threatening once Clefable has beaten or traded with an opposing Psychic-type. Clefable also strongly benefits special attackers like Articuno, as it normally dents specially bulky Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Kadabra; Articuno can finish them off while taking out physically bulky Pokemon like Kangaskhan. Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dragonite appreciate Clefable's paralysis support, which makes up for their lower Speed, while being able to wallbreak alongside it. Thunderbolt Clefable is also helpful for Dragonite in particular, as it hits the Water-types that frequently run Blizzard.</p>"

Hyper Beam is an extremely powerful move to pick off a weakened Pokemon when other attacks can't. Thunderbolt can hit some Water-types, such as Starmie and Slowbro, moderately hard, while Thunder Wave is a more reliable move than Body Slam for spreading paralysis.

Alternatively, Counter can bounce back physical attacks, particularly the very common Body Slam, to inflict some good damage off Clefable's decent HP. Thunderbolt complements Blizzard well for type coverage by hitting the Water-types that resist Ice-type attacks.

However, Clefable is one of the best Pokemon available, and Wigglytuff can do many of the same things, so Wigglytuff can be used alongside it as a second, more limited Clefable. Compared to Clefable, Wigglytuff has equally strong STAB moves and similar utility in Thunder Wave but slightly less bulk and very weak coverage moves due to its poor Special stat. In particular, Wigglytuff can be used as a response to the opposing Clefable, or in some cases as a response to Mr. Mime, allowing your own Clefable to be used for other things rather than being locked into a Clefable mirror. However, devoting a slot to Wigglytuff comes at a significant cost, since NU is an extremely centralized metagame. Using Wigglytuff leaves you with an overall slower team and generally means forgoing either Charizard or a different late-game sweeper, such as Seadra, Raticate, Electrode, or Kingler. Wigglytuff performs quite consistently when it is used, but the limitations it imposes on teambuilding are not always worth it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Bubble Beam provides a guaranteed 2HKO on Golem and a 33% Speed drop chance, but dropping Body Slam for Bubble Beam leaves Wigglytuff without a good move to threaten Nidoking; dropping Seismic Toss for Bubble Beam leaves Wigglytuff walled by Kabutops. Counter can potentially deal massive damage; however, Wigglytuff's opportunities to use Counter are typically limited to specific Pokemon such as Raticate, Wigglytuff, and rare targets like Primeape and Pinsir. Clefable does more damage to it with Blizzard than Body Slam anyway, and Wigglytuff does not force many switches. Thunderbolt can be used to avoid Blastoise’s Counter, 3HKO Kabutops, and rarely 2HKO Kingler; however, if Kabutops switches into either Body Slam or Hyper Beam, then Seismic Toss will 3HKO it, making it comparable to Thunderbolt. Wigglytuff is also not too threatened by Blastoise’s Counter due to its high HP stat, taking less than 50% from a Counter on Seismic Toss. Sing is a potential option, but it is not a very good one due to its 55% accuracy and Wigglytuff’s abysmal Speed. However, since Wigglytuff can be effective enough with just Thunder Wave, Seismic Toss, and Hyper Beam, Sing can be used in the fourth moveslot for niche matchups, such as against opposing Wigglytuff, and as a desperation play in an otherwise losing game.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Nidoking can switch into Wigglytuff's Thunder Wave and usually defeat it, outspeeding and 3HKOing it with Earthquake while avoiding a 2HKO from any combination of moves. However, Nidoking does not want to switch into Body Slam or Blizzard. Conversely, Golem has little to fear from a Body Slam + Seismic Toss Wigglytuff and can similarly switch into its Thunder Wave, but it risks losing the Speed tie and being 2HKOed by Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Wigglytuff is 3HKOed by any STAB Fire Blast, aside from Moltres's which usually 2HKOes. A burn also makes Wigglytuff unable to use its STAB Hyper Beam effectively. However, Fire-types generally hate being paralyzed by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Kabutops can switch into Hyper Beam and take advantage of the recharge turn to either boost with Swords Dance or simply KO a weakened Wigglytuff, depending on the situation. Golem can also switch into Hyper Beam and either set up a Substitute or attack with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Sleep</strong>: Because of its poor Speed, Wigglytuff can be vulnerable to Pokemon with sleep-inducing moves, such as Venomoth or even Sing Clefable. However, sleep inducers do not want to switch into Thunder Wave, and Venomoth does not want to switch into Body Slam.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Thunder Wave should always be used to help compensate for Wigglytuff's poor Speed and to ensure Charizard cannot set up in front of it, as Wigglytuff cannot 2HKO it. It is also generally useful due to the fast pace of matches, and it gives a bulky Pokemon, such as Wigglytuff itself, extra chances to get an advantage from full paralysis. STAB Hyper Beam is by far Wigglytuff’s most powerful move; it has a decent chance to KO Mr. Mime after a Body Slam or Seismic Toss, it is generally a good option against weakened foes, and it is a good final attack right before Wigglytuff is KOed. Seismic Toss is Wigglytuff’s most spammable move, 3HKOing Mr. Mime and 4HKOing everything other than opposing Wigglytuff. Due to Wigglytuff’s middling Attack, poor Special, and low critical hit rate, alternative moves aside from Hyper Beam rarely deal significantly more damage anyway. Seismic Toss also helps to ensure Wigglytuff does not become useless if burned.</p> <p>Body Slam is often the preferred fourth move, enabling Wigglytuff to threaten Nidoking with paralysis and providing a second spammable move alongside Seismic Toss, making Wigglytuff less predictable. In particular, being able to use Body Slam to threaten paralysis rather than depending on Thunder Wave makes it more difficult for Nidoking to switch in for free. On the other hand, using a Body Slam + Seismic Toss set makes the Golem matchup difficult, since Golem is immune to Thunder Wave, Speed ties Wigglytuff, and avoids a 3HKO from Seismic Toss even after a Body Slam. Blizzard is Wigglytuff’s best coverage option for Golem without compromising the Nidoking matchup; it 2HKOes Golem about half the time, and it also deals 38% minimum to Nidoking, leaving it in range of Blastoise’s Surf or Mr. Mime’s Psychic. However, note that Blizzard does minimal damage against neutral targets due to Wigglytuff’s poor Special, so it leaves Wigglytuff very reliant on Seismic Toss.</p> <p>Wigglytuff can be used as a lead, since it has a very favorable matchup against Mr. Mime and an acceptable matchup against Charizard while preventing Venomoth from switching in safely due to Thunder Wave and STAB Body Slam. Alternatively, Clefable can be used in the lead slot for its ability to 2HKO Charizard with Blizzard and similarly favorable Mr. Mime matchup, and it can also use Psychic to threaten Venomoth; in this case, Wigglytuff should be used to provide the team with a bulky Thunder Wave user and Clefable check. Outside of the lead, Wigglytuff is typically best used as a Clefable switch-in, after which it can paralyze it with Thunder Wave and trade hits with Seismic Toss or Body Slam. Wigglytuff can also switch into a predicted Seismic Toss or Thunder Wave from Mr. Mime, but Wigglytuff does not want to switch into Mr. Mime's Psychic, as it can be 2HKOed with one critical hit.</p>"

Its Grass typing allows it to switch into and check Seaking lacking Blizzard and wall Staryu lacking Psychic or Blizzard, which is a common sight, as Surf + Thunderbolt Staryu is the most common set. Its bulk is good enough to avoid a 2HKO from super effective coverage moves, such as from Nidoqueen, Gastly, Seaking, and Staryu. Vileplume isn't too bad off in the damage department either, having access to the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam to boost its already respectable Attack and get switch-ins into range of popular revenge killers such as Fearow and Staryu.</p> <p>However, Vileplume is weighed down by weaknesses to common foes such as Fearow, Fire-types, and Drowzee, being outsped by the first two and 2HKOed by all three.

It's also completely unable to meaningfully damage Gastly, which outspeeds it and can either put it to sleep with Hypnosis or 3HKO it with Psychic. Vileplume's Speed is also incredibly mediocre, only outspeeding Drowzee, Graveler, Omanyte, and unboosted Porygon. This, in tandem with its weaknesses to many common attacking types, makes it hard for Vileplume to effectively attack despite its good bulk.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Mega Drain can be used in place of Stun Spore to OHKO Graveler 53.8% of the time and 2HKO the uncommon Omanyte, which otherwise wall Vileplume. It also 3HKOes Staryu and 4HKOes Seaking. However, the cost of giving up Stun Spore makes Mega Drain generally unadvised. Body Slam can be used in place of Stun Spore or Hyper Beam, as it can still spread paralysis and does not risk a recharge turn. However, this is less consistent than Stun Spore and far less damaging than Hyper Beam, and Vileplume doesn't usually get enough turns on the field to make the most out of the lack of recharge. Body Slam also can't paralyze Normal-types, which is awful for Vileplume, as they can set up Agility while Vileplume can do next to nothing in return. A set consisting of dual status, Body Slam, and Mega Drain can be used, but this is generally ill-advised, as it lacks firepower and does pitiful damage to Fire-types and Fearow, though they despise status. Weepinbell outclasses Vileplume as an attacker with Grass STAB thanks to its access to Razor Leaf.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Although Gastly hates getting statused, it completely walls Vileplume, as it's immune to Hyper Beam. Gastly can comfortably 3HKO it with Psychic in return or retaliate with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar 2HKO Vileplume with Fire Blast, with Rapidash being able to chip it down with Fire Spin into Fire Blast KO range if need be. Vileplume only usually ends up getting one +2 Hyper Beam versus them before going down. However, Rapidash and Magmar are hamstrung by paralysis, and Arcanine also dislikes it.</p> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow 2HKOes Vileplume with Drill Peck and can use Agility to set up on Vileplume and cancel out the Speed drop from paralysis. Vileplume's only way of dealing any meaningful damage back is through a +2 Hyper Beam. Fearow has to set up Agility on the turn before it KOes Vileplume or Vileplume can reapply its Speed drop. However, this ruins Fearow as a revenge killer later, forcing it to stay in and trade versus foes such as Nidoqueen or Arcanine.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Drowzee and the uncommon Abra both cleanly 2HKO Vileplume with Psychic; the former takes paralysis decently well, and the latter outspeeds it. However, Abra is ruined by paralysis and is almost OHKOed by an unboosted Hyper Beam, and Drowzee is vulnerable to being put to sleep because of Vileplume's higher Speed.</p> <p><strong>Ice- and Psychic-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon sporting Ice-type coverage, such as Nidoqueen, Blizzard variants of Seaking and Staryu, and Dragonair can 3HKO Vileplume, though all of these foes must be wary of status moves. Staryu with Psychic also rarely 3HKOes Vileplume and can potentially drop its Special to guarantee the 3HKO.</p>",

Vileplume also makes a good partner to Staryu, as it can paralyze faster Pokemon that could give Staryu issues, such as Fearow and Arcanine. It also gets many Pokemon into Staryu's KO range with +2 Hyper Beam.

Double-Edge deals about as much damage as Psychic against most switch-ins, though, so it can also be used as a midground option. As an alternative to Double-Edge, Mega Drain nearly 2HKOes both Golem and Kabutops, only needing slight chip damage to guarantee it. However, it is useless versus everything else.</p> <p>Venomoth can act as a lead, matching up well versus any slower lead and having decent odds to put Mr. Mime to sleep, but is forced out by Charizard or Ninetales due to the risk of a critical hit or Sleep Powder miss. In most games, it will instead switch in after a few turns to take advantage of a slower foe like Blastoise. Once in, it lands sleep and follows up with Stun Spore until something is paralyzed; if there is a preexisting paralyzed foe, Venomoth may opt to simply attack in case said foe switches in, returning later to land sleep. After landing sleep and paralysis, Venomoth can either stay in and trade hits until it drops or switch out after paralyzing the foe. Trading hits is advisable if the opponent uses Clefable to absorb Stun Spore, as Venomoth can often weaken it severely with Psychic before going down. Venomoth can also be saved to fight Rock-types with Mega Drain, to sacrifice to sleep later, or to prevent the opponent from ever sacrificing their slept Pokemon—this would let Venomoth land a second sleep. Venomoth pairs well with allies that bait in Water-types, as these are its easiest entry point; for example, leading Charizard or Ninetales often forces Blastoise in, as does using Golem early. Slower allies such as Kingler and Golem particularly appreciate Venomoth's paralysis support, as does Nidoking. Mega Drain Venomoth also works well with allies that normally falter in front of Rock-types, such as Moltres and Ninetales.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Agility + Partial Trapping, Hypno, and Articuno. Dugtrio is generally considered good in the current metagame. The most up to date moveset for Dugtrio is the following.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Generally, Dugtrio doesn't need any moves outside of its main set. Body Slam can be nice to paralyze checks such as the relatively uncommon Aerodactyl, but the only Pokemon you will commonly see that Dugtrio doesn't naturally outspeed is opposing Dugtrio. Even worse, Body Slam is only useful against opposing Dugtrio on the switch, as either Dugtrio can 2HKO the other with Earthquake one-on-one. Another severe downside of using Body Slam is its damage output in comparison to Slash: whereas Slash can do 30% to Gyarados, Body Slam does half that. Where Slash lets Dugtrio 4HKO Tangela and potentially catch it at half health while it switches in, Body Slam can't even reliably 6HKO Tangela. Sand Attack could be used to pray for misses in desperate scenarios, like when Dodrio is about to set up and run over your team or Dugtrio is your last Pokemon left and needs to land multiple critical hits. It can also stop Dragonite from setting up Agility and sweeping through your team with Wrap, but it's less reliable than Toxic and has its effect nullified by switching. It can technically be used to severely reduce Tentacruel's Wrap accuracy, though the only time Dugtrio should be facing Tentacruel is if it is in Earthquake KO range anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Dugtrio relies heavily on its Speed to stop foes from capitalizing on its weak defenses, which makes paralysis so deadly for it. Dugtrio is immune to Thunder Wave, but Stun Spore—used commonly by Tangela and the rare Venomoth—and Body Slam—from attackers like Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and opposing Dugtrio—can cripple Dugtrio for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks</strong>: In general, Dugtrio is unable to take more than one attack without fainting, so any strong attack—such as Kangaskhan's Body Slam and Hypno or Kadabra's Psychic—hitting it should enable any other Pokemon to pick it off. Even worse, many common special attacks, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Surf from Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, are super effective and will OHKO Dugtrio.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types are most teams' main defensive answers to Dugtrio, as they can switch into its Earthquake and threaten it out with heavy damage, if not an outright OHKO. Dragonite is best at dealing with Dugtrio, as the threat Dragonite poses with Agility and Wrap is so significant that Dugtrio often has to stay in and use Toxic, which can come at the cost of Dugtrio taking a Blizzard and being put at 20% health or lower. Gyarados is similar in its ability to answer Dugtrio, and while it lacks the threat of Agility + Wrap to keep Dugtrio from switching out, it is much harder for Dugtrio's teammates to force out due to its superior defensive typing. Aerodactyl can switch in on Dugtrio's Earthquake with impunity and 2HKO it, but it struggles to switch in on Rock Slide. Dodrio and Articuno are the last two common Flying-types that teams use to check Dugtrio. While they are significantly frailer than Dragonite and Gyarados, respectively 3HKOed and 2HKOed by Rock Slide, they can both OHKO Dugtrio with their STAB attacks and threaten to run through its team after an Agility boost.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Poliwrath, and the rare Dewgong can take Earthquake multiple times while KOing Dugtrio with their STAB Surf and using Rest to remain healthy and answer Dugtrio over the course of a match. However, Dugtrio's critical hit rate can allow it to bypass these answers if they are below 75% health, and Dewgong can't repeatedly switch into Rock Slide without being forced to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Tangela and Venusaur</strong>: Tangela is one of the best Dugtrio answers in RBY UU, taking almost no damage from Earthquake and threatening Dugtrio in return with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Tangela can also heal off any chip damage it sustains on the way in with Mega Drain, and it can potentially use Dugtrio as an opportunity to begin accumulating boosts with Growth. Venusaur is similar in this regard, coming in on Earthquake and threatening to put Dugtrio or a teammate to sleep with Sleep Powder or OHKO Dugtrio with Razor Leaf. However, Venusaur is worse at checking Dugtrio than Tangela due to its worse bulk and Ground neutrality.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: If Kangaskhan is healthy, it can switch into Dugtrio's Earthquake and threaten to cripple or KO Dugtrio with its STAB Body Slam or Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Persian and Hypno</strong>: While they can't switch in, Hypno and Persian can win the one-on-one matchup with Dugtrio from full health if it doesn't land a critical hit.</p>",

        "Dugtrio": {
          "description": "<hr /> <h4>Outdated Analysis</h4> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>Dugtrio succeeds as RBY UU’s most influential revenge killer and sweeper. Dugtrio's fantastic speed tier, perfect coverage, and Thunder Wave immunity give it the perfect combination of traits to fulfill these roles extremely effectively. Regardless of its health, Dugtrio can very easily close games with its powerful STAB Earthquake, especially considering it boasts an enormous 23.44% critical hit rate. As such, keeping Pokemon out of range of Dugtrio is a key aspect of mastering RBY UU; even tier king Tentacruel must be cautious, as it can drop to an Earthquake as early as 79.3%. This offensive prowess forces the majority of competitive teams to include several checks to it.</p> <p>While Dugtrio is incredibly strong, it is not without its flaws. While its typing provides it with good utility, it also opens it up to numerous weaknesses to common attacks such as Surf, Blizzard, and Razor Leaf. This, combined with its extreme frailty, causes it to crumble when confronted with any sort of offensive pressure. In addition to this, several Pokemon are either immune or resistant to its Earthquake, most notably Dragonite, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Tangela. This culminates into Dugtrio having a much more polarized matchup spread than other notable revenge killers, such as Persian or Kadabra. Regardless, Dugtrio remains one of the common and potent threats in the tier for which every team must prepare.</p>"

        "Physical Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>STAB Earthquake is excellent given Tentacruel's prominence, both 2HKOing it and supporting your own Tentacruel by 2HKOing all of its counters save Persian. Many of these targets can be put in KO range with a small amount of chip damage or a critical hit. Dugtrio also outspeeds all threats to Tentacruel besides opposing Dugtrio, which lets it worry less about its frailty. Earthquake's high power combined with Dugtrio's high critical hit chance makes Dugtrio an effective wallbreaker and general attacker. Through Rock Slide, Dugtrio can hit all Flying-types for super effective damage, further limiting how often the opponent can let Dugtrio come on the field before they start losing Pokemon. The next move is commonly Slash, which stops Tangela from completely walling Dugtrio and can act as a safe midground option to avoid reading whether opponents will switch to a Flying-type or not. Substitute is another option for Dugtrio's third move to make it an even more effective late-game sweeper. Dugtrio can set up a Substitute while the opponent switches to sacrifice a team member at low health, and it can then close out the game against a weakened team that can't break the Substitute and force Dugtrio out. The last moveslot is dedicated to Toxic, as it prevents Dragonite from freely coming in on Earthquake and setting up Agility safely.</p> <p>Dugtrio acts as a late-game sweeper and a potent offensive threat. Using Dugtrio optimally is a delicate balancing act of making the most of its limited opportunities to come onto the field while also keeping it as healthy as possible, a balance that often separates novice players from veterans. Partial-trapping moves—most commonly Wrap—are one of the primary ways Dugtrio can be brought onto the field safely, since they both provide the chip damage needed to bring targets into OHKO range and allow Dugtrio to switch in while the opposing Pokemon is unable to attack. Therefore, Wrap users such as Dragonite and especially Tentacruel make for excellent Dugtrio partners. Tentacruel is the best Dugtrio partner in the game; not only does it provide Wrap support and benefit from Dugtrio KOing primary answers to it after minor chip damage, such as opposing Tentacruel, Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu, but it takes very little damage from Blizzard and Surf aimed at Dugtrio. The opponent's Tentacruel using Wrap is another common way Dugtrio can get onto the battlefield safely, as Dugtrio takes relatively little chip damage from Wrap while outspeeding and KOing the opposing Tentacruel if it is sufficiently weakened. A teammate using Explosion or fainting is another common entrance point for Dugtrio, as its high Speed and damage output allow it to act as an effective revenge killer. Other good opportunities for Dugtrio to enter the battlefield include sleeping Pokemon, a predicted switch, a recovery move that doesn't let the foe escape Dugtrio's KO range, and Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt. Frequently, Dugtrio will be able to clean up teams that have been weakened to the point where it can OHKO every remaining Pokemon; this is a relatively common win condition in RBY UU that should always be kept in mind over the course of the game. Learning to capitalize on opportunities to set up this endgame while simultaneously hindering an opponent carrying Dugtrio from doing the same is an important skill for UU players to learn.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Agility + Partial Trapping, Hypno, and Articuno. Persian is generally considered good in the current metagame. The most up-to-date set is the following:</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Persian can utilize Body Slam over Toxic to assist teams poor at distributing paralysis. However, its damage is a far cry from Slash or Hyper Beam, relying heavily on Persian's innately high critical hit rate. However, Thunderbolt can be removed instead at the price of coverage should a team not require either of them. Screech can be used alongside Hyper Beam to KO sooner than Slash + Hyper Beam, though the foe can switch out to try and force a recharge, thus leaving Persian at risk of being paralyzed or even KOed. As a result, this option is very risky. Bubble Beam lets Persian fight Golem, and the Speed drop can allow it to knock out Dugtrio, but it doesn't help in many other matchups.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is the only viable RBY UU Pokemon that's immune to Slash, which makes it an excellent counter to Persian, preventing it from making any progress until Haunter is KOed. As such, it's best to keep Persian hidden until Haunter has been removed. Persian's Thunderbolt is only a possible 6HKO, while Haunter can 4HKO using its own Thunderbolt or threaten sleep from Hypnosis. So long as Haunter is active, focus on KOing it or baiting it into exploding.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis Inducers</strong>: Electabuzz, Kadabra, and Raichu all threaten to end Persian's run using Thunder Wave, which makes it noticeably less threatening overall. However, should they be in KO range, Persian is capable of shutting them down before they get the chance to do so. As a result, these are only checks if they are at full HP. Hypno is also notable for being among the only paralysis inducers not 2HKOed by Slash, though Hyper Beam can KO it from half health, and Persian is excellent at exploiting it as it uses Rest. Tangela can utilize Mega Drain to save itself from a Slash 3HKO and paralyze Persian with Stun Spore. Dragonite is also notable for its bulk, easily taking a Slash and paralyzing Persian in return. While Persian can use Toxic to outdamage Wrap from Dragonite, it's still problematic for the cat due to its significant damage aside from Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Kangaskhan 2HKOes Persian with Body Slam + Hyper Beam. If Kangaskhan is already in a tight spot, such as in 2HKO range from Slash, it can still use Hyper Beam to deal at least 65% damage to Persian, putting it in range for Dugtrio to revenge kill it. In addition, Kangaskhan has access to Counter, which allows it to situationally hit Persian or a switch-in for massive damage. This makes it a fair absorber of Hyper Beam as well; the subsequent Counter outright OHKOes Persian if it hits a high damage roll.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno can use Agility to outspeed Persian and 2HKO it with its nuclear Blizzard. This makes it a fine check. In addition, it's only 3HKOed by Persian's Slash 57.2% of the time, allowing the opponent to take risks if needed. However, a critical hit from Thunderbolt puts Articuno in range of Hyper Beam. Furthermore, consecutive critical hits from Thunderbolt can 2HKO it should Hyper Beam not be used.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Omastar resists Persian's Slash and can 2HKO it in return with Hydro Pump. Persian can try using Thunderbolt, but it's only a 4HKO, so a critical hit is needed to outdamage Rest's healing. Alternatively, Poliwrath makes a decent check, coming in on Slash to use STAB Submission and put Persian in KO range of a subsequent attack. However, Persian's Slash is still a very favorable 3HKO, so Poliwrath isn’t necessarily consistent.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: If Persian lacks Bubble Beam, Golem stonewalls it while possessing a very favorable 2HKO with Earthquake. Furthermore, Golem is an excellent counter to Hyper Beam sets, being able to comfortably absorb the hit and deal significant damage in return. Plus, it doesn't fear Bubble Beam from full health unless Persian lands a critical hit. However, Golem can't necessarily switch in on Persian if its moveset hasn't been revealed, as it risks losing half its health from Bubble Beam.</p>",

          "description": "<hr /> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>Persian's Speed and access to STAB Slash help make it a premier revenge killer and late-game sweeper in RBY UU. Outrunning every relevant Pokemon except Dugtrio, Persian can almost always make use of its high damage output from Slash. In addition, this high Speed makes Persian effective against Wrap users, most notably Tentacruel, allowing it to switch in and threaten to damage them with Slash or cripple them with Toxic. Persian will usually KO at least one Pokemon during a game thanks to the sheer power of Slash. Persian's bulk is also appealing, surpassing that of other fast threats like Kadabra and Dugtrio, allowing it to function much more effectively late-game. This bulk also makes it more viable to switch in on moves like Body Slam, which can't paralyze it thanks to Persian being Normal-type. All things considered, Persian is a UU staple.</p> <p>However, Persian's attacking stats are a bit middling, making Slash its main form of damage. To make matters worse, Persian is particularly lacking in physical coverage, with only Hyper Beam available as a second viable option. As a result, Persian relies on its middling special movepool to cover for Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves, making it relatively easy for Pokemon like Haunter to come in and threaten it. Persian is also crippled by paralysis in a big way, as it relies heavily on its Speed to sweep and threaten Wrap users, so it can be forced out by paralysis inducers if it can't KO them first.</p>"

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Slash is the mandatory backbone of Persian's damage output, sporting a 99.6% critical hit rate. Thunderbolt allows Persian to hit bulky Water-types—especially Gyarados—for better damage with a paralysis chance as a bonus. Toxic most notably allows Persian to poison Dragonite using Agility, making a Dragonite Wrap sweep near impossible; however, Dragonite's offensive presence outside of this remains significant. Alternatively, Hyper Beam can be used over Toxic for a slight boost in power, which can be crucial when taking down Pokemon like Electabuzz and Kadabra, which threaten it with paralysis. The KO ranges for Hyper Beam aren't much larger than Slash, though, so it should only be used if you want Persian to be a sweeper.</p> <p>Persian's playstyle is fairly straightforward; it is a cleaner that revenge kills when possible. Generally, Persian should be used once Pokemon that can paralyze it or resist Slash have either been KOed or put into KO range. Persian can often switch into weakened Tentacruel attempting to use Wrap, as Persian forces it out by the threat of a KO. Persian's other likely point of entry is your own Tentacruel's Wrap, which gives Persian an excellent shot at KOing foes outright with little to no opposition. Persian is also excellent at coming in on Pokemon using Rest, 3HKOing even bulkier threats like Vaporeon and Hypno.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Persian profits immensely from the Substitute mechanics in Stadium OU, which give it a degree of safety against the threat of Thunder Wave. With the strongest Slash in the game in addition to special coverage in Bubble Beam and Thunderbolt, Persian is well-equipped for dealing with Pokemon like weakened Tauros, Cloyster, Rhydon, and Reflect Chansey. Persian is also extremely fast, outrunning Tauros and boasting a 19% critical hit rate, giving it strong revenge killing utility and notable volatility. Because of this, when paired with Tauros, Persian forms a strong Normal-type attacking core that can be difficult for teams to stop.</p> <p>However, Persian should never be used over Tauros—only alongside it—and for good reason: its power is simply inferior. While Slash itself is very strong, Persian itself isn't, making it still struggle against bulkier Pokemon like Snorlax. Persian's special coverage deals middling damage to most targets, meaning it is very reliant on Slash; Tauros possesses Earthquake and Blizzard, allowing it to muscle past Gengar and Exeggutor, respectively. In fact, seeing Gengar in Team Preview often makes Persian dead weight for a majority of the game, forcing its teammates to remove it before it can make any progress. Like many fast Pokemon in the tier, Persian is ruined by paralysis as well, leading to it being forced out if it can't KO Thunder Wave users before they paralyze it. Paralysis also exposes its awful fragilty: critical hits from tier staples like Tauros, Alakazam, and Rhydon can outright OHKO it. Persian also competes with Kangaskhan as a \"second Tauros\", the latter possessing 101 HP Substitutes and superior bulk to better contest Chansey and Snorlax, as well as Earthquake to fight Gengar. However, Persian's Speed and Slash access give it much better qualities as a revenge killer, providing it with a strong niche in the metagame.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Substitute Attacker": {
          "description": "<p>Slash is Persian's main outlet for damage, having a 99% critical hit rate to effectively ignore Reflect; it also 2HKOes Alakazam, preventing it from using Substitute if it's already used it once. Bubble Beam allows Persian to 2HKO Rhydon, which otherwise counters it. Common switch-ins to Bubble Beam—such as Alakazam and Starmie—can also have their Speed dropped switching in, which can potentially let Persian threaten them head-on. Thunderbolt lets Persian attempt to 3HKO Cloyster and Slowbro, the latter of which is also particularly vulnerable to critical hits if it tries to set up Amnesia. However, it should be noted that Thunderbolt deals less damage to Starmie than Slash without a critical hit. Finally, Substitute can be used against resting Pokemon like Exeggutor and Slowbro for free, guarding against status and poising Persian to get serious damage in. It can similarly be used against paralyzed Alakazam, Chansey, or Starmie to fish for full paralysis—especially on predicted Recover uses—foes which Persian can muscle past from there.</p> <p>Persian performs best as an expendable mid-game revenge killer, but thanks to Substitute, it can also be a successful late-game cleaner. Once a Pokemon is forced to use Recover, use Rest, or otherwise end up in KO range, Persian can usually come in and profit immensely so long as its checks have been removed. Late-game Persian also has a minor advantage against Substitute Tauros, which put themselves into Slash 2HKO range when using it, so there is value in holding it back to the point where a Tauros mirror would otherwise be appropriate. In terms of other moveset options, Body Slam can be used to let Persian scout while spreading paralysis, though giving up either Bubble Beam or Thunderbolt is often necessary, making Persian more easily checked. Thunder can be used instead of Thunderbolt for a guaranteed 2HKO on Cloyster, as well as dealing more damage to Starmie than Slash, but its consistency gives Persian its own trouble. While Hyper Beam can be used to squeeze 2HKOs on Chansey and Starmie alongside Slash, the forced recharge makes it a far cry from regular RBY and thus generally not recommended.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Persian carves out a niche in RBY OU thanks to its ability to consistently land critical hits with Slash. Slash bypasses Reflect, allowing it to break through Reflect Snorlax. Its solid special coverage ensures that it's only fully walled by Gengar and is able to handle potential answers to Normal-types, such as Rhydon and Cloyster. Persian’s impressive Speed allows it to outspeed Tauros and tie with Starmie, making it an effective revenge killer. It also grants Persian a strong 22.46% critical hit rate. Tauros and Persian form a devastating offensive duo that's tough to handle, as absorbing their combined damage becomes a significant challenge.</p> <p>Despite its offensive potential, Persian is not a replacement for the rampaging bull, Tauros, which partly explains why it has never achieved true OU prominence. Persian is significantly less bulky, often getting 2HKOed by many attacks that Tauros can typically survive. Due to this weakness, Persian is often forced out by Thunder Wave users, such as Alakazam and Starmie. This lack of defensive utility is a key weakness, as Persian cannot afford to switch into any attacks, making it hard to get onto the field safely. Furthermore, since Persian is almost always paired with Tauros, this creates a team with two Pokemon that do not want to take hits, leading to a lack of space for defensive tools.</p> <p>Finally, although Slash is a strong move and always lands a critical hit by design, this means Persian's damage output with Slash is capped. In contrast, Tauros can deal nearly as much damage with Body Slam, but also has the potential to score critical hits and inflict paralysis, giving it higher overall potential in terms of both damage and utility. Persian demands sharp prediction and aggressive play to make the most of its strengths, but when used effectively, it can be very rewarding, particularly against more defensive strategies.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Persian’s other options are not very interesting. Screech can be used alongside Hyper Beam to OHKO Pokemon like Starmie, creating mind games and encouraging switches. It also offers a helpful way to check for Counter from Chansey and Snorlax, potentially allowing Persian to land the move for free. Just like Growl, it can also allow to reapply a Speed drop to a paralyzed Pokemon. However, running Screech means sacrificing too many of Persian's essential moves. Thunder, on the other hand, 2HKOes Cloyster and deals more damage to Starmie than Thunderbolt, but its accuracy and reliability leave much to be desired, making it a less consistent option overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gengar: Persian can't fight Gengar at all, possessing only its special coverage to have even a hope in doing so. Even Thunder only has a vague chance to 5HKO it, so Persian is often forced out while giving Gengar free rein to use an uncontested Hypnosis or force damage onto Persian's teammates. Ideally, Gengar should be accounted for and dispatched before even revealing Persian.</p> <p>Paralysis: Persian can't handle paralysis, which makes its lack of bulk much more apparent and easier to exploit. Worse still, being paralyzed completely diminishes Persian's potential to revenge kill, making it little more than food for opposing Snorlax and Tauros. Many Pokemon, like Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Cloyster, can even 2HKO it with little consequence when it's paralyzed.</p> <p>Starmie: Starmie is capable of stomaching Slash + Hyper Beam and Speed ties with Persian, which, combined with its access to Thunder Wave, makes it very capable of downing the cat. Persian is capable of winning against a paralyzed Starmie, but it will often rely on full paralysis to win if Starmie is at full HP.</p> <p>Tauros: Without Growl shenanigans, Tauros can 2HKO Persian with Body Slam + Hyper Beam, while Persian can only threaten it with Slash followed by a critical hit from Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Snorlax: Snorlax with Hyper Beam can take on Persian, as it 2HKOes with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, and it has the bulk necessary to withstand Persian’s attacks. It just needs to be cautious of a potential Growl.</p> <p>Exeggutor: With its fantastic bulk, Exeggutor can win against Persian one-on-one, threatening it with Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, or a 2HKO from Psychic. However, it will take massive damage in the process, often being forced to use Explosion much sooner than usual.</p> <p>Counter: Counter is a major annoyance for Persian because it doesn’t have an efficient way to scout for it. This makes Snorlax and Chansey with Counter tough for Persian to handle. If Persian revenge kills something, Chansey can easily come in and threaten Thunder Wave, forcing Persian to switch out to avoid paralysis. This allows Chansey to use Counter on the incoming Pokemon, dealing significant damage and putting the Persian player in a tough spot.</p> <p>Rhydon: While it is 2HKOed by Bubble Beam, Rhydon is capable of threatening Persian, as it 2HKOes Persian with Earthquake and resists Slash. Due to it effectively forcing Persian to use Bubble Beam, it can pivot to a specially bulky Pokemon like Alakazam to switch in with relative impunity unless a Speed drop occurs. Ergo, defeating Rhydon with Bubble Beam can actually be quite difficult, so Bubble Beam should be seen as a way to encourage it to switch out and force Slash damage onto the opposing team.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Slash is the main reason Persian is viable, effectively ignoring Reflect thanks to its near-guaranteed critical hit rate. Body Slam is crucial against Reflect Snorlax; after two hits with Slash, the third will only KO 6.5% of the time, and Snorlax can simply use Rest, undoing your progress. However, Persian can fish for a critical hit with Body Slam to secure the KO, as Snorlax can’t afford to skip Rest. Additionally, Body Slam can fish for paralysis when Starmie switches in, potentially crippling it. Bubble Beam allows Persian to 2HKO Rhydon, and its Speed drop chance can occasionally help against faster switch-ins like Alakazam and Starmie, forcing them into a tricky situation.</p> <p>For the 4th move, Thunderbolt 3HKOes Cloyster and Slowbro, giving Persian a fighting chance against them. It also can critically hit Starmie, unlike Slash, providing Persian more offensive pressure, and it is a way to chip away at Gengar if it is asleep or at low HP. Growl gives Persian a way to handle Tauros. Persian is 2HKOed by Body Slam + Hyper Beam, but using Growl on the Hyper Beam turn prevents the KO unless Tauros critically hits, allowing Persian to retaliate with Slash and take it down. However, this tactic is somewhat predictable, and if the opponent anticipates it, they could simply use Body Slam instead. Still, Growl is enough to put Tauros in an awkward position in a matchup that is otherwise unfavorable for Persian. Growl can also be useful against Hyper Beam Snorlax depending on its remaining HP and helps prevent a Self-Destruct OHKO. Additionally, it can reapply a Speed drop to a paralyzed Pokemon, which is particularly useful against Starmie.</p> <p>Hyper Beam, meanwhile, allows Persian to finish off Pokemon like Starmie, Victreebel, and Chansey after Slash and provides a slight damage boost to secure KOs where Slash would otherwise fall short. It’s also a viable option for a final stand in a tight spot, with Persian’s critical hit rate giving it a chance to turn the tables in critical moments.</p>"

Amnesia also assists Golduck defensively, making it very difficult for conventional Water-types to KO and allowing it to PP stall them using Rest. Golduck's Speed is also fairly decent—tying it with Articuno and Pinsir—which lets it get the jump on Dragonite before it can set up Agility.</p> <p>However, Golduck has a myriad of issues that prevent it from seeing play. The main problem is that its good coverage falls flat in RBY UU due to the many bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Dewgong, all of which stonewall Golduck. Furthermore, Tentacruel makes actually getting mileage out of Golduck a nightmare, outspeeding it to delay its setup and chip it down with Wrap until it's placed in KO range. Golduck is fairly vulnerable to physical attackers like Kangaskhan that love to punish its Rest, blowing past it with their STAB moves. As a result, while Golduck works on paper, it flounders in practice. Poliwrath is a far superior pick as an Amnesia user, possessing a wider movepool and better overall stats.</p>",

Hydro Pump will OHKO Dugtrio without a boost, and, at +2, it will OHKO Persian and Kangaskhan.

It's capable of threatening just about everything in the tier with either super effective coverage or Body Slam paralysis. Additionally, it's one of the few Pokemon that can reliably 2HKO Porygon with its STAB Submission. However, its bulk is quite poor, so the majority of the tier can 2HKO or 3HKO it. It's also very weak to paralysis, limiting its ability to actually break though defensive pieces like Porygon. To make matters worse, Primeape's offensive presence has major flaws. Body Slam's paralysis chance is often not enough to justify using a Pokemon that deals little damage to common bulky threats like Nidoqueen and Machamp. Its Speed, while fast, fails against the omnipresent Rapidash and Fearow. While it can force paralysis on some important Pokemon and sometimes even get a KO, teams typically prefer offensive threats with higher reward, and thus it's recommended that players avoid using Primeape.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Since Body Slam is still quite threatening to Fire-types, Thunderbolt can be used over Rock Slide. It still 3HKOes Fearow and is Primeape's strongest attack against Slowpoke. Against other Water-types, Thunderbolt and Submission deal similar damage, but Thunderbolt lacks recoil and has much better accuracy. However, Primeape struggles to damage Pinsir without Rock Slide. Low Kick can flinch past some bulky threats when combined with paralysis support, but this strategy is very inconsistent and Low Kick has little use otherwise. Counter can 2HKO some would-be checks like Pinsir and Machamp, but it is very prediction-reliant and has little use against most other threats.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow is immune to paralysis from Body Slam and can outspeed and 2HKO Primeape with Drill Peck. However, it has a 16.2% chance to be 2HKOed by Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Rapidash</strong>: Rapidash outspeeds Primeape and has a 55.2% chance to 2HKO it with Fire Blast, which also threatens to burn it. In return, Primeape can only 3HKO with Rock Slide. However, Rapidash must watch out for a Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Bulky threats</strong>: Machamp is only 4HKOed by Submission and takes less than 40% from Hyper Beam, and it can 3HKO Primeape with its Submission or Earthquake. Nidoqueen can 2HKO Primeape with Earthquake, and Primeape's Body Slam is only a 5HKO in return; Hyper Beam deals less than 40% to Nidoqueen.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly is immune to or takes minimal damage form all of Primeape's attacks barring Rock Slide, which can only 3HKO it, while Gastly can 2HKO with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: The vast majority of the tier has little issue breaking through Primeape's low defenses once its Speed is gone. Common Thunder Wave users like Dragonair and Drowzee easily tank two hits from Primeape and paralyze it back.

Hyper Beam is Primeape's most powerful attack, letting it finish off weakened threats that are out of range of its other attacks, such as Dragonair and Drowzee below half HP and Nidoqueen and Machamp below 40%.

This coverage allows Primeape to succeed far more consistently than any of the other Fighting-types available. Its damage output is also impressive, allowing it to 2HKO or 3HKO the vast majority of Pokemon in the tier, including notable threats such as Clefable and Moltres. Perhaps most importantly, its great Speed stat allows it to outspeed notable fast Pokemon such as Moltres and Mr. Mime. The attached 18.55% critical hit rate further boosts its offensive potency. This rate is especially important versus defensive Pokemon such as Golem and Blastoise, as a singular critical hit Submission or Thunderbolt will turn a 3HKO into a 2HKO. Clefable, Charizard, Moltres, and Kabutops are all OHKOed by either a critical hit Submission or Rock Slide.</p> <p>While Primeape is incredibly strong, its frailness and Psychic weakness allow for little defensive utility, with it losing to common Pokemon like Mr. Mime. Also, while its Speed is impressive, it's not quite enough to stop Fire Spin users such as Charizard and Ninetales from taking advantage of it. Primeape's reliance on its Speed also causes paralysis to cripple it, meaning Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Exeggcute, and Electrode force it out.

However, a Counter from Clefable or Wigglytuff will punish it, so scouting their movesets prior is recommended. Body Slam grants Primeape some measure of self-sufficiency by spreading paralysis to support it. It also acts as a way to discourage switch-ins, as Pokemon like Charizard and Nidoking hate paralysis; Charizard is also liable to be KOed by Rock Slide thereafter. Rock Slide also lets Primeape punish the plethora of other viable Fire-types, 2HKOing Moltres as well as Ninetales, Arcanine, and Rapidash after some chip damage. Hyper Beam is Primeape's strongest attack, allowing it to revenge kill from high percentages. In addition, Hyper Beam prevents Rest Exeggcute from walling Primeape, with two Body Slams into critical hit Hyper Beam being a guaranteed KO. Alternatively, Thunderbolt is Primeape's strongest option against Blastoise, Seadra, and Kingler, 2HKOing the latter 91.5% of the time.</p> <p>Primeape is decently customizable due to its sizeable movepool. Thunder is a guaranteed 3HKO on Blastoise and Seadra, while with Thunderbolt this is only a chance. However, Thunder's poor accuracy leaves it as a niche option. Low Kick is a decent alternative to Submission, forgoing power for a chance to flinch the foe. This allows it to occasionally brute force through foes at high health without taking damage in the process. Counter can be used to heavily damage physical attackers such as Pinsir and Raticate, but it requires some level of prediction in order to be effective. Primeape can use Toxic to check AgiliWrap Dragonair and Fire Spin users, as they will take more damage from Toxic than it will deal with Wrap. Finally, Mega Kick deals high damage to some of Primeape's most notable checks, pairing with Hyper Beam to secure KOs on Nidoking, Mr. Mime, and Exeggcute. However, Mega Kick's mediocre accuracy leaves much to be desired.</p> <p>Primeape fits well on teams with multiple Flying- and Bug-types such as Charizard, Moltres, Pinsir, and Venomoth, as it resists Rock Slide while also threatening opposing Fire-types that check them. Primeape is also great at absorbing Toxic, due to its dislike of paralysis, which lets it protect Fire Spin Charizard and Moltres. It also pairs especially well with dedicated checks to Mr. Mime. Once Mr. Mime is sizably chipped, Primeape can outspeed and revenge kill it, removing one of its biggest roadblocks in the process. Notable Mr. Mime checks include Clefable, Exeggcute, Drowzee, and even your own Mr. Mime. Primeape is most successful when used as a mid-game wallbreaker, as most of its coveted targets like Clefable, Moltres, and Kingler come into play then. Punishing these Pokemon grants openings for its teammates to sweep later on.</p>"

Tentacruel gets a special mention for being able to outspeed these Fire-types and either deal considerable damage with Surf, or predict a switch and pivot with Wrap. Even among Fire-types, however, it’s tough to justify using Arcanine over Moltres due to its inferior Special stat.

Its 95 base Speed and access to Agility lets Arcanine outpace some other Agility users, like Articuno and Dragonite, and it possesses a strong Body Slam to deter switch-ins.

Body Slam threatens to paralyze non-Normal-types that would switch in on it and, along with Hyper Beam, makes use of Arcanine’s impressive base 110 Attack. These two moves make a nice one-two punch; if Dugtrio or Kadabra switched in on a Body Slam, then Hyper Beam can dispose of them on the following turn and, therefore, not require a recharge turn.

      "overview": "<p>Arcanine is a fringe pick in NU as a defensive Fire-type that trades hits efficiently thanks to a very high Attack stat backed by Body Slam access. Being the best physical Fire-type is a big perk for the fiery dog, leaving a dent in anything that doesn't resist its coverage. Its Speed is just barely enough to work, outrunning Pokemon like Venomoth and Mr. Mime, which also makes it a fair anti-lead and revenge killer. Arcanine's bulk is nothing to scoff at, even taking a +2 Earthquake from Charizard, actualizing its utility as a defensive Fire-type. It also has a fantastic Moltres matchup, stonewalling the terrifying Legendary Bird while threatening anything attempting to switch in with a meaty Body Slam. Arcanine can usually deal heavy damage before going down and, when paired with Water-types like Blastoise, can form a decent defensive core to combat the offense-laden RBY NU.</p> <p>However, metagame shifts have not been kind to the Legendary Pokemon: tier staples like Charizard, Kabutops, and Golem tear into it, as Arcanine only has Fire- and Normal-type moves for coverage, and these Pokemon are frequent offensive presences. While it can theoretically use Toxic to punish them, this is hardly a substitute for direct damage, and lacking Fire Spin to pile on chip damage or escape bad matchups worsens the issue. Without Venusaur as a reliable target for it to switch into, as well as Moltres becoming less favored, Arcanine's regular lines of play have diminished. As a defensive Fire-type, it also has issues distinguishing itself from Rest Moltres outside of its admittedly crucial Body Slam access; while Moltres lacks it, it has more overall bulk, Fire Spin access, and generally inconsequential weaknesses, notably not being hit by Earthquake. Furthermore, while Arcanine's Charizard matchup is functional, it's just that: even minor chip damage, which it will sustain, can drastically worsen it. Due to a mix of these factors, Arcanine has fallen off significantly. The volatile nature of the tier is just a bit too much for Arcanine teams in general, leading to them being a rare sight in the modern metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Arcanine's movepool is workable, but replacing any move often harms more than it helps due to its highly specific matchup spread. Agility can be used to make Arcanine into a mixed late-game sweeper, with its great Attack stat and Body Slam access making it more reliable than Agility + Fire Spin Moltres. However, with its limited coverage, setting the stage for Agility Arcanine can be difficult, and not having Fire Spin means it needs foes to be put in KO range for it to be consistent.</p> <p>Toxic can be used on lead Arcanine sets to poison potential Fire Spin leads, particularly Charizard and Ninetales, as well as give it something to catch Kabutops and Golem switching in. However, Charizard and Ninetales perform this role better due to their higher Speed and access to Fire Spin. Reflect can be used to further this role and mitigate Arcanine's Earthquake weakness, but the abundance of Swords Dance and Slash users that ignore this makes the utility limited. Leer can be used on paralysis-intensive teams to drop Defense while reapplying the foe's paralysis Speed drop, often forcing the opponent to switch it out, but this is especially niche.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Arcanine has nothing to contest Rock-types outside of hoping for a Fire Blast burn, leaving it countered by Golem and Kabutops, which 2HKO it with Earthquake and Surf, respectively. Kabutops is also excellent at making use of a resting Arcanine, as it often uses Swords Dance to threaten a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Arcanine takes massive damage from Water-type attacks, which all 2HKO Arcanine, making Pokemon like Blastoise, Seadra, and Kingler threatening. Kingler strongly dislikes taking paralysis from Body Slam or burn from Fire Blast but can still 2HKO Arcanine.</p> <p><strong>Charizard</strong>: Charizard can 3HKO Arcanine with Earthquake, which becomes a 2HKO if it's taken even minor damage. Swords Dance allows Charizard to exploit Arcanine if it uses Rest; in fact, Charizard coming in on a predicted Rest can end the game on the spot. A healthy Arcanine can mortally threaten Charizard with Body Slam paralysis, though, so this matchup can be volatile.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Once Arcanine uses Rest, it's left vulnerable to exploitation, and most setup sweepers have super effective coverage against it. Kingler, Kabutops, Sandslash, and Seadra are all capable of 2HKOing Arcanine after setting up.</p>",

Teams that use Arcanine primarily use it alongside Blastoise, providing a useful defensive backbone against Charizard. Offensively, Arcanine can potentially allow Mr. Mime to flourish by fending off opposing Mr. Mime and Clefable. Using Arcanine takes up a valuable team slot for a second Fire-type, however; there is very little reason to drop Charizard for Arcanine, and thus teams must find ways to check Water- and Rock-types in spite of this increased weakness.</p>"

While both Surf and Hydro Pump 2HKO most neutral targets, like Pinsir, some threats that are 2HKOed by a +2 Hydro Pump, such as Machamp and Porygon, either avoid or have extremely low odds to be 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Additionally, a +2 Surf is incapable of OHKOing Nidoqueen and Arcanine and has extremely low odds of OHKOing Rapidash, while +2 Hydro Pump has high odds to OHKO the former pair and will always OHKO the latter. Psychic is Poliwag's best attack against Water-types, like Staryu and Seaking; while Hydro Pump does similar amounts of damage, Psychic's higher accuracy and chance for a Special drop give it solid odds to 2HKO the former and 3HKO the latter at +2. It also helps against Grass-types, as after an Amnesia boost it has decent odds to 2HKO Vileplume, and it will always 2HKO Weepinbell.</p> <p>Poliwag is an effective lead due to its high Speed and access to a sleep-inducing move, though it can also be used as an endgame cleaner. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine are common threats that Poliwag loses to quite badly; Omanyte is a great partner, as it switches into all three of them. Paralysis is a great way to handle these faster threats, so Poliwag also appreciates support from Thunder Wave users like Dragonair and Porygon. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine themselves make great partners, as they can trade hits with each other and eliminate the status spreaders that give Poliwag trouble.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Poliwrath is generally considered less viable in the current metagame, but its most up to date moveset is the following.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poliwrath has a genuinely massive movepool consisting of many interesting niche options. Psychic is somewhat useful on either set, as only Hypno and Kadabra resist it. It also happens to be Poliwrath’s strongest option against opposing Poliwrath and the rare Venomoth. However, Poliwrath’s relatively low Special stat makes the move underwhelming, even if it hits the target for super effective damage; Tentacruel is only 4HKOed. Surf can be used on the bulky sleeper set but suffers from the same problems as Psychic. The move fails to OHKO Dugtrio and is outclassed by Earthquake when hitting neutral targets like Hypno and Kadabra. It is mainly useful for hitting Persian and Kangaskhan, but Hydro Pump and Submission are typically stronger though less reliable options. Hyper Beam is a strong option for finishing off neutral targets, especially those with a low Defense stat. It is Poliwrath’s strongest move against Hypno, Kadabra, Articuno, Gyarados, and Vaporeon. Seismic Toss gives Poliwrath a consistent option for damage against every Pokemon, scoring a 4HKO or better against every major threat, aside from Vaporeon and Kangaskhan. It is seldom the strongest option for any Pokemon, but it reliably hits anything that could switch in. Counter is an interesting option for Persian, Kangaskhan, Vaporeon, and Omastar,which are quite likely to use a Normal-type move when facing Poliwrath, but it's difficult to fit into conventional sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Hypno and Kadabra</strong>: Hypno and Kadabra can easily 2HKO Poliwrath with Psychic. Aside from Hypnosis and Amnesia-boosted attacks, Poliwrath can only 4HKO or attempt to freeze Hypno. While Kadabra is much easier to KO, it outspeeds Poliwrath, which makes Poliwrath largely unable to threaten it. Kadabra’s high critical hit rate is also frightening for Poliwrath, as a critical hit Psychic will always OHKO, even after Amnesia boosts.</p> <p><strong>Gyarados</strong>: Unboosted Poliwrath lacks any tools to meaningfully threaten Gyarados outside of Hypnosis. Gyarados, meanwhile, outspeeds Poliwrath and will 2HKO it with Thunderbolt about one third of the time. Gyarados can even come in for free if it can correctly predict Earthquake. Additionally, Gyarados's impressive Attack allows it to pressure Poliwrath even after Amnesia.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur outspeeds Poliwrath and can deal massive damage with Razor Leaf. Thanks to the move's near-guaranteed critical hit, it will virtually always 2HKO Poliwrath even if it has used Amnesia. Additionally, Venusaur has a faster and more accurate sleep move than Poliwrath, giving it ample ability to pressure Poliwrath even at full health. Poliwrath can threaten Venusaur with a 3HKO from Blizzard, however.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Poliwrath's mediocre Special and Water typing leave it highly susceptible to Thunderbolt users. Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode are guaranteed to 2HKO Poliwrath and have high critical hit rates. Weaker and less common Thunderbolt users like Gyarados, Dragonite, Persian, Clefable, and Raticate also can deal pretty hefty damage to Poliwrath.</p> <p><strong>Dodrio</strong>: Dodrio's powerful Drill Peck is extremely likely to 2HKO Poliwrath. While Dodrio does fear Blizzard, it can potentially come in on Earthquake or Body Slam and still take out Poliwrath before Blizzard can KO it. Additionally, Dodrio can punish Rest very harshly, potentially setting up with Agility on top of getting the KO.</p> <p><strong>Partial-trapping Moves</strong>: Because Poliwrath has many exploitable weaknesses and is relatively slow, it is not overly difficult to whittle down with Wrap or Bind and pivot to a strong attacker that can finish it off. While Poliwrath has the potential to 2HKO all notable partial-trappers, Tentacruel, Dragonite, and Pinsir are still frequently used to handle Poliwrath. Additionally, if Dragonite hasn't sustained any damage, it is guaranteed to survive Blizzard, meaning it can set up with Agility unless Poliwrath happens to carry Toxic or land Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, most notably Vaporeon, take little damage from all of Poliwrath's moves. Dewgong functions similarly, but is quite weak to Submission. Bulky Water-type Pokemon can't do too much in return outside of paralysis from Body Slam, however. Interestingly, Poliwrath is actually a solid check to itself once Sleep Clause is in effect, as no move aside from Psychic can 3HKO it.</p>",

          "description": "<hr /> <h4>Outdated Analysis</h4> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>Poliwrath has very steep competition as one of many significant Water-type Pokemon in RBY UU. It does not have the speed of Tentacruel, the bulk of Vaporeon, the typing of Omastar, or the powerful STAB Ice-type moves of Dewgong. What Poliwrath does have, though, is one of the most diverse and interesting movepools of any Pokemon in the tier. For starters, it's the only legal fully evolved Water-type Pokemon with a sleep-inducing move, that being Hypnosis. While Hypnosis has underwhelming accuracy, it is a unique tool that threatens slower foes such as Hypno and deters quicker foes such as Tentacruel from switching in. Offensively, Poliwrath has options such as Body Slam, Earthquake, Submission, and Psychic on top of the staples Surf and Blizzard. While it can’t run all of these moves, Poliwrath can be tricky to play around and require scouting. To make it even more dynamic, Poliwrath also has Amnesia as a niche option that improves its offensive prowess and longevity. On top of all these options, Poliwrath can still serve as a traditional bulky Water-type Pokemon, being a soft check to Articuno and physical attackers like Dugtrio.</p> <p>Despite its impressive advantages, Poliwrath is just short of truly being a staple in RBY UU. The most obvious weakness is its typing; while having a powered-up Submission and resisting Rock Slide are good traits, being weak to Psychic and Flying far outweighs the positives. Hypno and Kadabra are incredibly common and enormously threatening, giving Poliwrath a major disadvantage not faced by other slow Water-type Pokemon. While Dodrio is less common, it too can easily knock out Poliwrath. Aside from this, Poliwrath has truly mediocre stats, lacking even one base stat with three digits. Physically, Poliwrath shines a little bit, as it has marginally more bulk than Vaporeon and Dewgong and hits as hard as Articuno. However, it is still outdone defensively by Omastar and offensively by most dedicated physical attackers. Specially, Poliwrath is very exploitable, being less bulky than even Dewgong by a fairly large margin. Its offensive options are similarly underwhelming; notably, Poliwrath’s Blizzard will always fail to OHKO Dragonite without a critical hit, meaning it can't reliably prevent AgiliWrap like other Water-type Pokemon. Poliwrath is a niche option with several unfortunate shortcomings, fitting best on teams that need a bulky Water-type Pokemon and a sleeper in one Pokemon.</p>"
        },
        "Bulky Sleeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis is Poliwrath’s biggest selling point over conventional Water-type Pokemon. The move can be used in a number of ways to get an advantage, especially early-game. If Poliwrath can get in against the slower Hypno, it's usually free to induce sleep. This can be accomplished by switching in as Hypno wakes up from Rest, or by using a Pokemon like Kadabra or Electabuzz to bait it in. Poliwrath also happens to be faster than Vaporeon and Omastar while Speed tying with Dewgong, meaning it can easily threaten them with Hypnosis as well. Unlike Hypno, these Pokemon struggle to punish Poliwrath if it misses. While it is typically used early-game, Hypnosis is a decent tool throughout the entire match, as it gives Poliwrath an option to stymie dangerous sweepers like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Articuno. Blizzard hits many key targets in the metagame for respectable damage. Blizzard 2HKOes Dugtrio, Dragonite, and Aerodactyl and 3HKOes Tangela and Venusaur. The damage on Dragonite is especially important, as Poliwrath has limited tools to stop AgiliWrap, especially if it has already hit something with Hypnosis. Poliwrath will typically make use of a physical move, as its decent Attack allows it to deal solid damage to Water-type Pokemon, especially Tentacruel and Omastar. Earthquake is a common choice because it can 2HKO Tentacruel over half the time. Tentacruel is fairly hesitant to engage with Poliwrath, as Earthquake can deal immense damage on the switch or if Wrap misses. Earthquake is also notable for 2HKOing Haunter, Electabuzz, and Raichu and almost certainly 3HKOing Omastar.</p> <p>Poliwrath’s final moveslot is usually dedicated to additional coverage or Rest. Body Slam is much weaker than Earthquake, but the chance for paralysis is very helpful for stymieing partial-trappers like Dragonite and offensive checks like Gyarados, Kadabra, and Electric-type Pokemon. Submission is another strong option that applies a lot of pressure to Normal-type Pokemon while also giving Poliwrath more options for Rock- and Ice-type Pokemon. Submission always 2HKOes Persian and can 2HKO Kangaskhan, Clefable, and Dewgong. Despite these advantages, Submission is not an overly common choice due to its low accuracy and dreadful recoil, which limit a Pokemon that is already not very bulky. Hydro Pump is Poliwrath’s strongest move against neutral targets like Hypno. The move is guaranteed to OHKO Dugtrio and Golem. Additionally, Hydro Pump 4HKOes Hypno and is Poliwrath's best option for hitting Kangaskhan and Persian after Submission. Lastly, Rest helps extend Poliwrath’s usefulness throughout the game. The move is most useful when Poliwrath is expected to take a more defensive role, such as checking Dugtrio or Articuno. However, Poliwrath’s numerous weaknesses leave it very vulnerable while it is asleep.</p> <p>Poliwrath is best suited for teams that appreciate the offensive advantages of sleep and the defensive advantages of a bulky Water-type Pokemon. Because of its somewhat quick Hypnosis, Pokemon that can bait in Hypno, Tangela, and bulky Water-type Pokemon tend to be good partners. These include Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Kangaskhan. Wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite are also helpful for pivoting so Poliwrath can get in more safely. Poliwrath's ability to soft check Articuno and physical attackers like Dugtrio and Kangaskhan means it works quite well with Flying-, Ground-, and Electric-type Pokemon. Flying-type Pokemon are additionally good partners thanks to Poliwrath's resistance to Rock. This means Poliwrath can get in rather safely against Dugtrio if it needs to. Due to its Psychic weakness, Poliwrath typically requires the support of multiple Psychic-type Pokemon, making both Hypno and Kadabra standard partners. Pokemon like Tangela, Dragonite, Dugtrio, and Golem are also good for patching up weak spots that Poliwrath might bring to a team. Agility sweepers like Articuno, Dodrio, and Dragonite appreciate Hypnosis incapacitating a key Pokemon or providing them with an opportunity to set up.</p>"
        },
        "Amnesia": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>After Hypnosis, Amnesia is the next most interesting option available to Poliwrath. Successfully setting up with Amnesia is fairly difficult in RBY UU, primarily due to the abundant use of Wrap. While Poliwrath doesn’t suffer a ton of damage from Wrap, it is not uncommon for a Pokemon such as Tentacruel to switch in as Poliwrath first uses Amnesia, use Wrap to chip it, and pivot out to something that can pick Poliwrath off. This issue is worsened by the fact that Amnesia does nothing for Poliwrath’s weakness to Drill Peck, meaning Dodrio can always knock out Poliwrath once its health drops below 50%. Additionally, Poliwrath competes with the already uncommon Golduck in this role, which has superior typing and Speed for an easier time when setting up. However, Amnesia still demands a lot of respect to deal with, meaning that it can drive very predictable switches that can be exploited. For example, if the opponent relies on Tentacruel to pressure Amnesia Poliwrath, mixing in Hypnosis or Earthquake can harshly punish the switch-in.</p> <p>If the opponent lacks strong options to finish off a weakened Poliwrath, like Kadabra or Dodrio, Amnesia becomes a lot more practical. Even if Wrap is still on the table, Poliwrath’s above-average physical bulk enables it to stomach a few hits as it waits for misses, during which it can boost, attack, or heal with Rest. If Wrap isn’t present, Poliwrath really only fears critical and being frozen, meaning it can set up in front of a surprisingly large number of Pokemon, most notably Articuno and bulky Water-type Pokemon. Surf is generally the special move of choice due to STAB and its high PP. At +4 Special, Surf will 2HKO every neutral target in the tier. At +6, Surf can 3HKO even the mighty Vaporeon, meaning nothing can Rest stall Poliwrath. Blizzard is often used alongside Surf for perfect coverage against everything but Water-type Pokemon. It also allows Poliwrath to threaten Dragonite, Venusaur, and Tangela without boosting. Earthquake and Hypnosis can alternatively be used to punish common switch-ins to Amnesia Poliwrath, most notably Tentacruel. Hypnosis can also potentially net Poliwrath a free turn to set up, which can be crucial for extra damage or bulk.</p> <p>Amnesia Poliwrath requires a lot of support to function properly, as a number of things can go wrong. Dodrio and Venusaur are entirely unfazed by Poliwrath’s boosting and can reliably KO it once it drops below 50%, so Pokemon that can handle them are quite helpful; these include Rock-, Ice-, and Flying-type Pokemon. Pokemon like Dugtrio, Kadabra, and Kangaskhan can pressure common Poliwrath switch-ins like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, Hypno, and Kadabra, which can often come in for free when the opponent expects Poliwrath to use Amnesia. This makes Pokemon like Dugtrio, Kanagaskhan, and Kadabra notable partners. If Poliwrath is not running Hypnosis, sleepers like Haunter, Venusaur, and Tangela are good choices, as they help it find free turns to set up or quickly dispatch a key threat. Paralysis spreaders make it hard for physical attackers like Persian and Kangaskhan to punish Poliwrath while it is asleep from Rest.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Poliwrath's ugly typing and unremarkable stats give it a lot of trouble in RBY OU, but access to the rare Amnesia gives it a real niche as a wallbreaker. Unlike Amnesia users such as Slowbro and Snorlax, Poliwrath lacks the stats and typing to become unbreakable, but its Speed gives it a niche over them. Poliwrath outspeeds Exeggutor and can nail it with Blizzard after some chip damage, rather than having to fear Sleep Powder and Explosion like the other Amnesia users in the tier. It also possesses immediate threats against Chansey in the form of Hypnosis and Submission, which OHKOes with a critical hit.</p> <p>However, while Poliwrath possesses these advantages over Slowbro, it suffers from all of Slowbro's flaws and more. It needs a lot of setup to break past Starmie and Chansey, which often threaten it with Thunderbolt, and it is vulnerable to Psychic, making Pokemon like Alakazam and Jynx much more problematic than they are for Slowbro. Like Slowbro, even after setting up, Poliwrath needs to watch for enemy Explosions that can stop the party before it even starts. Perhaps most importantly of all, Slowbro is able to heal itself throughout the game and provide utility thanks to superior defensive stats paired with Thunder Wave, while Poliwrath does not possess the bulk nor the movepool to be anything other than a one-time breaker.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Poliwrath's Hydro Pumps deal incredible damage after only a few turns of Amnesia, which it can often find against paralyzed or sleeping foes, and it is capable of taking down multiple Pokemon in a single game if its primary checks, usually Starmie and Chansey, are either KOed by teammates or statused and weakened enough to be handled by Poliwrath itself. While inconsistent, Poliwrath is a Pokemon that can lead to good results if you build towards its strengths.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Amnesia": {
          "description": "<p>Poliwrath's viability in OU revolves around the combination of Amnesia and Hydro Pump. All would-be checks fall to it if they allow enough free turns: Starmie has great odds to be 2HKOed at +4, Alakazam is 2HKOed at +2 and OHKOed at +6, and even Chansey cannot survive two +6 Hydro Pumps. Other Pokemon that may attempt to finish off a weakened or crippled Poliwrath are also significantly easier to take down with Hydro Pump than with Surf: Snorlax is OHKOed by +6 Hydro Pump but always stomachs a +6 Surf, while +4 is enough to drop Tauros. While the prospects of Hydro Pump's accuracy and PP will understandably scare players off, the favorable ranges this move reaches are simply too important.</p> <p>In the third slot, a tool against Exeggutor is highly recommended: Blizzard will hit for over half its HP after a single Amnesia, but if the team has no plans to put any other foes to sleep, then Hypnosis is also a valid way of threatening it, while also doubling as a way for Poliwrath to give itself free turns. For the last slot, many options are viable: Submission provides an immediate critical hit OHKO threat on Chansey, though the accuracy and recoil make it fairly inconsistent, while Surf's accuracy can be appreciated in specific scenarios where the extra damage from Hydro Pump is not required. Other options such as Body Slam, Counter, Psychic, and Rest can also have merits in very specific scenarios but are strongly discouraged, as they do not contribute to Poliwrath's primary purpose as a wallbreaker.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>While Abra may initially seem like one of PU's top threats thanks to its massive Special, high Speed, excellent Psychic typing, and access to Thunder Wave, the tier is extremely hostile to it, and it's barely viable as a result. Abra is held back by its horrendous physical bulk; despite its base 90 Speed outpacing key threats like Nidoqueen and Gastly, numerous foes such as Scyther, Fearow, Rapidash, Magmar, and Arcanine can outspeed and OHKO Abra. Teams with Abra can use Rock-types to check these faster foes, but they are exploitable and better suited supporting other Pokemon. While not as bad of a matchup, slower physical attackers like Pinsir can also beat Abra one-on-one even if they have to take a hit or paralysis first. To make matters worse, despite Abra's higher Special, the Fire-types actually do more damage to neutral targets due to Fire Blast having a higher Base Power than Psychic. Despite its access to Thunder Wave, Abra's frailty means it fears paralysis more than just about every other Pokemon in PU. One notable paralysis spreader is Drowzee, a foe that both counters Abra and turns it into a liability by threatening to spread status to its teammates. While Drowzee cannot match Abra's Speed and power, its higher bulk and access to Hypnosis gives Abra major competition as a Psychic-type status spreader.</p> <p>Abra's one saving grace is its fantastic Gastly matchup. Abra outspeeds Gastly, 2HKOes it with Psychic, threatens paralysis against its team if it switches out, and takes minimal damage from Gastly's Psychic and Thunderbolt. Unlike Drowzee, Abra outspeeding Gastly means Hypnosis is far less reliable against it, and once Sleep Clause is active Abra dominates Gastly like no other Pokemon in PU. It puts Gastly in a terrible situation if it doesn't have Drowzee supporting it, letting Abra enable teammates that fear Gastly such as Seaking and Scyther. Gastly isn't the only reason to use Abra, because it does have a few other favorable matchups, such as Nidoqueen and many Porygon variants.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Reflect looks like an enticing option to increase Abra's physical bulk, notably letting it dodge OHKOs from the plethora of Hyper Beam users. However, Abra's lack of reliable recovery and the need for a free turn to set it up makes Reflect difficult to use, especially when many Hyper Beam users outspeed Abra. Additionally, Reflect is useless against Scyther and Pinsir due to Slash, and it can often be useless against common foes such as Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow due to their high critical hit rates. Rest is an extremely niche option that allows Abra to dominate Porygon sets that only have Psychic as an attacking move, though it is useless against every other relevant foe.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Scyther, Fearow, Arcanine, Magmar, and Rapidash outspeed Abra; the former three always OHKO it with Hyper Beam, and the latter two have a very high chance to OHKO it with their own Hyper Beam. Fearow also has a 51.3% chance to OHKO Abra with Double-Edge, and Scyther has a 74.4% chance to OHKO Abra with Slash. However, these threats have difficulty switching into Psychic and hate getting paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Drowzee and Slowpoke resist Psychic and are only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss. Both can paralyze Abra with Thunder Wave, and in return they don't mind Abra's Thunder Wave that much. Drowzee can also 3HKO Abra with Seismic Toss. As a result, both Pokemon can switch into Abra with ease and force it to sacrifice itself or make a teammate risk taking status or a powerful attack.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: While it's outsped and dislikes being paralyzed, Pinsir is only 3HKOed by Psychic and OHKOes Abra back with Slash. Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave and 3HKOed by Psychic, and it OHKOes Abra with Earthquake 92.3% of the time. Abra outspeeds and 2HKOes Machamp and Graveler, but they can also tank a hit in a pinch and retaliate; the former OHKOes Abra with Hyper Beam, and the latter has a 76.9% chance to OHKO it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave Users</strong>: Thunder Wave users such as Staryu, Porygon, and Dragonair can paralyze Abra and leave it helpless against every physical attacker in the tier. However, they struggle to tank Abra's Psychic and hate being paralyzed themselves.</p>",

        "Special Attacker": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Psychic serves as Abra's primary attack, and it's very spammable thanks to Abra's high Special and how few Pokemon resist it. Seismic Toss is Abra's strongest attack against Psychic-types like Drowzee, opposing Abra, and the rare Slowpoke. Thunder Wave lets Abra spread paralysis, though it should be used carefully given that the majority of the tier either has a strong physical attack or their own Thunder Wave; many are also more threatened by Abra's Psychic. Thunder Wave is best used when Abra forces something out or when sacrificing Abra is worth paralyzing a foe back, such as against Porygon. Substitute is another tool to let Abra exploit switches, but it still leaves Abra vulnerable to paralysis. Counter can be used instead to punish foes using physical attacks like Body Slam to predict Abra switching out, but Hyper Beam will often OHKO Abra even at full health.</p> <p>Abra should generally be used as an answer to Gastly, usually switching in after Sleep Clause is active, though it can find switch-in opportunities when Gastly uses a special move against a foe such as Seaking or weakened Nidoqueen or in a double switch against a predicted Gastly switch-in. Once on the field, Abra dissuades Gastly from switching out thanks to its powerful Psychic and Thunder Wave. Even if Gastly survives Abra's Psychic and uses Explosion to trade with it, Abra's team no longer having to worry about such a dangerous threat is generally an advantageous trade. If Gastly ceases to be a concern, Abra has a good matchup against Porygon variants that lack Double-Edge, taking minimal damage from its attacks and threatening paralysis and Special drops with Psychic. Nidoqueen is another foe Abra is adept at taking on, rarely being OHKOed by its Earthquake while outspeeding and 2HKOing it. Omanyte and Graveler are useful partners to Abra thanks to their ability to check the Fire-types that outspeed and usually OHKO Abra, as well as Fearow and Scyther. Notably, they force mind games where the faster threat must decide between using Hyper Beam to OHKO Abra before it can paralyze them or using another attack against the incoming Rock-type to avoid having to recharge. Abra also aids the Rock-types against Staryu, as it easily switches into Staryu's Surf and either paralyzes Staryu or KOes it outright if it has taken prior damage such as if it switched into Graveler's Earthquake. However, Fearow and Scyther can somewhat bypass the guessing game, since they have attacks besides Hyper Beam that can OHKO Abra. Fast threats such as Fearow, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Scyther also make great partners, as they can trade hits with their opposing counterparts and overwhelm slower paralysis spreaders for Abra. Scyther is notably appreciative of Abra handling Gastly for it. Sandslash, while rare, is immune to Thunder Wave and 3HKOed by Psychic while it can OHKO Abra back, so Abra must play very cautiously if Sandslash is spotted on the opposing team.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Abra narrowly edges out Mr. Mime as the strongest Psychic-type special attacker in NU, and its base 90 Speed allows it to Speed tie with Mr. Mime, Moltres, and Venomoth and outspeed much of the tier. This makes it one of the tier's most potent special attackers and revenge killers, threatening notable Pokemon like Nidoking, Venomoth, and Kingler. Thunder Wave lets Abra crucially force out faster threats like Charizard and Electrode, as Charizard can only OHKO it 20% of the time with Hyper Beam and does not want to take paralysis for this chance. Abra can also occasionally turn its physical frailty to its advantage, sending back a near-lethal attack from Clefable or Charizard for immense damage with Counter.</p> <p>Abra's frailty cannot be overstated, however. Abra is so unfathomably frail that even stray coverage moves like Blastoise's Body Slam and Venomoth's Double-Edge easily 2HKO it; stronger moves, like Kingler, Clefable, and Raticate's Hyper Beam and Kabutops's Slash, are guaranteed to OHKO it. This means it essentially cannot switch into anything and will usually be forced out immediately after any revenge kill. It especially fears Raticate, which easily OHKOes it and is impossible to safely switch into. If Abra faces down a Raticate, it becomes a liability and likely has to be sacrificed. Abra also lacks recovery, so it cannot effectively switch into and check Mr. Mime despite resisting Psychic.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Psychic 2HKOes Psychic-weak foes like Nidoking and Venomoth and 3HKOes most neutral targets bar Moltres. Thunder Wave allows Abra to force out faster foes like Charizard and Electrode as long as it's fully healthy; even slight chip damage gives Charizard an easy OHKO with Hyper Beam, Slash, or even Earthquake. Seismic Toss is Abra's best option against Mr. Mime and helps to 4HKO Exeggcute after using Psychic twice to fish for critical hits or Special drops, which can sometimes allow Psychic to 3HKO it. Counter lets Abra exploit opposing predictions, as the opponent may be reluctant to use Hyper Beam against it, fearing a Rock-type; if Abra manages to catch a Body Slam or similar from a foe predicting this, it can return massive but usually nonlethal damage. Notably, however, it is guaranteed to OHKO Charizard by returning Slash and Kingler by returning Body Slam. Substitute is a rare option Abra may use to fish for paralysis or attempt to catch a foe switching out, allowing it to stay in and continue to fight, potentially even paralyzing the switch-in and fishing for another Substitute.</p> <p>Abra should always be used alongside Mr. Mime, as Mr. Mime is nearly a strict upgrade. Teams can use them in tandem to spread paralysis and deal massive, near-unresisted damage with Psychic. Such teams are very physically frail, and Abra benefits from an ally like Golem that can absorb physical attacks and especially Hyper Beam attempts before firing back. Abra also enjoys allies that really want Mr. Mime out of the way, like Kingler, which can also switch into Charizard for it. Abra can work well as a lead, trading paralysis and using Seismic Toss against Mr. Mime or paralyzing Charizard and landing one more hit in the vast majority of cases. This frees up allies like Mr. Mime, Charizard, and Blastoise to trade hits with other threats or clean up later. Abra can be used outside of being the lead, in which case it appreciates support from teammates that can spread paralysis, such as Venomoth and Clefable, as well as assistance in checking faster threats, such as from Golem, which checks Charizard and Electrode. Abra is hard to fit in this role, however, and often requires giving up Pokemon like Charizard or using an excessively frail team that can be punished by threats like Golem and Electrode.</p>"

  "Kadabra": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Kadabra is generally considered good in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Even though Kadabra isn't fully evolved, it is one of the premier choices in RBY UU due to its base 105 Speed and base 120 Special. These stats give it a high volatility factor, with a 20.5% critical hit rate combined with the 33.2% chance of a Special drop from an already powerful Psychic. It outspeeds many other Pokemon in the tier and can either hit them hard or cripple them with paralysis. This includes the ever-present Tentacruel, which is outsped and takes massive damage from the strongest Psychic in the tier or loses a lot of its effectiveness if paralyzed. This makes Kadabra an effective anti-lead choice, as Tentacruel is perhaps the most common lead in UU. Due to Kadabra's high Special stat, it can also switch in and tank special attacks surprisingly well.</p> <p>However, Kadabra is not quite in the conversation for being the best Pokemon in the tier. It is walled hard by Hypno, arguably the second-best Pokemon in RBY UU behind Tentacruel. It's almost a given that when your Kadabra is in, your opponent's Hypno will not be far behind, as Kadabra can only really chip it with Seismic Toss or fish for a Special drop with Psychic. In addition, Kadabra is pitifully frail on the physical side, with only base 40 HP and 30 Defense. It has to watch out for Persian especially, which outspeeds it and hits it hard with STAB Slash. Many other physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dodrio can 2HKO or even OHKO Kadabra, meaning that you need to tread carefully, especially if Kadabra is paralyzed. That said, its positives as a strong and fast Psychic-type far outweigh its negatives, and it can find a place on most RBY UU teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>If you're replacing any move, Seismic Toss is the one to replace. Counter can surprise physical attackers and net some surprise KOs, especially in the niche scenario where you use Explosion with Haunter or Golem and then bring Kadabra in and Counter your own Explosion. Counter can also force Hypno to have to use Rest sooner if it is spamming Seismic Toss. However, your own Seismic Toss is generally a better and more consistent damage dealer, especially to opposing Psychic-types. Reflect can be used to increase survivability, but even with this Defense boost, Kadabra is still pretty frail; it still takes over 50% on Hyper Beams from some of the stronger physical attackers in the tier, such as Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Again, Seismic Toss is almost always the better choice here.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Hypno</strong>: Hypno is easily the best check to Kadabra, as it's on the vast majority of RBY UU teams anyway and stonewalls everything that Kadabra tries to do. If you bring in Kadabra to attempt a revenge kill, you can be sure that your opponent will bring in Hypno to negate your plans with ease. Hypno can easily tank Psychic and is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, meaning that it can recover off any damage Kadabra deals and rid itself of Thunder Wave paralysis with Rest. Therefore, outside of getting lucky with Special drops from Psychic or full paralysis, you probably won't be KOing Hypno with Kadabra, and Kadabra will most likely need to use Recover and switch out. Worse still, Hypno can paralyze Kadabra with Thunder Wave, hampering its usefulness for the rest of the game, or even put it to sleep with Hypnosis, which is normally a death sentence in any RBY tier.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Kadabra</strong>: Kadabra also does a decent job at checking itself. If the opponent's Kadabra is already paralyzed, it can switch in to absorb a Thunder Wave from your Kadabra. From there, it can threaten with its own Thunder Wave. Most Kadabra versus Kadabra matchups start with them paralyzing each other, and then it becomes a battle of Seismic Toss and Recover until one switches out or faints.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio gets a special mention as a check because it can switch in on a Thunder Wave for free and threaten a KO on Kadabra if it is at 70% health or below. Dugtrio is one of the few Pokemon that can outspeed Kadabra and 2HKO it; unless Kadabra scores a critical hit with Psychic, Dugtrio wins the head-to-head matchup from full health. Furthermore, since Kadabra is the best Tentacruel check in the entire tier, it often comes in on Wrap to wait out the attack and then scare out Tentacruel once it ends, but since Wrap immobilizes Kadabra and does chip damage, Tentacruel can whittle Kadabra down just enough so that Dugtrio can switch in while Kadabra is unable to attack and is in the range of Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Due to Kadabra's low HP and Defense, many strong physical attackers threaten it. To start, Persian outspeeds Kadabra and easily 2HKOes with Slash, meaning, much like Dugtrio, it wins the one-on-one from full health unless Psychic lands a critical hit. Dodrio and Kangaskhan are both outsped by Kadabra and don't like being paralyzed, but they have a guaranteed OHKO on Kadabra with Hyper Beam, making them scary to face. Raticate also can OHKO Kadabra 74.4% of the time with Hyper Beam, putting it in a similar category to the aforementioned Normal-types. Other physical attackers that can OHKO Kadabra with Hyper Beam include Dragonite and Gyarados. Though these attackers have much lower chances to OHKO, they are still scary in their own right with Body Slam. Finally, Aerodactyl has proven its worth in RBY UU and can outspeed and KO Kadabra from 74.9-88.3% health with Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno, though not as common of a selection as some previously mentioned Pokemon, is similar to Hypno as a check because it can sponge hits and heal off damage and paralysis with Rest. Both Psychic and Seismic Toss are only 4HKOs on Articuno, meaning that it should be able to survive most encounters. Articuno can also use Agility to shrug off the paralysis Speed drop and become akin to a Hustle sweeper in later generations with a 75% chance to move. What makes Articuno an especially good check, however, is that it can 2HKO Kadabra over 80% of the time with two Blizzards, or always 2HKO with Blizzard into Hyper Beam. Add in the threat of freeze with Blizzard or Ice Beam, and Articuno is a check that can send Kadabra running.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the bread-and-butter set that you'll see virtually every Kadabra run, and for good reason. As mentioned before, Kadabra has the strongest Psychic in the tier and will hit pretty much everything except Hypno and opposing Kadabra for consistent damage. Thunder Wave is used to paralyze foes, most notably dangerous Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite. After paralysis, Wrap only connects about 66% of the time, which severely hampers the Wrap user's effectiveness. Seismic Toss is Kadabra's go-to damage option against Hypno and opposing Kadabra, and Recover increases Kadabra's longevity, especially over the course of long games where you may need to PP stall opposing Psychic-types. For example, against Hypno that may opt for Hypnosis over Seismic Toss, Kadabra will have the upper hand.</p> <p>Using Kadabra is an exercise in how well you can spread damage with Psychic and paralysis with Thunder Wave while avoiding it taking physical attacks and paralysis yourself. This can mean having to predict your opponent's switches, which is not always an easy task. This is why Kadabra appreciates Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite on its side to get a free switch-in. Once switched in, Kadabra's job is made a little easier because just by using Psychic, it can get good luck with its naturally high 20.5% critical hit rate and 33.2% chance to drop the other Pokemon's Special. That said, relying on that volatility can put Kadabra in a bad spot against Pokemon that can exploit its physical frailty. Clever switching or a Thunder Wave to catch and paralyze such an attacker may be what is needed to turn the tide of battle in your favor. Just keep in mind that your opponent could have Dugtrio lurking to absorb paralysis, and then your Kadabra could be in trouble, as Dugtrio outspeeds Kadabra and KOes it with Earthquake if it is at about 70% health.</p> <p>Kadabra is certainly not dead weight when it's paralyzed, as paralysis actually allows it to switch in against sleep users, such as Hypno and Haunter, with little fear. However, it does become harder to use and much easier to revenge kill. Thus, pairing it with a Ground-type that can absorb opposing Thunder Waves like Dugtrio or Golem is a good choice. Just be sure that your Ground-type has enough health to deal with the Thunder Wave user it is switching into. In addition, Flying-types such as Dragonite, Articuno, and Dodrio can help deal with the aforementioned Dugtrio problem by switching in for free on an Earthquake. Haunter is also a good partner for Kadabra given the prevalence of strong Normal-type moves in RBY. Haunter is immune to these moves that can KO Kadabra easily, as well as Wrap. Bulky Water-types such as Omastar and Vaporeon can also check these strong physical attackers. Haunter and Omastar notably form the strongest anti-Wrap core in RBY UU; this is a godsend for a physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra. They pair well with Kadabra because wasting sleep turns against Wrap users to wake Kadabra up is not ideal, as Kadabra takes 6-7% from Tentacruel and 9.1-10.9% from Dragonite on each hit.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "tradebacksou": {
      "overview": "<p>Alakazam received some serious upgrades in Tradebacks OU, gaining the elemental punches to give it coverage outside of Seismic Toss. However, its usual roles remain: Alakazam is a strong lead, revenge killer, and paralysis support guru thanks to its exceptional Speed—allowing it to outrun even Persian—a trait which also gives it a fantastic critical hit rate. Indeed, Alakazam's offense allows it to close out end games very quickly if left unparalyzed. With effectively no weaknesses thanks to its typing, Alakazam has notable defensive utility; it can switch into Pokemon like Chansey and opposing Psychic-types like Starmie, Hypno, and opposing Alakazam. These traits culminate to form a strong, multi-faceted threat that can be used at any stage of the game with few truly losing matchups.</p> <p>However, Alakazam is not flawless, as its physical bulk is very poor. If paralyzed, while it's an amazing sleep blocker thereafter, it's also very vulnerable to Pokemon like Snorlax, Tauros, and Persian, which eat it alive. Furthermore, Psychic's PP only goes so far, and this is what defines Alakazam: it must be used conservatively. Alakazam has a very difficult time breaking past the mandatory Chansey without a mix of full paralysis, critical hits, and Special drops, and even if it succeeds, it's not going to sweep thereafter. Alakazam also finds itself cancelled out by opposing Psychic-types, which, similar to Chansey, often goad it into prolonged interactions that leave it with little attacking PP thereafter.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Alakazam's movepool is deeper than it seems, making customization very possible. Generally, Psychic and Recover should never be dropped, as they are the roots of its power and longevity. Sets using two of Seismic Toss, Thunder Punch, and Ice Punch are possible if dropping Thunder Wave, but this significantly reduces its threat level against Pokemon like Tauros, which become capable of trading hits with it once the set is revealed. All things considered, Alakazam's single coverage moveslot is the most droppable, and anything further than that is ill-advised.</p> <p>Barrier is a significant upgrade to the classic Reflect Alakazam set from regular RBY OU, letting Alakazam stack Defense buffs and reapply the Speed drop from Thunder Wave paralysis. These traits make it a lot stronger against Pokemon like Snorlax long-term, and because it can reapply the paralysis Speed drop, its own paralysis-absorbing antics are far more effective. However, all of this comes with a crucial caveat: it has to drop its coverage, leaving it with just 16 attacking PP in Psychic, which is generally undesirable in a metagame with high bulk and lots of recovery. If its checks are removed, though, Barrier Alakazam can spark endgame scenarios that are very difficult for opponents to dig out of.</p> <p>Counter gives Alakazam more utility against opposing Seismic Toss Alakazam, severely damaging it if it lands. It also has utility against Pokemon like Snorlax, which can't OHKO Alakazam without extremely strong attacks like Hyper Beam. Outside of this, bringing in Alakazam after a Pokemon like Tauros has KOed something to threaten paralysis and instead go for Counter allows it to severely damage a switch-in, possibly even landing a free KO.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Alakazam's low physical bulk makes it highly vulnerable to physical attacks if paralyzed. Tauros, Persian, Rhydon, and Snorlax all mortally threaten it on this front, especially if switching in on a recovery turn. If Alakazam has taken even minor damage, all of these Pokemon are capable of threatening it with a KO.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Because it relies on Psychic, Alakazam tends to find itself in awkward situations against opposing Psychic-types, with them often cancelling each other out. While its elemental punches can allow it to specialize in defeating Starmie or Exeggutor quickly, it can still find itself walled due to the hole in its coverage, and prolonged interactions involving Seismic Toss can result in it being taken out by repeated full paralysis. Surf variants of Starmie can be particularly dicey, with critical hits dealing massive damage. Plus, if the opposing team has more than one Psychic-type, or a Chansey to go with it, the opponent can mitigate Special drops from Psychic by switching between them.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is a royal pain for Alakazam, healing off any damage Alakazam dishes out thanks to its monstrous special bulk and access to Soft-Boiled. In lead situations, Chansey also likes to switch in on turn 1 to take paralysis and put Alakazam to sleep. However, even with just Psychic, Alakazam can force its way through with a mix of critical hits, Special drops, and repeated full paralysis, albeit with a significant hit to its attacking PP.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor resists Psychic and is often willing to take paralysis if it means putting Alakazam to sleep. If Alakazam isn't running Seismic Toss or Ice Punch, Exeggutor also shrugs off any damage taken, giving it more opportunities to incapacitate Alakazam.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro would love nothing more than to trade a Thunder Wave with Alakazam, set up Amnesia to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis to become faster, and than just blow past and deal massive damage to the opposing team. If Alakazam has Thunder Punch, it can often win out short-term with a 3HKO or win out later with critical hits. Seismic Toss also works for forcing Slowbro to use Rest, which leaves it open for a stronger attacker to come in and force Slowbro out.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Alakazam's Psychic is nothing to scoff at, dealing massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it, with Alakazam's high critical hit rate and Psychic's chance for a Special drop frequently able to turn 3HKO ranges into 2HKOs frequently. Psychic can potentially 2HKO Rhydon, Persian, and even Tauros if either occurs. Alakazam's Speed makes its Thunder Wave largely uncontested in many instances, forcing slower Pokemon like Starmie and Gengar out if they wish to remain threatening later. Recover's 32 PP gives Alakazam excellent longevity, ensuring it can remain offensively threatening for long periods of time.</p> <p>The choice of coverage for Alakazam in Tradebacks OU requires a good bit of forethought. Seismic Toss remains its most consistent option: its fixed damage and the low HP of opposing Alakazam and Starmie mean it should win most interactions against foes that resist Psychic. It also makes Exeggutor far more inclined to use Explosion if even one connects, as it lacks recovery. Ice Punch functions similarly, improving Alakazam's matchups against Exeggutor, Rhydon, Zapdos, and Dragonite. It can also let Alakazam fish for freeze against Chansey, though it's unreliable against it due to the possibility of Alakazam being overwhelmed by repeated full paralysis and Seismic Toss. Thunder Punch allows Alakazam to be far stronger against Starmie, 2HKOing it with even a tiny bit of prior chip damage. It also improves Alakazam's matchups against Lapras, Cloyster, Articuno, and the niche Vapeoreon. However, if running the new elemental punches, Alakazam will always lose to something unless it drops its trusty Thunder Wave: running Psychic + Thunder Punch means it loses to Exeggutor, while Psychic + Ice Punch means it loses to Starmie and gets set up on by Slowbro and Vaporeon. Simply put, these moves improve its consistency in some matchups but forfeit others, so they should be used in cases where a less consistent but more potent Alakazam is affordable.</p> <p>Alakazam makes for a strong lead, as it can paralyze virtually any target before they can make a move, something notably effective when paired with physical sleepers like Snorlax and Persian, which can break through paralyzed Psychic-types and Chansey. Gengar and Persian tend to be forced out; if it isn't for the Thunder Wave, it's for Alakazam's devastating Psychic. In some situations it can force out opposing Starmie, which might want to avoid getting paralyzed. This is usually to Chansey, which absorbs Thunder Wave well and can threaten with Sing thereafter. If faced with a sleep lead like Jynx, Alakazam is content with taking sleep, as it can wake up against opposing Psychic-types like Exeggutor, Hypno, and non-Seismic Toss Alakazam. Against sleep lead Alakazam has a positive matchup against, such as Gengar and Persian, Alakazam is best off using Thunder Wave and pressuring the switch-in or double switching into a sleeper. Chansey is also relatively easy to wake up on if it lacks Seismic Toss. Given its speed and power, Alakazam is also usable in the back as a strong late-game cleaner. The elemental punches let Alakazam excel here so long as its teammates remove its checks. Starmie makes for a strong partner here, making use of the coverage Alakazam lacks to form a concentrated offensive core with a strong backbone. In the case Alakazam is used in the back, it should avoid paralysis in most situations, but adapting Alakazam's role to the situation at hand is essential for succeeding with it.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Alakazam's great typing and stellar base stats give it the most threatening Psychic in the tier and more Speed than every viable Pokemon bar Jolteon. Even with Stadium's changes, it maintains a 19.1% critical hit rate; in conjunction with paralysis and Special drops, this allows Psychic to eventually break through even Chansey and Psychic-resistant foes. Alakazam has exceptional moves in Thunder Wave and Recover, granting it considerable utility against most threats. Alakazam can serve as a status spreader, special wall, and potential sweeper; its Speed allows it to use Substitute to block Thunder Waves and preserve its sweeping potential. It can also function well when paralyzed, as it becomes a reasonable status absorber. A paralyzed Alakazam has its limits, however—physical threats like Snorlax and Tauros can outspeed and 2HKO it or set up Substitute to thwart its Thunder Wave.  Alakazam faces another obstacle in the pervasive Rest Exeggutor, which can stall out its Seismic Toss and threaten it with Stun Spore and Double-Edge. Nevertheless, Alakazam is an extremely common sight thanks to its versatility and support capability.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reflect is a shaky alternative to Substitute; its benefits are outweighed by the fact it doesn't protect Alakazam from critical hits or status. Counter theoretically allows Alakazam to surprise physical attackers, but mechanics changes in Stadium reduce its utility. Alakazam's low HP also means it will rarely OHKO attackers and risks Body Slam paralysis, neutering it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Once Alakazam is paralyzed, Snorlax, Tauros, Rhydon, Persian, Kangaskhan, and other physically potent threats can switch in on Recover and threaten Alakazam. None of these like taking Psychics, though, and most despise Thunder Wave. However, attempting to paralyze physical Pokemon is risky once they are already in, as they can potentially block it with Substitute and become even more difficult to stop.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggutor and Slowbro both check Alakazam; Exeggutor can threaten it with Double-Edge and Stun Spore, while Slowbro can set up Amnesia freely. Both also carry Rest to thwart Thunder Wave and heal off Seismic Toss. Despite this, Seismic Toss will eventually force them to use Rest, providing opportunities to pressure them with other attackers. Starmie and opposing Alakazam can also hamstring Alakazam with Thunder Wave, stall it with Recover, or force it to Recover and switch to a physical attacker, potentially catching Alakazam as it fully paralyzes. However, this comes at a cost, as Starmie and Alakazam will almost certainly be paralyzed in the process.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's special bulk and access to instant recovery in Soft-Boiled allows it to sponge multiple Psychics from Alakazam, giving it room to use Thunder Wave or inflict chip damage so a physical teammate can switch in on its Recover. With some luck, though, Alakazam can break through paralyzed Chansey, particularly if it is already chipped prior to switching in. Chansey especially has trouble against Substitute Alakazam if it lacks Seismic Toss, as none of its other moves are capable of breaking Substitute in one hit.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Psychic is a threat to any non-resistant Pokemon—even Chansey cannot withstand extended exposure if it is paralyzed. Thunder Wave is irreplacable, as paralysis is what allows Alakazam to break down Chansey and opposing Psychic-types. Unlike in RBY, however, Substitute blocks Thunder Wave, making it a risky move if Alakazam is paralyzed itself—fast physical users like Tauros, Persian, and Kangaskhan become much more threatening if given the opportunity to set it up. Recover lets Alakazam heal off damage, but can invite in physical attackers if Alakazam is paralyzed. Seismic Toss is strongly recommended, as it allows Alakazam to pressure opposing Psychic-types effectively while saving Psychic PP, but Substitute can be used instead to protect Alakazam from status moves and critical hits, making it an effective late-game sweeper if opposing Psychic-types are removed. Chansey cannot break Substitute in one hit without Seismic Toss, so Alakazam can pressure BoltBeam Chansey safely. Furthermore, Substitute can help Alakazam PP stall some foes more effectively, as Alakazam won't be vulnerable to secondary effects from damaging moves when using it. Unfortunately, Substitute Alakazam itself is much easier to PP stall by switching between Psychic-types and Chansey to waste PP.</p> <p>Alakazam is better used in the back, but as a lead it sports fair matchups against Chansey and the rare Jynx, as it can paralyze them with Thunder Wave and then proceed to pressure them with Psychic or Seismic Toss. Unfortunately, Exeggutor is the most common lead and fares well against it, as Exeggutor can scout for Substitute with Double-Edge and hamstring it with Stun Spore when it is forced to use Recover. Snorlax performs well against Alakazam too; Body Slam 2HKOes and threatens paralysis simultaneously. Alakazam can choose to take paralysis and become a decent status absorber, providing an avenue to protect teammates like Reflect Chansey from paralysis so it can switch into and wall Snorlax for Alakazam. However, this forfeits its excellent Speed. Unparalyzed Alakazam can revenge kill fast offensive threats like Tauros, Zapdos, and the rare Persian, threaten them with Thunder Wave, and act as a sweeper.</p> <p>Psychic's ability to break past paralyzed Chansey can provide an opportunity for Alakazam to paralyze a Pokemon when Chansey switches out or use Seismic Toss to pressure paralyzed Psychic-types as they enter. In an Alakazam mirror match, the typical strategy is to paralyze the opposing Alakazam, use Seismic Toss to chip it down, and switch out to a physical attacker when it is expected to use Recover. Unlike in RBY, Special drops from Psychic no longer reapply the paralysis Speed penalty, so there is little reason to waste Psychic PP in the mirror match. The threat of Thunder Wave puts pressure on fast Pokemon, such as Starmie and Tauros, to switch out to a paralyzed teammate or Chansey to absorb it. While this means Alakazam will rarely paralyze multiple Pokemon, it can use Psychic or Seismic Toss instead to pressure and potentially overwhelm these status absorbers as they come in, or it can switch out to a physical threat that can deal significantly higher immediate damage to them, like Snorlax.</p> <p>Alakazam works well with teammates that can deal with other Psychic-types and Chansey. Zapdos' STAB moves 2HKO Starmie, Slowbro, and the omnipresent Exeggutor; Zapdos also 3HKOes Chansey and opposing Alakazam. In return, Alakazam can threaten Rhydon and take Psychic and Ice-type moves for Zapdos. Tauros and Persian can threaten most of Alakazam's walls, though care must be taken with them, as they despise being paralyzed. Notably, Persian 3HKOes Exeggutor with Slash, allowing it to switch in on its Rest and KO it or force it out. Alakazam returns the favor by providing valuable paralysis support and dealing with Gengar. Alakazam also appreciates teammates that can switch into physical attackers. Cloyster walls Snorlax and Tauros lacking Thunderbolt, 2HKOes Exeggutor with Blizzard, and leaves Starmie in OHKO range with Explosion. Gengar is another excellent partner, as it can wall Snorlax and Tauros should they lack Earthquake. Offensively, it carries a strong Thunderbolt to hit Starmie and Slowbro, and its Explosion can be used to deal significant damage to Chansey.</p>"

Alakazam is most commonly seen in the lead slot due to possessing excellent Speed and access to Thunder Wave; it outspeeds every Pokemon that has access to a sleep move, allowing it to immediately cripple them with paralysis. It also has the strongest Psychic in OU by virtue of its excellent Special and as such can heavily pressure its most common checks. This Special stat also makes it a decent sponge for opposing moves like Psychic, though its HP limits this slightly. It is also good at absorbing sleep, since it resists Exeggutor's Psychic. Unlike Starmie, Alakazam doesn't have a weakness to Thunderbolt, which can come in handy for absorbing sleep from the likes of Gengar and Lapras. Alakazam can also prove to be very effective outside the lead slot, maintaining excellent utility against various threats and potentially turning into a dangerous sweeper if its most common checks have been removed. However, it can be difficult to consistently keep Alakazam safe from paralysis; if paralyzed, Alakazam often finds its low Defense being exploited by strong physical attackers such as Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros. It's also very reliant on its Psychic, which means it is difficult to break past Chansey. Overall, Alakazam is a regular presence in RBY OU and one of the best Psychic-types available, but its extreme vulnerability to strong physical attacks and paralysis keeps it firmly below the top of the pyramid.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave, Psychic, and Recover should never be dropped. Though the last move is somewhat flexible, Alakazam's movepool is very shallow, so it should generally stick to the options mentioned. Counter has some utility when forcing out threats after the opponent KOed one of your Pokemon with a hard-hitting Normal-type attack from high health, such as Explosion, Self-Destruct, or Hyper Beam. This can be used to force damage against whatever switches in or even outright KO it. It also has situational use in Alakazam mirrors, as countering Seismic Toss can leave the opposing Alakazam severely weakened.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon can hit Alakazam through its weak Defense and KO it, especially if it's paralyzed. They should try to switch in on Recover, though, as Psychic will do a big chunk of damage to all of them. Snorlax deserves a special mention for early-game, as it's crippled way less by paralysis and Psychic damage than the other Pokemon mentioned. Rhydon can also switch in on Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Almost all Psychic-types can check Alakazam, although most of them can be broken through with paralysis and Special drops. Although it generally should not come out early-game, Slowbro is particularly dangerous, as it can set up on Alakazam safely and heal its paralysis with Rest. Starmie and opposing Alakazam can also take Alakazam's Psychic and Seismic Toss and threaten it in return with their own attacks and paralysis, but these matchups can swing either way with repeated full paralysis or Special drops from either side. Surf variants of Starmie are especially dangerous, as they can deal heavy damage to Alakazam. Jynx can be used to check Alakazam in an emergency, but it is passive when doing so, vulnerable to critical hits, and better used for other tasks.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Alakazam is a special attacker, and like all special attackers, Chansey makes a decent check. Chansey can attempt to paralyze Alakazam and pressure with Seismic Toss and to a lesser extent Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. This can force Alakazam to heal with Recover, allowing the opponent to switch into a physical threat. However, due to Psychic's secondary effect, paralysis, and Alakazam's high critical hit rate, Chansey will eventually be forced to either use Soft-Boiled or switch out. Should it get unlucky with full paralysis when trying to use Soft-Boiled, it can even be KOed. It's common to see Chansey switch in on a lead Alakazam and take a Thunder Wave to block sleep later. It can then attempt to put Alakazam to sleep with Sing on the next turn. Chansey can also attempt to fish for a freeze with Ice Beam if Alakazam isn't paralyzed, though this is risky.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch into Alakazam on Turn 1 to immediately try to put it to sleep. However, the opponent would need to be content taking paralysis and getting hit by at least one Seismic Toss, which reduces the longevity of Exeggutor. This makes it much worse at checking Rhydon later in the game. If you try to prevent Alakazam from being paralyzed by switching to Chansey, the opponent gains a huge advantage, as Exeggutor can outspeed Chansey and put it to sleep. In general, though, Exeggutor checks Alakazam well. However, it struggles to pressure Alakazam enough before getting worn down by Seismic Toss, often forcing it to use Explosion.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Alakazam is one of the best leads in RBY OU. Since it's the fastest lead that regularly sees use, it's almost guaranteed to be able to immediately cripple something from the start of the game, be it through paralysis or serious damage with Psychic. This means Alakazam is great for pressuring opposing leads. Against other Alakazam, one generally wants to paralyze it and try to get a physical attacker like Snorlax in on a predicted Recover. However, be careful to not leave the field too damaged, as Exeggutor can have Double-Edge or Hyper Beam to pressure Alakazam. Generally, you don't want to switch out at less than 80% in order for Alakazam to avoid the 2HKO from Exeggutor's Double-Edge most of the time. Gengar leads generally switch out against Alakazam due to the threat of a 2HKO from Psychic as well as an OHKO with a critical hit. Starmie should generally be approached the same way as an opposing Alakazam. However, one must be wary of Chansey when using Thunder Wave early on; its extreme bulk turns it into a phenomenal sleep blocker when paralyzed. As a result, it becomes very difficult to put anything to sleep until the now-paralyzed Chansey is KOed.</p> <p>A lead Alakazam's role, besides crippling the opposing lead, is mostly to absorb sleep. If used in this fashion, Alakazam should absolutely be running Seismic Toss. This allows Alakazam to hit Starmie and Exeggutor rather than waste Psychic's PP. Lead Alakazam can also be used to absorb paralysis from those who propagate it, such as Chansey, Starmie, and other Alakazam. This especially goes for Chansey without Seismic Toss. It's also effective against Starmie without Surf or Psychic, the latter of which can force Alakazam out after a few Special drops. Alakazam also tends to attract physical attackers like Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon on a forced Recover turn. If you can correctly predict the switch, you might be able to sneak in a Thunder Wave or Psychic on them. Moreover, due to Alakazam being one of the few pure special attackers that can force Chansey out, it is also an efficient paralysis spreader that can be used as such throughout the course of the battle.</p> <p>In some situations, you might still resort to using non-lead Alakazam as if it were in the lead slot to check or pressure opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Starmie. It can also be used to function as a sweeper late-game. This strategy revolves around keeping Alakazam hidden, then attempting to clean up once its checks have been removed. Reflect can be used on sweeper Alakazam to give it a much-needed Defense boost, but it also means Alakazam will only have Psychic to attack with. In addition, Reflect Alakazam can still be taken care of through paralysis, critical hits from Tauros and Zapdos, and Explosion. Explosion is especially pressing if paralyzed, as even if Reflect Alakazam survives, it's still easily revenge killed by threats such as Tauros. However, Seismic Toss remains very usable in this context for beating Starmie and other Psychic-types more consistently.</p> <p>When using Alakazam as a sweeper, the rest of the team should work on removing Alakazam's checks before it's revealed. These checks include special sponges such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Pokemon that resist Psychic, such as Slowbro and Exeggutor, are also important to remove. For maintaining maximum sweeping potential, Alakazam should also try to avoid paralysis as much as possible, as its Speed is the reason it's able to compete with other late-game sweepers for a team slot. Ideally, Tauros should also be put in range of Psychic to avoid its high critical hit rate and Body Slam's paralysis chance. Fortunately, that can easily be accomplished through a Tauros mirror, a common scenario in RBY OU battles, since two Body Slams will leave the opponent's Tauros in said range.</p>"

      "outdated": true,
      "overview": "<p>Machamp is a decent blanket check and progress maker in RBY PU due to its decent bulk, base 130 Attack, and decent coverage. It can switch into Nidoqueen, Graveler, and Omanyte and threaten them out with super effective damage, while they threaten Machamp much less in return. Notably, Machamp reliably 2HKOes Nidoqueen with Earthquake while avoiding a 3HKO in return. Although Graveler and Omanyte threaten a 3HKO on Machamp, both are slower and 2HKOed by Earthquake. Machamp's bulk allows it to go toe-to-toe with Pokemon such as Staryu and Porygon, and Machamp can also stop late-game cleaners like Seaking and Scyther with its impressive bulk and Body Slam paralysis chance. Once on the field, Machamp is difficult to force out, as its checks, barring Fearow, cannot switch in safely. While Machamp is outpaced by much of the metagame, its base 55 Speed still gets the job done against noteworthy Pokemon such as Drowzee, Graveler, and Porygon.</p> <p>However, Machamp's Speed is its defining flaw. If given free entry, fast attackers like Fearow can easily force out Machamp with Drill Peck, and if Machamp is at low health, Pokemon like Gastly, Rapidash, Nidoqueen, and Staryu can KO it. While Machamp can switch into a lot of the metagame with its bulk, it can only afford to do so once per game since it gets worn down easily. Even small amounts of chip damage render Machamp incapable of switching into threats, so Machamp tends to get sacrificed for momentum after its first entrance. Similarly, while Machamp's typing means some foes, like Nidoqueen and Arcanine, cannot touch it for super effective damage, its Fighting typing gives it few relevant resistances while giving it a crippling weakness to Drill Peck and Psychic. Machamp's low Speed and role as a switch-in also means that it is often on the receiving end of a burn from Fire Blast or a critical hit from faster foes. Machamp's coverage, while decent, is somewhat prediction-reliant. Earthquake, Rock Slide, Body Slam, and Submission all give free entry to much of the metagame, allowing the opponent to dance around Machamp's coverage and maneuver in something with a better matchup. Pokemon like Gastly and Nidoqueen are only threatened by Machamp's Earthquake, which Fearow can take advantage of. Fearow greatly affects how Machamp is played, as Fearow gaining entry is disastrous due to its one-sided matchup on Machamp. Once Fearow is on the field, the Machamp player is often forced to sacrifice a Pokemon due to Fearow's immense offensive presence. Otherwise-decent moves like Body Slam and Earthquake become risky to use due to the threat of Fearow switching in.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Low Kick is an option to 2HKO Porygon and Omanyte while carrying a 30% chance to flinch. However, Low Kick is still inaccurate and its Base Power is so low that in many situations it is better to use Body Slam for more power. Low Kick also does not deal enough damage to allow Machamp to KO Fearow with Hyper Beam afterward. Fire Blast is another option, but since its main targets, Pinsir and Vileplume, are uncommon, it is not worth using. Fire Blast can also fish for a burn on Fearow, but in most situations it is better to do as much damage as possible with Hyper Beam or Rock Slide.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow is by far the biggest reason not to use Machamp. Fearow is so offensively potent that giving it free entry often guarantees losing a Pokemon. Fearow takes little from Body Slam, is immune to Body Slam paralysis, and is immune to Earthquake, while Fearow's Drill Peck is a likely 2HKO on Machamp. Fearow also has a high critical hit rate, meaning it is not rare to see it OHKO Machamp with Drill Peck. For the Machamp user to defeat a Fearow, Machamp needs to hit Fearow with Submission or Rock Slide as it switches in, avoid being OHKOed by a critical hit Drill Peck, and then land a Hyper Beam or Rock Slide. This is a favorable trade for Machamp, but a single miss or critical hit can flip this interaction on its head, and Machamp loses much of its defensive value after taking one Drill Peck.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Once at low health, there is no shortage of revenge killers that can come in and finish off Machamp, such as Nidoqueen, Arcanine, Gastly, and Fearow. If Machamp is paralyzed, Drowzee and Graveler can also come in and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Despite hitting them super effectively with Earthquake, Machamp must be wary of Rapidash and Arcanine since they have a 30% chance to inflict a burn with Fire Blast, which ruins Machamp.</p> <p><strong>Sleepers</strong>: Machamp cannot 2HKO Vileplume, and Vileplume can safely switch in and use Sleep Powder, even if Machamp is carrying Fire Blast. Gastly can switch into a Submission or Body Slam and use Hypnosis or deal significant damage with Psychic. Drowzee loses one-on-one, but a single Psychic allows Machamp to be easily revenge killed.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Earthquake 2HKOes Nidoqueen, Graveler, Rapidash, and Arcanine, and they are incapable of 2HKOing in return. It deals significant enough damage to deter Drowzee and Staryu from switching in. Machamp can OHKO Gastly with Earthquake while surviving even a critical hit Psychic. Body Slam is a midground option that can paralyze Staryu or Seaking. Hyper Beam can finish off foes like Drowzee, Staryu, and Dragonair. Also, Fearow is usually KOed by Hyper Beam after taking a Submission or Rock Slide beforehand. Submission primarily hits Porygon for huge damage and is a decent midground option against Graveler and Omanyte to deny Fearow a free switch-in due to the fear of a subsequent Hyper Beam. However, Submission has a dreadful 80% accuracy, and recoil often puts Machamp in range of a Fearow Drill Peck. Lastly, Rock Slide mainly is used to 2HKO Fearow and OHKO Scyther 25% of the time. However, dropping any of Machamp's moves for Rock Slide is not advised due to how important each of its other moves are.</p> <p>Machamp is best used as a switch-in to Nidoqueen, Graveler, and Omanyte. All of them are terrified by Earthquake, and the Rock-types can be hit with Submission, which deters Fearow from switching in. Machamp can also come in on Porygon and threaten it for upwards of 78%. Once in, Machamp is best used as a mid-game progress maker by throwing out powerful attacks and leveraging Machmap's impressive bulk. Very little can safely switch into Machamp bar Fearow, which means that Omanyte and Graveler, which can switch into Fearow, are great partners to Machamp. In return, Machamp can switch into Nidoqueen's Earthquake for Omanyte and Graveler. However, it may be worthwhile to sacrifice a Pokemon to give Machamp free entry against Nidoqueen in order to minimize the chances of a critical hit or freeze. Bar switching Rock-types in on Fearow, it is discouraged to switch Machamp out of the field because once weakened, Machamp has a hard time coming back in without sacrificing another Pokemon. Machamp can also switch into Staryu's Thunder Wave or Surf directed at Graveler, since it does not mind paralysis as much as its teammates, as its slow Speed means it doesn't lose too many important matchups once paralyzed; paralysis also insulates Machamp from getting burned. However, a paralyzed Machamp is slower and more afraid of Graveler and Drowzee, as they can usually beat Machamp one-on-one. Paralysis also makes Submission even less likely to hit.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>With STAB Fighting-type haymakers at its disposal, Machamp can look enticing to the average player. Being as fast as Exeggutor ensures it edges out and 2HKOes Chansey with even Low Kick, which many Pokemon simply cannot achieve. Similarly, Machamp has the potential to give Tauros and Snorlax trouble, albeit to a lesser extent due to a deathly fear of paralysis. It's also got some fair physical bulk and a handy resistance to Rock Slide, allowing it to switch into and threaten Rhydon. This boils down to solidifying Machamp as a straightforward attacker that benefits strongly from paralysis support.</p> <p>Machamp's main problem is that while nearly every team includes the \"Big 3\" Normal-types — which Machamp can excel against in a flat one-on-one — a Psychic-type usually isn't far behind them. Machamp simply can't deal with Psychic-types, often failing to muster even a 2HKO on most and taking massive damage in return. Ergo, while Machamp hits like a freight train, it offers little defensive utility, which often opens gaping holes in its team. Additionally, Machamp despises paralysis, as what little Speed it has is what ensures it can threaten the Normal-types it wants to go after. When looking for a Pokemon to pummel paralyzed teams, Rhydon is often a better choice, possessing much greater defensive utility, immunity to Thunder Wave, and generally superior STAB moves. Machamp is thus a rare sight in RBY OU and generally isn't recommended.</p>",

          "description": "<p>STAB Low Kick may seem unassuming, but its 30.1% flinch rate in RBY makes Machamp excellent at bullying paralyzed Pokemon, making up for its mediocre defensive stats. Thanks to this, Machamp can potentially 2HKO a paralyzed Chansey — a very common sight in RBY OU — before it can muster a response. Alternatively, Submission can be used for more power, allowing Machamp to 2HKO Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, albeit at the cost of significant recoil. Body Slam lets Machamp be a little more self-sufficient, paralyzing potential switch-ins to turn the tables on them. Hyper Beam is Machamp's strongest Normal-type attack, allowing it to KO Pokemon that otherwise shrug off its STAB move. Alakazam is a noteworthy target, as it can end up being 2HKOed switching in if it's paralyzed by Body Slam first. Finally, Earthquake ensures Machamp isn't completely helpless against Gengar, 2HKOing it and Jolteon.</p> <p>Machamp has a wide offensive movepool, allowing it to fine-tune itself to fit a team. Using both Submission and Low Kick can let Machamp 2HKO Tauros, allowing it to more cleanly win a one-on-one interaction. Fire Blast deals up to 34.6% to Exeggutor with a high burn rate that can ruin its Explosion. Counter can be effective with Machamp's stat line, allowing it to switch in on a Hyper Beam and score a guaranteed OHKO on Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax. This also applies when switching into Snorlax's Body Slam and Chansey's Seismic Toss; both Pokemon will often switch out in response, allowing Machamp to severely damage the switch-in. Since Machamp struggles a bit against Reflect Chansey, Karate Chop can be a serviceable option, being what's effectively a 100-Base Power Normal-type move that ignores Reflect thanks to its near-guaranteed critical hit rate. Unfortunately, Machamp's Speed leaves Karate Chop short of the 99.6% cap, making it a tad inconsistent. Finally, Rock Slide can be used for better matchups against Articuno and Zapdos, but it falls short of 2HKOing the latter, which makes it questionable.</p>"

Thanks to its average Speed and access to Wrap and Sleep Powder, Victreebel is able to keep itself safe while bullying the tier's slowest staples, like Exeggutor, Chansey, and Snorlax. Likewise, anything paralyzed is liable to fall victim to Victreebel's repetitive Wraps. Victreebel also has a powerful Razor Leaf that can deal hefty damage to several key Pokemon, like Starmie, Slowbro, Lapras, and Rhydon, the last of which it will always OHKO. Victreebel has plenty of other toys to play with as well, such as Stun Spore and Swords Dance. These traits make Victreebel a menace against slower teams and teams that have mismanaged paralysis. It is undoubtedly one of the best Pokemon for closing games against weakened teams.</p> <p>Victreebel, however, has numerous flaws that have reduced it to more of a niche threat than a tier staple in recent times. In the modern metagame, teams are typically much faster than they were in the past and leads like Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx are more inclined to switch early on and dodge paralysis. While Chansey is very likely to become paralyzed over the course of the game, Victreebel may find it difficult to pressure anything else, and its mere presence is often an invitation for fast Psychic-type Pokemon. Additionally, the slight decrease in Exeggutor usage has been to Victreebel's detriment. Although the two compete as sleepers, Exeggutor's reduced role in the metagame has contributed to faster teams and reduced the presence of a prime Pokemon Victreebel can dominate with Sleep Powder or Wrap. Other more general issues include Victreebel's horrendous weaknesses to Ice and Psychic, vulnerability to paralysis, inability to threaten Gengar, and poor consistency, due to the imperfect accuracy of virtually every move it uses, most notably Wrap. Finally, while its defensive stats are somewhat workable, its mediocre Speed, poor typing, and lack of recovery make it deceptively frail; Tauros will typically KO Victreebel with a Blizzard followed by a Hyper Beam, for example.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam is Victreebel’s most notable alternative option for either set. The decent Base Power and paralysis chance allow Victreebel to punish switch-ins without committing to moves like Stun Spore and Sleep Powder, which can potentially be blocked by a statused Pokemon or just miss. However, the middling payoff and rather high value of Victreebel’s moveslots make it a rare sight. Double-Edge can potentially be run on the Swords Dance set for additional power without risking a Hyper Beam recharge turn, but it is generally outclassed by the utility moves that give Victreebel its niche. Toxic is another possible option on the standard set because it pairs well with Wrap, causing damage to accumulate much more quickly. Once again, however, Victreebel seldom has room to run a move like this.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Victreebel is incapacitated by paralysis. With all of its healthy foes faster than it, Victreebel will no longer be able to use Wrap to pressure slower targets and pivot. Additionally, Wrap will hit only a mere 66% of the time once Victreebel is paralyzed, making it an inconsistent option even against paralyzed targets. Likewise, the imperfect accuracies of Razor Leaf, Hyper Beam, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore are exacerbated by the chance for full paralysis. Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will typically try to use Thunder Wave to dispatch Victreebel as fast as possible, and slower Pokemon like Chansey and Exeggutor will be happy to punish any Wrap misses with Thunder Wave and Stun Spore, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is a hard counter to Victreebel. Aside from status moves, Victreebel is incapable of threatening Gengar at all, as it takes no damage from Wrap or Hyper Beam and very little from Razor Leaf. Gengar, on the other hand, can put Victreebel to sleep or quickly KO it with Night Shade or the occasional Psychic. Wrap still immobilizes Gengar despite not doing any damage, allowing Victreebel to pivot to a teammate, so Gengar can’t switch in entirely for free.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon tend to be strong answers to Victreebel. Zapdos is by far the most common and can easily dispatch Victreebel with Thunder Wave or 2HKO it with Drill Peck. Unless Victreebel is partnered with Rhydon or Golem, Zapdos is very likely to claim a KO if it gets the chance to face Victreebel. Articuno and Moltres also outspeed and can 2HKO Victreebel with Blizzard and Fire Blast, respectively. All three Pokemon also have impressive bulk, so they can survive even a +2 Hyper Beam if necessary. Dragonite is also a rather sturdy check, as it shrugs off most of Victreebel’s moves and can inhibit it with Thunder Wave or its own Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Psychic and Ice-type Moves</strong>: Psychic and Ice-type moves deal hefty damage to Victreebel, typically scoring a 2HKO. Alakazam, Starmie, and Jynx all outspeed Victreebel and can 2HKO it with Psychic or Blizzard. Slower Pokemon can also harshly punish misses and poor switches from Victreebel. Exeggutor and Lapras both score 2HKOs with their super effective STAB moves, though the latter takes a lot from Razor Leaf. Chansey can also get a 3HKO with Ice Beam. Cloyster is an incredibly awkward matchup, as the two Speed tie and 2HKO each other with their STAB moves, with Victreebel potentially getting the KO outright if Cloyster has sustained even the slightest chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Victreebel has difficulty threatening Pokemon faster than it, as it typically cannot stay in and use Wrap safely. Essentially every common Pokemon faster than Victreebel has the potential to simply wait out Victreebel’s Wrap turns, provided it doesn't switch out, and eventually punish it with a super effective attack or paralysis. Victreebel can typically weaken these Pokemon before going down, such as hitting Starmie with Razor Leaf or Tauros with Stun Spore, but these matchup are generally losing for Victreebel overall.</p>",

        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to its middling Speed, Victreebel can threaten about half of the tier with Sleep Powder. In general, Victreebel is most effective as a sleeper when it can get in against a slower foe with minimal risk. For example, when Chansey is likely to use Soft-Boiled or Snorlax is about to wake up from Rest, Victreebel can usually sneak in and use Sleep Powder. Likewise, if a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Slowbro is likely to come in, Victreebel can usually find an entry point. From there, Victreebel can pivot with Wrap or pressure slower Pokemon like Snorlax with Razor Leaf and Wrap. While going for sleep early on is a viable strategy, Victreebel frequently shines late-game, as revealing it too early may make paralyzing some of your opponent's faster Pokemon more difficult. Therefore, Sleep Powder is often an endgame tool that it can use to threaten Tauros and other common endgame Pokemon. Wrap makes Victreebel a capable pivot and occasional sweeper; it can use the move to quickly get its teammates great matchups with little risk. For example, using Wrap against Chansey can provide entrance for Snorlax and using it against Exeggutor can provide entrance for Cloyster. Faster Pokemon are also vulnerable; if a foe like Alakazam, Starmie, or Zapdos tries to switch into Wrap and threaten paralysis, then a teammate like Snorlax, Jolteon, or Rhydon can come in for free. Finally, if the opposing team is made entirely slower than Victreebel, either by KOing or paralyzing every faster Pokemon, Victreebel can gradually chip away the team's health with Wrap until it can pick foes off with its attacks or swap out to a sweeper like Tauros to finish the job. Razor Leaf is Victreebel's strongest STAB move and primary attacking move. Water- and Rock-type Pokemon typically fold after just a hit or two, allowing Victreebel to reliably force switches when facing Pokemon like paralyzed Starmie, paralyzed or Resting Cloyster, Slowbro, and Rhydon. In the case of Slowbro, Razor Leaf's near-guaranteed critical hit enables Victreebel to deal hefty damage regardless of how many times it has used Amnesia. Victreebel's ability to pressure both Starmie and Rhydon is fairly unique and one of the key traits that allowed it to rise to OU. Victreebel's last move is its least important and most flexible. Stun Spore improves Victreebel's utility with Wrap and gives it the ability to pressure faster Pokemon even after Sleep Clause has taken effect. This is especially potent when the opponent's only Pokemon faster than Victreebel is Tauros. Hyper Beam makes Victreebel a more effective sweeper in late-game scenarios, picking up early KOs on Pokemon like Chansey and Alakazam.</p> <p>Depending on how Victreebel is played, it has a number of strong potential teammates. Starmie and Rhydon are typical partners, as they create a potent offensive core. Starmie can stymie Pokemon that threaten Victreebel like Alakazam, Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, while Victreebel can take advantage of Starmie’s ability to spread paralysis by using Wrap and applying pressure to Starmie’s strongest check, Chansey. Rhydon rounds out the core by handling Electric-type Pokemon, particularly Zapdos, which heavily threaten both Starmie and Victreebel. Rhydon also benefits from paralysis spread by these allies. Electric-type Pokemon also tend to work well with Victreebel on offensive teams, as Wrap can be a valuable tool for allowing them to switch in safely; Zapdos and Jolteon are quite good at finishing off a team that has been chipped by Wrap. Victreebel can also punish the switches to Rhydon or Golem that Electric-type Pokemon tend to encourage. Victreebel is also a fixture of Wrap teams. While a less common strategy in competitive play, Victreebel can be paired with Pokemon such as Cloyster and Dragonite to easily maintain momentum and annihilate paralyzed teams. Due to the many free switches generated by Wrap, such teams often feature multiple fast offensive Pokemon such as Tauros, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Alakazam.</p>"

        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>While Victreebel often gets the most value from a utility set based around pivoting and spreading status, it can make use of a Swords Dance set. Victreebel boasts an above-average Attack stat and can secure many important KOs after a Swords Dance. Frailer Pokemon such as Alakazam and Jynx drop to a single +2 Hyper Beam and Chansey will drop from full health about 17.9% of the time. Thanks to its decent Speed tier, Victreebel can severely weaken or outright sweep a team with Swords Dance after only a little chip damage and paralysis. Razor Leaf complements Hyper Beam quite well, as it threatens many of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier, such as Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro. The final move on the set largely comes down to team structure and personal preference. Wrap remains useful as a pseudo-pivot move and can help Victreebel get a little more chip damage on a Pokemon to bring it into range of Hyper Beam or Razor Leaf. Sleep Powder helps Victreebel find turns to set up with Swords Dance and punish Pokemon that might be brought in to stop a sweep, like Tauros or Electric-type Pokemon. Stun Spore acts similarly, heavily punishing common late-game switch-ins. While paralysis is generally weaker than sleep, Stun Spore has a case over Sleep Powder, as it is not inhibited by Sleep Clause and can be used at any point in the match. Moreover, because Victreebel is often best at switching in and setting up on Pokemon that are already asleep, Sleep Powder may be redundant.</p> <p>While Victreebel can succeed with this set, it has several notable limitations. Victreebel’s poor typing, underwhelming bulk, and vulnerability to paralysis make setting up quite difficult, forcing Victreebel to rely on free turns from sleep and risky double switches. Victreebel needs a lot of support to not only set up with Swords Dance, but also to weaken the opposing team enough that Victreebel can do real damage. This generally means all Psychic-type Pokemon on the opposing team need to be paralyzed and hard walls like Gengar need to be eliminated. Finally, while Victreebel is arguably the best user of Swords Dance in the tier, it is not necessarily the best fit for every team. Pokemon like Sandslash, Kingler, Venusaur, Pinsir, and Kabutops all offer a variety of positive traits and give Victreebel pretty stiff competition for an already niche role.</p>"

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Tentacruel is generally considered good in the current metagame</p> <hr /> <p>Tentacruel is unquestionably the defining threat of RBY UU, shaping every facet of the tier and dictating the viability of many Pokemon. Access to Wrap combined with its incredible base 100 Speed gives it nigh-unmatched utility in nearly every game. Tentacruel's Wrap shapes the identity of RBY UU, defining offensive and defensive play in the tier. Wrap wears down foes and gains momentum by pivoting while they're immobilized, and Tentacruel's many strengths accentuate these positives. Its high Speed and Wrap give it the advantage in most one-on-one interactions: against any slower foe, Tentacruel can just use Wrap and switch as the move expires, giving its team free chip damage and a free switch. This strategy has no good short-term counterplay: switching a faster Pokemon or Haunter into Wrap won't let it punish Tentacruel, making it very hard to punish and gain momentum against Tentacruel. Tentacruel also easily switches in on the tier's many Surfs and Blizzards from threats like Vaporeon, Dewgong, and Articuno. With all these switch-in chances, Tentacruel gets on the field often, and since most Pokemon are slower and thus completely shut down by Wrap, Tentacruel is hard to force out too. This longevity and pressure is made even more potent if Tentacruel chooses to run Rest to stick around even longer and avoid getting worn down. All this field presence, chip damage, momentum, and safe pivoting for offensive teammates lets Tentacruel immensely pressure defensive Pokemon. Finally, not only does Wrap prevent defensive Pokemon from healing during its duration, but Tentacruel can run Swords Dance to emphasize this pressure even more.</p> <p>Tentacruel's many positive attributes support its Wrap, but they also have their own critical applications. With its base 120 Special, which is tied for the second-highest in the tier, STAB Surf or Hydro Pump, and good coverage with Blizzard, Tentacruel is an offensive behemoth. Its STAB moves deal significant damage to Kangaskhan, Omastar, Haunter, and Kadabra, while Blizzard hits Dodrio, Dragonite, Venusaur, Victreebel, and Tangela hard, if it doesn't just OHKO them outright. This wide coverage with Tentacruel's high Speed allows it to act as a revenge killer, a sweeper, and a wallbreaker. If it chooses to run Swords Dance, Tentacruel becomes a nigh-unwallable late-game sweeper, demolishing slower teams with Wrap, Hyper Beam, and Surf with near impunity. Meanwhile, with Rest and the fantastic Water typing, Tentacruel becomes a key defensive piece. It checks Articuno, one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier, and answers the myriad of Surfs and Blizzards from the tier's many Water-types, such as Vaporeon, Gyarados, Omastar, Dewgong, and itself, giving it a defensive niche as well as an entry opportunity. Further, all the above niches and Wrap synergize with each other. Wrap chip damage bolsters Tentacruel's offensive pressure, and whenever Tentacruel comes in to exploit a positive offensive or defensive matchup, it gains another chance to use Wrap.</p> <p>Despite all these positives, Tentacruel does have some very notable flaws. Its Poison typing, while making it immune to Toxic, gives it a glaring weakness to Psychic and Earthquake. These weaknesses make it hard to switch Tentacruel into Pokemon like Hypno and Kangaskhan, and they prevent it from staying in against Kadabra and Dugtrio, both of which outspeed Tentacruel and heavily damage it with their STAB moves. Another notable weakness of Tentacruel is its physical frailty, which can allow threats such as Persian and Aerodactyl to force Tentacruel out as well. Tentacruel is also severely crippled by paralysis, as the Speed drop and chance for full paralysis mid-Wrap heavily impact its utility. Lastly, Tentacruel's reliance on Rest to heal itself can be heavily punished by Psychic-types such as Kadabra and Hypno, Electric-types such as Raichu and Electabuzz, and physical attackers such as Kangaskhan, Dodrio, Persian, and Dugtrio. However, even with these flaws, Tentacruel is the tier's apex predator, with its utility and power making it a mandatory pick for competitive teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Tentacruel has a variety of other options, they are generally discouraged due to them either being very situational or making Tentacruel less consistent, which many team compositions cannot afford. Hydro Pump's increased power can be very appealing, as it achieves a guaranteed 3HKO on Hypno, a near-guaranteed 3HKO on Articuno, a guaranteed 2HKO on Persian, and a 2HKO against Kadabra 49.8% of the time; however, the worse accuracy and PP are very noticeable in prolonged games and make Tentacruel a much less consistent threat.</p> <p>Hyper Beam can be a nice option on the Wrap Pivot set, allowing Tentacruel to pick off opposing Kadabra switching into it at 60% health, as well as hitting opposing Tentacruel for around 33% and opposing Dewgong and Vaporeon for roughly 27%. All of the latter three can be tough for Tentacruel to break past on its own. However, outside of those damage rolls, Hyper Beam doesn’t do that much for Tentacruel, making it hard to justify running over one of its standard moves.</p> <p>Ice Beam grants Tentacruel more PP for freeze wars, increasing its chances of winning them. However, its drop in damage output from Blizzard is drastic, notably failing to OHKO Dragonite. Barrier can make Tentacruel take less damage from the wide array of physical moves, dodging the 2HKO from Kangaskhan's and Dugtrio's Earthquakes and allowing it to win those matchups; however, Barrier fails to assist it against Persian, which can ignore it with Slash and is one of the most popular physical attackers in the tier. Bubble Beam's 33.2% chance to drop Speed can come in handy against opposing Tentacruel and Persian, but in the vast majority of cases, Surf's higher damage is preferred. Mega Drain can be nice to hit Omastar or Golem with, as it allows Tentacruel to gain a significant amount of health back, but it otherwise has middling damage and hurts other matchups more than it helps.</p> <p>On the Swords Dance set, Tentacruel can opt to run Blizzard over Surf to guarantee an OHKO on Dragonite and deal more damage to Grass-types, but this comes at the cost of a guaranteed OHKO on Dugtrio and a probable 2HKO on Persian and Kangaskhan, damage rolls that are often too valuable for Swords Dance Tentacruel to pass up on.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fast Paralysis Inducers</strong>: Any paralysis inducer that outspeeds Tentacruel, such as Kadabra, Raichu, Electabuzz, or the rare Electrode, can be a very pressing issue for it. The chance of full paralysis leaves Tentacruel with a 63.57% chance to connect Wrap, sharply harming its pivoting and sweeping. The Speed drop further hinders its pivoting and leaves it vulnerable to slower threats like Hypno and Gyarados. Kadabra and Electabuzz, which avoid a 2HKO from Surf, can switch into Tentacruel directly and threaten it with Thunder Wave. They can create significant momentum if they switch into Tentacruel as Wrap misses. Even if Wrap hits, they can wait out the Wrap turns and threaten 2HKOs with their STAB moves. That being said, all these checks fear a critical hit Surf, which will deal at least 70%, letting another attack or a teammate KO them. Kadabra mitigates that risk with Recover, but using Recover lets its checks such as Hypno switch in. You can reduce the threat of Surf by switching a Water-resistant Pokemon into Tentacruel first, baiting it to lock into Wrap. This creates a switch-in opportunity for paralysis inducers, which can wait out the Wrap turns and threaten to cripple or break through Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter has enough bulk to avoid a 2HKO from Tentacruel's attacks and won't take chip damage from Wrap, although it is still immobilized. Due to its strong Thunderbolt, Haunter can force Tentacruel out and make it waste Wrap PP, usually winning the matchup when Tentacruel is below 73%, as Thunderbolt will 2HKO Tentacruel from there. However, if Haunter has already been damaged, it may be forced to use Explosion instead. It should be noted that a Thunderbolt and subsequent Explosion from Haunter usually, but not always, will KO Tentacruel from full health. Critical hits from Surf can deal severe damage to Haunter, in addition, likely forcing it to use Explosion regardless of Tentacruel's health.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Fast physical attackers such as Dugtrio, Persian, and Dodrio are all reliable checks to Tentacruel, beating or matching its Speed and exploiting its mediocre physical bulk to KO it from very high health. Dugtrio can 2HKO Tentacruel with Earthquake, but its fragility makes Surf a guaranteed OHKO, so Dugtrio is limited to a revenge killing role. Tentacruel is pressured to stay at 80% HP or more, out of Earthquake's OHKO range, but this is a tall order in many situations. Dugtrio's Speed and strong Earthquake also let it halt the Wrap momentum of a chipped Tentacruel, coming in on Wrap and waiting it out before KOing the Tentacruel with Earthquake; however, this is usually a last resort option, as many common threats can heavily punish Dugtrio's frailty if they are reasonably healthy. Persian can threaten a reliable 2HKO with Slash against a Tentacruel at 90% or below. Unlike Dugtrio, however, Persian has enough bulk to survive a Surf—and fairly often two—making it more flexible than Dugtrio in threatening and/or chipping Tentacruel without getting KOed. While both Dodrio and Aerodactyl are reliably 2HKOed by Tentacruel's Surf and Blizzard, they both match or exceed Tentacruel’s Speed and can significantly damage it with Hyper Beam, allowing them to consistently threaten a KO against a a sufficiently weakened Tentacruel below 62% while at high health. Dodrio significantly improve the matchup if it manages to paralyze Tentacruel with a Body Slam or use Agility before Tentacruel comes onto the field, as a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam is guaranteed to KO Tentacruel.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Without Swords Dance, Tentacruel often struggles to break through opposing Water-types, such as Vaporeon, Gyarados, Dewgong, or opposing Tentacruel, on its own. It has to rely on landing multiple Wraps in a row to feasibly break through them or get a lucky freeze from Blizzard, which won't even work for Dewgong, all while risking getting paralyzed by Body Slam, frozen by Blizzard, or eating a strong Thunderbolt or Hyper Beam from Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Tangela, Victreebel, and Dragonite</strong>: While neither switch into Tentacruel's Surf very well, when at high health, Tangela, Victreebel, and Dragonite, can be difficult for Tentacruel to break past with their good special bulk. Tentacruel has to land multiple Wraps in a row to break past these three, while they are able to cripple it immediately with Stun Spore or Thunder Wave if it misses. While Tentacruel outspeeds them and 2HKOes and OHKOes them with Blizzard, respectively, both of these Pokemon are very good at luring in Tentacruel and paralyzing it as it switches in, which can cripple Tentacruel for the rest of the game. In addition, because these two Pokemon are slower than Tentacruel, they can act after it wakes up from Rest, paralyzing it before it can retaliate and then pivoting to a more aggressive teammate with Bind or Wrap.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Wrap Pivot": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is Tentacruel's defining set, capable of extracting nigh-unmatched amounts of value at every stage of the game. With its strong Blizzard and STAB Surf, Tentacruel is a consistent offensive threat, capable of 2HKOing Kangaskhan, Tangela, Venusaur, Dodrio, and Persian while OHKOing Aerodactyl, Dugtrio, and Dragonite. Even specially bulky targets like Hypno and Articuno lose roughly 30% of their health to Surf, possibly forcing an early Rest from Hypno—which a teammate like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, Dodrio, Persian, or Dragonite can exploit—or chipping Articuno enough to stop it from sweeping. Tentacruel's fast Wrap accentuates this damage, allowing it to immobilize and chip away at slower targets, preventing them from retaliating or healing any damage they may have incurred. Additionally, Wrap allows even more offensively-threatening teammates, such as Dugtrio, Articuno, Persian, and Kangaskhan, a safe entry point to exploit the damage dealt by Tentacruel. Tentacruel's last move is Rest for two main reasons; firstly, Rest gives it general longevity in the face of damage and status, allowing it to remain an active presence throughout the game. Secondly, by running Rest, Tentacruel can better leverage its respectable special bulk and resistances to Water and Ice, switching into the likes of Articuno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and opposing Tentacruel throughout a game. The improved matchup against opposing Tentacruel is especially important in end-games, as a Tentacruel without Rest is typically at a significant disadvantage in the mirror matchup, as is the improved matchup against Articuno, since it can be very difficult to check Articuno if you do not have Rest on Tentacruel or a secondary Water-type that can handle Articuno, such as Dewgong, Omastar, or Vaporeon.</p> <p>Tentacruel is a very versatile and flexible Pokemon; it can be an offensive weapon and revenge killer with its Speed and consistent damage output, a defensive piece with its respectable special bulk, resistances, and Rest, and it can be a pivot with Wrap to bring in its teammates. Getting Tentacruel onto the field safely as often as possible is vital to making the most of it, as is properly identifying whether using Wrap to chip foes and pivot is worth risking a miss, or if Tentacruel should fire off strong Surfs and Blizzards to break down the opposing team's defensive core instead. However, you have to balance this pivoting and offense with keeping Tentacruel healthy as an answer to Articuno and Water-types such as Vaporeon, Dewgong, and opposing Tentacruel as well. Flying- and Grass-types switching in to answer Dugtrio are two great opportunities to bring Tentacruel into play, as Tentacruel threatens to OHKO or 2HKO many of them with Blizzard. Another good entry opportunity is while opposing slow wallbreakers, such as Kangaskhan and Articuno, switch into a Hypno or Vaporeon asleep from Rest, as Tentacruel can regain momentum with Wrap before they can retaliate. Tentacruel can also make good use of sleeping foes, such as Hypno and Omastar, attempting to burn sleep turns, as it can deal significant damage with Surf while they are asleep before starting Wrap as they wake up, preventing them from retaliating or healing off damage sustained during Rest.</p> <p>Given how versatile a threat Tentacruel is, it synergizes very well with many common threats in the tier. Sweepers and wallbreakers like Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and Persian enjoy Tentacruel's Wrap allowing them to switch in safely, preserving their health and avoiding getting paralyzed by Thunder Wave, which in turn lets them come in later for another round of attacks. In return, they threaten to 2HKO common Tentacruel answers like Kadabra and Electabuzz. Dugtrio is particularly noteworthy, as it is immune to Thunder Wave intended to cripple Tentacruel, punishing the opposition heavily for trying with its STAB Earthquake, good coverage in Rock Slide and Slash, threat of Substitute catching a switch from the opponent, and high critical hit rate. One especially good place to pivot Dugtrio in with Wrap is against opposing Tentacruel, as it can KO Tentacruel extremely early with Earthquake. In return, Tentacruel outspeeds and threatens common Dugtrio answers like Tangela, Venusaur, Dragonite, and Kangaskhan, with Wrap immobilizing them and wearing them down into Surf or Blizzard range. Hypno is another fantastic teammate for Tentacruel, coming into common Tentacruel answers like Kadabra and Electabuzz and forcing them to switch out, lest they get paralyzed by Thunder Wave or put to sleep by Hypnosis. Either status makes them easy pickings for slower physical attackers like Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and Dragonite, as well as prevents them from checking Tentacruel thereafter. Hypno, when healthy, also can soft check other common Tentacruel answers like Persian and Aerodactyl with its strong Psychic and Thunder Wave. In exchange, Hypno benefits immensely from Tentacruel's ability to answer Pokemon that heavily punish a resting Hypno, such as Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Venusaur, Tangela, and Dragonite. Furthermore, Tentacruel's fast Wrap benefits Hypno immensely by baiting in Pokemon that Hypno checks, such as Electabuzz and Kadabra, before, crucially, letting Hypno switch into them without taking chip damage or paralysis on the way in.</p> <p>Bulky Pokemon such as Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Vaporeon, Dragonite, and Dewgong also make for effective Tentacruel teammates. While healthy, they can switch into some of Tentacruel's common checks such as Persian and Dugtrio, ideally while they are immobilized by Tentacruel's Wrap, and threaten the opposing team with strong attacks and the threat of paralysis from either Body Slam or Thunder Wave in the case of Dragonite. They are also very adept at exploiting sleeping Rest users, such as Hypno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong, that switch into Wrap to burn sleep turns while taking relatively little damage from Tentacruel's Wrap. Dewgong also grants the Tentacruel user an additional Articuno counter, as do Omastar and Vaporeon, which allows Tentacruel to play more aggressively without as much risk of Articuno getting out of hand. Dewgong further has a freeze immunity, which allows Tentacruel to avoid taking as many Blizzards from an opposing Tentacruel and reduces the chances that it gets frozen. Tangela, Victreebel, and Venusaur also make for very effective Tentacruel partners, as, while healthy, they answer Dugtrio, Persian, and Electabuzz, using the entry point to land a crippling Sleep Powder before providing additional value with their other utility moves. Meanwhile, Tentacruel acts as a decent answer to any Flying-types, such as Articuno, Dragonite, and Gyarados, that try to exploit Tangela, Victreebel, and Venusaur's lack of coverage moves.</p> <p>Lastly, Flying-type teammates such as the aforementioned Gyarados and Dragonite, but also Aerodactyl, Articuno, and Dodrio, can benefit Tentacruel by checking Dugtrio with their immunity to Earthquake and strong attacks. Gyarados and Dragonite can switch into Dugtrio's Rock Slide two times, barring an untimely critical hit, before Dugtrio can threaten to 2HKO them as they switch in. Aerodactyl and Dodrio are less sturdy answers to Dugtrio, only taking a single Rock Slide before Dugtrio can 2HKO them; however, they can threaten Kadabra fairly well when it is chipped. Aerodactyl's high Speed stat is particularly noteworthy because, excluding the uncommon Electrode, it is the only Pokemon that can reliably revenge kill an unparalyzed Dugtrio without taking an attack in the process. Its Normal resistance is also useful when facing Dugtrio, as Dugtrio commonly uses Slash as an early-game midground option when scouting its opponent's team, and Aerodactyl takes Slash very comfortably. Articuno is unable to switch into Dugtrio's Rock Slide safely at all, being 2HKOed from full health by it, but, when above 58% health, it can force Dugtrio to switch out with its Blizzard if it can come in safely—such as on an Earthquake or from Tentacruel's Wrap—and if Dugtrio is not behind a Substitute.</p> <p>Tentacruel’s good Speed tier and access to Wrap make it a common lead in RBY UU, outspeeding and locking down any slower lead, including Hypno, Haunter, and Venusaur. Wrap allows a safe pivot to a teammate to capitalize on the immobilized lead, or any teammates that the opposing player switches to, whenever the Tentacruel user dictates. For example, if your opponent switches to Clefable or Hypno and attempts to PP stall Wrap or fish for a miss to paralyze Tentacruel, you can pivot to a teammate such as Venusaur or Haunter and put a foe to sleep. As another example, if your opponent leads Haunter and stays in to fish for a Wrap miss and put Tentacruel to sleep with Hypnosis, you can go to Dugtrio and threaten to OHKO Haunter with Earthquake. This ability to pivot with Wrap puts the Tentacruel user at a significant advantage, as they have the initiative and control the pace of the game, which allows them to pick the best moment to switch while chipping down the opposing team. This advantage creates an intricate mind game. Opponents commonly respond to this advantage by switching to a Pokemon with paralysis that outspeeds or Speed ties Tentacruel such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, or Electrode. These paralysis users pressure Tentacruel to quickly switch to a teammate, usually Hypno but possibly Dugtrio, before Wrap ends and the foe regains the initiative by freely threatening Tentacruel. If it hasn't started Wrap yet, Tentacruel may even hard switch instead of Wrap pivoting to avoid the risk of a Wrap miss. If Tentacruel hard switches, though, the opponent may predict this and, instead of bringing in a paralysis user, bring in their own Tentacruel to handle the incoming Hypno or Dugtrio. With the other Tentacruel possibly in play, the above mind game starts again. The original Tentacruel user may predict the opponent bringing in their opposing Tentacruel, causing the original user to bring in their own paralysis inducer, but the opponent may respond with their own Hypno or Dugtrio to beat the paralysis user, and so on.</p> <p>When facing fast paralysis-inducing leads, such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode, Tentacruel will be forced to switch to a teammate to avoid getting paralyzed, thereby giving the opposing player a chance to paralyze some Pokemon with Thunder Wave or predict the switch and bring in a sleep inducer such as Haunter or Venusaur. Note that the same pressure to switch and cede initiative occurs if Tentacruel misses a Wrap against the fast paralysis inducer as it switches in, or if Wrap connects but the Tentacruel doesn't switch out before it ends. Against opposing Tentacruel leads, Tentacruel can go for a freeze with Blizzard while dealing some minor chip damage, use Surf to maximize chip damage to more quickly bring the opposing Tentacruel into KO range for Dugtrio or Persian, or use Wrap and pivot into a fast paralysis-inducing teammate. While Tentacruel is likely to win the matchup against lead Dodrio by using Blizzard, it only wins while avoiding paralysis about half the time, and it is almost always significantly weakened from the interaction, which can be very costly given how valuable Tentacruel is. It is better to switch to another teammate that checks Dodrio, such as Omastar or Aerodactyl. The matchup against Persian is similar; Tentacruel is statistically more likely to win the one-on-one but will be significantly weakened in the process, which is undesirable in many circumstances. When leading with Tentacruel, it can be beneficial to have a second Water-type in the back, ensuring you can take opposing Water- and Ice-type attacks in case Tentacruel gets chipped or compromised by status early on.</p>"

        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance Tentacruel is a surprising and effective late-game sweeper that can effectively break past bulkier Pokemon that expect to comfortably check it. These include Vaporeon, Hypno, and opposing Tentacruel, with Swords Dance Tentacruel punishing them using Rest especially hard. This Tentacruel set also can be a mid-game pivot, but since it cannot afford to run Rest, a Wrap miss is often devastating, making mid-game pivoting risky. After one Swords Dance, Tentacruel's Wrap deals around 6% per turn to bulky targets such as Hypno, Gyarados, Kangaskhan, and Vaporeon, transforming from a pivoting move that deals chip damage to a potent wallbreaking tool that completely decimates paralyzed teams. Boosted Wrap quickly wears foes down into KO range of either Surf or Tentacruel's boosted Hyper Beam, which are reliable KO options against slower and bulkier Pokemon once they are slightly below half health, while leaving them unable to retaliate. This process normally forces the opponent to rely on Pokemon that outspeed Tentacruel to force it out, such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Persian. However, none of these Pokemon can reliably switch into Tentacruel, as Tentacruel's boosted Hyper Beam can KO all of them after only a small amount of chip damage, or, in the case of Kadabra, no chip damage at all. When using Swords Dance to attempt a sweep, ensure that Tentacruel sets up against targets that are unable to status it or significantly harm it, such as sleeping targets looking to burn some sleep turns against Wrap, slower Pokemon looking to use a recovery move, or opposing Tentacruel looking to get a lucky freeze with Blizzard;&amp;mdashthis mirror interaction is especially noteworthy in end-game positions, where Swords Dance Tentacruel dominates if it is reasonably healthy. It is important to recognize that these setup opportunities stem from opponents expecting Tentacruel to run its standard, less offensive set; take advantage whenever opponents make that wrong prediction and think they can tolerate being passive towards Tentacruel. Due to this set's increased vulnerability to status, it can be more difficult to bring in than the standard Wrap pivot set, often relying on resisted attacks, teammate Wrappers like Dragonite, and good double switching to come onto the field safely. Another notable, albeit uncommon, way of utilizing Swords Dance Tentacruel is as a mid-game wallbreaker, boosting its Attack against an opposing Tentacruel or Vaporeon that's burning Rest sleep turns to punch a large hole in the opposing team.</p> <p>Swords Dance Tentacruel can be a challenging sweeper to use, often relying on its teammates to force the opponent into positions where it can safely use Swords Dance, as well as needing them to paralyze or KO any Pokemon that could stop its sweep. As mentioned before, sleeping Pokemon looking to burn a turn or two of sleep make excellent setup fodder; hence, Swords Dance Tentacruel pairs well with sleep inducers such as Haunter, Hypno, Venusaur, Victreebel, and Tangela. These five Pokemon also have defensive utility against foes that may stop Tentacruel's sweep as well, with Haunter walling opposing Persian, Venusaur, Victreebel, Tangela checking opposing Dugtrio, Raichu, Electabuzz, and Persian, Hypno crippling Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Persian with Thunder Wave—allowing Tentacruel to sweep with Swords Dance-boosted Wrap unopposed. Seismic Toss Hypno is also an effective teammate for Swords Dance Tentacruel, as it can reliably force an opposing Hypno to use Rest, most commonly at around half health, which gifts Tentacruel an excellent opportunity to switch in and use Swords Dance. Dugtrio and Persian are two excellent teammates for Swords Dance Tentacruel, as they can exploit opposing Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu attempting to stop Tentacruel's sweep, as well as clean up any remaining foes after Swords Dance Tentacruel's assault. Kangaskhan and Dragonite are two more solid partners for Swords Dance Tentacruel that can paralyze or KO Persian and Kadabra attempting to check Tentacruel. Another issue teams with this set often face is dealing with Articuno and opposing Tentacruel, as Swords Dance Tentacruel cannot reliably switch into them throughout the match due to its lack of Rest. Teammates such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong can switch into Articuno and Tentacruel throughout the game.</p>"

      "outdated": true,
      "overview": "<p>Graveler cements a role in the tier thanks to its high physical bulk and Rock typing, which make it a near-perfect counter to the ubiquitous Fearow as well as the less common but still deadly Scyther. A healthy Graveler can effortlessly switch into all of their attacks, taking a maximum of 17.8% from Scyther's Slash, 17.2% from Fearow's Double-Edge, and 25.8% from Fearow's normally devastating Hyper Beam. Graveler’s role in the tier isn’t strictly defensive, though. STAB Earthquake and Rock Slide give Graveler perfect coverage, and thanks to its high Attack, it is able to 2HKO many foes.</p> <p>Graveler is held back by its poor Speed and special bulk. It only outspeeds the rare Slowpoke and Speed ties Omanyte. These traits make it very difficult for Graveler to handle special attackers. It is notably outsped and walled by Porygon, which can switch into Graveler and threaten it with Blizzard. Graveler is OHKOed by Surf from Seaking, Staryu, and Dragonair, and it has a 40.7% chance to be 2HKOed by Drowzee's Psychic. This special frailty is exacerbated by Graveler’s fear of burn. Despite Graveler's resistance to Fire, it cannot switch into Rapidash or Arcanine's Fire Blast effectively. This weakness gives it competition with Omanyte, as the latter is able to switch into the Fire-types much more reliably. However, Graveler is much harder to switch into, since Seaking, Staryu, and Gastly are all very common Pokemon that take little damage from Omanyte's STAB moves. Additionally, Graveler's greater physical bulk makes it much more reliable against Fearow, as Omanyte can be ruined by a critical hit. Graveler also has Counter which can force Fearow into an uncomfortable prediction game, as well as Explosion, which can dent a bulky opponent, such as Porygon or Machamp. Overall, Graveler makes an excellent check to the ubiquitous Fearow, but its flaws make it difficult to fit on most teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Due to the perfect coverage of Earthquake and Rock Slide and the sheer power of Explosion, Counter or Substitute should be dropped when considered other options on Graveler. Body Slam can be used to fish for paralysis on a predicted Seaking or Staryu switch, but the extra damage from Earthquake generally makes it the better option. Rest can be used for longevity against Fearow, but a sleeping Graveler is extremely easy to switch into, meaning Rest should be reserved for specific endgames, and is generally not recommended.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Water-type Attacks:</strong> Seaking and Staryu both outspeed Graveler and are able to easily OHKO it with Surf. Earthquake 3HKOes Seaking and 2HKOes Staryu, but Staryu can use Recover later to heal off the damage. Although Slowpoke is slower than Graveler, it is also able to OHKO it with Surf. Additionally, Nidoqueen and Dragonair can run Surf to land a surprise OHKO on Graveler.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users:</strong> Earthquake users, such as Machamp and Sandslash, 2HKO Graveler with Earthquake while taking little damage in return. Even with an Earthquake weakness of its own, Nidoqueen beats Graveler one-on-one since it's faster.</p> <p><strong>Porygon:</strong> Graveler is one of the few Pokemon Porygon outspeeds, and Graveler is unable to threaten an unparalyzed Porygon at all without using Explosion. Porygon can use Recover to heal off the damage from Graveler's attacks, and it 2HKOes Graveler with Blizzard. Graveler's terrible critical hit rate makes breaking through Porygon with critical hits extremely unlikely.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers:</strong> Although they cannot switch in, special attackers such as Dragonair and Drowzee outspeed and deal heavy damage to Graveler, often forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Burn:</strong> Graveler hates being burned, so it has to watch out from Fire Blast from Pokemon it would normally beat, such as Rapidash and Arcanine. They can also freely set up Agility on a burned Graveler, since using Agility will reapply the Attack drop from burn, making Graveler do feeble damage. Graveler struggles to switch into Fire-types as a result, but it is good at revenge killing them, especially once they're paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types:</strong> Vileplume and the rare Weepinbell can switch into Graveler and easily KO it. Graveler has an 80.9% chance to 2HKO Weepinbell with Earthquake but Weepinbell OHKOes Graveler with Razor Leaf. Vileplume 2HKOes Graveler with Mega Drain but is bulkier, being 3HKOed by Earthquake. However, Graveler walls Vileplume sets lacking Mega Drain.</p>",
      "sets": {

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Earthquake is Graveler’s strongest move. It easily 2HKOes every Pokemon weak to Ground, including the bulky Arcanine and Nidoqueen, as well as physically frail Pokemon, such as Staryu and Drowzee. Rock Slide hits Scyther, Fearow, and Pinsir, OHKOing the former and 2HKOing the latter two. Counter is used alongside Rock Slide in order to punish Fearow's Hyper Beam; the interaction begins with Graveler switching into Fearow's Hyper Beam and using Rock Slide as Fearow recharges. If Fearow switches out, Graveler can use Counter, which then uses the damage from its own Rock Slide in damage calculation, and OHKO whatever switches in. This leaves Fearow in an uncomfortable prediction situation; stay in and risk another Rock Slide, or switch out and risk a teammate getting KOed by Counter. Substitute can be used instead to ease prediction after Graveler switches into Fearow, as it no longer has to decide whether to use Rock Slide on Fearow or use Earthquake to catch whatever switches in. Explosion deals monstrous damage to any foe that isn’t resistant or immune to Normal. Notably, it has a chance to OHKO Porygon, which otherwise walls Graveler. However, Explosion must be used with caution, as once Graveler explodes, its team will have more trouble checking Fearow.</p> <p>When using Graveler, it is important to keep it healthy until the opposing Fearow is KOed. Since Graveler is forced out by Seaking and Staryu, Pokemon that can switch into them, such as Seaking and Staryu for the former, or Drowzee and Vileplume for the latter, are good teammates. The latter three in particular complement Graveler well since Fearow often revenge kills them, giving Graveler free entry. However, it is important to note that Drowzee and Vileplume are quite slow, so it is important to remedy the Speed issue with faster teammates. Two good teammates for this are Rapidash and Arcanine, since they can also function as secondary checks to Fearow, allowing Graveler to use Explosion more freely. They can also fish for Body Slam paralysis on opposing Fire-types and Seaking, making them much worse at checking Graveler.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Golem is generally considered good in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Though Golem is a less used Pokemon in the RBY UU metagame, it certainly has its merits as a wallbreaker for a few reasons, with the biggest being Explosion. An Explosion coming from Golem is actually the strongest attack in the tier, having the power to put a massive dent in defensive stalwart Vaporeon or even OHKO Hypno. A properly timed Explosion can turn the tide of battle in your favor, but that's not all Golem has to offer. With proper paralysis support and good prediction, it can punch holes in enemy teams using STAB moves Earthquake and Rock Slide. Golem can do all this while also having good defensive utility due to its Rock / Ground typing, which gives it a resistance to Normal-type moves and an immunity to Electric-type moves. Wrap is a defining element of RBY UU, and Golem can be a useful part of an anti-Wrap core due to its resistance to the move. In addition, it can switch in on Dodrio or on another Pokemon's predicted Hyper Beam and punish both with impunity. Finally, its Electric immunity makes it easier to switch in on a predicted Thunder Wave or Thunderbolt, especially when paired with one of UU's many strong Water-types, such as Tentacruel.</p> <p>Golem's most glaring weakness is its Speed. Golem is outsped by pretty much every Pokemon that sees play in UU, even Pokemon known for being slow like Omastar and Tangela. Not only does Golem have little special bulk, it also has a host of weaknesses. This means that it can be OHKOed by UU's aforementioned Water types, as well as by Pokemon like Articuno with Blizzard and even Raichu with Surf. Therefore, Golem is heavily reliant on support from its teammates and good predictions in order to make an impact.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Golem's most useful alternative move is Rest, which is used over Substitute or Body Slam as a way to keep Golem healthy. When Golem gets low on health, it can go for Rest as the opponent switches in a sleeping Pokemon to take the Explosion. As mentioned before, it can also burn off the sleep turns by coming in on Wrap and Hyper Beam, or on another sleeping Pokemon. Fire Blast is a possible offensive option that does more damage to Tangela than any of Golem's other moves. It also has the potential to burn foes, which is especially useful against partial-trappers like Dragonite. Finally, Counter can be used after switching into Hyper Beam and or Body Slam, either hitting the recharging foe or punishing an Explosion switch-in.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Due to Golem’s low Special, low Speed, and 4x weakness to Water, any Water-type can OHKO it. Vaporeon can tank anything Golem throws at it, even Explosion from full health. Gyarados can switch in on Earthquake for no damage and OHKO Golem, though it does need to watch out if Golem predicts the switch and uses Rock Slide. Omastar also outspeeds and OHKOes Golem, though Golem does over half of Omastar's health in damage with Earthquake. Tentacruel also takes huge damage from Earthquake and can even be OHKOed by Explosion, but it still maintains the upper hand, as it can OHKO Golem or halt its plans to use Explosion with Wrap. While Golem can be used with another Pokemon like Haunter or Omastar to form an anti-Wrap PP stalling core, it still needs to watch out for Tentacruel's Surf.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: The two notable Grass-types in the tier, Tangela and Venusaur, are both solid checks to Golem. Tangela’s high Defense, resistance to Earthquake, and access to STAB Mega Drain make it an excellent check to Golem. Note that Mega Drain does not OHKO until Tangela has a Growth under its belt, meaning Tangela is still susceptible to taking massive damage from Explosion. In addition, if the Golem player predicts a Tangela switch-in, they can opt for Rock Slide, which Tangela has a harder time shrugging off since it hits for neutral damage. Venusaur is a little worse at switching into Golem, as it does not resist Earthquake and is 3HKOed. However, it easily outspeeds Golem and OHKOes it with Razor Leaf, unlike Tangela, meaning the Golem player has fewer options. In either case, both Tangela and Venusaur force Golem to switch out, meaning they can spread status to Golem's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: As a Flying-type, Articuno is able to switch in on Earthquake and take out Golem easily with STAB Blizzard. However, good prediction on the Golem user’s end can spell disaster for Articuno, as it is OHKOed by Rock Slide. Articuno also will be sent running if Golem uses Substitute or paralyzes it with Body Slam on the switch. While it is a risky play, Golem can even switch into a paralyzed Articuno while it attempts to use Agility. If full paralysis triggers either turn, Golem wins the interaction with Rock Slide. Finally, if Articuno gets unlucky and Blizzard misses while Rock Slide does not, it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Raichu</strong>: Raichu has a hard time switching into Golem's attacks due to Earthquake hitting for super effective damage and Body Slam potentially paralyzing it. However, if it switches in on Rock Slide, Golem is in trouble. Raichu outspeeds it and OHKOes with Surf, forcing Golem out.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake and Rock Slide are Golem's go-to moves early in the game, weaker than Explosion but packing a big punch coming off its base 110 Attack. Due to its powerful STAB moves and Explosion, Golem can be used effectively as a wallbreaker, especially for punishing Pokemon that have just used Rest. For its final moveslot, Substitute is used to help scout moves and Pokemon as well as providing a layer of defense so Golem can get off an Explosion without being KOed first. However, Body Slam can be used over Substitute to help hinder your opponent's team through paralysis, meaning Golem doesn't need to rely on its teammates for paralysis support as much.</p> <p>Explosion is used to deal extraordinary damage to every Pokemon in the tier, with a few exceptions such as Omastar and Haunter. Some notable calculations include a guaranteed OHKO on Persian and possible OHKOs on Tentacruel and Hypno. It is against your opponent's bulky Pokemon that Explosion really shines, taking out hard-to-KO team members or at least putting a huge dent in them so they can be revenge killed. A good example target is Kangaskhan, which Golem switches into and easily tanks a Body Slam from—barely minding potential paralysis due to its Speed—before dealing 72.8-85.7% damage with Explosion to set up a revenge kill. Deciding when to use Explosion can be hard, though, since your opponent can predict it and switch in a Pokemon that is already low on health or that resists it. Anticipate this counterplay and use a different move, such as a STAB move for instant damage, Substitute to scout, or Body Slam for a chance to spread paralysis. It is recommended to use Explosion when Golem is around half health or when you think you can catch Hypno on the switch, either OHKOing this top threat or priming it for a revenge killer like Dugtrio to follow up on.</p> <p>Despite its flaws, Golem still manages to find a few different points of entry into the game. For instance, bringing in Golem is a great way to stop a Dodrio sweep, as Rock Slide deals super effective damage and Golem hard walls Dodrio. It is especially adept at switching into Hyper Beam and punishing Dodrio and Articuno with Rock Slide or Kangaskhan and Persian with Explosion. Golem can also be used as sleep fodder, since its defensive typing means it can freely switch in often on Normal-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves, allowing for easy pivoting. It can even wake up from short sleeps if switched in on Wrap or Hyper Beam enough times.</p> <p>Golem can form an excellent immunity core with Gyarados, as it covers Gyarados's Electric weakness and Gyarados covers its Ground weakness, so both can be effective mid- or late-game by coming in freely on double switches. Pairing Golem with another effective anti-Wrap Pokemon such as Haunter or Omastar is also a valid strategy, as they can work together to PP stall Wrap without sustaining too much damage. Golem works especially well with either because Haunter's Thunderbolt handles its Water-type counters and Omastar's Blizzard dispatches its Grass-type counters. Especially if Golem doesn't run Body Slam, it appreciates paralysis-spreading teammates. A great example is Kadabra, which shrugs off special attacks surprisingly well for it with Recover, revenge kills threats to Golem, and appreciates it taking Normal-type attacks and the crippling Thunder Wave in return. Finally, Dugtrio takes advantage of Golem weakening or KOing an opponent's Ground-type checks to have a much easier time revenge killing or sweeping.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>While in heavy competition with Rhydon for a spot on a team, Golem has merit for its access to Explosion, letting it blow holes in opposing teams for its allies to exploit. Golem's higher Speed compared to Rhydon also pays dividends in Stadium, giving it a 12% critical hit rate that helps it break through opposing Reflect Snorlax and Chansey. These traits make Golem a fair pick on teams weak to Rhydon that need a consistent way to beat bulkier Pokemon like the aforementioned Normal-types, as well as Slowbro and Rest Exeggutor. When provided with paralysis support, Golem is a serious threat, dealing massive damage with its STAB moves while still maintaining the threat of Explosion, often securing the late-game for its team as a result.</p> <p>However, Golem's Explosion and Speed are all it has over Rhydon. Rhydon has superior overall bulk, 103 HP Substitutes to consistently beat Seismic Toss Chansey, and a better Attack stat that gives it more consistent KO ranges. Because of this, on top of Snorlax having a superior self-KO move in STAB Self-Destruct, Golem is very hard to fit onto teams. Golem still has Rhydon's flaws as well: it's very slow and specially frail, making it take mortal damage against special attackers like Starmie, Alakazam, and Lapras, forcing it to use Explosion earlier than one would expect. Its slowness also causes it to lose one-on-one matchups surprisingly frequently, such as against Tauros and Exeggutor. Like Rhydon’s, while Golem's defensive typing does provide a useful Electric immunity for combatting Zapdos and Jolteon, it also gives massive weaknesses to Ice- and Water-type coverage from Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax, making it very difficult for Golem to successfully enter battle and do its job. These problems make Golem a rare sight in Stadium OU, but it’s still a serviceable pick for teams that need a better Rhydon matchup in addition to an Explosion user.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Explosion": {
          "description": "<p>The combination of Rock Slide and Earthquake lets Golem hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage. Rock Slide particularly hits Exeggutor for neutral damage, ensuring it can't repeatedly switch in, lest it be forced to use Rest early. It also hits Flying-types like Articuno and Zapdos for heavy damage, forcing them out and letting Golem scout with Body Slam. Earthquake has the potential to OHKO Gengar and Jolteon while serving as its strongest attack without a drawback. Body Slam serves as a midground option, letting Golem spread paralysis for itself while punishing potential switch-ins. Explosion allows Golem to trade with an important Pokemon; note, however, that it doesn't let Golem survive breaking a Substitute, unlike in regular RBY. This means that scouting the target for Substitute or paralyzing it is recommended.</p> <p>Stadium's Team Preview benefits Golem’s Explosion, as you will always know whether the opponent has a Zapdos, Jolteon, or Gengar on their team. If Zapdos or Jolteon is present, it's best to hold back the Explosion until late-game, where Golem can check them more effectively. Still, remember that Golem struggles to actually get in to check them, as it can be somewhat predictable. Similarly, in Gengar's case, saving Explosion until it’s used its own Explosion or otherwise been crippled is recommended, or it can be used to nullify Explosion completely. Rhydon poses a risk for similar reasons, but it struggles to switch in due to the threat of Earthquake, though it's notable regardless. If none of these Pokemon are present, Explosion can be used much earlier to KO important mid-game Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey. It's also perfectly viable to use it as an emergency check to Slowbro if it's picked up too many Amnesia boosts.</p> <p>Golem has room for customization to further differentiate itself from Rhydon, but this is often a misguided effort, as it has to drop Body Slam or Rock Slide, opening it up to exploitation. Defense Curl or Harden can be used to make Golem more consistently check Snorlax, but this still loses to Amnesia variants. Fire Blast is a somewhat viable option for hitting Exeggutor and burning switch-ins, but this can backfire against Pokemon that prefer being burned, such as Starmie and Chansey. Substitute can potentially be used to guard against status and get more hits in, but Rhydon does this better by a long shot and it makes Golem inclined to use Explosion earlier, so it's not recommended.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Golem stands out in RBY Ubers as a Ground-type with access to Explosion. This gives it a significant niche over Rhydon, letting it deal up to 80% to tier king Mewtwo. With unresisted QuakeSlide coverage, it's not just an Explosion that it offers; its coverage helps immensely against Rhydon, Zapdos, Gengar, and Jolteon. With adequate paralysis support, Golem can deal massive damage and blow up on a high-value Pokemon, providing its teammates with incredible momentum. Golem's typing also gives it a valuable Normal resistance and an Electric immunity, helping to check threats like Tauros and Snorlax and soundly beating Zapdos and Jolteon.</p> <p>However, Golem is only favored over Rhydon on offensive teams that look to overwhelm the opponent with Explosion. Rhydon fits on more team styles and offers added consistency that Golem simply can’t muster. Self-Destruct Snorlax and Explosion Mew, while great partners on offensive teams, are also capable of compressing Golem's role while having potential surprise value and allowing for more consistent team options; notably, Snorlax also possesses a stronger self-KO move thanks to STAB. Ergo, the bulkier and harder-hitting Rhydon can often fill Golem's place just fine, 3HKOing Mewtwo with Earthquake, while Golem can only do so inconsistently. Additionally, Rhydon is capable of walling non-Earthquake Mew sets and making 103 HP Substitutes, which can absorb a Seismic Toss from Chansey. Thus, Rhydon is often recommended if Golem's Explosion isn't required. Furthermore, Golem shares all of Rhydon's flaws: it's slow, specially frail, and has common weaknesses to Ice and Water. Without paralysis support, Golem struggles to win consistently in one-on-one battles, which can't always be afforded in the harsh world of RBY Ubers.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>When customizing Golem's set, it's best to replace Rock Slide, Substitute, or Body Slam, but these come with caveats. Removing Rock Slide makes it difficult for Golem to damage Exeggutor and Zapdos, removing Substitute makes it impossible for Golem to set up in front of paralyzed foes, and removing Body Slam leaves Golem without a midground option while becoming more reliant on its team for paralysis. With this in mind, attempts to customize Golem are not recommended.</p> <p>If you must customize Golem, using Defense Curl or Harden isn't terrible, as these allow Golem to consistently wall non-Earthquake Snorlax variants. In the long run, however, this doesn't pan out, as most non-Earthquake Snorlax variants use Reflect + Rest or Amnesia, which overwhelm Golem through sheer longevity and firepower, respectively. Against the latter, Golem is likely to use Explosion anyway, as Amnesia Snorlax threatens severe damage to its team. Outside of this, Fire Blast is plausible for hitting Exeggutor slightly harder when it switches in and potentially burning it, removing the threat of its Explosion, but the risk of thawing a Pokemon and lack of utility outside of this makes it hard to justify.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: While Mewtwo does not appreciate taking Explosion—which is a guaranteed KO after a single Earthquake—unboosted Psychic 2HKOes Golem and can force Explosion much earlier than desired. If Mewtwo has used Amnesia even once, it must be paralyzed for Golem to do anything. Ice Beam variants completely incapacitate Golem; high damage rolls do enough to even let Zapdos win out. While rare, an unboosted Blizzard from Mewtwo OHKOes Golem half the time. If Mewtwo is paralyzed, however, a single full paralysis lets Golem attempt to 3HKO it with Earthquake, which works a quarter of the time but otherwise leaves Mewtwo easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Thunderbolt + Submission Mewtwo sets actually struggle against Golem, failing to 3HKO it and getting 2HKOed in return by Earthquake + Explosion; thus, it is forced to repeatedly use Recover or switch out. Finally, Barrier Mewtwo completely stops Golem in its tracks, as after a single Defense boost, Earthquake becomes a 6HKO at best, while Explosion deals less than 40%. However, both aforementioned Mewtwo sets are rare.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Users</strong>: Reflect throws a spanner in the works for Golem, swiftly taking a Pokemon out of Explosion KO range; faster Pokemon using Reflect as Golem uses Explosion is particularly depressing. Mew isn't completely incapacitated by an Explosion if it's at full HP and walls Golem if using Reflect sets. If using Earthquake, Mew 3HKOes Golem consistently without having to boost. Golem cannot 3HKO non-Reflect Mew without prior chip damage. Thus, Golem is largely limited to using Explosion and hoping Mew doesn't switch out. Chansey isn't always OHKOed by Explosion, and if it's running Reflect Golem has no hope of winning outside of luck. Moreover, if Chansey is using Ice Beam, it can 2HKO Golem, and this is sometimes run on the same set. Reflect Snorlax is a similarly unfeasible matchup for Golem unless it gets extreme luck, especially if Snorlax is using Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch in on Golem without much fear and put it to sleep. In the event sleep isn't an option, Exeggutor still 2HKOes Golem with Psychic a quarter of the time. However, Exeggutor can't repeatedly switch in on Rock Slide, as it tends to lose out against Seismic Toss users such as Chansey later or otherwise get forced into using Explosion sooner. If Exeggutor is paralyzed and at around half HP, Golem can win with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro and the rarer Starmie and Lapras can all OHKO Golem with Surf. However, Slowbro dislikes having Golem switch in on a predicted Rest, as it forces it to Rest stall with repeated Earthquakes by threat of a 4HKO; a single critical hit can mean it loses outright. If Slowbro has set up prior, Earthquake + Explosion is a viable route to dispatch it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: If Golem takes a super effective hit, it is normally forced into Explosion, which is a less than ideal situation. Mega Drain Exeggutor adores any opportunity to use it against Golem, recovering a minimum of 37.6%. Blizzard users such as Tauros, Jynx, Cloyster, and the rare Dragonite and Articuno also mortally threaten Golem, with the latter even OHKOing it. Tauros can switch in on Golem's Body Slam and threaten a 2HKO with Blizzard. Snorlax may use Blizzard alongside Amnesia to try to sweep, which OHKOes Golem at +2. The rare Victreebel can OHKO Golem with Razor Leaf or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. While it's not likely to win the interaction, Jolteon's Double Kick deals up to 19.8% each time, which can wear Golem down and force an early Explosion.</p>",

        "Explosion": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Earthquake and Rock Slide gives Golem unresisted physical coverage; when factoring in the threat of Explosion, this makes Golem very difficult to switch into. Golem's Earthquake may OHKO Gengar and Jolteon and 2HKOes Alakazam and—rarely—Chansey. It also serves as Golem's best option against Mewtwo and Mew, 3HKOing Mewtwo about a quarter of the time and 3HKOing Mew if it's taken minor damage prior. Furthermore, just a single Earthquake puts Mewtwo in range for Explosion. Golem has a fair shot at wearing down any non-Ice Beam Mewtwo if it's paralyzed, though it's also 2HKOed by Psychic. Rock Slide potentially OHKOes Jynx and 2HKOes Zapdos, ensuring the latter can be consistently dealt with. It is also Golem's best option against Exeggutor, which likes to switch in on it and threaten with sleep. Substitute can allow Golem to place itself in a favorable position if it can set up against paralyzed foes, such as Mewtwo and Chansey. Alternatively, Body Slam allows Golem to be more self-sufficient in spreading paralysis, which can let it turn the tables on switch-ins.</p> <p>Explosion is Golem's claim to fame and should not be taken lightly. It OHKOes non-Reflect Chansey, Jynx, and Alakazam, as well as Starmie 38% of the time. It also deals up to 80% to Mewtwo and up to 75.9% to Mew. Golem itself holds little value once the opposing team's Electric-type has been removed, so using Explosion to incapacitate Mewtwo or Mew is very desirable. In practice, however, this is very difficult, as the threat of Explosion can be enough to force out Mewtwo and Mew if they're in range. Snorlax and Mew often succeed with their self-KO moves because of their set variety, allowing for more effective bluffs, which Golem cannot afford. Another ideal situation for Explosion is when threatened with an Amnesia Snorlax or Slowbro sweep, as it's one of the only consistent ways to prevent them from sweeping once they set up. Landing Explosion on Chansey can enable Mewtwo, and removing Snorlax can be similarly useful for preventing its powerful early-game offense, but this isn't ideal, as it may leave Golem’s team vulnerable to opposing Electric-types late-game. It's recommended to account for opposing Gengar, Rock-types, and frozen or sleeping Pokemon that can switch in to absorb Explosion. Thus, it may be appropriate to keep Golem unrevealed for extended periods of time, whereas Mew and Snorlax generally don't imply their self-KO moves until they actually use them. As a rule of thumb, using Explosion should be a game of trades; understanding the value that each Pokemon holds to the opposing team is pivotal to succeeding.</p> <p>Golem is best played on offensive teams with multiple self-KO move users, such as Self-Destruct Snorlax, Explosion Mew, and Exeggutor; while prediction-heavy and thus inconsistent, these teams are capable of closing out games very quickly. In other cases, Rhydon tends to outclass Golem and should be looked to first. Golem also pairs well with Water-types like Slowbro and the rarer Starmie and Lapras, which appreciate its Electric immunity. Slowbro notably punishes non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo, and the combination of Slowbro and Golem is capable of muscling past it without compromising your own Mewtwo. However, both are painfully slow, which can be problematic on a poorly built team. Paralysis support is paramount so that the opposition doesn't recover out of KO range, so Pokemon like Chansey, Starmie, Stun Spore Exeggutor, and the aforementioned Slowbro are recommended. Golem tends to hold little value to a team due to its disposable nature, so sacrificing it against sleepers like Exeggutor and Sing Chansey isn't unusual. In fact, against Chansey, it's plausible to cut your losses and have Golem use Explosion in response to a missed Sing, potentially OHKOing it and enabling Mewtwo.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Golem's Rock / Ground typing makes it a strong attacker that crucially hard counters Zapdos and Jolteon while resisting Normal-type attacks. Its QuakeSlide coverage is completely unresisted and able to 2HKO Pokemon like Rhydon, Zapdos, and Alakazam. This makes Golem excellent at bullying paralyzed Pokemon, but what tops this all off is Explosion. Golem's Explosion, while just shy of Snorlax's Self-Destruct's strength, is terrifyingly strong, even having a chance to OHKO Starmie. Explosion Golem is likely to break even (at worst) against most Pokemon, and this has kept it relevant for decades.</p> <p>However, Golem is very slow and has devastating weaknesses to most common special attacks; it has to run from Blizzard, Surf, Razor Leaf, and whatnot. Even neutral special attacks such as Psychic will deal significant damage to Golem. Further, being so slow means Golem gets forced to use Explosion in many one-on-one fights. Due to these two setbacks, Golem is very reliant on enemy teams being riddled with paralysis before it gets going. Plus, while Explosion can theoretically compensate for Golem's Speed and let it break even frequently, Golem generally shouldn't use Explosion until the opponent's Zapdos or Jolteon is accounted for, lest its team crumble to them. Therefore, decision-making with Explosion is difficult until Zapdos or Jolteon is paralyzed or KOed, after which it can be deployed more freely and actually exert offensive pressure. This can make its role seem a little paradoxical to the uninitiated.</p> <p>Golem famously fell from RBY OU in 2019, ending a long-standing battle between it and Rhydon for places on competitive teams. Understanding this is important, as while many teams can use Golem adequately, they tend to be better off with Rhydon instead. This is because Rhydon has a higher Attack stat, which allows it to achieve damage thresholds like 2HKOing Chansey and rarely 2HKOing Starmie. It's also capable of sometimes 3HKOing Slowbro, defusing a key threat if it switches in on Rest. The extra damage output against Exeggutor, Rhydon's and Golem's biggest counter and most common switch-in, is also a key advantage; Exeggutor cannot safely switch in as much as it would like against the rocky rhino. Additionally, Rhydon is bulkier thanks to its higher HP, which also enables 104 HP Substitutes to stomach Seismic Toss or Night Shade. This quirk helps Rhydon reliably run and use Substitute in general; it can fish for Substitute in situations where Golem is forced to use Explosion, making it even harder for Golem to justify itself on teams. Regardless, Golem's strong perks over Rhydon remain recognized: possessing the second-strongest self-KO move and outrunning Rhydon allow it to indisputably succeed over Rhydon on highly specific teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Customizing Golem usually involves looking at what it has over Rhydon, but this tends to be a fool's errand when looking beyond Explosion. If you must customize Golem, Body Slam is the most replaceable option, but note that this means its team will need at least one more reliable paralysis-spreading Pokemon to be effective.</p> <p>Golem can run Substitute to try and be like its brother Rhydon, but at that point, it's usually better to bite the bullet and use the stony superior. The utility of having both Substitute and Explosion is typically just not enough. Fire Blast can burn Exeggutor switching in, effectively ruining its Explosion, but it deals just barely more damage than Rock Slide, and Golem is usually forced out thereafter anyway. Defense Curl or Harden can let Golem consistently wall Snorlax and reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, but these perks are dubious at best in respect to what Golem wants to do.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch into Golem's Earthquake and threaten it with Sleep Powder or Psychic, forcing it out and granting Exeggutor's team significant momentum. Mega Drain variants are particularly soul-crushing, almost OHKOing Golem while letting Exeggutor recover almost half its HP. Once Exeggutor is at half HP and paralyzed, however, it's in Rock Slide's 2HKO range and cannot switch in.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: It's hard to name a Pokemon in RBY OU that doesn't have a super effective move against Golem. Any Pokemon with Surf or Razor Leaf, such as Starmie, Venusaur, or Victreebel, can OHKO Golem outright. Blizzard or Ice Beam users like Starmie, Chansey, Articuno, Tauros, and Amnesia Snorlax can also deal significant-to-heavy damage to Golem. Even Rhydon's Earthquake 2HKOes. Golem can usually take non-STAB Blizzard from full HP though, so keep this in mind for when a risky trade is necessary.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Normal-types</strong>: Reflect Snorlax doesn't care about anything Golem can throw at it, effortlessly trading blows with it. If it has Ice Beam, the matchup becomes completely unwinnable. The best Golem can offer in the matchup is using Explosion before Snorlax can use Reflect, after Reflect has already been revealed, but this should only be done in desperate situations. Reflect Chansey can perform similar feats, being just fast enough to use Reflect before Golem can use Explosion by default, but it should be at least a little afraid if paralyzed and without Reflect set up.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: While it's afraid of Body Slam paralysis, Starmie normally runs at least one super effective move against Golem, namely Surf or Blizzard. Surf OHKOes Golem outright, while Blizzard deals up to 79.8%. Unlike Rhydon, Golem can't 2HKO Starmie without a very lucky critical hit or Explosion. While Golem does like to use Explosion against Starmie, it's only 38.5% to OHKO, so the matchup remains a bad situation for it in a vacuum. Golem can only outright win this matchup if Starmie has taken prior damage or paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: You know it's bad when Clamp deals over half a Pokemon's HP. While Cloyster greatly fears Rock Slide, especially if paralyzed, it can use Blizzard to potentially OHKO Golem in return, or Clamp—liberally—to scout for its switch-in.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>QuakeSlide coverage allows Golem to hit the entire RBY roster for at least neutral damage. Rock Slide potentially OHKOes Articuno, Moltres, and Jynx; it also 2HKOes Zapdos and sometimes Dragonite. Earthquake is Golem's strongest attack without drawbacks and should be used liberally; it can OHKO Gengar and Jolteon and 2HKO Alakazam and Rhydon. Body Slam lets Golem be more self-sufficient in the paralysis-spreading effort, and it's useful to potentially incapacitate checks like Starmie and Exeggutor.</p> <p>What defines Golem, however, is Explosion. The dream of a Golem player is to beat out Zapdos or Jolteon late-game, then use Explosion on the opponent's last healthy Pokemon. This is a difficult dream to attain, but not impossible. Golem should ideally use Explosion very late into a game; usually, this is when the trade is clearly game-winning and the potential Electric-type threat has been accounted for. If Golem uses Explosion before Zapdos or Jolteon is revealed, its team may fall apart. Knowing common team structures and strategies involving these Pokemon is essential to predict if Explosion is safe prior to the last Pokemon being revealed. Tauros, Snorlax, and Chansey are omnipresent, so this can alleviate prediction by a chunk. Golem should ideally use Explosion against Starmie, which normally threatens Golem's partners with its sublime coverage and Speed. Starmie should ideally be ever-so-slightly chipped or paralyzed before doing this, as an OHKO isn't guaranteed. If Starmie lacks Surf, Golem can add the chip damage itself, as Blizzard deals 79.3% at most without a critical hit. If Starmie isn't present, Golem can also use Explosion on Chansey or Snorlax to pave the way for Tauros. Outside of this, Explosion can be a handy contingency plan in the event Slowbro snowballs out of control.</p> <p>Golem is frequently pushed out by Rhydon on teams, as its Explosion and favorable matchup against its rocky friend are typically unnecessary. Parties that require these traits typically use Pokemon like Moltres, which appreciate a better matchup against Rhydon- and Zapdos-centric teams. Teams that can't afford to compress the self-KO role onto Snorlax with Self-Destruct, or that wish to use an Explosion user alongside it, can also utilize Golem over Rhydon. Teams that feature many Explosion users—\"Boom Offense\"—will sometimes include Golem, but its low defensive utility makes it a tough fit even then.</p>"

Rapidash faces heavy competition from Moltres, which can switch into Earthquake from Dugtrio and Kangaskhan and get more damage off with Fire Blast and Fire Spin.

Body Slam paralyzes switch-ins like Vaporeon and Tentacruel, and reduces risk when using Fire Spin against Dugtrio. Hyper Beam is for finishing off a Pokemon after it gets worn down by Fire Spin and does more damage than Fire Blast to Pokemon like Persian, Raichu, and Kadaba.</p> <p>Stomp is an alternative that goes well on paralysis spam teams with partners like Hypno and Dragonite using Thunder Wave, as it makes Rapidash able to go for paraflinch.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Rapidash's blazing fast base 105 Speed makes it tied for PU's fastest Pokemon and one of only two that outspeeds Fearow. This in conjunction with a powerful Fire Blast makes Rapidash incredible at revenge killing arguably PU's most dangerous offensive threat and sweeper while also making it a potent revenge killer and progress-maker against the entire metagame. It is notably an effective check against foes such as Gastly, Scyther, and Psychic-types. Its Fire Blast 3HKOes every non-resistant Pokemon at worst, while Body Slam and Hyper Beam coming off a strong base 100 Attack stat threaten every Fire-resistant Pokemon except Graveler, which dislikes taking Fire Blast, and the rare Omanyte. Fire Blast and Body Slam's burn and paralysis chance, respectively, also make Rapidash a potent status spreader that can easily turn the tables against otherwise strong checks like Nidoqueen. Rapidash's fantastic Speed also gives it an incredibly high critical hit rate and lets it make use of Fire Spin to pivot around or wear down foes in otherwise losing matchups.</p> <p>However, Rapidash suffers as a result of it being outclassed in many roles by Arcanine. While Arcanine doesn't outspeed Fearow or learn Fire Spin, it still outspeeds every other relevant threat while packing much higher bulk and slightly higher Attack, letting it trade hits and make progress much more effectively against the metagame in general. It doesn't even matchup that poorly against Fearow, as it survives a Double-Edge into Hyper Beam, which Rapidash fails to do most of the time. Rapidash can find use outside the lead given that Arcanine is PU's best lead, but even in this role it has competition with Magmar; while Rapidash has a superior Fearow and Scyther matchup and access to Agility, Magmar has a much better movepool, improving its matchup against Water-types like Seaking. Rapidash and Arcanine can also be used together without leading either, but these structures tend to be weak to Seaking. As a check to Fearow, Rapidash has competition with Graveler, which walls Fearow and Scyther, though Graveler's low Speed and typing give it a very polarized matchup spread. To make matters worse, Arcanine's excellence means that teams tend to bring multiple answers to Fire-types, such as Nidoqueen and Seaking. Omanyte deserves a special mention, because while it's rare, it stonewalls both Rapidash and Arcanine. Teams using Rapidash must use it alongside Arcanine, taking advantage of the duo's ability to weaken their shared checks while playing to Rapidash's one major advantage over Arcanine, its higher Speed.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Toxic can be used in conjunction with Fire Spin to increase the amount of damage each turn, but this is unreliable, costs a moveslot Rapidash can't afford, and grants immunity to more impactful statuses. Stomp can be used over Fire Spin or Agility to help Rapidash break through foes with a 47.5% chance of preventing the foe's turn if it's paralyzed. Unlike Fire Spin, even if the foe manages to move, Stomp still does damage. Reflect is another option to increase Rapidash's physical bulk, but it still doesn't let Rapidash beat foes like Nidoqueen unless it can set up the move without taking damage, and fast foes such as Arcanine, Fearow, and opposing Rapidash can bypass the Defense boost with critical hits.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Water-types:</strong> Seaking can 2HKO Rapidash with Surf and usually survives the combination of two Body Slams into Hyper Beam from Rapidash, letting it both switch into and beat Rapidash one-on-one. It can even use Rapidash as setup fodder with Agility. Although Staryu beats Rapidash one-on-one barring paralysis from Body Slam, its physical frailty gives it a much harder time switching in compared to other Water-types, as Hyper Beam can KO it from 68.8%. However, Rapidash also must be wary of paralysis from Staryu's Thunder Wave. Omanyte is without a doubt Rapidash's hardest counter. Fire Blast and Body Slam do a maximum of 12.8% and 13.1% to Omanyte, while its Surf easily 2HKOes Rapidash. Rapidash's best method of handling Omanyte without team support is to burn it with Fire Blast as it switches in, then chip its HP with Fire Spin, using the 6.25% each turn from burn as its main source of damage. The rare Slowpoke can survive Rapidash's combination of two Body Slams and Hyper Beam while 3HKOing it back with Surf, letting it beat Rapidash one-on-one; it can even paralyze it with Thunder Wave. However, Slowpoke's extremely low Speed means it'll likely be revenge killed after the interaction.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis:</strong> Since Rapidash is reliant on its Speed, paralysis is devastating. Because of this, Rapidash is often forced out by Pokemon it would otherwise beat, such as Drowzee and Dragonair. Rapidash also has to watch out for Body Slam from opposing Fire-types, and it often ends up trading Body Slam paralysis with them. Rapidash can eliminate the paralysis Speed drop with Agility, though Rapidash's middling bulk makes it difficult for it to spend a turn using Agility every time it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users:</strong> Although they all have trouble switching in and fear burn, Nidoqueen, Machamp, Graveler, and Sandslash are all able to 2HKO Rapidash with Earthquake. In return, Rapidash 3HKOes Nidoqueen and Machamp, 4HKOes Graveler, and has a 38.2% chance to 2HKO Sandslash. Since all of these Pokemon are slow and fear burn, they prefer to deal with Rapidash once it's paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types:</strong> Despite being slower, Arcanine easily outdamages Rapidash's combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam with its own, and it often carries Agility to negate the paralysis Speed drop. If it carries Reflect, Rapidash has no hope of breaking through it outside of critical hits. Rapidash can often trade hits effectively with opposing Rapidash, with the winner usually being weakened and paralyzed after the exchange. Magmar often runs Counter, forcing Rapidash to use Fire Blast against it rather than Body Slam. Even if Magmar is not running Counter, simply the threat of the move will force Rapidash to predict. Rapidash generally beats Magmar if its already been confirmed to not carry Counter, although Magmar is still able to paralyze Rapidash with Body Slam or get lucky with Confuse Ray, Smokescreen, and Psychic.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Offensive": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Fire Blast is Rapidash's strongest move, most notably having a 36.3% chance to 2HKO Fearow, but these odds are bolstered by Double-Edge's recoil, Fire Blast's burn rate, and Rapidash's high critical hit rate. Additionally, Fire Blast's chance to burn lets Rapidash potentially beat Earthquake users, such as Nidoqueen and Machamp. Body Slam allows Rapidash to fish for paralysis, and it in conjunction with Hyper Beam threatens every Fire-resistant Pokemon except for Graveler and Omanyte, letting Rapidash make progress against foes such as Seaking, Arcanine, and Dragonair. Fire Spin complements Rapidash's high Speed, but it is important not to use the move recklessly, as it is very inaccurate, and one miss could result in Rapidash taking paralysis or getting hit by a strong attack. Because of this, Fire Spin is generally recommended only when Rapidash is in a pinch, such as when it needs to beat Nidoqueen one-on-one. Fire Spin also synergizes with Fire Blast burns, as it can wear down foes such as Porygon and Omanyte. Agility is an alternative; while boosting the Speed of the fastest Pokemon in PU might seem redundant, it lets Rapidash negate the Speed drop from paralysis, letting it better take on foes such as opposing Fire-types and Staryu. It also reapplies burn's Attack drop, pairing nicely with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Given Arcanine's sheer excellence as a lead, Rapidash should be used as backup rather than a lead. Generally, lead Arcanine will find itself trading hits with opposing lead Arcanine and lead Nidoqueen, which works well for Rapidash because even if Arcanine gets KOed, it wears down and often inflicts status on a Rapidash check. Nidoqueen is another viable lead, letting players preserve Arcanine and giving them greater flexibility in how they use their Fire-types to weaken their shared checks. Rapidash struggles a lot against Seaking, and teams that use both Rapidash and Arcanine in the back tend to be especially weak to it. Gastly is a great partner for this reason, acting as a fantastic check to Seaking. It also forces Fearow to use Drill Peck against it, allowing Rapidash to switch directly into Fearow in dire situations, since it is much more likely to survive Hyper Beam after Drill Peck as opposed to Double-Edge. In return, Rapidash can check opposing Fire-types and Psychic-types for Gastly. Staryu can notably stonewall Seaking, preventing it from punishing Rapidash outside of double switches. While rare, Omanyte stonewalls both Rapidash and Arcanine, making teammates like the aforementioned Gastly and Staryu useful for this matchup as well. Water-types such as Seaking and Staryu serve as effective checks to Ground-types such as Nidoqueen, with the former even able to use them as setup fodder. Rapidash isn't helpless against Ground-types, however, and it can easily revenge kill these foes or sometimes trade hits with them to enable a teammate like Arcanine. Fearow is another notable teammate that shares checks with the Fire-types, working together with them to weaken and blow past these foes. Magneton is another teammate that can deal with Water-types, while Rapidash in return can lure in and weaken Ground-types.</p> <p>Rapidash is best revealed when its time to revenge kill a foe, notably taking out Fearow after it has taken damage from attacks such as Seaking and Nidoqueen's Blizzard or Gastly's Thunderbolt. Rapidash is best used as a mid-game progress maker, weakening the opposing team to enable a teammate like Fearow to sweep, though sometimes it can act as a cleaner instead if the opposing team is sufficiently weakened. Rapidash can generally be relied upon to beat frailer and Fire-weak foes such as Gastly, Scyther, and the Psychic-types one-on-one, and it also has an even matchup with Staryu when factoring in paralysis and critical hits. In the rare instance that the opponent is using Omanyte, players should aggressively try to switch in checks such as Gastly and Staryu to try to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Double switches, especially early-game, can be very punishing against Omanyte. If faced with a foe like Nidoqueen and Omanyte while having no teammate to switch into them, Rapidash can use Fire Spin to try to pivot out into a check.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Rapidash finds a niche in NU thanks to its Speed and the inconsistent but infamous Fire Spin. Crucially outspeeding important Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Venomoth, Raticate, and Charizard, Rapidash generally relies on Fire Blast, Body Slam, and Toxic to spread status before using Fire Spin to chip down foes into range of its other moves. It also can clean up late game or revenge kill; its base 100 Attack makes it more effective at taking out physically frail foes like Mr. Mime compared to Charizard. Fire Spin can enable pivoting to escape dangerous checks and set up favorable matchups, and it's an effective way to gain momentum if Rapidash gets in against something that is likely to switch out, like Venomoth or Exeggcute. Rapidash can also team up with Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres to add even more chances to land Fire Spin and status moves to wear down foes.</p> <p>Of course, Toxic + Fire Spin is a strategy with extremely shaky accuracy, and Rapidash's poor bulk does it no favors; it's 2HKOed by all Water-types and even rarely OHKOed by Seadra's Hydro Pump and Kingler's Crabhammer. Charizard's Earthquake also 2HKOes it, and Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Clefable can paralyze it, rendering it useless, so Rapidash has very few chances to attack or use Toxic without facing decimation in return. Kabutops also puts a stop to Fire Spin-reliant strategies in a hurry; Rapidash has no way to break through it other than applying burn or poison and hoping for extreme luck with Fire Spin. Golem is also difficult for Rapidash to break, Electrode is fast enough to force it out with the threat of Thunder Wave, and other Thunder Wave users can easily exploit Fire Spin misses, so Rapidash has multiple weaknesses against most teams. Poisoning the foe can also be problematic, as rendering dangerous foes like Charizard and Mr. Mime immune to paralysis may let them sweep. As a result, Rapidash is not recommended on the vast majority of teams.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Rapidash's Speed combined with Fire Spin is the main reason to use it over better Pokemon like Ninetales and Moltres, and it serves to rack up chip damage, pivot out of bad matchups, and amplify status spread to the enemy team, forcing them to take as much as 10% per switch-in if poisoned or burned. Fire Blast is Rapidash's main attack, 3HKOing most non-resistant foes like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Nidoking and 2HKOing frailer threats like Raticate and Venomoth. With a little chip damage from Fire Spin, these 3HKOs become 2HKOs, such as against Mr. Mime. Rapidash's base 100 Attack allows it to use Body Slam to decent effect, potentially paralyzing foes while dealing passable damage. Hyper Beam is a strong finisher against Mr. Mime in particular, dealing a minimum of 49.4% to it. Toxic can be used over the physical moves, but this is an inconsistent strategy and Rapidash will rarely manage to spread Toxic without taking paralysis or massive damage in return. If it's landed safely, it allows Rapidash to secure extra chip damage on each Fire Spin.</p> <p>Rapidash appreciates help from teammates that can spread status, like Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and Clefable, to buy it a little additional safety and give it chances to get in. It also likes bulky allies like Blastoise that can spread Toxic and other Fire-types to burn foes with Fire Blast and use their own Fire Spin to capitalize. Charizard is also good to capitalize on this chip damage; it comes just short of OHKOing many foes with a +2 Hyper Beam or Earthquake, so a little chip can set it up perfectly. Additional Fire-types also help to overwhelm common checks like Blastoise and Golem, which otherwise will inevitably manage to break through.</p>"

Its initially terrible Special can be boosted with Amnesia, turning it into a devastating wallbreaker that can be very hard to KO. While Slowpoke's Speed is the worst in the game, Slowpoke can actually outspeed many foes due to its access to Thunder Wave and a boosting move. Slowpoke's excellent Water / Psychic typing grants neutral coverage against every foe except itself and lets it hit common threats like Nidoqueen and Rapidash for super effective damage. However, Slowpoke's awful base Special and Speed force it to spend multiple turns setting up, providing time for foes to break through or wear it down. This makes Slowpoke an all-or-nothing Pokemon: it often gets only one opportunity per game to set up, and it will rarely sweep due to how much damage it takes in the process. However, when played correctly, Slowpoke can smash through or cripple key pieces of the opposing team, paving the way for a teammate to clean late-game.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest or Reflect can be used over either of Slowpoke's attacking moves. The former increases Slowpoke's longevity, making it easier for it to potentially sweep teams. However, Slowpoke's average physical bulk still leaves it 3HKOed by common foes like Fearow and Nidoqueen. The latter makes it much harder for physical attackers to break through it, but damage can still accumulate quickly over time, and many common physical attackers can bypass this boost through critical hits, such as Fearow and Pinsir. Additionally, only having one attacking move can leave Slowpoke walled by either Psychic-types, like Abra and Drowzee, or Water-types, like Staryu and Seaking. Ice-type moves may initially seem useable, since they target Grass-types and Dragonair, foes Slowpoke has huge trouble with. However, Psychic already hits every viable Grass-type for super effective damage, and if it can land an attack, Thunder Wave is more than enough to ruin Dragonair. Additionally, relying on Ice / Water coverage results in Slowpoke being walled by Water-types, while Ice / Psychic coverage is strictly worse against Psychic- and Fire-types than Slowpoke's STAB combination.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Sleep Inducers</strong>: Every unparalyzed sleep user can outspeed Slowpoke and put it to sleep. Notably, Drowzee and Vileplume don't mind paralysis or Slowpoke's unboosted attacks that much, and thus are likely to eventually land sleep. However, other sleepers such as Gastly dislike Slowpoke's attacks and Thunder Wave, letting Slowpoke get past them if it gets lucky.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Nidoqueen, Gastly, Staryu, and Dragonair can 2HKO Slowpoke with Thunderbolt. However, these foes must be wary of taking Slowpoke's boosted attacks, and all but Nidoqueen hate Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Fearow and Pinsir can easily overwhelm Slowpoke while it's setting up. However, they are liable to take paralysis and significant damage while doing so, and thus they prefer only coming in against Slowpoke to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Weepinbell</strong>: Weepinbell outspeeds Slowpoke, and its Razor Leaf has a 53.8% chance to OHKO with a critical hit. Weepinbell can also easily put Slowpoke into guaranteed KO range using Wrap, and it isn't OHKOed by a +2 Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Every unparalyzed Pokemon with a partial trapping move can outspeed, pivot around, and wear Slowpoke down into KO range. However, many of these, such as Pinsir and Rapidash, rely on very inaccurate partial trapping moves, and thus they need unreasonable amounts of luck to get Slowpoke into KO range from full. Wrap users and Dragonair in particular threaten Slowpoke the most due to Wrap having the highest accuracy out of any partial trapping move.</p>",

Slowpoke enjoys fellow paralysis spreaders like Abra and Staryu, as they let it skip having to paralyze its foe while setting up, and combined they force more paralysis on the opposing team. Slowpoke can be used as a lead, beating or crippling offensive Fire-type leads, like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar. However, Slowpoke loses quite badly to sleep leads, and it's vulnerable to Dragonair's Wrap.

Its Speed tier also makes it a solid Thunder Wave absorber, since it does not mind a Speed drop. It can find setup opportunities on Pokemon it can threaten out with paralysis, or resist the attacks of, which includes Arcanine and Poliwhirl. After an Amnesia, it can deal good damage against Fire-types such as Moltres and Charizard and wall special attackers like Mr. Mime and Porygon.

Rest allows Slowpoke to continue its sweep by recovering hits taken while setting up, especially thanks to its increased special bulk due to Amnesia. Thunder Wave allows Slowpoke to outspeed and cripple Pokemon that can threaten it.</p> <p>Slowpoke has a very solid movepool, leaving a good amount of options to choose from. Psychic can be used over Surf, as, even though it is weaker against neutral targets, it sports a 30% special drop rate. It also hits Venomoth super effectively, as well as gaining a neutral hit on Water-types such as Blastoise and Kabutops. Blizzard allows Slowpoke to hit Exeggcute super effectively, as well as still hitting Moltres and Charizard. It also allows Slowpoke to fish for a freeze, which can be useful in a pinch. Ice Beam, although weaker than Blizzard, is more reliable. Fire Blast can deal good damage to Grass- and Bug-types, having a 28.2% chance of OHKOing the likes of Pinsir after an Amnesia. Toxic over Thunder Wave or Rest helps Slowpoke against partial trapping users such as Dragonair and Pinsir. Earthquake over either of those moves allows Slowpoke to deal good damage to Electrode. However, it serves little purpose outside this.</p> <p>Slowpoke is vulnerable to most Electric-type coverage within the tier, so having an Electric-immune teammate helps greatly. Nidoking and Golem are prime examples of this. Nidoking can switch into Electric-type moves from threats such as Electrode while taking out Pokemon that can force out Slowpoke like Clefable. Golem can switch into moves such as Mr. Mime's Thunderbolt and, after minor damage, KO with Explosion and let Slowpoke in for a sweep. Mr. Mime deserves a special mention, as it is all-around useful and can break through Water-type Pokemon such as Blastoise and Kabutops. Poliwhirl can be used alongside Slowpoke, as Slowpoke spreading paralysis opens Poliwhirl up to sweep late-game. Partial trappers such as Pinsir and Moltres provide a great form of chip damage to facilitate a late-game sweep with Slowpoke. Sleep support from Venomoth or Clefable gives Slowpoke reliable turns to set up against its foes.</p>"

Slowbro's Amnesia set, known as \"TobyBro\" and first created by Wintermute in the early 2000s, is the best check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo in the tier while being a very strong Pokemon in its own right. Amnesia, along with a great typing and excellent bulk, gives Slowbro immense sweeping potential. A boosted Surf is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing almost everything in the tier, and even resistant foes are 3HKOed. Amnesia also helps Slowbro patch up its Electric weakness, since Special is used for both offense and defense. Slowbro can even use Thunder Wave to fix its miserable Speed, and it can also reapply the foe's Speed drops from paralysis by using Amnesia.</p> <p>However, Slowbro will take very heavy damage from a critical hit Thunderbolt regardless of boosts, forcing it to use Rest earlier, and many Electric-type Pokemon have very high critical hit rates courtesy of their high Speed. Slowbro's abysmal Speed, while mitigated by Thunder Wave, can give it trouble as it tries to boost against faster threats while also necessitating some amount of paralysis support from teammates. Slowbro is also very one-dimensional and predictable; however, it will always be one of the most dangerous sweepers, no matter how much the opponent might know it is coming.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowbro has the option of forgoing Thunder Wave to run any one of the following options. Withdraw is a very strong option to bolster Slowbro's Defense and allow it to take Explosions, removing a prime option for dealing with it. Withdraw also allows Slowbro to reapply paralysis Speed drops more easily. Its massive 61 PP, combined with Rest, allows Slowbro to PP stall almost any Pokemon it needs to, such as opposing Thunder Wave Slowbro. The Defense boost also lets Slowbro counter Snorlax and Mew, which would otherwise be able to hit Slowbro for decent damage. However, Withdraw Slowbro can be very passive, and teams can take advantage of that with faster threats that Slowbro cannot outspeed without Thunder Wave. Reflect is also an option, as an instant +2 in Defense can be crucial in certain situations, such as Snorlax and Tauros needing instant walling as opposed to permitting multiple turns of setup. However, lower PP, an inability to reapply Speed drops, and an inability to boost past +2 make Reflect less desirable.</p> <p>Slowbro can also run two attacks, Surf and either Ice Beam or Psychic. Ice Beam prevents Exeggutor from checking Slowbro and can freeze Mewtwo, Chansey, and opposing Slowbro. On the other hand, Psychic allows Slowbro to hit Lapras and pressure Mewtwo, Starmie, and Light Screen Chansey with Special drops. However, running two attacks makes Slowbro more reliant on paralysis support from teammates to be able to outspeed and threaten certain Pokemon like Tauros and Mew. Two attacks Slowbro also gets PP stalled by Thunder Wave Slowbro. Toxic is a niche option to win mirrors against Withdraw Slowbro, since using Rest does not reset the bad poison timer. Also, Toxic can allow Slowbro to effectively pressure and even remove Light Screen Chansey, which otherwise walls it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode all carry Thunderbolt, which can stop Slowbro from setting up easily. All three of these Pokemon also have good critical hit rates, and a critical hit Thunderbolt from any of them will OHKO Slowbro outright. However, none of them can switch into a boosted attack, and all three are devastated by paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage</strong>: Non-Electric types like Starmie, Gengar, and Mewtwo can all run Thunderbolt to pressure Slowbro. All three have good critical hit rates, and a critical Thunderbolt can ruin Slowbro. Chansey can also run Thunderbolt, but it is less common; it also has a mediocre critical hit rate, meaning it struggles to pressure Slowbro after it has set up.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Exeggutor and Lapras avoid the 2HKO from +6 Surf and can put Slowbro to sleep with Sleep Powder and Sing, respectively. Lapras also carries Thunderbolt and can deal heavy damage with a critical hit. However, +6 Ice Beam OHKOes Exeggutor, while +2 Ice Beam 2HKOes it, and +4 Psychic 2HKOes Lapras, meaning you must scout for these moves before using these Pokemon to check Slowbro. In a similar vein, Victreebel and Cloyster avoid the OHKO from +6 Surf and can remove Slowbro with Wrap + Razor Leaf or Clamp + Explosion, respectively. However, a single miss of their partial trapping moves can spell doom for either.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen Chansey</strong>: Slowbro cannot 3HKO Chansey after Light Screen with +6 Surf, and it will eventually PP stall Slowbro. However, Slowbro can win the interaction if it gets lucky with a few paralysis turns. Slowbro carrying Toxic also does not fear Light Screen Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Depending on the set, Slowbro can be checked by its other sets. Thunder Wave beats two attacks sets, Withdraw beats any set besides Toxic, and Toxic always beats every other set.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Surf is very strong after a few Amnesia boosts, achieving things like a high chance to 2HKO Chansey at +6 and 2HKOs on Mew, Mewtwo, and Snorlax at +4. Amnesia is what makes this set threatening, letting Slowbro become very bulky and very powerful. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to patch up its awful Speed and more effectively threaten faster Pokemon. This is amplified by the threat of Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops. Slowbro can also use paralysis to have a chance at beating its checks, like Light Screen Chansey and Starmie. Rest allows Slowbro to stick around for much longer and ensures that a single critical hit cannot end its sweep. It also protects Slowbro from chip damage, which is likely to accumulate while switching in and boosting with Amnesia. However, a sleeping Slowbro is very easy to take advantage of, and many opponents will use it as a chance to switch in their Explosion user or Thunderbolt Mewtwo.</p> <p>When using Slowbro, it is very important to scout your opponent's team for Electric-type coverage, especially Thunderbolt on Chansey or Mewtwo. However, Chansey very rarely uses Thunderbolt in Ubers, meaning it is usually safe to set up against. Slowbro is very good at setting up against and paralyzing Mewtwo, as it takes very little damage from Mewtwo's attacks even after it has boosted, unless Mewtwo reveals Thunderbolt or gets a critical hit. Either can force Slowbro to repeatedly use Rest and allow Mewtwo to win the interaction with some luck. Slowbro itself is a very good paralysis absorber, since its pitiful Speed means it is not affected much by it. Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops means even a paralyzed Slowbro can outspeed most foes after a few uses of the move. The most common way to remove Slowbro is with Explosion, so users such as Snorlax, Golem, Mew, Exeggutor, and Gengar should be watched carefully. Slowbro should be used with a good absorber of the move, such as Jynx, Rhydon, or your own Golem or Gengar. Absorbing Explosion with these Pokemon requires good prediction on when the foe is about to use the move to switch them in at the right time. Predicting wrong can result in Slowbro getting KOed or the opponent gaining momentum. Alternatively, you can choose to not reveal your Slowbro until later in the game, after the rest of your team has already dealt with opposing Explosion users.</p> <p>Slowbro especially appreciates Rhydon and Golem as Explosion absorbers, since they are immune to the Electric-type moves that give Slowbro so much trouble. However, Rhydon and Slowbro are both very slow, so using them together requires extra care. If your chosen strategy is to deal with Explosion users before revealing Slowbro, other Pokemon that attract the move such as Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo can be used. Slowbro can struggle to beat certain checks such as Exeggutor and Lapras, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as BoltBeam Chansey, are appreciated.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Amnesia Slowbro has gone down in history as one of the most famous and well-known sets in the world of competitive Pokemon. Generally known as TobyBro, Amnesia Slowbro is a moveset that combines both simplicity and efficiency. The RBY version of Amnesia is arguably the best stat-boosting move of all time, raising the Special stat by two stages. It quickly powers up Slowbro's Special moves, while covering its main defensive weakness: Electric-type attacks. Having one of the best physical defense stats in the game and learning Thunder Wave to make up for its awful Speed greatly helps make Slowbro more threatening as well.</p> <p>However, Slowbro is also a bit of an all-or-nothing Pokemon and requires some luck, which are the main reasons why it's often an overlooked Pokemon. Without setting up, Slowbro is basically a useless Pokemon; it can't Recover to work as a wall for a long time, and offensively, it lacks Explosion or a sleep move, unlike other specially based Pokemon. On the other hand, if Slowbro sets up, it's meant never to switch out, so the user is inevitably taking some risks; Electric-type moves fail to get past a +6 Slowbro normally, but with a critical hit, a non-STAB Thunderbolt will nearly OHKO Slowbro while a STAB Thunderbolt will OHKO outright. With critical hit rates being much higher in RBY than in later generations, it's not really \"bad luck\" when Slowbro ultimately ends up falling to a critical hit Thunderbolt. To a lesser extent, this can also be applied to the physical side, potentially turning 4HKOs into 3HKOs, letting a physical sweeper get past Rest. However, while it's true that Slowbro depends on quite a bit on luck, it also requires a good deal of skill, and Slowbro can be one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the first generation, being the best Amnesia user in RBY after Mewtwo.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is another attacking move Slowbro can use. Its biggest upside is hitting Grass-types and Zapdos for super effective damage, including Exeggutor and Victreebel. Ice Beam will often surprise Exeggutor, OHKOing it at +6. At the very least, it will force Exeggutor to use Explosion earlier, making it more predictable. Meanwhile, Zapdos is 2HKOed by a +2 Ice Beam and OHKOed when Slowbro is at +6. Ice Beam's freeze chance might also save you in a pinch and could make a difference against another Slowbro or Amnesia Snorlax. Ice Beam, however, should only be used over Thunder Wave, because the STAB move is necessary to 2HKO Chansey and Starmie. Withdraw has the same goal as Reflect, with the difference that it can maximize Slowbro's Defense, but requires two turns to reach Reflect's potential. Reflect will generally turn out to be more useful and safer. Withdraw's high PP will let Slowbro outstall other Slowbro, however. Counter can surprise common Slowbro switch-ins like Starmie if you switch into a Body Slam from a physical attacker and scare it out, or if you predict a Hyper Beam. Counter has hardly any other uses other than these though because Slowbro generally only takes physical attacks when it's asleep, excluding Explosion. Disable is a funny option that can prevent some Pokemon from Thunderbolting Slowbro for some time, but it's very unreliable and shouldn't really be used.</p> <p>Slowbro can also be used as a lead with a set of Thunder Wave, Amnesia, Surf, and Fire Blast or Blizzard. This set is incredibly vulnerable to sleep leads such as Jynx, Exeggutor, Gengar, and Sing Chansey; however, when it finds itself against other Thunder Wave leads, namely Alakazam and Starmie, its ability to boost up with Amnesia and pump out damage with +2 coverage moves is remarkable. It still struggles in doing significant damage if the opponent has Thunderbolt Chansey or Starmie anywhere on their team, and due to its lack of recovery it is incredibly easy to wear down and incredibly vulnerable to full paralysis, so this set is not recommended.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage</strong>: The higher the user's critical hit ratio and the number of turns it can resist Slowbro's Surf, the better. Starmie is a good choice, having a very high Speed and thus a high critical hit ratio, while also resisting all of Slowbro's moves. It's not a surefire counter though, and in case Starmie prevails, it won't like having to eat a Thunder Wave. Gengar makes a good choice too, having a high critical hit ratio and being able to Explode for around 50% damage when it's about to be KOed. However, it doesn't resist Surf and is weak to Psychic. Zapdos and Jolteon have the luxury of getting STAB in their Electric-type attacks; even when Slowbro is at +6, their Thunderbolts will still do significant damage. They also have a high critical hit ratio, but like Gengar, they don't resist Surf, and, unlike Gengar, can't Explode.</p> <p><strong>Explosion users</strong>: Explosion makes a very viable choice for taking Slowbro down when you have no other option. No user can OHKO a healthy Slowbro, but many put it in the KO range of Tauros's Hyper Beam or Rhydon's Earthquake. Pokemon with Explosion or Self-Destruct include Exeggutor, Snorlax, Golem, Cloyster, and Gengar, although Gengar's Explosion is weaker. A Resting Slowbro that gets Exploded on is pretty much a dead Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Amnesia Snorlax will often defeat Slowbro, as its Body Slam is an almost guaranteed 4HKO while Slowbro's Surf only manages a 5HKO when both are at +6. Due to the Speed tie, a 4HKO could turn into a 3HKO, depending on who goes first the turn Slowbro uses Rest. If Snorlax is packing Thunderbolt instead, it will fare even better, 3HKOing Slowbro after both have set up. As far as the physical side goes, Rhydon makes a surprisingly viable option, although risky as well; it has to switch in when Slowbro uses Rest, and then try to 3HKO it with its STAB Earthquake, which will happen around 75-80% of the time. Tauros needs a critical hit Body Slam to get the chance to 3HKO it after finishing it off with a Hyper Beam. If Tauros gets paralyzed, though, you can pretty much forget about beating Slowbro. Snorlax's critical hit ratio is much smaller than Tauros's, but its Body Slam is almost a guaranteed 4HKO, and has an easier chance if Body Slam paralyzes Slowbro. For instance, if Snorlax moves first while Slowbro tries to use Rest, but moves last on the previous turn that Slowbro Rested, Snorlax beats Slowbro with only Body Slam. Both Tauros and physical Snorlax should really be careful when trying to counter Slowbro and should generally only be sent in when Slowbro is sleeping because they will otherwise fall to previously-boosted Surfs more often than not. If Slowbro's set contains Reflect, though, trying to counter it with physical attacks becomes impractical unless you are willing to sacrifice at least two Exploders. In this case, however, any unparalyzed Thunderbolt user becomes a much more effective check, including the slow ones, such as Chansey and Lapras, which, despite their low critical hit rate, will get more chances to fish for it, as it's much more likely that Slowbro is forced to Rest more often. Chansey and especially Starmie will get the chance to keep using their recovery move until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed, which is when they get the chance to use Thunderbolt. Starmie is much better at doing this because Recover outlasts Surf in terms of PP.</p> <p><strong>Razor Leaf users</strong>: Victreebel and Venusaur are known for having a guaranteed critical hit in their STAB signature move, Razor Leaf. They won't like switching into a Thunder Wave, and could be surprised and OHKOed by a boosted STAB Psychic, but, otherwise, either of the Grass-types can KO Slowbro when it is below 70% or 2HKO it while it is Resting.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen users</strong>: Starmie or Chansey packing Light Screen will completely counter Slowbro unless they get really unlucky with full paralysis. Light Screen is never seen on them, however, as it has no use outside of walling Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: It's worth noting that Slowbro, as a Rest user, is one of those Pokemon that should be attacked whenever given the chance, because when it's Resting, you can apply a much higher and more effective variety of tactics to try to take it down. Exeggutor's Mega Drain and Alakazam and Jynx's Seismic Toss, for instance, may not do enough to kill Slowbro, but will cause some decent damage on it before being forced to switch out, which will force it to Rest earlier than desired.</p>",

        "TobyBro (Amnesia)": {
          "description": "<p>Everybody knows the set, but this doesn't make it less dangerous. Amnesia boosts Slowbro's decent Special, being able to reach the maximum 999 after three Amnesia boosts, letting Slowbro 2HKO Chansey with its STAB Surf at +6. Amnesia, like all boosting moves, also has the great side effect of further reducing the speed of paralyzed enemies, allowing Slowbro to muscle through paralyzed would-be walls a lot more easily. When playing Slowbro, it's really useful to know some significant damage rolls or otherwise have a damage calculator handy. As said, Slowbro has a good chance of 2HKOing Chansey but must be at +6. The same can be said about Starmie, although a 999 Special STAB Surf is a guaranteed 2HKO. On the other hand, Starmie is much more of a problem for Slowbro due to having a much higher critical hit ratio. Beating Tauros is about using Amnesia once and then 2HKOing it with Surf, although a +4 Slowbro stands a good chance of OHKOing Tauros. Snorlax, however, requires Slowbro to use Amnesia twice to get the 2HKO; a +6 Surf almost never OHKOes Snorlax. Zapdos also requires two Amnesia boosts, while Jolteon, like Tauros, is 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Gengar will fall to two +2 Surfs half of the time, so it's generally advised to only use Amnesia once. Exeggutor and Lapras are 3HKOed by a +6 Surf; boosting either twice or three times is the way to go. All these calculations have been made considering that the opposition is at full health, so they may vary depending on the health of the opponent as well as on the situation of the battle itself.</p> <p>Having said that, using Thunder Wave first is almost always a good idea. Slowbro is tied with Snorlax as the slowest Pokemon in the game, so paralyzing Snorlax is also a good idea to guarantee Slowbro is faster than it or to fish for full paralysis. Against common Slowbro switch-ins, such as Starmie, Gengar, or Electric-types, Thunder Wave will have to be used as they switch in, so that you can get a boost before they are able to attack. However, it's generally advised to switch Slowbro back after paralyzing the switch-in to get the chance to move two consecutive times the next time they switch in. This way, you can maximize your chances of KOing said check before they are able to score a deadly critical hit Thunderbolt. Even if Starmie or Chansey paralyze Slowbro back in order to outspeed again, using Thunder Wave yourself first was the best move, because the chances of beating an unparalyzed Chansey and especially Starmie are slim, as they can just keep using Recover or Soft-Boiled until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed and they get a chance to use Thunderbolt. An unparalyzed Starmie can also attempt to PP stall Slowbro out of Surfs as well.</p> <p>Rest is perfectly suited for Slowbro. During the setup, Slowbro generally takes some residual damage and gets paralyzed, but Rest can keep Slowbro healthy and free of status. After maximizing its Special, no special attack can get past Slowbro's Rest without a critical hit, and due to Slowbro's great Defense and lack of exploitable physical weaknesses, it's going to be hard to beat Slowbro from the physical side without Explosion. Tauros, for example, needs a critical hit Body Slam and Hyper Beam to 3HKO Slowbro, which is the only way it has to get past Rest; furthermore, if Tauros gets paralyzed, its chances of beating Slowbro become very small. Snorlax, meanwhile, will generally have to resort to Self-Destruct to take Slowbro down. Rhydon has the luxury of being able to 3HKO Slowbro with its powerful STAB Earthquake most of the time, but will have to switch into the predicted Rest and is OHKOed by even a +0 Surf. As said, Explosion makes a good way to eliminate Slowbro, but an Explosion might not even guarantee that a full health Slowbro goes down or gets revenge killed easily due to Slowbro's already mentioned great Defense. Exeggutor's Explosion, for instance, will only hit Slowbro for around 60%. Lowering Slowbro to around 80% or forcing it to Rest first is the safest way to ensure that one Explosion is enough to let a physical attacker, such as Tauros, Golem, Rhydon, or Persian, to revenge kill it safely.</p> <p>Psychic is a STAB alternative to Surf, and trades 5 extra power for a 30% chance of scoring a Special fall. As far as type effectiveness is concerned, Psychic gains a neutral hit against Lapras and Cloyster and a super effective hit against Gengar and Victreebel, three of which are effective Slowbro checks, but loses the neutral hit against Alakazam as well as the ability to OHKO Golem and Rhydon at +0, needing two Amnesia boosts to OHKO them. Seismic Toss Alakazam, in particular, will have the opportunity to force you to Rest before Slowbro is able to get past it. Psychic's lower PP could also be a problem against users of recovery moves, especially considering that, without Surf, Alakazam will also require more time to take down. It could also be an issue if your opponent keeps using Recover or Soft-Boiled and gets lucky with full paralysis. Having 8 fewer PP could also be significant in an odd Slowbro war.</p> <p>Reflect is a possible alternative to Thunder Wave, as it doesn't change the general concept of the set, but changes the way it works in some way and some of its counters. The first thing to notice is the loss of Thunder Wave, which will be problematic in several match-ups. Unless you can paralyze Starmie with another Pokemon, it will hard counter Slowbro. Other specially based Pokemon, such as Chansey, Lapras, Gengar, and Electric-types will also become more problematic if you can't paralyze them; they will have a higher chance of scoring a critical hit Thunderbolt, as they will move first and avoid possible full paralysis. Lastly, Victreebel and Venusaur will have nothing to worry about a Slowbro lacking Thunder Wave unless its attacking move is Psychic. Letting Victreebel in for free could get especially problematic if it's packing Wrap.</p> <p>The reward of using Reflect comes from the physical side. It almost ensures that none of Snorlax, Golem, and Rhydon will have a chance to take Slowbro down due to their low critical hit rate. Tauros will have a lot of difficulties too, needing two critical hit Body Slams to beat Slowbro while it Rests. Reflect is also great for weakening Explosions, which is one of the most common and \"safe\" ways of getting rid of Slowbro; even Snorlax's Self-Destruct will only manage around 40% damage. Reflect makes double Explosions necessary to lower Slowbro to the point where it can be revenge killed, which, for the opponent, involves sacrificing at least two Pokemon.</p>"

Ground-types such as Dugtrio and Golem regularly come in to attempt punishing it for its poor coverage, which can be exploited by aggressively switching in Ground-type checks like Articuno, Tangela, and Dragonite. Given its low Speed, Magneton is also one of the better ways to punish paralyzed Pokemon.</p> <p>However, Magneton faces a myriad of issues that cause it to be forgone on most teams. Its terribly slow Speed leaves it hard to switch in and susceptible to Wrappers such as Tentacruel, Dragonite, and Pinsir. Its coverage is atrocious, leaving it struggling versus Ground- and Grass-types like Dugtrio, Tangela, Venusaur, and the occasional Golem. While it can act as bait that creates opportunities for Pokemon like Tangela and Articuno, relying constantly on prediction leads to Magneton being inconsistent. Magneton also dislikes paralysis, as it loses its ability to outspeed slower and paralyzed foes. It competes with Electabuzz, which outclasses it in all areas but raw damage, and with Raichu and Electrode, both faster Pokemon with more distinguishing features like Surf or Explosion.</p>",

Thunder Wave gives Magneton a tool to cripple faster Wrappers such as Tentacruel and sweepers such as Persian and Electabuzz. Double-Edge is Magneton's best option for combatting Dugtrio and Grass-types, although its poor Attack stat makes the damage output low, with only a slim chance to 3HKO Dugtrio. Rest grants Magneton greater longevity, with the multitude of Wrappers in the tier granting it chances to burn sleep turns. However, a sleeping Magneton is setup fodder for Agility users, namely Dragonite, Articuno, and Dodrio. Alternatively, Toxic punishes Dugtrio, Tangela, and Golem, with Golem being forced to use Explosion much earlier and take chip damage if repeatedly switched in.</p> <p>Magneton's movepool is rather poor, so its customization options are minimal. Thunder turns many of Thunderbolt's possible KOs into guaranteed ones. However, its poor accuracy makes it inconsistent. Hyper Beam is Magneton's strongest attack versus Kadabra, Venusaur, and Dugtrio, but the recharge turns often leave Magneton in terrible situations. Rest and Toxic could be used together, granting Magneton longevity versus Wrappers. However, this forces you to either decrease the consistency of your paralysis spreading or make Magneton completely toothless versus Dugtrio.</p> <p>Magneton pairs especially well with Dugtrio checks, as it often baits Dugtrio into switching in. Tangela works well with this, taking minimal damage from Earthquake and Rock Slide and threatening back with status or Mega Drain. Pokemon like Dragonite and Articuno can also work well with this strategy. Dragonite can trade with Dugtrio by using Blizzard as Dugtrio uses Toxic to stop a possible AgiliWrap sweep, putting Dugtrio in KO range of Magneton's Double-Edge. Articuno can switch in and set up on the Ground- and Grass-types that Magneton lures, and Magneton threatens Articuno's checks like Vaporeon and Omastar with 2HKOs.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Magneton is the hardest-hitting Electric-type in NU, competing with Electrode for a team slot. Magneton brings a number of advantages over its faster competition; firstly, it deals devastating damage, OHKOing Kingler outright with Thunderbolt and having rolls to OHKO every Water- or Flying-type foe with Thunder. Even neutral targets dislike facing Magneton due to its solid bulk and high damage; tier staples like Clefable and Mr. Mime face a 3HKO, and Magneton can even 2HKO it sometimes with Thunderbolt + Thunder. Charizard fares poorly with a mere 14.7% chance to 2HKO Magneton and a 2.6% chance to OHKO it with a critical hit. Even Moltres, the strongest special attacker in the entire game, can only 2HKO Magneton 20% of the time, and it faces a guaranteed 2HKO in return. Magneton has Thunder Wave as well, allowing it to hobble fast foes like Mr. Mime and Raticate that might otherwise deal with it decently.</p> <p>Of course, Magneton cannot do anything to harm Ground-types, a major matchup flaw that holds it back from prominence. Additionally, despite Magneton's superior offense and bulk, Electrode is generally better regarded than Magneton. Compared to Electrode, Magneton is much slower, failing to outspeed relevant targets like Blastoise, Kingler, Mr. Mime, Raticate, and Charizard, among others. Electrode's Speed and massive critical hit chance often allow it to avoid damage that Magneton cannot, and this critical hit chance also allows it to clean teams off the back of a critical hit OHKO or two. Explosion is also relevant for taking out frail targets like Mr. Mime or dealing significant damage to Nidoking; while both Electric-types are unable to harm Golem, Magneton additionally can't touch Nidoking. Despite this, Magneton can deal a lot of damage against foes like Clefable and Mr. Mime in situations where Electrode might balk at taking paralysis.</p>",

Magneton is actually capable of utilizing Reflect + Rest due to its bulk and ability to spread paralysis, allowing it to potentially stall paralyzed foes like Clefable and Blastoise to recover HP without allowing Swords Dance sweepers safe entry. Since Magneton using Rest will often come by surprise, and the viable Swords Dance users are weak to Thunderbolt, it can usually get away with one Rest against a paralyzed foe. Using Rest without Reflect may allow Magneton to stall an endgame scenario assuming setup sweepers have been dealt with, while Reflect by itself can fend off Clefable, but Magneton will usually want Rest if it has Reflect. Double-Edge is a weak move that can have niche utility in chipping Nidoking for allies to finish off. Toxic is a niche option against Golem when combined with partial trapping from allies like Charizard that can help to wear it down more quickly, but this is inconsistent at best.</p> <p>Magneton can operate best by looking for chances to get in against Clefable, Wigglytuff, and Blastoise to spread paralysis and deal damage. It also exploits paralyzed Water- and Flying-types, forcing the opponent to choose between sacrificing their Pokemon or switching into a painful Thunderbolt. Magneton pairs well with allies that can cover for its horrid matchup into Ground-types, like Seadra and Blastoise. It also aids allies that benefit from paralysis, like Nidoking, Golem, and Kingler. Like most Pokemon, Magneton also enjoys support from Venomoth to remove its checks with Sleep Powder and weaken other foes with Stun Spore; this is particularly nice for Magneton due to its uniquely unwinnable matchups. Venomoth can also run Mega Drain to help weaken or outright defeat Golem, freeing up Magneton to go on the offensive.</p>"

These traits and its amazing Attack stat make for powerful and frequent critical hits; the resulting 19.53% chance makes it a very volatile threat that's difficult for most Pokemon to switch into consistently. Dodrio can further boost its Speed and make up for Speed drops from paralysis through Agility, which has the added bonus of making it more difficult to pin down with Wrap. Its typing is also notable for its immunity to Earthquake and paralysis from Body Slam. These qualities make Dodrio a solid revenge killer and late-game sweeper on offensive teams.</p> <p>However, Dodrio's defenses are extremely poor, making it take heavy damage from even neutral hits and easy to OHKO. Worse still, it lacks coverage moves, leaving it stonewalled by Rock-types like Golem and Omastar.

Substitute can allow Dodrio to take a bigger hit than it should, but it is limited in utility, as it doesn't block status in RBY. It also doesn't play to the hit-and-run playstyle Dodrio should be employing, fails to stop it from being forced out by Rock-types that resist its STAB moves, and makes it easier to revenge kill due to the move's HP cost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Dodrio gets completely walled by Golem and Omastar, as it lacks any attack that can deal even neutral damage. In return, they 2HKO Dodrio with Rock Slide and Blizzard, respectively. For similar reasons, Dodrio struggles to offensively threaten Aerodactyl, though most Aerodactyl sets despise possible paralysis from Body Slam much more than Golem or Omastar.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno's bulk tends to allow it to take enough hits from Dodrio before it OHKOes with Blizzard. In addition, if Articuno uses Agility, Dodrio can't touch it at all unless Blizzard misses.</p> <p><strong>Dewgong and Vaporeon</strong>: Both of these Pokemon beat Dodrio one-on-one but take heavy damage in the process. Dewgong can outright OHKO Dodrio with Blizzard, and Vaporeon can survive a Body Slam and subsequent Hyper Beam to KO Dodrio with Blizzard if it has taken any prior damage, dealing a maximum of 92.2%.</p> <p><strong>Electabuzz and Raichu</strong>: Both of these threats can either paralyze Dodrio or 2HKO it with Thunderbolt; should Dodrio have taken any chip damage, it will be KOed outright. However, neither can switch in safely due to Body Slam's power and paralysis chance. Plus, even if they switch in on Drill Peck, Hyper Beam has a good chance to KO afterwards. Raichu tends to have even more trouble switching in than Electabuzz because it only Speed ties Dodrio, making the matchup very inconsistent.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite takes Body Slam and Drill Peck very well at full health, unless Dodrio lands a critical hit, and can then paralyze it with Thunder Wave.</p>",

Drill Peck complements this excellently, 2HKOing Haunter, Tangela, and Venusaur, though in Tangela's case Dodrio may have to take Stun Spore to KO it. Dodrio's Hyper Beam is extremely strong, KOing even bulkier threats like Tentacruel and Hypno after a Body Slam on the switch. Finally, Agility is put in the last slot to allow Dodrio to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Should it be forced to take paralysis, Dodrio can also use Agility to ignore the Speed drop from it.</p> <p>Dodrio, as mentioned before, is extremely frail and dislikes paralysis, so it shouldn't be brought into a game early except as a lead. Lead Dodrio can be used to threaten Tentacruel and Kadabra right out of the gate, usually putting them into range for Dugtrio to KO them after Dodrio goes down. This can be huge, as Pokemon like Tentacruel and Hypno otherwise put immense pressure on teams throughout a game. However, this often means sacrificing Dodrio, which may not be favorable in the long-term. Generally, outside of the lead slot, Dodrio should play a hit-and-run playstyle before cleaning up late-game. Dodrio's two main points of entry are opposing Earthquakes and revenge killing. Its Hyper Beam is notably likely to finish off threats dented by a teammate's Explosion. Dodrio's immunity to Earthquake is especially helpful for double-switching out to Electric-types, reducing risk, and maintaining momentum. This immunity can also be utilized alongside Haunter, with its immunity to Normal-type attacks forming a small immunity core. However, repeatedly switching between them can lead to an early KO with a good prediction from the opponent. Dodrio is also good for taking advantage of threats in a passive state, such as foes using Rest, where it can set up with Agility, outspeed every Pokemon in the tier, and tear the opposing team apart with its immediate offensive presence. Furthermore, Dodrio can set up against Dugtrio or weakened physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Persian, as it forces them out with its powerful offensive capabilities. On top of that, forcing these attackers out isn't even required, as Dodrio will gladly take a hit if it means KOing the opposing Pokemon and potentially ending the game outright.</p>"

Additionally, other Water-types with more diverse movepools, like Tentacruel and Poliwrath, also give Dewgong some competition.</p> <p>The two main features that make Dewgong notable are its Ice typing and superior Speed relative to other Water-type Pokemon. Being an Ice-type gifts Dewgong an impressively strong STAB-boosted Blizzard. Despite Dewgong having lower Special than its closest competitors, its Blizzard tends to deal more damage than anything they can throw out. Just a few significant calculations include a possible 3HKO against Hypno, a very likely 3HKO against Gyarados, a 2HKO on Kangaskhan, and a guaranteed OHKO against Dodrio and Dragonite. The Ice type also improves some of Dewgong’s specific matchups. Most notably, Dewgong is the hardest Articuno counter available, as it is uniquely 4x resistant to Blizzard, cannot be frozen, and forces Articuno to take heavy recoil damage over time from using Double-Edge. Dewgong’s Speed is a relevant advantage primarily because Dewgong is able to outspeed and pressure Hypno, which other Water-type Pokemon may struggle with. The Speed and freeze immunity also help Dewgong when it faces other bulky Water-type Pokemon, namely Vaporeon.</p> <p>Despite these advantages, Dewgong is held back simply because its bulk is not as good as that of Vaporeon and Omastar. Poliwrath also largely surpasses it in physical bulk. Dewgong’s matchups against stronger attackers, both physical and special, simply do not compare to its competitors. As an example, Electabuzz will always 2HKO Dewgong with Thunderbolt but can only 3HKO Vaporeon. Dewgong does not have the longevity it needs; thus, it exists mainly as a niche pick, filling slots only on teams that truly demand its particular blend of strengths and can afford its shortcomings.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dewgong lacks significant other options. It has other physical options like Headbutt and Hyper Beam, the former of which may be useful on teams focused on spreading paralysis, but it lacks the offensive presence to take full advantage of these moves. Other Pokemon, like Poliwrath, have much better physical attacks at their disposal and the Attack stat to back them up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Thunderbolt</strong>: While every major Thunderbolt user in the tier is 3HKOed or better by Blizzard, Dewgong would prefer to avoid the interaction if it can. Electabuzz and Raichu claim 2HKOs with Thunderbolt and boast high critical hit ratios to make the move even scarier. Gyarados and Haunter can consistently 3HKO Dewgong, allowing them to easily revenge kill Dewgong or KO it while it is asleep. While it has no business switching in, Dragonite can also finish off a weakened Dewgong with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Rock- and Fighting-type Moves</strong>: Dewgong’s weakness to Rock-type moves is a small but noticeable disadvantage when comparing it to other Water-type Pokemon. While neither is likely to win a clean head-to-head interaction with Dewgong, Kangaskhan and Golem claim a possible 3HKO and guaranteed 2HKO, respectively, with Rock Slide. Dewgong also has more trouble switching into Dugtrio, as both Earthquake and Rock Slide deal significant damage. Fighting-type Pokemon and moves are very rare in RBY UU, but they still can give Dewgong some trouble when they appear. Poliwrath that carry Submission are the most notable threat, as they have an 87.1% chance to 2HKO Dewgong while taking very little from all of Dewgong’s moves.</p> <p><strong>Partial-trapping Damage</strong>: Due to its largely inferior bulk, Dewgong does not stomach chip damage, especially from Wrap, very well. Tentacruel and even Dragonite can use Wrap to gradually whittle down Dewgong’s health and quickly put it into range of most fast attackers. Dewgong is worse at taking Wrap and hoping for a miss than Vaporeon and especially Omastar. While Fire Spin is not particularly common, it is worth noting that Dewgong does not resist it and is thus not a reliable check to Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur outspeeds Dewgong and can deal over 60% damage with Razor Leaf or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. Blizzard is obviously a frightening prospect for Venusaur, but Venusaur is the best Dewgong revenge killer in the tier and can win one-on-one if necessary.</p>",

        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>STAB Blizzard is one of the main reasons to use Dewgong. It is Dewgong’s strongest attack and deals remarkable damage to most non-resistant targets. Surf can hit a small pool of Pokemon harder than Blizzard and has near-perfect accuracy, which makes it a wise choice to finish off weakened targets. Ice Beam may seem redundant with Blizzard, but it can be useful in matchups against other Water-type Pokemon, for it gives Dewgong the potential to freeze them without wasting precious Blizzard PP. Body Slam is used to help spread paralysis; paralyzing common switch-ins like Tentacruel and Vaporeon can be quite useful long-term. Thanks to Dewgong's slightly higher Attack, its Body Slam also does more damage than that of Vaporeon and Omastar. For reference, the move is likely to 3HKO Kadabra. Finally, Dewgong carries Rest to improve its longevity. While not quite as defensive as others, Dewgong can still attempt to use Rest and subsequently wake up in front of Water- and Ice-type Pokemon. Switching in amidst Wrap turns is another good option to potentially burn sleep turns.</p> <p>Dewgong’s primary role is as a defensive piece. It can work as a mixed wall in a similar fashion to Vaporeon, albeit a frailer one, that can slow down offensive momentum from strong attackers like Dodrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, and, of course, Articuno. Dewgong has some offensive prowess as well. Dewgong is surprisingly good at breaking Hypno, as it outspeeds and can 3HKO with Blizzard. Likewise, most major attackers simply do not want to take STAB Blizzard. Generally, Dewgong is most valuable mid- to late-game. This way, Dewgong’s best matchup can be identified and it can be deployed accordingly. For example, it may be useful to determine if your opponent has an Articuno before you let Dewgong take on a physical attacker or attempt to freeze an opposing Water-type Pokemon.</p>"

However, it is held back by its Poison typing, which grants it no useful resistances alongside weaknesses to the common Earthquake and Psychic, and low Speed, which means it'll almost always move last. To make matters worse, it is dominated by Gastly, which is only 4HKOed by Fire Blast and is immune to Explosion. While teams lacking Gastly may have some trouble playing around it, Muk is too easy to overwhelm with common threats like Nidoqueen, and thus it's recommended that players avoid using this Pokemon.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Body Slam lets Muk threaten switch-ins with paralysis, making it a decent midground option with its okay power, while also dealing decent damage to physically frail Pokemon such as Abra and Staryu. Thunderbolt hits Water-types and Fearow for super effective damage, notably letting Muk beat Omanyte. Fire Blast 2HKOes Pinsir while threatening Grass-types such as Vileplume and potentially burning physical attackers. It is also Muk's strongest attack against Gastly. Alternatively, Hyper Beam lets Muk OHKO Abra, meaning it need not use Explosion to KO Abra. Explosion is Muk's most powerful attack, OHKOing common threats like Fearow and Rapidash, and it deals a minimum of 72% to Nidoqueen. It also has an 84.6% chance to OHKO Porygon, which is important, since Porygon otherwise stonewalls Muk. However, it must be used carefully, as opposing Gastly, Omanyte, and Graveler can easily switch in and sponge the attack. Alternatively, the opposing player can sacrifice a weakened foe, which stops Muk from removing a crucial piece of their team.</p> <p>Mega Drain is an option to threaten Graveler, though it only 2HKOing 40.7% of the time means Muk still risks losing one-on-one. It also lets Muk beat Omanyte if it forgoes Thunderbolt. Acid Armor can let Muk survive more hits from physical attackers, especially if it uses it while they switch in, though Fearow can easily bypass Muk's boosts with its high critical hit rate, and Pinsir's Slash will always do so.</p> <p>Given that it can switch into all of Muk's moves, even Explosion, Gastly is Muk's worst enemy. Thus, Abra and Drowzee are recommended partners. Drowzee has the added benefit of checking opposing Abra, which also gives Muk a considerable amount of trouble. Graveler doesn't fear anything from Muk besides Mega Drain, so Porygon is a good partner. Earthquake users in Machamp and Nidoqueen can outspeed and 2HKO Muk, so checks to them, like Fearow for the former and one's own Machamp for the latter, can be good to handle these threats for Muk.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>The nerf to partial trapping in Stadium OU hits Cloyster quite hard, as Clamp is one of its most important tools in standard OU. Despite this, Cloyster is able to carve out a niche for itself thanks to its high Defense and immunity to freeze, allowing it to wall most common Snorlax sets. Stadium's nerf to Hyper Beam and revamped critical hit rates also make Cloyster more effective at checking Tauros. Cloyster also still has access to a powerful Explosion as well as Ice-type STAB moves that threaten freeze on foes.</p> <p>Despite its robust defenses, Cloyster can get into trouble if luck does not go its way. Snorlax has a high critical hit rate in Stadium OU at 10.3%, and critical hits and full paralysis can break through Cloyster's Rest loop. Compared to Snorlax, Tauros has a higher critical hit rate at 18.1%, but Cloyster will only be hit twice before it wakes up due to Tauros being faster. Snorlax and Tauros can both use Thunderbolt to catch Cloyster off guard, making it a much less effective wall. Additionally, Cloyster is weak against other tier staples such as Starmie, Chansey, Zapdos, and Persian. The changes to Substitute's mechanics also makes Cloyster's Explosion riskier, as using Explosion on a Substitute will now knock Cloyster out. Overall, Cloyster has a strong niche in the metagame as a physical wall, but its flaws keep it from being among the top threats.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Despite the nerf, Clamp can still be used on Cloyster as a pivot tool and a means to chip down paralyzed and slower foes. However, Clamp no longer doing damage as a Pokemon switches in heavily reduces the effectiveness of the move. Cloyster can use Substitute or Reflect to improve its resilience against Tauros and Snorlax. Reflect makes it much harder for the Normal-types to break through Cloyster, while Body Slam cannot break a Substitute. However, dropping an attacking move will give Cloyster PP issues, and dropping Explosion will make Cloyster very passive. Double-Edge can be used to try to break through Chansey and paralyzed Psychic-types, but the recoil hinders Cloyster's defensive capabilities, and it generally wants to switch out of these foes, since it takes heavy damage in return. Cloyster can also use Bubble Beam over Surf for more PP and a chance to slow down a foe, since Cloyster outspeeds every relevant Pokemon except for Jolteon at -1 Speed. However, Bubble Beam's lower damage output is noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Starmie switches into all of Cloyster's non-Explosion attacks with ease and 2HKOes it in return with Thunderbolt. Starmie can also safely click Recover on Cloyster, and it always survives Explosion from full health, taking a maximum of 96.9%. However, an unparalyzed Starmie can be ruined by an Ice Beam freeze. Slowbro also switches into Cloyster and can set up Amnesia in front of it. At +4 Special, Surf almost always 2HKOes it, preventing Cloyster from Rest looping. Opposing Cloyster can switch in safely and is immune to freeze, and Lapras can also switch in and threatens Cloyster with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Alakazam</strong>: Chansey and Alakazam are both capable of switching into Cloyster and healing any damage they take with their instant recovery moves. Chansey 2HKOes Cloyster with Thunderbolt, while Alakazam 3HKOes it with Psychic. However, both must watch out for Explosion, as Alakazam is outright OHKOed by it, and Chansey gets OHKOed 74.4% of the time.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hits</strong>: Cloyster relies on Rest looping Tauros and Snorlax to wall them effectively, allowing them to break through with critical hits.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Jolteon deal massive damage to Cloyster with Thunderbolt , doing a minimum of 88.1% and 80.8%, respectively. Zapdos cannot switch directly into Cloyster due to the threat of an Ice-type attack, so it is better off revenge killing it or switching in when Cloyster uses Rest. Jolteon's lack of an Ice weakness means it can switch in better than Zapdos can.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types with Thunderbolt</strong>: Although Cloyster checks standard Snorlax and Tauros sets, both can equip Thunderbolt to catch Cloyster off guard. Both Tauros and Persian 3HKO Cloyster with Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt on Snorlax is typically seen on Amnesia sets, and a +4 Thunderbolt OHKOes Cloyster.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar switches into Cloyster's attacks relatively safely, taking a maximum of 28.7% from Ice Beam and 35.6% from Blizzard. Gengar threatens a 2HKO with Thunderbolt. It is also immune to Cloyster's Explosion, a huge advantage it has over Cloyster's other checks. However, it has no way to recover HP outside of Rest.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Cloyster most often runs two Ice-type attacks in Ice Beam and Blizzard. Ice Beam's greater PP and accuracy make it better at freeze fishing, while Blizzard's extra power gets important KO ranges, such as a 2HKO on Exeggutor. These moves' freeze chance mean switching in an unparalyzed Starmie or Chansey is never truly safe. Surf is able to hit the rare Jynx, and it has more PP than Blizzard, which can be useful in longer games. However, forgoing Surf doesn't give Cloyster many coverage issues, since the two most viable Ice-resistant Pokemon—Starmie and Slowbro—also resist Surf. Rest is essential to Cloyster's function as a wall, as it gives Cloyster longevity against foes such as Tauros and Snorlax. Explosion lets Cloyster remove or heavily damage a foe and prevents it from being completely passive against Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam. However, Cloyster must watch out for Substitute, as using Explosion on a Substitute will KO Cloyster.</p> <p>Cloyster's best teammates are those that appreciate its walling capabilities and can fill in any defensive holes Cloyster creates. Chansey is a great partner for Cloyster, since it can switch into special attackers such as Starmie and Alakazam that force Cloyster out, while Cloyster can check Tauros and Snorlax. Rhydon is also a good teammate, as it switches into Zapdos and Jolteon with ease, while Cloyster can switch into Blizzard from Tauros. One physical attacker that gives Cloyster trouble is Persian, since Thunderbolt 3HKOes it, and even if Persian drops Thunderbolt, Slash 4HKOes it. For this reason, Gengar can be a helpful teammate thanks to its great Persian matchup. Gengar is also useful for forcing opposing Tauros and Snorlax to use Earthquake, a move that Cloyster can switch into more safely than Body Slam. Cloyster's ability to lure in and use Explosion on Starmie and Chansey makes Amnesia Snorlax and Slowbro more effective, as breaking through these special walls is one of their biggest hurdles.</p>"

Its Ice typing gives it a powerful STAB Blizzard as well as an immunity to freeze. It also has access to the mighty Explosion, a potent tool in Ubers, and its signature move Clamp can choke down slower foes and provide free switches for its teammates.</p> <p>However, Cloyster is weighed down by multiple detrimental traits that prevent it from being a true oppressive force in Ubers. Its matchup into unparalyzed Mewtwo is horrendous, only 5HKOing it with Blizzard while being 2HKOed by Psychic and Thunderbolt in return, letting Mewtwo switch in with little risk. It can't reliably switch into the physical attackers it wants to tank hits from, as it becomes much worse if it is paralyzed by Body Slam or Thunder Wave. Cloyster also finds it difficult to heal off the damage it takes, as its only way of healing is Rest, which forces it into complete passivity for two turns. Cloyster also relies on heavy paralysis support to effectively use Clamp and Explosion due to its mediocre Speed and weakness to special moves.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hyper Beam can be used in place of Rest, as it allows Cloyster to finish off weakened Chansey and Ice-resistant foes. However, this leaves Cloyster completely unable to switch into physical attackers, as paralysis will permanently ruin it. Ice Beam has double the PP of Blizzard and better accuracy. However, it is significantly weaker than Blizzard, failing nearly every important KO range. Although incredibly niche, Reflect can replace Explosion to make Cloyster better into Mew and Snorlax, with Cloyster taking a paltry 30.6% maximum from Mew's +6 Earthquake and only 37.9% maximum from Snorlax's Self-Destruct. However, lacking Explosion leaves Cloyster much less threatening and much easier to answer, and physical attackers will usually just switch to a Water-type or Mewtwo to answer Cloyster, usually rendering Reflect useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Starmie, Slowbro, and Lapras switch into Cloyster with minimal risk and threaten it back with heavy damage or paralysis. However, Slowbro and Starmie have to worry about getting frozen, and all of them take heavy damage from Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outspeeds and 2HKOes Cloyster with Psychic or Thunderbolt, while it's only 5HKOed in return by Blizzard, though it must be wary of being frozen. Mewtwo becomes much worse at switching into Cloyster if it's paralyzed, as Cloyster can choke it down or pivot to a teammate with Clamp; it can also do heavy damage to it with Explosion while also preventing Recover that turn.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Cloyster despises paralysis, as it relies on its Speed and cannot afford to lose turns to full paralysis. Paralysis also makes Cloyster's chance of hitting Clamp a mere 56.25%. Cloyster's only means of removing paralysis is Rest, which is difficult to pull off successfully. This makes switching into Body Slam extremely risky.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Jolteon both outspeed and 2HKO Cloyster with Thunderbolt, with Zapdos even having a 23.1% chance to OHKO it. However, the former is 2HKOed by Blizzard and the latter is 3HKOed, so they cannot switch into Cloyster well.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can switch into Cloyster with ease, taking a mere 18.9% maximum from Blizzard and threatening it with paralysis and a 4HKO from Seismic Toss. However, Chansey has to be wary freeze as well as Explosion, as it is OHKOed by the move 74.4% of the time. Chansey is also quite passive and cannot do much to threaten Cloyster's team beyond using Thunder Wave. Cloyster can also choose to pivot out with Clamp, which denies Chansey the chance to recover HP or paralyze anything and can result in it slowly getting worn down over time.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Gengar cannot switch into Cloyster's Blizzard well, as it is 3HKOed 30.8% of the time, it 2HKOes Cloyster with Thunderbolt and can absorb Cloyster's Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx outspeeds Cloyster and 3HKOes it with Psychic, while Cloyster's Blizzard only 6HKOes in return, but Cloyster's Explosion OHKOes Jynx. However, this is often a bad trade for the Cloyster user.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blizzard is Cloyster's primary attacking option, OHKOing Rhydon 33.3% of the time, 2HKOing Exeggutor and Zapdos, and 3HKOing Tauros. Clamp can provide free switches for Cloyster's teammates. It can also be used to whittle down slower foes into KO range from another attack, but this is unreliable due to its poor accuracy. Explosion allows Cloyster to take out or do heavy damage to a foe, OHKOing frailer foes such as Alakazam and Chansey 74.4% of the time and doing a hefty chunk to bulkier foes, such as doing 60% minimum to Snorlax and 62.1% minimum to Mewtwo. Explosion also has the benefit of prematurely ending the turn, which can deny recovery on slower foes. Rest increases Cloyster's longevity and clears paralysis, but it is left completely helpless for two turns and cannot regain its Speed until it switches out, allowing Pokemon that threaten it, such as Mewtwo, Starmie, and Zapdos, to switch in and fire off strong attacks or set up.</p> <p>Cloyster necessitates paralysis support to function, so Thunder Wave Mewtwo and Mew make great partners, as they can spread paralysis across the opposing team, particularly to the opposing Mewtwo and Mew. Chansey is also good at spreading paralysis to support Cloyster, and it is a good switch-in to the special attackers Cloyster is afraid of, such as Mewtwo, Starmie, and Alakazam. Rhydon can make a good teammate, as it walls Zapdos and Jolteon, which both threaten Cloyster immensely; Cloyster also switches into Tauros's Earthquake and Blizzard well to support Rhydon. Rhydon—much like Cloyster—also benefits heavily from spreading paralysis across the opposing team. Cloyster can be paired with other Explosion and Self-Destruct users such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, Explosion Mew, and Self-Destruct Mewtwo to attempt to overwhelm the opponent and trade down Pokemon until a strong sweeper, such as Zapdos or Tauros, can win the game. Cloyster should be kept hidden until the opponent's Mewtwo is paralyzed, as once it is, Cloyster becomes far more offensively threatening. Cloyster should only use Rest if it absolutely needs to, as waking up is incredibly difficult.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Cloyster is a Pokemon with coverage limited to STAB moves and Normal-type attacks, yet despite this, it has access to one of the most diverse toolsets in RBY OU. Through the use of Clamp, Cloyster can provide free switches to its teammates while also walling some of the most prominent physical threats, such as Snorlax, particularly those running Reflect, and Tauros. It possesses a reasonably powerful Blizzard, with the ability to threaten freeze on special walls, and has the option of using Explosion on Starmie to set up a Rhydon or Tauros sweep. Its part-Ice typing gives it immunity to freeze and STAB on Blizzard, at the expense of being weaker to Rock Slide. However, Cloyster has some drawbacks that stop it from being one of the top threats of RBY OU. Firstly, not being a Normal-type means it can be paralyzed by Body Slam, unlike Chansey or Snorlax. Secondly, Clamp's subpar accuracy could prove deadly to Cloyster's pretensions, especially if it's paralyzed. Lastly, it needs to rely on Rest as means of recovery, which means it's going to remain completely passive for three turns whenever it wants to recover HP.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>The options listed give Cloyster the best tools to perform its roles effectively, so other options should generally not be considered. Reflect could be used in place of Clamp or Explosion to wall Normal-types even more reliably, but Cloyster loses on one of its key supporting roles when doing so and the extra bulk is generally not needed. Ice Beam is an option, though the drop in power is noticeable; most notably, Snorlax is 4HKOed instead of 3HKOed with Blizzard, but the added PP can come in handy in longer games where neither player manages to break the opponent. Toxic, when combined with Clamp, can allow Cloyster to wear down the special walls that usually threaten it with higher degrees of efficiency; however, it's difficult to justify making space for it when all of Cloyster's default moves are so valuable. Paralysis is generally very efficient at enabling Clamp chains and already present on virtually every RBY team anyway.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Starmie is the premier Cloyster counter; it takes virtually no damage from Clamp or Blizzard and is able to Recover any damage done effortlessly. It can also cripple Cloyster with Thunder Wave or do heavy damage to it with Thunderbolt or Psychic. However, it must watch out for Explosion, as it can be KOed if not at full health. Lapras or an opposing Cloyster can also completely shrug off Cloyster's attacks, and the former can threaten a powerful Thunderbolt or even Sing. It should be noted that if these Water-types are paralyzed they struggle considerably more, as Cloyster will now be faster, allowing it to use Clamp and switch out safely, with the only danger being the unlikely case of a Clamp miss coupled with lack of full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey and Alakazam can also shrug off Blizzard relatively easily thanks to their high Special bulk and easy, accessible recovery; however, if they are paralyzed, Cloyster has the option to partial trap them with Clamp to deny their recovery and switch out freely. They are also very vulnerable to Explosion, meaning that they have to tread carefully when attempting to take on Cloyster.</p> <p><strong>Electric types</strong>: Electric-types such as Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed and 2HKO Cloyster, with the latter having a small chance to OHKO. They must be wary of switching in, though, as Blizzard threatens significant damage, especially to Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can switch in on Cloyster with impunity, cripple it with Thunder Wave, and start setting up on it. If it's carrying Reflect, it's even worse, as Cloyster does a measly 30% to it with Explosion after Reflect has been set up. Slowbro is even more dangerous for Cloyster if it's packing Psychic; a +4 Psychic is already more than 50% likely to OHKO Cloyster. Thus, Cloyster is forced to use Clamp and then switch out as soon as Slowbro enters the field. This is risky and predictable due to the low accuracy and imminent threat that Slowbro poses.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Tauros</strong>: If Tauros chooses to run the rare Thunderbolt instead of the standard Earthquake, it can lure in Cloyster and seriously cripple it, especially if Cloyster is already caught in Rest cycles or suffers a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel Speed ties with Cloyster and can do at least 85% damage with Razor Leaf. However, it's a shaky check at best, as it's also 2HKOed by Cloyster's Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Though it does not particularly enjoy switching into Blizzards, Gengar does not suffer Clamp much, outspeeds Cloyster, and threatens a 2HKO with Thunderbolt. It is also able to completely nullify Explosion, though this is reliant on prediction.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx enjoys switching into Cloyster's attacks and threatening it with Psychic. It is faster, making it a good switch-in to Clamp, and can use Cloyster's weaker attacks to its advantage to wake up after a Rest.</p>",

Blizzard is Cloyster's best attacking option, a powerful STAB move that only Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Starmie and Lapras or special walls such as Chansey and Alakazam can handle; it also has a possibility of scoring a freeze. Explosion allows Cloyster to act as a wallbreaker once its support capabilities are no longer needed, blowing up on a Pokemon such as Starmie or Chansey and allowing a sweeper to perform its job more easily. For the third move, Rest is the the most common option by far, as it allows Cloyster to perform its walling duties much more easily. However, Hyper Beam can also be used if the team favors the possibility of doing extra damage to Chansey. It is also the best option on dedicated Wrap teams, since they can't afford to lose any momentum, but those teams tend to be inconsistent and are thus rarely seen.</p> <p>Cloyster provides unique utility to RBY teams in that it provides the user with a sturdy Tauros answer, something that very few other Pokemon in the tier can do. Therefore, despite being an excellent Pokemon to lure in and KO walls like Starmie and Chansey through Explosion, it is often best to preserve Cloyster for the later stages, until the opposing Tauros has been crippled enough for Cloyster's defensive prowess to be superfluous. However, Cloyster is not simply a late-game Tauros answer; its positive matchup against Snorlax also gives it plenty of positional utility in the early stages, especially when combined with Clamp to gain free and safe switches. Managing Cloyster's health demands making many tricky decisions: switching in on Snorlax or using Explosion on Chansey early on may seem like great propositions, but they will weaken your team against the opponent's Tauros, so it is necessary to think about your long-term plans whenever you expose Cloyster to danger.</p>"

    "pu": {
      "outdated": true,
      "overview": "<p>Gastly is one of the most defining Pokemon in the PU metagame, being the fastest viable sleeper in the tier. Gastly is threatening even aside from sleep thanks to its high Special and combination of Psychic and Thunderbolt, which has perfect coverage and hits top threats such as Fearow and Nidoqueen super effectively. Gastly also has Explosion to deny setup sweepers and put many foes into KO range from Gastly's teammates. These traits make Gastly a powerhouse in the back, as it can put most foes to sleep and then threaten switch-ins with powerful attacks. Gastly can also switch into Normal-type moves such as Scyther's Slash and Arcanine's Hyper Beam without taking damage, something no other Pokemon in the tier can do. Gastly is also one of PU's best Seaking switch-ins, as it is only 3HKOed by Surf and can generate momentum for its team with the threat of Hypnosis and Thunderbolt, which lets it switch in once per game with minimal concern. However, Gastly is not flawless. Despite its unique defensive capabilities, it still suffers from bad physical bulk and a weak Poison typing. Its terrible physical bulk allows most neutral physical attacks such as Fearow's Drill Peck to 2HKO it. Additionally, Gastly's terrible Ground- and Psychic-type weaknesses leave it OHKOed and 2HKOed, respectively, by most common Earthquake and Psychic in the tier from the likes of Nidoqueen and Gastly. These issues are compounded by Gastly's reliance on the inaccurate Hypnosis, as a miss could mean Gastly faints without doing anything.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Night Shade can be used as a midground option to deal consistent damage to Gastly's switch-ins. It is also Gastly's strongest attack against Psychic- and Fire- types, though Explosion and Psychic are usually better moves against Psychic- and Fire-types, respectively. The utility of Gastly's other attacking moves are also generally superior, and Psychic is already a consistent midground option. Psychic also has the chance to drop the opponent's Special and land a critical hit, which Night Shade cannot do. Gastly can be used as a lead, as it outspeeds lead Porygon and Nidoqueen and is 3HKOed by Arcanine's Fire Blast, which always gives it at least one opportunity to use Hypnosis; Arcanine'sFire Blast puts Gastly into KO range of Fearow's Drill Peck, however, meaning it is easily revenge killed. Given Hypnosis's poor accuracy and Gastly's inability to substantially threaten these foes outside of Hypnosis, lead Gastly is extremely inconsistent.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Faster Attackers:</strong> Fearow, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar all outspeed Gastly. Fearow 2HKOes Gastly with Drill Peck and is only 2HKOed in return by Thunderbolt, while Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar 3HKO Gastly and comfortably take any damage it can throw out in return. These Fire-types can also burn Gastly, making its already middling Explosion even weaker. Magmar deserves a special mention, as it has access to Psychic, which 2HKOes Gastly after a Special drop and isn't prone to missing, unlike Rapidash and Arcanine's Fire Blast. Rapidash can also use Fire Spin to chip Gastly into KO range and can be used to pivot around it. However, these Pokemon must be wary of Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types:</strong> Although both are uncommon, Abra and Drowzee 2HKO Gastly with Psychic and can cripple it with Thunder Wave. The former outspeeds Gastly and is only 3HKOed by Night Shade, while the latter is only 4HKOed; both take negligible damage from Gastly's other attacks. However, both must watch out for Explosion, which OHKOes Abra and does a minimum of 67% to Drowzee. Due to it being outsped, Drowzee must be wary of Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Magneton:</strong> Thanks to its high Special and good bulk, Magneton can switch into Gastly's attacks, taking only 22.4% at maximum from Psychic, and threaten it back with Thunder Wave and a strong STAB Thunderbolt, which has a 19.2% chance to 2HKO. However, Magneton must be wary of Psychic Special drops and Explosion. Magneton is also slower than Gastly, meaning it is susceptible to Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users:</strong> Even if Gastly can threaten Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Machamp, and Graveler with Psychic, these foes can tank a hit and OHKO Gastly in return with Earthquake. However, there is no viable Earthquake user in PU that is faster than Gastly, so the majority of them must be wary of Hypnosis and being in Gastly's KO range.</p>",

        "Offensive Sleeper": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Hypnosis is one of Gastly's most powerful tools, as its good Speed stat allows it to outspeed and put foes such as Seaking and Porygon to sleep. However, Gastly usually does not want to risk trying to land Hypnosis against foes that can KO it if it misses, such as Nidoqueen. Gastly will only want to use Hypnosis against these foes if it needs to put them to sleep to win later in the game, such as if it needs to beat Fearow Nidoqueen one-on-one, or if it can't afford to take too much damage against certain foes, such as Magneton. If Gastly can afford to, it will much rather just attack rather than try to land Hypnosis, as attacking is far more consistent due to Gastly being too frail to be able to afford to fumble a turn without doing anything, as if it misses, it can end up achieving nothing. Psychic hits Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and opposing Gastly super effectively. Its high chance to inflict a Special drop on the opponent also makes it Gastly's best move against Fire-types and neutral targets. Thunderbolt deals super effective damage to Flying- and Water-types, 2HKOing Fearow, Scyther, and Staryu and 3HKOes Seaking. Substitute enables Gastly to become even more threatening offensively after landing Hypnosis, punishing opponents that stay in to attempt to wake up or sacrifice whatever has been put to sleep. Substitute also has the benefit of the fact that very few Pokemon have access to paralysis-spreading moves, letting Gastly be completely safe behind a Substitute. Explosion lets Gastly sacrifice itself to put a frailer foe into range of a strong revenge killer such as Fearow or Scyther. Explosion comes with the benefit of ending the turn, preventing slower foes such as Porygon and Seaking from healing or setting up. It also allows for win-win scenarios when paired with Hypnosis, as Gastly can explode in front of a sleeping foe to either give its teammates such as Scyther or Seaking free setup turns if the opponent stays in, or if they switch, Explosion will heavily chip whatever has switched in.</p> <p>Gastly's main role in a team is as a sleeper and Seaking check; it can put a key foe to sleep to clear the way for its teammates while remaining offensively potent even after landing Hypnosis. Gastly can also switch in to Seaking's Surf once and threaten it with Hypnosis and Thunderbolt or use Explosion on it to deny the chance for it to set up an Agility. Gastly can also switch into Scyther with little risk, as it is immune to its Normal-type coverage and is only 4HKOed by Wing Attack while it threatens Scyther in return with Hypnosis and a 2HKO from Thunderbolt; however, Gastly must be wary of Scyther using Swords Dance on the turn it switches in, as a boosted Scyther 2HKOes it with Wing Attack, forcing Gastly to either attempt to land Hypnosis or fish for a critical hit with Thunderbolt. Gastly tends to get overwhelmed by faster threats, so it appreciates partners that can switch into them; Omanyte and Graveler check Rapidash, Fearow, and Arcanine. Gastly is also checked by Graveler and Drowzee and thus enjoys the support of wallbreakers such as Seaking and Arcanine. Gastly's combination of high Special and immunity to Body Slam makes it the best switch-in to Omanyte, making it a great partner to Rapidash and Arcanine. Gastly's good Seaking matchup also makes it a good teammate for these Pokemon.</p>"

  "Haunter": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Haunter is generally considered good in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Haunter is the sole viable Ghost-type in RBY UU and has some fairly unique traits that make it a solid threat in the tier. For starters, Haunter is the fastest sleep inducer in the tier, which lets it work as a lead or early-game threat and gives it ample opportunity to disable a threat for what could be the rest of the game. This Speed also allows it to outrun threats like Articuno and Gyarados while leaving sizable dents in their bulk. Its immunity to Normal-type attacks makes it a solid Persian check and decent counterplay to Wrap in the form of PP stall. PP stalling Wrap works especially well if Haunter is paired with Pokemon like Omastar and Golem, as they resist it. Haunter's Poison typing also comes into play here, as being immune to Toxic means it can't take poison damage during Wrap chains from threats like Dragonite. In addition to this, its Poison typing grants it a valuable role as a check to Venusaur and Tangela, being merely 5HKOed by Razor Leaf and taking minimal damage from Mega Drain. Haunter has a workable special movepool as well, with options such as Thunderbolt and Psychic making it fairly flexible. The prized Thunderbolt is of particular note, allowing Haunter to act as a pseudo-Electric-type for a team, breaking through the powerful bulky Water-types of the tier. Overall, Haunter works well as a defensive pivot but can go on the offense just fine as well.</p> <p>However, Haunter is extremely frail on the physical side, which can be heavily exploited through its weakness to Earthquake. Prominent physical attackers such as Dugtrio and Kangaskhan carry Earthquake frequently, which can make switching in significantly less safe. In addition, Haunter's Speed is a bit below what's desirable, leaving it slower than the ever-present Tentacruel. Haunter's Speed is further compromised by paralysis, which causes it to be outsped by threats like Kangaskhan and reduces its consistency with Hypnosis.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychic is sometimes used for easing prediction and hitting other Poison-types like opposing Haunter. Outside of that, though, Night Shade and Thunderbolt cover the other threats it would hit. However, the Special drop can be useful for prolonged Tentacruel interactions. Should Thunderbolt's damage not be sufficient, Thunder will usually 2HKO Tentacruel and OHKO Gyarados. Mega Drain can be used to 2HKO Golem attempting to switch in on Explosion, and its recovery gives Haunter a significantly better Omastar matchup. Rest is another interesting option worth using, as it allows Haunter to work as a Dragonite check, burning sleep turns under Wrap and stalling even more Wrap PP.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio is faster than Haunter, immune to Thunderbolt, and OHKOes with Earthquake, making it a premier counter to Haunter. However, it can't switch into Night Shade repeatedly and greatly fears Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Kadabra is a serious threat to Haunter, especially in lead situations. While it's 3HKOed by Night Shade and even OHKOed by Explosion, Haunter is outsped by it and 2HKOed by its Psychic. Generally, the only way Haunter can win is by landing Hypnosis or Explosion. Hypno can 2HKO Haunter using Psychic while taking very little from any move Haunter can throw at it. The only way Haunter can KO Hypno is by using two Night Shades on the switch and then Explosion. It should be noted that Kadabra and Hypno always run Thunder Wave as well, which will cripple Haunter for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem is immune to Thunderbolt, Haunter's main attacking move, and can very easily absorb its Explosion. To make matters worse, Golem's Earthquake is a clean OHKO. However, should Haunter choose to carry Mega Drain, it 2HKOes Golem on the switch while recovering over 70% of its HP.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: While utilizing Haunter's Normal immunity to check Kangaskhan sounds enticing, Kangaskhan’s Earthquake is a 2HKO. Haunter can't win one-on-one, but Kangaskhan dislikes Hypnosis, critical hits, and repeated hits as it switches in, the latter two exploiting its mediocre special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Electabuzz</strong>: Electabuzz often carries Psychic, and, since it takes minimal damage from Thunderbolt, it can safely win the interaction. Should battling Haunter head-on be unfavorable, Electabuzz can paralyze it with Thunder Wave at minimum. However, Haunter can trade with Explosion.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis lets Haunter put foes to sleep right out of the gate, which can essentially be a KO should the right threat be hit. Night Shade 3HKOes Dugtrio, Kadabra, and opposing Haunter, which makes it a bit more difficult for them to switch in and check Haunter repeatedly. Thunderbolt 3HKOes common Water-types like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar. Once Haunter has taken too much damage or has been paralyzed, it can use Explosion to try and take a Pokemon down with it, which notably OHKOes Kadabra and potentially Dugtrio.</p> <p>Haunter can work early-game, sleeping a threat and likely taking out another Pokemon with Thunderbolt or Explosion. Once Haunter has entered the game, it should put a foe to sleep as soon as possible, disabling a part of the opposing team for what could be the rest of the game. However, Haunter isn't strictly relegated to early-game duties, especially because it stops Persian and checks Tentacruel and Agility + Wrap Dragonite. Even though Haunter takes no damage from Wrap against Pokemon like Tentacruel and Dragonite, it is still immobilized. This gives the opponent an opportunity to switch into a strong physical attacker like Dugtrio, which forces Haunter to switch out or get KOed, putting a large amount of strain on the team's defensive integrity. Being immobilized by Wrap isn't inherently bad, though, as the foe loses PP, can't make concrete progress, and gives you an opportunity to predict their switch-in with one of your own. Pairing Haunter with Flying-types like Articuno can create a solid immunity core; Haunter can pivot into Normal-type attacks, and it can switch back to the Flying-type partner if it is threatened by Earthquake, keeping momentum. Once a threat is at around half HP, Explosion can usually take it out, which should be considered when Haunter is on its last sliver of health. Even if Explosion fails to KO, a heavy dent can let threats like Persian and Articuno push the advantage.</p>"

Gengar is better at this, but having Haunter as a backup lets players use Gengar more aggressively and bait and punish an Explosion after Gengar faints. However, most of the time teams don't want two Pokemon that perform essentially the same role and vastly prefer just keeping Gengar around. Additionally, Haunter is very underpowered for STABmons; it struggles to deal meaningful damage to the metagame's plethora of Normal- and Psychic-types, leaving it as a gimmick.</p>",

Thunderbolt, coming off Haunter's good Special, can threaten Water- and Flying-types, such as Starmie and Aerodactyl. Night Shade threatens consistent damage against foes, notably 4HKOing Exeggutor. Despite Haunter's low Attack, Explosion is its strongest move against most foes, letting it do around 50% to targets like Tauros and Exeggutor.</p> <p>Haunter should always be used alongside Gengar, since Gengar is strictly better. Gengar should always be revealed first, as Haunter being revealed will tell the opponent you have Gengar anyway. With Haunter around, Gengar can be used to switch into Normal-types and use Explosion more comfortably. Once Gengar faints, the opponent may reveal a mono-Normal attacker, letting the player use Haunter to wall it. Many Normal-types, like Slash Tauros, drop Earthquake in favor of Glare to help against faster foes and opposing Normal-types, making Haunter a usable partner to Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Starmie, and one's own Tauros. Haunter can wall Exeggutor if it drops Psychic, letting it support Pokemon such as Starmie and Vaporeon. The opponent will also likely use Explosion less carefully with Gengar out of the picture, letting the player gain a lead if they trick the opponent into sacrificing an important Pokemon like Tauros or Exeggutor for nothing. Haunter struggles heavily against Normal-types that run Earthquake, such as Tauros and Kangaskhan, as well as Psychic-types, such as Starmie, Exeggutor, and especially Alakazam. One's own Tauros, Kangaskhan, Starmie, and Exeggutor can check and trade hits with their opposing counterparts, and Explosion users such as Clefable and Dodrio can remove them as well. Since Haunter and Gengar both run Hypnosis, it is recommended to pressure the opponent to sacrifice their slept Pokemon before sending out Haunter, so that it can put another foe to sleep.</p>"

Gengar is also the only relevant Ghost-type, letting it wall Persian after Sleep Clause has been activated, and pivot into strong Normal-type attacks from Snorlax and Tauros to let teammates such as Cloyster, Zapdos, and Snorlax come in more easily. Its typing also lets it catch Explosion from Cloyster, Exeggutor, Snorlax, and opposing Gengar. Its high Special allows it to deal solid damage with Thunderbolt and Ice Punch, and access to Explosion allows it to threaten walls and bulky foes like Chansey and Exeggutor. In addition, its 21.48% critical hit rate makes these offensive tools all the more dangerous.</p> <p>However, Gengar’s Poison typing, mediocre bulk, shaky accuracy with Hypnosis, and lower Speed relative to its threats all prove to be significant flaws that make Gengar somewhat unreliable. Its Poison-type allows Earthquake users and STAB Psychic users to greatly threaten it. Gengar also has reliability concerns as a sleeper, as its frailty combined with Hypnosis's 60% accuracy means it may fail to put a foe to sleep before it is KOed or forced to use Explosion. Tradebacks OU also features more strategies involving early paralysis spreading compared to OU. This also frustrates it, as Gengar's base 110 Speed is one of its greatest strengths, letting it outspeed otherwise much more threatening Pokemon such as Snorlax and Exeggutor.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis is necessary to facilitate Gengar’s role as a sleep inducer. Thunderbolt is Gengar’s primary attack, allowing it to put immense pressure on the Water-types of the tier. Explosion, despite coming off of a poor base 65 Attack stat, still manages to let Gengar remove or cripple threatening foes. It is used to break physically frail Pokemon, such as Jynx and Alakazam, who are usually OHKOed, as well as Chansey with prior chip damage. It can also gain momentum on slower threats such as Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Slowbro, as Snorlax and Slowbro cannot set up or Rest off damage if Gengar uses Explosion, instantly ending the turn. The remaining move is mostly a choice between Ice Punch and Night Shade. Ice Punch can flip matchups against Rhydon and Zapdos while scaring Exeggutor with a 2HKO if one hit is a critical hit or with Ice Punch followed by Explosion, and Ice Punch also threatens to freeze most switch-ins. Night Shade deals consistent damage to everything, mainly hitting Alakazam, which takes minimal damage from Gengar's other moves.</p> <p>Gengar’s unreliability in securing sleep makes a second sleeper strongly recommended, with Sing Chansey and Exeggutor as the most common partners. Gengar can also pair alongside a Snorlax with Lovely Kiss and use Explosion, then Snorlax can put something to sleep after the opponent has sacrificed their sleeping Pokemon. Gengar is most commonly run as a lead. If it can land Hypnosis, it can then be used to pressure Water-types and wall Physical Attackers lacking Earthquake, or it can be used as a sacrifice to the opposing sleep inducer. If Gengar cannot put something to sleep before being forced out, the backup sleep inducer can try to induce sleep later. Gengar's best opportunity to switch in to try to land Hypnosis is against Snorlax. It can either try to switch into an expected Body Slam or against a Snorlax confirmed to not be carrying Earthquake, which is more common than in OU. It can also switch into non-Amnesia Persian variants after a teammate has been put to sleep and get more chances at securing sleep.</p> <p>Psychic is a possible other option for Gengar's moveset as a strong Thunderbolt alternative with the ability to fish for Special drops. It 3HKOes opposing Gengar while hitting Chansey and Snorlax harder, but this leaves Gengar walled by Starmie and Alakazam. Confuse Ray can be used to prevent Chansey from healing and to generally increase the opportunities for luck. Counter can be used to catch switches if Gengar is brought in against something it forces out—for example, Gengar can utilize Counter's damage storing mechanics after a strong Normal-type hit or Explosion KO to inflict massive damage.</p>"

Gengar's Normal immunity carries substantial utility, letting it absorb the plentiful Explosions in the metagame for free and walling Mew and Snorlax sets carrying only Normal-type moves. Additionally, it can come in handy against Persian and Wrap users like Dragonite and Victreebel, though these Pokemon do not see much use. Gengar can use its own Explosion, armed with a fearsome 21.47% critical hit rate, to significantly damage anything that is not Rock- or Ghost-type, making problematic foes simpler to dispatch and enabling offensive teammates like Mewtwo to make progress. Aside from this, Gengar packs Night Shade to do decent, consistent damage to all Pokemon and a powerful Thunderbolt to threaten Water-types like Slowbro.</p> <p>Gengar is hindered by its inconsistency—it has to rely on Hypnosis's low accuracy, and this is exacerbated by its poor physical bulk and unfortunate weaknesses to Psychic and Ground. Moreover, while Gengar is immune to Body Slam and thus its paralysis chance, other moves like Thunder Wave and Stun Spore can still cripple it, preventing it from outpacing naturally slower Pokemon and paralyzed Mewtwo and threatening them with Explosion. After Gengar gets off sleep, it can't do much to Rhydon and Golem unless it decides to drop a move for the otherwise useless Mega Drain, and it needs Explosion to threaten many other relevant Pokemon like Exeggutor, Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo.

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gengar's other moves are all niche at best. Mega Drain 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and restores some of its HP, but this move has no use otherwise, and they OHKO it with their Earthquakes, so it needs to hit them on a predicted switch-in. Confuse Ray might seem like an appealing option for paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo, as it further reduces their chances of threatening Gengar or healing off damage. Unfortunately, confusion is unreliable, it wears off after a few turns, and it can be removed by switching out. Moreover, Mew and Mewtwo can deal major damage to Gengar or cripple it with paralysis if they manage to hit it regardless. Seismic Toss has greater PP than Night Shade, but it isn't preferable, as it is subject to Counter and Gengar's lack of recovery means its PP advantage will not realistically matter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis prevents Gengar from outspeeding naturally slower Pokemon and, importantly, paralyzed Mewtwo, making it more difficult to threaten with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Exeggutor</strong>: Alakazam and Exeggutor threaten 2HKOs on Gengar with Psychic, and they can cripple it with their status moves. Alakazam, particularly, is faster than Gengar, has Recover to shrug off Night Shade and Thunderbolt, and is fine with being sacked to Hypnosis. Exeggutor generally does not run a recovery move, and, although Night Shade only 4HKOes it, it doesn't appreciate the damage regardless, as it pressures it into using Explosion sooner.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: These Pokemon both OHKO Gengar and take little damage from all of its moves, aside from the niche Mega Drain. Rhydon's Substitutes survive a Night Shade, so it can set up on it. On the other hand, they would prefer not to take damage if it is not necessary, as their only option for recovery is Rest, and Golem is pressured into using Explosion earlier.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros shares its Speed with Gengar and 2HKOes it with Earthquake, with a solid critical hit rate backing it up. The two usually interact as leads, so Gengar can try to nullify it as a threat with Hypnosis, but this is dangerous, and Tauros doesn't mind taking sleep for its teammates. If sleeping Tauros is not possible, Gengar's next best option for it is Thunderbolt, which only 4HKOes.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Like Tauros, Snorlax 2HKOes Gengar with its Earthquake, but Gengar's Thunderbolt only 5HKOes it. However, Snorlax does not want to take its Explosion or be put to sleep by Hypnosis, or take chip damage in the event it is not running Rest.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew can use any of Earthquake, Thunder Wave, and Psychic to threaten Gengar, but it's outsped and it despises Hypnosis. Explosion is a major threat for it, too, as a critical hit can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outpaces Gengar and OHKOes it with Psychic after an Amnesia boost or with a critical hit. Mewtwo must keep away from Hypnosis at all costs, though, and it wants to avoid Gengar if it is paralyzed: Explosion will more likely than not OHKO it on a critical hit, and a regular hit is still liable to leave Mewtwo in range for other Pokemon to finish it off.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis renders a foe almost useless. Night Shade deals consistent damage, and it's Gengar's best option against Exeggutor and Jolteon. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro. If Slowbro has boosted its Special, Gengar can switch in on its Rest and fish for a critical hit OHKO with it. Thunderbolt deals more damage to Tauros and Snorlax than Night Shade can, and a critical hit also deals more damage to Mew. Explosion lets Gengar remain relevant after it lands sleep, threatening sizable damage, preventing the victim from recovering if it is slower, and allowing one of its teammates to switch in for free and finish the victim off. A critical hit can notably OHKO Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Gengar is usually used as a lead, possessing favorable matchups against Exeggutor and the rare Jynx. However, Gengar stands to take severe damage from their super effective STAB Psychics or get crippled with status itself if it misses Hypnosis. It can avoid this risk against Jynx specifically by trading for it with Explosion. If paired with a backup sleeper, this can give Gengar's team room to get sleep off on a more valuable target. Explosion is generally not preferable over putting Jynx to sleep, though, as it means the team can't wall Mew or Snorlax carrying only Normal-type moves and absorb Explosions, and it can leave a more valuable teammate at risk of taking sleep itself. Gengar has worse prospects against other leads—Tauros is the most common in the metagame, and, although they share the same Speed, Tauros always carries Earthquake, which 2HKOes Gengar, or OHKOes it in the significantly likely event of a critical hit. Faster paralysis leads like Starmie and Alakazam scare Gengar out with the threat of Thunder Wave or a critical hit Psychic. If Gengar gets off Hypnosis, it can apply pressure with Night Shade or switch to a teammate that can scare the sleeping foe out. Sacking Gengar to sleep when facing a sleeper can be a wise choice—it can still take advantage of its Normal immunity asleep, and its good Speed means it is more likely to be useful if it wakes up later in the game. It should be noted that Gengar's presence on a team can dissuade opponents from using moves like Body Slam and Explosion. This can make predicting these moves and switching it in risky, as many Pokemon using these moves also have the coverage moves necessary to hit it for severe damage.</p> <p>Gengar's Explosion can help its partners make progress against the opposing team, but there a few points to consider before using it. First of all, the opponent's movesets on Mew and Snorlax should be scouted beforehand; if they carry only Normal-type moves, sacrificing Gengar makes them much more threatening. It is also important to check for any Ghost- or Rock-types such as other Gengar, Rhydon, and Golem, as they can render Explosion useless by switching in on it. Even if these Pokemon aren't present, sleeping or frozen Pokemon are often used to take Explosion, as they are not likely to be useful otherwise.</p> <p>Gengar appreciates backup sleepers to compensate for its unreliability. Exeggutor pairs well with it thanks to its resistances to Ground and Psychic and fair bulk. It can switch into Earthquake from lead Tauros and land sleep in Gengar's stead, while Gengar can break through certain threats Exeggutor has trouble with, like Slowbro and Starmie. Sing Chansey and Jynx take little damage from Psychic and can block sleep moves from the opposing team if they get paralyzed on the switch. In addition, they have Ice-type coverage to hit the Pokemon that wall Gengar. Chansey has instant recovery and Thunder Wave, letting it remain useful throughout the game, while Jynx is the next fastest sleeper after Gengar. They benefit from Gengar's immunity to Normal, especially Jynx, as its reliance on Rest for recovery can lure in physical threats like Mew and Snorlax. Offensive threats often work well alongside Gengar. Slowbro is another Pokemon that resists Psychic, and it OHKOes Rhydon and Golem with its unboosted Surf. It profits nicely from having Gengar as a teammate, as it tends to draw in Explosions and has difficulties dealing with other Water-types. Articuno and Zapdos are immune to Ground, and Gengar's immunity to Body Slam gives them room to come in safely through double switching. Articuno blasts through Rhydon and Golem, while Zapdos performs better against Chansey and has Thunder Wave to paralyze Pokemon that switch into it, like Mewtwo. Tauros can clean up foes that are put to sleep by Hypnosis and threaten anything that walls Gengar. In return, Gengar's Explosion can put Pokemon in its KO range and provide it an opportunity to switch in.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Gengar makes a name for itself in RBY OU as the tier’s fastest sleep inducer, giving it a prominent role in the lead metagame, as it threatens every other sleep-inducing lead in the game. Gengar is the only Pokemon immune to Body Slam and Hyper Beam. Its high Special allows it to deal solid damage with Thunderbolt, and access to Explosion allows it to threaten walls and bulky foes like Chansey and Exeggutor. In addition, its 21.48% critical hit rate makes these offensive tools all the more dangerous.</p> <p>However, Gengar’s secondary Poison-type, frailty, shaky accuracy with Hypnosis, and lower Speed relative to its threats all prove to be significant flaws that make Gengar somewhat unreliable. Its Poison-type allows Tauros and Snorlax, which would otherwise be walled, to threaten it with Earthquake. It also allows Alakazam and Starmie, which both outspeed Gengar, to severely threaten it with Psychic. This poor defensive typing is exacerbated by Gengar’s poor bulk, which leaves it 2HKOed by every STAB Psychic user barring Jynx, which has a 98.8% chance to 2HKO, and Slowbro, which rarely carries Psychic. Gengar also has reliability concerns as a sleeper, as its frailty combined with the 60% accuracy of Hypnosis means it may fail to put a foe to sleep before it is KOed or forced to use Explosion.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Drain is the most common other option and is used for the purpose of hitting Rhydon. It is not recommended because its low Base Power means it only 2HKOes Rhydon, doing just under 63% on a maximum damage roll, while Gengar is OHKOed in return by Earthquake. Mega Drain therefore only works if Rhydon is significantly chipped, asleep, or if Gengar critically hits.</p> <p>Anything else that Gengar can use is either extremely niche or luck-reliant. Confuse Ray is primarily used to prevent Chansey from healing and to generally increase the opportunities for favorable RNG. Counter can be used to catch switches if Gengar is brought in against something it forces out by utilizing the Counter damage storing mechanics. Submission 3HKOes Chansey and is an additional way to threaten it beyond Explosion, but Gengar will take 60% in recoil damage to KO a Chansey from full HP. Seismic Toss is a worse alternative to Night Shade, as the 8 extra PP is not worth making it vulnerable to Counter, and Gengar should not be getting into PP wars. Gengar is also an effective user of Toxic on teams utilizing partial trapping strategies.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic</strong>: Gengar is 2HKOed by every STAB Psychic in the tier, and Gengar with Psychic strongly threatens a Gengar without it. Exeggutor deserves special mention, as it can come in on Gengar for momentum and cannot be significantly threatened in turn. Even Explosion is a poor deterrent unless Exeggutor has already sustained significant damage. However, Starmie and Slowbro, OU’s two Psychic-types that do not always run Psychic, are both favorable matchups for Gengar if they are not carrying the move, since they are weak to Thunderbolt. A paralyzed Starmie can be especially vulnerable to Gengar if it cannot threaten with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Gengar cannot OHKO Rhydon without a Mega Drain critical hit nor threaten it with Explosion, and it is OHKOed in return by Earthquake. Gengar should only fight a Rhydon that is either asleep or in KO range. Even if sleep is available, Gengar should not try to fight a healthy Rhydon unless the situation is desperate or as a sacrifice when switching out would allow a KO anyway.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Snorlax</strong>: Earthquake variants of Snorlax are the only sets that seriously threaten Gengar. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar, which can only 5HKO in return. Against an Earthquake + Reflect Snorlax, the best way for Gengar to handle it is to force Snorlax to Rest with other team members, come in as it uses Rest, and pressure with Psychic or Thunderbolt Gengar can fish for critical hits and Special drops until Snorlax is forced out; if it wakes up, Gengar is usually forced out if it did not get any critical hits or Special drops. If the opposing Snorlax does not have Reflect set up, then using Explosion to either KO Snorlax or put it into range of a revenge killer is also a valid counterplay option. Amnesia Snorlax will usually force Gengar to use Explosion to handle it, but Gengar should still have enough turns to chip Snorlax down into range of Explosion or a revenge killer. Amnesia Snorlax variants with Reflect and Rest wall Gengar and use it to set up, but that set is rather rare.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Gengar and Tauros Speed tie, but Tauros 2HKOes Gengar with Earthquake, while Gengar cannot 2HKO in turn. If Gengar is out of KO range and Tauros is in Explosion range, attempting to land Explosion may be worthwhile, especially if the opponent has nothing to switch into Explosion. Eliminating Tauros is always incredibly valuable, and Gengar wins the interaction unless it loses the Speed tie and Tauros critically hits with Earthquake, a 10.74% chance. Using Hypnosis against a Tauros out of Explosion range is possible as well, but it's much riskier. Notably, Earthquake is the most commonly dropped move when Tauros doesn't use the standard set. A Tauros without Earthquake is no longer able to check Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Assuming Chansey cannot be put to sleep, Gengar will have difficulty breaking through it, as all of Gengar’s attacks except Explosion are walled by Chansey. If Chansey uses Reflect, then even Explosion will likely be healed off with ease. Depending on Chansey’s set and the game state, it can then threaten Gengar with Sing, Thunder Wave, Seismic Toss, or Ice Beam. The best way for Gengar to deal with Chansey is to use Explosion. Gengar can KO Chansey with a critical hit Explosion or after some chip damage, or it can at least get Chansey to low HP and allow a revenge killer to take advantage. Chansey can potentially bait Explosion and switch to something less valuable or capable of taking the hit, but as long as something has been put to sleep, attempting to land Explosion on Chansey is almost always worthwhile.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Gengar’s Speed is one of its most powerful tools, so being paralyzed hinders it drastically. If it has not put something to sleep by the time it is paralyzed, it will struggle to induce sleep, as Hypnosis only becomes more unreliable with a full paralysis chance added on top of an already shaky 60% accuracy. This does, however, allow Gengar to serve as good paralysis bait.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis is necessary to facilitate Gengar’s role as a sleep inducer. Thunderbolt is Gengar’s primary attack, allowing it to put immense pressure on the Water-types of the tier.

It is used to break physically frail Pokemon, such as Jynx, which is almost always OHKOed, as well as Chansey and Alakazam with prior chip damage.</p> <p>The remaining move is mostly a choice between Night Shade and Psychic. Night Shade deals consistent damage to everything, while Psychic can critically hit and drop Special but is worse against Psychic-types. Night Shade’s main notable targets are Exeggutor, which resists Gengar's other moves, and Zapdos, which takes considerably more damage from Night Shade than Psychic or Thunderbolt. Psychic, meanwhile, is more useful for opposing Gengar, and it also threatens Rhydon as it switches in or if it's at low health. Psychic also serves to better pressure Snorlax and Chansey.</p> <p>Gengar’s unreliability in securing sleep makes a second sleep inducer strongly recommended. Sing Chansey is the most common partner for Gengar, but Exeggutor is also frequently seen alongside it. Jynx is also possible to use as a backup sleeper but is much rarer. Gengar is most commonly run as a lead. If it can land Hypnosis, it can then be used to pressure Water-types, wall variants of Snorlax and Tauros lacking Earthquake, or as a sacrifice to the opposing sleep inducer. If Gengar cannot put something to sleep before being forced out, the backup sleep inducer can try to induce sleep later. Gengar's best opportunity to switch in to try to land Hypnosis is on Snorlax. It can either try to switch into an expected Body Slam or against a Snorlax confirmed to not be carrying Earthquake.</p>"

After all, it can switch in to stonewall Fearow, a top threat, and fire off attacks. However, Onix is rendered completely unviable by its terrible stats. Having an Attack stat lower than Oddish means that Onix does pitiful damage and struggles to break through anything, even targets that are weak to its STAB moves. Bind is already an unreliable option due to its terrible accuracy, but it suffers further due to Onix's mediocre Speed, which notably leaves it outsped by Nidoqueen. Onix's huge Defense is held back by its atrocious base HP and weakness to Earthquake, which makes it lose to most physical attackers regardless. Its special bulk fares even worse, as its low HP, even worse Special, and weaknesses to Water, Grass, and Ice make it lose to nearly every special attacker in the tier. Notably, Nidoqueen's Blizzard OHKOes it 97.4% of the time. While Onix does stop Fearow in its tracks, it should not be used on any serious team on account of it losing to pretty much every other relevant threat in PU.</p>",

Explosion lets Onix sacrifice itself to deal heavy damage to its target, but it should be used sparingly, as it still doesn't OHKO the majority of the tier, and Onix's primary goal is to stay alive to wall Fearow. Onix works best supporting Pokemon that dislike facing Fearow, such as Pinsir and Abra.

Its combination of good special bulk and not minding paralysis too much let it switch into a plethora of special attackers, like Staryu and Porygon, which are some of the best defensive Pokemon in PU. Once on the field, its dual status threatens offensive and defensive Pokemon alike while dissuading other foes from switching in. The ability to cripple and KO top defensive Pokemon makes Drowzee phenomenal at enabling wallbreakers and sweepers like Nidoqueen and Seaking. While it does not like facing offensive foes one-on-one, when Drowzee is at full health it typically forces out common threats like Rapidash, as they are ruined by paralysis. Drowzee isn't passive either—its STAB Psychic hits most targets very hard, notably dissuading Ground-types like Nidoqueen and Graveler from trying to absorb its Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Drowzee's biggest flaw is its poor physical bulk: physical wallbreakers like Fearow, Pinsir, and Nidoqueen generally have no issue 2HKOing Drowzee, even if they have to take significant damage or paralysis in the process. Drowzee's Speed is another issue, as it only naturally outspeeds Omanyte, Graveler, Porygon, and the rare Slowpoke. Drowzee is thus reliant on its foe being paralyzed to avoid getting overwhelmed and revenge killed, though this is often not an option due to how frequently Drowzee is forced to take paralysis itself. Drowzee's Speed also limits the utility of Hypnosis, as while it can potentially let Drowzee beat just about every offensive check one-on-one, it usually only gets one or two opportunities to fire it off.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Given that Seismic Toss is only used for the mirror matchup and rare Psychic-type foes, it is the preferred move for Drowzee to drop. Counter can punish Normal-type attackers like Fearow and Pinsir, generally KOing them in the process, but their attacks deal so much damage that the slightest chip will often put Drowzee into KO range. Counter still has utility against opposing Drowzee and Abra, as it can counter their Seismic Toss to deal significant damage back.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow's Double-Edge almost always 2HKOes Drowzee, while its Hyper Beam does 73.3% minimum. While Fearow doesn't enjoy being paralyzed by Drowzee, it can use Agility to negate its Speed drop.</p> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: Arcanine can 3HKO Drowzee with Fire Blast and Body Slam while only being 4HKOed by Psychic, barring Special drops. While it doesn't enjoy paralysis, it isn't completely ruined, and many Arcanine carry Rest, which can potentially erase any progress Drowzee makes.</p> <p><strong>Pinsir</strong>: Pinsir outspeeds Drowzee and 2HKOes it with Slash while only being 3HKOed by Psychic, barring Special drops. It does dislike paralysis, however.</p> <p><strong>Scyther</strong>: Scyther 2HKOes Drowzee with Slash and OHKO it with a +2 Hyper Beam while it can only 3HKO back with Psychic. However, Scyther is ruined by paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Sandslash outspeeds Drowzee, is immune to Thunder Wave, is only 3HKOed by Psychic, and 2HKOes it with Earthquake—OHKOing after Swords Dance—making it one of Drowzee's worst makchups. While Nidoqueen is 2HKOed by Psychic, it can switch into Thunder Wave and outspeed and 2HKO Drowzee with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Sleepers</strong>: While rare, Vileplume and Weepinbell outspeed Drowzee and can put it to sleep with their reliable Sleep Powder, though they must watch out for Drowzee's STAB Psychic, which 2HKOes them. Gastly and the rare Poliwag dislike their odds against Drowzee due to their frailty, though in a pinch they can use Hypnosis to try to put Drowzee to sleep; Gastly can also use Explosion, which does a minimum of 67.4%.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping Users</strong>: Drowzee's awful Speed leaves it vulnerable to partial trapping users such as Rapidash, Dragonair, and Pinsir, which can wear it down and pivot around it. However, Thunder Wave ruins most of these Pokemon, and generally partial trapping moves will miss before Drowzee is put into KO range.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Drowzee</strong>: Given its resistance to Psychic and it not minding Thunder Wave that much, Drowzee can switch into itself fairly well and proceed to weaken itself in the mirror match, leaving the surviving Drowzee easy pickings for the loser's teammates.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Thunder Wave is the key to Drowzee's success: it cripples every foe that isn't Ground-type, ruining offensive and defensive threats like Rapidash and Porygon. Thunder Wave pairs excellently with Drowzee's STAB Psychic, which provides fantastic neutral coverage; it also 2HKOes Nidoqueen, the most common Ground-type, and has a 40.7% chance to 2HKO Graveler. Psychic's chance for a Special drop is quite significant, as it can turn 3HKOes, such as against Omanyte, into 2HKOes, and it prevents Recover users like Staryu and Porygon from trying to PP stall it. Hypnosis is Drowzee's wild card—it dissuades every unstatused foe from switching in and can let Drowzee win otherwise unwinnable matchups against Pokemon like Fearow and Pinsir, but its terrible accuracy makes it extremely unreliable; one or two misses lead to Drowzee being KOed without doing anything. Generally, Drowzee should stick to using Thunder Wave and Psychic to make progress and only use Hypnosis when it forces something out or when its other moves simply won't be enough, such as against Rest Arcanine or Agility Fearow when no switch-ins are available. Seismic Toss targets opposing Psychic-types, notably 4HKOing opposing Drowzee and 3HKOing and 4HKOing the rare Abra and Slowpoke, respectively.</p> <p>Drowzee is best used to support offensive Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Seaking, Machamp, and Sandslash by crippling their checks. Its ability to dominate Porygon is crucial, as very few Pokemon check it while not being easily checked by something else. Drowzee struggles the most against offensive threats that have ways around paralysis, like Fearow with Agility and Arcanine with Rest. Switch-ins to them, like Graveler for the former and Omanyte for the latter, are good partners; Omanyte has the added benefit of countering Rapidash, which despises paralysis but generally beats Drowzee one-on-one. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine are themselves good partners, as alongside their ability to trade with each other they can also handle Pinsir, which easily breaks through Drowzee due to its powerful Slash. Despite its weakness to Psychic, Nidoqueen can switch into Thunder Wave and beat Drowzee one-on-one, so checks to it like Porygon and Machamp work well. Fellow paralysis spreaders like the aforementioned Porygon and Staryu also make good partners, as together they maximize the paralysis spread to enable their offensive teammates. Drowzee is a solid check to opposing Psychic-types, as it's reliably able to trade with itself and beat the rare Abra and Slowpoke. In a pinch it can check Gastly, though it must be wary of Explosion, which does around 70%.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Hypno holds a niche in the tier as the fastest viable Pokemon that has access to both a sleep-inducing move and a paralysis-spreading move. This allows Hypno to outspeed and put Exeggutor to sleep with Hypnosis as well as paralyze faster foes such as Tauros, Gengar, and Zapdos and attempt to brute-force them with STAB Psychic. Hypno's biggest strength is its role compression, being a jack-of-all-trades lead that covers many matchups at least neutrally, with Thunder Wave being one of the main reasons to use it over Jynx. Thunder Wave even gives Hypno a slight edge over Exeggutor, which has to use the inaccurate Stun Spore; Submission also gives it a better time against Chansey. Hypno has decent bulk, being able to survive a couple stray hits from foes such as Tauros and Zapdos with relative ease. Hypno's mono-Psychic typing also grants it no common weaknesses, unlike Exeggutor, which has weaknesses to Jynx and Mewtwo's Blizzard and Zapdos' Drill Peck. It also has much better physical bulk than Jynx, which is incredibly physically frail.</p> <p>While Hypno does fill many roles decently, it fails to do any of these roles particularly well: it's fast enough to outspeed Exeggutor and Lapras but not fast enough to outspeed any other relevant threats, being outsped and completely shut down by Jynx. It's bulky enough to tank a few hits from foes such as Tauros and Zapdos, but it has little staying power due to its lack of recovery. Hypno also has to rely on Hypnosis to put something to sleep, making it somewhat unreliable in getting sleep off. Hypno has heavy competition as a Psychic-type lead, with Exeggutor being the objectively better sleeper, Jynx being faster than it and having STAB Blizzard, and Alakazam and Starmie having Recover. Finally, while Hypno has effectively no weaknesses, it also lacks many of the resistances that Exeggutor has, taking neutral damage from Rhydon's Earthquake, Gengar's Thunderbolt, and Slowbro and Starmie's Surf, making it much worse at switching into those threats.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Meditate can be used in place of Psychic to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis and make Hypno's Submission more powerful, with +1 Submission 2HKOing Chansey and +2 Submission 2HKOing Snorlax 75.4% of the time. However, this set is walled by Gengar and does next to nothing to opposing Psychic-types such as Exeggutor and Mewtwo. Headbutt can be used over Submission on Meditate sets to attempt to paraflinch foes. Headbutt also has higher accuracy than Submission and does more than Submission to Psychic-types but does much less to Chansey and Snorlax and is incredibly unreliable due to only having a 47.5% chance to immobilize a paralyzed foe with Headbutt. Rest can be used in Hypno's fourth moveslot to try and stall out Chansey, Alakazam, and Exeggutor if Sleep Clause is activated, but this is easily exploitable, as Hypno is extremely vulnerable during its sleep turns, becoming setup fodder for Mewtwo, Mew, and Slowbro. Psychic can be dropped in favor of running Submission and Seismic Toss on the same set, as it deals with common Chansey and Exeggutor variants within the same build. It also forces Psychic-types with Rest to use Rest more predictably, which can provide safer switch-in opportunities for Hypno's teammates, although it has a much worse time against Gengar, Tauros, and Zapdos.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Sleepers</strong>: Jynx and Gengar both outspeed and put Hypno to sleep with relative ease, with Jynx having the opportunity to attempt to freeze something with Blizzard as Hypno switches out. Gengar is less reliable at putting Hypno to sleep than Jynx, and it can be paralyzed and 2HKOed by Psychic if it misses Hypnosis, but it nevertheless is still favored to beat Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Recovery</strong>: Pokemon with recovery moves, such as Alakazam, Starmie, Mew, and Mewtwo, sit on Hypno and exploit its lack of recovery to KO it with ease. However, these Pokemon hate paralysis and will usually avoid a one-on-one interaction with Hypno. Chansey also checks Hypno if it lacks Submission.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Most physical attackers beat Hypno one-on-one, such as Snorlax and Mew if Sleep Clause is activated and Tauros if Hypno lacks Counter.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Rest</strong>: Slowbro can switch into Hypno with ease if Sleep Clause is activated, set up on it with Amnesia or paralyze it, and shrug off damage with Rest. Jynx outspeeds Hypno and 3HKOes it with Blizzard, Exeggutor with Rest also walls Hypno, although it can't do much damage to Hypno in return. Opposing Hypno with Rest also walls Hypno without Rest. Slowbro, Jynx, Exeggutor, and Hypno all avoid 3HKOes from Seismic Toss Hypno, letting them Rest loop Hypno and stall it out. However, these Rests are easy to exploit by Hypno switching out as the Rest Psychic-type sleeps.</p>",

Hypnosis is Hypno's only sleep-inducing move, letting it put foes to sleep and notably doing so before Exeggutor can do the same to Hypno. However, it is quite unreliable due to its low accuracy, and Hypno would rather paralyze most faster foes such as Tauros and Gengar with Thunder Wave and attempt to KO them with Psychic. Thunder Wave is a pivotal tool for Hypno, letting it come out victorious in many situations it may not have otherwise. For example, if Gengar misses its Hypnosis, Hypno can paralyze it and 2HKO it with Psychic, while Gengar is either forced to switch out, use Explosion, or attempt to land a second Hypnosis through paralysis, which only hits 44.8% of the time. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage to all foes, notably 4HKOing Exeggutor and Jynx, while Psychic and Submission do paltry damage to them. Submission 3HKOes Chansey, which switches into Hypno with ease if it lacks the move. The recoil from Submission can also be used in your favor, as Hypno can use it to knock itself out before Chansey can heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled, making it easily revenge killed by one of Hypno's teammates such as Snorlax or Tauros. Counter can be used to help against Tauros, as a countered Body Slam followed by a Psychic KOes it, letting Hypno beat Tauros in the one-on-one if it attacks with Body Slam, which Hypno can fail to do without Counter. It's worth noting that Tauros can still beat Hypno with Counter if it goes for Earthquake or flinches it with Stomp. Hypno without Counter also benefits from the mere threat of Counter, with Tauros being wary of using Body Slam on it. A Hypno with a Defense stat of 154 can OHKO Tauros with a countered Body Slam; this is achieved with a Defense DV of 1 and 29 IVs, although a critical hit Body Slam has a 59% chance to OHKO a Hypno with 154 Defense, and Earthquake followed by Hyper Beam KOes Hypno with this reduction in bulk. Hypno is the best anti-lead against lead Mewtwo and also a good anti-lead against the uncommon lead Lapras. Jynx is also a good anti-lead to Mewtwo, but it is OHKOed by Mewtwo's Self-Destruct and 2HKOed by the very rare Fire Blast.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Hypno has the best typing in RBY, serviceable base stats, and the uncommon ability to spread both sleep and paralysis through Hypnosis and Thunder Wave. While these qualities are good in a vacuum, Hypno is unfortunately outclassed by the most dominant Psychic-types in the tier; Starmie and Alakazam have Recover, while Exeggutor has Explosion, giving all three great options to play out of potentially difficult situations. Hypno, meanwhile, is stuck with Rest as its only recovery option and no way to match or break through its Psychic-type cousins in most scenarios. This means that Hypno struggles both defensively and offensively in practice, failing to find real defensive niches and to threaten much more than Thunder Wave on its Psychic-type foes.</p> <p>Hypno's niche mostly exists alongside these superior Psychic-types, rather than in their place, offering unusual options its competitors lack or struggle to combine. For example, one may use their Exeggutor to lure a paralyzed target into blocking its Sleep Powder, KO it with Explosion, and then follow up with Hypno's Hypnosis for easy sleep. However, there are two use cases for Hypno as a primary Psychic-type that are worth mentioning. Hypno is better than either Jynx or Exeggutor at sleeping a foe, spreading paralysis, and later absorbing sleep thanks to its decent Defense, which allows it to run Rest without being overwhelmingly punished, thus potentially healing its own paralysis so that it may absorb sleep at a later point. Jynx struggles with using Rest due to its terrible Defense, while Exeggutor struggles because of Ice-type moves breaking its Rest cycles. Hypno's diverse toolkit also includes oddball moves such as Submission, which allows for more pressure on Chansey than the other Psychic-types can usually offer, and it can lead to some extremely favorable scenarios with some lucky paralysis and critical hits. These advantages are incredibly specific and marginal, though, so Hypno is nothing more than a fringe pick in RBY OU.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hypno can run a moveset of Hypnosis / Thunder Wave / Reflect / Rest, preferably as a lead. It allows Hypno to land Hypnosis, then paralyze any potential switch-ins, and then simply sit in place with Reflect and Rest until the opponent gives in and puts it to sleep, activating Sleep Clause to keep all its teammates safe. However, should this plan not come to fruition, this set can become entirely useless. Other Reflect + Rest sets can also exist, as these moves make Hypno generally hard to take down, but it will generally struggle with making progress due to Hypno's lackluster offense.</p> <p>Submission allows Hypno to break through Chansey with some luck between full paralysis and critical hits. However, it is pretty much useless otherwise, and the recoil will leave Hypno significantly weakened even if it cripples or KOes Chansey. Nevertheless, due to Chansey's omnipresence, it can be viable to lure it in and break through it with some consistency.</p> <p>Hypno has access to Meditate, Body Slam, and Hyper Beam, which can theoretically help it break through its Psychic-type walls, but in practice it takes far too long to set up and will usually get KOed before dealing any significant damage. If it elects to run just Meditate + Body Slam or Hyper Beam + Reflect + Rest, then it won't be KOed too quickly, but it also won't be able to break through a vast number of foes, including Gengar, Rhydon, and Reflect Snorlax. Headbutt's 30% flinch chance can give Hypno odds to break through foes in the long run, but it comes at the cost of Base Power.</p> <p>Hypno can use Toxic in conjunction with Rest to try and defeat its Psychic-type walls through extremely passive stalling, something that standard Hypno cannot achieve by any other means. However, Toxic has proven to be a generally unsuccessful strategy at high level play, with only occasional appearances and no results to write home about.</p> <p>Counter can be used to try and catch Snorlax and Tauros, but Hypno already struggles for moveslots, and spending one for Counter generally leaves it much less useful in the long term, banking almost its entire utility on the ability to land one Counter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Recover</strong>: Starmie and Alakazam are unthreatened by Hypno's entire movepool bar Hypnosis. Hypno is able to cripple them with Thunder Wave, but it is pretty much forced to switch out immediately after, as it has no prospects in a one-on-one matchup without an extremely unlikely run of Psychic Special drops.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Rest</strong>: While they do not handle Hypno quite as comfortably as Psychic-types with Recover, Rest Jynx, Slowbro, and Exeggutor can generally stop it from making progress, especially if Hypno lacks Seismic Toss. Because Hypno will force them into passivity for a few turns, they are not quite as efficient as other checks. Slowbro deserves a special mention due to its ability to set up with Amnesia against Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: While it has to respect the potential for Submission, Chansey is entirely happy against any other Hypno set, and even when Hypno is running Submission, misses and recoil can often lead to its demise.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: While not as frail as other Psychic-types, Hypno is still not physically bulky enough to shrug off attacks from the likes of Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, unless it is running the rare Reflect. All of these Pokemon can trade hits favorably against Hypno, especially if it ever attempts to use Rest.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Double Status": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypno's main draw is Hypnosis, as it incapacitates a Pokemon in a single turn, possibly making one would-be counter into nothing more than a momentum sink. The second best option against these counters is Thunder Wave; this won't help Hypno break through them much, but it will at least enable its teammates to do so. A number of options contest the fourth moveslot: Seismic Toss is the most common and appealing, as it is Hypno's best bet at pressuring Psychic-types. Rest allows it to stick around for longer, shrugging off weaker attacks from many special attackers, though it can be difficult for Hypno to wake up in the presence of strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon.</p> <p>Hypno's toothlessness against Alakazam and Starmie can most easily be addressed by an Explosion teammate that can lure and remove them—Exeggutor being by far the most reliable, though Gengar can also lure in the former. Once either is removed, Hypno's sleep and paralysis can actually significantly improve one's odds in the endgame. Endgames are usually left for Pokemon that are very dangerous but also very fragile, such as tier icon Tauros, for which Thunder Wave is often a death sentence. Alternatively, if one really needs to cripple Alakazam, Starmie, or Chansey for a teammate, Hypno's strong Psychic will most often force players to expose one of those three targets to its Thunder Wave, which can be very useful for specific teammates trying to break through them. Ultimately, though, this is no different from Alakazam's ability to force Thunder Wave onto special sponges, and Alakazam outclasses Hypno in most scenarios, so make sure you have further reasons to select Hypno—such as Hypnosis—if your primary goal is to paralyze special sponges.</p>"

With the exclusive STAB Crabhammer, its mediocre Special is largely made up for and gives it unresisted coverage, meaning Kingler is capable of dealing with common obstacles to its sweep such as Rhydon and Gengar. Furthermore, Kingler's Speed is just high enough to pose an offensive threat, being faster than defensive presences like Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax. Thus, stopping Kingler from steamrolling or breaking holes in a team can be quite difficult if the stage is set.</p> <p>However, Kingler is only barely viable in Stadium OU. Hyper Beam is massively nerfed in Stadium, so its offensive capabilities are noticeably worse. Furthermore, its low Special and middling Speed mean that any strong special attacker like Alakazam or Starmie can 2HKO and revenge kill it with ease; this also makes it very difficult to switch in. A somewhat related weakness is that Kingler's frailty and Speed reliance mean it cannot afford to be paralyzed at all. Its weakness to the abundant Thunderbolt only worsens this; many users can outright OHKO it. Kingler is monumentally reliant on paralysis support, which is very hard to provide. Due to these factors, finding opportunities for Kingler to succeed is very difficult; ergo, it is generally not recommended on conventional teams.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to deal massive damage to virtually any Pokemon in the tier; note that it cannot boost past +4. +2 Body Slam deals just enough damage to prevent Alakazam, Starmie, and even Chansey from using their recovery moves to stall it out; thus, they cannot switch in lest they get severely punished. Crabhammer backs this up with unresisted coverage, preventing Gengar from repeatedly switching in and threatening a 3HKO. It also OHKOes Rhydon and is Kingler's best option against Tauros even at +2; it also has a high chance to 3HKO Snorlax, meaning Reflect variants can't consistently Rest stall it. Kingler's final moveslot defines its role. Double-Edge acts as a potent finishing tool, as recoil is not sustained when it KOes in Stadium, including breaking Substitutes. Thus, Double-Edge makes Kingler more of a wallbreaker that can pressure Substitute users like Chansey. +2 Double-Edge also has a chance to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Exeggutor, which makes it a good opportunity to punish Rest. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to give Kingler safety against status and exploit resting Pokemon like Snorlax and Exeggutor.</p> <p>Kingler has a terrible movepool, but there is room for customization; usually, the fourth moveslot is the most replaceable. Stomp is the most compelling, letting Kingler fish for flinches on paralyzed Pokemon while using its strong Attack stat. Hyper Beam is technically usable at +2 for OHKOs on Alakazam, Chansey, Jolteon, and sometimes Starmie, but its forced recharge turn can completely ruin any chance of sweeping, defeating the purpose of using it.</p> <p>Kingler should be used on teams that can provide ample paralysis support, which can be a bit difficult given status protection being available in Stadium. Ideally, partners like Alakazam, Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Starmie should be used to consistently get uncontested paralysis. Jolteon is of particular note for luring in Rhydon very consistently while resisting Electric-type hits itself, thus giving it a decent Zapdos matchup. Special sponges like the ubiquitous Chansey make up for Kingler's terrible weakness to special attacks; Chansey also has access to Thunder Wave. Kingler should ideally be used when an opposing Pokemon is at its most vulnerable; paralyzed Pokemon using Recover, resting Pokemon, and those using Substitute are ample opportunities to bring it in. Generally, most of the opposing team should be paralyzed for it to be successful.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Kingler is the strongest Pokemon with access to the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam, possessing a dizzying base 130 Attack. This gives Kingler cataclysmic wallbreaking potential, outright OHKOing Chansey given the chance. It also has exclusive access to Crabhammer, which will nearly always land a critical hit, largely making up for its mediocre Special. Kingler isn't exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, being just above Cloyster and Victreebel. This means it isn't completely reliant on paralysis support and is very capable of mowing down teams without it. Overall, while an uncommon threat, Kingler is very capable of running over weakened teams if given a mere turn to set up. Even if it doesn't get a full sweep, the holes Kingler can tear in a team can be more than enough for its teammates to finish the job.</p> <p>So why isn't Kingler often seen on the big stage, fighting tooth and nail with Kanto's finest? Kingler's sweeping prospects are swiftly put down by paralysis, and this weakness often forces it out, causing it to forfeit any Swords Dance boosts it may have gained beforehand. Kingler's special bulk is also a pressing issue, with even neutral hits like Alakazam's Psychic 2HKOing it. Furthermore, its weakness to Electric-type attacks makes Pokemon like Starmie a royal pain, often causing it to be KOed even at around 75%. These factors make it deceptively difficult to find an opening for Kingler to sweep, and it therefore requires an experienced player to be successful.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Generally, Kingler should never drop any move other than Body Slam, and even this is very difficult to justify. Stomp is a potential choice, allowing Kingler to take a paraflinch approach, but it mandates far more team support to work, which teams can't always afford.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Kingler can deal sizable chip to Gengar with Crabhammer to prevent it from repeatedly switching in, Gengar KOes Kingler with Thunderbolt if it has taken any amount of damage. Furthermore, Gengar has ample opportunity to switch in on Kingler's Normal-type attacks and force sleep on the player's team, as it's immune to them.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos can switch into Hyper Beam or Crabhammer and subsequently OHKO Kingler with Thunderbolt; for Kingler to win, Zapdos has to have been chipped and paralyzed prior, and even then, it requires a +2 Hyper Beam. Much of the same applies to Jolteon, although it is OHKOed by a +2 Hyper Beam and takes very high damage from Body Slam. Furthermore, if Jolteon is asleep, it is nothing more than setup fodder for Kingler.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Kingler is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, as it can no longer mow down paralyzed teams and its poor special bulk becomes much more apparent. The threat of paralysis can make setting up with Kingler quite difficult, as it's very possible for Kingler to be paralyzed on the turn that it attempts Swords Dance. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Zapdos can easily switch in and threaten it with their paralysis-inducing moves, forcing Kingler out if it can't KO them first. Paralysis from Body Slam can be a particularly depressing experience for any Kingler player, especially when attempting to wrestle down Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros, so this warrants consideration in prolonged interactions. Pokemon like Lapras and Victreebel become much better Kingler checks if it's paralyzed, as they can outspeed and KO it with super effective hits without fear of Hyper Beam. Reflect Chansey can also be problematic, as it effectively invalidates Kingler's Swords Dance boost and threatens it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Special Attackers</strong>: Kingler is extremely frail specially, which makes many special attackers suitable Kingler checks, especially when attempting to revenge kill it. Switching these Pokemon in on a Swords Dance can put Kingler into a fairly awkward position as well. Alakazam and Starmie can paralyze Kingler while threatening it with 2HKOs from their strong special attacks. In fact, even Tauros and Chansey can adapt with Thunderbolt to 2HKO Kingler. However, few of these Pokemon want to actually be attacked by Kingler themselves; if they are paralyzed and Kingler has set up, with the exception of Tauros and sometimes Starmie, these Pokemon can be OHKOed by +2 Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes</strong>: While a +2 Hyper Beam from Kingler is strong, there are Pokemon that can handle it surprisingly well while paralyzing it in return. Slowbro can switch in and paralyze Kingler and doesn't mind stomaching a +2 Hyper Beam if it means stopping a sweep. However, a +2 Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam has good odds to KO Slowbro. Lapras can easily take a Hyper Beam from Kingler while threatening with Thunderbolt afterward. Exeggutor can also take most hits Kingler can throw at it and threaten with status or a 2HKO from Psychic, though it can take massive damage in the process—or even get KOed if it has taken prior damage—if Kingler has boosted with Swords Dance. Finally, if push comes to shove, Cloyster can switch in and use Explosion, though it can't do anything else lest it become setup fodder.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to boost its Attack and wreak havoc. Using it also allows Kingler to reapply a foe's Speed drop from paralysis, which helps if Kingler has been paralyzed itself. +2 Hyper Beam can OHKO Chansey, Jynx, Jolteon, and Alakazam. It can also OHKO Starmie and Victreebel 30.8% and 56.4% of the time, respectively. The rest of the tier isn't far behind, with foes often crumbling if even a third of their HP has been chipped off. Body Slam lets Kingler deny switch-ins by the threat of paralysis, allowing it to be more self-sufficient rather than mandating team support; if a Pokemon is paralyzed on the switch after Kingler has boosted, a +2 Hyper Beam will likely follow for the KO. Crabhammer allows Kingler to OHKO Rhydon and 3HKO Gengar, the latter of which is immune to Kingler's other attacks, making Crabhammer valuable to prevent it from repeatedly switching in. It also allows Kingler to 3HKO Snorlax 87.2% of the time, allowing it to muscle past Reflect sets. It should be noted that Crabhammer isn't just some better Slash, though; it has some very unfortunate accuracy issues, and a single miss will most likely be Kingler's undoing.</p> <p>Kingler should be kept until late-game when the opposing team has been weakened or riddled with paralysis. This gives it the best chance of setting up successfully and serving as a wincon. If an entire team has been paralyzed, Kingler will happily take a hit if it means blowing the opposition away. Finding an opportunity to set up can be difficult, though; the best way is to punish a Pokemon using Rest, such as Snorlax or Jolteon. However, simply exploiting weakened, paralyzed Pokemon also gives a worthy payoff. Kingler should ideally be paired with an Electric-type like Zapdos or Jolteon, as they can beat Kingler's primary counters in opposing Electric-types, Starmie, and Slowbro. More offensively, an Electric-type is also a perfect way to lure Rhydon in for Kingler to either set up on or cleave through, which can instantly mean a win with its Electric-type ally in the back.</p>"

Additionally, Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam will KO any Normal-neutral foe at +2. Rock-types are washed away by Crabhammer, a powerful STAB move that will almost always score a critical hit. It easily OHKOes Golem and 2HKOes Kabutops, coming just short of OHKOing Charizard and Ninetales. Kingler also has decent physical bulk, avoiding 2HKOs from some strong physical attacks such as Golem's Earthquake and opposing +2 Kingler's Body Slam.

Even Moltres's Fire Blast, which Kingler resists, will always 3HKO it.

Electrode is generally considered good in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Electrode holds a highly specific niche in the RBY UU metagame. As the game's fastest Pokemon, Electrode is nearly guaranteed to attack before fainting if it enters the battle safely, even if it doesn't have the most diverse attacks. This Speed most notably allows Electrode to pressure quick tier mainstays like Tentacruel and Dugtrio. Its high Speed also blesses it with a 27.3% critical hit chance, which can elevate its weak attacks to extreme heights; for example, a critical hit Explosion will always OHKO Hypno. Its Speed and Thunder Wave make it an above average switch into Wrap users as well. These attributes also enable Electrode to be used as a lead or even a sweeper in some cases.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Electrode’s flaws are abundant and quite detrimental. Outside of Explosion, Electrode has very few distinctive moves for an Electric-type Pokemon. Without Body Slam or Double-Edge, let alone any diverse coverage move, Electrode is forced to use moves like Take Down just to damage Ground-type Pokemon. Electrode's offenses are also inferior to those of its main competitors, Electabuzz and Raichu. These flaws culminate into Electrode being relatively easy to wall and KO. As such, using Electrode often boils down to attacking once or twice and then trying to get lucky with Explosion. It is a high-risk Pokemon that requires accurate predictions and a little bit of luck to reap a proportionate reward.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder is an option open to every Electric-type Pokemon so they can hit a little harder at the cost of some accuracy. Two notable benchmarks for Electrode's Thunder include a possible 2HKO against Vaporeon and a guaranteed 2HKO against Tentacruel, which Thunderbolt misses and only has a 5.4% chance to do, respectively.</p> <p>Electrode has a number of defensive options such as Light Screen and Rest. These can be used to improve a few particular matchups, such as against other Electric-types. Rest is notable for curing Electrode of paralysis, which is usually fatal for it. Overall, offensive options tend to be a lot more useful.</p> <p>Substitute can be helpful on such a prediction-reliant Pokemon. For example, it can serve as a nice midground play in situations like the Dugtrio matchup. If Dugtrio switches, Electrode can attack more freely on the next turn, and if Dugtrio attacks, Electrode will suffer a smaller penalty. However, like the defensive options, it is difficult to find a spot for Substitute.</p> <p>Flash can be somewhat useful at motivating the foe to switch and can hinder Wrap users. However, Screech and Thunder Wave tend to accomplish these goals better and have superior accuracy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon</strong>: Ground-type Pokemon are pretty tricky for Electrode because they pressure it to use a weak Normal-type move or Explosion. Golem is Electrode’s worst nightmare because it takes roughly 20% from Explosion. Golem can switch into Electrode freely and repeatedly, and then fire off a free STAB attack or set up a Substitute. Electrode can threaten Dugtrio with Explosion, but Dugtrio can survive the attack two-thirds of the time and is relatively unafraid of a paralyzed Electrode.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis is a death sentence for Electrode. Electrode is incredibly reliant on its Speed, so taking that away exposes its middling defenses. Paralyzed Electrode can be easily KOed by wallbreakers and sweepers like Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Persian, Articuno, and so on. Additionally, the 25% chance of full paralysis may also keep a weakened Electrode from using Explosion before it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon</strong>: While not quite as bad as Ground-type Pokemon, Grass-type Pokemon also wall Electrode. Thunderbolt deals very little damage to Pokemon like Tangela and Venusaur, so they can goad it into using Explosion. Additionally, status moves like Sleep Powder and Stun Spore will hamper Electrode’s usefulness. Electric-type Pokemon similarly resist Thunderbolt and can paralyze Electrode. While neither really wants to take Thunder Wave, Electabuzz and Raichu have better coverage moves than Electrode, so they will generally win one-on-one or force Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Explosion</strong>: Aside from Golem, most common Rock- and Ghost-type Pokemon do not want to switch into Electrode. However, having them on a team can still make Electrode hesitate to use Explosion, into which they switch fairly comfortably.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is pretty much Electrode's only reliable source of damage. Electrode isn't the strongest user of Thunderbolt, but it can still hit common Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dodrio, and bulky Water-type Pokemon for good damage, especially if it scores a critical hit. Assuming the opponent lacks a Ground-type Pokemon, Electrode can reliably paralyze any foe thanks to its high Speed. This is particularly useful for slowing down Agility sweepers like Articuno and Dragonite. Electrode's reliance on Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave encourages Ground-type Pokemon to switch in, so it is wise to run Pokemon that can capitalize on this, such as Gyarados, Poliwrath, and Tangela. Hypno is also likely to switch in against Electrode, making fast sleep users such as Venusaur good partners as well.</p> <p>Explosion is Electrode’s main selling point. While Electrode’s base Attack stat of 50 is underwhelming, Explosion is still quite strong, especially if it happens to be a critical hit. Explosion has many desirable targets, such as Dugtrio, Hypno, Tentacruel, and Kadabra, the last of which will always be KOed. However, there are also many Pokemon that Electrode doesn’t want to hit, such as Rock-type Pokemon, sleeping and frozen Pokemon, and, worst of all, Haunter. Electrode is thus a very prediction-heavy Pokemon. As an example, suppose Electrode is face-to-face with Dugtrio. Explosion can OHKO Dugtrio, especially if Dugtrio took a little chip damage. Dugtrio will deal a minimum of 73% to Electrode with Earthquake. This creates a 50/50 situation of whether Dugtrio will switch out in fear of Explosion or stay in and hope Electrode overpredicts by using something else. Electrode creates situations like this a lot, especially if it is played in the mid- or late-game. Using Electrode effectively often means making some bold (or lucky) predictions or spending a lot of effort so these predictions aren’t necessary. This volatility can help Electrode take down some important targets with little issue but also risks it fainting for naught. If Electrode does hit its desired target, it establishes a better position for its teammates. For example, blowing up on Tentacruel or Hypno might help Articuno sweep, while hitting Dugtrio should keep Pokemon like Kadabra and Raichu safe.</p> <p>Screech helps Electrode get the most out of its Explosion. While the move may suffer from an unimpressive accuracy of 84.4%, over half the Pokemon prominent in the RBY UU metagame may or will faint to Electrode's Explosion after Screech. Not only will key offensive Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dugtrio, and Persian be guaranteed to faint, but bulkier Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Vaporeon, and Gyarados have a chance as well. This threat incentivizes foes to switch without actually forcing Electrode to blow up, allowing it to potentially use Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave uncontested or bring in a teammate more safely. Screech is also remarkably useful in situations where the foe is unwilling or unable to switch, like after it has used a stat-boosting move or when it is the last Pokemon remaining. In these cases, Electrode can be more confident that it will be able to deal large amounts of damage to its desired target.</p> <p>Despite Screech's benefits, it is still viable to run an arbitrary Normal-type attack just so Electrode can hit Ground-type foes without KOing itself. Take Down can be fairly strong with a critical hit, but it is otherwise a painfully mediocre move with low accuracy as well as recoil, and Hyper Beam, while powerful, can leave Electrode susceptible to being paralyzed or KOed if it fails to KO the foe first.</p> <p>Finally, it is worth noting that Electrode can serve as a lead. This is partially because Electrode has much trouble switching into most Pokemon. While not as consistent as more traditional choices, Electrode can break a few holes earlier in the match and help its teammates arrange a sweep by mixing up options like fast Thunder Wave, STAB Thunderbolt, and powerful Explosion. Conversely, Electrode's high Speed makes it a decent late-game sweeper as well. However, its poor coverage tends to make Pokemon like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Agility users superior options for the role.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>What Exeggcute lacks in stats, it makes up for in status moves and typing, utilizing its key Psychic and Electric resistances to spread sleep and paralysis. It is one of the few Pokemon available that can inflict sleep consistently. It can switch into, status, and wear down the opponent's Mr. Mime without exposing your own Mr. Mime to paralysis, keeping it healthy so it can run rampant later in the match. Its resistance to Mr. Mime's, Electrode's, and Venomoth's primary attacks makes it good support for teams otherwise vulnerable to these foes, and it minds paralysis less than most Pokemon. It also packs Explosion to heavily damage a foe on the way out and grant free entry to a deadly attacker or setup sweeper, allowing for clever positioning to set up a nice endgame sweep.</p> <p>Exeggcute's typing does, however, make it extremely vulnerable to the plentiful Fire- and Ice-type attacks in the tier. Even though it resists Earthquake, its very low Speed and lack of Grass-type STAB moves make it a mediocre Golem check, and its low Special and Ice weakness make it an extremely unreliable switch-in to Nidoking. Its physical bulk, while passable, is insufficient to avoid OHKOs from Kingler's and Pinsir's +2 Hyper Beams, leaving it unable to stop their sweeps with Stun Spore. Additionally, its low offensive stats leave it rather passive after it spreads status, and it will almost certainly get paralyzed as it tries to put something to sleep, which leaves it with an inconsistent 56% chance to actually land its status moves thereafter. Nonetheless, Exeggcute is a considerable thorn in the side of almost any NU team given the sheer prevalence of Mr. Mime and Venomoth.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Rest gives Exeggcute longevity against Mr. Mime and Electrode, letting it continually frustrate their attempts to make progress and provide a safe switch for Pokemon vulnerable to them. However, due to its low bulk and common weaknesses, it invites sweepers like Nidoking and Raticate and Swords Dance users like Kingler and Kabutops in, letting them throw out devastating attacks while it is asleep. It also must fear repeated Special drops from Mr. Mime, which will eventually force a switch. Double-Edge could be used to pressure Mr. Mime slightly more heavily than Psychic; however, it only threatens a 5HKO with Exeggcute's dismal Attack stat, and the move weakens Exeggcute with recoil damage. Alternatively, Egg Bomb avoids recoil damage at the cost of a poor 74.7% accuracy. Solar Beam is Exeggcute's only Grass-type attack—it threatens Kingler, Kabutops, and Golem with an OHKO and inflicts massive damage on Blastoise and Seadra. However, since the opponent can simply switch out during its charge turn, Solar Beam is only possibly useful late-game, when they might lack healthy Grass-resistant Pokemon to tank it.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Blastoise and Seadra are faster than Exeggcute, aren't threatened much by its Psychic or Explosion, aren't affected heavily by paralysis, and shred Exeggcute with Ice-type attacks. Blastoise's Seismic Toss followed by Blizzard has an 82% chance to KO, making it nearly impossible for Exeggcute to switch in or bait an attack to pivot in a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: All fully-evolved Fire-types outspeed and OHKO Exeggcute with Fire Blast, and they are either 5HKOed or 4HKOed by Exeggcute's weak Psychic. Stun Spore on the switch takes their greatest asset away, though.</p> <p><strong>Clefable and Wigglytuff</strong>: Both Clefable and Wigglytuff outspeed and 2HKO Exeggcute with Blizzard, and if they don't have that, they can 3HKO with two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. They are already slower than most of the tier and thus aren't harmed much by paralysis, and Psychic only 5HKOes them, letting them bully Exeggcute once Sleep Powder isn't an option.</p> <p><strong>Fearow, Raticate, and Nidoking</strong>: In a pinch, these fast offensive Pokemon 2HKO Exeggcute to win one-on-one, but all are severely hampered by paralysis, and Nidoking especially does not take Psychic well. They are very effective at punishing Rest Exeggcute, taking advantage of its sleeping turns to switch in safely and blow holes in its team.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Exeggcute's primary goal is to get in and put something to sleep as soon as it can, and then it attempts to spread paralysis to support its team. Teammates shouldn't paralyze Pokemon Exeggcute struggles to handle, like Fire-types, before Exeggcute gets in and puts a foe to sleep. Psychic is Exeggcute's best attacking option and hits most Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage. Psychic's 33.2% chance of reducing Special helps Exeggcute to overcome its passiveness, breaking down even bulky foes when combined with paralysis. A Special drop also provides defensive benefits, such as preventing Blastoise and Seadra from 2HKOing Exeggcute with Blizzard and reducing even Moltres's nuclear Fire Blast to a 2HKO, giving a healthy Exeggcute the option to boldly stay in on Fire-types and debilitate them with status. Explosion allows Exeggcute to take out over two-thirds of Mr. Mime's HP, leaving it in KO range for most allies, or to deal around 50% to most foes while granting an ally free entry. This allows Exeggcute to grab momentumwhen it's about to faint anyway and potentially set up an ally's sweep.</p> <p>Water-types in particular have good synergy with Exeggcute, covering for its weakness to Fire and Ice, while Exeggcute in turn covers their Electric weaknesses. Kingler and Kabutops also benefit from Exeggcute's relatively weak Explosion, which can grant them a safe moment to set up Swords Dance against a weakened foe. Powerhouses below base 90 Speed, like Nidoking and Kingler, enjoy Exeggcute as a relatively safe switch-in to escape heavy damage or paralysis from Mr. Mime, Electrode, or Venomoth, and it can inflict status to help them blow apart the opposing team. While Exeggcute can't fight Ground- and Water-types one-on-one, its resistances to their STAB attacks let it bait out their weaker coverage moves, letting teammates switch in more safely.</p>"

Its subpar Speed generally forces it to take a hit before it is able to move, allowing it to be worn down more easily. While Exeggutor can use Rest effectively, it makes it passive for two turns and gives opportunities for Pokemon that can threaten it to switch in.

Stun Spore cripples threats, but note that it is blocked by Substitute. Double-Edge is an incredibly useful move that can pressure Chansey, Alakazam, and their Substitutes, which is ideal, as its recoil damage doesn't apply when it scores a KO or breaks a Substitute. Breaking their Substitutes prevents them from setting up Substitute again and gives Exeggutor an opportunity to land Stun Spore when they're forced to recover. Furthermore, Double-Edge also deals more damage to enemy Exeggutor than Psychic can, allowing it to wear it down and force its Rest more quickly. Pressuring other Exeggutor and Chansey into using their recovery moves lets you switch out to a teammate that can threaten them. Explosion can be run over Double-Edge to let Exeggutor trade for a Pokemon on the opposing team and allow a teammate to switch in. However, it is risky, because Rhydon is common and takes little damage from it, and Explosion KOes Exeggutor when it hits a Substitute in Stadium. Finally, Rest heals Exeggutor and wipes off paralysis and the Speed loss that comes with it, keeping enemy Exeggutor, Alakazam, Rhydon, Jolteon, Snorlax, and others in check long term. Be aware that using Rest gives offensive threats like Starmie, Zapdos, and Snorlax an opportunity to switch in and apply pressure.</p> <p>Exeggutor makes a potent lead choice in Stadium OU to status common leads like other Exeggutor, Chansey, and Snorlax and scout for Substitute on Alakazam with Double-Edge. In addition, leads that can threaten Exeggutor like Jynx are rare in Stadium OU. Later on, care should be taken if Exeggutor is paralyzed; though it can remove the status with Rest, Pokemon like Snorlax and Rhydon have an easier time putting pressure on Exeggutor, especially if they are behind a Substitute, as it will then not be able to paralyze them. Exeggutor should generally stick to the moves listed above, but it does have other options. Sleep Powder puts a foe to sleep, but it's a shadow of its former self in Stadium; it cannot hit Pokemon behind a Substitute, sleep is limited to 0-3 turns, and Rest is counted under Sleep Clause, making it useless if one of the opponent's Pokemon is sleeping from Rest. Mega Drain hits Starmie, Slowbro, and Rhydon while letting Exeggutor recover some HP in the process. Unfortunately, it is blocked by Substitute and does little damage to most other Pokemon. Egg Bomb is an alternative to Double-Edge that never causes recoil damage, but it's held back by its shaky accuracy. Hyper Beam has a surprise factor and will KO Chansey at 40%, but it's undesirable, as Exeggutor will always have to recharge after using it in Stadium.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Exeggutor is arguably the most reliable sleeper in RBY Ubers. Its relatively accurate Sleep Powder and good stats mean it will almost always manage to put a foe to sleep. This, alongside Stun Spore, allows Exeggutor to provide incredible team support that facilitates strong sweepers like Slowbro and Mewtwo. Exeggutor also has access to Explosion, meaning it will always pose a threat even after it has finished spreading its status, effectively making it a two-for-one in an ideal scenario. Exeggutor's stats are very well-rounded, boasting excellent bulk that allows it to check threats such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Mew under the right conditions. It can even check Mewtwo not carrying an Ice-type move. Moreover, Exeggutor's niche is unique, as no other Pokemon has the combination of a sleep move, a paralysis move, and Explosion. Exeggutor also hits very hard and can effectively pressure foes such as paralyzed Pokemon, Snorlax, and Chansey with Special drops from Psychic.</p> <p>However, Exeggutor does have a few flaws. It is forced out by strong Ice-type attackers such as Jynx, Cloyster, Articuno, and Lapras, as well as Mewtwo if it is carrying Ice Beam or Blizzard. Exeggutor's lack of coverage means it is reliant on Psychic and Explosion to deal damage, causing it to struggle to damage other Psychic-types and Chansey without using Explosion. Exeggutor is also very slow for Ubers, and it will usually take a hit before it can do anything, often forcing it to use Explosion earlier than it would like to. Also, Exeggutor lacks any kind of recovery, and players must be aware of the risks of switching Exeggutor in against attacks like Tauros's Body Slam.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stun Spore can be replaced by a number of options. Double-Edge can damage Psychic-types like Jynx and Alakazam more reliably. However, Double-Edge's recoil causes Exeggutor to be chipped down even faster, meaning it will likely use Explosion earlier than desired. Mega Drain is an option to 2HKO Rhydon and Golem while also healing Exeggutor a little bit. However, Exeggutor already has a favorable matchup against the two, and Psychic is usually sufficient to handle them. Mega Drain also makes Exeggutor a good Starmie check, especially if Starmie lacks Blizzard. Even if Starmie uses Blizzard, Mega Drain can stop a paralyzed Starmie from absorbing Sleep Powder and prevents Starmie from staying in after it is put to sleep. Hyper Beam is useful for certain ranges where foes might take another Psychic but aren't worth using Explosion on. However, using Hyper Beam requires good prediction and calculations, as failing to KO will result in Exeggutor being forced out or revenge killed. Rest may seem good to provide Exeggutor with semi-reliable recovery; however, it is very easy to pressure a sleeping Exeggutor with strong attacks, and finding opportunities to wake up is a difficult prospect. Being asleep also makes it more likely that Exeggutor will faint before it has a chance to use Explosion. Furthermore, a sleeping Exeggutor is a prime opportunity for setup sweepers such as Mewtwo and Slowbro to come in and wreak havoc.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type attacks</strong>: Exeggutor's weakness to Ice means it is afraid of the common moves Ice Beam and Blizzard, especially STAB Blizzard from Jynx, Articuno, Lapras, and Cloyster, as well as coverage moves from Chansey, Mewtwo, and Starmie. Any of these Pokemon can force Exeggutor to switch out or take massive damage. Notably, any critical hit STAB Blizzard will OHKO Exeggutor.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggutor's lack of coverage options means it often cannot do much to Psychic-types after it has statused them. Against Alakazam, Slowbro, Jynx, Mew, Mewtwo, or opposing Exeggutor, Exeggutor will be forced to switch out or use Explosion earlier than it would like to. Alakazam also has Seismic Toss to quickly rack up damage, which usually cannot be recovered. Moreover, these Pokemon make fantastic sleep blockers if they are paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Because it uses its great bulk to switch in often, Exeggutor is very prone to getting worn down by chip damage to the point where it can no longer switch in. Exeggutor's low Speed compounds this issue, as it will usually be forced to take two hits before it can attack whenever it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Ice Beam Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo carrying Ice Beam or Blizzard can lure in Exeggutor and OHKO it with +4 Ice Beam or +2 Blizzard. For this reason, scouting Mewtwo's set beforehand is very important.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey reliably switches into Exeggutor and threatens it in a variety of ways in return. However, Chansey is likely to be OHKOed by Explosion and does not want to be put to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Exeggutor and can outright OHKO with a critical hit from Drill Peck. However, Zapdos hates being statused, and takes sizable damage from Psychic, so it cannot switch in safely.</p>",

Stun Spore allows Exeggutor and slower teammates to make more progress against faster foes such as Mew, Tauros, and Zapdos. Psychic hits Pokemon like Tauros, Rhydon, and Snorlax for solid damage, which can quickly turn into 2HKOs or 3HKOs with Special drops. Explosion makes sure Exeggutor will be useful at every stage of the game, always applying immense pressure even if Exeggutor is at low HP or paralyzed. Explosion should be used to remove Chansey and Alakazam and deal heavy damage to Mewtwo, allowing a teammate to come in and revenge kill.</p> <p>Exeggutor should be paired with teammates that appreciate the status it spreads. Setup sweepers like Amnesia Mewtwo, Amnesia Slowbro, and Swords Dance Mew can take full advantage of a sleeping foe. Slow, powerful attackers such as Rhydon, Snorlax, Golem, Slowbro, and, to some extent, Articuno enjoy having faster foes paralyzed by Stun Spore. Rhydon, in particular, greatly appreciates having its foes paralyzed, as this can sometimes allow it to use Substitute for free. Exeggutor can also paralyze and use Explosion against Mewtwo, opening an easy path for a teammate such as Snorlax or Tauros to KO it. This will make it much easier for your own Mewtwo to sweep with Amnesia later on. Zapdos is a particularly good teammate with Exeggutor, which handles Rhydon very well and induces sleep uncontested. Note that Exeggutor's generally good matchup against Rhydon is no longer safe after taking two Rock Slides while switching in.</p> <p>Exeggutor makes a decent lead because it can consistently put a foe to sleep on turn 1. Lead Exeggutor has a particularly good matchup against lead Tauros, as it can tank any hit from Tauros and easily put it to sleep. Against lead Gengar, Exeggutor can be used as sleep fodder; and against lead Jynx, it can simply use Explosion to remove it so long as Jynx misses Lovely Kiss. However, sacrificing Exeggutor too early could cause troubles later in the game when Mewtwo or another threat may need checking. Lead Exeggutor also has a poor matchup against other sleep leads. When using Exeggutor, it is important to not mindlessly use Thunder Wave or Stun Spore early game, as skilled opponents will switch in their Exeggutor check to absorb the paralysis, creating a sleep blocker. Exeggutor's lack of recovery means it should be on the lookout for safe ways to switch in, such as against the various users of Rest and Recover on the turns they heal. Such users include Snorlax, Mewtwo, and Alakazam. Exeggutor can also switch in against moves it resists, such as Psychic and Rhydon's and Tauros's Earthquake. Exeggutor should always be looking for opportunities to safely use Explosion and scouting for anything that could prevent it from doing so. Experienced players will be able to predict Explosion the majority of the time and will switch in their Rock-type, Gengar, or other fodder to absorb it. If Exeggutor faints before using Explosion, much of its utility and potential momentum is wasted. This mandates scouting for Ice Beam or Blizzard on opposing Mewtwo.</p>"

A combination of Explosion, Sleep Powder, and Psychic, in addition to unique typing and solid base stats, makes it an easy pick for a large number of RBY teams. Despite the unfortunate Ice weakness, its resistance to Ground-type attacks makes it one of the most reliable Rhydon switch-ins; it is also the most reliable answer to the uncommon but threatening Slowbro. A combination of defensive utility and wallbreaking power earns Exeggutor a spot on many RBY teams; however, teams that already feature other sleepers may find it redundant, and its inability to recover damage can make it undesirable to some teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Exeggutor has a large movepool that can allow it to fill different roles, but none of the following options has seen high-level success in in any combination. Exeggutor can use Rest to get consistent value out of its strong Psychic and Stun Spore, as well as consistently check opposing Exeggutor, Rhydon, Alakazam, Jolteon without Pin Missile, and Blizzard-less Starmie variants throughout a game. However, this often invites in offensive behemoths like Tauros for free, which makes it very difficult to justify over conventional, standard sets. Alternatively, Egg Bomb hits as hard as Double-Edge and has no recoil, but its low accuracy makes it a generally inferior choice. Finally, Exeggutor has access to decent defensive and utility moves such as Reflect, Toxic, Leech Seed, and even Mimic, but these are often seen as strictly suboptimal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx</strong>: These Pokemon are often on the receiving end of a turn 1 Thunder Wave, which makes them solid switch-ins to Sleep Powder, although they must watch out for aggressive predictions from the Exeggutor user. Although they are not fully reliable in all situations, they are often the best available option to safely switch in on Exeggutor, and should be able to threaten it with Thunder Wave or Blizzard while keeping themselves healthy to answer it repeatedly thanks to Recover or Rest.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Exeggutor simply has no ways to consistently get through Chansey outside of Sleep Powder and Explosion, which come with their obvious limitations. A paralyzed Chansey leaves Exeggutor with no options other than to Explode, pray for multiple full paralysis + Special drops with Psychic, or switch out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can't really harm each other much, and unless one of the Exeggutor is able to land Sleep Powder on the other, this one-on-one matchup most often ends with one of the Exeggutor Exploding on the other to trade evenly.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Zapdos</strong>: Although they are by no means switch-ins, Lapras and Zapdos threaten a 2HKO with Blizzard and Drill Peck respectively, while Lapras also outspeeds Exeggutor and is able to threaten it with Sing, which means that either of these Pokemon find themselves in a one-on-one against Exeggutor they are generally favored.</p>",

Psychic is a powerful attack that threatens significant damage to anything other than special sponges, and is Exeggutor's main weapon against threats such as Snorlax. Explosion is an incredibly useful move that allows Exeggutor to bring something down with it and can create incredibly favorable situations if used correctly; however, the user must be careful of its Explosion being too predictable, as there are a number of ways to neutralize it, such as with Rock- or Ghost-type Pokemon, or sacrificing a Pokemon already affected by a strong status condition such as sleep or freeze. The fourth slot is the most contentious, as none of the four moves listed clearly outshine the other options. Double-Edge is a strong attack capable of breaking down paralyzed Jynx or Alakazam with minimal previous damage, an excellent tool to have at your disposal because both of these Pokemon commonly switch in on Exeggutor to absorb its Sleep Powder. Stun Spore allows Exeggutor to continue to cripple potential answers even after Sleep Clause is activated; this is especially useful when facing teams with multiple special sponges. Despite Mega Drain's pitiful Base Power, it ends up being Exeggutor's best tool against Starmie, and while the move is otherwise relatively useless, Starmie is another very common answer to Exeggutor, so Mega Drain has its merits. Finally, Hyper Beam is capable of sniping Starmie, Alakazam, Jynx, and even Chansey if they have taken sufficient damage before attempting to switch in into Exeggutor, but it is entirely useless if they have not, and it can have terrible drawbacks if predicted correctly by the opponent; nevertheless, its utility against every common special sponge should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Thanks to this set, Exeggutor is able to answer tier titans such as Chansey and Snorlax and apply huge amounts of pressure on the opponent's team. While its lack of recovery and susceptibility to status makes it a fairly difficult piece to maneuver with, the options in its toolbox make it a difficult threat to answer. Exeggutor players should try to damage or KO paralyzed opposing Pokemon that are able to block Sleep Powder in order to clear the way for it, as landing a Sleep Powder is often game-changing. The easiest and most common ways to find opportunities to send Exeggutor out on the field are on a predicted Chansey using Soft-Boiled or Snorlax using Rest; the former will have to respect the Sleep Powder threat and switch out, while the latter is not only scared of the sleep threat, but also vulnerable to Psychic itself. Once Exeggutor is on the field, the threat that Sleep Powder poses generates strong momentum for the player using it, but it must be followed up by strong predictions to progress the game favorably; using Sleep Powder on an incoming paralyzed Pokemon is simply a wasted turn, but so is Double-Edge on a Snorlax. The stress of prediction can be eased by sending Exeggutor on the field before paralyzing any foes, such as by leading with it. Although landing Sleep Powder this way is much easier, it is also less rewarding due to having to absorb early pressure, status, or damage on Exeggutor.</p> <p>The last detail to touch on is the usage of Explosion. Although most players are tempted to keep Explosion as a tool to get value out of a low health Exeggutor, one should try to recognize when such a line of play might be too greedy. For example, in situations where Exeggutor would not be able to make much progress at all even with a full health bar, it can be advantageous to use Explosion earlier on, when it is harder to predict and therefore more likely to hit the intended target. However, you should be careful of your matchup against Rhydon when choosing to get rid of your Exeggutor early, as it can be very dangerous to get rid of your sturdiest defensive answer to it. It's also possible to use Explosion to get rid of a Sleep Powder answer for a secondary sleeper on your team, most commonly Lapras, but this is a last resort option only in most cases.</p>"

Therefore, Hitmonlee needs extensive paralysis support to work, and it's just not worth it when other Pokemon like Machamp get more mileage out of such a strategy. Finally, its paper-thin defenses mean it has little chance of surviving any interactions, especially against foes that resist High Jump Kick, since Hitmonlee cannot win unboosted.

Outspeeding and 2HKOing Porygon with Submission seems nice, but it is completely outclassed in this role by Machamp. Hitmonchan isn't even guaranteed to beat Porygon one-on-one, since Porygon can paralyze it and use Recover to heal the damage from Submission. Although Hitmonchan can KO Porygon if it hits enough Submissions in a row, the move's terrible accuracy along with the chance for full paralysis makes this unlikely to happen. Since Hitmonchan struggles to beat even the Fighting-weak Porygon, it should be no surprise that most of Hitmonchan's other matchups are awful too.

Like in RBY OU, it blanks Zapdos and Jolteon, but it gains more depth in its ability to handle other threats with paralysis support from its team. Its Substitutes can survive a Seismic Toss, which Chansey commonly runs due to its 32 PP and ability to break weaker Substitutes. Additionally, Stadium's Substitute offers Rhydon added utility, most notably blocking Exeggutor’s Stun Spore, and while allowing it to throw off strong attacks or attempt a Body Slam paralysis with little to no drawbacks. Rest is also used by many Pokemon in Stadium, including, Exeggutor, Snorlax, Slowbro, and Cloyster; this further helps Rhydon get on the field and get up a Substitute without risking damage or a status ailment. Rhydon’s defensive typing—while not great—allows it to also be a Thunder Wave and Explosion absorber.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon is slower than all OU Pokemon besides Snorlax and Slowbro. Despite its Normal resistance, its poor defensive typing and Special allow common Pokemon such as Chansey, Tauros, and Starmie to outspeed and 2HKO with Ice Beam or Blizzard, which they very commonly carry. This means Rhydon absolutely requires paralysis support to be effective, and while this may seem high-maintenance, with proper team support Rhydon is capable of busting massive holes mid-game or cleaning up late-game.</p> <p>Rhydon also competes with Golem, which has access to Explosion—and is slightly faster than Rhydon, at base 45—meaning it wins one-on-one with its own Earthquake. However, what Golem lacks is the ability to create Substitutes that survive Seismic Toss. This makes Golem’s gameplan very prediction reliant because wallbreaking and cleaning up is much less safe. Rhydon also has the edge offensively, as its higher Attack allows it to meet better KO ranges against common Pokemon in the metagame. Finally, while Golem does outspeed Rhydon, they effectively share the same Speed tier, being outsped by Chansey and thus both requiring paralysis support. For these reasons, Rhydon is preferred on most competitive teams.</p>",

Its Earthquake is the strongest physical attack in the game with no drawbacks. It can easily enter the field against Zapdos and Jolteon, as these threats fail to threaten Rhydon with significant damage or status, with it taking less than 20% from the super effective Double Kick seen on Jolteon. If Chansey is revealed to only have Seismic Toss for attacks, it can also act as a point of entry. However, it's still best to not switch into Seismic Toss, as you can switch in on a predicted Thunder Wave or Soft-Boiled for free, keeping Rhydon healthy to create Subsitutes and stay out of range of Starmie’s and Tauros’s Blizzard. Once it gets in, it can get a Substitute up for free—usually forcing a switch—to attack accordingly. Common checks in Starmie and Exeggutor risk Body Slam paralysis as they break your Substitute, which can help tremendously long term, although Exeggutor commonly runs Rest and can remove the paralysis if it manages to get it off. Not only does your team appreciate these checks being paralyzed, but next time they will be unable to beat Rhydon behind a Substitute one-on-one, as Body Slam chip damage means Earthquake 2HKOes Starmie and Rock Slide 3HKOes Exeggutor.</p> <p>It’s important to note just how devastatingly strong Rhydon is. For reference, with Earthquake it OHKOes Jolteon and the rare Gengar, 2HKOes Alakazam, Chansey, Rhydon, and the uncommon Persian and Golem, has a small chance to 2HKO Starmie, and 3HKOes Tauros and Snorlax. It’s also worth noting These are some of the most common Pokemon in the metagame. Also, if Tauros uses Substitute it will be in 2HKO range, meaning it can no longer switch into Rhydon behind a Substitute. With Rock Slide, it OHKOes Jynx and Articuno, 2HKOes Zapdos, and 3HKOes Cloyster. However, it still loses to all the threats listed above in a one-on-one situation where Rhydon doesn’t have a Substitute and the opposing Pokemon isn’t paralyzed, aside from Zapdos, Jolteon, and Gengar. Additionally, these Pokemon potentially 2HKOing or even OHKOing Rhydon means you must be very careful, as a stray critical hit or mistake is enough to put Rhydon down.</p> <p>Stadium's Team Preview is a double-edged sword for Rhydon. Knowing if your opponent has Zapdos or Jolteon is important to using Rhydon’s defensive utility most effectively. However, your opponent can plan around Rhydon, meaning a “free switch” can turn bad if your opponent double switches to a Rhydon check such as Starmie or Exeggutor.</p> <p>Rhydon is capable of fitting Rest, and it is no gimmick. With so many Pokemon often using Rest themselves or paralyzed, Rhydon can usually find a time to use Rest. It also completely walls Seismic Toss Chansey and Snorlax if it lacks Ice Beam, Blizzard, or Earthquake, using Rest to stay healthy in the face of these threats. If Rhydon happens to be behind a Substitute, you gain an extra turn at the minimum to wake up. If you do decide to run Rest, it will most likely be over Rock Slide, but Body Slam is also an option. Replacing Rock Slide gives Rhydon a worse Exeggutor matchup, as it only 5HKOes with Body Slam. However, Earthquake hits enough of your key targets, and Body Slam paralysis is very valuable to punish switch-ins and gain better one-on-one matchups. Leer and Tail Whip are plausible to negate Reflect, which Snorlax and Chansey often use. This isn’t reliable or necessary, as you’d drop a more consistent option in Body Slam, Rock Slide, or Rest.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Rhydon's typing and raw power make it a major threat in the RBY Ubers metagame. Its STAB Earthquake is the most powerful unboosted physical attack without a downside 2HKOing Chansey and 3HKOing tier titans Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax. Rhydon is incredible at threatening paralyzed teams and is very difficult to switch into. It's no slouch defensively either; its typing lets it wall Zapdos and Jolteon as well as Mew and Snorlax that drop Earthquake. Rhydon is also immune to Thunder Wave, which makes it much harder to paralyze reliably. Its typing also gives it a Normal resistance, which allows it to absorb Explosion for other team members and switch into Hyper Beam to force a recharge turn while taking minimal damage. Rhydon's outstanding HP stat ensures its Substitute survives a Seismic Toss from Chansey, further improving its matchup against it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon is held back by it necessitating paralysis support to function effectively, as its abysmal Speed leaves it outpaced by all viable Pokemon except for Slowbro and Snorlax. This, by extension, means it despises being paralyzed itself; though it's immune to Thunder Wave, it can still be threatened with Stun Spore and Body Slam. Rhydon's low Speed, alongside its poor special bulk and weaknesses to common attacking types such as Ice and Ground, means it will have trouble in most one-on-one matchups without paralysis support. To further worsen this issue, Rhydon only has Rest for recovery, which forces it into passivity for two turns and invites in threats that can apply pressure on it or set up, such as Mewtwo and Slowbro.</p> <p>Rhydon competes with Golem for a team slot due to Golem's access to the mighty Explosion, which also prevents slower Pokemon from recovering and gives opportunities for teammates to switch in. This isn't the only advantage it has to offer; it has slightly higher Speed and 2HKOes Rhydon with Earthquake, giving it the edge one-on-one. However, it lacks Rhydon's remarkable Attack stat, which prevents it from reaching key damage ranges that Rhydon can; for example, Golem 4HKOes Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax and is unlikely to 2HKO Chansey, while Rhydon 3HKOes the first three and always 2HKOes Chansey. Golem's Substitute is also unable to survive a Seismic Toss from Chansey. Moreover, Golem's worse physical bulk and lack of access to a Defense-lowering move make it inferior against Mew. Because of these problems, Rhydon is the superior choice on many competitive teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon has few other usable moves to its name, and they are difficult to fit on a moveset. Fire Blast is an arguable option thanks to its 30% burn chance, which lets Rhydon cripple Exeggutor and Mew on the switch. While Mew is able to use Swords Dance to remove the Attack penalty, boosting moves from Rhydon's teammates, such as Amnesia from Mewtwo, will reapply the stat drop, keeping its physical attacks ineffective for the rest of the game. However, Fire Blast is inconsistent, relies on its surprise factor to be successful, and carries the risk of burning foes such as Mewtwo and Starmie. Stomp's flinch chance can come in handy against paralyzed foes, as they will only have a 52.4% chance to move. However, it's unreliable, and even with Rhydon's mammoth Attack stat it's incredibly weak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor possesses solid bulk and a rare resistance to Ground-type moves alongside a neutrality to Rock, making it one of the best Rhydon switch-ins in the game. Once it's on the field, it can threaten Rhydon with paralysis and sleep—even if Rhydon is behind a Substitute—or deal major damage with Psychic. Rhydon can only 5HKO it in return with Body Slam or 4HKO it with Rock Slide. That being said, it can threaten paralysis on Exeggutor with the former, preventing it from reliably checking Rhydon later on.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outpaces Rhydon and 2HKOes it with Psychic and Ice Beam, while Rhydon can only 3HKO back with Earthquake. Mewtwo also has Recover to heal off any damage. Moreover, it packs Amnesia and a superb 25.39% critical hit rate, so Rhydon is at risk even if it is at full HP. Rhydon can try to paralyze Mewtwo as it switches in with Body Slam, making it easier for it and other physical attackers to pressure it. Afterwards, it can use Substitute to fish for a full paralysis turn and then apply pressure with Earthquake if it succeeds. A paralyzed Mewtwo is also much worse at switching into Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Although Rhydon is difficult to paralyze reliably thanks to its Thunder Wave immunity, it can no longer outspeed paralyzed Pokemon after it is paralyzed itself, severely hindering its offensive potential. If Rhydon has Leer, it can outspeed faster paralyzed Pokemon via reapplying the paralysis Speed drop, giving it another option, but remaining unparalyzed is still preferable by far. Rhydon can be paralyzed by Stun Spore from Exeggutor and Victreebel or Body Slam from Pokemon like Mew and Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon</strong>: Cloyster, Articuno, and Lapras all outspeed Rhydon and OHKO it reliably with Blizzard except for Cloyster, which still manages to do so a third of the time. Lapras can use Sing, which bypasses Rhydon's Substitute and lets it try to put Rhydon or a switch-in to sleep, while Cloyster comes with Clamp, which destroys Rhydon's Substitute and prevents it from moving on the same turn. Rock Slide is a worry for these Pokemon—especially Articuno, which it OHKOes—but if Rhydon lacks it, they all make serviceable switch-ins, though they do not like being paralyzed by Body Slam. Jynx is another Pokemon that outspeeds and usually OHKOes Rhydon with Blizzard, but it's very difficult for it to switch in, as it is incredibly physically frail.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew has multiple effective moves against Rhydon at its disposal, 3HKOing it with Earthquake and the rare Psychic or 2HKOing it with the equally rare Ice Beam. It very frequently runs Swords Dance too, allowing it to 2HKO with Earthquake at +2 or OHKO it half the time at +4. Mew also has Soft-Boiled to remove any damage it takes in the process and Reflect to significantly reduce the effectiveness of Rhydon's attacking moves. However, it's not an ideal check; Rhydon can 3HKO Mew with Earthquake and is able to threaten it much more effectively if it is paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros has a staggering 21.47% critical hit chance as well as coverage moves in Blizzard and Earthquake that 2HKO and 3HKO Rhydon respectively, but Rhydon does significant damage to it with Earthquake, which it has no way to heal off, so it's limited as an answer. If Tauros lacks Blizzard, it becomes a much worse switch-in to Rhydon, as it cannot switch in and wi without a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Most of the time, Rhydon will only 3HKO Starmie with Earthquake, and Starmie threatens it with an OHKO with Surf or a 2HKO with Blizzard backed by a 22.46% critical hit rate along with the chance to freeze. Starmie's access to Recover might make it seem like an appealing switch-in, but it runs the risk of being paralyzed by Body Slam, which badly cripples it.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Snorlax</strong>: The uncommon Reflect Snorlax is capable of 3HKOing Rhydon with Earthquake and breaking its Substitute with Self-Destruct, and it walls Rhydon fairly reliably after it sets up Reflect. Snorlax can also paralyze Rhydon with Body Slam, forcing it to use Rest to regain its Speed. Being outsped is a major problem for Snorlax, though; Rhydon 3HKOes it with Earthquake until it sets up. Another issue is that Rhydon can run Leer, which can negate Snorlax's Defense boost while it is sleeping. Even if it doesn't, Rhydon can potentially break through it if it gets a single critical hit, which it has many chances to fish for. Snorlax also has to be wary of giving Mewtwo free setup turns as it is sleeping.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite is unaffected by Earthquake and 2HKOes Rhydon with Blizzard. Rhydon can switch out, but this carries the risk of Dragonite setting up Agility and whittling down Rhydon's team with Wrap. Rhydon has noway to reliably cripple Dragonite as it sets up, as Rock Slide only 2HKOes it,and Body Slam only has a 30% chance to paralyze it. Rhydon does have space to mitigate Dragonite thanks to its Normal resistance—it can switch into Hyper Beam, forcing a recharge turn and letting it either deal major damage or attempt to land Body Slam paralysis, and it can switch into and out of Wrap to stall out its PP.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro's Surf OHKOes Rhydon, and it can paralyze a Pokemon on a predicted switch. However, it's outsped and 3HKOed by Rhydon's Earthquake more often than not. In addition, Slowbro relies on Rest for recovery, giving Rhydon opportunities to switch in and either force Slowbro out or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel's Razor Leaf is guaranteed to OHKO Rhydon, and it has fearsome status moves in its arsenal to cripple switch-ins as well as Wrap to let it pivot to a teammate for free. However, Rhydon has a 59.6% chance to 2HKO Victreebel with Earthquake and can also cripple it with Body Slam paralysis, making it a temporary and risky switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Sandslash and Golem</strong>: Although they are rare, both of these Pokemon outspeed Rhydon and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Sandslash has some room to switch in, as Rhydon can only 3HKO it in return. That being said, it doesn't appreciate taking damage, as doing so could jeopardize its ability to sweep. Golem has much more difficulty finding a time to come in, as its Ground weakness means Rhydon will 2HKO it.</p>",

        "Physical Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake deals massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Body Slam lets Rhydon fish for valuable paralysis on switch-ins that are not Normal-type, including Exeggutor and Mewtwo. Substitute is Rhydon's primary utility move, allowing it to scout the opponent's choices. It can then take advantage of the free turn to pressure the foe with Earthquake or attempt to paralyze it with Body Slam. Caution is advised when doing this, however, as certain Pokemon, such as Exeggutor and Cloyster, can switch into Rhydon as it sets up Substitute and force it out using Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, and Clamp. Rhydon's gargantuan HP and Defense allow its Substitute to always survive a Seismic Toss from Chansey and survive a +6 Body Slam from Mew 79.5% of the time. Furthermore, it gives it the option to fish for full paralysis against Mewtwo, potentially giving Rhydon an opening to break through. However, Rhydon has to be careful not to overuse Substitute, as it values keeping its HP dearly. If Rhydon does become low on HP, its ability to switch into foes such as Mew and Chansey is severely compromised. Rock Slide OHKOes Jynx, Moltres, and Articuno, 2HKOes Lapras and Dragonite, 3HKOes Cloyster, and does more damage than other options to Exeggutor. Rock Slide also prevents Rhydon from being stalled out by Toxic Zapdos. It isn't mandatory, though—these Pokemon are rare save for Exeggutor and Jynx, so Rock Slide is often less useful than Rhydon's other moves. Rest allows Rhydon to stonewall Mew and Snorlax using only Normal-type attacks. It also lets Rhydon switch into Chansey without getting worn down over time and prevents it from being stalled out by Toxic Zapdos. However, Rest invites in threats such as Mewtwo and Slowbro, which easily set up on Rhydon.</p> <p>Rhydon works best late-game when faster Pokemon on the opposing team have either been KOed or paralyzed. Once this support is provided, Rhydon can switch into Pokemon it walls, such as Zapdos, or foes that does not majorly threaten it, such as Seismic Toss Chansey. Rhydon is not exclusively a late-game Pokemon, however—its mid-game utility is also a force to be reckoned with, as it can switch into the foes listed above and threaten paralysis on switch-ins with Body Slam. After Rhydon is first revealed, however, this can be quite predictable, and the opponent may switch these Pokemon out immediately rather than risk giving it free turns. Rhydon can also switch into a predicted Hyper Beam or Explosion, though it needs to be careful; Pokemon that carry these moves often have coverage for Rhydon. Finally, Rhydon can switch into Thunder Wave and recovery moves like Soft-Boiled and Rest. Substitute should be used carefully; Rhydon has no way to recover outside of Rest, and the HP reduction from using Substitute can put it into range of many threats after it's broken, such as Mewtwo's Ice Beam and a 2HKO from Exeggutor's Psychic. Rhydon should only use Substitute when it is more advantageous to set up one compared to just attacking, such as when the opponent is likely to sacrifice a Pokemon.</p> <p>Bringing paralysis inducers alongside Rhydon is essential given its poor Speed. Starmie and Chansey are excellent teammates, as they take little damage from Ice-, Psychic-, and Water-type moves and possess the coverage to help against Pokemon that trouble Rhydon, like Exeggutor and Slowbro. Slowbro has an identical typing to Starmie and is more effective at luring in Mewtwo and enemy Starmie to paralyze them. In addition, it appreciates Rhydon's ability to block Electric moves and take Explosion, a move Slowbro often attracts. Zapdos is effective against Water-types and Exeggutor and stops Mew carrying only Earthquake in its tracks. However, both Rhydon and Slowbro are very slow, making them somewhat shaky partners. Cloyster can be serviceable partner to Rhydon alongside Thunder Wave Mew and Mewtwo, as Cloyster can cover many matchups Rhydon struggles into, such as Tauros, while Rhydon walls the Electric-types that Cloyster struggles against. However, Cloyster + Rhydon is extremely weak to unparalyzed Mewtwo. Exeggutor is another decent choice that packs Sleep Powder, useful resistances to Ground and Psychic, and Explosion to give Rhydon another opportunity to come in. Rhydon helps these Pokemon in return by stonewalling Zapdos and breaking through paralyzed Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo. Though Tauros only has Body Slam for paralysis support, it boasts a great Speed stat, perfect coverage, and a considerable critical hit rate, and it tends to draw in and pressure Pokemon that cause difficulties for Rhydon, such as Mewtwo and Exeggutor. Rhydon makes a great partner to Mew with Earthquake as its sole attacking option, as Rhydon can switch into and wall Zapdos, which walls this Mew set, and Mew can spread paralysis across the opposing team, which Rhydon appreciates greatly.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Rhydon possesses a very important place in RBY OU thanks to a fairly unique typing and formidable Attack stat; moreover, its Earthquake is the most powerful physical attack in the game without a drawback. Rhydon's typing gives it a good amount of defensive utility, such as switching in to force and punish Hyper Beam recharges, taking Explosions, staving off Thunder Wave, and stonewalling Zapdos and Jolteon. Thanks to its immense Attack stat, Rhydon can hit very high damage ranges, most notably a guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey. It's also capable of KOing Tauros after two Body Slams from your own Tauros. This power makes it very difficult to switch into, with would-be checks such as Exeggutor taking surprising damage. While initially slow, Rhydon is also very scary for paralyzed teams to fight—they often fold to it outright. Naturally, this means it appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Chansey. It can still outspeed Slowbro and Snorlax, however, to force damage if they lack Reflect.</p> <p>Golem has competed with Rhydon for a teamslot for many years. Golem has the strongest Explosion in the game, only beaten by Snorlax's Self-Destruct, along with slightly higher Speed to win against Rhydon specifically. However, because Golem's niche hinges on Explosion, it often has to eschew Substitute. The lower damage output also causes Golem to lose out on some very valuable ranges, notably losing to Reflect Chansey more often than not, which Rhydon excels against. Due to these factors, Rhydon is generally favored over Golem in the metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Out of all of Rhydon's moves, the most replaceable would be Rock Slide. This is because its coverage is rather specific, while the other listed moves add key utility. When dropping Rock Slide, be wary of the lower damage output, such as only 4HKOing Cloyster and 3HKOing Lapras with Earthquake, as well as the loss of coverage against Articuno and Moltres. Should these qualities be useful, Body Slam can be dropped instead. In this case, though, Rhydon can't set up paralysis for itself, making it much more reliant on teammates and matchups against threats such as Starmie noticeably worse.</p> <p>Rest can be used to give Rhydon more longevity, but it's hard to wake up due to being 2HKOed by Tauros. Rest is generally used on more defensive teams to better handle Zapdos and Jolteon throughout a game, but it's also extremely helpful against Reflect Chansey, enabling Rhydon to be more aggressive and freely burn Rest turns behind Substitute. It also helps against Snorlax without coverage, as Rhydon despises being paralyzed by Snorlax on the switch. Another option is Leer to beat Reflect Chansey much more reliably and potentially get past Reflect Snorlax. However, these Pokemon can switch out to get rid of the Defense drops. Using Leer also lets faster Pokemon switch in while taking no damage, which can give the opponent opportunities to play around Rhydon's usual sweeping. In contrast, when spamming Earthquake, a critical hit still ruins Reflect Chansey and Snorlax, and switch-ins will likely take damage. Counter can be used to more heavily punish Hyper Beam and Explosion—bringing in Rhydon after a foe's Explosion and using Counter after forcing their switch-in out can usually lead to a free KO. While gimmicky, Bubble Beam could be used for other Rhydon or Golem; if it drops Speed, it guarantees a KO with Earthquake. It can also allow Rhydon to move first against Exeggutor switch-ins, allowing it to situationally win the interaction should Exeggutor be worn down.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is the best check for Rhydon in the game. It resists Earthquake and is only 4HKOed by Rock Slide. However, it must watch out for Body Slam. In fact, Rhydon will usually use Body Slam expecting an Exeggutor switch-in if it's still healthy. A paralyzed Exeggutor won't be able to reliably check Rhydon anymore, as two Rock Slides will deal upwards of 55% of damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and can 2HKO Rhydon with Blizzard in return, which, when combined with Tauros's absurdly high critical hit rate and the chance of freeze, means that Rhydon is almost always forced out. Even if it doesn't switch out, there's a respectable chance that it does absolutely nothing in return. However, Tauros doesn't appreciate being damaged, especially if the Tauros on Rhydon's team is still at full HP. After Rhydon KOes a Pokemon, Tauros can usually force it out and start exerting its sweeping prowess.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster is only 4HKOed by Earthquake and 3HKOed by Rock Slide, and it can OHKO a third of the time in return with Blizzard. It even packs Clamp for denying a free move to Rhydon behind a Substitute, as Clamp will break the Substitute and render Rhydon immobile in the process.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Chansey</strong>: These two Pokemon are able to switch in on Rhydon and duel it, but only if they are not paralyzed, and Chansey requires Reflect. Chansey is 2HKOed by Earthquake, and Starmie, while very rarely 2HKOed by Earthquake, can be paralyzed by Body Slam on the switch or on a predicted Recover, turning the tides in Rhydon's favor. The paralysis factor makes these matchups extremely variable.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel outspeeds and OHKOes Rhydon with Razor Leaf. However, it takes a huge chunk of damage from Earthquake, which is a likely 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro threatens to OHKO Rhydon with Surf, and with Reflect, it can effortlessly set up Amnesia against it. It can also use Thunder Wave when predicting a switch to worsen the situation. However, it does take significant damage coming in, making it a check at best.</p> <p><strong>Lapras and Jynx</strong>: These Pokemon can OHKO Rhydon with their Ice-type moves, but they struggle to switch in because of the threat of Rock Slide, as it will almost always 2HKO Lapras and always OHKO Jynx. Paralyzing them also turns them into prey for Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem outspeeds Rhydon and 2HKOes it with Earthquake. However, Rhydon also 2HKOes Golem with its own Earthquake, meaning Golem cannot switch in at all.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Snorlax</strong>: While Rhydon is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and Ice Beam, it struggles heavily to actually KO Snorlax without critical hits if Reflect is active. Earthquake can deal up to 38% before Reflect goes up, but after that, the damage is negligible at best. Reflect Snorlax does give Rhydon a good number of opportunities to fish for critical hits, so this matchup can be quite volatile. Snorlax also has issues switching in, making it a check at best.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Rhydon's Earthquake is the strongest physical move in the game with no drawbacks, hitting anything that doesn't resist it extremely hard. Rock Slide covers Zapdos and hits Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Lapras harder. Body Slam is extremely valuable, allowing Rhydon to generate its own paralysis support against the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and Lapras. Rhydon's Substitute is hard for inexperienced players to understand the true potential of, but it can single-handedly win games. Its Substitute tanking one Seismic Toss gives Rhydon the edge one-on-one against Chansey, though Ice Beam still stings. Also, Rhydon can create Substitutes versus Pokemon that can't significantly damage it, such as Zapdos and Jolteon, giving it a free hit against whatever comes in afterwards. This can instantly win the game or impart a huge chunk of damage to a replacement like Tauros. Substitute is also extremely helpful against paralyzed Starmie, letting Rhydon fish for full paralysis to stay in. Rhydon can then go for the uncommon 2HKO with Earthquake or even a possible OHKO with a critical hit.</p> <p>Despite being slow, Rhydon is very hard to switch into if you lack Exeggutor, making it one of the key reasons for Exeggutor's success in RBY OU. It's an absolute nightmare for paralyzed teams, easily rampaging through them. It's very viable to build a team around Rhydon, providing it the paralysis support it needs to clean up. Its key immunity to Electric-type moves, namely Thunder Wave, means it's very hard to reliably paralyze and gives it switch-in opportunities on Pokemon such as Alakazam and Chansey. It is also the premier counter to Zapdos and Jolteon, two Pokemon that can be very dangerous in its absence—especially Zapdos—due to the few Electric-resistant Pokemon in RBY OU. Rhydon also resists Normal, which means it can switch into a predicted Explosion or Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Despite all of the advantages, Rhydon is heavily reliant on opposing Pokemon being paralyzed to get in safely. It has very poor Special; this and its typing can make it easy prey for almost every special attacker in the tier. As a result, Rhydon tends to struggle one-on-one against non-paralyzed threats, notably Tauros, Starmie, and Exeggutor.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Chansey's unrivaled special bulk and exceptional movepool make it a staple of Stadium OU and mandatory on most teams. Its ability to paralyze foes, heal itself, and steadily chip away at the foe's HP throughout a match grant it an outstanding defensive presence. Chansey can even set up Reflect to increase its physical bulk and take on strong physical attackers like Snorlax. Despite it lacking a Psychic-type resistance, its sheer bulk is more than enough to let it switch into the tier's various Psychic users and force them to waste valuable PP. Another benefit of Chansey's titanic special bulk is that it can serve as an excellent paralysis absorber, making further status attempts much more difficult. It's also a potential user of Stadium's buffed Substitute against paralyzed foes, as no unboosted special move can break its Substitute in one hit.</p> <p>Chansey's main weakness is its pitiful Defense stat, which leaves it easily overwhelmed by common physical attackers like Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon. This is compounded by its rather lackluster offensive presence despite its amazing movepool and high Special; without the right attacking move, like Ice Beam for Rhydon and Seismic Toss for Alakazam, it has the tendency to just sit there and eventually fall to critical hits, Special drops, or running out of Soft-Boiled PP. Chansey's Speed leaves it outsped by the majority of the tier, forcing it to usually take two hits when switching in. Despite it being an excellent paralysis absorber, a paralyzed Chansey is very susceptible to losing to RNG, as Alakazam and Starmie have decent odds of eventually breaking through Chansey with Psychic. Stadium's mechanic changes are a double-edged sword for Chansey; the nerf to Hyper Beam means Chansey is significantly less threatened by many physical attackers, especially Tauros. However, Rest and Substitute being more common means that Chansey is more susceptible to being walled or stalled out. The changes to critical hit rates makes some foes like Tauros weaker against Chansey, while others like Snorlax and Rhydon have a much higher likelihood of getting lucky against it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can score some stylish KOs against Snorlax and Tauros on sets not using Substitute, but once the opponent is aware of it, it's much less useful. Defense Curl is an alternative over Reflect, with its massive 61 PP helping in prolonged PP wars. However, it requires extra turns to set up, leaving Chansey far more vulnerable. Sing can provide sleep support, but it's ill-advised due to Substitute and the nerfs to Sleep in Stadium OU.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's Body Slam 3HKOes Chansey, and its 24 PP will eventually beat Chansey's 16 PP of Soft-Boiled. In return, Chansey generally threatens a 6HKO with Seismic Toss, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam. Sets carrying Reflect can PP stall Snorlax's attacking moves, though Snorlax still has good odds of breaking through with critical hits, as its rate is about 10.3% in Stadium. Hyper Beam also threatens Chansey considerably, as it does a minimum of 67.1% and thus OHKOes with a critical hit. If Chansey gets paralyzed, it tends to lose quickly, as a single full paralysis can end it and Snorlax can clear paralysis from itself with Rest to outpseed Chansey. In the short-term, however, an unparalyzed Chansey can usually force Snorlax to use Rest, and while Snorlax has little reason to switch out, it can be threatened by Chansey's teammates. Snorlax carrying Ice Beam can threaten to freeze an unparalyzed Chansey, though this goes both ways. Snorlax must also be wary of Counter. In a pinch Snorlax can use Self-Destruct to OHKO Chansey, though Reflect and Substitute can both prevent this.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: Alakazam generally wins one-on-one against Chansey with a combination of Psychic Special drops, critical hits, and full paralysis. Chansey paralyze Alakazam and can force it to use up valuable Psychic PP, but Alakazam will usually win PP wars due to Recover and Seismic Toss having 32 PP. Chansey lacking Seismic Toss also cannot break through Alakazam's Substitutes in one hit, allowing Alakazam to avoid getting paralyzed. Starmie is in a similar situation, though it might not always run Psychic, generally has fewer PP than Chansey in total, and loses to Chansey variants carrying Thunderbolt. However, it can try to freeze Chansey using Ice Beam and Blizzard. Chansey can also use Ice Beam to try to freeze an unparalyzed Alakazam or Starmie, however.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Rhydon's Earthquake almost always 2HKOes Chansey, and thus its boosted 11.3% critical hit rate will almost always OHKO; Chansey's Seismic Toss doesn't even break Rhydron's Substitute, making it favored to win in one-on-one. However, Chansey does outspeed Rhydon, so it must be wary of an unparalyzed Chansey carrying Ice Beam, which 2HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey carrying Ice Beam usually beat opposing unparalyzed Chansey lacking it. However, Seismic Toss variants beat Ice Beam variants one-on-one if freeze if off the table. Reflect Chansey also tends to be effective at PP stalling other Chansey variants, especially when paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Explosion from foes like Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Golem can often OHKO Chansey outright. Gengar's Explosion fails to OHKO, though it still does 72% minimum. Reflect can allow Chansey to survive at least one Explosion when at full health, though many users can outspeed and attack before Chansey can set up. Explosion also immediately ends the turn, and thus Chansey is often easy pickings for a faster teammate afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Seismic Toss only 4HKOes Slowbro and Ice Beam does negligible damage, so Slowbro can paralyze Chansey with Thunder Wave and use it as setup fodder. However, Slowbro is threatened by Thunderbolt, and Chansey's higher critical hit rate gives it an easier time breaking through Slowbro in Stadium. Slowbro also cannot reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, so if it gets paralyzed it will still be slower than Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Fast Normal-types</strong>: Tauros's Body Slam and Double-Edge 3HKO Chansey, and even Reflect sets must be wary due to its massive critical hit rate; Double-Edge notably does upwards of 80% with a critical hit. Persian's Slash ignores Reflect and has a 53.8% chance to 2HKO. In return, Chansey can generally only 4HKO them with Seismic Toss, Ice Beam, or Thunderbolt. However, both Pokemon are reliant on their Speed, so they fear Thunder Wave, though both can run Substitute, sometimes leaving Chansey in an awkward 50/50. Chansey sets using Counter can also KO them outright.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: Jolteon carrying Rest can use its high critical hit rate, paralysis from Thunder Wave, and Double Kick to PP stall Chansey's Soft-Boiled. However, it must be wary of Chansey's teammates when asleep due to its frailty.</p> <p><strong>Focus Energy</strong>: Users of Focus Energy like Flareon and Nidoking can 2HKO Chansey through Reflect and overwhelm it one-on-one. However, these options are extremely niche.</p>",

        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<p>Reflect lets Chansey take on physical attackers, notably Snorlax, more effectively. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage and puts pressure on paralyzed foes. Its 32 PP also helps it win certain PP wars, such as against opposing Chansey when paralyzed. Ice Beam is an alternative, letting Chansey fish for freezes on opposing Chansey, Snorlax, and other big threats. It also targets foes weak to Ice, notably threatening Exeggutor, which can otherwise use Rest to stall out Seismic Toss, and 2HKOing Rhydon, though it does minimal damage to foes with high Special bulk, like Snorlax and Alakazam, making Chansey extremely passive once Freeze Clause has activated. Soft-Boiled serves as reliable recovery, and Thunder Wave lets Chansey spread paralysis and assist with speed control. However, Chansey must be wary of Substitute.</p> <p>This set acts as a check to Snorlax, as Reflect and its immunity to Body Slam paralysis let it wall most variants; it can easily switch in, set up Reflect, and proceed to force Snorlax to switch out or use Rest, freeing up teammates for other roles. Given that Snorlax will be seen on every team, often as an early-game wallbreaker, Chansey is a natural partner to the variety of Pokemon that struggle against it, like Alakazam, physical-centric Snorlax sets, and Starmie. This is especially notable since Reflect Snorlax is a shakier check to Snorlax in Stadium OU given the increased prevalence of Ice Beam. However, Snorlax lands critical hits twice as often in this format, making Reflect less effective against it. Beyond Snorlax, Chansey naturally lures in a lot of physical attackers, so it can use the opportunity to set up Reflect and gain momentum to paralyze another foe or fish for a freeze. Tauros and Persian still threaten Chansey through Reflect thanks to their high critical hit chances, but these fast physical attackers rely on their Speed to function, so they are very afraid of Thunder Wave. If Chansey is running Seismic Toss, Rhydon is an especially bad matchup. Chansey cannot break its Substitute in one hit, while Rhyhdon can repeatedly hit Chansey with Earthquake until it gets a critical hit, which is about an 11.3% chance in Stadium and is an almost guaranteed OHKO. Chansey also doesn't enjoy facing Alakazam and Starmie: they can paralyze Chansey with Thunder Wave, and while it can force them to waste PP and threaten them with its own Thunder Wave, they will usually win one-on-one. Chansey must manage its status carefully. Once paralyzed, it's a very shaky answer to opposing physical attackers, including Snorlax, the Pokemon teams often rely on it to check; it also becomes extremely vulnerable to Rhydon. However, being paralyzed does make it immune to freeze, helping it beat opposing unparalyzed Chansey when carrying Ice Beam.</p>"
        },
        "BoltBeam": {
          "description": "<p>Thunderbolt and Ice Beam make up the classic BoltBeam combo, which provides unresisted coverage. Ice Beam notably 2HKOes Rhydon and hits common foes like Exeggutor and Zapdos super effectively. It's crucial in helping Chansey fend off opposing unparalyzed Chansey and Snorlax in freeze wars, allowing it to avoid getting PP stalled. Thunderbolt primarily targets Water-types like Starmie and Cloyster. Soft-Boiled serves as reliable recovery, while Thunder Wave lets Chansey act as speed control, notably preventing speedy physical attackers like Tauros and Persian from trying to break through Chansey freely.</p> <p>Chansey's combination of BoltBeam and Thunder Wave makes it threatening to the majority of Stadium OU and thus a natural fit for teams looking for the extra coverage. This set notably beats Starmie very consistently. Due to its lack of Seismic Toss, Alakazam takes minimal damage from Chansey's attacks and can easily break through Chansey with Special drops, critical hits, and full paralysis from Thunder Wave. Even if it runs out of Psychic PP, it will usually win a PP war. Variants carrying Substitute can be troublesome, as they can use it to dodge status and try to break through Chansey more safely. A check to Alakazam such as Double-Edge Exeggutor can assist in this matchup, but Substitute Alakazam has very limited attacking PP and is easily stalled. Chansey must be very careful about taking paralysis; as much as it likes the immunity to being frozen, it's completely destroyed by Snorlax afterwards, so it must manage its status carefully or have a partner that can switch into Snorlax for it.</p>"
        },
        "Substitute": {
          "description": "<p>With Stadium buffing Substitute to block status moves, notably Thunder Wave, Chansey can make use of it to improve many of its matchups at the cost of passivity. Since no unboosted special attack can break through its Substitutes in one hit, Chansey can wall paralyzed Alakazam and Starmie without risking paralysis or Special drops. It can then proceed to PP stall Psychic; its Substitutes also exceed 100 HP and thus require Alakazam and other Seismic Toss users to use up two Seismic Toss PP trying to break through them. However, Chansey is outsped by these Psychic-types, so it relies on its teammates to paralyze them, and thus unable it's to play in the early game much at all. Since Self-Destruct and Explosion KO the user when they connect with a Substitute in Stadium, Chansey can use it to block attempts by slower or paralyzed users. Seismic Toss is an excellent way for Chansey to spread consistent damage and pressure foes like the Psychic-types, though Ice Beam lets Chansey beat Rhydon with consistency. Ice Beam also allows Chansey to threaten foes like Chansey and Snorlax and avoid PP wars, while Substitute will prevent Chansey from getting statused by its foe. However, Ice Beam does negligible damage to Starmie and Lapras. Thunder Wave lets Chansey paralyze faster foes, primarily targeting speedy physical attackers like Tauros and Persian.</p> <p>Counter is a niche option on this set that can punish physical attackers. The most notable example is Snorlax, as sets lacking Earthquake or Amnesia can only break Chansey's Substitute in one hit by using Body Slam, forcing it to lose around 67% of its health. Additionally, Persian is OHKOed by Counter, and Tauros will only survive on one HP when at full health. Counter also OHKOes Snorlax and Tauros if they use Body Slam when Substitute is not up.</p> <p>Chansey is reliant on opposing Psychic-types and Chansey being paralyzed for its Substitute to protect it, leaving paralysis support essential. Thunder Wave from one's own Alakazam and Starmie as well as Stun Spore from Exeggutor work effectively in this regard. Chansey should avoid getting paralyzed, as paralysis makes it less consistent against Alakazam and Starmie and leaves Chansey easily overwhelmed by physical attackers like Snorlax and Rhydon.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Chansey holds a strong niche in Ubers due to having the best Special bulk in the game; it's one of the best switch-ins available to special attackers such as Starmie, Alakazam, and particularly tier titan Mewtwo, taking a mere 21.4% maximum from its STAB Psychic and threatening it and its team with paralysis and sleep. It can also switch into Mew when healthy and threaten it with paralysis, as it survives all of Mew's regular attacks even at +2. It is one of the most reliable paralysis spreaders in the tier thanks to its access to reliable recovery and consistent entry points.</p> <p>However, outside of threatening status, Chansey is extremely passive, as Seismic Toss can only 4HKO or 5HKO most foes, and it completely thuds into Rhydon, failing to break its Substitute. Ice Beam, meanwhile, does not particularly threaten non-Ice weak foes. Chansey can't even wall Mewtwo well in the long term, as it takes 44.2% minimum from a +4 Mewtwo Psychic; even with Light Screen it can easily be overwhelmed by Special drops and critical hits. Mewtwo can also use Self-Destruct or Submission to break through Chansey. It also can very easily run out of Soft-Boiled PP in longer games. Its low base Speed, which leaves it outsped by every relevant threat outside of Snorlax, Rhydon, and Slowbro, along with its physical frailty, notably being 2HKOed by Rhydon's Earthquake and taking 38.1% minimum from a Snorlax Body Slam, can at times make Chansey quite exploitable and a potential liability on teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sing can be dropped if there is already a sleeper on Chansey's team, such as an Exeggutor or Jynx, and Light Screen is droppable for teams that are not dedicated to stalling. Counter can be used to OHKO Snorlax and Tauros by returning damage from Body Slam, and it also OHKOes Mewtwo using Submission and Mew using +2 Body Slam. However, Counter becomes practically useless once it is revealed and can easily be scouted by Snorlax, Mew, and Tauros with Earthquake. Reflect makes Chansey far better into physical attackers such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Zapdos, and it also allows Chansey to survive Self-Destruct and Explosion. However, Reflect leaves Chansey without many tools to adequately deal with Mewtwo and other special attackers outside of paralysis. It also has a major Soft-Boiled PP issue, as it cannot stall Mewtwo or Slowbro at all. Thunderbolt can be used alongside Ice Beam to give Chansey perfect coverage and deal super effective damage to many threats, such as Water-types. However, Water-types are quite uncommon, so Chansey rarely has to give up a moveslot to cover for them. On top of this, this perfect coverage still does not threaten Mewtwo or Mew in the slightest. Flash allows Chansey to prevent Mewtwo and Mew from setting up safely in front of it and reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, but it is inaccurate and fishing for misses is inherently unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Paralyzed Mewtwo can switch into Chansey and start boosting with Amnesia, 2HKOing Chansey with +4 Psychic 20.2% of the time while only being 5HKOed in return by Seismic Toss. Even with Light Screen, Chansey can be overwhelmed by Psychic Special drops and critical hits, especially if it's paralyzed. Chansey also has to be wary of the rare Submission Mewtwo, which 2HKOes it 86.7% of the time. Mewtwo can also use Self-Destruct, which does 80.3% minimum. However, if Mewtwo is unparalyzed, it should be wary of switching in due to Sing, and it becomes far more vulnerable to physical attackers if it becomes paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Paralyzed Mew can switch into Chansey quite easily, tanking Seismic Toss and Ice Beam well and threatening it in return with Thunder Wave and boosted physical attacks. UnparalyzedMew has to be cautious of Sing and dislikes paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is only 6HKOed by Seismic Toss and Ice Beam, and it threatens Chansey back with a KO from Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam. It also OHKOes Chansey with Self-Destruct, but Snorlax hates paralysis if it lacks Rest.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Rhydon is immune to Thunder Wave and is only 5HKOed by Seismic Toss, letting it set up a Substitute in front of Chansey with ease and 2HKO it with Earthquake. However, Rhydon has to be conservative with its HP, as it lacks recovery bar Rest and can find itself worn down quickly. Rhydon also has to be wary of Ice Beam, as it's 2HKOed by the move.</p> <p><strong>Explosion users</strong>: Explosion and Self-Destruct users, such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, Mew, Mewtwo, Cloyster, Gengar, and Golem, all OHKO or do heavy damage to Chansey with the move. Snorlax's Self-Destruct and Golem's Explosion OHKO Chansey, while Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Mew's Explosion are heavily favored to OHKO it. Mewtwo's Self-Destruct and Gengar's Explosion never OHKO Chansey, but both still deal significant damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can switch into Chansey lacking Sing and Thunderbolt with ease, as it's only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and takes barely any damage from Ice Beam. Slowbro threatens Chansey with Thunder Wave and boosted Surf, 2HKOing it 76.2% of the time with +6 Surf and 4HKOing it 88.4% of the time if it has Light Screen up. Slowbro only has to be wary of its predictable Rest being exploited by the likes of Mewtwo, Snorlax, and Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Chansey, can paralyze it, and 3HKOes it with Drill Peck 76.2% of the time. It also has Agility to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. However, Zapdos is 3HKOed by Ice Beam and 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, and it needs critical hits or full paralysis to break through Chansey. However, with the amount of turns Chansey needs to KO Zapdos safely, it is likely that Zapdos will break through it.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and Ice Beam and KOes Chansey in return with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam. However, Tauros becomes far less threatening once paralyzed and can only reliably beat Chansey one-on-one if Chansey is also paralyzed, so it should only fight Chansey if it absolutely has to.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Sing": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Chansey can switch into Mewtwo and other special attackers and attempt to land Sing, as Mewtwo usually cannot risk being put to sleep. Seismic Toss threatens consistent damage on every foe in the tier, 4HKOing or 5HKOing most foes and forcing predictable recovery turns from the likes of Starmie, Alakazam, Mewtwo, and Mew, which can be exploited to switch in strong physical attackers, such as Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros. However, Seismic Toss can be exploited by Rhydon, as its Substitute is not broken by the move. Ice Beam 2HKOes Ground-types and threatens freeze on unparalyzed foes; however, it has far less PP than Seismic Toss and does pathetic damage to boosted Mewtwo. Chansey is usually better off just paralyzing the foe than fishing for freeze. Thunder Wave allows Chansey to spread paralysis across the opposing team, with Pokemon such as Tauros, Starmie, and Alakazam being completely crippled if they become paralyzed, and paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo becoming being far more vulnerable to physical attackers such as Snorlax and Rhydon.</p> <p>Chansey is one of the best status spreaders and Mewtwo switch-ins in the tier, so Pokemon that want Mewtwo and other Special attackers paralyzed, such as Cloyster, Tauros, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Sandslash, make great partners to Chansey. Exeggutor and Zapdos make good switch-ins to Mew, which may otherwise cause Chansey issues. Exeggutor can also switch into Rhydon, which threatens Seismic Toss Chansey immensely. Pokemon that get forced out by strong Psychic-types, such as Tauros, Rhydon, and Cloyster, also make good teammates to Chansey, as Chansey can switch into special attackers for them.</p>"

However, Chansey can be overwhelmed by Special drops and critical hits from Mewtwo or potentially get stalled out of Soft-Boiled PP, as it does not have enough PP to stall both Mewtwo and Slowbro. Seismic Toss is Chansey's best option for solid damage across the entire tier and to force recovery turns for Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Alakazam, and Starmie, which can be taken advantage of by the likes of Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon. Ice Beam allows Chansey to hit Ground-types for super effective damage, notably 2HKOing Rhydon, which otherwise is only 5HKOed by Seismic Toss and can set up a Substitute freely. Ice Beam also lets Chansey fish for freeze against unparalyzed foes. Thunder Wave allows Chansey to hamstring fast threats such as Tauros, Starmie, and Alakazam, and paralysis makes the omnipotent Mew and Mewtwo much more vulnerable to strong physical attackers such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon.</p> <p>Light Screen Chansey makes a great partner to Pokemon that appreciate status on fast foes such as Tauros, Rhydon, Cloyster, and Snorlax. These Pokemon are usually threatened by strong Psychic-types, which Chansey can switch into. Light Screen Chansey is much more of a dedicated stall set than Sing Chansey, so Pokemon with high longevity, such as Reflect Snorlax, Cloyster, Exeggutor, and even Aerodactyl, can make good partners to it.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Chansey is a staple in the RBY metagame, present on nearly 100% of competitive teams. The reason for its extreme popularity mostly lies in its gargantuan special bulk neutralizing Psychic-types, an otherwise incredibly difficult task without using Psychic-types of your own, as well as its ability to completely wall other special attackers like Lapras. It does not perform as well against physical attackers, however; strong hits from the likes of Snorlax and Rhydon can threaten an easy 2HKO, so Chansey must be wary of these threats whenever entering the field, although it does possess tools to ease these matchups despite its generally innocuous offensive presence. Nonetheless, Chansey is somewhat of a requirement in any RBY team due to the risks you would take against Psychic-types without it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While it is generally recommended to stick to the above combinations, Chansey is free to mix and match its options, with the only mandatory move being Soft-Boiled. Sets such as Counter + Sing or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss, Reflect + Ice Beam + Thunderbolt, and Seismic Toss + Ice Beam + Thunder Wave can all perform admirably on the right team, so if you want to rebalance certain matchups for your team, feel free to explore different, less conventional ways to combine Chansey's best moves.</p> <p>Defense Curl is an option over Reflect in the typical Reflect set. Boosting Chansey's Defense past +2 usually makes little difference, but its 64 PP allow you to win PP wars against opposing Reflect Chansey and Snorlax handily as well as significantly increase Chansey's odds in a PP stall against Alakazam and Starmie, which is a useful advantage in its own right; however, Reflect's one-turn setup is significantly better when Chansey switches in on Snorlax, so it's generally preferred.</p> <p>Toxic is another curveball that synergizes well with partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, or Victreebel, as the damage quickly stacks up on targets that would otherwise be able to endure their hits, such as opposing Chansey; also, a Chansey carrying Toxic should beat any Chansey that isn't carrying Ice Beam in the long run due to the damage from the poison.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's Body Slam 3HKOes Chansey, forcing it to keep using Soft-Boiled in most situations; as Body Slam's 24 PP outlasts Soft-Boiled's 16, Chansey cannot afford to outstall the attacks, especially when you also factor in the odds of critical hits as well as the potential Hyper Beam from Snorlax. Even when Chansey is carrying Reflect, a Snorlax with Rest is often not even forced to switch out, as it has really good odds of breaking through eventually between critical hits and PP count. The best option for Chansey is to force Snorlax to use Rest and then switch out to something that can threaten it while it's sleeping. While this is not an awful short-term scenario for the Chansey player, as the Snorlax will need some free turns to wake up, Snorlax can easily find those turns whenever Chansey hits the field again, putting it in yet another situation where it is bound to lose if it doesn't switch out. If the Snorlax carries Ice Beam, it can also attempt to freeze Chansey, and in the worst case for Snorlax, it can trade with Chansey by using Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: Chansey has no way to significantly damage Alakazam, and while it won't be doing much damage back, it can win the PP war thanks to Recover's massive 32 PP unless it gets fully paralyzed several times in a row. Alakazam can also simply fire off Psychic until Chansey's Special drops low enough that it's forced to switch out, but Psychic's limited 16 PP means this can generally only happen two or three times per game. Starmie functions very similarly, as long as the Chansey doesn't have Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Sleepers</strong>: Chansey will be healing up a lot throughout the game. If you can send a sleep move user such as Exeggutor out on a predicted Soft-Boiled, Chansey will have to respect the threat of Sleep Powder and switch out.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Depending on the sets, Chansey can be an excellent Chansey counter. Ice Beam threatens to freeze any unparalyzed Chansey, while a paralyzed Reflect Chansey is going to PP stall most other Chansey with ease. Sing Chansey can also surprise the opponent's Chansey and land a sleep on it, and even if it misses, Sing will remain threatening and have to be respected with a switch.</p> <p><strong>Explosion Lures</strong>: Exeggutor, Cloyster, and Gengar can usually manage to get Chansey on the field to sponge one of their powerful special attacks and catch it with an Explosion to take it out. This is especially viable for teams running a Pokemon such as Lapras or Psychic-less Starmie, which are otherwise completely walled by Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While Rhydon has to respect the Ice Beam threat, its Earthquake achieves a guaranteed 2HKO, so it can sometimes accept taking the Ice Beam damage in exchange for a KO on Chansey. It's even better against Chansey sets that don't run Ice Beam, as it can create Substitutes with enough HP to tank two Seismic Tosses and use Earthquake freely. Both of these situations only really favor Rhydon if the Chansey is paralyzed, however, so make sure to set up its status properly before attempting to win with Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: If Chansey is not running Thunderbolt, Slowbro can freely get Amnesia boosts on it, periodically heal any damage with Rest, and eventually KO via the STAB move of choice as soon as Chansey gets fully paralyzed. Chansey should generally switch out of Slowbro whenever possible, as it can get very threatening very quickly otherwise.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: If Jolteon carries Rest, it is able to repeatedly shrug off Chansey's attempts at damage until Double Kick critical hits and paralysis manages to take Chansey down. This leaves Jolteon very vulnerable during its Rest turns, so you should be careful when attempting this.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: If all else fails, Tauros can come in on a paralyzed Chansey and take it out with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, but Tauros really hates being paralyzed, so you should only use this option as a last resort.</p>",

        "BoltBeam": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>BoltBeam coverage allows Chansey to put pressure on a large part of the metagame. Thunderbolt threatens Water-type Pokemon such as Starmie and Lapras, while Ice Beam threatens to freeze opposing Chansey and deals heavy damage to other common threats such as Rhydon, Exeggutor, and Zapdos. Soft-Boiled is necessary to remain healthy throughout the game, and Thunder Wave is Chansey's main weapon to cripple threats like Tauros and hinder anything else that tries to beat Chansey one-on-one.</p> <p>BoltBeam Chansey will always have to be careful maneuvering around Snorlax, as it doesn't have the tools to face Snorlax one-on-one; this is especially true for Snorlax that carry Rest. BoltBeam Chansey often wants to get paralyzed so it can avoid freezes and sleep, but this makes the Snorlax matchup even worse, and since it's such a threatening Pokemon to begin with, you may want to be careful with accepting Thunder Wave on your Chansey. Another tough matchup is Alakazam, which can easily sponge all of Chansey's attacks and retaliate with repeated Psychic that will eventually cause multiple Special drops and force Chansey off the field; even if Alakazam runs out of Psychic PP, it can often win an all-out PP stall. However, BoltBeam Chansey has a much happier time against the other common Psychic users due to super effective coverage on both Starmie and Exeggutor. Ice Beam also allows Chansey to win against non-Ice Beam Chansey thanks to the freeze chance, so long as the opposing Chansey isn't paralyzed — when it is, this matchup turns around, as Ice Beam's relatively low 16 PP will usually cause BoltBeam Chansey to lose the PP war.</p>"

        "Sing": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Sing is one of the premier Chansey sets. Although the high risk of missing may appear dangerous, Chansey is unlikely to take much punishment in return from any special attacker, so it is a common and successful strategy to simply switch Sing Chansey on a Pokemon like Starmie very early on and put it to sleep immediately. As Soft-Boiled is mandatory, using Sing leaves two moveslots open, usually to be filled with one attacking move and one utility move. The most common attacking move is Ice Beam, as the freeze threat is quite potent against most special attackers, which cannot harm Chansey all that much. However, running Ice Beam as your only damaging move leaves Chansey entirely toothless against Ice-types such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Lapras, so you may want to opt for Seismic Toss instead. As for the utility move, Thunder Wave is handy to cripple various threats, most notably physical attackers that pose an urgent threat to Chansey but really dislike being paralyzed, such as Tauros. Counter, on the other hand, is a specific tool to take care of Snorlax. Due to Chansey's gigantic HP stat, it will OHKO Snorlax after taking a single Body Slam, which is Snorlax's go-to STAB move and main way to damage Chansey. Once Counter is revealed, Snorlax can use moves that Counter can't reply to, such as Earthquake and Ice Beam, and then switch out to a more appropriate check; this means that it is of vital importance for Chansey to land its Counter the first time it uses it, as getting any mileage out of it in the rest of the game is going to be quite unlikely.</p> <p>Sing Chansey's dream scenario is to switch in on a Turn 1 Thunder Wave, allowing it to neutralize incoming sleep moves for the rest of the game, and immediately firing off Sing to achieve what is essentially a full Pokemon advantage due to RBY's notorious sleep mechanics. This threat means Sing Chansey is a strong antimeta pick, as it is commonplace for leads such as Starmie and Alakazam to want to use Thunder Wave in the first turn of the game. However, this strategy is very well known, especially at higher levels of play, so expecting opponents to use Thunder Wave on the first turn may result in heartbreak. Should these types of mindgames not appeal to you, it is also possible to hide Chansey's Sing until later in the game, attempting to bluff a different set and catch a more valuable target than you otherwise would have; however, this is largely reliant on hitting your very first Sing, which is only a 55% chance, as the surprise factor will be blown afterwards.</p> <p>It should be mentioned that Sing Chansey can also function as a lead; although its matchup against faster sleepers such as Gengar, Jynx, and Exeggutor is abysmal, it is able to comfortably land a Sing when facing common leads such as Alakazam and Starmie.</p>"
        },
        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Reflect halves the damage received from physical attacks, patching up Chansey's biggest weakness. Soft-Boiled is a necessity to allow Chansey to check threats and stay healthy throughout the game. Thunder Wave is necessary to punish any Tauros that may attempt to ruin your fun by negating Reflect with a critical hit; it's also generally strong utility and one of the most threatening tools in Chansey's arsenal. Seismic Toss is the preferred move to deal damage, as it hits for a consistent 100 HP, but Ice Beam, while resisted by many Pokemon, still threatens a deadly freeze on everything other than Ice-types. If you choose to rely on Ice Beam as your only attacking move, you will have to be careful not to paralyze Pokemon such as Starmie, as Chansey loses all offensive pressure against it without the possibility to freeze it.</p> <p>Reflect Chansey is one of the best early- and mid-game pivots, while also retaining good enough one-on-one matchups to remain a threat in the later stages of the game. This set's biggest selling point is the ability to switch into Snorlax's Body Slam without having to fear paralysis, allowing it to always set up Reflect, heal off all the damage with Soft-Boiled, and then safely chip away at the opposition via Seismic Toss. An important decision is going to present itself often when playing Reflect Chansey: letting it take a Thunder Wave will make it immune to freezes, allowing it to take on Ice Beam Chansey and win the PP war as well as making it a reliable answer to Exeggutor since it won't have to fear Sleep Powder anymore; however, this will make Chansey much less effective at switching in on Snorlax, and other threats such as Rhydon will also have a much better time against it. Managing the status of your Reflect Chansey is extremely important, and making the right decisions can often swing the tides of the game in your favor. It should be mentioned that a paralyzed Reflect Chansey will also have much more trouble facing Psychic-types due to the 30% chance of dropping its Special via Psychic; it is relatively easy for one of them to accumulate two or more drops and force it to switch out, thus removing Reflect and significantly weakening its effectiveness against physical threats for the rest of the game, unless it is given the free turns to set it up again.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Tangela is generally considered good in the current metagame</p> <hr /> <h3>Overview</h3> <p>Upon first glance, it may be difficult to ascertain why any player would even consider using Tangela in a competitive match. It has very little offensive presence, a limited movepool, and a Speed lower than even Vaporeon. It is also quite vulnerable to Wrap users and Ice-type moves, both of which are rather common in the tier. It makes sense that Tangela was first perceived as little more than a gimmick.</p> <p>While Tangela is still far from a staple, it has begun to establish itself in the tier because it compresses a precise combination of desirable traits. For starters, the pure Grass typing makes Tangela a strong check to Earthquake users like Dugtrio and Golem without picking up a weakness to Rock Slide. It similarly prepares Tangela to check Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu. Sleep Powder is a blessing in a tier where the few other sleep inducers largely rely on the rather inaccurate Hypnosis, making Tangela more reliable and freeing up Hypnosis users to explore alternative sets and play more aggressively. Additionally, Tangela's access to Stun Spore lets it stymie opposing sweepers and Wrap users, such as Dugtrio and Tentacruel, while also enabling friendly sweepers and Wrap users. Stun Spore is also notable for being the only move that can paralyze Dugtrio behind a Substitute. Finally, while it is not on the level of defensive staples like Vaporeon and Omastar, Tangela can be a makeshift check to a lot of common sweepers when at full health. Normal-type Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Persian usually win the matchup but tend to fear paralysis. Tangela does not fit on every team by any means, but its unique combination of defensive and supportive traits can make it the perfect choice on a select few, rather potent teams.</p> <p>Even with all of these positives, Tangela still has many flaws and can be easily exploited by many Pokemon. Tangela's extremely low Speed makes it easy to chip down with Wrap and revenge kill. Its Grass typing also leaves it vulnerable to Ice-type moves from the likes of Articuno and the tier’s many Water-type Pokemon, as well as Dodrio’s Drill Peck. Poor offensive options also leave it nearly unable to touch some Pokemon, including Dragonite, Haunter, and other Grass-type Pokemon. Finally, Sleep Powder's and Stun Spore's imperfect accuracy can occasionally mean the difference between a win and a loss. Thus, Tangela should only be used when its unique role compression cannot be replicated by other team members.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>By far the most enticing option in Tangela’s toolkit is a Swords Dance set with Body Slam, Hyper Beam, or both. However, boosting is really difficult in RBY UU, especially when neither Speed nor a defensive stat is rising. Moreover, Tangela’s Attack stat and physical movepool are dismal, making such a set underwhelming even in ideal conditions.</p> <p>When experimenting with different sets for Tangela, generally refrain from removing Tangela's status moves, especially Sleep Powder. This keeps it from being outclassed by other defensive Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Once Tangela uses Stun Spore against Haunter, it is virtually incapable of further threatening it. Haunter resists or is immune to every single move Tangela can learn. Even if Tangela somehow maximizes its Special with Growth, Mega Drain can only sometimes score a 4HKO. Haunter, on the other hand, scores an easy 4HKO with Night Shade or a 5HKO or better with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: All of the tier’s prominent Flying-type Pokemon threaten Tangela. Much like Haunter, Dragonite is simply not afraid of any move that Tangela can throw at it. Dragonite can use its superior Speed to work Tangela’s health down with Wrap and easily put it away with Blizzard or any powerful physical attack, possibly even leaving the entire exchange unscathed. Articuno similarly fears none any of Tangela’s attacks, and its incredibly strong Blizzard boasts an impressive 51.3% chance to simply OHKO Tangela. The rare Moltres functions nearly identically and takes even less from Mega Drain. Dodrio does fear paralysis and doesn't have Wrap to avoid getting hit like Dragonite, but it can easily revenge kill Tangela, as Drill Peck is a clean 2HKO. Gyarados has the least desirable matchup of the Flying-type Pokemon but can still 2HKO with Blizzard provided Tangela doesn’t reclaim too much health with Mega Drain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-, Bug-, and Fire-type Pokemon</strong>: While these Pokemon are a fair deal less common than the Pokemon discussed above, they still check Tangela thoroughly. While it admittedly can’t do much in return, Venusaur shrugs off virtually any hit Tangela can throw at it. Venomoth likewise takes very little damage from Tangela and can threaten paralysis or possibly 5HKO with Psychic. Yet again, Pinsir is unafraid of Tangela’s moves and can pivot out with Bind, set up with Swords Dance, or 3HKO it outright with Slash. Fire-types, while exceedingly uncommon, will check Tangela and claim 2HKOs or OHKOs with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Outside of Articuno and Dragonite, Tangela can beat most users of Ice-type moves with status or Mega Drain. However, every major user of Blizzard or Ice Beam aside from Omastar is faster than Tangela and thus can pressure it, especially if it has taken a few hits or hasn't used Growth yet. So long as these Pokemon aren't paralyzed, they are capable of revenge killing Tangela or even winning one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: While Tentacruel would prefer not to risk getting paralyzed, it is more than capable of handling Tangela. Like Dragonite, Tentacruel can easily whittle Tangela down with Wrap and finish it off with a powerful Blizzard.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Defensive Pivot": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set allows Tangela to function as a pivot. Sleep Powder and Stun Spore are more or less essential to any variant of Tangela. These two moves give it a significant amount of utility, allowing it to punish switch ins and enable its teammates to sweep. Even with Bind, Tangela is largely outclassed by other prominent Dugtrio checks like Dragonite and Gyarados if it chooses not to run both status moves. Bind functions just like Wrap, albeit with slightly lower accuracy, dealing chip damage and generating safe switches. Due to Tangela's low speed, Bind is most useful against paralyzed targets, though Tangela can usually afford to take a hit before using Bind if it must. Body Slam is very weak from Tangela, but it hits most targets neutrally and threatens paralysis. Mega Drain is similarly weak, but can hit a few targets for super effective damage and get Tangela a little health back in the process. Omastar and Golem are particularly fearful of Mega Drain, which is likely to 2HKO both. Rest serves to make Tangela a more complete wall but makes it even less offensively threatening. Due to Tangela having essentially no offensive presence with Rest, it may be worth running Body Slam or Mega Drain over Bind.</p>"
        },
        "Defensive Growth": {"description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set is a slightly more offensive take on the traditionally defensive Pokemon. Growth slowly boosts both Tangela's offensive and defensive prowess. While some Pokemon like Dragonite and Haunter are still not fazed by Tangela’s offenses, this set can bully some defensive Pokemon. Examples include Hypno and Vaporeon, especially if they have been paralyzed; unless they can land a critical hit, Tangela is relatively free to boost with Growth while both dealing damage and regaining health with Mega Drain. The threat of Stun Spore crippling a teammate pressures these Pokemon from switching out. Sleep Powder is always a useful move and allows Tangela to accomplish something even when it can’t quite get going with Growth. Moreover, after successfully using Sleep Powder, Tangela can use Stun Spore to potentially punish a switch-in looking to keep Tangela from setting up with Growth.</p>"}

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Kangaskhan is generally considered good in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Kangaskhan is one of the strongest Normal-type attackers in RBY UU, featuring a wide arsenal of attacking options that help it excel as the tier's most terrifying wallbreaker. Fitting on many offensive teams, it can blow past any Pokemon with Hyper Beam from around 60% HP. It has great coverage too: even the dreaded Articuno, which it outspeeds, is 2HKOed by Rock Slide. The damage that Kangaskhan dishes out is enough to knock many Pokemon into KO range for revenge killers like Dugtrio—if it doesn't just KO them outright—making defensive threats like Vaporeon and Hypno very wary. It is an extremely difficult Pokemon to switch into, arguably having no counters. Not only that, Kangaskhan has incredible physical bulk, allowing it to take minimal damage from Wrap and serve as a minor check to Dugtrio. Kangaskhan is quite customizable for teams as well, possessing interesting options such as Counter.</p> <p>Despite these incredible positives, Kangaskhan isn't an automatic addition to teams. Its special bulk is simply horrific, leaving it at least possibly 2HKOed by many of the strong special attacks thrown around in the tier, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Tentacruel's Surf. Worse still, it falls short in Speed, being slower than tier-king Tentacruel; factoring in its special fragility, this leaves it easily revenge killed. These factors make Kangaskhan sweeping on its own quite rare, so it will often be reserved to exploiting slower, sleeping, or paralyzed Pokemon.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute is notable, as Kangaskhan's 103 HP Substitutes can tank Night Shade from Haunter, as well as Seismic Toss from Hypno and Kadabra, while easing prediction. However, they will normally default to other moves, such as Thunder Wave or Hypnosis, making the option largely moot. Surf allows Kangaskhan to 2HKO Golem and 3HKO Aerodactyl but has no utility otherwise. Kangaskhan can amp up its damage output with Double-Edge to 3HKO Hypno—or even Mega Kick to 3HKO Vaporeon—but whatever move gets replaced will often be sorely missed; replacing Body Slam makes Kangaskhan far more reliant on paralysis support, and eschewing coverage is generally not advised.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis is the main obstacle to Kangaskhan's success, as it aims to take advantage of slower Pokemon like Vaporeon, as well as paralyzed Pokemon, and tear them down. Paralysis not only makes such interactions impossible but also exposes Kangaskhan's awful special bulk. Pokemon like Articuno, Gyarados, Omastar, Vaporeon, and Venusaur blow paralyzed Kangaskhan away with their strong STAB moves. As such, paralysis inducers such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Hypno are to be avoided unless Kangaskhan is in a position where it can KO them first. There will be many times where Kangaskhan will KO something mid-game and subsequently be forced out by one of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: Tentacruel outspeeds Kangaskhan and has an 82% chance to 2HKO it with Surf. Furthermore, Tentacruel is capable of chipping Kangaskhan into 2HKO range with just one Wrap use, which is what makes the Speed factor so dangerous; while Kangaskhan is absolutely capable of using Earthquake to 2HKO Tentacruel, it cannot do so quickly enough without Tentacruel being paralyzed first or happening to miss Wrap. Even then, Tentacruel may simply go for the Surf 2HKO, as the odds aren't terrible with even a little chip damage. It should be noted that Kangaskhan's Hyper Beam deals more damage than Earthquake, and can KO Tentacruel from 56.4% or less.</p> <p><strong>Tangela</strong>: Tangela isn't afraid of switching into Kangaskhan, not even fearing a critical hit Hyper Beam. Not only does it shrug off these generally nuclear blows, but it can also threaten with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore in return, both of which put an end to Kangaskhan's rampage. Furthermore, if Kangaskhan has been put to sleep, Tangela sets up Growth with impunity, making its Mega Drain noticeably more threatening. Finally, with Bind, Tangela can exploit paralyzed Kangaskhan relatively well, chipping it into KO range and pivoting to its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: If Kangaskhan lacks Rock Slide, Articuno is a very deadly threat to its success. Even Ice Beam from Articuno can 2HKO it, and Blizzard makes it impossible to switch Kangaskhan into anything later. If Kangaskhan does have Rock Slide, Articuno is threatened with a 2HKO, though Kangaskhan will be damaged heavily by Blizzard in the process. Without Rock Slide, Kangaskhan can only win with a critical hit Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam. If Articuno has set up Agility and hasn't been damaged, even Rock Slide Kangaskhan cannot win without getting extremely lucky.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: Kangaskhan's wallbreaking prowess comes back to bite it with Counter's existence. There will be many points where a Kangaskhan user has to check for Counter by using Earthquake to force it to fail. Pokemon like opposing Kangaskhan, Hypno, and Poliwrath are occasionally seen using the move. Should Kangaskhan trigger Counter, it will take significant damage. There is also the risk of a Pokemon switching in on Hyper Beam and countering the damage the next turn, which may deal fatal damage.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: While it fears Blizzard, Rock Slide, and Body Slam paralysis, Dragonite can switch into Kangaskhan's STAB moves comfortably. In return, it can threaten with Thunder Wave or a 3HKO from its own Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Aerodactyl</strong>: Aerodactyl is the only Pokemon in the game to resist the combination of Normal- and Ground-type coverage; if Kangaskhan's fourth move doesn't cover it, it becomes a serviceable check. Aerodactyl can use Fire Blast to attempt to burn Kangaskhan in this situation, which is a death sentence if it works. The damage isn't small either; it's a guaranteed 4HKO. However, if Kangaskhan does cover Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Rock Slide, it's generally fine. The risk of Body Slam paralysis is very large for Aerodactyl, which makes it very risky to check Kangaskhan with it.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Wallbreaker": {
          "description": "<p>The combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam will KO Electabuzz, Persian, and Dugtrio. Furthermore, Hyper Beam alone will OHKO Kadabra, and it has a minute chance to OHKO Dugtrio. Body Slam is crucial for Kangaskhan's success outside of damage, as paralyzing a switch-in will often lead to Kangaskhan beating it outright. Earthquake covers Haunter and Omastar, which are 2HKOed and 3HKOed. It further covers Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu as well, which are also 2HKOed. Lastly, Earthquake makes it much easier for Kangaskhan to scout for Counter users like opposing Kangaskhan and Poliwrath, which can be the difference between winning or losing the game.</p> <p>Kangaskhan's fourth move is largely dependent on its team and what threats the player wants it to cover. No option is truly better than the other. Rock Slide will 3HKO Gyarados and Aerodactyl as well as 2HKO Articuno, the latter of which otherwise wins consistently due to its nuclear Blizzard. Counter enables Kangaskhan to use its high HP to check Normal-type attackers, heavily deterring the use of moves like Body Slam, Hyper Beam, and Slash. It also gives Kangaskhan some extra utility, as switching into Hyper Beam and countering during the recharge can be a very strong tactic. Blizzard acts as coverage for Dragonite, 2HKOing it; however, Kangaskhan should be wary of taking a Thunder Wave if attempting this. Blizzard also 3HKOes Aerodactyl, Tangela, and Golem, the latter of which takes more damage than it would from Earthquake. It should not be used against Venusaur or Victreebel, as they take more damage from Body Slam.</p> <p>Kangaskhan is a wallbreaker at heart and should mostly be kept to this role. Kangaskhan is one of the best ways to punish Rest in the tier, and taking advantage of this is often key to its success: it's capable of 3HKOing even Hypno with two Body Slam uses followed up by Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Body Slam can 3HKO it a third of the time anyway. Similarly, a paralyzed Kadabra attempting to use Recover provides Kangaskhan with the perfect opportunity to switch in for free and threaten to OHKO it with Hyper Beam. Switching in on Seismic Toss against paralyzed Hypno or Kadabra is also valid, as they're forced to take a heavy hit from Kangaskhan. Kangaskhan is excellent at punishing greedy setup as well, switching in on Pokemon like Dodrio as they use Agility to completely reverse the game's momentum. It can also punish players looking to use Hyper Beam to finish Pokemon off early; Kangaskhan's amazing physical bulk allows it to switch in and punish the recharge with massive damage, even if it lacks Counter. It's good to switch Kangaskhan in after having a partner use Rest too, as players attempting to exploit the Rest will often switch in Pokemon like Persian and Dugtrio, which Kangaskhan excels against. The damage Kangaskhan can deal to a team is immense, so determining when it's appropriate to glean value from it early- to mid-game while avoiding paralysis is an important fundamental for players to learn.</p> <p>Kangaskhan appreciates paralysis support, as well as a reliable sleeper, though neither of these is necessarily required. Consequently, paralysis inducers such as Hypno, Dragonite, Kadabra, and Electabuzz are good partners. Kangaskhan pairs well with other sweepers—particularly those that are stonewalled by a particular Pokemon, including Articuno, Dugtrio, Dodrio, and Persian. Kangaskhan is very capable of overwhelming Pokemon like Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon, which typically stand in the way of at least one of these examples. Always remember to fine-tune teams in response to Kangaskhan's fourth move; for example, pairing Counter Kangaskhan with users of Explosion, such as Golem and Haunter, lets you smash a KOed Pokemon's replacement by countering your own Explosion. Haunter particularly pairs well, as it and Kangaskhan together can minimize Wrap's damage to a team by PP stalling it. Haunter also provides the aforementioned sleep support to shut down a potential check, such as Hypno or Kadabra. It can also lure in Pokemon that really don't want to fight Kangaskhan, like Dugtrio. Tangela is a suitable partner for its ease of spreading paralysis, good Dugtrio matchup, and amazing bulk allowing Kangaskhan to be significantly more aggressive. This role compression often gives space for more powerful Kangaskhan partners, such as Articuno and Dugtrio. Venusaur can act similarly to Tangela while further appreciating Kangaskhan's presence, as double switching to Kangaskhan punishes its usual Psychic-type switch-ins hard.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Kangaskhan is often labelled as a \"second Tauros\", and while Tauros is usually a better Normal-type attacker, Kangaskhan is not unusable and this label belies how differently it can act in practice. Kangaskhan is much more expendable during a game, fulfilling tasks that are normally too risky for the king of RBY OU. When compared with Tauros, Kangaskhan has some unique moves that make it more effective for this role as well, although they can be difficult to fit onto a set. For instance, Counter helps it oppose Normal-type attackers, and Mega Kick 2HKOes Chansey. Furthermore, Kangaskhan has formidable defensive bulk, which makes it more effective at switching into Body Slam, which cannot paralyze it.</p> <p>However, Kangakhan's hefty Normal-type competition does make it redundant on most teams. It has awful Special, completely failing to take strong neutral hits from Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Zapdos. Consequently, it's very challenging to switch Kangaskhan in against a lot of the tier, as one wrong move can mean significant damage; it often requires a double switch. Worse still, its Speed is just below what would be desirable to sweep, which makes it very reliant on extensive paralysis support to face these strong, fast special attackers. Overall, while Kangaskhan is not a replacement for Tauros by any stretch of the imagination, it retains a small niche when used alongside it, forming a strong wallbreaking core.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Kangaskhan's fourth moveslot is the most flexible, and it has a movepool to make use of it. Substitute is an interesting option to relieve prediction because Kangaskhan's HP gives it 103 HP Substitutes, just like Rhydon. This makes Kangaskhan a difficult adversary for Chansey, forcing it to use Seismic Toss twice to break its Substitute. However, Kangaskhan is vulnerable to paralysis throughout these interactions due to Substitute not blocking status in RBY, so it should only be attempted if Chansey is already paralyzed as well. Mega Kick is a valid option for 2HKOing Chansey, Starmie, and Tauros, but it can be difficult to fit into a set, and a miss often leads to Kangaskhan's demise. Rock Slide is another tempting option, allowing Kangaskhan to 2HKO Articuno and Jynx as well as 3HKO Zapdos 47.1% of the time, but it is very matchup-reliant. Thunderbolt is another valid option strictly for beating Cloyster, with two hits putting it in KO range for Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Thunder can 2HKO it after Body Slam.</p> <p>Kangaskhan is capable of using Counter to check Snorlax and Tauros, making them liable to KO themselves if they use Body Slam. Counter also lets Kangaskhan switch in on Hyper Beam, take it very well, and KO the user while it recharges. However, Kangaskhan's exploitable Special makes it deceptively difficult to find situations where Counter can be used. For instance, Kangaskhan is one of the few Pokemon where it's optimal for Tauros to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam before using Hyper Beam. Kangaskhan even takes relatively high damage from Ice Beam Snorlax. With the two most relevant targets for Kangaskhan's Counter being fully capable of scouting for it, it requires patience to pull off.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Special Attacks</strong>: The main reason Kangaskhan doesn't see much high-level usage is because of how awful its Special is. Many Pokemon in RBY OU, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and more, will 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, few of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Body Slam, as getting paralyzed or critically hit could let Kangaskhan subsequently blast them away with Hyper Beam. Bulkier special attackers like Slowbro and Lapras don't mind Hyper Beam much, though, and can often muscle past Kangaskhan with their STAB moves. Zapdos deserves a special mention for being immune to Earthquake and threatening a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: While Kangaskhan loves facing paralyzed Pokemon, this also means it wants to avoid paralysis itself. Ergo, Kangaskhan will often find itself being forced out by paralysis inducers like Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Chansey, at least if it can't KO them first. If Kangaskhan is paralyzed, it becomes significantly more vulnerable to 2HKOs from special attackers like Exeggutor and Lapras. Ideally, Kangaskhan should only get paralyzed if it's a do-or-die situation.</p> <p><strong>Tauros Checks</strong>: Due to the dominance of Tauros in RBY OU, the tier is already well-equipped for dealing with Kangaskhan. Cloyster has amazing physical bulk, which makes it difficult for Kangaskhan to break past. Even Thunder is only a 3HKO, while Cloyster has an 84.7% chance to 2HKO in return with Blizzard and can recover the damage with Rest. However, Cloyster dislikes switching into Body Slam due to the potential paralysis making it difficult for it to utilize Clamp later on. To Kangaskhan's credit, it's capable of breaking past Cloyster with Thunderbolt or Thunder, although this isn't reliable. Slowbro possesses the physical bulk to trade blows with Kangaskhan, effortlessly paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and get Amnesia boosts on it. However, a Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan will KO it from 44.2% on a maximum damage roll, so it can be a high-variance matchup. Reflect Snorlax is another thorn in Kangaskhan's side, shrugging off anything thrown at it and forcing Kangaskhan out. Kangaskhan can try to use Counter on Body Slam, but this is somewhat predictable. Exeggutor can stomach most attacks from Kangaskhan and 2HKO with Psychic in return. Finally, Starmie is faster than Kangaskhan, can paralyze it, and 2HKOes with its special move of choice.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is Kangaskhan's main STAB move, spreading paralysis and ensuring that nothing can switch in for free. A STAB Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan should never be underestimated, KOing most Pokemon from around 65%, including Chansey and Jolteon. Plus, it can KO Alakazam if it's taken minimal chip damage. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar and Jolteon, but it also helps with scouting for Counter users like Chansey and Snorlax. Surf prevents Rhydon from walling Kangaskhan, 2HKOing it. It should be noted that Kangaskhan takes middling damage from Rhydon's Body Slam and can't be paralyzed by it, making it a very valuable point of entry.</p> <p>Despite Kangaskhan's \"second Tauros\" title, it should not be forgotten that it is both a mid-game utility attacker—think Snorlax—and a capable revenge killer, particularly against paralyzed teams. Once Kangaskhan has safely entered the field, it's challenging to switch into due to its coverage and the threat of paralysis from Body Slam, so scouting with the latter should be its main aim. Kangaskhan is very capable of scouting for Counter users thanks to its coverage, so it's good to be patient and settle for Earthquake against Pokemon that carry it, such as Chansey. Remember that Kangaskhan is extremely specially frail, so it should ideally only fight special attackers if they are paralyzed. Even then, it will rely heavily on being eased in through double switches, sleeping Pokemon, and Explosions.</p>"

Horsea also has access to Smokescreen, which makes it much harder for Seaking to reliably set up Agility in front of Horsea and sweep. However, Horsea is much frailer and weaker than Seaking, notably being 2HKOed by Slash from Scyther and Pinsir and Thunderbolt from every relevant user. It is also always KOed by Fearow's Double-Edge into Hyper Beam, and it is 3HKOed by Seaking's Double-Edge and Drowzee's Psychic. This frailty makes it much harder for Horsea to set up Agility compared to Seaking, which has enough bulk to reliably set up and sweep. Horsea's Speed is also poor before it sets up, only outspeeding the likes of Drowzee, Vileplume, and Porygon. Being entirely worse than Seaking means it must not be used as a replacement to Seaking, but as a partner to it. The combination of Horsea and Seaking stacks weaknesses to Staryu and Gastly; Staryu is especially problematic as even Double-Edge Seaking struggles to beat healthy Staryu without a critical hit and Horsea is completely useless into Staryu unless it manages to freeze it.

Surf gets many Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen, into KO range of a strong revenge killer, such as Fearow or Scyther. Blizzard 2HKOes Fearow, Dragonair, and Scyther and 3HKOes Vileplume. It can also let Horsea get a lucky freeze on the likes of Staryu or Seaking if desperate. Agility lets Horsea outspeed everything and win many matchups it would otherwise lose, such as against Fearow, Nidoqueen, and Scyther, though it's hard to find setup opportunities. Smokescreen lets Horsea prevent Seaking from using Horsea as setup fodder. Smokescreen can also be used when desperate, as it can let Horsea win poor matchups with enough luck or force a switch. Hydro Pump can be used in place of Surf, as it is much more powerful, notably 3HKOing Drowzee, Porygon, and Machamp.</p> <p>Horsea cannot be used as a replacement to Seaking; it has to be used alongside it, as Seaking entirely outclasses it. Horsea needs support to be able to deal with Staryu, so Pokemon such as Vileplume and Drowzee make good partners, as they can switch in and incapacitate Staryu with status moves. Seaking should be used early- to mid-game to break and chip down foes for Horsea to KO in the late game. Seaking fainting will likely cause the opponent to value their Staryu less, which will make them more likely to let it take paralysis or faint, making it easier for Horsea to clean. Staryu also makes a good partner to Horsea, as it can remove Seaking, which would otherwise threaten to set up and sweep in front of Horsea. Pokemon with high Special also give Horsea trouble, such as Gastly and Drowzee, so Pokemon that can handle them, such as Drowzee and Arcanine, make good partners for Horsea.</p>"

    "nu": {
      "outdated": true,
      "overview": "<p>Seadra is a potent attacker and late-game Agility sweeper in RBY NU that also happens to match up well against many \"Big 5\"—Mr. Mime, Clefable, Blastoise, Charizard, and Venomoth—structures, as these teams often use Nidoking, Golem, or Kabutops as their sixth Pokemon, all of which lose to Seadra. Seadra Speed ties Nidoking and outruns much of the tier, giving it solid matchups against most slower foes, and it can bypass paralysis with Agility to help against foes like Clefable and Wigglytuff. It's also one of the best Pokemon against a late-game Charizard sweep, as it survives a +2 Hyper Beam with ease. Seadra's passable bulk and high Special let it duel much of the tier and relieve some pressure from Blastoise, which is often stretched thin checking opposing Blastoise and Charizard. Thus, it can serve as a mid-game attacker and pivot to free up Blastoise—assuming the opposing Blastoise is put to sleep or otherwise handled—or it can act as a late-game cleaner, allowing players to use Blastoise heavily early-game and follow up with Seadra to close out the game.</p> <p>However, Seadra struggles horribly against the ubiquitous Blastoise, which it can only 5HKO with the inaccurate Hydro Pump, and Kingler, which it rarely 3HKOes with Hydro Pump or 4HKOes with Surf, but Kingler can easily set up Swords Dance and retaliate for massive damage. Seadra's Speed is great, but it's still outsped by Mr. Mime, Raticate, and Electrode, all of which usually beat it one-on-one; Venomoth also outspeeds it and can put it to sleep. While Seadra easily beats many foes one-on-one, it cannot switch into them; Nidoking and Kabutops beat Seadra if it has to switch into them, and Golem deals a big chunk of damage with Earthquake as well.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Seadra has few notable other options. Toxic can help it damage Blastoise, but unless it lands Toxic as Blastoise switches in, this is relatively ineffective; also, since Toxic turns to normal poison after switching out, the foe may be able to preserve Blastoise and send something else to finish off Seadra after a Seismic Toss or two. Smokescreen allows Seadra to fish for misses and can be combined with Toxic, but this is extremely luck-based and unlikely to work. Hyper Beam deals slightly more damage than Surf to Mr. Mime, but it's rarely worth the moveslot over Hydro Pump, which outdamages both moves without the drawback. It also can finish off Blastoise, but it deals a minimum of 23%, so it's only a little better than Hydro Pump. Blizzard is the best move to drop for Hyper Beam, as Exeggcute and Fearow are rare.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Blastoise</strong>: Blastoise completely shuts down Seadra, which does almost no damage to it. Worse still, Seismic Toss 4HKOes Seadra, 3HKOing it after slight chip damage, so Blastoise easily wins the matchup and is difficult to switch into. Blastoise can also safely fish for Body Slam paralysis twice and still 4HKO Seadra, so switching becomes even less safe.</p> <p><strong>Electrode</strong>: Electrode outspeeds Seadra and 2HKOes it, and its massive critical hit rate only skews the matchup further. Seadra can only rarely 2HKO Electrode with Hydro Pump, so even a healthy Seadra with Agility set up will usually lose.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Mr. Mime and Clefable both can beat or, at worst, heavily damage Seadra; Mr. Mime outspeeds and tenuously 2HKOes it with Thunderbolt, while Clefable is slower and 3HKOes it. However, Seadra has poor odds to 2HKO Mr. Mime with Hydro Pump and will usually need to hit Hydro Pump at least twice followed by a Surf to 3HKO Clefable. Clefable is a weaker check, as Seadra is faster and has better odds to win the matchup, but any chip damage puts the matchup squarely in Clefable's favor.</p> <p><strong>Venomoth</strong>: Venomoth outspeeds Seadra and can put it to sleep, preventing it from making much progress early-game. Seadra can only 3HKO Venomoth, so it's unlikely to avoid sleep.</p> <p><strong>Kingler</strong>: Kingler usually stops Seadra but is unable to switch into it. Kingler can set up on Seadra and KO it with +2 Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, while Seadra can only 4HKO Kingler with Surf or 3HKO it with Hydro Pump 37% of the time, which is effectively a mere 19% chance after accounting for accuracy.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Surf and Blizzard hit all targets except opposing Water-types— Surf 2HKOes Charizard, Ninetales, Nidoking, and Raticate, and it rarely 2HKOes Moltres, while Blizzard 2HKOes Exeggcute and Fearow. Hydro Pump 2HKOes Kabutops and gives Seadra the extra damage needed to KO Moltres after a Surf; it also gives it a chance to 2HKO Mr. Mime and Electrode and helps secure the 3HKO on Venomoth. Agility allows Seadra to shrug off paralysis and outspeed threats like Mr. Mime, Nidoking, and Charizard; if Seadra sets it up before securing a KO, it can land an extra hit or two before going down. Agility also enables it to sweep late-game against weakened teams after setting up against foes like Nidoking and Golem or against Fire-types.</p> <p>Seadra's typical gameplan is to wait for Blastoise to be removed, often by trading one's own Blastoise for it, then looking for an opportunity to get in against a slower foe and take it out. Against foes it cleanly 2HKOes, it can often set up Agility, allowing it to not only defeat the foe in front of it but also land an extra hit against revenge killers like Electrode, Mr. Mime, and Charizard. Similarly, it can be saved to clean up late-game, setting up Agility in front of a weakened foe and then tearing through its chipped opposition. If faster threats have been paralyzed, Seadra can win outright without setup; a paralyzed Charizard is no threat to it, and a paralyzed Mr. Mime will often fail to 2HKO it.</p> <p>Seadra is best used alongside other Water-types, like Blastoise and Kingler, to help overwhelm opposing Thunderbolt users and check Charizard. It exploits Ground-type Pokemon that are often used to protect their teammates from an Electrode sweep and should be used on teams looking for extra insurance against these threats, since Blastoise has a hard time with Nidoking and is already overtasked with checking opposing Charizard and Blastoise. Most teams with Seadra are extremely weak to Electrode, as they usually have Charizard and Blastoise as well. Charizard can be dropped for a Ground-type to cover this weakness. Seadra also easily pivots into Blizzard from Clefable or Nidoking and duels them, helping to protect Ground-type allies. Blastoise completely walls Seadra, so teams that can overwhelm Blastoise with attackers like Electrode, Nidoking, and Kingler help to enable it. Sleep inducers, like Venomoth and Exeggcute, can help to remove checks like Blastoise and Mr. Mime and spread paralysis to further enable Seadra.</p>"

    "tradebacksou": {
      "overview": "<p>With the addition of Swords Dance into its movepool, Seaking manages to function as a competent setup sweeper. With STAB Surf as an added bonus, it also blasts through common Hyper Beam switch-ins, such as Rhydon. Agility distinguishes Seaking from its competing Swords Dance users, as, even when paralyzed, it still poses a threat to sweep if the opposing team has been damaged. Once set up, Seaking can be a difficult Pokemon to stop, KOing frailer Pokemon such as Persian and Jolteon from over 75% HP with Hyper Beam. Seaking is decently sturdy as well, surviving two hits from Starmie's Thunderbolt and Alakazam's Thunder Punch a significant majority of the time, giving it more opportunities to set up than Kingler.</p> <p>However, Seaking has to use both Swords Dance and Agility to pose any threat to the opposition. With only Surf and a single physical attack in its attacking moveset due to this—most likely Hyper Beam or the middling Double-Edge—Seaking is not surpassingly rewarding either, struggling to break through bulky Pokemon like Reflect Chansey. It's also completely incapable of breaking through the common Gengar and is struck with Thunderbolt in return; the improved coverage of staples like Thunder Punch for Alakazam and Hypno does not help its case either. Seaking is rarely seen in Tradebacks OU by account of its committal nature and unexceptional reward, normally finding itself competing with Kingler, which, while lacking Agility, has far better damage output for the effort put in.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Double Dance": {
          "description": "<p>Swords Dance raises Seaking's Attack to acceptable levels, letting Hyper Beam land guaranteed OHKOs against Jynx and Alakazam, while Agility allows it to outrun the unboosted metagame and ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. A +2 Hyper Beam can also KO Pokemon such as Persian, Rapidash, Chansey, Jolteon, and Hypno if around 20% damage has been dealt prior. At +4, Seaking can OHKO Chansey, Hypno, Starmie, and even Tauros a third of the time. Surf covers Rock-types such as Rhydon, as well as dealing around 25% to Gengar, while also serving as an attack without a drawback.</p> <p>Seaking's movepool is barren but does have other options worth exploring; generally, it should always use a Double Dance set, or it's outclassed by Pokemon like Kingler. Blizzard is a plausible alternative to Surf for the freeze chance and 3HKOing Exeggutor and Zapdos, but the damage is otherwise unimpressive and it fails to OHKO Rhydon. Double-Edge, while having less drawback than Hyper Beam, is weak enough to largely diminish Seaking's threat level once set up. Hydro Pump may seem enticing, but it isn't compatible with the event-only Swords Dance, defeating its purpose.</p> <p>Seaking should commit to boosting only when it is possible to sweep. +4 Attack is needed to OHKO most Pokemon in the tier, and +2 Speed is needed to avoid being revenge killed by faster unparalyzed Pokemon. This amount of setup is daunting, but achievable. Seaking's bulk can withstand two hits from almost everything besides Razor Leaf or very strong Thunderbolts. Taking paralysis is also normally inconsequential in the process; thanks to its setup-heavy nature, Seaking is efficient as reapplying foes' Speed drops from paralysis if an opposing team has been riddled with it. Once Gengar, Electric-types, and Razor Leaf users are eliminated or confirmed to be absent, and extra-bulky Pokemon like Snorlax have taken a little damage, a single free turn can be all the opening Seaking needs to complete the three turns of setup needed to sweep. Against slower teams, Swords Dance can be all that's necessary to break through slower, bulkier Pokemon in Hypno, Chansey, and non-Reflect Snorlax variants. To achieve optimal conditions for a sweep, Seaking should be paired with consistent sleepers such as Jynx and Exeggutor, and Reflect Snorlax to check opposing Snorlax. Seaking is overwhelmed by Gengar, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electabuzz, so Jolteon can be a helpful partner to safely switch into their attacks, while Seaking in turn can check Ground-types like Rhydon in a pinch for Jolteon. Rhydon, Chansey, and Alakazam can also check these Pokemon by comfortably switching into Thunderbolt, though, depending on the coverage of those Seaking checks, these partners might struggle to consistently switch in.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Seaking’s high attacking stats, access to Agility, and excellent STAB make it one of the most fearsome sweepers in the tier. It is capable of blasting through many of PU's top Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen, Fearow, and Arcanine, as well as other common foes such as Rapidash, Scyther, and Graveler. Seaking's Water typing is also fantastic defensively, blessing it with important resistances to the common Fire- and Water-type attacks in the tier. Notably, it has few practical weaknesses; Magneton is the only common Pokemon to threaten Seaking with a super effective STAB move. Additionally, Seaking's defenses are high enough to fend off neutral attacks with relative ease. For example, it is only KOed by Fearow's Double-Edge followed up by Hyper Beam 29.8% of the time, and it always lives Scyther's Hyper Beam at +2. Furthermore, Seaking avoids a 2HKO from every non-STAB Thunderbolt user with the exception of Gastly, which only has a 10.7% chance to 2HKO. Seaking's excellent defensive profile means it can find many opportunities to set up Agility to alleviate its low Speed, and once it is set up, it is very hard to stop if its foe doesn't have the proper tools to take it down.</p> <p>Despite all of its positive traits, Seaking is held back by some poor matchups that prevent it from effortlessly sweeping. The most prominent of these matchups is Staryu; an unparalyzed Staryu can switch into Seaking and completely wall it barring critical hits. Gastly can also switch into Surf once per game and threaten it with both Thunderbolt and Hypnosis. Both Staryu and Gastly are very hard to switch into, so Seaking inviting them in for free can result in a huge loss of momentum. One less common but still dangerous foe that switches into Seaking is Magneton, which only takes up to 30.6% from Surf and threatens Seaking with Thunderbolt. These poor matchups mean that Seaking is typically reserved for the late-game, after its teammates wear down its checks. However, Seaking is lethal to unprepared teams, and the threat of a Seaking sweep should always be considered when building a team and in battle.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Other options are generally not recommended on Seaking. It can drop Surf and use a set consisting of Agility, Blizzard, Double-Edge, and Hyper Beam in order to handle both Fearow and Staryu, but it makes Seaking much worse against Fire-types and Gastly. Rest can be used to win one-on-one against opposing Seaking and in certain endgames against opposing Fire-types, but it is very easy to punish and seldom worth a moveslot. Seaking can also be a lead, as it matches up well against the two most common leads—Arcanine and Nidoqueen—but it typically invites Gastly and Staryu in early. However, this can also be exploited to pivot into a teammate such as Arcanine or Abra.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Staryu is without a doubt Seaking’s biggest counter. An unparalyzed Staryu can switch into Seaking then use Recover until it KOes itself from Double-Edge recoil. If Seaking uses Hyper Beam or Agility, Staryu can then paralyze it safely and continue to use Recover until it fully paralyzes. Seaking is also able to switch into itself well, and the face-off will typically result in the winning Seaking being at low enough HP that something can revenge kill it, although it will probably be able to fire off one more attack before being KOed if it set up Agility.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly outspeeds Seaking, is immune to its Normal-type moves, and can threaten threaten Seaking with Thunderbolt or Hypnosis. However, it is harder for Gastly to switch into Seaking at +2, as a critical hit Surf into Surf KOes Gastly.</p> <p><strong>Magneton:</strong> Magneton outspeeds Seaking, is 4HKOed by Surf, and 2HKOes in return with Thunderbolt. Magneton can also use Thunder, which has a 61.4% chance to OHKO Seaking.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Porygon is able to threaten paralysis while using Recover to heal off any damage it takes. Porygon can also use Agility to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, making it harder for Seaking to push through the Speed drop with Agility. Switching directly into an attack from Seaking is risky, though, as a critical hit Surf into Hyper Beam is guaranteed to KO Porygon.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Foes:</strong> Seaking without Blizzard is helpless against Dragonair, and even if Seaking is running Blizzard it’s still outsped and can be worn down with Wrap. Similarly, Seaking without Blizzard is helpless against Vileplume, giving it a good opportunity to come in and use Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Magmar</strong>: Although it is 2HKOed by Surf, Magmar is much better at handling Seaking compared to Arcanine and Rapidash. It outspeeds Seaking and can use either Confuse Ray or Smokescreen to give Seaking difficulty setting up, and Psychic's chance for a Special drop can severely weaken Seaking. Notably, Magmar avoids a 2HKO from Surf if it is able to drop Seaking's Special before its first attack.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Agility": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Surf is Seaking's strongest STAB move and hits a huge chunk of the tier super effectively, OHKOing Graveler and 2HKOing Nidoqueen, Arcanine, Rapidash, and Magmar. It 3HKOes most neutral targets as well, including Fearow, Gastly, and Porygon 95.1% of the time. Agility allows Seaking to function as a deadly sweeper. At +2, Seaking outspeeds every unboosted foe, letting it take advantage of its excellent attacking power. It also negates the Speed drop from paralysis, which allows Seaking to more easily set up on Fire-types that try to hit it with Body Slam. Seaking is also able to set up on Nidoqueen, Fearow, and Scyther. Hyper Beam is most commonly used to blast through Staryu; it does a minimum of 55.1%, and a critical hit Hyper Beam OHKOes Staryu. It also does more damage than Surf to Porygon, Drowzee, and Abra. Notably, a critical hit Surf puts Porygon into Hyper Beam range, but not Surf range. Blizzard 2HKOes Fearow and Scyther; Blizzard into Surf is also heavily favored to KO Fearow and pretty much guaranteed to KO Scyther. Blizzard is also able to hit Vileplume and Dragonair super-effectively, but these foes aren't very common. Alternatively, Seaking can equip Double-Edge to break through Staryu. Double-Edge into Hyper Beam has a 54.3% chance to KO it, but Staryu's access to Recover means Double-Edge is only effective at breaking through Staryu once it's paralyzed or if Seaking has already used Agility.</p> <p>Seaking should be saved for the late-game after Staryu and to a lesser extent Gastly and Magneton are accounted for. Once all of its threats are neutralized, Seaking is free to come in and attempt to sweep. It should have no trouble finding an opportunity to set up; it is able to set up Agility on Nidoqueen, Fearow, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Scyther. Once Seaking is set up, it can outright sweep or severely damage an opposing team to the point where its teammates can clean up. However, this may not always happen in practice, and sometimes Seaking is forced into its bad matchups. If the opponent still has a Gastly or Magneton remaining, it may be worth sacrificing Seaking for damage on these foes; two hits from Surf gets Magneton into guaranteed KO range of Fearow's Hyper Beam and Gastly into KO range of most of the tier, doing up to 80.6%. Against a healthy Staryu, Seaking is best off using Agility to outspeed it then fishing for a critical hit Hyper Beam, as Staryu can paralyze Seaking and use Recover to stall out Double-Edge. If Seaking has Blizzard, it is best to fish for a freeze first, then go for the Hyper Beam once it is in KO range from Staryu's Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Seaking's best teammates are ones that can wear down its checks early-game to enable it later. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine are all able to deal heavy damage to Seaking's strongest checks, Staryu and Gastly. All three have Agility to negate the Speed drop from Staryu's Thunder Wave, and the latter two can paralyze Staryu with Body Slam. In return, Seaking supports them by taking on opposing Fire-types, Nidoqueen, and Graveler, giving them great offensive synergy. Magneton is able to OHKO Staryu, making it a good teammate. Abra and Magmar also have good matchups against Staryu and Gastly, but their lack of Agility makes them more vulnerable to paralysis. Porygon is also an excellent teammate that can bait in Staryu and Gastly and paralyze them, making them easier for Seaking to handle later. Porygon, Magneton, Gastly and Staryu can also help handle opposing Seaking, which can otherwise trade hits with your own Seaking. Nidoqueen is also a good teammate that completely walls Magneton and functions as a Staryu lure; it sacrifices itself for damage on Staryu to make it easy for a teammate like Fearow to revenge kill. Graveler is also a great teammate that walls Magneton while also luring in Staryu. Although Staryu OHKOes Graveler, it will be in KO range from Fearow and the Fire-types if it switched into Earthquake, and Staryu cannot safely use Recover against Graveler due to the threat of Explosion.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Staryu's phenomenal movepool—complete with fantastic coverage, Recover, and most importantly, Thunder Wave—and good Speed make it a dangerous offensive threat and elite paralysis spreader. Its Water-type STAB moves and Speed dissuade Ground-types like Nidoqueen from switching into it, making its Thunder Wave extremely hard to deny. Staryu isn't just limited to spreading paralysis either—STAB Surf and great coverage let it hit most of the tier for neutral damage, and it can hit notable foes like Arcanine, Rapidash, Fearow, and the aforementioned Nidoqueen super effectively. Despite its extreme frailty, Staryu's access to Recover makes it PU's best answer to Seaking, as its typing and Recover wall it completely bar critical hits as long as it's unparalyzed.</p> <p>However, it is essential that players don't overestimate Staryu's defensive capabilities—barring Seaking, just about every common foe can reliably paralyze or 2HKO Staryu, if not both, making it very difficult for it to use Recover outside of when it faces Seaking. Once paralyzed, Staryu loses one-on-one to most foes, especially if it's weakened beforehand. Even Seaking can break through Staryu, as Double-Edge into Hyper Beam has a 54.3% chance to KO. Magneton also threatens Staryu immensely, as it OHKOes Staryu and is only 4HKOed in return by Surf. Staryu's offensive presence isn't perfect either, as while only a handful of Pokemon outspeed it, these include common foes like Fearow, which can KO Staryu after the slightest chip damage, and Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar, which can paralyze Staryu with Body Slam and KO it with Hyper Beam. Slower paralysis spreaders also give Staryu considerable trouble, as while they dislike paralysis, Dragonair can wall Staryu depending on its chosen coverage, Porygon can trade Thunder Wave with Staryu, as it is only 3HKOed by Surf 16.4% of the time and threatens Staryu in return with its coverage, and Drowzee can easily switch into Staryu and threaten it and its team with STAB Psychic and dual status. Staryu also has difficulty fitting all of the moves it wants. Alongside the obligatory STAB Surf and Thunder Wave, it has to choose between Thunderbolt and Psychic as well as Recover and Blizzard, leaving it unable to wall Seaking or threaten foes like Grass-types and Dragonair depending on its choice of coverage.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Hydro Pump can be used to hit higher damage ranges, notably 3HKOing Drowzee and Gastly, as well as having a chance to 3HKO Magneton, though it fails to KO most other foes faster than Surf and is much less reliable due to its shaky accuracy.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Given that Staryu is 2HKOed by much of the tier, once paralyzed, it's easy to take out. Even foes that can't 2HKO Staryu, like Seaking, can overwhelm it after one turn of full paralysis. Body Slam users like Rapidash and Arcanine can fish for paralysis while dealing solid damage, while Thunder Wave users like Porygon, Abra, and opposing Staryu can use Thunder Wave. However, these foes tend to hate taking paralysis themselves and usually dislike Staryu's STAB and coverage options. Dragonair also has access to Thunder Wave and is more than happy to exchange paralysis with Staryu, as it resists Surf + Thunderbolt and can use Agility. Slowpoke can switch into and threaten paralysis on Staryu lacking Thunderbolt, although it is rare and incredibly weak otherwise. Drowzee deserves a special mention, as it minds neither paralysis nor Staryu's attacks that much, only being 4HKOed by Surf, while it threatens Staryu and its team with not only Thunder Wave but also Hypnosis and a strong STAB Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Fearow's Double-Edge 2HKOes Staryu, and its Hyper Beam does a minimum of 81.7%. While Fearow dislikes Thunder Wave, it can negate the Speed drop by using Agility, and it's only reliably 2HKOed by Staryu's Blizzard. Although it cannot set up Swords Dance on Staryu, a +2 Scyther OHKOes it with Hyper Beam. Alongside threatening paralysis with Body Slam, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar outspeed Staryu and can KO it from around 60% using Hyper Beam. Abra outspeeds Staryu and threatens paralysis with Thunder Wave and a 2HKO with Psychic, though it generally despises taking paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Magneton OHKOes Staryu with Thunderbolt and is only 4HKOed in return by Surf. Magneton is also incredibly hard to switch into barring Ground-types, as it threatens paralysis and a strong STAB Thunderbolt on Staryu's teammates.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly 2HKOes Staryu with Thunderbolt and is only 3HKOed 75.3% of the time by Surf. It also threatens to sleep Staryu and its teammates with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types like Vileplume and the uncommon Weepinbell resist Surf and Thunderbolt and threaten Staryu with Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. Vileplume's enormous bulk leaves it only 3HKOed by Blizzard and generally 4HKOed by Psychic, while Weepinbell outright OHKOes Staryu with Razor Leaf.</p> <p><strong>Pinsir</strong>: While Pinsir dislikes taking paralysis, it 2HKOes Staryu with Slash and is only 3HKOed by Surf, meaning it comfortably beats it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Machamp</strong>: Staryu can only 4HKO Machamp without Psychic, and Psychic still only 3HKOes it. In return, Machamp 2HKOes with Submission and has a 69.6% chance to 2HKO with Earthquake, and its combination of Body Slam into Submission has high odds to KO Staryu while also threatening paralysis; Machamp dislikes paralysis, though it can still function regardless.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Thunder Wave is critical to Staryu's success, letting it spread paralysis to cripple foes like Rapidash, Porygon, and opposing Staryu. It pairs excellently with STAB Surf discouraging Ground-types from switching in; Surf 2HKOes Nidoqueen and OHKOes Graveler, and since Staryu outspeeds them, it wins one-on-one even if they switch into Thunder Wave. Surf also 2HKOes Fire-types like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar. Thunderbolt is Staryu's primary means of targeting opposing Water-types, notably 2HKOing opposing Staryu and 3HKOing Omanyte and Seaking, limiting the former's opportunities to paralyze Staryu and the latter pair's chances to fish for a critical hit; Thunderbolt also hits Fearow harder than most of Staryu's options, with a 25.6% chance to 2HKO. Psychic is an alternative, notably 3HKOing Gastly and Machamp. Its chance to drop the target's Special makes it threatening against most foes, acting as a strong midground option against Vileplume, as well as opposing Water-types and the rare Weepinbell. Recover lets Staryu effectively check Seaking, as it is a very safe option to use against it. However, it is risky to spam, as many threats like Rapidash and Arcanine can use it to fish for paralysis against Staryu, and using it predictably can allow free entry to foes like Fearow. Blizzard is a potential alternative if Staryu is paired with other Pokemon that can handle Seaking, such as Gastly and one's own Seaking, as it 2HKOes Fearow and Dragonair and 3HKOes Vileplume. It can also let Staryu fish for a freeze, though Staryu is generally better off paralyzing its targets.</p> <p>Staryu is PU's premier answer to Seaking; Seaking's Double-Edge fails to 2HKO and slowly wears Seaking down, and Hyper Beam only deals slightly over 50% and gives Staryu a free turn. If Seaking doesn't use Agility, Staryu outspeeds it, so it can spam Recover as Double-Edge's recoil brings Seaking into KO range. If Seaking uses Agility as Staryu uses Recover or switches in, Staryu can then paralyze it with Thunder Wave, forcing Seaking to use another Agility and giving Staryu potential free turns due to full paralysis. If Seaking is confirmed to not have Double-Edge, it is safe for Staryu to attack it instead of spamming Recover. A healthy Staryu only has to be afraid of Seaking getting a critical hit with Hyper Beam, which OHKOes it.</p> <p>Staryu's excellent matchup against Seaking makes it a good partner to teammates weak to Seaking, like Rapidash, Nidoqueen, and Arcanine. However, it cannot do this when it's paralyzed, and thus it enjoys teammates that can switch into Thunder Wave users, such as Drowzee, Magneton, and Nidoqueen. Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and Graveler make great partners for Staryu, as they wall Magneton, which otherwise gives Staryu great trouble, while also appreciating the paralysis Staryu spreads. Staryu also appreciates being partnered with strong physical wallbreakers like Fearow and Pinsir, which are especially adept at removing Drowzee, which otherwise switches into and threatens Staryu with Hypnosis and STAB Psychic with relatively little risk. While Staryu hates paralysis, in some instances it is necessary to be paralyzed, such as trading Thunder Wave with Porygon to enable Nidoqueen or exchanging paralysis with opposing Staryu to enable Seaking. Once paralyzed, Staryu loses virtually all of its defensive utility and is easily overwhelmed, but if it's at full health, it can still be threatening, as it's difficult to OHKO; it also stonewalls Omanyte, since the only thing it threatens Staryu with is paralysis. Staryu is dominated by Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine, as they outspeed and can KO a weakened Staryu, so Rock-types like Graveler for the first and Omanyte for all three work well as partners. Staryu also appreciates Rock-type teammates because it has poor matchups against Arcanine, Rapidash, and Magmar, which it can't switch into well and typicallloses one-on-one to.</p> <p>Staryu can be used at multiple points throughout a game, and its role changes depending on when it is used. It can be used early- and mid-game to revenge kill slower foes such as Nidoqueen; however, this puts it in a position to be revenge killed itself by faster foes such as Fearow and Arcanine, especially if it gets chipped. This means it cannot effectively check Seaking later on in the game. Staryu can be saved throughout the game and avoid getting chipped to effectively check Seaking, although this may exacerbate a team's weaknesses to Fearow and Magneton later on if Staryu's team lacks a healthy check to them.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Even with the nerf to its critical hit rate from 22.46% to 18.65%, Starmie is a prominent threat in Stadium OU thanks to its high Speed stat, which gives it the jump on the likes of Tauros, Zapdos and Gengar, as well as its ability to spread paralysis across the opposing team. Its access to a wide array of coverage moves means it can hit many important foes, such as Exeggutor and Slowbro, for super effective damage. On top of this, it has access to Recover, giving it extreme longevity. It also has better physical bulk than Alakazam and Chansey, which are its main competition for the role of paralysis spreader with recovery. Starmie has more flexibility in Stadium OU than standard OU, as it doesn't have to commit to the lead slot or a non-lead slot before seeing the enemy team thanks to the addition of team preview, allowing it to reactively choose a role as needed. The nerf to Hyper Beam in Stadium also works in Starmie's favor, as Tauros and Snorlax with Hyper Beam are less common than in standard OU; this makes them worse at pressuring Starmie.</p> <p>However, Starmie is completely unable to meaningfully threaten Chansey outside of paralysis and can't fit all the moves it wants to, as it only has 2 free moveslots after Thunder Wave and Recover. This means it either has to give up crucial coverage for foes such as Exeggutor and Slowbr or be unable to offensively pressure Pokemon that take neutral damage from Blizzard + Thunderbolt, such as Snorlax and Jolteon. Starmie is also ruined by paralysis, as it becomes far less offensively and defensively potent, making its job of spreading paralysis quite difficult to do without incurring paralysis itself. This also makes it extremely dangerous for it to switch into Tauros and Snorlax, as it risks getting paralyzed by Body Slam doing so.</p>",

Thunderbolt 2HKOes Cloyster, 3HKOes Slowbro and Starmie, and 3HKOes Lapras 57.1% of the time. Psychic is Starmie's primary STAB move, 2HKOing Gengar and effectively hitting neutral targets such as Jolteon, Snorlax, and Tauros. Its 33% chance to drop the foe's Special can also overwhelm common switch-ins, such as Chansey. Starmie can use Surf over Psychic, as it OHKOes Rhydon and Golem and hits neutral targets for slightly more damage than Psychic, notably always 2HKOing Snorlax with two critical hits; it also has far more PP than Psychic. However, Surf does not hit Gengar super effectively and can't drop the foe's Special. Using Surf alongside Ice-type coverage also means Starmie is walled by Lapras and Cloyster. Thunder Wave spreads paralysis across the opposing team, notably against foes such as Tauros, Chansey, and Persian. Starmie notably outspeeds Tauros and doesn't have to worry about Tauros blocking its paralysis with Substitute.</p> <p>Rhydon and Golem make good partners to Starmie, as they wall Zapdos and Jolteon, which otherwise threaten it immensely.

      "overview": "<p>Despite being an OU staple, Starmie struggles to find an impactful niche in Ubers outside of the lead slot. Both its offensive and defensive presence are outclassed by other Pokemon in the tier. Still, Starmie can be a serviceable lead in specific team compositions that benefit from extra paralysis. Its high Speed enables it to outpace much of the metagame and threaten damage or paralysis. Lead Starmie can inflict high damage on common early-game sleepers like Gengar and Exeggutor while also threatening freeze or paralysis on any switch-ins. Its best role is disrupting the opposing team’s sleepers by inflicting damage and status and then taking sleep for its teammates. Additionally, its bulk and recovery fares well against physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon, provided its teammates are able to eliminate opposing special walls like Mewtwo and Chansey. Starmie fits well into team compositions that benefit an additional fast Thunder Wave user, such as compositions with Rhydon, Tauros, Dragonite, and Thunderbolt Mewtwo.</p> <p>However, the roles described above can be filled by other, more reliable options. While Starmie combines paralysis threat with special offense, Pokemon such as Chansey and Exeggutor are better at spreading status, and Pokemon like Mewtwo and Slowbro are more potent special threats. Slowbro specifically is an excellent option over Starmie in any role outside of the lead. Both share the same typing, weaknesses, and access to Thunder Wave, but Slowbro's access to Amnesia allows it to better withstand Mewtwo's assault while simultaneously threatening to sweep the opposing team. Alakazam also competes for the same role as a paralysis spreader, though both have merits. Starmie has valuable physical bulk to take on Tauros and Snorlax while also being stronger against Exeggutor and Rhydon. Alakazam, meanwhile, is better into Zapdos and Gengar, can better threaten paralyzed Chansey due to its higher Special, and can use Seismic Toss to deal consistent damage to Amnesia users. Starmie cannot threaten Mewtwo or Mew with anything beyond paralysis, and Starmie will crumble if Mewtwo carries Thunderbolt. Starmie also possesses no reliable tools to force paralysis past Chansey, meaning if it fails to secure a freeze, Chansey can prevent Starmie from making any progress in the game. Thus, Starmie will often fail to do more than paralyze something and take sleep. While Starmie can serve as a decent special attacker and status spreader, many teams are better supported by Pokemon that are more committed to either role.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt is a tempting choice to replace Blizzard in order to punish Slowbro, which will frequently switch into Starmie without it. However, the loss of Blizzard makes Exeggutor extremely difficult to deal with, and also leaves Starmie toothless against Zapdos and Dragonite. Thunderbolt may also be tempting for potential Starmie mirrors, but Starmie is generally not used enough to make it worth the moveslot. Running Blizzard and Thunderbolt together simply leaves Starmie’s special offense minuscule without the benefit of STAB, and it cannot fight Gengar without Psychic.</p> <p>Surf or Hydro Pump could be considered over Blizzard or Psychic to empower Starmie as a special attacker, enabling slightly better damage ranges on neutral targets and scoring OHKOs on Rock / Ground types. Unfortunately, this will again leave Starmie unable to threaten either Gengar or Exeggutor, making these moves much more trouble than they are worth.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Mewtwo</strong>: Thunderbolt is a common option on Mewtwo, and it can guarantee an OHKO on Starmie after one Amnesia. Since Thunderbolt Mewtwo does not usually mind paralysis, there is little Starmie can do to threaten it, and it has no trouble setting up Amnesia and threating Starmie’s entire team. This is a hard counter, and Starmie must avoid this matchup at all costs.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Starmie struggles to progress through Chansey, and it can threaten status back. Sing variants will happily switch into Starmie and put it to sleep, putting Starmie in a difficult position to either paralyze Chansey or fish for a freeze. Non-Sing Chansey can still consistently switch into Starmie whenever it hits the field, enabling it to paralyze the Starmie and mitigate its threat all game.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>- Slowbro is both one of Starmie’s biggest checks and one of the most common choices instead of Starmie in the teambuilder for any position outside of the lead. Slowbro has the same typing, access to Thunder Wave, and Amnesia, which makes it simultaneously more threatening offensively and defensively. Slowbro will frequently enter the field once Starmie has revealed it lacks Thunderbolt, and it will take minimal damage doing so and set up Amnesia for free. Not only will Starmie not be able to threaten it, but it must switch to something that can force it off the field before it executes a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Jolteon</strong>: Although neither is comfortable switching into Starmie, STAB Thunderbolt from Zapdos and Jolteon is guaranteed to 2HKO Starmie and OHKOes with a critical hit. While Zapdos does take heavy damage from Blizzard, it still has a 19.53% chance to OHKO Starmie. Jolteon, although less commonly seen, is also faster than Starmie and can survive 2 non-critical attacks, making it the better check.</p> <p><strong>Non-STAB Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Although rare in the Ubers metagame, a stray Thunderbolt from Chansey, Lapras, or Dragonite is still a significant threat. One of the most reliable ways to dispatch a Starmie is to paralyze and threaten it with Thunderbolt. Gengar's Thunderbolt is particularly notable, as it can 2HKO Starmie and OHKO on a critical hit. Usually, Starmie's greater Speed keeps Gengar at bay, but if Starmie is paralyzed and Gengar is not, this matchup is turned to Gengar's favor. Gengar players also have the option to risk Starmie's Psychic in exchange for a chance at a Thunderbolt critical hit, but this risk is not statistically favored and is generally not a preferred option in the Ubers metagame.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: While Mew certainly doesn’t want to take paralysis early, in certain endgame states Mew can use Starmie to set up for a sweep. Starmie cannot threaten Mew once it’s paralyzed, so it depends on another teammate removing Mew. If nothing can come in and quickly threaten or remove the paralyzed Mew, Mew can set up Swords Dance and clear Starmie’s team.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Paralysis Lead": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Starmie’s primary role on any team is to act as a fast Thunder Wave user, as the goal of a Starmie team is to spread paralysis through the opponent’s team and open endgame sweepers. Outspeeding much of the metagame, Starmie can immediately paralyze an opponent’s sleep lead and any potential switch-ins. However, the early paralysis can make it more difficult to secure sleep, so lead Starmie should be used on teams that prioritize paralysis over sleep or have a plan to push sleep past a paralyzed Chansey. Recover supports its role as a paralysis spreader and helps it take on physical attackers. Once it paralyzes the foe, Starmie will usually outspeed and be able to heal off damage.</p> <p>Psychic is a guaranteed 2HKO against Gengar and is capable of an OHKO on a critical hit, making this move essential on a lead Starmie set. Gengar is one of the most common leads in the Ubers metagame, and Starmie’s primary role in the lead slot is to force Gengar off the field, giving the Starmie user the option to attack, immediately use Thunder Wave, or double switch to a sleeper and induce sleep to grab momentum. Further, Psychic is Starmie’s best option to muscle past a paralyzed Chansey, as consecutive Special drops can force a switch, allowing a chance to spread paralysis onto one of Chansey's teammates. Combined with Starmie’s significant 22.46% critical hit chance, STAB Psychic can deal significant damage to neutral targets; it will normally 3HKO Tauros and 4HKO Snorlax, and it can 2HKO both with the aid of critical hits and Special drops.</p> <p>Blizzard is Starmie’s best choice for a fourth move when operating as a lead. Blizzard threatens a 3HKO on both Exeggutor and Zapdos, which are common partners to Gengar and are sometimes leads themselves. The damage on Exeggutor is especially significant, as this prevents Exeggutor from getting sleep for free, as it will take massive damage and risk freeze if it tries to fight Starmie. Blizzard also has a 38.5% chance to OHKO Dragonite, bolstered further by critical hit and freeze chances. A sleeping Starmie can attempt to wake on Dragonite using Wrap and threaten significant damage. However, unlucky wake attempts can be punished by the opposing team switching in potent threats for free, so this strategy must be used sparingly. Further, Blizzard can allow Starmie to fish for freeze early-game, potentially scoring a massive advantage in the opening. While Ice Beam could be considered for better freeze fishing due to higher accuracy and PP, the drop in damage is significant, as 3HKOs on Exeggutor and Zapdos are no longer guaranteed. The major drawback to freeze fishing is that it delays or prevents Starmie from spreading paralysis, which is more consistent. Since its role is primarily a paralysis spreader, Blizzard is usually chosen for the damage on the above targets.</p> <p>If Starmie does not take sleep early, Thunder Wave can allow it to switch into common threats and deal paralysis back. Mew, Tauros, and Dragonite, specifically, are slower than Starmie and do not appreciate paralysis, so Starmie can often force them off the field. A healthy Starmie can be a valuable check to Tauros, preventing it from breaking open the team. Starmie must be careful of taking paralysis from Body Slam or Thunder Wave, but it can still usually fire off Thunder Wave and outspeed again, allowing it to use Recover more effectively. However, offense in Ubers is more potent than in OU, and Starmie must be wary of threats that outpace Recover—Thunderbolt from Zapdos, Gengar, and Mewtwo is the most notable danger, but Swords Dance Mew can be equally threatening. Mew has a near-guaranteed 2HKO with +2 Earthquake. Once Explosion users have been cleared, Mew and Mewtwo can set up freely while Starmie cannot threaten them beyond paralysis. Once they have set up, they can easily clear through a paralyzed Starmie and win the game. Thus, Starmie is much less effective late-game, so it is greatly preferred to have it take sleep.</p> <p>It is best to pair Starmie with teammates that can take advantage of the opposing team being paralyzed. As special walls like Chansey will often switch in to stop Starmie's progress, physical attackers can take advantage of the now-paralyzed Chansey and force damage onto the opposing team. Pokemon like Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon are able to 2HKO a paralyzed Chansey, so they are great at removing it to allow teammates to spread status onto further targets. The slow, offensive ground types, such as Rhydon and Sandslash, make natural partners to Starmie. Their Ground typing is appreciated to cover Starmie’s weakness to Thunderbolt, and Starmie’s Blizzard can weaken Exeggutor early and prevent it from walling them. Further, the opponent’s Mewtwo and Chansey often do not carry both Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, meaning one of the two will generally provide chances to gain momentum. Starmie and Rhydon together can be used to target the common Gengar + Zapdos team core; Starmie will generally force Gengar off the field early-game and paralyze the incoming Chansey, allowing Rhydon to cover the Zapdos threat and sweep late-game.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Starmie is one of the most common Pokemon in RBY OU thanks to its Psychic typing and access to Recover and Thunder Wave. Starmie's physical bulk allows it to be a defensive check to virtually every Pokemon lacking an Electric-type attack and take two hits from almost any physical attacker. Additionally, its access to many special attacks such as Blizzard, Psychic, and Thunderbolt turns it into an offensive threat versus anything without instant recovery. Although Starmie naturally outspeeds many common Pokemon, most notably Tauros, oftentimes a paralyzed Starmie functions well in its defensive role due to its ability to block sleep-inducing moves from almost anything, while the ability to paralyze any non-Ground-type Pokemon via Thunder Wave makes it difficult to pressure offensively even then. Among the Recover and Soft-Boiled users in OU, Starmie also possesses a special defensive utility, as it's the only one of them to not be forced out immediately by Snorlax when paralyzed and is able to fight back against it offensively as well when running a STAB move. Those traits make Starmie usable in pretty much any state of the game, turning it into a very flexible Pokemon and easy addition to most RBY OU teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is an option over Blizzard for the increased PP if Starmie tries to fish for freezes on opposing Alakazam or Chansey lacking Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Hyper Beam is an option to surprise weakened Chansey or Alakazam, but Starmie loses a lot of potential if you drop a move for it. Hydro Pump is an option on a late-game Starmie, as it can 2HKO Tauros and generally do decent damage to anything that does not resist it, especially with a critical hit.</p> <p>Hydro Pump can be used for strong STAB hits, and can be especially powerful when combined with Special drops from Psychic, but running the two moves in combination severely limits Starmie's coverage options and leaves it struggling to hit Pokemon such as Exeggutor or an opposing Starmie.</p> <p>Starmie also has access to Reflect and the rare Light Screen. However, it will struggle to fit those moves onto its moveset most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey is the number one counter to Starmie, as Starmie realistically cannot beat it with any of its movesets, especially when Chansey is paralyzed. In return, Chansey beats Starmie by paralyzing it and beating it down with Thunderbolt, which Starmie will almost certainly fail to outstall with Recover due to full paralysis and critical hit chance. Alternatively, a Chansey lacking Thunderbolt can attempt to freeze an unparalyzed Starmie, as it runs little risk of losing by doing that. However, in order for Chansey to reliably beat a paralyzed Starmie, it needs to run Thunderbolt, since Seismic Toss's PP does not surpass Recover's massive 32 PP, meaning Starmie can outstall variants without Thunderbolt. It's also worth noting that an unparalyzed Chansey runs the risk of getting frozen by Starmie's Ice-type attacks, especially if it cannot threaten with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam</strong>: Alakazam has little to fear from Starmie as well. Although it does not possess any super effective move to hit Starmie with, its higher Speed and Special mean Alakazam can trade paralysis against Starmie and proceed to damage it with Seismic Toss or go for Special drops with its own, vastly stronger Psychic. The best Starmie can do is try to freeze an unparalyzed Alakazam or paralyze it and go for Special drops of its own in order to gain the Speed advantage and make Blizzard do more damage. Recover's massive PP leaves Starmie outstalled relatively quickly with that approach, though, since Alakazam can switch out to something like Chansey to relieve the Special drops. Additionally, while Surf can help Starmie in the Alakazam matchup, it usually still is not enough to beat it, since it only 4HKOes. The possibility of critical hits combined with multiple full paralysis turns on Alakazam, however, does give Starmie a fighting chance.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Even though Starmie is relatively bulky for a Pokemon with instant recovery, it still takes a good chunk from Snorlax's Body Slam. Alongside Starmie's relative trouble to deal great damage to Snorlax plus Snorlax frequently running Rest to heal damage and sometimes carrying Hyper Beam, this makes it a solid check to Starmie. If nothing else, Snorlax's Body Slam is another tool to paralyze Starmie, which generally makes it easier to handle. However, Snorlax has to be careful versus Starmie carrying a STAB move, especially Psychic, since one Special drop means it can no longer reliably Rest stall even a paralyzed Starmie. Another tool Snorlax has to dispose of Starmie is Amnesia. Since Amnesia Snorlax frequently only carries Blizzard and Body Slam as attacking moves, it still does not reliably beat Starmie, but outspeeding Starmie thanks to the additional Speed drop caused by using Amnesia when both are paralyzed surely helps break it with Body Slam. However, Amnesia does not protect Snorlax from Starmie's high critical hit chance, meaning Starmie can even break through Amnesia Snorlax with two consecutive Psychic critical hits or a potential freeze from an Ice-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Starmie struggles to stay in against Electric-type STAB moves from Jolteon and Zapdos or trade a Thunder Wave with them, since it cannot attempt to Recover off the damage they inflict piece by piece. Jolteon is definitely the best offensive check to Starmie. It does not like paralysis very much, but since it is one of the rare Pokemon that naturally outspeed Starmie, it can afford to take Starmie on even when paralyzed. Starmie can at best 4HKO Jolteon with Psychic, while Jolteon outspeeds and 2HKOes it. Zapdos does not fare as brilliantly against Starmie as Jolteon does due to being weak to Blizzard and not naturally outspeeding it, but it still does beat Starmie one-on-one, though it greatly appreciates it being paralyzed beforehand. Note that both Zapdos and Jolteon have a high critical hit rate thanks to their high Speed. One critical hit Thunderbolt from them will easily OHKO Starmie.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Attacks</strong>: Razor Leaf from Victreebel does upwards of 73% to Starmie, meaning that Victreebel does not need to hit many Wraps to put a paralyzed Starmie in range of being KOed by Razor Leaf. If Sleep Clause is already active, Starmie absolutely needs to be paralyzed for Victreebel to beat it, though, since Starmie 2HKOes Victreebel with either Psychic or Blizzard. Mega Drain on Exeggutor is another option to pressure paralyzed Starmie trying to block Sleep Powder, since it 3HKOes Starmie and 2HKOes it after a Special drop from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Attacks</strong>: Other non-STAB Electric-type attacks coming from the likes of Gengar, Lapras, and opposing Starmie will put enormous pressure on Starmie, potentially taking it down with a single untimely full paralysis or critical hit.</p>",

        "Special Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Recover and Thunder Wave alongside Starmie's incredible Speed turn Starmie into a very sturdy Pokemon that possesses the ability to paralyze the foe and outspeed it after, even when paralyzed itself, and proceed to recover its health, since most attacks do not deal 50% to it. This makes Starmie tough to break and is why this move combination allows Starmie, despite its high Speed, to take paralysis even early on in the game and avoid being crippled by it as much as most other Pokemon. In fact, a paralyzed Starmie is very good at blocking sleep-inducing moves from common sleepers like Exeggutor and Sing Chansey lacking Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Starmie's traits do not end at its defensive role, however. In its last two moveslots, Starmie is able to run a variety of powerful special attacks, which can be chosen to hit almost every Pokemon in the tier except Chansey super effectively or at least decently hard. In that context it is worth noting that, due to its high Speed, Starmie has a very high chance of 22.46% to score a critical hit, which frequently enables Starmie to successfully knock out opposing Pokemon by shooting for critical hits.</p> <p>Blizzard most notably hits Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Rhydon, as well as Victreebel and Dragonite. It is chosen over Ice Beam due to having more power while only being 10% less accurate. In addition to the coverage Blizzard provides, another reason to use it lies in its chance to score a freeze on opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Alakazam or just about any Pokemon if you're desperate. Moves that typically go alongside Blizzard are Psychic and Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Psychic is Starmie's best option to hit Pokemon like Gengar and the Normal-types, thanks to gaining STAB. This is especially important against Snorlax, as a Starmie without STAB moves struggles quite a bit to really hurt it. Another important feature of Psychic is the chance to score Special drops, which can help force switches and thus spread paralysis on the opposing team. This is especially noteworthy against Chansey, especially those running Reflect, since enough Special drops can force it out even when it has already set up a Reflect, which Starmie will otherwise fail to achieve. It can be useful against Alakazam as well, albeit not as consistently, since Alakazam itself can cause Starmie's Special to drop. It is worth mentioning however, that the Blizzard + Psychic set does have some issues with running out of PP rather quickly against opposing Recover users and will not be able to hurt opposing Starmie and Slowbro.</p> <p>Thunderbolt is used to hit opposing Water-types super effectively, including Lapras, Cloyster, and especially opposing Starmie and Slowbro. Being able to threaten other Starmie, especially when they lack Thunderbolt themselves, and beating Slowbro with a critical hit are the biggest selling points for Thunderbolt. Additionally, Thunderbolt is Starmie's only super effective move against Articuno, which itself doesn't really threaten Starmie much but can be annoying to actually knock out. If Thunderbolt is chosen alongside Blizzard, it should be noted that Starmie will struggle to properly threaten Gengar and Snorlax, as the latter can usually Rest stall Starmie, especially if it is paralyzed.</p> <p>Either move can be run alongside Blizzard whether or not Starmie is used as a lead, though as a lead Starmie usually prefers Psychic, as it's usually more useful for early-game purposes; Thunderbolt's coverage alongside Blizzard is appreciated if Starmie is kept for late-game, when opposing Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax are taken care of otherwise.</p> <p>Psychic and Thunderbolt can be used on the same set if you want to retain the power versus Starmie and Slowbro and the ability to threaten Snorlax, which can be very dangerous for teams that have to rely on either of those Pokemon to fend off Starmie if Chansey is taken out already. Not being able to do much versus Exeggutor, especially when facing it as a lead, plus being unable to hit Rhydon super effectively can be annoying, but neither of them really likes going up against Starmie, since Psychic still does a lot to Rhydon, and Exeggutor usually cannot do much back if it lacks Mega Drain and Starmie cannot be put to sleep anymore. Exeggutor will be paralyzed and receive permanent chip damage in the process of trying to beat Starmie. However, Starmie cannot beat it without giving it multiple chances to fish for Special drops, which might force Starmie out and give Exeggutor the opportunity to put a switch-in to sleep. Additionally, Exeggutor has plenty of time to go for its Explosion, meaning Starmie will likely only trade with Exeggutor. Furthermore, not running Blizzard means you miss out on hitting especially the rare Dragonite super effectively, which then does not have to fear being outright KOed by Starmie and may be able to try its luck with setting up Agility on a weakened team.</p> <p>Another STAB option Starmie has is Surf. However, Water-type moves do not provide much in terms of coverage in the RBY OU metagame, since Fire-types are basically nonexistent and will be unable to beat Starmie anyway, and the ones you might meet such as Moltres are already hit super effectively by Blizzard. Nevertheless, Surf is used to OHKO Rhydon, hitting it by surprise, and it's Starmie's best option against Alakazam and Jynx, giving it a chance to take them down with some luck. It is worth noting that even with Surf, Starmie does not necessarily beat Alakazam; it will force it to Recover more frequently, though, and thus create turns to gain momentum by switching in a physical attacker on a Recover. Like Psychic, Surf also serves as a stronger STAB move against neutral targets such as Snorlax. The lack of a Special drop chance, however, makes it the inferior choice for that purpose. Usually the move to go alongside Surf is Thunderbolt, since Blizzard and Psychic are somewhat redundant with Surf. Since Surf and Thunderbolt both have 24 PP, this Starmie set is best suited for drawn-out games that include PP stalling. It must be noted that with Thunderbolt and Surf, Starmie is walled by Victreebel and Exeggutor, the latter of which has a good chance to force Starmie out due to its high Special and Psychic dropping Starmie's Special, giving Exeggutor opportunities to use Sleep Powder on a switch-in. Additionally, Starmie can no longer hurt opposing Zapdos and Dragonite. Pairing Surf with Blizzard is possible to avoid these issues, but the inability to hit opposing Water-types makes this less desirable.</p>"

    "nu": {
      "outdated": true,
      "overview": "<p>Mr. Mime is the best Psychic-type in RBY NU. Its excellent Speed, STAB Psychic, and lack of weaknesses let it work as a lead, wallbreaker, or cleaner, and most teams will have issues checking it with anything other than their own Mr. Mime. Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt grant it the utility and coverage to take on almost any foe, especially given the prevalence of fast foes as well as Water- and Flying-types. It also makes an excellent revenge killer, as few foes outpace it and it is difficult to switch into. Mr. Mime easily beats Blastoise and Venomoth one-on-one, ruins Charizard with Thunder Wave and heavy damage, and even scares Clefable with a critical hit or Special drop. Every single team benefits from Mr. Mime's damage output and Thunder Wave support, so it should never go unused.</p> <p>That said, Mr. Mime has several weaknesses, including its horrendous physical bulk, vulnerability to Seismic Toss, and difficulty breaking past NU's other Psychic-type, Exeggcute. Many Pokemon, such as Kabutops, Moltres, and Golem, 2HKO Mr. Mime, so it becomes incredibly vulnerable once paralyzed, and Seismic Toss 3HKOes it. Since Mr. Mime is so difficult to check, teams lacking Exeggcute will usually send their own Mr. Mime to trade Thunder Wave, ensuring that at least an ally can finish it off. Clefable, Electrode, and rare niche picks like Porygon, Abra, and Drowzee can also force this trade or force it out. Additionally, while Mr. Mime's Speed is nothing to scoff at, it's still a bit slower than Raticate, Charizard, and Ninetales, so they can beat it one-on-one.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Mr. Mime lacks many other options. Counter is the main option of note, as this turns its physical frailty into a dubious boon, sending back strong attacks like Slash, Super Fang, and Body Slam for massive damage and dealing 70% to opposing Mr. Mime after Seismic Toss. This has several problems though; it is difficult to fit, usually replacing Seismic Toss, and Counter + Thunderbolt fails to KO Mr. Mime. Using Counter on Super Fang cannot KO Raticate, which is also faster and could use Body Slam instead. Slash seems like a good opportunity for Counter, but Charizard may use Fire Blast and often does not run Slash in the first place, while Kabutops is 2HKOed by Thunderbolt and only rarely OHKOed by Counter. Barrier can be used as a tricky move to take Hyper Beam from slower foes like Clefable, Kabutops, and Kingler, but this is very prediction-reliant and many foes have ways around it, such as strong special attacks; it also costs a moveslot that Mr. Mime really cannot afford. Attempting to set it up in advance is fairly pointless, as the opponent can exploit missing coverage once they see it.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggcute's viability hinges on its ability to reliably check Mr. Mime. It's at worst 4HKOed barring critical hits and Special drops, and it threatens sleep and paralysis in return. It can potentially use Explosion to allow a threat like Charizard in freely. Rare options like Drowzee and Abra absorb Mr. Mime's attacks well and threaten status and a 3HKO with Seismic Toss; Drowzee fares better due to its superior bulk, but Abra is capable of hamstringing and chipping Mr. Mime as well. Mr. Mime commonly checks itself as well, coming in after a KO to paralyze and trade hits.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Once Mr. Mime is paralyzed, Pokemon like Golem, Kabutops, Nidoking, and Kingler can crush it. Even special attackers like Blastoise and Seadra handily beat a paralyzed Mr. Mime, and it struggles to switch in against anything but Venomoth. However, its ability to block sleep is very valuable and provides an early-game opportunity to land more damage or paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable is bulky enough to duel Mr. Mime, but a single Special drop vastly worsens this matchup. Thunder Wave permanently reduces Mr. Mime's threat, or Clefable can opt to 3HKO it with Body Slam and potentially paralyze it along the way. Hyper Beam sets fare relatively well against Mr. Mime, often KOing it after Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Mr. Mime lacks recovery and often takes heavy damage in early- to mid-game fights, leaving it vulnerable to revenge killers like Charizard, Ninetales, and Raticate. Raticate is especially difficult to switch into, but all of these Pokemon also keep Venomoth out, preserving momentum regardless of whether Mr. Mime stays or switches out. Electrode, Fearow, and the rare Arcanine are also effective revenge killers and can beat Mr. Mime one-on-one if necessary.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem is a very tenuous check to Mr. Mime, relying on finding free entry against an Electric-type move. It 2HKOes Mr. Mime with Earthquake, but Mr. Mime 2HKOes Golem given an immediate Special drop or one critical hit, so the odds actually favor Mr. Mime if it is unparalyzed. However, paralysis makes Golem a much safer check, and Explosion OHKOes Mr. Mime, a generally advantageous trade for the Golem user.</p> <p><strong>Moltres</strong>: Moltres Speed ties Mr. Mime and 2HKOes it, while Thunderbolt only 3HKOes it 47% of the time before accounting for critical hits. Moltres can therefore tenuously revenge kill Mr. Mime or, after checks like Kabutops and Golem are removed, take paralysis to set up Agility, defeat Mr. Mime, and proceed to deal heavy damage. This is risky, however, as paralysis reduces Fire Blast's already shaky consistency.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Psychic 2HKOes Venomoth and Nidoking—its 33% Special drop chance and Mr. Mime's 17.6% critical hit chance often allow it to 2HKO or 3HKO even bulky foes. It's also a spammable option that dents almost any foe, and it puts Charizard and Blastoise in range of a 2HKO from Thunderbolt or a potential OHKO after a critical hit or Special drop. Thunderbolt covers the tier's many Water- and Flying-types, 3HKOing bulkier ones like Blastoise and Charizard and 2HKOing the frailer Kabutops and Kingler. Seismic Toss primarily covers opposing Mr. Mime, 3HKOing it, but it also 3HKOes Abra and 4HKOes Exeggcute. Thunder Wave shuts down fast sweepers and wallbreakers like Charizard and Mr. Mime and maintains a Speed advantage against slower Thunder Wave users; with a Psychic drop reapplying the Speed drop, even paralyzed Charizard, Moltres, and Ninetales become slower than paralyzed Mr. Mime.</p> <p>Mr. Mime makes an excellent mid-game wallbreaker or late-game cleaner. In both roles, it benefits from allies that can help to remove Thunder Wave users so it can simply attack without fear of paralysis. Wigglytuff can weaken Clefable, Exeggcute shuts down opposing Mr. Mime, and Raticate is a fearsome wallbreaker that can revenge kill Clefable and Mr. Mime effectively. Nidoking benefits heavily from any paralysis Mr. Mime manages to spread, letting it revenge kill opposing Mr. Mime, Charizard, and Raticate. As a wallbreaker, Mr. Mime can help clear the way for teammates like Charizard, Moltres, and Seadra to sweep by removing troublesome Water-types and Thunder Wave users. Defensively, it has difficulty with powerful physical attackers like Golem, so bulky allies like Blastoise and Kingler can help protect it.</p> <p>Mr. Mime is often used as a lead, threatening opposing leads with paralysis and preventing frustrating scenarios like an early Charizard sweep. In this role, it may sometimes opt to take paralysis and switch out, returning later to blockade Venomoth's sleep attempts and retaliate with Thunder Wave or a powerful attack. This is somewhat risky, so lead Mr. Mime heavily appreciates slower, hard-hitting allies like Golem and Kabutops for opposing leads like Charizard and Mr. Mime; in return, it can protect them from Venomoth putting them to sleep in retaliation. However, usually lead Mr. Mime will stay in, use Thunder Wave, and simply attack until it is KOed, enabling a teammate to revenge kill or letting Venomoth attempt Sleep Powder. In this role, it needs very little support, and the rest of the team can simply focus on enabling Charizard or another sweeper. Mr. Mime is somewhat unhappy to see Venomoth as the opposing lead, as Venomoth may win the Speed tie, and Mr. Mime can only OHKO it with a critical hit. Overall, Venomoth is favored to land Sleep Powder in this matchup, removing a major threat, but Mr. Mime has a chance to simply obliterate it or dodge Sleep Powder and gain a massive advantage.</p>"

  "Scyther": {
    "pu": {
      "outdated": true,
      "overview": "<p>Scyther's incredible Speed—tied with Rapidash for the fastest in the tier—makes it one of only two Pokemon that outspeeds the ubiquitous Fearow, giving it a near-unique ability to revenge kill it. Scyther's excellent Speed is complemented by a fantastic Attack stat and access to Slash. It can further increase its attacking prowess with the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam; with just one boost, it's capable of outright OHKOing many of the tier's frailer Pokemon, such as Staryu and Drowzee. With two boosts, it becomes near-unstoppable, as its high Speed also makes it extremely difficult to revenge kill. However, Scyther is held back by its terrible coverage and a subpar typing. Scyther's offensive movepool is limited to Normal-type moves and the extremely weak Wing Attack, meaning it is completely walled by Graveler and Omanyte, and it also has trouble breaking through Gastly unboosted. Although Scyther's typing gifts it with a handy immunity to Ground-type moves, every Earthquake user has a move that hits it super effectively. Scyther is also weak to the common Fire-type moves in the tier; notably, Rapidash and Arcanine have a 61.5% chance to OHKO it with Fire Blast. Lastly, Scyther's power falls just short of some crucial damage thresholds. For example, Scyther's Hyper Beam at +2 Attack is unable to OHKO Arcanine, Magneton, and Seaking, and it can only OHKO Fearow 30.8% of the time; additionally, Slash followed by a +2 Hyper Beam isn't a guaranteed KO on Nidoqueen. Scyther also faces competition from Pinsir; although they have different roles on a team, they are often incompatible due to their shared weaknesses, most notably to the common Fire Blast. Scyther boasts higher Speed, while Pinsir has higher physical bulk and power, allowing it to get the damage thresholds that Scyther barely misses out on.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>If Scyther pursues other options, Wing Attack should be dropped, although it is usually not recommended due to completely losing the Gastly matchup. Scyther's most common other option is Agility; it can be used to negate the Speed drop from paralysis. This increases the pool of Pokemon that Scyther can set up on, adding foes such as Staryu, Drowzee, and Vileplume to its list of options. This can also be used to win certain endgames that Scyther would otherwise lose by taking paralysis. However, the chance for full paralysis reduces Hyper Beam's accuracy to an effective 67.1%, and considering Scyther typically has to hit multiple Hyper Beams in a row, this sweep can be halted by one unfortunate miss or full paralysis. In addition, Agility can be used to outpace other Agility users, such as Seaking, Dragonair, and Porygon, while also allowing Scyther to not worry about speed ties against opposing Scyther or Rapidash.</p> <p>Substitute can be used to punish switches, such as a weakened Fearow switching out of a predicted Slash, but Scyther can still be paralyzed behind a Substitute. Double-Edge can be used as a midground between Slash and Hyper Beam but it is only useful in highly specific situations and is generally not recommended.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Graveler and Omanyte can switch into all of Scyther's attacks and wall it. The former takes up to 17.8% from Slash and OHKOes with Rock Slide, while the latter takes up to 22.7% from Slash and 2HKOes with Blizzard. Graveler can also freely set up Substitute on Scyther, making it very tricky to switch into.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly is completely immune to Slash and Hyper Beam, and it 2HKOes Scyther with Thunderbolt. Scyther has to rely on the weak Wing Attack to hit Gastly, which does very little when unboosted. However, the move 2HKOes at +2 Attack, meaning Gastly has to hit Hypnosis if it switches into Scyther as it uses Swords Dance, but it can use Thunderbolt instead to get Scyther into KO range for a teammate. Even at +4 Attack, Scyther fails to OHKO Gastly most of the time.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Arcanine and Rapidash have a 61.5% chance to OHKO Scyther with Fire Blast; Arcanine always survives a +2 Hyper Beam and Rapidash survives 84.6% of the time. Magmar has higher odds to OHKO Scyther with an 82.1% chance, but Scyther also has an 82.1% chance to OHKO Magmar at +2 Attack, meaning Magmar is better suited for checking an unboosted Scyther.</p> <p><strong>Magneton</strong>: Magneton has a 79.5% chance to OHKO Scyther with Thunderbolt and always survives +2 Hyper Beam, making it an effective switch-in. It also threatens Thunder Wave to stop Scyther from sweeping even if it manages to survive a hit.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Since Scyther is heavily reliant on its Speed, it must avoid paralysis, especially if it lacks Agility. A paralyzed Scyther is very easy to revenge kill due to its poor bulk and weakness-laden typing. Because of this, it should switch out of Thunder Wave users such as Staryu and Drowzee unless it can KO them. Thunder Wave variants of Porygon are overwhelmingly favored to survive a +2 Hyper Beam, and they cleanly 2HKO Scyther with Blizzard. Vileplume's bulk also lets it survive a +2 Hyper Beam from full HP, although it has to rely on the less accurate Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Nidoqueen and Sandslash are bulky enough to beat Scyther one-on-one. They both easily survive a +2 Hyper Beam and 2HKO Scyther in return. However, Scyther can pair up with other physical attackers checked by them, such as Fearow, to break through, overwhelming these checks with offensive power.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Scyther boasts the deadly combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam, which allows it to set up and sweep an opposing team. Scyther needs to set up on Pokemon that are unable to paralyze or OHKO it, such as Fearow, Nidoqueen, Pinsir, Machamp, unboosted Seaking, and Gastly. Unfortunately, Scyther fails to KO many of these foes at +2 Attack, meaning they must be weakened first. As such, setting up with Scyther often requires baiting one of these Pokemon in, dealing enough damage to put it in KO range of Scyther's +2 Hyper Beam, and then allowing your own Pokemon to faint so Scyther may enter the field safely. At this point, Scyther can use Swords Dance, take a hit, and potentially sweep. Arguably the most important Pokemon that Scyther can set up on Fearow, since its high Speed makes it otherwise difficult to check offensively. However, Scyther must be wary of an OHKO from Fearow's Drill Peck on a critical hit.</p> <p>Slash is a very good option for Scyther if it is unable to find a turn to set up. It can KO frailer Pokemon such as Drowzee and Staryu from 51% and 56.6%, respectively. Most importantly, it does a minimum of 41.1% to Fearow, which is enough to KO Fearow after Nidoqueen or Seaking's Blizzard, and it is favored to KO after Gastly's Thunderbolt. This gives Scyther a safer option to revenge kill Fearow without risking the OHKO from a critical hit Drill Peck. Wing Attack allows Scyther to hit Gastly, notably 2HKOing it at +2 Attack. This means if Gastly switches into Scyther as it sets up Swords Dance, it has to land Hypnosis in order to beat Scyther. If Sleep Clause is already active, the odds become even better for Scyther, as Gastly has to fish for either a critical hit or paralysis from Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Scyther fits best on fast offensive teams that appreciate its Speed and ability to revenge kill Fearow. Seaking is a good teammate that can switch into Fire-types and Graveler. Seaking's Blizzard also gets Fearow into KO range for Scyther's Slash. Porygon can switch into Graveler and Omanyte to wall them and set up Agility. Porygon's Psychic also gets Gastly into KO range for Scyther's Wing Attack at +2. Sleepers such as Gastly, Drowzee, and Vileplume can help Scyther find setup opportunities on sleeping Pokemon. Fire-type allies can trade with opposing Fire-types and Gastly to ease pressure for Scyther. Scyther also fits well on hyper offensive teams that sacrifice utility Pokemon in favor of damage output, as it benefits a lot more from foes being at low HP than from them being paralyzed. As a result, Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Rapidash, Arcanine, Pinsir, and Machamp are good teammates. It is possible to drop Nidoqueen on these teams as well, since teams lacking Nidoqueen generally focus on stacking Pokemon with high Speed, and Scyther can alleviate the Fearow weakness that a team lacking Nidoqueen often suffers.</p>"

Slash bypasses Pokemon relying on Reflect, such as Abra and some Clefable variants, while Swords Dance and Hyper Beam make it tough for Normal-neutral Pokemon to switch into. Scyther is also one of the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame; it ties for the second-fastest Pokemon in the tier with Rapidash and has a superb critical hit ratio of 20.5%. Its already terrific Speed can be bolstered with Agility, meaning it cannot be pinned down by partial trappers and opposing Agility users like Dragonair and Moltres either. With adequate paralysis support and good prediction, Scyther can theoretically be used as a powerful late-game cleaner.</p> <p>However, Scyther has too many flaws to warrant a spot on most teams. Its low bulk and horrid defensive typing render many attackers able to 2HKO or even OHKO it. These include notable Pokemon such as Blastoise, Nidoking, Golem, and Kingler. Scyther's reliance on Speed means that even with Agility, it is severely debilitated by paralysis compared to other sweepers. It also has a barren movepool: besides the miserably weak Wing Attack, it only possesses Normal-type attacks, meaning Rock-types like Golem and Kabutops can easily switch in and make progress against it. Other fast sweepers, such as Mr. Mime and Electrode, can provide more offensive presence throughout matches, as they sport better coverage moves and provide utility with status moves like Thunder Wave. While Scyther can be used to lure its counters and grant switch-in opportunities for its teammates like Blastoise and Kingler, this tends to be prediction-reliant and inconsistent.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance makes Scyther's Hyper Beam one of the most threatening moves in the tier, always or possibly OHKOing Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Electrode, and Rapidash at +2. Agility allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, notably including Electrode and Rapidash, which usually threaten it out with super effective moves. If Scyther is paralyzed, Agility can also remove the Speed drop. Slash is its primary attacking move, almost always scoring a critical hit and punishing foes for switching into predicted Swords Dance, 3HKOing foes like Charizard, Poliwhirl, and Ninetales. Unfortunately, it does not get a power boost with Swords Dance.</p> <p>Scyther's shallow movepool leaves it with few other options. Agility is the most replaceable, as Scyther is already fast and does not need the additional Speed most of the time. Toxic discourages AgiliWrap Dragonair and Fire Spin users like Moltres, Charizard, and Rapidash from setting up on it. Unlike Slash, Double-Edge gets the power boost from Swords Dance and can be utilized if Slash's immediate power is not desired. Wing Attack can be used to damage Gastly, but not only is Gastly rare, Wing Attack also has lower damage than Slash even against super effective targets. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, rack up poison and burn damage, and fish for full paralysis and misses, such as against Fire-types like Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres.</p> <p>As Scyther struggles to make headway against Rock-types like Kabutops and Golem, Grass-types like Exeggcute and Weepinbell are useful teammates. Scyther is also vulnerable to Fire-types like Ninetales, Rapidash, and Moltres, so Water-types like Kabutops and Blastoise to withstand Fire- and Rock-type attacks are also appreciated. Scyther can function as a lure for Rock-type Pokemon, which makes it easier for its partners like Blastoise and Kingler to predict an attack. Sleep inducers such as Poliwhirl and Venomoth can cripple Scyther’s counters and can facilitate setup opportunities. In turn, Scyther can come in on predicted Rest from Pokemon like Poliwhirl and Blastoise, enabling it to more easily break through the opposition.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Jynx's role remains virtually unchanged from its job in standard OU play—using Lovely Kiss on Psychic-type leads, absorbing or blocking sleep for its own team, and fishing for a freeze if given the chance. What changes, however, is the relevance of that role. Jynx remains just as capable at inducing sleep, but teams that utilize sleep-inducing physical attackers make it much harder for Jynx to absorb sleep. Jynx's horrendous physical bulk lets Pokemon like Persian and Snorlax pulverize it after Jynx is paralyzed, preventing it from being an effective sleep blocker. Jynx also struggles to remove paralysis via Rest against these teams, as using it allows every physical attacker free entry. This essentially means that against teams that employ physical sleep inducers, Jynx's only use will be to induce sleep early and to potentially annoy Pokemon like Chansey, without ever getting the chance to block or absorb sleep for its teammates. Jynx also performs horribly against sleep leads that outspeed it, such as Gengar and Persian. Hypno also competes with Jynx as a Psychic-type sleep inducer, which trades out accuracy on its sleep move for access to Thunder Wave and Amnesia, which makes it much deadlier later in the game. Fortunately, though, Jynx still manages to perform well against teams that still use traditional methods of inducing sleep, like Sing Chansey or non-Double-Edge Exeggutor. This relegates Jynx to being a more matchup-specific Pokemon rather than one of the most consistent leads in the tier.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Jynx is still the fastest Pokemon with access to a 75% accurate sleep move, despite the new sleep inducers added in Tradebacks. This makes Lovely Kiss completely mandatory for Jynx to have any relevant niche. STAB Blizzard is incredibly powerful, usually forcing Alakazam to use Recover if it switches in on it and dealing significant damage to most other Pokemon, notably OHKOing Rhydon and 2HKOing Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Persian. Ice Beam can be used for a marginal increase in odds to freeze the opponent, but the decrease in power is very noticeable in nearly every matchup. Psychic is a good tool to hit Pokemon that would normally resist Jynx's Ice-type STAB, like Cloyster and Vaporeon, as well as to fish for Special drops on paralyzed Pokemon. The last slot is the most flexible, but Jynx generally wants to run Rest. While the potential risk for using it is increased, its still just as good against teams with traditional sleep inducers.</p> <p>Unlike most other Pokemon, Jynx gains almost nothing of significance in its Tradebacks moveset. The only somewhat relevant new option is Petal Dance, which can allow Jynx to 3HKO Starmie 60% of the time. With a critical hit, Jynx can potentially eviscerate a Starmie expecting a free switch in. However, Jynx will be locked into Petal Dance for 3-4 turns, meaning that if Petal Dance doesn't get the KO, Jynx becomes a sitting duck. Beyond that, Jynx can use Counter to improve its matchup against Normal-types and to deal a chunk of damage to special walls as Normal-types switch out. It can also use Seismic Toss to deal consistent damage to Slowbro and Starmie, both of which resist its STAB options.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>It's a sad state of affairs for Jynx in Stadium OU. The nerfs to sleep and addition of Team Preview make its main niche—the one-two punch of a speedy Lovely Kiss followed by a Blizzard freeze—far rarer and much less impactful. Regardless, being the most reliable sleeper available is still a decent niche to have, and Jynx can pave the way for teammates like Rhydon or Zapdos to bring down the hammer thanks to the status requiring a turn for the foe to wake up. Additionally, Jynx's other traits remain relevant: Ice-type STAB gives it a fantastic matchup against Pokemon like Exeggutor, and its Psychic resistance lets it handle opposing Psychic-types like Alakazam and non-Surf Starmie. However, its drawbacks remain; Jynx's limited offensive coverage and barely good enough Special leave it easily stopped by Pokemon like Chansey and Starmie, and it also struggles to break past Substitute, a somewhat frequent move in Stadium OU. Furthermore, its pitiful physical bulk means Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros can effortlessly exploit it to score big damage on Jynx's team as it's forced out. Double-Edge being much more common on Exeggutor also hurts it greatly, as it has a much harder time using Rest in front of it.</p>",

Given Stadium OU's penchant for long games, Ice Beam is a valid choice to fish for a freeze; if every hit connects, Ice Beam should score one around 82% of the time. However, Blizzard is superior in terms of raw damage, notably 2HKOing Exeggutor, which is especially effective if Jynx switches in on a predicted Rest. Psychic complements this for excellent neutral coverage, being Jynx's strongest attack against some uncommon foes like Cloyster, Lapras, and Gengar. Rest lets Jynx stay healthy throughout a game while triggering Stadium Sleep Clause and blocking paralysis attempts from Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Exeggutor. However, Rest must be used carefully, as using it too predictably will leave Jynx helpless against a foe that switches in as it uses Rest. Tauros is particularly problematic, as Jynx being a constant free Tauros switch is very dangerous even in Stadium's less offensive metagame.</p> <p>Outside of Rest, Jynx can use other options, but dropping Rest makes Jynx far more vulnerable to status. Given that Psychic generally hits uncommon foes, Seismic Toss is an alternative that puts more pressure on Psychic-types, making it harder for them to PP stall Jynx's attacking moves. Seismic Toss is useful for dealing with Jynx's Substitute issues, breaking Alakazam and Starmie's Substitute easily and also helping against Slowbro; however, because these are uncommon sights, the move is niche. 7 Defense DVs alongside Counter guarantees a KO if Jynx lands Counter against Tauros's Body Slam. Alternatively, Mimic can be used to take a potentially more useful move, such as Recover or Thunder Wave from Alakazam and Starmie. Substitute is usable for scouting switches and protecting Jynx from paralysis, but the offensive cost is quite steep. Jynx should generally be used on teams that appreciate its sleep-inducing prowess for high payoffs, such as those with Zapdos, Rhydon, or Slowbro.</p>"

Jynx can defeat important threats like Chansey and Articuno and still attempt to freeze other threats like Starmie, Alakazam, and Snorlax, which would usually counter it. What holds Jynx back are its low HP and Defense stats, which prevent it from survivng longer on the field without its trademark move, Lovely Kiss. Jynx's attacks are quite good in certain matchups, but other Psychic-type Pokemon have better traits, like Alakazam's great Speed, Starmie's outstanding bulk, and Exeggutor's combination of Leech Seed and Toxic, leaving Jynx as a niche but viable Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",

Ice Beam is used for better accuracy, higher PP, and more chances to fish for a freeze while still 2HKOing threats like Sandslash. Psychic is another great STAB move that lets it hit Gengar, Machamp, and Hitmonlee for super effective damage. The chance of lowering Special really comes in handy against opposing Jynx and Lapras. Finally, Rest is Jynx's last move because it improves reliability against the previous matchups, allowing Jynx to win without fear of counterplay or Toxic poison.</p> <p>Jynx is usually found on teams where its weaknesses to the multiple Psychic- and Normal-types in the tier are cancelled out.

It has very powerful STAB moves in Blizzard and Psychic that give it good coverage to hit Rhydon, Exeggutor, and Zapdos for good damage while pressuring Chansey with Special drops. Jynx has decent Speed and a decent Special stat to back up its Lovely Kiss and strong STAB moves. Being an Ice-type even allows it to pivot into and wall Ice Beam Chansey, Mewtwo, and Slowbro before they set up with Amnesia.</p> <p>However, Jynx has very low Defense, taking heavy damage from most physical attacks. It is slower than several notable Pokemon such as Tauros, Gengar, Zapdos, and Mew. Jynx can also end up as setup bait for Slowbro, Mew, and the dangerous Mewtwo after it has put something to sleep and gotten its freeze, requiring very careful use after landing both statuses. Overall, Jynx finds its role as a strong sleep- and freeze-inducing lead with good matchups against standard Psychic-type leads.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jynx’s last moveslot has a few options available to it. One option is Ice Beam, which has more PP and therefore more opportunities to freeze than Blizzard alone. Another option is Seismic Toss, which allows Jynx to pressure threats it wouldn't otherwise be able to deal with, like Slowbro and Mewtwo after Amnesia. Body Slam can spread paralysis, but its inconsistency and Jynx's very low Attack stat make this mostly not worth it. Mimic is a gimmick that can give Jynx useful moves such as Recover, Thunder Wave, and Amnesia but is very matchup- and luck-based. Jynx has the option of dropping Psychic to run two other moves and potentially catch something off guard at the cost of not being able to pressure Chansey. An interesting option is running 7 DVs in Defense to OHKO Tauros with Counter after getting hit by Body Slam. However, this significantly hurts Jynx, as it already somewhat lacks longevity, and it can also be useless if the opponent is careful and uses Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro sets up on Jynx, takes minimal damage from Psychic and Blizzard, can heal Seismic Toss damage, and doesn’t care about Body Slam paralysis. However, it does fear a freeze. A Slowbro that is asleep from Rest can be chipped by Seismic Toss into the range of a teammate’s Explosion. Keep in mind that Slowbro with only Ice Beam must be at +6 to even 3HKO Jynx.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: While less common, Starmie always walls Jynx's coverage and heals the little damage it may take. It can also effectively absorb Jynx's Lovely Kiss and use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, too many Psychic Special drops can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is a very common lead, is faster than Jynx, and carries Hypnosis. It can also use Explosion to OHKO Jynx, which can put Jynx's team at a big disadvantage if there is no backup sleeper. However, Hypnosis's chance to miss means Gengar should fear possibly being put to sleep itself or taking big damage from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Pokemon that can use Thunder Wave such as Mew, Jolteon, and Alakazam can severely cripple Jynx, as it has very little use without the option of a fast Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes minimal damage from any of Jynx's moves and forces it out with Seismic Toss. It can also put Jynx to sleep with Sing or paralyze it with Thunder Wave. However, Jynx can freeze Chansey or drop its Special, forcing it out. Also, if Ice Beam is Chansey's only attacking move, Jynx can wall it and use Rest to heal damage.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo sets up on Jynx as long as it does not get frozen. Mewtwo can also use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, Jynx has a chance to beat Mewtwo if it gets fully paralyzed for a few turns before it sets up, or if Jynx lands some critical hits.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Lead Tauros versus lead Jynx is a gamble for both sides. Tauros is able to fish for Body Slam paralysis, a critical hit Body Slam that OHKOes 66% of the time, or Stomp flinches. On the other hand, if Tauros fails to get any of those, Jynx can try to put it to sleep, use Counter, or use Blizzard for heavy damage. However, Tauros can also use Earthquake on the first turn to avoid Counter and guarantee a KO with Hyper Beam on the next turn. Also, Tauros is able to come in later in the game and finish off a weakened Jynx with little issues.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Lovely Kiss is Jynx's best move, allowing it to likely disable one of the opponent's Pokemon for most of the game. Blizzard and Psychic hit the majority of the tier for solid damage. Psychic also has a chance to lower the foe's Special, helping Jynx deal a little bit more damage with subsequent attacks. Counter allows Jynx to fire off massive damage after taking a Normal-type move, usually Body Slam from Tauros, Snorlax, or Mew. However, it is very prediction reliant, as all three run Earthquake and can use it to avoid damage from Counter. Rest helps Jynx stall Chansey, eliminating an obstacle for your own Mewtwo, as well as increasing Jynx's overall longevity. One must be aware that many physical attackers and setup sweepers can take advantage of a sleeping Jynx, so Rest must be used carefully.</p> <p>Jynx sometimes gets an early-game freeze before it can try to freeze Mewtwo, so Light Screen Chansey is a premier teammate, as it provides one of the tier’s best checks to Mewtwo. Light Screen allows Chansey to avoid the 3HKO from Mewtwo's Psychic and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Another good option is Flash Chansey to PP stall opposing Mewtwo if Jynx is running Rest. Jynx is great both with and against Explosion. Teammates with Explosion such as Gengar, Mew, and Exeggutor, or Snorlax with Self-Destruct, appreciate Jynx chipping the opposing team into their range. Also, Jynx should be used to take Explosion or as sleep fodder after it has inflicted its status effects to prevent Mewtwo and Slowbro from using it as setup fodder.</p> <p>Teammates that can check Mew are very helpful, as Mew can come in against Jynx and set up for free with Swords Dance, especially if Jynx has used Rest. The best check to Mew is Mew itself; Transform Mew is a very solid counter to opposing Swords Dance Mew, as it can easily turn the opponent's strategy against them. Gengar is another good teammate that completely counters mono-Body Slam Mew. Rhydon and Golem are other good checks to mono-Normal Mew and can support Jynx by absorbing other Normal- and Electric-type attacks, both of which can be problematic for it. Rhydon is stronger and bulkier than Golem and can help pressure the opposing team more immediately. However, both Jynx and Rhydon are somewhat slow for the Ubers metagame, and Amnesia users can use them as setup fodder. Golem, while weaker and frailer than Rhydon, is slightly faster and has Explosion as a one-time nuke, which can take out almost anything on the opposing team and applies immense constant pressure.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Jynx has a lot of unique features that differentiate it from other Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Starmie. For one, Jynx is the second fastest sleep inducer after the unreliable Gengar, making it a fantastic potential lead option that can incapacitate its checks by making them fall asleep. STAB Blizzard also allows Jynx to win the matchup versus Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Rhydon, and Zapdos. This is all in addition to the standard expectations of a fantastic Psychic-type: access to the powerful STAB Psychic and a high Special stat. Jynx also has its faults, though. Despite its key resistances to Ice- and Psychic-type attacks, Jynx can become easily trampled over by physical attacks, namely from Normal-types such as Tauros and Snorlax, due to its pitiful HP and Defense stats. While its key resistances to Blizzard and Psychic may say otherwise, the main way Jynx provides defensive utility is being the switch-in for predicted sleep-inducing moves. Additionally, nearly all teams run at least two solid checks to Jynx between Chansey and either Starmie or Alakazam, sometimes both. Due to the omnipresence of these checks, their access to Thunder Wave and reliable recovery, and Jynx's susceptibility to paralysis and being worn down over time, Jynx's role is undermined. Jynx can use Rest to restore its health and alleviate its paralysis, burning off sleep turns against Pokemon that can't do much back to it like a paralyzed BoltBeam Starmie. However, doing so opens itself up to a slew of physical attackers such as Tauros and Snorlax that can freely switch into it while it's asleep.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>As previously stated, Jynx's most useless move is Rest, and therefore if one wishes to use one of these other options, it should usually replace Rest. Ice Beam can be used over Blizzard to give Jynx more PP on its Ice-type STAB option. Running Ice Beam can also come in handy in long, drawn-out games to secure a freeze against one of the opponent's Pokemon, although the drop in power is noticeable. A healthy Jynx can use Counter to improve its matchup against Tauros and Snorlax; it is situational, and Jynx has to be at a sizable amount of health for this strategy to be pulled off, although it can also be used after taking damage from a previous turn and the foe switching out. Mimic can be utilized to potentially copy an important utility or coverage move such as Thunder Wave, Soft-Boiled, Recover, or Thunderbolt from one of Jynx's switch-ins such as Chansey or Starmie. However, forfeiting Rest for only a chance to copy a useful coverage move is somewhat risky and still leaves Jynx prone to being paralyzed. Body Slam can be utilized to fish for paralysis against incoming switch-ins like Alakazam, although it is not guaranteed, cannot paralyze Chansey and Snorlax, and is fired off of Jynx's exceedingly below-average Attack stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Gengar cannot switch in safely on Jynx whatsoever, it can put Jynx out of commission from the very beginning of the game with Hypnosis. Gengar is also faster than Jynx and can threaten to use Explosion at any time.</p> <p><strong>Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam</strong>: Starmie, Chansey, and Alakazam can sponge all of Jynx's attacks, paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and restore their health with Soft-Boiled or Recover, acting as some of the most consistent Jynx checks after one of their teammates has been put to sleep. Although they are all susceptible to being frozen with Blizzard, they can whittle Jynx down and force it to use Rest early, limiting the number of chances Jynx has of freezing something.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Tauros and Snorlax can take advantage of Jynx's low HP and Defense and love switching into it after it uses Rest, forcing in a teammate to take the incoming Body Slam. Tauros can also pick up the KO against Jynx with Hyper Beam with a little prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Slowbro, like Starmie, resists Jynx's dual STAB combination of Ice and Psychic and can use Jynx as a setup opportunity to boost with Amnesia and Rest off all the damage it has taken. Lapras is another great example of an offensive check to Jynx despite its lack of reliable recovery due to its 4x resistance to Blizzard and access to Body Slam, although one of its teammates will need to have already been put to sleep. The Jynx user may also decide to trade damage off against Lapras with the end goal of revenge killing it later with another teammate such as Tauros or Alakazam. Getting too much damage off on these Pokemon after Jynx puts something to sleep will often lead to the defensive core of a team crumbling.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Jynx's primary goal is to use Lovely Kiss and incapacitate the foe's lead such as Starmie or Alakazam. Blizzard is Jynx's strongest STAB option against certain Psychic-types such as Alakazam and nails Pokemon such as Zapdos and Exeggutor. It can also be used to fish for a potential freeze while scouting which of the opponent's Pokemon has a sleep-inducing move. Psychic rounds out Jynx's coverage, receives STAB, and hits Pokemon such as Gengar and Lapras. It also has the potential to lower a foe's Special stat, which can come in handy to more convincingly win matchups versus special attackers, notably an opposing paralyzed Chansey. Rest provides Jynx with a way of restoring its health and alleviating paralysis. While Jynx doesn't have too many opportunities to use Rest due to its lackluster physical bulk, it can use Rest and burn sleep turns on more passive foes such as Chansey, Alakazam, and Exeggutor lacking Double-Edge. Burning off sleep turns is not always easy, however, as generally speaking most teams pack anywhere from two to three solid checks to Jynx, leaving it liable to exploitation. Jynx is primarily used as a lead due to its above-average Speed tier and access to a fairly accurate sleep-inducing move. However, Jynx can also be used mid-game due to its high Special and fantastic offensive dual STAB combination of Blizzard and Psychic. Note that removing statused Pokemon such as paralyzed Alakazam and Chansey from play allows for Jynx to more freely use Lovely Kiss. The ideal way to utilize Jynx is to put one check to sleep with Lovely Kiss, potentially freeze one of Jynx's remaining checks, and then switch it into potential sleep inducers.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Electabuzz is generally considered good in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Electabuzz is the premier Electric-type in RBY UU thanks to its base 105 Speed, which lets it outspeed tier-king Tentacruel and force it out with Thunder Wave. Its Speed also grants it an impressive 20.51% critical hit rate, making it difficult to consistently wall. Additionally, Electabuzz is blessed with good coverage in Psychic and Body Slam, which gives it a variety of ways to check threats like Dugtrio, Tangela, and Venusaur. Naturally, this also makes Electabuzz effective late-game, making Pokemon like Articuno and Dodrio think twice before going for a sweep. With its strong hit-and-run playstyle, proactive gameplay is key to being successful with Electabuzz.</p> <p>However, Electabuzz can be inconsistent, which makes it a bit difficult to use on teams. It struggles while paralyzed, so it cannot typically stay in against common Thunder Wave users such as Kadabra and Hypno and struggles against Body Slam users like Gyarados, Vaporeon, and Omastar that it otherwise matches well against. Its Special is unimpressive against neutral- or high-Special targets, with its Thunderbolt only 3HKOing Tentacruel and Vaporeon and dealing less damage than Seismic Toss on average against Hypno. Furthermore, Electabuzz lacks reliable recovery—unlike Kadabra, which operates similarly—while being 2HKOed and 3HKOed by most physical and special attackers, respectively, making it very easy to wear down. The massive presence of Dugtrio is very problematic for Electabuzz as well, with it constantly switching in on Thunderbolt and threatening a KO from Earthquake with minimal prior damage. Electabuzz also competes with Raichu, which has Surf, Agility, and higher Attack and Special; however, outrunning Tentacruel and having Psychic usually makes Electabuzz the better choice, especially as a lead.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Electabuzz has an incredible movepool, fine-tuning it is often a misguided attempt that makes it easier to counter than it should be. Changing its listed coverage can be very difficult to justify, as it covers every Pokemon in the tier. Mega Kick can replace Seismic Toss, as it 2HKOes Kadabra while doing more damage to Hypno and opposing Electabuzz. However, it does less damage to Tangela and has only 74.6% accuracy. Hyper Beam performs similarly and has higher accuracy, which may make it more enticing, but Raichu often runs it more effectively thanks to its superior Attack stat. Substitute can scout an attack or an opponent's switch-in without needing to predict, and Electabuzz can use it to fish for full paralysis and a free chance to attack. However, Electabuzz can only take advantage of Substitute late-game when Pokemon that spread status like Hypno and Kadabra are either KOed or able to be KOed with one attack. Submission may seem enticing to damage Normal-types and Golem, but Thunderbolt or Psychic, respectively, damages them more consistently as a result of better accuracy, making it difficult to recommend. Counter can sneak an OHKO on Persian using Slash, but in this situation, Electabuzz should be going for Thunder Wave paralysis.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt while dealing massive damage back with STAB Earthquake. Dugtrio outspeeds Electabuzz and can OHKO with a critical hit Earthquake, and without a critical hit if Electabuzz has taken even slight damage. Alternatively, Dugtrio can predict Electabuzz switching out to set up a Substitute. However, Dugtrio fears Body Slam's paralysis and doesn't like taking chip damage, so it struggles to switch in. Meanwhile, Golem is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and Psychic, so it can come in fairly safely and force Electabuzz out. Golem then has the opportunity to set up a Substitute, use Explosion, scout with Body Slam, or just get off decent damage with a STAB move. However, it can't repeatedly switch in should Electabuzz predict correctly, which can force it to use Explosion noticeably earlier, and Special drops can make Psychic a 3HKO.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Electabuzz struggles to damage Grass-types and hates getting statused, making Tangela and Venusaur great checks. Tangela carries Stun Spore in addition to Sleep Powder and isn't weak to any of Electabuzz's attacks, making it generally a better check. However, Venusaur does have more offensive power—Razor Leaf is a clean 3HKO—and may do more for a team overall.</p> <p><strong>Hypno</strong>: Hypno is the best Electabuzz check that does not resist Thunderbolt. It can paralyze Electabuzz or put it to sleep while not worrying about Electabuzz's own Thunder Wave. Hypno sometimes even prefers being paralyzed so that it cannot be put to sleep later on. Hypno also has good bulk, only being 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and sometimes Thunderbolt. Meanwhile, it can 3HKO Electabuzz with Psychic, and any drop to Electabuzz's underwhelming Special is a very bad situation for it. However, if Hypno is caught using Rest, Electabuzz can be very dangerous, as a single critical hit can force Hypno to use Rest again; this opens it up for wallbreakers like Kangaskhan to switch in and finish the job.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Electabuzz relies on its Speed, so paralyzing it greatly cripples its effectiveness, exposing its decidedly mediocre bulk. Therefore, the mere possibility of getting paralyzed often forces it out, giving momentum to Thunder Wave and Body Slam users like Clefable, Kadabra, Hypno, Kangaskhan, and even some Dragonite variants. However, many Body Slam users, such as Vaporeon and Omastar, greatly fear Electabuzz's STAB Thunderbolt. In a pinch, though, they can fight back and hope for a Body Slam paralysis, especially in Vaporeon's case, since Thunderbolt only 3HKOes it. Non-Seismic Toss variants of Electabuzz will struggle to punish a Tangela switch-in, allowing it to get off Stun Spore with impunity.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While Electabuzz has fantastic coverage, it tends to struggle with opposing Electric-types. Opposing Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode may trade Thunder Wave with it while resisting Thunderbolt. Raichu also notably outdamages Electabuzz, possessing a higher Special stat, Surf, and Hyper Beam. Electrode doesn't entirely mind paralysis, as possessing Explosion means it always has some kind of value; however, it may become forced to use Explosion against Electabuzz in some scenarios, which may not be a favorable trade, as there are vastly better targets like Hypno and Tentacruel. Overall, if Electabuzz needs to be slowed down, going for a paralysis trade with your own Electric-type is absolutely fine.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>A fast Thunder Wave is Electabuzz's claim to fame and forms its main role in tandem with Thunderbolt: paralyzing fast Pokemon and breaking through bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Gyarados and Dodrio. This paves the way for sweepers like Dugtrio and Articuno while also making wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite more devastating, providing massive momentum in the long run and often choking the opponent out of options late-game. Electabuzz's Thunderbolt is quite threatening, being one of few moves to have a reasonable chance to OHKO Gyarados, 76.9%; it also 2HKOes Dodrio, Dewgong, and Omastar. Being faster than Tentacruel and having Thunder Wave also makes Electabuzz incredible at forcing the opponent into predictable switches, particularly to Dugtrio, Hypno, and Tangela; those switches are ripe for exploitation, making a well-played Electabuzz a massive late-game threat, especially when factoring in being faster than Tentacruel.</p> <p>Body Slam gives Electabuzz an effective midground option, notably letting it paralyze Dugtrio switching in. It also does decent damage to physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra, especially with Electabuzz's good critical hit rate. When one is unsure about using Thunder Wave, Body Slam is normally the best option. Psychic provides another midground option that covers Haunter and Tentacruel more effectively; getting a Special drop can make Thunderbolt significantly more threatening as well, giving a near-guaranteed KO on Tentacruel after Psychic damage. It's also helpful for hitting Venusaur and Haunter super effectively, which are common problems for most Electric-types. Another less appreciated boon is that if you use Electabuzz to trade paralysis, Psychic Special drops reapply the foe's paralysis Speed drop; this allows Electabuzz to muscle past with Thunderbolt thereafter. Seismic Toss can be used over either Body Slam or Psychic to deal more damage to Golem, Hypno, and Tangela on average.</p> <p>Electabuzz should ideally play hit-and-run because of its distaste for paralysis, but it can also trade paralysis if the team doesn't rely on its offensive prowess and speed control. However, a late-game sweep should never be counted out, as Electabuzz is excellent in simplified game states, gradually picking off limping Pokemon. It is ideal to bring Electabuzz in through a teammate's Wrap or on an opposing Pokemon using Rest, as it's frail and generally wants to stay healthy for late-game. Predicting an opponent's switch to Tentacruel or Gyarados can also be effective; Articuno and Dugtrio are good Pokemon to use for baiting these in. Electabuzz should generally use Thunder Wave whenever you are confident that a fast Pokemon, like Tentacruel or Persian, will stay in to attack. Finding these opportunities is important because Hypno often switches into Electabuzz, stealing momentum and using paralysis sustained from Thunder Wave to block further status.</p> <p>Electabuzz can be used as a lead; this is primarily for the common Tentacruel matchup. Because it outspeeds and paralyzes Tentacruel, Tentacruel is forced out immediately, giving Electabuzz an uncontested Thunder Wave, switch, or damage opportunity. In this situation, Body Slam is the most appropriate as a midground option, covering their switch while dealing decent damage with a chance of paralysis. Thunder Wave is also useful to status sleep leads like Haunter and Venusaur, as well as rarer leads like Dodrio. Lead Electabuzz tends to be less valuable, so sacrificing it to sleep is often the appropriate option, sparing more valuable common teammates like Tentacruel, Hypno, and Kadabra. On teams where Electabuzz is okay with being paralyzed, it can trade paralysis with Kadabra and attempt to break through it with Seismic Toss as well, though Electabuzz is at a disadvantage due to a lack of recovery, so switching to a paralysis absorber like Hypno or Vaporeon is recommended instead. Against Hypno, sacking Electabuzz for sleep or trading Thunder Wave is valid because, in the prior case, it can be woken up through Tentacruel's Wrap with relative ease later on, and for the latter case, it is capable of muscling past paralyzed Hypno through critical hits. However, while it may seem enticing to use Thunder Wave against Hypno right away, this often invites Dugtrio in, so using Body Slam is usually more reliable.</p> <p>Electabuzz is best used on teams that are already efficient at checking Dugtrio while having a strong offensive backbone. The best way to facilitate this situation is with Flying-types like Aerodactyl, Articuno, Dragonite, and Gyarados—and, to a lesser extent, Tangela—which check Dugtrio by forcing it to think twice before it uses Earthquake. These Pokemon also invite Tentacruel in, which Electabuzz feasts on. Articuno is particularly valuable, as Electabuzz breaking through Water- and Grass-types is instrumental in allowing it to sweep late-game, making the pair a strong offensive core. Wallbreakers such as Dodrio, Kangaskhan, and Persian take advantage of Hypno using Rest, a key part of gaining momentum in RBY UU, and Electabuzz spreads paralysis for them. Dodrio also has a great matchup against Grass-types like Venusaur and Tangela, as well as an immunity to Earthquake to set up on Dugtrio, making it among the best Normal-type Electabuzz partners. Kangaskhan is also helpful against Dugtrio thanks to its high physical bulk and appreciates Electabuzz paralyzing its checks for it to wallbreak later on. While used on almost every team, Tentacruel can bait opposing Tentacruel in very frequently, and its Wrap support is instrumental in allowing Electabuzz to enter the game safely, making it an especially perfect partner. While similar to Electabuzz, Kadabra is also a great partner, forming a strong special attacking core that can overwhelm common Hypno + Kadabra cores; trading Electabuzz with one of them lets Kadabra and Hypno teammates wreak havoc. Finally, Venusaur performs excellently alongside Electabuzz, being a fine Pokemon to double switch into when predicting the opponent will go to Hypno or Dugtrio, getting a free sleep move off as to enable Electabuzz to switch in later; this can be done as early as turn 1 one with lead Electabuzz.</p>"

    "pu": {
      "outdated": true,
      "overview": "<p>Magmar finds a niche in RBY PU thanks to its diverse movepool compared to the tier's other Fire-types. Psychic allows Magmar to hit many top Pokemon without risking Fire Blast's 85% accuracy and makes it the only Fire-type not walled by the rare Omanyte. Magmar's access to Confuse Ray and Smokescreen gives it better matchups against Gastly and Seaking, making it difficult for the former to land Hypnosis reliably and for the latter to set up Agility. It also has Counter, forcing opposing Fire-types to be wary of using a Normal-type attack against it. Despite these upsides, Magmar is still largely outclassed due to its poor stats compared to Arcanine and Rapidash. It should never be used as a replacement for Arcanine, since Arcanine's access to Agility, greater bulk, and superior Attack outweigh Magmar's movepool. Magmar also competes with Rapidash for a spot on a team as a second Fire-type. Although Rapidash has a much shallower movepool, its higher Speed lets it crucially outspeed Fearow, one of the most dominant Pokemon in the tier. Many of Magmar's moves, such as Confuse Ray and Smokecreen, rely heavily on RNG to work effectively. Its competition with other Fire-types and the inconsistency of some of its moves make Magmar a highly specific Pokemon despite the unique advantages it has.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Magmar can run Fire Blast and Psychic on the same set, having the advantages of Psychic's greater accuracy and Fire Blast's extra damage to Fearow and Scyther. However, Magmar already struggles to fit all the moves it wants. Seismic Toss can be used for consistent damage, but it is largely outclassed by Psychic due to Psychic's super effective coverage against Nidoqueen and Gastly as well as the chance to land a critical hit or a Special drop. Substitute can be used with Confuse Ray to make Magmar even harder to KO, but it is competing against Magmar's array of useful coverage moves. Submission can be used to do extra damage to Omanyte, but Omanyte is rare and already hit decently by Psychic.</p> <p>Magmar is occasionally used as a lead, forcing the common lead Arcanine into Counter mind games from turn 1 and letting the player keep their own Arcanine healthy. However, even if Magmar beats Arcanine, it will likely be at low HP or paralyzed, making it easy to revenge kill. Additionally, Nidoqueen is a more effective lead if one wants to preserve their Arcanine, since keeping both Nidoqueen and Arcanine in the back can create a Seaking weakness. As a result, lead Magmar is quite uncommon.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Magmar's lack of Agility means it hates paralysis much more than Rapidash and Arcanine. Once paralyzed, Magmar struggles to use Confuse Ray effectively, and its frailty means it will be worn down quickly. As a result, Magmar is often forced out by Thunder Wave users such as Porygon and Drowzee.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Despite Magmar's better Seaking matchup than Rapidash and Arcanine, it is still far from perfect. Seaking 2HKOes it with Surf, while Magmar needs to hit it with Body Slam three times for Hyper Beam to KO. Although Staryu is not a great check to an unparalyzed Magmar, it 2HKOes it with Surf, while Body Slam into Hyper Beam is not a guaranteed KO. The rare Omanyte can also switch into Magmar and beat it, though Magmar can damage it with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Fire-types:</strong> Rapidash and Arcanine are bulkier and faster than Magmar, so they both beat Magmar one-on-one. However, they must be wary of Counter. Once Magmar is confirmed to not have Counter, the two Fire-types beat it. If Rapidash or Arcanine trade paralysis with Magmar, Magmar will be a lot worse off due to its lack of Agility.</p> <p><strong>Fearow and Scyther</strong>: Magmar is much worse into Fearow compared to Rapidash and Arcanine, lacking the Speed of the former and the bulk of the latter. This is amplified if Magmar drops Fire Blast. Magmar doesn't even force Counter mindgames with Fearow since Drill Peck almost always gets it into Hyper Beam range, and Scyther is favored to KO Magmar with a +2 Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: Nidoqueen cleanly 2HKOes Magmar with Earthquake. Magmar 3HKOes in return, but it can 2HKO with Psychic if the first one drops Nidoqueen's Special. Fire Blast can burn Nidoqueen, and both moves 2HKO if either hit is a critical hit.</p>",

        "Swagmar": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Fire Blast is Magmar's primary STAB move, doing heavy damage to any non-resistant foe. Magmar's higher Special compared to Rapidash and Arcanine means Fire Blast has a higher chance to 2HKO Fearow and OHKO Scyther. Magmar can replace Fire Blast with Psychic, as Psychic hits many of PU's top threats—such as Nidoqueen, Fire-types, Water-types, and Gastly—for the same amount of damage as Fire Blast with 100% accuracy and a chance to drop the foe's Special. This does make Magmar much worse against Fearow and Scyther, though. Body Slam lets Magmar spread paralysis against opposing Fire-types and Seaking, and Hyper Beam can be used to finish off these foes and frail Pokemon, KOing Drowzee, Staryu, and Abra from 51%, 56.6%, and 95.6%, respectively. Magmar can use Counter against opposing Fire-types to punish Normal-type attacks. Even if Magmar isn't running Counter, the threat of the move alone forces the opponent into a guessing game.</p> <p>Magmar usually uses its fourth move to disrupt Gastly and Seaking. Confuse Ray temporarily reduces Gastly's Hypnosis accuracy to an effective 29.9% and makes it harder for Seaking to set up Agility and hit Magmar with Surf. Although Confuse Ray provides more immediate benefits, Smokescreen hinders Seaking until it switches out, making a late-game sweep much harder to pull off. These moves can also be used in conjunction with paralysis to make it very hard for the foe to hit Magmar and in dire situations to try to defeat a Graveler or Seaking one-on-one. Magmar can also forgo these moves to fit both Hyper Beam and Counter on the same set.</p> <p>Arcanine is a near-mandatory partner for Magmar, as it is very hard to justify using Magmar over Arcanine. On teams that struggle against Fearow and Scyther, such as teams with physically frail Pokemon like Staryu, Gastly, Drowzee, and Abra, Rapidash is typically better than Magmar due to its Speed. Instead, Magmar shines on teams that are robust against Fearow but struggle against Seaking and Gastly, such as teams with a Scyther or Graveler. Magmar also appreciates Graveler and Scyther's ability to check Fearow and opposing Scyther, especially if it drops Fire Blast. Magmar can also trade hits with Ground-types to enable Magneton, making it a good teammate. Magneton can switch into Fearow's Drill Peck, which Fearow will often use against Magmar due to the threat of Counter.</p>"

  "Pinsir": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>Pinsir has a unique place in RBY UU thanks to its access to Bind, decent Speed, and potentially massive damage output by virtue of Slash and Swords Dance. Its Bug typing provides it with a resistance to Earthquake; this makes it work well alongside Tentacruel and Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu, especially when checking Dugtrio for them. Pinsir's biggest selling point, however, is its sheer threat level should it boost with Swords Dance, which allows it to flatten paralyzed teams. Few Pokemon can switch into Pinsir's +2 Hyper Beam; some standout calculations include a 41% chance to OHKO Tentacruel and a 2.6% chance to OHKO Hypno. This makes Pinsir a particularly brutal punishment for Pokemon that are often forced to use Rest, such as Vaporeon and Hypno. While not perfect, Pinsir's Speed lets it outpace Dragonite and Hypno, which makes it great at revenge killing them. Further, having a partial trapping move faster than Dragonite can be crucial in many situations, allowing Pinsir to keep Dragonite from setting up with Agility and switch to a counter, such as Tentacruel, for free. Bind allows Pinsir to form a partial trapping core alongside Tentacruel and Dragonite as well, providing teams with significant momentum, especially if the opposing team is stricken with paralysis.</p> <p>As with almost any Bug-type in RBY, though, Pinsir is held back by some severe flaws. Pinsir has no STAB attacks to speak of and is forced to rely only on Normal- and Fighting-type moves. It thus competes with the Normal-type attackers of the metagame—Persian, Dodrio, and Kangaskhan—for a place on teams. Pinsir's Normal and Fighting reliance also makes it completely invalidated by Haunter, which forces it to switch or pivot out with Bind. It also struggles with Rock-types if it lacks Submission, and its weakness to Rock Slide doesn't help there. While Pinsir's Speed helps in some minor ways, it just isn't good enough: Pinsir is outpaced by common threats like Tentacruel, Dodrio and Kadabra, which are very capable of threatening it due to its mediocre typing or low Special. As a result, Pinsir relies heavily on teams that spread paralysis efficiently, making it somewhat dependent on the player's Hypno to function well. These flaws are only worsened by it being debilitated by paralysis and mandating setup, which can be very difficult to accomplish in the Wrap-infested format. Paralysis isn't the only status to give Pinsir trouble either, as Toxic—a substantially common way to deal with Dragonite—puts a firm cap on Pinsir's use of Bind, causing it to take more damage than it would normally deal, which is only made worse by Bind's inherent inconsistency. Overall, Pinsir has some very strong points in its favor, but it's a high-risk pick that necessitates a team built around it as well as a competent player.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can allow Pinsir to be more self-sufficient in the paralysis department while denying switches in from faster threats. However, Slash's damage is sorely missed in this case, causing Pinsir to miss out on many potential KOs and become more reliant on Swords Dance. Seismic Toss can be utilized, as it's Pinsir's sole option to hit Haunter, but it does little to help the matchup; switching out or pivoting with Bind is really all Pinsir can do. Toxic can be helpful for dealing with Dragonite, which otherwise uses Pinsir as setup fodder. However, Pinsir doesn't necessarily need Toxic, as it can use Bind to safely bring in a counter, such as Tentacruel.</p> <p>Bind can be cut for moveslot flexibility, but this causes Pinsir to be a severe momentum sink mid-game. Should the opponent reveal Haunter or a Rock-type, Pinsir is forced out and has to have a teammate take a hit for it, which can let the opponent open holes. Switching out with Bind ensures momentum isn't lost, as foes are unable to move, even Haunter. However, with Bind cut, Pinsir becomes more consistent late-game, as it's less reliant on Bind's shaky accuracy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Pinsir can't touch Haunter at all without the largely undesirable Seismic Toss. To make matters worse, Haunter is faster and gets a near-guaranteed 3HKO with Thunderbolt. As such, Pinsir is normally forced to switch out through a manual switch or Bind. It should be noted that Bind still immobilizes Haunter, allowing Pinsir to safely bring in a counter like Dugtrio, so using Bind to catch Haunter switching in is viable counterplay.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: If Pinsir doesn't run Submission, it's forced out by Rock-types. However, if it does, it usually 2HKOes them at +2, albeit with significant recoil damage and questionable reliability. Golem is adept at coming in on Hyper Beam and outright 2HKOes Pinsir with Rock Slide, meaning it wins in this situation even if Pinsir has boosted. Omastar deals up to 72% with Hydro Pump, which can be followed up with Blizzard to dispatch Pinsir. In addition, considering Submission recoil, Omastar can easily 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. Aerodactyl is another particularly solid counter, only facing a near-guaranteed 4HKO from Submission while 2HKOing in return with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pinsir's special bulk is very poor, so threats like Articuno and Kadabra 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, these matchups are volatile if Pinsir is at full health. Pinsir Speed ties with Articuno and therefore can potentially win if it's boosted; Slash + Hyper Beam will 2HKO Articuno quite frequently. Against Kadabra, Pinsir can deal up to 91% with Slash alone, and +2 Hyper Beam will always OHKO it unless there's an unfortunate miss. As such, Kadabra is restricted to revenge killing Pinsir, which can be stifled by teammates like Hypno, though Pinsir being forced out isn't necessarily ideal. While they are very rare, Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres greatly threaten Pinsir with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Tentacruel</strong>: Tentacruel is faster than Pinsir, can pivot out of bothersome situations through Wrap, and heals paralysis with Rest. It's very difficult for Pinsir to set up in games due to the existence of Tentacruel's Wrap, constantly delaying it while chipping Pinsir into KO range. On top of this, Tentacruel is near-guaranteed to 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. However, Pinsir is very capable of exploiting paralyzed Tentacruel, possessing a potential OHKO with +2 Hyper Beam. If Pinsir paralyzes Tentacruel with Body Slam on the switch, Tentacruel is liable to outright lose. Overall, though, this matchup is very unfavorable and using Pinsir against a healthy Tentacruel is strongly discouraged.</p> <p><strong>Dodrio</strong>: Dodrio can revenge kill Pinsir with Drill Peck, 2HKOing it. It can't switch in to save its life though, taking massive damage from Slash, which has a small but notable chance to 2HKO; alternatively, Slash + Hyper Beam is a guaranteed 2HKO. Furthermore, if Pinsir has boosted, it can OHKO Dodrio with Hyper Beam 89.7% of the time. Dodrio can't fight Pinsir at all if it's paralyzed.</p>",

        "Swords Dance Sweeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The premise of the set is simple: set up with Swords Dance and put 'em away. Hyper Beam is Pinsir's claim to fame, KOing Pokemon from around half HP even without setup and becoming an OHKO machine if boosted. Slash gives Pinsir immediate and significant power, but Submission—albeit somewhat inconsistently—allows Pinsir to beat Rock-types that try to switch in on Hyper Beam, as well as deal massive damage to Persian and Kangaskhan. Finally, Bind allows Pinsir to provide its team with momentum while chipping threats into Hyper Beam KO range, which becomes near-effortless against paralyzed teams. When boosted by Swords Dance, Bind can be surprisingly powerful; for example, it can deal up to 10.4% to Hypno per hit, quickly bringing it into KO range.</p> <p>Pinsir can be a fairly unwieldy Pokemon to use, relying on a paralyzed team to sweep reliably. However, it has multiple points of entry, particularly Dugtrio, which it can beat outright, 2HKOing it with Slash and only being 3HKOed by Rock Slide 0.1% of the time. Outside of this, Pinsir can punish paralyzed Pokemon heavily, be it by revenge killing them or switching in on their physical attacks, which is made safer by the potential for full paralysis. Paralysis further benefits Pinsir's Bind, giving it a safety net for its more frequent misses than Wrap. Pinsir is capable of exploiting Pokemon using Rest quite well with Swords Dance, which can potentially mean an outright win depending on the game state. Pinsir fits on teams that appreciate its Ground resistance and physical attacking prowess. This particularly applies to those looking to get the most mileage out of Tentacruel and Electric-types, so long as the team is capable of providing extensive paralysis support in return.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir's gargantuan Attack stat and Slash makes it among PU's most powerful wallbreakers. Slash at minimum 3HKOes every neutral target and 2HKOes some notable foes like Drowzee and Staryu. Thanks to its access to Seismic Toss and Submission, Pinsir lacks any true walls, unlike other offensive threats like Fearow and Seaking. Once on the field, it is an instantly threatening force that virtually no foe can safely switch into; even Pokemon that can switch into Slash and win one-on-one, like Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine, hate having to take so much damage from Pinsir's Slash. Pinsir is also among the few Pokemon in PU that can 2HKO Porygon without a critical hit thanks to Submission. Pinsir's Speed is also quite good, only being outsped by Rapidash, Arcanine, Fearow, and the rare Abra and Magmar. Tying with Staryu, it outspeeds every other viable Pokemon, which includes important foes like Nidoqueen, Drowzee, and Porygon.</p> <p>However, Pinsir struggles in a metagame so hostile to it. Pinsir's typing leaves a lot to be desired, as its good physical bulk and useful Ground resistance are overshadowed by its terrible weaknesses to Fire and Flying. Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow all outspeed it and beat it one-on-one, with the former two able to outright OHKO it. Even Pinsir's one good resistance is shaky, as many Earthquake users, like Nidoqueen and Graveler, carry super effective STAB moves or coverage moves that can 2HKO it. Pinsir's main niche as an unwallable wallbreaker is less effective than it would seem at first glance. While all three of Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow are walled by Omanyte, and Fearow is walled by Graveler, both Rock-types are themselves walled by Porygon, making those poor matchups almost unpunishable. Pinsir is itself reliant on Rock-types to not get easily revenge killed by the aforementioned trio, so it's often a liability. Additionally, while Pinsir does have the tools to threaten every Pokemon in the metagame, the moves it relies on to target Gastly and Rock-types can only 3HKO them and most other targets, making it possible to pivot in a check to Pinsir with good prediction. Pinsir's plethora of poor matchups makes it hard to justify on teams when one could simply use another offensive threat that requires less support, though its impact on the metagame canot be ignored when a near mandatory Pokemon, Nidoqueen, often carries Fire Blast solely for it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Body Slam can be used to spread paralysis, but Pinsir generally makes more progress using its standard set. Swords Dance is an enticing option, as the sheer power of a boosted Hyper Beam can OHKO nearly every non-Rock- or Ghost-type, KOing even extremely bulky neutral targets like Arcanine and Nidoqueen after the slightest chip damage. Additionally, a +2 Hyper Beam has a 71.8% chance to OHKO Porygon, and a +2 Submission will always do so. Pinsir can notably take advantage of Porygon to set up, as while it risks taking Thunder Wave, few Pokemon can switch into Pinsir's boosted attacks. However, using Swords Dance and Hyper Beam means Pinsir must give up Bind and one of its coverage moves, leaving it unable to threaten certain foes. Pinsir being so easy to force out is another factor that limits the utility of Swords Dance, as it's extremely easy to revenge kill and foes like Rapidash and Arcanine can switch into it as it uses the move.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fire Blast Users</strong>: Rapidash and Arcanine outspeed Pinsir and have a 79.5% chance to OHKO it with Fire Blast, while its Slash only rarely 2HKOes Rapidash and 3HKOes Arcanine. Magmar is almost always 2HKOed by Slash, but it outspeeds and OHKOes Pinsir with its Fire Blast. Nidoqueen 2HKOes Pinsir with Fire Blast, while Slash only 3HKOes back, but Nidoqueen being slower means it needs to be in pristine condition and possibly deal with Bind to win one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow outspeeds Pinsir and has a 96.8% chance to 2HKO with Drill Peck, while Slash only has a 30.7% chance to 2HKO back. However, it is a tenuous check, since it can generally only switch into Pinsir once.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Seismic Toss only 3HKOes Gastly, and it is immune to all of Pinsir's other moves, so it can effortlessly switch in and put Pinsir to sleep with Hypnosis. However, once Sleep Clause is active, Gastly loses one-on-one and will usually need to pivot into in a faster threat, which is predictable.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Pinsir's Submission only 3HKOes Graveler, and its Rock Slide has an 87.6% chance to 2HKO back, which becomes 100% after Submission's recoil. Omanyte loses one-on-one, but it can easily force Pinsir to use Submission or Seismic Toss, allowing it to pivot in a faster threat.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Once paralyzed by threats such as Staryu and Drowzee, Pinsir is easy to overwhelm. Threats that normally lose due to being outsped, such as Seaking and Omanyte, now easily beat Pinsir. Dragonair can also use Wrap to bring Pinsir into KO range. Tenuous checks to Pinsir, such as Nidoqueen, Machamp, and Graveler, find themselves more comfortably able to overwhelm it.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Slash is Pinsir's most spammable attack, 2HKOing or 3HKOing most foes. Submission is Pinsir's strongest attack against Porygon, Omanyte, and Graveler, 2HKOing the former two and 3HKOing the latter. Seismic Toss hits Gastly, which is immune to all of Pinsir's other moves. Seismic Toss also lets Pinsir cover switches, as it still deals decent damage to Rock-types, notably 3HKOing Omanyte. It also puts many targets that are 3HKOed by Slash in 2HKO range, such as Machamp and Nidoqueen, and puts Staryu in OHKO range. Bind allows Pinsir to chip foes into KO range and pivot around slower threats. However, given its terrible accuracy, Bind should only be used when necessary.</p> <p>Pinsir can be used as a wallbreaker or a cleaner for its team. When used as a wallbreaker, it's excellent at removing or weakening crucial defensive pieces such as Porygon, Drowzee, and Staryu. This helps speedy offensive threats, such as Rapidash and Fearow, in sweeping late-game. While Pinsir loses one-on-one against Nidoqueen at full health, in a pinch it can switch into Earthquake and tank one Fire Blast, letting it land Slash twice to leave its foe easy to revenge kill. If used as a cleaner, it enjoys the support of wallbreakers such as Nidoqueen and Fearow to weaken defensive Pokemon. Thunder Wave support from teammates such as Staryu, Porygon, and Drowzee is crucial to pave the way for Pinsir's sweep. Pinsir need to be unparalyzed for it to clean, making allies that can switch into Thunder Wave, like Drowzee and Nidoqueen, good partners. Pinsir is easily handled by Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow, which outspeed and threaten it with their STAB attacks. Therefore, Omanyte and Graveler are essential for preventing Pinsir from being easily revenge killed. Pinsir struggles against Rock-types and Gastly, which force it to use its weak coverage moves. Thus, Water-types such as Seaking and Staryu for the former, and Psychic-types such as Abra and Drowzee for the latter, are appreciated. Porygon walls Rock-types, at best Graveler can trade using Explosion, making it a good teammate.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir is the sole viable Bug-type in RBY OU thanks to an amazing Attack stat that can be further boosted by Swords Dance, allowing it to let loose nuclear Hyper Beams while trapping with Bind. A +2 Pinsir is nothing to be trifled with, capable of beating Snorlax outright with Submission and possessing a Hyper Beam that can OHKO the physically frailer Pokemon in the tier, including Jolteon, Chansey, Jynx, Alakazam, and Victreebel. Additionally, Pinsir has the strongest non-STAB Slash in the game, hitting nearly as hard as Persian right out of the gate. This makes it one of the few physical attackers that can contest Reflect users like Snorlax and Chansey, the latter of which it can 2HKO. Pinsir's typing gives it surprising defensive utility as well, resisting Earthquake and not being hit super effectively by Thunderbolt, giving it use over other Swords Dance users like Kingler. Pinsir is by no means slow relative to OU either, outpacing Victreebel and Cloyster, and, with paralysis support, it can absolutely mow down even the faster Pokemon in the tier, acting as a surprisingly strong late-game sweeper.</p> <p>However, like all RBY Bug-types, Pinsir suffers from some severe downsides. While powerful, Pinsir cannot hit Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing strictly Normal- and Fighting-type attacks in its offensive movepool. Ergo, Gengar can effortlessly switch in and let out a completely uncontested Hypnosis while Pinsir is forced to switch out or pivot out with Bind. Pinsir also suffers from a bit of four moveslot syndrome, demanding Swords Dance and Hyper Beam while having to pick between Slash, Submission, and Bind for its last two slots, all of which can significantly affect its matchups. Worse still, Pinsir is very reliant on its Speed to sweep, as being outsped exposes its noticeably mediocre special bulk, leading to it getting forced out by paralysis inducers such as Alakazam, Starmie, and full HP Chansey. These flaws make Pinsir a rare sight in RBY OU, but a serviceable pick nonetheless.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While a highly contested slot, Pinsir's fourth moveslot is the most flexible. If a team absolutely needs another Pokemon to hit Gengar, Seismic Toss is a suitable option, allowing Pinsir to punish its attempts to switch in. After two strikes, Gengar often becomes much more inclined to Explode, making it a bit more predictable. However, fitting Seismic Toss always brings severe opportunity cost, causing Pinsir to lose out on Submission's fantastic damage against Normal-types or Bind's utility.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Pinsir can't even touch Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing no alternatives to hit it. Worse still, Gengar's Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 3HKO, dealing up to 41.4% per hit, or it can fire off a completely uncontested Hypnosis. However, Bind can immobilize Gengar while allowing Pinsir to bring in a teammate such as Alakazam for free, which does add a degree of risk.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis rains on Pinsir's parade, exposing its severely lacking special bulk and making it near-incapable of running over the opposing team. There is counterplay if Pinsir's foe is paralyzed as well, though, as Pinsir can attempt to use Swords Dance to reapply the Speed drop and continue whaling on them. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Lapras become much more threatening when Pinsir is paralyzed, utilizing their powerful special attacks to 2HKO it. As a result, Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will often force Pinsir out by the threat of paralysis alone unless it's in a situation where paralysis doesn't matter. This also makes Body Slam paralysis from Pokemon like Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon particularly annoying, as Pinsir can't often stomach more than two hits from any given Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pinsir's special bulk of 65/55 is awful; even Jolteon's Thunderbolt and Starmie's Surf have a high chance to 2HKO it. As a result, Pinsir is very frequently forced out by special attackers unless it can KO them first, such as if they're paralyzed or chipped. However, Pinsir does often have the chance to attack them once, which can situationally be all it needs in endgame scenarios.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Foes</strong>: Pokemon like Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro put large amounts of pressure on Pinsir—especially if it's paralyzed—while being able to stomach its hefty physical blows. These Pokemon can also strike back with equally devastating attacks; in Rhydon's case, Rock Slide can deal upwards of 80% in a single hit, which can be a KO if Pinsir even tries to respond with Submission.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: If Pinsir can't KO Chansey outright, Counter Chansey will OHKO Pinsir if it uses any of its offensive attacks bar Bind. This can also apply to more niche Counter users, such as Snorlax, Alakazam, and Kangaskhan. However, if Pinsir has Bind, it has a solid way to counter-play the strategy, immobilizing the Counter users and chipping them into Hyper Beam range.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Swords Dance": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Swords Dance and Hyper Beam are Pinsir's bread and butter, allowing it to swiftly end games if its team can successfully chip and paralyze the opposing team. It should be noted that Swords Dance reapplies the paralysis Speed drop to paralyzed foes, so if Pinsir itself is paralyzed, it isn't game over just yet. This effect also applies to paralyzed Pokemon attempting to switch in, making doing so extremely risky.</p> <p>Pinsir's last two moveslots largely depend on what its user wants. For the third moveslot, Slash gives Pinsir immediate power and provides a better matchup against Reflect users, while Body Slam lets Pinsir spread its own paralysis, making it more self-sufficient. For the fourth slot, Submission, while unreliable and giving Pinsir significant blowback for its use, is an amazing way to dispatch Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax at +2, dealing well over 50% to each of them. In fact, after two boosts, Pinsir can outright OHKO non-Reflect Snorlax. Alternatively, Bind can occupy either the third or fourth moveslot, letting Pinsir pivot into its teammates to gain a better position while also dealing serious chip damage. This works especially well against paralyzed teams, forcing them to switch around to PP stall it while often taking around 7% each time if Pinsir has picked up even a single boost, which rapidly adds up over the course of the move.</p> <p>While this is all well and good on paper, using Pinsir in practice is fairly difficult. It's best to keep it to endgame scenarios, when the opposing team has likely been thoroughly paralyzed. However, it's perfectly fair to switch it in on a Chansey's Soft-Boiled turn or a Snorlax's Rest or Earthquake, both options that Pinsir doesn't really care about. Similarly, Recover turns from paralyzed Alakazam and Starmie are good opportunities for Pinsir to sneak in and force damage on the opposing team; if either of these Pokemon experience full paralysis when attempting to respond, they could absolutely be KOed the following turn. Fellow partial trapping pivots and Explosions are other good switch-in chances. Picking up a boost with Pinsir is also quite difficult, though Pinsir is not against taking a hit to set up if it means winning the game there and then. Punishing a Snorlax Rest with Pinsir is among the best ways to get a boost with impunity, often forcing Snorlax out lest it is KOed from there. Pinsir works best on teams that have multiple paralysis inducers, one of which will likely be the ubiquitous Chansey. Jolteon synergizes very well with Pinsir, appreciating Pinsir's Ground resistance and ability to 2HKO Rhydon with +2 Submission.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Pinsir is a frightening Swords Dance sweeper in RBY NU, possessing one of the highest power levels in the tier in the tier alongside Bind and Slash. Once set up, Pinsir goes on a rampage, quickly chipping down Pokemon with Bind before letting loose one of the strongest Hyper Beams in the game. Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Dragonair, Venomoth, Exeggcute, and Poliwhirl are even threatened with outright OHKOs at +2, while Blastoise and Clefable need minimal Bind chip damage to OHKO as well. Pinsir is by no means slow either, tying Nidoking and Seadra and getting the jump on Blastoise and Kabutops. When forming a core with wrappers such as Rapidash, Moltres, and Charizard, Pinsir can add some much-needed physical attacking prowess. With paralysis support from the likes of Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and Porygon, Pinsir can also sweep past otherwise faster checks like Charizard and Moltres.</p> <p>However, Pinsir's movepool is extremely shallow, making it linear and open to very simple counterplay, such as switching in Golem or even just having Counter. With the high viability of Fire-types in RBY NU, Pinsir's low Special also comes back to haunt it, leaving it OHKOed by even Charizard's Fire Blast and limiting setup opportunities against special attackers like Seadra. This special frailty means Pinsir is best used on teams populated by Water-types such as Blastoise and Kabutops, the latter with which actually competes heavily with it. That competition further extends to Kingler, which possesses similar qualities to Pinsir while having reliable counterplay to Rock-types in Crabhammer, as well as other Pokemon like Sandslash. However, it fares well alongside these Swords Dance users, and Bind can be enough for it to distinguish itself over them. Worse still, Pinsir's Speed, while good, is still not quite desirable; Fire-types revenge kill it, as do Venomoth, Fearow, and tier-king Mr. Mime. Its suboptimal Speed also makes paralysis even worse, exposing its fragility and making it very difficult to clean up even paralyzed teams. Regardless, Pinsir functions as an effective wallbreaker or sweeper, supporting top-tier Pokemon like Charizard very well in the metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Pinsir can drop Bind for more offensive flexibility, but this makes it more of a momentum sink, forcing Pinsir to manually switch out against slower Pokemon if threatened with paralysis or heavy damage. Ergo, many teams have to use a deliberate game plan centered around strictly late-game usage for these sets to work. However, sets like Swords Dance / Hyper Beam / Body Slam / Submission provide Pinsir with alternative midground options once successfully switched in, more effectively contesting common switch-ins like Golem and Charizard.</p> <p>In terms of niche move choices, Pinsir has few that are justifiable because of its terrible movepool. Toxic is feasible for incapacitating Fire Spin users as they switch in, such as Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres, but Body Slam is normally enough of a deterrent. However, it does come with the added bonus of piling chip damage on Rock-types when used alongside Bind. Seismic Toss is all Pinsir can muster for the very rare Gastly, but Bind can at least secure a safe pivot, and Seismic Toss is rarely helpful.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: All Fire-types in RBY NU, with the exception of Flareon, outspeed and mortally threaten Pinsir with Fire Blast and Fire Spin, namely Charizard, Ninetales, Rapidash, Arcanine, Moltres, and the rare Magmar. Even if Pinsir survives a Fire Blast from Rapidash or Magmar, it is still at risk of being burned and instantly fainting. However, if the Fire-types are paralyzed, Pinsir poses a serious threat, as a +2 Hyper Beam will KO any of them if they have taken minor damage prior.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: If Pinsir lacks Submission, it can hardly scratch Rock-types like Golem and Kabutops, immediately losing momentum and having to pivot with Bind. If it does have Submission, however, Pinsir is capable of dealing massive damage, 2HKOing them at +2.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Pinsir needs foe paralysis to outspeed the faster threats of RBY NU and therefore despises taking it itself; ergo, faster paralysis users such as tier-king Mr. MIme, Venomoth, Electrode, and the rare Abra can force Pinsir out after it gets a KO. Clefable, Wigglytuff, and Porygon are also capable of absorbing hits from an unboosted Pinsir and paralyzing it in return. Body Slam is also common on a myriad of Pokemon, most commonly Clefable, Wigglytuff, Kingler, and some Blastoise variants, which can pose further risk. While Pinsir can threaten Clefable and Wigglytuff with Submission, it will take high recoil damage in the process, with the latter costing around a third of its health at +2. While Swords Dance can reapply the paralysis Speed drop on foes to help if Pinsir has been paralyzed, this is unreliable and leaves it open to attack.</p> <p><strong>Counter Users</strong>: Pinsir is the sole fully-evolved Pokemon that has no damaging moves that can circumvent Counter. This means that Pokemon such as Charizard, Blastoise, Poliwhirl, Clefable, and Wigglytuff can all pose a mortal risk to Pinsir by existing. This also makes Hyper Beam use somewhat risky, as a Counter user can switch in, stomach the hit, and hit Pinsir with Counter next turn for the KO. Pinsir can use Bind to bring Counter users down to Hyper Beam range and KO them, but this isn't always mathematically probable. Using Swords Dance to bait out an early Counter and KO the following turn is also possible, but very risky, especially against paralysis users Clefable and Wigglytuff. Consequently, Pinsir teams must scout for Counter early into a game.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: While rare, Gastly completely walls Pinsir. To even damage it, Pinsir requires Seismic Toss, which it cannot afford, and the only other attack that has any effect is Bind, which doesn't damage it but allows Pinsir to pivot into a check safely. In turn, Gastly can use Hypnosis uncontested or 4HKO Pinsir with Thunderbolt.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Swords Dance is Pinsir's claim to fame, allowing it to rapidly chip down teams with Bind before blasting them away with Hyper Beam. Swords Dance also ensures paralysis doesn't immediately ruin Pinsir, allowing it to reapply a foe's paralysis Speed drop and keep the momentum in its favor. For example, against a paralyzed Mr. Mime—a common sight after Mr. Mime have a mirror match—Pinsir can enter and set up, remaining faster despite Thunder Wave, and OHKO Mr. Mime with Hyper Beam the next turn. Pinsir's third moveslot is flexible; Slash provides immediate power for safer revenge killing than Hyper Beam, while the weaker Body Slam makes Pinsir more self-sufficient, spreading paralysis and being boosted by Swords Dance. Body Slam also strongly deters Fire Spin users such as Ninetales and Charizard, which otherwise switch in on Pinsir easily. Finally, Submission OHKOes Porygon and 2HKOes Kabutops and Golem at +2, which Pinsir otherwise struggles to break through, although the steep drop in consistency is a pain for it to deal with.</p> <p>Pinsir functions best late-game when it's not at risk of being paralyzed during its sweep. It's also strongly recommended to paralyze Fire-types like Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres with teammates like Mr. Mime and Clefable; otherwise, Pinsir is easily revenge killed. Kabutops checks Charizard and can KO it outright while quadruply resisting Fire Spin, and it forms a strong physical attacking core with Pinsir that has decent defensive integrity. If not running Submission, Golem and Kabutops should also be removed, with Water-types like Blastoise being great against the former, as Pinsir has issues breaking through them. Pinsir can find switch-in opportunities against Rest users like Blastoise with Rest giving free turns for Pinsir to set up. Outside of this, Pinsir is a great switch-in to Earthquake from the likes of Pokemon like Nidoking; in this case, it can Speed tie Nidoking and either deal serious damage with Slash or gain momentum with Bind. Pinsir works well with fellow wrappers such as Charizard, sometimes alongside other Fire-types like Ninetales, as Pinsir can threaten Golem with Submission while having a wrapping move itself and a Ground resistance for pivoting.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Tauros is the most powerful physical sweeper in the Stadium OU metagame. It has solid offensive stats backed up by a vast attacking movepool that contains Body Slam, Stomp, and coverage options in Blizzard, Earthquake, and Thunderbolt. In addition, its superb base 110 Speed lets it outpace most Pokemon in the metagame and grants it a noteworthy critical hit rate of 18%. However, Tauros has to avoid status at all costs to remain a threat. The reduced viability of Hyper Beam compared to standard RBY does it no favors either, as it now has more difficulty breaking through staples like Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Chansey, as well as knocking out status inducers before they can cripple it. Tauros can run Substitute to avoid status, but this drops Tauros's HP to the point of putting it in 2HKO range of many common threats. Despite these shortcomings, Tauros is a great pick for most Stadium OU teams.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<p>Body Slam is Tauros's main attacking option; its paralysis chance on most Pokemon makes switching into it difficult. Blizzard 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and has a 32.1% chance to 3HKO Exeggutor. It also carries a small freeze chance, which gives Tauros the option to fish for an effective KO in a desperate situation. Substitute protects Tauros from status and critical hits and is a useful tool for sweeping. Double-Edge can be used instead; it is guaranteed to 2HKO Alakazam, and its greater power than Body Slam gives Tauros more room to finish off foes before they can threaten it. It comes at the cost of recoil damage, although this can be avoided if Tauros scores a KO or destroys a Substitute. There are a few moves that can fit in the last moveslot. Stomp's flinch chance allows Tauros to put threats in range of its other moves without taking damage. It is especially effective against paralyzed foes, as they will only have a 52.5% chance to move, and it is also safer if Tauros is behind a Substitute, as it won't risk paralysis or damage. Earthquake usually KOes Jolteon after a Body Slam and 2HKOes the rare Gengar, which walls Tauros otherwise. Furthermore, it hits Rhydon and the uncommon Golem and Kabutops for super effective damage while dealing decent damage to Chansey, should it switch in predicting Blizzard. Tauros can use it to avoid Counter from Chansey, though Counter sees little use. Alternatively, Thunderbolt 3HKOes Starmie, Slowbro, and the uncommon Cloyster and Kabutops. Cloyster is notably able to wall Tauros if it lacks Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Tauros wants to avoid damage and status whenever it can to best use its offensive abilities and avoid being disadvantaged in a potential mirror matchup. Thus, using Tauros means having it active whenever possible while keeping it as healthy as possible. A good way to get mileage out of it while keeping it safe is to switch it in on sleeping or frozen Pokemon, a predicted Rest, or a predicted switch. Another, slightly riskier option is to switch into a predicted Recover or Soft-Boiled from a paralyzed Pokemon; if they get paralyzed when trying to recover, Tauros can finish them off. Substitute should generally be saved for the late-game, as using it once puts Tauros in 2HKO range of common threats like Rhydon, Exeggutor, Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Starmie. Besides the listed options, very few other moves are worth considering on Tauros. Hyper Beam is still incredibly powerful and will allow it to reliably break through Chansey and Exeggutor, but it's much less appealing because it always forces a recharge turn, even if it misses. However, it can work if Tauros is behind a Substitute to protect it from paralysis on the following turn. Fire Blast has a high burn chance, which can be useful against enemy Tauros and Snorlax, but it's a weaker choice in Stadium, as the latter can wipe off the Attack loss with Rest.</p>"

Just like in OU, Tauros's powerful Normal-type STAB moves and complementary coverage coupled with its high critical hit rate make it difficult to switch into and almost impossible to fully stonewall. While its bulk is passable, it lacks resistances and instant recovery, so it offers very little defensive value to a team. Also, the bulkier metagame of Ubers blunts Tauros's edge; the mandatory Mew and Mewtwo can withstand its hits and either retaliate hard or cripple it with paralysis, forcing it out. Tauros is therefore less valued, though this frees it to be used much more aggressively, as it isn't critical to preserve Tauros for late-game.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Double-Edge's increased Base Power over Body Slam greatly improves Tauros's odds to 3HKO Mew and Mewtwo. Two Double-Edges followed by a Hyper Beam will usually KO Mew and Mewtwo. A single critical hit Double-Edge may also put Mewtwo and Mew in range of Hyper Beam. It is guaranteed to OHKO Jynx on a critical hit, unlike Body Slam, and can secure KOs outside of Body Slam's range without Hyper Beam's recharge turn. While Double-Edge strengthens Tauros's matchups against Mewtwo and Mew, it does come at the cost of coverage, and the recoil from Double-Edge can compromise Tauros's bulk. Moreover, its utility compared to Leer's Defense drop and paralysis reapplication is limited.</p> <p>Thunderbolt 3HKOes Cloyster and inflicts more damage on Slowbro than Body Slam does before it boosts its Special with Amnesia; it also hits other Electric-weak Pokemon slightly harder, but these benefits are minimal, and Cloyster is less common in Ubers than OU. Fire Blast can be used to burn physical attackers, such as Snorlax and Tauros, but it has limited utility beyond that. Furthermore, Swords Dance users like Mew are unimpeded by the Attack drop after boosting, and special attackers like Mewtwo welcome a burn shielding them from all other status effects. Substitute can be used to fish for full paralysis against threats like Mewtwo. However, this move is rarely worth the loss of a fourth attack, as it does not protect from status moves. Overall, Tauros has little room to cover specific matchups, and its moveslots are generally better geared toward beating omnipresent threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Tauros relies heavily on its Speed and Attack stats to function. Once paralyzed or burned, Tauros has much greater difficulty applying pressure and loses much of its value as a revenge killer. Status renders matchups that are otherwise favorable to Tauros, like Chansey and Alakazam, very poor and forces it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro's high physical bulk makes it an excellent switch-in to Tauros, as it is able to survive even a critical hit Hyper Beam and cripple Tauros with paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew can cripple Tauros with Thunder Wave, greatly reduce its damage output with Reflect, set up in front of it with Swords Dance, and even punish Tauros's STAB attacks with Counter. Mew also has instant recovery with Soft-Boiled, outpacing Tauros's damage output unless it has Leer. However, Mew is more often than not forced out due to full paralysis, critical hits, Defense drops, and flinches, and it's generally not worthwhile to let Mew risk paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo can threaten Tauros out with its massively powerful special attacks, making it an effective offensive check. Mewtwo has a chance to OHKO Tauros with a critical hit or +2 Psychic. Mewtwo can sometimes run Thunder Wave, making Tauros much less threatening. However, switching Mewtwo into Tauros's attacks is generally not a good idea, as it risks paralysis, after which Tauros pressures it heavily with physical attacks.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is a fairly common foe both as a lead and in the back. It can withstand Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam and can paralyze Tauros with Thunder Wave, and it does massive damage in return with Thunderbolt. However, Zapdos cannot safely switch into Tauros, as Body Slam paralysis greatly reduces its ability to pressure the opposing team, and a critical hit Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam has a 97.70% chance to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: With Thunder Wave to cripple Tauros with paralysis, enough bulk to survive Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, and Recover to heal off the damage, Starmie makes for one of the best available switch-ins to Tauros. However, with Body Slam's 30% paralysis chance and high critical hit rate, Starmie won't be able to deal with Tauros consistently.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax has enough bulk to switch into Tauros and retaliate with a couple of attacks before getting KOed. Self-Destruct KOes Tauros 15% of the time at full HP, so any attack followed by Self-Destruct will reliably take it down. Counter in tandem with Hyper Beam can also catch Tauros by surprise; landing Counter against Body Slam puts Tauros into Hyper Beam range or outright KOes it on a critical hit. Reflect Snorlax is incredibly frustrating for Tauros, forcing it to rely on critical hits to break through.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor doesn't reliably beat Tauros one-on-one, it can switch into a predicted Hyper Beam or Earthquake and cripple Tauros with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore, then maim it with Psychic or take it down with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Lapras</strong>: These bulky Ice-types can stomach multiple hits from Tauros and threaten it with STAB Blizzard. Cloyster's Blizzard falls short of a 2HKO, but it can take four hits from Body Slam—requiring an exploitable Hyper Beam to finish it off—and can also use Explosion. Lapras can 2HKO Tauros with Blizzard 25% of the time, gamble on Confuse Ray to make Blizzard a guaranteed 2HKO, or even use Sing to put Tauros to sleep, but Tauros can finish off Lapras with four hits from Body Slam a little over half of the time.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: While they fear Tauros's coverage, Rock-types can switch into Normal-type attacks and bait weaker coverage moves for a teammate to switch in more easily. If Tauros forgoes Blizzard, Rhydon and Golem are able to trade blows with it. Aerodactyl is also a potent check to Tauros if it has neither Blizzard or Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar can switch into predicted Normal-type moves freely and either threaten Tauros with sleep or bait Earthquake for a teammate to switch in safely. If Tauros lacks Earthquake, Gengar switches into Tauros with ease.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam and Hyper Beam are Tauros's primary attacks and greatest sources of pressure. Would-be checks like Exeggutor and Snorlax can be overwhelmed by Body Slam critical hits and paralysis chance for non-Normal-types. A critical hit Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam has a 97.70% chance to KO Zapdos, Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam KOes Jynx, and a critical hit Body Slam has a 66.7% chance to OHKO Jynx. Tauros also forces bulky threats like unboosted Mew out for fear of being paralyzed by Body Slam and finished off by Hyper Beam. Earthquake threatens Gengar, which otherwise easily switches into Tauros, with a 2HKO and safely scouts for Counter from the likes of Chansey and Snorlax. Blizzard is Tauros's strongest attack against Rhydon, Golem, and the rare Aerodactyl, 2HKOing them while also inflicting heavy damage against other Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Exeggutor and Zapdos.</p> <p>Leer can be used to soften up boosting Pokemon such as Slowbro and Mew, forcing them out to reset their Defense stat. This is particularly useful when the opponent has only one Pokemon left, allowing other physical attackers, like Snorlax and Rhydon, to threaten them even more. Leer's paralysis reapplication is also very useful against faster, paralyzed boosting targets like Mewtwo and Mew, allowing physical attackers to outspeed them even when paralyzed themselves. Tauros can use Leer to enable paralyzed allies to outspeed a paralyzed Mewtwo or Mew, allowing them to set up, heal themselves, or threaten Explosion. This especially helps Tauros itself, increasing its damage and allowing it to always 3HKO Mew and Mewtwo. Stomp is another alternative to Blizzard, trading coverage to exploit Stomp's 30.1% flinch chance against slower, preferably paralyzed Pokemon. Stomp threatens Jynx and Exeggutor in the lead matchup as well as paralyzed Mew, Mewtwo, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Tauros is often used as a lead, utilizing its strong STAB moves and coverage to threaten common leads, forcing them out proactively and spreading damage and paralysis among the opposing team. For example, common sleepers like Jynx and Gengar are 2HKOed by Body Slam and Earthquake, making a miss or a critical hit from Tauros deadly. If Tauros opts for Stomp instead, Jynx's odds of hitting Lovely Kiss get worse, and Stomp's lower damage prevents Counter from OHKOing Tauros. Zapdos will generally either try to trade hits with Tauros or switch out for fear of Body Slam's paralysis chance and Tauros's high critical hit rate. Faster leads like Alakazam and Jolteon generally dislike facing Tauros due to its high damage output and ability to spread paralysis, putting high pressure on them. Against these leads, Tauros also has the possibility of switching out, which can offer a strong sleep blocker in the form of paralyzed Chansey, and keeping Tauros healthy will help it apply pressure later.</p> <p>Tauros can also be used outside of the lead slot, functioning as a strong late-game cleaner. Paralyzed Mewtwo, Mew, and Chansey are particularly vulnerable against Tauros, which can easily spiral out of control with the combined odds of full paralysis, critical hits, and potential flinches from Stomp. In this role, Tauros generally switches in on a predicted recovery move from a paralyzed target like Mewtwo, Mew, or Slowbro, or it can be used as a revenge killer. Leer's ability to reapply paralysis is particularly valuable in this role, allowing Tauros to consistently force out or significantly weaken paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo. Additionally, it enables slower attackers like paralyzed Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Mew to outspeed foes, which is crucial late-game to enable Self-Destruct and Explosion. Leer can also allow paralyzed Mewtwo and Mew to outspeed opposing paralyzed Mewtwo and Mew, providing safer opportunities to recover.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Tauros is the most iconic Pokemon in RBY OU, and its presence has been shaping the tier for as long as it has existed. Tauros is undoubtedly the strongest offensive threat in the tier, thanks to its powerful Body Slams and Hyper Beams paired with the coverage moves to hit any Pokemon that resists its STAB moves. This is further enhanced by its high Speed, and therefore high critical hit rate, as well as serviceable bulk. This makes switching into Tauros a very arduous prospect for most teams, as potential checks like Starmie have to fear a sizable chance of paralysis or a critical hit from Body Slam. Other Pokemon with the theoretical physical bulk, such as Snorlax, Cloyster, and Slowbro, can only shrug off Tauros's hits via Rest, leaving them in an exploitable state. Overall, although some special attackers can trade blows advantageously with Tauros, and it has to be very wary of paralysis, its sheer offensive prowess makes it an automatic inclusion on a vast majority of RBY teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt and Thunder can be used to damage Cloyster, which is one of the sturdiest Tauros switch-ins available. Thunder manages to 2HKO it but has to deal with much lower accuracy, while Thunderbolt misses out on that damage range but is generally far more reliable, and is therefore the preferred option a vast majority of the time.</p> <p>Given the generally low usage of Gengar and Counter Chansey, it is reasonable to cut Earthquake in favor of Fire Blast; while this move does not hit any targets for extra damage, it does carry a 30.1% burn chance that can give Tauros an upper hand in a one-on-one matchup with opposing Tauros.</p> <p>Stomp has a 30.1% flinch chance, and while definitely unreliable, it can be used to bring opposing Pokemon into KO range with no damage traded back with some luck. This is an especially appealing option if the enemy Pokemon is already paralyzed, which further increases the chances of it not managing to attack.</p> <p>Double-Edge's 100 Base Power can be used to safely snipe out KOs that Body Slam cannot reach while not having to rely on Hyper Beam; the recoil is a generally unpleasant side effect, but it can be used to your advantage, as whenever a Pokemon faints from recoil the turn ends immediately. This mechanic can occasionally be used to damage an opponent and prevent them from healing back up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Tauros's below average bulk is difficult to exploit because it is usually faster and strong enough to KO the foe before they can strike back. Paralysis and sleep are both very common in the RBY metagame, and they can shut down this element of Tauros's gameplay, making it much easier to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor lacks recovery, and therefore cannot repeatedly switch in on Tauros, simply having Exeggutor in the back will often dissuade Tauros players from clicking Hyper Beam, as Exeggutor could switch in, tank the Hyper Beam, and land a Sleep Powder or a Stun Spore on Tauros during the recharge turn, effectively putting it out of commission for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is the only Pokemon with access to Recover that can survive a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, which makes it an obvious candidate for a reliable switch-in on Tauros throughout the game; however, Body Slam can ruin its day with decent frequency due to the chance of paralysis. Regardless, Starmie outspeeds Tauros and can even threaten it with Thunder Wave, which makes a healthy Starmie one of the best Tauros answers available.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Lapras</strong>: These Pokemon possess great bulk and access to a powerful Blizzard that is generally enough to scare Tauros away. Lapras's Blizzard is stronger and has a chance to 2HKO, while Cloyster takes Body Slams better and more commonly runs Rest to heal the damage back up. As a side note, Articuno also possesses 2HKO potential via Blizzard, but it's significantly frailer and generally less viable than both Cloyster and Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro is part of the small list of Pokemon that are guaranteed to survive a critical hit Hyper Beam from full HP, making it an appealing option to switch in on a predicted Hyper Beam in order to guarantee landing a Thunder Wave on the recharge turn. It does not mind a Body Slam either, but it can be hard for it to use Rest and wake up unpunished.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Tauros's much slower and bulkier counterpart is a good asset when trying to answer an opposing Tauros, as its natural bulk will often at least guarantee that some damage gets traded back, and if it carries Self-Destruct, it can somewhat reliably trade one-for-one if your opponent chooses to leave Tauros on the field.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Although mauled by Earthquake, Gengar can switch in on Normal-type attacks from Tauros at no cost and threaten it with Hypnosis. Although the exchange is somewhat likely to end very poorly, between Hypnosis's miss chance and Earthquake's critical chance, the Tauros user is generally expected to keep it away from danger if possible, which means Gengar can somewhat reliably be used to prevent Tauros from making any progress as long as it doesn't get hit with an Earthquake on a predicted switch in. Gengar is also the best check to Tauros without Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Alakazam</strong>: Although they definitely do not want to pick a full one-on-one against Tauros or ever switch in on it, Alakazam and Jolteon deserve a mention as they can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Tauros, which is a fairly rare quality.</p>",

        "The Bull": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Tauros's combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam makes it an incredibly difficult threat to switch into, as a majority of Pokemon only need to receive minimal chip damage before being unable to tank a Body Slam followed by a Hyper Beam, and some are KOed by this sequence even from full health. Body Slam's paralysis chance on some of the most common Tauros switch-ins such as Starmie and Exeggutor is yet another addition to Tauros's already threatening arsenal. Blizzard is Tauros's best attack to threaten Rhydon and Golem, the two OU-viable Rock-types that would otherwise be able to switch in on its Body Slam, and force them to face the threat of being 2HKOed (or being OHKOed on a critical hit). Earthquake is the preferred move in the last slot, as it gives Tauros a tool to hit Gengar, which otherwise walls it, as well as a way to play around Counter Chansey, although Tauros still risks taking a Thunder Wave in a direct one-on-one situation. Additionally, it can finish off a weakened Rhydon or Golem with greater accuracy than Blizzard. Earthquake also gives Tauros a safe move to hit both Chansey and Rock-types, which eliminates the need to predict a switch with Body Slam or Blizzard in certain situations.</p> <p>Tauros is such a potent tool to break the opposition down that it is generally preferred to keep it as healthy as possible throughout the game while also trying to get it on the field as often as possible; this is a tricky balance to achieve that often sets apart new players from experienced ones. Great opportunities to switch it in can be found against Pokemon that are asleep, on a predicted switch, or on a recovery move that will leave the opponent's active Pokemon in KO range for Tauros. Quite frequently, Tauros will be able to clean up teams that have appropriately been crippled with status or weakened beforehand thanks to its extremely strong Hyper Beam; this is one of the most common win conditions in RBY, and as such, your game plan should generally account for the possibility of a late-game Tauros sweep. This means you should capitalize on opportunities to set up a Tauros sweep while trying to reduce your opponent's chances to do the same thing. The biggest obstacle in these plans is often the fact that both Tauros are kept as healthy as possible and always able to try a last-resort mirror, even when the rest of the team has fallen apart; this is one of the many reasons for keeping your own Tauros safe.</p>"

  "Gyarados": {
    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Gyarados is generally considered good in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Gyarados is among the strongest tanks and wallbreakers in RBY UU. Thanks to an impressive base stat total and deep movepool, Gyarados can comfortably stomach powerful attacks and threaten just about the entire tier with a super effective special move or strong physical move. It is equipped to handle many premier defensive and support Pokemon; Blizzard 2HKOes Venusaur and Tangela and can potentially OHKO Dragonite, Thunderbolt puts pressure on Water-type Pokemon like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, and the combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam is more than enough to break through Kadabra and Hypno. Gyarados is no slouch against offensive Pokemon as well, boasting a Hydro Pump that can OHKO Dugtrio and 2HKO Kangaskhan and Persian. It is thus a highly customizable Pokemon that can fit on a wide variety of teams.</p> <p>Gyarados is also one of the strongest checks to Dugtrio in the tier. With an immunity to Earthquake and several moves that can OHKO or 2HKO it, Gyarados can switch in against Dugtrio and quickly force it out, sometimes several times in the same game. A healthy Gyarados can confidently prevent a Dugtrio sweep and heavily punish switch-ins with strong moves like Body Slam. Gyarados is also the only Dugtrio check that isn’t weak to Ice, meaning it doesn’t exacerbate a team's weakness to Pokemon like Articuno and Tentacruel nearly as much as other options like Dragonite, Aerodactyl, and Tangela. Versus its closest competitor, Dragonite, Gyarados has an additional point of Speed and STAB Water-type moves. Gyarados can thus reliably revenge kill Dragonite and Venusaur and deal more damage to Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Haunter.</p> <p>While Gyarados may be able to shake off Blizzard, Thunderbolt absolutely terrifies it. Electabuzz and Raichu are very likely to OHKO Gyarados with the move and Persian, even with its underwhelming Special stat, scores a clean 2HKO. Gyarados’s weakness to Rock can be similarly exploited; while Gyarados is a strong answer to Dugtrio, Rock Slide can deal some hefty damage, especially with a critical hit. Finally, while Gyarados is rather bulky, it lacks any form of reliable recovery, and it isn’t particularly quick. This means that it can be worn down over the course of a match when used too liberally.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Gyarados will most often run Body Slam and Blizzard, it can potentially drop one to run all of Hyper Beam, Thunderbolt, and Hydro Pump. Body Slam is tough to drop because it is a very consistent midground option, but the additional coverage may be desirable if, for example, Gyarados is being used as more of a revenge killer than a defensive piece. Dropping Blizzard leaves Gyarados unequipped to handle Dragonite, as well as Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela.</p> <p>Fire Blast is Gyarados’s strongest move against Articuno, scoring a guaranteed 3HKO. It lacks the same coverage as Blizzard, failing to handle Dragonite and Dugtrio, but it reliably handles Grass-type Pokemon and the occasional Bug-type Pokemon like Pinsir or Venomoth. The move also carries a dangerous burn chance, which can severely cripple wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite and physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Thunder is another potential special attack, notably scoring an OHKO on opposing Gyarados, possible 2HKO on Omastar and Dewgong, and a guaranteed 3HKO on Vaporeon and Articuno. However, its poor accuracy keeps it from being commonplace.</p> <p>Because of its bulk and array of strong matchups, Gyarados can run Rest to improve its longevity. The move can make Gyarados a more persistent check to Pokemon like Dugtrio, Dragonite, and bulky Water-type Pokemon. Gyarados can potentially burn sleep turns in front of these Pokemon or during Tentacruel’s Wrap. Rest remains a fairly niche option, however, as many Pokemon can switch in and OHKO or 2HKO Gyarados and it costs Gyarados a valuable coverage move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-type Moves</strong>: Electabuzz, Raichu, and the rare Electrode all outspeed Gyarados and have a chance to OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Unless they are paralyzed, these Pokemon will virtually always KO Gyarados or force it to switch. Haunter is another dangerous Pokemon as, in addition to outspeeding and 2HKOing Gyarados with Thunderbolt, it can come in for free on Body Slam and Hyper Beam. Haunter’s high Special also guarantees that it will survive two Hydro Pumps. Persian also outspeeds and 2HKOes Gyarados, but it is more afraid of its special moves. Clefable is also guaranteed to 2HKO Gyarados and Raticate has good odds to do so as well. Persian, Clefable, and Raticate also have the benefit of being immune to Body Slam paralysis, meaning they can switch in more confidently than most Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Gyarados's Thunderbolt has a 47.1% chance to 3HKO Articuno, and Fire Blast and Thunder guarantee the 3HKO. Articuno, on the other hand, outspeeds Gyarados and 3HKOes with Blizzard. Outside of a Body Slam paralysis or critical hit, Gyarados generally cannot pressure Articuno, meaning Articuno is often free to take it out or set up with Agility and sweep. Without a super effective move, Gyarados struggles to even 3HKO.</p> <p><strong>Kangaskhan</strong>: Kangaskhan outpaces Gyarados and can potentially 3HKO it with either two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam or three Rock Slides. This means Kangaskhan will reliably defeat Gyarados unless it is carrying Hydro Pump; even with Hydro Pump, the matchup is inconsistent due to its mediocre accuracy and the risk of paralysis from Body Slam. Kangaskhan can even potentially switch in against Gyarados, as it can't be paralyzed by Body Slam and has a chance to survive two Blizzards afterward.</p> <p><strong>Rock Slide</strong>: While Gyarados switches into Dugtrio's Earthquake without fear, it must be cautious of Rock Slide. Repeated chip damage from Rock Slide makes Gyarados much less effective as a tank. Moreover, if Dugtrio lands a critical hit, Rock Slide will cost Gyarados over half of its health. Likewise, Golem has little business staying in against Gyarados, but if it predicts the switch or is behind a Substitute, it can hit with Rock Slide and take away over half of Gyarados’s health.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: While Gyarados handles status effects better than other Dugtrio checks like Dragonite and Tangela, it still prefers to avoid them. Being poisoned greatly reduces Gyarados's ability to repeatedly switch in and makes it easier to KO; for example, Dugtrio can 3HKO a poisoned Gyarados with Rock Slide. Moreover, Gyarados becomes incapable of stalling partial-trapping moves like Tentacruel's Wrap and Pinsir's Bind. While Fire Blast is not otherwise threatening to Gyarados, being burned similarly reduces its defensive utility and ability to hit and run. Moreover, it cripples Gyarados's offensive presence; a burned Gyarados can't even 2HKO Kadabra. Lastly, paralysis shortens the list of Pokemon that Gyarados can reliably threaten. Pokemon that Gyarados often preys on, like Hypno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and paralyzed Kadabra, handle Gyarados much better when it is paralyzed. Additionally, most of Gyarados's moves have imperfect accuracy, meaning it may have trouble dealing damage when paralyzed. Hydro Pump, for example, has a dismal 59.8% chance to hit if Gyarados is paralyzed. Dugtrio in particular exploits this accuracy problem, as it often carries Substitute and can thus fish for misses or full paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Tentacruel is the strongest Water-type check, as it can outspeed and immobilize Gyarados with Wrap; considering Gyarados doesn’t handle chip damage very well, this will usually force it to switch. Without Thunderbolt, Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong can be tricky, as they can repeatedly use Rest and gradually chip down Gyarados with Body Slam or Blizzard. Opposing Gyarados also become an issue, as Thunderbolt is a clean 2HKO. With Thunderbolt, these matchups are decidedly favorable, but they may result in Gyarados losing some health or being paralyzed, which may inhibit its ability to check Dugtrio.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "All-out Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is Gyarados’s primary attack and a great way to spread paralysis; many Pokemon that look to switch into Gyarados, like Electabuzz and Tentacruel, loathe getting paralyzed. This makes it a great option when it comes face to face with Dugtrio and other Pokemon that are likely to switch out. The move is also just generally quite strong thanks to Gyarados’s base 125 Attack stat, which ties Pinsir for the third-highest in the tier. Blizzard is a great deterrent when facing Dragonite that also helps against Pokemon like Venusaur, Tangela, Dodrio, and Aerodactyl. If Gyarados isn’t running Hydro Pump, Blizzard is its best option against Pokemon with poor Special like Dugtrio and Kangaskhan. Hyper Beam is extremely strong and can eliminate many prominent threats pretty early. Tentacruel and Hypno drop to the move when they are just below 50% health and Kadabra can even be OHKOed by it, though it is unlikely. The move is thus a very strong tool for revenge killing, especially against paralyzed targets. Hyper Beam is also great for taking out common switch-ins when they are at low health or as a last-ditch hit. Thunderbolt is a powerful tool against the many bulky Water-type Pokemon in UU, 3HKOing Omastar and Dewgong while 4HKOing Vaporeon. While these Pokemon somewhat threaten Gyarados, especially via Body Slam paralysis, Gyarados can reliably break through them if needed. This is a key advantage Gyarados holds over every other notable Dugtrio check. Funnily enough, Thunderbolt also prevents Gyarados from being walled by opposing Gyarados. Lastly, Hydro Pump is Gyarados’s strongest move, narrowly beating out Hyper Beam. Hydro Pump makes quick work of most weak and neutral targets, notably OHKOing Dugtrio, Golem, and Aerodactyl, 2HKOing Persian and Kangaskhan, and 3HKOing Kadabra, Haunter, and sometimes Hypno. It is also a decent option against Articuno and Omastar if Gyarados isn’t packing Thunderbolt. Selecting Gyarados’s last two moves often comes down to team composition.</p> <p>Using Gyarados successfully often comes down to getting it in safely, letting it deal as much damage as possible, without worrying too much about its middling speed and lack of recovery. Keeping Gyarados healthy is essential for consistently checking Dugtrio; after taking a mere 16%, Rock Slide will always 3HKO, meaning Gyarados may lose to Dugtrio on the switch if it can't OHKO it. Encouraging Pokemon like Dugtrio, Golem, and Kangaskhan to use Earthquake is a very good way to get Gyarados in, as it will take no damage and force out the first two Pokemon rather consistently. Gyarados can pressure Kangaskhan, especially if it has Hydro Pump, but Kangaskhan may choose to stay in as it can win the matchup with two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam or three Rock Slides. Once Gyarados is revealed, it becomes a very strong deterrent to using Earthquake; for example, Dugtrio is very likely to use Slash or Rock Slide instead, which makes it much easier to manage.</p> <p>Gyarados is typically reserved for checking Dugtrio before anything else. However, if Dugtrio dealt with or absent from the opponent’s team, Gyarados becomes a lot more flexible. It is quite good at breaking through many common defensive Pokemon and shrugging off their hits; it effortlessly comes in against Surf, which helps it bully Water-type Pokemon like Vaporeon and Omastar late-game. It can also withstand a few Wrap hits from Tentacruel and wait for a miss if it must. Gyarados can prevent every Water-type Pokemon from repeatedly using Rest without really fearing any of their moves. It also comes in quite comfortably against offensively weaker Pokemon like Tangela and Aerodactyl, especially if it can come in on Mega Drain and Fire Blast, respectively. Gyarados also works well as a revenge killer thanks to the power of Hyper Beam and Hydro Pump. It can reasonably KO most slower Pokemon after some damage, but Hypno and paralyzed Kadabra are two particularly common targets, as Gyarados can switch in when they use their recovery moves.</p> <p>Gyarados partners best with Pokemon that appreciate a reliable switch-in for Dugtrio, like Tentacruel, Haunter, Electabuzz, and Raichu. They are also all quite good at baiting Dugtrio to use Earthquake, which helps Gyarados get in safely and repeatedly. Electabuzz and Raichu are also good switch-ins against opposing Electric-type Pokemon, with which Gyarados struggles. Persian is another good partner, as Gyarados matches up fairly well against most of its checks and answers: Dugtrio, Omastar, Golem, and Aerodactyl. Aside from Dugtrio, these Pokemon are quite likely to switch into Persian, giving Gyarados an opportunity to come in on a double switch. Articuno, Dragonite, and Dodrio appreciate Gyarados as is a solid answer for the bulky Water-type Pokemon that wall them. These Pokemon also help Gyarados check Dugtrio, allowing it to play more flexibly. Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela switch in comfortably against the Thunderbolts that often target Gyarados, and they too take some pressure off of Gyarados as a dedicated Dugtrio check. Fast sweepers like Dugtrio and Aerodactyl are really good at cleaning up teams after Gyarados has mounted a lot of chip damage by pivoting in against opposing Dugtrio and other Pokemon it threatens. Dugtrio also does a good job at punishing Electric-type Pokemon, Haunter, and Persian, which can threaten Gyarados.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Gyarados clings to RBY OU relevance thanks to a combination of massively inflated stats, expansive coverage in moves like Thunderbolt and Blizzard, and a unique typing that makes it the only Water-type immune to Ground, letting it switch in on a predicted Earthquake with impunity. That typing lets it synergize with Pokemon like Chansey, Gengar, and Jolteon, which not only appreciate this immunity, but also help patch up its own Thunderbolt weakness. Gyarados's attacking stats are extremely high, allowing it to achieve feats such as 2HKOing Tauros and 3HKOing Snorlax with Hydro Pump, letting it win against them one-on-one. Plus, it's bulky to the point that even a Thunderbolt from Starmie fails to OHKO it without a critical hit. It's not exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, outrunning Pokemon like Cloyster, Dragonite, and Victreebel while threatening them with its coverage. Overall, Gyarados can be seen as a battering ram that blows past paralyzed teams.</p> <p>However, while it may have been a big threat in the early days of the generation, Gyarados fell out of favor due to its typing giving it some horrendous weaknesses. While its Ground immunity looks enticing to switch in on Rhydon, it also takes huge damage from Rock Slide: its bulk isn't as good as it looks. It also gets a quadruple weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Blizzard and Psychic, making it hard for Gyarados to get in against the special attackers of the tier and forcing teams to make up for it. If paralyzed, this gets even worse, as Gyarados's lack of reliable recovery makes it very easy to wear down as is. Even offensively, because of a criminal lack of physical STAB moves, Gyarados struggles to damage specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Gengar. Finally, Gyarados has issues distinguishing itself from Lapras outside of its typing and superior Attack, which has the same coverage and higher overall bulk. As a result of these flaws, Gyarados is a very rare sight in RBY OU, often requiring extensive support from a dedicated team to function properly, but it remains a serviceable pick in the hands of an experienced player.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Surf can be used if Hydro Pump's consistency is problematic, but this reduces Gyarados's immediate threat level. Worse still, it's not that much better than Blizzard in practice damage-wise, making it largely redundant. Thunder is a serviceable option to 2HKO Starmie and Slowbro, but its criminally low accuracy and lack of benefit outside of this make it mostly suboptimal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar can switch in on Gyarados and KO it with Thunderbolt if it's taken even a modicum of damage. However, it can't repeatedly switch into Hydro Pump, lest it get 3HKOed in the process.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can effortlessly take Gyarados's special coverage; Reflect sets are also depressing to fight against. Additionally, Chansey's access to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave makes it very risky for Gyarados to contest unless its moveset has already been successfully scouted. However, Gyarados can KO Chansey with Hyper Beam from 49.3% onwards if Reflect isn't active—even above 75% with Body Slam + Hyper Beam—which makes a paralyzed Chansey very possible to beat.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Lapras</strong>: While it gets Thunderbolt, Gyarados struggles to deal with Starmie and Lapras due to their Hydro Pump resistance and ability to simply outdamage Gyarados with their own coverage. Starmie is of particular note because of its access to Thunder Wave, which firmly shuts down Gyarados. However, it has to risk Body Slam paralysis when switching in, which can potentially incapacitate it for the rest of the game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type coverage</strong>: Any Pokemon with Thunderbolt is automatically a Gyarados check. Jolteon and Zapdos cleanly OHKO Gyarados with their STAB Thunderbolts. If Tauros and Persian run Thunderbolt, they can 2HKO Gyarados off the bat, the latter of which is arguably more threatening because of its high critical hit rate. However, all of these Pokemon would rather avoid taking direct damage, as they have mediocre bulk; they win one-on-one, but they are not reliable defensive answers by any means.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: If not running Blizzard, Exeggutor resists both of Gyarados's special coverage options and threatens with massive damage or sleep in return. Even with Blizzard in the equation, a Special drop from Psychic can instantly ruin any chance of Gyarados actually winning. However, Exeggutor doesn't want to take a Blizzard, as it often wants to save its bulk for more pressing matchups, particularly Rhydon and Snorlax.</p>",
      "sets": {

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Gyarados's Hydro Pump is no joke, letting it potentially 3HKO Snorlax and 2HKO Tauros, winning against them one-on-one. However, it should be remembered that Hydro Pump's inconsistency can and will lead to wasted turns. Additionally, Thunderbolt Tauros can tear Gyarados apart anyway, so it must be scouted for first. Thunderbolt gives Gyarados a fighting chance against all Water-types, most importantly Starmie, Cloyster, Slowbro, and Lapras. However, Blizzard can be used to 3HKO Exeggutor instead, which Gyarados otherwise struggles against. Body Slam allows Gyarados to scout for switch-ins while threatening with paralysis, making use of its great Attack stat in the process; this also prevents Starmie, Alakazam, and Jolteon from switching in safely, and it allows Gyarados to pressure Chansey with significant damage on a critical hit. To top it off, Hyper Beam blows past non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam, KOing them from 58% and 63.5% onwards, respectively, which Body Slam can set it up for.</p> <p>Gyarados functions as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker that forces the opponent into making predictable decisions. It can be brought in early on a predicted Rest from Snorlax—a common sight in the early-game in RBY—then threaten it with Hydro Pump from there to force damage onto the opposing team. Gyarados's high Special and Water resistance make it one of the best Clamp absorbers in the game too, so it's very capable of switching in on a predicted one from Cloyster. Outside of this though, due to its typing, Gyarados's switch-in opportunities are quite limited, mostly being reserved to generic methods like pivoting with partial trapping, gambling on full paralysis, and Explosion. However, Gyarados's typing makes it well-equipped for double switching against Earthquake, allowing it to ease in Pokemon like Jolteon and Chansey if the situation calls for it.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Lapras's STAB Blizzard and tremendous bulk give it positive matchups against many of the physical attackers of Ubers, namely Swords Dance Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax. Its Speed is just enough to outrun Chansey and Exeggutor, which it can potentially threaten with Sing, disrupting common sleep strategies. Because Lapras is so hard to wall as a result of BoltBeam coverage, absorbing its Sing with paralyzed Pokemon is also very difficult; it can blow past Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie easily when they're paralyzed. Furthermore, Lapras is generally not concerned with taking paralysis itself, and when it's paralyzed it can potentially switch in on sleep moves from Pokemon like Exeggutor and threaten massive damage thereafter. Lapras's quadruple resistance to Ice and immunity to freeze lets it switch into certain Ice-type moves, notably against Chansey, softening a somewhat common Mewtwo removal strategy. Lapras's ability to trade hits favorably against almost the entirety of Kanto's finest allows it to clear the way for even stronger allies, positioning them for a quick beatdown.</p> <p>However, Lapras's lack of reliability comes back to bite it very frequently. It's easily worn down over the course of a game, as its Speed often forces it to take a hit before it can make a move, and it crucially lacks reliable recovery. Being weak to Thunderbolt and neutral to Psychic doesn't help it either, and an untimely critical hit can significantly limit the impact it will have over the course of a game. Additionally, Lapras faces stiff Water-type competition in Cloyster and Starmie. Both are faster than Lapras, and Cloyster has access to Clamp and Explosion, while Starmie has Recover and Thunder Wave. While they can't replicate its power or Sing access, they usually bring more consistent utility to a team, which often pushes Lapras out during teambuilding.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lapras has a massive movepool that's worth delving into; however, Blizzard and Thunderbolt are generally undroppable. Hyper Beam can be used on Lapras's Confuse Ray set over Body Slam, providing a better matchup against Jynx by allowing a KO with two Thunderbolts followed by Hyper Beam. Lapras has access to Psychic, which can trigger a Special drop overflow against a +5 Mewtwo with maximum investment, but it has little use outside of this. Ice Beam can be used for the additional PP and accuracy, but the drop in power noticeable—for example, Ice Beam fails to reliably 2HKO Exeggutor or come close to 2HKOing Tauros. Since Lapras wants to win a single notable KO through sheer bulk and power, it tends to be counterproductive.</p> <p>Lapras can attempt to use a Rest set that allows it to try to repeatedly win trades, but this cedes momentum to Mewtwo and Thunderbolt users like Zapdos. This can be used alongside Reflect to make Lapras a pain for Swords Dance Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax to deal with, but this is performed more effectively by Pokemon like Zapdos and Aerodactyl. This set also ends up making it extremely weak against Mewtwo, which pressures it effortlessly with nuclear special attacks and the ability to set up while Lapras is asleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While Lapras deals massive damage to Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode, notably 2HKOing the former due to its Blizzard weakness, Lapras will quickly get forced out if it can't KO them outright. They deal massive damage with STAB Thunderbolt, with Jolteon and Zapdos 2HKOing it and Electrode doing so after mild chip damage. Additionally, their high critical hit rates can turn a 2HKO into an OHKO. Lapras should only attempt to win if they are paralyzed and the team lacks adequate switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo frequently uses Thunderbolt, and while this can't 2HKO Lapras unboosted, Mewtwo will frequently be at +2 or higher. Lapras struggles to damage Mewtwo at all, with an unboosted Mewtwo only taking around a quarter from Blizzard. The maximum damage Lapras can deal to it is 29.8% with Hyper Beam. The best shot Lapras has of winning is via parafusion tactics.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: While Lapras can use Hyper Beam to KO Chansey from a range of 37.9% to 44.6% and has the potential to freeze it or put it to sleep, Chansey has numerous ways to beat Lapras. A paralyzed Chansey is generally not afraid of non-Confuse Ray Lapras, stonewalling it, and Sing variants can fire off uncontested sleep with little Lapras can do. Light Screen variants designed to beat Mewtwo can also nullify Lapras's main strength, its powerful STAB Blizzard. Chansey can also threaten Lapras with a 3HKO from Thunderbolt. Sing Lapras teams should not paralyze Chansey and instead aim to use Lapras's faster Sing to force sleep onto the opposing team. This can be done through switching in on a predicted Seismic Toss or Ice Beam, both of which Lapras shrugs off.</p> <p><strong>Amnesia Snorlax</strong>: The minute Snorlax scores an Amnesia boost, Lapras is incapable of making any meaningful progress against it outside of a lucky freeze or critical hit. Because Snorlax takes a chunk from Blizzard switching in or trying to set up on Lapras, it's not the worst matchup, but it can quickly become unwinnable if Snorlax gets a free chance to set up.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: While uncommon, Rock Slide Mew is a terrible matchup for Lapras, 2HKOing it at +2. Niche Mew variants may also use Thunderbolt to possibly 3HKO it. However, other sets are terrified of sustained assaults from Lapras, especially when paralyzed, as Lapras's Blizzard has a favorable chance to 3HKO Mew. Confuse Ray Lapras variants are very annoying for Swords Dance Mew to deal with, as confusion damage increases due to its Attack boosts. Confusion damage uses the opponent's Reflect in damage calculation, so if Mew has Reflect active, confusion damage will ignore it.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: While rarer in the Ubers landscape, these Pokemon can paralyze and trade blows with Lapras easily if not paralyzed themselves, mostly thanks to their access to Recover. Alakazam can 3HKO Lapras with Psychic if it lands a single Special drop or critical hit, which is likely in a prolonged interaction. Starmie is a particularly poor matchup, possessing Thunderbolt to potentially 3HKO Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar 3HKOes Lapras with Thunderbolt while only being 3HKOed by Blizzard, and it can switch into Lapras's Thunderbolt or Normal-type coverage and still win one-on-one. It also possesses a more accurate sleep-inducing move in Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Leads</strong>: When faced with a faster sleep lead, such as Gengar, Jynx, or Hypno, Sing Lapras tends to be nothing more than a free opportunity for the opponent to try to land sleep or KO Lapras, which is dissuaded from switching out and letting a teammate be put to sleep.</p>",

        "Confuse Ray": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Lapras's STAB Blizzard is no joke, OHKOing Dragonite and almost always OHKOing Rhydon and Golem. It also 2HKOes notable Pokemon like Zapdos, Exeggutor, Persian, and sometimes even Tauros. Tauros is a notable matchup, as few Pokemon are capable of beating it in a head-on fight; not only can Lapras potentially 2HKO it, but it can also survive two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. Thunderbolt ensures Water-types like Cloyster, Starmie, and Slowbro can't wall Lapras, as it 2HKOes Cloyster and 3HKOes the others. Body Slam allows Lapras to be more self-sufficient in spreading paralysis, which also supports parafusion with Confuse Ray. It also gives Lapras an effective move against Jynx, rarely 3HKOing it.</p> <p>Thanks to RBY's brutal confusion mechanics, when supported with paralysis, Lapras can position itself into a positive matchup against most Swords Dance Mew variants, including Reflect sets. A single +2 self-hit puts Mew into Blizzard 2HKO range, and from there, Lapras tends to win the interaction. Another application consists of disrupting paralyzed Mewtwo and Slowbro's Amnesia setup, but outside of this, it's generally quite weak.</p> <p>Confuse Ray Lapras works best as a mid-game threat that disrupts conventional offensive strategies. Progress-makers like Snorlax and Mew tend to have trouble combatting Lapras, as they cannot KO it quickly. However, this only works consistently from full HP: thus, Lapras should be kept for one single, favorable trade before going on its rampage. Lapras benefits from an allied Mew with Thunder Wave, which is one of the most consistent methods of landing paralysis against a myriad of threats, most notably including opposing Mew. Other paralysis support options include Alakazam, Chansey, Jolteon, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Slowbro. Lapras teams tend to struggle against Zapdos, so Jolteon is a suitable partner, though Rhydon is also suitable for a more definitive answer.</p>"

        "Sing Lead": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to the presence of Exeggutor and Tauros in the lead slot, Lapras is capable of being a decent lead itself. It possesses the ability to outspeed and 2HKO Exeggutor with its STAB Blizzard or land Sing before getting put to sleep itself. Against Tauros, it is able to stomach two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam and is virtually never KOed without a critical hit. In return, it can attempt to put Tauros to sleep or fire off Blizzard, which will 2HKO a little over a quarter of the time. Lapras can use its excellent coverage and bulk to use Thunderbolt against Starmie and unboosted Slowbro mid-game. It also completely stonewalls Cloyster, forcing it to use Explosion or switch out in fear of being 2HKOed by said Thunderbolt. Blizzard's 10.2% freeze chance also means Lapras can potentially flip a game on its head by securing a freeze on the likes of Chansey or Mewtwo. Hyper Beam is used in the last slot as a decent finishing tool against Chansey, KOing from about 40%.</p> <p>While Lapras does have many qualities that make it enticing as a lead, it also suffers from some bad matchups. Jynx, Gengar, Jolteon, and Zapdos all are common leads that make the Lapras user start off on a terrible foot. Zapdos and Jolteon are massively threatening with STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes Lapras, and they have a good chance to OHKO outright thanks to their high critical hit rates. While Zapdos is 2HKOed by Blizzard, this is still a very favorable matchup for it. Jynx and Gengar both outspeed and carry their own more accurate sleep-inducing moves, threatening to put Lapras to sleep before it can do anything. Lapras also suffers from its lack of recovery, often being worn down very quickly while taking stray hits from Snorlax and Mew. This makes it quite difficult to facilitate Lapras, especially when common Pokemon like Chansey and Thunderbolt Mewtwo can switch in repeatedly and shrug off the damage with their reliable recovery, only fearing being frozen.</p> <p>Lapras and its traits make it somewhat matchup dependent, as it can be quite devastating against teams that rely on Exeggutor for sleep or Cloyster for their Snorlax check. It is best to maximize your gain early on, putting something to sleep and using Blizzard to aim for a freeze. If these goals are achieved, then sacrificing Lapras to the likes of Sing Chansey is often optimal. One additional benefit is the lack of Thunderbolt on Chansey in Ubers, meaning it is typically safe to stay in and fish for a freeze while Chansey tries to put it to sleep. Additionally, if threats such as Cloyster are revealed, Lapras should be kept healthy to repeatedly switch in and freely use Blizzard into incoming Chansey and Mewtwo.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Lapras is a potent special attacker backed up by solid bulk and a good variety of coverage and utility moves, such as access to Blizzard and Sing. While it faces strong competition from other Pokemon with similar coverage, such as Starmie, its combination of power and bulk, as well as access to Sing, gives Lapras a unique set of qualities that give it an important niche in the metagame. Access to STAB Blizzard, as well as Thunderbolt, enables it to hit almost every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage, making it quite difficult to switch into. Its Speed is just enough to get by Chansey as well, allowing it to potentially put it to sleep one-on-one. It also has positive matchups against Tauros and Snorlax, two of the strongest Pokemon in the metagame, which can be crucial in many instances.</p> <p>However, Lapras is bogged down by some flaws. Lapras's typing leaves it with a weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Psychic, which often makes it easy to wear down with Pokemon like Starmie and Alakazam running around. It also struggles mightily against Chansey if it can't put it to sleep, which stonewalls it with its incredible bulk. Regardless, Lapras holds a niche in RBY OU, and it sees success on quite a few teams.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam is an alternative STAB option to use in place of Blizzard, but the lack of power is really noticeable and generally not worth the extra accuracy and PP. Rest and Reflect can be used in conjunction to give Lapras much appreciated survivability to answer threats such as Tauros more reliably throughout the game, but the set is easy to pressure via powerful special attacks, particularly Psychic- or Electric-type ones, and the lack of offensive pressure makes it a risky and generally undesirable pick.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Lapras struggles immensely in attempting to break through Chansey. It can easily Soft-Boiled away any damage taken and force Lapras out with the threat of Thunder Wave. Lapras may attempt to put it to sleep with Sing, but the move is inaccurate, somewhat predictable, and completely useless against a paralyzed Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Jolteon</strong>: While Lapras's Blizzard respectively 2HKOes and 3HKOes these Pokemon, team structures that include Lapras generally leave themselves very vulnerable to Electric-type attacks, which Zapdos and Jolteon can easily exploit and punish with powerful Thunderbolts. It may even be preferable to sacrifice Lapras in a one-on-one scenario just to get some chip damage on Zapdos in particular, but the same cannot be said for Jolteon, which should nearly always have the upper hand against Lapras and only fears a potential Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Starmie and Alakazam</strong>: If they are not paralyzed, these two Pokemon can tank any hit Lapras throws at them and Recover off the damage easily while threatening it with Thunder Wave. All Lapras needs to turn the tides on them is paralysis and some correct predictions.</p> <p><strong>Amnesia Snorlax</strong>: Although it takes a while to get going and has to worry about Sing, Snorlax doesn't take much damage from any of Lapras's attacks after one or two Amnesia boosts and can retaliate with Body Slam. Although it is unlikely Amnesia Snorlax would be used as a switch-in, it dominates one-on-one.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<p>Blizzard is Lapras's most powerful attack, allowing it to deal heavy damage to anything that doesn't possess either huge special bulk or a resistance to Ice. Thunderbolt allows Lapras to hit Water-types, giving it the ability to muscle through paralyzed Starmie, which would otherwise be a poor matchup. In the third slot, Hyper Beam is Lapras's best bet to finish off Pokemon with a high Special but low Defense, such as Chansey and Alakazam, which are otherwise good answers to Lapras; however, Body Slam may be preferred, as it gives Lapras the ability to somewhat reliably paralyze opposing Starmie. The last slot is usually Sing, a move that provides great utility and scares off Pokemon that would otherwise function as great Lapras answers, with Chansey usually being the main target. Its low accuracy can be unfortunate, as Lapras doesn't have easy ways to shrug off any status or damage that may come its way, so misses can be particularly devastating. If the sleep move is not necessary, you may opt to run Confuse Ray instead, which is Lapras's best shot at powering through paralyzed special walls.</p> <p>When using Lapras, you should first figure out a plan to take care of Chansey, as it can shrug off Blizzard quite easily. Snorlax's Self-Destruct and Exeggutor's Explosion are usually the best ways to achieve this, as your opponent should be able to preserve their Chansey quite easily by simply switching out if you try to defeat it via repeated Ice Beams, PP stalling, or strong physical attacks. However, it is still possible for Lapras to pressure Chansey via Sing, so if you cannot find an opportunity to threaten it via Explosion, you can still rely on Sing to get the job done. Non-paralyzed Starmie and Alakazam are both answers to Lapras as well, threatening to shut it down with Thunder Wave, as they are simply able to use Recover until Lapras is fully paralyzed. If running Body Slam, you should attempt to predict their entrance and hit them with it; should you manage to paralyze them, Lapras will outspeed them and be much harder to stop. Lapras has great potential to create significant advantages between access to Sing and strong matchups against very popular Pokemon such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon, but its checks must be taken care of before it can have any impact on the game.</p>"

To add insult to injury, even after using Transform Ditto retains its terrible base HP and low critical hit rate, and it uses its subpar original stats when calculating critical hits it deals and receives.

It can also attempt to PP stall Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Chansey. However, it can't PP stall effectively because the first two are extremely hard to switch into once Ditto runs out of PP itself, and the latter 3HKOes Ditto with Seismic Toss due to its HP not changing after it's transformed. Ditto takes on the reduced Speed stat of the paralyzed Pokemon it's transforming into even if it isn't paralyzed itself. It also uses its own stats when landing or receiving a critical hit, making it extremely weak to them. Ditto is completely crippled by paralysis, and its niche of forcing Mew out is done far better by other Pokemon, such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Aerodactyl.

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Vaporeon is generally considered good in the current metagame</p> <hr /> <h3>Overview</h3> <p>Vaporeon stands out as the best among the many bulky Water-types in RBY UU, providing teams with a backbone against offensive behemoths like Tentacruel and Articuno. It often takes multiple Pokemon to KO Vaporeon, and because of its monstrous Special stat, they will also have to take very strong STAB Surfs in the process. Even many super effective attacks, such as Electabuzz's Thunderbolt, will fail to 2HKO it. Vaporeon is capable of dueling and checking mighty physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dugtrio as well. Vaporeon isn't too concerned about paralysis either, making it one of the best absorbers of the status in the tier. Checking Normal-types, Articuno, Dugtrio, and even Tentacruel all in one, Vaporeon blends offense and defense perfectly, making it a very appreciated addition to many successful RBY UU teams.</p> <p>Still, though, Vaporeon is very slow, which can leave it vulnerable to Wrap from Dragonite or Tentacruel. Worse still, if Vaporeon is low on HP, this Wrap use will deny it from healing off damage with Rest. Vaporeon's reliance on Rest will also let heavy-hitting Pokemon like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dugtrio safely switch in on the turn Rest is used, putting Vaporeon in a very precarious position. Being outrun by every sleeper in the tier, bar Tangela, can also make Vaporeon easy to put to sleep again after Rest if Sleep Clause isn't active. Finally, Vaporeon lacks coverage for opposing Water-types, though its higher damage output does tend to let it win prolonged interactions.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydro Pump is an immensely strong option that allows Vaporeon to 2HKO almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, with some standout calculations being 2HKOs on Electabuzz, Persian, and Kangaskhan. However, its accuracy and PP leave much to be desired, making what should be the team's anchor very inconsistent. This also makes it easier for opposing Rest users to PP stall Vaporeon. Acid Armor lets Vaporeon wall physical attackers like Dodrio and Kangaskhan as well as take much less chip damage from Wrap, which can define late-game scenarios when its checks are removed. However, since it doesn't help against Persian or special attackers, which are just as common, it's difficult to justify.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gyarados</strong>: Gyarados resists Surf and takes 27.7% maximum from Blizzard, all while possessing coverage in Thunderbolt to 4HKO Vaporeon, which can be turned into a 3HKO with Hyper Beam. Vaporeon simply can't risk contending with a healthy Gyarados and will be forced out by it frequently. Furthermore, the best counterplay to Vaporeon is to switch in on a predicted Rest to give it what for, and Gyarados is among the best punishes to a resting Vaporeon in the tier thanks to its offensive prowess.</p> <p><strong>Venusaur</strong>: Venusaur outspeeds Vaporeon and threatens it with either an uncontested Sleep Powder or a 2HKO from Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a particularly heavy punish to a resting Vaporeon as a result. The punish especially hurts if it's running Swords Dance, allowing it to set up and still get the 2HKO before Vaporeon can act. However, Venusaur really doesn't want to switch into Blizzard, which deals up to 60%, adding a degree of risk to the prediction game.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is capable of switching in on Vaporeon's Body Slam and can 3HKO with Thunderbolt about half the time. Additionally, if necessary, Explosion KOes Vaporeon from half HP. Since it's faster, Haunter can also threaten Vaporeon with Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Normal-type Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers, like the tier's resident Normal-types, are great at switching in on and punishing Vaporeon's Rest. Persian is the most reliable method of dispatching Vaporeon, 3HKOing it with Slash. While less consistent overall, Dodrio and Kangaskhan can KO Vaporeon after two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. However, none of these Pokemon want to contest Vaporeon's nuclear attacks, especially if it runs Hydro Pump, which 2HKOes all of them. Even without Hydro Pump, Surf and Blizzard alike have odds to 2HKO them as well.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electabuzz, Raichu, and the rare Electrode can switch in on Rest and 3HKO Vaporeon with STAB Thunderbolt. Plus, thanks to their high Speed stats, a critical hit from any of them is reasonably likely and can be difficult for Vaporeon to recover from later. In a tight spot, Electrode also guarantees a 2HKO using Thunderbolt + Explosion. However, they all take significant damage from Surf, which they can't afford in the long run. In fact, if they switch in on Surf, they're liable to lose the one-on-one, making them deceptively shaky checks.</p> <p><strong>Swords Dance Tentacruel</strong>: If using a Swords Dance set, Tentacruel can swiftly chip Vaporeon down through Wrap damage and KO it from half HP with a +2 Hyper Beam. However, Tentacruel can't afford to switch into Body Slam, lest it gets forced into Rest much earlier than usual, and the Swords Dance set rarely runs Rest anyway. If Tentacruel doesn't have Swords Dance, however, Vaporeon can absolutely fish for a Wrap miss to either try for Body Slam paralysis or use Rest to PP stall. Ergo, standard Tentacruel sets should not be considered reliable Vaporeon checks.</p> <p><strong>Dewgong</strong>: If using Ice Beam, Dewgong can engage in a freeze war with Vaporeon which, given it exhausts all its PP, has an 81.98% chance of succeeding. Since its Ice typing makes it immune to being frozen itself, and its Water typing lets it resist Vaporeon's STAB moves, Dewgong is a serviceable answer to Vaporeon. However, Dewgong is less bulky than Vaporeon, making it more difficult to wake up from Rest in the long run. This also causes it to fail to outdamage Vaporeon in prolonged interactions.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Surf and Blizzard is resisted only by Water-types and allows Vaporeon to deal significant damage to teams thanks to its incredible Special. STAB Surf is very powerful, 3HKOing Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Kadabra, and Persian. Crucially, it also lets Vaporeon consistently OHKO Dugtrio, making it a very important check. Blizzard 2HKOes Venusaur and Dodrio, as well as possibly OHKOing Dragonite. Body Slam enables Vaporeon to hit Water-types and thus the entire tier for neutral damage and scout for switch-ins, critically Tentacruel, which can flip the situation on its head if they get paralyzed. Tentacruel becomes much more manageable if it gets paralyzed, because it has to use Rest much earlier, so Body Slam denies it free entry. Rest gives Vaporeon significant longevity while removing the paralysis it will likely absorb early-game. Vaporeon's combined great offensive pressure and bulk warps the opponent's offensive play as well; this should be exploited to force out their key offensive Pokemon while getting free turns to scout with Body Slam.</p> <p>Vaporeon fits on a variety of teams. Pairing Vaporeon with almost any Flying-type Pokemon, like Dodrio or Aerodactyl, is a good choice thanks to its Ice resistance allowing it to check Articuno for them. Dragonite works particularly well, providing Vaporeon with an Electric neutrality and Grass resistance to fall back on. The two also offer each other essential paralysis support, as Vaporeon can use Body Slam against targets such as Tentacruel and Kadabra, while Dragonite can use Thunder Wave against offensive Normal-type Pokemon. Moreover, Vaporeon paired with any Flying-type Pokemon is a particularly good way to keep Dugtrio wavering between Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Slash. Oftentimes, Dugtrio is forced to use Slash, which is far easier to play around, at least compared to its nuclear Earthquake. Other Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Venusaur and Dugtrio, also appreciate Vaporeon's presence for similar reasons. Vaporeon makes a particularly potent defensive core alongside the ubiquitous Hypno as well; Vaporeon handles Dugtrio and Normal-types, while Hypno handles Electric-types and Venusaur.</p> <p>Teams that struggle against Wrap, particularly those with frailer Pokemon like Kadabra, will also benefit greatly from Vaporeon's presence, since it can take a massive amount of chip damage before it's in KO range for anything. Vaporeon can also be used alongside other bulky Water-types, such as Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Omastar, to make teams even more resilient to Wrap and offensive pressure. During Rest, remember that being trapped by Wrap still depletes sleep turns, which makes Vaporeon deceptively easy to wake up and therefore very effective for these types of teams. Vaporeon's HP must be carefully managed when against Wrap users, however.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Vaporeon finds a niche in Tradebacks OU as it gains Growth, which allows it to boost its already high Special even higher. Once boosted, Surf mows down most foes with little issue, 2HKOing foes such as Tauros and Persian at +1 and 2HKOing even bulky foes such as Snorlax and Zapdos at +2. This, combined with Acid Armor to patch up its lacking base 60 Defense, lets Vaporeon be a great wall not only specially, but also physically; at just +2 Defense, Snorlax's Body Slam becomes a 6HKO. Vaporeon has much higher base Special compared to the other notable Water-type setup sweeper, Slowbro, dealing good damage with Surf even without any Growth boosts. Vaporeon's higher base Special also allows it to tank special hits much easier; Starmie or Chansey only 4HKO with Thunderbolt. This higher base Special also allows Vaporeon to live a critical hit Thunderbolt from Starmie and Chansey with relative ease, taking just 63.4% maximum from a Starmie Thunderbolt critical hit. Vaporeon's large amount of boosting moves also lets it reapply a paralyzed foe's Speed drop up to nine times, while Slowbro can only reapply a paralyzed foe's Speed drop three times.</p> <p>However, Vaporeon is in stark competition with Slowbro for the role of bulky Water-type, and Slowbro has Amnesia, better physical bulk, and Thunder Wave. Vaporeon also shares Slowbro's issues of having to rely on Rest for recovery and takes a lot more turns than Slowbro to set up, making it quite exploitable. However, once Vaporeon gets the ball rolling, it's hard to stop it, with a +5 Surf mowing over even Water-resistant foes. It also can tank one critical hit Thunderbolt from Starmie, Chansey, or Gengar, which Slowbro can't do due to its worse special bulk. Vaporeon is also noticeably faster than Slowbro, outspeeding the likes of Snorlax, Chansey, Exeggutor, and Rhydon, although it's still not fast enough to outspeed most common foes.</p>",

Surf 2HKOes Tauros, Persian, and often Jolteon at +1, though bulkier foes, such as Snorlax, Zapdos, and Hypno require two Growth boosts to 2HKO. Acid Armor lets Vaporeon boost up its measly base 60 Defense, taking paltry damage at +2 from even the strongest physical attacks; it's 6HKOed at +2 by Snorlax's Body Slam, and 7HKOed by Tauros's Body Slam, allowing Vaporeon to shrug off the damage and use Rest with ease, although Tauros's high critical hit rate makes using Rest in front of it risky, as Vaporeon takes 52.9% minimum from a critical hit Body Slam. Acid Armor also has 61PP, which, in combination with Growth, gives Vaporeon a staggering 122PP at its disposal without cutting into Surf and Rest PP, letting it PP stall any foe with ease. Rest lets Vaporeon heal off any stray hits it may take while setting up. Acid Armor can be dropped within reason, as it isn't always needed for Vaporeon to be an effective sweeper. Ice Beam hits Grass and Flying-types for super effective damage, and at +1 Vaporeon is heavily favored to 2HKO Zapdos and Exeggutor. Body Slam allows Vaporeon to paralyze non-Normal-types, but it deals very little damage. Hydro Pump hits much harder than Surf, notably 2HKOing Tauros and Persian unboosted and 2HKOing Snorlax, Alakazam, and Gengar at +1. However, it's often unreliable due to its low accuracy and PP. Substitute can be used to protect Vaporeon from stray critical hits and grant safety when using Rest, as a +1 Vaporeon's Substitute is not broken by Starmie or Chansey's Thunderbolt; Gengar's Thunderbolt is also not favored to break it.</p> <p>Vaporeon should be used on a team with good paralysis support, as it lacks any meaningful way to paralyze Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey, which might otherwise pose issues to it. Vaporeon can also use Growth and Acid Armor to reapply the speed drop from paralysis, letting it outspeed a paralyzed Starmie or Alakazam even if paralyzed itself. Vaporeon needs physical attacking support to help break through special walls like Chansey and Starmie, so it benefits from partners like a Lovely Kiss or all-out attacking Snorlax, as well as Explosion users such as Exeggutor and Golem, as they can neutralize foes that may cause Vaporeon issues with Explosion or status.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Jolteon stands out as one of the few Pokemon able to stop Zapdos's rampage, resisting its STAB moves while having the capacity to beat it one-on-one. Tradebacks gifts it Growth, making it a threatening setup sweeper as well. Otherwise, Jolteon remains largely the same: having the highest Speed just behind Electrode also gives it one of the highest critical hit rates in the game, standing at 25.39%, which distinguishes it as a strong special attacker. Crucially, this means it outruns tier king Tauros while threatening it with Thunder Wave, a trait shared with only Alakazam, Starmie, and the unviable Electrode. Thus, Jolteon will frequently get off uncontested paralysis that forces predictable plays out of the opponent, taking back momentum very quickly. Finally, Jolteon possesses useful physical coverage in Double Kick and Pin Missile, which gives it the potential to specialize in the matchup against Chansey or Exeggutor.</p> <p>However, much like Zapdos, Jolteon is also countered by Rhydon, which means teams featuring Jolteon will often come across similar weaknesses. Being weak to Ground also doesn't bode well for it, as it means Pokemon like Tauros can exploit it if it gets paralyzed, which frequently happens in the matchups Jolteon comes across. Jolteon is frail in general, taking significant damage from Body Slam. Its damage output outside of Thunderbolt is also quite meager and reliant on its critical hit rate, which makes Jolteon quite inconsistent. While Growth is a useful tool that can patch up Jolteon's power issues, it gives Jolteon four-moveslot syndrome, as it's forced to drop Rest and forfeit its ability to be a Zapdos answer as well as making it deathly afraid of Thunder Wave.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest or Growth is usually Jolteon's most expendable move, though this forfeits either a consistent Chansey matchup or sweeping potential. Pin Missile is an inconsistent option to cover Exeggutor, but a lack of STAB, bad accuracy, and high damage variance mean that it can often fail and lead to a paralyzed or KOed Jolteon. If leading Jolteon, Pin Missile is recommended to ensure it doesn't let Exeggutor in early. Agility can be used to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis, but using Rest and switching out usually does the job fine in conventional game states. Body Slam helps Jolteon more consistently contest Exeggutor while spreading paralysis and damage at once, but its damage is pitiful. Thunder is a niche option to use alongside Thunderbolt, and it can OHKO Cloyster and 2HKO Alakazam and Snorlax at +1, but its unreliable accuracy makes it dubious.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor dislikes facing Pin Missile, but without it, Jolteon can't fight Exeggutor at all, as it resists Thunderbolt and Double Kick. In return, Exeggutor can threaten Jolteon with STAB Psychic, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: A Rhydon at full HP is the bane of Jolteon's existence, threatening an OHKO with Earthquake. However, Rhydon can't switch in repeatedly, as Double Kick deals 15.4% minimum and up to 33.8% on a critical hit. Once Rhydon is below half HP it is very uncomfortable having to switch in again.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is a strong check to Jolteon if its running Earthquake, which 2HKOes, and even Body Slam threatens Jolteon with a 3HKO and paralysis. In return, unboosted Jolteon can only 4HKO Snorlax without critical hits. At +1 Jolteon falls just short of 2HKOing Snorlax from full, but it has decent odds of breaking through when factoring critical hits, and it can consistently beat Snorlax if it's under 90% HP.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Jolteon is a fragile, fast Pokemon, which makes it one of the Pokemon most debilitated by paralysis. Rest can remove the status, but Jolteon still needs to switch out to remove the Speed drop. Pokemon like Alakazam, Chansey, Zapdos, and Stun Spore Exeggutor all force non-Rest Jolteon out and majorly inconvenience Rest Jolteon. Starmie and Slowbro can also threaten paralysis if they're healthy and Jolteon hasn't set up Growth yet. However, Growth Jolteon can stay faster than its foes by reapplying the paralysis Speed drop.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Jolteon's bread-and-butter, 2HKOing Pokemon like Cloyster, Starmie, Slowbro, and Lapras. Double Kick primarily targets Chansey, 4HKOing it; Jolteon is favored to break through with critical hits and it will eventually PP stall Soft-Boiled. Double Kick also targets Rhydon, chipping it moderately on entry and essentially preventing it from switching in when below 50% HP due to the risk of a critical hit. Thunder Wave lets Jolteon threaten Pokemon like Tauros and Persian, forcing them out and setting up a sweep for its teammates. Rest lets it consistently counter Zapdos and gives it a long-term advantage against Chansey. Chansey struggles to beat Jolteon even with Seismic Toss because two critical hits or repeated full paralysis are all Jolteon needs to beat it with Double Kick. However, Jolteon tends to let Tauros and other heavy hitters in once it uses Rest, so Jolteon requires careful play and use of double switches to prevent free entry for these threats. An alternative over Rest is Growth, which lets Jolteon assume the role of a setup sweeper. At +1, Jolteon 2HKOes foes like Persian and Tauros and OHKOes Water-types. However, this means losing out on Rest, which forfeits Jolteon's ability to switch into Zapdos and Chansey.</p> <p>If running Rest, Jolteon can remain hidden until either Zapdos reveals itself or a need to break through Chansey emerges. Jolteon finds entry routes on Zapdos and Chansey quite easily, particularly when they are disincentivized to click Thunder Wave, and it otherwise doesn't mind coming in via double switches. Alternatively, Jolteon can be used as a lead, aiming to paralyze whatever is in front of it and force the opponent to make a difficult decision out of the gate. This is especially effective support to physically attacking sleepers like Lovely Kiss Snorlax, as they greatly appreciate paralysis on Psychic-types and Chansey. However, Jolteon dislikes getting paralyzed early itself, and sleep leads can potentially disable it for the rest of the game. Rest Jolteon is best used on teams that are weak to Zapdos, namely those that stack Water-types. Thus, Cloyster, Starmie, and Slowbro all make valid partners. In return, they help stifle Rhydon's attempts to stop Jolteon. If running Growth, Jolteon shouldn't be used as a switch-in to Zapdos and Chansey and should reveal itself when a sweeping route has been established. Given that Chansey, Exeggutor, and Alakazam all pose issues for Jolteon, it enjoys support from sleepers like Lovely Kiss Snorlax, especially if it's running Growth. Exeggutor is also an excellent partner to Jolteon, being one of the most consistent Rhydon switch-ins in the game while also helping to break through the opposing team with Sleep Powder and Explosion.</p>"

This is complimented by it gaining powerful new coverage moves in Super Fang and Explosion to make it the fastest relevant Explosion user. It also has access to a powerful STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes the omnipresent Starmie and 3HKOes many other foes, such as Tauros and Kangaskhan. Its ability to spread paralysis with Thunder Wave is nearly unmatched thanks to its Speed. Jolteon also benefits immensely from the decreased relevance of Ground-types in STABmons, as they threaten to wall it.</p> <p>However. Jolteon is held back by its poor physical bulk, being 2HKOed by most common physical attacks, as well as its Explosion being relatively weak, dealing just over 50% to bulkier foes such as Tauros, Clefable, and Kangaskhan. Jolteon tends to get outpaced in damage, as it can only 3HKO most foes with Thunderbolt. The prevalence of paralysis also doesn't do it any favors, as once it becomes paralyzed, it becomes far less threatening and loses its most valuable trait.</p>",

They also absorb its Explosion extremely well. However, they have to be wary of Super Fang putting them into KO range of a switch-in or revenge killer, such as Tauros and Kangaskhan's Earthquake after two hits with Super Fang.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor resists Thunderbolt and only takes a maximum of 62% from Jolteon's Explosion, and it threatens Sleep Powder and a 3HKO from Razor Leaf. However, Exeggutor has to be wary of Super Fang putting it into Explosion KO range, and critical hit Explosion OHKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: If Jolteon becomes paralyzed, it becomes much less threatening, as its high base Speed is its best trait. It is also much easier to revenge kill if it becomes paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Gengar does not take most of Jolteon's attacks well, as it hates paralysis and is 4HKOed by Thunderbolt, it can switch into and absorb Jolteon's Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Most physical attackers, such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Clefable, 2HKO Jolteon with Slash while only being 3HKOed or 4HKOed in return by Thunderbolt.

It also 3HKOes Tauros and Jynx, 3HKOes Clefable 69.4% of the time, and 4HKOes many bulkier foes, such as Snorlax, Gengar, Alakazam, and Zapdos. Thunder Wave allows it to spread paralysis across the opposing team, with its high base Speed allowing it to get the jump on any unboosted foe. Super Fang is Jolteon's best option against many full HP foes, such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Snorlax, and it makes Jolteon's best switch-ins—such as Golem and Exeggutor—think twice about switching in. However, unlike Thunderbolt, it can miss and cannot score critical hits, making it unreliable at times. Explosion is a powerful tool, OHKOing Jynx and Alakazam 66.7% of the time and doing 72.9% minimum to Chansey. It also does serviceable damage to physically bulkier foes, doing 52.6% minimum to Exeggutor and 54.9% minimum to Tauros. Explosion is also useful for finishing off foes weakened by moves such as Super Fang and Thunderbolt, or it can put a foe into revenge kill range. With Jolteon being the fastest viable Pokemon, it has a lot of leeway in its ability to weaken or paralyze a foe before using Explosion.</p> <p>Jolteon can be used as a lead, a mid-game progress maker, or a late-game cleaner. Its most notable position is in the lead slot, as it can take advantage of its high base Speed, Thunder Wave, and Explosion to be able to threaten all relevant leads, paralyzing lead Gengar and cutting the accuracy of its Hypnosis down to a mere 45% while also threatening other common leads, such as Jynx and Alakazam, with paralysis and Explosion. As a mid-game progress maker, Jolteon uses Thunder Wave and good coverage to revenge kill and force trades with important threats such as Gengar, Clefable, Kangaskhan, and Tauros. Jolteon as a cleaner uses its high base Speed and powerful STAB to pick off weakened foes at the end of a game, beating out other common late-game cleaners such as Starmie. In this case, Jolteon should be kept hidden until the end of the game, as it is much more effective at cleaning if the opponent is caught off guard. It should also be kept hidden until Exeggutor and Ground-types have been eliminated, as these foes pose massive issues for it. All of these Jolteon sets work extremely well when paired with other Explosion users, such as Kangaskhan and Exeggutor, as they can either carry on momentum that Jolteon generates early- and mid-game, or they can remove barriers to Jolteon cleaning, such as Kangaskhan, Exeggutor, and Tauros. Lead Jolteon and mid-game progress maker Jolteon's main utility lies in outspeeding and paralyzing at least one foe, and then threatening foes with strong attacks and Explosion.</p>"

Once boosted, Flareon becomes extremely threatening, with even Fire-resistant Pokemon like Slowbro and Starmie taking over 40% if Fire Blast lands a critical hit thereafter. It's not just a strong special attacker either; Flareon has a solid base 130 Attack stat to support it against Pokemon like Chansey, which it can 2HKO with consecutive critical hit Body Slams.

Its Speed also leaves a bit to be desired, with it being narrowly outrun by Cloyster, often meaning it requires paralysis support to be effective; this also makes it terrified of receiving paralysis itself. Because it demands paralysis support and offers little defensive utility, Flareon is difficult to build around. Additionally, it has no consistent methods of handling Water-types like Starmie and Slowbro, forcing it out and giving these two powerhouses significant momentum. Furthermore, Flareon is extremely inconsistent, relying on consecutive critical hits to KO Pokemon, which tend to only happen around a third of the time at best even after Focus Energy.

In fact, even Rhydon can take up to 60% while being outsped, though that KO is extremely risky to go for. The burn chance is also very helpful, crippling Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros while also aiding in KO ranges; however, landing a burn against Pokemon like Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey can make it significantly harder to beat them in the long run. Body Slam complements Fire Blast well, making Flareon more self-sufficient with paralysis while 2HKOing Chansey and Starmie with consecutive critical hits; however, it's recommended to use Substitute first in this scenario to avoid paralysis. A single critical hit can also put Alakazam into sub-25% range, meaning it cannot use Substitute thereafter; this also puts it in range for Quick Attack to KO. Quick Attack can be used to pick off Pokemon that barely survive Flareon's attacks, or that alternatively have used Substitute to the point they're left with 1 HP. However, Flareon can use Substitute itself for additional safety against paralysis users like Chansey and Exeggutor. It's worth attempting to set up Substitute against paralyzed Pokemon to try and get it for free with full paralysis.

Double-Edge is a valid option, providing a good option to finish off limping Pokemon or pressure Substitute users while avoiding recoil. Additionally, a critical hit Double-Edge can KO Alakazam if it's taken minor damage or used Substitute. Flamethrower is also a fair option as an accurate Fire Blast alternative with far more PP, but the drop in damage is significant. While Hyper Beam's downsides are poor, a critical hit can OHKO Chansey, Jolteon, and Alakazam while KOing Starmie if it's taken even minute damage, though the recharge turn usually leads to Flareon taking paralysis right after.</p> <p>Flareon is best used late-game when the opposing team has likely been paralyzed, though it can also be used to punish a Snorlax or Exeggutor asleep from Rest, which are decently common sights in the Stadium OU metagame. From there, Flareon can set up Focus Energy with impunity and start firing off potentially nuclear blows at the opposing team. While its consistency is poor, the reward often means removing crucial parts of the opposing team, which Flareon's teammates should greatly appreciate. Flareon works best alongside Pokemon that can consistently land paralysis on the opposing team, such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Because it struggles to break past Slowbro, Starmie, and the rare Kabutops, it's recommended to use it alongside consistent checks to them, such as Thunderbolt Chansey alongside Exeggutor.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Despite possessing the highest BST in PU, Flareon is beyond outclassed. While Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar have much lower attacking stats, their excellent Speed improves their matchups across the board. Flareon's bad base 65 Speed, meanwhile, leaves it outsped by most of the metagame, including key threats like Nidoqueen. Even if it can still win against foes like Abra and Pinsir, having to take an extra hit means it gets worn down quickly and revenge killed by faster threats. Flareon often fails to outdamage faster Fire-types, as their higher Speed lets them launch more attacks against the opposing team. They also have traits that offer more game-to-game utility than Flareon's sheer damage. Rapidash outspeeds Fearow, Arcanine has excellent bulk, and Magmar has a diverse movepool, which notably can let it threaten Omanyte, something no other Fire-type can do.</p> <p>Thus, you can only justify using Flareon alongside another Fire-type and heavy paralysis support. With proper support Flareon is a usable wallbreaker, as besides Omanyte, no Pokemon can safely switch into all of its attacks. Notably, it's among the few Pokemon that can reliably 2HKO Porygon. However, most of the time another duo of Fire-types will make more progress with less support, and thus Flareon should rarely see play.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic can be used alongside Fire Spin to let Flareon wear down Omanyte, but this means Flareon must give up Hyper Beam. Reflect can be used over Fire Spin to improve Flareon's matchups against many physical attackers, but its low Speed hampers this. Nidoqueen still 2HKOes Flareon unless it can use Reflect before Nidoqueen can land the first Earthquake, while Fearow's high critical hit rate and Pinsir's Slash can bypass Reflect's Defense boost. While weak, Quick Attack can be used to pick off physically frail foes, like Staryu and Abra.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Omanyte's unique typing lets it take minimal damage from all of Flareon's attacks barring the rare Toxic plus Fire Spin combo, making it Flareon's hardest counter. Seaking outspeeds Flareon and 2HKOes it with Surf and is 3HKOed by Body Slam in return, though Seaking must be wary of Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: Arcanine's higher Speed and physical bulk let it outdamage Flareon one-on-one, especially if it's carrying Reflect.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Flareon with Earthquake, while Flareon's Fire Blast only 2HKOes 3% of the time. Flareon outspeeds Graveler and 3HKOes it with Fire Blast, but it has a 17.9% chance to OHKO Flareon with Earthquake. The rarer Sandslash speed ties Flareon and has a 33.3% chance to OHKO Flareon with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fearow</strong>: Fearow outspeeds and 2HKOes Flareon with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam while only being 2HKOed by Fire Blast in return. While Fearow fears a burn, it is notably immune to Body Slam paralysis cannot be KOed by the combination of Body Slam and Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: While they usually lose to Flareon one-on-one, faster threats like Staryu and Pinsir can easily revenge kill Flareon due to their higher Speed.</p>",

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p><strong>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Porygon is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.</strong></p> <p>Porygon may be the most enigmatic Pokemon in RBY. While it has genuinely awful base stats, it has a wide Special movepool, an immunity to Body Slam paralysis, and two excellent moves in Thunder Wave and Recover. These traits allow it to muster a niche in OU and play a big role in NU. In UU, however, Porygon struggles to find a purpose and has no influence. It is only notable for its ability to bully Pokemon that are unable to either outspeed and 2HKO it or paralyze it, repeatedly using Recover and slowly chipping away at their health. This makes it a decent answer to paralyzed Normal-type attackers, like Kangaskhan, and bulky Water-type Pokemon, like Vaporeon and Omastar. Porygon is only a shaky check, however, as critical hits from Normal-type Pokemon can quickly put it into range of a Hyper Beam and Blizzards from Water-type Pokemon can potentially freeze it. Additionally, some teams simply do not use any of these Pokemon, leaving Porygon entirely without a purpose. Wrappers like Tentacruel, Dragonite, and even Tangela outspeed it, quickly whittle it down with Wrap or Bind, and can pivot out freely to a strong attacker to finish it off. Likewise, paralysis is a surefire way to shut down Porygon, as it will be unable to stall effectively with Recover and will drop quickly if it is fully paralyzed. Because other Pokemon perform Porygon's jobs more consistently while carrying a greater offensive presence, like Clefable, Electabuzz, Venusaur, Gyarados, and most bulky Water-type Pokemon, it is generally not seen in RBY UU.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Staller": {
          "description": "<p>Because Porygon enjoys facing bulky Water-type Pokemon, Thunderbolt is mandatory so it can actually apply some pressure to them. Thunderbolt has a good chance to 3HKO Omastar and Dewgong and will 4HKO Vaporeon. This means Porygon can usually force these Pokemon to switch or use Rest, thus helping its teammates switch in more comfortably. Additionally, Thunderbolt will 2HKO Gyarados, 3HKO Aerodactyl, and 4HKO Tentacruel, making them somewhat hesitant to switch in. Both Ice Beam and Psychic help Porygon match up better against Pokemon that can’t threaten it with paralysis. Ice Beam allows Porygon to potentially beat Dugtrio and Dragonite that aren't carrying Thunder Wave. Ice Beam can also be used in desperate situations to potentially freeze something before it is paralyzed or KOed. Psychic covers Haunter and can more easily pressure Normal-type Pokemon, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon if it happens to get a Special drop. Special drops also reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, which can make paralyzed Porygon somewhat more useful. Both moves also help Porygon against Venusaur. Thunder Wave is a necessity because of Porygon’s downright horrendous Speed. If Porygon is going to stall any Pokemon at all, the Pokemon absolutely needs to be paralyzed, as Porygon must be faster to use Recover successfully and requires free turns from full paralysis to chip it down. Thunder Wave can also potentially catch switch-ins like Tentacruel, Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz. Recover allows Porygon to be a nuisance throughout the entire game. Because of its pitiful defenses, Porygon needs to be at full health to reliably switch into the majority of attacks, meaning it will be using Recover a lot, especially if it plans on switching out soon. Porygon has a few other interesting moves, like Tri Attack, Sharpen, and Agility, but it struggles to make room for or get use out of any of them.</p> <p>Porygon is nearly incapable of making any offensive progress against most teams. If a Pokemon is unable to break through Porygon, it is quite likely to switch to something that can quickly scare it out. Porygon is virtually useless once it is paralyzed, so Pokemon like Hypno are quite likely to switch in. The only Pokemon that pair well with Porygon are those that appreciate its ability to force switches, spread paralysis, and force Water-type Pokemon to use Rest. Thus, possible partners include Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, Kangaskhan, and Articuno.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Porygon's extremely poor stats make it unappealing at first sight, but its access to Recover and Thunder Wave alongside its immunity to Body Slam paralysis gives it a niche. Porygon can switch into the omnipresent Snorlax and use its 32 Recover PP to stall Snorlax out of its 24 Body Slam PP. Non-Amnesia Snorlax sets can only hope to land multiple critical hits in a row or freeze with Ice Beam if Porygon is not carrying Substitute. Porygon can also act as a pseudo-check to other Pokemon unable to reliably status it such as Tauros, Persian, Cloyster, and Gengar, but their higher Speed and likewise higher critical hit rates make switching in a risky proposition.</p> <p>The biggest issue with Porygon is its passivity. Pokemon like Chansey and Exeggutor take minimal damage and threaten to paralyze Porygon, forcing it to switch out, as paralysis makes it incapable of reliably walling Snorlax. Porygon also struggles heavily against the common Amnesia Snorlax; Porygon can only temporarily stall it with Substitute or attempt to freeze it with Ice Beam. To make things worse, Cloyster gives Porygon strong competition as a more reliable check to Amnesia Snorlax and other Normal-types.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Recover and Thunder Wave are both essential for walling Snorlax and threatening paralysis on switch-ins, so Porygon should never drop either of these moves. Ice Beam is Porygon's main attacking move, as it does decent damage, has a chance to freeze, and prevents Rhydon from using Porygon as free entry. Thunderbolt pairs well with Ice Beam as coverage, notably threatening Starmie and Cloyster with a 3HKO, and its 24 PP can be useful in PP stalling. Double-Edge can be used instead of Thunderbolt to threaten Chansey and Alakazam, but it only 3HKOes Alakazam and has a chance to 3HKO Chansey while dealing significant recoil to Porygon. When using Thunderbolt or Double-Edge against Chansey, Starmie, Alakazam, and Slowbro, Porygon should only attack on the switch or if the foe is in KO range, as these Pokemon have Thunder Wave. Porygon can use Blizzard over Ice Beam for high odds of 3HKOing Exeggutor and always 2HKOing Rhydon, but it only has 8 PP, so Porygon needs to play more conservatively than it would with Ice Beam. Psychic can force out Snorlax with repeated Special drops but gives completely free entry to the many Psychic-types that can paralyze Porygon. Thunder can be used as a stronger alternative to Thunderbolt that 2HKOes Cloyster and has a chance to 2HKO Starmie, but its poor accuracy makes this unrealistic. Lastly, Conversion can be used to copy a foe's typing, but this is only useful if Snorlax is already dealt with, as Porygon is extremely likely to take paralysis when using this move.</p> <p>The key to making this set work is paralyzing Snorlax, preferably before Porygon switches in so it doesn't have to risk a critical hit when using Thunder Wave. Once Snorlax is paralyzed, Porygon should use Recover every time Snorlax attacks and only attack when Snorlax is fully paralyzed. Porygon needs to remain unparalyzed to wall Snorlax effectively, so it should almost always switch out when facing Pokemon that can paralyze it. Once Snorlax is forced to use Rest, the Porygon user can bring in a strong special attacker to force Snorlax out. If the opposing Snorlax has Amnesia, Porygon should paralyze it and switch to a teammate that can handle it, such as Starmie, Slowbro, or one's own Amnesia Snorlax. Once the opposing Snorlax is revealed to have Amnesia, Porygon can be used as a weaker Chansey to check an opposing Chansey or Starmie. At full HP, Porygon can also threaten Thunder Wave on faster Pokemon like Tauros and Zapdos, but a critical hit attack puts it in range of being KOed by a non-critical hit attack, making switching in extremely risky.</p>"

        "Substitute": {
          "description": "<p>Porygon makes use of the buffed Stadium Substitute to block status moves and create free turns against paralyzed foes. Snorlax's Ice Beam fails to break Substitute, giving Porygon a free turn and dissuading Snorlax from trying for a freeze. Substitute also makes Recover more efficient, as it allows Porygon to dip below 50% HP risk-free as long as it maintains enough HP to heal out of range of a critical hit Body Slam. Recover and Thunder Wave are crucial, as Recover enables Porygon to stall with Substitute, and paralysis is Porygon's main way of threatening Pokemon that otherwise don't mind switching in and gaining free turns. Ice Beam is the most common choice of attack for its ability to threaten freeze and its solid coverage, hitting Exeggutor, Rhydon, and Zapdos super effectively. Double-Edge is Porygon's strongest reliable STAB move and has more PP than Ice Beam. It does decent damage against most Pokemon, but it does almost nothing to Rhydon, Reflect Snorlax, and Cloyster while dealing recoil damage to Porygon.</p> <p>Substitute Porygon greatly appreciates paralysis support, especially against Snorlax so that Porygon does not have to risk a critical hit when paralyzing it. After Snorlax has been paralyzed, Porygon can use Recover and Substitute to fish for full paralysis and use these opportunities to attack. Depending on the opponent's team, Porygon may not want to reveal its only attack, so it can also PP stall and limit switches with Thunder Wave. This set should be paired with counters for the Pokemon that wall its only attack; for example, Chansey is on nearly every team and supports Porygon greatly, helping against the strong Psychic-types and other special attackers while paralyzing them with Thunder Wave. Slowbro is another great teammate, as it handles Amnesia Snorlax and helps check and paralyze foes that can trouble Porygon such as Exeggutor, Alakazam, Cloyster, and opposing Slowbro. Exeggutor is good for handling Rhydon, making it a great teammate for Double-Edge sets. Porygon can also drop its Speed stat by a single point to underspeed Rhydon, allowing Porygon to constantly use Recover and stall out Earthquake. Unfortunately, Rhydon is still heavily favored to win this matchup, as its Earthquake usually does over 50% to Porygon and OHKOes it with a critical hit, while Ice Beam seldom 2HKOes in return. However, being able to waste Earthquake PP can be quite useful, and Porygon is unlikely to gain anything from speed tying Rhydon if it lacks Ice Beam anyway.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Porygon's decent bulk and almost-unique access to Recover give it a unique role in the tier. Very few Pokemon 2HKO it, allowing Porygon to switch in and slowly chip away at foes such as Arcanine and Seaking while using Recover to heal any damage it takes. Porygon also has a wide movepool; in addition to the aforementioned Recover, it has a plethora of coverage moves that threaten much of the tier for super effective damage, and two forms of speed control: Agility and Thunder Wave. Although Porygon's initial Speed is low, it is fast enough to outspeed Graveler and Omanyte, making it an excellent switch in to the Rock-types, which is especially useful since Graveler is tough to switch into otherwise. Porygon's Normal typing also give it an immunity to paralysis from Body Slam, so the Rock-types can't even fish for paralysis against it. This trait is also useful against foes such as Arcanine and Rapidash. Porygon can be played in two main ways; its longevity can allow it to slowly sweep a team with Agility, or it can be used as a wall, using Thunder Wave to spread paralysis throughout an opposing team.</p> <p>Despite seeming excellent on paper, Porygon has several flaws that prevent it from being among the top threats in the metagame. Its Speed is very low, which means if it switches into an attack, it will get hit twice before being able to act. This generally forces Porygon to use Recover right after switching in, making it quite easy to switch into. In addition, Porygon is very weak to critical hits. For example, although Porygon is 3HKOed by Seaking's Surf, if it switches into a critical hit Surf, Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO. This also hinders Porygon's ability to switch into Nidoqueen; although it only takes a maximum of 42.3% from Earthquake, it can easily be ruined if it gets critically hit on the switch. Porygon's ability to switch into Omanyte is not unique, as top threats in Gastly, Seaking, and Staryu can all switch into it as well, and Porygon must be wary of Graveler's Explosion. For these reasons, Porygon is often brought in after a teammate is KOed, getting a free Thunder Wave or Agility in retaliation. However, Porygon's paralysis-spreading abilities aren't as useful as they seem, since the ubiquitous Nidoqueen is immune to Thunder Wave, and other top threats such as Arcanine, Fearow, and Seaking can all use Agility to alleviate the Speed drop. PU is also generally just a fast-paced tier where teammates such as Fearow, Seaking, and Arcanine appreciate foes being chipped more than paralyzed. Porygon itself is very vulnerable to paralysis, since one full paralysis on a Recover turn can be enough for a foe to KO it.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Agility Porygon can use Blizzard over Psychic, as the move does more damage to Nidoqueen, Fire-types, and Fearow, but the move has less PP and only 4HKOes Gastly, giving it more chances to fish for a Hypnosis hit or a Special drop from Psychic. Tri Attack on support Porygon is an alternative to Double-Edge that lacks recoil, but the greater power of Double-Edge makes it the preferred option. Porygon can use Reflect to become near-unbreakable on the physical side, but it is very hard to fit and doesn't help with Porygon's vulnerability to critical hits. Porygon can also run a set consisting of Sharpen, Recover, Hyper Beam, and Agility, but this set requires several turns of setup and is completely walled by Gastly, and it also struggles to break though Water-types.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: A paralyzed Porygon is much easier to KO due to full paralysis preventing recovery. A paralyzed Porygon can't even switch into Omanyte and Graveler effectively anymore, since the Rock-types now outspeed it and 3HKO it. Although Agility Porygon seems to alleviate the Speed issue, full paralysis is still a major problem for it, and other Agility users can reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, making Porygon slow again.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hits</strong>: Many Pokemon in the tier, such as Nidoqueen, Fire-types, and Seaking, outspeed and 3HKO Porygon, and this becomes a 2HKO if they get a critical hit. This means Porygon is always taking a risk when it switches in, since a critical hit will put it in KO range for a subsequent attack, immediately forcing the user to sacrifice it or switch out. Once Porygon does switch in, there is still the risk of a critical hit every turn, forcing Porygon to use Recover more often than it wants to in order to mitigate the risk, making it passive.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Drowzee outspeeds Porygon and almost always 3HKOes it with Psychic. Drowzee also has Hypnosis and Thunder Wave to threaten Porygon with status, and it doesn't mind Thunder Wave from Porygon that much. Porygon 3HKOes Drowzee with Double-Edge, but if it drops the move, then Blizzard is only a 4HKO. Porygon lacking Double-Edge also struggles against Abra, since Blizzard 4HKOes while Abra outspeeds and 3HKOes in return with Psychic, although it is ruined by Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Although it doesn't appreciate getting hit by Thunder Wave, Machamp easily 2HKOes Porygon with both Submission and Low Kick, while it is only 4HKOed by Blizzard and Double-Edge and 3HKOed by Psychic. Similarly, Pinsir also 2HKOes Porygon with Submission. However, it is important to note that once paralyzed, Submission's chance of landing becomes a pathetic 59.8% and Low Kick is unlikely to connect enough times in a row to break through, so Porygon can beat these foes with luck.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Although Porygon otherwise walls Graveler, it can break through Porygon with Explosion; it has a 43.6% chance to OHKO Porygon, and Porygon's low Speed means it can be revenge killed easily if it survives Explosion. However, it is important to note that once Graveler explodes, Fearow becomes much more deadly, so in some cases it would be wise to invite Graveler's Explosion to enable Fearow. Gastly's Explosion is also dangerous, although its much lower Attack means Explosion will only do a maximum of 60.9%. However, since Gastly is faster, it will end the turn the moment it uses Explosion, preventing Porygon from using Recover. This leaves it in KO range of common attacks such as Nidoqueen's Earthquake and Arcanine's Fire Blast, forcing the Porygon to either sacrifice itself or switch out at low HP, hindering its ability to switch in later.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Since it is slow, Porygon is vulnerable to partial trapping. Dragonair can use Wrap on Porygon and switch in a teammate such as Nidoqueen to force it out, or it can just stay in and wear down Porygon's HP. Although inconsistent, Rapidash's Fire Spin is able to get Porygon into Fire Blast's 2HKO range, since Fire Blast barely misses out on a 2HKO otherwise. It can also let Rapidash pivot out in a pinch.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Agility": {
          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>This set aims to use Agility to alleviate Porygon's low Speed, letting it act as an effective lead that threatens to slowly sweep a team. At +2 Speed, Porygon is faster than every unboosted foe. When Porygon is faster than its foe, it is able to attack whenever it's at high HP, since if it is hit by a critical hit, it will still be able to use Recover to heal off the damage. Psychic hits almost the entire tier for neutral damage and hits Nidoqueen and Gastly super-effectively. Thunder Wave is most common in the lead slot, as it allows Porygon to spread paralysis early and deal with opposing Agility users, which can otherwise boost to outspeed Porygon. Porygon can also reapply the Speed drop from paralysis with its own Agility. However, limiting Porygon to one attacking move can give it serious coverage and PP issues, especially against Drowzee and the rare Abra. This means that if Porygon is used in the back for a sweeping role, it should choose another attacking move. Thunderbolt complements Psychic very well, as it hits Fearow, Seaking, Scyther, and Staryu super-effectively. Porygon can equip Double-Edge to break through the Psychic-types, but the matchup is still quite poor, and Thunderbolt is a better option against more relevant threats.</p> <p>If Porygon carries Thunder Wave, it is more useful early-game and can even be a viable lead. It can use Thunder Wave immediately on the common Arcanine lead and set up Agility thereafter. Against lead Nidoqueen, it can just set up Agility turn 1 then stall out Earthquake PP with Recover. Porygon generally forces in the opponent's Thunder Wave user, most commonly Staryu, allowing Porygon to trade paralysis with it. Sometimes, Gastly can come in instead to attempt to inflict sleep, but Hypnosis's shaky 60% accuracy makes this strategy risky, and Gastly becomes a lot worse once paralyzed. This benefits teammates like Seaking and Nidoqueen, which can deal with Staryu and Gastly once they're paralyzed.</p> <p>If Porygon is using a set that lacks Thunder Wave, it should be reserved for late-game. Despite negating the Speed drop with Agility, this set still hates paralysis, since full paralysis can prevent crucial turns where Porygon has to use Recover. As a result, it is important to KO or weaken paralysis spreaders such as Staryu, Drowzee, and Vileplume beforehand. Once these threats are accounted for, Porygon should ideally enter the field after a teammate is KOed, since directly switching into an attack leaves it very vulnerable to a critical hit. At this point, Porygon is free to set up Agility and try to sweep. Once Porygon sets up, it should only attack when it is near or at full HP, since it is generally KOed by a critical hit if it's any weaker. For example, a critical hit Earthquake from Nidoqueen can do up to 81.9%. Because of this, Porygon should try to stall Nidoqueen's Earthquake PP then attack once the move's PP is fully depleted. Porygon also faces issues from a trio of very common Agility users in Fearow, Arcanine, and Seaking. They can all use Agility themselves to outspeed even a boosted Porygon; in fact, at +2 Speed, Fearow and Arcanine outspeed even a +4 Porygon. Because of this, it is generally recommended that Porygon attacks these foes right away before they have the chance to set up. However, this issue is alleviated if Porygon carries Thunder Wave.</p> <p>Porygon's best teammates are ones that can weaken Thunder Wave users to enable it late-game. Fearow, Scyther, Arcanine, and Rapidash are great teammates since they do heavy damage to all Thunder Wave users; for example, Fearow's Hyper Beam does up to 86.3% on Drowzee and 96.1% on Staryu. Drowzee is also a good teammate since it can trade Thunder Waves with opposing Drowzee and Staryu. Porygon works well alongside other Agility users such as Seaking and Dragonair, as they can work together to wear down checks and sweep a team. Porygon also appreciates the support of teammates that can check the trio of Agility users. Staryu and Gastly check Seaking, while Nidoqueen can take on Fearow and Arcanine while preventing them from switching out safely. If Porygon is used as a lead, Seaking and Nidoqueen are fantastic teammates that can take advantage of the paralysis that Porygon spreads early-game.</p>"

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>This set takes advantage of Thunder Wave and Recover to spread paralysis and wall foes. Porygon paralyzes a foe with Thunder Wave then uses Recover to heal the damage it takes until its foe is fully paralyzed, giving Porygon an opening to attack. Psychic has the best neutral coverage against most of the tier, most notably hitting Gastly super effectively, while Thunderbolt hits top threats such as Fearow, Seaking, and Staryu for super effective damage. Double-Edge is an alternative that hits Drowzee and Abra notably harder, while Blizzard does more to Nidoqueen and Fearow than Thunderbolt, although it gives Porygon a harder time against Water-types.</p> <p>It is not recommended to switch Porygon directly into an attack from faster Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Arcanine, as it leaves Porygon vulnerable to critical hits. The easiest Pokemon for Porygon to switch into are Graveler and Omanyte, as Porygon outspeeds them, allowing it to act before it gets hit a second time. Once Porygon enters the field, it should paralyze the foe and use Recover until the foe is fully paralyzed, then proceed to attack. There are several things to watch out for, though. Agility users can simply use Agility to outspeed Porygon, and Fearow and Arcanine in particular are likely to break through Porygon with critical hits. However, Psychic's chance for a Special drop can re-apply the Speed drop from Paralysis, making the Agility users slower than Porygon once again. Porygon itself hates taking paralysis, since it no longer outspeeds paralyzed foes, and one full paralysis on a Recover turn can be fatal for it. However, in certain scenarios it is worth trading Paralysis with a foe, such as paralyzing an opposing Staryu to enable one's Seaking.</p> <p>Since Porygon walls Graveler and Omanyte while unparalyzed, Pokemon that are forced out by the Rock-types, such as Fearow, Scyther, Rapidash, and Arcanine, are great teammates. They also have great matchups against Thunder Wave users, such as Drowzee and Staryu, making it harder for the opponent to paralyze Porygon. Seaking appreciates Porygon's ability to trade paralysis with opposing Staryu, which walls Seaking while unparalyzed, allowing Porygon to enable a Seaking sweep. Porygon also appreciates other Thunder Wave users to make it easier for Porygon to switch into foes.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Porygon is a small fish in a big pond. Its stats are typical of an unevolved Pokemon, making it much slower and weaker than just about everything. Despite this issue, Porygon's access to Recover and immunity to paralysis from Body Slam give it just enough to be a surprisingly viable pick in OU. These two traits make Porygon an impeccable switch-in to one of the most important Pokemon in OU, Snorlax. Porygon has just enough Speed and physical bulk to switch in against Snorlax and stall out its 24 Body Slam PP with its 32 Recover PP. Most variants of Snorlax will struggle to make any progress against Porygon, meaning Porygon can consistently force it to switch out, as it is almost never worth using Snorlax's Self-Destruct against such a low-value Pokemon. Porygon should always be used with Chansey to create a defensive core; Chansey can handle special attackers like Alakazam and Starmie, while Porygon can handle Snorlax and paralyzed physical attackers.</p> <p>While its matchup against Snorlax is its main selling point, Porygon can wall some other Pokemon in a pinch. Pokemon that are unable to reliably status Porygon will usually struggle to defeat it in a head-to-head matchup. Especially if they are paralyzed, Porygon is relatively comfortable against Tauros and Gengar, for example. However, Porygon has some consistency issues in even its best matchups. Critical hits and strong attacks can expose its poor defensive stats, Ice Beam and Blizzard can freeze it, Special drops from Psychic can overwhelm it, and paralysis can render it unable to wall Snorlax securely. Perhaps worst of all, Porygon can be easily overpowered by Amnesia Snorlax, meaning it will have almost nothing to do against teams with that set.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Porygon has a very deep movepool to play with, both offensively and defensively. Psychic is likely the most valuable alternative coverage move. Psychic comes with a useful chance to drop the foe's Special, but Thunderbolt or a Normal-type move tends to be superior because of the many Psychic-type Pokemon that can come in and scare Porygon out. Psywave is mildly useful as a universal coverage option that can deal up to 150 damage. However, its low accuracy and heavy randomness make it less than reliable.</p> <p>Reflect can make Porygon even more consistent against Snorlax and Tauros. However, it can be difficult to find an opportunity to use it, as Porygon will generally want to heal or use Thunder Wave first in most cases. Flash is another move for bullying Snorlax and common switch-ins. While the move has poor accuracy itself, it can help Porygon keep up some momentum, as most Pokemon will want to switch out after sustaining the accuracy drop. Sharpen can slowly but surely boost Porygon’s Attack so it can deal hefty damage with Tri Attack or Hyper Beam. Setting up with Sharpen is often quite difficult because Porygon is easy to scare off with paralysis, but it can potentially succeed against a weakened or paralyzed team. Recover also makes Porygon unique among other boosting Pokemon, as it can heal and doesn’t necessarily need to commit to attacking once it starts setting up.</p> <p>Conversion is a mildly interesting option that Porygon can use to combat certain special attackers like Alakazam, Jynx, Cloyster, and Jolteon. Realistically, however, Conversion will only be useful if Snorlax is already dealt with, as most special attackers have a way to paralyze Porygon—negating its primary purpose in handling Snorlax—or can simply overwhelm it with strong attacks. Toxic allows Porygon to deal passive damage to Snorlax while it repeatedly uses Recover, thus forcing Snorlax to use Rest sooner, even if it is carrying Amnesia. However, a number of Pokemon that are likely to switch into Porygon, like Chansey, Alakazam, and Starmie, generally don't mind Toxic, as it allows them to dodge more dangerous status effects like sleep, freeze, and paralysis. Finally, Mimic is a decent option on Porygon. The main purpose of Mimic is to pick up Amnesia from Amnesia Snorlax, which otherwise completely bulldozes Porygon. At a mere 25% chance, though, this is not a reliable option, unfortunately.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status Moves</strong>: Paralysis completely ruins Porygon, so Pokemon with Thunder Wave or Stun Spore can consistently force it to switch. This means many Pokemon are very capable of threatening it, including Chansey, Alakazam, Starmie, Zapdos, Jolteon, Slowbro, and some variants of Exeggutor and Victreebel. Unless Porygon has an opportunity to KO these Pokemon, it must almost always switch out into a teammate that can absorb paralysis. Sleep and freeze also quickly deal with Porygon, and it is quite vulnerable to the former due to its low Speed. However, because Porygon has relatively low value, it is often good for Porygon to take sleep or freeze so nothing else on the team must. While rare, confusion also inhibits Porygon a lot, as Porygon isn’t bulky enough to risk hitting itself and giving up a free turn to the opponent.</p> <p><strong>Stat Alteration</strong>: Because Porygon has mediocre defensive stats, it becomes easy to exploit if the foe begins to boost their stats or lower Porygon’s stats. Amnesia users like Snorlax and Slowbro can boost largely unfettered against Porygon and begin doing a lot of damage. Slowbro in particular only needs to get to +4 before it has a chance to OHKO Porygon. Swords Dance users, while not particularly common, also can set up rather comfortably in front of Porygon and overwhelm it. Special drops from Psychic also threaten Porygon quite a lot. Exeggutor, for example, is guaranteed to 2HKO Porygon with Psychic if the first hit drops its Special. Other users like Alakazam and Starmie also have no issue breaking through Porygon after a Special drop.</p> <p><strong>Critical Hits</strong>: Porygon often has trouble with faster foes even if they can’t paralyze it as critical hits imperil Porygon quickly. Tauros, even if it is paralyzed, can potentially break through Porygon if it gets multiple consecutive critical hits. If Snorlax gets a critical hit, it often places Porygon on the backfoot, as it will lose more health than it can recoup with Recover in a single turn. Moreover, a desperate Hyper Beam will cleanly OHKO Porygon if Snorlax manages to score a critical hit. Heavy hitters like Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Zapdos will also make short work of Porygon if they can get a critical hit or two.</p> <p><strong>Partial Trapping</strong>: Porygon’s poor Speed leaves it vulnerable to partial trappers like Cloyster, Victreebel, and Dragonite. Partial trappers can accumulate significant damage on Porygon and pivot to a hard counter, all before Porygon has a chance to heal.</p>",

        "Wall": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Recover is one of the most important moves in RBY and the primary reason Porygon has a niche. The move is mandatory for Porygon to wall and stall Snorlax. Given Recover's 32 PP, Porygon can easily absorb all 24 Snorlax Body Slam hits and then some. Unless Snorlax is carrying Amnesia, it lacks any solid option to break through Porygon. Outside of a freeze from Ice Beam or multiple consecutive critical hits, Snorlax can only feasibly beat a healthy Porygon with Self-Destruct. Considering this is generally a poor trade for the Snorlax user, they will often be forced to switch it out. This gives the Porygon user the opportunity to double switch or attack to maintain some momentum. Porygon can prevent Snorlax from getting offensive momentum while keeping Pokemon that often answer Snorlax, like Chansey, Starmie, and one's own Snorlax, safe and available to fill other roles. Porygon is a rather frail Pokemon, so it should use Recover very liberally. It should avoid switching out until it is at or near full health, as it would otherwise risk falling to a heavier hit from Snorlax, like Hyper Beam or any critical hit.</p> <p>Thunder Wave is also essentially required. Paralysis is critical for mitigating Snorlax: full paralysis generates free turns for Porygon, enabling it to attack instead of simply using Recover on most every turn. Paralysis also makes other physical attackers much more manageable. While Tauros is very unlikely to stay in against a healthy Porygon, if it must do so in a desperate endgame, Porygon can rather safely win the one-on-one by using Thunder Wave, using Recover, and waiting for full paralyses to attack and eventually KO Tauros. Similarly, Thunder Wave is a good way to pressure Pokemon like Gengar and Exeggutor. Additionally, because Porygon pretty consistently forces Snorlax to switch, Porygon can potentially paralyze the Pokemon that commonly switch in like Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam. However, doing this may prevent Porygon from reaching full health before it switches out, as Porygon will have to switch out in fear of paralysis.</p> <p>While Porygon may have dismal offensive stats, it has a large and diverse offensive movepool. Ice Beam is the most common attack on Porygon primarily due to its ability to freeze foes. While Porygon generally defeats Snorlax via a war of attrition regardless, it is more than happy to cut the war short with a freeze. Ice Beam allows Porygon to participate in freeze wars and keep higher value Pokemon, like Chansey and one’s own Snorlax, safe from bad luck. Ice Beam is also a reasonable coverage move with a potential 2HKO on Rhydon and likely 4HKOs on Exeggutor and Zapdos. Being able to chip or even potentially freeze switch-ins like Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam is also significant. Porygon’s final move extends its coverage. Thunderbolt is the most common choice, as it complements Ice Beam famously well. It notably enables Porygon to bully or finish off Water-type Pokemon like Starmie, Slowbro, Cloyster, and Lapras, especially if they are paralyzed. It also has a fair amount of PP to improve Porygon's ability to stall. Tri Attack is a fairly strong option that can pressure Pokemon with more special bulk, like Chansey, Alakazam, and Jynx. Finally, Hyper Beam is an option that can catch switch-ins and paralyzed foes by surprise. It can reliably pick off Chansey below 45% health and Alakazam below 60%. The choice for Porygon’s second offensive move often comes down to its teammates and player preference.</p> <p>Porygon has a very straightforward gameplan. Generally, it needs to do two things to stay successful. First, Porygon should try to stay as healthy as possible. Porygon should aim to switch out with as much health as possible so it can consistently answer Pokemon like Snorlax. It should generally only attack when it is close to or at full health. Two important benchmarks to keep in mind are 76.5% and 84.6% HP; Porygon must be at or above these points to survive a Hyper Beam and a critical hit Body Slam, respectively, and thus feel comfortable attacking instead of healing. It is imperative that Porygon ends every turn above both of these benchmarks, especially before it is switched out. In general, Porygon should prioritize Recover and Thunder Wave over attacking. Second, Porygon should avoid paralysis. Paralysis is often a death sentence for Porygon, as it will become slower than Snorlax and very easy to exploit on turns when it is fully paralyzed. Unless it can KO them immediately, Porygon should generally switch out when faced with paralysis inducers like Chansey, Starmie, Alakazam, Slowbro, Jolteon, Zapdos, and Stun Spore Exeggutor. The bigger-picture purpose of using Porygon often comes down to getting more out of one’s Snorlax and Chansey, as neither should need to deal with the opponent’s Snorlax when Porygon can do so. Snorlax is more free to forgo Reflect and explore more offensive options thanks to Porygon’s assistance. Additionally, if Porygon loses a freeze war against Snorlax, one’s own Snorlax can engage in a freeze war with no fear. Chansey works similarly, as it can focus on checking special attackers and be more difficult to exploit.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Omanyte's combination of solid bulk and a Rock / Water typing perfectly counters Rapidash and Arcanine, denying them meaningful progress, and also makes it an effective switch-in to Fearow and Scyther. As these Pokemon are incredibly common offensive threats, Omanyte will almost always have several opportunities to stop a powerful progress-maker in its tracks and then make its own progress. However, while few Pokemon enjoy switching into Omanyte's decently powerful Surf and Blizzard or risking Body Slam paralysis, choosing the wrong move for its switch-in—such as Surf for Seaking or Body Slam for Gastly—leaves it in a bad position. Most of these foes can also switch into Omanyte's attacks at least once and still beat it one-on-one. Omanyte also has an especially hard counter in Porygon, as Omanyte cannot 2HKO or paralyze it while Porygon can heal off the damage with Recover. Omanyte's terrible Speed makes it loses the one-on-one to a variety of metagame threats, such as Nidoqueen and Drowzee, which can force a powerful attack or status condition on one of Omanyte's teammate as it's forced out. Omanyte's low HP also leaves it extremely vulnerable to fixed-damage moves, which 3HKO it. Additionally, its switch-ins are very predictable, making it exploitable with double switching. Pokemon checked by Omanyte have ways to mitigate its effectiveness, as Fearow's sheer power and critical hit rate can quickly wear it down, while Rapidash can use Fire Spin to switch out if its team lacks a decent Omanyte switch-in. Effective use of Omanyte requires a team that can handle its shortcomings and careful management of its HP, and despite walling some top threats, players should consider other options before using Omanyte.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hydro Pump is much stronger than Surf, notably having around a 47% chance to 2HKO Gastly, a 59% chance to 2HKO Abra, an 83% chance to 2HKO opposing Omanyte, and an 85% chance to OHKO the rare Sandslash, feats Surf can never achieve without a critical hit. Hydro Pump's extra damage against Drowzee leaves it always in range of Machamp's Hyper Beam or two Seismic Tosses, and it gives Rapidash's Hyper Beam and Pinsir's Slash favorable odds to KO Drowzee as well. However, Hydro Pump's poor accuracy makes it quite unreliable, with Surf usually being preferred over its inconsistent counterpart.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Porygon outspeeds Omanyte, isn't 2HKOed by Surf or Blizzard, is immune to Body Slam paralysis, and can heal off damage with Recover, making it Omanyte's worst matchup.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: While they all dislike paralysis, none of Omanyte's attacks do significant damage to any of the tier's Water-types, whereas they can easily overwhelm it with their STAB moves in return. Staryu can wall Omanyte indefinitely as a result of its access to Recover, while Seaking can set up Agility to negate the Speed drop from paralysis. The rarer Slowpoke and Poliwag can use Omanyte as setup fodder for Amnesia freely.</p> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly is uniquely immune to Body Slam while only being 3HKOed by Surf, affording it numerous opportunities to switch in and threaten Omanyte with its higher Speed, Hypnosis, and a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Drowzee</strong>: Drowzee can outspeed and put Omanyte to sleep with Hypnosis and can usually win the one-on-one with Psychic if sleep isn't available.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users</strong>: Machamp outspeeds and 2HKOes Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 3HKOed by Surf in return. While they cannot switch in, Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and the rare Sandslash outspeed and 2HKO Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 2HKOed in return, allowing them to easily win the one-on-one or pick off a weakened Omanyte.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While rare and vulnerable to Blizzard, Weepinbell and Vileplume serve as effective Omanyte checks. Both outspeed it; the former OHKOes Omanyte with Razor Leaf, while the sheer bulk of the latter allows it to reliably 2HKO Omanyte with Mega Drain. Both threats can also put Omanyte to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Surf is a decently strong attack that 3HKOes most neutral targets and 2HKOes some notable foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Nidoqueen.

Body Slam lets Omanyte fish for paralysis on all of its switch-ins barring Gastly and Porygon, allowing Omanyte to still make some progress against Water-types such as Staryu and Seaking. Rest is Omanyte's only form of recovery, but it's unreliable due to the number of turns it leaves Omanyte helpless and thus is best used to secure late-game victories against Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow.</p> <p>Omanyte partners well with many offensive Pokemon that are outsped by Rapidash, Arcanine, Scyther, and Fearow, such as Pinsir and Machamp. Ironically enough, Rapidash, Arcanine, Scyther, and Fearow also appreciate Omanyte's support, as it secures their mirror matchups and protects Fearow and Arcanine from being revenge killed. In return, these wallbreakers and sweepers can power through defensive Pokemon such as Staryu, Porygon, and Drowzee, which Omanyte can't break past on its own. These threats can also check foes that give Omanyte trouble, such as Machamp handling Nidoqueen and Rapidash handling Pinsir. On the defensive end, Staryu is a great partner for its ability to eternally wall Seaking, which otherwise can use Omanyte as setup fodder. Drowzee, while not as iron-clad, is capable of checking special attackers, such as Gastly, Abra, and Staryu, which give Omanyte trouble. Paralysis support from these Pokemon also goes a long way in helping Omanyte's team break through Porygon for it.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Omastar is generally considered less viable in the current metagame. The most up-do-date Omastar set is the following:</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aside from its Rock typing, Seismic Toss is pretty much Omastar's only unique advantage over Vaporeon. It can be fairly useful for its consistent damage against any target. However, most Pokemon are simply hit harder by Omastar’s other moves or more threatened by the chance of paralysis from Body Slam, so the move isn’t overly common or useful. It is strongly advised to stick to the suggested set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Omastar’s archrival Vaporeon is also one of its most consistent checks. Vaporeon takes very little from all of Omastar’s moves and is relatively unfazed by paralysis. Vaporeon also uses Omastar’s Rock typing against it by scoring a 4HKO with Surf or a 3HKO with Hydro Pump. Poliwrath is in a similar boat, as it shrugs off Omastar’s attacks quite easily and can retaliate with a super effective move like Earthquake or Submission. Finally, while it fears paralysis, Tentacruel easily emerges victorious against Omastar thanks to its access to the strongest unboosted Surf in the tier.</p> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Electabuzz and Raichu are two of the scariest Pokemon for Omastar to face. While Hydro Pump does quite a lot to both, both dispatch Omastar with relatively uncontested 2HKOs. While it lacks STAB on the move, Gyarados is also more than capable of winning the matchup, even if it switches in. Other users such as Haunter and Persian can't reliably switch in, but they can use their superior Speed to threaten Omastar in a pinch, especially if Omastar has taken a few hits or is asleep.</p> <p><strong>Earthquake Users</strong>: While Omastar is well-equipped to handle Normal- and Flying-type moves, its Rock typing leaves it exposed to Earthquake. Omastar is capable of beating every Earthquake user aside from Poliwrath one-on-one, but the move limits Omastar’s ability to switch in. Earthquake users can also revenge kill Omastar without much damage or paralysis support due to its low Speed. A sleeping Omastar can be exploited rather easily for this same reason. The wrong situation can make Pokemon that Omastar usually matches up well against, like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, and Golem, suddenly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon</strong>: While rare, Grass-type Pokemon truly threaten Omastar. Venusaur is especially scary, for it outspeeds and claims a clean OHKO with Razor Leaf. Tangela that choose to use Mega Drain can easily 2HKO Omastar while recovering enough health to not be too fearful of Omastar’s Blizzard. Additionally, its Mega Drain begins to enter OHKO territory after just two uses of Growth.</p>",

          "description": "<hr /> <h4>Outdated Analysis</h4> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>Omastar first appeared on the RBY UU stage because it was thought to be a strong counter to the then recently-released legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres, as well as the Wrap-happy Dragonite to a lesser extent. However, as the metagame progressed, other significant Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Vaporeon proved more than capable of keeping the birds at bay. As Articuno became less potent and Moltres fell into obscurity, Omastar began to find itself somewhat unemployed. As such, Omastar dwells near the bottom of the RBY UU metagame. It competes quite closely with Vaporeon, which is widely regarded as the tier’s premier bulky Water-type. Despite stiff competition, Omastar has a few attributes that set it apart from Vaporeon and other defensively-oriented Pokemon.</p> <p>Omastar’s most notable trait is its Rock typing, which makes it a much more specialized defensive unit compared to Vaporeon and the like. It matches up well against Pokemon that rely primarily or exclusively on Normal-, Flying-, or Fire-type moves such as Persian, Dodrio, and Moltres. Omastar is also rivaled only by Haunter and Golem at handling Wrap damage and Explosion. On the negative side, Omastar shares many of the same weaknesses held by other defensive Water-types, such as against Electric-type moves, while acquiring some additional ones. These include a new weakness to Ground-type moves, a worsened weakness to Grass-type moves, and the inability to resist the many Water-type attacks in the tier. Finally, Omastar is remarkably slow, being outpaced by every major Pokemon in the tier aside from Golem. This renders it highly susceptible to being revenge killed.</p>"
        },
        "Defensive": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the main set you can expect to see Omastar run. It strongly resembles the set most often employed by Vaporeon and seeks to accomplish many of the same goals. Surf or Hydro Pump is its all-purpose STAB move. Both moves hit neutral and weak targets quite effectively thanks to Omastar’s rather high Special stat. Hydro Pump's extra damage is notable for a few targets, such as scoring a 3HKO against Hypno and a guaranteed 2HKO against Kangaskhan and Persian. Surf misses some benchmarks but has higher accuracy and PP. Blizzard grants Omastar coverage resisted only by Water-types. It is also notable for being extremely likely to OHKO Dragonite. It also outperforms Surf and Hydro Pump against a few targets such as Dodrio, Gyarados, and the handful of Grass-types that lurk in the tier. Body Slam is mainly for hitting opposing Water-types. Its most notable target is Tentacruel; should Body Slam paralyze it, it will likely be forced to use Rest and thus become much easier to exploit. Rest is, of course, to keep Omastar healthy, especially against less offensive teams. Successfully using Rest and waking up is quite difficult in the RBY UU environment, but Omastar can occasionally use Rest in front of the Pokemon it can wall and attempt to wake up amidst the many turns of Wrap likely to occur as the match continues.</p> <p>Omastar is quite good at slowing down your opponent’s offensive momentum. Its Rock typing can be very helpful for pivoting into the many Normal-type moves thrown around in the tier. Omastar can come in rather freely against Persian and Kangaskhan, provided they are using a Normal-type move, and threaten a 2HKO in return. Omastar becomes especially potent if switched in against a Hyper Beam, as it essentially has a free turn to use a powerful special attack. It should be noted that a revealed Omastar is a fairly good deterrent to reckless use of Hyper Beam and Explosion. Additionally, Omastar completely walls Dodrio and Articuno, only fearing the latter freezing it. While it is hardly worth mentioning in the modern metagame because they are so uncommon, Omastar is exceptional at walling Fire-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Omastar also has interesting interactions with Wrap. It resists the attack, so it is quite good at either PP stalling the attacker or simply taking the hits and hoping to punish a miss. When paired with other Pokemon that take little or no damage from Wrap, like Haunter and Golem, Omastar can feasibly force Tentacruel or Dragonite to exhaust all of their Wrap PP by simply switching in and out with the other Pokemon. Such a strategy can still be exploited by many potential Omastar switch-ins, such as Dugtrio, Electabuzz, and Raichu. This can be overcome with proper prediction; you can pivot into a Pokemon that matches up well against common switch-ins to Omastar. And in end-games where many of these attackers are KOed, Omastar can help secure victories against Pokemon that are dependent on Wrap for damage, such as some variants of Dragonite.</p> <p>As the tier’s premier Articuno check, Omastar is quite useful on teams that struggle with the legendary bird. Teammates such as Dugtrio, Tangela, and Venusaur most appreciate Omastar's combination of attributes. These three Pokemon also happen to handle Electric-type Pokemon quite well, which threaten Omastar. Flying-type Pokemon like Gyarados, Dragonite, and Dodrio similarly appreciate Omastar’s resistance to Ice while also switching into the Earthquakes that Omastar frequently baits in; these Earthquakes can also help Dodrio safely set up with Agility.

It is walled by the omnipresent Chansey and the common Starmie. Slowbro also has little trouble walling it and can use it as an opportunity to set up with Amnesia. Omastar's typing is a double-edged sword that gives it weaknesses to Earthquake and Thunderbolt, which are both common in the metagame. Even if it avoids both, Omastar has to rely on Rest for recovery, which renders it useless for two turns, giving offensive threats such as Tauros and Zapdos opportunities to switch into it and wreak havoc.</p>",

Hydro Pump also 3HKOes most other Pokemon that are not named Chansey and do not resist Water. This includes Snorlax, so, even if it is carrying Earthquake, Omastar can still force it out if it switches in on a predicted Snorlax Rest. If Hydro Pump's low PP and 79.7% accuracy are a concern, Surf can be used instead at the cost of a noticeable reduction in power. Ice Beam 3HKOes Exeggutor and Zapdos, and it can also be used to fish for a freeze. Body Slam is used specifically to fish for paralysis on switch-ins like Starmie, though it cannot paralyze Chansey, which also likes to switch into Omastar. Seismic Toss is an alternative option to do consistent damage to Starmie, Slowbro, and Cloyster. Rest restores Omastar to full HP and removes any status it had beforehand. With it, Omastar can loop the rare Amnesia Snorlax that runs Ice Beam as its only move. Unfortunately, Snorlax more commonly runs Blizzard when using Amnesia and 3HKOes Omastar with it at +6.</p> <p>Omastar has some other options. Blizzard is usable because it 2HKOes Victreebel and requires less prior chip damage than Ice Beam to 2HKO Exeggutor and Zapdos. However, Victreebel is rare, and Blizzard has less PP and accuracy than Ice Beam. Submission 3HKOes Chansey, but it has little other use, causes recoil damage, and only has 79.7% accuracy. Substitute protects Omastar from Ice Beam freezes and paralysis from Body Slam and allows it to burn a Rest turn for free. Reflect and Withdraw boost Omastar's Defense so it can check Snorlax carrying Earthquake, but they do nothing to stop Chansey, Starmie, and Slowbro from walling it. Mimic is unreliable but can get Omastar solid moves from its switch-ins like Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, and Sing.</p>"

    "ou": {
      "overview": "<p>Kabutops is a very dangerous Pokemon and among the best Swords Dance users in OU. First of all, its base 115 Attack stat is very respectable, and it sports the best high critical hit rate move in the game—Slash. While this may seem counterproductive for Swords Dance, since in RBY critical hits ignore stat boosts, it means Kabutops can pose an immediate threat without having to raise its Attack. Slash also gives it wallbreaking potential, mostly because critical hits also ignore Reflect. Because Kabutops can switch in on recovery moves such as Rest and Recover and immediately pose a threat, it commonly forces the opponent to switch in a check that lacks recovery, like Exeggutor or Tauros, to force it out. This means Kabutops will do permanent damage. Its typing grants it a valuable resistance to Normal and Ice. This means it can freely set up against Pokemon such as Cloyster, sometimes against Chansey without Thunderbolt (depending on circumstance, the threat of Thunder Wave may pose a problem) and on any variant of Snorlax not packing Earthquake—or the very rare Thunderbolt.</p> <p>However, while Kabutops's typing is certainly one of its key assets, it also leaves it with very unfortunate weaknesses to Electric and Ground. This means it can't switch in as much as it would want against Rhydon despite its Surf and good Defense. Also, Kabutops is easy to force out with Thunderbolt users such as Jolteon, Zapdos, Gengar, Starmie, and Lapras—the first four outspeed it, and Lapras easily survives a +2 Hyper Beam. Kabutops can struggle to discourage them from switching in, giving them great momentum. Surf is weak enough against them to almost give a free switch. A Hyper Beam use can be punished by Gengar, while Swords Dance usually gives free entry to Thunderbolt users. Every move besides Slash is fairly easy to punish—and Gengar even ignores that, countering Kabutops outright. Slash is still a great move and helps deter these threats, but again its critical hits ignore Swords Dance boosts. Therefore, if these threats can pressure Kabutops into using Slash often, they reduce its threat ceiling in practice. Also, Hyper Beam's 10.4% miss chance or Kabutops's 15.6% critical hit rate can just ruin its sweep, a likely scenario if Kabutops is expected to KO several Pokemon consecutively.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Body Slam can be used to paralyze switch-ins, potentially paralyzing a Pokemon such as Starmie or Exeggutor and thus facilitating a sweeper like Rhydon, but it is difficult to drop one of the listed moves. Dropping Surf means losing to Rhydon and not being able to damage Gengar at all. Dropping Slash makes Kabutops's job of wallbreaking much harder, with it unable to reliably get past Reflect Snorlax and Chansey or hit switch-ins hard, and dropping Swords Dance or Hyper Beam severely hinders its sweeping capabilities. Blizzard may also seem a good choice, but missing out on the OHKO on Rhydon is very detrimental, and Slash hits Exeggutor and Zapdos harder.</p> <p>For a completely different approach, a more defensive set using Rest, Slash, Surf, and either Reflect or Body Slam could be used. It makes use of Kabutops's key resistances to Normal and Ice, with Slash allowing it to not forfeit momentum. However, Reflect is generally only useful against Earthquake from Tauros and Snorlax, the former having a very high critical hit rate anyway and the latter often forgoing Earthquake for overall more useful moves, giving Reflect fringe utility at best. However, Body Slam is fringe too: it moves Kabutops away from purer defense towards a sort of offensive support role, a less unique role that other Pokemon such as Snorlax and Rhydon fulfill better. They don't need to sacrifice as much of their offensive presence—remember that this Kabutops set drops Swords Dance and Hyper Beam—to be physical walls or lure in and paralyze certain threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is undoubtedly the best Kabutops counter, since it can easily come in on any of Kabutops's moves and threaten it directly with Thunderbolt. It easily takes Kabutops down, even while paralyzed, since Surf is a 5HKO. If Sleep Clause is not in effect and no statused Pokemon can safely switch in, Gengar can also safely go for Hypnosis to punish the switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Kabutops and has a 61.5% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt. If Zapdos is paralyzed, it's a check at best though, because Slash and +2 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO. Jolteon only has a 2.4% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt, but its critical hit rate is very high and should be kept in mind. However, if Jolteon is paralyzed or asleep from Rest, it can no longer switch in either, because both Slash + Hyper Beam and +2 Hyper Beam are almost always a KO.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is never OHKOed by Slash + Hyper Beam or +2 Hyper Beam, which means it can easily come in and threaten Kabutops with Thunder Wave, Thunderbolt, or to a lesser extent even Surf and Psychic. However, if it's paralyzed, it has to watch out.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor needs Mega Drain to counter Kabutops, since it is almost always KOed by Slash and +2 Hyper Beam. Otherwise, sets without it can come in once and threaten with a status move—or even heavy damage with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Razor Leaf OHKOes Kabutops, and Kabutops cannot realistically expect to KO Victreebel even if it switches in, since a +2 Hyper Beam only has a 1 in 39 chance to OHKO. Much like Gengar, it can somewhat safely go for Sleep Powder if circumstances allow for it.</p> <p><strong>Lapras</strong>: Lapras checks Kabutops in a similar way to Exeggutor, with the notable difference that it can generally switch in twice instead of once, and Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 2HKO. It can also use Sing similarly to Gengar.</p>",

        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set makes Kabutops a very menacing threat in OU, although the reasons why may not be immediately apparent. While Slash does not benefit from Swords Dance boosts, it comes off of a very high 115 base Attack stat, which allows it to immediately threaten a paralyzed Alakazam or Chansey (and Starmie to a lesser extent), as well as Rest Snorlax. If the former two have full paralysis on a recovering turn or Kabutops comes in on Rest from the latter, the opponent will be forced to switch them out, most likely to a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Tauros that takes permanent damage. Slash is not a 3HKO on Snorlax, but Snorlax cannot just stall Kabutops with Rest because it is too easy to predict the Rest and use Swords Dance. Once Kabutops is at +2, two Slashes and a Hyper Beam KO Snorlax after Rest before it can attack, forcing Snorlax to switch or risk fainting. Even if Snorlax uses Reflect, it offers little protection because Kabutops has plenty of opportunities to boost to +4. Alternatively, Kabutops can fish for a critical hit with Surf while Snorlax is asleep—a viable strategy considering Kabutops's respectable critical hit rate.</p> <p>The benefits of Slash don't end here, though. Slash with +2 Hyper Beam is enough to KO Zapdos and Tauros 100% of the time, as well as Exeggutor 95.4% of the time. If Chansey is at 88.6% health, Slash + Hyper Beam becomes a guaranteed KO. At 84.4%, Slash becomes a guaranteed 2HKO too, so a little bit of chip damage comes a long way in breaking through Chansey.</p> <p>Kabutops also packs a big, big punch as a late-game sweeper. +4 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO on Exeggutor and anything more frail than it. With a bit of chip damage, +2 Hyper Beam KOes Starmie and Chansey. Kabutops is not very hard to find setup opportunities with, either: any sleeping Pokemon such as Rest Cloyster, Snorlax, or Jolteon (provided it comes in on the latter's Rest turn) will do. Sleep fodder your opponent is trying to sack, a Rhydon switching out fearing Surf, and an untimely full paralysis are other possible setup windows.</p> <p>Kabutops also distinguishes itself from other setup sweepers because paralysis does not end its usability in the game. While its late-game sweeping abilities are hindered, its respectable Speed means it's still very capable of beating several Pokemon such as Chansey, Snorlax, Cloyster, and paralyzed Alakazam, using Swords Dance to reapply the latter's paralysis Speed drop and outspeed it. Paralyzed Kabutops also still does significant damage with Slash to potential switch-ins.</p> <p>Kabutops's typing plays a key role in the Tauros matchup, and typing is perhaps the main asset it has over Sandslash and Kingler. Kabutops's Rock typing means that Tauros will generally resort to Earthquake to beat it, or the much rarer Thunderbolt. Not only does Earthquake have a mere 2.2% chance to 2HKO, it will also never OHKO a full health Kabutops with a critical hit. Sandslash is always 2HKOed by Tauros's Blizzard and OHKOed if it's a critical hit, while Kingler taking on Tauros is likely to find itself paralyzed by a neutral Body Slam, severely hindering its ability to continue the sweep. Earthquake also comes without a freeze or paralysis chance, which gives Kabutops much better odds at late-game sweeping. Unboosted Kabutops can even beat Tauros one-on-one in some situations, usually winning if Tauros is damaged by Slash beforehand or switches in on it. Kabutops also has the most reliable way of disposing of Rhydon and Golem with Surf, since Kingler's Crabhammer has unreliable accuracy, and Sandslash must be at +4 to always OHKO with Earthquake, but this comes the expense of being worse against Gengar.</p> <p>Lastly, Kabutops also has good synergy with Electric-types such as Zapdos. They can seriously threaten each other's counters, and most players will switch Rhydon in without second thought upon sight of Zapdos, allowing for a double switch to Kabutops and subsequent threat of a setup sweep.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Kabutops serves as a powerful physical attacker and defensive check to Fire-types in RBY NU. Its Slash deals heavy damage to most foes, 3HKOing all but the bulkiest Pokemon and notably 2HKOing Mr. Mime. The few that resist it, like Golem, cannot handle STAB Surf, making it very difficult to check Kabutops once it finds entry. Kabutops completely shrugs off burn with Slash, making it by far the most reliable answer to Moltres and Ninetales as well as a tenuous Charizard check. It can also sweep; Swords Dance allows Kabutops to tear through most foes, and it can even set up in front of certain threats, like Blastoise and Moltres. Compared to the other Water-type Swords Dance user, Kingler, Kabutops has less raw power but more switch-in opportunities; its partial Rock typing allows it to catch an opposing Hyper Beam or Explosion and gives it a 4x resistance to Fire, allowing it to effortlessly blockade Moltres and Ninetales. It's also slightly faster, outspeeding Blastoise. In exchange, it loses some defensive utility against Water-types and has difficulty checking Golem, as it cannot switch in safely.</p> <p>However, Kabutops is a weaker Charizard check than any other Water-type due to its Earthquake weakness; Charizard comes just short of 2HKOing it, so even slight chip allows Charizard to win. Kabutops is just barely too slow to beat threats like Nidoking and Seadra, which win one-on-one thanks to Kabutops's Rock typing. This is also a problem against the slower Kingler, which can 2HKO it with Crabhammer. As with other Water-types, Kabutops piles onto a team's Electrode weakness and takes up the team slot usually reserved for a Ground-type. As the metagame has shifted away from Fire Spin, and threats like Moltres and Ninetales have fallen off, Kabutops has struggled to maintain the dominance it once had, but it is still a fearsome mid-game attacker that is difficult to answer when given the first strike.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Body Slam deals less immediate damage than Slash, but it hits harder after a boost or can be used to fish for paralysis against switch-ins. This is usually less useful than the immediate damage from Slash on most teams, but Water-type spam teams can benefit from it spreading paralysis for allies like Kingler and Seadra. This also lets Kabutops fish for a lucky paralysis in unwinnable endgames against a Mr. Mime or Charizard. Hydro Pump has a solid chance to 2HKO Moltres, but this is unnecessary, since Moltres struggles against Kabutops regardless. Kabutops often does not get a chance to set up with Swords Dance, however, so it can be dropped to have Hydro Pump for rare cases where the extra damage secures a KO on foes like Charizard and Nidoking. Rest can be used to eternally wall Fire-types aside from Charizard, but this is incredibly exploitable by opposing Swords Dance users as well as attackers like Nidoking and Mr. Mime. Blizzard 2HKOes Exeggcute and Fearow, but this is usually a non-issue; Exeggcute is 3HKOed by Slash, making it risky for it to switch in, and Fearow is walled by Kabutops anyway. As with Hydro Pump, this is best substituted over Swords Dance if used. Toxic can be used to prevent Fire Spin shenanigans, since Kabutops can take Fire Spin repeatedly until the foe misses, but this is usually overkill compared to simply hitting them with Surf.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Fast Attackers</strong>: Mr. Mime and Electrode outspeed and 2HKO Kabutops, and their high critical hit rates are an additional headache. Nidoking and Seadra also outspeed it; these matchups are mutual 2HKOs and 3HKOs, respectively. Raticate loses one-on-one most times but can fish for a critical hit with Thunderbolt; the odds are relatively high, and even if it fails, it will inflict heavy damage. However, all of these checks have difficulty switching in, as Slash 2HKOes or 3HKOes them all.</p> <p><strong>Venomoth</strong>: Venomoth can easily put a stop to any shenanigans with Sleep Powder, and it can switch in relatively safely if Kabutops comes in early-game. Slash does have a small chance to 2HKO Venomoth, so Kabutops can occasionally get away with a Slash + Hyper Beam combination should Venomoth miss with Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Clefable</strong>: Clefable, while slower, is bulky enough to paralyze Kabutops and finish it off with Thunderbolt. This is a relatively wasteful use of it, however, so it's a last resort.</p> <p><strong>Kingler</strong>: Kingler's Crabhammer 2HKOes Kabutops, and it only 3HKOes in return with Slash. However, Kingler cannot switch in and win, and it may give Kabutops a free setup opportunity. Crabhammer can also miss, immediately losing the matchup.</p> <p><strong>Charizard</strong>: Charizard's Earthquake comes just short of 2HKOing Kabutops, which means Charizard actually has several paths to win and can even potentially set up in front of Kabutops. A critical hit guarantees the 2HKO on Kabutops, as does slight chip damage; any stray hit from Charizard's allies will do it, as will two Fire Blasts. Charizard also wins if it uses Swords Dance or Earthquake as Kabutops switches in; should Kabutops switch into a Swords Dance, Charizard can use it again, take a hit, and then OHKO Kabutops, potentially sweeping afterward, as very little can survive a +4 Hyper Beam.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Slash 2HKOes frail foes like Mr. Mime and Raticate and 3HKOing everything else of note. Swords Dance and Hyper Beam give it a stronger option to sweep late-game; at +2, Kabutops OHKOes the aforementioned Pokemon and has decent odds to OHKO Venomoth and Electrode, so it can become quite the threat if given a free turn. +2 Hyper Beam also deals massive damage to Clefable, Blastoise, and Kingler, allowing Kabutops to soften these threats for teammates before going down or outright KO them if chipped. Surf mostly serves to cover Golem, Nidoking, and opposing Kabutops, but it also matters against Charizard, as Slash is only a 3HKO.</p> <p>Kabutops functions best as a mid-game wallbreaker or late-game sweeper. As a wallbreaker, Kabutops looks to find entry against slower foes and either tear through them with Slash or set up with Swords Dance and deal as much damage as possible before going down. It excels in this role against paralyzed Mr. Mime and Raticate, especially if they're chipped heavily, and it can also trade hits with Blastoise. Moltres and Ninetales are ideal entry points, of course, and Kabutops may also be able to riskily enter against Charizard; it also can switch into a predicted Hyper Beam from Charizard, Clefable, or Raticate and punish them heavily. Once in, Kabutops exploits the fact that switching into its Slash is nearly impossible; only opposing Kabutops and the incredibly rare Gastly can switch in well, as physically bulky Pokemon like Clefable and Kingler cannot win one-on-one if they take a hit on entry. Exeggcute can switch in once and attempt to paralyze it or put it to sleep, but it's 3HKOed even if it switches into Surf, so a single miss leaves it in severe peril.</p> <p>As a late-game sweeper, Kabutops looks for endgames in which it can set up Swords Dance and cleave through the enemy team with Hyper Beam. This usually requires faster foes like Charizard, Mr. Mime, and Nidoking to be chipped or paralyzed; once this happens, Kabutops merely needs a chance to set up without getting paralyzed. This is often difficult to achieve, as Kabutops's best setup targets tend to trade hits and get KOed early- or mid-game. Thus, it may choose to skip setting up even late-game and just attack with Slash or Surf to try to close out a game. Kabutops should be played more defensively if the opponent reveals a Moltres, Ninetales, or Fire Spin Charizard, as it freely enters against both Fire Blast and Fire Spin. However, it can be worn down over time, especially if the foe connects with Fire Spin to freely escape.</p> <p>Kabutops typically fits as the sixth Pokemon on a \"Big 5\" team—that is, Clefable, Mr. Mime, Blastoise, Charizard, and Venomoth—but it can also be used as part of a \"Water-type spam\" core, with Seadra or Kingler substituting for Charizard, or on structures using a Ground-type over Charizard to provide support against Electrode. As part of a \"Big 5\" team, it benefits from paralysis spread by Venomoth, Mr. Mime, and Clefable, all of which can also soften up foes for Kabutops to later sweep through. Seadra appreciates Kabutops's ability to remove Blastoise for it, opening the way for an Agility sweep. Ground-types easily switch into Thunderbolts and Thunder Waves aimed at Kabutops. Pinsir is a rare but interesting option, as Pinsir's Earthquake resistance covers for Kabutops, which easily switches into Fire Blast for Pinsir. However, this structure is extremely vulnerable to Charizard, especially if it simply uses Swords Dance in front of Pinsir.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl is able to find a niche on anti-Wrap cores thanks to its exceptionally high Speed, which allows it to check and revenge kill even some of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, like Dugtrio and Persian. This Speed gives it an incredible 25.39% critical hit rate while also making it difficult to pin down with Wrap. Aerodactyl also has an amazing defensive typing that provides it with immunity to Earthquake and resistance to Normal-type attacks, granting it great synergy with physically frail Pokemon like Electabuzz and Raichu. Finally, Aerodactyl's Normal resistance allows it to PP stall Wrap, dissuade Explosion, and force recharges from Hyper Beam.</p> <p>However, Aerodactyl comes with a slew of problems. It's hindered severely by a lack of STAB options, with its sole semi-functional one being the mediocre Sky Attack. This extends to the rest of its offensive movepool, often leading Aerodactyl to use Fire Blast. Overall, these movepool issues limit Aerodactyl's damage output by quite a bit. Furthermore, its reliance on Double-Edge forces it to take heavy recoil and leaves it susceptible to knocking itself into KO range, severely limiting its defensive use throughout a game. Defensively, Aerodactyl is very frail specially, taking massive damage from Surf and Blizzard, both very common attacks in the tier. As a result, it will struggle against threats like its extinct brethren Omastar and often get forced out. Aerodactyl is extremely reliant on its Speed as well, making paralysis a near-death sentence, once again forcing it out if it can't KO the user before it gets paralyzed. This is further amplified by the risk of Body Slam paralyzing it, which makes what would otherwise be a switch-in opportunity a dangerous game to play.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Aerodactyl's fourth move slot is the most expendable, and while its movepool is very limited, this isn't to say there aren't options. Rest is the most relevant option, allowing Aerodactyl to serve a more defensive role while removing paralysis, ensuring it can maintain a defensive presence throughout a game. Considering Wrap deducts sleep turns, Rest plays well into Aerodactyl's playstyle. However, Rest also makes it easy setup fodder for Dragonite. Alternatively, Sky Attack can be used to hit Haunter and OHKO Kadabra, which isn't unfeasible if it's charged during a Recover turn in Kadabra's case, but its two-turn nature and shaky accuracy make it unreliable and specific.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Aerodactyl can't scratch Rock-types at all—especially Omastar and Golem—and is weak to almost every attack they commonly use. As a result, Aerodactyl invites these threats in just by existing and will be subsequently forced out.</p> <p><strong>Haunter</strong>: Haunter is immune to Aerodactyl's main attacking options and takes minimal damage from Fire Blast. As if this weren't enough, it 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt. The best Aerodactyl can offer against it is a potential burn, which makes its Explosion pitifully weak. However, Haunter must be wary of Sky Attack.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Aerodactyl takes heavy damage from any viable Water-type's STAB Surf. While it can survive Surf from Vaporeon at full HP, Double-Edge's recoil means it will almost never be in a situation where it can make use of it. This also makes Tentacruel's 28.2% chance to OHKO Aerodactyl with Surf much more imposing. Gyarados can 2HKO Aerodactyl with Surf or Thunderbolt or even OHKO it with Hydro Pump 89.7% of the time. However, Aerodactyl is very capable of revenge killing Water-types not named Omastar through Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Aerodactyl's main strength in RBY UU is its Speed, so paralysis is the bane of its existence. It will force Aerodactyl to use Agility to remain in control, assuming it is running it, which can be very difficult to set up reliably and leaves it open to exploitation from Pokemon like Dragonite. Unless Aerodactyl can take out opposing paralysis inducers like Electabuzz and Hypno, it's forced to switch out. It should be noted that they're KOed by Hyper Beam from 47.1% and 37.5% onwards, respectively. Raichu can notably use Agility to outspeed Aerodactyl and 2HKO it with Thunderbolt. Electrode can do the same, and its naturally higher Speed makes matters worse. Body Slam's paralysis chance can also make checking Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dodrio much riskier than it should be, making what would normally be a valid point of entry a potential death sentence.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Articuno takes middling damage from Aerodactyl's options outside of Fire Blast, can boost itself to become faster than it through Agility, and OHKOes it with Blizzard. If Articuno has used Agility, Aerodactyl can't do anything.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: While a Toxic or even burn from Aerodactyl will completely stuff its chances of a Wrap sweep, Dragonite is more than capable of beating Aerodactyl. It can use Agility to outspeed and 2HKO Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Thunderbolt, and it doesn't take much damage from its attacks. It also has access to Thunder Wave, which incapacitates Aerodactyl and makes it much more vulnerable to Wrap.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Double-Edge acts as Aerodactyl's main attacking move, allowing it to deal significant damage to physically weak Pokemon. Double-Edge notably 2HKOes Kadabra and puts Dugtrio into range for Hyper Beam. Hyper Beam allows Aerodactyl to revenge kill opposing Pokemon very effectively, KOing Tentacruel from 40.2% onwards. Fire Blast is most useful for the significant burn chance, which can incapacitate physical attackers and cause Wrap users to take more damage than they can deal when using it. Toxic can be used to prevent a Wrap sweep from Agility + Wrap Dragonite, but Agility is helpful for ignoring the Speed drop from paralysis. Fire Blast works well with Toxic, as burning Haunter and Tentacruel—which are immune to it—allows your own Tentacruel to further chip them using Wrap.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's main purpose during a game is to revenge kill Pokemon and prevent Wrap cores from making progress, all while providing defensive support through its typing. This is best facilitated by the use of partners that, like Aerodactyl, take minimal damage from Wrap, such as Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon. Alternatively, Aerodactyl can be fit onto teams with offensive Pokemon that can give it openings to sweep like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dragonite. Overall, this culminates into a hit-and-run playstyle that makes it work well, be it early- or late-game.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's resistance to Normal-type attacks and high Speed mean it can switch in on Wrap with near-impunity, taking minimal damage while guaranteeing damage on the opposing Wrap user should Aerodactyl stay in. Aerodactyl also happens to switch in well against Pokemon that use their teammate's Wrap to switch in freely, such as Dugtrio and Persian. This makes it a good response to these switch-ins with good prediction, especially if it comes in the same turn as them. Overall, Aerodactyl serves as very effective means to check these fast threats, dictating the game state efficiently by denying the opposing team momentum.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's Ground immunity makes it well equipped for double switching, allowing it to ease in Electric-types like Electabuzz, as well as Haunter and Tentacruel, through deterring the use of Earthquake. This makes Aerodactyl suitable for teams that lead with Electabuzz, as Dugtrio is fairly likely to switch in immediately, and Aerodactyl can KO Dugtrio with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam. Since Aerodactyl is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, it appreciates having a Ground-type teammate like Dugtrio or Golem to switch in on Thunder Wave and maintain momentum.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl finds a niche on defensive teams in Ubers for its ability to completely stonewall standard Mew and Snorlax sets as well as some variants of Tauros thanks to its unique Rock / Flying typing. Once it sets up Reflect, it takes negligible damage from even a +6 Mew Body Slam. Aerodactyl is also gifted with an exceptional base 130 Speed, which gives it a sky high 25.39% critical hit rate and ties it with Jolteon and Mewtwo as the second fastest Pokemon in the game.</p> <p>However, Aerodactyl's flaws massively outweigh its benefits. Its damage output is mediocre at best, struggling to threaten strong special attackers such as Mewtwo and Slowbro even on a critical hit, while it gets 2HKOed or 3HKOed in return by most special attacks; this lets Mewtwo and Slowbro switch in with little issue. Aerodactyl also cannot meaningfully threaten physical attackers outside of trying to burn them with Fire Blast, which is extremely risky, as it risks accidentally burning a special attacker switching in. Aerodactyl's movepool is extremely shallow, forcing it to run Double-Edge as its main attacking option, and recoil combined with stray hits from Mew and Snorlax wears it down quickly. This chip damage will eventually force it to use Rest, and while it may be able to do so safely against standard Mew and Snorlax, it's forced out by strong special attackers, such as Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Starmie. Once forced out while asleep, Aerodactyl has difficulty getting back in safely due to its frailty and passivity.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast can be dropped within reason, as it has a mere 8 PP and will rarely ever burn its intended target, instead usually burning a special attacker that can shrug off the chip damage and block other status later on. Fire Blast is also completely useless in front of a paralyzed Mew, as Aerodactyl cannot burn it anymore. Sky Attack can be used, as it is Aerodactyl's only way of doing meaningful damage to bulky foes, as a critical hit Sky Attack does 79.2% minimum to Mewtwo and 72.7% minimum to Slowbro. However, Sky Attack is extremely exploitable due to the charge turn. Mimic can be used to attempt to copy a useful move from Mew, such as Swords Dance, Soft-Boiled, Thunder Wave, or Body Slam. However, Mewtwo and Slowbro can still switch in with little issue. Wing Attack has a whopping 56 PP, which, in combination with Reflect and Double-Edge, gives Aerodactyl 112 spare PP to slowly stall out Mew and Snorlax.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo switches into all of Aerodactyl's attacks with little issue, taking negligible damage from even a critical hit Double-Edge while forcing Aerodactyl out with the threat of a 2HKO from any of its special attacks. If Mewtwo gets burned by Fire Blast, this allows it to block other status later on. Mewtwo only has to fear a critical hit Sky Attack, which does 79.2% minimum to it.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro, much like Mewtwo, switches into all of Aerodactyl's attacks with ease and threatens it out with the threat of paralysis and a 2HKO from Surf. Slowbro does have to fear a critical hit from Sky Attack though, as it takes 72.7% minimum and, unlike Mewtwo, is slower than Aerodactyl and lacks immediate recovery.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Aerodactyl takes heavy damage from all Ice-type moves from the likes of Tauros, Chansey, and Amnesia Snorlax. Amnesia Snorlax can be a major issue for Aerodactyl, as Aerodactyl is OHKOed by a +2 Blizzard, preventing it from fulfilling its role as a Snorlax check.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types, such as Zapdos and Jolteon, deal significant damage to Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt, with Zapdos even having a 46.2% chance to OHKO it, whereas Zapdos takes negligible damage in return from Double-Edge and does not fear burn from Fire Blast. Jolteon Speed tying Aerodactyl means Aerodactyl can't attempt to break through it with critical hits, as it risks getting KOed by Thunderbolt after recoil from Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Aerodactyl's Double-Edge and is only 6HKOed by Fire Blast, while it 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt in return, although getting burned by Fire Blast limit's Gengar's longevity as a pivot. Burn also halves the power of Gengar's already middling Explosion. Gengar also has to fear Sky Attack, as it's OHKOed by a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie forces out Aerodactyl with the threat of paralysis and a 2HKO from any of its super effective coverage moves, while Aerodactyl can only 4HKO it with Double-Edge; however, Starmie has to fear Sky Attack, as it's OHKOed by a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Rhydon and Golem both 2HKO Aerodactyl with Rock Slide and take next to no damage from Double-Edge and Fire Blast; however, they have to be wary of getting burned by Fire Blast, as a burned Rhydon or Golem is effectively decommissioned.</p> <p><strong>Non-standard Mew</strong>: Uncommon Mew sets, such as Rock Slide Mew, special attacking Mew, and Transform Mew can catch Aerodactyl off guard; +6 Mew 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Rock Slide even with Reflect up, and special attacking Mew 2HKOes Aerodactyl with super effective moves and 3HKOes with Psychic. Special attacking Mew also does not fear burn from Fire Blast. Transform Mew stalls Aerodactyl out of PP over time.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Rest + Reflect lets Aerodactyl comfortably switch into most Mew and Snorlax sets as well as Tauros lacking Blizzard. Aerodactyl can take up to 5 Body Slam hits from a +6 Mew and 11 Body Slams from Snorlax once it sets up Reflect, so it can use Rest very safely. This lets Aerodactyl stall these foes out of attacking PP, as it can switch in repeatedly to shut them down offensively; special attackers like Mewtwo and Slowbro will usually switch in, so Aerodactyl needs to be partnered with teammates that can switch into them consistently, such as Chansey, Slowbro, and Soft-Boiled Mew. Reflect is imperative on Aerodactyl, as without it, it can be broken through with ease by Mew carrying Body Slam. Snorlax and Tauros lacking Blizzard can also give Aerodactyl issues if it lacks Reflect. With paralysis from Body Slam and Tauros's 21.48% critical hit rate, Tail Whip Tauros can also break a chipped Aerodactyl quite easily if it lacks Reflect.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's main attacking move is Double-Edge, as it does serviceable damage to less bulky foes. However, Double-Edge deals poor damage to bulkier foes such as Mewtwo and Slowbro, which threaten it back with strong special attacks and paralysis. Fire Blast has a 30% chance to burn the foe, incapacitating physical attackers such as Mew, Snorlax, and Tauros. However, Aerodactyl has to be wary of burning foes such as Mewtwo and Starmie, as the burn damage is negligible to them and lets them switch in and block other status later on.</p>"

    "tradebacksou": {
      "overview": "<p>Snorlax is the single most centralizing and defining Pokemon in the tier; the addition of a reliable sleep move to its already wide movepool pushes it to even further heights than before, as nothing can reliably block its Lovely Kiss with paralysis. Nothing switches into Snorlax with complete safety; even Pokemon that resist or are immune to its STAB moves, such as Rhydon and Gengar, are at the mercy of one of its many coverage moves. Snorlax is also incredibly bulky, being one of the few Pokemon that can take a hit from the likes of Tauros and Starmie and hit back even harder with a powerful STAB Body Slam or Hyper Beam; it can also use its STAB Self-Destruct, which demolishes non-resistant foes. Snorlax is on nearly every single serious team and cannot afford to be dropped.</p> <p>However, Snorlax has an abysmal base 30 Speed, tying it with Slowbro for slowest Pokemon in the tier. Its reliance on Rest for recovery makes it exploitable and easily forced out by Pokemon with high critical hit rates such as Alakazam, Starmie, and Tauros. This poor base Speed also saddles Snorlax with a measly 5.86% critical hit rate. That isn't Snorlax's only issue though, as while it has many different options to cover a wide array of matchups, it has to either give up longevity or coverage to do so, meaning there is always something to exploit no matter what set Snorlax runs.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Punch can be used over Ice Beam on Amnesia sets, as it has more PP, which allows Snorlax to stick around for even longer and take more chances to attempt to freeze a foe; however, it is weaker than Ice Beam. Ice Punch can also be used on Reflect sets, as it can freeze opposing Reflect Snorlax and Reflect Chansey and also 3HKOes Rhydon; however, it does negligible damage to even neutral targets. A set consisting of three attacks + Rest can be used to give Snorlax the extra utility of a third attacking move over Reflect while still being able to last longer, but it is difficult to wake Snorlax up without Reflect, as many Pokemon threaten to KO it while it's asleep. A set consisting of two attacks, Lovely Kiss, and Rest can also be used to let Snorlax threaten sleep and preserve itself without falling short in the coverage department. Thunderbolt can be used on Amnesia sets, with a +4 Thunderbolt OHKOing Cloyster and being favored to OHKO Starmie. However, it's generally preferred to run another move, as it doesn't do much else; Body Slam, Self-Destruct, and Snorlax's various utility options all tend to be more useful. Thunderbolt can also replace Amnesia Snorlax's Ice-type move, as Amnesia Snorlax doesn't need the Ice-type coverage to have a decent matchup against most foes. However, this is generally inadvisable, since Snorlax is then walled by Rhydon and Golem. Amnesia can be used in conjunction with Reflect to wall foes both physically and specially. However, this leaves Snorlax with only one attacking move. Headbutt can be used against paralyzed foes to attempt to paraflinch them, but it is unreliable and weaker than Body Slam.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is on every competitive team, meaning it will usually end up facing itself. The most important factor in the matchup is whether Sleep Clause has been activated for either side, as Lovely Kiss Snorlax threatens to instantly remove its opposition. A paralyzed Lovely Kiss Snorlax can switch into a Snorlax using Lovely Kiss to deny sleep and threaten it in return. If neither Snorlax threatens Lovely Kiss, Reflect Snorlax can switch into offensive Snorlax sets bar Amnesia and beat them quite comfortably when healthy. If Reflect Snorlax is paralyzed, it struggles to consistently switch into opposing Snorlax, as the chance to lose a turn to full paralysis can cost the game. Amnesia Snorlax can catch a Reflect Snorlax off-guard (RH) and threaten it with boosted special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster switches into Snorlax's Body Slam relatively safely thanks to its staggering base 180 Defense; it also walls most variants of Amnesia Snorlax thanks to its 4x resistance to Ice. Cloyster is also able to tank Snorlax's Self-Destruct decently, as it only does 75.5% maximum. Cloyster 4HKOes Snorlax with Blizzard and can chip it with Clamp. Cloyster can also use Explosion on Snorlax if it's weakened to put Snorlax into KO range of a revenge killer, doing 60% minimum. However, Cloyster must be wary of Lovely Kiss as well as Body Slam paralysis. Cloyster is particularly wary of Hyper Beam Snorlax, as if it is paralyzed by Body Slam, it is at serious risk of being put into Hyper Beam's KO range.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro switches into Snorlax's Body Slam with relative ease, as it is 4HKOed most of the time and threatens Snorlax with paralysis and Amnesia-boosted Surf. Slowbro can also set up Reflect to become even better at tanking Snorlax's hits. However, Slowbro can quickly get worn down into Hyper Beam's KO range and fears Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: While there aren't many special attackers that enjoy taking a Body Slam, many special attackers, such as Alakazam, Starmie, Exeggutor, and Zapdos, can 3HKO Snorlax with their STAB attacks, applying significant pressure. This is especially true if Snorlax has used Rest, often forcing it out while it's still asleep.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar walls non-Amnesia Snorlax without Earthquake, although Gengar risks getting frozen if Snorlax has an Ice-type move. Gengar is a great Lovely Kiss absorber, as even if it's asleep, it can freely attempt to wake up in front of Snorlax without Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: The passive and unassuming Porygon finds a niche in completely stonewalling non-Amnesia variants of Snorlax once Sleep Clause is activated, as it is 3HKOed by Body Slam and stalls Snorlax out of attacking PP with Recover. Snorlax can OHKO it with Self-Destruct, but trading Snorlax for Porygon is an awful trade for the Snorlax user in most circumstances. Even if Sleep Clause is not activated, Porygon's generally low value makes it a good choice to absorb sleep.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Unparalyzed Chansey switches into Snorlax and sets up Reflect once Sleep Clause is active, while Counter Chansey can OHKO Snorlax by correctly predicting Body Slam. If Chansey is paralyzed, it finds it much harder to reliably check Snorlax, as unparalyzed Snorlax now outspeeds it, and the full paralysis chance makes it unreliable even against paralyzed Snorlax. Once it's paralyzed, Chansey is also extremely susceptible to Hyper Beam, even if Snorlax is paralyzed. Snorlax can also choose to use Self-Destruct to OHKO Chansey without Reflect set up to enable its special attacking teammates.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types wall Snorlax lacking coverage, as they take negligible damage from Snorlax's STAB attacks. Rock-types without Rest are, however, prone to getting worn down over time and hamstrung by Body Slam paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Persian</strong>: Persian can switch into a Snorlax that has used Rest and put it under major pressure, as two Slashes followed by either a critical hit Body Slam or Body Slam and another Slash KO Snorlax. Persian can also threaten Snorlax and its teammates with Hypnosis.</p>",

        "Offensive Sleeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is the defining set of RBY Tradebacks, combining utility and raw power in a way that completely restructures the rest of the metagame. With just two moves, Body Slam and Lovely Kiss, Snorlax exerts a tremendous amount of pressure on the opposing team the moment it hits the field, threatening to deal significant damage to most of the tier and incapacitating anything that attempts to check it with Lovely Kiss before continuing on its rampage. Earthquake is Snorlax’s best coverage option, dealing heavy damage to Rhydon and Gengar—two of the few Pokemon not threatened by its Body Slam—and allowing Snorlax to scout for Counter on Chansey and opposing Snorlax while still doing serviceable damage. Hyper Beam is the other common choice, allowing Snorlax to threaten KOs against many common Pokemon, such as Chansey, Persian, Tauros, Exeggutor, and Hypno, after only one or two hits. Self-Destruct rounds out this moveset, allowing Snorlax to threaten extreme damage while low on health or when its team needs it to force immediate progress. It OHKOes physically frail foes such as Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam and does heavy damage to even physically bulky threats, doing a minimum of 72.2% to Slowbro and 64% to Cloyster. However, Snorlax is usually forced to use Self-Destruct rather early due to its awful base Speed.</p> <p>This set single-handedly influences the tier in numerous ways, making the tier faster paced compared to standard OU. With this Snorlax set, it is far less risky for teams to focus on spreading paralysis early, since its physical moves let it reliably push sleep past common sleep blockers, such as Alakazam, Chansey, and Starmie This set makes Snorlax extremely difficult to check because it can rely on allies to paralyze physically frail foes, and it can then put the physically defensive foes that would otherwise withstand its attacks to sleep. After Snorlax has put a foe to sleep, it still is extremely threatening and can continue battering away at the enemy team due to its raw damage output.</p> <p>Despite these upsides, this Snorlax set requires team support due to its lack of defensive utility. Without any form of recovery, Snorlax is not able to reliably switch into physical attackers throughout the game, necessitating it be paired with teammates such as Starmie and Cloyster, which can help cover these roles traditionally filled by Snorlax. This set’s lack of recovery also makes Snorlax vulnerable to getting worn down, as it is often forced to take a hit before it can land an attack or Lovely Kiss due to its poor base Speed. Snorlax benefits greatly from teammates that can spread paralysis, such as Chansey, Alakazam, Starmie, Zapdos, and Exeggutor, which alleviate some of this pressure. This Snorlax set also works well on fast-paced hyper offensive teams that attempt to mow down the foe with multiple Explosion users.</p>"
        },
        "Mixed Attacker (Amnesia)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Amnesia can not only let Snorlax perform as a threatening mixed attacker, but it can also give it a decent defensive profile depending on the moves it uses, allowing it to either play the role of wallbreaker or a less immediately threatening but longer-lasting mixed attacker. The offensive variant uses Blizzard and either Lovely Kiss or Self-Destruct to mow down foes quickly. +2 Blizzard OHKOes Rhydon and Golem, 2HKOes Zapdos, Persian, and Exeggutor, and has a 76.2% chance to 2HKO Tauros. It also 3HKOes Gengar and opposing Snorlax, which allows it to break through opposing Reflect Snorlax. Lovely Kiss allows Snorlax to put a foe it might otherwise struggle against, such as Cloyster or Starmie, to sleep; it also gives Snorlax a good opportunity to set up Amnesia, which it may otherwise struggle to do. Self-Destruct lets it KO or heavily damage a foe once it has been worn down, and it also gives Snorlax a good way to free itself from dire situations. The more defensive variant forgoes Blizzard for Ice Beam and runs Rest in place of Lovely Kiss or Self-Destruct. Ice Beam is much weaker than Blizzard; at +2 it 3HKOes Tauros, Exeggutor, and Zapdos and 4HKOes opposing Snorlax, but it allows Snorlax to stick around for longer and attempt to freeze a foe.</p> <p>Amnesia Snorlax requires paralysis support to make significant progress for its team, as foes such as Chansey and Starmie may thwart it if they are left unparalyzed. Body Slam is also usually not sufficient enough to handle a healthy Cloyster. Offensive Amnesia Snorlax should try to switch in on either a Pokemon using a recovery move or an attack that will deal minimal damage, as it needs to be at or near full HP to pressure the opposing team. Defensive Amnesia Snorlax should attempt to do the same, but it can afford to switch into a stray special attack from the likes of a paralyzed Starmie or Exeggutor if need be. The defensive set can also attempt to get past the likes of Starmie and Reflect Chansey by freezing them.</p>"
        },
        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Reflect lets Snorlax take full advantage of its good physical bulk, allowing it to shrug off hits from the likes of Tauros, Rhydon, and opposing Snorlax while still being offensively threatening itself. The fourth move on Reflect sets can change depending on what coverage is required for Snorlax's team. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar and Jolteon, 3HKOes Rhydon, and scouts for Counter on Chansey and opposing Snorlax, although it lacks the offensive power of Hyper Beam or Self-Destruct. Hyper Beam is Snorlax's best move against chipped foes; it also allows it to feasibly beat Cloyster and Slowbro one-on-one, but Hyper Beam leaves Snorlax walled by Rock-types and Gengar and has a limited amount of PP. Self-Destruct allows Snorlax to remove or heavily damage a foe after it has fulfilled its role as a wall. It is also a good option to KO a foe in an emergency, and it makes Reflect Snorlax less reliant on its teammates to force progress, although it shares similar issues to Hyper Beam. Lovely Kiss allows Reflect Snorlax to push sleep past paralyzed Chansey, Alakazam, and Starmie to remove foes it may have trouble breaking otherwise, such as Cloyster. However, it leaves Snorlax with only Body Slam as an attacking move, giving it limited PP to threaten things and leaving it walled by Rock-types and Gengar.</p> <p>Reflect allows Snorlax to be a durable check to the tier's best physically offensive threats. Reflect is crucial to Snorlax's longevity, as it allows it to reliably use Rest to heal off damage and paralysis; without Reflect, Snorlax's bulk is not good enough to reliably wake up. Reflect Snorlax is one of the tier's best switch-ins to most opposing Snorlax sets if an ally has already been put to sleep. It's also a decent switch-in to Tauros, though Tauros's high critical hit rate makes any switch-in somewhat unsafe. Snorlax has to utilize its HP carefully to balance its role as an offensive powerhouse with its use as a durable physical tank that can last throughout the game. While it doesn't love getting paralyzed, it is much more willing to take it than sets lacking Rest, as it can reliably cure itself at a later point in the game; Snorlax also still pressures the vast majority of the tier even when it's paralyzed.</p>"
        },
        "PhysLax (All-Out Attacker)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Snorlax's good bulk and amazing Attack allow it to function well as an all-out physical attacker, being able to go one-on-one against nearly every single foe with the combination of Body Slam, Hyper Beam, Earthquake, and Self-Destruct. Hyper Beam threatens KOs against many common threats after only one or two hits, such as Chansey, Persian, Tauros, Exeggutor, and Hypno. Earthquake is Snorlax’s best coverage option, threatening heavy damage on Rock-types and Gengar, which aren't threatened by its STAB moves. Earthquake also has the advantage of being able to scout for Counter on Chansey and opposing Snorlax, with Earthquake still putting Chansey into Hyper Beam KO range. Earthquake or Hyper Beam can be dropped in favor of Counter to catch opposing Snorlax and Tauros off guard—landing Counter against Tauros's Body Slam leaves it in Hyper Beam range, and landing Counter on opposing Snorlax's Body Slam deals at least 48.4% to it. Once Snorlax is low on HP, it can use Self-Destruct to punch another hole in the opposing team; physically frail threats such as Chansey, Starmie, and Alakazam are OHKOed and even physically bulky threats such as Cloyster and Slowbro take heavy damage.</p> <p>PhysLax, much like Lovely Kiss Snorlax, is on a timer to get things done due to its lack of recovery and poor Speed. It also needs to play around the threat of paralysis, losing much of its offensive pressure and struggling to break many foes without using Self-Destruct if it takes paralysis. PhysLax can be used on teams that already have a reliable sleeper, such as Exeggutor or Jynx, that also want the extra utility of an additional attack. To make full use of PhysLax, it's vital to know when to preserve it and when to sacrifice it with Self-Destruct; it usually wants to use Self-Destruct when it's either backed into a corner or relatively low on HP. This Snorlax set greatly enjoys heavy paralysis support, so Pokemon such as Starmie, Chansey, and Exeggutor make great teammates to it. This set also pairs well with other Explosion users, such as Exeggutor and Golem, on fast-paced hyper offense teams that aim to overwhelm the opponent. Starmie and Cloyster make good partners to this set, as it lacks defensive utility; without recovery, Snorlax is not able to reliably switch into physical attackers throughout the game, which Starmie and Cloyster can do well in Snorlax's place. This set’s lack of recovery also makes it prone to getting worn down quickly and being forced to use Self-Destruct quite early, as it is often forced to take a hit before it can land an attack due to its poor base Speed.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Thanks to its incredible bulk, offensive prowess, and varied movepool, Snorlax is a near-mandatory Pokemon for every RBY Ubers team. Its Body Slam is incredibly powerful, and few Pokemon can consistently handle it. However, Body Slam isn’t the only weapon Snorlax has in its arsenal. Earthquake and its Ice-type coverage allows Snorlax to deal with Normal-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Rhydon, Golem, and Gengar. Snorlax also has access to STAB Self-Destruct, which, paired with its base 110 Attack, is the strongest unboosted move in the game. With Self-Destruct, Snorlax is one of the best Pokemon to deal with the kings of RBY Ubers: Mewtwo, Mew, and Chansey. Moreover, in order to increase its physical bulk and longevity, Snorlax can sometimes run Reflect and Rest, allowing it to consistently check opposing Snorlax and Tauros.</p> <p>However, Snorlax is incredibly slow. With base 30 Speed, it’s slower than every other fully evolved Pokemon except Slowbro. Therefore, Snorlax has to take a hit before acting, meaning it will be easier to KO, especially if Snorlax doesn’t run Rest. Rest is the only option Snorlax has to heal. Once Rest is used, Snorlax becomes passive, giving the opponent the chance to send anything in against it, especially special attackers like Exeggutor, Alakazam, and Mewtwo, which can effectively pressure it with the nuclear Psychic.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Amnesia is conceivable. Paired with Reflect and Rest, Snorlax becomes nigh unbreakable, but, in return, Snorlax has only one slot for an attacking move, severely limiting its offensive potential. Ice Beam and Blizzard are terrible against Ice-type Pokemon and only pressure Chansey and Mewtwo with the threat of a freeze. This is quite notable, as it will essentially KO them and free up your own Mewtwo, but this can be easily played around. On the other hand, opting for Body Slam leaves Snorlax helpless against common bulky answers like Cloyster, Mew, Slowbro, Mewtwo, Gengar, and Rhydon. You can also choose to pair Amnesia with Rest, Body Slam, and Blizzard, but this set has trouble with opposing physical attackers, which can exploit the fact that Snorlax is not an immediate danger. Unfortunately, this Snorlax combines both PhysLax and ReflectLax's problems, since it is weak to physical attacks and very passive once Rest is used. Finally, every Amnesia Snorlax can realistically lose against Mewtwo due to its very high critical hit ratio.</p> <p>Snorlax has access to plenty of Normal-type moves. Double-Edge and Mega Kick are stronger than Body Slam, but due to their negative aspects—namely, Double-Edge's recoil and Mega Kick's low accuracy—Body Slam remains a better option. Headbutt lets Snorlax fish for flinches against paralyzed foes, which can be useful in some situations; however, it’s hard to find the space for this move in Snorlax's moveset without compromising its offensive prowess.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Opposing Snorlax</strong>: With Reflect and Rest, Snorlax is able to nullify the action of opposing Snorlax without losing its offensive potential. However, it will eventually be forced to use Rest, leaving it open for setup sweepers like Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Mew to break it. To some extent, PhysLax can come in to wear down opposing PhysLax with Body Slam and Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Thanks to its natural bulk, Slowbro stomachs everything Snorlax can do, repeatedly using Rest to PP stall Body Slam. In addition, Slowbro can threaten Snorlax and the opposing team with Thunder Wave and Amnesia before it threatens to sweep. Slowbro will usually win one-on-one through sheer brute force, often forcing PhysLax sets to use Self-Destruct in a desperate bid to stop it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Many special attackers are able to inflict a lot of damage to Snorlax. However, these Pokemon, namely Mewtwo, Exeggutor, Alakazam, Zapdos, and Starmie, hate to eat take a Body Slam due to high damage and paralysis chance, the latter of which can completely flip the situation and possibly allow Snorlax to win outright. However, they can effectively pressure a Snorlax that has just used Rest, usually forcing it out. Mewtwo can also set up with Amnesia as Snorlax switches out, which can be monumentally difficult to check.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: With its base 180 Defense and Rest, Cloyster is able to handle Snorlax long-term, staving off its Body Slam. Its Blizzard deals a large amount of damage to Snorlax, 3HKOing it if even slightly chipped, all while backed by a small freeze chance. However, freezing Snorlax is often detrimental in RBY Ubers, as freezing Chansey or Mewtwo is often a priority. Cloyster's unique access to Clamp allows it to easily chip Snorlax into Blizzard 3HKO range or pivot to a more effective Pokemon to check Snorlax. Snorlax can situationally win against Cloyster if it lands Body Slam paralysis or gets lucky with critical hits, but this is often ill-advised, as it leaves Snorlax vulnerable to being PP stalled by opposing Reflect Snorlax or Chansey in the long-run.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Rhydon is faster than Snorlax, and its Earthquake 3HKOes Snorlax in 97% of cases. On the other side, Snorlax’s Earthquake also 3HKOes Rhydon. Rhydon's Normal resistance gives it many opportunities to come onto the field. However, Rhydon should be careful of paralysis from Body Slam, which can tip the outcome of the duel in Snorlax's favor. Finally, Rhydon with Rest totally walls a Snorlax without Earthquake, Ice Beam, or Blizzard, but these Snorlax sets remain uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Thanks to its Normal immunity, Gengar can easily switch on Snorlax, trying to absorb Body Slam or Self-Destruct and threatening it with Hypnosis or Explosion. Unfortunately, in most cases, Snorlax runs Earthquake in its moveset, making the task harder to complete for Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Surprisingly, Snorlax is unable to beat Porygon without using Self-Destruct or having it paralyzed prior. Indeed, Porygon is faster and can repeatedly use Recover, waiting for Snorlax to run out of Body Slam PP. However, Porygon is very passive and totally useless against every other Pokemon, meaning Snorlax can just switch out without fear, although Thunder Wave can be irksome. However, the tables are turned if Snorlax uses Amnesia, which lets it muscle past Porygon completely. Snorlax shouldn't Self-Destruct, freeze, or really interact with Porygon at all, as its low value outside of checking Snorlax means every move spent trying to beat it is batter spent on anything else outside of forcing it to use Recover.</p>",

        "PhysLax (All-out Attacker)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set, often abbreviated as \"PhysLax,\" is the most popular set in RBY Ubers. With this combination of moves, Snorlax is one of the most difficult Pokemon to switch in on. In addition to the terrifying power of Snorlax's Body Slam, foes must be wary of its paralysis chance on non-Normal-types. With the most powerful Self-Destruct in the game, Snorlax can take down almost any opposing Pokemon other than Rhydon, Golem, and the Normal-immune Gengar, creating a favorable situation; the threat of Self-Destruct forces out high-value Pokemon like Mew and Mewtwo, letting Snorlax make further use of its powerful Body Slam while spreading paralysis. Also, note that Body Slam immediately followed by Self-Destruct KOes Mewtwo and nearly KOes Mew. Hyper Beam has incredible wallbreaking potential after Body Slam, letting Snorlax score 2HKOs against Jolteon and paralyzed Chansey; after two Body Slams, Hyper Beam can even KO Mewtwo. Earthquake allows Snorlax to hit Gengar and Rhydon, which may switch into Snorlax's Normal-type moves. Against opposing Normal-types, Snorlax can use Counter on their very likely Body Slam. This will put Tauros into Body Slam KO range or KO it if Tauros lands a critical hit. Counter also allows you to pressure your opponent if they switch Tauros out after using Body Slam, doing good damage thanks to Snorlax’s massive HP stat. Unfortunately, Snorlax has to drop Earthquake or Hyper Beam to fit Counter in its moveset. If Snorlax is not running Earthquake, it is helpless against Gengar and Rock-types, whereas by choosing to drop Hyper Beam, Snorlax loses a great part of its offensive potential.</p> <p>Snorlax mainly acts as a wallbreaker, whch can tear holes in the opposing team with Body Slam. Once on the field, Snorlax is pretty self-sufficient, so it requires little support. However, it needs to switch in safely. At first glance, Snorlax eats low-damaging moves and can easily switch on them. Even though it takes low damage from many attacks, this Snorlax can't recover HP, and chip damage may be enough to wear it down, so be attentive to any damage taken. Paralysis support benefits Snorlax greatly, as switching in on a paralyzed Pokemon often gives Snorlax the opportunity to threaten the now-slower Pokemon—and by extension, the opposing team that may want to protect it—with heavy damage. One of the most appreciated switch-in opportunities is a paralyzed Chansey, as it lacks the firepower to contest Snorlax and is physically frail, being OHKOed by Self-Destruct and 2HKOed by Body Slam + Hyper Beam. Because many RBY Ubers teams rely on Chansey to duel Mewtwo, it's often not worth it to stay in on Snorlax, forcing it out. Another common way to safely bring in Snorlax is to force a paralyzed Pokemon to heal; this lets Snorlax come in safely on moves like Recover, Soft-Boiled, and Rest, granting immense momentum. Snorlax checks, such as Porygon and Cloyster, trouble the common paralysis gameplan. Cloyster is very bulky but is susceptible to Body Slam paralysis; with some luck, Snorlax can break through Cloyster, though there are alternative solutions such as having Mewtwo or Mew use it as setup fodder while it is asleep. Ways to play around opposing Porygon are similar: it's very passive, so you can send almost anything else in and usually force it out. Finally, a Reflect Snorlax might attempt to switch into Snorlax, trying to curb its action. If you can force it to Rest, you can then pressure it with your strong special attackers, such as Mewtwo, while also creating opportunities to switch in later.</p> <p>Self-Destruct can take down a very useful opposing Pokemon, opening doors for the rest of your team while bringing strong allies in with impunity. Self-Destruct is one way to deal with a paralyzed threat, such as a paralyzed Mewtwo, inflicting between 78% and 93% damage, which may KO it or allow you to revenge kill it with a faster Pokemon like Tauros or Mew. The threat of Self-Destruct may force out the opposing Pokemon, creating favorable momentum. Finally, at low HP, Snorlax can also use Self-Destruct, hoping to take down an opposing Pokemon with it. Keep in mind that Self-Destruct is very predictable, and an experienced player will try to predict it by sending in Pokemon like Gengar, Golem, and Rhydon, or they may opt to sacrifice a sleeping, frozen, or heavily weakened Pokemon. Moreover, be careful not to use Self-Destruct too early, as you might need Snorlax later.</p>"

        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is mandatory, being one of the most difficult attacks to switch into due to its power and paralysis chance. Reflect increases Snorlax’s physical bulk, giving it the ability to check opposing physical attackers like Rhydon, Golem, Tauros, and opposing Snorlax. With Rest, Snorlax is able to stay healthy to maintain its role throughout the game. Snorlax can either run Earthquake ro Self-Destruct in its last moveslot. Earthquake gives Snorlax coverage to beat Rhydon, Golem, and Gengar. However, Snorlax might lack an offensive presence, especially against Mew and Mewtwo, which love to use it as setup fodder. In order to compensate this lack of power, Snorlax can run Self-Destruct instead of Earthquake. With Self-Destruct, Snorlax threatens almost every Pokemon in the game. However, with this set, Gengar and Rock-types totally wall Snorlax.</p> <p>Reflect Snorlax can repeatedly enter the battle to sponge weaker moves. Since Snorlax carries Body Slam and other physical moves, it's able to put pressure on paralyzed Pokemon. With Reflect, Snorlax becomes the best answer to opposing Snorlax and Tauros, which inflict superficial damage while Reflect is active, and Snorlax strikes them back with a nuclear Body Slam. Mew sets lacking Earthquake are also walled by this Snorlax set, since Mew’s Body Slam inflicts 30% to Snorlax at most. A huge drawback to this set is the passivity of Snorlax once it has used Rest. Like any sleeping Pokemon, Snorlax is fodder for both Amnesia Mewtwo and Swords Dance Mew.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Snorlax is a centerpiece of the RBY OU metagame. It is present on almost every team due to its incredible strength, bulk, and versatility, in spite of its terrible Speed. Thanks to Reflect, Snorlax can upgrade its physical bulk to truly remarkable levels and begin firing powerful Body Slams with little concern about incoming hits. Defensive answers to its Body Slam do exist, but Snorlax has access to a plethora of options to threaten them, such as Earthquake to get around Gengar and Counter users, or Ice Beam to freeze Pokemon which try to fight Snorlax's Reflect with their own. Furthermore, Snorlax can even opt to give up a traditional Reflect set and catch opponents off-guard by using less common moves such as Amnesia or Counter, which can allow it to bypass some common answers, and it even has access to the strongest Self-Destruct in the game, giving it the ability to eliminate almost any Pokemon if necessary, with only Gengar and Rhydon being able to comfortably absorb it.</p> <p>Despite all these positive qualities, Snorlax comes with two inherent flaws: the lowest Speed in the metagame, only tied with Slowbro, and a lack of recovery outside of Rest. This means that once Snorlax is put to sleep it is possible for many special attackers in the tier to threaten it with their STAB moves: Psychic from the likes of Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and even Jynx can rapidly snowball out of control due to the high chance of Special drops, and other strong attacks such as STAB Thunderbolt from Zapdos or STAB Blizzard from any of the Ice-types in the tier can also ensure Snorlax is punished for its Rest turns. Nevertheless, Snorlax is one of the biggest offensive threats and one of the hardest Pokemon to KO at the same time, and its set can be tailored to cover any desirable match ups effectively, which means it's usually hard to find reasons not to run Snorlax on your team.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Snorlax can drop Body Slam entirely to run an Ice Beam / Reflect / Amnesia / Rest set that simply aims to soak up damage and spam Ice Beam until it manages to freeze a foe, but it generally needs to be on very specific types of teams to function, is completely helpless against Ice-types, and needs some luck to break through paralyzed Starmie and Chansey, as Ice Beam's limited PP means so Snorlax cannot fish for consecutive paralysis for long.</p> <p>Surf is the best option available to Snorlax to hit Rhydon and Golem, but given that most Snorlax sets run either Reflect or an Ice-type attack, if not both, the situations where Surf is useful are rare.</p> <p>Harden is sometimes preferred over Reflect for the higher PP count and ability to reapply the Speed drop on paralyzed foes, but it is considerably weaker at answering physical attackers, which is usually the primary duty of Reflect Snorlax.</p> <p>Another unusual set is Body Slam / Amnesia / Thunderbolt / Self-Destruct or Rest: given that Starmie and Cloyster are common switch-ins once Amnesia is revealed and that Thunderbolt is a very, very uncommon attack on Snorlax, this set can attempt to lure them in and cripple them with a strong super-effective attack. Self-Destruct is preferred in the final slot as an emergency option that allows Snorlax to bail out of unsuccessful lure attempts with an even trade, but it is possible to use Rest instead in an attempt to preserve Snorlax as a long-term defensive answer. On this set, it is also possible to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam to avoid being completely walled by Rhydon, though it makes Snorlax much weaker against Chansey and Alakazam, so it is usually not preferred.</p> <p>Body Slam / Reflect / Rest sets can afford a few more options in the fourth moveslot. Toxic can allow partial trappers such as Cloyster, Moltres, Victreebel, and Dragonite to be significantly more dangerous, as any poisoned Pokemon attempting to stall out their PP will run out of HP much more quickly, and Snorlax is particularly good at luring in optimal Toxic targets such as Reflect Chansey. Another move that can fill that slot is Amnesia, making Snorlax incredibly difficult to threaten via special attacks alone but ultimately leaving it relatively powerless, with Body Slam as its only attack. Counter is also viable, as after Reflect has been revealed, opponents will most likely stop playing around Counter, giving you some opportunities to net surprise KOs with it.</p> <p>Other Normal-type attacks such as Mega Kick and Double-Edge are rarely seen due to their drawbacks and overall lack of usefulness when Body Slam is such a reliable move and Hyper Beam is a much stronger one, but the ability to repeatedly hit with a greater Base Power can occasionally come in handy.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Reflect Users</strong>: Reflect users, particularly Chansey and opposing Snorlax, can switch in on Body Slam and neutralize the damage output from Snorlax fairly efficiently. They are by far the most reliable defensive answers to Snorlax, and a vast majority of RBY teams are forced to include one of the two, if not both, to check it.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar deserves a special mention due to its unique Ghost typing, which allows it to wall all Snorlax sets that lack Earthquake and use Snorlax as an opportunity to threaten either status with Hypnosis or damage with Thunderbolt. It is especially useful against Snorlax sets that only run Normal-type attacks, but it also performs well against any set that lacks Earthquake or Amnesia (unless Snorlax gets a lucky freeze with Ice Beam).</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Slowbro</strong>: Cloyster and Slowbro are the next best options to switch into Body Slam. Their high defensive stats allow them to come out of the one-on-one matchup on top, but their reliance on Rest to stay healthy and failure to pose a significant immediate threat mean they aren't always the most reliable answers to Snorlax. Slowbro is especially notable, as it can use a sleeping Snorlax as a golden opportunity to set up Amnesia; however, Cloyster has better physical bulk, allowing it to avoid a 4HKO from Body Slam, as well as the ability to use Explosion in case things start to go wrong after paralysis from Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Other Special Attackers</strong>: Although there aren't many special attackers that enjoy taking a Body Slam to the face, many of them are powerful enough to 3HKO Snorlax, which means they can exert a lot of pressure over it, especially when it's forced to use Rest and sit still for a few turns. Starmie, Lapras, Exeggutor, and Zapdos are some good examples of Pokemon that can force Snorlax out with their strong STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Although Porygon's base stats are pitiful, it has access to a very specific set of qualities that make it just good enough to handle Snorlax: it is faster, it is immune to Body Slam's paralysis due to its typing, and Recover's 32 PP allow it to outstall Body Slam's 24 PP. Snorlax's only hopes of breaking down Porygon usually rest on the possibility of landing either a critical hit with Body Slam or a freeze with Ice Beam; however, Porygon is very weak, and it is incredibly easy for the Snorlax player to simply switch out.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types Carrying Rest</strong>: Another very specific countermeasure, Rock-types carrying Rest are generally able to outstall any Snorlax variant that isn't carrying the specific coverage for them. As long as the Rock-type has Rest to stall out repeated Body Slams, there are quite a few of them that can win the one-on-one matchup: non-Earthquake Snorlax will be unable to break through Omastar and Kabutops, non-Ice Beam Snorlax will struggle to wear down Aerodactyl, and even Rhydon can beat a Snorlax in the long run if Snorlax is only carrying Normal-type moves.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Reflect": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Snorlax's Body Slam is one of the most difficult attacks to switch into in the tier due to its sheer power, its paralysis chance, and the relative lack of Normal-type switch-ins in the tier. Reflect allows Snorlax to take on physical attackers, most importantly opposing Snorlax, much more comfortably. Rest gives Snorlax the ability to remain healthy throughout the game. A lot of moves can fit in the last moveslot. The most common one is Ice Beam, as it allows Snorlax to potentially freeze opposing Reflect users, which can otherwise neutralize its Body Slam; however, this leaves Snorlax unable to threaten large amounts of damage in one turn, which means its matchup against many important Pokemon such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, Cloyster, and Lapras goes from bad to worse, and even its ability to power through a paralyzed Starmie or Chansey goes down significantly. Self-Destruct allows Snorlax to function as a wallbreaker if needed, as well as a defensive piece thanks to Reflect and Rest if preferred, while Hyper Beam provides some of Self-Destruct's wallbreaking power without you having to sacrifice your Snorlax for it; however, a Snorlax that is only carrying Normal-type attacks will struggle against Rock-types and will be entirely unable to damage Ghost-types. Lastly, although Earthquake doesn't provide the freeze threat of Ice Beam or the immediate power of the other moves, it allows Snorlax to beat Gengar and Counter Chansey, two Pokemon that, albeit rare, are usually specifically devised to beat it.</p> <p>Using Reflect Snorlax is particularly nuanced due to having to balance Snorlax as both an offensive and defensive tool. If used too aggressively, it might take a KO but subsequently struggle to find turns to heal back up with Rest, making it a trade that is not always worth taking. On the other hand, if used too passively, it will invite too much offensive pressure and eventually collapse without achieving much of anything. Optimal usage of Reflect Snorlax requires careful analysis of the game state as well as appropriate prediction, but when properly managed, it is incredibly potent, as the special attackers that can threaten it lack either recovery or physical bulk, meaning that teams will generally resort to various stalling tactics to force Snorlax to use Rest first and then pressure it during its sleep turns. Reflect Snorlax is at its best early-game when the opponent has one or more paralyzed Pokemon to take advantage of, most commonly Alakazam and Chansey, and when its teammates can offer the necessary defensive cover against special attackers, but it is no slouch late-game either, as it can trade one-for-one with most Pokemon and has an important positive matchup against Tauros.</p>"
        },
        "Physical Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This moveset is fairly straightforward: maximize offensive prowess to wallbreak as well as possible. Body Slam is the go-to attack to inflict damage, and combined with Hyper Beam, it makes Snorlax particularly dangerous and hard to switch into, especially for paralyzed foes. Self-Destruct is an incredibly potent move to take down an extra Pokemon with Snorlax's last breath or even to take opposing Pokemon by surprise earlier on if the situation calls for it. The last moveslot is a toss-up: Earthquake allows Snorlax to play around Counter Chansey much more comfortably, as well as hitting Gengar and threatening Rhydon, but it can be dropped in favor of Counter, a tool that allows this Snorlax set to muscle through an opponent's Reflect Snorlax with correct prediction. Counter may also be used in conjunction with Earthquake and in place of Hyper Beam; the lack of Hyper Beam is quite noticeable, as it makes Snorlax much less threatening as a wallbreaker, but Earthquake offers unique coverage that could be worth keeping for specific matchups.</p> <p>The absence of recovery on this Snorlax set makes it far riskier to utilize, as it can only take a few hits before being forced to use Self-Destruct. Therefore, this Snorlax set needs to be considered as a tool to accelerate the game and little else, as its defensive capabilities are very limited. This often just means using an early-game Self-Destruct on the opponent's Reflect user to remove them from the situation before they get a chance to set up Reflect. It must be noted that this is a one-for-one trade, which is not always advantageous, but it is often the best that can be achieved with this set, as it is often endlessly walled by Reflect users otherwise; recognizing when to be greedy and when to accept a simple Self-Destruct trade is key to achieving good results with this Snorlax set.</p>"
        },
        "Mixed Attacker": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is the main attack to create pressure on the opposition and hopefully bait in Reflect Snorlax, which this set can take advantage of thanks to the combination of Amnesia and Blizzard. The last move defines the type of game you want to play with this set: Self-Destruct means hard and fast wallbreaking, as Snorlax simply doesn't have the durability to set up Amnesia multiple times throughout the game, while Rest gives Snorlax those opportunities to set up but leaves it notably vulnerable to Tauros. Ice Beam is an option over Blizzard for the higher PP, which is especially relevant on Rest sets, but Blizzard's considerably greater damage output is generally preferred.</p> <p>This set is quite dangerous to play against due to how difficult it is to answer if your Chansey is paralyzed. Nearly every other common Pokemon is threatened by either Body Slam or a boosted Blizzard, with Water-types like Starmie and Lapras being the best answers defensively but struggling to deal significant damage in return thanks to the Special boost. However, a healthy Chansey usually has no issues switching in and walling this Snorlax variant until it's forced to use Rest, which, in turn, leaves it vulnerable against Tauros. The conditions for this set to excel are difficult to set up, but when they are achieved, this Snorlax set can decide games on its own.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Articuno’s Blizzard is the strongest attack in RBY that is not Explosion or Hyper Beam. It can even outdamage Mewtwo’s mighty Psychic against neutral targets if both are unboosted. Articuno specializes in tearing huge holes in opposing teams, achieving things like 3HKOs on Mew and Snorlax, 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Zapdos, and clean OHKOs on Rhydon and Golem. Blizzard is very easy to spam, as even resistant Pokemon usually take noticeable damage. The move also comes with a nice chance to freeze and disable a foe for the rest of the game. Articuno also is decently bulky and can take a few strong attacks. For example, Tauros's Body Slam usually takes less than a quarter of its health, assuming it does not get a critical hit.</p> <p>However, Articuno's movepool is abysmal, with almost exclusively Ice- and Normal-type moves to choose from. The latter come off of its mediocre Attack stat, leaving it unable to deal with certain bulky Pokemon like Cloyster and Starmie. Articuno is also rather slow, requiring paralysis support or an Agility in order to function effectively against faster Pokemon. Articuno's low Speed also prevents it from functioning as a good lead, as it is outsped by common leads like Gengar, Jynx, and Starmie. These weaknesses can make Articuno hard to fit on teams at times. Still, Articuno's devastating Blizzard will reward you handsomely for the compensation it needs.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Articuno’s barren movepool leaves it with very few other options to choose from. Sky Attack is a decent option, being Articuno’s only Flying-type STAB move and very powerful in its own right. It can be used over Articuno’s Normal-type coverage, dealing huge damage to Chansey and more damage to Mewtwo. However, its two-turn nature makes it less reliable and harder to use than other moves, and Blizzard does more damage to Mewtwo over two turns. Another option is Ice Beam to save precious Blizzard PP in certain situations. Alongside Rest, it can be used to fish for a freeze, with about an 85% chance to get one with all of its PP used. However, Ice Beam Articuno is completely walled by Jynx and Chansey, since it must drop its Normal-type coverage.</p> <p>Articuno can also utilize Reflect, alongside Rest, to become a good tank that easily staves off hits from Tauros, Mew, and Snorlax. Reflect Articuno's main goal is to freeze a foe, so it should run Ice Beam to maximize that chance. If Articuno uses Reflect, it will likely forgo Agility. This means that, while not completely ruined by paralysis, Reflect Articuno is threatened more by it, since it is forced to use Rest and switch out to negate the Speed drop.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Cloyster completely walls Articuno, since it is 4x resistant to Ice, can't be frozen, and has huge Defense to make Hyper Beam deal next to no damage. Similarly, Lapras takes almost zero damage from Blizzard, can't be frozen, and threatens Articuno with Thunderbolt; however, it must watch out for Hyper Beam if it's at low health. Slowbro can easily set up Amnesia on Articuno but fears a stray freeze or critical hits from Blizzard. Starmie can hit Articuno hard with Thunderbolt and heal from Blizzard damage with Recover, but it too must be wary of a freeze.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: While Chansey must be somewhat healthy to switch in on Articuno carrying Hyper Beam, it takes relatively little damage from Blizzard and can scare Articuno away with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss. However, Chansey must be cautious to not be frozen in the process. Although rare, Articuno can use Sky Attack on a predicted switch to do massive damage the next turn; however, Chansey will likely just heal the damage off.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Jolteon outspeeds Articuno and will almost always 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Articuno also barely misses the 2HKO with Blizzard, meaning it needs a critical hit or a freeze to win one-on-one. Zapdos, albeit weak to Ice, outspeeds Articuno and threatens to 2HKO it with Thunderbolt while narrowly surviving one Blizzard. Jolteon and Zapdos can also paralyze an Agility-boosted Articuno with Thunder Wave to negate its Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: None of Articuno’s attacks hit Mewtwo very hard after it has used Amnesia, except a critical hit Blizzard, and Mewtwo has Recover to heal off any damage it does take. Even unorthodox Mewtwo sets can take at least two Blizzards, allowing Mewtwo to use Thunder Wave on Articuno followed by heavy-hitting moves like Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Mew, Gengar, and Snorlax, among others, can finish off a weakened Articuno with their powerful Explosions even after Articuno has set up with Agility. However, an Articuno using Reflect does not fear them.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blizzard will hit most everything harder than any other move in the game can, so Articuno will use it the most by far. Hyper Beam gives Articuno better odds to defeat Chansey, as Blizzard + Hyper Beam deals a minimum of 59% of damage to it, while also dealing massive damage to Jynx. Double-Edge can be used if Articuno wants to avoid Hyper Beam recharge mind games, but the recoil damage can easily put it into KO range of other threats. Rest allows Articuno to stick around for much longer and fire off more Blizzards. Agility lets Articuno outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. It also makes Articuno less reliant on team paralysis support.</p> <p>Articuno is best used early-game to rip holes into the opposing team with the sheer power of Blizzard, as even Water-types are afraid of switching into Blizzard because of its freeze chance. Switch Articuno in against weaker attacks, such as Chansey's attacks bar Thunderbolt, or on a predicted Earthquake from opposing Mew, Snorlax, or Tauros. It can also switch in against Earthquake from Rhydon or Golem, but it must be very careful, as Rock Slide from either can OHKO Articuno. However, if it manages to come in on their Earthquakes, Articuno will either OHKO them or force them out and do massive damage to something else. Articuno can also be used to absorb paralysis, since it can use Rest later to heal itself or use Agility to negate the Speed drop. Once Articuno is on the field, it should use Blizzard as often as it can and do as much damage to opposing teams as possible.</p> <p>Articuno greatly appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Exeggutor, Mew, and Zapdos. This allows it to be less reliant on Agility, letting it start doing damage faster and more consistently. However, one must be careful when using Thunder Wave, as a Water-type switching into it becomes immune to freeze, meaning Articuno cannot threaten it at all. Tauros can capitalize on holes Articuno makes in the opponent’s team while supporting it by dealing with opposing Chansey, Starmie, and Jynx. It can also spread paralysis with Body Slam to assist Articuno. Articuno appreciates teammates that can deal with Slowbro, which it is helpless against most of the time. Zapdos, Jolteon, and Thunderbolt Mewtwo can use critical Thunderbolts to bypass Amnesia boosts and do huge damage to Slowbro, while Cloyster, Starmie, Lapras, and Light Screen Chansey wall Slowbro even after it has gained boosts. Light Screen Chansey can also check Amnesia Mewtwo, which Articuno struggles to damage after it has set up. Teams with Articuno tend to be weak to Electric-types, so a check to them like Rhydon, Golem, or Jolteon is appreciated.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Articuno possesses the most powerful unboosted special attack in the game in its Blizzard, giving it offensive prowess rivaled only by the less consistent Moltres. This alone grants Articuno a strong niche in the tier, outspeeding and 2HKOing the mighty Exeggutor. This offense is backed by a reasonable 15% critical hit rate, with critical hit Blizzard OHKOing even Tauros. With Agility, Articuno can function as a late-game sweeper that is very difficult to stop when the stage is set. This is because it isn't just a strong offensive threat: it's also quite bulky, winning against Tauros one-on-one, or even Zapdos if at +2 Speed. Because of the increased presence of Rest Exeggutor, there are many opportunities for Articuno to switch in and turn the game on its head with nuclear damage output.</p> <p>However, Articuno has some deep pitfalls that make it difficult to use in Stadium OU. Team Preview is a massive hit to its viability, removing all surprise factor that helps set up for a sweep in cartridge play. Articuno only has Normal-type coverage and a poor Attack stat to use it with, so Pokemon like Chansey and Starmie, as well as the rarer Lapras and Cloyster, tend to wall it out. Additionally, its valuable Speed, while high relative to OU, means paralysis inducers force it out, which is worsened by Agility not negating the paralysis Speed drop, unlike standard play. It can use Rest to get rid of it, but this isn't ideal. Due to these flaws, Articuno can be seen as very linear, but its immense power is nothing to sneeze at.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Articuno's Blizzard is the main reason it sees play, OHKOing Rhydon, Golem, and the rare Nidoking; it also 2HKOes a majority of the tier, notably Exeggutor, Tauros, Zapdos, Persian, Kangaskhan, and Alakazam after using Substitute once. The freeze chance also cannot be ignored, giving Articuno a degree of volatility that means even consistent checks like Chansey aren't safe. Double-Edge allows Articuno to consistently pressure Substitute without losing valuable PP against users such as Chansey and Alakazam. It also pressures Blizzard-resistant Pokemon like Starmie and Lapras. Rest is crucial for allowing Articuno to make use of its bulk, giving it staying power against Snorlax and Tauros while removing the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>The third moveslot defines how Articuno will act for its team. Ice Beam acts as a weaker alternative to Blizzard with more PP while still finishing off Exeggutor, ensuring a sustained assault; it can also let Articuno fish for a freeze against big targets like Chansey. Reflect is a viable third option for a bulky approach, stonewalling Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros without much effort; they require two critical hit Body Slams to stop it from repeatedly using Rest if Reflect is active. Reflect doesn't protect Articuno from Persian, though, and it's threatened with a 3HKO from Slash. Agility lets Articuno take a late-game sweeping approach, which, combined with Rest, can be difficult for weakened teams to stop.</p> <p>Articuno cannot break through bulky Water-types, so it's best to cut your losses and have its teammates deal with them. Articuno is often used alongside Thunderbolt Chansey, Zapdos, or Jolteon, forming a two-pronged special offense that can be difficult for teams to counter; Jolteon also appreciates Articuno's Ground immunity. Additionally, Pokemon like Tauros and the ubiquitous Snorlax, which can muscle past physically frail Pokemon like Alakazam, are also of great assistance; Self-Destruct Snorlax also tends to help against Pokemon like Slowbro. Rhydon warrants consideration for reducing the holes opened up by Articuno's weaknesses to Electric and Rock. Gengar shuts down Persian offensively, has good Speed, and has access to Thunderbolt, all of which highly benefit Articuno; Gengar's Explosion also puts Chansey in KO range for Articuno's Double-Edge. Articuno functions best late-game when its bulky Water-type checks have been removed, though Team Preview often makes the opponent less inclined to use them, which frequently means aggressive double switching is necessary to force them in earlier than usual. Articuno can function as a mid-game tank if the opponent lacks a good check. If using Agility and intending to sweep, it's best to bring Articuno in upon a forced Rest from Pokemon like Exeggutor, letting it set up and attempt to muscle past. Articuno can arguably run Hyper Beam alongside Double-Edge despite the drawbacks, namely to finish off Starmie and Chansey from a minimum of 33.4% and 37.9%, respectively. However, it is somewhat difficult to fit into its moveset and comes at severe opportunity cost outside of these matchups.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Boasting one of the highest Special stats in the game along with the most powerful special move in OU, Blizzard, there's no denying that Articuno is a powerhouse. OHKOing Golem and Rhydon and 2HKOing Exeggutor are feats few Pokemon can muster, but Blizzard allows Articuno to do just that. It can force switches and deal heavy damage throughout the match, softening up your opponent's team and possibly causing a freeze. It can even make for a very nice end-game sweeper by boosting its mediocre base 85 Speed with Agility and blasting away with its STAB Blizzard, potentially getting a freeze in the process.</p> <p>Why isn't Articuno more common, then? Again, its Speed stat is frustratingly low, as it is not able to outspeed Pokemon like Tauros and Alakazam without a boost, while both are capable of paralyzing Articuno. It is walled to kingdom come by the many OU Pokemon that resist Blizzard, namely Lapras, Starmie, Cloyster, and to an extent, Slowbro, as well as Chansey with its massive 250/105 Special bulk. Its movepool is shallow as well, as it leaves Articuno relying on mediocre Ice / Normal coverage, the latter of which runs off its so-so Attack stat. Other Ice-types such as Lapras and Cloyster are generally preferred, due to access to helpful moves such as Thunderbolt and Explosion respectively. However, they can never dream of matching the raw power of Articuno's Blizzard. All-in-all, if you are looking to unleash a nasty surprise on your opponent, don't overlook Articuno.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>With Articuno's barren yet focused movepool, there are very few other options it can run. Mimic is probably the best unlisted option, as if Articuno gets lucky enough to copy Thunderbolt from Starmie, it will always 2HKO back. Reflect is another option to help Articuno absorb Body Slam from Snorlax and even Rock Slide from Golem and Rhydon should it find itself paralyzed against them. It also helps Articuno win against Tauros, which needs Body Slam critical hits to win. However, it is typically only useful when your opponent's special walls are gone, as they don't care at all whether Reflect is up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Although Articuno's Blizzard is a frosty nuke and no Pokemon enjoys a freeze, there are quite a few solid counters to it. Lapras and Cloyster are some of the best Articuno counters, as they 4x resist Blizzard and can wear it down with any of their attacks. Starmie has to worry about the freeze chance, but can otherwise shrug off all of Articuno's attacks with Recover and threaten it back with any attack of its choosing. Cloyster also 4x resists Blizzard and has a ton of physical bulk, allowing it to absorb any physical attacks that Articuno might be running, then threaten either Articuno or a switch-in with Clamp, Blizzard, or Explosion. Slowbro is also a decent Pokemon to send out against Articuno one-on-one because it can paralyze it with Thunder Wave, but switching in is not recommended because it takes about 50% from two Blizzards before it even has a chance to move.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey is as good a special wall as ever, shrugging off attacks with Soft-Boiled and firing back with Thunderbolt or Seismic Toss. It also takes 37.9 - 44.6% from Hyper Beam, so it has little hope in getting the chance to use Soft-Boiled if its health is low. Alakazam can also use Thunder Wave, Recover off any damage, and spam Psychic until Articuno eventually faints, but it is 3HKOed by Blizzard, meaning it needs to be weary of switching in if paralyzed or weakened.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Though they are far from solid defensive checks to Articuno, Zapdos and Jolteon naturally outspeed it and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, which makes them effective offensive options to take it down if no more defensive options are available.</p>",

          "description": "<p>The best way to get Articuno on the field is to switch it in when you predict that your opponent will switch in Exeggutor; if it has lost over 33% of its health already, Blizzard is a guaranteed KO. It can also switch in on a predicted Earthquake from Snorlax or Tauros, dealing heavy damage with Blizzard and hopefully causing a freeze. Rhydon and Golem are a bit harder to switch in on, as Rock Slide will KO Articuno, but if you are fortunate enough to switch in on Earthquake, Blizzard will OHKO either. Double-Edge does chip damage to Lapras, who laughs at a 4x resisted Blizzard, as well as Starmie. Don't use Double-Edge against Chansey though, as it only does 5% more than Blizzard, causes recoil, and does not have a freeze chance. Don't use Agility until the late-game, when the remains of your opponent's team are within KO range. Finally, Hyper Beam is there to finish off weakened Chansey and Alakazam.</p> <p>Ice Beam is a viable alternative over Double-Edge for a 99.6% accurate STAB, but it is significantly weaker than Blizzard and further weakens Articuno against Lapras and Starmie. Rest is great for recovering from status, allowing Articuno to act as a status sponge throughout the battle until you need it again. Another interesting option Articuno has is Sky Attack, which is its most powerful physical attack, possessing a huge 210 Base Power after STAB. With a critical hit, it is guaranteed to OHKO Chansey and has a 52% chance to OHKO Starmie; without a critical hit, it has a 46% chance to OHKO Alakazam, who would normally be 3HKOed by Blizzard. However, it forces you to lose an entire turn and is difficult to find a slot for.</p>"

Its great bulk makes it especially good at spreading paralysis against common leads and threats like Tauros, Mew, and Mewtwo. Its good critical hit rate and good STAB options are also valuable in order to threaten important Pokemon like Mew, Chansey, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Starmie. However, in a metagame filled with strong attackers, Zapdos find trouble switching in safely, as it is sensitive to Ice-type attacks, which are extremely common, and it lacks recovery. It has little to no chance to beat Ground-types, like Rhydon, Golem, and Sandslash; thus, it absolutely needs its teammates to patch this weakness.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reflect could be used to better deal with Mew, but Zapdos has no room to use it without sacrificing important moves like Thunder Wave or Agility. Moreover, a paralyzed Mew is put under pressure by Zapdos, and it will want to switch out anyway unless it is already set up at +6. Carving a similar niche, Light Screen can buy time against special attackers like Chansey, Slowbro and a paralyzed Mewtwo. Rest could be a good idea to recover some HP, but similarly to Reflect and Light Screen, it's at the cost of a crucial move, and Zapdos will have little to no room to wake up, as it can't switch in against most attackers. A sleeping Zapdos is also a free opportunity for Mewtwo and Mew to switch in and set up, making it setup fodder for the most important sweepers of the tier. Thunder could be used, because its higher Base Power lets Zapdos KO Tauros after a Thunderbolt, and Thunder can KO Mewtwo with two consecutive critical hits. However, it's a very unreliable strategy due to Thunder's low accuracy. Flash is an option that annoys a lot of paralyzed threat, such as Mewtwo, Mew, and Chansey, and comes in handy once there's only one remaining Pokemon. However, its low accuracy and the lack of room on Zapdos's moveset makes it an unreliable choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Zapdos has no way to deal with Rhydon and Golem. Both can use Zapdos to either set up a Substitute or use Body Slam on the switch and try to paralyze it. While it's way more uncommon and it does not resist Drill Peck, Sandslash can also be an issue, as it can freely switch in on Zapdos's Electric-type moves and poses a threat if Zapdos is paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Not only is Zapdos unable to 3HKO Mewtwo even with a critical hit, but Mewtwo can also use Zapdos as setup fodder with Amnesia and threaten it with Psychic and Ice Beam. Zapdos is also very sensitive to Pokemon like Alakazam, Gengar, Jolteon, and Tauros, which can all threaten it severely with either paralysis or sleep. Mewtwo should take care however, as it cannot paralyze Zapdos with Thunderbolt, and once it is itself paralyzed, physical wallbreakers like Mew, Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon can take advantage of its reduced Speed to put it under pressure with Explosion, Self-Destruct, or Stomp. Paralysis also hinders Zapdos severely if it doesn't have Agility, as slower Pokemon like Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Chansey can threaten it far more easily.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks</strong>: While they can't switch in on Zapdos's STAB moves, Jynx and Cloyster both 2HKO Zapdos with STAB Blizzard and prevent it from switching in. However, they are both likely to use Rest once they have been weakened, so Zapdos can use this opportunity to switch in safely. Zapdos also fears Ice Beam from threats it is supposed to deal with, such as Chansey, Mewtwo, and Slowbro, which all deal massive damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can shrug off a lot of Zapdos's attacks thanks to its high Special Defense and Soft-Boiled and can cripple it with paralysis or sleep. However, it cannot infinitely switch into Zapdos's attacks due to Drill Peck's high damage output and critical hit chance.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Drill Peck are Zapdos's best STAB options, and they are difficult to switch into thanks to Zapdos's high Speed, granting it a good critical hit rate. In particular, Zapdos easily 2HKO Water-types like Slowbro and Starmie, and has a chance to OHKO Cloyster with Thunderbolt. It has a 54.5% chance to 2HKO non-Reflect Chansey with one critical hit Drill Peck and a solid chance to KO Exeggutor with a critical hit after slight chip damage. It also has a possible 3HKO against Mew and Snorlax, which becomes guaranteed if it critically hits one Thunderbolt. Thunder Wave is an excellent tool to hobble most threats, and lets Zapdos spam its STAB moves even more. Paralysis also provides excellent support to teammates such as Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax. Agility suppresses the Speed drop from paralysis and lets Zapdos outrun the entire metagame, including Mewtwo and Alakazam. Against a paralyzed threat like Mew and Mewtwo, Agility also reapplies paralysis's Speed drop, helping slow teammates like paralyzed Snorlax to menace them. Hyper Beam can be used instead to beat Chansey and Jynx that would like to force Zapdos out; Chansey is left in KO range of Hyper Beam after a critical hit Drill Peck, and Zapdos has a 88.89% chance to KO Jynx with Drill Peck followed by Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Zapdos is usually seen as a mid- to late-game wallbreaker thanks to its ability to spread paralysis against staples like Tauros, Chansey, and Mewtwo. Its high critical hit rate and high offensive stats also make Zapdos very good at pressuring paralyzed foes; for example, spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave on predicted switch-ins is especially useful against Chansey, as it is one of the most common switch-ins to Zapdos, but critical hits, full paralysis chances, and low damage output from Chansey grant Zapdos far more chances to win the duel. Moreover, typical status absorbers like Starmie and Chansey cannot handle Zapdos very well; thanks to its sheer power and STAB moves, it can take advantage of them as well as Rest users such as Slowbro. This is essential because Zapdos has no way to recover its HP, so each hit it takes is permanent. The pressure Zapdos puts on the enemy team thanks to its high damage output and ability to spread paralysis can force fairly predictable switch-ins like Rhydon, Golem, Snorlax, or a paralyzed Pokemon, which can be punished by teammates like Mewtwo, Exeggutor, Mew, and Tauros. Paralyzing Mewtwo with Thunder Wave can also be a strategy to break it when Zapdos is paired with physical wallbreakers like Mew, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Stomp Tauros. Gengar is a notable teammate, as it synergizes well with Zapdos; as a lead, Gengar can switch into Zapdos to scout moves from Tauros. Zapdos can then proceed to threaten it with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave. As a pair, they can also wall most Reflect + Swords Dance variants of Mew, as Gengar and Zapdos are respectively immune to Normal- and Ground-type attacks. With their respective immunities, Gengar and Zapdos can even play around Earthquake + Body Slam Mew to some degree, forcing it to predict correctly and threatening it with a status, whether it be Zapdos's paralysis or Gengar's sleep. Earthquake + Explosion Mew is hindered to an even more extreme degree, as it forces Mew to switch out or to try to trade with Explosion, allowing more space for powerful sweepers like Mewtwo and Mew.</p> <p>Zapdos can also be used as lead. Its Speed lets it outrun Jynx, while Thunder Wave and its STAB combination lets it threaten most common leads, including Chansey, Tauros, and Alakazam. It's important to notice that Drill Peck can never OHKO Jynx even with a critical hit, and that Gengar is a faster lead, meaning Zapdos can be put to sleep easily by these two threats via Lovely Kiss and Hypnosis, respectively. Hyper Beam is a good option for this set, as Drill Peck + Hyper Beam has a strong chance to KO Jynx, and a critical hit Drill Peck + Hyper Beam will always KO Chansey—both Jynx and Chansey are likely to stay in on Zapdos to put it to sleep.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Zapdos is without a doubt the best Electric-type in the metagame thanks to its high stats and two powerful moves in Thunderbolt and Drill Peck. It is an incredible late-game sweeper, being a mixed attacker on top of having access to Agility. However, Rhydon and Golem hinder Zapdos's effectiveness. While they do take slight chip damage from Drill Peck, they can't be hit by any of Zapdos's other moves and must be dealt with by the rest of the team. Due to this, Zapdos generally requires minor support to work effectively in all matchups, keeping it from being considered one of the best Pokemon in the metagame.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rest is an option for Zapdos to get some HP back, but you'll rarely ever get the chance to use it. Generally, Zapdos should be attacking or use Thunder Wave anyway; there's not a lot of room to put it on the set, as you lose out on either a pivotal attack, the ability to consistently paralyze opposing Pokemon, or the ability to pull off a late-game sweep. Thunder is usable to OHKO Starmie and to 2HKO Tauros and Slowbro, but it is not as used due to its poor accuracy. Toxic is a nice option in order to pressure the Rock-types, but this is generally not worth using over other moves. Final options for Zapdos are Reflect and Light Screen. Generally you would choose one over the other and replace Agility. Having Reflect or Light Screen up mid-game can be incredibly useful; however, due to Zapdos's lack of recovery without Rest, which is already noted to be unreliable, this option is generally not favored. The combination of Rest and Reflect can also be good at letting Zapdos check the Rock-type Pokemon that it usually loses to, but it risks taking a potential critical hit from Rock Slide.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: The Ground-types of the metagame, Rhydon and Golem, are Zapdos's biggest threats to deal with. They soak up any attack Zapdos has to offer, which forces you to play around them before Zapdos can be effective. One can scout early-game for these Pokemon, but if you spend the whole game trying to play around them, you may find yourself in a pickle by late-game.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Jolteon can also make good checks to Zapdos, although unlike the above Ground-types, they are susceptible to Thunder Wave. Jolteon would preferably use Rest to better check Zapdos, but ones without Rest work as well. Zapdos itself gets a special mention because it can come in on a Drill Peck to create an even matchup. Despite this, it is still worse than Jolteon as a check, as it is neutral to Thunderbolt damage which should be noted is unable to paralyze Electric-types making it a bit harder for Zapdos to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can act as a good check to Zapdos thanks to its high Special Defense and access to Reflect, but it is generally unfavorable as a check due to the tendency of Drill Peck landing a critical hit.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Drill Peck are Zapdos's STAB moves. Zapdos hits most targets for strong damage, comfortably 3HKOing Tauros and threatening 3HKOs on Snorlax and Alakazam. However, it should be noted that Thunderbolt cannot paralyze other Electric-types. Drill Peck hits two of the main Pokemon that tank Thunderbolt, Exeggutor and Chansey. Exeggutor is sometimes 2HKOed by Drill Peck, and while Chansey can take two Drill Pecks comfortably, it tends to lose to repeated Drill Pecks, as it can't hit Zapdos very hard, and a single critical hit or full paralysis tends to end the fight in Zapdos's favor. However, Chansey does have access to Reflect to increase its chances of winning the matchup. Thunder Wave is used to paralyze Pokemon such as Tauros and Chansey to give openings for Zapdos to sweep late-game or get a chance to prevent recovery to get an extra turn of damage. Agility can be used on a free turn to allow Zapdos to outspeed faster threats like Alakazam and Tauros. It can also be used to remove the Speed drop from paralysis, which can allow Zapdos to sweep through Pokemon that would otherwise revenge kill it.</p> <p>In general, you want to keep Zapdos as healthy as possible throughout the match in order to give it sweeping potential. However, this doesn't mean that you should keep it in the back the whole game, as it has a lot of potential to be useful in the early- and mid-game stages. For example, Zapdos can take advantage of sleeping Pokemon such as Snorlax as long as it comes in on the turn the Pokemon uses Rest. One should try to use Zapdos to spread status through Thunder Wave. This is especially helpful to do on a Pokemon like Chansey, which can be prevented from recovering through status, allowing Zapdos to potentially 3HKO with Drill Peck. Early-game, be sure to scout for the Ground-types of the tier, Rhydon and Golem. Do this with Pokemon like Exeggutor, Tauros, Cloyster, and Lapras, which can pressure them through super effective or status moves. Tauros is probably the best example there, as it has a great matchup versus Exeggutor, Snorlax, Chansey, and Tauros, as well as being a great late-game cleaner on top of that. You could also lure them out with Zapdos itself, which can be done fairly early on, putting you at an information advantage. Whether or not you manage to find a Rock-type, though, you should keep Rock-type checks like Exeggutor and Lapras healthy so they better check them if they come out later in the match. Don't use Agility unless most Pokemon on the opposing team are weakened enough for Zapdos to sweep. To give a reference frame, you should probably wait until Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey have about a third of their health left. However, if they Rest, you can take advantage of them earlier.</p>"

    "uu": {
      "overview": "<p>The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Agility + Partial Trapping. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current RBY UU metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Moltres is an unusual Pokemon in RBY UU. It has downright incredible base stats, boasting the second-highest total of any Pokemon outside of Ubers. Its Fire Blast is enormously strong, unsurpassed by any other unboosted special move in the game. Because of these traits, Moltres spent much of its history banned and was considered a top choice once it was finally released to the tier. Given its behemoth offensive prowess and the success its sibling Articuno had, one would be forgiven for assuming Moltres would be a staple in the tier.</p> <p>Moltres, however, is not a staple in RBY UU by any account. The tier is infested with Water-type Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and UU king Tentacruel, which creates a very hostile environment for Moltres. Another major flaw is how heavily Articuno outclasses it. As a special attacker, Moltres is nearly strictly worse than Articuno, as several prominent Pokemon in the tier resist Fire but not Ice; thus, the true strength of Moltres's nuclear Fire Blast is seldom realized. Examples include Dragonite, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Golem. Somewhat humorously, the only major Pokemon that Moltres has an edge against relative to Articuno is Articuno itself. Being a Fire-type Pokemon isn’t doing Moltres any defensive favors either. Articuno has a much better chance at muscling through Water-type checks, as it can endure their attacks while it hunts for a critical hit or freeze. Moltres, on the other hand, will likely get 2HKOed by Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, meaning it is afforded no extra turns to try to get lucky. Failing to resist Ice also leaves it more vulnerable to attackers like Gyarados. Considering the ubiquity of Water-type Pokemon and how everything that checks Articuno also checks Moltres, basically every well composed RBY UU team is incidentally prepared to face Moltres.</p> <p>Moltres is just barely able to scrounge a niche in RBY UU, being able to do one of two things for a team. Firstly, it can be a supplement to Articuno to create a strong special attacking core. Against neutral targets, Moltres's Fire Blast boasts impressive damage output, 2HKOing most neutral targets. Alternatively, Moltres can try to slowly rack up damage and possibly even sweep with AgiliSpin, much like Dragonite with Wrap. While both approaches to Moltres are viable, they have their issues. A Moltres and Articuno core still needs a lot of support, as the two share many checks. Fire Spin Moltres is a suboptimal partial trapper relative to staples like Dragonite due to the move's lower accuracy, PP, and damage output.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>While Moltres is generally best used as an offensive Pokemon, its impressive bulk can allow it to check a few Pokemon, like the tier’s Normal-type attackers. This means Moltres can run defensive options like Rest and Reflect. Toxic gives Moltres a more reliable option for Dragonite and synergizes well with Fire Spin.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon</strong>: Unless they happen to be in KO range of Hyper Beam or Double-Edge, Moltres is almost completely helpless against Water-type Pokemon. Tentacruel outspeeds Moltres and can use Wrap to weaken it or just cleanly 2HKO it with Surf. Vaporeon is slower but can take Moltres’s attacks more comfortably while still scoring a 2HKO. Poliwrath behaves similarly, but it can only potentially 2HKO Moltres if it has Hydro Pump. Thanks to its typing, Omastar is the best counter to Moltres; even if Moltres scores a critical hit with every attack, Omastar can safely use Rest and wall it indefinitely. Omastar will always 2HKO Moltres with Surf as well. Gyarados can take Moltres’s hits fairly comfortably and score a 2HKO with Hydro Pump or a 3HKO with Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon</strong>: Golem takes relatively little from Moltres’s moves. It is very likely to OHKO Moltres with Rock Slide, making Moltres very hesitant to pivot out with Fire Spin; this essentially gives Golem a free turn to use a powerful STAB attack or Substitute. Golem also punishes Hyper Beam exceptionally well, scoring a virtually guaranteed OHKO in response. Aerodactyl doesn’t have many good offensive options for Moltres, but it can take a few hits and apply pressure with Double-Edge, especially if it can land a few critical hits. Neither Golem nor Aerodactyl handles a burn well, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Moltres can, at best, 4HKO Dragonite, but it will likely require even more turns to KO it. Dragonite, on the other hand, can 3HKO with Blizzard, stymie Moltres's offensive ability with Thunder Wave, or attempt to use Agility and sweep with Wrap. Dragonite's ability to sweep is threatened by Fire Blast's burn chance, but Dragonite is still very likely to win the matchup thanks to its wide array of strong special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dugtrio</strong>: Dugtrio has no business switching into Moltres and despises burn, but it survives a Fire Blast and can 2HKO Moltres with Rock Slide. Thanks to its high critical hit rate, Dugtrio is liable to OHKO Moltres as well, making Moltres fearful even if it is at full health and has used Agility.</p>",

        "Special Sweeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Moltres’s Fire Blast ties with Articuno’s Blizzard as the strongest unboosted special move in the tier. While more Pokemon resist Fire Blast than Blizzard, the move still deals massive damage to the right targets; it 3HKOes Hypno and 2HKOes Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, Dugtrio, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Venusaur. Fire Blast actually outperforms Blizzard against a select few — albeit uncommon — Pokemon as well, including Dewgong, Pinsir, and Venomoth. It also comes with a nasty 30.1% chance to burn, which keeps some would-be checks, like Tentacruel and Dragonite, somewhat hesitant to face Moltres. While not quite as lethal as a freeze, a burn can completely incapacitate pretty much every physical attacker outside of Persian. A burn on a partial trapper like Tentacruel can force it to use Rest much earlier than usual, as the passive damage will build up if it tries to use Wrap or Bind. However, due to Fire Blast's poor accuracy and UU's many Water-types, running out of PP is a genuine possibility. Additionally, a single miss can ruin Moltres, as it leaves it vulnerable to being paralyzed or KOed. As such, Moltres must use it wisely.</p> <p>Moltres's surprisingly high Attack stat makes its Hyper Beam and Double-Edge remarkably strong. Because of the extra damage output from its physical attacks, Moltres can use Agility and attempt to sweep even sooner than Articuno in some cases. For example, Tentacruel and Kadabra must be at or below 35% and 65% health, respectively, for Articuno to secure a sweep with Hyper Beam. For Moltres, these Pokemon can be at 38.5% and 72% health. The difference is minor, but it can be important in a metagame where many Pokemon lose health in increments of roughly 3% to Tentacruel’s Wrap.</p> <p>Fire Spin is more versatile than Double-Edge, enabling it to chip weakened foes into KO range of Fire Blast or Hyper Beam. The move can also immobilize, slowly whittle down, and potentially sweep the opposing team, especially if Moltres has managed to use Agility. Fire Spin also gives Moltres an option against Dragonite; it can use the move and switch out to something that can prevent Dragonite from setting up its potentially game-ending Agility. Compared to Dragonite's Wrap, Moltres's Fire Spin has lower accuracy and PP but has the benefit of damaging Haunter. Alternatively, Double-Edge provides Moltres with a consistent attack with perfect accuracy, a lot of PP, and few drawbacks. This greatly aids in Moltres’s sweeping, allowing it to take out weakened targets with little risk. Note that Articuno almost completely outclasses Moltres running Double-Edge, so Articuno should generally be run alongside Moltres if this set is chosen. Essentially, Fire Spin is for sweeping sooner, while Double-Edge is for sweeping reliably. Agility makes Moltres faster than the entire unboosted metagame and therefore less fearful of Pokemon like Tentacruel, Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu while letting it attempt to sweep or wallbreak.</p> <p>Moltres requires quite a lot of support to function. Pokemon that can apply pressure to Water-type Pokemon, such as Electabuzz, Raichu, and Venusaur, are good partners. Physical attackers like Persian and Kangaskhan can also work with Moltres on hyper offense builds. Together, they can form mixed attacking cores that few teams can handle. Users of sleep inducing moves like Hypno, Tangela, and the aforementioned Venusaur provide Moltres with a setup opportunity. If Moltres is being used alongside Articuno, much of the same support is required, though to an even greater extent. Fast Pokemon like Kadabra and Dugtrio are also good partners, as the core is relatively slow and liable to be smothered by Tentacruel.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Moltres stands out as the strongest special attacker in RBY OU, tied with Articuno. It shares a lot of strengths and weaknesses with the other legendary bird: Moltres can also 2HKO Tauros and threaten Snorlax significantly while nailing Exeggutor and having Agility to clean up late-game. However, it too has a hard time breaking through very common special walls such as Starmie and Chansey, which holds it back tremendously. Should these walls be incapacitated or removed, Moltres can wreak havoc and make great use of its titanic Special stat.</p> <p>Due to these shared traits with Articuno, it is worth analyzing where they differ to understand which fits your team best. Moltres has access to Fire Spin in tandem with higher Attack, giving it a stronger Hyper Beam. These two qualities allow Moltres to muscle through checks like Starmie and Chansey more effectively than Articuno, especially when these Pokemon have been paralyzed and chipped beforehand. Moltres also possesses no hard walls: while Articuno really struggles against Lapras and Cloyster, there aren't any Pokemon that shut down Moltres quite so hard. However, Moltres's lower physical bulk and a weakness to Ice make it considerably easier to take down. Additionally, the type chart is unkind to Fire-type attacks in RBY, making Moltres considerably weaker in various matchups compared to Articuno, such as Zapdos and especially Rhydon. Furthermore, Fire Spin's accuracy makes it very unreliable; Fire Blast also suffers from this problem to a lesser degree. Overall, Moltres is a phenomenal late-game threat, despite being niche overall, as the ability to beat Tauros one-on-one is of crucial importance; while supporting it can be difficult, this Pokemon remains a sweeping threat that can tear down passive builds.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Moltres possesses a few other viable moves, but they are all hard to justify in most cases. Double-Edge gives it a strong move to hit Chansey on the switch, and to a lesser extent Starmie, which might make its job of taking down these checks a little easier, though you will usually be content to source your extra damage from an additional Fire Spin. Sky Attack hits for over 50% on both Starmie and Chansey, threatening to OHKO on a critical hit, but it requires good prediction to get away with the charge turn. Toxic allows Moltres to functionally empower its own Fire Spin without needing to land a Fire Blast burn, which helps with working around Chansey as long as Moltres can chain enough Fire Spins without missing.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Starmie and Slowbro stop Moltres dead in its tracks thanks to their great special bulk and lack of concern for burns, which allows them to switch into Fire Blast frequently. Starmie is particularly brutal, being faster and threatening hefty damage with any of Blizzard, Thunderbolt, or Surf, or even paralysis from Thunder Wave. Slowbro can use Moltres as setup fodder after paralyzing it, usually forcing it to try and pivot out with Fire Spin as to not give it a free Amnesia boost, though it needs to be wary when burned, as Fire Spin chains can rapidly rack up sufficient residual damage for Moltres to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can put a hard stop to Moltres thanks to its gargantuan Special bulk; however, Moltres outspeeds it and can therefore stop it from recovering with Fire Spin. Therefore, it can muscle through Chansey with some luck, especially with a Fire Blast burn alongside Fire Spin, as Hyper Beam hits for over 40%. However, this can be quite risky for Moltres, as a miss lets Chansey cripple its late-game with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: While neither is particularly willing to take a Fire Blast, both Jolteon and Zapdos outspeed Moltres while 2HKOing it with STAB Thunderbolt. However, Moltres can beat a chipped or resting Jolteon, having a good shot at 2HKOing it with Fire Blast + Hyper Beam.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: While it looks enticing to switch Rhydon in on Fire Blast, its pathetic Special makes it take surprisingly high damage; there is even a chance of a 3HKO. Additionally, being burned is an utter death sentence for Rhydon, making it little more than fodder in the long run. However, Rhydon is otherwise one of the better Moltres checks, absorbing Hyper Beam well and PP stalling Fire Spin better than most OU staples, all while having an OHKO against it in Rock Slide; if it drops Rock Slide in favor of Rest, it gives up the OHKO, but it gains the ability to heal off the burns and can stall Moltres out of Fire Blasts, which is just as good.</p>",

          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Fire Blast is the main draw to Moltres. It threatens significant damage to a majority of the tier, including notable 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Cloyster, and has a nice 30.1% burn chance that forces sturdier physical attackers such as Snorlax and Rhydon to tread very carefully around Moltres. However, much like most special attackers in RBY OU, it must contend with the existence of Chansey and Starmie. These two Pokemon can comfortably heal off all damage taken by Fire Blast, and due to Fire Blast only having 8 PP, Moltres usually doesn't want to waste any on Pokemon that can just shrug it off; furthermore, landing a burn on these Pokemon can sometimes be counterproductive, as it removes the option of paralyzing them. Moltres packs a relatively powerful Hyper Beam to help it deal with special walls, thankfully; in tandem with a Fire Blast, it can hit both Chansey and Starmie for over 60% of their HP over two turns, meaning that, if such walls have been weakened, it stands a good chance of finishing the job. Agility is extremely helpful to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis and gain the upper hand on other fast late-game Pokemon such as Tauros and Zapdos; it is especially powerful in combination with Fire Spin, as a fast partial trapping move completely shuts down the opponent's ability to attack as long as it doesn't miss. Fire Spin excels when the opposition has been statused; it has great synergy with paralysis, which enables Moltres to move faster than any foe even without setting up Agility, and with burn, as repeatedly stopping the foe from moving racks up burn damage.</p> <p>Moltres's specialty is cleanup. If you are running Moltres, you ought to spend the early-game trying to cripple, chip, and potentially even remove the opposing Chansey and Starmie. Moltres is very unconventional in that it doesn't synergize particularly well with the two most powerful statuses in RBY, freeze and sleep. Fire Blast will thaw frozen opponents, and Fire Spin provides sleeping enemies with opportunities to wake while only taking minimal damage per turn. This means Moltres needs a very deliberate plan early-game and beyond to weaken checks and make your opponent play into your hand, especially against Starmie. Many teams are willing to let Starmie absorb sleep early-game, which is great for other Pokemon that struggle with it, like Articuno and Slowbro, but Moltres's resisted Fire Spin is the perfect opportunity for Starmie to burn sleep turns. You might want to try luring your opponent into letting you sleep a different Pokemon, even forgoing sleep altogether if you are feeling creative, or hoping sleeping Starmie falls victim to players' willingness to sacrifice sleeping Pokemon. Similarly, it won't be much use gambling your early-game trying to freeze a Chansey.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Moltres is a fearsome threat in RBY NU, with significant bulk, the tier's most powerful special attack in Fire Blast, and a decent Speed tier that ties Mr. Mime, Poliwhirl, and Venomoth. Moltres 2HKOes notable threats such as Mr. Mime and Nidoking, OHKOes Venomoth 74% of the time, and OHKOes Exeggcute, and it deals a significant chunk to most resistant switch-ins such as Golem and Water-types—barring Kabutops—while threatening to burn them. Fire Spin allows Moltres to chip down and pivot around its checks, Hyper Beam finishes off Fire-resistant threats, and various utility moves such as Reflect, Toxic, and Agility enable it to take on different roles, walling certain threats or sweeping late-game. Defensively, it brings Earthquake immunity and enough bulk to avoid a 3HKO from neutral attacks; even Charizard's Slash is a 4HKO, leaving Swords Dance-less sets unable to break Moltres.</p> <p>Despite its legendary status, Moltres suffers from the ubiquity of the pedestrian Fire / Flying type in Charizard, which can set up on standard Moltres freely. It's also hindered by the prevalence of teams stacking Fire- and Water-types, which leave it with few opportunities to truly unleash its Fire Blast. Fire / Flying is a flawed type combination, suffering greatly against Rock Slide and carrying common weakness; even if Moltres often avoids 2HKOs from Blizzard, Thunderbolt, and Surf, it'd rather not be weak to them at all. Fire Blast and Hyper Beam are Moltres's only real, strong attack options; both are just inaccurate enough to make it inconsistent and punishable. Utilizing Moltres means running a second Fire / Flying type alongside Charizard in a metagame full of Water- and Rock-types, and one where super effective moves abound. Despite this, its sheer stat total gives it a place on many teams as a terrifying damage dealer, bulky roadblock, or endgame sweeper.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Moltres generally lacks other move options. Although Fire Blast can't be dropped, one can combine its other moves in varying ways to meet different threats, such as running Hyper Beam on a Rest set. Double-Edge is an option, providing far more PP than Fire Blast or Hyper Beam, but fails to outdamage Fire Blast even on Fire-resistant targets, while Sky Attack's charge time is easy to maneuver around.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Charizard</strong>: Charizard outspeeds Moltres and sets up Swords Dance freely, taking little from Fire Blast or Hyper Beam while 4HKOing with Slash or boosting up and KOing with +6 Hyper Beam. Moltres has counterplay in the form of Toxic + Reflect, which allows it to tank any Charizard set. Toxic whittles Charizard down, but running Toxic sacrifices valuable utility elsewhere and renders Charizard immune to paralysis, allowing it to simply switch out and return later.</p> <p><strong>Kabutops</strong>: Fire Blast might as well be Ember to Kabutops, and it resists Hyper Beam too, rendering Moltres entirely ineffective. It threatens to set up Swords Dance or retaliate with a number of 3HKO options, including Surf, Blizzard, Slash, and Hyper Beam, and it essentially ignores burn. While Moltres outspeeds it and can use Fire Spin to pivot out, a miss will be punished to the tune of 30-40% of Moltres's HP.</p> <p><strong>Golem</strong>: Golem takes Fire Blast easily, only having a 14% chance to be 3HKOed, and threatens to OHKO in return with Rock Slide 92% of the time. However, a burn significantly hampers Golem, so it must carefully consider the risk, especially if other options such as Water-types are available. If Moltres manages to apply burn, it can even freely set up Agility to reapply the burn Attack drop, making Golem's Rock Slide barely 4HKO.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Blastoise takes Fire Blast well; Moltres needs to land three Fire Blasts and Hyper Beam to 4HKO, potentially missing in the process, while Blastoise is able to 3HKO with Surf. Less specially bulky options like Seadra and Kingler can check Moltres in a pinch, being 4HKOed and 3HKOed by Fire Blast while 2HKOing with their STAB options in return. However, they want to come in against a weakened Moltres due to their lower Speed and relative frailty. Poliwhirl takes quite a bit from Fire Blast normally, being 3HKOed like most other Water-types, but threatens the moves Hypnosis and Amnesia; this allows it to barricade Moltres almost as well as Kabutops while threatening significantly more damage in return, dealing minimum 77% with Hydro Pump at +2. Moltres gains little from winning the Speed tie.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: A paralyzed Moltres becomes much easier to handle, outsped by its checks and less likely to land already inconsistent moves such as Fire Blast. Paralysis also creates many revenge killers such as Nidoking, Clefable, and Mr. Mime. While Moltres often runs Agility and can counteract the Speed loss, this does not prevent full paralysis from inhibiting its reliability.</p> <p><strong>Arcanine</strong>: While uncommon in the modern metagame, Arcanine is uniquely able to wall Moltres. Not only does it outrun Moltres, but it also shrugs off any move and can retaliate with Body Slam and Hyper Beam, targeting Moltres's weaker Defense and threatening paralysis. However, Rest Moltres sets can engage in a stall war with Arcanine, and Toxic sets often win in the long term as well.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>This set leans on Moltres's huge damage output. Because NU tends to be fast-paced and lacking in recovery, nothing but Kabutops switches fearlessly into Fire Blast. A single hit leaves a number of foes in precarious positions. It puts Mr. Mime in KO range for Charizard's Hyper Beam and usually its Fire Blast, leaves Golem unable to safely switch into Charizard's Earthquake or Mr. Mime's Psychic, and leaves Poliwhirl in range of Mr. Mime's Thunderbolt, to name a few examples. Hyper Beam lets Moltres finish off Water-types after repeatedly taking Fire Blast, notably dealing 42% minimum to Poliwhirl and 35% minimum to Seadra; this damage can add consistency in securing KOs and allows a 3HKO on Seadra if Fire Blast burns. Fire Spin lets Moltres pivot out of threats such as Golem and Water-types and can provide crucial chip damage on a foe that is just out of Fire Blast range.</p> <p>The final moveslot allows Moltres to either threaten a sweep and shrug off paralysis via Agility, or create a headache for Charizard with Toxic; it can use Toxic plus Fire Spin to force Charizard to switch out rather than setting up, though this combination has dubious accuracy. Agility Moltres can also easily be saved for a late-game sweep, with teammates removing threats that can trade with or beat Moltres such as Water-types and Charizard. Then, Moltres can set up and potentially end the game, utilizing Fire Spin if necessary to earn crucial chip damage, though this is always risky.</p> <p>Moltres benefits from teammates that can cover its weaknesses; Blastoise matches up well against Fire- and Water-types, and Golem comes in on Fire-types that would otherwise exploit Moltres's poor coverage. Electrode is an offbeat option to exploit Water-types but leaves the team especially Golem-weak. Moltres also benefits from Mr. Mime and Clefable, which should be on every team, as both can typically remove key threats such as themselves or Kabutops.</p>"

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Defensive Moltres can annoy and weaken various threats that handle its offensive set well. Toxic wears down foes hoping to set up such as Charizard and Kabutops, especially in combination with Fire Spin, which wastes their turns as Toxic damage ramps up. However, remember that Toxic has 84.4% accuracy and Fire Spin has a horrid 69.5% accuracy, and this fast-paced metagame heavily punishes misses. Even without Toxic, Fire Spin still allows Moltres to harass burned foes or pivot out of threats. If running Toxic, Reflect is an option to stall out Charizard; Slash is only a 4HKO, and Hyper Beam does not 2HKO until Charizard boosts to +6. This means that Charizard has to spend several turns setting up followed by several turns to KO, usually forcing Charizard to switch out instead. This does not work against Kabutops, as Surf is a guaranteed 3HKO. Reflect additionally has utility in slowing down Nidoking and Raticate if set up in advance, though Nidoking can still 3HKO with Blizzard and Raticate can break through with Super Fang and critical hit Body Slam or Hyper Beam. Rest, of course, provides Moltres with recovery, though it is hard to wake Moltres up against most of the tier; it can attempt to do so against Charizard without Swords Dance, Clefable without Blizzard, Venomoth, Moltres, and the occasional Ninetales and Porygon, and it can switch in on Charizard's Earthquake, Fire Spin, and various Thunder Wave users.</p> <p>Moltres can enable double switches to catch foes as they attempt to switch into its Rest, getting Kabutops or Blastoise against Golem or Charizard. Reflect sets additionally benefit from setting up a Moltres versus Charizard endgame, surprising the opponent with an unexpectedly bulky Moltres as Toxic racks up damage; to this end, allies that are effective at trading one-for-one such as Nidoking, Golem, and Blastoise are beneficial.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Dragonair is a versatile support Pokemon in PU that carries a unique defensive typing, a wide array of coverage moves, powerful utility in Thunder Wave and Wrap, and the ever-present threat of AgiliWrap. While it's outclassed as a support Pokemon by Drowzee and Porygon and outclassed as a damage dealer by anything with a good STAB move, its sheer versatility allows it to surprise foes and force them to accept paralysis or chip damage on Pokemon they may have preferred to save for later. Dragonair's base 70 Speed notably puts it ahead of Seaking, allowing it to wear down Seaking with Wrap. This also enables it to check slower foes like Drowzee and Porygon as well as paralyzed foes, forcing paralysis onto the opposing team or forcing in Nidoqueen to scare out Dragonair, as other Ground-types are too slow to do so. Notably, Dragonair's Dragon typing allows it to resist Fire Blast, Surf, and Thunderbolt, making it an excellent pivot and a huge threat to Fire-types as well as Water-types that don't carry Blizzard, allowing it to check Rapidash, Arcanine, and often Staryu. Dragonair can carry super effective coverage for these foes in return, 3HKOing the Fire-types and 2HKOing Staryu; it can also paralyze them and potentially use Wrap to chip them down if it avoids paralysis itself.</p> <p>Dragonair has several flaws that hold it back, including its relative frailty, middling Speed, and Ice weakness. It also has some difficulties with prediction, as using Thunder Wave as Nidoqueen comes in can be a disastrous loss of momentum. Nidoqueen outspeeds Dragonair and threatens it immensely, so Dragonair is usually forced out if it hasn't already set up Agility. Gastly also stonewalls Wrap and forces Dragonair to fight it with relatively weak special moves, but it's heavily threatened by Thunder Wave, which leaves it vulnerable to Earthquake users later in the game. Dragonair's typing provides no STAB, making its damage output poor against neutral targets such as Gastly and Porygon as well as rare foes like Pinsir and Machamp. Paralysis also holds Dragonair back significantly, limiting Wrap and forcing it to trade hits with stronger, bulkier foes; this makes it hard to fight fast Thunder Wave users like Staryu and even Abra. Finally, Dragonair is extremely limited in moveslots; it wants all of Agility, Thunder Wave, Wrap, and several coverage attacks, but it can only either fit all of the utility moves and a single attack, or it can fit two attacks at the cost of Agility or Thunder Wave.</p>",
      "comments": "<h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Agility can be dropped to fit an additional coverage move, but this sacrifices a lot of potential chip damage and utility, so it should not be done lightly. Hyper Beam has a small chance to OHKO Abra and deals high damage to Staryu and Drowzee, but Thunderbolt already covers Staryu, and none of these three take Wrap hits well. This also leaves Dragonair even more helpless against Gastly and risks a recharge turn if used recklessly. Fire Blast 2HKOes Pinsir, but this is too niche of a matchup to cover over others, and both Thunderbolt and Blizzard already cover Scyther, a more relevant threat.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Gastly</strong>: Gastly outspeeds Dragonair, takes no damage from Wrap, and takes little damage from Dragonair's attacks, allowing it to interrupt Dragonair with Hypnosis. However, Dragonair is often content with landing Thunder Wave on it to make it fodder for teammates like Nidoqueen, and it can use Wrap to pivot out and bring in allies that handle Gastly better, making it risky for Gastly to stay in and blockade Wrap. Dragonair lacking Thunder Wave is utterly helpless, however, and relies on teammates to bait out and remove Gastly first.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis severely hampers Dragonair, making Wrap horribly inconsistent and limiting it to setting up Agility and scoring some chip damage. This is not completely horrible in matchups where Dragonair has super effective coverage, but when it doesn't, it contributes very little damage before falling.</p> <p><strong>Burn</strong>: A burn heavily limits Dragonair by making Wrap a losing proposition, forcing it to simply look for paralysis and chip damage from its special attacks before it falls.</p> <p><strong>Nidoqueen</strong>: The near-omnipresent Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Dragonair while being immune to Thunder Wave; even Blizzard, Dragonair's strongest option against Nidoqueen, rarely 2HKOes it. Dragonair can potentially set up Agility against it, but Blizzard leaves it in range of many attacks should it miss one Wrap.</p> <p><strong>Blizzard Users</strong>: Staryu rarely runs Blizzard, but it threatens paralysis to stop any Agility plays and can then 2HKO Dragonair if packing Blizzard. Seaking and the rare Omanyte can also punish Wrap misses with Blizzard for massive damage.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Fearow, Scyther, and the rare Pinsir outspeed and can 2HKO Dragonair, making setup costly, as one Wrap miss ends Dragonair's rampage. Pinsir is also not weak to any of Dragonair's common moves.</p>",

          "description": "<h5>Set Description</h5> <p>Dragonair's moveset is incredibly diverse, but all Dragonair sets tend to focus on supporting its team via chip damage and paralysis. To this end, Dragonair nearly always runs Wrap, which helps to chip down foes, pivot teammates in safely, and forces paralyzed foes to switch out, preventing them from blocking Thunder Wave. Agility should be on most Dragonair sets, making all of its moves far more threatening; after Agility, it outspeeds the entire tier, allowing it to inflict a fearsome amount of chip damage with Wrap and win one-on-one against a variety of threatening foes even without Wrap, including Arcanine, Rapidash, and Fearow. This also partially insulates Dragonair against paralysis, allowing it to cancel the Speed drop and threaten foes with paralysis and super effective coverage. Dragonair usually runs Thunder Wave to spread status, allowing it to disable and use Wrap against faster foes without reliable ways to inflict paralysis, such as Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow. It may also choose to sacrifice itself in certain scenarios to paralyze a threat like Staryu or Agility Porygon, allowing teammates to more easily remove them. Agility synergizes surprisingly well with Thunder Wave, allowing Dragonair to present more of a threat and force in foes that would rather not take paralysis, like Gastly and Staryu, to try to slow them down with status. It also allows Dragonair to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis to foes with Agility. Surf is the attacking move of choice for Dragonair using Thunder Wave, as its combination of PP and coverage fits well with speed control and Wrap. Surf 3HKOes Arcanine, Rapidash, Magmar, and Nidoqueen; OHKOes Graveler; and deals decent damage to most targets. Anything that can handle Surf bar Gastly is unlikely to enjoy taking repeated Wrap hits. Thunderbolt can be substituted over Thunder Wave to improve Dragonair's coverage, 2HKOing Staryu, usually 2HKOing Fearow after Double-Edge recoil, and 3HKOing Seaking. Blizzard is an uncommon option that helps Dragonair do more damage to Nidoqueen and Fearow as well as covering for less common foes like opposing Dragonair and Vileplume, but this costs it super effective coverage against the highly threatening Fire-types and adds little compared to Surf or Thunderbolt.</p> <p>When running only one attack, this set often works as an anti-lead to the common Arcanine, threatening to paralyze it and use Wrap to force it out as well as threatening Agility should Arcanine try to pivot to Nidoqueen to block Thunder Wave. In this role, Dragonair is a sacrificial Pokemon looking to spread paralysis and chip damage, particularly to Gastly, to allow teammates to follow up against neutered foes. Surf helps Dragonair to fight common leads like Arcanine and Nidoqueen, and Dragonair happily trades Thunder Wave with Staryu and Porygon should they attempt to stop it. Once it paralyzes these foes, they become fodder for slower attackers that would otherwise struggle, such as Nidoqueen and Seaking. Agility helps to force Gastly to block Wrap, allowing Dragonair to paralyze it and either take sleep, or, with a 47% chance, dodge Hypnosis and use Wrap to pivot out while denying sleep. In this role, Dragonair benefits heavily from teaming up with Nidoqueen, which OHKOes Gastly and 2HKOes Staryu but struggles against them due to their superior Speed and super effective moves. It is also effective at enabling allies like Agility Porygon, Seaking, and Scyther by paralyzing and wearing down foes that would otherwise give them trouble.</p> <p>Dragonair run outside of the lead more commonly have two attacks for coverage, most often forgoing Thunder Wave to act as a scary Agility sweeper that can soften up entire teams for its allies or even win outright. In this role, Dragonair seeks to set up against a foe without a consistent way to paralyze it—such as a Fire-type, non-Blizzard Seaking, or even Nidoqueen— and use Wrap to wear foes down. The biggest benefit of expanded coverage is that Dragonair can punish the use of chipped Pokemon to tank Wrap; on a Wrap miss, it can punish with an attack, which is especially deadly against frail foes like Fearow and Staryu. In this role, Dragonair works well with allied sweepers and cleaners that need slight damage to enable them. For example, Scyther comes just shy of OHKOing a number of foes at +2, and a few hits from Wrap easily make up the difference. Similarly, moderate chip damage helps enable allies like Rapidash and Fearow to clean through entire teams. However, this Dragonair lacks Thunder Wave and therefore makes for a poor enabler for slower allies like Nidoqueen that might appreciate paralysis more than chip damage.</p>"

Dragonair's unique mono-Dragon typing gives it useful resistances to Water- and Electric-type attacks. However, Dragonair's base stats are atrocious; it barely threatens anything offensively and is 2HKOed or 3HKOed by most neutral hits. Its weakness to Ice-type attacks also exacerbates Wrap teams' weaknesses to Ice-type attacks even further. Dragonair is also extremely hard to fit on teams; even dedicated Wrap teams usually only include Dragonite and Victreebel, as these teams are more reliable than teams with three or four Wrap users, which are the teams Dragonair fits on.</p>",

Wrap allows Dragonair to force paralysis past slower common paralysis absorbers, such as Chansey. It also allows Dragonair to pivot out of uncomfortable situations to one of its teammates safely. Blizzard is Dragonair's most versatile coverage move; it hits Flying- and Grass-types such as Zapdos and Exeggutor for super effective damage, as well as 2HKOing Rhydon. Blizzard is also Dragonair's best option to finish off weakened foes. Thunderbolt is Dragonair's strongest move against Water-types, 3HKOing Cloyster and Starmie. Hyper Beam allows Dragonair to meaningfully threaten and finish off physically frailer foes such Chansey and Alakazam, doing 37.4% minimum to the former and 48.2% minimum to the latter. Agility can be used in favor of a secondary coverage move, as it allows Dragonair to spread chip and paralysis across the opposing team and not just become a useless sacrifice after it becomes paralyzed. Dragonair can also use Agility against foes that do not carry paralysis-afflicting moves, such as Rhydon.</p> <p>Dragonair wants to be used early-game to get paralysis off on faster threats as soon as possible, as the Wrap teams it fits on live and die by their ability to paralyze these foes. Dragonair can hit the field safely either by being pivoted in on Wrap from one of its teammates or by coming in after one of its teammates has been KOed. It can also switch in on a predicted Recover. After Dragonair becomes paralyzed, if it lacks Agility, the best use for it is to enable its other, more powerful Wrap teammates by being used as a sacrifice or a pivot.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Dragonair is a niche threat in NU buoyed by a single, oft-maligned move: Wrap. Combined with Agility and Thunder Wave, Dragonair has the speed control necessary to spam Wrap, wearing down an entire team for allies like Charizard, Mr. Mime, and Raticate to finish off. It can also use Wrap to bully the opponent into accepting paralysis on more Pokemon, chipping down paralyzed foes that try to block Thunder Wave. It supplements this with excellent coverage to finish off weakened foes if they switch in as Wrap misses, forcing the opponent to accept a KO or switch into moves like Blizzard and Thunderbolt. While Dragonair is relatively frail, it does have an excellent defensive typing. It resists the tier's many Fire-, Water, and Electric-type attacks, and only Clefable, Nidoking, and Seadra typically run Ice-type coverage, though Blastoise sometimes does as well.</p> <p>Dragonair is, however, held back by its relatively poor Speed, need for a setup turn to paralyze the foe or use Agility, and Wrap's tenuous accuracy. Its Speed falls short of threats like Nidoking and Seadra, which both run Blizzard and can 2HKO it; additionally, if not using Agility, Dragonair is incapable of outspeeding Nidoking to use Wrap on it without paralysis support from allies. Opposing paralysis spreaders like Mr. Mime and Venomoth outspeed Dragonair, and Dragonair is also slower than Kingler and Blastoise, which can attempt to paralyze it with Body Slam, as well as Kabutops, which can deal huge damage with Slash. Dragonair has difficulty finding a setup turn for Agility, often relying on dodging Body Slam paralysis or accepting heavy damage and a chance for a critical hit from Blizzard users to set up, leaving it in OHKO range should it miss a single Wrap. Paralysis is also terrible for Dragonair even if it uses Agility, as this reduces Wrap's already shaky success rate to a downright awful 63.75%, ensuring it will fall shortly after. At its best, Dragonair can spread paralysis to multiple foes or chip the opposing team for massive damage, allowing allies to clean up, but it needs to dodge a lot of bad luck to contribute adequately.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Wrap": {
          "description": "<p>Wrap is essential for Dragonair to control the enemy team, forcing paralyzed foes, as well as Clefable and Exeggcute out to avoid retaliation. If using Thunder Wave, Wrap allows Dragonair to force the opponent to send in an unparalyzed Pokemon, giving Dragonair the option to chip it, paralyze it, or pivot to an ally safely. With Agility, Wrap becomes the ultimate chip-spreading tool, forcing the opponent to hope for Wrap to miss at the right time to punish with paralysis or Blizzard. Dragonair's last two moves are typically Blizzard and Thunderbolt to provide coverage, allowing it to finish off chipped foes or exploit Wrap misses against targets at low HP; Blizzard ensures it can hit Golem and Nidoking, while Thunderbolt hits Water-types and particularly Kabutops, which otherwise can absorb Wrap well. However, other options are possible, such as Hyper Beam to more effectively finish off neutral targets, such as Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Venomoth, or using Agility and Thunder Wave in tandem, giving Dragonair flexibility in its speed control at the cost of coverage.</p> <p>Dragonair benefits from teammates that can spread status, like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Venomoth, as these allow it to use Wrap without any setup. Venomoth is especially notable, since Sleep Powder provides a safe switch-in for Dragonair, and the opponent may not immediately switch after taking sleep due to fear of Stun Spore. This allows Dragonair to fish for Thunder Wave on an incoming foe or simply set up Agility and begin accruing chip damage. Electrode can help to spread paralysis and create an opening with Explosion, or it can clean up after Dragonair, but using both creates a large weakness to Nidoking. Dragonair's chip damage is ideal for allowing fast allies like Charizard, Raticate, and Nidoking to clean; Charizard falls just short of KOing many foes with +2 Hyper Beam, and Wrap easily bridges that gap, whereas Raticate needs no setup to repeatedly fire off a powerful STAB Hyper Beam, taking out many foes from about 50% of their HP. Nidoking lacks the power of the other two options but makes up for it in excellent coverage, tearing through weakened and paralyzed teams easily.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Agility + Partial Trapping, Hypno, and Articuno. Dragonite is generally considered good in the current metagame.</p> <hr /> <p>Thanks to an unrivaled base stat total and enormous movepool, Dragonite is easily the most versatile Pokemon in RBY UU and a major influence on what Pokemon and moves are popular. Dragonite is most infamous for its lethal Agility and Wrap combo, which enables it to slowly chip down foes and potentially sweep entire teams. The pair of moves is so powerful that virtually every Pokemon is forced to carry a move that can dispatch or incapacitate Dragonite before it can set up. In addition to being the most potent sweeper in the tier, Dragonite has numerous defensive and supportive traits that make it very easy to justify including on most teams. Its typing and enormous bulk allow it to take on tier staples such as Dugtrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, Venusaur, and Tangela. Furthermore, Wrap and Thunder Wave allow Dragonite to act as a pivot and provide essential support for its teammates. Finally, Dragonite has an incredibly diverse pool of offensive options including Blizzard, Thunderbolt, Body Slam, and the strongest non-STAB Hyper Beam, making it unpredictable and difficult to check. Its typing and versatility also make it an excellent partner to many key Pokemon; those that fear Dugtrio and other physical attackers, like Electabuzz, Haunter, and Persian, appreciate it, as do those that benefit from paralysis spreading, like Articuno, Kangaskhan, and Golem.</p> <p>Dragonite's most obvious shortcoming is its Ice weakness, which gives many prominent Blizzard users, including Tentacruel, Articuno, Vaporeon, Omastar, Dewgong, and Gyarados, the potential to OHKO it. For Tentacruel, Articuno, and Dewgong, this KO is guaranteed. All of them can force Dragonite out if they come in at the same time as it or through a Wrap pivot. They can also severely punish Dragonite if it misses with Wrap. Dragonite is also quite vulnerable to status effects, as they weaken strategies involving Wrap, either by damaging Dragonite during Wrap turns or making it less likely to connect the move. While Dragonite is not particularly slow, it is outpaced by several prominent Pokemon, most notably Tentacruel, so Dragonite is likely to be revenge killed once it has sustained a fair amount of damage. Lastly, while AgiliWrap is Dragonite's claim to fame, it is not totally reliable. Due to Wrap's mediocre 84.4% accuracy, it's not uncommon for Dragonite to set up Agility, miss with Wrap early, and faint to Blizzard.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonite has a diverse array of coverage moves to play with if it wants to cover certain targets. While it misses out on hitting Grass-type Pokemon, Surf is a more accurate alternative to Blizzard that does more to Golem and Omastar while still 2HKOing Dugtrio. Fire Blast is an interesting option that can burn foes. Burn synergizes well with Dragonite’s Wrap and can incapacitate opposing users of partial trapping moves and physical attackers like Tentacruel and Kangaskhan. The move also happens to be Dragonite’s strongest option against Articuno and Pinsir, netting a 3HKO and a 2HKO, respectively. Thunder is a somewhat viable alternative to Thunderbolt; while it sacrifices accuracy, the move garners a possible 2HKO against Omastar and Dewgong and a guaranteed 3HKO against Vaporeon.</p> <p>Dragonite also comes equipped with some notable defensive options. Rest is the most notable of the bunch, as Dragonite is quite difficult to 3HKO. In addition to Wrap turns, Dragonite can attempt to wake up on Pokemon such as Venusaur, Tangela, Aerodactyl, and Electabuzz. The move can still be exploited by Blizzard users and Agility users—most notably Articuno and opposing Dragonite—however. Reflect is potentially interesting for helping against physical attackers, but it fails to protect Dragonite from the many prominent special attackers and Persian's and Pinsir's Slash. Toxic is a fairly useful move for taking advantage of Wrap, but it doesn’t help much against faster Pokemon and has no effect on Tentacruel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Blizzard Users</strong>: Pokemon with Blizzard greatly threaten Dragonite and can force it out rather consistently. Tentacruel, Articuno, and Dewgong are guaranteed to OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard, so it is very likely to switch out when faced with any of them. Articuno is particularly scary, as not only does it outspeed Dragonite, but it can also potentially set up with Agility and sweep regardless of what Dragonite does. Omastar and Vaporeon are also very likely to OHKO, which encourages Dragonite to switch out, although it may elect to take the risk if it has Wrap. Gyarados outspeeds and can OHKO Dragonite 38.5% of the time, making it a fairly strong answer as well. Poliwrath will never OHKO Dragonite, but it is still a fairly reliable answer to sets without Thunderbolt, though Dragonite may risk using Agility in front of it, especially if the situation is dire.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Because most Dragonite variants rely on Wrap for damage and pivoting, passive damage does a great job at punishing them. Toxic is the most common form of passive damage and is frequently run by Dugtrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, Dodrio, Venusaur, and Aerodactyl. The damage causes Dragonite to take more damage than it can deal with Wrap, thus limiting its ability to pivot and shutting down the AgiliWrap combo almost entirely. Other, less common, forms of passive damage, such as burn and Leech Seed, will work much the same. Aerodactyl and Moltres are the most likely Pokemon to burn Dragonite, as they regularly carry Fire Blast. The Attack drop makes Wrap, Body Slam, and Hyper Beam, much less effective. Venusaur is the only notable user of Leech Seed; though the effect is not permanent, it may choose to run the move over Toxic because of the higher accuracy and HP recovery. All forms of passive damage also limit Dragonite's defensive capabilities, regardless of the set. For example, Dugtrio and Kangaskhan become much more likely to get 3HKOs if Dragonite is poisoned. Additionally, after just a single turn of Toxic damage, Vaporeon will always OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard and Gyarados will OHKO over 80% of the time.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: If Dragonite is paralyzed, it only has about a 63% chance of connecting Wrap. Like passive damage, paralysis greatly reduces the reliability of Wrap for pivoting and sweeping. Moreover, being paralyzed leaves Dragonite much less equipped to handle slow users of Blizzard like Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong.</p> <p><strong>Normal-resistant Pokemon</strong>: While it is still immobilized by Wrap, Haunter takes no damage from the move. Haunter can rather effectively stall Dragonite out of Wrap PP, meaning that setting up AgiliWrap is close to unviable so long as Haunter is healthy. Outside of Wrap, Dragonite still needs to be wary of Haunter’s very fast Hypnosis and Explosion. Much like Haunter, Rock-type Pokemon like Omastar, Aerodactyl, and Golem can potentially PP stall Dragonite’s Wrap, especially if they are paired with each other or Haunter. Aerodactyl is especially notable, as it outspeeds Dragonite, meaning it can switch in and use Toxic or KO it if it happens to be in range. Finally, Rock-type Pokemon can switch in and punish Hyper Beam effectively with prediction.</p> <p><strong>Faster Partial-trappers</strong>: Partial-trapping moves allow Pokemon like Pinsir and Moltres to stop an AgiliWrap sweep without dedicating a moveslot to Toxic. Both Pokemon can then easily pivot to Pokemon like Tentacruel and Articuno. However, if Dragonite has already used Agility, partial-trapping moves cannot punish a miss, unlike Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Blizzard. Moltres is the only exception, being able to use Agility itself after a miss to outspeed the boosted Dragonite and chip it down with Fire Spin.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "AgiliWrap": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is Dragonite’s most common set, and arguably its most dangerous. After using Agility, Dragonite outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and can immobilize and chip any Pokemon but Haunter. Considering Dragonite’s unrivaled Attack stat, Wrap can deal massive damage to the opposing team and occasionally even sweep outright after Agility. However, the healthier the opposing team is, the less likely this strategy is to work; Dragonite will need some luck to connect Wrap that many times. Because Wrap is sometimes dealt with through repeated switching, the Dragonite user can also potentially gain a lot of information about the opposing team quite early in the game. Unlike other sweepers and Agility users, Dragonite can set up at virtually any point in the game; Wrap can severely weaken a team even if it doesn’t actually KO any of its members. From there, fast sweepers like Dugtrio, Persian, and Electabuzz can quickly finish the job. Aside from Haunter and Rock-type Pokemon like Omastar, Aerodactyl, and Golem—which do not take much damage from Wrap—there aren’t really any Pokemon that need to be dealt with before Dragonite can comfortably set up. Another key aspect of AgiliWrap is just how threatening it is; Dragonite very strongly discourages Pokemon from switching out, as doing so could net Dragonite the free turn it needs to use Agility and do a lot of damage. Because of this pressure, Dragonite can often force key damage on slow Pokemon like Hypno and Vaporeon with Wrap, which could potentially force an earlier use of Rest, which Dragonite and its teammates could later exploit. Additionally, if Dragonite is in a position to accept poison or paralysis, it can get enormous damage on or paralyze a powerful Pokemon like Dugtrio, Persian, or Kangaskhan.</p> <p>The key to this Dragonite set is finding the right opportunity to set up. The most obvious way is in front of sleeping or frozen foes. If they do not switch out from Dragonite's teammates immediately, they risk inviting Dragonite in to potentially close the game right there. Moreover, AgiliWrap Dragonite is one of the best, if not the best, Pokemon at punishing Rest. Dragonite creates many 50/50 situations by punishing Rest, most notably threatening to come in against a Hypno that was brought to about half health by Kadabra or opposing Hypno. Alternatively, Dragonite may face a Pokemon that lacks a move to immediately dispatch it; these Pokemon are also prime setup fodder. Preventing Dragonite from successfully sweeping with Wrap generally involves using Toxic, a move that can induce paralysis, or Blizzard, provided the user can OHKO Dragonite. Pokemon without any of these options are fairly rare, but not unseen. Offensive Normal-type Pokemon, such as Kangakhan, Persian, and Dodrio, regularly drop Toxic, making them good targets to set up, especially after some scouting. Finally, while poison and paralysis do greatly hinder any shot of sweeping with Wrap, statused Dragonite is not dead weight, still being good at dealing some damage before it goes down. In the case of paralysis, Dragonite still maintains its defensive abilities, such as checking Dugtrio, Venusaur, and Tangela. Additionally, because Agility clears the Speed drop from paralysis, Dragonite can still attempt to use AgiliWrap. The consistency is significantly lower, but Dragonite still has the potential to deal a lot of damage, and the occasional full paralysis can actually make PP stalling Dragonite a bit trickier, as Rock-type Pokemon looking to switch in on Wrap may end up at risk of taking Blizzard or Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Besides AgiliWrap, Dragonite's most notable attribute is reliably checking Dugtrio and Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela. Because of this role, Blizzard is an obvious choice on the set to hit them hard. Thanks to Dragonite’s above average Special, the move is a good option for weakening offensive Pokemon or finishing off foes during a sweep attempt. It also happens to be Dragonite's best tool for hitting Haunter, being a 4HKO. Additionally, if Dragonite is desperate, it can fish for a freeze to set up with Agility. Dragonite’s final moveslot is its most flexible, generally being used to suit what the team needs. Despite limiting Dragonite to just one consistent source of damage, Thunder Wave is a good option, as it can slow down offensive Normal-type Pokemon that will likely stay in against Dragonite and use Toxic. It can also incapacitate opposing Wrap Dragonite and catch faster Pokemon that often switch in, like Tentacruel and Gyarados. Furthermore, if you are afraid of missing Wrap and willing to sacrifice Dragonite, settling for paralysis on a key Pokemon is often a worthwhile trade. Dragonite boasts the strongest non-STAB Hyper Beam in the game, making it an excellent move for finishing off foes that have been chipped by Wrap. The move can KO Tentacruel and Hypno from around half health and even has a 30.8% chance to OHKO Kadabra. Body Slam functions much the same as Hyper Beam, albeit being notably weaker. The superior accuracy, paralysis chance, and lack of a recharge turn make the move a lot more reliable during sweeps, however. Finally, Thunderbolt is the best option for Omastar, which otherwise is relatively unafraid of Dragonite. The move is also notable for dealing heavy damage to Vaporeon, Dewgong, and especially Gyarados.</p> <p>AgiliWrap Dragonite can fit on the majority of teams, considering the larger number of Pokemon it can check and how universally threatening AgiliWrap is. Many key Pokemon in the tier are very afraid of Dugtrio, so Dragonite’s ability to come in on Earthquake and swiftly punish it with Blizzard is appreciated. While Pokemon such as Gyarados also accomplish this role, Dragonite is generally unbothered by Electric- and Grass-type Pokemon, making it a strong choice on teams with multiple Water-type Pokemon already. Dragonite can form very strong defensive cores with most Water-type Pokemon, especially Vaporeon. Vaporeon is very good at dealing with Ice-type moves and can improve the effectiveness of Wrap by spreading paralysis with Body Slam. The pair also makes Dugtrio struggle to gain momentum, as the opponent will have to constantly choose between using Earthquake and Rock Slide to net the most damage. Electric-type Pokemon, such as Electabuzz and Raichu, can pressure bulky Water-type Pokemon that can bully Dragonite. Raichu also has Surf to OHKO Golem, which takes Wrap chip damage very comfortably. Kadabra is another immensely good teammate for Dragonite. In addition to being quite good at spreading paralysis, Kadabra handles Toxic better than any other Pokemon thanks to Recover. This means it is a strong switch-in when Dragonite faces a Pokemon that must use Toxic to prevent AgiliWrap. Similarly, Poison-type Pokemon like Tentacruel, Venusaur, and Venomoth can also switch into predicted Toxic. Finally, users of sleep-inducing moves, like Haunter, Venusaur, Tangela, Poliwrath, and Hypnosis Hypno, give Dragonite an additional target to potentially set up on.</p>"

        "Wrap Pivot": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This Dragonite set is more of a defensive pivot and takes advantage of its wide movepool to improve many common matchups and reduce the danger of Toxic. While Dragonite is far from the fastest Pokemon in the tier, it is still quick enough to pressure Pokemon like Hypno, Tangela, and bulky Water-type Pokemon with Wrap. Additionally, Wrap can enable one of Dragonite's teammates to come in safely. Most often a strong offensive Pokemon, like Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, Gyarados, or Articuno, will take advantage of this opportunity to take out a weakened foe. This strategy is especially effective against slower foes because Dragonite is not pressured to switch out immediately, meaning it can be difficult to predict when it will pivot to a stronger attacker. Wrap is less effective against faster foes, but still feasible if a Pokemon like Tentacruel tries to switch into Dragonite. In a case like this, Dragonite can then very easily pivot to something even faster, like Kadabra or Electabuzz, to threaten Tentacruel in return. Even without a boost from Agility, Wrap is very good for maintaining momentum.</p> <p>This set becomes very powerful with paralysis support, as it allows Dragonite to deal a lot of damage and pivot effectively against more Pokemon. Fast Pokemon that can threaten Dragonite like Kadabra and Electabuzz become almost trivial to manage after paralysis. This means Dragonite can be a strong choice late-game and avoid taking damage even without Agility. Thus, this set frequently makes use of Thunder Wave. Dragonite is one of the only Pokemon with Thunder Wave that can take a few hits from Normal-type attackers. It is a surprisingly strong check to Kangaskhan, Persian, and Dodrio, as it can switch in and pacify them with Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave can also nail some key Pokemon that are likely to switch in against Dragonite. As an example, Dugtrio is very likely to use Toxic against Dragonite and then switch out to something that can stomach a Blizzard. Common situations like this one allow Dragonite to paralyze important Pokemon like Vaporeon, Omastar, and even Tentacruel.</p> <p>Aside from Wrap and possibly Thunder Wave, the remaining moveslots are usually dedicated to some combination of offensive moves. Blizzard is the most common because it helps against Dugtrio, which is generally the Pokemon that encourages players to use Dragonite in the first place. It’s also the best option against the Normal-type Pokemon this set often seeks to face. Body Slam and Hyper Beam are strong options for picking off Hypno and frailer Pokemon like Kadabra, especially if they are paralyzed. Body Slam in particular is also notable for threatening to paralyze Dugtrio and fast Pokemon that are likely to switch in, much like Thunder Wave. Thunderbolt is the best option for the numerous Water-type Pokemon in the tier. A key advantage of this set is that, once the first three moves are used, most players will anticipate that its last move will be Agility; this lets it regularly catch Pokemon like Hypno and Omastar by surprise with a powerful attack.</p> <p>This set works best with Pokemon that can spread or benefit from paralysis. Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Dodrio, Gyarados, and Vaporeon fit in both categories, as they use Body Slam and become more dangerous against paralyzed foes. Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz are common partners for their ability to spread paralysis. Conversely, Pokemon like Tentacruel, Articuno, and Golem appreciate Dragonite’s ability to paralyze Water-type Pokemon and pressure them with Wrap. Pokemon with a severe weakness to Dugtrio or the Normal-type Pokemon, like Haunter or Electabuzz, greatly benefit from this Dragonite set. Dugtrio itself is also a good partner, as it matches up well against Pokemon that take little or nothing from Wrap, like Omastar and Haunter, while also scaring off Tentacruel, which is often quite difficult to paralyze.</p>"
        },
        "PhysNite (Offensive)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This offensive set allows uses Dragonite's large stats and movepool to break down walls and block certain Pokemon from making progress. In many ways, it performs similarly to Gyarados, being a solid check to Dugtrio that can pressure frail or slow Pokemon like Kadabra and Hypno. Specifically, PhysNite functions as a tank, shutting down Pokemon unable to immediately threaten it and firing off some of the most powerful attacks in the game and the crippling Thunder Wave. It is also a potent revenge killer, able to pressure Dugtrio and pretty much everything slower than it. The main trade-off in using Dragonite over Gyarados is the selection of Pokemon that each one checks. While Gyarados holds up better against bulky Water-type Pokemon, Tentacruel, Articuno, and opposing Dragonite, Dragonite matches up more comfortably against Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon. Essentially, this set is best on teams that need Gyarados’s set of attributes but may fear certain matchups.</p> <p>This set benefits a lot from how players conventionally react when facing Dragonite. Lacking Wrap, this set handles paralysis and poison better than any other. In fact, considering Dragonite has such a good matchup against Venusaur and Tangela, it is remarkably good at preventing them from putting something to sleep if it has been paralyzed. Handling status fairly well makes PhysNite quite comfortable taking on certain threats, like Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Tangela, that other Dragonite are likely to avoid out of fear of paralysis. Dragonite’s wide pool of offensive moves and access to paralysis gives it many strong head-to-head matchups, allowing it to fairly comfortably trade with several common Pokemon. Teams that struggle with just one specific Pokemon, like Dugtrio, a Grass-type Pokemon, or an Electric-type Pokemon, tend to be the best fit for this Dragonite set.</p>"
        },
        "Agility Sweeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This is Dragonite’s least common set, but it is still fairly effective. It forgoes Wrap and frames Dragonite as a more conventional Agility sweeper, like Articuno and Dodrio. While they can generally sweep much sooner than Dragonite thanks to having STAB moves, Dragonite maintains a few minor advantages over them that make it worth using. Firstly, Dragonite enjoys a generally superior defensive typing, meaning it can still act as a check to Pokemon like Dugtrio in a pinch. Secondly, Dragonite is a strong mixed attacker, which allows it secure endgames against a wider variety of Pokemon than other sweepers. Lastly, and most importantly, the mere sight of Dragonite strongly encourages certain foes to use Toxic. Unlike Wrap sets, this set is largely unfazed by Toxic. This means, unlike other Agility users, Dragonite can guarantee itself an almost free turn to set up against certain foes. If the opposing team is weak enough, Dragonite can quickly clean up with its impressive offenses and wide coverage.</p> <p>This set requires quite a fair deal more support to function than most sets. Bulkier Pokemon like Omastar, Vaporeon, and Articuno need to be brought into KO range of Thunderbolt or Hyper Beam before this set has any chance of succeeding. As such, this set tends to fit better on more offensive teams that can consistently damage foes and keep them from using Rest. Fast Pokemon like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Electabuzz are thus among the best partners. Having a solid answer to Articuno is also advisable, as it is bulky enough to easily set up with Agility and then KO Dragonite, even if Dragonite has already set up itself. Also unlike the other sets, this Dragonite set has limited utility early-game and relies fairly heavily on surprise factor, making it most useful towards the very end of the game.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Everyone knows Dragonite’s claim to fame. While a wide move pool, a base stat total bested only by that of Mewtwo, and a unique Dragon typing are all distinguishing features, Dragonite’s true niche rests in its access to Wrap. With an unparalleled Attack stat and two excellent speed control options in Thunder Wave and Agility, Dragonite can immobilize and whittle away at its foes. In Ubers, Dragonite is much the same frustrating but effective Pokemon it is in other tiers.</p> <p>Dragonite is a powerful pivot and potential sweeper with a lot of utility options. It can meticulously prepare favorable endgames against paralyzed and slow teams for its teammates to sweep, or it can even painfully choke out entire teams itself. A wide pool of coverage moves makes Dragonite unpredictable and quite difficult to wall. Its Flying typing is also quite nice for slowing down Earthquake users, most notably Mew. It’s not terribly uncommon for Mew to run Earthquake as its only reliable attacking move, meaning that Dragonite can wall some variants indefinitely.</p> <p>Despite many positive traits, Dragonite has many limitations that keep it from dominating the tier. For starters, Dragonite relies heavily on paralysis to function. If Dragonite is slower than its foe, it cannot use Wrap safely. It is very vulnerable to paralysis itself, as it becomes incapable of using Wrap effectively or reliably given its already imperfect accuracy. Its typing, while useful for some matchups, also means that Ice-type moves from common Pokemon like Mewtwo are a terror. Thus, Dragonite requires strategic play to position such that it can actually make its way through teams with little risk. Another obvious issue is its reliance on Wrap, which, even in the best of circumstances, can miss and immediately result in Dragonite failing to pivot or sweep.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonite has a lot of interesting moves that it can try, but few are practical and better than what can be found in the main set. Thunderbolt is likely Dragonite’s next best move, as it gives it a very strong option against Slowbro, Starmie, and Cloyster. Dragonite is not extremely likely to face these Pokemon, so Thunderbolt has fairly limited utility. Thunderbolt generally needs to be used alongside Blizzard so Dragonite will not struggle with Exeggutor or Ground-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Fire Blast is a novel option primarily because of its ability to burn foes. In addition to cutting the Attack stat of a Pokemon, the extra damage from burn synergizes well with Wrap. Notably, a burned Gengar can no longer stall out Dragonite's Wrap, as the damage will eventually cause it to faint, even though Wrap itself is doing no damage. The move is often outclassed by Blizzard, which hits a better array of targets and has a higher accuracy.</p> <p>Double-Edge can be an alternative to Hyper Beam that trades the higher Base Power for greater accuracy, more PP, and no risky recharge turn. The move is rather uncommon, as the drop in power is very noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Using Ice-type moves, Mewtwo, Starmie, Jynx, Lapras, Cloyster, and Articuno all have at least a chance to OHKO Dragonite outright. Aside from Lapras and Cloyster, they are all faster than Dragonite, meaning Dragonite cannot safely use Wrap against most users of Ice-type moves. Other Pokemon like Tauros, Chansey, and occasionally Snorlax can all 2HKO Dragonite with their common Ice-type moves as well. Tauros is particularly dangerous, as a critical hit will take Dragonite out immediately.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis often hampers Dragonite, as it heavily drops the consistency of Wrap. Faster users of Thunder Wave, such as Alakazam, Starmie, Mew, Zapdos, and Jolteon can all immediately threaten Dragonite. Other users of paralysis moves, like Chansey, Slowbro, and Exeggutor can all also heavily punish Dragonite on a switch or if Wrap misses. Users of Body Slam, especially fast ones, can also threaten Dragonite in a pinch.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Wrap</strong>: Gengar will generally beat Dragonite in a straight head-to-head, especially if Dragonite does not have Blizzard. Furthermore, Gengar is quite good at getting Dragonite to waste Wrap PP due to its immunity to its damage. While Surf and, to a lesser extent, Blizzard can threaten Rhydon and Golem, their resistance to Wrap can help them stall out Wrap PP as well. Both can also switch into Hyper Beam to punish it.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Wrap": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Wrap is Dragonite’s most important move, giving it the ability to both pivot and sweep. Wrap enables it to pressure slower foes like Chansey, Snorlax, and paralyzed Pokemon with chip damage and then switch out to a potent partner, such as Tauros, Rhydon, or Zapdos to finish the job without either Pokemon taking damage in the process. In general, Dragonite thrives on paralysis support and loathes being paralyzed. As such, Dragonite tends to favor the late-game, steadily mounting damage after paralysis has been spread or faster Pokemon have been knocked out.</p> <p>Teammates can spread paralysis for Dragonite, but Dragonite can also be quite good at spreading paralysis itself with Thunder Wave. Because Dragonite can theoretically use Agility at any time to set up for a sweep, few Pokemon will feel comfortable switching out against it and will often try to attack it first, even if a different move or switch seems likely. Additionally, trying to block paralysis by switching in an already paralyzed Pokemon is largely ineffective, as Dragonite can simply use Wrap with little risk. In most cases, Dragonite will aim to paralyze Pokemon that are quick and threatening but can’t consistently paralyze or KO it in return. This includes Pokemon like Tauros and certain variants of Mew and Mewtwo. This creates a stronger position for both Dragonite and offensive teammates. While Dragonite must avoid paralysis to use Wrap consistently, it may occasionally risk trading paralysis with high value targets that may otherwise be dangerous in the endgame, such as Mew, Zapdos, and Alakazam, if it must. Moreover, Dragonite will be more willing to accept paralysis if the opposing Mew only has Earthquake as an attacking move, as Dragonite will still be able to fill an important role in checking it even after being slowed down.</p> <p>Using Agility allows Dragonite to become a powerful sweeper capable of outspeeding the entire metagame. With Wrap and strong attacks, a Dragonite can wipe out fairly healthy teams by itself after using Agility. Agility can also reverse the Speed-dropping effects of paralysis, but the 25% chance of immobilization is still very problematic if Dragonite plans on using Wrap at any point. The challenge with Agility, aside from Wrap misses, is finding an opportunity to use it safely. Dragonite can’t comfortably set up on many common Pokemon in Ubers, as almost all of them have at least a chance to paralyze or KO it. This means Dragonite will most often be clicking Agility when risking a critical hit or paralysis chance from Body Slam is worth it, when the opponent is expected to switch out, or when the opposing Pokemon is asleep or frozen. Agility can be used with or without Thunder Wave; while Agility Dragonite does appreciate access to two attacking moves, the utility of Thunder Wave, sometimes even after Agility has been used, is too much to give up. While Agility is generally considered as an option to strengthen Wrap, it can instead occasionally be used to strengthen Thunder Wave when spreading paralysis is more important than chip damage or pivoting. This is most applicable if Dragonite is expected to check Earthquake Mew. While Dragonite will likely take a Thunder Wave in this scenario, it may be able to paralyze Mew and threaten the Pokemon that will switch in after. Agility can be used safely against Mew to give itself the Speed advantage against dangerous Pokemon looking to switch in, such as Tauros, Mewtwo, Rhydon, and Golem.</p> <p>Dragonite can round out its set with one or two of the many strong and diverse attacks in its arsenal. Surf has decent base power, hits every Pokemon in the game, and has a fair amount of PP, making it one of the safest choices for Dragonite. Surf also instantly takes out Rhydon and Golem, which otherwise take only a little damage from Wrap and can potentially PP stall it. Blizzard hits a bit harder than Surf but is less reliable. It is notably Dragonite’s strongest move against Exeggutor and Gengar, the latter of which can be quite difficult for Dragonite to handle given it takes no damage from Wrap at all. Hyper Beam is Dragonite’s strongest move and thus an excellent choice for finishing off foes. As with Blizzard though, Hyper Beam is not overly reliable, and it can also land Dragonite in a bad situation if it fails to KO. Body Slam is a reliable and fairly strong move with a good chance to paralyze foes, making it an excellent option to punish switches. It is, however, not the best for finishing Pokemon off during a sweep and it doesn’t help much against Rhydon, Golem, and most notably Gengar. This means pairing Body Slam with Hyper Beam is generally not viable.</p> <p>Dragonite teams well with Pokemon that can spread paralysis effectively, such as Slowbro and Thunder Wave Mew. The strong offensive capabilities and boosting moves of these Pokemon can make blocking paralysis quite difficult. Thunder Wave Mewtwo can accomplish this as well, though the opportunity cost of running that set is often higher. Because Dragonite and its common teammates tend to spread paralysis well, offensive Pokemon tend to be good team options. Slow Pokemon like Rhydon and Golem appreciate gaining a Speed advantage after paralysis. Tauros becomes a lot more threatening after its teammates spread paralysis because the free turns from full paralysis can often allow Tauros to break through powerful foes like Mew and Mewtwo. Tauros can attempt to capitalize even further with Stomp. Paralysis and chip damage from Wrap can also do a lot to support Mew and Mewtwo. Pokemon like Mewtwo and Chansey become significantly less capable of switching into a boosted Mewtwo if they are paralyzed and have sustained some Wrap damage.</p>"

      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonite makes good use of Thunderbolt to hit Cloyster hard and dish out decent damage against Lapras on the switch in, both of which can scare Dragonite out with the threat of an OHKO with Blizzard. Thunder Wave can be useful against switch-ins that are typically difficult to paralyze, such as Gengar and Starmie, that Dragonite is bound to see. Body Slam blends damage with paralysis chance if you don't want to give up an attacking move for paralysis. Double-Edge is slightly stronger than Body Slam at the cost of not being able to paralyze and causing recoil damage. As finisher moves, both options have an advantage over Hyper Beam by not having to recharge if the opposing Pokemon is not KOed; the lower Base Power makes these moves unfavorable choices, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p>Gengar is the chief check as it's immune to Wrap and takes a pittance from any of Dragonite's other options. It doesn't really accomplish much against Dragonite, though, but will generally outlast non-Blizzard Dragonite one-on-one in a battle between unSTAB-boosted special attacks. Powerful Blizzard users, such as Lapras, Cloyster, Articuno, and, to an extent, Jynx, can all scare Dragonite out with the threat of an OHKO. The former three are very physically bulky and will be able to take several hits before dying, which makes it all the more likely that Wrap will miss at some point. Exeggutor and especially Slowbro are also very bulky and can threaten Dragonite with paralysis, but apart from that, they won't generally be able to handle Dragonite on their own. Chansey and Starmie are resilient with their instant recovery and usually carry Ice moves that can 2HKO Dragonite. These two can also paralyze Dragonite with Thunder Wave and force it to risk full paralysis in addition to Wrap misses. Note that Dragonite can use Agility again to completely ignore the Speed reduction from paralysis and resume being faster than all of your Pokemon. On the other hand, however, as full paralysis can also occur in the middle of a Wrap sequence, paralysis will severely limit Dragonite's potential. Its often even advised to go for the guaranteed paralysis with Thunder Wave instead of using an unSTAB-boosted Ice-type attack that will not OHKO.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that has enough health to take Dragonite's Hyper Beam can switch in to this predicted finishing move to cripple or KO Dragonite. When the opposing Pokemon is in KO range from Hyper Beam, the Dragonite user is likely to use it instead of Wrap, to avoid the possibility of an untimely Wrap miss. Punishing a predicted Hyper Beam could give you the possibility of paralyzing or KOing Dragonite. However, proper prediction is required as Dragonite could continue using Wrap, which by itself still has a high success rate against the weakened opponent. Pokemon that resist Normal-type moves, such as Golem and Rhydon, might even be surprised by Surf, which will OHKO them.</p> <p>It's important to note that, if given the chance, using the turn Dragonite uses Agility to cripple it is crucial. Even if you can only land one move that won't do much to Dragonite, such as Body Slam or Psychic, it may still be very rewarding later on, as it will increase the chances of any Ice-type move OHKOing Dragonite. In addition, Body Slam might also score paralysis, which will often ruins Dragonite's ability to effectively sweep.</p> <p>If all else fails, you can try to stall it out of Wrap PP if you can count carefully to 32. Wrap is very weak and locks Dragonite into Wrap if it chooses to stay in, regardless of whether you choose to switch or stay in yourself. Thus, you can repeatedly switch out to force Dragonite to use more turns which read \"Dragonite used Wrap!\" and that therefore cost PP as opposed to the \"Its attack continues!\" turns that do not use PP. However, if you miscount and switch out after Dragonite has used its last Wrap PP, Dragonite will still be forced to use Wrap PP, but instead of forcing Dragonite to use Struggle, RBY glitches and rolls Wrap's PP counter up to 63 to allow it to use Wrap again, thereby rendering your stall for naught. This strategy works much more effectively if you have Golem or Rhydon on your team, as otherwise you will have to sacrifice at least one Pokemon before Wrap runs out of PP.</p>",

          "description": "<p>The following analysis was produced in 2012. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current RBY OU metagame.</p> <hr /> <h4>Overview</h4> <p>It's got a wide attacking movepool. It's tied with Mew for the second-highest Base Stat Total in the game. It's the only fully-evolved Dragon-type in RBY, a type that sounds legendary on its own and that resists the STAB attacks of all three starter Pokemon. It's the final Pokemon used by Lance, the fourth member of the Elite Four. Clearly, Dragonite was intended to be some sort of legendary behemoth, the boss Pokemon to end all boss Pokemon, at least until the player found Mewtwo. However, in competitive usage, Dragonite is more likely to elicit groans and grimaces of irritation rather than the intended screams and wide eyes of terror. This is because Dragonite's power in OU does not derive from Hyper Beam, its massive base 134 Attack, its typing, or its diverse Special movepool. Rather, it's because of an annoying little move that its lowly first-stage evolution, Dratini, knows from the start: Wrap.</p> <p>Wrap's mechanics differ drastically in RBY compared to later generations; the move has a mere 15 Base Power, but it prevents the opposing Pokemon from making a move while the Wrap user is locked into this move for 2-5 turns. Furthermore, the immobilized opponent cannot attack even during the turn the Wrap user switches out, providing a safe entry for another Pokemon. However, unlike in other generations, the opponent might switch out the Pokemon that is incapacitated by Wrap. Dragonite is the best Wrap user in RBY because it, unlike any other RBY Wrapper, also has access to Agility to make it faster than any other Pokemon in the game. If Dragonite gets lucky and hits all of its Wraps, it can totally sweep a team without the opponent even being able to move. However, Dragonite will always miss a Wrap or two, leaving it vulnerable to getting paralyzed or shellacked by an Ice-type move. It is this unreliability that prevents Dragonite from being considered a staple of RBY OU when Wrap is allowed. When Wrap is not allowed, Dragonite is barely worth mentioning in OU due to its lack of STAB, mediocre Speed, and disastrous 4x weakness to the ubiquitous Ice Beam and Blizzard.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Here it is, possibly the most annoying set in all of Pokemon history. It's more than just annoying, however; it's absolutely deadly if luck is on your side. Agility boosts Dragonite's Speed above that of any unboosted Pokemon in the game. It then proceeds to take advantage of Wrap's debilitating mechanics by repeatedly using the move to render any switch-in unable to move, while slowly whittling away at the opposing Pokemon's health. Wrap can even be used to immobilize Gengar, which is immune to Normal-type moves, although Gengar is unlike other Wrap victims in that it does not take damage while incapacitated by Wrap. It is, however, not easy to find a good moment to use Agility, due to the prevalence of Ice-type and paralysis-inducing moves in RBY. Switching into the occasional sleeping or frozen Pokemon lets Dragonite set up Agility safely, however. Otherwise, slow Pokemon such as Golem, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Exeggutor that lack Stun Spore are good options to switch in and set up on. Taking a hit from them, however, means that Dragonite is now OHKOed by unSTAB-boosted Ice-type attacks.</p> <p>Once the opponent's Pokemon has been worn down to low enough health, Dragonite can use one of its other two attacking moves to secure the KO. Hyper Beam is generally the best option, as it is the strongest attack in Dragonite's movepool. Dragonite will usually be able to avoid Hyper Beam's incapacitating side effect as Wrap is meant to first put Pokemon in Hyper Beam's OHKO range. It lacks STAB, but comes from a base 134 Attack stat. Surf is the preferred option in the last slot as it guarantees an OHKO on the Rock / Ground types Golem and Rhydon. Blizzard can be used in its place to heavily damage Golem and Rhydon, but also to give Dragonite its best direct attack to use against Gengar. It also works as an alternative finishing move for Pokemon such as Zapdos and Exeggutor and, unlike Hyper Beam, does not force Dragonite to recharge if it does not OHKO.</p> <p>Dragonite is generally saved for a sweep and, as such, appreciates support from teammates that can spread paralysis directly. Not only does paralysis make Dragonite faster than the opponent without it having to use Agility, but a full paralysis might also save Dragonite if Wrap misses. Alakazam, Chansey, Starmie, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Zapdos are all Pokemon that can perform that role excellently. The former options can tank hits from many threats as well, while the latter two provide more offensive pressure. The choices should depend on how offensive you want your team to be, although it should be noted that Alakazam and Slowbro are generally the best options to spread paralysis.</p> <p>In addition, Dragonite is able to do more than merely sweep with Wrap; if it gets in on a predicted switch to a slow Pokemon, such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, or Chansey, or on a predicted Earthquake from Rhydon or Golem, it can use Wrap against whatever your opponent might decide to switch in. Dragonite can then switch out to a counter, which is guaranteed to take no damage from the switch-in thanks to Wrap's immobilization effect. Dragonite's ability to act as a pivot makes it a decent mid-game partner for heavy-hitters such as Snorlax and Rhydon to let them switch in on paralyzed foes with impunity. Moreover, as Wrap can still immobilize Gengar, hard-hitters such as Snorlax, Rhydon, Golem, and Tauros also synergize well with Dragonite in this regard. If Gengar switches into Wrap, you can immediately go to a powerful sweeper without taking damage thanks to Wrap's mechanics. Earthquake will generally scare Gengar out, giving Dragonite the possibility of punishing whatever your opponent switches in.</p>"

      "overview": "<p>Feast your eyes on the most destructive Pokemon in any tier in history. Not one stat Mewtwo has can be called bad or even average, including the highest Special in the game and a tie with Aerodactyl and Jolteon for second-highest Speed. It's not just an offensive juggernaut: Mewtwo's bulk is absolutely titanic, stomaching even blows from the mighty Snorlax and Tauros. Its Psychic typing comes into this as well, giving it effectively no type-based weaknesses to exploit. Because of these qualities, taking Mewtwo down often requires a concentrated effort from multiple Pokemon. As if that wasn't enough, it has a plethora of fantastic moves, such as Amnesia, Recover, STAB Psychic, Self-Destruct, and more. If given even a single turn of breathing room, Mewtwo can immediately take over a game. There is no true way to defeat Mewtwo head-on other than sending in your own, statusing it, or getting plain lucky. Thus, many RBY Ubers games are decided by a Mewtwo mirror match. Mewtwo was designed to be the world's strongest Pokemon, and Game Freak certainly succeeded: Mewtwo has zero inarguable flaws and is an automatic pick on any RBY Ubers team that aims to win.</p> <p>Mewtwo's only arguable flaws stem from it being quite literally too powerful for a Game Boy to process. A maximum DV and EV Mewtwo can end up overflowing its Special if it's boosted to +4 or higher and subsequently sustains a Special drop, minimizing its Special and leaving it effortless to KO. Similarly, Mewtwo's Speed gives it a very high critical hit rate—25.39%—which, combined with the fact that critical hits ignore the attacker's offensive boosts, means that +3 or higher Mewtwo will sometimes deal less damage than expected. Finally, while Mewtwo is incredible, it will always have some check it has trouble beating outside of brute force, as it often only has two moveslots available after Amnesia and Recover. However, brute force remains a fine option in a tight spot because Mewtwo is an utter juggernaut.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>To prevent Mewtwo's Special from overflowing, 8 EVs and 13 DVs in Special can make the stat 341 on any given Mewtwo set, which amounts to 1023 at +4, albeit capped at 999 in practice. This is known as the \"SafeTwo\" spread, pioneered by Enigami. Doing this, however, severely cuts into Mewtwo's bulk, making critical hits from special attacks deal noticeably higher damage. Thus, using this spread depends on whether your Mewtwo set aims for short-term reward or maximum mileage throughout a game.</p> <p>If a move is good in RBY, there is a good chance that Mewtwo learns it. Customizing Mewtwo usually consists of patching up offensive holes in a team while ensuring it doesn't leave itself open to its checks; in other words, without compromising its power level or making it more situational. Generally, Mewtwo's only free moveslot is one of its two attacking ones, as Amnesia and Recover are pivotal to its success.</p> <p>Rest is an interesting choice over Recover, especially on Barrier + Amnesia sets, which generally aim to last as long as possible, as it stalls for three turns at the cost of 1 PP, effectively amounting to 48 PP. It also comes with erasing the Speed drop from paralysis when switching out, though this can make Mewtwo somewhat difficult to wake up later if it hasn't woken up prior to switching; this is because Mewtwo regularly attracts self-KO move users like Snorlax and Golem, which it can't contest when asleep. Even worse, Swords Dance Mew can often set up and break through Mewtwo right away if not chipped or paralyzed, so it's recommended to incapacitate it with a teammate first. Rest also notably removes Mewtwo's paralysis, and paralysis arguably helps with PP stalling more, as it ensures it doesn't remain passive for extended periods of time.</p> <p>Mewtwo can potentially make use of the strong elemental attacks of RBY—Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Thunder—but they come with significant PP issues. Mewtwo mirrors often result in both losing a very large amount of PP, and putting your own at such a deficit right away frequently results in a loss. Additionally, each comes with its own disadvantage from a status perspective: Fire Blast's burn chance means it can thaw frozen Pokemon, while Blizzard and Thunder have less overall chance to inflict status because of their lower PP. Because Mewtwo often needs the superior status chances, the increased damage output is often just not worth it. This is to say nothing of the accuracy issues, which decrease the consistency of the one Pokemon that you can't afford to be inconsistent. However, the increased damage still leaves them situationally acceptable on teams able to PP stall Mewtwo without using their own Mewtwo; for example, +2 Blizzard or Fire Blast can OHKO Exeggutor, and an unboosted Thunder KOes Cloyster with even minor chip damage.</p> <p>Mewtwo's Attack is very usable, which makes Body Slam and Hyper Beam seem enticing. Body Slam can allow Mewtwo to spread paralysis while dealing physical damage, but compared to everything else Mewtwo can dish out, it's generally unimpressive. Hyper Beam is particularly interesting, as Mewtwo can then KO Chansey from a minimum of 44.6%. Against Mewtwo, a critical hit deals slightly more damage than Self-Destruct. Thus, it can be used as a substitute for BooM2 sets to try and get opposing Mewtwo in range for a critical hit or regular Hyper Beam instead of Self-Destruct. However, against any non-Psychic resistant Pokemon, including Chansey, the damage dealt is almost the same as +4 Psychic. Further, Psychic comes with the bonuses of not requiring a recharge, Special drops to further increase damage, and more attacking PP. Ergo, the only non-opposing Mewtwo reason to use Hyper Beam is for a better Light Screen Chansey matchup, which, while common, isn't omnipresent. If you're looking for a physical option, Submission is often the superior choice for hitting Chansey harder than Hyper Beam and having a significant PP advantage for Mewtwo.</p> <p>Mewtwo has fantastic physical bulk, making Counter appear viable. However, Counter is often best placed on Chansey, a Pokemon with higher potential damage that often draws physical attackers like Snorlax in more consistently. Mewtwo has little opportunity to use the attack, as it's often faced with opposing Mewtwo or Chansey before it even gets the chance to use it. Ergo, should these matchups come down to PP stalling, there is a very high chance that Counter will be revealed by force, ruining the gimmick entirely.</p> <p>BooM2 sets can arguably run Seismic Toss to make KOing opposing Mewtwo with Self-Destruct easier, making it a much more effective lure. However, fitting this into the set is extremely difficult and worsens its matchups against essentially anything other than Mewtwo, which it can't often afford. It's also possible to drop Amnesia entirely on these types of sets to add more coverage options or secure a slot for Recover, but this has seen little success.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo is arguably the best check to itself. The combination of Amnesia and Recover means your standard Amnesia set has a lot of trouble breaking through, requiring three critical hits in a row with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam to get the KO. Using Self-Destruct is one way to attempt to break through an opposing Mewtwo, but this requires sacrificing your own, and even then you only OHKO with a critical hit. This means even using Self-Destruct requires you to have the team support and setup necessary to finish Mewtwo off. Another option is having enough PP to successfully stall Mewtwo out; Submission is a great way to accomplish this, thanks to the 48 PP it offers. However, it oftentimes simply comes down to which Mewtwo will be frozen first, as getting a freeze often leaves nothing left to handle a boosted Mewtwo.</p> <p><strong>Freezing</strong>: Thanks to freeze being the virtual equivalent of a KO, freezing Mewtwo is often the best way to deal with it. Common Pokemon like Jynx, Starmie, Slowbro, and Chansey run Ice Beam or Blizzard, which both carry a 10.1% freeze chance. Additionally, these Pokemon are typically able to take a hit from even a boosted Mewtwo, meaning every turn spent against them carries a degree of risk. Managing to freeze the opponent's Mewtwo is a way to gain massive momentum, freeing up your own Mewtwo or Slowbro to wreak havoc with their biggest check out of the way.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen Chansey</strong>: As a testament to just how powerful Mewtwo is, the phenomenal special wall Chansey must run Light Screen to truly be a check. However, it's one of the most consistent Mewtwo checks in the game. A Mewtwo boosted to the 999 cap only possesses a 17.4% chance to 4HKO with Psychic through Light Screen. With Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, it's only a possible 6HKO. Chansey is one of the most consistent methods of overflowing a +6 Mewtwo's Special as well, using Psychic's Special drop chance and subsequently forcing a switch. Additionally, Chansey often has a significant PP advantage. This means Chansey can wall Mewtwo and force it to burn precious PP while healing off the damage it deals. However, even Chansey isn't safe. Psychic's 33.2% Special drop can degrade Light Screen and make Chansey much more vulnerable, making it arguably a temporary solution. Submission also 2HKOes it 86.7% of the time, making for a great anti-Chansey measure. Chansey is also a magnet for freeze attempts, which can be either a sigh of relief for your own Mewtwo or a catastrophic situation depending on your team's defensive integrity and Mewtwo set.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew has some interesting tricks that can allow it to check, set up on, or otherwise handle Mewtwo. With paralysis support and Swords Dance, it can set up to +4 Attack and then 2HKO with Earthquake while virtually never being 3HKOed in return by 999 Special Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. At +6, Mew is capable of OHKOing Mewtwo with Hyper Beam. Alternatively, some Mew variants simply opt to use Swords Dance and then Explosion to erase Mewtwo from the battle without any doubt. Defensively, Mew can use Transform to copy Mewtwo's stats and moves. Transform leaves Mew vulnerable for a turn, but the player gains crucial information about the opposing Mewtwo's set, walls it completely, and gains 5 PP for each move it holds. This 5 PP resets each time Mew uses Transform, meaning it is able to PP stall the opposing Mewtwo. It's not like Transform Mew only has the opposing Mewtwo's attacks either, as it can run other options to cripple it prior. These include Thunder Wave, Explosion to take a big chunk out of its health, Reflect to increase defensive integrity while transformed, and Soft-Boiled to stay healthy. Unless Mewtwo lands multiple critical hits or inflicts status, Mew is able to come in and check it somewhat consistently. However, Mew is far from an ironclad Mewtwo check; without paralysis support, Mewtwo is able to muscle through Mew on most occasions through brute force, as well as often ruining it completely with an untimely freeze.</p> <p><strong>PP Stall</strong>: Stalling Mewtwo out of PP is another way to deal with it, usually attempted with your own Mewtwo or Light Screen Chansey. Once it runs out of attacking PP, it's little more than a status absorber. However, accomplishing this is much easier said than done. With its monstrous Special, critical hit rate, and coverage, PP stall can sometimes be in vain, as crucial team members can fall to a freeze or massive damage. If Mewtwo lacks Thunderbolt, Slowbro is able to stand in its way, stalling PP while setting up its own brutal sweep. Thanks to its own Amnesia and Rest, Slowbro has a good chance to win one-on-one as well.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralyzing Mewtwo can open opportunities for powerful Pokemon such as Snorlax, Tauros, Mew, Golem, and Rhydon. Getting in on a paralyzed Mewtwo and being able to fire off big hits or threaten Explosion or Self-Destruct often forces it out. However, paralyzing Mewtwo can actually benefit it, as it can now no longer be frozen or put to sleep, and skipping turns with paralysis lets Mewtwo PP stall more effectively. Generally, Mewtwo despises being paralyzed early on, as it loses momentum against Mew, Snorlax, and Mewtwo specifically tailored to break through opposing Mewtwo. However, later on, when Mew and Snorlax have likely been taken out, Mewtwo tends to appreciate paralysis more. If you have the tools on your team to take advantage of a paralyzed Mewtwo early on, then it is absolutely worth it, as finding a way to break the opposing Mewtwo without risking your own is a key way to win consistently in RBY Ubers.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro is a fairly notorious check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo, being able to set up freely or even PP stall it if all goes well. The only risk to Slowbro in this scenario is a freeze from Ice Beam, which can be somewhat made up for with Rest preventing further status. Slowbro can also muscle past non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo through Thunder Wave and +6 Surf, which will eventually 4HKO a +6 Mewtwo and deal mortal damage otherwise. However, if Mewtwo has Thunderbolt, Slowbro will be 3HKOed even at +6 if Mewtwo is also at +6.</p> <p><strong>Self-KO Moves</strong>: The sheer power of Self-Destruct and Explosion makes them common methods of dispatching Mewtwo, primarily because it's often the highest-value Pokemon on its team and normally the most threatening. These strategies are at their most potent when Mewtwo is paralyzed, as it ends up becoming slower than the strongest users of self-KO moves in the game, namely Snorlax and Golem. While not even a STAB Self-Destruct from Snorlax will OHKO Mewtwo, it will often leave it in a position to be revenge killed by Pokemon like Tauros. Snorlax can also use Body Slam and then Self-Destruct, which is a guaranteed KO. Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets are often expressly made to trade against opposing Mewtwo too, and it's often paired with deadly sweepers like Slowbro, which become significantly more threatening with Mewtwo off the table. While their Explosions are quite weak, Gengar and Electrode also tend to Explode against Mewtwo, coming very close to OHKOing it on a critical hit.</p>",
      "sets": {
        "Standard": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mewtwo's defining set makes full use of the incredible Amnesia. With its astronomical Special, Amnesia leaves it almost impossible to switch into until it's scouted and just as hard to KO with special moves. A Mewtwo boosted up to the maximum of 999 Special can only fall to three or more critical hit special attacks. This tremendous bulk and Recover allow Mewtwo to stay healthy while hammering away. However, after these two mandatory moves, Mewtwo's coverage is impressive and has multiple viable options, making it a multifaceted threat able to plow through just about everything. The coverage options you choose will largely decide what your Mewtwo's primary role is.</p> <p>Mewtwo's STAB Psychic is one of the scariest no-drawback moves in the game. A 33.2% chance to drop Special as an added bonus can allow Mewtwo to muscle through something like Light Screen Chansey. The Special drops can also be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing paralyzed Mewtwo to outspeed an opposing paralyzed Mewtwo or incapacitate it for something else to handle; because of this, a paralyzed Mewtwo isn't out of the game just yet. Finally, Psychic has a significant benefit in causing an opposing +4 Mewtwo's Special to overflow if it doesn't have a \"SafeTwo\" stat spread, which consists of 13 DVs and 8 EVs in Special to ensure it starts at 341. Unfortunately, with the bevy of Psychic-types in Ubers, Mewtwo's targets are often resistant and thus take Psychic decently before striking back. Common examples include Exeggutor, Slowbro, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo.</p> <p>Slotting in Thunderbolt gives Mewtwo some unique coverage possibilities while bringing its PP up to 104. Mewtwo is now able to easily beat Slowbro; if both boost to the 999 cap, Mewtwo still 3HKOes with Thunderbolt, and that's to say nothing of its 25.39% chance to OHKO with a critical hit. Thunderbolt also gives Mewtwo access to paralysis. While the odds are slim, this can help Mewtwo and teammates immensely against opposing Mewtwo and Chansey. You're statistically likely to get at least one instance of paralysis from Thunderbolt's full PP, so it's fair to fish for it. On the downside, using it in the third moveslot means Mewtwo lets Exeggutor in for free, as it's only 3HKOed by a 999 Special Psychic from full HP; it can then use this opportunity to spread status or use Explosion. You also lose out on the potential to freeze by forgoing Ice Beam, which can really hurt against Chansey, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo. Also, paralyzed Mewtwo can inadvertently allow Rhydon a free switch should it use Thunderbolt or Recover, which puts it in a very difficult spot, as Rhydon can fish for Substitute on full paralysis and 3HKO with Earthquake from there.</p> <p>Ice Beam slots in nicely alongside Psychic, and the biggest reason is the 10.1% freeze chance. While the coverage is nice to help deal with Exeggutor, Ice Beam's primary draw is to freeze opposing Mewtwo or, less ideally, one of its major checks, like Chansey. This can open up the entire game and oftentimes win it outright. However, Slowbro is able to soak up this set's hits and use Amnesia, Thunder Wave, and Rest to have a good chance to beat Mewtwo head-on. Additionally, while Starmie doesn't pose much of a threat offensively, it can also paralyze Mewtwo or attempt to freeze it; it can take at least one hit from a Mewtwo with this coverage boosted up to 999. Opponents must be careful though, as +4 Psychic will 2HKO Starmie. Another drawback to this set is the mere 96 total PP, which can often become crucial when battling against other Mewtwo and trying to break down Chansey. This makes freezing the wrong Pokemon possibly quite deadly, as opposing Mewtwo tend to win from there through PP stall. When using Psychic + Ice Beam, it's best to avoid paralyzing the opposing Mewtwo in favor of winning by PP stall or freezing it.</p> <p>Even without a STAB option, Mewtwo still threatens the entire metagame with BoltBeam coverage. Instead of using its STAB Psychic, it can combine the coverage and benefits of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt while reaching 104 PP. While lacking Psychic means it no longer KOes the powerful and Self-Destruct-using Snorlax after some chip damage, the coverage allows Mewtwo to deal with almost everything else. It gains the advantage against both Slowbro and Exeggutor while bearing a 10.1% freeze chance for opposing Mewtwo, Mew, or Chansey. Since it handles almost the entire metagame besides these three Pokemon and Snorlax, it can blow the game wide open by freezing one of them. One drawback to this set is that, if your opponent has both Chansey and Mewtwo active, it will only be able to take out one while being walled by the other because of relying on a freeze. However, you can use Thunderbolt to attempt paralysis, meaning Mewtwo isn't completely shut down and can still help its team against these threats. Boosted up to 999, Mewtwo is able to OHKO Slowbro, Exeggutor, Tauros, and Starmie to name a few, making this combination a Swiss Army knife that is very difficult to deal with.</p> <p>A unique option that Mewtwo can run is Submission. First, Submission holds a whopping 48 PP, bringing the total to 128 if using Ice Beam or 136 if using Thunderbolt. This lets Mewtwo win PP wars against opposing Mewtwo consistently while having the advantage against Chansey. One must be careful of it getting frozen though. Submission destroys Light Screen Chansey, one of Mewtwo's most common adversaries, without risking PP stall. Submission Mewtwo has an 86.7% chance to 2HKO, and with its high critical hit ratio, it has a decent chance to OHKO. The primary drawback of this set is only running one special coverage option. Running Thunderbolt is the most common, as this allows Mewtwo to beat all of its most common checks, these being Chansey via Submission, Slowbro via Thunderbolt, and opposing Mewtwo via PP stall. However, this set struggles against Exeggutor and Rhydon, often allowing Explosion or status from the former and giving a free switch in to the latter. Ice Beam can be chosen over Thunderbolt to alleviate this, making the set weak to Slowbro but gaining the advantage against Exeggutor and Rhydon. Having a freeze chance is never bad either. Psychic, on the other hand, should not be chosen here; alongside Submission, it simply leaves Mewtwo vulnerable against too many common Psychic-types.</p>"
        },
        "BooM2 (Self-Destruct)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>By bluffing the standard set with Amnesia and your chosen coverage option, this Mewtwo can lure in the opposing Mewtwo, occasionally paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and then use Self-Destruct after some chip damage. Self-Destruct also comes with the bonus of beating set-up Slowbro, which is otherwise a common check to the set.</p> <p>Self-Destruct will KO opposing Mewtwo from 52.2% minimum, which means two uses of +2 Thunderbolt will set it up. It's recommended to run Thunderbolt, as well as paralysis support, to make it harder for the opposing Mewtwo to heal its way out of Self-Destruct range with Recover. Other options tend to only make this set worse, as matching up worse against Slowbro usually forces Mewtwo to use Self-Destruct. The normally ubiquitous Recover can be dropped for Thunder Wave, which guarantees that Mewtwo can use Self-Destruct before the opposing one can heal out of KO range. Naturally, this also means Mewtwo itself should avoid getting paralyzed whenever possible, or it becomes very difficult to succeed.</p> <p>This set carries inherent risks, as Self-Destruct is naturally inconsistent: it being absorbed by Gengar or Rhydon can be a game loss, and less common Mewtwo sets using Flash or even Barrier match up extremely well against it. However, it remains viable for the sheer reward the trade can provide. If supported by Seismic Toss Chansey, the set can be more consistent at securing trades, as two uses of Seismic Toss can also put opposing Mewtwo in KO range.</p>"
        },
        "Staller": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mewtwo can focus on stalling, which can be approached in two ways: Flash or Barrier. While they play differently in practice, the aim is very similar, that being stonewalling opposing Mewtwo. Because of the long-term role of these sets, the \"SafeTwo\" Special stat is highly recommended; the given spread gives Mewtwo a Special stat of 341, which ensures that it hits 1023 Special at +4, meaning that a Special drop does not trigger an overflow. Mewtwo's attacking option on this type of set largely depends on the rest of the team, and it only has one, so care should be taken. Thunderbolt hits Mew and Slowbro while giving Mewtwo the best PP advantage; however, Rhydon becomes extremely threatening, especially if running Flash. Alternatively, Ice Beam lets Mewtwo muscle past Exeggutor and Rhydon, as well as providing the option of freezing the opposing Mewtwo, possibly cutting off the Flash interaction early. STAB Psychic can serve as a generic option on Barrier sets, being the strongest attack Mewtwo has and also giving it the best shot of beating Snorlax before it paralyzes with Body Slam or uses Self-Destruct.</p> <p>The Flash approach aims to gain the most advantage in the Mewtwo mirror match without making a trade, so it should be kept in waiting until that opportunity arises. It works most effectively against Ice Beam Mewtwo, as Flash can decrease the opposing Mewtwo's chance of freezing your own while also giving a PP advantage against all standard sets, totaling to 112 PP with Psychic or Ice Beam, or 120 if running Thunderbolt. This forces the opponent to either switch out and risk losing a Pokemon or stay in and inevitably lose if enough accuracy drops set in. Attacking the opposing Mewtwo is generally unnecessary; stalling its attacking PP is all you need, leaving yourself with a fully boosted Mewtwo to wreak havoc thereafter. This set isn't wholly opposed to being paralyzed—skipping turns is arguably beneficial once the accuracy drops have piled on, though paralysis does drastically decrease its consistency prior to that.</p> <p>The combination of Barrier and Amnesia can be used instead to turn Mewtwo into a sweeper that also has a large PP advantage against opposing Mewtwo, which can be 112 PP with Recover added on, not factoring in offensive options. This alone is enough to PP stall any standard Mewtwo set, allowing you to end up with a fully boosted Mewtwo by the time they run out. It is strongly recommended to get this Mewtwo paralyzed as soon as possible, as this further improves its PP stalling capabilities and ensures it cannot get frozen later. With the assistance of Barrier, exploding on Mewtwo becomes an impossibility without something like Swords Dance + Explosion Mew, which forces the opposing team to PP stall it themselves. Even the mighty Snorlax, with the strongest physical move in STAB Self-Destruct, rarely hits for even a quarter of +6 Barrier Mewtwo's health. This set works especially well against Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets, as they cannot afford a PP war and lose the ability to KO it from half HP due to the Defense boost. While still vulnerable to critical hits, Mewtwo is very difficult to KO after boosting both Defense and Special, often surviving for astonishing periods of time.</p> <p>The main drawback to stall-centric Mewtwo sets is that they often require some momentum to function; Flash usually takes multiple hits to begin making your own Mewtwo difficult to hit, and Barrier sets add more turns of setup time. Ergo, any unfortunate luck during these sequences is often devastating, and making your own Mewtwo less consistent must be for good reason. Additionally, because of the aforementioned lack of coverage and specialized nature, stall-centric Mewtwo sets often end up being weaker to Pokemon other than opposing Mewtwo. Depending on the offensive option of choice, Mewtwo can become weak to any of Chansey, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Transform Mew. Slowbro is the most notable if not running Thunderbolt, being able to accumulate a sizable PP advantage through Rest while having high enough damage output to muscle past with repeated full paralysis. If running Thunderbolt, though, Light Screen Chansey becomes a big threat if not paralyzed, possessing a PP advantage and enough bulk to shrug off what Mewtwo throws at it. Regardless of offensive option and Mewtwo's sheer power, though, Barrier Mewtwo often has limited attacking PP to punish switch stalling, which is worsened when paralyzed. Ergo, teams using this set should make up for its shortcomings. Explosion Mew, Golem, and Self-Destruct Snorlax make fine choices, often making it easier to break through Chansey and Slowbro. Zapdos or Jolteon can also be effective—especially the latter, which tends to have a more consistent Chansey matchup and has a high critical hit rate to break through Slowbro. Slowbro is also an excellent partner, profiting greatly from a Thunderbolt Mewtwo being incapacitated to set up and sweep later.</p>"

    "ubers": {
      "overview": "<p>Mew is recommended to feature on all of your RBY Ubers teams and is one of only two Uber Pokemon—Pokemon banned from standard first generation play dating back to the earliest Nintendo sponsored tournaments. The mythical Pokemon may learn every TM, but it is uncommon in high-level play to see it without Swords Dance. Mew is the tier's premier physical sweeper; its base 100 stats all around let it outspeed Jynx and Speed tie with Zapdos, have an unboosted Attack stat equivalent to Tauros, and have bulk rivaling Snorlax's. Additionally, Soft-Boiled can capitalize on Mew's impressive bulk and Reflect can enhance it, which also makes Mew one of the top physical walls in the tier; conversely, it can sacrifice itself with Explosion to hopefully take another high-value Pokemon down with it. As a Special sweeper, it is outclassed by its clone, Mewtwo, which has Amnesia and a far superior Special stat, as well as by Amnesia Slowbro. Also, Mew's wallbreaking tool, STAB Psychic, is weaker than Alakazam's and Exeggutor's Psychics due to their higher Special stats.</p>",
      "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Kick and Double-Edge are single-turn attacks more powerful than Body Slam, but, in addition to their respective poor accuracy and recoil, they lack Body Slam's paralysis chance. Ice Beam or Blizzard used with Reflect threatens to freeze opposing Mew, and both inflict more damage onto Exeggutor, Golem, Rhydon, and Zapdos before Swords Dance boosts, but both force Mew to give up offensive potential.</p> <p>A couple of consecutive Seismic Toss used without reply can get paralyzed Mew not behind Reflect in Explosion's KO range.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Since Mew has to set up before inflicting heavy damage, even Pokemon with somewhat weak defenses can paralyze it with Thunder Wave before switching out the following turn. Like any Pokemon, Mew doesn't appreciate the sleep status either.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Mew</strong>: Any Mew set with both Reflect and Soft-Boiled is a good Mew answer. Thunder Wave paralyzes Mew, and Swords Dance combined with Explosion can take both Mew out of the picture. Swords Dance-boosted attacks also attempt to KO the other Mew.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Mew without Earthquake generally lacks the means to deal any damage to Gengar, usually firing off a Thunder Wave at most.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Reflect Snorlax is particularly effective against Mew lacking Earthquake, as +6 Body Slam is only a 4HKO against Snorlax behind Reflect. Snorlax can use Rest to recover health and is immune to Body Slam paralysis. It can paralyze Mew with its own Body Slam, though, and can deal at least 74% damage with Self-Destruct—assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect's boost.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Both Rhydon and Golem can exploit Mew lacking Earthquake. Rhydon's Substitutes aren't broken by even a +6 Body Slam most of the time. In return, Rhydon is extremely likely to 3HKO with Earthquake, assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect up. Golem lacks the same power and bulk as Rhydon but can threaten with a 64% or more damage Explosion. Explosion's usage can be predictable though, and Golem finds Reflect Mew extremely tough to break down. Rhydon manages to dismantle Body Slam variants with Leer or stall with Substitute and Rest.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Although considered to have low viability, Articuno makes for a solid check to the typical Mew; it is immune to Earthquake, and unboosted Body Slam from Mew isn't even a guaranteed 6HKO. Blizzard 3HKOes Mew in return. Articuno can also run Reflect; unlike Snorlax, it isn't immune to Body Slam paralysis, though.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster functions similarly to Articuno, except for it not being immune to Earthquake. It notably suffers from a less-powerful Blizzard but instead has an improved Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Mew is only a match for Reflect Zapdos when fully boosted. In the meantime, Zapdos can deal a minimum of 30% damage with Thunderbolt, forcing Mew to recover, while threatening possible critical hits. Mew recovering, especially from critical hits, gives extra opportunities for Thunderbolt's 10.2% chance of inflicting paralysis—assuming Mew isn't already paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is resistant to Earthquake and is usually only 6HKOed by Mew's Body Slam without boosts. It threatens Mew out with potential Stun Spore and Sleep Powder. It can also do 58% damage minimum to Mew with Explosion if Reflect is not up.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can paralyze Mew with Thunder Wave or set up Reflect or Withdraw with paralysis support. Slowbro's Surf has a small chance of 2HKOing at +2 Special.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros, which is faster than Mew when not paralyzed, can take it out with enough critical hits or full paralysis triggerings. Tauros benefits from its immunity to Body Slam paralysis, though the matchup slowly reverses as Swords Dance Mew gains its Attack boosts.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: If necessary, Mewtwo can 2HKO Mew on average at +2 Special. Mew, on the other hand, only 3HKOes at +2 Attack unless it possesses Hyper Beam.</p>",

        "Traditional Sweeper": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mew's traditional aim is to set up with Swords Dance, recover from any damage via Soft-Boiled, and then attempt to sweep with its two attacks. Earthquake is generally Mew's most damaging attack, OHKOing Gengar and 2HKOing Golem and Rhydon at +2 Attack. Body Slam hits Zapdos and Exeggutor neutrally, albeit being initially weak; it also aims to paralyze targets including opposing Mew, using paralysis and damage to pressure it to recover or use Explosion. At +6 Attack, Body Slam has guaranteed 2HKOs on every Pokemon that isn't Cloyster, behind Reflect or Defense boosts, or a Rock- or Ghost-type. Hyper Beam provides a more powerful move to finish off targets besides Golem, Rhydon, or Gengar, but additional paralysis support and care to avoid being exploited by Transform Mew are advised. Another downside of Hyper Beam is the risk that +4 or +6 Attack Hyper Beam is weakened by one of Mew's 19.5% likely critical hits, which can cost it the KO and force Mew to recharge. Soft-Boiled is the choice for longevity, but often Explosion can be useful to cancel out an opposing Mew in an advantageous position.</p>"

        "GGMew (Reflect Sweeper)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set was popularised during various RBY Ubers tournaments in 2016. It simultaneously performs well against opposing Mew and sets up to sweep. Thanks to Reflect, it can't be KOed by another Mew outside of a +4 Explosion—given no status, enough PP, and consistent recovery. The downside is having to choose between Body Slam or Earthquake; however, when you consider the viable Pokemon in the tier, your opponent will probably have at most two Pokemon that your chosen move cannot hit neutrally or super effectively. Body Slam is the slightly preferred choice due to it hitting Exeggutor and Zapdos, which are collectively considered more viable than Gengar and Rhydon. It also has 8 more PP, and Gengar and Rhydon can be baited into weakening themselves fighting Mew's teammates prior to revealing the set. Earthquake is usually more effective as a counter-team option because, like the traditional sweeper set, opting out of Body Slam for Earthquake means it is best to search for paralysis support. Soft-Boiled is recommended to take advantage of Reflect more.</p>"

        "Explosive Lure": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set exists to nullify an opposing Mew. Once your Mew has landed a Thunder Wave, the opposing Mew is slowed down and vulnerable to full paralysis. Next, boost with Swords Dance so that, on any following turn, Mew is ready to take it down with Explosion. If the opposing Mew uses Reflect, boost your Mew's Attack stat all the way up to +6 if you can in order to guarantee an OHKO with Explosion. Alternatively, you can chip the opposing Mew with Body Slam or Earthquake before delivering a +4 Explosion. With enough paralysis luck, your Mew may be able to KO the opposing Mew and save its Explosion for another Pokemon. Reflect can be used in this set to stall needing to use Explosion, although, since Mew's only attack will be Explosion, it relies on your opponent not playing around it and either giving away a less valuable Pokemon or sending in Gengar, Golem, or Rhydon. This set can also function as an emergency Mewtwo check; it is only 2HKOed by 999 Special Mewtwo, so Mew can reliably paralyze Mewtwo, and it does a minimum of 63% damage with an unboosted Explosion.</p>"

        "Lutrew / PaRaSiTe Mew (Transform)": {
          "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set was created by Lutra in the mid-2010s to counter traditional Swords Dance Mew sets—particularly the Hyper Beam variant—and greatly departs from the traditional sweeper set. Once in against opposing Mew, use Thunder Wave and Reflect first as it sets up Swords Dance, use Soft-Boiled if needed to stay healthy, and, finally, use Transform. This sequence makes your Mew into the traditional sweeper set with the bonus of Reflect protection and an opposing Mew that can become fully paralyzed. If you make your Mew transform before its target reaches +6, it can use Swords Dance again to both boost itself and lower its target's Speed under paralysis. The Reflect sweeper set, unfortunately, ruins it plans, stalling it out by taking advantage of Transform's 5 PP. This set will also result in a stalemate with fellow Transform Mew, possibly resulting in an endless battle. Worse yet, its lack of offensive threat means the opponent can easily switch to another Pokemon.</p>"
