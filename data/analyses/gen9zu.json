    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Charizard has Dragon Dance and Swords Dance in its arsenal for setting up without sacrificing half of its HP, but Charizard's Attack isn't amazing without multiple boosts, so Charizard needs teams to be significantly worn down before it can sweep. Solar Power makes Charizard a capable sun attacker, though Charizard is worn down quickly by Stealth Rock and the ability's recoil, and it faces competition from Scovillain as a sun sweeper. All-out attacker Charizard can run Focus Blast for greater damage against Rock-types and Snorlax but Scorching Sands has reliable accuracy and lets Charizard fish for burns on these targets. Belly Drum Charizard can run Tera Ground to turn the tables on Rock-types and Electric-types, and the boost in power to Earthquake lets Charizard reliably OHKO Regirock and Naclstack. Tera Dark on Belly Drum Charizard can protect Charizard from moves affected by Prankster coming from foes like Grafaiai and Sableye.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Jolteon requires little chip damage to revenge kill Charizard, and Choice Specs Jolteon can OHKO Charizard outright. Choice Scarf Electric-types like Magneton and Rotom-C also have super effective STAB moves to revenge kill Charizard with less chip damage, and they also gain momentum against it with their pivot moves. Grafaiai, Sneasel, and Mismagius are strong attackers faster than Charizard, but few revenge killers can switch into it safely or repeatedly. Floatzel is unique as a fast physical revenge killer that doesn't fear burns thanks to Water Veil.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Regirock is quite difficult for Charizard to break on its own, and still threatens Charizard even when it is burned. Lycanroc outspeeds Charizard and can pick off Flame Charge variants with Accelerock. Naclstack is an excellent wall to all-out attacker Charizard thanks to Recover, Purifying Salt shielding it from burns, and great bulk with Eviolite, but Belly Drum Charizard can OHKO it with a +6 Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Snorlax can use all-out attacker Charizard as an opportunity to set up, and it doesn't mind damage or burns thanks to Rest. Muk dislikes burns but can take repeated hits from Charizard and wear it down with Poison Jab and Knock Off. Fire-weak speical walls like Articuno and Cryogonal can become a pain for Charizard to deal with if they Terastallize.</p> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Lanturn only minds burns cutting into its passive recovery, and it can gain momentum from Charizard with Volt Switch, threaten to spread burns with Scald, and heal away damage with Rest.</p>",

      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Charizard's high Speed, great Special Attack, and unique offensive and defensive typing make it a great all-out attacker, checking many common Grass-types like Whimsicott and Shaymin. Charizard's Hurricane is one of its strongest attacks and has few common resistances. Flamethrower has more reliable accuracy than Hurricane, destroys Steel-types like Magneton and Orthworm that can otherwise handle Hurricane, and melts Ice-types like Glastrier. Scorching Sands covers Regirock and Lanturn, lets Charizard fish for burns, and is a more accurate move than Hurricane against foes like Typhlosion. Will-O-Wisp punishes physical attackers like Snorlax and Regirock that would otherwise try to take advantage of Charizard. Tera Ground stops fast Electric-types like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Magneton from taking advantage of Charizard with Volt Switch and flips its major 4x Rock weakness into a resistance to better handle Regirock and Sandaconda. Offensively, Tera Ground gives Charizard great odds to 2HKO Lanturn and always 3HKO defensive Muk after Stealth Rock chip.</p> <p>Charizard appreciates pivots like Jolteon and Whimsicott bringing it in safely on Pokemon that check them like Orthworm and Magneton; Charizard also benefits from these teammates checking Water-types like Floatzel, Lanturn, and Clawitzer that it otherwise struggles with. Regirock is a great teammate for Charizard, as it can check Snorlax for Charizard and is an even sturdier wall to the threats Charizard burns with Will-O-Wisp. Grass-type partners like Virizion, Rotom-C, and Dipplin cover Charizard's weaknesses and are complemented by Charizard handling Whimsicott. Charizard is a great switch-in against Weezing's Will-O-Wisp for Hisuian Sneasel and Passimian, while they threaten one of Charizard's biggest checks in Regirock.</p>"

      "Belly Drum": {
        "description": "<p>After a Belly Drum, Charizard becomes a deadly sweeper capable of OHKOing most Pokemon that don't resist Acrobatics. Even physical walls like Weezing and Sandslash are KOed by +6 Acrobatics after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake wrecks bulky Pokemon that resist Acrobatics like Magneton, and at +6, Charizard's Earthquake OHKOes even Regirock after Stealth Rock damage and Naclstack. Flame Charge makes Charizard harder to revenge kill by fast Pokemon like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Rotom, and at +6, it is likely to OHKO Orthworm after Stealth Rock damage. Sitrus Berry restores some of Charizard's health given that Stealth Rock and Belly Drum both take 50% of its HP, and it easily allows Charizard to consume its item and maximize damage from Acrobatics. Tera Flying boosts Acrobatics, allowing Charizard to reliably OHKO physical walls like Sandaconda and take neutral damage from Aqua Jet users like Floatzel and Hisuian Qwilfish that can revenge kill it.</p> <p>Belly Drum Charizard usually has just one chance to sweep, so it primarily features on hyper offense teams built around fast-paced setup sweepers. Charizard benefits immensely from teammates that set entry hazards, enabling it to OHKO foes like Sandaconda and Regirock, both of which could otherwise survive its onslaught; offensive teammates like Lycanroc and Primeape can reliably set Stealth Rock, and Orthworm and Hisuian Qwilfish can set Spikes for Charizard. Sandslash is an excellent partner for Charizard, as it can set up hazards, remove hazards with Rapid Spin, and check Rock- and Electric-types for Charizard. Parting Shot users like Grafaiai and Alolan Persian can weaken foes and ease Charizard's time setting up. Memento users like Mismagius and Whimsicott can put Charizard in a good position to sweep by debuffing foes. Offensive pivots like Mesprit and Whimsicott can bring Charizard into favorable matchups against Pokemon they lure in like Orthworm and Articuno. Other physical attackers like Brute Bonnet, Glastrier, and Sneasel can break holes in teams so that Charizard can clean up afterwards, and they all appreciate its great Speed and potential to sweep.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Magneton secures itself a place in the ZU metagame by virtue of its excellent power, a typing that is useful both offensively and defensively, and its ability to reliably pivot against many teams. Magneton's Steel typing is very rare in ZU, and it can hold Eviolite to shore up its mediocre bulk. This gives it a unique niche as a bulky pivot that provides a rare form of defensive utility while still hitting quite hard. Alternatively, Choice item sets are effective offensive threats thanks to Magneton's excellent STAB combination and great ability in Analytic, which can situationally boost its already good power even further. Magneton's Steel-type STAB moves are very threatening to most of the tier's Ground-types, which allows all sets to pivot reliably against many teams. However, Magneton's bulk is very poor, which prevents Choice item sets from providing much defensive utility, and Eviolite sets are simply not as threatening as their Choice item counterparts. Magneton's Steel typing also saddles it with unsavory weaknesses to Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks; the first two are especially problematic, as Magneton is slower than most of the tier's Fire- and Fighting-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A bulkier spread on the Eviolite set can work if you want to focus on Magneton's ability to take hits; if choosing to invest into bulk, dipping below 136 Speed EVs with a Modest nature is not advised, as Magneton will become slower than Brute Bonnet. The Choice Specs set could choose Tera Fighting with Tera Blast to 2HKO Snorlax after Stealth Rock without having to take itself out due to recoil, but pivoting out of them with Volt Switch is generally more effective, and they are greatly pressured by Steel Beam anyway. More defensively oriented Tera types, such as Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost, can be considered, as they give Magneton a Fighting resistance while turning its other weaknesses into neutralities. Thunder Wave over Tera Blast on Eviolite sets is a decent option to spread paralysis, but most Magneton switch-ins don't mind being paralyzed that much or are outright immune to the move. Metal Sound is an additional option on the Eviolite set that lets Magneton break through Dipplin and Snorlax, but it is overall niche compared to the other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Lanturn</strong>: Volt Absorb Lanturn is one of the only Pokemon that doesn't care about Magneton's STAB attacks at all; even an Analytic-boosted Steel Beam doesn't hit it all that hard. It also blocks Volt Switch thanks to Volt Absorb and can use Magneton as an opportunity to pivot safely to a teammate or spread burns with Scald. It does have to watch out for Tera Blast Grass, however.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Snorlax and Muk are decent checks to Magneton due to their ability to sponge its main STAB attacks. Steel Beam's immense power pressures even them, however, and neither of them prevent Magneton from pivoting out of the bad matchup with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types, such as Sandaconda and Sandslash block Volt Switch from Magneton and threaten to OHKO it with their STAB moves. They are not true switch-ins, however, as Magneton's Analytic boosted Steel-type STAB moves are still greatly threatening to them.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Charizard, Typhlosion, Magmortar, and Pyroar can OHKO Magneton with their STAB moves, and they are all faster than variants lacking a Choice Scarf. They also resist Magneton's Steel-type STAB moves, but none of them are true switch-ins due to their inability to block Volt Switch or reliably switch into Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type coverage</strong>: Fighting-types such as Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel threaten to revenge kill Magneton; Choice Scarf Passimian is even faster than Choice Scarf Magneton. Additionally, common Fighting-type coverage from the likes of Orthworm, Regirock, and Naclstack prevents Magneton from comfortably dealing with them one-on-one depending on what coverage move it is locked into. None of them can directly switch in, however.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Magneton's Steel typing makes it an excellent offensive answer to common Pokemon like Mesprit, Grafaiai, and Hisuian Qwilfish, giving it plenty of opportunities to switch in, attack, and pivot out. Most Ground-type Pokemon like Sandaconda and Sandslash that would otherwise block Magneton's Volt Switch cannot reliably switch into Magneton's Analytic-boosted Flash Cannon and avoid being KOed by a follow-up Flash Cannon. Analytic makes Magneton painful to switch around; it's also complemented by Magneton's many resistances and solid bulk when holding Eviolite. Tera Blast Grass enhances Magneton's coverage, enabling it to punish troublesome Electric-immune foes like Lanturn and Ground-types. Tera Fairy helps give Magneton a Fighting resist against Pokemon like Passimian and Virizion, while being able to hit them and other checks like Virizion and Dipplin for big damage. Tera Flying also eases Magneton's otherwise poor matchups against Fighting-types, and it turns its 4x Ground weakness into an immunity to make it less vulnerable to Ground-types like Sandslash and Sandaconda; although a Spikes immunity can help Magneton as a pivot, the Stealth Rock weakness is a huge hindrance and should normally be used late game to avoid this. Even without Terastallizing, Tera Blast is a decent standalone attack that hits Jolteon and Lanturn harder than Flash Cannon would. 84 Speed allows you to outrun Defensive Pivot Mesprit, with rest in bulk giving it more longevity.</p> <p>VoltTurn teams welcome Magneton as a strong offensive pivot that adds to their defensive backbone with its Steel typing. Other pivots like Passimian and Floatzel can create cores with Magneton and cause opponents to end up lost in the vortex. Strong wallbreakers like Brute Bonnet and Glastrier appreciate Magneton bringing them in safely with Volt Switch, and they have the bulk and power to answer problematic Ground-types for Magneton. Volt Absorb Lanturn walls Magneton and prevents it from pivoting with Volt Switch, so Magneton relies on Grass-type partners like Virizion and Lurantis to put pressure on it. Specially defensive Pokemon like Regirock and Snorlax are excellent answers to Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion that threaten Magneton. Magneton cannot afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots given the greater bulk provided by Eviolite, so it often ends up worn down by entry hazards; hazard removers like Lurantis and Sandslash can mitigate Magneton's vulnerability to this as it pivots in and out, and they appreciate Magneton checking threats to them like Mesprit and Braviary. Psychic-weak Pokemon like Passimian and Weezing appreciate Magneton checking Mesprit for them. Magneton's Steel typing similarly gives it opportunities to switch in and threaten Articuno out as well, which is appreciated by Ice-weak teammates such as Brute Bonnet. Mesprit and Mismagius appreciate Magneton pressuring Hisuian Qwilfish, which they otherwise struggle against. Physical attackers like Passimian and Brute Bonnet benefit from Magneton threatening Weezing, one of their most significant checks, and they support Magneton in return by threatening special walls like Snorlax for it.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Magneton is one of the most feared wallbreakers in the entire tier. Many teams are completely incapable of safely switching into Magneton thanks to its great STAB combination and access to Analytic, which amps up its power even further. Volt Switch complements Magneton nicely, as it is still quite powerful and allows Magneton to keep up momentum for its team. Magneton is generally quite good at pivoting, as many of the Pokemon immune to Electric, such as Sandslash and Sandaconda, fear Magneton's Steel-type STAB moves. Steel Beam is a monstrously powerful attack that is capable of hitting several notable power benchmarks, including OHKOing Sandaconda and Regirock so they can't KO Magneton back. While the massive recoil damage prevents it from being a staple attack, it gives a teammate free entry into battle should Magneton take itself out due to recoil. Tera Steel is preferred to jack up the power of Flash Cannon and Steel Beam even more, allowing the former to reliably 2HKO Jolteon and specially defensive Mesprit and the latter to 2HKO Snorlax. However, Tera Blast with Tera Grass allows Magneton to threaten standard checks such as Lanturn and various Ground-types with high damage while also becoming resistant to their STAB moves. Analytic allows Magneton to hit switch-ins much harder than it would be able to otherwise, which has great synergy with its threatening wallbreaking profile as well as Volt Switch. It also boosts its power should it have to take a hit before moving, which can be useful versus weak moves that Magneton resists, such as STAB moves from Mesprit and Farigiraf. However, such situations should generally be avoided due to Magneton's middling bulk. A Timid nature is recommended in order to outrun Timid Farigiraf.</p> <p>Choice Specs Magneton fits well on teams ranging from offense to balance teams due to its ability to act as a strong wallbreaker and a reliable pivot. Magneton's toolkit is appreciated by a variety of offensive teammates. Magneton's power is intimidating, but special walls such as Snorlax can check it. Teammates with powerful Fighting-type coverage, such as Passimian and Regirock, are good teammates, as are Grass-types, such as Dipplin, Virizion, and Brute Bonnet. Their ability to threaten Ground-types that might try to absorb Magneton's Electric-type STAB moves while still being able to break through standard special walls is very useful for Magneton, and they can also switch into annoying Ground-types, such as Sandaconda and Sandslash. Magneton, in return, can bring them in safely with Volt Switch and threaten physical walls such as Weezing and Orthworm. Switch-ins to Fire-types are also needed, as Magneton is easily revenge killed by foes such as Charizard, Typhlosion, and Pyroar. Bulky Water- and Rock-types, such as Lanturn and Regirock, are therefore good teammates. Faster, frailer partners also appreciate Magneton's wallbreaking and pivoting capabilities; Passimian, Floatzel, and Grafaiai appreciate Magneton threatening to break down defensive cores and bringing them in safely with Volt Switch. The first three can also form a pivoting core with it, while Passimian and Grafaiai can also use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from specially defensive Magneton checks, making them even more vulnerable to chip damage. On a related note, Magneton also benefits significantly from entry hazards being on the opponent's side of the field, as several of its bulkier checks, such as Snorlax, do not normally hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Stealth Rock setters such as Mesprit, Sandaconda, and Regirock can set up the hazard reliably to assist Magneton's wallbreaking capabilities, and they are generally not significantly threatened by Magneton's bulky checks. Spikes setters such as Hisuian Qwilfish and Orthworm also work well. Teams utilizing Magneton require additional preparation for Lanturn, which is one of the only Pokemon in the tier that switches into Magneton with impunity and largely prevents it from performing its role as a wallbreaking pivot unless Magneton is packing Tera Grass. Dedicated Lanturn answers such as the aforementioned Grass-types as well as specially bulky teammates such as Cryogonal and Snorlax make for good teammates as a result.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf turns Magneton into an effective revenge killer and general anti-offense Pokemon, as it outruns the entire unboosted metagame bar Jolteon. It also has a limited, but still notable, defensive profile, and its ability to pivot brings a lot of utility to the table. Volt Switch allows Magneton to keep up momentum for its team and effectively pivot. Steel Beam allows Magneton to wallbreak should the need arise and hits extremely hard with an Analytic boost. However, the massive recoil makes it a situational attack. Tera Steel allows Magneton to power up Flash Cannon and Steel Beam significantly. On the other hand, Tera Blast Grass allows Magneton to pressure Lanturn and Ground-types such as Sandaconda and Sandslash with more confidence, allowing it to pivot more reliably against teams with these threats or to lure them in and KO them outright. It also gives Magneton a Ground resistance, further improving its matchup versus the aforementioned Ground-types. A Timid nature is required so Magneton can outrun Whimsicott and Floatzel. Analytic allows Magneton to pick up several KOs, such as 2HKOing Sandaconda with Flash Cannon on the switch and doing the same to Orthworm with Thunderbolt and Lanturn with Tera Blast Grass.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Magneton is a good choice for many bulky offense and outright offensive teams. Magneton is the slowest viable Choice Scarf user, and it is unsuitable for revenge killing Speed-boosting sweepers, such as Oricorio-F and Agility Braviary, and other Choice Scarf users, such as Passimian, Floatzel, and Typhlosion. Other ways of taking care of these threats are therefore necessary. Prankster Encore users like Whimsicott, Grafaiai, and Sableye can greatly irritate and deter setup from the aforementioned setup threats, while the first two can form a pivoting core with Magneton. Meanwhile, defensive checks to the other Choice Scarf users, such as Sandaconda and Weezing for the former, and Lanturn for the last two, serve to greatly assist Magneton. Magneton can help these teammates out by bringing them into battle safely with Volt Switch and revenge killing unboosted offensive foes for them. Magneton also benefits from teammates that can effectively take down Lanturn and problematic Ground-types. Strong Grass-types, such as Virizion, Brute Bonnet, and Alolan Exeggutor, can switch into and pressure these foes. Magneton's tendency to force these threats to switch in also opens the door for them to enter battle via advantageous double switches. Other powerful wallbreakers, such as Glastrier, Sneasel, and Clawitzer, can also threaten these foes, while Magneton can bring them into battle safely with Volt Switch; the first three pressure special walls, such as Snorlax, that can sponge Magneton's attacks. Articuno is another notable teammate, as it forms a pivoting core with Magneton, threatens many of its checks with Freeze-Dry, and can annoy setup sweepers that Magneton cannot deal with via Haze.</p>"

Farigiraf can also easily enter on Weezing and start boosting.

Haze denies setup sweepers like Swords Dance Virizion. Taunt messes with defensive foes, denying attempts at setting entry hazards, spreading status, and recovery. Toxic Spikes messes with grounded Pokemon like Regirock and is great into bulkier teams. Rocky Helmet chips away at physical attackers using contact moves. Levitate lets Weezing hover over Spikes as well as Ground-type moves, letting it ignore Earthquake from Passimian and Sandaconda. Tera Steel makes Weezing resist Psychic-type attacks from Mespirit and Farigiraf, as well as a ton of other types like Flying, Normal, and Ice, making it a better check to many physical attackers like Dodrio and Glastrier. However, Tera Steel makes Weezing weak to Fighting-type attacks, reducing its effectiveness as a check to Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Passimian.</p> <p>Balance teams can tend to struggle against the many strong Fighting-types like Passimian, so Weezing is a great fit on these teams to take this pressure off its teammates.

Glastrier is another wallbreaker that balance teams struggle with, and Weezing can help its team dance around it. As Weezing can't take special hits very well, special walls like Lanturn and Orthworm are helpful for sponging the special attacks aimed at Weezing. Lanturn and Orthworm coincidentally form a powerful defensive core with Weezing, with Weezing covering Lanturn's Grass- and Ground-types for Lanturn and Fighting-types for Orthworm. In return, Lanturn blanket checks most special attackers for Weezing, particularly the Fire-types that can enter on a predicted Will-O-Wisp, as well as Magneton, which can use Weezing as an easy entry point. Snorlax appreciates Weezing's Fighting resistance and, in return, handle threatening special attackers like Mismagius and Rotom for it.

Jolteon's defensive utility with Volt Absorb and passable special bulk also makes it a situational switch-in to special attackers like Articuno and opposing Jolteon. However, the lacking power of its coverage moves causes it to struggle quite hard against specially defensive Pokemon like Snorlax as well as Ground-types like Sandaconda.

Tera Blast Ice and Tera Blast Fire both threaten Jolteon's Grass-type checks, with the former even targeting Ground-types. However, slotting Tera Blast makes Jolteon more reliant on team support to weaken its checks, and Terastalizing Jolteon into an Ice- or Fire-type requires entry hazard removal. Jolteon still gets walled by Grass-types if running Tera Blast Water.

Knock Off support works especially well with Jolteon, as its Volt Switch is able to put more pressure on Pokemon reliant on items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots for longevity, such as walls like Snorlax and Regirock. Wallbreakers like Glastrier benefit from Jolteon's Volt Switch and can capitalize on its checks. Grass- and Water-types like Shaymin, Virizion, and Poliwrath can switch in and force out the Ground-types Jolteon struggles against and delay its need to Terastallize. Similarly, checks to Grass-types like Hisuian Qwilfish and Articuno can similarly benefit Jolteon either through entry hazard and status support or through pivoting, respectively, allowing it to Terastallize as a later time. Deterrents to Snorlax like Regirock and Passimian are valuable for pressuring it to Terastalize sooner, which can be exploited by teammates like Hisuian Qwilfish and Hisuian Sneasel.</p>"

Volt Switch allows Jolteon to escape from walls like Snorlax and Regirock and maintain momentum for its team. Alluring Voice and Shadow Ball are Jolteon's strongest options for coverage against Ground-type foes; the former strikes at Fighting- and Dragon-types like Virizion and Alolan Exeggutor, while the latter pressures Ghost-types like Rotom. Despite Jolteon's frailty, Volt Absorb gives it limited defensive utility by making it a situational switch-in against Electric-types like opposing Jolteon and Magneton.</p> <p>While Choice Specs's enhanced power makes Jolteon more threatening as a pivot, it still struggles to tackle Ground- and Grass-types. Water- and Grass-types like Clawitzer, Virizion, and Whimsicott are great candidates to threaten these walls.

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Continuing its dramatic fall from grace from the higher tiers, Snorlax now establishes itself as a dominant force in ZU with its Curse sets. Thanks to its overall outstanding bulk and offensive versatility, Snorlax is quite difficult to stop once it gets stat boosts, even when factoring in Rest turns. Snorlax isn't just limited to late-game cleaning, either — it can also use said bulk and Thick Fat to function as a reliable sponge to common special attackers like the Oricorio-F, Jolteon, and Typhlosion while also being a good paralysis spreader with Body Slam. Walls comfortable switching into Body Slam also have to be aware of Heat Crash, limiting the consistency of its switch-ins. However, its low Speed and reliance on Rest or Protect for recovery make it quite easy to pressure it into passivity and cost momentum for its team. Snorlax's lack of resistances also makes it easy for Fighting-types like Virizion and Passimian to pressure it to Terastallize earlier than expected, which forces careful play to ensure a successful sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Snorlax's coverage move is quite flexible -— Crunch hits Ghost-types like Drifblim harder, while Heavy Slam more heavily pressures Tera Fairy setup sweepers like Mesprit. However, Crunch is usually noticeably weaker compared to Heat Crash, and Heavy Slam worsens its matchup against Steel-types and Tera Steel Pokemon and is still walled by Rock-types. Sleep Talk over Curse makes Snorlax more consistent as a special wall at the cost of its late-game potential. Heavy-Duty Boots is a notable alternative to Leftovers, allowing Snorlax to fare better against entry hazards and easing the need for hazard removal. However, Snorlax usually appreciates the passive recovery from Leftovers better. Offensive sets like Choice Band are usable to surprise the opposition but are held back by Snorlax's low Speed and giving up quite a lot of its bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Regirock and Naclstack are not particularly bothered by even a boosted Snorlax and can set up Stealth Rock or pressure it with repeated uses of Body Press, with the latter two even using it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Fighting-types like Virizion and Passimian can threaten huge damage on Snorlax with their Fighting-type STAB moves, though none of them particularly enjoy it Terastallizing to Fairy. Hisuian Sneasel can even threaten Snorlax even when the latter Terastallizes with its Poison-type STAB moves. Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage like Clawitzer, Glasterier, and Braviary can also pressure it into Terastallizing sooner than expected.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong physical wallbreakers like Glastrier, Dodrio, and Braviary can strike at Snorlax's initially lower physical bulk and cause it to use Rest sooner than expected.</p> <p><strong>Coil Sweepers</strong>: Orthworm can consistently keep up and eventually overpower Snorlax thanks to its Steel typing. While Sandaconda cannot outright beat Snorlax without critical hits, it can outlast Snorlax by PP stalling and can brush off status with Shed Skin.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Snorlax's Leftovers is an essential part for it to wall and sweep teams; Knock Off users like Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Dodrio endanger its chances of sweeping and follow up with strong STAB moves in their arsenals. Trick and Switcheroo users like Whimsicott, Grafaiai, and Mismagius can outright neuter Snorlax's sweeping potential with a Choice item, forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Snorlax hates taking residual damage, with common entry hazard setters like Orthworm and Sandaconda making it more difficult for Snorlax to sweep; the latter two can also rack up additional chip damage with Rocky Helmet. Status like burn and poison also forces Snorlax to use Rest, causing it to become more passive. Snorlax also can quickly get worn down by VoltTurn users like Mesprit, Whimsicott, and Jolteon as a switch-in to them, risking losing momentum against them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>STAB Body Slam not only functions as Snorlax's primary attacking move but also threatens incoming switch-ins like Hisuian Qwilfish and Passimian with the chance of paralysis. Heat Crash is a powerful coverage move that hits both Ghost-types like Rotom, Mismagius, and Sableye that would freely switch into Body Slam and Tera Steel users like Weezing and Mesprit. Rest fully restores Snorlax's health and removes existing status conditions at the expense of making it passive for two turns. Alternatively, Protect scouts for Choice-locked foes like Passimian and Rotom and racks up additional Leftovers recovery at the cost of being unable to remove status. Tera Fairy turns its Fighting weakness into a resistance and provides an immunity to Dragon-type moves from foes like Dipplin and Alolan Exeggutor. Tera Fairy Snorlax also benefits from Poison- and Steel-type moves being uncommon. Thick Fat strengthens its defensive profile by making it a consistent switch-in to Fire- and Ice-types like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Froslass.</p> <p>Snorlax excels mid- or late-game as a setup sweeper that can take advantage of Fighting-types and wallbreakers being worn down. Physical walls like Regirock shore up Snorlax's lower physical bulk and can provide entry hazards to wear down switch-ins like Hisuian Qwilfish and opposing Regirock. Choice item wallbreakers like Whimsicott and Jolteon can simulataneously provide wallbreaking and pivoting support for Snorlax to enter the field safely; they can help discourage physical walls like Hisuian Qwilfish from freely switching in. Poison-types like Weezing can help with Snorlax's weakness to Fighting-types and provide additional utility. Rock-types like Regirock and Naclstack can easily ward off anything Snorlax can do, so checks to them like Virizion, Shaymin, and Weezing are helpful to consistently force them out. Due to Snorlax's utility as a special wall and susceptibility to residual damage, hazard removers like Sandslash and Lurantis are critical in preventing Snorlax from being worn down by hazards; the lack of hazards make it far more consistent walling foes and sweeping throughout a game.</p>"

A more offensive EV spread using Hurricane can catch faster or more offensive Pokemon expecting to get the jump on Articuno off-guard, letting Articuno nail foes weak to Freeze-Dry like Brute Bonnet, Rock Blast Sandaconda, and Clawitzer while still maintaining its good bulk. However, Articuno is not very strong on its own and tends to be outclassed by other offensive pivots like Mesprit, Passsimian, and Whimsicott for their superior power, coverage, and utility from moves like Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo. Tera Ground alleviates Articuno's 4x Rock weakness and gives it an immunity to Electric to enable it to block Volt Switch, but it worsens Articuno's matchups against specially offensive Grass-types like Whimsicott, Calm Mind Virizion, and Alolan Exeggutor that it's meant to check.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types and Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Articuno's 4x Rock weakness makes Rock-type moves a huge threat to it. Regirock and Lycanroc can threaten out Articuno and use it as an opportunity to set up entry hazards. Naclstack cannot get frozen, can recover off chip damage from Articuno, and wears Articuno down with Salt Cure. Sandaconda and Virizion commonly run Rock-type coverage but must be wary of Articuno's Freeze-Dry and strong Hurricane.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Articuno depends on its Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid losing 50% of its HP to Stealth Rock as it switches in, so losing them hurts its longevity and pushes it to Terastallize. Mesprit is a common special attacker that can lure Articuno in and threaten to use Knock Off or give it a Choice item with Trick. Mismagius and Whimsicott respectively run Trick and Switcheroo.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Orthworm shrugs off attacks from Articuno, threatens it with its Steel-type STAB moves, and can set up Coil or entry hazards on it. Magneton is only chipped by Articuno's attacks, threatens it with its STAB moves, and can keep up momentum if Articuno switches out with its STAB Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Jolteon, Rotom, and Alolan Raichu resist Hurricane, threaten Articuno with their Electric-type STAB moves, and can gain momentum with Volt Switch. All three of the Electric-types can use setup moves to blow through Articuno.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Charizard and Typhlosion overcome Articuno's massive special bulk thanks to their super effective STAB attacks. Although Typhlosion resists Freeze-Dry, it prefers not to take damage in order to preserve the power of its Eruption.

Special attackers like Whimsicott and Shaymin struggle to break through Articuno on their own. Roost keeps Articuno healthy and lets it take repeated hits from special wallbreakers like Alolan Exeggutor and Clawitzer while stonewalling more passive Pokemon like Dipplin and Cryogonal. Freeze-Dry has the best coverage and reliability of any of Articuno's moves, nailing Grass- and Water-type special attackers like Arboliva and Lanturn. U-turn helps Articuno keep up momentum against wallbreakers that might switch in against it like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Magneton. Haze immediately removes boosts from special setup users like Mesprit and Farigiraf. Roar is an alternative to Haze that lets Articuno rack up residual damage from entry hazards, but it forces Articuno to move second and fails if the target is the last active member of its team. Tera Dragon helps Articuno beat Fire-types it struggles against like Charizard and Typhlosion. Tera Steel gives Articuno a Toxic immunity and lets it more reliably check attackers like Grafaiai, Alolan Exeggutor, and Farigiraf.</p> <p>Articuno is a great choice for balance teams in need of a specially defensive Pokemon. However, Articuno can also support more offensive teams thanks to U-turn enabling teammates like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Clawitzer. Pokemon vulnerable to Grass-types and special attackers such as Sandaconda and Dipplin greatly appreciate Articuno's support, and they can assist it against threatening physical attackers like Passimian and Floatzel, respectively. Articuno can form cores with other pivots like Passimian, Floatzel, and Jolteon. Articuno's 4x weakness to Rock is a major vulnerability that can be covered by partners like Virizion, Orthworm, and Sandslash. Entry hazard setting partners like Naclstack, Regirock, and Hisuian Qwilfish complement Articuno running Roar, as Articuno racks up hazard damage with Roar, forces Dipplin out even if it Terastallizes, and pressures other Pokemon vulnerable to hazards like Snorlax and Regirock to switch in. Knock Off users like Mesprit, Grafaiai, and Passimian support Articuno if it runs Roar to rack up entry hazard chip damage by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes dependent on them to avoid hazard damage such as opposing Articuno, Sandslash, and Charizard. Articuno struggles with Fire-types like Typhlosion and Charizard, so Snorlax and Regirock partner well with it by bolstering against these bad matchups. Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton can respectively set up on Articuno and break through it, so teammates like Virizion, Passimian, and Virizion can threaten them for Articuno.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Choice Specs Typhlosion is an insanely powerful special attacker in a tier without much in the way of sturdy Fire-resistant Pokemon. Much of its power comes from its move Eruption, which has unparalleled strength with Typhlosion at full health and can OHKO most neutral targets such as Mesprit and Passimian. With Typhlosion's Speed tier, it outspeeds much of the unboosted metagame, meaning that it can frequently come in and pick up KOs. However, Choice Specs Typhlosion struggles against faster Pokemon such as Grafaiai and Choice Scarf users like Passimian that can damage it before it moves and limit its power; it's also checked by the few Pokemon that can take on its Eruption reliably such as Snorlax and Poliwrath, necessitating a team to have good answers to them such as Regirock and Dipplin, respectively. On the other hand, the Choice Scarf set misses out on some OHKOs against targets like Mesprit, but it outspeeds common Choice Scarf users like Rotom and Passimian and fast attackers like Sneasel and Jolteon. Typhlosion's Eruption is limited by Stealth Rock as well as other damaging entry hazards, meaning it requires hazard removal support from the likes of Sandslash.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots might seem tempting to ignore entry hazards and preserve the power of Typhlosion's Eruption, but this comes with the trade-offs of sacrificing vital power or Speed on Typhlosion, leaving it otherwise outclassed by Charizard once Eruption is no longer at full power. An alternative Tera type like Ground might seem interesting for Typhlosion to catch fast revenge killers like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Magneton off guard while powering up its Scorching Sands. However, Typhlosion should prioritize using its Fire-type moves to their fullest, as it without Tera Fire, it will otherwise miss out on KOs such as Choice Scarf Mesprit after Stealth Rock damage, Jolteon, and Mismagius.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Stealth Rock, Spikes, and even Toxic Spikes ruin Typhlosion's stand-out power and the reason to use it. Sticky Web leaves Typhlosion prone to being outsped.</p> <p><strong>Special Sponges</strong>: Snorlax and Regirock can withstand Eruptions from Typhlosion. Typhlosion can deal significant damage to these Pokemon with Focus Blast, but the inconsistent accuracy and commitment of locking into a coverage move are hard on Typhlosion. Scorching Sands hits Lanturn for solid damage, but Typhlosion dislikes locking into it due to its low power and exploitability by foes immune to Ground such as Orthworm, Mesprit, and Rotom-C. Defensive Terastallization flips Articuno from easy prey for Typhlosion to a wall capable of burning through the low PP of Typhlosion's moves with Pressure.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune or Resistant to Fire</strong>: Typhlosion should prioritize using Eruption, so Pokemon immune to it and Pokemon that can tolerate it are a huge issue if Typhlosion is to keep its Eruptions powerful. Lanturn can pivot into Typhlosion's Fire-type moves and generate momentum with Flip Turn or Volt Switch. Charizard and Clawitzer can retaliate with a strong hit against Typhlosion to impair its power after they withstand one Tera Fire Choice Specs Eruption. Oricorio-F can boost its Special Defense with Quiver Dance and stall Typhlosion out of Eruptions with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Even chip damage wrecks the power of Eruption, and Typhlosion's lacking Defense and defensive typing leave it prone to being picked off once it's in range of Blaze. Aqua Jet from Hisuian Qwilfish and Floatzel is especially harmful to Typhlosion. Even otherwise easy targets like Brute Bonnet and Hitmontop can clip Eruption's power to make Typhlosion easier to handle.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Specs Typhlosion is speedy but still slower than Grafaiai, Jolteon, and Mismagius as well as Choice Scarf users like Mesprit, Rotom, and Passimian.

Fire Blast namely gives better odds to OHKO threats such as Sandslash and Passimian. Focus Blast gives Typhlosion a chance to 2HKO Snorlax, which can easily take Fire-type attacks, as well as being its strongest move against Rock-types like Regirock and Naclstack. Scorching Sands targets Fire-types such as opposing Typhlosion and Pyroar as well as Lanturn, and it is a more accurate option to threaten Rock-types.

Typhlosion appreciates VoltTurn support that can force in walls to get nuked by it, such as Articuno, Lanturn, and Mesprit as well as the aforementioned Jolteon and Rotom-C. Typhlosion has trouble breaking through Fire-resistant Pokemon, including Snorlax, Lanturn, and Appletun, which makes counters to these threats such as Orthworm and Articuno attractive. Entry hazard removal and deterrence is also appreciated from Pokemon such as Sandslash and Hattrem to keep Typhlosion at full health as long as possible. Healing Wish Pokemon like Shaymin and Mesprit can give Typhlosion a second chance at full health Eruptions later in the match.

Fast Pokemon like Jolteon, Grafaiai, and Choice Scarf Mesprit don't require much chip damage before they're at risk of being KOed by Eruption. Fire Blast lets Typhlosion keep up a good damage output once Eruption is no longer at maximum power, and it still threatens to OHKO foes like Sneasel, Virizion, and Whimsicott. Focus Blast 2HKOes Fire-resistant Pokemon like Regirock and Naclstack, and it is Typhlosion's strongest coverage move against Snorlax. Scorching Sands covers Fire-types like Pyroar and opposing Typhlosion, wears down Lanturn, has greater accuracy against Rock-types, and can spread burns with a little bit of luck. Tera Fire enables Typhlosion to OHKO Choice Scarf Mesprit with Eruption after Stealth Rock damage. Flash Fire powers up Typhlosion's STAB moves to make it an even more dangerous cleaner if it can switch in on a Fire-type move from Charizard, opposing Choice-locked Typhlosion, or Will-O-Wisp from Weezing and Spiritomb, although Typhlosion often doesn't switch into most Pokemon if it wants to preserve the power of Eruption.

Lanturn could use Thunder Wave for more reliable paralysis spreading, but it cannot make room for Thunder Wave without its moveset leaving it extremely passive. Leftovers is an alternative to Heavy-Duty Boots to extend Lanturn's longevity and make it less dependent on Rest for recovery, opening up options for different moves; Protect synergizes with Leftovers and allows Lanturn to scout attacks from Choice item users like Typhlosion and Mesprit, and Ice Beam leaves Lanturn less passive against Whimsicott and Dipplin. However, Lanturn will be more easily worn down by entry hazards as a pivot without Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Lanturn's defensive coverage limits it from dealing significant damage to Grass-types, most of which threaten it super effectively. Rotom-C is especially dangerous as a Volt Switch pivot that has a super effective secondary STAB move against Lanturn. Nasty Plot Rotom-C, Virizion, and Dipplin can use Lanturn as a chance to set up, though they should be wary of potential status. Brute Bonnet and Whimsicott can use Lanturn as an opportunity to switch in, but they're also challenged by status; Brute Bonnet especially dislikes burns, while Whimsicott is particularly hindered by paralysis. Slow and specially offensive Pokemon such as Alolan Exeggutor, Appletun, and Arboliva are the least impaired by Lanturn's status spreading. Shaymin can annoy Lanturn repeatedly and rely on Natural Cure to clear any status it takes from Lanturn.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Lanturn's passivity means it often doesn't do much other than threaten to status specially defensive Pokemon, though many cannot prevent it from pivoting out.

Volt Switch generates momentum and doesn't trigger contact effects from Rocky Helmet. Flip Turn is a slightly weaker pivoting option with the trade-off of working against Jolteon, opposing Lanturn with Volt Absorb, and Ground-types like Sandaconda and Sandslash. Scald should always be run alongside Volt Switch; Lanturn uses it to threaten Pokemon that would block Volt Switch and burn physical attackers such as Brute Bonnet and Virizion that might try to switch in. Discharge pairs with Flip Turn and has the added benefit of spreading paralysis to punish setup sweepers and faster Pokemon such as Oricorio-F, Whimsicott, and Mesprit. Lanturn appreciates Discharge not forcing it to switch out when attacking Pokemon weak to Electric such as Poliwrath and Braviary. Rest is Lanturn's best method of recovery, and Sleep Talk helps Lanturn be less passive while it's asleep. Heavy-Duty Boots is especially helpful, as Lanturn pivots in frequently. Volt Absorb lets Lanturn reliably answer Electric-types such as Jolteon, Magneton, and Vikavolt. Water Absorb is an option for Lanturn to thwart Water-type attacks from Floatzel, but Lanturn answers fewer specially offensive Water-types beyond Clawitzer compared to Electric-types. Tera Dragon gives Lanturn few weaknesses as it enhances Lanturn's capacity to answer special attackers with super effective coverage such as Typhlosion and Charizard.

Other Poison-types like Hisuian Qwilfish and Weezing can check problematic Grass-types like Brute Bonnet and Virizion, and they benefit from Lanturn bringing them in safely while wearing down these targets. Strong wallbreakers like Typhlosion, Glastrier, and Brute Bonnet gain more opportunities to tear open holes in foes thanks to Lanturn's pivoting. Lanturn inviting in Snorlax can benefit Fighting-type partners such as Virizion and Hitmontop. Lanturn is especially appreciative of partners like Charizard, Oricorio-F, and Sneasel that threaten Grass-types that would pressure it, and it can return the favor by checking Electric-types for Charizard and Oricorio-F and Fire-types for Sneasel. Fire-weak Pokemon like Whimsicott and Orthworm especially benefit from Lanturn as a stopgap to Charizard and Typhlosion, and they match Lanturn's help by defensively answering Ground-types like Sandaconda and Sandslash.

    "overview": "<p>Hisuian Qwilfish is a versatile Pokemon in SV ZU thanks to its great movepool and unique defensive traits. Hisuian Qwilfish is an excellent check to threats like Mesprit, Virizion, and Mismagius thanks to its defensive typing and solid bulk backed by Eviolite. Intimidate and few weaknesses make it a blanket answer to threats like Grafaiai, Whimsicott, and Brute Bonnet. Hisuian Qwilfish's good defensive profile creates many opportunities for utility sets to set Spikes against common Pokemon such as Mesprit, Brute Bonnet, and Whimsicott. Its setup opportunities against common Pokemon also apply for offensive sets with Swords Dance, which threaten to sweep faster Pokemon like Charizard and Typhlosion thanks to Aqua Jet as they break defensive cores that depend on Grass-types like Dipplin and Arboliva. However, Hisuian Qwilfish is held back by its lack of longevity paired with its middling natural bulk, making it dependent on its Eviolite, and its Ground weakness leaves it vulnerable to Sandaconda and Sandslash as well as coverage moves from Passimian and Charizard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance Hisuian Qwilfish can use Scale Shot to boost its Speed to evade revenge killing attempts by faster Pokemon like Jolteon, Whimsicott, and Choice Scarf Passimian, but Aqua Jet doesn't require an additional turn of setup. Poison Point doesn't activate Defiant on Passimian and Braviary and can punish U-turn users like Mesprit and Whimsicott, but Intimidate offers more general and reliable defensive utility against physical attackers. Agility can be used on Swords Dance sets to make Hisuian Qwilfish less reliant on Aqua Jet but requires it to spend additional turns setting up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Sandaconda is difficult for Hisuian Qwilfish to beat outright, and Sandslash can remove any entry hazards it sets. However, Sandslash can be worn down by repeated hits. Ground-type STAB moves from these Pokemon as well as Ground-type coverage from Passimian can efficiently dispatch Hisuian Qwilfish.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Orthworm is immovable to Hisuian Qwilfish and can use it to set up its own entry hazards, Coil, or Iron Defense. Regirock dislikes Toxic, but it can wall Swords Dance Hisuian Qwilfish or use Tera to deny Toxic while chipping away at Hisuian Qwilfish with Body Press. Weezing is immune to Toxic and can burn Swords Dance Hisuian Qwilfish.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Magneton takes little to no damage from utility Hisuian Qwilfish's moves and can use it to come in and fire off powerful attacks. Typhlosion, Clawitzer, and Alolan Exeggutor deal immense damage to Hisuian Qwilfish, but they must be mindful of their health to avoid being finished off by the Swords Dance set.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Glastrier and Floatzel threaten to cut through Hisuian Qwilfish's underwhelming bulk, especially if they've been unaffected by Intimidate. Sneasel is unaffected by Intimidate, and Passimian is even strengthened by it. However, several of these Pokemon do not enjoy switching into Barb Barrage. Hisuian Sneasel notably resists Hisuian Qwilfish's STAB combination and can easily use the specially defensive set as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Hisuian Qwilifsh lacks recovery, so entry hazards from opposing setters like Orthworm and Regirock can quickly wear it down. Burns spread by Charizard and Weezing chip away at Hisuian Qwilfish and make it far more passive, and Swords Dance sets are especially cramped by them.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hisuian Qwilfish's Eviolite-boosted bulk, Intimidate, and great typing make it an amazing defensive utility Pokemon. Thanks to its typing, Hisuian Qwilfish can check specially offensive setup sweepers like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Mismagius thanks to its immunity to Stored Power and lack of weaknesses to common special coverage moves like Draining Kiss and Dazzling Gleam. Barb Barrage is a great STAB move for Hisuian Qwilfish, as it wears down Pokemon with its high chance to poison and powers up when its targets are poisoned, and walls like Regirock and Sandslash do not appreciate being poisoned. Barb Barrage is great against the Grass-types Hisuian Qwilfish checks, such as Virizion and Dipplin, as well as Fairy-type Pokemon like Whimsicott and Tera Fairy Mesprit and Mismagius. Crunch is a stronger STAB move for foes that aren't yet poisoned and has great coverage against other specially offensive threats like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Mismagius. Hisuian Qwilfish's excellent defensive profile gives it plenty of opportunities to set up Spikes as it threatens out Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Dipplin. Toxic more reliably statuses foes compared to Barb Barrage, and Toxic poison is deadlier to walls like Regirock and Sableye. Taunt lets Hisuian Qwilfish shut down opposing defensive Pokemon like Sandaconda, Orthworm, and Weezing to prevent them from recovering or supporting their teams. Haze removes boosts from specially offensive setup sweepers that Hisuian Qwilfish checks, such as Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Virizion. Intimidate lets Hisuian Qwilfish work as a stopgap to physical attackers like Grafaiai and Swords Dance Virizion. Tera Dragon lends Hisuian Qwilfish new resistances to Electric and Fire to make it a better check to special attackers like Rotom-C and Typhlosion.</p> <p>Hisuian Qwilfish fits on bulky offensive teams looking to compress a solid defensive backbone and entry hazard setter into one slot. Offensive Pokemon like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Jolteon are great beneficiaries of Spikes set by Hisuian Qwilfish, as common checks to them like Snorlax and Regirock are prone to being overwhelmed by residual damage. Roar Articuno and Dragon Tail Dipplin can put Spikes set by Hisuian Qwilfish to good use by quickly racking up residual damage. Sandslash's Earthquake and Rapid Spin are very threatening to Hisuian Qwilfish, so good checks to Sandslash like Virizion, Dipplin, and Orthworm help Hisuian Qwilfish, and Spiritomb can spinblock for Hisuian Qwilfish as a bonus. Grass-types in particular, such as Whimsicott, Virizion, and Shaymin, make great partners for Hisuian Qwilfish by covering its sole weakness to Ground. Hisuian Qwilfish can struggle against specially offensive foes like Jolteon, Typhlosion, and Charizard, so special walls like Snorlax, Regirock, and Lanturn can help deal with these foes while appreciating the residual damage that Hisuian Qwilfish spreads. Several physical attackers like Hisuian Sneasel and Sneasel ignore Intimidate while others like Passimian and Braviary can benefit from it, so physical sponges like Dipplin, Regirock, Weezing, and Sandaconda cover these foes for Hisuian Qwilfish. Teammates such as Passimian and Regirock appreciate Hisuian Qwilfish for checking special attackers like Mesprit, Mismagius, and Farigiraf for them.</p>"

Hisuian Qwilfish's offensive STAB combination has excellent coverage, as it's only resisted by Hisuian Sneasel. Aqua Jet compensates for Hisuian Qwilfish's more middling Speed, picking off frail revenge killers like Jolteon, the aforementioned Hisuian Sneasel, and Sneasel. Aqua Jet's coverage is especially threatening to Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion and makes Hisuian Qwilfish a helpful revenge killer for them. Intimidate increases Hisuian Qwilfish's setup opportunities against physical attackers it neutralizes such as Snorlax and Virizion. Tera Water powers up Aqua Jet for more efficient cleaning, mitigates Ground-type attacks from the likes of Passimian and Sandaconda, and gives Hisuian Qwilfish a more comfortable defensive typing against Floatzel and Glastrier.</p> <p>Swords Dance Hisuian Qwilfish works well on offense teams as a sweeper capable of taking advantage of common Pokemon like Mesprit and Grafaiai to set up, and its immunity to Prankster Encore moves from Grafaiai and Whimsicott is a great asset to these teams; it can also fit on balance teams as a wallbreaker. Wallbreakers like Typhlosion, Magneton, and Floatzel can soften up teams for Hisuian Qwilfish to more easily clean up. Hisuian Qwilfish's Ground weakness means it benefits from teammates like Whimsicott, Virizion, and Glastrier that threaten Ground-types like Sandaconda and Sandslash. More defenisve partners like Orthworm, Articuno, and Dipplin can also handle the aforementioned Ground-types. Dipplin can also absorb Knock Off and Trick for Hisuian Qwilfish, which it appreciates given its dependence on Eviolite for its bulk. Entry hazard setters like Sandslash and Froslass support Hisuian Qwilfish by wearing down bulky Pokemon like Regirock and Snorlax to make breaking through them easier. Healing Wish support from teammates like Mesprit and Shaymin grants Hisuian Qwilfish a second chance to sweep. Hisuian Qwilfish appreciates hazard removal from partners such as Sandslash and Hitmontop to keep it healthier in the face of revenge killers like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel. Leads that use Taunt such as Froslass can also keep entry hazards from going up.</p>"

  "Sneasel": {
    "overview": "<p>With its blisteringly fast Speed and a deadly STAB combination, Sneasel carves a place for itself in ZU as a powerful wallbreaker and cleaner. STAB Knock Off makes Sneasel excellent at forcing progress, especially since the primary Knock Off absorber, Dipplin, fears its Ice-type attacks, and it outruns many already fast threats like Charizard, Mismagius, and Grafaiai. However, Sneasel's paper-thin defenses mean it crumples to most strong neutral attacks and, combined with its many weaknesses, give it near to no defensive utility outside of switching into Psychic-type attacks. Sneasel also can be left wanting in power and struggles to break past walls like Regirock and Orthworm. Choice Band sets don't have this problem but are vulnerable to entry hazards and very prediction reliant. Lastly, Sneasel is incredibly vulnerable to getting revenge killed by most Choice Scarf users in the tier, like Passimian, Grafaiai, and Typhlosion, as well as priority attacks such as Mach Punch from Hitmontop.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sneasel has no other options.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Sneasel greatly fears Fighting-types like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel. Most of them don't enjoy switching in on Sneasel's attacks, however, though Poliwrath resists Sneasel's STAB moves and doesn't take much damage from Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Sneasel's lack of bulk means that Choice Scarf users have an easy time outspeeding it and taking it out. All of Floatzel, Grafaiai, Passimian, and Mesprit can revenge kill Sneasel with ease.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physically bulky Pokemon like Regirock, Orthworm, and Weezing don't fear much from Sneasel and can force it out with status conditions or super effective attacks. However, since all three of them lack reliable recovery, and the former two hate losing Leftovers, Sneasel can slowly wear them down over a longer game. Glastrier also can take Sneasel on but hates losing its Heavy-Duty Boots. Snorlax can take a Knock Off well enough but doesn't appreciate losing its Leftovers either. All of them except Weezing also must be wary of Low Kick</p>",

        "description": "<p>Ice Shard lets Sneasel pick off weakened foes and faster attackers like Whimsicott and Jolteon as well as dance around priority like Mach Punch from Hitmonchan. Swords Dance lets Sneasel pick up OHKOs on Charizard and Dipplin and gives it an easier time cleaning up weakened teams, while Low Kick lets it threaten Orthworm, Regirock, and Glastrier more immediately. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Sneasel come in without taking damage from entry hazards, allowing it to come in many times over the course of a game. Tera Ice boosts Triple Axel and Ice Shard's power immensely, netting a 2HKO on Regirock and Weezing at +2, but does nothing to help Sneasel's terrible defensive typing. Tera Ghost flips Sneasel's Fighting weakness into an immunity, letting it blank Close Combat from revenge killers like Choice Scarf Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel, but it also makes Sneasel weak to Sucker Punch from Brute Bonnet.</p> <p>Sneasel's powerful Knock Off makes it an excellent pick on entry hazard stacking teams where teammates such as Hisuian Qwilfish and Orthworm help Sneasel push past bulkier foes like Magneton and Snorlax. Sneasel struggles to break past physically bulky foes like Regirock, Orthworm, and Weezing, so teammates that share these checks like Charizard, Mesprit, and Virizion, respectively, can team up to wear down said walls. Poliwrath notably takes little damage from Sneasel's STAB attacks, so teammates that handle it like Whimsicott and Shaymin are quite helpful. Physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Floatzel and Brute Bonnet also help wear walls down so Sneasel can sweep. Fighting-types like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel threaten Sneasel immensely, so defensive fallbacks like Weezing make for great teammates. Other defensive teammates such as Snorlax and Poliwrath help make up for Sneasel's lack of defenses, dealing with threats like Whimsicott, Typhlosion, and Floatzel for it. As Sneasel struggles to switch in directly, pivots like Jolteon, Passimian, Whimsicott, and Lanturn are all helpful in assisting Sneasel to hit the field safely. On more offensive teams, it can pair up with other setup sweepers like Oricorio-F and Mesprit to overwhelm the opposing team.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Sneasel has very strong STAB moves and a great Speed tier to spam them. A Choice Band gives Sneasel the immediate raw power to make quick offensive progress against bulky Pokemon like Orthworm and Regirock. Choice Band also makes Sneasel a more reliable revenge killer to offensive threats like Grafaiai, Nasty Plot Mesprit, and Virizion. Low Kick is Sneasel's strongest move against physically bulky Pokemon like Glastrier, Regirock, and Orthworm, which take neutral or resisted damage from its STAB moves, but its limited coverage and variable power make it a difficult option to lock into. Inner Focus is helpful for blocking Intimidate from Hisuian Qwilfish. Tera Ice cranks up the power of Sneasel's strongest STAB move to ice out bulkier Pokemon such as Tera Fairy Nasty Plot Mesprit and Weezing. Tera Ice also boosts Sneasel's priority to more effectively pick off Jolteon, Oricorio-F, and Whimsicott.</p> <p>Choice Band Sneasel has great immediate damage output, quickly cutting through teams with Triple Axel and making progress with Knock Off. Choice Band Sneasel's ability to lure in and remove Leftovers from Regirock makes it a great enabler to offensive Pokemon that struggle against it such as Charizard, Snorlax, and Oricorio-F, and it functions similarly against Orthworm to support Mesprit, Whimsicott, and Grafaiai. Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes creates excellent synergy with entry hazard setting Pokemon such as Hisuian Qwilfish and Orthworm. Choice Band Sneasel is vulnerable to being worn down by entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, so hazard removers like Sandslash and Lurantis are critical to maximizing Sneasel's offensive presence. Defensive pivots like Lanturn and Mesprit can bring Sneasel in safely in spite of its poor bulk and vulnerable defensive typing. While Sneasel resists Shadow Sneak and Sucker Punch from foes like Muk and Brute Bonnet, its frailty leaves it prone to strong and super effective priority users; Sandaconda and Weezing can check Passimian for Sneasel, and Lanturn and Poliwrath can check Floatzel. Choice Band Sneasel is fast but still struggles with revenge killers like Passimian, Choice Scarf Grafaiai, and Choice Scarf Typhlosion, which can be respectively handled by teammates like Orthworm, Weezing, and Regirock.</p>"

With Switcheroo to disrupt foes that otherwise give it issues, like Iron Defense Regirock, Hisuian Sneasel has the tools to position itself to wreak havoc. Swords Dance Hisuian Sneasel can utilize Trailblaze to become a devastatingly fast and powerful late-game cleaner. It does, however, have subpar bulk without Eviolite and can struggle at times to pick up KOs against premiere walls like Dipplin and Regirock if they use Terastallization.

Throat Chop provides Hisuian Sneasel a powerful attack to break past Ghost-types like Mismagius, as well as threatening big damage against Psychic-types like Farigiraf and Mesprit, even blocking Psychic Noise; Swords Dance is an alternative that gives Hisuian Sneasel the capacity to function as a setup sweeper after it has shed its item. Switcheroo is a big reason Choice item sets function so well, as it can disrupt common switch-ins like Sandslash immensely. Inner Focus prevents Hisuian Sneasel from being affected by Intimidate from the likes of Hisuian Qwilfish. Choice Band grants Hisuian Sneasel the damage output needed to pick up 2HKOs on notable foes like Dipplin and Mesprit; Choice Scarf sets, on the other hand, trade power for Speed, turning Hisuian Sneasel into the fastest late-game cleaner and revenge killer, which is useful against usually speedier foes like Jolteon and Whimsicott. Tera Fighting boosts Close Combat tremendously, with Choice Band sets being capable of OHKOing Farigiraf and Lanturn, while also removing Hisuian Sneasel's weakness to Ground. Tera Dark grants Hisuian Sneasel a useful immunity to Psychic while making Throat Chop far more difficult to stomach for foes like Mesprit. Tera Dark also blocks Prankster from affecting Hisuian Sneasel, turning foes like Sableye and the more niche Volbeat into setup fodder.</p> <p>A natural fit on bulky offense and balance teams, Hisuian Sneasel is a great choice as a Choice Band wallbreaker or Choice Scarf cleaner. Given Choice Band Hisuian Sneasel's propensity to blow holes in teams and force switches every time it hits the field, teammates that can help wear down walls like Dipplin, Regirock, and Spiritomb with entry hazards are much appreciated; Orthworm and Sandslash are great Spikes setters, and Mesprit is a notable Stealth Rock setter and pivot option. Other pivot options that can help Hisuian Sneasel get safe entry points in favorable matchups include Lanturn, which can invite in Snorlax, and Floatzel, which lures in Arboliva and Brute Bonnet. Choice Scarf Hisuian Sneasel appreciates other wallbreaker teammates that can enable it to pull off a late-game sweep, such as Choice Specs Magneton and Choice Band Floatzel.

Regirock is totally dependent on the passive recovery from Leftovers to be a reliable wall, so even items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Rocky Helmet are suboptimal. Stone Edge is generally stronger than Rock Blast but has unreliable accuracy and poor PP, and it and Rock Slide cannot break past Substitute Pokemon. Curse can be used as a setup move over Iron Defense to power up Regirock's Rock Blast, but the extra Defense from Iron Defense is more useful to stonewall physical attackers, and Regirock's Body Press is more powerful and reliable than its STAB move anyway. Protect can enhance Regirock's recovery from Leftovers and allow Regirock to scout common Choice item attackers like Jolteon, Whimsicott, and Floatzel but it makes Regirock much more passive. Tera Ghost lets Regirock become immune to Fighting-type moves from major offensive threats like Virizion and Passimian while preserving Regirock's ability to check Snorlax and enabling it to block Rapid Spin from Sandslash and Toedscruel. Tera Grass helps Regirock manage its common Grass, Water, and Ground weaknesses, whereas Tera Water lets Regirock better handle Glastrier, and Tera Steel shares Tera Poison's poison immunity and Grass resistance while giving Regirock an easier time against Mesprit and Farigiraf. Regirock can run a Careful nature to patch up its relatively lower special bulk, but Regirock is often tasked with taking on physical attackers, and more Defense investment benefits its IronPress combination.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Sandaconda has great longevity, while Sandslash and Toedscruel can remove Regirock's entry hazards with Rapid Spin, but all three must be wary of Regirock boosting too much with Iron Defense.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Regirock's lower special bulk leaves it prone to being overwhelmed by special attackers like Mesprit, Jolteon, and Rotom. Magneton can hit Regirock super effectively with its STAB Flash Cannon. However, most special attackers are physically frail, and Magneton takes a lot of damage from Regirock's Body Press. Many special attackers also cannot KO Regirock without significant chip or several boosts.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Regirock's Fighting weakness can lead it to fall victim to Fighting-types like Passimian and Virizion. Hitmontop and Hitmonchan can both remove Regirock's Stealth Rock. However, Regirock can turn the tables on physically offensive Fighting-types with its IronPress combination and Terastallization.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Whimsicott, Alolan Exeggutor, and Sceptile can blow through Regirock with their strong super effective STAB moves, and Whimsicott is distinguished for avoiding a 2HKO from Regirock's Body Press after Stealth Rock. Alolan Exeggutor annihilates Regirock, while Dipplin can phaze Regirock with Dragon Tail and use Recover to wall it back.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Floatzel majorly threatens Regirock with its powerful Wave Crash. Poliwrath can use non-IronPress Regirock as setup fodder. Clawitzer can OHKO Regirock with Water Pulse but cannot switch into Regirock's Body Press more than once with Stealth Rock up. Veluza resists Body Press and can break through Regirock's Defense boosts with Aqua Cutter.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo</strong>: Regirock relies on its Leftovers for recovery, so Knock Off users like Sneasel, Mesprit, and Grafaiai are disruptive to Regirock. Mespirit and Hisuian Sneasel can use Trick and Switcheroo to disrupt Regirock by giving it their Choice items.</p> <p><strong>Residual damage</strong>: Burns and poison neutralize Regirock's already limited passive recovery. Burns from Will-O-Wisp users like Weezing and Rotom halve Regirock's damage output, while Toxic from Hisuian Qwilfish, Muk, and Toedscruel puts Regirock on a timer. Entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes cause Regirock to struggle to stay healthy.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Encore</strong>: Encore users like Whimsicott and Grafaiai can lock Regirock into a move to exploit it though neither enjoy taking Body Press. Hisuian Qwilfish, Froslass, and Primeape can use Taunt to stop Regirock from setting up Stealth Rock or Iron Defense. Sableye can run Taunt or Encore and does not fear Regirock's Body Press.</p>",

  "Floatzel": {
    "overview": "<p>Floatzel is a dominant offensive threat thanks to its amazing Speed and powerful Wave Crash to wash away slower foes. Not only is Floatzel naturally fast, but it also has Aqua Jet to revenge kill otherwise faster Pokemon like Jolteon and Choice Scarf users like Mesprit and Passimian. Options like Flip Turn and Bulk Up enable Floatzel to run several sets, making it unpredictable on top of already being a dangerous revenge killer and cleaner in one. Coverage from Ice Spinner ensures that Floatzel isn't easily answered by Grass-types and Tera Dragon users. However, Floatzel's subpar bulk and tendency to wear itself down with Wave Crash recoil leave it unable to do more than take a single unresisted hit. While Floatzel is naturally very fast, it's still slower than Jolteon, Whimsicott, and Choice Scarf users, further magnifying the issue of its underwhelming bulk. Bulky Water-types like Poliwrath and Lanturn are enormous obstacles to Floatzel in any of its roles. Floatzel faces competition from other Water-types like the aforementioned Lanturn and Poliwrath thanks to the additional utility they bring, while Clawitzer has much more diverse coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Floatzel could run an offensive pivot set with Heavy-Duty Boots or Mystic Water, but giving up the power of Choice Band or the extra Speed from a Choice Scarf leaves it either too weak to break through teams or too slow in the face of Choice Scarf users and Jolteon. Choice Scarf Floatzel can run a Jolly nature to outspeed fast Choice Scarf users like Grafaiai and Mismagius, but the loss of power leaves it less reliable as a revenge killer to fast Pokemon like Jolteon without prior damage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water Absorb Lanturn flatly counters Floatzel and prevents it from pivoting. Even if Lanturn lacks Water Absorb, Floatzel must take a significant amount of recoil damage and potentially exhaust Terastallization to break through it, while Lanturn threatens Floatzel back with Discharge or Volt Switch. Although it's less common, Poliwrath totally counters all of Floatzel's sets, blocks Flip Turn with Water Absorb, and can use Floatzel as setup fodder for Bulk Up.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ice Spinner threatens all Grass-types, but the prediction-reliant nature of Choice item sets can leave Floatzel vulnerable to Grass-types. Whimsicott naturally outspeeds non-Choice Scarf Floatzel, but its poor physical bulk means it's worn down by repeated hits from Flip Turn and even unable to tolerate multiple hits from Wave Crash. Bulkier Grass-types like Dipplin, Brute Bonnet, and Arboliva can tank even a Choice Band-boosted Ice Spinner and threaten to KO Floatzel with their Grass-type STAB moves. Shaymin has enough bulk to take one Choice Band-boosted Ice Spinner from Floatzel and proceed to threaten it back with Seed Flare; Choice Scarf Shaymin sets are also unbothered by Floatzel's Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Jolteon can easily revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Floatzel, and Floatzel requires prior damage on Jolteon to threaten it with a boosted Aqua Jet even if it exhausts Terastallization. Choice Scarf Electric-types like Rotom and Magneton can similarly revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Floatzel. Offensive pivot Magneton and Vikavolt can tank even a boosted Wave Crash from Floatzel and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Recoil and Entry Hazards</strong>: Floatzel is especially susceptible to being worn down by hazards and recoil. Spikes setters, such as Orthworm, Sandslash, and Froslass, especially contribute to Floatzel exhausting itself.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Nothing besides particularly fast Choice Scarf users like Grafaiai and Mismagius can outspeed Floatzel when equipped with a Choice Scarf. Flip Turn lets Floatzel keep up offensive momentum, luring in passive Pokemon like Arboliva and Lanturn for its teammates to exploit. Ice Spinner lets Floatzel pressure Dipplin and other Grass-types. Liquidation trades some of the great wallbreaking power of Wave Crash for not inflicting recoil damage on Floatzel, which can be useful when it can secure its KOs in spite of the lower damage. Aqua Jet is an alternative that serves as an emergency option against fast Choice Scarf users like Grafaiai, Mismagius, and Hisuian Sneasel. Aqua Jet also enables Floatzel to revenge kill speed-boosting sweepers like Oricorio formes if they've boosted multiple times, and it similarly helps Floatzel handle faster speed-boosting sweepers like Trailblaze Hisuian Sneasel. An Adamant nature maximizes Floatzel's power, reliably revenge killing Jolteon and OHKOing Grafaiai 93.8% of the time; it also leaves it fast enough to outspeed +1 base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Typhlosion and Shaymin. Tera Water boosts the power of Floatzel's STAB moves to cross KO thresholds it otherwise couldn't without more significant prior damage, making it especially useful against bulkier foes like Farigiraf and Passimian, potentially KOing either of them after damage from Spikes. Floatzel can also use Tera Water to more easily clean up weakened teams.</p> <p>Floatzel is an excellent choice for VoltTurn teams given its capacity to form pivot cores. Grafaiai and Floatzel form a complementary offensive pivot core where the two threaten each other's checks, such as Grafaiai pressuring Grass-types like Dipplin and Floatzel breaking through Regirock and Sandaconda; Floatzel can more easily clean up teams Grafaiai weakens with Knock Off and Poison Touch. Jolteon is a specially offensive pivot that can threaten physically defensive Pokemon like Weezing and Orthworm for Floatzel, and Floatzel can return the favor to it by threatening Ground-types like Sandaconda and Sandslash; the two of them can also wear down their mutual Grass-type checks, such as Shaymin and Dipplin, so they can overwhelm them with their coverage moves. Floatzel's offensive pivoting supports wallbreakers such as Brute Bonnet and Glastrier by bringing them in safely, and they additionally benefit from Floatzel threatening fast Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion. Magneton is an offensive pivot that also gains from Floatzel threatening fast Fire-types, and in return, it can fry problematic Water-types like Water Absorb Lanturn and Poliwrath. Floatzel tends to be worn down quickly between recoil and damage from entry hazards, so teammates with hazard removal like Sandslash and Hitmontop provide helpful support. Hazard setters are important partners for Floatzel, as their entry hazards can chip down checks like Poliwrath and Dipplin. Water Absorb users like Lanturn and Poliwrath are a major problem, as they prevent Floatzel from wallbreaking and pivoting entirely, so it depends on Grass-type teammates like Virizion, Whimsicott, and Dipplin to deal with them.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Floatzel's great offensive STAB type and fantastic Speed make it a powerful pivot, wallbreaker, and revenge killer. Flip Turn lets Floatzel keep up momentum for its team while dealing chip damage and finishing off weakened foes. Aqua Jet lets Floatzel pick off faster Pokemon such as Jolteon and Choice Scarf Typhlosion and Speed-boosting setup sweepers like Oricorio-F and Hisuian Sneasel. Ice Spinner provides useful coverage against Grass-types like Virizion, Whimsicott, and Dipplin. Ice Spinner is also useful against Pokemon that may use Tera Dragon, such as Sandaconda, Lanturn, and Hisuian Qwilfish. Water Veil provides Floatzel with a burn immunity, letting it switch into Will-O-Wisp from Charizard and Weezing. Tera Water lets Floatzel OHKO Regirock after damage from Spikes or Stealth Rock and pick off Jolteon with Aqua Jet at just 62.7% health.</p> <p>Floatzel's multiple offensive roles earn it niches on several different types of teams. Floatzel is an excellent addition to VoltTurn teams with Electric-type partners like Magneton and Jolteon, exerting constant offensive pressure and wearing down their shared Grass-type checks. Other offensive pivots like Passimian and Grafaiai similarly make great cores with Floatzel by keeping up constant offensive momentum. Defensive pivots like Lanturn and Articuno can give Floatzel opportunities to come in and fire off Choice Band-boosted attacks; Lanturn can check Electric-types for Floatzel, and Floatzel can return the favor by answering Ground-types for Lanturn; Articuno can impede special attackers such as Clawitzer and Whimsicott that resist Floatzel's Water-type moves and could hit it back with strong attacks. Floatzel's nearly unparalleled ability to revenge kill setup sweepers like Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Jolteon is a huge asset to more defensive teams. Floatzel struggles to break through Grass-types like Shaymin and Dipplin on its own, so it appreciates teammates like Charizard, Weezing, and Muk that threaten them. Glastrier menaces other Grass-types like Whimsicott and Dipplin that would give Floatzel trouble, and Floatzel can threaten Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion for it in return. Other powerful offensive Pokemon such as Glastrier and Brute Bonnet appreciate Floatzel bringing them in safely with Flip Turn. Floatzel tends to be worn down by Wave Crash's recoil and entry hazard damage, so it appreciates teammates that remove or deter hazards, such as Hitmontop, Sandslash, and Hattrem. Healing Wish users like Mesprit and Shaymin can give Floatzel a second wind to clean up the very teams it weakened. Water Absorb Lanturn prevents Floatzel from pivoting out or spamming its STAB moves, so Floatzel relies on checks to it such as Virizion and Dipplin.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Bulk Up enables Floatzel to sweep teams, take advantage of its offensive flexibility, and take a hit after it sets up. Ice Spinner nails bulky Grass-types like Dipplin and Virizion. Aqua Jet lets Floatzel pick off faster revenge killers like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Mesprit. Leftovers gives Floatzel some longevity as it sets up, enabling it to overcome physically defensive Pokemon like Orthworm and Sandaconda without hemorrhaging all of its health. Water Veil prevents burns from Weezing and Charizard. Tera Water boosts Floatzel's Wave Crash to wash away slower Pokemon; Floatzel's +1 Tera Water-boosted Aqua Jet does at least 36% to Choice Scarf users like Mesprit and Passimian, preventing their revenge killing attempts.</p> <p>Floatzel fits well on offensive and balance teams alike thanks to its great offensive potential and high Speed. Offensive teams particularly appreciate Floatzel as a sweeper that can run over walls like Regirock and Sandaconda. Floatzel is an asset to balance teams with its natural speed control, and they can support it with defensive pivots such as Mesprit for an easier time setting up. Floatzel is generally a Choice item user, so the surprise of Bulk Up when it is positioned to claim a KO can swing a game in its favor. Entry hazards from setters like Hisuian Qwilfish, Orthworm, and Sandslash can help Floatzel overwhelm bulkier foes like Dipplin. Floatzel struggles to break Lanturn and cannot break it at all if Lanturn has Water Absorb, which similarly applies to Poliwrath, so Grass-types like Whimsicott and Dipplin can handle these foes for Floatzel. Healing Wish users, including Mesprit and Shaymin, support Floatzel by giving it a second chance to sweep, which is especially useful when it takes recoil damage from Wave Crash or if it's been paralyzed. Opportunities for Floatzel to set up comfortably can be created by pivots like Jolteon, Passimian, and Vikavolt; Encore users like Grafaiai and Mesprit are especially good at making these advantageous situations for Floatzel. Whimsicott and Articuno are pivots that can lure in Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion for Floatzel. Floatzel has to fear faster Electric-type revenge killers like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Magneton if they haven't been worn down into range of being KOed by Aqua Jet, so it depends on partners like Lanturn, Porygon2, and Snorlax handling them. Whimsicott is another revenge killer Floatzel has to fear, one that can be handled by Charizard, Magneton, and Articuno. Physical wallbreakers like Brute Bonnet and Glastrier can soften up teams for Floatzel to sweep, and cleaners like Hisuian Sneasel and Sneasel can take advantage of the holes Floatzel itself may open up for them.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-C is one of the most potent offensive threats in ZU thanks to its great offensive coverage and Special Attack. Electric-immune Pokemon like Lanturn and Sandslash are weak to Leaf Storm, which makes Rotom-C a punishing pivot and difficult to stop. Choice Scarf sets outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, while bulky sets provide excellent team support with their utility moves. Levitate is fantastic as defensive utility, giving Rotom-C opportunities to switch in and threaten Ground-types and keeping it from being worn down by Spikes. Rotom-C isn't lacking utility, either, with moves like Trick, Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Pain Split at its disposal. Terastallization is great for pushing Rotom-C's power to greater heights, giving it a great defensive typing with Levitate for setup opportunities and providing coverage to Nasty Plot sets in conjunction with Tera Blast. However, Rotom-C struggles to do much to Grass-types like Virizion, Shaymin, and Dipplin.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nasty Plot sets can use Tera Blast as a fourth move in conjunction with Tera types, such as Poison, that improve their coverage. Choice Specs sets are prediction-reliant and aren't especially fast, but they can surprise and wear down walls like Snorlax and Muk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Bulky Grass-types like Lurantis, Dipplin, and Arboliva resist Rotom-C's STAB moves and can remain healthy against it. Physical attackers like Brute Bonnet, Dipplin, and Virizion must be wary of Will-O-Wisp, while defensive Grass-types like Lurantis and Arboliva become prone when given a Choice Scarf by Trick. However, Dipplin is a menace to Rotom-C because of its immunity to Trick and potential to use Rotom-C as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax can tank boosted attacks from Rotom-C and hit it back hard, but it is punished by Trick. Non-Rest variants of Snorlax are not fans of Pain Split or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Hisuian Sneasel and Hisuian Qwilfish threaten Rotom-C with their Poison-type STAB moves, but they should watch out for Will-O-Wisp. Muk has the bulk to withstand boosted attacks from Rotom-C and hit it back hard. Grafaiai naturally outspeeds Rotom-C and has a Choice Scarf set to match Rotom-C's own Choice Scarf set, but it's very vulnerable to status.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Electric-types</strong>: Vikavolt resists Rotom-C's STAB moves and threatens it back hard with Bug Buzz, while Magneton can similarly beat Rotom-C one-on-one. If Lanturn Terastallizes into a Dragon-type, then it becomes a very capable check to Rotom-C, and Volt Absorb variants can stop Rotom-C from pivoting.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Sneasel and Cryogonal both outspeed Rotom-C and hit it hard with their Ice-type moves; Sneasel has Ice Shard to deal with Choice Scarf variants, and Cryogonal has good special bulk. Glastrier is bulky, but it is vulnerable to Will-O-Wisp.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Rotom-C outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and makes a great revenge killer against offensive threats like Charizard, Choice Band Floatzel, and Choice Scarf Passimian. Rotom-C excels as a pivot because of Electric-immune Pokemon like Sandslash and Volt Absorb Lanturn taking major damage from Leaf Storm, and few of these Pokemon run coverage to hit Rotom-C back hard. Volt Switch helps Rotom-C keep up momentum as it finishes off foes, and it lets it put Grass-type switch-ins like Dipplin on the backfoot. Trick punishes walls to Rotom-C like Arboliva and Snorlax by restricting them with a Choice lock, but it can also help against offensive foes, such as Virizion and Brute Bonnet, that prefer to switch their moves and don't benefit especially from a Choice Scarf. Tera Electric makes Rotom-C's Thunderbolt and Volt Switch even more powerful, and shedding Rotom-C's Grass typing improves its matchups against Oricorio-F and Sneasel.</p> <p>Rotom-C's ability to keep up the tempo for its team makes it a great pick for offense teams. Other pivots can make great VoltTurn cores with Rotom-C. Grafaiai threatens Grass-types like Shaymin, and it appreciates Rotom-C pressuring bulky Rock- and Ground-types like Regirock and Sandslash. Floatzel threatens Fire-types like Charizard and benefits from Rotom-C threatening Water-types like Lanturn, and the two of them can overwhelm their shared Grass-type checks. Hisuian Qwilfish can set Spikes, which wears down checks to Rotom-C such as Brute Bonnet, Dipplin, and Snorlax. Hisuian Qwilfish even checks Grass-types for Rotom-C, while Rotom-C can switch into Ground-types for Hisuian Qwilfish. Rotom-C becomes more vulnerable once it's used Leaf Storm, and Regirock can switch into foes like Charizard and Sneasel that would try to take advantage of it. As a pivot, Rotom-C can support wallbreakers like Sneasel, Charizard, Typhlosion, and Glastrier, all of which can prey on the Grass-types that Rotom-C invites in. If Rotom-C doesn't use Volt Switch as specially defensive walls like Snorlax and Cryogonal switch in, then physical tanks and bulky wallbreakers like Regirock and Glastrier can switch in and deal with these foes. Since Rotom-C is still slower than Choice Scarf users like Typhlosion, Grafaiai, and Hisuian Sneasel, bulky partners like Snorlax and Sandaconda can pivot into these foes for Rotom-C.</p>"
      },
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Rotom-C's Electric- and Grass-type STAB moves, Nasty Plot sets can shred bulky cores that rely on walls like Lanturn, Regirock, and Orthworm. Discharge is an alternative to Thunderbolt that punishes walls like Cryogonal and Dipplin with paralysis so that Rotom-C or a teammate can more easily overwhelm them. Volt Switch lets Rotom-C keep up momentum against its switch-ins if it's not in a position to sweep, giving it more utility in the early- and mid-game. Pain Split keeps Rotom-C healthy against bulky foes like Snorlax and Muk, and the HP-lowering effect can put them into positions to be overwhelmed by Rotom-C. Will-O-Wisp punishes Grass-types and special walls looking to intercept Rotom-C like Brute Bonnet and Snorlax. A bulkier EV spread affords Rotom-C more opportunities to set up Nasty Plot, but a more offensive one lets Rotom-C break through weakened walls like Snorlax more easily and with fewer boosts. If Rotom-C opts to run Volt Switch, then Heavy-Duty Boots will generally add more to its longevity than Leftovers. Tera Ghost throws off Fighting-type revenge killers like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel, and the Fighting immunity it grants can save Rotom-C against Tera Dragon Regirock's Iron Defense-boosted Body Press. The Fire resistance provided by Tera Dragon helps Rotom-C against Fire-type revenge killers like Charizard and Typhlosion, and it preserves Rotom-C's natural Electric, Grass, and Water resistances. Tera Steel gives Rotom-C a good defensive typing that offers it more setup opportunities against special walls like Porygon2 and the ability to flip its matchups for a critical turn against revenge killers like Sneasel and Choice Scarf Mesprit.</p> <p>Rotom-C's ability to pressure defensive Pokemon is an asset for offense, bulky offense, and balance teams. Spikes from entry hazard setters like Hisuian Qwilfish and Orthworm helps wear down checks to Rotom-C like Dipplin, Muk, and Snorlax. Stealth Rock from setters like Mesprit, Regirock, and Sandslash can also passively get chip damage on these checks to Rotom-C, and in turn, Rotom-C threatens entry hazard removers like Braviary and Sandslash. Special sweepers like Oricorio-F and Farigiraf can sweep late-game once Rotom-C has softened up special walls like Snorlax for them. Physical wallbreakers like Glastrier and Choice Band Floatzel apply pressure to special walls Rotom-C struggles against, while Rotom-C threatens Regirock and Poliwrath. Floatzel forms a great pivot core with Rotom-C, as they can wear down their shared Grass-type checks like Lurantis and Brute Bonnet. Fire-types like Charizard, Oricorio-F, and Typhlosion can melt the Grass-types that are obstacles to Rotom-C like Brute Bonnet and Shaymin, while Rotom-C can pressure Regirock and Lanturn for these Fire-type teammates. Offensive Poison-types like Hisuian Qwilfish, Grafaiai, and Hisuian Sneasel can be handled by Ground-type teammates like Sandslash and Sandaconda. Additionally, these Poison-types can actually make great partners for Rotom-C itself, as they can pressure Grass-types for it, and they also appreciate Rotom-C's good matchups against Ground-types. Glastrier, Regirock, and Poliwrath can handily handle fast Ice-types like Sneasel and Froslass for Rotom-C.</p>"

      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Rotom-C's decent bulk and STAB combination make it a reliable and potent bulky pivot, punishing Electric-immune Pokemon like Sandslash and Lanturn with Leaf Storm. Pain Split capitalizes on Rotom-C's low natural HP and provides it with recovery beyond Leftovers. High-HP Pokemon like Snorlax, Brute Bonnet, and Muk looking to switch into Rotom-C are prime targets for Pain Split and otherwise comfortably stomach Rotom-C's attacks. Will-O-Wisp neuters physical attackers like the aforementioned high-HP Pokemon as well as Passimian and Virizion. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can slow down fast threats like Mismagius and Whimsicott. Leftovers is Rotom-C's only form of recovery beyond Pain Split, while Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it healthier in the face of entry hazards as it pivots. Tera Ghost provides Rotom-C extra defensive presence against Hisuian Sneasel and Virizion to hinder them with status. The resistances provided by Tera Dragon help Rotom-C deal with Fire-type threats like Charizard and Oricorio-F while preserving its Water, Electric, and Grass resistances, ensuring it maintains its positive matchups against Lanturn and opposing Rotom-C. Tera Steel disrupts Psychic-types like Mesprit and Farigiraf, and its synergy with Levitate works well against Ground-types like Sandslash and Sandaconda.</p> <p>Rotom-C's capacity to punish Electric-immune Pokemon with Leaf Storm makes it a good fit for VoltTurn teams. Offensive pivots like Floatzel, Passimian, and Grafaiai form good pivot cores with Rotom-C. In particular, Floatzel deals with Fire-types, Passimian nails bulky Normal-types as well as Cryogonal, and Grafaiai pressures Grass-types like Shaymin as well as Virizion. Clawitzer can tank a Fire-type attack and break through special walls like Snorlax as well as Arboliva, and it benefits from Rotom-C drawing in and pivoting out on these targets for it. Regirock, Snorlax, and Lanturn can answer Fire-types like Charizard and Oricorio-F for Rotom-C. While Rotom-C does have an immunity to Spikes, it still appreciates Stealth Rock being off the field as it pivots if it's not holding Heavy-Duty Boots; Sandslash, Hitmontop, and Hattrem can all keep the field clear for Rotom-C. Rotom-C's ability to deal with Lanturn and Regirock is greatly appreciated by Fire-types like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Oricorio-F. Other powerful offensive threats, such as Mismagius, benefit from the free switches Rotom-C can provide with Volt Switch. Notably, Glastrier, Sneasel, and Hisuian Sneasel can deal with the Grass-types that Rotom-C invites in. Setup sweepers with middling Speed like Mesprit and Hisuian Qwilfish can set up more easily thanks to the positioning Rotom-C can provide, and the latter presures Grass-types. Specially defensive walls like Snorlax and Lanturn can switch into Vikavolt for Rotom-C, while Ground-types like Sandslash and Sandaconda can deal with faster Poison-types like Grafaiai and Hisuian Sneasel for Rotom-C.</p>"

  "Mesprit": {
    "overview": "<p>Mesprit is a highly flexible Pokemon that is capable of fulfulling a multitude of roles within the ZU metagame. Its balanced stats and useful movepool allow Mesprit to work well in offensive and defensive utility roles, while its Nasty Plot set is a threatening sweeper that is extremely challenging for bulky builds to deal with. Mesprit is also a good check to Fighting-types such as Virizion and Passimian, and Levitate lets it deal with many Ground-types, such as Sandslash and Sandaconda. Unfortunately, Mesprit's balanced stats means that it isn't truly exceptional at any role that it tries to play, as its offensive stats aren't fantastic, and bulky sets are prone to getting chipped down over time. Its Psychic typing also leaves it vulnerable to common Dark-types, such as Sneasel, Brute Bonnet, and Hisuian Qwilfish, while also leaving it weak to the ubiquitous U-turn. Finally, Mesprit's coverage is quite limited, as it lacks a way to hit Steel-types hard and doesn't hit much of the metagame for super effective damage. This can lead to it sometimes struggling to break through bulky threats such as Articuno and Snorlax.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Specs set utilizing Psychic, Dazzling Gleam, Psyshock or Shadow Ball, and either Trick or U-turn is feasible. However, Mesprit isn't powerful enough to consistently break down defensive cores without perfect prediction, it can't hit Steel-types for significant damage, and its mediocre Speed tier means it isn't especially good against offensive teams either. The Nasty Plot set can consider Psychic Noise or Stored Power as its Psychic-type STAB move. The former prevents recovery from the likes of Articuno, Pallosand, and Snorlax, while the latter will become extremely powerful if Mesprit accrues multiple Nasty Plot boosts. However, Psyshock's ability to pressure common special walls like Lanturn, Snorlax, and Articuno makes it the most consistent option. The defensive pivot set can consider Colbur Berry as an alternative item to take Knock Off from the likes of Passimian, Sneasel, and Grafaiai as well as Dark-type attacks from Brute Bonnet. However, the loss of Leftovers recovery means that only offensive teams looking to play fast should consider this, and it loses value if Mesprit is forced to Terastallize. The defensive pivot could also use other Tera types, such as Tera Fairy to give a Dark resistance that is useful when facing down Sneasel, Brute Bonnet, and Passimian and Tera Water to grant useful resistances for Typhlosion, Floatzel, and Clawitzer. Tera Water, however, leaves Mesprit open to common Grass- and Electric-type attacks from Shaymin, Jolteon, and Brute Bonnet. Options like Thunder Wave to deter setup or and Pain Split to give Mesprit some form of recovery may seem appealing for the defensive set, but Mesprit tends to perform its role more consistently with the given moves.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type Coverage</strong>: Dark-types such as Sneasel, Brute Bonnet, and Hisuian Qwilfish threaten Mesprit with their STAB moves and either force it to switch out or Terastallize. Mesprit is capable of pivoting out or hitting them with Fairy-type coverage as they switch in, however. Pokemon that Mesprit would otherwise check, such as Grafaiai, Passimian, Hisuian Sneasel, and Sandslash often run Dark-type coverage, limiting its ability to comfortably deal with them. Sableye and Spiritomb don't fear Mesprit's STAB moves, and Sableye can threaten to lock Mesprit into an ineffective move with Prankster Encore, though neither of them appreciate Fairy-type coverage, Knock Off, or Trick.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-type attackers such as Mismagius, offensive Froslass, and Rotom threaten Mesprit with their STAB moves, but they can't comfortably switch in to most sets due to the threat of Knock Off, Trick, or a STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Orthworm, Magneton, and Perrserker resist Mesprit's common coverage options, and they can use it as an opportunity to fire off a strong attack or, in Orthworm's case, set up Stealth Rock, Spikes, Coil, or Iron Defense. However, they must be wary of Trick or Knock Off. Additionally, certain Pokemon Mesprit usually checks, such as Weezing and Articuno, often run Tera Steel and can therefore turn the tables on Mesprit.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Mesprit's rather modest bulk means it can't comfortably answer many of the tier's strongest offensive threats. Typhlosion, Jolteon, and Floatzel outrun non-Choice Scarf Mesprit and threaten to do serious damage, even to the defensive set. Even slow wallbreakers such as Alolan Exeguttor and Clawitzer are still faster than the defensive pivot set and threaten it with extreme damage.</p>",

Tera Fairy Mesprit is a more effective offensive and defensive answer to Sneasel, Brute Bonnet, and Passimian given their Dark-type coverage moves, and Tera Fairy lets Mesprit not play guessing games with Psychic and Dazzling Gleam against Tera Dark Passimian. Tera Steel has good synergy with Levitate and gives Mesprit several new resistances to more easily answer Whimsicott, Sandslash, and Farigiraf.</p> <p>Offensive pivots like Jolteon and Magneton make great cores with Mesprit and appreciate Mesprit's Levitate to more easily play around Ground-types. Fighting-types like Virizion, Passimian, and Hitmontop are great offensive checks to Snorlax and Steel-types like Orthworm and Perrserker, all of which give Mesprit trouble, and they appreciate Mesprit offensively checking Poison-types like Weezing and Hisuian Sneasel. Mesprit benefits from Ground-type teammates like Sandslash and Sandaconda patching up its poor matchup against Hisuian Qwilfish, while it can check foes like Virizion for them. Setup sweepers like Oricorio-F, Regirock, and Virizion benefit from Mesprit providing them second chances to sweep with Healing Wish or making foes more exploitable with Trick. Physical wallbreakers like Brute Bonnet, Glastrier, and Hisuian Sneasel all benefit from Healing Wish giving them an additional chance for breaking, as they can break special walls that Mesprit cannot.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Mesprit is a fearsome mid- or late-game sweeper thanks to the combination of Levitate and a somewhat high base 105 Special Attack stat. Its biggest perk is the ability to set up in front of most bulkier Pokémon. Mesprit can choose between Encore and Substitute as its setup tool; Substitute can be very good versus bulkier teams, as Mesprit can tank a hit from most of the passive mons such as Regirock and Lanturn if not being hit super effectively, obtaining a free turn to either set up Nasty Plot or fire off an attack. Encore helps to circumvent Mesprit's passivity and can take advantage of checks that need to set up or use status moves like Haze to wall Mesprit, like Articuno for the Haze case, and Regirock for the setup. Psyshock is great to deal with specially defensive Pokémon such as Snorlax. Draining Kiss allows Mesprit to outlast Dark-type checks such as Spiritomb and Sneasel while healing in the process, Thunderbolt allows it to hit and Flying- and Water-types such as Charizard and Clawitzer hard. Tera Fairy lets Mesprit set up in front of the aforementioned Dark-types, grants immunity to Dragon Tail from Dipplin and Appletun, and increases the power of Draining Kiss, letting Mesprit restore more HP on the aforementioned threats and making it even harder to take down. Tera Steel improves Mesprit's defensive capabilities, making it take neutral damage from Dark- and Ghost-type attacks and giving it a Bug resistance, while only being weak to Fighting- and Fire-type moves due to Levitate. Tera Electric boosts the power of Thunderbolt and removes all of Mesprit's weaknesses.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Sweeper Mesprit works well with specific entry hazard setters and Fighting-types. Hazard setters like Orthworm and Hisuian Qwilfish both cover each other's weaknesses and let Mesprit get rolls it wouldn't otherwise, such as KOing Honchkrow with Tera Fairy Draining Kiss after Stealth Rock chip damage. Fighting-types such as Virizion and Passimian deserve a highlight, as when paired with Mesprit, they provide good coverage for it, pressuring Dark- and Steel-types with their STAB moves and Ghost-types with Knock Off. Both of them offer additional utility, with Virizion being bulky enough to enter in and provide wallbreaking prowess and Passimian having access to U-turn to let Mesprit in safely and Knock Off to offer utility. Secondary wallbreakers that don't rely on Setup to make progress such as Clawitzer and Magneton will also appreciate being by Mesprit's side. Some cleaners also enjoy Mesprit's ability to make progress so they can clean late-game, such as Dodrio and Hisuian Sneasel.</p>"

      "Specially Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Mesprit's decent defensive profile and access to useful utility moves like Stealth Rock and Healing Wish allow it to act as a good defensive pivot. Its bulk and typing allows it to check foes such as Jolteon, Charizard, and Passimian locked into Close Combat. Psychic Noise is a useful STAB move that allows Mesprit to force out Hitmonchan and Hitmontop, which are among the few viable hazard removers of the tier. Its decent Base Power and ability to prevent healing allow Mesprit to annoy other defensive Pokemon like Dipplin and Sandaconda. U-turn allows Mesprit to pivot out of poor matchups such as Glastrier and Spiritomb while keeping up momentum for its team. Knock Off allows Mesprit to punish foes that would feel comfortable coming in otherwise, such as Orthworm, Articuno, and Snorlax. Healing Wish is another option for offensive teams that allows Mesprit to fully heal an offensive teammate and give it another go at breaking down the opponent's team. It is capable of running both Knock Off and Healing Wish if your team already has another Stealth Rock user. Maximum Special Defense investment is preferred in order to better take hits from the likes of Charizard, Magneton, and Pyroar. A Sassy nature is preferred to give Mesprit a slow U-turn and maximize the damage that its physical attacks do. Steel is the preferred Tera type, as it turns each of Mesprit's weaknesses into a neutrality or a resistance and gives it a superb general defensive typing. It notably lets Mesprit handle Grafaiai, opposing Mesprit, and Whimsicott with more confidence. Tera Steel also has good synergy with Levitate and allows Mesprit to comfortably handle foes such as Sandslash and Sandaconda. Leftovers grants Mesprit passive recovery and helps it stay as healthy as possible throughout the match.</p> <p>Mesprit is one of the few bulky Stealth Rock setters in the tier that also has access to a pivoting move, which makes it highly useful for both balance and offense. Mesprit lacks reliable recovery, so teams utilizing it shouldn't expect it to be a stalwart wall. Rather, its good support movepool and defensive traits allow it to act as a stopgap that can take a few hits while also supporting its offensively oriented teammates via pivoting and utility moves such as Knock Off and Healing Wish. Mesprit's physical bulk is somewhat lacking, so physically defensive teammates such as Weezing and Sandaconda, make for good partners. These two help out against Fighting-types such as Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel, which Mesprit struggles to check in the long term. Dipplin serves as a good physically defensive partner and in particular a Knock Off absorber, which is highly useful for Mesprit because it fears Knock Off greatly. Mesprit is also vulnerable to Dark-types such as Hisuian Qwilfish, Sneasel, and Brute Bonnet. Teammates such as Hisuian Sneasel and Virizion can help with the latter, while Hisuian Qwilfish and the aforementioned Weezing can help with the former two. Teammates such as Passimian, Virizion, and Charizard can help check Steel-types such as Magneton and Orthworm, which Mesprit struggles to deal with on its own. Strong wallbreakers, such as Typhlosion, Glastrier, Brute Bonnet, and Alolan Exeggutor, appreciate Mesprit's slow U-turn getting them in safely, and they benefit from Mesprit's ability to use Knock Off to remove various items from defensive Pokemon such as Regirock, Orthworm, and Articuno. Mesprit also pairs well with other VoltTurn users; Passimian, Grafaiai, Whimsicott, and Floatzel also benefit from Mesprit bringing them in safely and can form a pivoting core that can slowly wear down the opponent's team. Pokemon such as Floatzel, Typhlosion, Charizard, and Glastrier appreciate Healing Wish support should Mesprit choose to run it, as they are all vulnerable to being worn down over the course of a match, and many teams are not prepared to deal with them a second time.</p>"

However, Whimsicott's low offensive stats leave it often wanting for power, especially without Choice Specs, and it's incapable of fitting every move it wants. Furthermore, lack of reliable recovery and only average bulk makes it unable to consistently check the Pokemon it's supposed to like Regirock and Sandaconda.</p>",

This set struggles to find setup opportunities however and relies heavily on getting a free Substitute on a forced switch.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Whimsicott's 4x weakness to Poison and inability to hit Poison-types with its STAB attacks makes Poison-types like Grafaiai and Weezing good checks. However, these Pokemon lack reliable recovery and can thus be worn down over a game.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Magneton and Orthworm can take Whimsicott's STAB attacks with ease. Orthworm can start setting entry hazards or set up with Coil or Iron Defense, while Magneton can generate momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: As Whimsicott's STAB attacks do little to them, Fire-types like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Magmortar can use Whimsicott as an entry point to start firing off powerful attacks. These Pokemon aren't usually defensively invested however and can struggle to switch in consistently.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Snorlax and Articuno aren't bothered by Whimsicott's attacks and can use it to start forcing progress with entry hazards, status, pivoting, or boosts. However, Switcheroo completely ruins these walls, especially Articuno, and Encore can force them to repeat their status moves, allowing Whimsicott to safely bring in a teammate.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Many common Choice Scarf users like Grafaiai, Hisuian Sneasel, and Gunk Shot Passimian get the jump on Whimsicott and can easily take it out.</p>",

However, Whimsicott loses a substantial amount of power without its Choice Specs, so one must be careful about when to use Switcheroo.

Giga Drain is used for its ability to give Whimsicott staying power in longer games. Encore is key to this set, allowing it to force defensive foes into unfavorable moves like Stealth Rock and Recover, as well as shutting down setup sweepers like Oricorio-F and Snorlax by locking them into their setup moves. U-turn pairs beautifully with Encore, scouting any forced switches and allowing Whimsicott to bring in powerful teammates like Glastrier and Typhlosion. Tera Steel gives Whimsicott an immunity to Poison-type attacks from Grafaiai and Hisuian Qwilfish and a resistance to Flying-type attacks from Dodrio and Braviary as well as Ice-type attacks from Sneasel in a pinch. However, this still leaves Whimsicott vulnerable to Fire-type attacks from Charizard and Typhlosion and makes it weak to Fighting, making it unable to reliably switch into Brute Bonnet and Virizion. Tera Fire provides emergency resistances to Ice and Fire, but this makes Whimsicott unable to safely check Ground- and Rock-types like Sandaconda and Regirock.</p> <p>Balance teams enjoy Whimsicott's pivoting and Prankster Encore helping them deal with bulky defensive Pokemon and dangerous setup sweepers. Powerful physical wallbreakers like Glastrier and Passimian pair well with Whimsicott, as it baits in special walls like Articuno and can bring these teammates in with U-turn.

    "overview": "<p>Virizion's great Speed tier and threatening offensive typing make it a dangerous offensive threat that can serve as both a wallbreaker and a late-game cleaner. Virizion has access to Swords Dance, which allows it to boost its attack and wallbreak consistently. Its great Speed tier lets it stay threatening versus offensive teams and even clean them up late-game when its checks are weakened or removed. Virizion has naturally high special bulk and a workable defensive typing that allow it to find set up opportunities versus Choice-locked special attackers like Jolteon, Magneton, and Clawitzer, and there is some ambiguity to its sets thanks to its good coverage and ability to run a physical or special set. However, Virizion isn't especially strong without a boost, and it can struggle to break through physically bulky checks like Weezing and Dipplin. Despite that, Virizion retains a very solid niche thanks to its higher Speed tier and its ability to run coverage options like Stone Edge and Zen Headbutt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Virizion can run a Tera Flying Calm Mind set using Giga Drain, Air Slash, and Focus Blast or Aura Sphere. This turns the tables on many of Virizion's traditional answers such as Dipplin and Weezing, and Virizion's STAB combination threatens several common special walls, such as Lanturn and Snorlax. However, Virizion can only boost its Special Attack by one stage at a time with Calm Mind, and it is forced to use weak moves unless it opts for the inaccurate Focus Blast as its Fighting-type STAB move, which makes the set considerably less threatening in practice. A mixed attacker set with Leaf Storm, Close Combat, Stone Edge, and Synthesis with a Life Orb can be threatening to certain offensive and balance teams but fails to make significant progress versus builds packing common walls such as Dipplin, Mesprit, and Muk. Sacred Sword is an interesting alternative to Close Combat that ignores the Defense boosts on IronPress foes such as Regirock, Orthworm, and Naclstack and doesn't lower Virizion's own defenses, but the drop in power is very noticeable. Tera Fairy is a fringe alternative Tera type that gives Virizion a Fighting resistance, allowing it to stave off revenge killing from Choice Scarf Passimian, and an immunity to Dragon Tail, which lets it potentially break past Dipplin after accruing multiple Swords Dance boosts. Tera Poison grants Virizion a generally useful defensive typing to counteract revenge killing attempts from the likes of Whimsicott, Passimian, and Grafaiai. These are inferior to the other Tera types outside of these specific situations, however.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dipplin</strong>: Dipplin's massive physical bulk allows it to handily deal with the standard Swords Dance set. It isn't even 2HKOed by a +2 Close Combat and can use Dragon Tail to phaze Virizion before healing off any damage, which makes it a very reliable answer. It has to be wary of a surprise Calm Mind set, however, and the rare Tera Fairy can turn it into setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Bulky Poison-types such as Weezing and Muk resist Virizion's STAB moves and threaten it in return with their STAB moves, or in Weezing's case, a burn from Will-O-Wisp. They must be cautious of Zen Headbutt, however. Grafaiai and Hisuian Sneasel are faster than Virizion and can OHKO it with Gunk Shot or, in Grafaiai's case, cripple it with Encore. Additionally, several Pokemon that Virizion usually threatens, such as Brute Bonnet and Regirock, commonly run Tera Poison and can therefore turn the tables on it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Virizion's Speed tier, while very solid, still leaves it outpaced by several common revenge killers. Choice Scarf Passimian, Whimsicott, Sneasel, and Choice Scarf Typhlosion all outrun Virizion and can threaten to revenge kill it. All but the latter two need chip damage dealt before they can KO Virizion, however, and only Whimsicott and Passimian can directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Burns and paralysis are especially threatening to Virizion. Common Pokemon such as Weezing, Lanturn, and Charizard are all capable of spreading those status conditions, and Virizion is not capable of OHKOing any of them except for Charizard if it chooses to run Stone Edge. However, Lum Berry allows Virizion to circumvent this and set up on many of these foes fearlessly.</p>",

Heavy-Duty Boots allows Virizion to come in multiple times throughout a game without fear of chip damage from entry hazards. However, Lum Berry is a viable alternative on offensive teams, as it allows Virizion to set up safely on foes that might try to cripple it with status, such as Mesprit, Rotom, and Sandaconda. Tera Rock allows Stone Edge to OHKO Whimsicott and 2HKO Weezing after Stealth Rock damage at +2. It also gives Virizion a resistance to Fire- and Flying-type attacks, which lets it deal with Charizard, Typhlosion, and Oricorio-F with more confidence. Tera Psychic lets Zen Headbutt 2HKO Tera Poison Regirock at +2, do significantly more damage to Weezing, removes Virizion's weakness to their Poison-type STAB moves, and gives Virizion a useful Fighting resistance that can foil revenge killing attempts from Choice Scarf Passimian and opposing Virizion.</p> <p>Virizion's great Speed tier and ability to both wallbreak and sweep depending on the situation make it usable on teams ranging from balanced to hyper offensive team styles.

Strong special attackers, such as Nasty Plot Mesprit, Magneton, and Charizard, are therefore good teammates; the former is especially good at disrupting these extremely bulky threats. These teammates appreciate Virizion's Speed tier helping them out against offensive builds and its ability to threaten special walls like Lanturn. Virizion appreciates entry hazards on the opponent's side, as it tends to force a lot of switches and loves seeing its defensive checks worn down.

Volt Switch also helps break the Focus Sash of a Taunt lead like Primeape or Froslass so one of Vikavolt's teammates can come in and dispose of them. Thunderbolt's advantage over Volt Switch is that it doesn't force Vikavolt to switch out against Pokemon it wants to threaten, such as Passimian, Articuno, and Clawitzer. Energy Ball covers Electric-immune Pokemon like Sandslash and Volt Absorb Lanturn, and it nails Regirock. Vikavolt can opt for Thunderbolt over Energy Ball so that it doesn't have to choose between a pivot move and a reliable Electric-type STAB move across matchups against foes like Orthworm, Muk, and Weezing. Additionally, Vikavolt's STAB moves already hit most of the metagame for neutral damage. Tera Ghost turns Vikavolt into a spinblocker, ensuring its Sticky Web stays up against spinners like Sandslash, Cryogonal, and Hitmontop. Alternatively, Tera Steel has defensive synergy with Levitate, makes Vikavolt a good check to Psychic- and Fairy-types like Mesprit and Whimsicott, and turns the tables on Regirock for a key turn.

Slower wallbreakers like Clawitzer, Glastrier, and Brute Bonnet are especially appreciative of Sticky Web compensating for their poor Speed. Setup sweepers with middling Speed like Mesprit and Hisuian Qwilfish also benefit from the ability to outspeed more threats. Knock Off users like Passimian, Mesprit, and Sandslash help ensure Heavy-Duty Boots is removed from all foes so that the entire opposing team is subjected to Sticky Web, and the item removal support they offer helps against checks to Vikavolt like Snorlax and Cryogonal. Ghost-types like Mismagius and Froslass act as spinblockers to keep up Vikavolt's Sticky Web, while Defiant Pokemon, such as Passimian, Braviary, and Primeape, can deter and punish Defoggers.

Heavy-Duty Boots allows Vikavolt to function as a bulky slow pivot more reliably. A Bold nature with full Defense investment can be used to let Vikavolt better take attacks from foes like Floatzel, Passimian, and Virizion; alternatively, a Modest nature with full Special Attack investment can maximize its damage output at the cost of taking on opposing leads less effectively. Tera Steel is used to provide a resistance to Psychic, which helps it take on Mesprit after it Terastallizes, and flip its weakness to Rock into a resistance, taking Rock Blast and Stone Edge from foes like Regirock and Virizion more comfortably.</p> <p>Vikavolt, despite being a Sticky Web setter, is a good fit for bulky offense and offensive structures alike. With its good natural bulk and massive power even without EV investment, Vikavolt can reliably come in and pivot a few times each game, using its wallbreaking proficiency to lure in foes like Snorlax for teammates like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel. Similarly, setup sweepers like Poliwrath and Mesprit can overcome their relative slowness with Sticky Web support, threatening to clean late-game after one boost. Stealth Rock setters like Regirock pair well with Vikavolt, with the former taking on foes like Sneasel reliably and the latter taking on Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion. Vikavolt is a notable VoltTurn partner for Floatzel and Passimian, as they can lure in Arboliva and Mesprit for it, while it can provide entry points for them against foes like Cryogonal and Snorlax. Defog deterrents, like Braviary, Malamar, and Passimian, make for excellent teammates, leveraging the Sticky Web set by Vikavolt to become devastating wallbreakers if positioned well. Knock Off users that can aid further in this endeavor, like Passimian, Sneasel, and Grafaiai, also help soften up Vikavolt checks such as Snorlax.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With its high Speed, good movepool, and powerful offensive typing, Lycanroc has secured a great spot in ZU as a positively potent offensive sweeper as well as an adept entry hazard lead. Its access to a unique priority move in Accelerock lets it bury faster targets like Sneasel as well as boosted threats like Oricorio-F. Swords Dance Lycanroc is a prolific wallbreaker and sweeper, while lead sets can start games off with Stealth Rock, deny opposing hazards with Taunt, and severely weaken foes with Endeavor. However, Lycanroc is hounded by several issues. Its severe lack of bulk means that any strong neutral attack will likely take it out, hampering its opportunities to set up and sweep. Lycanroc also lacks in power if it can't hit a foe super effectively, which can leave it defenseless against certain foes like Regirock and especially Dipplin. Lycanroc's sweep is easily put down by many revenge killers like Whimsicott and Choice Scarf Passimian, which aren't as afraid of Accelerock. The dedicated lead set faces competition from Froslass, which has access to Spikes and a more effective trading tool in Destiny Bond.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lycanroc can opt out of Accelerock on sand teams, since it outruns everything with Sand Rush active. Choice Band may seem tempting to use on Lycanroc; however, none of its moves are spammable, making the set heavily prediction reliant, and Lycanroc prefers switching moves to deal super effective damage. Crunch allows Lycanroc to hit Palossand hard, which would otherwise be a perfect counter, while Psychic Fangs nails Weezing. Play Rough hits Fighting-types slightly harder than Psychic Fangs and is Lycanroc's best bet at breaking past Dipplin. However, dropping Close Combat leaves Lycanroc unable to break past Orthworm, Magneton, and Regirock, which are generally more common.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Faster Fighting-types like Choice Scarf Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel resist Accelerock and can cleanly take Lycanroc out with Close Combat. Hitmonchan has a strong Mach Punch to pick it off.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Sandaconda and Sandslash resist Lycanroc's Rock-type attacks and can all tank a boosted move from Lycanroc before KOing it back in return with a Ground-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Floatzel outspeeds Lycanroc and threatens it immensely, being able to pivot on it with Flip Turn or pick it off with priority in Aqua Jet. Lanturn doesn't switch into Lycanroc well but can take an unboosted attack and retaliate with a Water-type attack or inflict it with status.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: A healthy Dipplin completely walls Lycanroc and threatens it back with Giga Drain. Weezing isn't very keen on taking Stone Edge but can burn Lycanroc in retaliation. Orthworm and Regirock can Terastallize out of their Fighting-type weakness and threaten Lycanroc back with Body Press.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Burn from Weezing and Charizard hampers Lycanroc's offensive capabilities, while paralysis from Lanturn and Magneton worsens its great Speed as well as potentially stopping it from attacking, which is fatal for a Pokemon as frail as Lycanroc. Poison chip damage from Poison Touch Grafaiai and Toxic Hisuian Qwilfish rapidly wears away at Lycanroc's health, especially together with Life Orb recoil and entry hazards.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Lycanroc's high Speed and excellent Attack make it a deadly revenge killer, wallbreaker, and setup sweeper. The many switches it forces on foes like Charizard and Sneasel lets it grab a Swords Dance boost and potentially sweep. Stone Edge, while innacurate, is Lycanroc's strongest STAB attack. Alternatively, Rock Blast in conjunction with Loaded Dice is more accurate, but it results in Lycanroc losing Life Orb's extra power boost on its other moves. Lycanroc has a wide array of coverage moves to pick and choose from, with Close Combat being the most reliable choice for its high power and coverage against foes like Orthworm, Regirock, and Brute Bonnet. Accelerock lets Lycanroc pick off Rock-weak foes like Sneasel and Choice Scarf Typhlosion as well as weakened targets like Floatzel and Jolteon. Sand Rush is the optimal ability for Lycanroc, as on sand teams, Sand Rush allows Lycanroc to outspeed everything in the metagame, while on non-sand teams, it gives Lycanroc a positive matchup into opposing sand teams. A Jolly nature is generally preferred to outrun Charizard, Mismagius, and Froslass, but Adamant is an option on sand teams because of Sand Rush doubling Lycanroc's Speed. Tera Fighting gives Lycanroc immense power on Close Combat, notably cleanly OHKOing Orthworm and Regirock at +2, with the added benefit of resisting Sucker Punch from Brute Bonnet. Tera Ghost flips Lycanroc's Fighting weakness, letting it blank a Choice Scarf Passimian's and Hisuian Sneasel's Close Combat.</p> <p>Offense and hyper offense teams enjoy Lycanroc's powerful wallbreaking and sweeping potential as well as the assurance it provides against opposing offense with Accelerock, especially against sun teams. Pivots like Passimian, Mesprit, and Whimsicott help Lycanroc hit the field safely. Whimsicott is a particularly good partner, as it handles many of Lycanroc's answers like Dipplin and Sandaconda, and its Prankster Encore can give Lycanroc a chance to sweep. In return, Lycanroc threatens many of Whimsicott's checks like Charizard, Magneton, and Articuno. Other physical wallbreakers like Sneasel, Floatzel, and Brute Bonnet all play well with Lycanroc, working to create gaping holes in the opponent's team for each other to exploit. Dipplin is a near-perfect wall to Lycanroc, so teammates that can exploit it like Charizard and Magneton are quite handy. Lycanroc is quite frail, so defensive teammates like Weezing are helpful for it to fall back on. Lycanroc loves entry hazard setters like Sandslash, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Orthworm, as the chip damage from Spikes softens up many of its answers like Dipplin and Sandaconda, helping Lycanroc secure its KOs much more easily. On sand teams, Sand Spit Sandaconda is necessary to set sand, and fellow sand sweepers like Sandslash can band together with Lycanroc to break the opposing team down. As Lycanroc struggles with Fighting-types, teammates that can deal with them like Oricorio-F and Whimsicott are its best friends. Other sweepers on hyper offense teams are useful partners for Lycanroc as well, since many of them like Nasty Plot Mesprit and Swords Dance Virizion exploit Lycanroc's answers in Sandaconda and Regirock. Physical sweepers like Swords Dance Hisuian Sneasel benefit from the holes in the opponent's team left behind by Lycanroc, easing their sweeps. Healing Wish support from Mesprit and Shaymin allows Lycanroc to go for a second round of sweeping.</p>"

      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With Taunt and its high Speed, Lycanroc makes for an excellent entry hazard-setting lead. Taunt lets Lycanroc deny hazards from being set by Pokemon like Regirock, Orthworm, and Sandaconda as well as stop Defog attempts from Lurantis. Focus Sash is vital to guarantee that Stealth Rock is set even versus foes that would outspeed and OHKO Lycanroc. Endeavor pairs beautifully with Focus Sash, letting Lycanroc bring a foe's health down with it and potentially rendering that opposing Pokemon near useless. Rock Blast lets Lycanroc OHKO lead Froslass through Focus Sash, which allows it to simultaneously preserve its own while completely denying Spikes from going up. Close Combat nails opposing Lycanroc, and Accelerock lets Lycanroc chip faster foes before going down, possibly taking them out completely when combined with Endeavor beforehand. This also makes the mirror against opposing lead Lycanroc easier. Tera Ghost lets Lycanroc spinblock, but it is generally better to preserve Terastallization for Lycanroc's teammates, as it is intended to sacrifice itself.</p> <p>Lycanroc is best used on hyper offense teams, where it can lead the charge for its pack of setup sweepers. It notably is incredibly annoying for opposing hyper offense teams that use Froslass as their lead, as Lycanroc can one-shot Froslass through Focus Sash with Rock Blast. Mesprit is just one example of the many sweepers that appreciate Stealth Rock chipping away at their checks. On sun teams, Lycanroc denying hazards can free up Fire-type teammates like Charizard and Typhlosion to run items like Choice Specs and Choice Scarf instead of Heavy-Duty Boots. Lycanroc notably struggles to face lead Sandslash, so a teammate that can deal with it, like Virizion, can help Lycanroc in this regard. Since Lycanroc ideally sacrifices itself to get Stealth Rock up, teammates that deter hazard removal are great to make sure that Stealth Rock can stay up. Ghost-types like Mismagius can block Rapid Spin attempts from Sandslash and Cryogonal, and Defog punishers like Passimian, Braviary, and Malamar make foes think twice about trying to clear Stealth Rock.</p>"

Gunk Shot can threaten Dipplin, but it suffers from poor accuracy and fails to 2HKO it. Weezing is a standout defensive check to Passimian between having great physical bulk, threatening to Will-O-Wisp Passimian, and punishing U-turn with Rocky Helmet.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Sableye and Spiritomb cause Passimian to lose momentum when it's locked into Close Combat, and both can burn it. Spiritomb dislikes losing its Leftovers to Knock Off though. Mismagius can use Passimian to set up if it's locked into Close Combat or Earthquake, but it can't switch into Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Will-O-Wisp from Rotom and Charizard debilitates Passimian, though they struggle to switch into its coverage moves safely. Paralysis leaves Passimian easily outsped and makes it poor speed control, so Regirock can punish Passimian trying to switch in on it with Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Rotom, Typhlosion, and Mismagius can outspeed and deal significant damage to Passimian, though none of them switch into the combination of Close Combat and Knock Off safely.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types and Tera Fairy Pokemon</strong>: Whimsicott resists or takes neutral damage from most of Passimian's moves but must be wary of Gunk Shot, and Close Combat can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fairy users like Mesprit, Mismagius, and Jolteon can take advantage of Passimian's limited coverage to take a hit from it and KO it at the cost of burning Terastallization.

Passimian OHKOes fast offensive threats like Sneasel and KOes Floatzel, Brute Bonnet, and Grafaiai after Stealth Rock damage. Knock Off makes Mesprit and Mismagius unsafe switch-ins to Passimian, and it makes helpful progress by removing items from defensive checks like Weezing and Spiritomb. U-turn lets Passimian keep up momentum against switch-ins like Dipplin and Sableye. Earthquake is Passimian's best coverage move for Poison-types like Neutralizing Gas Weezing, Hisuian Sneasel, and Muk. Gunk Shot OHKOes Whimsicott, is Passimian's best move against Dipplin, and keeps Passimian offensively relevant against Tera Fairy users like Snorlax and Jolteon. Rock Slide hits Flying-types like Charizard and Oricorio-F and Bug-types like Venomoth and Vikavolt. Tera Fighting allows Passimian to outright OHKO offensive foes like Virizion and Typhlosion and 2HKO defensive foes like Regirock and Sandaconda with Close Combat after one layer of Spikes. Tera Dark improves Passimian's matchups against Mesprit and Farigiraf, powers up Knock Off to hurt Spiritomb more, and denies Prankster-boosted moves from Grafaiai and Sableye. Defiant is Passimian's only viable ability, but it's useful for boosting Passimian against Hisuian Qwilfish and Hitmontop and punishing Sticky Web teams.</p> <p>Passimian punishing Defog with Defiant and removing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off makes it a great team player for entry hazard-stacking teams that include Orthworm, Sandslash, or Hisuian Qwilfish. Passimian's momentum is greatly appreciated by wallbreakers like Typhlosion, Clawitzer, and Alolan Exeggutor. Passimian luring in physically defensive Pokemon like Sandaconda and Dipplin enables partners like Mesprit and Whimsicott to take advantage of them when Passimian pivots out with U-turn, and in turn, Passimian threatens Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton for them. Ghost-types like Rotom and Mismagius can exploit Passimian locked into Close Combat, Earthquake, or Gunk Shot, so teammates like Snorlax and Hisuian Qwilfish are great teammates. Likewise, Passimian appreciates specially offensive teammates like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Charizard that can exploit physically defensive Pokemon like Weezing and Dipplin that it lures in. Once Passimian can form pivot cores with Pokemon like Jolteon, Magneton, and Lanturn, it can trap foes in the vortex and wear down mutual Ground-type checks such as Sandaconda and Sandslash. Physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Sneasel, Glastrier, and Choice Band Floatzel can open up holes in defensive cores to pave the way for Passimian to clean up late-game.</p>"

The increased reliability of Rest as recovery lends Sandaconda the longevity to check Pokemon like Grafaiai and Passimian. Options like Stealth Rock, Glare, and Coil diversify Sandaconda into a great support Pokemon or a bulky setup sweeper. Sandaconda is an excellent Terastallization user to boot, enhancing its defensive profile to become even tougher to break or enabling its own sweeps. However, Shed Skin does not make Rest perfectly reliable, hampering Sandaconda's consistency. Physical attackers with super effective STAB moves like Brute Bonnet, Glastrier, and Virizion are very problematic for Sandaconda and coerce it to burn Terastallization for its team. Despite its Electric immunity, Sancaonda's lower special bulk can leave it to be overwhelmed by coverage and additional STAB attacks from Jolteon, Magneton, and Rotom. Sandaconda also faces competition from Regirock, another Stealth Rock setter that much more reliably takes on physical attackers like Snorlax, Glastrier, and Sneasel.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sandaconda has access to Body Press, which does hit Orthworm and Snorlax harder, but Rock Blast and Scale Shot provide better general coverage against most Pokemon immune to Ground. High Horsepower can be run instead of Earthquake if Thwackey is a teammate.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most Grass-types take little damage from Earthquake and threaten Sandaconda out with their STAB moves. Dipplin, Appletun, and Lurantis can wall Sandaconda in longer games. Lurantis and Toedscruel can remove Sandaconda's Stealth Rock and Rocky Helmet. Whimsicott and Calm Mind Virizion can easily take advantage of Sandaconda, though they don't appreciate Glare hurting their great Speed stats. Shaymin shrugs off paralysis from Glare thanks to Natural Cure. Tera Dragon and Scale Shot can give Coil Sandaconda some recourse against some Grass-types but can make its position against Pokemon like Dipplin, Whimsicott, and Dazzling Gleam Shaymin worse.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Ground</strong>: Ground-immune walls like Articuno and Dipplin can walk on Sandaconda, while Orthworm can use it as fodder for setting up Coil or entry hazards. Mesprit and Mismagius can use Sandaconda to set up, block its Glare with Substitute, and use Tera Fairy to completely wall sets with Scale Shot. Oricorio-F can set up on Sandaconda and use Taunt to deny Glare. However, Ground-immune Pokemon weak to Rock, such as Charizard and Oricorio-F, must be wary of Rock Blast or Stone Edge. Only Rotom-C, Vikavolt, and Rotom are immune to Glare.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Sandaconda's lower special bulk leaves it easily overwhelmed by Typhlosion, Jolteon, and Magneton, though all of them are OHKOed by Earthquake and must be wary of Sandaconda catching them with a defensive Terastallization.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Clawitzer, Floatzel, and Veluza hit Sandaconda for strong super effective damage and generally tolerate an Earthquake. Lanturn is capable of finishing off Sandaconda but is vulnerable to Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Sneasel is powerful enough to overwhelm Sandaconda with a boost or some chip damage and can pick off Sandaconda's offensive Scale Shot set with Ice Shard even if Sandaconda has a boost, though it takes a lot of Rocky Helmet chip damage from Sandaconda when it uses Triple Axel. Glastrier is bulky enough to take two five-hit Rock Blasts from Sandaconda and threatens it with a strong Icicle Crash.</p>",

Common physical attackers like Grafaiai, Passimian, and Regirock struggle to break through Sandaconda, and its great defensive profile enables it to consistently set up Stealth Rock. Rock Blast lets Sandaconda strike foes such as Articuno, Charizard, and Mismagius that it cannot touch with Earthquake. Alternatively, Glare lets Sandaconda spread paralysis and punish Pokemon like Dipplin, Orthworm, and Virizion that it would deal little damage to anyway. Rest and Shed Skin can keep Sandaconda healthy, especially as it takes on Poison Touch Grafaiai sets and Hisuian Qwilfish, although the inconsistency of Shed Skin can leave it out to dry. Rocky Helmet helps Sandaconda further wear down physical attackers like Snorlax, Regirock, and Hisuian Qwilfish trying to break through it, and it enables Sandaconda to punish U-turn from pivots like Mesprit, Grafaiai, and Passimian. Tera Poison makes Sandaconda a more reliable wall to physical attackers like Passimian, Brute Bonnet, and Virizion. Tera Ghost makes Sandaconda an even more sturdy wall to physical setup sweepers like Snorlax and Regirock, improves its matchups against Fighting-types like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel, and lets it spinblock Sandslash and Hitmontop. Tera Water helps Sandaconda handle Floatzel, Sneasel, and Glastrier.</p> <p>Sandaconda is a good physical wall for balanced teams looking to compress entry hazard setting on a teammate that isn't bothered as much by residual damage and status compared to Regirock, Orthworm, and Sandslash. Bulkier offensive teams also benefit from the utility and bulk Sandaconda offers in Glare and absorbing status from Weezing, Muk, and Hisuian Qwilfish for offensive teammates. Hisuian Qwilfish makes an excellent hazard-stacking core with Sandaconda, and they complement each other's defensive flaws; Hisuian Qwilfish defensively answers Grass-types like Dipplin, Virizion, and Whimsicott and Levitate Pokemon like Mesprit and Mismagius, while Sandaconda deals with Passimian, Sandslash, and Muk. Sandaconda's Water weakness makes teammates like Lanturn, Whimsicott, and Dipplin helpful for managing Clawitzer and Floatzel. Sandaconda is not offensively threatening to walls like Dipplin and Articuno, so teammates like Magneton and Charizard can compensate for Sandaconda's poor matchup against them and have an easier time against said targets if Sandaconda has paralyzed them with Glare. Sandaconda invites in hazard setters like Mesprit and Orthworm due to its passivity, so teamamates that can remove hazards like Lurantis and Hitmontop make good partners for Sandaconda.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Sandaconda serves as a deadly late-game threat with the powerful combination of Coil, Rest, and Shed Skin. Earthquake hits most of the tier for at least neutral damage, while Sandaconda's other attacking move hits Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake like Bombirdier, Oricorio-F, and Braviary. Scale Shot allows Sandaconda to boost its Speed, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame except for common Choice Scarf users like Typhlosion at +2. Alternatively, Stone Edge doesn't drop Sandaconda's Defense and has more immediate potential to threaten Flying-types like Oricorio-F, Articuno, and Charizard. Rest acts as excellent recovery to keep Sandaconda healthy and combines well with Shed Skin to make it more reliable and help it serve as a wall in early- and mid-game scenarios, especially when combined with Tera Dragon to flip matchups on common Water- and Grass-types like Lanturn and Rotom-C. Coil Sandaconda can opt to run less Speed in exchange for more bulk, with 224 Speed EVs and a neutral nature being enough to outpace base 110 Speed Pokemon at +1; however, running these Speed EVs means it no longer outspeeds common Chlorophyll sweepers like Victreebel and faster Choice Scarf users like Mismagius and Floatzel at +2. Sandaconda can also opt to run Attack investment instead of HP, but this makes it more difficult to wall the foes it's tasked with setting up on late-game.</p> <p>Levitate users such as Mesprit and Mismagius serve as potentially problematic Pokemon, since they are immune to Earthquake and can become fully immune to Sandaconda's moves, if it's running Scale Shot, with Tera Fairy, so specially bulky teammates like Hisuian Qwilfish and Snorlax can be extremely helpful to counteract them. Orthworm poses similar issues due to Earth Eater and Iron Defense, so wallbreakers that threaten it like Charizard and Typhlosion are invaluable as teammates. These two as well as Bombirdier and Glastrier also threaten Grass-types, which cause problems for Sandaconda pre-Terastallization. Water-types pose similar issues while also often carrying super effective coverage for Terastallized Sandaconda, so teammates like Snorlax, Poliwrath, and Virizion benefit it greatly. In return for all of these potential partners' help, Sandaconda turns many physical attackers into setup fodder. Some common examples of Pokemon completely walled by it late-game include Passimian, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Regirock; after Terastallization, this list expands to include other offensive threats like Floatzel, Lanturn, and Rotom-C.</p>"

Giga Drain is an alternative that pressures Rock- and Ground-types like Regirock and Sandslash while providing Hattrem with some recovery, but it worsens Hattrem's matchups against Steel-types and Brute Bonnet. Nuzzle offers valuable paralysis support; unlike Thunder Wave, it can paralyze opposing Hattrem and also break opposing Focus Sash and Sturdy users.

Teammates that appreciate entry hazards being out of the picture most appreciate Hattrem's type of support.

This means that Glastrier's most reliable defensive counterplay is somewhat specific, being limited to almost exclusively Regirock and Orthworm, none of which have reliable recovery, and the latter two of which often require Terastallization to fully check Glastrier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Glastrier can opt to run Heavy Slam alongside Tera Steel over High Horsepower to hit light foes like Mesprit and Steel-weak foes like Tera Fairy Dipplin and Malamar. However, trading out High Horsepower for Heavy Slam tends to be overkill, as Glastrier's standard three-move coverage sufficiently hits all relevant foes; furthermore, giving up High Horsepower makes it struggle more against foes like Hisuian Qwilfish. Glastrier can also consider running Substitute to ease prediction, but all of its coverage moves are near mandatory, and without Swords Dance, Glastrier can struggle to threaten the walls it needs to.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Glastrier's awful Speed means it can often be a target for offensive threats like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Passimian, though it often has to be chipped in order to not take them down with it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Threats</strong>: Iron Press users like Orthworm and Regirock can match Glastrier's setup and threaten it out, though they may at times require Terastallization to do so. Poliwrath and Snorlax can do the same with Bulk Up and Curse, respectively, though Snorlax must Terastallize first. Weezing is able to neuter Glastrier with Will-O-Wisp and can switch in fairly safely, only fearing boosted Icicle Crash.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Glastrier gets worn down rapidly by poison from Pokemon like Grafaiai and Muk as well as burn from Pokemon like Weezing and Mismagius; burn also neuters its damage.</p>",

Tera Ground gives Glastrier a resistance to Rock while boosting the power of High Horsepower, while Tera Water and Fairy flip Glastrier's weaknesses to common offensive types like Fire and Fighting. 252 Speed EVs allows it to outspeed slower walls like Regirock, while the bulk investment lets it take on powerful attacks from various threats in the tier.</p> <p>Glastrier greatly appreciates teammates that can help bring it in safely like Jolteon and Mesprit, since it often has to take a hit after switching in due to its poor Speed.

Due to its many weaknesses as an Ice-type, Glastrier loves teammates it can fall back on to support it; some of these teammates include Snorlax and Regirock. As a wallbreaker, Glastrier does exceedingly well alongside Pokemon like Grafaiai, Oricorio-F, and Typhlosion that can often take advantage of the holes that Glastrier makes in defensive cores through removal of foes like Snorlax and Regirock.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Grafaiai's excellent choice of abilities paired with its high Speed and strong offensive movepool lets it play several offensive roles in SV ZU. Pivot sets are Grafaiai's showpiece given its excellent Speed tier and options to keep up momentum; they are extremely disruptive thanks to Knock Off and the choice between Poison Touch to spread status and Prankster's synergy with Encore. Grafaiai can also put its excellent Speed to work as a Swords Dance sweeper, and it can be further enabled by Prankster, Encore, and Copycat. Grafaiai even has a viable Choice Scarf set, and it's effectively one of the fastest Choice Scarf users in the metagame. However, Grafaiai is altogether frail and possesses a bad defensive typing, leaving pivot and Swords Dance sets easily revenge killed or threatened out by faster offensive Pokemon like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Passimian, while its Choice Scarf set can be stonewalled by defensive Pokemon like Regirock and Orthworm without good prediction.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grafaiai can be a niche Prankster weather setter for sun teams that further provides safe entry and setup opportunities for its teammates with U-turn, Parting Shot, and Encore. Grafaiai has Taunt in its toolkit but struggles to use it effectively given its underwhelming bulk and the comparatively greater potential of Encore. Choice Band sets can work given Grafaiai's excellent Speed and powerful STAB moves, but they lack the outstanding Speed of Choice Scarf sets to avoid being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users and faster revenge killers. Toxic can be used on pivot sets with Prankster for more reliable status spreading than Poison Touch, but Grafaiai's frailty makes spending a turn to poison a foe risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Even Swords Dance Grafaiai struggles to break through Sandaconda and Weezing on its own without prior chip damage, and pivot sets struggle to do more than remove their items or use Encore on them. Regirock can fend off pivot Grafaiai short-term thanks to its bulk but can be worn down by a combination of Knock Off, poison, and chip damage, and it risks being OHKoed by Swords Dance Grafaiai's Low Kick. Despite a Poison immunity, Orthworm is a similar story to Regirock, though it can survive Swords Dance Grafaiai's boosted Low Kick if Terastallization isn't in the picture.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Spiritomb's trio of immunities to Double-Edge, Low Kick, and Prankster moves on top of its 4x resistance to Gunk Shot makes it an excellent wall to Swords Dance Grafaiai, but its dependence on Leftovers for recovery can lead it to being worn down by offensive pivot sets using Knock Off and U-turn, especially when Poison Touch is in the picture. Grafaiai can overwhelm Hisuian Qwilfish between Knock Off, U-turn, and its lack of recovery. Sneasel can \"trap\" Grafaiai by blocking its escape with Prankster Parting Shot and threatening it with its strong STAB moves, and its Ice Shard is still faster than Prankster Copycat.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Jolteon, Floatzel, and Hisuian Sneasel naturally outspeed Grafaiai and threaten it with their powerful STAB attacks, though they should be wary of Grafaiai's Prankster moves, Copycat in particular. Common Choice Scarf users such as Mesprit, Passimian, and Magneton similarly threaten to revenge kill Grafaiai and can gain momentum with their pivot moves, though Choice Scarf Grafaiai is faster than all of these and the aforementioned revenge killers. Choice Band Floatzel outspeeds Grafaiai's Swords Dance set and has Aqua Jet to finish it off even if Grafaiai has Prankster + Copycat.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Grafaiai distinguishes itself as a phenomenal offensive pivot and revenge killer by virtue of its decent Attack, powerful STAB options, and incredible Speed tier, outpacing the entire unboosted metagame and even many other Choice Scarf users such as Typhlosion and Passimian. Furthermore, Poison Touch gives Grafaiai the rare ability to punish otherwise safe switch-ins, such as Regirock and Sandslash, with a chance to get poisoned as it pivots out with U-turn. Gunk Shot is essential to dispatch threats such as Whimsicott and Virizion. Knock Off provides Grafaiai with the coverage to hit foes that resist its STAB moves such as Mismagius and Froslass. Additionally, it punishes bulky foes reliant on their items, such as Orthworm and Hisuian Qwilfish that cannot be afflicted by Poison Touch, as well as removing Rocky Helmet from the likes of Mesprit, Sandaconda, and Weezing to ease its pivoting later. Double-Edge grants Grafaiai an accurate STAB option and enables it to muscle past Poison-resistant Pokemon such as Muk and Hisuian Qwilfish, though it comes at the cost of recoil damage. Double-Edge also eliminates the need for predicting Terastallization from potential Tera Ground users like Oricorio-F and Charizard compared to Gunk Shot. Switcheroo can be used instead to restrict defensive checks such as Orthworm and Weezing, as well as Choice-locking setup sweepers such as Regirock, Oricorio-F, and Mesprit, though it requires subsequent use of Knock Off to be more measured to avoid unintentionally freeing them. Tera Dark allows Grafaiai to better revenge kill the likes of Mismagius and resist Sucker Punch from Brute Bonnet. Furthermore, gaining an immunity to Psychic-type moves can allow Grafaiai to turn the tables against the likes of Mespirit and Farigiraf in a pinch. Alternatively, Tera Normal can be used in conjunction with Double-Edge to let Grafaiai secure reliable OHKOs, dispatching threats like Jolteon and, after Stealth Rock damage, Typhlosion.</p> <p>Grafaiai fits well on offense and balance teams that can benefit from its ability to generate momentum and take on top offensive threats. Offensive setup sweepers such as Virizion, Mesprit, and Oricorio-F appreciate Grafaiai's ability to revenge kill opposing setup sweepers for them such as Farigiraf and Oricorio-F. Grafaiai can form offensive pivot cores with the likes of Floatzel, Jolteon, and Magneton, maintaining momentum and whittling down each other's checks. Grafaiai lures in Regirock and bulky Ground-type Pokemon like Sandaconda that are forced out by Floatzel and Virizion, while Grafaiai can return the favor by dealing with the likes of Whimsicott. Lanturn is especially notable for its ability to bring Grafaiai in safely via slow pivoting support. Physical wallbreakers such as Virizion, Glastrier, and Brute Bonnet can open up holes in opposing teams by eliminating bulky Pokemon like Snorlax, Regirock, and Sandaconda so Grafaiai can clean late-game. Powerful special attacking wallbreakers such as Alolan Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Clawitzer can take advantage of the physically defensive walls Grafaiai lures in such as Regirock, Orthworm, and Weezing, assisting Grafaiai in getting past them. Fire-types such as Charizard and Typhlosion can take on Orthworm for Grafaiai while also benefiting from Grafaiai chipping down a shared check in Regirock. Entry hazard setters such as Mesprit and Orthworm synergize well with the residual damage inflicted from Grafaiai's Poison Touch, frequent pivoting, and Knock Off support, putting additional pressure on its aforementioned defensive checks, as well as bringing offensive threats like Typhlosion into range for Grafaiai to pick them off. Mesprit can also help against Poison- and Ground-types like Weezing and Sandslash. Bulky setup sweepers such as Dipplin, Snorlax, and Regirock benefit from poison spread by Grafaiai's Poison Touch, allowing them to more easily outlast foes thanks to poison chip damage. Hazard removal support from the likes of Sandslash and Lurantis can help alleviate Grafaiai's weakness to chip damage that arises from its repeated pivoting.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Grafaiai is a threatening Swords Dance sweeper thanks to its high Speed and powerful STAB Double-Edge. Knock Off covers Ghost-types like Rotom, Spiritomb, and Mismagius that would otherwise wall Grafaiai, and it can soften up defensive Pokemon like Regirock and Orthworm to make them more easily picked off once they've been further chipped. Copycat's extra priority from Prankster lets Grafaiai overcome faster revenge killers like Jolteon, Sneasel formes, and Floatzel as well as Choice Scarf users such as Mesprit and Passimian, though its efficacy can fluctuate depending on the move that was used last. Low Kick is an alternative for a direct attack to knock down Rock- and Steel-types like the aforementioned Regirock and Orthworm as well as Magneton, overall enhancing Grafaiai's wallbreaking ability. Prankster is integral for sets running Copycat, but Grafaiai without it should use Posion Touch, which can help it make more progress against Regirock and other Pokemon early-game. Grafaiai can opt for an Adamant nature to increase its power for more reliable KOs against physically defensive Pokmeon such as Orthworm and Regirock with its coverage moves, relying more on Prankster Encore to sweep teams at the cost of moving after threats like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Mismagius. Tera Normal cranks up the power of Grafaiai's STAB move to blow through physical walls like Weezing and Sandaconda without needing much chip damage. Tera Fighting is an alternative Tera type that can be used to power up Low Kick in order to secure more KOs on troublesome foes like Regirock, Orthworm, and Magneton. Heavy-Duty Boots ensures Grafaiai won't be worn down if it comes out earlier in games to play as a revenge killer and soften up its checks with Knock Off. A Silk Scarf can further power up Tera Normal Grafaiai's Double-Edge to pull off feats like OHKOing Sandaconda and Weezing when at +2.</p> <p>Grafaiai fits on several types of teams thanks to its threatening offensive profile and great Speed, enabling it to be a revenge killer or cleaner alongside its role as a Swords Dance sweeper. Grafaiai especially benefits from pivot support from teammates such as Floatzel, Jolteon, and Mesprit to bring it in safely and widen setup opportunities for it. Grafaiai appreciates entry hazards from setters like Sandslash, Mesprit, and Regirock wearing down foes like Regirock, Dipplin, and Snorlax so it can more effectively sweep. Spikes setters like Froslass, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Orthworm are especially effective at softening up foes like Sandaconda, Regirock, and Magneton for Grafaiai. Grafaiai can maximize the utility of its hazard-setting partners by using Knock Off to remove Leftovers from Regirock as well as Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Sandslash, Sableye, and Hitmontop. Charizard, Passimian, and Typhlosion pressure Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton that stand in Grafaiai's way and can soften up teams with their wallbreaking capabilities. Defensive teammates such as Poliwrath and Lanturn can help against revenge killers such as Floatzel, while Weezing and Sandaconda can help against others such as Passimian and Alolan Persian.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Grafaiai uses Gunk Shot as its STAB move to most effectively threaten Grass-types like Whimsicott, Dipplin, and Virizion. Knock Off lets Grafaiai make quick progress, especially with Poison Touch, and it effectively punishes defensive switch-ins such as Hisuian Qwilfish, Orthworm, and Regirock that depend on their items for their longevity. Knock Off also provides coverage against frail Ghost-types like Froslass and Mismagius. Knock Off absorbers like Booster Energy Brute Bonnet and Dipplin are also threatened by STAB Gunk Shot and potential poisons from Poison Touch hindering them. U-turn has the best synergy with Poison Touch, breaks Focus Sash against entry hazard setters like Froslass and Lycanroc, and doesn't risk activating Passimian's Defiant unlike Parting Shot. Parting Shot allows Grafaiai to escape even faster Pokemon like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Mesprit in conjunction with Prankster, and its debuffs can enable Grafaiai's offensive and defensive teammates alike. Encore lets Grafaiai take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Articuno and Dipplin, and it can neutralize setup sweepers like Mesprit and Virizion. Prankster facilitates Encore even further, letting Grafaiai lock faster setup sweepers like Jolteon and Floatzel into their setup moves. Prankster Copycat can be used as an alternative to Encore to give Grafaiai a priority attack based on the last moved used and cut off would-be revenge killers like Choice Scarf Mesprit. Tera Dark affords Grafaiai a convenient defensive typing against Mesprit's Psychic-type STAB moves as well as Sucker Punch from Brute Bonnet. Tera Dark also powers up Grafaiai's Knock Off to more effectively threaten Mesprit and previously mentioned Ghost-types. However, Grafaiai is often better off not Terastallizing given the limited benefits it gains from doing so, better preserving the resource for a teammate.</p> <p>Grafaiai is a great enabler to offensive teammates, especially physical wallbreakers like Brute Bonnet, Glastrier, and Virizion that can take advantage of defensive Pokemon it lures in such as Sandaconda and Regirock. Other Fighting-types like Passimian and Hitmontop can also threaten Pokemon like Regirock, Orthworm, and Magneton for Grafaiai while benefitting from it softening up foes with Knock Off, poison status, and U-turn chip damage. Charizard and Typhlosion can threaten Orthworm and Magneton in particular for Grafaiai, and they're supported as wallbreakers by the safe entry points Grafaiai provides via U-turn and Parting Shot. Special setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Mesprit, Oricorio-F, and Calm Mind Jolteon also benefit greatly from Grafaiai creating setup opportunities with Encore and Parting Shot, and they threaten physically defensive Pokemon Grafaiai struggles against. Grafaiai relies on partners like Mesprit and Magneton to deal with Poison-type walls like Muk and Weezing. Bulky partners such as Lanturn and Snorlax can help Grafaiai against Jolteon, a common revenge killer. Dipplin and Sandaconda can intercept Choice Scarf Passimian from revenge killing Grafaiai, while Grafaiai helps them in return by threatening troublesome Grass-types like Whimsicott and Virizion. Floatzel is one more potential revenge killer to Grafaiai, and it can be handled by defensive teammates such as Poliwrath, Lanturn, and Dipplin.</p>"

Orthworm has two pain points holding it back from further success: special attacks threaten severe damage to it, and it can get worn down rapidly due to its lack of a reliable recovery move, especially if it loses its Leftovers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Orthworm can opt to run a few other Tera types if it desires; Tera Electric allows it to avoid being hit super effectively by any attack, while Tera Poison and Tera Fairy provide a Fighting resistance as well as additional defensive utility in more specific matchups. However, these Tera types introduce weaknesses to wallbreakers like Mesprit and Magneton, which are more common than Ghost-types like Mismagius and Rotom.

        "description": "<p>Orthworm is an excellent defensive Pokemon thanks to its great physical bulk, Steel typing, and complementary immunity to Ground from Earth Eater. Common Pokemon like Snorlax, Sandslash, and Sandaconda struggle to break through Orthworm on their own, while other Pokemon like Grafaiai, Farigiraf, and Mesprit must either dedicate a coverage move for Orthworm or Terastallize. Orthworm's fantastic defensive profile gives it ample opportunities to switch in and set up entry hazards with Stealth Rock and Spikes for its teammates. Orthworm is also a resilient hazard setter against Sandslash, one of the few common hazard removers. Heavy Slam has the best immediate power and coverage of Orthworm's attacks against foes like Grafaiai and Articuno, deals super effective damage to Froslass, and wrecks Whimsicott and Tera Fairy Pokemon such as Jolteon and Mesprit. Body Press is strong against Snorlax and Glastrier, and it 2HKOes heavier foes and Electric-types such as Magneton and Jolteon. The increased resilience and additional power to Body Press provided by Iron Defense enable Orthworm to beat physical attackers like Brute Bonnet, set up on setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Floatzel and Curse Snorlax, and overwhelm physically defensive Pokemon such as Brute Bonnet and Regirock lacking Iron Defense. Orthworm can lean into its hazard setting capabilities by running Stealth Rock and Spikes, taking advantage of Choice item attackers like Mesprit and Grafaiai and accepting its own lack of longevity as a defensive Pokemon. Protect helps Orthworm maximize recovery from Leftovers and scout Choice item attackers like Passimian, Magneton, and Typhlosion. Tera Ghost makes Orthworm more secure against Fighting-type physical attacks like Close Combat from Passimian and Glastrier, Body Press from Regirock and opposing Orthworm, and Low Kick from Grafaiai. Tera Ghost also enables Orthworm to block Rapid Spin from Sandslash to preserve the entry hazards it sets, and it's especially helpful against Hitmontop. Tera Electric leaves Orthworm without weaknesses, so it can more efficiently set hazards and take on physical attackers. Orthworm's EVs are tailored to patch up its lower special bulk to enable it to take on special attackers like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Whimsicott more comfortably while still giving it enough physical bulk to survive a +2 Low Kick from Grafaiai, Close Combat from Passimian, and 2 Low Kicks from Sneasel.</p> <p>Orthworm is a good fit for bulky offense teams looking for an entry hazard setter, and its limited longevity is a better fit for the playstyle compared to more passive hazard setters like Sandaconda. Offensive Pokemon such as Charizard, Jolteon, and Typhlosion adore checks to them like Snorlax and Regirock taking residual damage from Orthworm's entry hazards. Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Sneasel commonly run Knock Off, which complements Orthworm's entry hazards by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Hitmontop and Charizard and helping wear them down. Charizard can comfortably take Orthworm's attacks and threaten it out, so Orthworm appreciates support from partners like Snorlax, Floatzel, and Lanturn that can threaten Charizard and other Fire-types like Typhlosion. Hazard removers like Lurantis are appreciated by Orthworm because residual damage from Spikes racks up quickly on it and limits its defensive capabilities. Rapid Spin users like Sandslash, Hitmontop, and Cryogonal remove entry hazards without removing Orthworm's entry hazards. Fighting-types like Virizion and Passimian can overpower Orthworm with their super effective STAB moves, so checks to them such as Mesprit, Charizard, and Weezing are appreciated. Orthworm is a great partner for Pokemon vulnerable to Ground-types, such as Jolteon and Lanturn.</p>"

Iron Tail and Body Press cover much of the tier together, while Substitute lets Orthworm avoid burn from foes like Mismagius, and Weezing. Substitute also prevents Orthworm from being phazed by Dragon Tail from the likes of Dipplin and protects it from revenge killers like Passimian.

A Weakness Policy on Stored Power sets can take advantage of weaker attacks like Knock Off and U-turn from Mesprit but is situational, tough to activate, and limits Farigiraf's longevity. Cud Chew, with a Sitrus Berry, can give Farigiraf more concentrated recovery than Leftovers, and, with a Lum Berry, it can help it more comfortably set up against Glare Sandaconda and Toxic Hisuian Qwilfish. Sap Sipper can provide Farigiraf with setup opportunities against Whimsicott and Shaymin locked into Grass-type moves. However, Armor Tail best enables Farigiraf as a sweeper by guarding it from priority moves. Farigiraf can run an offensive Trick Room set, though Alolan Exeggutor often does this role better because of its greater power and coverage.

Snorlax takes significant damage from a boosted Psyshock, though. Dipplin and Appletun can phaze Farigiraf with Dragon Tail; similarly, Articuno can use Haze to clear away Farigiraf's boosts or Roar to phaze it, and it has the bulk and recovery to repel Farigiraf repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: With Taunt, Oricorio-F and Mismagius can prevent Farigiraf from setting up, which is especially disruptive if Farigiraf lacks boosts and has Stored Power, and they can set up on it in return.</p>",

However, Stored Power provides less immediate damage for breaking teams and is more inflexible by requiring Farigiraf to spend multiple turns boosting. Farigiraf can effectively use Tera Blast as a STAB move to beat Dark-types like Brute Bonnet, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Sneasel. After Terastallizing, it transforms into Tera Blast Fire, which lets it beat Orthworm, Magneton, Spiritomb, and Tera Steel Pokemon like Rotom-C and Weezing.

Farigiraf can invest fully in its Special Attack to become immediately more threatening, potentially sweeping just off of Agility, but full investment in HP gives it better opportunities to use multiple setup moves; Psyshock is better tailored for sets with maximum Special Attack investment, compared to Stored Power, which works better on maximum HP sets where it can more comfortably accumulate multiple boosts.</p> <p>Farigiraf fits on hyper offensive teams as a setup sweeper. Fellow setup sweepers such as Virizion, Braviary, and Oricorio-F greatly appreciate partnering with Farigiraf, given its positive matchups against Prankster disruptors like Grafaiai, Whimsicott, and Sableye. Powerful offensive partners like Glastrier, Virizion, and Typhlosion can break holes in teams for Farigiraf to more easily sweep. Farigiraf has to exhaust Terastallization in order to beat Spiritomb, so it appreciates partners that can deal with it, such as Whimsicott and Magneton. Hyper offense leads like Froslass and Lycanroc can set up entry hazards to help weaken foes like Regirock, Dipplin, and Hisuian Qwilfish to better enable Farigiraf to sweep. Orthworm is a tough target for Fargiraf to break on its own, so it appreciates help from Fire-type teammates like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Oricorio-F that can pressure it. Fighting-type partners like Passimian, Virizion, and Hitmontop can handle Orthworm as well as another obstacle to Farigiraf in Regirock. Offensive partners like Magneton and Sandslash can pressure Hisuian Qwilfish for Farigiraf. Hisuian Sneasel is a standout partner for Farigiraf by checking all three aforementioned stops to it, while Fargiraf pressures its defensive answers such as Weezing and Mismagius.</p>"

  "Brute Bonnet": {
    "overview": "<p>Brute Bonnet is a menacing attacker in ZU thanks to a laundry list of highly useful offensive attributes. Brute Bonnet's STAB combination hits much of the tier for neutral damage, and it can utilize coverage moves to cover the few Pokemon that it can't, such as opposing Brute Bonnet, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Virizion. STAB Sucker Punch allows Brute Bonnet to cleave through weakened offensive teams late-game, and Synthesis in conjunction with its solid bulk makes Brute Bonnet difficult to chip down. Brute Bonnet is also capable of boosting its already high Attack stat with Booster Energy, making it a potent wincon, or by utilizing a Choice Band set, which turns it into a devastating wallbreaker. However, Brute Bonnet is burdened with a poor defensive typing, as it is weak to common Fighting-, Bug-, Ice-, and Poison-type attacks. Its poor Speed tier also leaves it very reliant on Sucker Punch to reliably threaten offensive teams, and they often carry Fighting-, Dark-, or Fairy-types that resist it. Brute Bonnet is capable of using Terastallization to circumvent these issues; however, this makes the standard offensive set Tera-dependent in many matchups. The Choice Band set can also be taken advantage of, as Brute Bonnet's STAB combination can be played around with common Pokemon that fit on both offensive and bulkier team styles, such as Dipplin, Virizion, and Charizard.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Growth is Brute Bonnet's best boosting option; it is especially dangerous under sun, where Protosynthesis is activated and Growth grants +2 Attack. This makes Tera Dark set with Growth / Sucker Punch / Crunch / Close Combat with Dread Plate or Life Orb especially dangerous on sun teams, as Brute Bonnet becomes extremely powerful with these boosts and can break down defensive cores for its fellow sun sweepers, such as Leafeon, Scovillain, and Victreebel, to take advantage of. Growth sets can also be run outside of sun teams, but Brute Bonnet's power is much less impressive, and such a set tends to require significant support to be effective when not under sun. Zen Headbutt can be used to hit bulky Poison-types harder, most notably Weezing and Muk, but Close Combat's targets are generally more relevant. Tera Blast can be run on offensive sets utilizing Tera Poison to hit several of Brute Bonnet's traditional checks, including Virizion, Whimsicott, and Dipplin. Such sets should use Booster Energy in order to 2HKO Dipplin after Stealth Rock damage. This makes Brute Bonnet reliant on Terastallizing in almost every single game to be effective, however, and forces Brute Bonnet to drop Close Combat, which makes it vulnerable to threats such as Orthworm, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Glastrier. Trailblaze can boost Brute Bonnet's Speed, but it is quite weak, and Brute Bonnet is still quite slow even after a boost. As a result, Sucker Punch is generally a more reliable way to take down faster threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Most of the tier's Fighting-types are quite threatening to Brute Bonnet. Virizion, and Hisuian Sneasel all resist Brute Bonnet's STAB moves and threaten it heavily in return with their own Fighting-type STAB moves. Passimian easily outruns and threatens Brute Bonnet with both Close Combat and U-turn. Brute Bonnet can turn the tables on all of them by running Tera Poison, however.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls</strong>: Dipplin takes all of Brute Bonnet's attacks with ease and can phaze it with Dragon Tail. Weezing can chip Brute Bonnet down with Rocky Helmet and burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Hisuian Qwilfish is also a good check, as Brute Bonnet fears its Poison-type STAB moves and struggles to take it down due to Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Fast Revenge Killers</strong>: Dark-resistant foes that are faster than Brute Bonnet generally present problems for it, as it is reliant on Sucker Punch to threaten faster foes. Whimsicott takes Sucker Punch with ease and can threaten Brute Bonnet with Moonblast, U-turn, or Switcheroo. It can also cripple Brute Bonnet with Encore should it choose to Terastallize. Sneasel outruns Brute Bonnet and threatens to OHKO it with Triple Axel. While not weak to Sucker Punch, foes with certain setup options such as Substitute + Calm Mind Jolteon, Nasty Plot + Encore Mesprit, or Tera Fighting Quiver Dance Oricorio-F can force Brute Bonnet into an uncomfortable guessing game or, in the case of Mesprit, lock it into Sucker Punch and turn it into setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Any form of status is crippling to Brute Bonnet. Common foes such as Charizard, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Spiritomb can all neuter Brute Bonnet with a debilitating status condition. Tera Poison makes Brute Bonnet immune to attempts by Hisuian Qwilfish to poison it, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Crunch is generally preferred over Seed Bomb, as Dark is a superior offensive typing and hits more of the metagame for neutral damage. It notably hits Muk, Weezing, Dipplin, and Articuno harder, but keep in mind that Brute Bonnet will still need the latter three to be chipped if it hopes to break through them. Crunch also comes with a handy chance to drop Defense, which can be useful in a late-game situation when faced down with Dipplin. However, Seed Bomb can be considered, as it hits Sandslash, Sandaconda, and Lanturn harder. Sucker Punch is mandatory, as Brute Bonnet is quite slow, and access to powerful priority allows it to become threatening to offensive builds. Close Combat provides crucial coverage against foes such as Orthworm, Glastrier, and opposing Brute Bonnet. It also hits Hisuian Qwilfish and Virizion neutrally, which is crucial, as they are among the few Pokemon that resist Brute Bonnet's STAB attacks. Synthesis allows Brute Bonnet to stay healthy throughout a match and allows it to potentially outlast defensive Pokemon that try to beat it with consistent chip damage, such as Snorlax, Sandaconda, and Naclstack. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Brute Bonnet to come in multiple times throughout a game without fear of chip from entry hazards; this makes it quite challenging to take down in conjunction with Synthesis. On the other hand, Booster Energy gives Brute Bonnet a one-time boost to its Attack, which makes it a very threatening late-game wincon. Notably, it allows Sucker Punch to OHKO Jolteon after Stealth Rock damage while significantly improving damage rolls against crucial targets such as Grafaiai and Floatzel. Booster Energy can only be used once, however, which restricts Brute Bonnet's flexibility throughout a game. Tera Poison is the preferred Tera type, as it grants Brute Bonnet a resistance to Fighting-, Bug-, Poison-, and Fairy-type attacks. This allows it to turn the tables on several of its traditional checks, such as Passimian. Tera Water can also be used to give Brute Bonnet a resistance to Fire- and Ice-type attacks, letting it deal with Sneasel, Glastrier, and Typhlosion. An Adamant nature is run for maximum damage output.</p> <p>Brute Bonnet's powerful attacks and access to Sucker Punch give it a solid place on many balance and offensive teams. Do note that it is best to use teammates that are not reliant on Terastallizing to perform their roles consistently, as Brute Bonnet often needs to Terastallize if it is looking to sweep late-game. Brute Bonnet benefits from teammates that help to chip down its offensive answers into range of its powerful Sucker Punch. Fast pivots such as Passimian, Jolteon, Floatzel, and Grafaiai can help chip much of the offensive metagame, and Brute Bonnet also appreciates their ability to get it in safely. On the other hand, physically bulky teammates such as Weezing and Sandaconda check Fighting-types like Passimian and Primeape. All three also run Rocky Helmet, which is great to further chip physical attackers like Sneasel, Hisuian Sneasel, and Virizion. The latter two also set Stealth Rock to chip down Brute Bonnet's offensive answers even further. Two of Brute Bonnet's best and most common answers are Charizard and Whimsicott, so special walls such as Snorlax help by checking these big threats. Brute Bonnet pairs well with other powerful wallbreakers, such as Magneton, Floatzel, and Glastrier, as they can help to break down each other's defensive answers; the former two can also pivot to get Brute Bonnet in safely.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Brute Bonnet uses its great STAB combination, good overall coverage, and sizable bulk to become an effective wallbreaker. Close Combat allows Brute Bonnet to hit foes such as Orthworm, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Virizion hard. Sucker Punch allows Brute Bonnet to revenge kill dangerous offensive threats such as Floatzel, Magneton, and Typhlosion in an emergency. However, it should be used with caution, as being locked into Sucker Punch is very undesirable due to how easily it can be exploited by the opponent. Tera Dark gives Crunch a significant power boost, giving Brute Bonnet the ability to 2HKO bulky foes such as Weezing and Orthworm after Stealth Rock. Tera Fighting, however, can be used as an alternative to power up Close Combat, allowing it to OHKO Virizion and 2HKO defensive Hisuian Qwilfish after Stealth Rock. An Adamant nature is required to give Brute Bonnet as much power as possible.</p> <p>Choice Band Brute Bonnet fits best on bulky offense and balance teams. Brute Bonnet tends to invite in threats such as Virizion, Passimian, and Whimsicott to attempt a revenge kill. Bulky Poison-types such as Weezing and Muk are therefore standout partners, as they can help stave off these threats. Brute Bonnet complements them by coming in on Ground- and Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Sandaconda and Mesprit, which offensive teammates such as Hisuian Sneasel and Jolteon appreciate as well. Dipplin is another great teammate that can help out against most physical revenge killers. A specially bulky teammate, such as Mesprit or Lanturn, can help stave off revenge killing attempts from the likes of Charizard, Typhlosion, and Magneton; the last two also help Brute Bonnet get in safely with their slow pivot moves, while the first two can set Stealth Rock or spread status for Brute Bonnet to take advantage of. Brute Bonnet is also quite slow, and it benefits from VoltTurn partners that can get it in safely. It therefore loves faster pivoting teammates, such as Jolteon, Choice Scarf Passimian, and Choice Scarf Floatzel, that can help it overcome the shortcoming of its low Speed. These teammates appreciate Brute Bonnet's wallbreaking capabilities facilitating a potential late-game sweep. Brute Bonnet hates being statused, so teammates that can absorb attempts to burn and paralyze it, such as Naclstack, Typhlosion, and Lanturn are appreciated. It also appreciates paralysis being spread onto the opposing team, as teams can take advantage of its poor Speed tier. As such, teammates like Lanturn and Sandaconda make for good partners.</p>"

  "Dipplin": {
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dipplin's shallow movepool leaves little room for variety. Tera Water eliminates its Ice weakness and defensively answers Floatzel and Glastrier, but it does not fix Dipplin's vulnerability to Articuno's Freeze-Dry and worsens its matchups against Virizion and Brute Bonnet, physical attackers that it would otherwise check.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Whimsicott</strong>: The Grass / Fairy typing leaves Whimsicott barely scratched by Dipplin's Giga Drain and immune to Dragon Tail. Even without Choice Specs, Whimsicott has a 93.4% chance to 2HKO Dipplin with Moonblast. Even if Dipplin Terastallizes, pivot Whimsicott sets can lock Dipplin into a non-damaging move with Encore and whittle it down.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Articuno 2HKOes Dipplin with Freeze-Dry, has great bulk and Roost, can remove Dipplin's boosts with Haze or Roar if it Terastallizes, and can PP stall Dipplin with Pressure. Cryogonal has Freeze-Dry, recovery, and Haze similar to Articuno but isn't as bulky. Sneasel, Froslass, and Glastrier overcome Dipplin's massive Defense by exploiting its 4x Ice weakness, but Dipplin Terastallizing sours their positive matchups against it. Choice Band Floatzel 2HKOes Dipplin with Ice Spinner.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Charizard 2HKOes Dipplin with Hurricane and can switch in while Dipplin uses Growth, Recover, or Giga Drain. Oricorio-F similarly 2HKOes Dipplin with Hurricane, threatens to set up on Dipplin with Quiver Dance, and can Taunt Dipplin. Braviary can use Bulk Up and Brave Bird to power through Dipplin while avoiding Dragon Tail with Substitute. Dodrio can cut through Dipplin's physical bulk if it gains a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Choice Specs Jolteon 2HKOes Dipplin with Alluring Voice. Shaymin can exploit the Special Defense drops from Seed Flare and one of its coverage moves to break through Dipplin, and it has the bulk to take boosted hits from Dipplin. Alolan Exeggutor takes a big chunk of damage from Dragon Tail but can switch in on Recover, Growth, or Giga Drain and exploit the negative priority of Dragon Tail to blow Dipplin away with Draco Meteor. Vikavolt 2HKOes Dipplin with Bug Buzz and can comfortably take attacks from Dipplin. Clawitzer must be wary of Giga Drain but has a 68.8% chance to OHKO Dipplin with a Choice Specs-boosted Dragon Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Tera Fairy Users</strong>: Dipplin's dependence on Dragon Tail to phaze setup sweepers makes it setup fodder for Tera Fairy users like Nasty Plot Mesprit, Calm Mind Jolteon, and Mismagius. Snorlax must fish for paralysis with Body Slam but can overcome Dipplin in the long run with luck.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Dipplin relies on its Eviolite for its bulk and is vulnerable to damaging entry hazards, which force it to use its limited Recover more often and become more passive. Toxic from Hisuian Qwilfish, Muk, and Toedscruel puts Dipplin on a timer and prevents it from gaining enough boosts to sweep. Even burns from switching into ideal foes like Lanturn hurt Dipplin's longevity and dampen the power of its Dagon Tail. Weezing can fish for a poison on Dipplin with Sludge Bomb, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and wash away its boosts with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Haze and Phazing</strong>: Weezing, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Muk can wipe Dipplin's boosts with Haze and threaten it with their Poison-type STAB moves, and they have the bulk to take even boosted hits from Dipplin.</p> <p><strong>Encore</strong>: Sableye can switch in as Dipplin sets up and lock it into a non-damaging move like Growth or Recover. Even if Dipplin Terastallizes to improve its matchups against them, Mesprit and Grafaiai can still disrupt it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Growth": {
        "description": "<p>Dipplin is a fantastic check to physical attackers like Regirock and Passimian thanks to its substantial physical bulk and ability to absorb Knock Off. Dipplin's walling capabilities give it many opportunities to set up Growth against passive or ineffective foes like Sandaconda and Brute Bonnet to function as a bulky sweeper. Dragon Tail phazes setup sweepers that might try to break through Dipplin such as Snorlax, Virizion, and Malamar. Giga Drain keeps Dipplin healthy as it attacks to make it less reliant on Recover to quickly devour Pokemon weak to Grass like Regirock, Poliwrath, and Sandaconda. Sticky Hold distinguishes Dipplin from other NFE Pokemon dependent on their Eviolite such as Hisuian Qwilfish by protecting Dipplin from Knock Off, Switcheroo, and Trick from users like Grafaiai and Mesprit. Tera Poison improves Dipplin's matchups against Fighting-types like Hisuian Sneasel, allowing it to maintain good matchups against Poison-types like Grafaiai and Hisuian Qwilfish as well as an immunity to poison at the cost of vulnerability to Mesprit and Farigiraf. Tera Fairy protects Dipplin from being phazed by Dragon Tail from opposing Dipplin and Appletun, and it improves Dipplin's vulnerability to Alolan Exeggutor and Appletun. Tera Steel turns the tables against checks like Glastrier, Sneasel, and Tera Fairy Mesprit and protects Dipplin from poison from Grafaiai, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Muk at the cost of worsening its matchups against Fighting-types.</p> <p>Dipplin's capability to absorb Knock Off makes it a great partner to Pokemon that are reliant on their items, including Articuno, Regirock, and Hisuian Qwilfish. Snorlax is an excellent partner to handle threats to Dipplin like Articuno, Typhlosion, and Charizard, and Dipplin takes physical attacks and Knock Off from Poliwrath, Passimian, and Sandslash for Snorlax in return. Dipplin amplifies residual damage from entry hazard stacking thanks to Dragon Tail, so hazard setters like Hisuian Qwilfish, Orthworm, and Sandslash have great synergy with Dipplin. Knock Off users like Mesprit, Passimian, and Grafaiai can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes to ensure they take damage from entry hazards when Dipplin uses Dragon Tail. Teammates weak to Water and Grass like Regirock, Sandaconda, and Sandslash appreciate Dipplin taking on Floatzel, Brute Bonnet, Lanturn, and Virizion for them. Teammates like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Orthworm can handle special attackers with Fairy- and Ice-type coverage for Dipplin, offensively checking Whimsicott and Articuno. Regirock and Naclstack help Dipplin by defensively answering Flying-types like Dodrio, Charizard, and Oricorio-F for it. Dipplin is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by chip damage from hazards, so it depends on partners with hazard removal like Sandslash and Hitmontop to mitigate this vulnerability.</p>"
