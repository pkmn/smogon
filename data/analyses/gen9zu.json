        "description": "<p>Sandaconda serves as a deadly late-game threat with the powerful combination of Coil, Rest, and Shed Skin. Earthquake hits most of the tier for at least neutral damage, while Sandaconda's other attacking move hits Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake like Bombirdier, Oricorio formes, and Braviary. Scale Shot allows Sandaconda to boost its Speed, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame except for Hisuian Electrode at +1 and outpacing common Choice Scarf users like Kingdra at +2. Alternatively, Stone Edge doesn't drop Sandaconda's Defense and has more immediate potential to threaten Flying-types like Oricorio formes, Bombirdier, and Charizard. Rest acts as excellent recovery to keep Sandaconda healthy and combines well with Shed Skin to make it more reliable and help it serve as a wall in early- and mid-game scenarios, especially when combined with Tera Dragon to flip matchups on common Water- and Grass-types like Swords Dance Qwilfish and Hisuian Decidueye. Coil Sandaconda can opt to run less Speed in exchange for more bulk, with 224 Speed EVs and a neutral nature being enough to outpace base 110 Speed Pokemon at +1 and still outpace Choice Scarf Bruxish at +2; however, running these Speed EVs means it no longer outspeeds common Chlorophyll sweepers like Victreebel and faster Choice Scarf users like Mismagius and Floatzel at +2. Sandaconda can also opt to run Attack investment instead of HP, but this makes it more difficult to wall the foes it's tasked with setting up on late-game.</p> <p>Levitate users such as Mesprit and Mismagius serve as potentially problematic Pokemon, since they are immune to Earthquake and can become fully immune to Sandaconda's moves, if it's running Scale Shot, with Tera Fairy, so specially bulky teammates like Hisuian Qwilfish and Snorlax as well as faster teammates like Hisuian Electrode can be extremely helpful to counteract them. Orthworm poses similar issues due to Earth Eater and Iron Defense, so wallbreakers that threaten it like Charizard and Typhlosion are invaluable as teammates. These two as well as Bombirdier and Glastrier also threaten Grass-types, which cause problems for Sandaconda pre-Terastallization. Water-types pose similar issues while also often carrying super effective coverage for Terastallized Sandaconda, so teammates like Snorlax, Poliwrath, and Virizion benefit it greatly. In return for all of these potential partners' help, Sandaconda turns many physical attackers into setup fodder. Some common examples of Pokemon completely walled by it late-game include Passimian, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Rhydon; after Terastallization, this list expands to include other offensive threats like Bruxish, Qwilfish, and Hisuian Decidueye.</p>"
