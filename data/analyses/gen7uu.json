  "Empoleon": {
    "overview": "<p>Empoleon has access to a variety of utility options such as Stealth Rock, Defog, and Roar, enabling it to support its team in various ways. Its incredible defensive typing and natural bulk allow it to check a multitude of common threats in the tier, including Latias, Primarina, and Mega Pidgeot. Additionally, Empoleon's ability to force out these threats provides it with a ton of opportunities to either set up Stealth Rock or clear entry hazards from the field. While Empoleon faces competition as a hazard remover from Tentacruel, which has access to Toxic Spikes, its fantastic secondary Steel typing and greater mixed bulk give it an edge. However, its typing also leaves it weak to common offensive types such as Electric, Fighting, and Ground, making it easily exploited by Pokemon like Mega Manectric, Cobalion, and Krookodile. Furthermore, Empoleon lacks reliable recovery, which makes it prone to being worn down, although moves such as Protect can be run to mitigate this. Empoleon struggles to fit all of its great status options on one set, which can leave it hurting in some matchups.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A spread with 44 Speed EVs is an option, as it can let Empoleon outspeed uninvested Scizor and use Scald on it before it can escape with U-turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Manectric, Zeraora, and Rotom-C can KO Empoleon with their STAB moves. They also can take advantage of Empoleon for a free Volt Switch, gaining momentum and putting Empoleon's team further down. Rotom-C is particularly threatening, since it also resists Scald.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon like Terrakion, Cobalion, Infernape, and Toxicroak can hit Empoleon super effectively with their STAB moves. All of them bar Toxicroak dislike switching on a potential Scald burn, however.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Blissey are able to wall Empoleon and beat it one-on-one. However, they dislike having their items removed by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Empoleon will be easily worn down if Leftovers is negated in some way. Thus, Knock Off, burn damage, and entry hazards can cripple it a lot.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon like Suicune, Heal Bell Togekiss, and Reuniclus can beat Empoleon one-on-one. However, Empoleon can prevent them from setting up by phazing them with Roar. You must be careful to have other checks to these boosting threats, though, as Roar will no longer be a countermeasure to them once they are the last Pokemon left.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Wallbreakers like Mega Sharpedo can severely weaken Empoleon and prevent it from checking other threats depending on how heavily it invests in Special Defense. Ground-types such as Krookodile and Nidoking can threaten it with their respective STAB moves but fail to OHKO it and are OHKOed back by a Torrent-boosted Scald in a one-on-one situation. They still can pressure a chipped Empoleon, however.</p>",

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is a reliable STAB attack and has a solid chance to burn foes. Empoleon is a good user of Stealth Rock, as it is able to pressure common entry hazard removers such as Gligar and Rotom-H. If a Stealth Rock setter is not needed then Empoleon can use Defog to remove opposing entry hazards. Toxic stops Latias and Water-immune Pokemon such as Jellicent and Volcanion from taking advantage of Empoleon. Protect lets Empoleon mitigate its lack of reliable recovery by stalling for Leftovers healing. It also has the benefit of providing free turns to rack up Toxic damage. Knock Off can be used instead of Toxic or Roar, as it cripples Pokemon like Primarina and Hydreigon by removing their items and letting Empoleon take their hits more easily. It also eases the matchup versus opposing Empoleon and other bulky Water-types like Tentacruel by removing their passive recovery. Roar allows Empoleon to phaze setup sweepers such as Suicune, Nasty Plot Togekiss, and Calm Mind Latias.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Defense investment ensures that Empoleon is never OHKOed by Cobalion's Close Combat or Krookodile's Earthquake, while the rest of the EVs and a Calm nature maximize Empoleon's special bulk, allowing it to switch into the likes of Moltres and Primarina more easily. Leftovers provides Empoleon with a form of passive recovery, improving its longevity throughout the course of the battle. Torrent is Empoleon's most useful ability, as it powers up Scald when Empoleon's HP is low.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Empoleon should be used as a switch-in to threats like Latias, Primarina, and Mega Slowbro. However, it must be wary of Electrium Z Latias. It should take advantage of its ability to force out these threats by clearing entry hazards from the field or setting them up. Toxic and Knock Off should be used to cripple Pokemon like Primarina or predicted Water-immune switch-ins like Jellicent and Volcanion. Scald can be used very carelessly throughout the match, as it has a high chance to burn, which wears down foes and cripples physical attackers that try to switch in. However, against foes such as Latias it should be wary, as it needs Toxic to beat the likes of Calm Mind Latias, which can otherwise use Empoleon as setup fodder if it is lacking Roar. Avoid switching Empoleon in on a potential Scald burn or Knock Off because it will be more easily worn down without its Leftovers recovery. Protect can be used to scout Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile, letting you decide whether to keep Empoleon in to use Toxic or Scald, or switch to something that takes the incoming hit better. Roar should be used to prevent Pokemon like Latias and Suicune from setting up, but keep in mind that they can use Empoleon as setup fodder if they're the last Pokemon on the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Empoleon should be used primarily on bulkier teams that appreciate its ability to pivot into a number of threats. Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon, Florges, and Alomomola helps Empoleon by increasing its longevity. Sylveon and Florges can also provide Empoleon with Heal Bell support to cure it of a potential burn, which heavily cuts down on its longevity. Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Moltres, and Rotom-H, appreciate having Empoleon to reliably clear hazards. Additionally, Mega Aerodactyl can serve as a check to the Grass-, Electric-, and Fighting-types that threaten Empoleon such as Celebi, Mega Manectric, and Infernape. Checks to strong threats like Celebi and Latias are appreciated, as Empoleon can struggle to deal with Grassium Z and Electrium Z sets respectively, so Pokemon like Mega Altaria, Assault Vest Mienshao, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon make great partners. Hydreigon also appreciates Empoleon being able to check and cripple one of its best defensive answers in Primarina. If Empoleon is not the dedicated entry hazard remover, partners such as Mew, Gligar, and Mega Altaria are greatly appreciated to remove them in order to improve Empoleon's longevity. Pokemon that can sponge attacks from Fighting-types and force them out, such as Latias, Doublade, and Hippowdon, make for good partners for Empoleon. Latias is a particularly good teammate, since it can check Terrakion, Cobalion, and Infernape. Ground-types such as Krookodile, Nidoqueen, and the aforementioned Hippowdon are able to check Electric-types that Empoleon struggles with such as Mega Manectric and Zeraora. Empoleon appreciates having backup offensive checks to Pokemon like Latias and Togekiss, so Pokemon like the aforementioned Choice Scarf Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl make for good partners.</p>"

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia has a niche on bulkier teams due to its ability to remove multiple stallbreakers in the tier like Crawdaunt and Haxorus. Cresselia's humongous bulk also allows it to stomach hits from the strong physical wallbreakers in the tier such as Terrakion and Mamoswine. However, Cresselia not only provides defensive teams with a mixed wall and an emergency way to deal with the aforementioned threats but also can be a bulky wincon through the use of Calm Mind. Its defensive typing and ability are also decent, providing it with a good resistance to Fighting-types and a Ground-immunity to allow it to check Cobalion, Nidoking, and Choice Band Swampert, but its Psychic typing also makes it more susceptible to Pursuit and U-turn from Scizor while failing to offer resistances to anything else. Cresselia does get completely walled by Steel-types if it attempts to set up and is setup fodder against other setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor, Nasty Plot Togekiss, and Curse Mega Steelix. Cresselia's Twinkle Tackle is also unfortunately pretty weak and fails to OHKO even Pokemon that are weak to it such as Latias and Mega Altaria. It often needs a Calm Mind boost to take them out, but this can take up a turn where it must take another hit to remove the threat. Furthermore, Cresselia's only form of recovery, Moonlight, can be unreliable due to its low PP in longer games, and its lacking recovery also makes it a little more susceptible to constant chip damage from entry hazards and status.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used over Moonblast to lure in and remove Scizor, but this removes one of Cresselia's biggest niches in its Fairy coverage to eliminate traditional answers to Psychic-types such as Crawdaunt. If Cresselia can't afford to run a Z-Move, it still can use Leftovers to offer passive recovery throughout the match; however, Cresselia lacks the power it needs from Twinkle Tackle to remove threats such as Crawdaunt and Terrakion. Cresselia is seen on dedicated Trick Room teams as a defensive setter with a Mental Herb in order to guarantee setup once throughout the match and Lunar Dance to give a sweeper a second chance to setup. The archetype itself, however, is almost a gimmick in the tier and has many negative matchups against many different teams.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Toxic-Immune Setup Sweepers</strong>: Cresselia is still prone to being setup fodder to Swords Dance Scizor and Mega Steelix, which shrug off Toxic and resist both of its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Cresselia is seriously susceptible to status, especially Toxic, as it cripples it as a bulky sweeper while also wearing it down much faster due to a lack of passive recovery. Status from opposing walls such as Blissey and Slowbro can harm Cresselia immensely because of this.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Stakataka do not care for Cresselia's attacks and are immune to Toxic. They can easily capitalize on this and gain free turns to set up entry hazards or deal damage.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: While some Dark-types have to be wary of Twinkle Tackle, Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo can beat out Cresselia, while Bisharp and Mega Houndoom have the added advantage of taking neutral damage from it. These Dark-types outside of Bisharp also need to wary of possible poison.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Chandelure and Doublade use Cresselia as setup fodder, while Jellicent is able to use Taunt on Cresselia and prevent it from recovering. However, Chandelure and Jellicent cannot freely come in and risk getting poisoned.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive Z-Move": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock works as Cresselia's primary attack, hitting Blissey and other special walls while also nailing Poison-types like Nidoking, Nihilego, and Tentacruel. It also improves Cresselia's matchup against Calm Mind users such as Latias and Suicune. Moonblast enables Cresselia to lure in and damage common Dark-types that assume they have no issues switching in like Krookodile and Hydreigon. Calm Mind is on this set to allow Cresselia to muscle through and OHKO Terrakion, Heracross, and more offensive variants of Mega Altaria with Twinkle Tackle while also giving it a stronger Psyshock for Blissey. Cresselia can also be a possible bulky wincon through accumulating multiple Calm Mind boosts. Toxic can be used over Calm Mind to wear down passive threats and stallbreakers that aren't immune to Poison such as Jellicent and Mega Houndoom but this prevents Cresselia from being a wincon and OHKOing the aforementioned threats.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>16 EVs in Speed allow Cresselia to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt and OHKO it with Twinkle Tackle. The rest of the investment into Defense allows Cresselia to survive two Stone Edges from Choice Band Terrakion or Outrage from a boosted Dragon Dance Haxorus. Fairium Z lets Cresselia use a Twinkle Tackle and also reduces the damage of Knock Off from Krookodile and Mamoswine.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Twinkle Tackle should be used as a last resort against any stallbreakers that have gone out of control that the rest of your team cannot handle. It is also useful to surprise Dark-types that believe that they can come in with no penalty, so use careful predictions and scouting to ensure you make the most out of Twinkle Tackle. Avoid Toxic, as it cripples Cresselia as a possible bulky wincon by reducing its longevity. Burn damage can also be an issue, as it places Cresselia in range of being knocked out from Pokemon it's supposed to check such as Terrakion, Mega Altaria, and Choice Band Infernape. Toxic and Calm Mind are massive assets to Cresselia, so they must be used correctly depending on the situation. Calm Mind should be used when Cresselia needs to possibly break through and OHKO an offensive threat like Crawdaunt, Haxorus, or Terrakion. Use cleric support whenever it is necessary to assist Cresselia in removing status ailments so it isn't crippled by Toxic and other status. Even in quicker games, liberally using Moonlight can waste its PP and make Cresselia a complete liability for the rest of the game. Only use Moonlight when necessary to restore health to allow it to stomach a hit from a wallbreaker or avoid the KO from fast threats like Terrakion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cresselia fits best on stall and bulkier teams that can be troubled by frightening stallbreakers while appreciating a defensive sweeper. Cresselia appreciates cleric and Wish support from Blissey and Umbreon, as it keeps Cresselia from having to use up Moonlight PP and stops it from being crippled. Cresselia is easily pressured by Dark-types, so Mega Altaria, Sylveon, and Florges are able to stomach blows from them, and the last two can also pass Wishes. Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Stakataka can use Cresselia to remove Fighting-types that trouble them while also dealing with Bug-types like Scizor and Mega Beedrill that attempt to put a dent into Cresselia while gaining momentum. Entry hazards are key to chip Cresselia's victims down into range of Twinkle Tackle while also letting it sweep much more easily. The aforementioned Steel-types double as Stealth Rock setters for Cresselia due to their defensive typing to deal with Bug-types. Chesnaught works as a bulky Spikes setter that can handle Dark-types for Cresselia. Gligar and Moltres check Scizor and other Steel-types that Cresselia cannot harm while also providing pivoting through slow U-turns to give Cresselia more opportunities to come in without risking any damage.</p>"

  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>Upon Mega Evolution, Blastoise receives notable stat boosts in key areas such as Defense, Special Attack, and Special Defense to go along with a fantastic ability in Mega Launcher. Mega Launcher gifts moves such as Water Pulse, Dark Pulse, and Aura Sphere with STAB-like boosts, pairing nicely with Mega Blastoise's remarkable Special Attack stat. Its strong natural bulk, solid defensive typing in Water, and vast powerful coverage options make it an ideal bulky wallbreaker in the UU tier. To complement its offensive prowess, Mega Blastoise also has access to Rapid Spin, offering more utility to teams by clearing entry hazards. However, Mega Blastoise often finds itself worn down quickly due to its middling Speed tier and the numerous times it's forced to switch in and clear hazards, combined with its lack of recovery. Despite its high Special Attack and great coverage options, Mega Blastoise struggles to break past the tier's premier special walls in Blissey, Sylveon, and Alolan Muk. Other bulky Water-types like Calm Mind Suicune and Toxic Mantine also fear little from Mega Blastoise and can take advantage of it. While they cannot switch in directly, Volt Switch users such as Mega Manectric threaten Mega Blastoise, either getting off huge damage or gaining offensive momentum.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar lets Mega Blastoise phaze Calm Mind Suicune and force out Sylveon as it attempts to heal itself with Wish, opening wallbreaking opportunities later on, but it is generally not preferable to give up coverage moves. Scald is another STAB option with a decently high chance to burn foes, but its decrease in Base Power makes it suboptimal. Dragon Pulse provides good neutral coverage alongside Mega Blastoise's other moves, but it hits few Pokemon super effectively, making other coverage moves generally more effective. Flash Cannon may seem like a decent option, as it hits Sylveon and Florges super effectively, but its damage output is similar to Mega Blastoise's neutral Water-type STAB moves and it possesses little other use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Blissey, Alolan Muk, and Florges fear little from Mega Blastoise while at full HP and can proceed to wear it down with attacking or status moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Mega Manectric, Zeraora, and Raikou threaten Mega Blastoise with their powerful STAB moves, though they have a tough time switching into its powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss, Leaf Storm Celebi, and Mega Sceptile can all beat Mega Blastoise one-on-one, threatening it with their super effective STAB moves, but they must be wary of its potential super effective coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Primarina</strong>: Primarina possesses good special bulk and resists all of Mega Blastoise's common attacking moves, forcing it out in one-on-one situations.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mega Blastoise is often worn down as a match progresses due to its vulnerability to all entry hazards and its middling Speed stat that forces it to commonly stomach powerful hits from faster threats.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Toxic Mantine and Calm Mind Suicune take little damage from any of Mega Blastoise's attacks, letting them perform their roles in front of it.</p>",

      "Offensive Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Water Pulse is Mega Blastoise's most consistent STAB move, possessing perfect accuracy and receiving a Mega Launcher boost. Hydro Pump is a more powerful STAB option, notably dealing more damage to Water-neutral targets like Scizor and Swampert, but it is less reliable due to its 80% accuracy, making Water Pulse superior in most cases. Mega Launcher-boosted Dark Pulse hits Psychic-types that resist Water such as Latias, Starmie, and Celebi for huge damage, and it also punishes Ghost-types like Doublade and Gengar that may try to block Rapid Spin and pivot back out. Aura Sphere lets Mega Blastoise hit Dark- and Steel-types like Hydreigon and Empoleon super effectively, which also receives a boost from Mega Launcher. Alternatively, Ice Beam threatens Pokemon like Mega Altaria and Amoonguss that take relatively little from Mega Blastoise's other common moves. Rapid Spin clears all entry hazards on Mega Blastoise's side of the field, pairing nicely with its ability to force switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>152 Speed EVs let Mega Blastoise outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Scizor, though this stat can be customized to outspeed certain threats such as Volcanion and Magneton. After maximizing Special Attack, the remaining EVs are dumped into HP, improving Mega Blastoise's overall bulk as much as possible, notably improving its chance to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Aerodactyl's Stone Edge among other moves. Blastoisinite is necessary for Blastoise to Mega Evolve and receive its various stat boosts. Rain Dish lets Blastoise gain back some health if rain is active and it has yet to Mega Evolve, though it is useless in most cases. Mega Blastoise's ability, Mega Launcher, provides moves like Water Pulse, Dark Pulse, and Aura Sphere with a remarkable 1.5x damage boost.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Evolve Blastoise as soon as possible to take advantage of its numerous stat boosts and vastly superior ability in Mega Launcher. Due to its tremendous natural bulk and fantastic coverage options, Mega Blastoise can beat most of the tier's offensive threats one-on-one, and it should be used to do so if its health is not crucial for the rest of the match. Wear down or KO opposing special walls with either entry hazards or physically attacking partners before sending in Mega Blastoise to wallbreak, as Pokemon such as Blissey, Sylveon, and Alolan Muk stop it in its tracks while at full HP. Get rid of entry hazards with Mega Blastoise's Rapid Spin whenever possible, keeping itself and teammates from being worn down over time. It is preferable to bring Mega Blastoise in on free switches from U-turn and Volt Switch, as it is prone to being worn down quickly by repeated attacks and entry hazard damage. Aggressive predictions can help make the most of Mega Blastoise, especially in punishing faster switch-ins such as Latias and Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Blastoise fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate the offensive presence it brings alongside Rapid Spin. Physical wallbreakers such as Flame Orb Heracross and offensive Swords Dance Scizor make for great partners, breaking through the special walls like Blissey and Alolan Muk that Mega Blastoise struggles against. Grass-types like Amoonguss and Celebi absorb Electric- and Grass-type moves aimed at Mega Blastoise and appreciate its ability to threaten Fire-types like Entei. Amoonguss also serves as a strong answer to Primarina, one of Mega Blastoise's most sturdy answers. Choice Scarf Latias can cripple special walls with Trick and eliminate all residual damage on Mega Blastoise with Healing Wish, additionally providing similar defensive synergy to Hydreigon. U-turn users such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Scizor, and Infernape can get Mega Blastoise into favorable situations on free switches, reducing the amount of chip damage it is forced to take. Klefki is a fantastic partner, offering great defensive synergy with Mega Blastoise while laying down Spikes to help pressure its few solid switch-ins. Sylveon shares similar type synergy with Mega Blastoise and can heal it up with Wish or alleviate it of status conditions with Heal Bell. Grounded Poison-types like Nihilego, Nidoking, and Alolan Muk remove Toxic Spikes upon entry, possibly preventing Mega Blastoise from poisoning itself in order to remove them. These Poison-types double down as great answers to Sylveon, one of Mega Blastoise's most effective countermeasures.</p>"

  "Beedrill": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of amazing offensive stats and Adaptability, Mega Beedrill is among the best offensive pivots available. Its typing allows it to provide heavy offensive pressure to common Pokemon such as Primarina and Latias, while its access to good coverage options like Drill Run and Knock Off lets it hit the majority of the tier quite hard. Mega Beedrill also has access to Toxic Spikes, which it can use as it forces switches to wear down opposing Pokemon. However, Mega Beedrill has atrocious bulk, which leaves it vulnerable to Choice Scarf users, strong priority, and the ever-present Mega Aerodactyl. Its Stealth Rock-weak typing also keeps it from properly functioning as a pivot without an entry hazard remover on its team, thus complicating building with Mega Beedrill at times. Lastly, Mega Beedrill struggles to break past a few big presences in the tier, including Hippowdon, Scizor, and Mega Aerodactyl, due to its only decent coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance is an option for boosting Mega Beedrill's power to insane levels. However, it isn't preferable due to the fact that Mega Beedrill will often pivot out of play, thus frequently removing its boosts and usually wasting a moveslot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mega Aerodactyl</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl scoffs at any of Mega Beedrill's attacks, can outspeed it and OHKO it with its STAB attacks, and can even trap and KO it with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Crobat</strong>: While not faster than Mega Beedrill, Crobat still proves troublesome due to its 4x resistance to Beedrill's STAB attacks and immunity to Drill Run. Furthermore, it can use Defog to clear Toxic Spikes away and forces Mega Beedrill out due to the threat of STAB Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Despite its power, Mega Beedrill has trouble breaking past particularly bulky threats, including Mega Aggron, Hippowdon, and Alomomola. The latter two fear poisoning from either Poison Jab or Toxic Spikes and dislike losing their items, however.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Mega Beedrill's fragility makes it very vulnerable to common Choice Scarf users such as Infernape, Krookodile, and Nihilego due to their ability to outrun and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Mega Beedrill's horrid bulk makes it easily picked off by strong priority from the likes of Scizor, Entei, and Mega Absol.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and Metagross can force Mega Beedrill out and trap it with Pursuit, which will either KO or heavily weaken it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Despite its access to Drill Run, Mega Beedrill struggles to do any notable damage to bulky Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, Shuca Berry Metagross, and Cobalion. Magnet Rise variants of Klefki are particularly troublesome, as in addition to being able to wall Mega Beedrill, Klefki can cripple it with Prankster Thunder Wave or set up Spikes on it.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is a strong STAB attack when backed by Beedrill's high Attack stat and Adaptability and is useful for both gaining momentum and inflicting heavy chip damage on foes. Poison Jab is a strong secondary STAB attack that Beedrill can use to apply heavy offensive pressure to a plethora of Pokemon, including Primarina, Togekiss, Blissey, and Mega Sceptile. Drill Run offers excellent coverage alongside Mega Beedrill's STAB attacks, punishing common Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Klefki, Cobalion, and Volcanion. Knock Off burdens common switch-ins like Hippowdon and Alomomola with the removal of their items while also pressuring Ghost-type checks like Jellicent and Doublade. Toxic Spikes is a move Mega Beedrill can use, as it forces switches to potentially spread poison around the opposing team, adequately wearing down some of its defensive checks. Lastly, Pursuit can be used to trap and either weaken or KO a few Pokemon Beedrill forces out, such as Mega Sceptile, Celebi, and non-Choice Scarf Latias.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Attack maximizes Beedrill's offensive presence with a neutral nature. Full investment in Speed with a Jolly nature makes it as fast as possible, only leaving it outsped by Mega Aerodactyl and most Choice Scarf users and Speed tied with Timid Mega Sceptile. Adaptability is an extremely useful ability acquired upon Mega Evolution that puts immense power behind Mega Beedrill's STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Beedrill is best used as an offensive pivot due to its ability to force switches and gain momentum with U-turn throughout the entire match. U-turn should be used frequently early-game in order to sufficiently chip members of the opposing team. Upon forcing switches, Mega Beedrill can attempt to use either super effective coverage or Toxic Spikes rather than U-turn, depending on what it believes to be switching in or the team it's against. If a Ghost-type check or a Pokemon reliant on its item, like Swampert or Hippowdon, is predicted to come in, Knock Off is ideal to use in order to cripple them. However, Toxic Spikes can also be used as passive foes switch in due to Beedrill's ability to easily pivot out of play after setting a layer of them. Due to its frailty, Mega Beedrill should generally refrain from directly switching in, and instead it is better brought into play with the support of a pivot or after a teammate has fainted. Entry hazards should also be removed prior to switching Mega Beedrill in, as its Stealth Rock weakness in tandem with its frailty is quite capable of limiting its longevity. Mega Beedrill should refrain from staying in on priority users like Scizor, Zygarde-10%, and Mega Absol due to its aforementioned frailty.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon capable of pivoting with either U-turn or Volt Switch can form a VoltTurn core with Mega Beedrill and fit on VoltTurn offense with it extremely well. Examples include Infernape, Scizor, and Rotom-C, which is particularly good as a teammate due to its ability to pressure both bulky Water- and Ground-types extremely reliably for Mega Beedrill. Entry hazard support from the likes of Klefki, Nihilego, and Azelf can be useful for allowing Mega Beedrill to punish switches while more easily breaking past bulkier foes. Entry hazard removal from teammates like Latias, Starmie, and Tentacruel is also quite important due to Mega Beedrill's Stealth Rock weakness otherwise compromising its pivoting capabilities. Wallbreakers like Hydreigon, Volcanion, and Kyurem can aid Mega Beedrill in dealing with especially bulky threats such as Alomomola and Hippowdon while also appreciating the Toxic Spikes support it can provide. Rock-type Choice Scarf users such as Terrakion and Nihilego are specific yet useful partners to Mega Beedrill due to their ability to offensively check two of its biggest annoyances in Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat. Other checks to Flying-types, such as Rhyperior and Doublade, can deal with Mega Aerodactyl and Crobat as well while providing Stealth Rock support in the case of the former and sponging physical attacks in the case of the latter.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mega Pidgeot's great Speed tier, amazing offensive typing in Flying, and solid Special Attack make it a threatening attacker. No Guard gives Mega Pidgeot a 100% accurate Hurricane, which means it has something many special attacking Flying-types lack: a reliable, strong STAB move. Flying as an offensive typing is great, as few types resist it, although the types it hits super effectively are not very common. Mega Pidgeot also has solid coverage in Heat Wave, pivoting abilities in U-turn, and reliable recovery in Roost, giving it decent longevity and allowing it to fit on VoltTurn teams. Mega Pidgeot's flaws lie in its mediocre defensive typing, giving it very few useful resistances and a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock; its bulk is good enough to survive most neutral attacks, but not with Stealth Rock up, making entry hazard removal a priority on Mega Pidgeot teams. The high usage of Electric-types such as Mega Manectric do Mega Pidgeot no favors either, as they resist its STAB attack and deal heavy damage in return with Volt Switch or OHKO with Thunderbolt. While No Guard gives Mega Pidgeot an accurate Hurricane, it also makes every inaccurate move hit Mega Pidgeot itself, which means it cannot dodge moves such as Stone Edge, Toxic, and Icicle Crash. It also faces indirect competition from other Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Sharpedo, which are often faster and stronger than Mega Pidgeot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Ground can hit Nihilego, Magneton, and Empoleon, but that's about it. An alternative take on Mega Pidgeot could be in the form of a Work Up + Refresh set with Roost, as it's capable of setting up on defensive Pokemon and avoiding status, but there are often more convenient and capable stallbreakers out there, like Terrakion and Crawdaunt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Rotom-H can switch into Mega Pidgeot and gain momentum on it with Volt Switch or OHKO it with Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types such as Nihilego and Mega Aerodactyl can survive at least one hit from Mega Pidgeot and OHKO it in return with a super effective STAB attack or set up Stealth Rock on it.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority users such as Mamoswine, Scizor, and Klefki can either OHKO, heavily damage, or paralyze Mega Pidgeot before it can retaliate with Hurricane or Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Blissey, Empoleon, and Alolan Muk can easily survive repeated hits from Mega Pidgeot and set up entry hazards, cripple it with Toxic, or trap it with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users and Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster attackers such as Choice Scarf Infernape, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Mega Beedrill, Mega Sceptile, and +1 Mega Sharpedo outspeed and can OHKO or heavily damage Mega Pidgeot with a strong STAB move, although most are incapable of OHKOing it without Stealth Rock or a small amount of chip damage.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is Mega Pidgeot's main STAB move, dealing good damage to neutral targets and having a good chance to confuse the foe. Heat Wave hits Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Scizor, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing the latter. U-turn keeps up momentum on Mega Pidgeot's defensive checks like Nihilego. Roost gives Mega Pidgeot some form of recovery to heal off Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A standard offensive spread of maximum Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature allows Mega Pidgeot to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Mega Pidgeot's pre-Mega abilities are useless. Pidgeotite allows Pidgeot to Mega Evolve.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hurricane is the move you want to use the most because of the lack of Pokemon resisting it and its high Base Power. Don't attempt to switch Mega Pidgeot in on hits unless it absolutely has to, because it will fall to most decently powerful neutral hits with Stealth Rock up, when it would otherwise survive them. Instead, bring it in when a Pokemon faints or on a Volt Switch or U-turn. Use U-turn on Mega Pidgeot switch-ins, such as Nihilego and Blissey. Mega Pidgeot can survive some neutral hits, such as Cobalion's Close Combat and Mega Beedrill's Poison Jab, so try to keep Mega Pidgeot healthy enough to take these hits if necessary, so it can remove them with Heat Wave and Hurricane, respectively. Make sure that Stealth Rock is removed from the field before sending Mega Pidgeot in, since it despises being worn down, which will prevent it from being able to take neutral hits.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Pidgeot fits best on offensive teams, as its Speed tier and strong STAB attack makes it effective against opposing offensive teams, although it is lacking in the stall matchup because of Blissey. Entry hazard setters such as Rhyperior, Klefki, and Nidoqueen make for good teammates, since they can lay down Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes to wear down Mega Pidgeot's defensive answers. Electric-type checks such as Amoonguss, Seismitoad, and Mamoswine make for good teammates, as Mega Pidgeot appreciates their ability to sponge attacks from the likes of Mega Manectric. Amoonguss's Spore is able to incapacitate foes to give Mega Pidgeot free turns as well. Rock-type checks such as Cobalion and Swampert are also appreciated as teammates because they can switch in on Rock-types such as Nihilego, Mega Aerodactyl, and Terrakion, which Mega Pidgeot struggles against; Cobalion is also good at dealing with Blissey. Entry hazard removers such as Starmie and Hydreigon fit well on the types of teams that Mega Pidgeot finds itself on; these Pokemon can ensure that Mega Pidgeot is not worn down by Stealth Rock. Dragon-types such as Latias and Hydreigon can switch in on Electric-type moves from the likes of Mega Manectric. They also appreciate Mega Pidgeot's ability to wear down Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix. U-turn users such as Scizor and Hydreigon can also form a VoltTurn core with Mega Pidgeot to give each other momentum and wear down defensive Pokemon. Powerful wallbreakers such as Terrakion, Crawdaunt, and Scizor make great partners, as they can break through Blissey and the bulky Rock-types like Rhyperior that give Mega Pidgeot issues. They also appreciate being brought in safely via U-turn and benefit from Mega Pidgeot's ability to wear down their defensive checks. Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Hydreigon are appreciated, as they can revenge kill faster threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Manectric, and Mega Beedrill, with the former two being able to resist its STAB Hurricane.</p>"

  "Sandslash-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>An incredibly one-dimensional Pokemon, Alolan Sandslash's only niche is to set up Aurora Veil. To do so, it is partnered with Snow Warning Aurorus. Its ability, Slush Rush, allows Alolan Sandslash to outspeed most of the metagame, making it by far the most reliable Aurora Veil user. Its Ice typing allows Alolan Sandslash to threaten common Defog users, making it easy to keep Stealth Rock and Aurora Veil up. Additionally, its access to Rapid Spin allows Alolan Sandslash to support its team by removing entry hazards. Sadly, Alolan Sandslash's atrocious defensive typing and low Speed leave it vulnerable to the majority of the metagame outside of hail, and it has no use beyond setting up Aurora Veil.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Iron Head can be used as a secondary STAB move but is generally an inferior option, as Alolan Sandslash's niche is not attempting to wallbreak or sweep on its own. Similarly, Swords Dance can be used to increase Sandslash's Attack, but it generally falls short when compared to better options. Hail is another option and allows Alolan Sandslash to circumvent Hippowdon and Gigalith trying to change the weather to prevent Aurora Veil from being set up.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Hippowdon and Gigalith can disrupt hail and stop Aurora Veil from being set up. Although uncommon, Rain Dance users such as Klefki can also stop Aurora Veil from being used successfully.</p> <p><strong>Defog Users</strong>: While not all Defog users can beat Alolan Sandslash, a select few do and not only prevent Aurora Veil, but also remove Aurorus's Stealth Rock. Mantine and Moltres are at the forefront of these, although Moltres needs to be careful, as it is likely losing half its health upon switching in. Empoleon can Defog away the Aurora Veil but is forced out, as it gets 2HKOed by Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fast Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf Infernape is faster than Alolan Sandslash in hail and can easily OHKO it with any STAB move. Choice Scarf Latias can carry Hidden Power Fire to OHKO Alolan Sandslash, too, so it should be wary of that.</p> <p><strong>Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune</strong>: Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune can set up a Substitute easily on Alolan Sandslash carrying neither Knock Off nor Toxic, and it will be extremely hard to break once it has successfully done so.</p>",

      "Aurora Veil Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Aurora Veil is used to replicate the effect of Reflect and Light Screen and help Alolan Sandslash's teammates set up. Rapid Spin removes opposing entry hazards, which helps Alolan Sandslash prevent its teammates from getting worn down easily. Icicle Crash is a STAB move that threatens common Defog users such as Hydreigon. Earthquake is usually Alolan Sandslash's best last move, as it threatens Pokemon such as Chandelure and Cobalion that resist its STAB move and prevents them from setting up. It also 2HKOes Empoleon, which can otherwise Defog away Alolan Sandslash's Aurora Veil. Knock Off can be used to retain coverage for Chandelure and remove the items of Pokemon such as Suicune. Toxic can be used to punish Mantine's Defog and can stop Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune—a big threat to all Aurora Veil teams—from setting up freely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs coupled with a Jolly nature allow Alolan Sandslash to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame as well as some Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Hydreigon in hail due to its ability, Slush Rush. Maximum Attack investment is used to punish Defog users better. It also gives Alolan Sandslash a very good chance to 2HKO Cobalion with Earthquake after hail. Light Clay is used to extend the duration of Aurora Veil, as Sandslash is unlikely to get more than one opprtunity to set it up, which is its main role.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alolan Sandslash should come in while hail is still up so it can set Aurora Veil. If a foe has set up entry hazards before, Alolan Sandslash can remove them via Rapid Spin. Ghost-types can attempt to block it but do not switch into Sandslash easily. Standard Chandelure gets OHKOed by Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage, while Gengar does not even need to take Stealth Rock damage. Alolan Marowak is 2HKOed. Doublade is problematic, as it only gets 4HKOed and can thus spinblock reliably, but it is oftentimes needed to take on one of Alolan Sandslash's teammates later in the game. Potential Defog users should be removed or forced out with Icicle Crash before setting up Aurora Veil. However, if they are paired with an Infernape, attempting to set up Aurora Veil may be worth trying, as Infernape can easily take an Icicle Crash, and potentially even an Earthquake, and then force Alolan Sandslash to switch, as Infernape will either outspeed with Choice Scarf or carry strong Fighting-type priority that OHKOes Alolan Sandslash outside of Aurora Veil. Once Aurora Veil has been set up and entry hazards have been removed, Alolan Sandslash should attack its foes and try to deal damage while fainting quickly so its teammates get as much use of Aurora Veil as they can. If it cannot threaten the opposing Pokemon offensively, it should switch out to a teammate that can.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Aurorus needs to be run with Alolan Sandslash, as it provides the hail necessary to set up Aurora Veil. It will also serve as the team's Stealth Rock user. Life Orb Swords Dance Scizor is an especially good partner for Alolan Sandslash due to its ability to wallbreak and sweep, and it is almost mandatory on Aurora Veil-based teams. It can also revenge kill some common threats to hyper offense, such as Mega Aerodactyl. Threatening setup sweepers such as Terrakion, Linoone, Salazzle, and Barbaracle pair well with Alolan Sandslash, as Aurora Veil grants them setup opportunities and they can become overwhelming quickly. Bulkier setup sweepers such as Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune and Swords Dance Doublade can also work, as they provide some defensive utility outside of Aurora Veil and can also become difficult to stop once set up.</p>"

It can viably run both offensive and defensive sets, which similarly take advantage of these matchups as well as its coverage options in tandem with Sheer Force. Alongside its solid defensive uses, Nidoqueen's main selling point lies in these traits, letting it threaten entry hazard removers like Tentacruel, Empoleon, and Gligar. However, Nidoqueen possesses mediocre stats across the board, leaving it easily revenge killed and shakier versus threats like Terrakion and Cobalion than it would prefer. Nidoking offers stiff competition offensively, trading Nidoqueen's additional bulk for more Speed and the ability to deal with Pokemon like Togekiss. Other bulky Ground-types, mainly Gligar and Hippowdon, also make bulky sets hard to justify, possessing superior bulk and access to reliable recovery at the cost of Nidoqueen's offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower hits Scizor and Bronzong for super effective damage, though it is generally less useful than other options.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes pressures the opposing team by poisoning those vulnerable, wearing them down over time. Stealth Rock is a solid alternative option to Toxic Spikes, but it is only truly necessary when another user does not fit on the rest of the team. Sludge Wave sufficiently threatens foes such as Mega Altaria, Primarina, and Celebi while often offering a safe middle ground between the outstanding synergy shared by Earth Power and Ice Beam. Earth Power punishes Pokemon like Empoleon, Tentacruel, Gengar, and Alolan Muk, which can remove Toxic Spikes either through Defog or their typing. Ice Beam nails foes such as Gligar, Hydreigon, Hippowdon, and Amoonguss, applying even more offensive pressure alongside its STAB moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment alongside a Modest nature and Life Orb make Nidoqueen as threatening as possible with its great coverage. 128 Speed EVs guarantee that Nidoqueen outruns Modest Primarina, maximizing its opportunities to dish out damage. The remaining EVs are dumped into HP to assist Nidoqueen in dealing with foes like Nihilego, Mega Manectric, and Terrakion by virtue of its defensive typing.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Especially early on in matches, position Nidoqueen against foes like Mega Altaria, Mega Manectric, and Cobalion, where it can either set an entry hazard or throw out a powerful attack. Nidoqueen has the coverage necessary to threaten most teams offensively; therefore, play aggressively to make the most of this trait. The combination of Earth Power and Ice Beam can hit most Pokemon super effectively, but Sludge Wave can often make for a safe middle ground if expecting a switch to Pokemon like Hydreigon, Moltres, or Rotom-H. Offensive Nidoqueen has a tendency to be worn down easily, so prioritize keeping it healthy if it is needed to beat Pokemon like Mega Manectric or Terrakion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Nidoqueen finds its home on bulky offense teams that take advantage of its offensive presence, entry hazards, and favorable matchups presented by its typing. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is a fantastic partner, getting Nidoqueen into favorable positions against its most common answers in Fairy-types while covering its weaknesses to Psychic-, Water-, and Ground-type moves. Rotom-H deals with Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Mamoswine as well as Togekiss, the one Fairy-type Nidoqueen truly struggles with. Rotom-H also gets Nidoqueen into good spots with Volt Switch and takes pressure off of it in dealing with Mega Manectric. Other pivots such as Scizor and Mega Manectric can be valuable partners, getting Nidoqueen into favorable positions with U-turn and Volt Switch. Alternative Stealth Rock users like Mega Aggron, Cobalion, and Terrakion let Nidoqueen run Toxic Spikes instead, letting it more effectively support the team by wearing down foes. Tsareena provides Rapid Spin support, a valuable asset alongside Toxic Spikes, and gets Nidoqueen into favorable matchups against Mega Altaria and Amoonguss.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes poisons the opposing team upon entry, wearing them down throughout the match. Alternatively, Stealth Rock is a viable option on Nidoqueen if no other setters fit alongside it. Sludge Wave allows Nidoqueen to threaten Fairy-types such as Primarina and Mega Altaria. Earth Power possesses great synergy with Toxic Spikes, threatening hazard removal options such as Empoleon and grounded Poison-types like Tentacruel, opposing Nidoqueen, and Gengar. Ice Beam has nice coverage alongside Earth Power, hitting foes such as Gligar, Hydreigon, and Mega Aerodactyl for solid damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>76 Speed EVs most notably allow Nidoqueen to outspeed Gligar, letting it effectively threaten with Ice Beam by moving before Gligar's Roost. 72 Special Defense EVs let Nidoqueen stomach a +2 Fire Blast from Infernape while bolstering its one-on-one matchup against foes such as Mega Manectric, Nihilego, and Tentacruel. The remaining investment is dumped into Defense alongside a Bold nature, helping it combat foes like Terrakion, Dragon Dance Mega Altaria, and Choice Scarf Infernape. Black Sludge provides Nidoqueen with passive recovery, aiding it through keeping it healthy throughout a match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Nidoqueen should be used primarily early- to mid-game, mainly to handle threats such as Nihilego, Terrakion, and Mega Manectric. These favorable positions make for ideal opportunities to set up an entry hazard, as the foe is often forced out. Prioritize laying down Toxic Spikes if the opponent has multiple Pokemon vulnerable to them, especially if they lack a grounded Poison-type or an entry hazard remover that fares well against Nidoqueen. Similarly, setting Stealth Rock can be crucial in pressuring foes like Moltres, Rotom-H, and Mega Aerodactyl. Keep Nidoqueen healthy if it is necessary to handle cleaners like Mega Manectric, Choice Scarf Infernape, and Nihilego.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive Nidoqueen fits best on balance or bulky teams that appreciate its unique defensive utility and ability to set entry hazards. Nidoqueen's access to Toxic Spikes makes Pokemon like Taunt Hydreigon, Substitute Kyurem, and Calm Mind + Substitute Suicune stand out as ideal partners, as they greatly appreciate the residual damage on foes as they apply pressure. Dragon-types like Latias and the aforementioned Hydreigon share great defensive synergy with Nidoqueen, covering its weaknesses to Water-, Psychic-, and Ground-type moves while it handles Fairy-types in return. They also take pressure off of Nidoqueen in handling Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Rotom-H. Starmie, Tsareena, and Mega Blastoise offer Rapid Spin support, removing the need to use Defog and potentially risk clearing Nidoqueen's entry hazards. Additionally, these removers appreciate Nidoqueen's ability to remove opposing Toxic Spikes upon entry. Nidoqueen can absorb the Electric-type moves aimed at bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Empoleon, and Primarina; additionally, Alomomola can help keep Nidoqueen healthy with Wish. Other Stealth Rock setters like Bronzong, Mega Aggron, and Cobalion alleviate the need for Nidoqueen to run the move itself, meaning it can more feasibly fit Toxic Spikes on its moveset. Pursuit users such as Scizor and Mega Aerodactyl can remove threats to Nidoqueen such as Latias and Celebi.</p>"

Between its STAB moves and Ice Beam, Nidoking is able to hit the majority of the tier super effectively, meaning it has a very flexible last moveslot for another option such as Substitute or Taunt. By virtue of its typing, Nidoking is able to check Pokemon like Tentacruel and Primarina offensively and switch into Pokemon like Klefki and Zeraora with ease. Furthermore, Nidoking sets itself apart from its counterpart, Nidoqueen, thanks to its better Speed tier and better overall offensive capabilities. However, its average Speed tier makes it slower than Pokemon like Latias, Hydreigon, and Krookodile, meaning it can be easily revenge killed. It's also held back by its weakness to common typings in Ground, Psychic, Water, and Ice, making it easily exploitable by Pokemon like Krookodile, Latias, Starmie, and Kyurem. Nidoking's mediocre bulk also makes it hard for it to find opportunities to switch in.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Other coverage options are also viable depending on what the team needs. Superpower allows Nidoking to 2HKO Pokemon like Blissey and Umbreon, while Thunderbolt can OHKO Pokemon like Mantine. Additionally, if carrying Superpower, a Naive nature is preferred to increase its damage output. A Choice Scarf set is also an option, which allows Nidoking to revenge kill Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Mega Altaria more easily. However, losing out on the Life Orb boost makes it much weaker, and the opponent might also take advantage of a Choice-locked Nidoking. Toxic Spikes allows Nidoking to wear down the opposing team, making it easier for one of its teammates to clean late-game. Furthermore, Nidoking is a very good setter, as it can force a lot of switches, and it's able to beat common Toxic Spikes absorbers, such as Tentacruel and Nihilego. However, it doesn't offer as much utility as Nidoking's other moves due to the number of absorbers and Pokemon that are unaffected by it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Pokemon like Hydreigon, Mega Sharpedo, Earthquake Mega Aerodactyl, and Krookodile can outspeed Nidoking and revenge kill it with ease, as it's somewhat frail. However, they have a hard time switching in.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Latias and Starmie can hit Nidoking super effectively with their STAB moves. Latias is particularly threatening, since if it's given the opportunity to, it might use Nidoking as setup bait. It must be wary of Ice Beam when switching in, however.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Krookodile and Zygarde-10% can outspeed Nidoking and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Specially defensive Gastrodon, in particular, can tank any hit from Nidoking and threaten it with its STAB moves. Faster Ground-types struggle to switch into a direct hit, however.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon such as Snorlax, Bronzong, Blissey, and Umbreon can usually switch into any of Nidoking's attacks with ease. However, most of them must be wary of Taunt and coverage moves. Blissey, Snorlax, and Umbreon are 2HKOed by Superpower after Stealth Rock damage, while Bronzong must be wary of Flamethrower.</p>",

Earth Power is a slightly less powerful STAB move that hits Steel-types such as non-Magnet Rise Klefki and Empoleon as well as Pokemon like Tentacruel. Ice Beam allows Nidoking to hit Pokemon like Latias and Mega Aerodactyl that would otherwise wall it super effectively. Substitute eases prediction, letting Nidoking take advantage of Pokemon like Klefki and providing it with a free turn to get a hit off. Nidoking also has a fairly easy time setting it up thanks to its ability to force out so many threats. Taunt can also be used, which pressures bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Alomomola by preventing them from recovering. Flamethrower is also an option that hits Pokemon like Bronzong and Magnet Rise Klefki and OHKOes bulky variants of Scizor. Additionally, if the team is lacking a Stealth Rock user, it can be incorporated into the set, allowing Nidoking to support its team by weakening foes. However, Nidoking is forced to forgo one of its other more useful moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EVs and nature maximize Nidoking's offensive capabilities, ensuring that it hits as hard as possible and is the fastest it can be. Additionally, a Timid nature allows Nidoking to outspeed Pokemon like Togekiss and Magneton. Sheer Force is the only ability Nidoking should run, boosting every move with a secondary effect and negating said effect. Life Orb is used to further increase Nidoking's offensive capabilities, and thanks to Sheer Force, the recoil damage is also negated.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In order to utilize Nidoking at its full potential, it's advised to make predictions and utilize the correct coverage moves accordingly, as certain Pokemon can switch into some of its attacks and take advantage of it. Making a bad prediction might cause a loss of momentum, so be very cautious while using Nidoking. Ice Beam should be used on a predicted switch to Latias or Mega Aerodactyl, while Flamethrower should be used against Pokemon like Bronzong. Furthermore, Nidoking is very frail, and it has a hard time switching in. Thus, making double switches or using pivots and U-turn and Volt Switch users to bring it in safely is advised. Take advantage of Nidoking's ability to force out many Pokemon by setting up a Substitute or Stealth Rock whenever there's a chance to. Use Taunt against bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Mantine to pressure them by disabling their recovery options.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nidoking mostly fits on offensive teams that can take advantage of its offensive capabilities. Since it's very frail and has a hard time switching in, pivots and U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Mega Manectric and Scizor pair well with Nidoking. Cleaners such as Scizor and Mega Sharpedo are good teammates, as they appreciate Nidoking's ability to weaken the opposing team. Furthermore, special attackers such as Primarina and Hydreigon also take advantage of Nidoking's ability to pressure special walls with Taunt. Entry hazards setters such as Cobalion and Klefki are good partners too, as Nidoking can force a lot of switches. Hazards may also ensure an OHKO or a 2HKO on certain Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Suicune. Psychic-types such as Latias and Starmie are able to threaten Nidoking with their STAB moves, so Pokemon that can check them such as Empoleon, Doublade, and Mega Aggron pair well with it. Pokemon that can sponge Ground-type attacks, such as Togekiss and Hydreigon, make for good partners, as Nidoking is easily forced out. Physical wallbreakers like Mamoswine and Heracross also make good teammates, as they can break through the special walls that Nidoking struggles with.</p>"

Venomoth also possesses key resistances to the tier's common Fairy- and Fighting-type attacks, which grants it plentiful opportunities to force switches and set up. Unfortunately, despite its useful resistances, Venomoth's typing also leaves it with a Stealth Rock weakness and with vulnerabilities to common attack types in Fire, Flying, and Psychic. Venomoth is also cursed with horrid bulk, which can complicate setup and leave it vulnerable to Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Krookodile.

However, one of Venomoth's biggest perks is its ability to hit extremely hard with Savage Spin-Out, which means that taking its Buginium Z away severely hurts its viability.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Venomoth's low bulk leaves it susceptible to most relevant forms of priority. Ice Shard from Mamoswine, Sucker Punch from Bisharp, and Bullet Punch from Scizor all cut into Venomoth's HP and easily revenge kill it if it's been weakened.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that 4x Resist Bug</strong>: Various Pokemon possess 4x resistances to Venomoth's Bug-type attacks and resist or are immune to its Poison-type coverage, which allows them to check it fairly adequately. Examples include Klefki, Cobalion, Lucario, Doublade, and Crobat.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey's high special bulk allows it to reliably tank even a boosted Savage Spin-Out while in return threatening Venomoth with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Physically Offensive Choice Scarf Users</strong>: While Quiver Dance can help circumvent its special frailty, Venomoth is still heavily threatened by physical Choice Scarf users, such as Infernape, Krookodile, and Terrakion, as all can outspeed it at +1 and threaten to OHKO with their STAB attacks.</p>",

      "Quiver Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Quiver Dance is essential for allowing Venomoth to boost its Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats, thus turning it into a fearsome sweeper. Sleep Powder can be used to immobilize foes, which is useful for giving Venomoth an opportunity to set up. Bug Buzz is a powerful STAB attack that, after a boost, deals significant amounts of damage to most of the metagame, and with a Buginium Z, it turns into a powerful Savage Spin-Out that is capable of OHKOing Scizor, Terrakion, and Nidoking at +1, which can all otherwise tank a boosted Bug Buzz. Sludge Bomb is useful for covering Fairy-types like Primarina and Togekiss, OHKOing both after a boost and Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack is important for giving Venomoth as much power as possible, notably allowing it to almost always OHKO bulky Scizor variants with a +1 Savage Spinout, as well as OHKOing Primarina with Sludge Bomb at +1. Maximum investment in Speed with a Timid nature is also important, as it allows Venomoth to outspeed the likes of Nidoking, Togekiss, and Mamoswine without boosts as well as the entire unboosted metagame after one Quiver Dance. Tinted Lens allows Venomoth to nullify 2x resistances and dent Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Scizor, and Empoleon with its STAB Bug Buzz. Buginium Z is the preferred item, as it provides Venomoth with a powerful Savage Spin-Out that, with a boost, can break past notably bulky threats like Tentacruel, Hippowdon, and Gligar.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Venomoth's best function is as a sweeper on offensive teams due to its ability to break past multiple archetypes. In order for it to begin sweeping, it is best that Pokemon that 4x resist its STAB attacks, such as Klefki and Cobalion, and specially bulky Pokemon like Blissey are removed or considerably weakened. If the opponent has a Choice Scarf user that can outpace Venomoth at +1 like Infernape or Krookodile, it is crucial for Venomoth to try to get two Quiver Dance boosts by using Sleep Powder. However, trying to wallbreak as much as possible before being revenge killed is a lesser yet plausible option. Due to its frailty, Venomoth is best brought into play via slow pivot support or after a teammate has fainted. It should be brought in against a Pokemon that it forces out like Mega Altaria or a Choice-locked Fighting-type and set up with Quiver Dance as they switch out. From there, Venomoth should use Sleep Powder to immobilize whatever foe was brought in against it and take another turn to set up afterward. However, between the possibility of the foe waking up immediately after being immobilized and Sleep Powder's shaky accuracy, it should be noted that Quiver Dance can only be set up twice about 50% of the time.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Suicide leads like Froslass, Nihilego, and Terrakion can set up entry hazards to help Venomoth break past foes more easily, and they fit quite well onto the heavily offensive teams Venomoth is often seen on. Dual screens setters such as Azelf and Xatu make great partners for Venomoth, as the safety of Reflect and Light Screen can provide it more opportunities to use Quiver Dance. Xatu can also alleviate Venomoth's weakness to entry hazards by reflecting them back by virtue of Magic Bounce. On bulkier offensive teams, entry hazard setters like Klefki can be used due to the good bulk they retain. Entry hazard removal is nearly as important as entry hazard setters, due to Venomoth's Stealth Rock weakness. This makes Pokemon such as Mega Blastoise, Starmie, and Gligar good options for teammates. Infernape and Krookodile trouble Venomoth as Choice Scarf users, which makes answers to these Pokemon, such as Hippowdon and Mega Altaria, good partners that can ultimately pave the way for Venomoth to clean up. Spinblockers such as Mimikyu and Doublade can all aid Venomoth by making sure that entry hazards aren't removed from the opponent's side of the field, which is useful for securing KOs on Pokemon like Volcanion and Scizor. Steel-type checks like Rotom-H, Lucario, and Volcanion can ease Venomoth's matchup against the likes of Scizor and Klefki, allowing it to use its Z-Move on a target of a different type. Magneton is particularly helpful due to its ability to trap and remove the likes of Scizor and Empoleon from play.</p>"

  "Tentacruel": {
    "overview": "<p>Tentacruel's good Water / Poison defensive typing, which allows it to check threats such as Infernape and Scizor while absorbing Toxic Spikes, and access to Rapid Spin are what really set it apart from other Water-types in the tier. Additionally, good utility options in Toxic Spikes, Haze, and Knock Off give it the ability to support different playstyles and archetypes, and a good Speed tier also lets Tentacruel outspeed and heavily chip down threats to balance such as Mamoswine and Nidoking before going down without much investment. However, its subpar physical bulk and a lack of recovery outside of Z-Haze leave it hard pressed to check threats such as Scizor and Cobalion over the course of a game and reliant on teammates to serve as primary checks. Tentacruel’s weakness to a common offensive typing in Ground, which most Stealth Rock setters have, makes it more risky to remove entry hazards, even if they are forced out by Tentacruel’s Scald. Tentacruel also faces competition from Starmie as a spinner due to the fact Starmie has a much higher offensive presence and can switch into common Stealth Rock users such as Hippowdon and Swampert reliably. Tentacruel’s low damage output leaves it open to becoming setup fodder for bulky users, such as Reuniclus and Latias, even though Haze will deny their boosts if need be.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A slower, bulkier spread of 252 HP / 236 Def / 20 Spe with a Bold nature is a good option to take hits like Choice Band Terrakion's Close Combat better, but this spread only works if Tentacruel doesn't need the Speed for Nidoking and Mamoswine. Toxic can reliably deter threats such as Latias and Mega Manectric from switching in, but it isn’t as useful as the options listed. An offensive set is possible, but other Water-types such as Starmie and Mega Blastoise outclass it due to their better coverage and overall damage output. Acid Spray can be used to punish setup sweepers and slower Pokemon such as Alomomola for coming in on Tentacruel, but it is generally not as good or consistent as the options listed on the set. Hidden Power Fire is a viable option to beat Roost Scizor in a one-on-one situation but is generally useless otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-type threats such as Starmie, Reuniclus, and Celebi can come in on Tentacruel relatively freely due to its low damage output, force it out, and can even set  up in the case of the latter two. Celebi, Latias, and offensive Starmie, however, dislike having their sets revealed via Knock Off or being chipped down and even poisoned from Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Rotom-C and Mega Manectric can freely pivot into Scald and use Tentacruel for free momentum with Volt Switch as Tentacruel it switches out, although the former fears Sludge Bomb. Raikou in particular  can use Tentacruel as setup fodder as it switches out.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Threats such as Krookodile and Swampert can force out Tentacruel with powerful Ground-type attacks. They cannot switch into Scald, however.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-type threats such as Latias and Hydreigon can freely come into Tentacruel and force it out with the threat of heavy damage. However, they all fear having their items removed, and physical Dragon-type threats such as Haxorus and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria without Refresh fear a potential burn from Scald.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Stronger Pokemon such as Infernape and Choice Band Terrakion can easily 2HKO Tentacruel after Stealth Rock, which can prove troublesome. Additionally, super effective coverage such as Mega Aerodactyl's Earthquake or Nihilego's Thunder or Thunderbolt can pick off Tentacruel after mild chip damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sludge Bomb is a moderately strong secondary STAB move that hits targets such as Rotom-C, Mega Altaria, and most notably Primarina for super effective damage. Alternatively, Toxic Spikes can wear down opposing teams with poison, and Knock Off removes the item from common Tentacruel switch-ins, such as Blissey and Empoleon, which can be useful for wearing them down over time.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>144 EVs invested in Speed and a Timid nature allows Tentacruel to outspeed Rotom-H and Rotom-C, as well as threats such as Mamoswine and Nidoking. The remaining EVs are placed in HP and Defense to maximize Tentacruel’s physical bulk. Black Sludge is a means of passive recovery, increasing Tentacruel's longevity. Alternatively, Icium Z with Haze provides a one-time full restoration of Tentacruel’s health that also helps it reduce Knock Off damage from threats such as Scizor, but should only be used if there are no other Z-Move users on the team. Clear Body aids Tentacruel in removing Sticky Web, due to a lack of a Speed drop. A slightly bulkier spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe with a Timid nature may be used to only Speed creep Mamoswine and Chandelure if your team deals with faster threats adequately.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its lack of recovery, Tentacruel’s HP should be preserved until necessary, so it should only be coming in on forced switches and Pokemon that cannot do meaningful damage to it, such as Scizor locked into Bullet Punch and defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola. Tentacruel additionally shouldn’t be attempting to use Rapid Spin on most Stealth Rock setters, as they can heavily damage or outright KO Tentacruel, outside of rare exceptions such as Empoleon and Cobalion. Tentacruel can be used to revenge kill weakened foes such as Mamoswine and Rotom-C if need be, but generally it shouldn’t be taking them on because Tentacruel is unable to OHKO most threats. Knock Off is a very useful tool to scout for items, such as seeing whether or not a Latias has a Z-Crystal on the switch-in. It also can be used to cripple threats such as Empoleon and Choice Specs Kyurem that rely on their items and often switch directly into Tentacruel. Knock Off is also extremely useful for chipping down bulkier threats such as Blissey by removing their Leftovers. Toxic Spikes are important when trying to break through bulkier archetypes, so try to set them as early as possible when facing them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates that appreciate Tentacruel’s entry hazard removal, such as Kyurem, Mega Aerodactyl, and Togekiss, make good partners. Ground-type answers such as Moltres and Hydreigon can punish common Tentacruel checks like Krookodile and Swampert. Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Bronzong can deal with troublesome Dragon- and Psychic-type Pokemon like Latias and Kyurem that commonly switch into Tentacruel. Additionally, Pursuit support from teammates such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile can trap problematic Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Starmie and Gengar and remove them. Pokemon that enjoy Toxic Spikes chipping down opposing teams, such as Kyurem and Raikou, make good partners. Moltres is a good option because it takes on Scizor and most Fighting-type threats reliably, provided Tentacruel removes Stealth Rock for it in return. Fairy-types, such as Mega Altaria and Togekiss, make excellent partners due to their ability to take on Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Fighting-types Tentacruel shouldn’t be taking on due to its lack of recovery, such as Terrakion and Heracross. Additionally, Florges and Sylveon can provide Wish support, furthering Tentacruel’s longevity. Tentacruel is unable to check threats such as Scizor, Primarina, and Cobalion over time, so hard checks to those threats, such as Mega Slowbro and Doublade for Cobalion and Mega Aggron for Scizor, can greatly make up for Tentacruel’s shortcomings defensively. Lastly, Electric-immune Pokemon in the form of Ground-types such as Gligar and Hippowdon fit well with Tentacruel, taking on threats like Mega Manectric that would otherwise be troublesome, as well as forming entry hazard stacking cores with Tentacruel due to their ability to reliably set up Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>Slowbro's access to Regenerator enables it to act as one of the most reliable defensive pivots in the tier. Its high Defense allows it to take on the majority of physical attackers, and this complemented with its good Water / Psychic typing enables it to check several top-tier threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and Cobalion. Slowbro also has access to reliable recovery in Slack Off, which helps it beat stronger physical attackers one-on-one without being forced out. With a variety of other utility options such as Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Block, Slowbro cements its viability on a variety of different teams from bulky offense to stall. Slowbro also has access to Slowbronite, granting it even more Defense as well as increased Special Attack, which it can take advantage of through Calm Mind sets that can act as sweepers on the more defensive teams if finds itself on. Despite Slowbro's typing allowing it to beat the majority of physical threats, it also gives Slowbro weaknesses to key metagame staples such as Hydreigon and Celebi, and it can also be overwhelmed by common physical threats in Crawdaunt and Mega Sharpedo despite its stellar Defense. Additionally, Slowbro's typing burdens it with weaknesses to both U-turn and Volt Switch, meaning it struggles against offensive pivots such as Mega Manectric and Choice Band Scizor. Its average Special Defense stat also makes matchups against many other special attackers, such as Latias and Togekiss, difficult for Slowbro as well. Without Rest, many Slowbro sets are extremely vulnerable to status, mainly Toxic, which cripples it severely and makes it unable to pivot into strong attacks as often.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowbro has a variety of coverage options. Future Sight lets Slowbro support teammates like Terrakion by threatening their usual checks with heavy damage, and Signal Beam hits Celebi harder than any other option while still covering Hydreigon and Latias. However, they both require giving up a STAB move, Calm Mind, or a utility option like Thunder Wave or Toxic. A defensive Calm Mind set with Iron Defense and Rest in place of Ice Beam and Slack Off is an option run with Slowbronite, allowing Slowbro to boost both its Defense and Special Defense while giving it the ability to use Rest, healing status so it can beat Toxic users.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: While they should be wary of Ice Beam, Grass-types like Rotom-C and Mega Sceptile can use their super effective STAB attacks to power through Slowbro. Tsareena can also threaten both formes with its strong STAB Power Whip, though it should be wary of Scald burns. Celebi is particularly troublesome, as it can utilize its typing and decent bulk to set up on both Slowbro and Mega Slowbro with Nasty Plot while evading long term status ailments with Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: The likes of Mega Manectric, Rotom-C, and Zeraora can use powerful Electric-type STAB moves to easily power through either Slowbro or its Mega Evolution, though the latter two should be wary of Ice Beam and Scald, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Most Ghost-types can take advantage of Slowbro and Mega Slowbro's average special bulk and Psychic typing to power through them with powerful super effective STAB attacks. While Gengar and Chandelure have to look out for Psyshock and Scald, respectively, both often require minimal chip to KO Slowbro and Mega Slowbro with Shadow Ball from full. Jellicent is particularly annoying for all Slowbro variants, as it can switch in on Scald and restore health thanks to Water Absorb while heavily threatening Slowbro with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and super effective Hex.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Due to their average Special Defense stat, both Slowbro and Mega Slowbro can succumb to powerful attacks from several prominent specially offensive forces, such as Primarina, Kyurem, and Moltres. Dark-type wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Mega Houndoom are especially threatening in that they can switch into a predicted Psyshock and nail either Slowbro with a super effective STAB Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic poison can compromise Slowbro's ability to consistently pivot in and out of play by constantly chipping it down throughout a match, and the status can particularly complicate Mega Slowbro's ability to sweep or tank hits from foes nearly as reliably. Block variants of Slowbro and Mega Slowbro can use Rest to cure their status, though.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mega Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Slowbro's main STAB move, capable of spreading burns and dealing adequate amounts of damage, bolstering its offensive presence. Calm Mind buffs Slowbro's naturally average Special Defense to acceptable levels as well as buffing its Special Attack, increasing its offensive pressure. Slack Off offers reliable recovery and should be used on every Slowbro set. The last slot is a choice of coverage: Ice Beam allows Mega Slowbro to nail common offensive switch-ins such as Hydreigon and Latias for super effective damage, preventing it from being walled by many of the tier's most prominent Pokemon and making sure it isn't setup bait for many Water-resistant Pokemon. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that can deal more damage to common Water-resistant switch-ins such as Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Tentacruel, hitting all three for super effective damage. Psyshock also allows Mega Slowbro to beat other Calm Mind users like Suicune and Reuniclus, while allowing it to break specially defensive walls in Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Slowbro's overall bulk while 76 Defense EVs and a Bold nature ensure that Slowbro has the physical defense to wall essentially the entire tier after a few Calm Mind boosts. The remaining EVs are added into Special Defense to help out with its overall bulk pre-Calm Mind boosts and also increase its walling capabilities after it has started boosting. Slowbronite ensures Slowbro can Mega Evolve, giving it a large amount of extra bulk, while Regenerator is used pre-Mega as an excellent defensive ability that helps Slowbro remain healthy over the course of a match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Calm Mind Mega Slowbro should stay pre-Mega until its major checks and counters have been removed, as its pre-Mega ability Regenerator is much better for consistently switching into Pokemon it is able to wall. It should play mostly as a physically defensive tank until its checks have been removed, which are Pokemon like Hydreigon that are capable of breaking through even after using Calm Mind once or twice as well as Haze users such as Tentacruel and Mantine. If running Ice Beam it is best to use this move early game to catch its common checks like Latias, Hydreigon, and Celebi on the switch to wear them down to sweep later. It can serve as an excellent win condition once your opponent no longer has answers for its sheer bulk after a boost or two. Additionally, Slowbro should not Mega Evolve and set up until the major Toxic users such as Blissey and Empoleon have been removed, as Toxic prevents its ability to sweep by providing consistent residual damage and putting it on a timer. Once it can set up, Mega Slowbro should boost so that it can tank both physical and special attacks, as it can often win just because nothing can break through it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since many teams utilize Grass-type Pokemon such as Celebi and Tsareena as their Water-type checks, Grass-type checks such as Scizor, Gengar, and Infernape make good partners. Pursuit users such as Krookodile and the aforementioned Scizor make great partners as they can help trap and remove the likes of Celebi and Latias, two of the best checks to Slowbro. Electric-type checks such as Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, and Rhyperior make Slowbro less vulnerable to foes like Mega Manectric. Nidoqueen is also able to set up Toxic Spikes, which helps wear down some defensive checks like Blissey and Pyukumuku for it. Cobalion and Moltres are good partners for Mega Slowbro as they can check most of the Bug-type attacks aimed at it, primarily U-turn from Scizor and punish it with Rocky Helmet chip and a burn from Flame Body, respectively. Heal Bell users make Slowbro less vulnerable to status, so Pokemon such as Togekiss, Florges, and Diancie make good partners. Special walls such as Blissey are good partners, capable of taking on the powerful special attackers such as Latias and Starmie that can threaten Slowbro. Offensive pivots that can benefit from Slowbro's prowess as a defensive pivot, such as Scizor and Hydreigon, are good partners that can help patch up Mega Slowbro's somewhat lackluster offensive presence before it sets up. If Mega Slowbro opts for Ice Beam, then Pokemon capable of dealing with bulky Water-types like Tentacruel and Empoleon are appreciated. For this reason Mamoswine, Terrakion, and Hydreigon make great partners for it.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind serves as Slowbro's boosting move and allows it to increase both its Special Attack and Special Defense. Scald is a consistent, reliable, and spammable STAB move with good coverage and a 30% chance to burn the target. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that allows Slowbro to break through special walls such as Blissey with enough boosts, helps Slowbro defeat other Calm Mind users, and threatens Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Tentacruel. Finally, Slack Off provides Slowbro with reliable recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize overall bulk. 252 Defense EVs and a Bold nature increase Slowbro's ability to take physical attacks. Leftovers provides Slowbro with passive recovery, while Waterium Z and Psychium Z allow Slowbro to switch into Knock Off more freely and hit its checks with a powerful STAB move. Regenerator allows Slowbro to recover health upon switching out, enabling it to serve as a more effective pivot.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slowbro is a self-sustaining late-game sweeper that also provides early- and mid-game defensive utility. Slowbro can pivot into strong physical attackers, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Cobalion, and Infernape, and use its STAB moves instead of using Slack Off to heal itself because Regenerator enables it to recover HP simply by switching out. Slowbro should set up later in the match, after its checks and counters have been removed or sufficiently weakened. Slowbro has to be cautious of status, primarily Toxic, as this greatly hinders its ability to check these threats as well as pull off a sweep with Calm Mind in the late-game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowbro is very vulnerable to status and thus benefits from cleric support from Pokemon such as Sylveon, Togekiss, and Blissey. Pokemon like Mega Altaria, Moltres, and Empoleon can use Defog to remove entry hazards from the field, especially the Toxic Spikes that Slowbro fears. Poison-types like Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Nihilego can similarly remove Toxic Spikes by absorbing them while the latter two can also set up Toxic Spikes of their own to wear down Slowbro's checks and help it break through bulkier teams. Specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Alolan Muk can take on common Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon like Celebi, Rotom-C, and Mega Manectric that threaten Slowbro. Amoonguss covers Slowbro's Electric- and Grass-type weaknesses and forms the second half of a core that can take advantage of Regenerator to pivot effectively. Hippowdon and Mega Steelix can check Electric-types, and set Stealth Rock, to wear down opposing Slowbro checks. Mega Steelix is also a phenomenal check to Calm Mind Latias sets that easily beat Slowbro. In return, Slowbro resists Water- and Ice-type attacks and can set up on bulky Water-types like Suicune that try to take advantage of Hippowdon. Fairy-types like Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Togekiss benefit from Slowbro's resistances to Fire- and Steel-type attacks and can switch in on Bug- and Dark-type attacks aimed at Slowbro. Steel-types resist Grass- and Bug-type attacks that give Slowbro trouble. In exchange, Slowbro can take on Fire- and Fighting-types like Cobalion and Infernape. Scizor, Doublade, and Klefki can make good partners for this reason, with Scizor also being able to bring Slowbro in safely with U-turn. Pursuit trappers like Mega Aerodactyl, Krookodile, and the aforementioned Scizor makes ideal partners for Slowbro, as they are capable of removing the likes of Latias and Celebi for it. Fighting-types such as Cobalion, Infernape, and Terrakion provide answers to offensive Dark-types that threaten Slowbro.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that threatens Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Volcanion that wouldn't mind being hit by Scald. Ice Beam is a solid option over Psyshock, as it can hit Dragon- and Grass-types such as Hydreigon and Celebi that resist Scald. Toxic is easy to spread, as Slowbro can be difficult to wear down, and can provide valuable chip toward enemy tanks such as Alomomola and opposing Slowbro. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to support its team by crippling opposing offensive Pokemon that rely on their Speed like Latias and Hydreigon​.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides Slowbro with passive recovery and helps it better check Pokemon like Terrakion and Cobalion more consistently throughout the match. Colbur Berry gives Slowbro a chance to escape Pursuit from the likes of Krookodile and stomach other Dark-type moves such as Hydreigon's Dark Pulse and punish its enemy with Scald or a status move.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slowbro can pivot into strong physical attackers, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Cobalion, Infernape, Mamoswine, and Terrakion, and fire off STAB attacks and status moves over the course of a match. Thanks to Regenerator, Slowbro doesn't need to rely on purely Slack Off for recovery. Pivoting Slowbro into Pokemon that it forces out, such as Terrakion and Gligar, is an easy way to get back health while double switching out or getting off a Slack Off. Slowbro should take advantage of its bulk and innate recovery from Regenerator to spread status with Toxic, Thunder Wave, or Scald burns. If utilizing Colbur Berry then Slowbro can risk staying in on threats such as Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo to get off a crucial Toxic or Thunder Wave. Try to not let Slowbro take Toxic poison or a Scald burn carelessly; chip damage from status can seriously hinder its ability to remain effective throughout the match. Mew can be a prominent issue for this reason as it is able to synchronize back any status ailments Slowbro may inflict on to it. Slowbro shouldn't be used recklessly and should stay out of harm's way, as special attackers like Primarina, Celebi, and Mega Houndoom and super effective physical attacks from threats such as Crawdaunt, Mega Sharpedo, and Scizor pose a major threat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>While Water / Psychic is a solid defensive typing, it leaves Slowbro vulnerable to VoltTurn cores, as it's weak to both Volt Switch and U-turn. Mega Manectric, Rotom-H, Rotom-C, Scizor, and Zeraora are all threatening in this manner. Mega Steelix is a solid teammate, as it is immune to Electric-type moves, resists U-turn, and may beat the aforementioned threats bar Rotom-H. Hippowdon also provides an Electric-type immunity and can run Rocky Helmet to punish U-turn. Special walls such as Florges and Blissey can patch up Slowbro's weakness to special attackers like Mega Manectric and Hydreigon. Cobalion and Mega Aggron freely switch into Dark-type moves like Knock Off for Slowbro and can set up entry hazards to capitalize on the switches Slowbro forces. Scizor's U-turn helps Slowbro to get into more favorable positions; for example, Infernape and Cobalion often switch into Scizor. Scizor also checks Pokemon like Latias, Mimikyu, and Mega Altaria for Slowbro. Pursuit users like Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile are able to defeat Ghost-types such as Gengar and Chandelure that can blow through Slowbro as well as trap fast Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Zeraora for Slowbro. In return, Slowbro can wear down their checks in bulky Ground- and Water-types with Toxic. Toxic can seriously cut into Slowbro’s longevity, so clerics such as Diancie, Sylveon, and Togekiss are appreciated. Slowbro synergizes well with other Regenerator users, which include Amoonguss and Assault Vest Mienshao. Both can take special hits for Slowbro while being able to rotate taking weaker hits, and Amoonguss is able to absorb Toxic Spikes for Slowbro. Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Mega Sharpedo, and Crawdaunt threaten Slowbro with relative ease, making Fairy-types good partners for it. Primarina and Mega Altaria excel in dealing with these Dark-types and can switch into them with ease. With Slowbro serving as a blanket check to the Fighting-types in the tier, Pokemon such as Cobalion, Hydreigon, and Rotom-H can all capitalize on Slowbro suppressing those. When Slowbro is running Thunder Wave, slower breakers like Lucario, Nidoking, and Mamoswine have an easier time dealing with faster Pokemon that it lures in, such as Latias and Hydreigon.​</p>"
      },
      "Block": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Block allows Slowbro to trap passive Pokemon like Blissey, Alomomola, and Bronzong and potentially take advantage of them. Toxic lets Slowbro wear down Pokemon it attempts to trap, including Swampert, Quagsire, and Alomomola, along with common switch-ins, such as Latias and Hydreigon. Alternatively, Calm Mind allows Slowbro to take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Klefki and Mega Aggron by boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense and potentially sweeping. It should be mainly used with Slowbronite, however, because Mega Slowbro is significantly bulkier and stronger than Slowbro, so Mega Slowbro finds it easier to sweep. Scald is a reliable and spammable STAB move that allows Slowbro to potentially burn its target and cripple physical attackers like Mamoswine and Crawdaunt. Scald also allowing it to punish Steel-types such as Cobalion and Mega Aggron that are immune to Toxic. Despite having access to Slack Off, Rest is Slowbro's preferred recovery move because it allows Slowbro to beat passive Pokemon such as Swampert and Empoleon that may rely on status ailments like Toxic to beat it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs in tandem with 252 Defense EVs and a Bold nature make Slowbro as physically bulky as possible, which allows it to take on physical attackers such as Terrakion and Krookodile better. Colbur Berry is used to surprise Dark-types that normally check Slowbro such as Mega Houndoom and Hydreigon and helps reduce its susceptibility to Pursuit.. Alternatively, Leftovers can be used for a passive form of recovery to help handle offensive threats like Mamoswine and Infernape better as it is otherwise reliant on Rest and Regenerator. Slowbronite allows Slowbro to Mega Evolve, which boosts Slowbro's Defense and Special Attack and makes it an even more dangerous sweeper. Hence, it should mainly be used with Calm Mind. Furthermore, Mega Slowbro's ability Shell Armor makes Mega Slowbro even harder to break while boosted. Slowbronite also weakens opposing Knock Off damage on Slowbro. Waterium Z can be used to give Slowbro a strong Water-type STAB attack that lets it OHKO or severely weaken certain threats such as Terrakion and Scizor while also lowering the damage dealt to Slowbro by Knock Off, but should be opted for as a last resort. Regenerator is Slowbro's preferred ability because it allows Slowbro to pivot into physical attackers such as Terrakion and Mamoswine better mid-game.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Slowbro should be pivoted into physical attackers it can take on such as Mamoswine and Infernape. Do not reveal Block early-game because this set partly relies on the surprise factor on unsuspecting passive Pokemon. Use Block on passive Pokemon like Klefki, Mega Aggron, Alomomola, and Empoleon and take advantage of them with Toxic or Calm Mind. However, scouting for Roar is mandatory; otherwise, Block's effect will be removed and the foe could attempt to play around Block to prevent Slowbro from eliminating any Pokemon. Additionally, use Block with caution because of its low PP. Use Scald to wear down switch-ins as well as trapped Pokemon. Attempt to inflict Steel-types with a burn because they are immune to Toxic. Use Scald with caution, as if Slowbro inflicts a burn on a Pokemon it wants to cripple with Toxic, it will be harder to wear that Pokemon down, and Slowbro will waste PP trying to KO them. If using a Colbur Berry, Slowbro should attempt to badly poison a Dark-type foe that normally checks it, such as Mega Houndoom or Hydreigon and allows it to stay in on Krookodile and weaken it with Scald. If using Slowbronite, do not Mega Evolve immediately because then Slowbro loses Regenerator, which makes it harder for it to repeatedly pivot into physical attackers like Terrakion and Infernape. Toxic should be used early-game to wear down Slowbro's main checks, including Mega Manectric, Hydreigon, and Latias. It should also be used on trapped Pokemon such as Mantine and Blissey to eliminate them as quickly as possible. Calm Mind should mainly be used against trapped foes like Klefki, Sylveon, and Bronzong to attempt a sweep. Make sure to not set up with Calm Mind variants if there are Pokemon like Mantine and Volcanion that are immune to Water-type coverage, although the latter also has no way of breaking through Slowbro. If running Waterium Z then use Hydro Vortex to KO certain threats, including setup sweepers that may try to avoid the KO from Scald and set up, such as Infernape and Scizor. Rest should be used to maintain Slowbro's longevity. However, it should be mainly used against trapped foes, as Slowbro can otherwise easily be taken advantage of by setup sweepers such as Scizor and Latias. Furthermore, Rest should generally not be used early-game so Slowbro's set isn't revealed. Instead, take advantage of Slowbro's ability Regenerator to retain longevity. Similarly, do not stay in on setup sweepers that do not mind status ailments, such as Reuniclus, Refresh Mega Altaria, and Togekiss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Slowbro mainly fits on defensive teams because of its ability to trap opposing passive Pokemon that are troublesome like entry hazard setters such as Mega Aggron and Empoleon and clerics such as Sylveon and Blissey. Ground-types such as Mega Steelix and Hippowdon pair well with Slowbro because they check Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Zeraora and block opposing Volt Switch. They can also set up Stealth Rock, which synergizes well with Regenerator to help wear the opposing team down. Amoonguss pairs really well with Slowbro because it also has Regenerator. By switching frequently between Amoonguss and Slowbro with Stealth Rock up, you can wear down the opponent's team while preserving your team's PP. Amoonguss can also pivot into Electric- and Grass-types, such as Mega Manectric, Rotom-C, and Tsareena. Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Florges, and Klefki pair well with Slowbro because they can switch into hostile Dragon- and Dark-types, such as Latias and Hydreigon. Sylveon and Florges can also provide Slowbro with Wish support, which allows Slowbro to pivot into physical attackers more easily, and Heal Bell support, which allows Slowbro to be cured of a status ailment without revealing Rest. Hazard removers such as Rotom-H, Hydreigon, and Tsareena can clear entry hazards that are hostile to Slowbro, which allows it to pivot in better and take better advantage of Regenerator. Hydreigon and Rotom-H also being able to check Grass-types that Slowbro struggles with such as Celebi and Amoonguss. Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Krookodile can pivot into Ghost-types that check Slowbro, such as Chandelure and Gengar, respectively. Lastly, setup sweepers such as Scizor and Latias appreciate Slowbro trapping problematic defensive Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Klefki, and Mantine.</p>"

      "Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Slowbro's main STAB move, capable of spreading burns and dealing decent amounts of damage at the same time. Ice Beam is mandatory coverage, allowing Mega Slowbro to nail Grass-types like Rotom-C and Celebi as well as Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Mega Altaria, and Latias for super-effective damage so it isn't walled by many of the tier's most capable Pokemon. Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that hits many Pokemon that resist Scald for at least neutral damage, such as Primarina, Suicune, and Tentacruel, as well as dealing more damage to potent special walls like Blissey. Fire Blast can also be used in the third slot, allowing Slowbro to OHKO Scizor and deal neutral damage to Pokemon that resist both Scald and Ice Beam like Empoleon. Keep in mind, however, that forgoing Psyshock in this third slot will leave Slowbro incapable of touching Tentacruel and walled by a few Pokemon that resist Water-, Ice-, and Fire-type attacks like Mantine and Jellicent. Finally, Slack Off is mandatory in the last slot, giving Slowbro reliable recovery that allows it to stay healthy over the course of a match and, when coupled with its non-Mega ability, Regenerator, enables it to repeatedly switch into threats it walls such as Infernape and Cobalion. Thunder Wave is another option for the third slot, hitting common offensive switch-ins to Mega Slowbro such as Volcanion and crippling them with paralysis, but it gives up a very nice offensive move in either Psyshock or Fire Blast to do so, so it's not recommended. Toxic is also an option for the third slot, crippling common bulkier switch-ins such as Alomomola and other Mega Slowbro, which take very little damage from any of Slowbro's offensive options.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Slowbro's overall bulk while 76 Defense EVs and a Bold nature capitalize on Slowbro's naturally high Defense. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense. Slowbronite ensures Slowbro can Mega Evolve, which boosts its defenses significantly, while Regenerator is used pre-Mega as an excellent defensive ability so Slowbro remains healthy over the course of a match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Slowbro set should be used to repeatedly switch into threats it is able to check, like Infernape, Cobalion, Mamoswine, and Mega Aerodactyl. For the majority of the game, Slowbro should not Mega Evolve, as Regenerator is such an important ability that enables it to keep switching in and out of the majority of the tier's physical attackers, which is more important than the extra stats given by Slowbro's Mega Evolution. Pre-Mega, Slowbro should consistently utilize Scald to spread burns and its coverage moves to spread damage and cripple its most common switch-ins. If a dangerous Pokemon such as Haxorus or Swords Dance Terrakion requires Slowbro to Mega Evolve to check with boosted Defense, Slowbro should Mega Evolve. Keep in mind that Mega Evolving means Slowbro loses Regenerator, so it should typically only be done late in the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Grass-types such as Celebi can easily knock out Slowbro, so pairing it with Fire-, Dragon-, and Steel-types like Moltres, Latias, and Scizor is generally a good idea. Pairing Slowbro with a strong Ground-type like Hippowdon or Nidoqueen helps Slowbro because it is naturally weak to Volt Switch from users like Mega Manectric and Zeraora. Special walls such as Blissey and Florges are good partners for Slowbro, since its Special Defense is naturally relatively low and many of the tier's strong special attackers can easily break through it. Slowbro can also take the strong physical attacks aimed at Blissey and Florges. Heal Bell users, including Togekiss, Sylveon, and the aforementioned Florges and Blissey are good partners, since Slowbro is weak to status due to its lack of Leftovers recovery and lack of immunity to Toxic or Will-O-Wisp. Fairy-types like the aforementioned Togekiss and Sylveon can help Slowbro deal with Dark-types like Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo that can easily break through it, and Slowbro can beat the strong Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Cobalion that threaten these Fairy-types. Steel-types such as Bisharp, Scizor, and Stakataka are capable of checking Psychic-types like Latias and Celebi that can give Mega Slowbro troubles. Strong offensive pivots such as Hydreigon and Scizor that appreciate Slowbro's ability to pivot into offensive threats that may revenge kill them make good teammates and can patch up Slowbro's somewhat lackluster offensive pressure.</p>"

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Slowbro's main way to deal damage, capable of spreading status and not giving many of the tier's most common offensive Pokemon free switch-ins. Slack Off provides reliable recovery and allows Slowbro to stay reasonably healthy the entire game, especially when paired with its pre-Mega ability, Regenerator. Ice Beam is Slowbro's best coverage move, allowing it to hit Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon that resist Scald such as Celebi, Mega Sceptile, and Latias. Psyshock is Slowbro's secondary STAB move and hits Tentacruel for super effective damage while dealing neutral damage to a lot of Pokemon that resist Scald such as Suicune and Volcanion. Fire Blast allows Slowbro to OHKO Scizor while also providing excellent neutral coverage with Scald and Ice Beam, so it can be used over Psyshock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Slowbro to hit as hard as possible and utilize its Special Attack boost from Mega Evolution. 44 Speed EVs allow Slowbro to outspeed Doublade. 212 HP EVs maximize Slowbro's overall bulk and are left over from its Special Attack and Speed investment. Regenerator is used pre-Mega, allowing Slowbro to stay healthy before it Mega Evolves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Slowbro set should be Mega Evolving early, as the Special Attack boost upon Mega Evolution is the main reason to use this set. Slowbro can be switched into physical and special attackers that it walls, such as Cobalion, Terrakion, and Nasty Plot Infernape, but keep in mind that without maximum HP or any Defense investment, it will be significantly less bulky than a defensive set. Scald should be used as much as possible, as it is capable of spreading status and helping Slowbro wear down the opposing team. Slowbro should use its coverage moves to smack common switch-ins such as Celebi and Mega Altaria, and try to do as much damage in its Mega forme as possible with the Special Attack boost. Keep in mind that without Regenerator, Mega Slowbro is very easily worn down, so try to keep it healthy and keep entry hazards off of the field as much as possible. Avoiding Toxic is paramount to avoiding getting Slowbro worn down, so make sure not to switch it in if there is any threat of a Toxic coming its way.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types such as Scizor and Cobalion make solid partners, as they can check the Dragon- and Fairy-type Pokemon that can threaten out Mega Slowbro, while Mega Slowbro can check the Fire- and Ground-type attackers that often threaten these Pokemon. Rapid Spin and Defog users such as Tentacruel, Tsareena, and Rotom-H make good partners because Mega Evolving early makes Slowbro especially vulnerable to being worn down by Stealth Rock and Spikes. Heal Bell users such as Togekiss and Sylveon are good partners, as Mega Slowbro is very susceptible to being worn down by poison and burn damage. Sylveon can also provide Wish support to support the fact that Mega Slowbro can't take advantage of Regenerator upon Mega Evolving early. Ground-type Pokemon that can switch into Mega Manectric and Zeraora and stop Volt Switch momentum are good partners for Mega Slowbro; therefore, Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Rhyperior, and Krookodile make solid partners. Special walls such as Florges and Empoleon make good partners for Mega Slowbro, as it often succumbs to pressure from high-powered special attackers such as Latias and Hydreigon. Pursuit users such as Scizor, Krookodile, and Assault Vest Bisharp make great partners as they can trap and remove Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gengar and Celebi.</p>"
      },
      "Future Sight Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Future Sight is a great STAB move to support Pokemon like Terrakion, overwhelming their defensive answers and improving the team's matchup against stall. Scald is an easy-to-use STAB move that can spread burn. Slack Off gives Slowbro sustainability, which is especially important after it Mega Evolves and loses Regenerator. Ice Beam gives Slowbro solid coverage to hit Water-resistant foes like Hydreigon, Latias, and Altaria, preventing them from healing, pivoting in, or setting up freely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Slowbro is able to hit as hard as possible while retaining some bulk with the provided spread. The Speed investment allows Slowbro to outpace slow Pokemon like Doublade and Amoonguss. Psychium Z can be used with Future Sight to allow another Pokemon to Mega Evolve and immediately threaten Pokemon like Amoonguss.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Slowbro should wait to Mega Evolve to gain value from Regenerator. It can use Future Sight or chip foes with Scald and immediately switch out without much consequence thanks to Regenerator; it should only Mega Evolve when it needs the extra strength or bulk to check Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl. To help wallbreakers break past their checks more easily, Slowbro should prioritize setting up Future Sight, which is especially effective against stall. Slowbro can effectively utilize its coverage as long as it avoids Toxic, as it is worn down too quickly otherwise. Given Slowbro's usual passivity, it is actually able to lure Pokemon like Celebi and Mega Altaria that can normally sponge uninvested hits with ease. Slowbro must also remain wary of Pursuit trappers like Krookodile and Alolan Muk and try to stay out of range of a Pursuit KO. As Slowbro lacks investment in Defense, it should be careful against physical wallbreakers it would normally handle like Swords Dance Terrakion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Future Sight Slowbro thrives in conjunction with other wallbreakers to pressure their switch-ins. Choice Band Terrakion makes for a great example; upon taking a Future Sight, Gligar is 2HKOed by Stone Edge, and Alomomola can no longer safely scout it. Other Fighting-types such as Infernape and Mienshao are consistent partners as well, as they threaten Pokemon that can sponge Future Sight comfortably, like Blissey or Latias. Amoonguss makes for a reliable partner, as it sponges strong physical hits from Pokemon that could otherwise overwhelm offensive Slowbro, like Terrakion, and checks Primarina, which Slowbro cannot threaten without Psychium Z. Amoonguss also forms a Regenerator core with Slowbro, and generates free turns to set up Future Sight through Spore. Steel-types like Cobalion and Scizor are appreciated to answer the bulky Fairy-types such as Florges and Sylveon that can take anything Slowbro throws at them. Slowbro's Future Sight support also helps Cobalion beat Amoonguss. Scizor is able to check Celebi, which can be especially bothersome to Slowbro if Celebi is running Recover. Slowbro is also rather vulnerable to VoltTurn cores, so Pokemon like Hippowdon and Rhyperior are very useful for being able to take hits from Rotom-H and Mega Manectric. Hippowdon also takes hits from Terrakion and Scizor and can use Whirlwind to cause additional disruption with Future Sight. Slowbro appreciates Pursuit trappers like Scizor or Choice Scarf Krookodile to remove Pokemon that can overpower it such as Latias and Gengar.</p>"

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>Magneton's niche lies in its access to Magnet Pull, which allows it to trap and revenge kill the omnipresent Scizor. It can also reliably trap and remove key Steel-types in Klefki and Empoleon, which can open the door for teammates like Latias, Mega Altaria, and Nihilego to more easily sweep. Outside of trapping Steel-types, Magneton has decent offensive presence thanks to its high Special Attack, decent dual STAB coverage, and access to STAB Volt Switch. It can also utilize its decent defensive typing to pivot in on passive attackers like Florges and Togekiss if need be. Unfortunately, Magneton's niche is often offset by its pitiful bulk, which mostly prevents it from taking advantage of its useful resistances or reliably coming into play. This can complicate its ability to trap Scizor due to its fear of directly switching in, often requiring that it accomplish its role with support from a pivoting teammate or through aggressive double switching. This also hampers its ability to check many Pokemon most other Steel-types can handle, such as Latias and Nihilego. Magneton's poor defensive capabilities are further compounded by its weaknesses to common Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-type moves, which are often run as coverage by several Pokemon it could otherwise pressure, like Mega Aggron, Mega Altaria, and Togekiss. Its Speed is also extremely poor for an offensive Pokemon, leaving it outsped by the vast majority of the offensive metagame without a Choice Scarf and by Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and Zeraora even with a Choice Scarf. These flaws often prevent Magneton from being able to reliably provide for its team outside of its role as a trapper, meaning it faces severe competition from other Electric-types with stronger defining characteristics and niches, like Rotom-H and Mega Manectric, and should usually never be run unless trapping Steel-types is desired, making it a very niche Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set utilizing Electrium Z and Substitute can be used to better trap and remove bulkier Steel-types such as Mega Aggron while still being strong enough to remove Scizor. However, this comes at the cost of taking up the Z-Move from a partner that would benefit from it better as well as leaving Magneton completely walled by Mega Steelix.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Magneton's poor bulk allows faster threats such as Terrakion, Krookodile, and Mega Sharpedo to heavily threaten it with powerful STAB moves. Even its Choice Scarf set can be outpaced and threatened by Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Manectric, and Zeraora, as well as faster Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Krookodile, and Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types resist Magneton's STAB combination, and all have various ways of punishing it. Zeraora is immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch by virtue of its access to Volt Absorb, and it can either punish Magneton for setup turns or KO it with Close Combat. Mega Manectric can utilize its base forme ability in Lightning Rod to gain a Special Attack boost upon coming in on Magneton's Electric-type attacks while forcing it out with Overheat. Rotom-H resists any attack Magneton can throw at it while threatening to KO it with Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: The likes of Hippowdon, Krookodile, Nidoking, and Gligar can all take a hit and OHKO Magneton with super effective STAB attacks. While Mamoswine fears coming in on Flash Cannon, it too can force Magneton out with its 4x super effective Earthquake. Mega Steelix is particularly troublesome, as it is only hit hard by the rather punishable Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Fire and can KO Magneton with Earthquake, set up Stealth Rock on it, or set up with Curse. Swampert is also a particularly effective check because it resists any common attack Magneton can throw at it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon often have easy ways of taking Magneton on. Blissey doesn't fear any of its attacks and can wear it down with Seismic Toss or perform one of its many potential utility roles. While Alolan Muk doesn't love taking repeated Volt Switches, it can threaten to trap Magneton with Pursuit or cripple it with Knock Off. Snorlax can also repeatedly sponge hits from Magneton while using it to set up with Curse or outright KOing it with Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Of the two Electric-type attacks Magneton runs, Thunderbolt is the most powerful, making it a useful option in situations in which Magneton wishes to wallbreak without pivoting out of play. It's also useful for reliably 2HKOing Empoleon and Klefki while pressuring bulky Water-types. Hidden Power Fire cleanly OHKOes Scizor, Magneton's primary target, while dealing respectable damage to Mega Steelix. It is important to note, however, that it deals less damage than Thunderbolt to any Steel-type other than the two mentioned. Flash Cannon deals decent damage to various Pokemon that may try switching in on an Electric-type attack, notably 2HKOing both Hippowdon and Latias after Stealth Rock damage. It also hits Florges and Sylveon super effectively. Volt Switch pivots Magneton out of play as it forces switches. It can also be useful for guaranteeing heavy chip damage on Mega Aggron without fear of its Earthquake.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Specs puts considerable power behind Magneton's attacks, allowing it to 2HKO Empoleon and Klefki with Thunderbolt while OHKOing Scizor with Hidden Power Fire after Stealth Rock damage. Magnet Pull lets Magneton trap and remove Steel-types such as Empoleon, Scizor, Klefki, and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Magneton's most effective method of removing Steel-types like Scizor and Bronzong is through coming in on them on an aggressive double switch, as they will be cautious of staying in play very long in fear of getting trapped. This strategy is quite risky and prediction reliant, however. If Magneton is being run alongside a partner holding Eject Button, like Amoonguss or Alomomola, it should try utilizing them to freely come in on Scizor. Magneton's poor bulk prevents it from reliably coming in on many Pokemon, including those it traps, meaning its best opportunities to come into play are through the support of a pivot or after a teammate has fainted. However, Magneton's typing can allow it to come in on a few resisted weak attacks, like Florges's Moonblast and Amoonguss's Giga Drain, if need be. It can most easily come in on Klefki, which is unable to remotely dent Magneton due to usually only running Play Rough to deal damage. Steel-types that can tank at least one hit and punish Magneton, like Mega Aggron and Stakataka, should be hit with Volt Switch in order for Magneton to guarantee solid chip damage while preventing itself from being OHKOed or crippled. Due to this set's decent power, it can function as a formidable early- to mid-game wallbreaker. However, Magneton should only try doing this if trapping Steel-types isn't needed or if it's already accomplished its role. Volt Switch should be spammed the most out of Magneton's attacks due to its ability to deal decent damage, chip switch-ins, and generate momentum as Magneton forces switches. If a Ground-type is predicted to switch in on an expected Volt Switch, it is best for Magneton to try nabbing them with Flash Cannon, as the likes of Hippowdon, Gligar, and Krookodile can all be 2HKOed by the attack, though the former often requires some prior damage. Mega Steelix is an exception, however, as it doesn't take meaningful damage from Flash Cannon but is weak to Fire-type moves, meaning Magneton should use Hidden Power Fire to nail it on the switch if it expects Mega Steelix to come in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Magneton fits well on offensive teams that appreciate a surefire way of removing Scizor. Dragon-types, such as Mega Altaria, Haxorus, and Latias, greatly appreciate Magneton's ability to remove or heavily weaken troublesome Steel-types for them, like Scizor and Mega Aggron. Other offensive Pokemon like Celebi, Mega Sharpedo, Togekiss, and Nihilego appreciate Magneton's ability to reliably remove or weaken Bronzong, Empoleon, Klefki, and Scizor. Pokemon that are particularly weak to Scizor due to its priority, such as Terrakion and Gengar, also appreciate Magneton as a teammate. Although its intended purpose isn't to pressure Water- and Fairy-types, Magneton can do this well with this set's breaking power, providing various sweepers, like Infernape, with easier opportunities to clean up. Magneton itself enjoys pivoting support from partners like Infernape, Scizor, Mega Beedrill, and Hydreigon due to its limited opportunities to safely switch in. It also appreciates Pokemon capable of taking on Ground-types reliably, like Tsareena, Primarina, and Togekiss. Electric-type checks such as Kyurem and Gligar are often solid teammates due to Magneton's inability to adequately damage the likes of Mega Manectric and Zeraora. Pokemon capable of breaking past specially defensive foes that Magneton can't muscle through, like Blissey and Alolan Muk, are also good partners, making Terrakion and Crawdaunt solid options. Pokemon with the ability Regenerator, like Amoonguss and Alomomola, can utilize an Eject Button to safely get Magneton in against an opposing Scizor, as it commonly finds itself using U-turn against them. Pokemon that can deal with Latias and Celebi are necessary, as Magneton is incapable of switching into them, so the likes of Mamoswine, Scizor, and Mimikyu make great partners.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt is Magneton's stronger Electric-type STAB attack, requiring much less chip damage for it to revenge kill Pokemon like Cobalion and Togekiss. It also OHKOes Moltres and Starmie. Hidden Power Fire's only use is to hit all variants of Scizor, Magneton's main target, for heavy damage, only failing to OHKO bulkier variants. Other than Scizor and Mega Steelix, all other Steel-types are hit harder by Thunderbolt. Flash Cannon can allow Magneton to revenge kill Pokemon like Terrakion, unboosted Mega Altaria, and Mamoswine. Volt Switch pivots Magneton out of play, allowing it to adequately chip Steel-types it can't OHKO while generating momentum.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf lets Magneton outpace Cobalion and revenge kill it after some chip damage. It also allows Magneton to surprise and more easily take on Pokemon like Mamoswine, Starmie, and Kyurem. Magnet Pull is essential in allowing Magneton to trap opposing Steel-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set aims to reliably revenge kill Scizor with Hidden Power Fire, removing it from play. Since Magneton won't be able to directly switch in and opposing Scizor will be playing cautiously to avoid getting trapped, Magneton's best opportunities to come in on it are through double switches from Pokemon that often lure Scizor in, like Fairy- and Psychic-types. Magneton's frailty often means that its most reliable methods of coming in will be through a teammate's pivoting support or after a teammate has fainted. It can, however, come in on weak resisted hits from relatively passive Pokemon like Florges and Diancie. Magneton should take advantage of its enhanced Speed to function as a decent revenge killer, as it can outrun and KO several common fast offensive threats, like Gengar, Starmie, and Nihilego, after some chip damage. One of this set's main draws is its ability to more easily take on Cobalion. Thus, Magneton should try finding an opportunity to come in on Cobalion, chip it with Volt Switch if it isn't in range of Thunderbolt, and revenge kill it with Thunderbolt when it's weakened enough. Volt Switch should be used to generate momentum on forced switches after Magneton has accomplished trapping its designated targets. However, due to this set's lower damage output, Magneton must look out for letting defensive Ground-types like Gligar and Hippowdon in for free. Despite the increased Speed Choice Scarf provides, Magneton will still not be able to outrun especially fast Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Zeraora, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Manectric. It is also slower than most opposing Choice Scarf users, like Hydreigon and Krookodile. Due to this, it is not advised to stay in on those threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive teams that appreciate the removal of Steel-types, particularly Scizor, value Magneton for its ability to do this while functioning as an adequate revenge killer if need be. Dragon-types like Latias and Mega Altaria particularly appreciate Magneton's support, making them excellent partners. Pokemon that appreciate Fairy-type checks on their team, like Hydreigon, also pair well with Magneton. Pokemon with Regenerator, like Alomomola and Amoonguss, can use Eject Button to allow Magneton a free opportunity to switch in against Scizor, making its role much easier to accomplish. Magneton itself appreciates Ground-type checks, like Mega Blastoise, Togekiss, and Celebi, as well as Pokemon capable of answering Electric-types, such as Krookodile, Gligar, and Mega Altaria. It also values support from pivots capable of safely bringing it into play, like Infernape, Scizor, and Tsareena. Powerful wallbreakers are also appreciated by Magneton for their ability to weaken Pokemon into range of its attacks due to this set's middling power. This makes Nidoking and Mamoswine worthy teammates. Checks to faster threats like Mega Aerodactyl, Zeraora, and Mega Manectric are necessary, so Pokemon like Hippowdon, Mega Altaria, Nidoqueen, and Rhyperior make great partners. Offensive Psychic- and Dragon-types like Latias and Celebi give Magneton a hard time, as it struggles to break past and check them, therefore partners capable of checking them such as Scizor, Blissey, and Mega Aerodactyl are essential. Lastly, Magneton appreciates entry hazard support on its team, particularly for allowing it to more easily KO bulky Scizor sets with Hidden Power Fire, making Nihilego and Gligar worthwhile teammates.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Alolan Muk's stellar defensive typing and above average special bulk let it be an excellent special tank and one of the best Pursuit trappers in the tier, capable of providing valuable support to teams by removing threats such as Latias, Chandelure, and Gengar. Knock Off in combination with Alolan Muk's ability Poison Touch can make a deadly combination, as many of its common switch-ins like Swampert and Krookodile are easily worn down when deprived of their item and poisoned. However, Alolan Muk's low physical bulk makes it easily exploitable by physical attackers like Cobalion, Terrakion, and Krookodile, although it does have some methods of punishing them if they try to set up on it. Alolan Muk is also extremely conscious of its health; if it is worn down, it is no longer able to threaten Pokemon like Calm Mind Latias. Also, Alolan Muk's low Speed means that it will almost always need to take a hit before attacking, which makes keeping it healthy throughout the game a somewhat difficult task. The combination of these traits means that Alolan Muk has a decent amount of competition as a Pursuit trapper from more offensive Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Krookodile, and Scizor, although its good bulk still makes it a staple as a Pursuit trapper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Explosion can also be used, as it lets Alolan Muk KO or heavily damage a foe and gain momentum for the team when its job of Pursuit trapping is complete, but Explosion also leaves Alolan Muk unable to hit Klefki and other bulky Steel-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Physical attackers such as Terrakion, Cobalion, and Mega Aerodactyl can use Alolan Muk as setup bait and force it out with the threat of heavy damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Swampert, Krookodile, and Hippowdon can easily take any of Alolan Muk's attacks and threaten it out with their super effective STAB attacks, although most of them are bothered by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Scizor, Cobalion, and Mega Aggron can take most of Alolan Muk's attacks and force it out, but Scizor is eliminated by Fire Punch. Cobalion and Mega Aggron are especially notable, as Cobalion gains an Attack boost from Knock Off thanks to Justified and is not 2HKOed by Fire Punch, while Mega Aggron takes essentially nothing from any of Alolan Muk's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Alolan Muk needs to be as healthy as possible in order to effectively Pursuit trap foes such as Latias and Chandelure, so residual damage from entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and U-turn users such as Celebi and Choice Scarf Hydreigon can make Alolan Muk rather ineffective at its role.</p> <p><strong>Lures</strong>: Pokemon such as Groundium Z Celebi can lure in Alolan Muk and KO it with their strong Z-Moves. If Alolan Muk is somewhat worn down, foes such as Calm Mind Dragonium Z Latias can also take it out. Some special attackers such as Rotom-H and Rotom-C can carry Will-O-Wisp to cripple Alolan Muk on the switch.</p>",

      "Pursuit Trapper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit lets Alolan Muk trap and remove Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latias and Chandelure as well as reliably weaken other special attackers like Nihilego, Moltres, and Rotom-C. Gunk Shot is Alolan Muk's strongest attack, and it lets Alolan Muk OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Pidgeot after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Pokemon such as Hydreigon. Gunk Shot is also capable of pressuring Blissey more easily. Alternatively, Poison Jab can be used as a more accurate and more reliable Poison-type STAB attack that takes full advantage of Poison Touch with a combined 51% chance to poison foes. Knock Off is a general utility move that is also Alolan Muk's strongest Dark-type STAB attack; it can remove items from common switch-ins like Swampert and Rhyperior to punish them. Fire Punch lets Alolan Muk threaten Steel-types like Scizor and Klefki on the switch. Shadow Sneak is an alternative option over Fire Punch that lets Alolan Muk reliably switch in and beat Calm Mind Dragonium Z Latias, and it also can be used to pick off severely weakened threats more easily. Fire Blast is an alternative over Fire Punch that can deal more damage to Cobalion, but it does less damage than Fire Punch to Scizor and specially defensive Klefki and is also less accurate. Focus Punch lets Alolan Muk hit Terrakion, Cobalion, and Krookodile on the switch and deal heavy damage to Blissey if it uses a status move. However, the move is very tricky to use, so it's rather niche.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with an Adamant nature lets Alolan Muk deal as much damage as possible. Maximum Special Defense EVs with an Assault Vest give Alolan Muk a very respectable amount of special bulk to check threats such as Celebi and Gengar more effectively. A Brave nature should be used if running Fire Blast so Alolan Muk's Special Attack is not decreased. Poison Touch gives all of Alolan Muk's contact attacks an additional chance to poison foes. Alolan Muk's spread is extremely customizable depending on the needs of the team; for example, it can run a bulkier spread of 252 HP / 112 Atk / 112 SpD / 32 Spe with an Adamant nature, which allows it to outspeed Swampert, take physical hits like Swampert's Earthquake and Cobalion's Close Combat better, and overall take less chip damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Keep Alolan Muk healthy in matchups where it can Pursuit trap foes such as Latias and Chandelure, as they can break through it easily if it takes too much damage beforehand. On the other hand, if there are no Pokemon that Alolan Muk will be particularly useful against, it can either be used as a sacrifice or attempt to spread poison and remove the items of foes with Knock Off until it is taken out. Alolan Muk needs to predict carefully against foes such as Calm Mind Latias and Calm Mind Chandelure; for example, if the foe has a boost from Calm Mind, Alolan Muk may want to consider using Knock Off rather than Pursuit for the increased damage output. Be aware, though, that +1 Dragonium Z Latias is capable of breaking past Alolan Muk anyway if it is healthy enough to survive a Knock Off. Sometimes, if Alolan Muk is in against a foe that it checks that doesn't threaten the team much, it may be best to let them switch out so that Alolan Muk can hit a predicted switch-in such as Swampert or Scizor with Knock Off or Fire Punch in order to cripple or KO them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon such as Cobalion and Infernape that struggle against threats such as Latias, Chandelure, and Gengar heavily appreciate Alolan Muk's ability to Pursuit trap these threats. Setup sweepers like Scizor and Cobalion heavily appreciate the removal of specially offensive revenge killers like Chandelure and Alolan Muk's ability to soften up foes by poisoning them and removing their items. Grass- and Water-types like Celebi, Rotom-C, Suicune, and Starmie make good partners for Alolan Muk because they can deal with Ground-types like Rhyperior, Swampert, and Hippowdon. Checks to Fighting-types such as Chandelure and Doublade can beat foes such as Cobalion and Infernape that exploit Alolan Muk. Wish support from Pokemon such as Sylveon and Alomomola and entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Mantine, and Rotom-C are very valuable for Alolan Muk so that it can stay healthy throughout the match. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom-C, Infernape, and Scizor can bring Alolan Muk in safely against several of the foes that it Pursuit traps.</p>"

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar is a threatening offensive Pokemon thanks to its great offensive typing, stats, and movepool. Unlike most other Ghost-types, Gengar is hard to reliably Pursuit trap thanks to Substitute, which eases prediction and can put the opposing team in a very tough spot. Gengar is also capable of pressuring Fairy-, Fighting-, and Psychic-types like Mega Altaria, Terrakion, and Celebi, which makes it useful for an offensive team to have. However, Gengar has poor all-around bulk, making it very susceptible to faster threats and priority. Its typing doesn't grant it many useful resistances either, meaning it generally has a hard time finding free turns to set up a Substitute. Substitute also often puts it in range of priority and faster threats, making it somewhat easily revenge killed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Since Gengar commonly forces switches, a set utilizing Substitute, Hex, and Will-O-Wisp provides Gengar with a powerful STAB option and a method of annoying bulkier teams with status and its Substitute. Choice Specs and Choice Scarf can be used to give Gengar an immediate power or Speed boost, but its STAB moves are very easy to take advantage of.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Krookodile, while being unable to switch into a Focus Blast, threaten to obliterate Gengar with their Dark-type moves. Additionally, Gengar is susceptible to being Pursuit trapped with its abysmal bulk. It must be noted that both Pokemon can't beat Gengar behind a Substitute. Of particular note, Gengar is unable to do any notable amount of damage to Alolan Muk and is then Pursuit trapped, making it relatively unfazed by Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Although Gengar is quite fast, there exist faster Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Starmie, and Mega Beedrill that are able to outspeed and OHKO Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Similar to faster Pokemon, users of priority moves, such as Doublade and Scizor, avoid having to outspeed Gengar and cut through its paper-thin defenses.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey, Alolan Muk, Umbreon, and Hippowdon can all comfortably tank the majority of hits Gengar will throw their way, though they have to be wary of being in range of Never-Ending Nightmare or All-Out Pummeling.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is very useful against Pursuit trappers like Krookodile, Bisharp, and Mega Aerodactyl, which are often used as counterplay to Gengar. Shadow Ball can be turned into a powerful Never-Ending Nightmare, which allows Gengar to better remove the likes of Gligar, Tentacruel, and Hippowdon. Focus Blast is necessary to OHKO Dark-types such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Bisharp. It can also be used with Fightinium Z to have a powerful, perfectly accurate Fighting-type move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Ghostium Z turns Shadow Ball into a strong Never-Ending Nightmare, which allows it to break past many most bulky walls and still does a sizeable amount of damage to Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Empoleon, and in the case of Scizor OHKO it after Stealth Rock. Fightinium Z turns Focus Blast into a perfectly accurate 190-Base Power All-Out Pummeling, which can reliably OHKO Dark-types as well as other threats like Terrakion and Cobalion as well as Empoleon after some chip damage. Life Orb can be used instead, if another member values the Z-Move more, to give a significant power boost to all of Gengar's moves, but it makes Focus Blast rather unreliable and wears Gengar down. Black Sludge is an option to increase the number of times Gengar can use Substitute and improve its longevity overall.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gengar is too frail to switch directly into most attacks, so it needs to be brought in after a teammate has been KOed, by an aggressive double switch, or by Volt Switch or U-turn. Gengar's typing and high Special Attack allow it to force out common Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Slowbro, which means it usually gets several opportunities in a game to set up a Substitute. Gengar can switch into passive foes whose STAB moves it resists like Sylveon, Amoonguss, and Florges often to gain free turns. In general, it's best to use Substitute quite often, but against teams with Pursuit trappers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile or priority users in Scizor and Crawdaunt, use Substitute as much as possible, as this eliminates the risk of predicting wrong with its coverage moves and can put the opponent in a very bad spot. For example, Substitute can be used when you expect the opponent to sacrifice something to Gengar; in this situation, you can turn Gengar potentially getting Pursuit trapped after a sacrifice into Gengar picking up two KOs. It can also be used when a foe that resists Shadow Ball, like Choice Scarf Hydreigon, is expected to come in to take the blow as well as play mind games around Sucker Punch and Pursuit from Bisharp. Don't let Gengar get too worn down by residual damage, as it needs to be able to use Substitute often and survive attacking moves. For this reason, make sure there aren't too many entry hazards on the field before sending Gengar out. Ghostium Z should primarily be used behind the safety of Substitute in order to 2HKO the likes of Gligar and Hippowdon after Stealth Rock safely, without the fear of being OHKOed by Earthquake. Fightinium Z is best used to secure an OHKO against Dark-types like Krookodile and Bisharp on the switch or while behind a Substitute, as using it any other time means Gengar must risk missing. If using Black Sludge, Gengar can afford to use Substitute more often, as it gets many more chances to use Substitute with Black Sludge than with any other item on the set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gengar fits best on offensive teams, as it's powerful and fast, being able to check threats such as Terrakion and Togekiss in a pinch. Teams often rely on threats like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Krookodile to check Gengar, so Justified users like Cobalion, Terrakion, and Lucario are able to take advantage of these threats to gain a free turn. Setup sweepers like Scizor, Mega Altaria, and Suicune also appreciate the setup opportunities Gengar can naturally give them by baiting Choice-locked Pokemon such as Krookodile and Scizor to use Pursuit. Entry hazard setters like Cobalion, Krookodile, and Klefki are able to help put threats like Hippowdon and Empoleon in range of Never-Ending Nightmare or All-Out Pummeling. Additionally, Toxic Spikes from Tentacruel and Nidoqueen pairs nicely with Substitute Gengar, as it can rack up chip damage on threats like Hippowdon and Blissey that would normally give Gengar a hard time. Gengar hates hazards, as they wear it down into range of attacks and limit the number of times it can use Substitute. Entry hazard removers like Starmie and Hydreigon fit well on offensive teams next to Gengar, and Starmie can check and spin on Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gligar, which threaten Gengar. Other Pokemon such as Tsareena, Primarina, and Mega Slowbro can also check Ground-types. If Gengar isn't behind a Substitute, priority users like Scizor, Crawdaunt, and Mamoswine can pick off Gengar after some chip damage. Therefore, Pokemon such as Moltres, Hydreigon, and Infernape make for good teammates. Without a boosting item, Gengar struggles against most walls, so wallbreakers like Terrakion, Mamoswine, and Lucario make for good teammates. Volt Switch and U-turn users like Rotom-H, Mega Manectric, Scizor, and Hydreigon can bring Gengar in so it doesn't have to take too much damage. Hydreigon in particular pairs extremely well with Gengar, as it invites in Fairy-types like Primarina and Mega Altaria, which Gengar can take advantage of to get a free Susbtitute against.</p>"

  "Marowak-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alolan Marowak's solid offensive presence and access to useful abilties in Rock Head and Lightning Rod make it an effective wallbreaker and Stealth Rock setter, using its advantageous matchup against common removers like Empoleon and Rotom-H to more easily keep the entry hazard up. Despite not being perfect defensively, its typing combined with Lightning Rod provides it with key resistances and immunities, notably allowing it keep threats like Infernape, Cobalion, and Mega Manectric in check. Despite this, however, Alolan Marowak's defensive presence is still lackluster due to its vulnerability to all entry hazards, only decent bulk, and weaknesses to prominent types like Dark, Water, and Ground. The typing disadvantages are notable, as they limit Alolan Marowak's ability to switch into certain checks and leave it vulnerable to Pursuit trapping. Alolan Marowak also faces extreme competition from Terrakion and Infernape as a wallbreaker as well as from Cobalion and Krookodile as an offensive Stealth Rock setter, as these examples are all faster and have greater defensive presence while still having good offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off is a good utility option that cripples defensive Pokemon by removing their item, giving Alolan Marowak and its teammates an easier time muscling through Pokemon that are reliant on their item for longevity or bulk such as Swampert and Gligar; however, Knock Off doesn't threaten much that isn't already threatened by Alolan Marowak's STAB moves. Substitute allows Alolan Marowak to exploit Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Infernape as well as avoid being Pursuit trapped once, though this makes wearing it down easier. Alolan Marowak also has a hard time finding room for it, and it would much rather have coverage for Hydreigon in most cases.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Dark-types</strong>: Hydreigon resists Alolan Marowak's STAB combination and can easily force it out with the prospect of Dark Pulse. Krookodile can take any one unboosted attack thanks to Intimidate and OHKO Alolan Marowak with its STAB moves as well as Pursuit trap it. Crawdaunt and Mega Sharpedo can force Alolan Marowak out and take advantage of this by using Swords Dance and having Speed Boost activate, respectively. It should be noted that these examples can't always switch in because of Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit trappers like Scizor, Krookodile, and Mega Aerodactyl are capable of trapping Alolan Marowak, which allows them to either KO or heavily damage it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Alolan Marowak can easily be revenge killed by a host of offensive threats such as Mamoswine, Primarina, Nihilego, and Gengar. Even certain defensive Pokemon like Suicune and Tentacruel can outpace and KO Alolan Marowak.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage</strong>: Due to its vulnerability to entry hazards and Toxic poison as well as it being relied on to block Volt Switch throughout the match and soft check Pokemon like Scizor, Alolan Marowak is easy to wear down and put into range of even resisted attacks such as Infernape's Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water- and Ground-types</strong>: Although they struggle with stomaching boosted attacks, bulky Water- and Ground-types like Suicune, Alomomola, Swampert, and Hippowdon heavily damage Alolan Marowak with their STAB moves. Quagsire is another notable roadblock, as it isn't 2HKOed by Shadow Bone and ignores stat changes thanks to Unaware.</p>",

      "Offensive Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB move, notably 2HKOing Hippowdon and Mega Aggron. Alternatively, Fire Punch can be used in conjunction with Lightning Rod to avoid recoil damage, however it is significantly weaker. Stealth Rock whittles away at opposing Pokemon whenever they switch in, with the number of switches Alolan Marowak can force as well as its ability to pressure removers like Empoleon and Rotom-H giving it more opportunities to set the entry hazard. Low Kick heavily damages Crawdaunt and OHKOes Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo, which is notable given that all of these Pokemon resist Alolan Marowak's STAB combination. Bonemerang can be used instead to more reliably KO foes like Empoleon, Alolan Muk, and Diancie, and it also almost always OHKOes Mega Manectric even after Intimidate.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>172 Speed EVs allow Alolan Marowak to outspeed uninvested base 65s and slower, such as Alomomola, bulky Scizor, Empoleon, and Hippowdon. Thick Club doubles Alolan Marowak's Attack, which turns it into an immensely powerful wallbreaker. Rock Head prevents Alolan Marowak from taking recoil damage when it uses Flare Blitz. Alternatively, Lightning Rod provides Alolan Marowak with an immunity to Electric-type moves, notably enabling it to block Volt Switch and serve as a solid offensive check to Pokemon like Mega Manectric, Rotom-H, and Zeraora lacking Knock Off.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Unless absolutely necessary, refrain from switching Alolan Marowak in if entry hazards are up, as this limits its ability to tank resisted and weaker neutral attacks as well as wallbreak. Alolan Marowak should also avoid being poisoned by Toxic or Toxic Spikes, as this wears it down even faster. Try to set Stealth Rock as soon as possible, as doing so gives Alolan Marowak and its team an easier time pressuring the opposing team. Switching into Pokemon like Cobalion and Scizor can provide Alolan Marowak with a free opportunity to set Stealth Rock as they switch out. Take advantage of Lightning Rod by switching Alolan Marowak into Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Rotom-H as its immunity to their STAB moves and resistance to their coverage moves often allows it to force them out and gives it a chance to attack. However, Alolan Marowak can easily be overworked as both a Stealth Rock user and a pivot into these threats, which can hinder its ability to effectively wallbreak. Because of its typing, Alolan Marowak can also switch into threats such as Florges and Infernape. Try to predict against teams with Pokemon like Hydreigon and Crawdaunt by either catching them off guard with Low Kick or double switching, as doing so takes a lot of pressure off of Alolan Marowak and can allow it to more reliably spam its STAB moves and break through opposing teams later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Marowak generally fits on offensive and bulky offensive teams that appreciate having a powerful wallbreaker that can support the rest of the team by either setting Stealth Rock or pressuring defensive cores with its strong attacks. Due to Alolan Marowak's vulnerability to entry hazards, removers such as Hydreigon, Rotom-C, and Tsareena make for useful teammates. These examples are also capable of pressuring bulky Water- and Ground-types for Alolan Marowak while it threatens checks to them such as Florges, Rotom-H, and Amoonguss. Pokemon that can check Dark-types and sponge Knock Off such as Cobalion and Florges are valuable, as these are Alolan Marowak's primary weaknesses. Swords Dance Cobalion appreciates Alolan Marowak threatening Slowbro and wearing down physically bulky Pokemon such as Swampert, while Florges can mitigate Alolan Marowak's vulnerability to entry hazards and lack of reliable recovery with Wish, respectively. Pivots such as Scizor, Mega Manectric, and Hydreigon are useful teammates to have, as they give Alolan Marowak an easier time switching in and threatening teams. The former two also appreciate Alolan Marowak's ability to wear down bulky Ground-types, which they tend to struggle with. Late-game sweepers and cleaners such as Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Calm Mind Latias have an easier time finishing teams off as a result of the pressure Alolan Marowak applies. These Pokemon can also exploit Choice-locked Krookodile, a common revenge killer, depending on what move it locks into.</p>"

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>Starmie is an excellent offensive Pokemon thanks to its great coverage options and useful ability Analytic, and it is also the fastest Rapid Spin user in the tier. In addition to having great offensive capabilities, it also has adequate tools such as Natural Cure, Recover, and Reflect Type that let it viably run a bulkier set geared more towards support. Starmie's Speed tier is fantastic, letting it outspeed many offensive threats like Latias, Terrakion, and Infernape. However, Starmie's raw power without boosts is lacking due to its middling base 100 Special Attack, which can cause it some trouble in breaking past bulkier Pokemon such as Sylveon and Snorlax. This is much more apparent when using bulky variants of Starmie with no Special Attack investment, making these variants unfortunately rather passive versus targets that do not care about burns. While its Water / Psychic typing gives it some useful resistances that allow it to act as a soft check to Pokemon such as Infernape and Cobalion, Starmie is moderately frail, which means that without investment it will not be able to switch in on even many resisted hits. Its typing also gives it a very serious weakness to Electric-, Bug-, Dark-, Ghost-, and Grass-type attacks, which leaves it extremely vulnerable to strategies such as Pursuit trapping and VoltTurn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulky Starmie can run Reflect Type to help its matchup against Pokemon it would normally struggle with due to its typing such as Bisharp and Scizor. Offensive Starmie can run Waterium Z if its team does not have another Z-Move user, which allows it to use a 185-Base Power Hydro Vortex, but this lowers the power of its other moves. Starmie can attempt to use a set taking advantage of the boost to Special Attack provided by Z-Gravity with Hydro Pump, Thunder, and Blizzard to try to perform the role of a setup sweeper, but this set is unreliable outside of Gravity, and it can easily be stopped in the middle of its one chance to sweep by faster Pokemon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types and Pursuit Users</strong>: Hydreigon, Mandibuzz, and Mega Sharpedo are all able to take a Hydro Pump and deal heavy damage in return, and Pursuit users like Mega Aerodactyl, Scizor, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and especially Alolan Muk, which can survive almost any hit from Starmie, are capable of trapping Starmie and taking it out with ease. Several of these must watch out for Reflect Type variants of Starmie, however.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Specially bulky Pokemon like Empoleon, Snorlax, and Blissey are capable of taking Starmie's attacks, although Blissey is forced to use Soft-Boiled after an Analytic-boosted Psyshock, and Empoleon can be 2HKOed by Thunderbolt on the switch. Bulky Starmie sets, however, cannot break through these Pokemon at all outside of using Toxic on those vulnerable to it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Offensive Starmie is easily worn down by burns, Toxic poison, and entry hazards, along with its own Life Orb recoil, and this severely limits its longevity if it's not running Recover.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Sceptile and Zeraora as well as Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile are capable of outspeeding and OHKOing Starmie, even if they cannot switch in directly.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Special Attackers</strong>: Bulky variants of Starmie have few ways of damaging Pokemon like Latias, Suicune, and Hydreigon outside of Toxic, which makes said variants of Starmie setup fodder for these Pokemon.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Starmie's primary STAB attack and its strongest attack. Ice Beam allows Starmie to hit Dragon- and Grass-types like Latias, Mega Altaria, and Celebi super effectively. Psyshock is Starmie's secondary STAB move and second strongest attack, dealing great neutral damage to special walls and Water-resistant Pokemon like Blissey and Kyurem, and it also allows Starmie to easily take out Poison-types like Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Nihilego. Thunderbolt is another coverage move Starmie can use that allows it to hit Water-types like Empoleon, Alomomola, and Suicune super effectively. Rapid Spin provides entry hazard removal for your team, but it still causes Life Orb recoil if Starmie is using it, so it should be used sparingly. Recover can be run to enable Starmie to switch into Pokemon it checks such as Infernape more reliably, but it means that Starmie loses coverage or the ability to remove entry hazards for its team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Starmie hit as hard as possible while outspeeding threats like Cobalion and Latias and Speed tying with Pokemon like Azelf. Analytic gives Starmie's attacks a 1.3x power boost when the foe has switched out that turn, which severely limits Starmie's switch-ins. Analytic also gives a boost when Starmie moves last, but with Starmie's subpar bulk, this is generally not a method of damage boosting you should use often. Starmie uses a Life Orb to hit as hard as possible while still being able to switch moves at will. A Colbur Berry can alternatively be used to ease its matchup against Pursuit trappers like Choice Scarf Krookodile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Starmie should spend most of its time taking out predicted switch-ins like Latias with Analytic-boosted attacks or revenge killing what's in front of it. It is beneficial to predict well when using Starmie, as you waste the Analytic boost if you mispredict a switch-in and use the incorrect coverage move. If a switch to a Pokemon like Alolan Muk is predicted, attempt to double switch out to a Pokemon with a better matchup in order to avoid being Pursuit trapped. Starmie should only use Rapid Spin in emergencies, like when Sticky Web is up on your side or if entry hazards are stacked to a point where you would lose otherwise, since it would much rather be attacking the opposing team if it has the opportunity. Because of its poor bulk, Starmie should primarily be brought in with free switches from users of U-turn or Volt Switch, predicted double switches, or after one of your other team members has fainted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Starmie fits best on bulky offense teams, but it can also function on hyper offense. Fighting-type Pokemon like Cobalion, Terrakion, and Infernape help with the Dark-types like Bisharp and Alolan Muk that give Starmie trouble. These Fighting-types also help to break past specially bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Snorlax that Starmie struggles with. On a similar note, physical wallbreakers like Mamoswine can also assist in breaking past special walls like Blissey. Pokemon that enjoy entry hazard removal like Mega Pidgeot, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Chandelure enjoy having Starmie as a partner due to its ability to use Rapid Spin. Users of Volt Switch and U-turn like Scizor, Hydreigon, and Mega Beedrill make good partners for Starmie, as they can bring it in safely. Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes setters like Cobalion, Klefki, and Nihilego will help Starmie decimate opposing teams more easily. Starmie functions excellently on Sticky Web teams, as it can easily clean through many bulky offense and balance teams without having to worry about being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Krookodile. Therefore, setters like Araquanid and other Sticky Web sweepers like Bisharp and Mamoswine are good partners.</p>"

      "Bulky Spinner": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Starmie's primary method of dealing damage, and it also has a 30% chance to burn opposing Pokemon, which lets Starmie cripple physical threats like Mega Altaria and Terrakion. Toxic lets Starmie deal damage over time to Pokemon that would otherwise wall it like Latias, Hydreigon, and Seismitoad. Protect is also a valuable option for Starmie to let it gain vital information in scouting Choice item users like Hydreigon and Latias. Recover lets Starmie stay healthy throughout a match. Rapid Spin is used to support the team by removing entry hazards from the field. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple threats such as Hydreigon and Latias for its teammates as well as punish switch-ins.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Speed investment with a Timid nature gives Starmie a decent amount of bulk while still letting it outspeed threats like Cobalion and Latias and Speed tie with Pokemon like Mega Houndoom. Natural Cure gives Starmie a way to heal itself from status effects like paralysis and Toxic poison. Starmie uses Leftovers as a form of passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Starmie's primary goal in a match is to act as a reliable form of entry hazard removal, so keep it healthy throughout a match with Recover, and keep hazards off the field whenever possible. Bring Starmie into threats that cannot do much to it like Cobalion and Choice-locked Infernape, or bring it in by pivoting to keep it healthy. If Starmie is facing physical attackers like Cobalion, try fishing for Scald burns to weaken them. If you predict the opponent to switch to one of the many Pokemon that Starmie cannot bypass by normal means such as Latias and Seismitoad, either switch out to avoid a loss of momentum or use Toxic to cripple them. Use Reflect Type in situations where taking on the foe's type would be beneficial, such as to evade a Pursuit from Alolan Muk or weaken the damage done by Volt Switch and U-turn from Rotom-C and Scizor. If Starmie has not been damaged yet and has yet to perform an attack, you can attempt to bluff a more offensive Starmie set in order to force out Pokemon like Tentacruel and weakened Latias. However, this method is not reliable and should be used with caution.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Starmie can fit well on bulky offense and balance teams. Fighting-type Pokemon like Cobalion, Heracross, and Infernape help to beat the Dark-types like Bisharp and Hydreigon that give Starmie trouble. Pokemon that enjoy reliable entry hazard removal like Mega Aerodactyl and Togekiss enjoy having Starmie as a partner due to its proficiency as a Rapid Spin user. Users of Volt Switch and U-turn like Scizor, Infernape, and Mega Manectric make good partners for Starmie, as they can bring it in safely. Starmie enjoys partners such as Mamoswine and Sylveon that can deal with the Dragon-types like Latias and Hydreigon that Starmie lets in easily. Starmie also enjoys Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Mega Sceptile that can beat opposing Water-types like Suicune and Volcanion. Pokemon like Moltres also make good partners due to their ability to pressure opposing Grass-types like Amoonguss and Celebi.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Aerodactyl is one of the most dominant offensive Pokemon in the UU metagame thanks to its combination of speed, power, and versatility, allowing it to fit on every team archetype. Its immense base 150 Speed makes it the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the tier. A sizable base 135 Attack coupled with Tough Claws and a wide arsenal of moves, such as Stone Edge, Earthquake, Ice Fang, and Pursuit, allows Mega Aerodactyl to hit a vast amount of Pokemon in the tier super effectively. Pursuit lets it trap common Pokemon, such as Latias, Gengar, and Celebi. However, even with its vast movepool, Mega Aerodactyl still does not possess the necessary firepower to break through some of UU's bulkier walls, such as Swampert and Mega Aggron. Mega Aerodactyl is also susceptible to Stealth Rock due to its part Flying typing and weak to the powerful priority moves that flood the UU metagame, such as Bullet Punch from Scizor and Ice Shard from Mamoswine, meaning that it can be worn down rather easily when not packing Roost. Lastly, Mega Aerodactyl is outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Hydreigon, which can revenge kill it after Stealth Rock damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crunch hits Psychic-types, such as Latias and Celebi, harder than its other coverage moves but lacks the coverage of Mega Aerodactyl's other moves or the utility of Pursuit. Hone Claws turns Mega Aerodactyl into a potentially scary late-game sweeper, but it is easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users and priority moves. Taunt can be used to shut down defensive walls that rely on support moves to beat Mega Aerodactyl, such as Blissey, Hippowdon, and Alomomola lacking Scald.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Defensive Water-types such as Swampert, Slowbro, and Suicune take little damage from all of Mega Aerodactyl's attacks and can easily 2HKO it in return with their STAB attacks, as well as threaten to burn it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon, Gligar, and Swampert can handle most attacks aimed at them and beat Mega Aerodactyl through Toxic or super effective attacks. They can also set up Stealth Rock to pressure Mega Aerodactyl. However, Ground-types should watch out for Aqua Tail if they are weak to it, and Gligar should watch out for Ice Fang.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix can stomach hits from Mega Aerodactyl due to their high Defense and OHKO it with their strong STAB attacks. Empoleon and Cobalion can survive a single Earthquake and OHKO Mega Aerodactyl with their STAB attacks as well. Klefki can threaten Mega Aerodactyl out with its status moves and wall it if it has Magnet Rise.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves and Faster threats</strong>: Bullet Punch from Scizor is super effective and can OHKO Mega Aerodactyl with ease, while Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt and Ice Shard from Mamoswine can OHKO Mega Aerodactyl after Stealth Rock damage. Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Latias can outspeed and beat Mega Aerodactyl with prior damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge is Mega Aerodactyl's best STAB attack, allowing it to hit unresisted foes like Scizor and Primarina hard and Flying-types like Togekiss and Moltres for a significant amount of damage. Earthquake has great neutral coverage with Stone Edge and is Mega Aerodactyl's strongest way of hitting Steel-types that resist Stone Edge, such as Cobalion, Empoleon, and Bisharp. It's also useful for accurately hitting Poison-, Rock-, and Fire-types like Tentacruel, Terrakion, and Volcanion. Roost provides longevity by preventing Mega Aerodactyl from being easily worn down by Stealth Rock and can be used over any move bar Stone Edge if the team has the tools necessary to deal with the likes of Empoleon. Pursuit is great to allow Mega Aerodactyl to trap threats that it forces out naturally, such as Gengar, Celebi, and Latias. Ice Fang allows Mega Aerodactyl to hit Gligar hard and deal slightly more damage than Stone Edge to Dragon-types like Latias and Hydreigon. Aqua Tail is an option to hit Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Krookodile super effectively. Stealth Rock is a decent option if the team is in need of a setter due to the many switches Mega Aerodactyl forces; however, Mega Aerodactyl is strapped for moveslots as is. Fire Fang allows Mega Aerodactyl to OHKO Scizor, but keep in mind that it has far less overall coverage than Mega Aerodactyl's other coverage moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature allows Mega Aerodactyl to be as fast as possible, outspeeding all of the unboosted metagame and slower Choice Scarf users like Chandelure and Togekiss. Maximum Attack investment maximizes Mega Aerodactyl's offensive capabilities and lets it perform its role as efficiently as possible. Unnerve is the pre-Mega ability of choice, as it prevents foes from consuming Berries. Mega Aerodactyl obtains Tough Claws upon Mega Evolving, which increases its contact-based moves' power, such as Ice Fang and Pursuit, by 30%.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Mega Aerodactyl's typing to bring it in against resisted hits from the likes of Moltres and Togekiss when Stealth Rock is not present or if it is running Roost. Mega Aerodactyl's high base Speed and good coverage also allow it to be brought in to revenge kill Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Lucario, Infernape, and Mega Beedrill. Due to its wide arsenal of moves, Mega Aerodactyl is very good against offense. Weaken opposing teams as much as possible to give Mega Aerodactyl a chance to sweep late-game. Avoid bringing Mega Aerodactyl into Stealth Rock, as this limits the number of times it can come in throughout the match; this is especially important if Mega Aerodactyl is lacking Roost. However, do note that Mega Aerodactyl can pivot into some Stealth Rock users like Gligar to threaten them with its super effective coverage moves and avoid Stealth Rock damage. If the opposing Pokemon is in range of one of Mega Aerodactyl's coverage moves, use the coverage move instead of Stone Edge to beat it, as Stone Edge has less accuracy. Weakening opposing bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Slowbro, Swampert, and Hippowdon is vital, as they can stop Mega Aerodactyl's sweep with ease. Latias can be Pursuit trapped if it is locked into Draco Meteor after a stat drop. If a Hippowdon has recently been on the field and sandstorm is up, Mega Aerodactyl can pivot into and trap foes like Gengar and Latias more easily due to its increased Special Defense.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Teammates that can threaten bulky Ground- and Water-types are necessary, as Mega Aerodactyl cannot break past them by itself. As such, Grass-types like Rotom-C and Celebi make for fantastic offensive teammates. Due to its Stealth Rock weakness, Mega Aerodactyl appreciates hazard control from the likes of Tentacruel, Empoleon, Starmie, Hydreigon, and Volcanion. All of these partners are also capable of checking Water-types such as Primarina and Crawdaunt that Mega Aerodactyl struggles to deal with. It is imperative to have an answer to priority users such as Scizor, as Bullet Punch can easily OHKO Mega Aerodactyl, so partners like Doublade, Infernape, and the aforementioned Volcanion are greatly appreciated. Steel-types such as Scizor and Doublade make good partners, as they help alleviate Mega Aerodactyl's need to check threats such as Celebi and Latias that it can struggle to pivot into, and in return, Mega Aerodactyl can check Fire-types such as Moltres and Infernape. Swampert and Hippowdon can both set up Stealth Rock in order to free up the moveslot from Mega Aerodactyl. Hippowdon also provides sand support, which allows Mega Aerodactyl to switch in more easily versus Latias, Gengar, and Moltres so it can trap and remove the former two with Pursuit and OHKO the latter with Stone Edge. Pivots like Scizor and Hydreigon are fantastic teammates, as they can wear down bulky Water-types and also bring in Mega Aerodactyl safely via U-turn. Fighting-types such as Cobalion, Infernape, and Bewear greatly appreciate Mega Aerodactyl's ability to Pursuit trap Pokemon that generally force them out, such as Latias and Gengar. Mega Aerodactyl can also switch into and check Flying-types like Togekiss and Moltres. In return, Infernape can check Scizor and maintain offensive pressure against the rest of the team. Special wallbreakers, such as Primarina, Latias, and Hydreigon, can weaken opposing bulky teams and give Mega Aerodactyl a better chance at sweeping late-game.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stone Edge and Earthquake provide Mega Aerodactyl with great neutral coverage to threaten out common entry hazard removers like Tentacruel, Rotom-H, and Moltres, allowing it to keep its Stealth Rock up more easily. The combined coverage allows it to reliably revenge kill key threats such as Infernape and Togekiss with super effective damage. Ice Fang allows Aerodactyl to 2HKO Gligar and does more than Stone Edge to the likes of Celebi, Mega Altaria, Latias, and Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>With full Speed investment, Mega Aerodactyl can take advantage of naturally being the fastest Pokemon in the tier to revenge kill other fast threats like Mega Manectric, Mega Beedrill, Choice Scarf Togekiss, and boosted Dragon Dance Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl sets up Stealth Rock most easily when threatening out frailer offensive Pokemon such as Nihilego, Mega Beedrill, and Infernape. It should be played rather aggressively to take advantage of its ability to beat common entry hazard removers, like Tentacruel, Gligar, and Rotom-H. Mega Aerodactyl has decent natural bulk and can be used to pivot into some attacks, such as Moltres's STAB moves. However, it should still try to remain as healthy as possible, as to not succumb to Stealth Rock itself, by not always hard switching in to so it can still check Pokemon like Moltres throughout the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Aerodactyl fits best on offensive builds that would not otherwise be able to fit a Stealth Rock user. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Starmie and Rotom-C is helpful due to the set lacking longevity with Roost. These Pokemon are also able to threaten the bulky Water- and Ground-types that Mega Aerodactyl struggles against like Slowbro, Rhyperior, and Hippowdon. Without Pursuit, Mega Aerodactyl appreciates support from Steel-types such as Scizor, Doublade, and Klefki to deal with Pokemon that it could normally trap like Latias. Klefki stands out as a partner, as it can also set up Spikes to form a hazard-stacking core with Mega Aerodactyl to wear down Pokemon like Primarina. Setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Infernape and Celebi can capitalize on chip damage from Mega Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock, now muscling past Primarina and Scizor, respectively. Scizor itself, Terrakion, and Crawdaunt are all sweepers that function with Mega Aerodactyl as well. Choice Band Swampert appreciates Mega Aerodactyl running Stealth Rock for it. In return, Swampert can break past Mega Aggron and bulky Ground-types like Rhyperior and Palossand. Offensive Rotom-H can get past Mega Steelix and Mega Aggron, in addition to checking Mamoswine and Scizor. Both Rotom-H and Rotom-C can pivot on Hydreigon and Latias for Mega Aerodactyl while threatening Primarina.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Snorlax's incredible bulk paired with solid setup via Curse and recovery in the forms of Recycle + Iapapa Berry and Rest allows it to be a niche setup sweeper in UU. However, Snorlax's extremely lackluster Defense prevents it from sweeping most teams comfortably, as it still gets destroyed by Fighting-type attacks even after boosting once or twice. Taunt users such as Hydreigon beat Snorlax sets with any sort of setup, as without boosts Snorlax has trouble breaking through most Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band and an EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 SpD allows Snorlax to power through would-be switch-ins such as Cobalion and Quagsire. However, this set is mostly outclassed by other wallbreakers such as Choice Band Terrakion, as all that Snorlax has over it is access to Pursuit. Whirlwind lets Snorlax phaze special setup sweepers like Latias and Suicune. Belly Drum allows Snorlax to boost its attack to extreme levels. Normalium Z allows RestTalk Snorlax to switch into Knock Off and Trick users without worry of being crippled by either move but misses out on the passive recovery that Leftovers provides. Running Toxic over Sleep Talk allows Snorlax to beat Unaware Pokemon like Quagsire.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Doublade completely wall Curse / Rest / Sleep Talk Snorlax, as they are immune to its only attack. Jellicent in particular completely shuts down all Snorlax sets thanks to Taunt, and Doublade can bypass potential Defense boosts thanks to Sacred Sword. Other Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Gengar, and Decidueye counter Snorlax depending on which coverage move it runs.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off from foes like Krookodile cripples Iapapa Berry Snorlax, as without the item it has no way to heal.</p> <p><strong>Strong Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Even a slightly chipped Snorlax stands no chance against Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon such as Choice Band Scizor, Cobalion, and Terrakion.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Snorlax gets completely stopped by Taunt users such as Hydreigon and Jellicent, which can prevent it from setting up or healing HP.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Poison</strong>: Once the Recycle + Curse Snorlax has been Toxic poisoned by opposing Pokemon such as Rotom-H, it has no chance to set up later in the game and gets easily worn down by it throughout a game.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Pokemon</strong>: Unaware Pokemon completely wall Snorlax, and Quagsire can even use it to set up with its own Curse or cripple it with Toxic.</p>",

      "Papa Lax (Curse + Recycle)": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse lets Snorlax take hits more easily from physical attackers like Mega Aerodactyl and break past Pokemon like Gligar. Facade allows Snorlax to overpower Pokemon hoping to cripple it with status such as Empoleon and helps it switch into Thunder Wave and Scald more easily thanks to the boost Facade gains when Snorlax is statused. Recycle in conjunction with Gluttony and Iapapa Berry gives Snorlax a reliable way to recover throughout a match. Fire Punch lets Snorlax hit threatening Steel-types such as Scizor and Cobalion on the switch, while Earthquake allows it to hit the majority of Steel-types super effectively while also hitting threatening Pokemon such as Infernape and Chandelure.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Gluttony works well with Recycle, letting Snorlax activate its Iapapa Berry once it gets below 50% HP. The listed EVs allow Snorlax to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Primarina and avoid being OHKOed by Infernape's unboosted Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. It can also tank All-Out Pummeling from Cobalion after a single Curse.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be extremely careful when playing around Toxic users such as Blissey, as once inflicted with Toxic poison, Snorlax has no chance of setting up Curse and gets worn down extremely quickly. Also, when unsure about whether or not the opponent has Toxic, make sure to scout for it. Furthermore, utilize Snorlax as a paralysis and burn absorber to prevent the opponent from playing around it with Toxic and boost Facade simultaneously. Utilize Snorlax's bulk to handle most special attackers such as Nidoking throughout a game and send it in for free setup against walls lacking Toxic. Attack offensive checks such as Cobalion by chipping them down with the appropriate attack as they switch in, as once these are gone, Snorlax has much greater breathing room to set up late-game. Take caution when switching into potential Trick users such as Chandelure, as being locked into a move will render Snorlax useless and prevent it from having any sort of recovery. Take advantage of entry hazards by manipulating them so that Snorlax can activate Iapapa Berry on its switch in. Avoid Knock Off from Pokemon such as Scizor and Krookodile at all cost, as without its Iapapa Berry, Snorlax's ability to set up and check special attackers becomes null. Play around Taunt users such as Hydreigon by switching to an offensive teammate that can handle it efficiently, as Snorlax gets completely shut down by Taunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types like Primarina, Sylveon, and Mega Altaria deal with Fighting- and Dark-type Pokemon that beat Snorlax with Fighting-type STAB moves and Knock Off, respectively. Clerics such as Sylveon and Togekiss are important teammates for this Snorlax set because if Snorlax gets inflicted with Toxic poison, it's nearly useless. Pokemon such as Refresh Mega Altaria, which can sponge status, can help mitigate Snorlax's weakness to Toxic. It can also provide a Knock Off switch-in. Magneton can trap threatening Steel-types like Scizor for Snorlax. Having a Knock Off switch-in is vital for this set, so Pokemon such as Cobalion can turn out to be great teammates. Toxic support from Pokemon such as Tentacruel is extremely helpful for wearing down threatening Taunt users such as Jellicent. Hazard removers like Tentacruel and Rotom-H are helpful, since they can remove hazards that chip Snorlax quickly.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Curse is Snorlax's reliable form of setup, boosting its Attack and Defense stats simultaneously. Return is Snorlax's strongest, most spammable attack, trading Body Slam's chance of paralysis for a higher damage output. Rest gives Snorlax a reliable form of recovery and allows it to set up multiple times a game. Sleep Talk lets Snorlax set up against foes while asleep. Fire Punch allows Snorlax to chip threatening Steel-types such as Scizor on the switch, and Earthquake hits the same few targets but misses out on hitting Scizor. Earthquake also hits most Steel-types like Doublade and Cobalion harder than Fire Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers gives Snorlax another way to heal throughout a match. Thick Fat lets Snorlax switch into opposing Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Pokemon such as Moltres, Nidoking, and Kyurem. The listed EVs allow Snorlax to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Primarina and avoid being OHKOed by Infernape's unboosted Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. It can also tank All-Out Pummeling from Cobalion after a single Curse.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Utilize Snorlax's immense special bulk to switch in and set up on special attackers such as Nidoking and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Also capitalize on Snorlax's ability to beat passive Pokemon such as Blissey one-on-one by setting up on them. Make sure to weaken offensive checks lacking recovery such as Infernape by chipping them down with a STAB move as they switch in. If you are running Body Slam, try fishing for paralysis against offensive switch-ins such as Terrakion. Utilize Snorlax's ability to absorb all status for teammates by switching it into status users such as Empoleon and Rotom-H. Don't try to set up with Snorlax early-game. Instead, use it as a bulky pivot that can absorb status until most of the counterplay your opponent has to it has been properly taken care of. Don't stay in against Taunt Pokemon such as Jellicent. Instead, use the opportunity to offensively pressure your opponent's team by switching to a teammate that threatens it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trappers such as Krookodile are great teammates for Snorlax sets that opt for Sleep Talk over coverage, as they can trap Ghost-types that Snorlax can't hit. It's also very important to be able to hit Steel-types if you opt to run Sleep Talk, so teammates such as Cobalion and Infernape fit nicely on teams running this set. Pokemon like Tentacruel and Latias that can beat the Fighting-types that Snorlax fears are helpful teammates. The former can also help remove entry hazards that Snorlax is susceptible to. Clerics such as Sylveon are great teammates, as they can wake Snorlax with Heal Bell, giving it more room to play freely instead of relying on Sleep Talk to pick the desired move. Toxic Spikes Pokemon such as Tentacruel can prove to be great teammates, wearing down checks and counters such as Quagsire with poison.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Articuno's ability to compress roles as both a Defog user and a Heal Bell user allows it to carve a niche on stall teams as a specially bulky support Pokemon, capable of removing entry hazards against Pokemon like Hippowdon, Empoleon, and Nidoking. Pressure is also one of Articuno's most useful traits, allowing it to stall out moves like Stealth Rock and Toxic, making it hard for the opponent to spread residual damage around the team, which any bulky build would appreciate. On top of this, Articuno is able to sponge hits from very strong special attackers like Hydreigon, Mega Blastoise, and Nidoking thanks to its incredibly high Special Defense stat and overall bulk. Articuno also possesses a decent Speed tier for a bulky Pokemon, which gives it the opportunity to outspeed and potentially remove Pokemon like Crawdaunt and Primarina with the right EV investment. Despite this, Articuno's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock makes it hard for it to come into play all the time and perform its role, meaning it mandates a lot more team support than most other Pokemon. Its subpar defensive typing also holds it back, providing it with only two resistances and an immunity to Ground-type attacks, aggravating its difficulty to come into play and making it weak to common offensive threats like Scizor, Mega Aerodactyl, and Cobalion. Furthermore, Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Nihilego can easily set up Stealth Rock and prevent Articuno from coming in and using Defog as well. Although Articuno is able to compress roles by running both Defog and Heal Bell on its set, it still faces heavy competition as a Defogger from Pokemon like Moltres, which has a much better defensive typing and consequently a relatively easier time finding an opportunity to Defog. Its passive nature can also provide free turns for certain setup sweepers that are particularly threatening to defensive builds like Terrakion and Infernape.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>There are no other viable options available.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock deals a lot of damage to Articuno, making it lose half of its maximum health upon switching in, which severely limits its opportunities to come into play.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Pokemon like Terrakion, Mega Aerodactyl, and Nihilego can easily OHKO Articuno with their Rock-type STAB moves. Terrakion can set up on it with relative ease, while Nihilego is able to use the free turns to set up hazards, as it doesn't take much from Articuno's attacks. Mega Aerodactyl, however, has trouble directly switching into a potential Freeze-Dry.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Offensive Steel-types like Scizor, Cobalion, and Lucario can easily tank Articuno's attacks and use it as setup fodder, while Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Stakataka also take little to no damage from Freeze-Dry and are able set up Stealth Rock without any drawbacks.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Mamoswine and Heracross can power through Articuno with ease with their strong hits due to its lack of Defense investment.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Pokemon like Infernape, Moltres, and Rotom-H can threaten Articuno with their STAB moves while not taking any notable damage from Freeze-Dry. In addition, both Infernape and Moltres can also freely set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Zeraora are big threats to Articuno, as they can hit it very hard with their Electric-type attacks.

Heal Bell provides Articuno with the ability to heal itself and the rest of the team from any status condition. It also eases the matchup against defensive hazard setters that rely on status moves to threaten Articuno. Freeze-Dry hits Water-types like Tentacruel and Primarina super effectively and notably hits Empoleon for neutral damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed investment allows Articuno to outspeed Jolly Crawdaunt, and the 4 Defense EVs in conjunction with the HP investment allow it to survive a Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch from Scizor at maximum HP. If outspeeding Crawdaunt is not desirable, it's acceptable to fully invest in Special Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In order to utilize Articuno effectively, it's advised to switch into entry hazard setters like Hippowdon, Empoleon, and Nidoqueen as often as possible to Defog their hazards away. Articuno will come out on top most of the time, as it can PP stall their moves with Pressure, preventing the former two from being able to pressure it with Toxic. However, this comes at the cost of Articuno having to expense all of its Heal Bell PP to Pressure stall Toxic, which can leave it susceptible to status from other users, so Heal Bell should be used conservatively where possible. However, Articuno shouldn't be switching in when Stealth Rock is already up, as it will take a lot of damage. Instead, it's best to use a different Pokemon like Gligar to remove it first, if feasible. It's also encouraged to take advantage of Pressure and switch into moves like Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Defog as often as possible in order to stall out their PP and consequently make it harder for the opponent to continually damage the team. Roost should be used proactively, as keeping Articuno as healthy as possible is extremely important, in case it's forced to come into play while Stealth Rock is up. Due to its high Special Defense stat, Articuno can also be used to sponge special attacks from Pokemon like Primarina and Starmie if necessary. Be aware of and scout for coverage moves such as Krookodile's Stone Edge that could be aimed at Articuno, as they could either OHKO it or leave it at a very low amount of HP. Watch out for Heal Bell's PP, since it can run out very quickly, and defensive teams heavily rely on cleric support in order to succeed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Articuno fits best on stall teams that appreciate its ability to compress roles as a cleric and a Defogger and shouldn't be used outside of those types of teams due to the specific amount of support it requires. Additional forms of entry hazard removal are a must-have whenever using Articuno, as it often can't keep repeatedly removing hazards by itself due to its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock and the number of entry hazard setters that match up well against it. Pokemon like Gligar can provide such support. Pokemon that can sponge Rock-type attacks aimed at Articuno like Alomomola, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Aggron pair well with Articuno. The examples given also benefit from Articuno's Heal Bell support. Steel-type checks such as Quagsire, Pyukumuku, and the aforementioned Alomomola also make good partners, as Pokemon like Scizor and Cobalion can prove to be a big nuisance to Articuno. Rocky Helmet Alomomola can also help punish Scizor, which Articuno is vulnerable to giving up momentum to. Wish support from Pokemon like Blissey and Alomomola can be very useful, allowing Articuno to switch into special attackers more easily. It's also useful to minimize any hazard damage that Articuno is forced to take. Blissey is also a fantastic partner, as it has access to Natural Cure, which allows it to pivot into common status users such as Empoleon and as a result lets Articuno conserve its limited number of Heal Bell PP. Bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Mega Slowbro share good synergy with Articuno, as they match up well against most of its checks, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Infernape, and Terrakion. In return, Articuno can keep Grass-types like Amoonguss in check and provide Heal Bell support. Electric-immune Pokemon such as Gligar and specially defensive walls like Blissey also pair well with Articuno, as Pokemon like Zeraora and Mega Manectric can threaten it a lot. Mega Aerodactyl makes a great partner for Articuno, as it can alleviate its weakeness to giving threats such as Infernape too many setup opportunities and easily revenge kill them. Mega Aerodactyl can also deal with the aforementioned Electric-types that threaten Articuno and provide Pursuit support to deal with problematic threats such as Latias and Celebi that have the ability to break past Articuno. In return, Mega Aerodactyl appreciates Articuno's ability to keep Stealth Rock off the field and provide it with Heal Bell support.</p>"

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>Moltres fits incredibly well in the tier and has the ability to fulfill roles nothing else can. Moltres's stats are solid by UU standards, and its typing is a mixed blessing: Fire / Flying provides fantastic offensive coverage, resistances to important types, such as Bug, Steel, Fighting, and Fire, and an immunity to Ground-type moves. However, Moltres is weak to Water-, Electric- and Rock-type moves, with the latter also bringing a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, which is a significant inconvenience but is manageable thanks to the good availability of Defog users. Moltres's abilities also are rather niche, its movepool is somewhat limited, and it can be very one-dimensional and predictable, but despite this, it has all the tools it needs to be a major threat in the UU tier.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Solar Beam-based Bloom Doom OHKOes Water-type Pokemon such as Primarina and Swampert more reliably, but Moltres only needs minimal chip before being able to KO them with Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Entry hazard control is easy to come by, but Moltres constantly needs it, or switching in at all becomes a struggle.</p> <p><strong>Sturdy Special Walls</strong>: Moltres simply cannot break through most special walls and at best it can chip them down slowly with U-turn. Blissey in particular is troublesome, as it's not even bothered by Toxic; however, defensive Moltres doesn't outright lose because it makes Blissey waste PP without risking much and can easily stick around.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types usually resist both STAB attacks and can easily OHKO Moltres. Nihilego takes minimal damage from anything Moltres has thanks to its massive special bulk and cannot be poisoned by defensive sets, which allows it to freely set up entry hazards. Mega Aerodactyl is bulky enough to Roost off the damage done most of the time and can easily KO Moltres with Stone Edge, but it must be wary of Supersonic Skystrike, as it takes away over half of its HP.</p> <p><strong>Latias</strong>: Latias's natural bulk and Speed are enough to check Moltres, because Hurricane is not strong nor reliable enough to stop it from stalling it off with Roost, unless confusion is involved. However, Supersonic Skystrike can KO after Stealth Rock damage, so Latias is forced to be at maximum health to be able to safely check Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Raikou, and Hydreigon struggle to switch directly into Moltres, but once they are in, they can easily revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic puts defensive Moltres on a timer, but it can play around it with Roost, Heal Bell, or Wish support, and in lengthy games, Moltres will outlast and PP stall Toxic users. Thunder Wave from Klefki, one of the Pokemon Moltres tries to take advantage of the most, is a major annoyance for offensive Moltres, as it heavily cripples it and makes Moltres much more susceptible to getting revenge killed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane isn't the most reliable STAB attack due to its 70% accuracy, but almost nothing switches into it for free, and it comes with a 30% confusion chance. Flyinium Z lessens the problems with Hurricane's unreliability and grants Moltres an extremely strong nuke. Fire Blast is a more reliable STAB attack in terms of accuracy and is just as strong. Only Rock-type Pokemon resist both STAB attacks. Roost is used for additional longevity, as Moltres can easily find opportunities to recover off damage thanks to its offensive presence, typing, and natural bulk. U-turn chips down checks and counters and allow Moltres's team to gain momentum. Moltres can run Defog and function as a secondary offensive Defogger for your team. as it heavily threatens most Stealth Rock users and Klefki. Agility can be used to turn Moltres into a late-game cleaner.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs are used to maximize Moltres's power. 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature are used to maximize its Speed. The 4 EVs can go into either defensive stat but should not be put into HP to avoid having an even HP number and taking additional damage from Stealth Rock. Flame Body allows Moltres to be one of the biggest deterrents to Scizor by just being healthy, as it cannot even go for U-turn for free without risking a burn and does minimal damage to Moltres with any of its common moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is good against most playstyles, but it does struggle breaking through the sturdiest specially defensive walls, automatically making offensive Moltres weak against stall. Moltres should be using its typing to take advantage of common Pokemon such as Scizor and Cobalion to find opportunities to fire off its STAB attacks, gain momentum with U-turn, or use its support moves. Soften Moltres's checks with its high-powered STAB attacks or U-turn, and wait for the perfect moment to nuke them with Supersonic Skystrike. Note that most offensive checks to Moltres can only switch in once before being in Supersonic Skystrike's range. Alternatively, throw out Moltres's Z-Move early on to weaken potential switch-ins or to get a surprise KO against bulky Pokemon trying to tank its unboosted STAB attacks. If Agility is being used, you must wait until Moltres's offensive checks, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Manectric, are low enough to be able to clean up.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>A dedicated Defog user or, at the very least, a secondary Defog user, such as Latias or Mega Altaria, is a must to let Moltres function properly. Spinners such as Mega Blastoise and Tentacruel can also provide entry hazard control for Moltres, but they aren't the most reliable way of making sure Stealth Rock isn't up. Moltres can form a strong, albeit unorthodox, VoltTurn or even multi-U-turn core with Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Scizor, and Hydreigon. Wallbreakers, such as Terrakion and Primarina, can be used to punish the defensive teams that trouble Moltres, and they can get in for free thanks to U-turn. Just like every offensive Pokemon, Moltres appreciates having hazard support to become an even bigger threat, which makes Stealth Rock users in general good teammates. However, Moltres has awkward synergy with Spikes, as it's hard to set them up while preventing Stealth Rock from going up on your side of the field, and Moltres heavily relies on Defog support most of the time.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog is used to remove entry hazards, which Moltres has plenty of chances to do thanks to its good overall bulk and typing and its ability to directly switch into common setters such as Hippowdon, Klefki, and Mega Aggron with very little risk. Alternatively, Substitute can be used with Toxic on teams that already have hazard removal, as it can allow Moltres to gain free turns on threats like Tsareena and Scizor to begin Toxic stalling. Toxic is used to slowly wear down the opponent's team and to chip down Pokemon that tend to switch into Moltres; additionally, it has great synergy with Flamethrower's ability to threaten Steel-types, which are immune to Toxic. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple physical attackers and wear down non-Fire-type Pokemon, but this leaves Moltres completely open to Pokemon of that type. Roar forces out setup sweepers and racks up hazard damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>224 EVs in Speed with a Timid nature are used to outspeed base 86 Speed Pokemon and lower, which includes important threats such as Rotom-C, Heracross, and Mamoswine. Pressure is one of the most important perks of this set, as it allows Moltres to PP stall, especially Stealth Rock and Spikes. This ability is one of the main reasons to use Moltres in stall, as it gives your team an edge over opposing defensive teams from turn 1.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is specialized to be used in stall, paired with at least one other Defog user. It's not recommended to use this set outside of defensive teams. Moltres can and should switch in directly against certain entry hazard setters like Mega Aggron and Klefki, as they can't directly threaten it or keep hazards up, and they'll run out of PP long before Moltres does if it comes down to that. Use Pressure to burn PP from the foe's team, the earlier the better. In any match that has the potential to be relatively lengthy, Moltres should be switching into weak moves, status moves, and especially Stealth Rock and Defog as much as possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Moltres should be run alongside another Defog user, such as Mega Altaria, Empoleon, or Togekiss. Mega Altaria and Togekiss easily Defog against Pokemon Moltres struggles against, such as Swampert, and Moltres reciprocates by shutting down Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Cobalion. As this set is meant to be used on stall teams, standard stall staples such as Blissey, Quagsire, and Alomomola will always be run alongside it. Blissey and Quagsire shut down all Electric-type Pokemon in the tier, while Moltres deals with most Fighting- and Grass-type moves aimed at them. Most combinations of Alomomola, Quagsire, Gligar, and Mega Altaria cover every Rock-type capable of KOing Moltres. Water-types are easily handled by Blissey and Alomomola.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is an incredibly strong STAB move that hits most of the tier for neutral damage. In addition to this, Hurricane also threatens the tier's many Fighting- and Grass-types, allowing Moltres to be an offensive check to Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Infernape, and Heracross. Fire Blast is Moltres's secondary STAB move of choice, and it synergizes well offensively with Hurricane due to its ability to threaten Steel-types that would otherwise switch in safely to Hurricane. Flamethrower has perfect accuracy, meaning that Moltres can use it with few drawbacks and without relying on Fire Blast's shaky accuracy. However, this comes at the cost of not achieving key 2HKOs, such as Empoleon and Alolan Muk after Stealth Rock. Air Slash is used to give Moltres a Flying-type attack with next to no drawbacks, which can come in handy when it needs to go for a consistent, spammable attack. Like Flamethrower, however, this misses out on important 2HKOs achieved with Hurricane, such as against Sylveon, Tentacruel, and Mantine. U-turn allows Moltres to pivot out on its best switch-ins, such as Nihilego, Mega Aerodactyl, and Blissey, and keep up momentum for its team while its checks are still around. Sleep Talk makes Moltres a usable sleep absorber for its team, meaning that it can switch into Amoonguss's Spore without being entirely crippled. Hidden Power Grass is a coverage option that gives Moltres the ability to OHKO Swampert as well as severely dent Rhyperior, but it has low Base Power and is only useful for those Pokemon, making it easy to punish.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Moltres to hit as fast and as hard as possible. Choice Specs multiplies Moltres's Special Attack by 1.5, making it extremely powerful, and it is a very effective user of the item due to its high Special Attack and the fantastic offensive coverage of its STAB attacks. A Timid nature is used because base 90 is a key Speed tier, putting Moltres above Togekiss, Chandelure, Mega Altaria, and Heracross. Flame Body is chosen as Moltres's ability over Pressure because Flame Body's 30% burn chance is a very powerful tool to punish physical attackers, such as Scizor and Cobalion. The lack of bulk investment or recovery also means Moltres cannot PP stall with Pressure very effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Make sure that Stealth Rock is off the field whenever possible, as Moltres's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock means it can only switch in twice while Stealth Rock is up before being KOed, while switching in even once means it will often fold to attacks it could otherwise take, such as +2 Close Combat from Cobalion and +2 Bullet Punch from Scizor. With Stealth Rock off the field, you can capitalize on Moltres's defensive utility by switching into attacks from foes such as Scizor and Cobalion and fishing for burns with Flame Body. Don't switch in too liberally, though, as even without Stealth Rock on the field, this set can get worn down quite quickly due to its lack of recovery. Choice Specs Moltres is best used as an early-game wallbreaker to set the stage for its teammates. It can frequently find opportunities to attack versus other wallbreakers, since it is faster than many of them, as well as against passive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Amoonguss. This gives it a stellar matchup versus balance and bulky offense. Be selective with the use of Hurricane and Fire Blast, as their low accuracy can prove extremely punishing, and there are many scenarios in which going for Flamethrower or Air Slash will do sufficient damage without the risk of missing. If carrying U-turn, use it to pivot out on switch-ins such as Nihilego and Mega Aerodactyl to prevent giving them free turns, or being Pursuit trapped in the case of the latter.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Reliable entry hazard removal is an absolute must when using Moltres. Empoleon is an effective Defogger whose stellar defensive typing also allows it to come in on many Pokemon that force Moltres out, such as Latias and Primarina. Silvally-Steel is an alternative Steel-type Defogger that has the ability to pivot out with Parting Shot and bring Moltres in for free. Other examples of Pokemon that can support Moltres with their pivoting ability include Scizor, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Mega Manectric, all of which are capable of baiting in Pokemon that are threatened by Moltres such as Cobalion, Hippowdon, and Amoonguss. Many of the tier's Stealth Rock setters have great synergy with Moltres, as they tend to struggle against Fighting-types and appreciate Moltres's ability to check Pokemon such as Cobalion. Such Pokemon include Nihilego, Empoleon, and Rhyperior. In return, the Stealth Rock support these Pokemon provide is crucial for putting foes in KO range of Moltres's attacks. These Pokemon also can form a very effective defensive backbone with Alomomola and Sylveon, which can very capably support Moltres with Wish and mitigate its susceptibility to chip damage. Mega Altaria, whether physical or special, greatly appreciates Moltres keeping Steel-types in check: bulky special variants can better support it with Defog, while Dragon Dance variants are able to set up much more freely with the likes of Scizor and Amoonguss eliminated. Mega Altaria's defensive typing also allows it to support Moltres by taking on dangerous Water- and Dragon-types that can check Moltres offensively. Sweepers such as Trick Room Stakataka and Mega Sharpedo do an excellent job capitalizing off of Moltres's wallbreaking ability, as they appreciate bulky Pokemon such as Cobalion and Hippowdon being weakened or eliminated. Revenge killers such as Scizor and Choice Scarf Krookodile are very useful for keeping faster offensive threats at bay that would otherwise harass Moltres, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Terrakion. Checks to Mega Manectric such as Hippowdon, Latias, and Choice Scarf Krookodile are necessary to prevent it from gaining momentum versus Moltres with impunity, and for this reason they are right at home on the bulky offense and balance teams that best utilize Moltres.</p>"

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>Mew's niche in the UU tier stems from its diverse movepool and well-rounded stats, which allow it to fulfill the role of a stallbreaker or provide utility to its team in the form of Stealth Rock and Defog support. Mew's ability to outspeed most defensive Pokemon grants it multiple opportunities to get off a fast Taunt to limit bulkier Pokemon like Hippowdon, Pyukumuku, and Blissey from using their recovery moves or prevent Pokemon like Empoleon and Gligar from setting or removing entry hazards. Access to the combination of Seismic Toss and Taunt also allows Mew to beat almost every entry hazard user in the tier, including the likes of Empoleon, Rhyperior, and Mega Aggron, something very few Pokemon can claim. However, Mew is let down by its pure Psychic typing, which leaves it unable to effectively check a majority of offensive threats the UU tier has to offer, including staples such as Scizor, Bisharp, and Mega Sharpedo. This is worsened by its inability to carry coverage options outside of Seismic Toss and Knock Off effectively, making Mew extremely passive and easily exploited by threats like Infernape, Gengar, Facade Mega Altaria, and Hydreigon, the first of which it would be able to check with STAB coverage if its role permitted it. Mew is also susceptible to status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave, which hinders it in its role as a stallbreaker and is especially troublesome for a Defog user, as its typing leaves it vulnerable to being worn down by every entry hazard. Mew struggles to deal with common threats like Hydreigon, Calm Mind Latias, and Celebi, as it is unable to punish them outside of Seismic Toss or status moves like Will-O-Wisp and Toxic, thus allowing the latter two to use Mew as a setup opportunity in most cases. Celebi in particular is able to shrug off all of Mew's responses through means like Recover, Giga Drain, and Natural Cure. Mew is also unable to run an offensive set, facing competition against other offensive Psychic-types such as Latias and Celebi, the latter of which, while sharing the same stat distribution, has a secondary typing to break through bulkier teams, unlike Mew.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive set with Nasty Plot can be run to act as a late-game sweeper, with moves like Focus Blast and Fire Blast to break through Steel-types and Taunt to break apart stall teams offensively; however, Mew has severe four-moveslot syndrome, making it difficult for it to find an ideal combination of moves that doesn't leave it walled against common threats. Mew also faces a lot of competition with Celebi as a Nasty Plot user, whose secondary STAB typing and less situational ability in Natural Cure provide it with a better matchup against defensive builds. Alternative move options like Flamethrower and Ice Beam can be used on the above sets over Knock Off or Seismic Toss. Flamethrower allows Mew to remove the likes of Cobalion and Scizor more effectively, while Ice Beam can pressure Mega Altaria, Krookodile, Gligar, and Hydreigon. However, Mew struggles to weaken and break through bulkier Pokemon like Blissey and Quagsire as a result. U-turn is an option to generate momentum off of Mew's common switch-ins such as Latias, Celebi, and Gengar, but Mew struggles to fit this move on its sets. A more defensive EV spread can be run on utility sets to pivot into offensive threats like Nidoqueen, Terrakion, and Mamoswine more effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Bisharp and Krookodile give Mew a lot of trouble; however, they do have to be careful about being crippled by Will-O-Wisp. Hydreigon is another Dark-type that Mew has a very hard time dealing with, as it can shrug off a burn and isn't fazed by any of the coverage moves Mew can afford to carry thanks to its access to Roost. Mega Sharpedo is also able to OHKO Mew with Crunch, and due to its ability to accumulate a free Speed Boost with Protect, it can avoid being burned by Will-O-Wisp in the process.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Gengar, Mimikyu, and Doublade can easily use Mew as a free chance to set up, but the latter two can be punished by a burn. Sets lacking Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off leave Mew walled by them, which makes them extremely problematic to deal with. Gengar in particular is faster and can OHKO Mew with Never-Ending Nightmare. Chandelure can also take advantage of Mew, as Will-O-Wisp can give it a Flash Fire boost, and it can also set up a Substitute or Calm Mind for free against Seismic Toss sets.</p> <p><strong>Strong Offensive Threats</strong>: Powerful threats such as Mega Altaria, Terrakion, and Infernape can give Mew a lot of issues. Mew is extremely reliant on Will-O-Wisp to be able to combat the former two, but Terrakion is faster and can OHKO it with a +2 Continental Crush or 2HKO it with a Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge on the switch, while Mega Altaria can carry Facade to 2HKO Mew after being burned. Infernape simply uses Mew as a free wallbreaking opportunity, as it cannot be burned and does not care about Mew's low damage output.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Users</strong>: Toxic prevents Mew from consistently breaking through Pokemon such as Quagsire and Blissey because it forces Mew to switch out, which gives multiple opportunities for them to recover any lost health once Taunt wears off. The combination of switching into entry hazards and Toxic also greatly hinders Mew's longevity as a Defog user.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seismic Toss is a consistent source of damage that lets Mew break through Pokemon like Mega Steelix, Empoleon, and Quagsire reliably as well as beat strong offensive threats such as Substitute Kyurem and non-Choice Scarf Krookodile. Alternatively, Knock Off provides good utility by removing key items from users like Empoleon, Nidoking, Blissey, and Gligar. It also makes Mew less passive against Ghost-types like Gengar and Chandelure, preventing them from freely setting up a Substitute against it; however, forgoing Seismic Toss leaves Mew unable to break past sturdier walls such as Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix. Taunt is essential for shutting down bulky Pokemon like Pyukumuku, Blissey, Gligar, and Mega Aggron by preventing them from using recovery, setting or removing entry hazards, or retaliating with status moves such as Toxic. Taunt is also useful to prevent slower offensive Pokemon like Nasty Plot Lucario and Substitute Kyurem from taking advantage of Mew's passivity by setting up. Will-O-Wisp allows Mew to burn physical threats such as Cobalion, Krookodile, and Terrakion, allowing it to pivot into them safely at a later point and eventually beat them if utilizing Seismic Toss. Toxic can be used as an alternative status move that lets Mew cripple foes like Latias, Hydreigon, and Mega Slowbro that otherwise use Mew as an opportunity to wallbreak or set up. However, it can be difficult to forgo Will-O-Wisp, as it leaves Mew unable to cripple physical attackers, some of which it cannot threaten out with just Seismic Toss or Knock Off. Soft-Boiled provides Mew with a form of reliable recovery to let it keep pivoting into offensive and defensive threats alike such as Cobalion and Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Mew to outpace foes like Kyurem, Mimikyu, and non-Choice Scarf Krookodile in order to cripple them with a status ailment or potentially remove their item with Knock Off. Leftovers provides Mew with a form of passive recovery to switch into Pokemon like Tentacruel and Mega Aggron consistently. Colbur Berry can be used over Leftovers to give Mew a safer opportunity to cripple the likes of Krookodile, Mega Sharpedo, and Hydreigon with Will-O-Wisp or, if running Toxic, put the latter on a timer. Synchronize allows Mew to punish status users like Rotom-H, Hippowdon, and Alomomola that attempt to beat it with Toxic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mew should primarily focus on switching into bulkier foes like Blissey, Pyukumuku, Amoonguss, and Mega Aggron that can't threaten it offensively in order to beat them with the combination of Taunt and Seismic Toss; however, it must be wary of status moves such as Toxic. This combination also allows Mew to avoid being setup bait against foes like Calm Mind Mega Slowbro and Suicune and beat them one-on-one; however, Mew must switch into them immediately, as it will struggle to beat them if they have already accumulated multiple boosts. Taunt should also be used to prevent the removal or setup of entry hazards by common users like Hippowdon, Rotom-H, and Swampert. Knock Off provides Mew with the ability to remove items from offensive Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Nidoking; if running this move, Mew shouldn't be afraid to stay in and potentially remove their Life Orb. Against bulkier foes like Empoleon, Suicune, and Gligar, removing their items can be key, as the former two are reliant on Leftovers as their only form of recovery, while Gligar needs its Eviolite to check the foes it wants to. Mew should be careful when using Knock Off as its primary move, however, as unlike Seismic Toss, it could give foes such as Lucario, Cobalion, and Terrakion a Justified boost if it's spammed, which is very problematic if Mew lacks Will-O-Wisp. Mew can attempt to soft check threats like Cobalion and Mega Aerodactyl by weakening them with Will-O-Wisp and safely recovering any lost health the following turn. Mew can also use Will-O-Wisp to beat Stealth Rock Krookodile at the expense of its Leftovers; however, without Colbur Berry, it struggles to deal with Choice Scarf variants of Krookodile, which can revenge kill Mew with Knock Off or Crunch. Mew should be wary of spamming its status moves too much, as that can boost Mega Altaria's Facade, which allows it to break past Mew without a Dragon Dance boost. If Mew is carrying Toxic, it should prioritize crippling the likes of Hydreigon and Kyurem; however, it should attempt to hit the former on the switch, as it threatens to 2HKO Mew with Dark Pulse otherwise. While Synchronize can give Mew ways to punish status users, it should be careful to avoid Toxic and Thunder Wave nonetheless. Toxic severely hinders its ability to beat the aforementioned bulkier Pokemon with Taunt because Mew will eventually be forced to switch out, which creates opportunities for them to recover any lost health once Taunt wears off. Likewise, being crippled by Thunder Wave is detrimental, as Mew is reliant on its ability to outspeed Pokemon like Suicune, Mamoswine, and Stealth Rock Krookodile in order to beat them. When running Seismic Toss, Mew must be exceptionally careful not to give Ghost-types like Gengar and Chandelure too many free opportunities to set up a Substitute, as it gives them an easier time to wallbreak, so against foes like these, it is best to double switch in order to not give up momentum. Other Ghost-types like Mimikyu can be punished with Will-O-Wisp, though Mew still is left unable to break its Disguise if lacking Knock Off, which gives Mimikyu the potential to set up multiple Swords Dance boosts to cancel out the effect of the burn regardless.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mew fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate the stallbreaking and defensive capabilities it can provide. Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Togekiss make for great partners for Mew, as they can check Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Krookodile and provide strong wallbreaking capabilities that can support Mew in pressuring bulkier teams. Mega Altaria's access to Refresh also allows it to absorb status moves such as Toxic for Mew, while Togekiss has access to Heal Bell to cure Mew of status ailments. Entry hazard setters like Rhyperior, Nidoqueen, and Cobalion appreciate Mew's ability to keep their hazards up with Taunt. Cobalion in particular appreciates Mew pressuring bulkier foes like Quagsire, Gligar, and Pyukumuku that it struggles to break, and in return, it can check Hydreigon and Scizor for Mew. Nidoqueen also has the added benefit of being able to set up Toxic Spikes, which helps Mew break through bulkier Pokemon like Blissey in tandem with Taunt. Pokemon that struggle to break through bulky Pokemon like Hippowdon, Blissey, and Mega Aggron appreciate Mew's ability to cripple and beat them, so Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, and Primarina pair well with Mew. Empoleon, Tentacruel, Moltres, and Rotom-H can help Mew by removing entry hazards like Toxic Spikes, which Mew is susceptible to. Tentacruel also appreciates Mew keeping its Toxic Spikes up, while the latter two enjoy Mew preventing Stealth Rock from being set up easily. Strong wallbreakers like Terrakion and Infernape take pressure off Mew having to break through stall teams and make up for its lack of an offensive presence. In return, both appreciate Mew's ability to weaken their checks in defensive Mega Altaria, Gligar, and Alomomola. Mew's passivity can be exploited by common setup sweepers in Celebi and Latias, while Ghost-types like Gengar and Chandelure can also freely set up a Substitute if Mew lacks Knock Off, so Pursuit users like Choice Band Scizor and Choice Scarf Krookodile are great partners to trap and remove them. Steel-types like Mega Steelix, Mega Aggron, and Klefki can handle the likes of Latias, Mega Sharpedo, and Mega Altaria that Mew has issues checking. All of these Steel-types also appreciate Mew's ability to keep their entry hazards up and deal with bulky setup users such as Mega Slowbro and Suicune that they invite in. Partners that can make up for Mew's rather mediocre Speed stat like Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf users in Hydreigon and Krookodile can help deal with threats such as Celebi and Latias that Mew is otherwise unable to threaten.</p>"

      "Defensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Seismic Toss gives Mew a consistent way to whittle down bulkier foes that it otherwise struggles to chip down effectively such as Empoleon and Mega Aggron. Knock Off is an alternative option that lets Mew cripple Pokemon like Rhyperior, Gligar, and Tentacruel that are reliant on their items. Mew is a great user of Defog, as it is capable of beating a vast majority of the tier's entry hazard setters like Hippowdon, Mega Aggron, and Empoleon. Stealth Rock is an alternative option if no other teammate has the move, as in conjunction with Taunt, Mew has an easy time keeping its entry hazard up against most of the tier's Defog users such as Empoleon and Gligar. Taunt also allows Mew to prevent bulkier Pokemon like Hippowdon and Blissey from using their recovery moves to keep them chipped down for its teammates, as well as stop them from setting up their own entry hazards. Taunt is also important for preventing some sweepers like Mega Altaria, Lucario, and Togekiss from using Mew as a free setup opportunity due to its inability to threaten them. Soft-Boiled provides Mew with reliable recovery to let it keep switching in to remove or set entry hazards.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>176 Speed EVs allow Mew to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon and below such as Lucario, Mega Altaria, and Nidoking, which prevents the latter two from using it as setup fodder when using Knock Off and, in the case of the last, lets Mew remove the Life Orb it is so reliant on. Maximum HP investment makes Mew as bulky as possible, and the rest of the EVs are placed in Defense for additional bulk. Leftovers provides Mew with a passive form of recovery, allowing it to mitigate chip damage taken from entry hazards. Synchronize allows Mew to punish common status users in Swampert, Rotom-H, and Quagsire. Alternatively, a spread with 196 Speed EVs can be used to outpace Kyurem to prevent it from freely setting a Substitute against Mew and remove it with Seismic Toss once it's weakened.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mew should focus on setting or removing entry hazards due to its great matchup against common users of Stealth Rock and Defog, being able to switch into foes like Empoleon and Hippowdon and use Taunt to keep its own entry hazards up reliably or keep opposing ones off the field. When using Seismic Toss, Mew is also capable of beating these Pokemon one-on-one. Taunt is also a great utility tool to stop bulkier foes like Blissey and Pyukumuku from using their recovery moves and completely shut down the latter. Aggressively pivoting Mew into other entry hazard users like Tentacruel and Empoleon is an option to potentially reflect a Scald burn against them with Synchronize so that Mew can whittle them down more easily. However, Mew must be careful of losing its item to Knock Off or potentially being crippled by Toxic from Empoleon on the switch, so unless a teammate has Heal Bell, Mew might need to find another opportunity later to remove their entry hazards. Mew shouldn't attempt to check the tier's many Fighting-types, as its lack of a status move to cripple Cobalion and Terrakion leaves it as setup bait for them, especially if it's carrying Knock Off, which can give them a Justified boost. Infernape is another problematic Fighting-type, as it also has access to Slack Off to recover any health lost to Mew's Seismic Toss and can use Mew as setup fodder. Mew struggles to deal with offensive Stealth Rock users in Krookodile and Cobalion, as the former is capable of 2HKOing it, while the latter can set up a Swords Dance boost to break past Mew and force it out with relative ease, allowing them both to keep their entry hazards up against it. In this scenario, it is best for Mew to whittle them down with Seismic Toss as they switch in or double switch to a partner capable of removing them and find an opportunity to use Defog later. If Mew has already set up or removed entry hazards, prioritize using Knock Off on the switches it can force to cripple pivots like Empoleon and Suicune that are dependent on their items for passive recovery. Mew also struggles to deal with most Dark- and Ghost-types. Hydreigon in particular is capable of shrugging off everything Mew can throw at it and can reliably remove Mew's entry hazards with Defog, while others like Krookodile and Bisharp can proceed to Pursuit trap it. Similarly, foes like Gengar, Doublade, and Mimikyu are able to simply wall Mew if it lacks Knock Off and set up a Substitute or Swords Dance. Therefore, when facing foes like these, Mew should consider prioritizing double switching instead of using Stealth Rock or Defog, especially against these Ghost-types, in order to not give up momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mew fits best on bulky offensive and balanced teams that appreciate its ability to beat common entry hazard users and compress the ability to both set and remove entry hazards depending on the role it needs to fulfill. Pokemon capable of checking Dark-types like Hydreigon and Krookodile make for essential partners for Mew, so Fairy-types like Mega Altaria, Diancie, Togekiss, and defensive Primarina are great options. Coincidentally, all of them are also able to support Mew by absorbing status moves like Toxic that severely cripple it in its role as a Defog or Stealth Rock user through means like Heal Bell, Rest, and Refresh. Klefki is another option; however, it should only be partnered with Mew if Mew is carrying Stealth Rock so that Mew does not remove the Spikes it is capable of setting. Cobalion makes a great core with Mew, as it can also check Hydreigon and some variants of Krookodile but, unlike the prominent Fairy-types, is able to pivot into Bisharp, which can take advantage of Defog to gain a Defiant boost. Cobalion is also able to check non-Superpower Scizor for Mew and punish U-turn users with Rocky Helmet, a move that Mew provides a free opportunity for Scizor to use. Cobalion can also set up Stealth Rock, which frees up the option for Mew to run its preferred utility move in Defog. Other Pokemon capable of taking on Scizor such as Rotom-H, Moltres, and Suicune make for great partners for Mew. The former two also greatly appreciate Mew's ability to alleviate their Stealth Rock weakness while Rotom-H in particular enjoys having a free moveslot opened up to run Pain Split. Checks to powerful Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Cobalion, and Infernape are essential, such as Gligar, Moltres, and Mega Altaria; as even with a resistance to their Fighting-type STAB attacks, Mew is too easily overwhelmed due to the passivity of its set, especially when carrying Knock Off. Poison-types like Nidoqueen, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel can absorb Toxic Spikes for Mew, which would otherwise hinder its ability to remove or set entry hazards consistently. They are also able to check powerful threats like Mega Altaria and some of the aforementioned Fighting-types that use Mew as a setup opportunity. Strong wallbreakers like Terrakion, Primarina, Kyurem, and Infernape can make up for Mew's passivity while also appreciating Mew's ability to greatly weaken bulky walls like Hippowdon, Blissey, and Quagsire for them. Kyurem, in particular, enjoys having more opportunities to switch in with Mew removing Stealth Rock, and in return, it can remove Stealth Rock Krookodile. Checks to Ghost-types like Mimikyu, Doublade, and Gengar are very important, so Pokemon like Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Mega Steelix are essential. Pursuit users are also able to capitalize on Mew inviting in Ghost-types, so Choice Band Scizor, Assault Vest Bisharp, and Mega Aerodactyl make for exceptional partners. Krookodile can fulfill the role of a Pursuit user, but it can also support Mew as an offensive Stealth Rock setter that can pressure bulkier teams with Taunt and Knock Off to alleviate pressure off Mew. These Pursuit users also help remove threats like Celebi and Latias, which use Mew as setup bait. Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Doublade are able to check the likes of Latias and Celebi that set up on Mew, while Doublade can also switch into Terrakion and Cobalion for it. Mega Aggron also appreciates Mew's ability to keep its entry hazard up against common Defog users like Gligar and Rotom-H that it otherwise loses to.</p>"

  "Feraligatr": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to Sheer Force in conjunction with setup options like Dragon Dance and Agility makes Feraligatr a strong wallbreaker and sweeper. Thanks to Feraligatr's decent bulk, it can survive some hits from common faster Pokemon such as Cobalion, Mega Aerodactyl, and Krookodile to set up a Dragon Dance. It also has a number of useful resistances, which gives it setup opportunities against Pokemon that can't hit it super effectively like Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Infernape. Feraligatr threatens a lot of balance archetypes well because of its ability to easily break through their defensive backbone. Unfortunately, Feraligatr faces competition from Pokemon such as Crawdaunt, Primarina, and Mega Blastoise; the former two are way more threatening due to their secondary typing, while the latter has access to Rapid Spin to support its team. Crawdaunt can also viably use a Z-Move, unlike Feraligatr. A lacking Speed stat means Feraligatr can still get outsped by common Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon, Togekiss, and Krookodile, and it also gets outsped by Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Manectric even at +1.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Aqua Jet is an option on Feraligatr, as it can ensure the OHKO on Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill, which outrun it even after a boost, when boosted, but this comes at the cost of dropping its only strong STAB coverage in Liquidation. Swords Dance can be used for extra power to break through checks like Suicune, Alomomola, and Primarina. Superpower and Earthquake can OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Kyurem, and Empoleon, respectively, but the coverage that Liquidation, Ice Punch, and Crunch provide is generally better. Substitute lets Feraligatr avoid status ailments like burn and paralysis from Pokemon like Gengar and Klefki, but if Feraligatr does opt to run it, it will lose out on crucial coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Alomomola, Mega Slowbro, and Suicune are good checks to Feraligatr, as they can chew on Ice Punch and Liquidation. However, Mega Slowbro has to be wary of a +1 Crunch, which can 2HKO it. Primarina and Mega Sharpedo resist Feraligatr's STAB and coverage moves; however, both have to be wary of getting OHKOed by a +2 Liquidation after Stealth Rock damage, though defensive variants of the former can always stomach a hit.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: At +1 Speed, Feraligatr still fails to outrun some faster Pokemon, which means common Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Krookodile can easily threaten it out with their STAB moves. Other faster Pokemon such as Zeraora, Mega Manectric, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Aerodactyl outspeed a boosted Feraligatr and can threaten it with their respective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Rotom-H, Mega Manectric, Zeraora, and Rotom-C all outspeed an unboosted Feraligatr and threaten it with their STAB moves. However, they can't switch in on Feraligatr, as they will take massive damage from Liquidation or Crunch.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Users</strong>: Quagsire and Pyukumuku have access to Unaware, which ignores Feraligatr’s boosts, but Quagsire has to be at full health to properly check Feraligatr, as it takes nearly half from Liquidation.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Celebi can easily check Feraligatr, as they can take even a +1 Ice Punch and retaliate with Giga Drain or Spore in the case of the former. Mega Sceptile is another good check, as it can outspeed a +1 Feraligatr.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Liquidation is Feraligatr's strongest STAB move and gets boosted by Sheer Force. Ice Punch hits Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, Hydreigon, and Amoonguss, which can tank both Liquidation and Crunch. Crunch is used to hit Water-types that resist both Ice Punch and Liquidation such as Slowbro, Starmie, and Empoleon; it also gives good neutral coverage and hits Pokemon like Doublade and Bronzong super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature with 252 Speed EVs lets Feraligatr outspeed threats such as Infernape and Cobalion when boosted. However, an Adamant nature lets it inflict much more damage as a whole. Sheer Force in conjunction with Life Orb heavily increases the power of Liquidation, Ice Punch, and Crunch with a 1.69x boost, and Life Orb's recoil is negated on all of Feraligatr's attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Feraligatr doesn't want to be chipped, so avoid unnecessarily bringing it in on attacks so it can stay as healthy as possible to set up and sweep late-game. If Feraligatr can be brought in early- to mid-game while preserving as much HP as possible, it's better to fire off an attack and then set up later in the game. Don't try to set up with Feraligatr as long as its checks such as Alomomola, defensive Primarina, and Suicune are still healthy, unless this is more beneficial for its team. Try to get Feraligatr in on a free switch in or via a pivot like Rotom-H and Scizor to set up or just fire off a powerful attack. Feraligatr can also look to set up behind the safety of dual screens from partners like Xatu and Azelf, reducing its susceptiblity to being severely weakened by strong wallbreakers in the process. Pokemon that can outspeed Feraligatr when boosted such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Manectric should be removed before trying to set up and sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Feraligatr should be used on offensively oriented teams as a late-game cleaner. Dragon-types like Latias and Mega Altaria can threaten some of Feraligatr's checks like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and bulky Water-types. Dual screen users in Azelf and Xatu make great partners as they can give Feraligatr a much easier time to set up and can provide it with a free switchin via U-turn. Pokemon that can set up Stealth Rock such as Cobalion, Terrakion, and Krookodile make for good teammates, as they can also wear down many of Feraligatr's checks through residual damage. Klefki can switch in on many of Feraligatr's checks such as Celebi and Amoonguss and provide Spikes support to wear down its grounded checks. Swords Dance Scizor also makes a phenomonal partner as it can break the previously mentioned Grass-types, take on and remove faster threats like Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl, and soften bulky Water-types for Feraligatr to clean up late-game. Pokemon that can break bulky Grass- and Water-types, such as Mega Manectric, Kyurem, and Nidoqueen, make for great teammates because they can get rid of Feraligatr's checks so it can clean up late-game. Poison-types like Gengar, Roserade, and the aforementioned Nidoqueen make great partners as they can deal with one of Feraligatr's best checks being Primarina, which resist all of its coverage options. Wallbreakers like Lucario, Mamoswine, and Terrakion make great partners as they can soften a lot of bulkier Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Amoonguss, and defensive Primarina for Feraligatr to sweep easier.</p>"
      },
      "Agility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Agility raises Feraligatr's Speed two stages, letting it outspeed the entire tier, including all common Choice Scarf users. Liquidation is Feraligatr's most powerful STAB option and is further boosted by Sheer Force. Crunch provides great neutral coverage alongside Liquidation, most notably letting it hit Water-types like Tentacruel, Starmie, and Volcanion for solid damage. Ice Punch threatens Grass- and Dragon-types like Amoonguss, Celebi, and Hydreigon, complementing Liquidation nicely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs let Feraligatr hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment along with a Jolly nature allows Feraligatr to outspeed the whole tier at +2 Speed. Jolly is preferable, as an Adamant nature leaves Feraligatr outsped by Choice Scarf Latias and Infernape even after an Agility boost. Sheer Force works nicely alongside Life Orb, preventing any recoil and making Feraligatr an incredible offensive threat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If aiming to sweep late-game, weaken or remove Feraligatr's checks and counters like Amoonguss, defensive Primarina, and Alomomola before setting up an Agility. However, if brought in early- or mid-game on Pokemon it threatens like Hippowdon and Gligar, Feraligatr can throw out powerful Sheer Force-boosted attacks to whittle its checks down for later on. Feraligatr is often forced to stomach a hit in order to set up, meaning it is preferable to keep it as healthy as possible beforehand. Due to this set's over-reliance on Life Orb to boost its damage, make sure not to set up against common Knock Off users like Mew, Tentacruel, and Empoleon even if they are weakened, the former also being a common user of Will-O-Wisp a status move that severely hinders the sweeping capabilities of this set.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Feraligatr fits best on offensive teams that can adequately support it in cleaning late-game. Grass-types like Celebi, Amoonguss, and Tsareena make for ideal partners, threatening bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Suicune. Mega Manectric and Zeraora similarly fare well against opposing Water-types while also offering Feraligatr free switches in with Volt Switch. Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Mega Altaria, and Latias help cover Feraligatr's poor matchups against faster Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon like Celebi and Mega Manectric, the former can also bring in Feraligatr safely with U-turn. Wallbreakers such as Terrakion, Lucario, Gengar, and Nidoking punch holes in opposing teams, easing Feraligatr's attempt to clean late-game. The latter two being able to remove Primarina, which is the best defensive check to Feraligatr. Feraligatr's vulnerability to all entry hazards means Defog users like Rotom-H, Mega Altaria, and Gligar pair nicely with it. Entry hazard setters like Cobalion, Klefki, and Nihilego are much appreciated, helping to wear down Feraligatr's checks and counters throughout a match.</p>"

  "Crobat": {
    "overview": "<p>Crobat's great Speed stat allows it to be an effective revenge killer capable of picking off threats such as Celebi, Infernape, and Gengar, and its ability Infiltrator allows Crobat to bypass Substitute and revenge kill Gengar even through its Substitute. Crobat is also a decent stallbreaker, as it can annoy and whittle down slower Pokemon such as Alomomola, Mega Aggron, and Blissey with the combination of Taunt and Super Fang. Furthermore, an immunity to Toxic prevents these Pokemon from being able to break past Crobat. Crobat's Speed and typing also allow it to be a great check to Dragon Dance Mega Altaria and consistently pivot into Ground-types like Gligar and Hippowdon. However, while Crobat has a stellar Speed stat, it is easily revenge killed by the faster threats in the tier such as Zeraora, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Manectric. Mega Aerodactyl in particular is able to shrug off Super Fang damage with Roost and proceed to Pursuit trap Crobat. Crobat also has a mediocre Attack stat, which prevents it from being able to revenge kill threats like Latias and Terrakion, especially if Crobat has expended its Z-Move. Crobat's weakness to Stealth Rock greatly hinders its ability to pivot into Pokemon like Cobalion and Mega Altaria effectively, thus increasing the need for Crobat to use Roost to stay healthy, which can be a huge momentum drain.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>U-turn allows Crobat to perform the role of an offensive pivot and generate momentum for its teammates, but this comes at the cost of Crobat being unable to pressure bulkier builds. A defensive set consisting of Brave Bird / Taunt / Defog / Roost allows Crobat to remove entry hazards and prevent them from going up against Pokemon like Hippowdon and Cobalion. However, Crobat's weakness to Stealth Rock really hinders its ability to perform these roles effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, Zeraora are all faster than Crobat and resist its Flying-type STAB moves, allowing them to pivot into and remove Crobat easily. Mega Aerodactyl also has access to recovery in Roost, making it significantly harder for Crobat to whittle it down. Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Hydreigon are also able to outspeed Crobat and threaten to OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most of the tier's Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix resist Brave Bird, which forces Crobat to use Super Fang multiple times to try break through them. However, while these targets detest being weakened severely by Super Fang, they are capable of heavily damaging Crobat in the process. Doublade is extremely troublesome, as it resists its Flying-type moves and is immune to Super Fang, preventing it from being easily chipped down.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Regenerator Users</strong>: Crobat struggles with breaking past Pokemon like Slowbro and Alomomola, which don't take much damage from Supersonic Skystrike and can proceed to recover off any damage with Regenerator; however, these Pokemon dislike Taunt preventing them from using more reliable recovery moves or status-inducing moves. These particular defensive Pokemon also have the potential to burn Crobat with Scald, which hinders its damage output and longevity greatly.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stallbreaker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird is a powerful STAB move that allows Crobat to break through offensive teams. This move can also be turned into a powerful Supersonic Skystrike, which allows Crobat to have a better chance of revenge killing Pokemon such as Nidoking, Togekiss, and Lucario. Super Fang lets Crobat break down bulkier foes that resist Brave Bird like Mega Aggron, Mega Manectric, Empoleon, and Rhyperior. Taunt can allow Crobat to apply more pressure against Pokemon like Gligar, Blissey, and Hippowdon; when used in conjunction with Super Fang, preventing them from using their recovery moves as well as setting or removing entry hazards. Roost provides Crobat with a way to recover its health in order to consistently pivot into threats it needs to like Mega Altaria and also reduces the impact of its weakness to Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allows Crobat to hit as hard as possible while being able to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame such as Latias, Celebi, and Infernape, making it a good revenge killer. Flyinium Z is the preferred option on Crobat, as it guarantees the ability to OHKO threats like Starmie, Lucario, and Latias while also granting Crobat the necessary power to break through Mega Altaria effectively. However, if your team's Z-Move is better used on another partner, Sharp Beak is a good substitute that allows Crobat to always OHKO Gengar and 2HKO offensive Mega Altaria with Brave Bird. Infiltrator is Crobat's best ability and allows it to bypass Substitute to revenge kill Gengar and Chandelure, as well as potentially pick off a weakened Kyurem and Suicune. A bulkier EV spread consisting of 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe can be used so that Crobat can pivot into Pokemon like Mega Altaria and Krookodile better. The investment in bulk also allows it to take hits from Cobalion and Scizor a bit better; however, this comes at the cost of Crobat having to give up the power to revenge kill Pokemon like Latias, Feraligatr, and Hydreigon with Supersonic Skystrike as easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Thanks to Infiltrator, Crobat can fulfill the role of a revenge killer very well by being able to bypass Substitute from Pokemon like Chandelure, Terrakion, and Gengar. Supersonic Skystrike should be used in these instances to guarantee the OHKO. Against bulkier teams, Crobat should prioritize using its Z-Move against Pokemon like Hippowdon and Swampert that can shrug off Brave Bird damage fairly easily. Crobat can provide a lot of utility against bulkier Pokemon such as Blissey, Pyukumuku, and Alomomola through Taunt and Super Fang, so preserving its health against defensive teams is important. Crobat is a great response to Dragon Dance Mega Altaria by virtue of its Speed allowing it to outpace it even after a boost, so it should look to pivot into Mega Altaria frequently to prevent it from setting up freely and sweeping. Crobat should look to use Super Fang on a predicted switch after pivoting into Pokemon it can check such as Tsareena and the aforementioned Mega Altaria in order to whittle down checks that lack recovery like Mega Manectric, Mega Aggron, and Mega Steelix, which is vital due to them lacking a form of recovery. Crobat can also opt to prevent the latter two from potentially setting up Stealth Rock by using Taunt, but it could take a lot of damage in the process from Heavy Slam and Gyro Ball, so this shouldn't always be prioritized. It is also worth noting that both Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix carry Earthquake, which prevents Crobat being able to use Roost safely against them. By virtue of Crobat's typing, it can also find opportunities to use Super Fang by pivoting into Ground- and Fairy-types such as Gligar, Sylveon, and Florges that give Crobat the free turn needed to safely reduce an incoming target's health. Against more offensively inclined teams, it is best for Crobat to pivot into Pokemon it can check and force them out to find as many opportunities as possible to weaken Steel-types with Super Fang so that sweepers such as Mega Sharpedo and Scizor have an easier time breaking past them. Crobat should also use Supersonic Skystrike to heavily dent offensive threats like Feraligatr and Latias for other teammates to be able to revenge kill them easily. Crobat can also be worn down by Stealth Rock, so it is important for the entry hazard to be removed for Crobat to easily pivot into Pokemon like Mega Altaria and Tsareena.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Crobat fits best on offensive teams that appreciate the utility it can provide as a good stallbreaker and Mega Altaria answer. Krookodile and Cobalion are good partners for Crobat, as they can provide Stealth Rock support, which helps Crobat OHKO Pokemon like Latias and Feraligatr with Supersonic Skystrike. Other entry hazard users like Klefki and Froslass can set up Spikes to drop Pokemon into KO range for Crobat, and in return, they appreciate Crobat being able to keep their entry hazards up with Taunt. Mega Sharpedo, Mega Altaria, Celebi, and Mimikyu appreciate Crobat being able to break down bulky Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix with Super Fang so that they have an easier time sweeping. Similarly, Crobat can wear down Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Swampert for Mega Manectric and Rotom-H, which struggle to break past them. Entry hazard removers like Mega Altaria, Empoleon, and Starmie are great partners that alleviate Crobat's weakness to Stealth Rock. Mega Altaria can also check Mega Manectric and Zeraora, which outspeed and threaten to KO Crobat. Steel-types like Scizor and Doublade are great partners, as they can remove Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, which Crobat struggles to break past. The latter is also able to consistently pivot into Terrakion, which Crobat can't revenge kill from full HP. Gengar and the aforementioned Scizor appreciate Crobat being able to break past common stall Pokemon such as Blissey and Quagsire, giving them more opportunities to break through bulkier teams. Wallbreakers like Latias, Lucario, and Mamoswine work well alongside Crobat, as they appreciate its ability to wear down many defensive Pokemon such as Mega Steelix, Quagsire, and Rotom-H. Latias in particular appreciates Crobat's support and, in return, can break past other defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Alomomola, which Crobat has issues dealing with.</p>"

Xatu's great ability in Magic Bounce prevents its screens from being removed by Defog and lets it bounce back Taunt and entry hazards. U-turn stops Xatu from being an overly passive dual screens setter and allows it to slowly pivot out to bring in a partner like Scizor or Linoone safely. However, Xatu is extremely weak to common attacking types from threats like Terrakion and Mega Manectric, which makes it unable to lead and set up screens against a majority of the tier. This gives Xatu a lot of competition as a screen setter with Azelf, which is capable of setting up screens against a lot more threats due to its greater Speed tier and fewer weaknesses. Common Dark-types like Hydreigon and Krookodile can also take advantage of Xatu very easily, the latter being able to remove Xatu's Light Clay with Knock Off, which leaves its frail teammates with fewer turns to boost their stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive Xatu set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe can be used on stall and semi-stall teams as a consistent pivot into the tier's entry hazard setters such as Mega Aggron, Hippowdon, and Swampert that can also outspeed Scizor to potentially KO it with Heat Wave. However, it is hard to justify using this over common entry hazard removers like Gligar and Mega Altaria due to its weakness to common offensive Stealth Rock setters like Terrakion and Krookodile as well as Pursuit trappers such as Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Hydreigon is capable of outspeeding Xatu and KOing it with Devastating Drake or a Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulse. Choice Scarf variants can potentially cause it to flinch to prevent screens going up, so Xatu cannot safely lead against it to set up screens. Krookodile and Bisharp also limit the effectiveness of screens due to their ability to threaten Xatu with their Dark-type STAB moves, especially Knock Off, which makes Xatu lose its Light Clay. Krookodile is also faster than Xatu, which prevents Xatu from being able to set up a screen that has been extended in duration by Light Clay.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Mega Manectric and Zeraora are both faster than Xatu and threaten to KO it, preventing it from being able to set up screens safely against them, and they can also generate momentum against it with Volt Switch. They are also immune to Thunder Wave, so Xatu is unable to punish them. Xatu must also be careful around Latias, as it can run Electric-type coverage and use Gigavolt Havoc to OHKO Xatu.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Gengar and Chandelure can threaten Xatu due to their ability to potentially KO it. They can also both freely use Substitute to avoid Thunder Wave, and the latter can set up on it with Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Nihilego, Mega Aerodactyl, and Terrakion can all prevent Xatu from being able to set up screens safely. Mega Aerodactyl can also Pursuit trap Xatu, allowing another member to potentially remove it more easily and stop it from setting up dual screens.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Mamoswine and Kyurem can easily threaten to KO Xatu and prevent it from leading. Both of them can also pressure Krookodile, which is a common partner alongside Xatu. Mamoswine is also immune to Thunder Wave, while Kyurem can set up a Substitute to avoid being paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Passive Knock Off users like Tentacruel, Empoleon, and Alomomola are able to punish Xatu by removing its Light Clay, which reduces the number of turns Xatu's partners can take advantage of the screens.</p>",

      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn provides Xatu with the ability to generate momentum by slowly pivoting out and giving a teammate free switches in to take full advantage of dual screens. Thunder Wave gives Xatu a way to punish Pokemon like Latias and Hydreigon, which can be problematic for hyper offensive teams to handle, and allows Xatu to potentially set up another screen against them. However, Xatu should not risk doing this without the benefit of Light Screen unless absolutely necessary, as Latias has a chance to KO it with Devastating Drake and can always do so with Gigavolt Havoc, while Hydreigon can commonly use boosting items such as Choice Specs and Life Orb to KO Xatu. Xatu can also use Thunder Wave to punish key threats like Lucario and Infernape by crippling their Speed and preventing them from using Xatu as a free setup opportunity.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed EVs allow Xatu to outspeed a paralyzed Choice Scarf Hydreigon and give it the opportunity to set up another screen for a teammate to take advantage of. Xatu can also outspeed Adamant Tsareena and everything slower with this investment, which lets it set up screens against other threats like Volcanion, Bewear, and Bisharp that would KO it otherwise. However, Bisharp and Tsareena are both common users of Knock Off, which could detriment the effectiveness of Xatu's screens, so they should only be used as an opportunity to set up screens as a last resort. The Defense investment allows Xatu to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch from full health, as long as Reflect is up after tanking the initial hit. The Special Defense investment in conjunction with a Calm nature allows Xatu to always take a Dark Pulse from unboosted Hydreigon to paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Magic Bounce gives Xatu the unique niche of being able to prevent the opponent from removing its dual screens with Defog when it is on the field, as well as bouncing back entry hazards from Pokemon like Hippowdon and Swampert. Xatu also prevents faster Pokemon from being able to use Taunt on it, which would otherwise prevent Xatu from setting up screens or crippling a foe with Thunder Wave.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Xatu's primary role is to set up dual screens to help setup sweepers boost their stats to start breaking or sweeping. Xatu should not look to be the lead in a majority of games due to teams potentially having Pokemon like Latias, Hydreigon, and Mega Manectric that can threaten to KO it. Instead, it is best to lead with other suicide leads such as Krookodile that can punish and force out these threats to provide an opportunity for Xatu to set up dual screens against another foe. Xatu should attempt to set up on Pokemon like Celebi and Cobalion that are unable to effectively threaten it with their coverage options. However, Xatu should avoid unnecessary damage whenever possible by setting up screens against more passive Pokemon, such as Sylveon, Klefki, and Chesnaught, to improve its chances of setting up screens again later on in a match. Against bulkier hazard setters like Klefki and Swampert, Xatu can switch into them to reflect back entry hazards, which can be amazing for teammates like Venomoth that do not appreciate switching into hazards and benefit from entry hazards wearing down its foes. However, this should not always be prioritized, as it can waste multiple turns of your screens, creating fewer opportunities for teammates to easily set up. Xatu can also utilize Magic Bounce to bounce back status-inducing moves like Toxic from Pokemon such as Hippowdon and the aforementioned Swampert to cripple them while also using these passive entry hazard users as a free opportunity to set up screens. Once Xatu has set up dual screens, it should prioritize using its slow U-turn to get in partners like Scizor, Feraligatr, and Latias safely so they can take advantage of Xatu's dual screens as much as possible. Thunder Wave should also be utilized to prevent Pokemon like Latias from freely using Xatu as a setup opportunity while also making it easier for a teammate to revenge kill them.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Krookodile is a great partner for Xatu that can act as a suicide lead capable of punishing Electric- and Ghost-types as well as Latias, which Xatu struggles to set screens against. Krookodile can also set up Stealth Rock, which can rack up a lot of damage in conjunction with Xatu using U-turn to chip down Pokemon to help many of the setup users. Krookodile also has Taunt to prevent entry hazards and Defog from Pokemon like Hippowdon and Gligar, which helps take pressure off Xatu having to switch in to utilize Magic Bounce. Wallbreakers like Latias and Mega Altaria work well with Xatu, as they provide a lot of defensive utility alongside having strong breaking prowess. They also handle Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Zeraora that can prevent Xatu from setting screens immediately. Scizor is another great partner alongside Xatu, as it appreciates the defense boosts from screens to freely set up with Swords Dance and proceed to sweep or wallbreak. Scizor also helps revenge kill and force out Pokemon like Kyurem and Mamoswine, which Xatu invites and struggles to set up screens against. Sweepers like Linoone and Feraligatr appreciate the additional bulk to set up a lot more easily. Feraligatr in particular has the natural bulk and typing to take advantage of situations like Choice Band Scizor locking itself into Bullet Punch to remove Xatu as a free opportunity to set up a Dragon Dance. Pokemon that can take advantage of Dark-types like Hydreigon make fantastic partners for Xatu. Swords Dance Lucario is a great partner for this reason, as it can gain a Justified boost from a Hydreigon Choice-locked into Dark Pulse and proceed to KO it or force it out. Venomoth appreciates Xatu being able to prevent Stealth Rock from going up, which Venomoth is weak to. Venomoth also appreciates screens providing it with the boost in defense to set up safely; for instance, Venomoth is capable of taking a Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch and then KOing in return with Savage Spin-Out.</p>"

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>Quagsire's ability Unaware coupled with its decent physical bulk, reliable recovery, and fantastic defensive typing allows it to check boosting threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Cobalion, and Scizor. Because of Unaware, Quagsire fills a crucial role and fits comfortably on stall teams as a complete stop to most physical boosters. Its typing gives Quagsire key resistances to Fire, Electric, and Rock, allowing it to completely stop certain Electric-types such as Mega Manectric if they lack Grass-type coverage. However, Quagsire's low offensive stats make it a pretty passive Pokemon, leaving it easily taken advantage of by common metagame threats such as Hydreigon, Facade Mega Altaria, and Celebi. Quagsire's bulk only goes so far, too, as it is unable to consistently wall extremely powerful attackers such as Life Orb Terrakion and Crawdaunt, and its mediocre Special Defense is easily taken advantage of by special attackers such as Latias and Togekiss. Its Grass weakness can also leave it vulnerable to coverage moves from Pokemon Quagsire would otherwise check, such as Infernape and Nihilego.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Waterfall might seem tempting if you're using Curse, but it lacks the overall utility of Scald's chance to burn, which is crucial because Quagsire would lose Toxic if running Curse. Encore is an option to lock a Pokemon into an undesirable move, such as Stealth Rock, but Quagsire's low Speed makes it hard to use, and it's not worth using over Toxic most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Celebi, Amoonguss, and Tsareena easily OHKO Quagsire with 4x super effective Grass-type STAB moves. Celebi can take advantage of Quagsire to set up Nasty Plots and heal any Toxic damage with Natural Cure. Other Pokemon that use Grass-type coverage moves like Infernape and Nihilego are capable of luring in and OHKOing Quagsire.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Hydreigon, Primarina, and Mega Blastoise are capable of taking advantage of Quagsire's lower Special Defense stat. Primarina can OHKO Quagsire with Hydro Pump, while Mega Blastoise and Hydreigon easily 2HKO with Hydro Pump and Draco Meteor, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status ailments such as Toxic poison and burn hinder Quagsire's ability as a physical wall, as they not only force Quagsire to use Recover much more often but also make it unable to handle physical attackers. Toxic in particular totally cripples Quagsire by slowly wearing it down over time, while getting burned lowers the damage output of Earthquake, preventing Quagsire from 2HKOing Terrakion and Infernape and making Quagsire even more passive than it already is.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Unaware Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is mainly used to burn physical attackers such as Cobalion, Mega Aerodactyl, and Scizor. Earthquake is a secondary STAB attack that does somewhat decent damage, 2HKOing Tentacruel, Infernape, and Empoleon. Recover is used so that Quagsire can sustain its HP against the Pokemon it is meant to counter while also ensuring that Quagsire can Toxic stall foes. Toxic cripples Pokemon such as Latias and Primarina and allows Quagsire to stall out most physical attackers. Curse is an option to make Quagsire a physically bulky sweeper while also allowing it to wall physical attackers better, but you must evaluate whether dropping the utility of Toxic is worth it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Defense EVs make Quagsire as physically bulky as possible. Unaware is what gives Quagsire its niche, ignoring boosts and allowing it to counter certain physical attackers, such as Cobalion and Mega Aerodactyl. Leftovers is used for passive recovery, allowing Quagsire to avoid the 2HKO from moves such as Life Orb Scizor's Bug Bite after Stealth Rock, and it also reduces the number of times Quagsire has to use Recover. A Relaxed nature is used because Quagsire cares much more about its damage output than its paltry Speed stat.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Quagsire directly into the Pokemon that it walls, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Cobalion, and start throwing out Scalds. Always keep Quagsire healthy with Recover so that it can avoid the 2HKO from the Pokemon it walls, such as Terrakion and Swords Dance Lucario. Don't let Quagsire take unnecessary special hits, such as Primarina's Hydro Pump and Latias's Draco Meteor. Quagsire is usually paired with Blissey anyway, which checks these Pokemon. Avoid letting Quagsire get hit with a Toxic, as getting statused severely hinders its ability to wall physical attackers. Avoid getting burned as well, since Quagsire also finds it hard to wall boosting attackers when its Leftovers recovery is being negated, and getting burned only adds to Quagsire's passivity by halving its Attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey is a fantastic partner, as it can use Heal Bell to cure any status ailments such as Toxic poison. Blissey appreciates Quagsire's ability to take on physical boosters as well, while Quagsire appreciates Blissey's ability to wall special attackers. Other special walls such as Mega Altaria, Tentacruel, and Alolan Muk can cover for Quagsire's bad Special Defense stat. Defensive checks to Grass-types such as Latias, Amoonguss, and Togekiss make for good teammates, as they are able to come in on threats to Quagsire like Celebi and Mega Sceptile, although Amoonguss must be wary of Psychic-type STAB moves on Celebi. All of these Pokemon are also pretty specially bulky and can help patch up Quagsire's mediocre Special Defense. Defog and Rapid Spin users are almost mandatory on a team with Quagsire because it is unable to wall physical attackers such as Terrakion, Mega Aerodactyl, and Cobalion with several layers of Spikes and Stealth Rock up or, even worse, with Toxic Spikes on the field, which completely cripple Quagsire. Some good users of Defog and Rapid Spin are Tentacruel, Latias, Hydreigon, and Togekiss.</p>"

  "Umbreon": {
    "overview": "<p>Umbreon's high bulk and decent defensive typing allow it to check prominent threats in the metagame, such as Mega Sharpedo, Hydreigon, and Latias. Furthermore, access to Wish and Heal Bell makes Umbreon a great cleric. Toxic and Foul Play allow Umbreon to deter physical setup sweepers such as Scizor and Haxorus from setting up on it. However, Umbreon is easily exploitable by Toxic-immune Pokemon with Justified, such as Cobalion and Lucario. Furthermore, Taunt users, such as Crobat and Krookodile, completely shut Umbreon down by preventing it from healing itself or its teammates. Additionally, Umbreon's reliance on Wish + Protect to keep itself healthy can cause the loss of momentum, while reliance on Moonlight to keep itself healthy can be taken advantage of due to Moonlight's relatively low PP. Umbreon also suffers from the presence of pivots, such as Scizor, Mega Beedrill, and Infernape, that can threaten it out and gain momentum with U-turn. Umbreon also faces competition from Blissey as a special wall, with Blissey having higher HP, a defensive typing that grants it fewer weaknesses, and access to Soft-Boiled, Stealth Rock, and Natural Cure, and as a cleric from Sylveon, which has a better defensive typing and better offensive presence.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Normalium Z, in conjunction with Heal Bell, not only makes Umbreon immune to Trick but also gives it a one-time full recovery. However, Umbreon does not like giving up the passive recovery that Leftovers provides, because it loses the ability to better check key threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Sharpedo, and it also takes up a potential Z-Move from a teammate. A more physically defensive spread of 252 HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature allows Umbreon to take on certain physical attackers such as Mega Sharpedo and Mamoswine better, but Umbreon's typing makes it still struggle against prominent physical attackers, such as Scizor and Cobalion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Infernape force Umbreon out and may even set up with Swords Dance or Nasty Plot. Lucario and Cobalion deserve a special mention thanks to their immunity to Toxic and their ability, Justified, that raises their Attack each time Umbreon tries to use Foul Play on them.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-types such as Scizor and Mega Beedrill threaten out Umbreon with their powerful STAB moves. They also maintain momentum with U-turn after Umbreon switches out. Both of these dislike switching into Foul Play, though.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types, such as Mega Altaria and Primarina, threaten Umbreon out with their powerful STAB moves and resist Foul Play. They can also set up Dragon Dance or launch a powerful attack, respectively. Togekiss deserves a special mention due to being able to cure Toxic poison inflicted by Umbreon with Heal Bell and taking advantage of its passivity to set up Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Pokemon</strong>: Toxic-immune Pokemon such as Cobalion, Empoleon, and Gligar do not fear Toxic, take little damage from or can benefit from Foul Play, and can beat Umbreon one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Taunt users</strong>: Taunt users such as Krookodile and Crobat take advantage of Umbreon by preventing it from healing. Furthermore, Krookodile can remove Umbreon's passive recovery.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Foul Play is Umbreon's most reliable STAB move; it allows Umbreon to significantly damage physical attackers such as Scizor, Mamoswine, and Mega Beedrill. Heal Bell heals Umbreon's teammates and itself from status ailments, which also makes Umbreon a more reliable special wall. Toxic not only gives Umbreon an easier time beating setup sweepers, such as Latias, but also lets it badly poison common switch-ins, such as Terrakion and Infernape, and slowly wear them down. Wish allows Umbreon to recover its own health as well as heal its teammates up. Protect combines with Wish to give Umbreon an easier time healing itself up and also allows Umbreon to scout common Choice item users, such as Hydreigon and Infernape, and gain more recovery from Leftovers. Alternatively, Moonlight gives Umbreon a more reliable form of self-recovery; in combination with Wish, Umbreon can use Moonlight on a turn it would otherwise use Protect on and gain more health back. However, Moonlight's low PP means Umbreon can be stalled out rather easily.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Special Defense, combined with a Calm nature, allows Umbreon to take on special attackers such as Latias, Hydreigon, and Nidoqueen as easily as possible. 4 Speed EVs allow Umbreon to outpace uninvested Scizor and hit it with a Foul Play before it gets to hit Umbreon with a super effective move. Synchronize allows Umbreon to punish certain Toxic users such as Rotom-H, Slowbro, and Swampert that attempt to badly poison it. Leftovers provides passive recovery, which helps Umbreon retain longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch in Umbreon on special attackers such as Latias, Hydreigon, and Nidoqueen and beat them via attacking with Foul Play when ever Umbreon is at a comfortable amount of HP; this is achieved by continuously using Wish in tandem with Protect or Moonlight. Hence, Umbreon needs to stay as healthy as possible throughout the match. Generally, you should use Wish either when Umbreon is low on HP or when a teammate should be healed up. Use Protect to scout for potential mixed special attackers with Fighting coverage, such as Superpower Hydreigon and Nidoking, and Choice-locked Pokemon like Latias and Volcanion. Be wary of using Protect against certain potentially Choice-locked Pokemon that may utilize setup moves, such as Scizor and Terrakion. In addition, be wary of switching in Umbreon on potential Trick users such as Togekiss and Latias. Umbreon could also be switched in on certain physical attackers, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Sharpedo. Avoid spamming Foul Play against teams with Justified users such as Cobalion, Terrakion, and Lucario, as they can easily take advantage of it to boost their Attack. Despite its access to Toxic and Foul Play, Umbreon heavily struggles to beat certain setup sweepers such as Cobalion and Terrakion that beat it by virtue of their typings. Hence, it is wise to not stay in on them, as they use Umbreon as setup fodder. Do not stay in on Taunt users, such as Krookodile and Jellicent, because they can reliably shut down and beat Umbreon. Use Heal Bell when either Umbreon or its teammates are afflicted with a status ailment, such as Toxic, while keeping in mind Heal Bell's low PP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Umbreon fits well on balance and stall. Fairy-types, such as Mega Altaria and Togekiss, and Flying-types like Moltres and Crobat can handle Fighting-types such as Infernape and Cobalion. The aforementioned Fairy-types can also utilize Heal Bell so Umbreon can freely run Toxic, and the Flying-types appreciate Umbreon's Wish support because of their Stealth Rock weakness. Entry hazard removers such as Gligar and Tentacruel ensure that Umbreon won't have to take residual damage each time upon switching in. The latter pairs exceptionally well with Umbreon not only because it can take on certain physical attackers that scare Umbreon out, such as Cobalion and Scizor, but also because it removes Toxic Spikes by virtue of its Poison typing. Physically defensive Pokemon like Swampert and Mega Slowbro pair well with Umbreon thanks to their ability to handle the majority of physical attackers, such as Infernape and Cobalion. They are also capable of punishing common Taunt users like Krookodile with a potential Scald burn. Additionally, wallbreakers, such as Scizor, Volcanion, and Primarina, appreciate Umbreon's Wish support and also scare out setup sweepers that attempt to set up on Umbreon.</p>"

  "Gligar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gligar possesses a unique mix of utility and defensive uses that gives it a solid niche in the UU metagame. Its respectable bulk when holding an Eviolite fits well with its wide array of support moves such as Stealth Rock, Defog, U-turn, and Knock Off. Its Ground / Flying typing also leaves it with only two weaknesses, notably providing a resistance to U-turn and immunity to Volt Switch, stopping users like Mega Manectric in their tracks. Additionally, it is one of the best answers to the some of the tier's hard-hitting Fighting-types like Cobalion, Choice-item Infernape, and Choice Band Terrakion. However, Gligar must invest significantly into Defense to handle the aforementioned physical threats, leaving it vulnerable to special wallbreakers like Moltres and Hydreigon, given its lackluster Special Defense stat. Gligar also finds itself more passive than it would prefer, offering opportunities for setup sweepers to start accumulating boosts and muscle past it. Lastly, Gligar's heavy reliance on its Eviolite to maintain its defensive capabilities makes it vulnerable to Knock Off from Pokemon like Krookodile, Scizor, and Zeraora.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set featuring Taunt in combination with Knock Off or Toxic can annoy bulky teams, but it is difficult for Gligar to find room for both moves. Curse along with Roost, Earthquake, and a coverage move makes for a decent bulky setup sweeper, but it is really hard to justify over more consistent move options that largely give Gligar its niche.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Suicune, Mantine, and Swampert fear little from Gligar outside of Knock Off and Toxic and can perform their roles in front of it. More offensive Water-types such as Starmie, Volcanion, and Primarina immediately threaten Gligar with their high powered attacks.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Hard-hitting special attackers like Choice Specs Moltres, Hydreigon, and Gengar all overwhelm Gligar with their tremendous damage output.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Infernape, Rockium Z Swords Dance Terrakion, and Nasty Plot Celebi are capable of muscling past Gligar, though they struggle to break through it with their other sets.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Gligar is extremely reliant on its Eviolite for a large portion of its bulk, naturally making Knock Off users like Krookodile and Alolan Muk troublesome.</p>",

      "Defensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is Gligar's primary attacking move, letting it threaten foes like Terrakion, Infernape, and Nihilego. Roost provides Gligar with reliable recovery, keeping it healthy throughout a given match. Defog removes all entry hazards on the field, aiding teammates that may be vulnerable to them. Stealth Rock is a necessity on any competitive team, putting pressure on foes by punishing their switches with residual damage. U-turn lets Gligar effectively act as a bulky pivot, getting hard-hitting teammates in safely to do damage. Toxic pressures bulky foes like Swampert and Alomomola, as well as Ground-immune Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Hydreigon, and Togekiss. Alternatively, Knock Off cripples item-reliant Pokemon like Suicune, Kyurem, and Sylveon while scouting whether others, like Latias and Celebi, are carrying a Z-Crystal. Wing Attack is an additional option that allows Gligar to offensively check Heracross, a huge threat to bulky teams.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment in tandem with Eviolite makes Gligar as bulky as possible. 156 Defense EVs in combination with an Impish Nature let Gligar avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Terrakion's Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage, letting Gligar act as one of its only reliable answers in the tier. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Defense, aiding Gligar's matchup against threats like Hydreigon, Celebi, and Gengar while giving it a good chance to avoid the OHKO from +2 Nasty Plot Infernape's Fire Blast after Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Gligar can viably run a set with more Defense investment, further improving its one-on-one matchup against Pokemon such as Cobalion, Heracross, and the aforementioned Terrakion. Immunity is Gligar's preferred ability, letting it effectively wall bulky Steel-type Stealth Rock setters in Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Stakataka, and easily remove their entry hazards with Defog if need be.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Gligar is best used early- to mid-game as a bulky pivot capable of either setting Stealth Rock or removing entry hazards with Defog when presented with the opportunity. These opportunities are often found by Gligar switching into threats that it matches up well against like Infernape, Terrakion, Nihilego, and Mega Manectric. Gligar also fares well against bulky Steel-types, most notably when it is running Defog to counteract Stealth Rock setters like Mega Aggron and Cobalion. U-turn can either be used when predicting an opposing switch to gain momentum or when stomaching a hit to bring in a teammate into a favorable position more safely. Keep Gligar healthy if it is necessary in order to keep a threat in check, but play more aggressively with U-turn if health is not a priority. Use Toxic and Knock Off to cripple Pokemon like Swampert, Suicune, and Mantine as they attempt to switch in safely on Gligar. Be wary of Knock Off users such as Krookodile and Alolan Muk, as while Gligar can beat them one-on-one if needed, it heavily relies on its Eviolite to remain as bulky as possible to check the threats it is meant to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gligar fits well on a variety of playstyles ranging from bulky offense to stall; they all appreciate its utility and overall pivoting ability. Water-types like Empoleon, Slowbro, and Primarina make natural partners, covering Gligar's only weaknesses while it absorbs the Electric-type attacks aimed at them. Nihilego, Blissey, and the aforementioned Empoleon and Primarina can also act as special sponges, aiding Gligar by taking on many of strong special attackers that threaten it. Gligar can get offensive Grass-types like Celebi, Tsareena, and Rotom-C into favorable positions against bulky Water-types with U-turn. Additionally, the latter two can form momentum-based cores with Gligar through their respective moves, U-turn and Volt Switch. Other Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Rotom-H offer similar synergy with Volt Switch while threatening Water-types as well. Fighting-type wallbreakers like Terrakion, Heracross, and Kommo-o make for great partners, taking advantage of Gligar's ability to bring them in safely to do big damage. They also double down as solid Knock Off switch-ins, something essential alongside Gligar due to its reliance on Eviolite. Finally, Gligar helps out Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon, Infernape, and Latias, providing them free switch ins by getting off slow U-turns on Pokemon that they threaten such as Celebi and opposing Hydreigon and Latias.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mega Steelix is a great tank that takes advantage of its great bulk, good typing, and high Attack to check prominent threats like Latias, Heal Bell Togekiss, and Mega Altaria. Coupled with access to Stealth Rock, these traits differentiate Mega Steelix from other Stealth Rock setters such as Nihilego and Hippowdon. Mega Steelix's Ground typing allows it to block Volt Switch, which gives it leverage over other Steel-types like Cobalion and Stakataka. That said, Mega Steelix still suffers from heavy competition with Mega Aggron, which has access to Filter and has more resistances. Furthermore, despite having eight resistances, Mega Steelix suffers from a weakness to common types including Fighting, Water, and Ground, which leaves it weak to other prominent threats, including Terrakion, Primarina, and Hippowdon. Mega Steelix's lack of reliable recovery also lessens its reliability, as it is forced to be paired with Wish support if it desires to reach its full potential as a wall. While Mega Steelix's low Speed increases Gyro Ball's damage output, it also leaves Mega Steelix outsped by the vast majority of the metagame, which means it'll have to take a hit before moving in most cases. Finally, despite its Ground typing, Mega Steelix struggles to reliably check common Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Rotom-H because they can hit it super effectively. Hence, other Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert outperform Mega Steelix in this role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Roar can be used to prevent certain setup sweepers like Scizor and Doublade from setting up on Mega Steelix, but Curse generally accomplishes the same goal more efficiently.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Swampert and Alomomola do not mind switching into Mega Steelix's STAB moves and threaten it out with super effective Water-type STAB attacks. However, they do not appreciate switching into Toxic. Similarly, offensive Water-types like Starmie, Primarina, and Volcanion threaten Mega Steelix out with powerful Water-type STAB moves, but they find it hard to switch into Mega Steelix's Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Moltres</strong>: Moltres is able to switch into any of Mega Steelix's STAB moves and OHKO it with Fire Blast. Furthermore, it can reliably prevent Mega Steelix from setting up Stealth Rock thanks to the combination of Pressure and Defog. However, it doesn't appreciate switching into Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: While they can't directly switch into Mega Steelix, strong special attackers like Infernape, Chandelure, and Nidoking can take advantage of their powerful STAB moves to easily threaten Mega Steelix out. Furthermore, they can take advantage of Mega Steelix being forced out to set up with Nasty Plot, Calm Mind, or Substitute, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Despite not being able to OHKO Mega Steelix, strong Fighting-types like Terrakion and Cobalion can deal lots of damage to Mega Steelix and force it out. Not only do special Fighting-types like Infernape and Lucario OHKO Mega Steelix with their powerful STAB moves, but they can also take advantage of a forced switch on Mega Steelix's part to set up with Nasty Plot.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyro Ball is Mega Steelix's most powerful STAB move and allows it to OHKO Latias and Hydreigon after Stealth Rock damage. Heavy Slam, alternatively, hits slower Pokemon such as Florges and Sylveon harder and has higher PP, but the power drop against faster threats like Latias, Hydreigon, and Krookodile is noticeable, so Gyro Ball is generally better. Curse boosts Mega Steelix's Attack and Defense to extremely high levels while simultaneously boosting Gyro Ball's Base Power by reducing Mega Steelix's Speed. This eases Mega Steelix's matchup against threats it fails to overpower such as Scizor and Hippowdon, lets it serve as a wincon, and overall improves its wallbreaking capabilities. Toxic, alternatively, lets Mega Steelix reliably punish bulky Water-types like Swampert and Alomomola as well as Defog users that normally beat it, like Moltres, Rotom-H, and Mantine. Rest is an option that lets Mega Steelix check certain threats like Latias and Mega Aerodactyl more reliably, but it leaves Mega Steelix extremely passive for three turns and thus is not recommended, as Mega Steelix will be taken advantage of.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs and 48 Special Defense EVs allow Mega Steelix to avoid the OHKO from Mega Manectric's Overheat after Stealth Rock damage. A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs are used to maximize the damage output of Gyro Ball. Alternatively, Mega Steelix can run an EV spread of 252 HP / 52 Def / 204 SpD with a Careful nature if it wishes to be more bulky; the 52 Defense EVs allow it to always survive a +2 Close Combat from Cobalion after Stealth Rock. If opting for Heavy Slam, Mega Steelix should use 31 Speed IVs and an Adamant nature to Speed tie uninvested Reuniclus, Amoonguss, and Slowbro. Sturdy allows Steelix to act as a panic button if need be, but it generally doesn't have any use. Sand Force in combination with Curse improves Mega Steelix's matchup against Hippowdon, but outside of that it has no use.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Prioritize Mega Evolving Steelix as early as possible, as Mega Steelix relies on the boosts it gains by Mega Evolving to check threats like Nihilego and Latias. Also, prioritize setting up Stealth Rock because this allows Mega Steelix to reliably punish switches and KO threats like Latias and Hydreigon. Thanks to its great bulk and typing, Mega Steelix can find a lot of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock, such as against Fairy-types like Florges and Sylveon and Flying-types like Togekiss and Mega Aerodactyl. Curse should be used against opposing physical attackers that cannot overpower Mega Steelix like Mega Aggron and against certain setup sweepers like Scizor and Doublade that try to overpower Mega Steelix by boosting their stats. However, be wary of using Curse if the opposing team has means of reliably scaring out Mega Steelix like Starmie or Moltres. Refrain from letting Mega Steelix take unnecessary damage because that'll make it notably harder to switch it into threats like Mega Aerodactyl and Mimikyu. Furthermore, refrain from using Gyro Ball too often because it has low PP, and if Mega Steelix runs out of Gyro Ball PP, it cannot check dangerous threats like Latias and Togekiss. It is advised to scout against Pokemon like Scizor and Togekiss that often carry super effective coverage for Steel-types. Despite its ability to block Volt Switch, Mega Steelix should be wary of switching into certain Electric-types like Rotom-H and Mega Manectric that can hit it with a super effective Fire-type move. However, Mega Steelix's presence still prevents the aforementioned Electric-types from reliably using their Electric-type moves, so keep that in mind. If coupled with Wish support, prioritize healing Mega Steelix as soon as it takes damage, as it appreciates every bit of health to reliably act as a wall.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Steelix fits best into more balanced and defensive teams. Wish users like Alomomola and Blissey pair well with Mega Steelix because of their ability to heal it. Likewise, not only do Fairy-types like Sylveon and Florges have the ability to heal Mega Steelix, they also are able to check Fighting-types like Terrakion as well as cure status ailments from Mega Steelix with Heal Bell, which allows Mega Steelix to use Rest more reliably. Water-types like Jellicent and Slowbro generally pair well with Mega Steelix because they check Fire-types like Infernape and Volcanion, as well as other Water-types like Tentacruel and Swampert. Teammates like Mantine and Hydreigon can clear entry hazards for Mega Steelix and hence are a necessity in improving its walling capabilities. The former appreciates Mega Steelix's ability to check certain Electric-types like Rotom-H and Flamethrower Mega Manectric, while the latter appreciates Mega Steelix's ability to take on Fairy-types like Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Klefki. Furthermore, Hydreigon appreciates Mega Steelix's Stealth Rock support to break down opposing teams more easily. Similarly, other Dragon-types like Latias and Haxorus appreciate Mega Steelix taking on Fairy-types. In return, they can check Fire-types like Infernape and Volcanion for Mega Steelix. Wallbreakers such as Moltres and Terrakion and setup sweepers like Latias and Scizor appreciate Mega Steelix's Stealth Rock support to break through certain cores and Pokemon more easily. Finally, special walls like Blissey and Florges can take on special attackers like Starmie and Primarina that threaten Mega Steelix out.</p>"

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Scizor's great typing, excellent bulk, variety of support moves, Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, and good coverage moves such as Superpower and Quick Attack make it the best Pokemon in the tier. Scizor is able to act as a reliable offensive check to the tier's best attackers, including Latias, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Altaria, which grants it many opportunities to apply immediate pressure on the opposing team throughout the match. Scizor also finds itself a comfortable place in every playstyle, as it can be a strong wallbreaker, a devastating sweeper, a scary cleaner, or a glue pivot. However, a below-average Speed stat usually leaves it over-reliant on its priority moves, which can hold it back from beating fast Pokemon like Rotom-H, Moltres, Cobalion, and Tentacruel that resist Bullet Punch. Furthermore, despite having eight resistances and one immunity, Scizor is 4x weak to Fire, which allows Pokemon that Scizor normally beats such as Latias and Mega Altaria to reliably bait Scizor in and OHKO it, and it allows Magneton to trap Scizor and eliminate it reliably. Lastly, four-moveslot syndrome makes Scizor struggle to break certain walls like Mega Aggron, Jellicent, and Doublade, depending on its set.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An entry hazard remover set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD, an Impish nature, and a moveset of Bullet Punch, U-turn or Knock Off, Defog, and Roost could be used on stall teams to have a better matchup against certain hazard setters like Nihilego and Mamoswine that can usually reliably set up hazards against slower teams. Assault Vest is another option that boosts Scizor's Special Defense to allow it to pivot into and take on strong special attackers like Latias, Gengar, and Celebi more reliably.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Fast Electric-types like Rotom-H and Mega Manectric can reliably check Scizor. The former utilizes its decent Defense and its unique typing, which grants it a 4x resistance to Scizor's main priority move in Bullet Punch, to either reliably OHKO Scizor with Overheat or pivot out with Volt Switch. The latter utilizes its decent bulk and ability in Intimidate to lower Scizor's Attack stat, tank a hit, and reliably OHKO Scizor with super effective coverage. Magneton deserves a special mention because it resists Scizor's priority moves, prevents it from switching out, and can reliably OHKO Scizor with Hidden Power Fire. However, none of the above appreciate switching into Scizor, as they dislike taking unnecessary damage from Scizor's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fast Fire-types like Infernape and Moltres can take Scizor's Bullet Punch and reliably OHKO it back with their respective STAB moves. However, both are KOed by a +2 Life Orb-boosted Quick Attack from Scizor after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Cobalion, Mega Aggron, and Silvally-Steel can take on non-Superpower Scizor and capitalize on it by setting up Stealth Rock, Swords Dance, or Curse or pivoting out with Parting Shot.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Alomomola, Quagsire, and Pyukumuku can check Scizor reliably. Alomomola can usually reliably pivot on Scizor sets that lack reliable recovery thanks to its immense bulk and access to Regenerator, while the latter two can take on Scizor sets that rely on Swords Dance to break their checks thanks to their good bulk and access to Unaware.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn is Scizor's preferred STAB move because it allows Scizor to take advantage of the many switches it forces by gaining momentum in your favor, which maximizes its potential as a pivot. Pursuit also takes advantage of the switches Scizor forces to potentially trap and either remove or severely weaken Pokemon like Latias, Mega Aerodactyl, Blissey, and Nihilego. Alternatively, Knock Off improves Scizor's overall matchup against physical walls like Alomomola and Hippowdon by removing their passive recovery and pressuring them harder. It is also used to hit common switch-ins like Doublade, Tentacruel, and Chandelure. However, because Scizor is mostly used as a pivot, Pursuit is generally a better option here.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band increases Scizor's naturally high Attack to an enormous level, which maximizes Scizor's potential as a pivot, a revenge killer, and a Pursuit trapper. 92 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outpace uninvested Nidoqueen and Klefki. An EV spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with an Adamant nature is a viable alternative that allows Scizor to check opposing Scizor better as well as Adamant Crawdaunt, although the loss in bulk is noticeable.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early- to mid-game, Scizor should mostly be using U-turn to weaken its checks and safely bring in other wallbreakers and entry hazards setters to give them a free turn. Late-game, Scizor may attempt to clean with its Technician-boosted Bullet Punch. If predicting a switch to a supposed check like Cobalion, Doublade, or Chandelure, Scizor can try to hit them with its coverage moves. Scizor should scout for coverage moves from Pokemon it usually checks, like Hidden Power Fire from Latias, Fire Blast from Mega Altaria, and Fire Fang from Mega Aerodactyl, before aggressively playing around them. Scizor's subpar Special Defense and the lack of reliable recovery on this set limit the number of special hits it can take, so scouting for Gigavolt Havoc on Calm Mind Latias as well as Shattered Psyche or Tectonic Rage on Nasty Plot Celebi is mandatory. For these reasons, Pursuit should only be used on Pokemon like Latias if they are guaranteed to not have proper coverage against Scizor. Pursuit may also be used to hit opposing wallbreakers that Scizor checks and also aren't necessarily weak to Pursuit, like Mega Aerodactyl, Blissey, Nidoking, and even Terrakion and Hydreigon in some cases, if they pose enough of a threat to Scizor's team. If the opposing team has Magneton, Scizor should not be played carelessly and should be mainly using U-turn or Superpower until Magneton is weakened enough. Furthermore, despite not being common, Magneton is sometimes paired with an Eject Button user like Alomomola and Amoonguss, which will negate U-turn's effect, so Scizor should be played very carefully around them. Scizor should also avoid directly switching into powerful Pokemon it checks like Mega Aerodactyl and Nihilego because that could cause it to get worn down quicker. Furthermore, for that same reason, carelessly switching Scizor into entry hazards should be avoided.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Scizor fits best on bulky offense teams. Stealth Rock setters such Diancie, Swampert, and Nihilego are recommended because a big majority of Scizor's checks, like Moltres and Rotom-H, are weak to Stealth Rock. Spikes setters like Klefki can help Scizor take advantage of another big majority of its checks being grounded, like Mega Aggron and Jellicent, to break past them more easily. For that same reason, Toxic Spikes setters like Tentacruel and Nihilego also pair well with Scizor because they allow Scizor to pressure bulky Water- and Ground-types hard that normally beat it, like Alomomola and Hippowdon. Due to Scizor's devastating weakness to Fire, Fire-type switch-ins such as Latias and Primarina are mandatory to check the likes of Infernape and Moltres. Thanks to access to U-turn, Scizor can form a VoltTurn core with Volt Switch users like Mega Manectric and Rotom-H or with other U-turn users like Hydreigon. Other wallbreakers like Primarina and Kyurem take advantage of Scizor luring in physical walls like Swampert and Alomomola and generating a free turn for them. In return, Scizor can trap or eliminate special walls that they struggle to break, like Blissey and Empoleon. Similarly, setup sweepers like Celebi and Latias enjoy Scizor luring in Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Doublade. Entry hazard removers such as Tentacruel and Gligar can help Scizor generate more opportunities to switch in due to Scizor's natural susceptibility to opposing Stealth Rock and Spikes. Gligar, as well as other Ground-types like Hippowdon and Krookodile, can also take on Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Zeraora that force Scizor out.</p>"

      "Life Orb + Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Superpower grants Scizor the ability to hit Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix that normally check it for super effective damage. Knock Off allows Scizor to hit Ghost-types like Chandelure and Doublade for super effective damage, as well as Tentacruel and Rotom-H for neutral damage, and pressure them by removing their held items. Bug Bite is Scizor's strongest option for a STAB move thanks to Technician, which allows Scizor to hit Water-types like Swampert and Alomomola for big damage after a boost, which resist its main STAB move in Bullet Punch. Alternatively, Quick Attack, in tandem with Technician, lets Scizor KO or severely weaken faster checks like Infernape, Moltres, Starmie, and Rotom-H, after Stealth Rock damage. Roost could be used on this set to give up Scizor's matchup against faster teams to have a better time dealing with slower teams, although the loss in coverage makes it harder for Scizor to sweep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb gives a notable boost to Scizor's damage output that allows its Bullet Punch to reliably OHKO Latias, as well as OHKOing Hydreigon and Klefki after Stealth Rock damage. It also allows Scizor to OHKO Infernape, Mega Sharpedo, and Starmie after Stealth Rock damage most of the time with Quick Attack. An EV spread of 164 HP / 252 Atk / 92 Spe can be viably used to exchange Scizor's Speed for bulk, as this set relies on priority moves the most, although this worsens Scizor's matchup against opposing Scizor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Scizor should mainly try to sweep mid- or late-game when checks such as Rotom-H, Swampert, Tentacruel, and Magneton have been eliminated or weakened enough. If using Quick Attack, Scizor should be less worried about faster checks like Mega Sharpedo and Infernape, as it allows Scizor to bypass them after small chip damage. Similarly, if using Bug Bite or Superpower, Scizor should be less worried about slower checks like Swampert and Mega Steelix. However, weakening them to at least be in the range of a boosted hit from Scizor is advised. Scizor should avoid switching in directly on attacks, even resisted ones, as this might limit its sweeping potential. However, if using Roost, Scizor may attempt to switch into weaker defensive Pokemon such as Sylveon and Hippowdon. Scizor should aim to set up on Fairy-types like Florges and Sylveon as well as on passive Pokemon like Bronzong and Blissey. If using Roost, Scizor could also attempt to set up on less passive Pokemon like Gligar and Hippowdon, as well as switching into them more often mid-game. Generating opportunities for Scizor to set up a Swords Dance is mandatory for this set to function to its full potential; hence, trying to force opposing Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Latias lacking Hidden Power Fire to use Draco Meteor and then switching Scizor in safely to set up a Swords Dance is advised. If needed, Scizor can also function as a reliable revenge killer to Rock-types such as Terrakion and Mega Aerodactyl. If using Knock Off, Scizor could hit a predicted counter with Knock Off on the switch to ease its sweep later in the game. However, be wary of using Swords Dance early-game, as the opponent might directly switch to a check like Rotom-H, Tentacruel, or Mega Manectric, which may result in a total loss of momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Scizor fits the best on hyper offense teams. Stealth Rock setters like Azelf and Mamoswine are mandatory, as Stealth Rock secures the OHKO on the likes of Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo with Scizor's boosted attacks. Similarly, Spikes setters like Froslass and Klefki give Scizor an easier time taking out checks like Tentacruel and Infernape with Quick Attack and Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix with Superpower, and Toxic Spikes setters like Nihilego improve Scizor's matchup against slower checks like Quagsire and Swampert, especially if it's using Bug Bite. Wallbreakers like Latias and Terrakion are mandatory in order to weaken Scizor's checks, including Rotom-H and Tentacruel. Dark-types like Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo work exceptionally well, as they're strong enough to bust through Scizor's common checks in Rotom-H and Tentacruel, and they're also capable of generating setup opportunities for Scizor, as they lure in Fairy-types like Sylveon and Diancie. Mega Sharpedo can also try to sweep after Scizor, if Scizor fails to do so. Similarly, Ground-type wallbreakers like Zygarde-10% and Mamoswine can help pressure faster Electric-types like Rotom-H and Mega Manectric. Offensive entry hazard removers like Starmie and Tsareena can not only help Scizor bust through its checks but also remove entry hazards for Scizor that may limit its sweeping opportunities.</p>"

      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn provides Scizor with a relatively strong STAB move that also improves its potential as a pivot early- to mid-game. Roost is mandatory on this Scizor set because it allows it to continually switch into threats like Krookodile and non-Hidden Power Fire Latias. It also increases Scizor's setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP EVs in tandem with 144 Defense EVs allow Scizor to avoid the 2HKO from strong moves like Mega Aerodactyl's Stone Edge as well as from Krookodile's Earthquake after Stealth Rock most of the time. Furthermore, 96 Special Defense EVs allow Scizor to avoid the OHKO from strong special moves like +1 Gigavolt Havoc from Latias when at full health as well as +2 Shattered Psyche from Celebi after Stealth Rock damage. 16 Attack EVs in tandem with an Adamant nature guarantee the OHKO on physically defensive Amoonguss with a boosted Savage Spin-Out after Stealth Rock damage. 4 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outspeed uninvested Alomomola.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Scizor set should be played slowly. Prioritize setting up entry hazards so Scizor can reliably pressure its checks with U-turn. Early- to mid-game, Scizor should mainly pivot into Pokemon like Sylveon, Latias lacking Hidden Power Fire, and Krookodile. Pressuring slower checks like Alomomola and Amoonguss with Swords Dance is also recommended to have Scizor deal greater damage to its checks. However, if the opponent is using faster checks like Rotom-H, Tentacruel, and Zeraora, Scizor should mainly be using U-turn to pivot out as they switch in. Savage Spin-Out should be mainly used if Scizor has boosted and the KO on an opposing Pokemon is guaranteed. Scizor should be taking advantage of U-turn to bring in wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Primarina that are capable of breaking its checks. Towards the end-game, Scizor should try to find an opportunity to set up a Swords Dance on passive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Gligar or on Fairy-types like Sylveon, Diancie, and Mega Altaria lacking Fire Blast.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Scizor set fits the best on bulky offensive teams as well as on balanced teams. Stealth Rock setters like Empoleon, Diancie, Swampert, and Mega Steelix are mandatory to help Scizor pressure its checks more reliably. Having a bulky Ground-type like Rhyperior or Gligar is mandatory to pressure Electric-types like Zeraora and Rotom-H. They work exceptionally well because they fill in the essential Stealth Rock setter role, too. Hippowdon also works exceptionally well in this slot because it does best at pressuring and chipping Electric-types like Mega Manectric thanks to Sand Stream, its good natural bulk, and access to reliable recovery. Similarly, Spikes setters like Chesnaught and Klefki as well as Toxic Spikes setters like Tentacruel, Nihilego, and Nidoqueen help Scizor pressure its checks like Alomomola and Infernape more easily. Wallbreakers like Terrakion and Latias appreciate Scizor bringing them in safely with U-turn. Terrakion also forces out common Scizor checks like Rotom-H, Tentacruel, and Mega Aggron, while Latias lures them in for Scizor to take advantage of. Other strong pivots such as Hydreigon and Mega Manectric can form a VoltTurn core with Scizor to wear down common defensive cores with the help of entry hazards. Fire-type answers like Primarina and Mega Aerodactyl are mandatory to check Fire-types Pokemon like Infernape and Moltres that force Scizor out. Hazard removers like Tentacruel and Gligar are mandatory to help Scizor pivot more easily, as Scizor is susceptible to entry hazards. Heal Bell users like Togekiss and Blissey are very helpful thanks to their ability to heal Scizor from status ailments, which may prevent it from sweeping. Similarly, Sylveon and Florges not only provide Scizor with Heal Bell support but also provide Wish support that helps Scizor pivot more easily.</p>"

      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Superpower lets Scizor hit Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix that usually beat it for super effective damage. Knock Off lets Scizor hit Ghost-types like Doublade and Jellicent super effectively as well as strip other checks like Rotom-H and Tentacruel of their passive recovery. Roost gives Scizor longevity to help it set up on passive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Gligar more reliably as well as check faster Pokemon like Krookodile and Kyurem better. Bug Bite could be used over Superpower in conjunction with Roost for more reliable wallbreaking capabilities as well as a better matchup against Water-types like Alomomola and Swampert, although the loss of a better time breaking through Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix is detrimental.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fightinium Z should only be used in combination with Superpower, granting Scizor access to All-Out Pummeling, which allows it to bypass Steel-type checks like Mega Aggron and Stakataka. Metal Coat should be mainly used with Knock Off, and it enhances Scizor's sweeping capabilities by allowing it to KO Latias and Hydreigon after Stealth Rock damage after a boost. Life Orb is an alternative, especially if using Bug Bite, that provides Scizor with more consistent power, although the recoil damage can limit Scizor's sweeping potential. 252 HP EVs in conjunction with 48 Defense EVs allow Scizor to avoid the 2HKO from Krookodile's Earthquake while maximizing its overall bulk. 4 Speed EVs allow Scizor to outspeed uninvested Alomomola.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This Scizor set should be only brought in on slower passive Pokemon like Gligar and Hippowdon. It could also be used to check stronger attackers like non-Fire Fang Krookodile and non-Hidden Power Fire Kyurem. If using Superpower, Scizor should not be played recklessly; try to catch Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix that may try to capitalize on Scizor with a boosted All-Out Pummeling to KO them. Afterwards, switch out accordingly, if the opponent sends out another Scizor check, and try to weaken them until they're in the range of a boosted Bullet Punch. If using Knock Off, use it early- to mid-game on predicted switches to checks such as Tentacruel and Swampert that rely on their passive recovery to continually check Scizor. Furthermore, luring in Ghost-types like Doublade and Jellicent and weakening them for a later sweep is ideal. Use Roost frequently on passive Pokemon like Gligar and Hippowdon to set up Swords Dance on them. Once confirmed they do not utilize Fire coverage, using Roost to set up on stronger attackers like Krookodile and Latias is also an option. However, be wary of the loss of momentum the use of Roost may cause.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Scizor set should be mainly used on bulky offense and balance teams. Pokemon like Hippowdon and Swampert work well with Scizor because they can deal with checks like Chandelure, Mega Manectric, Magneton, and Infernape and provide mandatory Stealth Rock support to give Scizor an easier time sweeping. Diancie deserves a special mention as a Stealth Rock setter because it is able to reliably counter common checks in Rotom-H and Moltres and provide Scizor with Heal Bell support. Similarly, Klefki and Chesnaught can set up Spikes to help Scizor guarantee the OHKO on Mega Aggron with a boosted All-Out Pummeling. Toxic Spikes setters like Tentacruel and Nihilego can help Scizor wear down Water-type checks like Quagsire and Alomomola and work especially well with Knock Off Scizor. Strong Dragon-types like Choice Specs Hydreigon and Kyurem can weaken physical walls like Alomomola and Mega Aggron for Scizor while appreciating Scizor's ability to pivot into Fairy-types like Florges and Sylveon that usually beat them. Entry hazard removers like Tentacruel and Tsareena can get rid of hazards for Scizor's sake so it can continually switch into stronger attackers like non-Fire Fang Krookodile and non-Hidden Power Latias. They can also wear down Water- and Steel-types for Scizor, respectively.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>U-turn provides Scizor with its main STAB move, allowing it to adequately threaten threats like Latias, Starmie, and Celebi as well as put its teammates into favorable positions. Bullet Punch notably lets it revenge kill Pokemon such as Mega Altaria and Mimikyu. Pursuit pressures the aforementioned Psychic-types by letting Scizor trap them as they attempt to switch, removing or simply weakening them for teammates that may appreciate it. Superpower offers additional coverage against Pokemon like Cobalion, Terrakion, and Rotom-H, letting Scizor revenge kill them if they are weakened.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>216 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature and Choice Scarf allow Scizor to outrun its primary targets to pick off in Starmie, Latias, and Celebi.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Scarf's additional Speed gives Scizor much more leeway when hard switching into threats like Latias and Celebi, although it still must be wary of their coverage moves in the process. Commonly, they will use their respective setup moves in order to attack slower Scizor sets the following turn, but Choice Scarf Scizor removes that interaction entirely. When Latias, Celebi, and Starmie are at high amounts of health, they may not fear an unrevealed Choice Scarf set and therefore stay in and attack. Thus, Pursuit will not KO them and Scizor will be exposed, so U-turn is often the safest play. However, Technician-boosted Pursuit is naturally a safe play when those threats are chipped into range of it. Beyond dealing with these threats, Choice Scarf Scizor's main utility lies in getting teammates into favorable positions through its fast U-turn. Scizor can also revenge kill other weakened threats like Terrakion, Cobalion, and Infernape, but be wary of locking into moves besides U-turn, as they are relatively weak and often give other foes free turns. Scizor's Jolly nature and lack of a power-boosting item also make it a much worse revenge killer of Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Altaria with Bullet Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Scarf Scizor fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its pivoting ability, improved matchup against fast Psychic-types, and additional Speed. Mega Manectric is a nearly perfect as a partner, making a fantastic VoltTurn core while heavily appreciating Scizor's ability to actively pressure or remove Latias after it switches into Mega Manectric. Speaking of Latias, partners such as Celebi, Infernape, and Volcanion also take great advantage of its removal. Ground-types such as Rhyperior and Krookodile fit well next to Scizor and the VoltTurn cores Scizor often finds itself in, reliably setting up Stealth Rock for the core, pressuring Rotom-H, and shoring up common weaknesses of VoltTurn teams to threats such as Mega Aerodactyl. Rhyperior also aids in handling opposing Mega Manectric. Wallbreakers such as Z-Move Hydreigon as well as the aforementioned Infernape and Volcanion fit well with Scizor, taking advantage of safe switch-ins on foes like Amoonguss, Mega Aggron, and Doublade. Starmie and Tentacruel not only share great defensive synergy with Scizor, covering its Fire weakness, but also provide Rapid Spin support, the superior entry hazard removal option for VoltTurn cores. Choice Scarf Scizor finds itself much worse against Dragon Dance Mega Altaria than other sets, making Amoonguss a fantastic partner.</p>"

  "Heracross": {
    "overview": "<p>Heracross's great Attack stat coupled with its ability Guts makes it a strong physical wallbreaker. With its access to Close Combat as a good Fighting-type STAB move, Swords Dance to set up, and coverage moves such Knock Off and Facade, Heracross can be very difficult to switch into, being able to break through defensive cores and bulky teams with ease. Also, its Bug / Fighting typing allows it to soft check Ground-types such as Krookodile and Hippowdon. Despite all those good qualities, Heracross has a lackluster Speed stat and no access to strong priority to be a decent offensive Pokemon, making it easily revenge killed by a lot of faster offensive attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl, Latias, and Mega Pidgeot. It also lacks reliable recovery and access to Drain Punch, leaving it prone to being worn down by burn damage and entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heracross can be used with Choice Scarf and Moxie as a decent revenge killer; however, that set is vulnerable to status and there are better Fighting-types to choose from as a Choice Scarf user. A Choice Band set with Guts could be used, but Heracross usually needs to be able to switch up moves, and Guts Heracross with a Flame Orb already allows it to wallbreak effectively. Substitute can be used to ease predictions and prevent Heracross from being easily revenge killed.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Mega Altaria, and Sylveon can switch into everything outside of a Guts-boosted Facade and easily KO Heracross with their STAB moves, though they don't like getting their items removed by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Offensive threats such as Mega Pidgeot and Mega Aerodactyl can easily revenge kill Heracross with their Flying-type STAB moves, but they can't switch into it safely. Crobat and Moltres, on the other hand, are capable of switching into Close Combat but don't take Facade well. Gligar can't do much to Heracross unless it uses Wing Attack, but it can easily take a +2 Facade.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Latias, Mega Beedrill, and Hydreigon outspeed non-Choice Scarf Heracross and can easily beat it with their powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazard damage coupled with the burn damage from Heracross's Flame Orb wears it down very quickly, decreasing its opportunities to switch in without getting KOed.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Heracross's Attack to massive levels, further augmenting its power in conjunction with Guts to break through even the bulkiest walls. Close Combat is Heracross's strongest STAB move and hits everything that doesn't resist it hard thanks to Guts. Knock Off hits Psychic- and Ghost-types that are resistant or immune to Close Combat such as Celebi and Doublade hard and cripples switch-ins by removing their items. Facade is greatly boosted when used in conjunction with Flame Orb and Guts, punishing Fairy- and Poison-types such as Sylveon and Tentacruel that try to switch into Heracross on a predicted Close Combat.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Jolly nature with maximum investment in Attack and Speed allows Heracross to hit as hard as possible while still being able to outspeed base 80s such as Chandelure and Togekiss and Speed tie with Nidoking. Guts is the preferred ability to grant Heracross the power boost needed to break through most defensive builds after its Flame Orb has been activated. This also makes Heracross immune to other status conditions like poison and sleep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Heracross should be used as an early-game wallbreaker due to its massive Attack stat in conjunction with Guts. Try to always keep entry hazards off the field, as the burn damage already wears down Heracross relatively quickly. Avoid switching in directly on opposing attacks as well, as its average defenses will force it to take huge damage, which is detrimental to its longevity. Make use of pivots, smart double switches, and VoltTurn support to bring in Heracross and activate its Flame Orb safely. Don't try to set up a Swords Dance against most offensive teams, as Heracross would usually benefit more by simply attacking. On the other hand, Swords Dance should be used against more defensive teams to easily break down walls; specifically, set up on Pokemon that can't do much back to Heracross, such as Blissey, Quagsire, and Toxic Hippowdon, or against Pokemon that it forces out, such as Blissey and Krookodile. Be sure to use Heracross with proper prediction so as to not unnecessarily drop its defenses when using Close Combat. For example, if your opponent has a good answer to Heracross that's able to take two hits or a switch-in that outspeeds Heracross, using Facade or Knock Off is the better choice.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since Flying- and Fairy-types resist Heracross's Close Combat and threaten it, Pokemon that can come in safely and beat them such as Mega Aerodactyl, Nihilego, and Scizor fit well with Heracross. Pokemon such as Latias and Krookodile that can deal with Poison-types like Nidoking and Tentacruel are greatly appreciated, allowing Heracross to fire off attacks more freely. Entry hazard support is highly recommended, since it makes Heracross's job as a wallbreaker a bit easier. In particular, Stealth Rock setters such as Swampert and Seismitoad make for great partners, as they can also check threats to Heracross such as Mega Aerodactyl and Infernape, while Klefki is able to set up Spikes. Otherwise, hazard removers such as Mega Blastoise and Latias prevent Heracross from being worn down as easily. Heracross profits from VoltTurn users such as Mega Manectric, Mega Beedrill, and Scizor, which can bring Heracross on the field for free to unleash Guts-boosted attacks. Finally, sweepers and cleaners such as Scizor and Mega Aerodactyl appreciate Heracross's ability to break down defensive cores.</p>"

  "Mantine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mantine's good typing, good bulk, access to reliable recovery, and access to Defog make it a decent Pokemon in UU. Mantine is one of the best defensive answers to physical threats such as Cobalion and Infernape due to its typing. It also has a great Special Defense stat that allows it to absorb hits from strong special attackers such as Hydreigon. Those traits, paired with its ability to threaten Stealth Rock users such as Hippowdon with Toxic and Scald, allow Mantine to control hazards effectively. However, Mantine is passive and should be avoided on more offensive teams, as it can’t maintain momentum well. It also has a weakness to Stealth Rock, which hinders its role as a wall and can be taken advantage of by strong physical attackers, such as Mamoswine, Lucario, and even Pokemon that it would usually check such as Choice Band Infernape. Mantine has a 4x weakness to Electric, allowing Pokemon such as Mega Manectric to pressure it and prevent it from exerting its role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Air Slash is not a common option, but it can catch your opponent off guard, hitting Grass-types for super effective damage and OHKOing Heracross, which would otherwise switch in freely to take advantage of Mantine’s passiveness.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mantine appreciates being healthy, as it aids it in its role as a Defogger. To help preserve its health, Mantine should try to avoid taking too much residual damage from sources such as Toxic and Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Mantine can get overloaded by offensive teams. Although Haze makes it less prone to offensive pressure, it still can be pressured to use Defog and deal with a threat at the same time. This, combined with the aforementioned residual damage, can quickly wear down Mantine and make it unable to adequately perform its role.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mega Manectric, Magneton, and most other Electric-types are able to switch into Mantine or come in with a double switch and then fire off a strong Volt Switch or Thunderbolt. Zeraora fears a burn from Scald, but it can threaten Mantine out with Plasma Fists.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Although they fear switching into Mantine because of Scald, Mantine gets extremely pressured by Rock-type Pokemon. Pokemon like Terrakion, Mega Aerodactyl, and Nihilego can hit Mantine really hard; Nihilego is particularly troublesome because it does not mind being burned and does not take very much from Scald.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is Mantine's most reliable STAB move that also has a chance to burn the foe. Roost allows Mantine to repeatedly switch in on Pokemon it is supposed to counter, such as Infernape and Volcanion. Defog clears entry hazards from the field for itself and its teammates. Haze helps Mantine beat common setup sweepers, such as Suicune and Cobalion, more reliably. Toxic allows Mantine to punish common switch-ins, such as Mega Manectric and Latias, and it also lets Mantine pressure common Stealth Rock setters such as Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature lets Mantine switch into physical attackers with more security, such as Cobalion, Lucario, and some variants of Scizor. The use of Leftovers improves its longevity. Water Absorb gives Mantine an immunity to Water-type attacks and can be utilized to recover HP when facing Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Swampert that rely greatly on such attacks to exert offensive pressure. Water Absorb also helps stop setup sweepers such as Suicune that have roles a Water-type attack as their only STAB move. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 SpD with a Calm nature helps Mantine take on special attackers such as Nidoking. However, it gives up on some physical bulk with this spread, which lessens its ability to check physical threats.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Although Mantine is a Defogger, it's weak to Stealth Rock. Misplaying can end up with it being KOed before using Defog. It can also get pressured easily, mainly when Stealth Rock is up. Make sure to avoid getting into a position where Mantine needs to heal, use Defog, and use Haze against opposing threats at the same time. Switch in against Pokemon that Mantine checks, such as Cobalion and Scizor. Also, avoid being hit by Toxic, as it hurts Mantine’s longevity and overall effectiveness, making it harder for Mantine to deal with the Pokemon that it normally checks. Keeping Mantine as healthy as possible is essential for it to keep checking potential threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ground-types complement Mantine well, as they can check the Electric- and Rock-types that beat Mantine. One example is Hippowdon, which makes a nice core with Mantine despite its passivity and shared weakness to some wallbreakers, such as Crawdaunt. Gligar is another great partner that absorbs physical hits Mantine wouldn’t appreciate and benefits from Mantine’s special bulk and Water immunity. Dragon-types are also a nice option to check Electric-types. Two good Dragon-type partners are Hydreigon and Kyurem, the latter one appreciating Mantine’s ability to use Defog. Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Celebi can be great partners too, as they take Electric-type attacks easily. Heal Bell users, such as Blissey and Sylveon, can help with Mantine's weakness to status.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>The notable Special Attack and Speed boosts Houndoom receives upon Mega Evolution make it a respectable sweeper in the UU metagame. Its movepool complements its massive Special Attack stat and strong offensive typing perfectly, containing high-Base Power STAB moves, a great boosting move in Nasty Plot, and other intriguing options such as Sludge Bomb, Taunt, and Destiny Bond. With its high Speed, Mega Houndoom outspeeds much of the unboosted tier, notably including Pokemon like Cobalion, Latias, and Gengar. However, while its Dark / Fire typing is solid offensively, it leaves Mega Houndoom weak to the tier's common Water-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks. Mega Houndoom also finds itself vulnerable to all entry hazards, including a notable weakness to Stealth Rock, which in combination with its average bulk does not leave Mega Houndoom with many opportunities to fulfill its role. It also has some rough one-on-one matchups with top-tier Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Aerodactyl, putting more pressure on the rest of the team to shore up those recurring weaknesses.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Houndoom has a wide variety of options for its flexible fourth moveslot, though they are generally less effective than the options listed above. Destiny Bond lets Mega Houndoom sacrifice itself in order to take slower Pokemon down with it, but it is fairly situational. Flame Charge gives Mega Houndoom +1 Speed, though it possesses low Base Power and there are few opportunities to viably pull it off. Hidden Power Electric punishes Mantine while maintaining respectable damage against Primarina, but again, other options are generally much better. Sunny Day in combination with Solar Beam lets Mega Houndoom take advantage of its Solar Power ability and act as a monstrous wallbreaker, but the recoil and lack of setup opportunities often make it less useful than a simple Nasty Plot boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Hydreigon</strong>: Hydreigon fears little from any of Mega Houndoom's common attacking moves and can proceed to throw out free attacks of its own.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Even with Taunt, Mega Houndoom struggles to break through sturdier special walls like Blissey, Mantine, and Snorlax due to its initial damage output against them.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Fast Pokemon like Mega Beedrill, Choice Scarf Infernape, and Choice Scarf Krookodile all outspeed Mega Houndoom and can deal heavy damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Though they must fear Sludge Bomb, Fire-resistant Fairy-types like Primarina and Mega Altaria can heavily pressure Taunt variants of Mega Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Nihilego and Mega Aerodactyl shrug off any of Mega Houndoom's unboosted attacking moves and can KO it in return.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Suicune, Empoleon, and Swampert can all stomach Mega Houndoom's neutral hits and deal huge damage with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Mega Houndoom is easily picked off by priority moves like Infernape's Mach Punch and Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot raises Mega Houndoom's Special Attack two stages, immediately making it a threatening sweeper. Fire Blast provides Mega Houndoom with a high-Base Power STAB move, though it does possess a chance to miss. Dark Pulse is a more consistent STAB option, hitting much of the tier for solid damage and having a decent chance to cause foes to flinch. Sludge Bomb allows Mega Houndoom to threaten troublesome Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Primarina, which effectively wall its two STAB moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs allow Mega Houndoom to hit as hard as possible. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Mega Houndoom outspeed common threats like Cobalion, Latias, and Gengar. Houndoominite is necessary for Houndoom to Mega Evolve. Flash Fire is the preferred ability prior to Mega Evolution, as it makes it possible for Houndoom to take advantage of Choice-locked Fire-types like Infernape and Volcanion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Mega Houndoom in mid- or late-game to either throw out strong attacks or sweep. Use Nasty Plot only when it is safe to do so and when its checks have been weakened to the point where Mega Houndoom can break through. Due to its middling bulk and weakness to entry hazards, try to bring Mega Houndoom when it is safe to do so, such as through U-turn or double switches. If necessary, Mega Houndoom can revenge kill threats like Scizor and Latias. Use Taunt against special walls when expecting recovery moves, whittling them and hindering their effectiveness later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Houndoom fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its revenge killing and sweeping capabilities. Physical wallbreakers like Heracross are essential alongside Mega Houndoom, as it struggles to break through more specially inclined walls like Blissey. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Scizor, Crobat, and Rotom-C can bring Mega Houndoom in safely, giving it more opportunities to throw out powerful attacks or set up and sweep. Grass-types like Celebi and Rotom-C punish the bulky Water-types that Mega Houndoom may struggle to break through. On the other hand, bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Empoleon, and Swampert can help shore up some of Mega Houndoom's weaknesses, making them solid defensive partners. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Mega Houndoom pairs nicely with entry hazard removers like Latias and the aforementioned Tentacruel and Empoleon. Entry hazard setters such as Klefki and Nihilego aid Mega Houndoom in wearing Blissey down, coupled with Mega Houndoom's Taunt.</p>"

  "Porygon2": {
    "overview": "<p>Porygon2 establishes itself as one of the very few viable omniboost sweepers in the tier because of Z-Conversion, which not only boosts all of Porygon2's stats by one stage but also allows it to change into an Electric-type. This grants Porygon2 valuable resistances to Bullet Punch and Flying-type moves and STAB on its potent coverage. Its BoltBeam coverage also gives it everything it needs to hit top-tier threats like Scizor, Latias, and Hydreigon along with almost everything else in the tier neutrally. Porygon2's Speed after boosting is also passable, letting it outpace Latias, Gengar, and Tornadus. Porygon2 is also able to afford running recovery, which further distinguishes itself from Shaymin. However, Porygon2 can only set up once per match, so it relies on a large amount of team support to chip and remove its checks like Blissey and Mega Steelix so it will be able to clean up the remainder of the opponent's team late-game. Porygon2's Speed after boosting up, while usable, still leaves it outsped by common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Infernape along with naturally fast Pokemon such as Zeraora and Mega Aerodactyl. This tends to force Porygon2 to waste turns restoring its health in order to prevent itself from being revenge killed, which opens up free turns for the opponent. Porygon2's bulk is also marginally lower than Shaymin's, which, in conjunction to its low Speed before using Z-Conversion, can give Porygon2 a more difficult time setting up.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Ball can be used in the first moveslot to transform Porygon2 into a Ghost-type and give it an easier time powering through Latias, Chandelure, and Reuniclus. Shadow Ball should be used alongside Hidden Power Fighting so Porygon2 isn't powerless against Dark-types. However, Porygon2 now cannot resist Bullet Punch and has new issues with Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Porygon2 can run a defensive set with an Eviolite to serve as a blanket check to Nidoking, Hydreigon, and Mega Manectric and Trace to allow it to use opposing abilities to its advantage, but this role is eclipsed by Blissey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Blissey and Alolan Muk wall Porygon2 to no end and can potentially poison it, completely ending its sweep.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Sceptile both naturally outspeed Porygon2, which forces it to take some damage. Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Infernape also outspeed after Z-Conversion and can deal substantial damage, with Krookodile being able to use Earthquake against an Electric-type Porygon2. Most of these Pokemon should fear the potential Ice Beam if they hard switch in, though.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Mega Steelix, Swampert, and Mamoswine take neutral damage from Porygon2's Ice Beam and threaten it with Earthquake after Z-Conversion.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Ice Beam form Porygon2's Bolt Beam coverage that hits practically everything in the tier for neutral damage at the minimum. Recover keeps Porygon2 healthy and is easier to utilize after Z-Conversion due to its augmented bulk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Z-Conversion transforms Porygon2 into an Electric-type upon boosting due to Thunderbolt residing in the first moveslot. This is essential for letting Porygon2 resist Scizor's Bullet Punch while also resisting Mega Manectric's and Zeraora's STAB moves. Download can grant Porygon2 a boost in Special Attack if it comes in on a foe with a lower Special Defense compared to its Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Despite its access to recovery, Porygon2 should only be brought out late-game once its checks have been chipped or removed by its teammates. It should be brought in on free turns or slow pivots to prevent it from taking any damage beforehand. Be knowledgeable on the opposing Pokemon's current Special Defense stat so you can guarantee a Special Attack boost before activating Z-Conversion. This can make it easier to break Mega Aggron, Doublade, and bulkier Scizor sets. It is not advised to switch in on an opposing Pokemon with a lower Defense stat, as Porygon2 would not be nearly as strong. Porygon2's increased bulk allows it to take hits from Nihilego and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, which, in tandem with Recover, is useful to keeping it healthy and eventually beat these Pokemon out. Avoid Toxic and Thunder Wave, as they can end or significantly cripple Porygon2's sweep; the former forces Porygon2 to systematically heal up, while the latter leaves it wide open for punishment by numerous threats like Terrakion and Nidoking that can now all outspeed it. Recovering against Pokemon that may carry a Choice item like Hydreigon helps Porygon2 scout them while remaining healthy. It can also be useful for winning long drawn out battles against Nihilego. Healing up too early can waste turns and make Porygon2 more vulnerable to attacks. Porygon2 should set up on Pokemon that it can outspeed to minimize the damage it takes and the number of times it needs to recover. Setting up on Amoonguss, Slowbro, and defensive Primarina can work into Porygon2’s favor because of this as long as it scouts for status beforehand.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Porygon2 fits best on bulky offense where it can be a decent wincon and wait for its teammates to chip at its checks. Entry hazard setters such as Nihilego, Empoleon, and Swampert lay down the ubiquitous Stealth Rock to apply subsequent chip damage. Spike setters like Klefki also provide even more entry hazards to pressure the opponent with. Scizor, Krookodile, and Mega Aerodactyl provide Pursuit support, which can chip away at Porygon2’s checks like Blissey and Mega Steelix in the long run if they don’t keep themselves healthy. Cobalion and Terrakion threaten out and remove special walls that can counter Porygon2 while also setting up Stealth Rock. Terrakion also can dismantle Rotom-H, whose typing alongside its access to Toxic and Pain Split makes it a major annoyance to Porygon2. Amoonguss and Celebi handle defensive Ground-types that could complicate Porygon2's sweep. The former can put a target asleep with Spore to possibly guarantee setup for Porygon2, and both are great status absorbers. Primarina threatens every prevalent Choice Scarf user like Krookodile and Hydreigon as well as the likes of Mega Aerodactyl and removes them. Slow pivots like Scizor, Gligar, and Rotom-H give Porygon2 an easier time switching in without having to take any unnecessary damage.</p>"

Blissey is also used as a setup fodder by Steel-types such as Scizor and Cobalion, which are immune to Toxic, and bulky Substitute users, such as Suicune. In addition, a poor Defense stat means that Blissey is vulnerable to the most physical attackers in the tier, such as Mega Sharpedo and Terrakion.

Toxic also lets it cripple physical attackers, such as Infernape and Mamoswine, that tend to switch into it. Soft-Boiled is Blissey's main form of recovery, letting it consistently check special attackers, such as Primarina and Hydreigon, and stall them out with Toxic. Heal Bell allows Blissey to heal status ailments from both itself and its teammates without switching out and should be used if the team already has a Stealth Rock setter. Stealth Rock lets Blissey punish opposing switch-ins. Because of Blissey's colossal HP stat, Wish can be used on the fourth moveslot to heal its teammates when it gets the opportunity to. Protect could be used together with Wish, but this combination can be ultimately suboptimal because not only takes it up two moveslots, it also is done better by Alomomola due to its access to Regenerator. Thunder Wave allows Blissey to punish common switch-ins, such as Cobalion and Gengar, that do not fear Toxic. However, this is only situationally useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense, together with a Bold nature, maximizes Blissey's physical bulk, as its special bulk is naturally high enough to check most special attackers. Leftovers provides Blissey with passive recovery, which lets it switch into special attackers such as Mega Manectric and Primarina more easily. Natural Cure lets Blissey heal a potential status ailment upon switching out, making it harder to wear down.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Blissey into special attackers, such as Hydreigon and Nidoking. However, it is recommended to scout for mixed sets, such as Superpower on Nidoking and Volcanion, that hit Blissey for physical damage to overpower it. If using Heal Bell, heal up teammates affected by lethal status ailments when an opportunity is provided. If using Stealth Rock, it is best to send out Blissey early-game to set it up. Prevent Blissey from getting worn down so it can repeatedly switch into special attackers, such as Mega Sceptile and Mega Manectric. A way to do that is to remove entry hazards as often as possible and use Soft-Boiled frequently so Blissey is not 2HKOed by any of the special attackers' moves. Avoid staying in with Blissey on setup sweepers that beat it, such as Togekiss, Scizor, and Cobalion, so they don't get extra free turns, and on physical attackers, because they can potentially overpower Blissey. Do not stay in on Taunt users, such as Krookodile and Gengar, that shut down Blissey and beat it. Be wary of bulky Substitute users such as Suicune and Kyurem. Although Blissey can take hits from them, they reliably stall Blissey out of PP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Blissey is often found alongside Alomomola and Quagsire, as the three are staples on most stall teams. The former can comfortably switch into physical attackers that beat Blissey, such as Infernape and Choice Band Scizor, and the latter can handle most physical setup sweepers that take advantage of Blissey's passivity, such as Cobalion and Swords Dance Scizor. Spinners and Defoggers, such as Tentacruel and Togekiss, can remove entry hazards for Blissey, which helps it not be worn down when switching in. Fighting-type checks, such as Doublade, Tentacruel, and Moltres, beat the likes of Terrakion, Cobalion, and Heracross. Spikes setters, such as Klefki and Chesnaught, help punish Fighting-types that tend to switch into Blissey, such as Cobalion and Terrakion. Certain special setup sweepers, such as Celebi and Togekiss, are capable of beating Blissey. Hence, Pokemon that beat those make great partners. Mega Aerodactyl and Alolan Muk are great examples.</p>"

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>Unfortunately, Entei's place in UU is non-existent. Although Entei boasts a relatively impressive Attack stat, a reasonable Speed tier, access to the incredible move Sacred Fire, which has a 50% chance to burn opposing targets, and a solid priority option in Extreme Speed, that's where its good traits end. Sacred Fire, Stone Edge, and Extreme Speed aren't nearly as spammable as Entei would like due to their small PP number, and Entei's lack of a boosting move or generally impressive coverage means that it's entirely outclassed as a Fire-type wallbreaker by Infernape, which can more effectively run a Choice Band set thanks to it having a better Speed tier and STAB priority options, which allow it to adequately revenge kill faster threats such as Mega Sharpedo and Choice Scarf Krookodile and Hydreigon. Furthermore, unlike Entei, Infernape only takes neutral damage from Stealth Rock, meaning that it has more opportunities to be brought into the battlefield. Furthermore, thanks to having decent mixed offensive stats and access to Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, Infernape is able to run multiple sets, making it much less one-dimensional than Entei.</p>",
    "sets": {"Choice Band": {"description": "<p>This set attempts to utilize Entei's impressive Attack as effectively as possible by providing it with a Choice Band to boost its Attack by one stage. Due to its limited movepool, however, it is unable to effectively do so, and as a result, it is walled by common Pokemon such as Mega Altaria, defensive Primarina, Latias, and Rhyperior that are all able to pivot into it with ease. The former two are also able to remove or utilize the burn from Sacred Fire, as Mega Altaria can run a Facade set or remove the burn with Refresh, while Primarina is able to fully recover with Rest. Ultimately, even as a Choice Band Fire-type wallbreaker, Entei is outclassed by Infernape, which boasts a more diverse movepool, a better Speed stat, and a lack of a Stealth Rock weakness, providing it with more wallbreaking opportunities.</p>"}},

  "Suicune": {
    "overview": "<p>Suicune is a great setup sweeper thanks to its solid defensive typing and natural bulk, which also allows it to check prominent threats such as Scizor and Mega Aerodactyl. Furthermore, with access to both Rest and Calm Mind, Suicune can also function as a fairly sustainable bulky sweeper. Because of its ability, Pressure, and its potential to set up fairly easily, Suicune is able to threaten defensive teams a lot. Pressure also allows it to break through certain Pokemon that would normally check it, such as Volcanion. Suicune also has a very decent base Speed stat for a bulky Pokemon, allowing it to hit or set up against Pokemon like Mamoswine and Togekiss. However, since it doesn't have access to reliable recovery, Suicune is forced to rely on Leftovers or Rest in order to stay healthy. It's also held back by its weakness to Electric and Grass, which are common typings, making it easily exploitable by Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Celebi.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Roar that capitalizes on using Suicune as a dedicated phazer is an option, but it would be wasting Suicune's sweeping capabilities. Additionally, Roar is also an option on bulky Calm Mind variants of Suicune, allowing it to beat opposing setup sweepers like Latias more easily, although Suicune becomes overly passive and easily pressured by many other threats if it forgoes Sleep Talk. Suicune can run an offensive Calm Mind set with Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / Hidden Power Electric or Tailwind, and Waterium Z or Leftovers. This set is capable of bluffing one of the bulkier ones, especially if it's carrying Leftovers. Toxic is an option, which cripples Pokemon that are immune to Scald, such as Seismitoad, Mantine, and Jellicent. However, Suicune usually doesn't have room for Toxic on any of its sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Pokemon like Rotom-C and Mega Manectric can force Suicune out with their STAB moves. However, Mega Manectric dislikes switching on a direct hit.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Pokemon like Amoonguss, Mega Sceptile, and Celebi don't fear much from Suicune and can threaten it with their STAB moves. However, Amoonguss can't break Suicune's Substitute with Giga Drain after a Calm Mind boost.</p> <p><strong>Phazers and Haze Users</strong>: Pokemon with access to Roar, Haze, and Clear Smog such as Empoleon, Tentacruel, and Amoonguss are able to prevent Suicune from setting up. However, if Suicune manages to set up a Substitute, Amoonguss is unable to effectively stop it, as it's forced to play mind games between Substitute and Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Water-immune Pokemon</strong>: Since Scald is Suicune's only attacking move, Pokemon that are immune to Water-type moves, such as Mantine and Jellicent, can wall Suicune with ease and take advantage of it. However, they must be wary of Toxic. Additionally, it's worth noting that certain Water-immune Pokemon, such as Seismitoad and Volcanion, are prone to being PP stalled.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Calm Mind Users</strong>: Opposing Calm Mind users such as Latias can set up alongside Suicune and beat it one-on-one. If Suicune has Roar, it can phaze and prevent them from setting up, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: With no form of reliable recovery, any form of residual damage, such as poison and hazards, is able to wear down Calm Mind + Protect Suicune very quickly and can cripple its ability to either set up or pivot into opposing threats.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Knock Off users such as Krookodile and Bisharp can remove Suicune's Leftovers, which limits its ability to set up.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Mamoswine and Choice Band Terrakion can overwhelm Suicune with offensive pressure, as it lacks reliable recovery.</p>",

      "Calm Mind + Protect": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Suicune's Special Attack and Special Defense, turning it into a threatening sweeper. Protect is primarily used to PP stall opposing Pokemon, although it also helps to keep Suicune healthy in conjunction with Leftovers. Additionally, it's also useful to scout for moves and Choice-locked Pokemon. Scald has a decent chance to burn foes. Substitute provides Suicune with a lot more opportunities to set up and PP stall slower and more defensive Pokemon, but it can also avoid status moves like Toxic from Pokemon such as Blissey and Alomomola. Additionally, the combination of Substitute and Calm Mind makes it a lot harder for special attackers to break its Substitute while also protecting Suicune from potential critical hits.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>216 Speed EVs and a Timid Nature allow Suicune to outspeed base 80s, like Togekiss and Mamoswine. Maximum HP investment gives Suicune 101 HP Substitutes, which prevents Seismic Toss from breaking them in one hit. With the given Special Defense, Amoonguss's Giga Drain and uninvested Rotom-H's Volt Switch can't break a Substitute when Suicune is at +1. Leftovers is the item of choice to provide Suicune a form of passive recovery. Pressure is used to PP stall and wear down bulky Pokemon like Blissey.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is very effective against bulky teams. However, it should be played carefully. Suicune shouldn't be used to sponge hits throughout the match, as its effectiveness depends on how high its HP is. Against offensive teams, Suicune finds setup opportunities against Pokemon like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Latias, and it's able to PP stall them with ease. Avoid switching Suicune in on a potential Knock Off, Trick, or Switcheroo, because Leftovers is Suicune's main source of recovery, and it will get worn down very quickly once it loses it. It will also limit Suicune's ability to set up a Substitute and PP stall. Set up a Substitute against passive Pokemon such as Alomomola that rely on Toxic or other status moves to damage Suicune. Furthermore, once Suicune is behind a Substitute, it's safe to set up a Calm Mind against Pokemon like Blissey and Amoonguss. However, avoid using Calm Mind against faster Pokemon like Mega Sceptile and Celebi, since they can easily force it out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Suicune can fit on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate Suicune's ability to break through bulkier teams. Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon and Alomomola helps Suicune by increasing its longevity, as it lacks reliable recovery. Cleric support from Pokemon like Togekiss and Blissey is also very useful, since Suicune is heavily crippled by status. Furthermore, Suicune hates switching in on hazards, as it gets easily worn down, so entry hazard removers such as Tentacruel, Latias, and Scizor are great partners for it. Toxic Spikes can wear down opposing Pokemon, which works well with Suicune's ability to PP stall. Thus, Toxic Spikes setters such as Tentacruel and Nihilego pair well with Suicune. Ground-types such as Mega Steelix and Krookodile can easily check Electric-types such as Mega Manectric that normally force Suicune out. Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Scizor have good synergy with Suicune, as they can sponge Grass-type attacks and check Pokemon like Latias, while Suicune checks the Fire-types that can threaten them. Pursuit traps problematic Pokemon like Latias and Celebi and is one of the ways to support this set, making it easier for Suicune to sweep. Thus, Pokemon like Scizor and Krookodile make good teammates. Grounded Poison-types such as the aforementioned Tentacruel are able to absorb Toxic Spikes, which are extremely detrimental to Suicune's sweeping potential.</p>"
      },
      "CroCune": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind turns Suicune into a threatening bulky sweeper, boosting both its Special Attack and Special Defense. Rest is Suicune's main form of recovery, healing it instantly in one turn. Rest is also able to cure Suicune of any inflicted status condition. Sleep Talk prevents Suicune from becoming overly passive when using Rest, providing it the chance to use any of its other moves while asleep. Scald is Suicune's only attacking move, being able to spread burns and weaken opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Speed investment allows Suicune to outspeed Adamant Scizor and hit it before it can U-turn out. The rest of the EVs are placed in HP and Defense to maximize Suicune's defensive capabilities. Leftovers provides Suicune with a form of passive recovery, further increasing its longevity and ability to switch into opposing threats. Waterium Z can be used instead of Leftovers, providing Suicune with a strong attack that is able to OHKO Pokemon like Quagsire after some prior damage. Additionally, it prevents Suicune from being crippled by Trick or Switcheroo or having its item removed by Knock Off. With Pressure, Suicune is able to outstall Pokemon like Blissey and Alomomola with ease.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can be used as a pivot throughout the battle due to its great defensive capabilities and access to recovery. Only start setting up with Suicune late-game once Pokemon that can check it, like Celebi and Mega Sceptile, are either weakened or removed. Furthermore, if it's carrying Leftovers, avoid switching Suicune in on a potential Knock Off, Trick, or Switcheroo, since it'll have a much harder time switching in if its Leftovers is removed. Use Rest carefully, since it gives up a lot of momentum, and the opponent can take advantage of that. Scald can be used early-game to wear down and weaken foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Suicune fits best on bulky teams that appreciate Suicune's ability to switch into a number of threats. Since it forces a lot of switches, pairing Suicune with hazard setters is ideal. Therefore, Pokemon like Mega Steelix, Tentacruel, and Klefki make good partners. Pursuit trappers like Krookodile are also valuable partners, since they can trap Pokemon like Latias and Celebi. Furthermore, cleric support from Pokemon like Togekiss is appreciated, since it can heal Suicune from sleep. Steel-types like Mega Aggron and the aforementioned Klefki have good synergy with Suicune, as they can check Grass-types like Mega Sceptile and Celebi and Pokemon like Latias and Refresh Mega Altaria that normally force it out, while Suicune is able to check Fire-types like Infernape. Pokemon that can sponge Electric-type attacks such as Mega Sceptile and Hydreigon make good partners for Suicune, as Electric-types can force it out. Hazards can limit Suicune's ability to pivot around, so entry hazard removers like the aforementioned Tentacruel and Latias make for good teammates.</p>"

  "Celebi": {
    "overview": "<p>Celebi is among UU's most potent sweepers and stallbreakers, as its decent offensive stats and typing allow it to force out several common Pokemon, such as Amoonguss, Hippowdon, and Primarina, in order to set up with Nasty Plot. Through the use of Z-Moves and its wide movepool, Celebi can also easily work around common means of counterplay. If running Psychium Z, it can power through common Grass-type switch-ins like Scizor and Mega Altaria. If opting for Grassium Z alongside Recover, however, Celebi can handle Blissey one-on-one while generally maintaining a solid combination of power and longevity, usually giving it a strong stall matchup. Further bolstering Celebi's prowess against defensive teams is its solid typing and uninvested bulk, allowing it to pivot in on several defensive presences, such as Slowbro, Quagsire, and Alomomola, as well as Natural Cure, which allows it to switch in several times due to its ability to circumvent Toxic poison and other status ailments. Unfortunately, Celebi's typing burdens it with as many common weaknesses as useful resistances, leaving it susceptible to tier staples like Infernape, Hydreigon, and particularly Scizor due to its 4x weakness to Bug, as well as to Pursuit from the likes of Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile. Pursuit is also found on several stall teams specifically to deal with Celebi, which can burden it quite a bit if it isn't careful. Celebi is also fairly weak to the tier's priority moves, taking super effective damage from Bisharp's Sucker Punch, Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, and Mamoswine's Ice Shard as well as a hefty chunk from Scizor's Bullet Punch. Moreover, Celebi suffers from a merely decent Speed tier for an offensive Pokemon, allowing several faster threats with super effective coverage, like Gengar, Mega Manectric, and Nihilego, to easily revenge kill it. Lastly, Celebi's offensive prowess is good but not great, meaning that it often relies on Z-Moves to break bulkier targets and thus can be worked around with proper prediction.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A defensive pivoting set with Stealth Rock and U-turn has merit thanks to Celebi's ability to take on most passive foes, like Swampert and Alomomola, quite well. However, such a set is much easier to take advantage of and doesn't have the same utility Celebi's boosting sets often provide. Earth Power + Groundium Z is an option for more easily powering through Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Klefki. It also takes on two of Celebi's only counters in Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Bisharp. However, this usually limits Celebi's coverage compared to its other options for Z-Moves, leaving it unable to hit Latias or Hydreigon very hard. Ghostium Z alongside Shadow Ball is an option for taking on Latias more reliably, breaking through a rare yet fairly reliable counter in Bronzong, nailing opposing Celebi, and still dealing heavy damage to Mega Aggron and Scizor. The main drawback, however, is the coverage or recovery Celebi will have to give up to run it, often hurting its matchups against the likes of Blissey and Hydreigon. A Choice Scarf set allows Celebi to better take advantage of its access to both Healing Wish and U-turn while revenge killing a few common nuisances, like Infernape, Dragon Dance Feraligatr, and Terrakion, though its damage output is lacking, thus making Celebi easier to exploit. An offensive Stealth Rock set is also an option due to Celebi's ability to threaten several common entry hazard removers, like Tentacruel, Starmie, and Empoleon, but Celebi tends to run into issues fitting every move it'd like on such a set and can also struggle dealing meaningful damage to resistant or bulkier targets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Celebi's average Speed and many weaknesses allow several faster Pokemon like Infernape, Mega Manectric, Gengar, and Nihilego to easily exploit it. Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Chandelure can also heavily pressure Celebi, even threatening to trap it with Pursuit in Krookodile's case.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Although they can drop to the right attack, several Dark-types have ways of pressuring Celebi. Mega Sharpedo and Krookodile's Grass-type weaknesses prevent them from reliably switching in, though both Pokemon have ways of outrunning Celebi, either through Speed Boost or running Choice Scarf, and threatening it with super effective STAB moves. Mega Sharpedo can also just naturally outrun Celebi if it's running a Jolly nature. Bisharp's Assault Vest set can switch into any of Celebi's attacks and Pursuit trap it, while offensive sets fear Leaf Storm variants but can overwhelm Celebi with STAB Sucker Punch. Alolan Muk completely walls any set Celebi can run barring the rare Groundium Z, allowing it to easily pressure it with its STAB attacks or threaten to trap it with Pursuit. Mega Houndoom resists Celebi's STAB coverage, can naturally outspeed it, and threatens to OHKO it with STAB Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Latias resists Celebi's STAB moves, avoids the 2HKO from an unboosted Dazzling Gleam, and can outspeed and threaten Celebi with Dragon-type STAB moves, even using non-Dazzling Gleam sets as setup bait. Hydreigon must be warier about coming in on Dazzling Gleam and can also drop to a boosted Bloom Doom, but it outspeeds Celebi if running Choice Scarf and can dent it heavily with STAB Dark Pulse or gain momentum with U-turn. Kyurem can tank any boosted attack from full barring Shattered Psyche and proceed to KO Celebi with its powerful STAB Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types resist Celebi's STAB combination and can thus check its sets to various degrees of consistency. Scizor can tank any hit from full barring a boosted Shattered Psyche or Hidden Power Fire, KOing Celebi in return with its 4x effective STAB U-turn. It can also revenge kill a weakened Celebi with Bullet Punch. As mentioned before, Bisharp's offensive set forces Celebi into uncomfortable mind games, while its Assault Vest variant can tank any hit and reliably trap it. Klefki and Mega Aggron can tank both Celebi's Psychic- and Grass-type Z-Moves, allowing them to set up Spikes against it or threaten it with STAB Heavy Slam, respectively. However, both lack recovery, which leaves them prone to being overwhelmed after chip damage. Bronzong is a particularly strong answer to most Celebi sets, stomaching any attack aside from the rare Shadow Ball and chipping Celebi down with any combination of Gyro Ball, Psywave, and Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Celebi's typing leaves it weak to a large number of common priority attacks in UU. Bisharp's Sucker Punch, Mamoswine's Ice Shard, and Mimikyu and Doublade's Shadow Sneak can all pick Celebi off after it's been chipped. Scizor's Choice Band-boosted Bullet Punch doesn't deal super effective damage but can power through Celebi in two hits after Stealth Rock, allowing it to successfully take it on if it hasn't set up.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is a reliable STAB move with great neutral coverage. When Psychium Z is activated, it turns into a powerful Shattered Psyche that, when boosted, OHKOes offensive variants of Scizor after Stealth Rock damage. It also reliably powers through various Pokemon that could tank a hit from full and punish Celebi, like Rotom-H, Kyurem, Moltres, and Togekiss. Giga Drain allows Celebi to stay healthy throughout a match, recovering any residual damage it takes while pressuring Ground- and Water-types like Hippowdon and Crawdaunt. Leaf Storm is an option over Giga Drain for its greater damage output against bulkier foes, allowing Celebi to immediately threaten Suicune and bulky Primarina sets more effectively. If running Leaf Storm, Celebi should opt for Recover in its fourth slot in order to maintain longevity throughout a match. Alongside Grassium Z, Leaf Storm becomes an immensely powerful Bloom Doom after a boost, allowing Celebi to hit even targets that resist it like Hydreigon and Bisharp for a potential OHKO after Stealth Rock damage while improving its one-on-one matchup against Blissey. Dazzling Gleam is Celebi's best option if running Psychium Z, allowing it to hit otherwise reliable checks in Hydreigon and Latias for super effective damage. Recover is primarily used alongside Leaf Storm to maintain longevity, improving Celebi's matchup against Blissey and most defensive teams by extension. It is still an option when Celebi is using Psychium Z, however, for providing more reliable staying power than Giga Drain. This leaves Celebi unable to beat Hydreigon, though. Hidden Power Fire allows Celebi to lure and take out Scizor without using a Z-Move, giving it more freedom to run Colbur Berry. It should be noted, however, that this usually ends up costing more valuable coverage and often requires Celebi to slowly work around checks like Hydreigon through chip damage with its STAB moves on the switch, which is a less reliable strategy. On Psychium Z sets, U-turn can be used over Dazzling Gleam to generate momentum off its common switches in like Latias and Scizor for a teammate to take advantage of.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Psychium Z allows Celebi to power through bulkier targets more easily with Shattered Psyche. Grassium Z provides Celebi with a strong nuke in Bloom Doom that it can use to blow past Hydreigon in offensive matchups while, alongside Recover, taking on Blissey and bulky Steel-types like Mega Aggron more reliably in defensive matchups, powering through them after multiple boosts. While this worsens Celebi's matchups against Scizor, Latias, Togekiss, and Moltres, it can still overwhelm the likes of Rotom-H and Gligar quite easily. If a Z-Crystal is used elsewhere on the team, Celebi can opt for Colbur Berry as its item, easing its matchup against Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Krookodile and allowing it to avoid heavy damage from Pursuit. Natural Cure allows Celebi to absorb status from defensive Pokemon, further strengthening its stallbreaking capabilities.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Celebi can most easily come in on defensive Ground- and Water-type Pokemon, such as Empoleon, Hippowdon, and Alomomola, in order to set up. Despite Natural Cure, it should be wary of getting inflicted with Toxic on the switch so as not to hinder its chances of setting up and maintaining a sweep. Recover can help with this somewhat if it's being run, though Celebi should still switch out of play relatively early if inflicted with status before setting up. Some offensive Pokemon that Celebi can force out, such as Feraligatr, Primarina, and Nidoking, also make decent setup targets, though their ability to hit Celebi hard with a strong STAB attack or super effective coverage makes this a less reliable strategy. A few defensive Pokemon run moves that can damage Celebi a fair amount, meaning it should scout their movesets before attempting to use them as setup fodder. The main examples in this case are Tentacruel and Gligar, which can both dent Celebi with Sludge Bomb and U-turn, respectively. If Psychium Z is being run, it should be activated against Scizor, which is usually KOed from full after Stealth Rock chip damage unless it's a bulky variant. It can also be used to power through various Pokemon that otherwise wouldn't drop to Celebi's attacks in one hit, like Gligar, Togekiss, Rotom-H, and if Celebi isn't running Dazzling Gleam, Mega Altaria and Kyurem. Shattered Psyche can also be used to do a decent amount of damage to some of Celebi's common Steel-type checks, like Doublade and Klefki, chipping them into range of another attack or weakening them for a teammate to finish off. Grassium Z is slightly more layered in its uses than Psychium Z, given that it has different applications depending on the matchup. When Blissey is on the opposing team, Celebi should do its best to preserve Grassium Z, as if Blissey switches in as it sets up, Celebi can power through it through the careful combination of further setup, a well-timed Z-Move, and using Leaf Storm to finish Blissey off after chipping it down. Should Blissey use Toxic as Celebi further sets up or if Celebi is low on HP, Celebi should use Recover as needed during this process. In more offensive matchups, Bloom Doom should be used to power through some of Celebi's conventional offensive blanket checks, like Hydreigon and Bisharp, while generally functioning as a strong, perfectly accurate nuke against targets that don't resist it. It can also be used to chip down Steel-type checks barring Scizor to an even larger extent than Psychium Z, often improving Celebi's one-on-one matchups against them. One should note that, since Celebi needs to forgo Dazzling Gleam for Recover alongside Leaf Storm for longevity, its Latias matchup will be quite a bit weaker. If running Colbur Berry, Celebi should use the item to ease prediction against Dark-type Pokemon. It doesn't need to worry as much about Krookodile and Hydreigon wielding Choice Scarf, allowing it to more easily bypass the former using Giga Drain or the latter with Dazzling Gleam. If Celebi isn't running Dazzling Gleam, it should work more carefully around Hydreigon, chipping it on the switch with Grass-type STAB moves and relying on teammates to adequately wear it down or outright remove it. Depending on Celebi's moveset and item selection, situational checks should be removed before it attempts sweeping. If opting for U-turn, it should be used often to chip down Hydreigon and Latias while getting partners into a favorable position to remove them for Celebi to sweep. If it doesn't have the coverage necessary to beat Hydreigon on its own, for instance, Hydreigon should be removed or weakened by a teammate prior to setup. Pokemon capable of outrunning and overwhelming Celebi, like Mega Aerodactyl, Nihilego, Infernape, and Terrakion, should also be removed from play in order to minimize its chances of getting revenge killed. Natural Cure should be used to pivot in on predicted status moves from various defensive Pokemon, such as Klefki's Thunder Wave and Swampert's Toxic, allowing Celebi to act as a decent status absorber for its team. If a Pursuit user like Mega Aerodactyl or Krookodile is on the opposing team, Celebi should do its best to preserve health with Recover in order to force mind games with them, making it much harder to get trapped and KOed. This is particularly important in stall matchups, as usually Pursuit is the only method of counterplay to Celebi found on defensive builds. It can also do this with Giga Drain if it isn't running Recover, though not as reliably.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Celebi is a comfortable fit on offensive and balance teams alike thanks to its simultaneous abilities to sweep, wallbreak, and stallbreak with Nasty Plot. Entry hazard support is extremely important in allowing Celebi to achieve various KOs, such as the OHKO on Scizor with +2 Shattered Psyche after Stealth Rock. This makes Stealth Rock setters like Mega Steelix, Cobalion, and Nihilego reliable options as teammates. Krookodile is particularly helpful, as in addition to providing Stealth Rock support, it can run Pursuit to handle Latias and Gengar for Celebi while using Knock Off to remove items like Choice Scarf from Hydreigon and opposing Krookodile, preventing them from reliably revenge killing Celebi. Tentacruel is another solid option for a teammate, as it can pivot in on Fire- and Poison-type attacks for Celebi, provide Rapid Spin support, and use Toxic Spikes to help improve Celebi's already strong stall matchup. It also provides a strong check to a few Fighting-types that Celebi can't reliably check on its own, like Infernape and Cobalion. Celebi's average Speed for an offensive Pokemon makes Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Krookodile, and Nihilego good options for teammates, as they can revenge kill the fast Pokemon often used to pick Celebi off. Other types of revenge killers, like Choice Band Scizor and Mimikyu, can also accomplish this. Dark-type checks like Cobalion and Mega Altaria can ease Celebi's uneasy matchups against Pokemon like Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Mega Sharpedo. Both Pokemon also appreciate Celebi's ability to muscle past Amoonguss and Moltres, while the latter also enjoys Celebi's ability to weaken most Steel-types a fair amount. Steel-type checks like Volcanion, Nidoqueen, and Mega Blastoise can also be helpful teammates through their ability to help Celebi more easily overwhelm checks like Mega Aggron, Doublade, and Klefki. Pursuit support from Krookodile, Alolan Muk, Mega Aerodactyl, and Bisharp eases Celebi's matchup against opposing Celebi, Latias, and Gengar. Pivots like Scizor, Gligar, and Moltres can reliably bring Celebi into play, letting it avoid directly switching in to stay healthy as it sets up. Scizor and Gligar can lure in several Water-types, like Alomomola and Suicune, for Celebi to set up on, while Moltres can lure another easy setup target in Rhyperior. Some Pokemon have weaker stall matchups and thus appreciate Celebi's ability to take on defensive teams relatively well. Examples include Mimikyu, Suicune, and Choice item variants of Hydreigon. Pokemon that have trouble breaking Water- or Ground-types, like Doublade and Mega Manectric, respectively, also enjoy Celebi for its ability to take most on quite reliably.</p>"

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Sceptile has a unique set of perks over the tier's other Mega Evolutions that make it an effective revenge killer, cleaner, and offensive check to the tier's many Water- , Ground-, and Electric-types. Chief among these are its exceptional Special Attack and Speed stats, which enable it to threaten many offensive teams with its powerful STAB moves; its Grass / Dragon typing, which allows it to function as a decent check to Pokemon such as Suicune, Latias, and Hippowdon; and its ability in Lighting Rod, which makes it a uniquely potent offensive answer to Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Zeraora. These traits make it quite an effective tool on offense against opposing offensive teams that lack a strong defensive presence and render it difficult to switch into consistently without a specially bulky Pokemon. That said, Mega Sceptile can nevertheless be quite easy to check both offensively and defensively. Choice Scarf users, strong priority attackers, Pursuit trappers, and the ubiquitous Mega Aerodactyl all exploit Mega Sceptile's frailty and common weaknesses, while most specially bulky Pokemon have the typing, natural bulk, or both required to switch into Mega Sceptile's attacks consistently. It is also helplessly walled by most of the tier's defensive Fairy-types, making it tough to use in the face of common threats such as Mega Altaria, Florges, and Togekiss. It also relies heavily on punishable moves in Leaf Storm, Focus Blast, and the very weak Hidden Power Fire to do significant damage and cannot fit all of its ideal coverage onto a single set, giving it a mild case of four-moveslot syndrome. This makes it tough to optimize for teams and relatively easy to position an offensive check against it. These setbacks leave Mega Sceptile quite helpless in a number of matchups despite its upsides and relatively awkward to fit onto teams due to both its numerous downsides compared to other Mega Evolutions and its covering of roles easily filled by other, non-Mega Pokemon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute can take advantage of the many switches Mega Sceptile forces and make it tougher to revenge kill, but it can prove to be a waste of HP if a defensive check such as Togekiss is still around. Protect can also be used to scout what common threats like Choice locked Scizor and Hydreigon lock themselves into to act accordingly. Both options can be used in conjunction with Leech Seed to annoy Mega Sceptile's switch-ins and soften walls for a teammate while regaining some recovery, but having only two easily walled attacks can prove extremely exploitable in the face of offensive threats such as Scizor and Mega Altaria. Mixed attacking Mega Sceptile can act as a functional lure to Togekiss and Mega Altaria with Iron Tail. In doing so, however, it must sacrifice one of Hidden Power Fire, Focus Blast, or its secondary Grass-type STAB move, limiting its effectiveness to those threats specifically and making it worse in other matchups. Swords Dance Mega Sceptile has a better matchup versus certain stall archetypes than standard Mega Sceptile, but it is generally outclassed as a physical Grass-type wallbeaker by Tsareena, which doesn't cost a Mega slot and is significantly stronger. Its mediocre Attack stat for a Mega Evolution also means it is helplessly weak unboosted and tougher to use in offensive matchups, where it generally has fewer setup opportunities.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Mega Sceptile is hard walled by the tier's most popular Fairy-types, as they not only are immune to Dragon Pulse but also generally resist Grass. It is therefore a sitting duck versus Togekiss and Mega Altaria, two very dangerous Pokemon to give free turns to, and it must play aggressively around Klefki with Earthquake or Hidden Power Fire to do any sort of damage to it. Despite taking neutral damage from Grass-type moves, Florges and Sylveon have the raw bulk to come in consistently on Leaf Storm, force Sceptile out, and heal up.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types and Ice-type coverage</strong>: Mega Sceptile's frailty and 4x weakness to Ice means it will be decimated by virtually any Ice-type attack. Mamoswine can therefore revenge kill it quite handily with Ice Shard, despite being slower, while Mega Manectric can nail it with Hidden Power Ice if it predicts correctly.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Though they must watch out for Mega Sceptile's potential coverage options, Steel-types wall Mega Sceptile's STAB combination and can take advantage of it after a Special Attack drop from Leaf Storm. Scizor and Cobalion can set up on a -2 Mega Sceptile if it lacks Hidden Power Fire or Earthquake, respectively, while Klefki, Mega Aggron, and Mega Steelix can either fire off a free attack or set up entry hazards as Mega Sceptile switches out.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Most of the tier's viable Pursuit trappers threaten Mega Sceptile, making it extremely susceptible to being trapped by the likes of Alolan Muk, Mega Aerodactyl, Assault Vest Bisharp, and Choice Band Scizor, especially if it has gone for Leaf Storm.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Strong Priority</strong>: Mega Sceptile is exceptionally fast, but not enough for it to not be outsped by Mega Aerodactyl and most Choice Scarf users, most notably Hydreigon. It is also quite easily taken out by Scizor's Bullet Punch, Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and Mamoswine's Ice Shard, the latter of which OHKOes it invariably thanks to its 4x weakness to Ice.</p>",

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leaf Storm grants Mega Sceptile crucial nuking ability, doing heavy damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it and, letting it function as a revenge killer in exchange for lowering its Special Attack two stages upon use. Dragon Pulse is Mega Sceptile's Dragon-type STAB move, which, in addition to its strong neutral coverage, lets it act as an offensive check to the likes of Latias and Hydreigon. This neutral coverage is key against foes such as Moltres, Rotom-H, and Gengar, as it would lack broad coverage with Grass-type moves alone. Earthquake allows Mega Sceptile to hit Empoleon, Klefki, and Alolan Muk super effectively. Giga Drain can be run to grant Mega Sceptile a form of recovery and a Grass-type move it can use without the drawbacks of Leaf Storm. Hidden Power Fire gives Mega Sceptile the ability to hit Steel-types, most notably hitting Scizor for 4x damage, and makes it more difficult to switch in directly. Focus Blast is much stronger than Hidden Power Fire against Steel-types weak to Fighting, most notably OHKOing Cobalion and Bisharp as well as 2HKOing Mega Aggron. In exchange, it is notoriously inaccurate and much less reliable against Steel-types that take neutral damage from Fighting-type moves, namely Scizor and Klefki. Energy Ball can be used to grant Mega Sceptile crucial OHKOs and 2HKOs without having to use Leaf Storm. Notably, Energy Ball allowing it to OHKO Alomomola after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Suicune if it has used Calm Mind on your first Energy Ball.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature is used to allow Mega Sceptile to outspeed Mega Manectric, Zeraora, and Crobat, as well as Speed tie with Mega Beedrill. Lightning Rod is an extremely useful tool and is crucial to Mega Sceptile's success, as the threat of a free Special Attack boost makes Electric-types think twice before using their STAB moves.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Mega Sceptile's blazing Speed to revenge kill key offensive threats such as Latias, Mega Manectric, and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon after they have been put in KO range of its attacks. This is best accomplished by getting entry hazards up early and often with a teammate, as chip damage is generally needed to put most threats in range. For example, unboosted Latias needs to switch into Stealth Rock twice before it is cleanly OHKOed by Dragon Pulse and Mega Manectric needs to switch into Stealth Rock once to be OHKOed by Leaf Storm. Mega Sceptile has decent defensive utility despite its frailty thanks to its resistances and Lightning Rod; take advantage of this by switching in on predicted status moves such as Wish and Stealth Rock, as well as predicted Water- and Ground-type attacks from passive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Slowbro, for an opportunity to fire off an attack. Don't do this too liberally, though, as this will lead to Mega Sceptile being worn down very quickly, and it can be caught off guard with a predicted Ice Beam from Pokemon like Mega Slowbro if it comes in too predictably without scouting. Despite Lightning Rod effectively deterring Electric-type attacks, especially Volt Switch, the generally offensive nature of Electric-types makes them trickier to switch into for Mega Sceptile than predicted Scalds from Swampert, as they will generally carry hard-hitting coverage to pressure it and prevent it from switching in unpunished. Zeraora can do major damage to Mega Sceptile with Close Combat, while Mega Manectric can simply remove it from the game with Hidden Power Ice. For these reasons, Mega Sceptile should ideally only come in versus these Pokemon on a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, a double switch, an aggressive prediction, or after a teammate has been KOed, so as to minimize unnecessary damage. Many of the Pokemon Sceptile is capable of switching into, such as Hippowdon and Alomomola will often carry Toxic, making it risky to consistently switch directly into them. It is therefore ideal to bring Mega Sceptile in against these Pokemon on a slow U-turn or with precise prediction. Play aggressively early-game around Mega Sceptile's switch-ins and predict them with either your coverage moves or double switching. Despite the high risk of aggressive prediction, simply attacking what's in front of you is often a losing game due to how dangerous it is to give free turns to Mega Sceptile's most common switch-ins. The many switches Sceptile forces by virtue of its Speed and power are useful in this regard for gaining favorable positioning early on for offensive teams. Be careful when using Leaf Storm, as most of the tier can exploit a Mega Sceptile after the Special Attack drop. It should generally only be used if the added power is needed to KO what is in front of Mega Sceptile or if you need to wear down whatever is coming in on it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Sceptile fits best on more offensive teams that appreciate a fast revenge killer and a means of annoying teams that rely on the offensive presence of Electric-types or the defensive presence of bulky Water- and Ground-types. Scizor pairs brilliantly with Mega Sceptile, as not only can Scizor scare out most of Mega Sceptile's checks with Bullet Punch and bring it in for free with U-turn, either Pokemon can set the stage for the other to clean late-game by softening up the other's checks. Other pivots capable of bringing in Mega Sceptile on their own checks include Gligar, Rotom-H, and Moltres. Spikes support from Klefki is extremely useful for putting foes in range of Mega Sceptile's attacks, and its defensive typing allows you to fall back in the face of threats such as Calm Mind Latias and Mega Beedrill that Mega Sceptile cannot reliably revenge kill. Klefki also provides invaluable Thunder Wave support to cripple Mega Sceptile's offensive checks and open the door for it to clean late-game. In general, Steel-types are very proficient at handling Pokemon that are problematic for Mega Sceptile. Scizor, Doublade, and Cobalion all cover Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Altaria, Mamoswine, Togekiss, and Latias to some capacity. Scizor and Cobalion can also wallbreak for Mega Sceptile with Swords Dance, easing its matchup versus bulky teams. Wallbreakers are crucial for teams carrying Mega Sceptile, so it can potentially clean up late-game as well as capitalize on its revenge killing ability. Terrakion, Mamoswine, Gengar, and Infernape all synergize well with Mega Sceptile in this way. Offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Nidoqueen, Cobalion, and Krookodile put heavy pressure on opposing Fairy- and Steel-types. In return, Mega Sceptile can very capably support them by being an offensive answer to Water- and Ground-types. Mega Sceptile is extremely fast and therefore an effective revenge killer, but it should rarely, if ever, be the fastest Pokemon on your team due to how easily it is revenge killed itself. Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Hydreigon can compensate for this deficiency and prevent faster threats from walking over your team while also providing crucial team support with Defog, U-turn, and in the case of Krookodile, Pursuit.</p>"

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Swampert is a very sturdy physically defensive Pokemon thanks to its great typing and bulk, which allows it to match up well against a lot of common Pokemon in the metagame like Mega Aerodactyl, Cobalion, and Bisharp. Its typing also gives it a resistance to Stealth Rock, which in combination with Leftovers further boosts its sustainability and gives it the opportunity to switch in often and set up Stealth Rock or whittle down the opposing team with Toxic. Swampert's edge over the other defensive Ground-types in the tier lies in its decent offensive stats and access to Scald, allowing it to threaten common Ground-immune Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres more easily as well as giving it the ability to run a fully offensive set. Access to moves like Roar can also prove to be a nuisance for Pokemon like Scizor and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria that could try to take advantage of Swampert. However, Swampert has a hard time checking the Pokemon it's supposed to like Zeraora, Infernape, and Nihilego, as they usually carry Grass-type coverage. Swampert also lacks any form of reliable recovery, which means that it's prone to being worn down if not used carefully. These aforementioned traits mean that Swampert faces heavy competition from Hippowdon and Gligar, which have access to reliable recovery and don't have to face the constraints of the Water typing, so they're much more consistent answers to the aforementioned threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Normalium Z can be used with Refresh in order to provide Swampert with a one-time recovery to full HP. Refresh can also come in handy to cure Swampert of any status conditions. However, it has a very big opportunity cost because it means no other Pokemon on the team can use a Z-Crystal, and the passive recovery provided by Leftovers is usually more useful in the long run anyway. Counter is a viable option on the defensive set, allowing Swampert to punish U-turn users like Scizor and Mega Beedrill, but it's very team dependent and has much more limited uses than Toxic or Roar. Similarly, Mirror Coat can be used to punish special wallbreakers like Latias and Choice Specs Primarina that would normally attempt to take advantage of Swampert's low Special Defense stat, but it faces the same issues as Counter. Protect is another move that could be used in the last slot of the defensive set, providing Swampert with more turns of Leftovers recovery and the ability to scout for Choice-locked Pokemon like Hydreigon and Primarina. However, this leaves Swampert completely walled by many setup sweepers and other common threats such as Latias and Mega Altaria, making it a very suboptimal option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Grass-types such as Celebi, Amoonguss, Tsareena, and Rotom-C can easily switch into any of Swampert's moves and threaten to OHKO it with their STAB attacks. Tsareena and Rotom-C can also attempt to remove Swampert's Stealth Rock from the field. Additionally, Pokemon that usually carry Grass-type moves such as Zeraora, Infernape, and Nihilego can heavily pressure Swampert, but they can't switch in.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Pokemon like Hydreigon and Latias can easily switch into Swampert, only having to fear Toxic or a Choice Band-boosted Ice Punch, and can threaten it with a powerful Draco Meteor. They can also use Defog to remove Swampert's Stealth Rock from the field. Kyurem is another Dragon-type that can easily switch in and fire off powerful attacks, but it dislikes being hit by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Swampert relies on Leftovers to be healthy, and status ailments like poison and burn can nullify that passive recovery that it provides and make it even more prone to being worn down than it already is.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to its low Special Defense stat, Pokemon like Primarina, Starmie, and Mega Blastoise can heavily threaten Swampert with their strong special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: CroCune is the best counter for Swampert, as it can easily switch into any of its attacks and use Rest to escape from Toxic damage. RestTalk Primarina can easily switch into any attacks from the defensive set and threaten Swampert with a potential Scald burn, while bulky Starmie can cure itself from Toxic with Natural Cure and remove Swampert's Stealth Rock from the field with Rapid Spin. However, they can be caught off guard by the Choice Band set, which can 2HKO or OHKO them with Earthquake. On the other hand, Pokemon like Slowbro and Alomomola can switch into the Choice Band set's attacks, but they have to fear being hit by Toxic.</p>",

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Scald is used to hit Ground-immune Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres while also potentially crippling Pokemon like Scizor and Crawdaunt with a burn. Toxic cripples Pokemon that would otherwise wall Swampert like Hydreigon, Chesnaught, and Latias. However, Roar can prevent Pokemon like Latias and Nasty Plot Togekiss from using it as setup fodder.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Swampert can be worn down very quickly due to the lack of reliable recovery, so Leftovers is the best item it can run. Torrent allows Swampert to benefit from being worn down by boosting the power of its Scald once it's at a low HP. Physically defensive investment is chosen over investment in Special Defense because Swampert would still be unable to check most special wallbreakers anyway.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The most important thing to note when using Swampert is that it lacks any form of reliable recovery. This means that it must be used much more carefully than Pokemon like Hippowdon and Gligar, since it can be easily overwhelmed. It's advised not to switch Swampert into every possible attack, even if it's capable of tanking it, as that would prevent it from effectively checking what it's supposed to. It should also avoid switching into a potential Toxic or Knock Off from Pokemon like Empoleon and Tentacruel for the same reason, as it relies on Leftovers to be healthy. Only switch into Pokemon that Swampert can comfortably check like Mega Aerodactyl and Rotom-H and attempt to set up Stealth Rock or weaken the opposing team with its other attacks. It should beware of status from Rotom-H, however. If Swampert's health starts getting very low, proactive play is recommended in order to get it on the field as often as possible and rack up Leftovers recovery. Be wary of Grass-type coverage from Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Nihilego whenever attempting to switch into them, as they can easily dent Swampert or outright OHKO it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Swampert fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to check a lot of Pokemon in the tier and keep Stealth Rock up against common entry hazard removers like Rotom-H and Empoleon. Pokemon that can sponge Grass-type attacks like Hydreigon, Moltres, Mega Altaria, and Amoonguss make the best partners for Swampert, as those are the main way to defeat it. Mega Altaria is a particularly good teammate, since it can take advantage of Natural Cure in its regular form to absorb Amoonguss's Spore, which would otherwise be able to easily switch into Swampert and cripple a member of its team. Wish support from Pokemon like Blissey and Sylveon helps Swampert by increasing its longevity, as it's prone to being worn down. Cleric support is equally appreciated, since status ailments can negate Leftovers recovery and wear it down over time. Thus, Pokemon like Togekiss, Blissey, and Florges pair well with Swampert. Fairy-types like the aforementioned Florges and Togekiss can also provide a switch-in to Dragon-type Pokemon like Latias, Mega Sceptile, and Hydreigon, which can easily switch into Swampert and threaten it with their powerful STAB attacks. In return, Swampert does a good job at keeping most Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Empoleon in check. Spikes and Toxic Spikes are another way to hurt Swampert's durability, so entry hazard removers like Tentacruel and Rotom-H are very good teammates as well. Pokemon that appreciate Stealth Rock being set such as Terrakion and Lucario also pair well with Swampert.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Punch is used to hit Pokemon that would otherwise wall this set completely, such as Hydreigon, Latias, Celebi, and Rotom-C. Toxic allows Swampert to cripple Pokemon that it's unable to 2HKO like Alomomola and Slowbro, as the residual damage is usually enough to put them in range of a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake, but Superpower could also be used in the last slot, allowing Swampert to OHKO Pokemon like Blissey and Hydreigon. Superpower is also helpful for hitting some Earthquake targets like Empoleon and Cobalion, easing prediction.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given spread allows Swampert to outspeed Modest Primarina and uninvested Scizor, meaning it can hit them before they attack it or switch out with U-turn. Since Swampert is prone to being worn down, Torrent is the preferred ability, since it boosts the power of its Waterfall once it's at a low amount of health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The difference between Choice Band Swampert and the other offensive Ground-types is that it has a lot more opportunities to come in and fire off attacks thanks to its amazing defensive typing and bulk, so that must be used to its advantage by bringing it in often, especially against Pokemon that it can naturally check like Rotom-H and Mega Aggron. Making aggressive predictions is advised, since the idea behind this set is to take advantage of the surprise factor and take advantage of Pokemon that would normally attempt to take on the defensive set like Amoonguss and Primarina. Furthermore, Choice Band forces Swampert to lock itself into one move, so not making the necessary predictions can cause a big loss of momentum. Ice Punch should be the primary move used early-game, because it hits most of Swampert's conventional checks like Hydreigon and Celebi for a lot of damage, whereas Toxic is only meant to be used on Pokemon that Swampert isn't capable of breaking through, such as Alomomola and Chesnaught. Avoid using it in any other circumstances, however, since Swampert can be taken advantage of once it's locked into it. Once it has weakened its own checks, Swampert is free to start utilizing its powerful Choice Band-boosted STAB attacks, weakening the opposing team even further and making room for a cleaner to come in later on and sweep. It should be noted that Choice Band Swampert isn't as durable as the defensive set, as it doesn't have the same defensive investment or Leftovers recovery, meaning that it should be played more carefully, especially against threats like Terrakion and Scizor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Swampert finds itself most comfortable on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to break through the opposing team and provide an immunity to Volt Switch. Swampert can easily punch holes in teams and break through defensive cores, so cleaners that can make use of that like Double Dance Cobalion and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria are very good partners for it. Pokemon that can check Grass-types such as Hydreigon and Gengar also pair well with Swampert, as it's threatened by them a lot. Swampert is a relatively bulky Pokemon, but it shouldn't be used as the main check to Pokemon like Terrakion and Cobalion due to the lack of defensive investment. Thus, adequate checks to those Pokemon like Doublade, Latias, and Moltres make good teammates. Entry hazard setters like Terrakion, Nihilego, and Klefki can slightly improve Swampert's wallbreaking capabilities by ensuring a 2HKO or an OHKO on certain Pokemon. It has a good chance to OHKO Hydreigon with Ice Punch if Stealth Rock is on the field, for example. Additionally, Klefki can also cripple the opposing team with Thunder Wave, alleviating the effects of Swampert's low Speed.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swampert's combination of STAB moves and Ice Punch hits hard and threatens Defoggers like Rotom-H, Gligar, and Hydreigon. Additionally, Ice Punch covers more Pokemon that would otherwise bother Swampert like Latias and Celebi.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EVs provided allow Swampert to outpace Pokemon with uninvested base 80 Speed like defensive Mega Altaria. Life Orb gives Swampert a significant boost, letting it OHKO Cobalion with Earthquake. Life Orb's recoil helps activate Torrent to make Waterfall OHKO Hippowdon and offensive Scizor after Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swampert sets up Stealth Rock easily by forcing out common Pokemon like Mega Manectric lacking Hidden Power Grass, Cobalion, and Hippowdon. To keep Stealth Rock up, it should aggressively call out switches and stay-ins as its coverage for common entry hazard removers like Empoleon and Tentacruel is strong. It can also lure Pokemon like Mega Altaria and Celebi in and nail them with Ice Punch. While Swampert has a good defensive typing, it should switch into Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and offensive Rotom-H sparingly due to its lack of investment in bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Offensive Swampert fits nicely into teams that value its wallbreaking potential as a Stealth Rock setter and its good defensive typing to check foes like Mega Aerodactyl. On entry hazard-stacking teams, Klefki and Froslass provide Spikes and appreciate Swampert beating hazard removers Rotom-H and Gligar. Spikes also helps Swampert remove Amoonguss with Ice Punch and facilitates a sweep from Pokemon like Mega Sharpedo and Swords Dance Mimikyu. Swampert itself supports Mega Sharpedo and Mimikyu by heavily damaging bulky Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix. Other sweepers like Dragon Dance Mega Altaria and Swords Dance Scizor are also more threatening with hazard support. In return, Mega Altaria and Scizor are adequate answers for Grass-types like Celebi and Rotom-C. Bisharp makes for a strong Defog deterrent and capitalizes on Swampert checking Pokemon like Cobalion and Mega Aerodactyl. Both Scizor and Bisharp appreciate Swampert answering Rotom-H. Swampert is unable to get past bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Alolmomola, so Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Calm Mind Latias are helpful.</p>"

Specifically, 196 Speed EVs allow Linoone to outspeed Pokemon such as Tsareena, Chandelure, and Mega Blastoise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Cobalion, Doublade, Steelix, and Scizor are able to reliably take any attack from Linoone and KO or heavily damage it in return.</p> <p><strong>Faster Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Cobalion, and Terrakion cannot be OHKOed by +6 Extreme Speed and OHKO Linoone in return.

      "Belly Drum Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Belly Drum increases Linoone's Attack to +6, which makes it an extremely powerful offensive threat. Extreme Speed is a strong +2 priority STAB attack that OHKOes Pokemon such as Latias, Infernape, and Hydreigon after a boost from Belly Drum. Linoone also has great coverage moves that allow it to break through Normal-resistant walls: Seed Bomb, which lets Linoone break through bulky Water-types like Swampert, Suicune, and Quagsire that are not OHKOed by +6 Extreme Speed, and Stomping Tantrum, which allows Linoone to damage slow and bulky Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix; however, it does not OHKO them even at +6.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>16 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Bisharp so Linoone can OHKO it with Stomping Tantrum. Linoone also Speed ties with Timid Primarina and Jolly Bewear. The HP, Defense, and Special Defense EVs make it so Linoone survives Mega Aerodactyl's Stone Edge, Latias's Draco Meteor, and Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock. The defensive investment also allows it to survive Hydreigon's Draco Meteor and Choice Band Scizor's U-turn from full HP. A Figy Berry combined with Gluttony allows Linoone to use Belly Drum once and completely recover all of the lost HP or take any one hit that would not OHKO it and gives it enough HP to use Belly Drum.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Linoone is only used as a late-game sweeper. For Linoone to be an effective sweeper, all faster threats that are immune to or resist Extreme Speed must be KOed or severely weakened. These threats include fast Ghost-types like Gengar, Steel-types like Cobalion, and Rock-types like Mega Aerodactyl. Linoone should not switch directly into any attacks or offensive threats. Instead, bring it in to set up either after a teammate has fainted or with the support of a Volt Switch or U-turn user against Pokemon that cannot OHKO Linoone.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Linoone is most effective on hyper offense. Specifically, Linoone thrives on dual screens offense due to the increased number of setup opportunities the playstyle provides. Azelf and Xatu are the only viable dual screens setters in the tier, so they make good partners. Linoone is very frail, so checks to Fighting-types, such as Latias and Mega Altaria, pair very well with it. Scizor threatens Linoone greatly, so checks to it such as Chandelure and Feraligatr make good partners. Choice Scarf Chandelure is particularly useful because it can use Memento to help Linoone set up. Linoone also appreciates support from stallbreakers like Lucario and Mega Altaria that weaken walls and allow Linoone to clean more easily. Fighting-types like Terrakion, Cobalion, and Infernape also pair nicely with Linoone because they are able to beat the Rock- and Steel-types that check it. Mega Manectric is a good teammate for Linoone because it can pressure physical attackers with Intimidate, check Steel-types, and use Volt Switch to bring Linoone in safely.</p>"

  "Aggron": {
    "overview": "<p>Aggron sees considerable improvements in multiple key areas upon Mega Evolution, making it a solid pick in the UU metagame. Most notably, its Defense stat boosts to a gargantuan base 230, pairing nicely with its solid defensive typing in Steel and making it a strong answer to Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Filter makes for a fantastic ability, helping it against super effective attackers like Krookodile and Cobalion. Even uninvested, Mega Aggron's base 140 Attack stat gives it respectable offensive presence for a more bulk-oriented Pokemon, especially when combined with its naturally powerful Heavy Slam and nice coverage options in Earthquake and Fire Punch. However, its HP and Special Defense stats are rather mediocre, limiting its overall effectiveness as a tank. Additionally, Mega Aggron has no passive or reliable recovery, making it easily worn down over the course of a match. Mega Steelix also poses stiff competition as a Steel-type Stealth Rock user due to its similar stats and immunity to Electric, though Mega Aggron does possess a better ability in Filter and a generally more useful defensive typing. Lastly, Mega Aggron faces poor one-on-one matchups against some Defog users such as Gligar, Moltres, Rotom-H, and Mew, which can pose formidable obstacles to keeping up Stealth Rock.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Curse is a solid option on the defensive set, letting it beat Defog Gligar one-on-one, although it is leaves Mega Aggron much more vulnerable to Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Rotom-H, Moltres, Volcanion, and Nasty Plot Infernape all outspeed Mega Aggron and nail it with their STAB moves, while fearing little outside of Toxic, and Earthquake in the case of Volcanion and Infernape. However, Stealth Rock can pressure them considerably.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Mega Slowbro, Alomomola, and Suicune wall Mega Aggron's attacking moves and threaten to burn it with Scald. While Toxic annoys the former two, Suicune can use Rest to cure itself of status conditions.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Gligar completely walls Mega Aggron's Stealth Rock set, removing its entry hazards with Defog and healing off the damage with Roost. Other bulky examples such as Mega Steelix, Seismitoad, and Hippowdon fear little from Mega Aggron's attacking moves and can perform their roles in front of it. Frailer Ground-types like Krookodile, Nidoking, and Mamoswine provide softer answers, but they are all capable of greatly pressuring Mega Aggron.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers like Hydreigon and Choice Specs Primarina can do significant damage to Mega Aggron, and they are capable of tanking at least one hit at full health.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Lacking any recovery, Mega Aggron finds itself easily worn down by entry hazards, most notably Spikes, burns, and various attacks over the course of a match.</p>",

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heavy Slam is Mega Aggron's STAB move of choice, maintaining high Base Power against much of the metagame due to Mega Aggron's substantial weight. Earthquake provides great coverage alongside Heavy Slam, most notably letting Mega Aggron punish entry hazard removers like Tentacruel and Empoleon while also hitting threats like Cobalion, Infernape, and Terrakion for significant damage. Fire Punch is an alternative coverage option that punishes a different group of Steel-types, allowing Mega Aggron to more effectively check Scizor, though it tends to be less useful than Earthquake overall. Toxic lets Mega Aggron pressure foes such as Hippowdon, Hydreigon, Rotom-H, and Moltres, which otherwise fear little from it. Likewise, Head Smash can be used to punish and remove the aforementioned Moltres and Rotom-H while also hitting the likes of Mantine, users that commonly come in to remove its Stealth Rock. Mega Aggron can also use Roar to phaze foes, helping to chip them down in combination with Stealth Rock, though Toxic is generally more useful.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Defense investment with a Careful nature gives Mega Aggron the best possible one-on-one matchup against threats such as Latias, Celebi, and Nihilego. Prior to Mega Evolution, Sturdy lets a full health Aggron act as an emergency revenge killer to a threatening sweeper if need be.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aggron's bulk, ability, and defensive typing all improve remarkably upon Mega Evolution, often making Mega Evolving a smart option upon initial entry. Prioritize getting up Stealth Rock early when facing foes such as Moltres and Rotom-H that are greatly hindered by its presence. Spread Toxic early- to mid-game on Pokemon like Hippowdon, Rotom-H, Mew, and Alomomola, which tend to be solid initial answers to Mega Aggron. Mew in particular being an important target as it can't synchronize back the poison, otherwise it easily keeps Mega Aggron's Stealth Rock off the field and can whittle it down with Will-O-Wisp and Seismic Toss. However, in these scenarios, be specifically careful in trying to cripple bulky Water-types like Mega Slowbro and Alomomola, as a Scald burn severely cripples Mega Aggron's longevity and overall effectiveness. As it is often worn down quickly, be sure to keep Mega Aggron healthy enough to handle a threat such as Mega Aerodactyl, Latias, or Scizor if necessary. When coming into Latias, scouting for Electrium Z is often a good option if your opponent uses Calm Mind when Mega Aggron has a high amount of health. If using Head Smash then it should be used on the anticipated switch in of Moltres and Rotom-H, it can also be important to not Mega Evolve in order to better take their Fire-type STAB moves and have access to a STAB Head Smash, which guarantees the OHKO on Rotom-H. Watch out for coverage moves that can deal significant damage to Mega Aggron such as Togekiss's Aura Sphere, Mega Altaria's Fire Blast, and Nihilego's Gigavolt Havoc. In the rare occasion that Aggron has not Mega Evolved and a weakened sweeper is getting out of hand, Sturdy lets Aggron act as a one-time check if it is at full health.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Aggron can fit on a variety of playstyles ranging from bulky offense to stall, all of which appreciate its defensive capabilities and effectiveness as a Stealth Rock setter. Wish support from users like Alomomola, Florges, and Sylveon is much appreciated, helping to counteract Mega Aggron's tendency to be worn down over time. Rotom-H and Nihilego make for effective Mega Aggron partners, taking on threats to it in Moltres and opposing Rotom-H, proceeding to gain momentum or use powerful attacks. Rotom-H may also relieve Mega Aggron of the need to run Fire Punch as a strong Scizor check in its own right. Grass-types like Tsareena and Celebi fit nicely, punishing bulky Water-types and taking full advantage of Mega Aggron's Stealth Rock support. Choice Scarf Krookodile takes some pressure off of Mega Aggron in dealing with key threats in Latias and Mega Aerodactyl, as well as acting as a solid answer to Mega Manectric; in return, Mega Aggron can spread Toxic onto some of Krookodile's most reliable answers like Hippowdon and Alomomola. Tentacruel, Gligar, Starmie, and Mantine provide entry hazard removal, most notably clearing Spikes that hinder Mega Aggron's longevity. All of them are able to take on the premier Fighting-types in the tier that threaten Mega Aggron while the Water-types can also pivot into the Fire-type coverage aimed at it. Dragon-types such as Latias and Hydreigon possess great overall synergy, as they can take on some of Mega Aggron's weaknesses as well as take advantage of Mew, and in return, Mega Aggron handles the Fairy-types that trouble them. Fighting-types like Infernape, Lucario, and Terrakion appreciate Mega Aggron's ability to handle Psychic- and bulky Fairy-types, and Mega Aggron can set Stealth Rock to aid them in their wallbreaking or sweeping efforts.</p>"

      "Curse": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Heavy Slam is Mega Aggron's preferred STAB move, possessing a high Base Power against most foes due to Mega Aggron's weight. Curse boosts Mega Aggron's Attack and Defense stats, allowing it to better combat threatening physical attackers such as Terrakion and Scizor. Rest provides means of healing off damage and curing itself of crippling burns, at the cost of putting itself to sleep for two turns. Sleep Talk lets Mega Aggron attack foes with Heavy Slam or further accumulate Curse boosts while asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and Special Defense EVs combined with a Careful nature minimize damage taken from threatening special attackers like Latias, Celebi, and Nihilego. If Aggron has not Mega Evolved and is at maximum HP, Sturdy guarantees that it can stomach one hit.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Curse Mega Aggron will rarely make progress early-game due to the prevalence of sturdy answers to it such as Rotom-H, Empoleon, and Moltres. To counteract this, weaken or remove these answers before starting to accumulate Curse boosts in the hopes of sweeping. While Curse Mega Aggron has less defensive utility overall, it can still be used to check Pokemon such as Latias and Mega Altaria solely by virtue of its defensive typing and use of Heavy Slam. Revealing RestTalk Curse Mega Aggron's set early on will often make the opponent realize the importance of keeping their answers healthy, so it is generally preferred to keep it under wraps until it is capable of doing meaningful damage. Additionally, while Rest may be necessary to keep Mega Aggron healthy, gauge when it is necessary to do so, as using it tends to give up large amounts of momentum. It is usually best to start using Curse while in advantageous positions like against Pokemon such as Gligar, Krookodile, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria that can deal little damage to it, especially after Mega Aggron starts increasing its Defense.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Curse Mega Aggron fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its role as a long-term wincon as well as a strong check to Pokemon like Latias, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Altaria. Grass- and Electric-types such as Tsareena, Celebi, and Zeraora stand out as strong partners, as they threaten bulky Water-types, some of Mega Aggron's sturdiest answers. Rotom-H also absorbs the Ground- and Fire-type moves aimed at Mega Aggron, effectively deals with Moltres, and uses Toxic to wear down Mega Aggron checks like Hippowdon and opposing Rotom-H. Due to lacking the move itself, Curse Mega Aggron teams need an alternate Stealth Rock setter. Options like Rhyperior and Nihilego check Fire-types like Rotom-H and Moltres, and Mega Aggron checks Latias for them in return. Primarina makes for a strong partner by checking Hydreigon and Infernape, and Mega Aggron can cover its weaknesses to Poison- and Grass-type moves in return. Latias offers some nice defensive synergy, taking little to no damage from Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type moves; Mega Aggron covers Fairy-, Ice-, and Bug-type moves for Latias. Fire- and Fighting-types such as Infernape, Cobalion, and Volcanion also make great partners, as they are able to break past the Steel-types that Mega Aggron struggles with, while Volcanion is also able to pivot into Water-types like Primarina and Mantine to break or whittle them down.</p>"

  "Manectric": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Manectric is one of the best offensive pivots and revenge killers in the metagame, and it is one of the best Mega Evolutions for VoltTurn teams. It is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, only being outsped by Zeraora, Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf users. Its access to strong Fire-type coverage moves like Overheat and Flamethrower in conjunction with Hidden Power Ice lets it pressure many of the Pokemon that resist or are immune to Volt Switch like Celebi, Mega Steelix, Gligar, and Hydreigon, which increases its overall effectiveness as an offensive pivot. Mega Manectric's ability Intimidate also contributes heavily to its success because it allows Mega Manectric to more easily take priority attacks like Scizor's Bullet Punch and Mamoswine's Ice Shard when revenge killing foes. Mega Manectric's typing allows it to heavily threaten opposing Water- and Flying-types like Togekiss, Mega Slowbro, and Tentacruel while also giving it some useful resistances that let it more easily take on Steel-types like Scizor and Klefki. However, its typing also gives it a weakness to Ground-type attacks from Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Hippowdon, and Mega Aerodactyl. In addition, its extremely subpar bulk and lack of recovery mean Mega Manectric is easily taken out by Choice Scarf users like Krookodile, Infernape, and Hydreigon if it takes too much residual damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Static can be considered as an ability for a Manectric in order to paralyze physical attackers before it Mega Evolves, but since Manectric does not appreciate taking hits, it will not get many chances to use it. Toxic is an option to hit Dragon- and Ground-types like Latias, Swampert, and Hippowdon.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Krookodile, and Hydreigon are capable of revenge killing or heavily damaging Mega Manectric if they get the chance to do so.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While most of them must fear a super effective Hidden Power Grass or Hidden Power Ice, Ground-types like Krookodile and Nidoqueen are capable of blocking Mega Manectric's Volt Switch and dealing super effective damage in return. Seismitoad, Rhyperior, Quagsire, and Swampert avoid taking significant damage from Hidden Power Ice, while Hippowdon fears nothing from Mega Manectric.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Hydreigon, Mega Altaria, and Latias all resist Mega Manectric's STAB attacks, although they take moderate damage from Hidden Power Ice and Hydreigon and Latias must watch out for Signal Beam. Kyurem is particularly troublesome, as it avoids the 2HKO from any of Mega Manectric's attacks from full.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mega Manectric switches in and out often and has no methods of recovery, so residual damage from Toxic poison, Stealth Rock, Spikes, and burns limits its usefulness throughout a match.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Blissey can easily take any of Mega Manectric's attacks. Blissey can wear Mega Manectric down with Toxic and Seismic Toss, while Alolan Muk can Pursuit trap Mega Manectric or heavily damage it with Gunk Shot or Poison Jab.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Volt Switch is Mega Manectric's primary STAB attack and the move it should aim to use the most throughout the course of a match, as it allows Mega Manectric to gain momentum for your team while dealing chip damage to foes. Overheat allows Mega Manectric to OHKO Pokemon like Celebi after Stealth Rock damage, Cobalion, and physically defensive Klefki at the cost of having low accuracy and halving Mega Manectric's Special Attack after use. Flamethrower is an alternative, more reliable Fire-type coverage move, but it loses out on the many KOs listed earlier. Thunderbolt is Mega Manectric's stronger STAB attack that it uses to KO Pokemon without needing to switch out afterwards. Thunderbolt also gains some KOs that Volt Switch does not, like OHKOing Alomomola and Slowbro after Stealth Rock damage. Hidden Power Ice lets Mega Manectric hit Ground- and Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Latias, Nidoqueen, Gligar, and Krookodile for super effective damage. Hidden Power Grass allows Mega Manectric to deal heavy damage to Ground-types like Swampert, Quagsire, and Rhyperior but loses out on hitting Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Latias. Alternatively, Signal Beam can be used in the last moveslot in order to hit Krookodile, Hydreigon, Celebi, and Latias harder than any other move, but this causes Mega Manectric to lose out on the ability to hit any other Ground-type super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature allows Mega Manectric to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding Pokemon like Crobat and Mega Pidgeot. Lightning Rod is the preferred ability before Manectric Mega Evolves, as it lets Manectric pivot into and block one predicted Volt Switch from Rotom-C, Zeraora, or opposing Mega Manectric to gain a boost to its Special Attack and shift momentum to your side. Intimidate is used frequently throughout a match in order to weaken physically offensive foes. Manectite gives Manectric the ability to Mega Evolve.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Manectric should use Volt Switch as much as possible to gain momentum for your team while also dealing damage. Volt Switch is also a generally safe middle-ground play for when you do not know whether your opponent will switch out or not, although you must be mindful of Ground-type switch-ins like Hippowdon, Gligar, and Krookodile, which block Volt Switch. Because of its subpar bulk, Mega Manectric should primarily be brought in with pivoting from fellow U-turn or Volt Switch users like Scizor and Hydreigon, and it can also be brought in on a free switch to attempt to revenge kill a slower foe like Cobalion or Scizor. Mega Manectric can be brought in on some weak predicted hits, however, such as a predicted Bullet Punch from a bulky Scizor, or on Electric-type attacks if not yet Mega Evolved. You can use Intimidate as a form of utility by sending Mega Manectric in on a physical attacker like Cobalion and then pivoting out in an attempt to weaken them for your other team members. Try to keep Mega Manectric as healthy as possible throughout a match because it lacks any way to regain health and needs to be as healthy as possible to revenge kill priority attackers such as Crawdaunt and offensive Scizor. This involves switching Mega Manectric in as few times as possible when there are entry hazards up, since they will wear it down very quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Manectric fits best on VoltTurn offense due to its nature as an offensive pivot and revenge killer, but it can also fit just generally on hyper offense and bulky offense. Other users of Volt Switch and U-turn like Scizor, Hydreigon, and Infernape make great partners for Mega Manectric because they can give it many opportunities to come in throughout the course of a match. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Cobalion and Krookodile and Spikes support from Klefki will make Mega Manectric's job of revenge killing much easier. Because of Mega Manectric's nature of switching in and out often, it enjoys entry hazard removal support from Pokemon like Starmie, Hydreigon, and Empoleon to keep Mega Manectric from taking too much residual damage. Wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Crawdaunt, and Lucario appreciate the free switches that Mega Manectric provides from Volt Switch in order to break defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Florges that Mega Manectric cannot. Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Starmie, and Primarina that are capable of damaging bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gligar, which would otherwise block Volt Switch, make good partners for Mega Manectric. If not opting for Hidden Power Grass, Grass-types like Celebi and Amoonguss are especially good partners, as they can break past Rhyperior and Water / Ground Pokemon like Swampert and Quagsire. Pursuit users like Krookodile, Scizor, and Bisharp can help to take out bulky Psychic-type Pokemon that resist Volt Switch like Latias and Celebi.</p>"

  "Sharpedo": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Sharpedo is a great late-game cleaner, utilizing both its pre-Mega ability in Speed Boost and its post-Mega ability in Strong Jaw to sweep. Its great Attack and Speed stats allow Mega Sharpedo to hit very hard and very fast at the same time, with Crunch severely damaging Pokemon such as Scizor and Mamoswine. Strong Jaw also boosts the Base Power of coverage moves like Ice Fang and Psychic Fangs, allowing Mega Sharpedo to hit would-be checks and counters, such as Mega Altaria, Heracross, and Hydreigon, very hard. Mega Sharpedo has terrible bulk and a defensive typing that gives it numerous weaknesses to common types like Fighting, Grass, and Bug, although it does resist a very important priority move in Bullet Punch. Said poor bulk means that if Mega Sharpedo doesn't OHKO what's in front of it, it will likely get OHKOed in return. It also faces great competition from other Mega Evolutions like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Altaria, both of which also have greater defensive utility and wider movepools. Finally, Mega Sharpedo struggles to break through bulky walls like Mega Aggron and Swampert without them being significantly weakened beforehand, which can stop a late-game sweep in its tracks. It also struggles to sweep without entry hazard support.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Waterfall is a Water-type STAB move that hits Mega Aerodactyl, Hippowdon, and Mega Houndoom, and can also flinch, but it hits fewer targets than Earthquake or Psychic Fangs. Liquidation is very slightly stronger than Waterfall, but it misses out on the flinch chance that Waterfall has, which can come in handy during a match. Destiny Bond can be a surprise to take healthy threats like Cobalion and Klefki, but it's generally not worth it because Mega Sharpedo needs to run as much coverage as possible to maximize its potential as a late-game cleaner.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Pokemon like Mega Aggron, Cobalion, and Scizor can prevent Mega Sharpedo from sweeping thanks to their high Defense stats and ability to heavily damage Mega Sharpedo, if not OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Alomomola and Rest Suicune must be wary of Defense drops from Crunch, but they can cripple Mega Sharpedo with Scald burns and Toxic poison.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Sylveon, Primarina, and Klefki avoid the OHKO from Mega Sharpedo's moves and KO or cripple it in return.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf Latias and Infernape outspeed +1 Jolly Mega Sharpedo, while Choice Scarf Krookodile and Hydreigon outspeed +1 Adamant Mega Sharpedo.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Crunch is a powerful Strong Jaw-boosted Dark-type STAB move, nailing Pokemon like Latias and Gengar while also providing great neutral coverage in general. Ice Fang is coverage to hit Hydreigon, Togekiss, and Mega Altaria, and it is also boosted by Strong Jaw. Earthquake hits Cobalion and Klefki as well as having super effective coverage on Infernape and Terrakion. Psychic Fangs hits Poison- and Fighting-types such as Amoonguss and Heracross, and it has decent neutral coverage combined with Crunch and Ice Fang, hitting targets like Cobalion and Primarina. Protect guarantees that Sharpedo can increase its Speed before it Mega Evolves and also scouts for Choice item users.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed allow Mega Sharpedo to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature makes Mega Sharpedo as strong as possible enabling it to threaten Pokemon like Mega Altaria, Quagsire, Alomomola, and Scizor more easily. A Jolly nature can be used to allow Mega Sharpedo to outspeed Choice Scarf Krookodile and Choice Scarf Hydreigon at +1 at the loss of some power. Speed Boost is Sharpedo's pre-Mega ability, as it allows Sharpedo to increase its Speed before Mega Evolving. Mega Evolving gives it Strong Jaw, which boosts the power of Crunch, Ice Fang, and Psychic Fangs by 50%.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Sharpedo is best used to clean up late-game when there are no Pokemon left on the opposing team that can outspeed Mega Sharpedo or survive one of its attacks. Therefore, don't Mega Evolve Sharpedo unless it can successfully clean or there is nothing on the opposing team that can outspeed it. Unless Sharpedo is sent out against a slower foe that it can KO without Mega Evolving, it's generally safest to use Protect the first turn Sharpedo is on the field so that it gets a guaranteed Speed boost. Mega Sharpedo should always come in either after a teammate has been KOed or on a free switch from Volt Switch or U-turn, as its poor bulk means it will usually be KOed by any strong neutral move. Before attempting to sweep, make sure that bulky Pokemon such as Cobalion, Amoonguss, Alomomola, and Scizor have been sufficiently weakened to the point where Mega Sharpedo can finish them off without getting KOed. Priority users like Infernape and Lucario must be removed before Mega Sharpedo attempts to sweep, as they can KO Mega Sharpedo before it can attack. Similarly, Disguise from Mimikyu must be broken so that Mega Sharpedo can OHKO it and continue to sweep, otherwise Mimikyu will absorb the hit and OHKO Mega Sharpedo in reponse. Scout for Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile before Mega Sharpedo attempts a sweep, as they can KO Mega Sharpedo before it can attack unless it has more than one Speed boost. If Mega Sharpedo is running an Adamant nature, it's advised to bring it out on something it can KO, like Nihilego or Starmie, so it can obtain two Speed boosts to outspeed the aforementioned Choice Scarf users.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Sharpedo fits best on offensive teams that can utilize both its strong attacks and its late-game cleaning potential. Stealth Rock setters that fit well on hyper offense like Cobalion and Krookodile allow Mega Sharpedo to more easily sweep late-game. Froslass and Klefki are great Mega Sharpedo partners because they can almost always set a layer of Spikes, which can make or break a late-game sweep. Toxic Spikes users like Nidoqueen and Tentacruel are also good partners because Toxic Spikes slowly wear down defensive Pokemon like Alomomola and Suicune, which would otherwise be able to survive one hit and cripple Mega Sharpedo. Other offensive Pokemon like Latias, Lucario, Mamoswine, and Scizor can wear down walls like Alomomola, Mega Aggron, Hippowdon, Suicune, and Swampert so that Mega Sharpedo can KO them later in the game. Latias being a great pivot into Fighting-types such as Cobalion, Infernape, and Lucario that either Mega Sharpedo can't OHKO or is threatened out by their STAB priority moves. Swords Dance Scizor can sweep late-game as well if Mega Sharpedo fails to do so. Taunt users like Krookodile and Crobat can prevent Defoggers from clearing away the entry hazards Mega Sharpedo needs to sweep. Spinblockers like Mimikyu and Doublade have nice synergy with Mega Sharpedo and can also deter Starmie and Tentacruel from using Rapid Spin, although they aren't guaranteed switch-ins to either. Other setup sweepers like Infernape, Bisharp, and Mimikyu work well with Mega Sharpedo, as they all wear down defensive and offensive Pokemon so that one can sweep later in the game.</p>"

  "Altaria": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Altaria's fantastic typing, high all-around base stats, and deep movepool filled with useful offensive, defensive, and supportive options combine to make it one of the best Pokemon in the tier. Its powerful Pixilate-boosted Return makes it one of the tier's most dangerous sweepers with Dragon Dance, and its Dragon / Fairy typing allows it to act as a solid check to Pokemon like Latias, Hydreigon, and Crawdaunt. Access to other options like Fire Blast can make it easy for Mega Altaria to lure and weaken or KO Pokemon like Scizor and Mega Aggron, while Earthquake can break through Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Tentacruel, allowing Mega Altaria to choose its counters and making it harder to switch into. In addition, options like Facade and Refresh let it act as one of the best stallbreakers in the tier. It can also take advantage of its great bulk and access to Roost to act as one of the most sturdy defensive Pokemon in the tier, capable of taking hits from Pokemon like Krookodile and Infernape while KOing them in return thanks to its natural power. It can also run a defensive Dragon Dance set on stall teams, acting as a potent late-game sweeper while still retaining good utility through Heal Bell and its great bulk and typing. Mega Altaria is, however, held back by its low Speed, which makes it slower than Pokemon like Nidoking, Gengar, and Lucario before a boost, and particularly fast Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Mega Aerodactyl can still outspeed a +1 Mega Altaria. It also can't fit all the moves it wants onto one set, making it a little more scary on paper than it is in practice. It's often forced to Mega Evolve early in order to check Pokemon like Crawdaunt and Hydreigon, which can be difficult to do and also forces it to give up Natural Cure and its Ground immunity. Finally, the prevalence of Pokemon like Amoonguss and Quagsire can make it difficult for Mega Altaria to sweep, and even if it breaks past its defensive answers, it's easily revenge killed by priority users like Mimikyu, Mamoswine, and Scizor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A mixed attacking set with Return or Body Slam, Earthquake, Fire Blast, and Roost is useable, but it struggles a lot with Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres, and it can't break through Pokemon like Amoonguss without a lot of Special Attack investment. A specially defensive set can be considered for its ability to better handle Pokemon like Hydreigon and Nasty Plot Infernape, but it's generally outclassed by the physically defensive set which can check these Pokemon anyway, and it still struggles to deal with Latias. Mega Altaria's EV spreads are fairly customizable, especially on the Refresh set. For example, 84 Defense EVs can be used to ensure that Mega Altaria survives two Earthquakes from Choice Scarf Krookodile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Scizor can threaten Mega Altaria with a powerful Bullet Punch, bringing its sweep to an end. Other Steel-types like Doublade, Mega Aggron, and Mega Steelix can take hits from Mega Altaria and retaliate with their STAB moves, even after a boost, though they do fear Fire Blast. Bronzong is a great counter to Mega Altaria, shrugging off most attacks, though it struggles to take repeated Fire Blasts from the special set.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Pokemon like defensive Nidoqueen and Amoonguss have the bulk necessary to tank a boosted Earthquake and retaliate with their STAB moves. While less reliable overall, Tentacruel and Nihilego can check certain Mega Altaria sets and KO it in return. Crobat can also take on Dragon Dance Altaria with ease.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill are capable of outspeeding a boosted Mega Altaria. Mega Aerodactyl can remove it with Ice Fang after some chip damage, while Mega Beedrill can OHKO it with Poison Jab. Certain Choice Scarf users, such as Infernape and Nihilego, can also threaten a boosted Mega Altaria.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Users</strong>: Quagsire and Pyukumuku both wall Dragon Dance Altaria endlessly. Curse Quagsire can also use it as setup fodder, while both Quagsire and Pyukumuku can knock Mega Altaria out with Counter.</p>",

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return and Earthquake combine to create a solid offensive combination that's nearly unresisted in UU, with only Crobat, Bronzong, Talonflame, Rotom-H and Moltres being able to handle both, giving Mega Altaria a lot of immediate power and allowing it to sweep through balanced and offensive teams alike. Facade can be used over Return, allowing Mega Altaria to take advantage of the status ailments it usually ends up falling victim to, most notably Scald burns from bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Empoleon. Fire Blast complements Facade by frying Steel-types like Scizor, and it doesn't get weakened if Mega Altaria is burned, unlike Earthquake. Facade and Fire Blast notably give Mega Altaria a phenomenal matchup against stall teams if it's afflicted with status. Roost keeps Mega Altaria healthy over the course of a game so that it can continuously check Pokemon like Crawdaunt and Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment with an Adamant nature makes Mega Altaria as fast and strong as possible, outspeeding threats like Starmie after a boost. An alternative EV spread of 64 HP / 252 Atk / 192 Spe can be used; the added bulk makes it easier for Mega Altaria to pivot into Pokemon like Crawdaunt, and it can still outspeed Timid Primarina before a boost in addition to outspeeding Starmie after one. Natural Cure is chosen as Mega Altaria's ability to prevent it from being crippled by status moves like Toxic, which is especially useful if it's not running Facade. It also allows it to act as a status sponge before Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Mega Altaria's typing and bulk make it pretty resilient, it shouldn't always be sent directly into foes like Hydreigon and Infernape, as they can hit it hard with coverage moves like Flash Cannon and Gunk Shot that can cripple it heavily. Mega Evolving as soon as possible is recommended unless Altaria needs to maintain Natural Cure, as it removes Altaria's Stealth Rock weakness and gives it the typing change necessary to pivot into foes like Zeraora. However, if a foe has a Pokemon like Choice Scarf Krookodile, it can be beneficial to wait to Mega Evolve, as Altaria can set up freely on a Choice-locked Earthquake. Altaria is also better at pivoting into Volcanion before Mega Evolving. It's best not to set up with Dragon Dance immediately, since most teams will carry checks to Mega Altaria like Scizor, Mega Aggron, and Doublade. Instead, attacking early-game can weaken these Pokemon to let Mega Altaria sweep late-game or open holes for its teammates. Setting up on foes that can't hurt Mega Altaria significantly is recommended, as it doesn't usually want to waste turns using Roost. Pokemon like Rotom-H, Hydreigon, and Latias are good examples, though Mega Altaria must be wary of Flash Cannon from Hydreigon. Keep Mega Altaria as healthy as possible with Roost, as residual damage from entry hazards can lead to Mega Altaria being worn down very quickly. In stall matchups, try to switch Altaria into Scald from Pokemon like Alomomola and Quagsire to power up its Facade and make it far more powerful. Natural Cure allows Mega Altaria to be played liberally, as it can absorb Toxic from them if required and continuously pivot until it is ideally inflicted with a burn. If they're not carrying Scald, it can often be worthwhile to allow Mega Altaria to be afflicted with poison so that it can break down their defensive cores with Facade, though it'll be worn down quicker itself.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits best on balance and offensive teams that appreciate Mega Altaria's sweeping potential and ability to contribute to the team's defensive backbone. Partners that can break through Pokemon that Mega Altaria struggles with like Amoonguss, Nidoqueen, and Mega Aggron are helpful, so Mega Altaria pairs well with Pokemon like Rotom-H and Infernape. Rotom-H can also bring Mega Altaria in on Pokemon like Latias and Hydreigon with Volt Switch. Scizor is also an excellent partner, weakening these shared checks and being able to check Pokemon that can revenge kill a boosted Mega Altaria like Mega Aerodactyl and Mamoswine, while Mega Altaria can handle Rotom-H for Scizor. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Rhyperior and Krookodile is helpful too, putting Pokemon like Amoonguss in range of two Fire Blasts. Rhyperior can also check Moltres and Toxic Rotom-H for Mega Altaria. Empoleon also makes for a good teammate, being able to set Stealth Rock for Mega Altaria and also checking nuisances like Tentacruel, Sylveon, Latias, and Klefki. Nidoqueen is a notable partner that can set Stealth Rock, weaken Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix, and absorb Toxic Spikes for Mega Altaria. It also appreciates Mega Altaria's ability to check Pokemon like Krookodile and Latias in return. Doublade and Amoonguss make for good partners that can check Scizor for Mega Altaria. They also appreciate Mega Altaria's ability to check Hydreigon, Latias, and Rotom-H.</p>"
      },
      "Refresh": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Mega Altaria's most consistent STAB move. Refresh and Roost keep Mega Altaria healthy and allow it to set up multiple boosts on Pokemon that rely on status to threaten it like Empoleon, Alomomola, and Gligar. Refresh also allows it to act as a reliable status absorber even after Mega Evolving.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with an Adamant nature is chosen to hit as hard and as fast as possible, but some Speed can be dropped. Using 192 Speed EVs allows Mega Altaria to outspeed Starmie after a boost while still outspeeding Primarina without one. Alternatively, 204 Speed EVs can be used with a Jolly nature in order to outspeed Mega Manectric after a boost. Finally, maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature can be used in order to guarantee a Speed tie at worst against opposing Altaria and to outspeed foes like Zeraora after a boost, but these spreads are not recommended, as Mega Manectric and Zeraora struggle to harm Mega Altaria significantly regardless.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set can be played more liberally against bulky teams, being able to freely set up in front of foes like Gligar and Blissey without fear and being able to pivot into Pokemon like Hydreigon and Rotom-H. It's still not recommended to bring Mega Altaria in on strong attacks, though, because it's quite easy to wear down in combination with Stealth Rock. Try to set up on Pokemon that can't threaten Mega Altaria significantly like Rotom-H, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Crawdaunt. Avoid setting up when Steel-types like Mega Steelix and Doublade are still active, as well as Poison-types like Amoonguss and healthy Nidoqueen, as this set has no way of removing them. Be sure to keep Mega Altaria healthy with Roost and Refresh as much as possible, as this set can often set up multiple times throughout a game. Mega Evolving as soon as possible is recommended so that Mega Altaria can check Pokemon like Hydreigon with ease.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Removing Steel-types is of utmost importance when using this set, as it cannot threaten them without accruing a lot of boosts, so teammates like Krookodile and Moltres are recommended. Krookodile can also Pursuit trap certain targets like Doublade and Gengar, while Moltres can remove Pokemon like Amoonguss and Hippowdon and also checks Scizor. Reliable Scizor checks are incredibly important with this set; Rotom-H, Volcanion, Amoonguss, and Cobalion are solid options for this role. Scizor also makes for a good partner that can also lure in and weaken Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix with Superpower and Pursuit trap Pokemon like Doublade. Nidoqueen can perform a similar role of weakening Steel-types while setting Stealth Rock for Mega Altaria, which helps with weakening Pokemon like Moltres that Mega Altaria can struggle to break through quickly. Against stall teams, this set can find it easy to sweep if Pokemon like Quagsire and Scizor are removed. As a result, lures to Quagsire like Calm Mind Cobalion and Grass Knot Infernape make for good partners. These Pokemon can also crush Steel-types for Mega Altaria, and Infernape can fry Amoonguss.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Return is Altaria's most reliable STAB move and is chosen over other options like Body Slam to ensure that the paralysis caused doesn't interfere with other status conditions inflicted by Mega Altaria's teammates. Body Slam can be used on less stall-oriented teams, though, where the paralysis chance can be helpful. Flamethrower does good damage to Steel-types like Scizor and Doublade that would otherwise come in on this set for free, but Dragon Dance can be used instead on stall or semistall teams, allowing Mega Altaria to act as a strong and bulky wincon. Defog is another option that can be used if required, as Mega Altaria has a solid matchup against certain hazard setters like Chesnaught and Krookodile. Defog can also be used over Heal Bell on more offensive teams, but on stall teams it's not recommended because cleric support can otherwise be hard to fit without Articuno. Defog should also never be used with Dragon Dance. Roost keeps Mega Altaria healthy throughout a game and allows it to continuously check foes like Crawdaunt and Infernape.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>56 Speed EVs are used so that Mega Altaria can outspeed Crawdaunt, making it easier to avoid a 2HKO and ensuring Crawdaunt can't beat Mega Altaria with a boosted Hydro Vortex. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP and Defense to better check foes like Swords Dance Infernape, Crawdaunt, and Haxorus. The Speed EVs can be dropped on Dragon Dance variants, though. Natural Cure is chosen as the ability pre-Mega Evolution so that Mega Altaria doesn't have to use Heal Bell as often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Defensive Mega Altaria should be used liberally to check Pokemon that can't hurt it significantly like Crawdaunt, Krookodile, and Hydreigon. Be sure to keep it healthy with Roost, since it's vulnerable to all forms of chip damage and doesn't have any form of passive recovery to offset it. If running Defog, switch Mega Altaria into entry hazard setters that it has a good matchup against like Chesnaught and Krookodile so that it can remove their hazards. Dragon Dance variants are potent late-game wincons and shouldn't set up early-game. Conserve Mega Altaria's HP and set it up safely when the foe's Steel- and Poison-types have been removed. Be conscious of Heal Bell's low PP, as using it too often can lead to Mega Altaria and its teammates being permanently debilitated by status conditions. Altaria should generally Mega Evolve as early as possible in order to gain the typing it needs to check foes like Crawdaunt and Hydreigon, but sometimes it's better not to if the foe has a Pokemon like Groundium Z Krookodile that can attempt to cripple or muscle through Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defensive variants of Mega Altaria are most at home on balance and stall teams, where its ability to handle Pokemon like Taunt Hydreigon, Crawdaunt, and Infernape that would otherwise shred bulky teams is very appreciated. Blissey is a very notable teammate, handling powerful special attackers that Mega Altaria can't deal with like Nihilego, Nidoqueen, and Primarina, and Mega Altaria can handle physical attackers like Infernape and Zeraora in return. Gligar can provide Defog support and can check certain Pokemon that Mega Altaria struggles with like Terrakion, Cobalion, and Mimikyu. Alomomola can also blanket check these physical attackers and provide Wish support, appreciating Mega Altaria's Heal Bell support in return. Nihilego can provide Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes support and can also check Togekiss, while Mega Altaria checks Ground-types like Hippowdon and Krookodile in return. Quagsire acts as a solid answer to setup sweepers that Mega Altaria can't check on its own, like Doublade, Scizor, and opposing Mega Altaria, and it appreciates Mega Altaria's Heal Bell support a lot. Doublade can check Terrakion and resists or is immune to the Steel- and Poison-type attacks that Mega Altaria attracts from the likes of Cobalion and Nihilego, making it an effective partner. Pyukumuku is also a helpful partner for its ability to more reliably handle Pokemon like Substitute Chandelure and Nasty Plot Infernape.</p>"

      "Special Tank": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hyper Voice and Fire Blast create a potent attacking combination that can lay the hurt on typical Mega Altaria answers like Amoonguss, Mega Steelix and Doublade. Toxic is used to cripple Pokemon that resist Mega Altaria's attacking combination, most notably Rotom-H, Moltres, and Volcanion. It's also helpful for crippling other soft checks like Hippowdon. Roost keeps Mega Altaria healthy throughout the course of a game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given HP and Defense EVs ensure that Mega Altaria can survive a Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor and melt it with Fire Blast if required. 96 Speed EVs are used to get the jump on Pokemon like Modest Primarina and Adamant Bewear, and the rest of the EVs maximize Mega Altaria's overall power. Natural Cure is chosen as the ability pre-Mega Evolution to help Mega Altaria shrug off status conditions from Pokemon it switches into like Quagsire and Rotom-H.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is a good lure to common Pokemon like Amoonguss and Doublade, so try to catch them on the switch with Fire Blast. This set is still very bulky, so don't be afraid to use it to check Pokemon like Hydreigon and Crawdaunt if needs be; be sure to keep it healthy with Roost, though. It's often not a bad idea to tank a Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor and hit it with a Fire Blast in return to free up teammates such as Terrakion. Bring Mega Altaria in on Pokemon that can't really hurt it like Chesnaught and Zeraora so that it can fire off strong attacks. Mega Evolving as early as possible is recommended in order to better check foes like Hydreigon and Crawdaunt.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set has no way of hurting Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Tentacruel, and Nihilego, so strong Ground-types like Krookodile and Mamoswine are helpful for their ability to threaten them. Stealth Rock support is recommended to weaken the Fire-types that wall this set, since Mega Altaria's best way to threaten them is Toxic. Reliable setters include Rhyperior, Cobalion, and the aforementioned Krookodile. Other Steel-types like Doublade and Scizor make for excellent partners that can check Pokemon like Nihilego, Cobalion, and Togekiss. Scizor can also bring Mega Altaria in safely on Pokemon like Amoonguss with U-turn and it can Pursuit trap Nihilego too. Other wallbreakers like Nidoking, Infernape, and Terrakion pair well with Mega Altaria, being able to blow up Pokemon it struggles with like Tentacruel, Nihilego, and Toxic Rotom-H. Pokemon that can take advantage of Mega Altaria's ability to lure in and remove Steel-types, such as Mimikyu, Terrakion, and Haxorus, also make for good partners. Gligar is a notably great partner that can check Pokemon like Hippowdon and Rotom-H with much more ease if Mega Altaria lands a Toxic on them, making it a much more reliable Defogger and wall.</p>"

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Crawdaunt has excellent wallbreaking potential due to its stellar base 120 Attack stat as well as Adaptability to double the power of its STAB moves. Additionally, its access to Swords Dance and high-Base Power moves such as Crabhammer and Knock Off leaves it with little defensive counterplay. Aqua Jet also gives it the ability to pick off frailer revenge killers such as Mienshao and Mega Beedrill. In addition to its proficiency with Swords Dance, Crawdaunt can also function as a deadly Choice Band wallbreaker that more immediately threatens opposing teams. However, due to poor defenses and significantly below average Speed, Crawdaunt is hard pressed to find wallbreaking opportunities. Offensive threats such as Mega Manectric, Celebi, and Cobalion can often revenge kill it, and its weaknesses to pivoting moves in Volt Switch and U-turn can give opposing teams momentum. Finally, it faces competition from other wallbreakers such as Primarina and Infernape, which are easier to fit on teams and provide more utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Superpower may be used on the Swords Dance set over Aqua Jet to hit common switch-ins such as Hydreigon and Cobalion, but the utility is generally less than that of Aqua Jet, which can stop faster Pokemon such as Terrakion and Mega Beedrill from revenge killing Crawdaunt.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon can generally outspeed and KO Crawdaunt and survive Aqua Jet due to its low Base Power. Examples include Cobalion, Mega Sceptile, and Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Resist Water and Dark</strong>: Chesnaught, Mega Altaria, Hydreigon, and Primarina resist Crawdaunt's STAB combination and can threaten it out with their powerful or super effective STAB attacks. However, Primarina lacks reliable recovery, and Hydreigon must watch out for Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Faster priority users such as Infernape and Lucario can easily pick off Crawdaunt due to its low bulk.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Residual damage from Spikes and Stealth Rock, as well as Toxic and burns from Scald, really hurt Crawdaunt’s longevity and leave it prone to being revenge killed.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Crawdaunt's Attack to immense levels, allowing it to plow through offensive and defensive teams alike. Crabhammer is Crawdaunt's main STAB move, significantly damaging any neutral switch-ins as well as frailer Water-resistant foes such as Primarina. It gives Crawdaunt access to an extremely powerful Z-Move in Hydro Vortex when it's used with Waterium Z, enabling it to break through Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and defensive Primarina. Knock Off is Crawdaunt's best Dark-type STAB attack, denting Pokemon that resist Crabhammer such as Latias and Rotom-C while also having the utility of removing opposing items. Aqua Jet allows Crawdaunt to revenge kill faster threats such as Terrakion and Mega Beedrill while also being able to sweep late-game.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed and Attack EVs allow Crawdaunt to outspeed threats such as defensive Togekiss and Sylveon and Speed tie with offensive Scizor while maximizing power. Adamant Crawdaunt is usable, but the Speed gained from a Jolly nature is preferred in order to outspeed maximum Speed Modest Primarina. Adaptability is Crawdaunt's preferred ability, giving it the ability to hit as hard as possible. Waterium Z gives a one-time strong Water-type STAB attack, capable of blowing past walls such as Quagsire and Mandibuzz for teammates. Life Orb gives it extra damage output at the cost of HP. Furthermore, Lum Berry can be used to avoid a potentially crippling status condition while attempting to sweep, but Waterium Z and Life Orb are the preferred items, as they allow Crawdaunt to break more effectively.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its frailty, Crawdaunt shouldn't be switching directly into attacks. Crawdaunt should pivot into walls such as Blissey or resisted hits such as Scizor's Choice-locked Bullet Punch. This gives it more opportunities to heavily damage or outright KO defensive threats such as Swampert and Hippowdon. Aqua Jet should be used to force out threats such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl after they've been weakened.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pivots such as Scizor, Mega Manectric, and Hydreigon make good partners, as they can lure in setup fodder for Crawdaunt such as Blissey and Hippowdon. Entry hazard support from Spikes setters like Klefki, Stealth Rock setters like Nidoking, and Toxic Spikes setters like Tentacruel can help weaken checks so Crawdaunt can win late-game. Choice Scarf Latias helps deal with threats that normally force Crawdaunt out, such as Hydreigon, Infernape, and Cobalion, while also providing Healing Wish support for a late-game sweep. Other wallbreakers such as offensive Scizor and Choice Specs Hydreigon appreciate Crawdaunt's ability to wear down their checks. Fighting-type checks such as Sylveon and Mega Altaria make good partners, as they take on super effective attacks that Crawdaunt cannot.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>While Liquidation is more accurate, Crabhammer is chosen as Crawdaunt's Water-type STAB move due to its greater power enabling Crawdaunt to OHKO Hippowdon and Florges as well as 2HKO Mega Aggron. Aqua Jet lets Crawdaunt pick off weakened, faster Pokemon such as Zeraora, Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, and Nihilego. Superpower notably allows Crawdaunt to punch its way through Hydreigon, an otherwise solid check. It also threatens other foes that resist Crawdaunt's STAB combination like Mega Sharpedo and opposing Crawdaunt with a powerful neutral or super effective attack. Crunch is an alternative to Superpower, acting as a secondary Dark-type move that deals more damage to bulkier, itemless Pokemon, Mega Evolutions, and Z-Move users than Knock Off does.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Band makes Crawdaunt a terrifyingly powerful wallbreaker at the cost of locking it into one move at a time. An Adamant nature gives Crawdaunt a chance to 2HKO Pokemon like itemless Alomomola after Stealth Rock with Crunch as well as OHKO Pokemon like Florges.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Crawdaunt should mainly be brought into play after a teammate has been KOed, through pivoting, or through double switches, as its poor defenses prevent it from reliably switching into much else. Crawdaunt is most effective at wallbreaking during the earlier and middle stages of a game, as its low Speed tends to make breaking through teams difficult later on. Prioritize safely getting Crawdaunt in more often against bulkier teams; Crawdaunt's great power and ability to just barely outpace a lot of defensive Pokemon allow it to consistently apply heavy amounts of pressure to them. Knock Off is generally a safe move to spam early-game, as it typically puts foes on the back foot due to it removing items and being fairly strong. Crabhammer becomes a lot safer to lock into after bulky Water-resistant foes have been removed or heavily weakened. Use Superpower whenever Crawdaunt expects Pokemon like Hydreigon and Chesnaught to switch in, as it deals more damage to them than any of its other moves and doesn't put Crawdaunt at as much of a disadvantage. Crunch should be used whenever Crawdaunt anticipates bulky Pokemon that have already taken a Knock Off such as Amoonguss and Alomomola to switch in. Make predictions when facing offensive teams, as Crawdaunt's lackluster defensive presence and low Speed put it at a massive disadvantage against them and doing so alleviates some of the pressure. An example of this would be switching into Mega Aerodactyl to revenge kill it and taking advantage of the forced switch by not using Aqua Jet, but predicting the switch-in and using the appropriate move. Use Aqua Jet cautiously; while it is a powerful tool for revenge killing Pokemon like Infernape, Mega Beedrill, and Nihilego and can also be used to clean late-game, being locked into it allows sweepers like Latias and Haxorus to set up for free.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Crawdaunt fits well on offensive and bulky offensive teams in need of a wallbreaker that has the tools to punish bulkier playstyles while still pressuring more offensive ones with its powerful STAB moves and access to decently strong priority. Pivots such as Gligar, Mega Manectric, and Scizor are essential teammates, as they give Crawdaunt a much easier time switching in. Gligar checks physical Fighting-types, Mega Manectric can take on annoyances like Togekiss as well as lure certain checks like Swampert and Chesnaught with its coverage moves, and Scizor offensively checks Fairy-types. Entry hazards are important for giving Crawdaunt an easier time with wallbreaking and putting foes such as Moltres, Terrakion, and Mamoswine in range of Aqua Jet, making setters such as Mamoswine, Cobalion, Chesnaught, and Klefki useful partners to have. Toxic Spikes setters such as Nihilego can also work, as the hazard puts greater pressure on defensive checks like Alomomola. Latias is a great teammate for multiple reasons: it resists Fighting, Grass, and Electric and is also immune to Ground; it's bulky enough to take on some of Crawdaunt's revenge killers like Cobalion, and Choice Scarf sets can revenge kill Pokemon like +1 Haxorus; it can reduce the residual damage that Crawdaunt is forced to take with Defog as well as give it another shot at breaking with Healing Wish; and Calm Mind variants can threaten bulky Water-types and have an easier time setting and sweeping with Pokemon like Krookodile and Alolan Muk kept at bay. As Crawdaunt is completely shut down by Mega Altaria and is similarly pressured by other Fairy-types like Primarina, pairing it with Fairy checks such as Cobalion, Scizor, and Gengar is ideal. Swords Dance variants of the former two also make for a deadly wallbreaking core alongside Crawdaunt. In order for Crawdaunt to be able to spam its STAB moves more reliably, pairing it with checks to Hydreigon, Mega Altaria, and Chesnaught such as Florges, Togekiss, and Moltres is important. Late-game sweepers and cleaners such as Scizor, Mega Altaria, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon find finishing teams off much easier as a result of Crawdaunt's wallbreaking prowess. Mega Altaria and Hydreigon are also capable of picking up the slack for Crawdaunt against more offensively inclined teams.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mega Absol has a niche in UU as a fast offensive trapper that's able to utilize its relatively high Speed and good movepool featuring Pursuit and Knock Off to outspeed and trap threats such as Latias and Gengar. Mega Absol also boasts solid coverage, with moves such as Superpower, Iron Tail, and Fire Blast allowing it to hit some of its switch-ins such as Terrakion, Sylveon, and Scizor. Magic Bounce is a decent ability as well, giving Absol the capability to bounce back Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp as well as potentially dissuade the use of entry hazards. However, Absol is immensely frail, which makes it very difficult to get into battle safely as well as very vulnerable to priority. It is somewhat weak overall, as its moves have somewhat low power, and it cannot hold any items to boost its damage output. Its typing also burdens it with three very common weaknesses, leaving it vulnerable to popular threats such as Cobalion, Scizor, and Mega Altaria. Finally, Absol also faces major competition as a Pursuit trapper from Alolan Muk, Bisharp, and Krookodile, since they do not occupy a Mega slot, have more bulk, and also possess strong secondary typings to give them defensive utility as well as better coverage offensively. Thus, Absol's combination of power, speed, and coverage become its main selling points over its competition; make sure to take advantage of these traits well to ensure Absol doesn't become outclassed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Swords Dance is a decent boosting move that Mega Absol can use to sweep, but its lack of bulk leaves it with limited opportunities to set up. Play Rough is a decent coverage option that can hit Heracross, Hydreigon, Mega Altaria, and Terrakion hard. This comes at the cost of important coverage or utility that Mega Absol can provide, however. Ice Beam is also a usable coverage move that can deal heavier damage to Hippowdon, Hydreigon, and Mega Altaria, but has little use otherwise.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Mega Altaria, Primarina, and Togekiss all care little about most of Mega Absol's attacks barring Iron Tail and can retaliate with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf variants of Infernape, Hydreigon, and Krookodile can revenge kill Mega Absol relatively easily. All of the aforementioned Pokemon should be wary of switching into Knock Off, however, as this removes their Choice Scarf and limits their ability to revenge kill Absol. Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Manectric are both naturally faster than Mega Absol and can KO it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Due to Absol's frailty, strong priority moves will take it out fairly easily. Scizor, Infernape, Lucario, and Crawdaunt are all common users of priority moves and can revenge kill it with slight prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Aggron, Hippowdon, and Suicune have enough bulk to take most of Mega Absol's attacks with ease and can hit it fairly hard in return.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Common Fighting-types such as Infernape, Terrakion, and Cobalion can take Mega Absol's STAB moves well and OHKO it with their own STAB moves. Cobalion should be wary of Fire Blast, however.</p>",

      "All-out Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off functions as a strong, reliable STAB move for Mega Absol that can also remove items such as Blissey's Leftovers and Doublade's Eviolite. Pursuit is another important move that comprises Absol's niche, allowing it to trap threats such as Latias, Chandelure, and Celebi that attempt to switch out in fear of Knock Off or Sucker Punch. Fire Blast is a good coverage move to hit Cobalion, Klefki, and Scizor hard on a potential switch in. Superpower is an alternative that hits Hydreigon, Terrakion, and Mega Sharpedo hard if necessary. Finally, Sucker Punch functions as a useful priority move to revenge kill Choice Scarf variants of Latias as well as pick off weakened Mega Manectric, Starmie, and Mega Aerodactyl, while Iron Tail is a viable alternative that provides a useful coverage move that hits Fairy-types such as Togekiss and Mega Altaria super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum EV investment in Attack and Speed is necessary to maximize Absol's capabilities as an attacker and revenge killer, so it can outspeed Latias and Gengar and Speed tie with Starmie and Mega Houndoom. Justified can allow Absol to switch into Dark-type moves from Pokemon like Choice-locked Krookodile and Hydreigon before Mega Evolving and gain an Attack boost, which can work to its advantage. A Naive nature is ideal if Mega Absol is going to run Fire Blast, but a Jolly nature will be better otherwise. Magic Bounce is Mega Absol's only ability and can be used to bounce back status and entry hazards. However, keep in mind that Mega Absol's immense frailty prevents it from taking advantage of the ability reliably, since it has a very shaky matchup against many of UU's entry hazard setters, such as Cobalion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mega Absol functions mainly as an offensive utility threat; send it in early- or mid-game and use its coverage, Knock Off, and Pursuit to pressure the opposing team. Since it is very frail, it should not switch directly into anything and needs support to get in safely. Double switching with prediction as well as U-turn and Volt Switch support are useful to help it get into battle. However, Mega Absol can be used to aggresively pivot into some entry hazard users like Empoleon and Tentacruel to bounce back entry hazards with Magic Bounce, though this comes at the risk of Mega Absol being severely weakened or potentially crippled by a Scald burn. Mega Absol should be used to Pursuit trap threats such as Latias, Gengar, and Chandelure, so it should remain healthy if its trapping abilities are needed. Mega Absol's coverage moves are useful for punishing its potential switch-ins, such as Hydreigon and Terrakion, possibly weakening them for teammates that have trouble with said Pokemon. If Mega Absol is carrying Sucker Punch in particular, it is wise to play carefully when trying to Pursuit trap certain Pokemon; Choice Scarf variants of Chandelure and Latias not locked into a move can easily revenge kill and defeat Absol if it doesn't use Sucker Punch while they can take Pursuit if they stay in. So in some situations, it may be better to use Knock Off or Sucker Punch to get the KO. When using Mega Absol, read situations carefully to win potential mind games with it and win against Pokemon it is supposed to check. In particular, it is advised not to use Pursuit against Starmie and Choice Scarf Latias unless you have revealed Sucker Punch. If carrying Iron Tail, it is ideal to use it on a predicted Fairy-type switch-in, in order to 2HKO the likes of Mega Altaria, Florges, and Togekiss. When using Fire Blast, it should attempt to stay as healthy as possible to survive a Bullet Punch from Scizor and OHKO it in return. Mega Absol does not sweep teams on its own, so it is best used to weaken its potential checks and trap certain Pokemon to support its team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mega Absol appreciates U-turn and Volt Switch support to help it get into battle more safely. Rotom-H and Rotom-C are particularly good candidates, since they can lure in Latias, or Celebi in the case of the latter, which are both targets for Mega Absol to trap. Scizor is also a solid teammate, since it can use its slow U-turn to get Mega Absol in more easily, and it also has Bullet Punch to take down Mega Altaria and Togekiss. Infernape appreciates Mega Absol's ability to check Latias and Starmie, assuming Absol carries Sucker Punch. Infernape can also use U-turn to help Mega Absol enter battle and can check Hydreigon and Krookodile if it carries a Choice Scarf. Primarina can deal with Hydreigon and Infernape pretty well while also being a solid wallbreaker that benefits from Absol's ability to trap Gengar and Celebi. Absol also appreciates entry hazard support to wear down threats such as Cobalion and Togekiss, making it easier for Absol to KO them. Good users of entry hazards include Nidoqueen, Cobalion, and Klefki. Pokemon such as Terrakion and Nidoking that benefit from Absol's ability to provide Pursuit support are also good teammates once it has fulfilled its role in play. Other wallbreakers and setup sweepers that benefit from Mega Absol's ability to remove their checks include Volcanion, Bewear, and Suicune, with the latter being an especially good late-game sweeper and appreciating the removal of Latias and Celebi. Volcanion can also support Mega Absol with Defog support and break down bulky Steel-types like Mega Aggron. Chandelure can check Scizor, Cobalion, and Infernape and function as a good sweeper or wallbreaker with Mega Absol. Nihilego can punish Fairy-types barring Klefki with Sludge Wave, and it appreciates Mega Absol's potential ability to lure in and take down Scizor with Fire Blast. Latias, Mimikyu, and Primarina also make great partners, as they can check Fighting-types like Infernape, Terrakion, and Bewear for Mega Absol, while the latter can also remove bulky Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix for Absol.</p>"

  "Glalie": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Glalie finds a niche in UU due to its ability to find free turns setting Spikes and its great mixed offenses. It has a large number of viable moves it can run on its Spikes set, making scouting for its coverage extremely tricky. It has the capability to pressure nearly every hazard remover in the tier. A good base 100 Speed tier lets it outpace many threatening offensive Pokemon such as Nidoking, Moltres, and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Krookodile. Unfortunately, Mega Glalie has a large number of shortcomings that prevent from being more than a niche pick on offensive teams. Its mono Ice-typing is absolutely horrendous defensively, providing zero utility to the team and giving it limited switch in opportunities, thanks to a Stealth Rock weakness and weaknesses to common offensive types like Fighting and Rock. It is weak to many common revenge killers in the tier, such as the priority moves of Scizor and special Lucario, as well as faster threats like Aerodactyl, Infernape, and Terrakion. All of these threats can outspeed and hit it with super effective moves. Mega Glalie also suffers from extreme cases of 4MSS, not having enough room to threaten all the hazard removers on just one set. Using a Mega slot for a Spiker when there are options like Klefki, Chesnaught, and Froslass can be suboptimal, especially when the hyper offense teams Mega Glalie works best on do like having Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Sharpedo, Mega Manectric, and Mega Altaria on them.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt can prevent entry hazard removers from getting rid of your Spikes, as well as stopping opposing Stealth Rock users from setting up hazards, but Glalie is usually better off pressuring them offensively. Giving up coverage for Taunt can hurt its matchup against hazard removers overall. Glalie typically should not deviate from the options outside its listed set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Mega Glalie's Ice typing curses it with weaknesses to some of the most common forms of priority in the tier. Primarily Scizor can take advantage of this, ignoring Glalie's Speed and hitting it hard. Lucario is another Pokemon that can hit it hard with Vacuum Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types are only threatened by Hidden Power Fire, Earthquake, or the rare Super Fang, with many options comfortably taking the former. Mega Aggron and Klefki can come in to lay hazards, Empoleon can Defog Glalie's Spikes away, and Stakataka can set up hazards or Trick Room and force Mega Glalie out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: When not running Earthquake, Fire-types can switch in relatively easily to Glalie and force it out with their STAB moves. Infernape and Choice Scarf Chandelure can offensively check it, while Volcanion 4x resists Ice and has the bulk to tank Double-Edges easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: While Mega Glalie's base 100 Speed is solid, there is still a large number of offensive threats that outspeed it and aren't afraid of Ice Shard. Cobalion, Starmie, Infernape, Terrakion, and Mega Manectric are all offensive threats that fear little from Ice Shard and can OHKO Glalie with their STAB or coverage moves. Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Latias are also able to revenge kill Glalie if it's not running Ice Shard.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Spiker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes are a great way to capitalize on the many switches Mega Glalie forces. They can chip Fire- and Steel-types that come in to try and force out Glalie and support the rest of its team. Return is Glalie's reliable STAB option with no drawbacks, hitting bulky targets like Mega Altaria and Hippowdon hard, but Double-Edge can be used if power is desired to more easily break through Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Chandelure. The recoil can be annoying to account for versus high HP targets such as Blissey, though. Freeze-Dry covers a wide array of Water-type switch-ins such as Alomomola, Tentacruel, and Suicune. It can hit all of these Pokemon on the switch for 2HKOs with Stealth Rock up. Earthquake is an option that hits usually reliable switch-ins such as Volcanion and Empoleon for 2HKOs and other Steel-types. Ice Shard is an option to improve Mega Glalie's matchup with offense, letting it scare Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile as well as faster offensive threats such as Latias and Mega Aerodactyl. Hidden Power Fire is a great way to surprise Scizor while also giving coverage for extra chip damage on other Steel-types like Cobalion. Explosion is a way to prevent slower Defoggers and Rapid Spin users that Mega Glalie can't KO from removing its hazards. It also packs insanely scary power, even OHKOing some frailer Ice-resistant foes like Chandelure and Crawdaunt. Super Fang is an interesting pick for chipping every switch-in, especially bulky tanks like Mega Aggron. It doesn't take advantage of Mega Glalie's great mixed offenses, though.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>If Mega Glalie is running special moves such as Freeze-Dry and Hidden Power Fire, a Naive nature boosts its Speed while not lowering damage output. If Glalie is running a pure physical set, Jolly is the optimal choice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Glalie can often be used in the lead slot to immediately set the pressure of Spikes on your opponent, and they may not have the adequate switch-ins to whatever coverage Mega Glalie is carrying. Try to use Glalie early-game as much as possible, since Stealth Rock stops it from taking even neutral hits well; while at full health, Mega Glalie can usually tank one decently powerful STAB move such as Starmie's Life Orb Hydro Pump. Take advantage of Mega Glalie's unpredictability by mostly setting up Spikes early and using its main STAB option in Return or Double-Edge, as it can lure in foes like Alomomola to take Freeze-Dry, Scizor for Hidden Power Fire, and Empoleon for Earthquake. If you have Stealth Rock up and your opponent is carrying an entry hazard remover, it is often wise to use the attack of choice that would hit them super effectively on the switch, keeping your Stealth Rock up and still giving Mega Glalie more opportunities to lay Spikes later. Explosion can give your breakers free setup opportunities by getting them in safely. Once you've set up a layer of Spikes and you see an opportunity for your cleaner to go in, don't be afraid to use it. Explosion also can be used to prevent removal when you otherwise aren't able to.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Common Stealth Rock users on offense such as Terrakion and Nihilego both create more offensive pressure with Mega Glalie and form a great hazard stacking core to support the rest of your team while also having respectable offensive presence. Electric-types such as Rotom-H, Rotom-C, and Zeraora all appreciate Mega Glalie powering through Dragon- and Ground-types with its strong STAB moves, while they can pivot it in safely with Volt Switch and check Water-types. Ghost-types like Chandelure, Gengar, and Decidueye can spinblock for Mega Glalie, helping keep its Spikes up and using them to sweep or revenge kill more easily. Taunt users like Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Cobalion aid Glalie in ensuring hazards will stay up. Setup sweepers like Swords Dance Scizor, Nasty Plot Infernape, and Dragon Dance Haxorus enjoy both the Spikes Glalie provides and its Ice-type attacks eliminating Dragon-types like Latias and Hydreigon that could revenge kill them. Mega Glalie should primarily be deployed on heavily offensive teams, as they are the only ones capable of taking advantage of the Spikes support Glalie provides quickly enough.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>What stands out most about Metagross is its sky-high base 135 Attack stat and high-powered STAB move in Meteor Mash, which, in conjunction with a Choice Band and its solid bulk, lets it OHKO common offensive Pokemon such as Primarina, Latias, and Hydreigon after Stealth Rock. This ability to stay in and do big damage gives it a valid niche among the tier's many offensive Steel-types, mainly Scizor, which doesn't have a STAB move as powerful as Meteor Mash. Metagross's movepool and other stats are also decent, which allows it to serve niche support roles as needed, either as a bulky Stealth Rock setter or as an offensive lure. Thanks to its bulk and power, it is unique among offensive Stealth Rock setters in its ability to soft check Pokemon such as Mega Altaria and Latias much more proficiently than its closest analog in Cobalion. These niches help it distinguish itself from Scizor, Cobalion, and Bisharp, which otherwise thoroughly outclass it as a strong offensive Steel-type due to their ability to set up while being forced out by much less of the tier. Metagross also suffers from a mediocre base 70 Speed, a lack of recovery, and a glaring weakness to common offensive types in Fire, Ground, and Dark, which makes it easy to overwhelm with strong attacks, entry hazards, and the ever-present Pursuit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Agility Metagross with Meteor Mash, Thunder Punch, and Ice Punch holding either Steelium Z or Life Orb can act as an interesting late-game cleaner, but such a set is generally outdone by fellow offensive Steel-types Bisharp, Cobalion and Scizor, which have better offensive typings, access to Swords Dance, and stronger coverage to make them far more effective. Choice Band Metagross can run Zen Headbutt over a coverage move to lure and OHKO Rotom-H, as well as have neutral STAB coverage against most Water-types, but Explosion generally has broader applications due to its drastically higher power and broader array of neutral targets. Assault Vest Metagross is one of the best Fairy- and Psychic-type counters the tier has available, but the sheer lack of utility or role compression provided outside of the ability to force these Pokemon out generally makes it inferior to other checks to such Pokemon such as Scizor. It is also drastically weaker without a boosting item, making it setup fodder for Pokemon Choice Band Metagross would stand a chance against, such as Scizor, Bisharp, and Cobalion.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Unless Metagross is running Life Orb-boosted Grass Knot, most bulky Ground-types can eat any hit from it, beat it down even if it's running a Shuca Berry, and recover off the damage. Offensive Ground-types like Nidoking and Krookodile must watch out for Shuca Berry, though, or risk taking heavy damage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Though they are quickly worn down by Stealth Rock and cannot reliably switch into Metagross's coverage, Fire-types resist Meteor Mash and are strong enough to OHKO Metagross with their STAB moves. Moltres and Rotom-H in particular can keep it at bay as long as Stealth Rock is down and Metagross doesn't use Explosion, scare it out with Fire-type moves, and use the free turn to either use Defog or fire off a free attack. Moltres must be careful, though, to avoid using Roost as Metagross uses Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Metagross not carrying Grass Knot or Explosion are taken advantage of by bulky Water-types quite easily, as they don't care about any other move Metagross could throw at them. They must scout for the aforementioned moves, however, or risk being crippled by them.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Hydreigon, Krookodile, Bisharp, and Mega Sharpedo all outspeed Metagross and can OHKO it with little to no chip damage if it is not carrying a Colbur Berry. Even Colbur Berry variants struggle to beat them one-on-one in return, though Meteor Mash and Earthquake do a good chunk of damage to most of them if they attempt to switch in directly.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Despite the threat of Choice Band-boosted Earthquake or, in the case of Scizor, Hidden Power Fire, most Steel-types can come in quite comfortably on Meteor Mash and take advantage of Metagross. Cobalion, Bisharp, Mega Aggron, and Scizor can use Metagross locked into Meteor Mash as an opportunity to set up, attack, set up Stealth Rock, or in the case of Bisharp and Scizor, Pursuit trap it. Scizor must be mindful of mixed Metagross, as it is crushed by Hidden Power Fire and should scout accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Though Metagross is quite bulky even without investment, it's not enough to be considered a wall, and it is easily overwhelmed by common wallbreakers such as Cobalion, Hydreigon, Volcanion, and Infernape. Most of these examples also target Metagross's much lower Special Defense, making it quite helpless versus them once they're in versus it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>The sheer power of Meteor Mash is what sets Choice Band Metagross apart from its primary competition in Scizor. It is very spammable because of this power, its decent neutral coverage, and its chance to raise Metagross's Attack stat. Earthquake synergizes well offensively with Meteor Mash due to its ability to hit most Steel-resistant Pokemon for super effective damage. Scizor, Cobalion, and Volcanion are all otherwise decent switch-ins to Meteor Mash that are crushed by Earthquake. Pursuit provides Metagross with crucial offensive utility that capitalizes off of the many switches it forces by virtue of its bulk and typing, allowing it to trap Psychic-type such as Latias and Celebi quite convincingly. Explosion lets Metagross get off a massive neutral hit in exchange for it bring KOed, which can prove key in supporting its teammates by crippling or eliminating threats to your team. Rotom-H, Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Alomomola all take ridiculous damage from Explosion, with Rotom-H being outright OHKOed and all other examples being OHKOed after relatively little chip damage. Bullet Punch provides key revenge killing power that Metagross would otherwise lack, letting it scare out worn-down offensive Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Mega Aerodactyl. It is worth noting, though, that it is considerably weaker than Scizor's Bullet Punch. Trick exchanges Metagross's long-term wallbreaking power for the opportunity to lure in and cripple a switch-in by removing its item and giving it a Choice Band. This can prove extremely useful in longer games against teams that rely on bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Alomomola, Suicune, Hippowdon, and Gligar to keep physical attackers at bay.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>216 Speed EVs give Metagross the jump on Jolly Crawdaunt and Adamant Scizor, allowing it to outspeed both and 2HKO them with Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Metagross's bulk and typing to apply immediate pressure and spam Meteor Mash early-game to soften up its switch-ins and clear the way for a teammate. If you are carrying Trick and do not feel Metagross will be useful in the long run, try to give a switch-in its Choice Band with Trick. Crippling an Alomomola or Hippowdon early-game will often get you much more mileage out of Metagross than being walled indefinitely. This same result can also be achieved with Explosion, though at a higher cost. Feel free to go for Explosion if you feel Metagross has outlived its usefulness or if it is at low HP. Avoid switching directly into attacks Metagross doesn't necessarily have to take, especially if its bulk is needed to soft-check an offensive Pokemon later. Dragon Dance Mega Altaria and Calm Latias, for example, do not need much chip damage at all to KO Metagross with +1 Earthquake or +1 Devastating Drake, respectively. Unnecessary damage can be avoided with VoltTurn support from Pokemon such as Mega Manectric and Hydreigon. All of Metagross's moves are exploitable to some capacity, so be discerning with which move you lock it into. Calm Mind Slowbro or Calm Mind Suicune, for example, can set up on Metagross locked into Meteor Mash or Earthquake, while going for Pursuit will leave Metagross a sitting duck versus virtually anything that comes in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Band Metagross fits best on bulky offense teams that can support slow wallbreakers and compensate for Metagross's relative lack of staying power with healing support and entry hazard removal. Wish users such as Alomomola and Florges are effective at counteracting Metagross's longevity issues as well as the shortcomings of its defensive typing, with each example also acting as consistent switch-ins to a good number of Metagross's offensive checks, such as Hydreigon in the case of Florges and Krookodile and Doublade in the case of Alomomola. Alomomola also tends to bait in Pokemon that will allow Metagross in for free, such as Latias, while Florges is capable of luring Scizor and removing it with Hidden Power Fire. Defensive answers to the common Ground-, Dark-, and Fire-type Pokemon looking to force Metagross ensure that Metagross does not forfeit free turns to them. Kommo-o, Hydreigon, and Chesnaught all comfortably handle the likes of Krookodile, Bisharp, and Crawdaunt to some capacity, while also providing team support by annoying special walls with Taunt and Spikes, respectively. Many setup Pokemon appreciate Metagross's wallbreaking ability between Meteor Mash and Explosion. For example, Nasty Plot Infernape and Calm Mind Suicune are much tougher to handle if Metagross has handled an opposing Latias or Mega Altaria, and Mega Sharpedo can clean up late-game after Metagross has softened up opposing bulky Pokemon with repeated Meteor Mashes. Offensive pivots such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Mega Manectric can bring in Metagross for free on their switch-ins, most of which are threatened by Choice Band-boosted Meteor Mash. Their Speed also helps take offensive pressure off Metagross by revenge killing opposing fast Pokemon capable of revenge killing it. Rotom-H is an extremely effective defensive pivot that shuts down most Ground-types that would otherwise feast on Metagross as well as Scizor, and they can force them out to bring Metagross in with Volt Switch. In return, Metagross is a decent soft answer to the Dragon-types that come in to sponge Rotom-H's Volt Switch.</p>"

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash is Metagross's best option for its Steel-type STAB move, and its very useful chance to raise its Attack makes it decently spammable. Earthquake is necessary coverage to not be walled by Fire- and Steel-types and does decent neutral damage to bulky Water-types. Volcanion, Cobalion, Mega Aggron, and Mega Steelix all take massive damage from Earthquake but would be able to switch in consistently to Meteor Mash otherwise. Bullet Punch allows Metagross to act as a revenge killer or get last-ditch chip damage versus Pokemon about to KO it, meaning that faster Pokemon weak to Steel such as Mamoswine, Togekiss, and Mega Aerodactyl aren't safe bets for revenge killing Metagross. Explosion allows Metagross to get off a massive nuke once you feel like it has outlived its usefulness, allowing it to support its teammates by crippling Pokemon such as Suicune and Hippowdon in exchange for KOing itself. Pursuit is an alternative option that lets Metagross trap Pokemon it checks by virtue of its typing, such as Latias and Celebi, but this isn't always ideal because of its lack of power, overcompression of roles sacrificing general utility and coverage, and chip damage from Life Orb. The latter issue will often lead to a Metagross carrying both Stealth Rock and Pursuit often having to choose between one or the other, due to how quickly it is worn down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Speed investment in conjunction with Life Orb is necessary for Metagross to outspeed and 2HKO Crawdaunt and offensive Scizor with Earthquake. If running a damage reduction Berry, the choice between Shuca and Colbur Berry will determine which of two pools of threats Metagross can stay in against for that one turn. This greatly improves its utility as an offensive glue.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Metagross's typing to your advantage and switch it into Pokemon such as Latias, Klefki, Florges, and Amoonguss, provided something has been put to sleep in the case of the latter, to set up Stealth Rock. Do note, though, that Metagross should not be your primary switch-in to such Pokemon due to how quickly it is worn down. If the opponent is carrying a Pokemon that can take advantage of Metagross, either pick up the slack with aggressive play or apply offensive pressure by firing off attacks so Pokemon can't come in completely for free. If Rotom-H comes in to Defog away Stealth Rock, for example, you can lure it in and remove it from play with Explosion. Preserve Metagross's HP and Berry, if using one, so it can stay in against a foe using either Ground- or Dark-type attacks. This can prove useful for beating massive threats such as Mamoswine and Bisharp one-on-one that would otherwise force Metagross out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Despite being a predominantly offensive Pokemon, Metagross's defensive qualities make it a decent glue for more frail offensive teams that need a lot of utility poured into one teamslot. Its bulk lets it act as an emergency check to the likes of Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Sceptile, as well as a serviceable check to Dragon- and Fairy-types such as Latias, Florges, and Mega Altaria. Late-game sweepers such as Mega Sharpedo and Mega Sceptile appreciate Metagross's ability to wallbreak and soft-check Fairy- and Dragon-types, as well as softening up walls with Meteor Mash. Since Metagross can only tank one or two particularly strong attacks, backup offensive checks to the aforementioned Fairy- and Dragon-types are needed to handle them reliably. Such Pokemon include Mamoswine, Rotom-H, and Mega Beedrill. Metagross's subpar Speed stat and general role on offensive teams almost always calls for a Choice Scarf user to help alleviate offensive pressure. Its common weaknesses to Fire, Dark, Ghost, and Ground makes Hydreigon an absolutely excellent option in this role, as it covers for all of these shortcomings. Choice Scarf Infernape is an effective revenge killer that handles most of such Pokemon decently well. Both of these Pokemon can use U-turn to bait opposing Fairy-types that Metagross can beat. Fire-resistant bulky attackers such as Mega Altaria, Swampert, Nihilego, and Mega Aerodactyl do a good job keeping opposing Fire-types from taking advantage of this set if one manages to come in on Metagross for free. Pokemon capable of exploiting bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Slowbro are also necessary so they cannot freely exploit Metagross. Calm Mind Latias and Celebi are capable of reliably beating such Pokemon while making for solid wallbreakers in their own right. They also do well on frail offense teams, as their defensive qualities mesh well with Metagross's and make for a decent defensive backbone.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Meteor Mash provides Metagross with a STAB move to threaten opposing Fairy-types and special walls, which it otherwise can't do much against with its coverage moves. Explosion is a viable alternative, as on top of being a massively powerful nuke when boosted by Life Orb, it provides you with a free switch to a teammate in exchange for Metagross being KOed. Hidden Power Fire is necessary for this set to lure in and KO opposing Scizor, one of the biggest threats in the tier, while also hitting other Steel-types for decent damage. Grass Knot allows Metagross to damage Ground-types, OHKOing Swampert and Quagsire and crippling Hippowdon. Stealth Rock is run because Metagross is an excellent user of the move, setting it up for free on forced switches against Latias, Klefki, Sylveon, and Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The lack of Attack investment doesn't affect the power of Metagross's physical moves that drastically, as Explosion and Meteor Mash are still extremely strong coming off its high Attack stat with a Life Orb boost. A Hasty nature is used over Naive because Metagross's physical bulk is still high enough despite the stat drop to take the physical hits it needs to, namely Scizor's Bullet Punch. It also appreciates having more Special Defense to switch into attacks such as Draco Meteor from Latias and Moonblast from Florges if it needs to. Life Orb is essential to power up Metagross's special attacks to the level necessary to KO the threats it needs to, guaranteeing the OHKO on offensive Scizor with Hidden Power Fire and giving a chance to OHKO defensive Scizor after Stealth Rock with Hidden Power Fire. It also allows Grass Knot to OHKO Swampert the vast majority of the time and 2HKO any Hippowdon variant. Alternatively, Expert Belt can be used to bluff a different set and achieve many of the OHKOs and 2HKOs that Life Orb achieves, but it does not do so as reliably, and lacking Life Orb makes its neutral attacks far weaker.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Metagross in on foes it checks by virtue of its typing, such as Latias and Klefki, to set up Stealth Rock or fire off an attack. Don't do this frequently, however, as the lack of bulk investment means Metagross doesn't take many hits, and it needs HP to fire off as many Life Orb-boosted attacks as possible. Precise prediction is necessary to get the most damage out of Metagross and cripple or eliminate the targets it is intended to lure. Predict obvious switch-ins to the likes of Scizor, Hippowdon, Swampert, and Doublade early on so that Metagross's teammates can do work unhindered by their defensive checks. If carrying Explosion, be extremely selective with its use and designate a threat you want to use it on, as you can only use it once. It should generally be saved for a Pokemon Metagross cannot hurt otherwise, such as Blissey or Tentacruel, or if you desperately need to get a teammate in for free on your chosen target. Note that without Meteor Mash, Explosion is this set's only real way to threaten special walls, so be careful not to reveal your coverage until an opportune time unless you decide to target a specially bulky Pokemon with Explosion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mixed Metagross makes for a great offensive support Pokemon because of the common threats it lures by virtue of its typing and coverage. For this reason, offensive Pokemon that need bulky Pokemon put in KO range of their attacks such as Terrakion and Dragon Dance Altaria make excellent partners, as they greatly appreciate Metagross's ability to lure Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Scizor, as well as bringing them in for free on weakened targets with Explosion. Metagross's lack of bulk investment means it generally lacks defensive utility despite being a Steel-type. Klefki does an excellent job picking up the slack, as it not only switches reliably into opposing Dragon- and Fairy-types but can also set up Spikes, which gives Metagross a decent chance to OHKO defensive Scizor and guarantees the OHKO on Swampert with Grass Knot. Due to Metagross's low Speed, lack of longevity, and weaker Meteor Mash, it is bait for most of the tier's Dark-types, making checks to them essential so they cannot capitalize on the free turns Metagross gives to them. Mega Altaria, Terrakion, and Togekiss all appreciate lure Metagross's support while also keeping Dark-types at bay.</p>"

  "Registeel": {
    "overview": "<p>Registeel has amazing bulk and a great pure Steel typing, which together allow it to check Dragon-types such as Latias and Hydreigon and Flying-types such as Togekiss and Crobat. It can also support its team in various ways by setting Stealth Rock to damage foes as they switch in and by crippling opposing Pokemon with Toxic. However, Registeel is very passive, relying on moves like Toxic and Seismic Toss to do any significant damage to foes, which means that it can be easily taken advantage of and thus only fits on defensive teams. Registeel also faces competition from other Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix, which are way less passive than it. Unlike them, however, Registeel can hold Leftovers and, more importantly, doesn't take up a Mega slot, meaning there's a lot less opportunity cost when using it. Registeel also sports a higher Special Defense stat than both Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix, letting it more easily switch into Pokemon like Primarina. It also faces competition from Bronzong, but having access to Counter and not being weak to Pursuit gives it a slight edge over Bronzong. Furthermore, Registeel's weakness to common typings such as Ground, Fighting, and Fire also hold it back, as it can be easily exploited by Pokemon like Nidoking, Cobalion, and Infernape. It also lacks reliable recovery and is forced to rely on Leftovers to remain healthy, so it can be worn down rather quickly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunder Wave allows Registeel to cripple faster threats that try to take advantage of it, such as Gengar and Infernape. Registeel becomes even more passive without Toxic, however. A Curse set with Rest + Sleep Talk might seem like an appealing option, but Registeel would still be too weak even after multiple boosts and could still be easily forced out. Earthquake is an option, as it hits Gengar and Fire-types such as Chandelure and Infernape for super effective damage, but Seismic Toss is still the preferred attacking move most of the time, since it hits a wider array of Pokemon for a consistent amount of damage. Iron Head can also be used to hit Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl for a higher amount of damage than with Seismic Toss, but it's still not worth using most of the time due to Registeel's poor Attack stat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Pokemon</strong>: Registeel heavily relies on Toxic to do any significant damage to foes, so Pokemon that are immune to it such as Scizor, Gengar, and Doublade can easily take advantage of it. Substitute users such as Suicune and Kyurem are also able to block Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor, Swords Dance Cobalion, and Nasty Plot Togekiss are able to take advantage of Registeel's passivity, as they don't take much damage from it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Krookodile and Nidoking are able to threaten Registeel with their super effective STAB moves. Bulkier Ground-types such as Mega Steelix, Hippowdon, and Swampert can also force it out, but Hippowdon and Swampert must be wary of Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon like Heracross, Terrakion, and Cobalion can hit Registeel and heavily damage or outright OHKO it with their super effective Fighting-type STAB moves. The given examples can also set up almost for free on Registeel.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Infernape, Volcanion, and Moltres can threaten Registeel with their STAB moves. However, they have trouble directly switching in, as they do not appreciate being hit by Toxic or Seismic Toss after taking Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Gengar, Doublade, and Chandelure are immune to Registeel's only attacking move, Seismic Toss, and can proceed to set up on it or hit it with their STAB moves. The former two are also unaffected by Toxic.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock damages foes when they switch in, and Registeel is a very reliable setter thanks to its great bulk. Toxic is used to weaken the opposing team by crippling bulky Pokemon such as Alomomola and Hippowdon. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage to foes, somewhat making up for Registeel's lack of offensive presence. Protect allows Registeel to scout for Choice-locked Pokemon and gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery every time the move is used, which mitigates the fact that it can be chipped down very quickly. Protect also works well with Toxic, as it causes opposing Pokemon to take additional damage. Alternatively, Counter can be used to deal heavy damage back to physical attackers that usually threaten and try to exploit Registeel's uninvested Defense stat, such as Krookodile and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Using Counter can leave Registeel too weak to check what it's supposed to, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment and a Calm nature maximize Registeel's special bulk, allowing it to better switch into Pokemon like Latias and Hydreigon. Leftovers provides Registeel with a form of passive recovery, increasing its longevity. An alternative physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature is an option, as it allows Registeel to switch into Pokemon like Mega Sharpedo more easily. However, it still falls short against most physical attackers. Clear Body is the ability of choice, as it allows Registeel to avoid Special Defense and Defense drops, further improving Registeel's durability.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Registeel is a very straightforward Pokemon to use; it should be switched into Pokemon that it can wall, such as Latias and Nihilego, and proceed to set up Stealth Rock and weaken the opposing team with Toxic. Be wary of Pokemon that can take advantage of Registeel's passivity, such as Swords Dance Scizor and Nasty Plot Infernape. Staying in to set up Stealth Rock or use Seismic Toss in these situations may give the opponent an advantage. Since it lacks reliable recovery, Registeel shouldn't be taking unnecessary chip damage by trying to sponge physical hits, since it's whittled down very quickly. It should be preserved so it can check what it's intended to check. However, if Registeel is paired with a Wish passer like Alomomola and if it's likely that it'll receive Wish recovery, it can be used more freely. Use Protect to rack up more turns of Toxic damage on foes and to keep Registeel as healthy as possible with additional turns of Leftovers recovery. Protect should also be used to scout for Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Choice Band Scizor and Choice Specs Hydreigon. Counter should be used against physical threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Band Scizor that try to take advantage of Registeel's passivity. However, keep in mind that Registeel would be much weaker and potentially incapable of checking Pokemon like Calm Mind Latias after using Counter effectively. Additionally, Counter and Protect should be used carefully, as they can give the opponent free turns and thus the possibility of gaining an advantage. Registeel shouldn't try to use Counter or Protect against setup sweepers like Swords Dance Scizor and Cobalion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Registeel should only be used on bulkier builds that can take advantage of its resistances and access to Stealth Rock, and it should only be used if the Mega slot is already taken, as it's too passive to be used on more offensive ones. Wish support is one of the best ways to support Registeel, as it can increase Registeel's longevity. As such, Pokemon like Alomomola and Sylveon make for good partners. Alomomola is a particularly good teammate, as it also has amazing synergy with Registeel; Alomomola can sponge Ground- and Fire-type attacks that are aimed at Registeel, and Registeel can switch into special attackers such as Hydreigon and Primarina and block Toxic. Ground-types like Krookodile and Nidoking are able to threaten Registeel with their STAB moves, so Ground-immune Pokemon such as Gligar and Moltres pair well with it. Pokemon that can sponge the Fighting-type attacks that are aimed at Registeel, such as Mega Altaria and Slowbro, are also good teammates for it. Bulky Water-types like Tentacruel and the aforementioned Alomomola also pair well with Registeel for their ability to switch into Fire-types such as Infernape and Moltres, as Registeel is easily forced out by them. Blissey is a great partner for Registeel, as it can reliably switch into Pokemon like Volcanion and Moltres and appreciates Registeel's ability to set up Stealth Rock, which allows it to run Heal Bell. Entry hazard removers such as Defog Moltres and Articuno are able to easily remove Spikes from the field, which can wear Registeel down very quickly. Pursuit users provide valuable support for Registeel, as they can trap Ghost-types such as Gengar and Chandelure, which can usually take advantage of Registeel due to their immunity to Seismic Toss. Thus, Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and Krookodile make good partners. Unaware Pokemon like Quagsire and Pyukumuku pair well with Registeel, as they're able to check a lot of the setup sweepers that try to take advantage of Registeel's passive nature, such as Swords Dance Scizor and Cobalion.</p>"

  "Latias": {
    "overview": "<p>Latias's combination of typing, good offensive stats, bulk, coverage, and reliable recovery makes it one of the most dangerous and metagame-defining offensive presences in the tier. Access to Calm Mind as well as multiple usable Z-Moves takes this offensive prowess to the next level, allowing it to break through the majority of its potential checks, all while capitalizing on the defensive utility afforded by its good typing and high bulk for a fast offensive Pokemon. It also has access to key support moves in Trick, Healing Wish, and Defog to allow it to serve certain utility purposes as needed. All of this versatility makes Latias extremely flexible and team friendly and forces opponents to be on their toes until Latias has revealed its set to gauge their response accordingly. The tier has responded to Latias's presence, however, with a wide array of offensive and defensive counterplay: most faster Pokemon can heavily damage or outright KO it, it is vulnerable to common priority users like Scizor, Mamoswine, and Bisharp, and perhaps most importantly, it is weak to Pursuit from trappers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Krookodile. Furthermore, despite Latias's key resistances letting it exploit a good number of Pokemon, Dragon / Psychic does have its flaws as a defensive typing, as with six common weaknesses, Latias is forced out or Pursuit trapped by a large portion of the tier depending on its set. It is also heavily reliant on Z-Moves and the easily punishable Draco Meteor to do significant damage, as it is rather weak unboosted and can be easily pressured to fire off predictable attacks. Lastly, Latias's STAB combination is walled by Steel-types, meaning that it must either burn its Z-Move or sacrifice one of Calm Mind, Roost, or a Psychic-type attack to stand a chance against the likes of Empoleon, Mega Aggron, and Klefki on its own. These shortcomings open up Latias to relatively straightforward methods to minimize its impact on the game, meaning that while it is rare for any Latias set to be dead weight in a given matchup, there are many in which it will not be as devastating as it might otherwise be.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf Latias can run a stray coverage move such as Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, or Hidden Power Fire in place of Trick or Defog to get last-ditch damage versus crucial targets for your team. This is generally inferior, though, to the support provided by those utility options, as being locked into a weak coverage move can prove extremely punishable. Colbur Berry allows Latias to circumvent mind games versus Pursuit users once and punish teams that rely on Dark-types to check it offensively. This also allows it to much more easily support teammates that are also weak to Pursuit trapping, such as Gengar and Mega Sceptile. However, this comes at an extreme cost in power due to the loss of a Z-Crystal or Life Orb, relegating it to teams that are desperate to have the likes of Choice Scarf Krookodile and Alolan Muk removed. Reflect Type is also a viable method of circumventing Latias's Pursuit weakness, as well as potentially setting up on Steel-types, but this comes at the steep cost of sacrificing a moveslot, leaving it with only a single attack and making it very easy to wall. It is also very prediction reliant, as once Reflect Type is revealed, a competent opponent will attempt to position themselves with a Pokemon that will hit Latias's current typing super effectively.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Though they must be mindful of Gigavolt Havoc, Steel-types wall Latias's STAB combination and are generally bulky enough to do so consistently unless they are heavily weakened or Latias has the appropriate coverage. Klefki, Mega Aggron, Empoleon, and Scizor are all capable of forcing out or crippling Latias in some capacity, either with status, Pursuit trapping, or strong attacks. Scizor must be careful, though, not to be put in KO range of a boosted Z-Move. A special mention goes to Mega Steelix, which is immune to Gigavolt Havoc on top of its resistance to Latias's STAB moves and only has to watch out for Choice Specs-boosted Surf or Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types and Pursuit</strong>: Dark-types are immune to Latias's Psychic-type moves and can heavily damage or eliminate it with their STAB moves. Though uncommon, Umbreon in particular counters all Latias variants unless it is given a Choice Scarf with Trick. The tier is also littered with Pursuit trappers, Dark-type or otherwise, capable of putting Latias in a checkmate position. Such Pokemon include Choice Scarf Krookodile, Mega Aerodactyl, Scizor, and Alolan Muk.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Though Latias doesn't care much about burn, poison and paralysis both ruin its day: the former greatly limits its longevity and threatens to put it in range of opposing attacks, and paralysis leaves it outsped and eliminated by the majority of the tier. Toxic poison ruins any chance Latias might have at cleanly sweeping, though it can easily switch in and out to minimize poison damage racking up.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Latias's Speed tier is above average, but it's not enough to prevent it from being greatly threatened by faster offensive threats. Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Sceptile, Mega Beedrill, and Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Hydreigon are capable of outspeeding and eliminating Latias with little to no chip damage regardless of Calm Mind boosts. It is also vulnerable to three of the most common priority moves in the tier in Scizor's Bullet Punch, Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and Mamoswine's Ice Shard, taking super effective damage from the latter two.</p> <p><strong>Special Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Even with boosted Psyshock, Latias struggles to break through most special walls without significant chip damage. Blissey is never 2HKOed by anything except +1 Life Orb Psyshock and can hit Latias with Toxic, but it should be wary of being given a Choice Scarf with Trick, however, as this will cripple it almost entirely.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor's high Base Power alongside Latias's ability to boost with Calm Mind makes Draco Meteor worthwhile despite its drawback of lowering Special Attack. This power is necessary to gain crucial 2HKOs at +1 on Hippowdon, Alomomola, and Suicune, as well as OHKOs on bulkier offensive Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Moltres. Using Psyshock as Latias's Psychic-type STAB move over Psychic allows it to target the lower Defense stats of Pokemon such as Blissey, Florges, and Sylveon. However, Psychic can be used for its noteworthy bump in power to break through physically defensive targets such as Suicune, defensive Mega Altaria, Cobalion, and Hippowdon without using Draco Meteor. Determine which move's benefits you would want for your team over the other. Roost provides Latias with reliable recovery and keeps it healthy throughout the game, which allows Latias to consistently keep up offensive pressure, sweep late-game, and be generally more self-sufficient. This is key for teams that rely on its defensive utility long-term. It can be exchanged, however, for Hidden Power Fire with Life Orb to reliably OHKO Scizor as well as do passable damage to other Steel-types not named Empoleon. The cost in longevity is quite steep, though, so it should be reserved for more offensive teams that already have a Z-Move user and don't need Latias to be around for long.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The neutral attack provided by Dragonium Z is ideal for sweeping, as well as for supporting teammates that need certain walls removed. At +1, for example, Devastating Drake will OHKO 0 HP Scizor with minimal chip damage, as well as Alomomola, Hippowdon, and Celebi from full health. Unboosted, it will OHKO most offensive Pokemon that don't resist it. Life Orb is preferable over a Z-Crystal in certain scenarios, as the power boost lets Latias achieve key 2HKOs at +1, most notably on Blissey, Sylveon, and Florges with Psyshock. It can also OHKO Cobalion and 2HKO Hippowdon at +1 if it opts for Psychic. Do note, though, that this cost in longevity is somewhat risky, as Latias is very reliant on its defensive utility to consistently come in and set up, meaning it should generally only be considered over a Z-Crystal if the aforementioned damage output is necessary or if your team already has a Z-Move user. As an alternative, Psychium Z gives Latias a more specialized Z-Move that allows sets carrying Roost to heavily damage Fairy-types as well as Cobalion, but a regular Psychic-type move is usually enough to do this on its own. For this reason, Psychium Z gives it an edge versus balance teams that rely on Fairy-types to check Latias. Levitate is extremely useful for exploiting bulky Ground-types such as Gligar lacking U-turn and Hippowdon. It also allows Latias to pivot in on offensive Ground-types such as Nidoking and Choice-locked Krookodile in a pinch, as well as avoid all grounded entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Latias's stellar defensive utility to your advantage by using the tier's many Ground-, Fire-, Water-, and Grass-types as setup fodder. Passive Ground-types like Hippowdon are generally good candidates for this, though Latias must be mindful of Toxic or phazing moves. Don't be afraid to set up on more passive Fairy-types such as Florges and Togekiss, either, as Latias's combination of Speed and special bulk allows it to set up on and break through them even in the face of super effective special attacks. This is extremely unique for a Dragon-type and allows Fairy-weak teammates such as Hydreigon and Krookodile to follow up by spamming their attacks much more freely. Latias can win most Calm Mind wars thanks to its reliable recovery, access to Psyshock, and nuking ability with Devastating Drake, so don't be afraid to stay in if an opposing Pokemon starts using Calm Mind alongside it. With careful prediction, Suicune, Slowbro, and Reuniclus all lose one-on-one to Latias if they choose to do this. Sets carrying Roost get to set up early and often, but you should nevertheless be discerning with which foes you choose to set up on, as it will only realistically get to do so once or twice. For example, Latias may be Toxic poisoned when attempting to set up on Hippowdon or bulky Water-types or take a big hit if it attempts to set up on offensive Pokemon such as Nidoking. Be careful when using Draco Meteor, as even with Calm Mind boosts, its main drawback of lowering Latias's Special Attack can prove extremely punishable in the face of opposing setup Pokemon like Scizor and Bisharp. Also, be mindful of defensive checks such as Klefki, Empoleon, and Alolan Muk waiting in the wings, as even with the proper coverage, Latias can be crippled by Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Pursuit, respectively, if they are healthy enough to take a boosted attack. Most of these Pokemon are heavily damaged by Devastating Drake at +1, however, and are quite easy to wear down.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Calm Mind Latias with Roost fits best on balance and bulky offense teams looking for a late-game sweeper that can exploit bulky offense and balance staples like Swampert, Hippowdon, Celebi, and Rotom-H. This set also greatly appreciates Pokemon that can pressure Steel-types and Pursuit trappers as well as put bulky Pokemon into range of its attacks. Moltres is a stellar check to most Steel-types by virtue of its typing and is capable of wearing down Pokemon that check Latias such as Mega Aerodactyl and Alolan Muk by forcing them to switch into its high-powered STAB moves. Due to Latias's Pursuit weakness and the ubiquity of Pursuit trappers, teammates capable of punishing such Pokemon are crucial for keeping them at bay. Cobalion, Heracross, and Mamoswine can all deter Choice Scarf Krookodile from locking itself into Pursuit or Alolan Muk from entering the field at all. Swords Dance Cobalion and Nasty Plot Infernape are both effective means of punishing Steel-types that need bulky Water- and Psychic-types worn down before they can do work, giving them great offensive synergy with Latias. Nihilego greatly appreciates Latias's ability to punish Ground- and Water-types and can assist in Latias's matchup versus bulky teams with Toxic Spikes. Bulky Stealth Rock users such as Hippowdon, Mega Aggron, and Empoleon are very effective starting points for a defensive backbone alongside Latias, as they are capable of keeping most of Latias's offensive checks at bay, can put its defensive checks into KO range with Stealth Rock, and appreciate Latias's ability to threaten out Electric-, Fire-, Water-, Grass-, and Ground-types in return.</p>"
      },
      "Electrium Z": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>An Electric-type move in conjunction with Electrium Z turns Calm Mind Latias into an extremely dangerous early- to mid-game wallbreaker that can beat down most key Steel-types with Gigavolt Havoc. Thunder provides the benefit of OHKOing bulkier Electric-weak Pokemon such as Moltres and Primarina, but Thunderbolt can be used if you do not opt for a STAB move, as Thunder's shaky accuracy makes it extremely unreliable as a primary attack. Ice Beam provides Latias with near-perfect neutral coverage alongside Thunder or Thunderbolt, but this comes at a drastic drop in power due to the lack of a strong nuke, so it fits best on teams that can afford to give it the space to set up. Draco Meteor can be run over Ice Beam to provide Latias with crucial STAB coverage and general nuking power it would otherwise lack, allowing it to KO bulkier offensive Pokemon not weak to Electric + Ice coverage, such as Mamoswine, Terrakion, and Rotom-H. Though generally not recommended alongside Ice Beam, Psyshock or Psychic grants Latias additional STAB coverage in exchange for Roost that allows it to more reliably damage Fighting-, Fairy-, and Poison-types, which lets it support Pokemon such as Zeraora and Crawdaunt by reliably damaging checks such as Mega Altaria, Amoonguss, and Terrakion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The Ground immunity provided by Levitate greatly expands Latias's setup opportunities, allowing it to make passive Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gligar into setup fodder and making it immune to grounded entry hazards.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Electrium Z Latias is incredibly effective at applying heavy offensive pressure early-game for offensive teams. Set up early to lure in an unsuspecting Steel-type and free up a teammate walled by Steel-types to win late-game. If you opt to run Electric + Ice coverage over a STAB move, the pool of Pokemon Latias sets up on and the support it requires change greatly. As it is geared more to long-term sweeping than outright wallbreaking, it needs a lot more free turns to become threatening and should generally only set up on Pokemon that can't touch it and that lack a status move, such as Primarina Choice-locked into a Water-type move, Rotom-C, and Chesnaught.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bulky offense teams appreciate Electrium Z Latias variants carrying Roost, as the combination of Calm Mind and BoltBeam is very conducive to sweeping, and they are able to compensate for non-STAB move Latias's lack of power unboosted. Spikes Chesnaught is an excellent deterrent to Pursuit trappers such as Choice Scarf Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl lacking Wing Attack and appreciates Latias's ability to exploit Poison- and Fire-types such as Amoonguss and Rotom-H. The chip damage provided by Spikes is also extremely crucial for putting Pokemon such as Empoleon and Scizor into KO range of a boosted Thunder if Gigavolt Havoc has already been used. Choice Scarf Krookodile is an excellent addition to bulky offense teams for its ability to revenge kill threats such as Nidoking, Terrakion, and opposing Latias, which Latias lacking a STAB move cannot do remotely reliably. Choice Band Scizor is similarly capable of revenge killing or Pursuit trapping such threats while providing the team with reliable priority. Reliable Scizor checks such as Cobalion, Rotom-H, and Moltres are necessary to give this set the breathing room to reliably set up, as bulkier variants of Scizor are only reliably damaged by boosted Gigavolt Havoc. The aforementioned examples also make for passable checks to Fairy-types. Electrium Z Latias running Draco Meteor also works extremely well on hyper offense teams in need of an early-game wallbreaker capable of blasting through bulky cores as well as luring in and heavily damaging Steel-types. Such Pokemon include physical wallbreakers such as Terrakion and Crawdaunt and sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor and Mega Sharpedo. Hyper offense teams can also get away with running Electrium Z Latias sets lacking recovery because they are dependent on overwhelming the opponent quickly before they are themselves overwhelmed, meaning that the burst damage gained versus key defensive foes is worth the trade-off of lacking longevity. Spikes support from Klefki is crucial to put Steel-types into KO range from +1 Gigavolt Havoc. Klefki's defensive utility also allows hyper offensive teams to fall back in the face of Pokemon capable of revenge killing Latias such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Mega Beedrill. This set is particularly good at exploiting Spikes due to its ability to punish the majority of the tier's entry hazard removers. Bisharp is another beneficiary of Spikes stacking strategies that has excellent offensive synergy with Latias due to its weakness to Fighting-types that Latias forces out and ability to cripple defensive Pokemon with boosted Knock Off. Revenge killers such as Mega Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Mega Manectric can follow up on holes punched by Latias early on while in return doing an excellent job keeping off offensive pressure by virtue of their high Speed and pivoting ability. Other attackers such as Togekiss and Mamoswine that are walled or offensively checked by Steel-types greatly appreciate Latias's ability to cripple Steel-types so they can freely set up or go for Ice-type attacks.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Latias's strongest STAB move, which is capable of OHKOing Krookodile and 2HKOing Hippowdon and Gligar when boosted by Choice Specs. Psyshock is Choice Specs Latias's preferred Psychic-type move due to its ability to hit special walls such as Blissey and Sylveon much harder than Psychic. Surf allows Latias to hit one of its main counters in Mega Steelix super effectively, as well as Aggron prior to Mega Evolution if it attempts to swap in. Surf is also Latias's most powerful attack versus most Steel-types, notably 2HKOing bulky Scizor after Stealth Rock damage. Thunderbolt is an alternative to Surf that allows Latias to hit Empoleon and is its best option against Calm Mind Slowbro, while still retaining the same power as Surf versus Scizor. It is, however, a very dangerous move to lock into, as it allows Choice Scarf Krookodile to freely Pursuit trap Latias, and Trick can instead be used to cripple Empoleon. Hidden Power Fire is another option that lets Latias OHKO all Scizor variants, 2HKO Mega Steelix after Stealth Rock, and deal decent damage to Mega Aggron. However, it has a low damage output in general and faces competition for the moveslot from Surf, which does more damage against neutral targets and is less easily taken advantage of by setup sweepers such as Terrakion and Pursuit trappers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Krookodile. Trick allows Latias to potentially cripple a switch-in such as Empoleon, Blissey, or Sylveon by giving them Choice Specs. Healing Wish allows Latias to trade its life in order to fully heal a teammate and cure them of status, allowing Latias to potentially change the outcome of a game. This permits Latias's teammates to play more aggressively earlier in the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Levitate is Latias's only ability, giving it an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. This provides it with more longevity in the absence of any recovery moves and an immunity to Ground-type moves that allows it to come in on Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Krookodile locked into Earthquake.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Choice Specs Latias is best used to break holes in the opposing team due to its strong coverage options limiting its switch-ins. In particular, it can lure in Mega Steelix and hit it hard with Surf and dent other Steel-types such as Scizor and Mega Aggron. Latias can take advantage of its resistances and special bulk to swap in on Pokemon such as Infernape and Nihilego, which it can either OHKO or force out. It should, however, be wary of switching in repeatedly due to its lack of recovery allowing it to be easily put into range of attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl. It should also be careful of physical Infernape sets, as U-turn or Choice Band-boosted attacks will do considerable damage to Latias. It is therefore ideal to bring Latias in on free switches or predicted double switches in order to preserve its HP. Latias should be careful about locking itself into its STAB moves, as being locked into Draco Meteor can provide free turns for Pokemon such as Swords Dance Scizor, Primarina, and Mimikyu, while being locked into Psyshock allows Pokemon such as Assault Vest Bisharp and Choice Scarf Krookodile to Pursuit trap Latias for free. Therefore, in matches against teams with bulkier Pursuit trappers such as Bisharp and Alolan Muk, it is often better to make double switches to rack up entry hazard chip damage on the opposing Pokemon until they are in range of Latias's Choice Specs-boosted attacks. Against bulkier teams featuring Pokemon that wall Latias's STAB moves, such as Sylveon and Mega Aggron, Latias can be played either in a high-risk, high-reward manner through careful prediction or more safely by using Trick earlier in the match to provide some immediate value via potentially disrupting part of the opponent's defensive core at the cost of reducing Latias's power throughout the match. Using Trick against more offensive teams is often not ideal due to the drop in power, as it allows Pokemon such as Scizor to swap into and set up on Latias more easily and causes Latias to lose the ability to revenge kill Pokemon such as Nasty Plot Celebi after a small amount of chip damage. If running Healing Wish, Latias should aim to use it if healing a teammate is important to winning the match. This is particularly valuable when used at the right moment, as Healing Wish offers the chosen target a free switch in, providing valuable momentum especially for more offensive teams. Latias can also use Healing Wish if its HP is too low for it to come in anymore, or if it is no longer useful and restoring a teammate's health would be of more benefit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Latias fits best on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its wallbreaking prowess and ability to soft check various offensive Pokemon such as Infernape and Nihilego. Entry hazard setters are essential in allowing Choice Specs Latias to secure various KOs, such as 2HKOing bulky Scizor with Surf after Stealth Rock damage. Cobalion is a particularly good choice, as it can punish Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Krookodile for locking themselves into Dark-type moves and act as a strong offensive check to Scizor. Nidoqueen is another good choice that can set either Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes, provide a pivot into Zeraora, which threatens to OHKO Latias after Stealth Rock with Knock Off, and help Latias check Pokemon such as Terrakion. It also helps to break bulky Steel- and Fairy-types, allowing Latias to spam its STAB attacks more freely. Tsareena is a solid hazard control option to pair with Choice Specs Latias, as it is able to pressure bulky Water-types that Latias struggles against, such as Suicune, while being able to provide Latias momentum with U-turn on predicted switches into Pokemon such as Amoonguss, giving Latias more opportunities to wallbreak. Empoleon and Sludge Bomb Tentacruel are also good choices for hazard removal, as they can help to check Primarina, which can punish Latias for being locked into Draco Meteor or Surf. Tentacruel can also help check Scizor and set up Toxic Spikes to wear down the opposing team. Due to Choice Specs Latias's weakness to Pursuit trappers, teammates that can discourage Choice Scarf Krookodile from locking itself into Pursuit such as Cobalion, Terrakion, and Lucario pair nicely, as they can use it doing so as an opportunity to set up. The former two and Swords Dance Lucario variants can also punish other Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon for using Dark Pulse due to the threat of a potential Justified boost, while Nasty Plot Lucario variants can help break stall teams. They can also help to break Steel-types, allowing Latias to more freely use its STAB attacks. Other offensive pivots such as Mienshao and Scizor synergize well with Choice Specs Latias, getting it in safely with U-turn, which offers it more opportunities to break holes in the enemy team. Assault Vest Mienshao in particular can repeatedly swap into Choice Scarf Hydreigon due to Regenerator, which is notable because Hydreigon easily forces Latias out every time it comes in. Pokemon such as Mega Altaria and Scizor greatly appreciate Choice Specs Latias luring in and weakening Mega Steelix for them, as well as wearing down other Steel-types such as Doublade and Mega Aggron. Mega Manectric appreciates Latias's ability to pivot into and remove Ground-types such as Hippowdon, allowing it to more freely use Volt Switch. It also appreciates Latias helping to break through specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Florges or potentially crippling them with Trick. In return, Mega Manectric is able to bring Latias in through Volt Switch against Pokemon such as Rotom-H to provide it with more wallbreaking opportunities. Moltres can help Latias take on Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Scizor thanks to its Fire-type moves and access to Flame Body, which allows it to punish contact moves such as Bullet Punch. In return, Moltres appreciates Latias being able to use Trick on defensive Pokemon such as Blissey that would otherwise indefinitely wall it.</p>"

      "3 Attacks + Roost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is a high-powered Dragon-type STAB move that hits most targets for neutral damage, giving Latias decent general firepower and the ability to threaten opposing slower Dragon-types. This firepower comes with the drawback of lowering Latias's Special Attack, however, making it a risky move to go for. Psychic grants Latias Psychic-type STAB coverage and a move that can threaten the tier's many Fighting-types, 2HKOing key physically defensive targets such as Cobalion and defensive Mega Altaria after Stealth Rock. Psyshock is not used because even with a Life Orb boost, it cannot 2HKO Blissey, Sylveon, or Florges, even after Stealth Rock. Hidden Power Fire gives Latias coverage versus most Steel-types, cleanly OHKOing Scizor and doing a decent chunk to Klefki with a Life Orb boost. However, Thunderbolt can be used for its ability to hit Empoleon and Togekiss for solid damage and decent neutral coverage against most Steel-types, giving Latias an edge versus balance teams that rely on them to check Dragon-types. Roost keeps Latias consistently healthy throughout the game and negates the main drawback of using a Life Orb, making its defensive abilities much more reliable. Lastly, Defog can be used over a coverage move to make Latias a decent entry hazard remover, but it is mostly outclassed in this role by Hydreigon, and losing out on the ability to hit Steel-types is very risky.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Levitate is Latias's only option for an ability, granting it a key immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Sticky Web, and Ground-type attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Latias checks a broad array of Pokemon by virtue of its typing and bulk. Use this to take advantage of these Pokemon to either fire off attacks or heal up as needed. Passive Ground-types such as Swampert as well as predicted Fire-type attacks from the likes of Volcanion and Rotom-H make for great opportunities for Latias to come in. Predict obvious switches to Steel-types early on to wear them down quickly with Hidden Power Fire, but be discerning with your predictions, as reading incorrectly versus Pokemon such as Terrakion, Moltres, and Nidoking can prove deadly. Though Latias can be tough to wear down thanks to its resistances and immunity to most entry hazards, be careful with its health while threats that it checks are still active, and be careful to position yourself so that Latias can use Roost for free. Be selective with the use of Draco Meteor, as even with a Life Orb boost, a -2 Latias is extremely easy to exploit with Pokemon such as Scizor and Cobalion, though they still take non-negligible damage from -2 Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is best used as a generalist attacker for bulky offense teams that already have wallbreaking power but still need Latias's defensive utility to keep Fighting-, Grass-, and Electric-types consistently in check. Offensive Moltres is a potent attacker for bulky offense and does an excellent job checking Steel-types as well as pressuring other checks to Latias such as Stakataka and Mamoswine. In return, Latias maintains decent pressure on Nihilego, non-Life Orb Starmie, Electric-types, and opposing Dragon-types that keep Moltres at bay. A means of punishing Pursuit trappers is crucial to allow Latias to reliably switch in and out throughout the game, as being trapped without recourse can prove devastating. Terrakion, Mamoswine, and Cobalion are all viable means of deterring Pursuit, especially from Choice Scarf Krookodile. Though Latias is a decent switch-in to Electric-types, it can nevertheless forfeit momentum by switching into Volt Switch from Mega Manectric, Rotom-C, and Rotom-H. For this reason, it should be used as a secondary switch-in to such Pokemon in favor of an Electric-immune teammate such as Hippowdon, Choice Scarf Krookodile, or Swampert. Steel-types pair extremely well with such Pokemon, as they are effective defensive checks to the Grass- and Dragon-types commonly used to punish them and benefit from Latias's ability to check Electric- and Fire-types. Klefki can wear down Latias's defensive checks into KO range thanks to Spikes as well as shut out most of Latias's offensive checks bar Scizor and Mamoswine thanks to its typing. Mega Aggron is a reliable Stealth Rock setter, a powerful tank, and a consistent hard check to Pokemon such as Scizor, Mega Aerodactyl, and opposing Latias.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor's high Base Power lets Choice Scarf Latias serve its role as a revenge killer, taking out threats like Infernape, Crawdaunt, and Zeraora with little to no chip damage. Psychic is used over Psyshock to more reliably revenge kill Fighting-types, as this set is extremely weak and needs all the power it can get. It also cannot do meaningful damage to special walls even with Psyshock. Trick allows Latias to cripple a switch-in such as Blissey, Empoleon, or Klefki for the duration of the game, which gives it an edge in stall and balance matchups that most Choice Scarf users lack. Defog can be used, though, as emergency hazard removal for more offensive teams that have a good enough matchup versus bulky teams. This is far from ideal, though, as Latias loses to most defensive entry hazard setters. Healing Wish is crucial to Latias's success as a Choice Scarf user, as it allows you to play much more aggressively with a given teammate and bring it back later in exchange for Latias's life.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Despite the Speed boost provided by Choice Scarf, Latias needs a Timid nature over Modest to outspeed other Choice Scarf users as well as Speed-boosting threats like Mega Sharpedo and Haxorus at +1. Levitate makes Latias immune to Spikes and deters foes from freely spamming Ground-type attacks, both of which are key for the frail teams that best utilize Choice Scarf Latias.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hold onto Latias to revenge kill offensive threats as well as bring a teammate back late-game with Healing Wish. If you don't find Choice Scarf Latias's Speed important for winning the game, feel free to use Trick early on to cripple obvious switch-ins. Taking a threat such as Blissey or Swords Dance Scizor out of the equation can prove an extremely powerful tool for supporting the team. Both of Latias's attacks are very easy to punish with Dark-, Fairy-, and Steel-types, and they can also be taken advantage of by Pursuit trappers such as Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl. Compensate for this by playing aggressively with your teammates and predicting how your opponent will react: for example, it is generally better to double switch out on a predicted switch to Empoleon than to give it a free turn. If using Defog over Trick, opportunities to use it are harder to come by than with normal Defoggers due to the nature of Choice items. Choice Scarf Latias will generally only get chances to use Defog if it forces out an opposing Pokemon or if you are OK with it taking an incoming attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As the fastest Pokemon in the tier, Choice Scarf Latias does well on offensive teams in need of a means for revenge killing Fighting-types, frailer offensive threats, and opposing Choice Scarf users. Certain balance teams that rely on slower wallbreakers also appreciate these attributes. Many setup sweepers as well as entry hazard-vulnerable offensive Pokemon appreciate Latias's ability to heal them up late-game, which enables much more aggressive gameplans. Scizor, Lucario, Heracross, Bisharp, Nidoking, and Crawdaunt are all potent offensive Pokemon that are easily worn down and revenge killed, making them prime candidates for Healing Wish. They also compensate for Choice Scarf Latias's unreliable matchup against defensive teams by taking advantage of walls Latias has shut down with Trick on top of being fantastic wallbreakers in their own right. Since Choice Scarf Latias is not a reliable check to Water- or Ground-types, a solid means of breaking defensive cores reliant on such Pokemon is needed. Mixed attacking Zeraora sets are very capable of this, as they compensate for Latias's lack of pivoting ability with Volt Switch and can serve as a backup fast Pokemon if Latias goes down.</p>"

  "Infernape": {
    "overview": "<p>Infernape is among the UnderUsed metagame's premier offensive threats, thanks to its multitude of valuable traits. Between a great Speed tier, good mixed offenses, and access to both physical and special boosting moves in Swords Dance and Nasty Plot, Infernape is extremely offensively versatile, capable of running several different viable sets and always leaving its opponent guessing. Furthermore, Infernape's excellent STAB combination in tandem with the massive amount of coverage options at its disposal allows it to hit almost the entire tier for super effective damage, severely limiting its checks. Access to two powerful STAB priority attacks in the forms of Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave further bolsters Infernape's offensive prowess, allowing it to pick off weakened threats with relative ease. Unfortunately, Infernape can often suffer from four-moveslot syndrome, which prevents it from covering everything it'd like to and allows certain Pokemon to check some of its sets. Infernape is also very frail without defensive investment, which leaves it extremely vulnerable to Pokemon that can hit it for super effective damage, such as Moltres and Mega Aerodactyl. Infernape also sits at a slightly exploitable Speed tier, given that big threats like Gengar and Latias can outpace and threaten it, which in tandem with its poor bulk can require intelligent play to put Infernape to full use.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Grass Knot can be used on Nasty Plot sets to OHKO bulky Water- and Ground-types like Mega Blastoise, Suicune, Swampert, and Hippowdon after a boost, but this comes at the cost of running priority making it easier to be revenge killed. A physically defensive set with Will-O-Wisp, Slack Off, Taunt and a STAB attack can allow Infernape to act as a defensive pivot that can handle Pokemon like Scizor and Bisharp, but it doesn't wall or inflict status on a significant number of threats and generally isn't as useful as the sets listed above. A suicide lead set with Stealth Rock and Endeavor is plausible due to Infernape's good Speed, but it faces competition with Azelf and Froslass due to their better Speed tiers and utility movepools. An offensive Stealth Rock set is also an option, but more often than not, this will limit Infernape's coverage.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Most Water-types will be able to easily take care of Infernape in one way or another. Swampert fears Grass Knot but can tank any of Infernape's other hits while OHKOing it with Earthquake in return. Starmie and +1 Mega Sharpedo can both outspeed and KO Infernape, though the latter should be wary of Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave. Pokemon such as Primarina and Suicune can tank hits and KO Infernape in return with powerful STAB attacks, but they should all be wary of various coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Although they can't directly switch in, fast Flying-types like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Pidgeot, and Tornadus can all outspeed Infernape and OHKO it with super effective STAB attacks. Bulkier Flying-types such as Togekiss and Moltres can tank various hits from Infernape and threaten it in return with their STAB attacks as well.</p> <p><strong>Latias</strong>: Latias takes minimal damage from both of Infernape's STAB attacks, resists most of its common coverage options, and is only hit hard by U-turn. It can in return outspeed Infernape and OHKO it with STAB Psyshock while recovering any damage taken later on with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Despite Infernape's good Speed, it is still outpaced and heavily threatened by faster Pokemon such as Gengar, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Beedrill and common Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Hydreigon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Due to Life Orb and Flare Blitz's recoil alongside Infernape's susceptibility to entry hazards and poison, it often struggles to maintain longevity throughout a match.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Infernape's Special Attack stat by two stages, turning it into a fearsome sweeper and wallbreaker. Focus Blast complements Fire Blast extremely well, OHKOing Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Volcanion, Terrakion, and Alomomola while also 2HKOing specially bulky threats in Alolan Muk and Blissey. When Fightinium Z has been activated, Focus Blast turns into a 190-Base Power All-Out Pummeling, capable of reliably OHKOing Blissey and Nihilego, which can otherwise both tank a hit and potentially cripple Infernape. Vacuum Wave provides strong priority that allows Infernape to easily pick off weakened threats while also easing its matchup against Mega Sharpedo.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs invested in Special Attack give Infernape as much of an offensive presence as possible, while 252 EVs invested in Speed with a Timid nature make it considerably fast. Fightinium Z allows Infernape to more easily break past Pokemon such as Blissey and Mega Altaria, which heavily strengthens its stall matchup. A Life Orb puts a huge amount of power behind Infernape's attacks, which allows it to break past foes more easily. It is worth noting that Vacuum Wave should be used over Grass Knot if Fightinium Z is run, however, due to All-Out Pummeling mostly eliminating the need for Grass Knot. Firium Z is also an option for more easily muscling past various Fighting-resistant foes, such as Mew, Sylveon, Florges, and Nidoqueen. However, this leaves Infernape with worse coverage than Fightinium Z overall. Blaze is the best ability for this set, giving Fire Blast immense power once Infernape is low on HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's best function is as a late-game sweeper, as Infernape sweeps quite well once its checks are removed. It can, however, also be put to use as an early-game wallbreaker that weakens opposing teams for another sweeper, and as a stallbreaker. If Infernape is looking to sweep late-game, it is best that faster Pokemon that can revenge kill it, such as Mega Manectric, Choice Scarf Krookodile, Mega Aerodactyl, and especially Latias are removed from play or have had their Speed lowered by either Sticky Web or paralysis. Various Water-types are also important to remove in order to allow Infernape to clean up. These Water-types include Starmie, which can outspeed and revenge kill Infernape, Primarina, which isn't OHKOed by Grass Knot, and Mega Sharpedo, which fears Vacuum Wave but otherwise can reach +1 with Speed Boost, outspeed Infernape, and OHKO it. Due to Infernape's frailty, it should only be switched into threats that it can tank hits from, like Scizor, and otherwise be brought into play with support from a pivot or after a teammate has fainted. It should mainly look to set up against foes that it forces out, such as Scizor, Blissey, and Mamoswine. Infernape should look to use All-Out Pummeling against Blissey in order to reliably secure a KO against it, though foes like Alomomola, Nihilego, and Alolan Muk also make good targets due to their ability to potentially cripple Infernape if they aren't KOed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trappers such as Mega Aerodactyl, Krookodile, and Scizor are key as partners thanks to their ability to dispose of big threats to it in Latias, Starmie, and Gengar. Electric-type Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Rotom-H are also appreciated as partners due to being able to dispose of the Water- and Flying-types that can impede Infernape's sweep. Grass-type Pokemon like Celebi and Tsareena can also pressure the Water-types that Infernape hates dealing with while reliably switching into Ground-type attacks as well. Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Krookodile can outspeed and pressure the fast Pokemon that Infernape is revenge killed by, like Latias and Mega Manectric. Pivots such as Hydreigon and Scizor are valuable as teammates due to their ability to lure in Blissey and Steel-types, respectively, while also bringing Infernape in safely. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Terrakion, Hippowdon, and Klefki allows Infernape to secure various KOs more easily.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is a powerful Fire-type STAB attack that aids Infernape in reliably revenge killing foes like Celebi, Scizor, and Cobalion. U-turn gives Infernape a way of reliably pivoting out of its predicted switch-ins and is also useful for chipping checks like Latias and Starmie quite a bit. Close Combat complements Flare Blitz quite well, hitting Pokemon like Terrakion, Krookodile, and Mega Sharpedo quite hard. Gunk Shot allows Infernape to revenge kill Primarina and Mega Altaria, which otherwise comfortably tank its attacks. Stone Edge can be used over Gunk Shot, hitting Flying-types like Mega Aerodactyl, Togekiss, and particularly Moltres, which otherwise walls this set, while also KOing Chandelure. Earthquake is an option for allowing Infernape to reliably revenge kill Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Zeraora while also hitting Pokemon like Tentacruel, Alolan Muk, and Volcanion super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed with a Jolly nature maximizes Infernape's offensive presence, allowing it to secure its niche as a reliable revenge killer. A Choice Scarf is used to allow Infernape to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and thus perform as one of the tier's best revenge killers. Blaze is the preferred ability, compensating for Flare Blitz's recoil damage by giving it a boost in power once Infernape is low on HP.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's main function is as a very reliable revenge killer, thanks to Infernape's good Attack and Speed. As such, Infernape should come in on a boosted setup sweeper, such as Cobalion or Terrakion, after a teammate has pivoted it in or fainted, and revenge kill it. If a setup sweeper with moderate bulk, like Latias or Mega Altaria, is to be revenge killed by Infernape, it is important that they are first weakened a bit through either pivoting or entry hazard damage. U-turn should be utilized as much as possible throughout the match, as it easily generates momentum and also allows Infernape's checks to be chipped fairly adequately. It is best to use U-turn when predicting a switch to a threat like Latias or Slowbro, as this will allow Infernape to deal some damage to them while bringing in a teammate capable of taking them on. Due to the drawbacks of Infernape's STAB attacks, they should only be used later on in a game when Pokemon resistant to them are removed or when Infernape can use them to a revenge kill a foe that doesn't resist them. This set has some use as an anti-lead thanks to Infernape's fast U-turn, which should be utilized against common leads on hyper offensive teams in Azelf, Froslass, and Krookodile to break their Focus Sashes and allow another teammate to finish them off. This set can also be put to use as a late-game cleaner due to Infernape's good Speed, but it should be noted that lots of support is required for this due to Infernape's middling power and the tier's plentiful number of Pokemon resistant to its STAB attacks.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Setup sweepers like Cobalion, Latias, and Scizor appreciate Infernape's ability to revenge kill opposing boosted threats, which allows them to more easily sweep later on in a match. Entry hazard support from the likes of Klefki, Swampert, and Hippowdon can punish the switches that Infernape forces while adequately chipping its checks. Entry hazard removal from Mega Blastoise, Starmie, and Tentacruel can alleviate Infernape's weakness to chip damage that comes with frequent pivoting. Pursuit trappers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile can trap and KO Latias and Starmie after Infernape has lured them in, which makes for a more reliable potential late-game sweep from Infernape. Slow pivots like Scizor and Rotom-H can form a VoltTurn core with Infernape in addition to reliably bringing it in to remove a foe. While they can't safely bring it into play, faster pivots like Mega Beedrill and Mega Manectric can also form a VoltTurn core with Infernape. Bulky Ground- and Water-types are often hard for Infernape to break through with this set, which makes Ground-type checks like Primarina and Feraligatr and Water-type checks like Mega Manectric and Celebi decent teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Overheat is Infernape's most powerful STAB attack, severely denting most foes that don't resist it. It does, however, drop Infernape's Special Attack by two stages upon being used. Fire Blast is an option over Overheat, sacrificing some power and accuracy for being easier to spam. Close Combat complements Infernape's Fire-type STAB attack of choice quite nicely, hitting Pokemon that tank it, such as Blissey, Empoleon, and Stakataka, for OHKOs while also nailing Dark-types like Hydreigon and Krookodile. Grass Knot covers the bulky Water-types that otherwise trouble Infernape, such as Swampert, Suicune, and Mega Blastoise. Slack Off provides Infernape with reliable recovery so it can switch into Pokemon it checks, such as Scizor and Bisharp, multiple times in a game and generate more opportunities for it to wallbreak. It can also prevent Infernape from being worn down too quickly due to Life Orb recoil. Gunk Shot hits Fairy-types, such as Primarina and Mega Altaria, for super effective damage while also 2HKOing Latias, which otherwise walls Infernape. Mach Punch is useful priority that can allow Infernape to easily pick off weakened foes. Earthquake is good coverage for hitting Pokemon like Tentacruel and Volcanion quite hard, but overall, it doesn't provide as reliable coverage as Infernape's other moves.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>168 EVs invested in Attack give Infernape a decent amount of physically offensive prowess, notably allowing it to OHKO Krookodile with Close Combat even after Intimidate. Maximum Speed investment with a Naive nature gives Infernape as much Speed as possible while cutting into its already mediocre Special Defense so not to decrease either offensive stat; Naive is preferred over Hasty because it allows Infernape to maintain its ability to soft check Scizor. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Attack, giving Overheat and Grass Knot a decent amount of power. Blaze is the preferred ability, giving Infernape a decently powerful Overheat or Fire Blast when it's low on HP. Iron Fist can also be used, however, in order to give Infernape's Mach Punch a decent amount of power if it's running the move. Life Orb is the preferred item, allowing Infernape's attacks to have a considerable amount of power put behind them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set has multiple potential uses in a match. It can be used as an early-game wallbreaker due to Infernape's good coverage, and it can also be used to clean up late-game when checks have been weakened, thanks to Infernape's good Speed. So not to further limit Infernape's longevity with Life Orb recoil, it is best that careful prediction is used with this set. For example, if predicting the switch to a Pokemon that tanks either of Infernape's STAB attacks, such as Swampert or Mega Altaria, it is best to use super effective coverage, like Grass Knot and Gunk Shot, to nail these threats. Since it will often wear itself down with Life Orb recoil alone, Infernape should be brought into play when it's capable of punching as big of holes in opposing teams as possible, which means that faster Pokemon capable of KOing it should be removed or weakened into range of a KO from Mach Punch. It should also be brought in via support from a pivot or after a teammate has fainted for similar reasons. Slack Off is best used when Infernape forces a foe out with super effective STAB options or coverage moves so it can help mitigate Life Orb recoil and enable it to wallbreak more easily and for longer, particularly against defensive teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Answers to Flying-types, such as Rotom-H, Mega Manectric, and Mega Aerodactyl, will be appreciated due to Infernape's difficulty hitting Pokemon like Moltres and Mantine. Pursuit trappers, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Scizor, and Choice Scarf Krookodile, are capable of disposing of Infernape's biggest checks in Latias and Starmie, which makes a late-game sweep easier. Infernape's ability to lure in various Water- and Fairy-types means Pokemon that appreciate these gone, like Mega Sharpedo, Krookodile, and Moltres, will appreciate its wallbreaking capabilities. Entry hazard support from the likes of Mamoswine, Hippowdon, and Klefki, which can also provide Thunder Wave support, is helpful for punishing switches and giving Infernape an easier time breaking past foes. Entry hazard removal, while not mandatory, is also quite helpful due to the fact that Infernape will often switch in and out of play, which makes the likes of Tentacruel, Mega Blastoise, and Defog Hydreigon potentially useful teammates. Lastly, slow pivots, like Scizor, Gligar, and Rotom-H, can safely bring Infernape into play.</p>"

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Flare Blitz is an extremely powerful STAB attack, and when boosted by Choice Band, it allows Infernape to OHKO big metagame threats like Cobalion, Mega Manectric, and Nidoking. It also does significant damage to notably bulky Pokemon, 2HKOing the likes of Florges, Sylveon, and even Fire-resistant foes like Chandelure without Flash Fire after Stealth Rock. U-turn allows Infernape to pivot out of undesirable situations, such as matchups against Tentacruel and Hippowdon, while also severely denting typical switch-ins like Latias and Slowbro. Close Combat allows Infernape to OHKO Rock-types like Mega Aerodactyl and Terrakion, while also dealing heavy damage to various bulky threats that resist Flare Blitz, notably 2HKOing Pokemon like Volcanion, Mega Blastoise, and Swampert after Stealth Rock. Mach Punch is a powerful priority move that is useful for picking off weakened threats, like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Sharpedo. Gunk Shot allows Infernape to lure in and nail Mega Altaria, which otherwise tanks all of Infernape's hits. Stone Edge gives Infernape a way of covering certain Flying-types like Moltres, while also hitting opposing Fire-types like Volcanion and Chandelure. Earthquake is another option that covers Tentacruel and Chandelure, which both wall this set, while also hitting the likes of Nidoqueen and Volcanion for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs invested in Attack maximize Infernape's wallbreaking prowess, while 252 EVs in Speed with a Jolly nature make it as fast as possible, notably giving it the ability to outspeed threats like Hydreigon, Celebi, and Tentacruel. Iron Fist is the preferred ability if Mach Punch is being run to increase the move's Base Power, though Blaze is useful otherwise for boosting the power of Flare Blitz once Infernape is low on health. A Choice Band gives Infernape its impressive physical wallbreaking capabilities, allowing it to KO Pokemon like Sylveon and Florges.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's main function is as a powerful wallbreaker, thanks to Infernape's good Speed and high Attack with a Choice Band. It is best to use U-turn as much as possible earlier on in a match, as this will adequately chip Infernape's checks for teammates to finish them off. Flare Blitz and Close Combat should only be used once Pokemon resistant to them are significantly weakened, as they become quite easy for Infernape to spam late-game to punch holes for sweeping teammates. If it's being run, Mach Punch should only be used for revenge killing purposes. This means that when a foe like Terrakion or Mega Sharpedo is significantly weakened, it is best for Infernape to then be switched into play, as it can then reliably pick them off with priority.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pursuit trappers like Bisharp and Scizor alleviate Infernape's weakness to faster Psychic-types like Latias, Starmie, and Azelf, allowing it to more easily wallbreak. Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile can pressure the Pokemon that outspeed and threaten Infernape, like Gengar, Mega Manectric, and Mega Aerodactyl. Other means of speed control, such as Thunder Wave from Klefki and Togekiss and Sticky Web from Araquanid, can be used to help Infernape outspeed some Pokemon it normally wouldn't, but this usually isn't as reliable. Grass-types like Celebi and Tsareena can switch into and pressure the Ground- and Water-types that Infernape hates dealing with. Flying-type switch-ins like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Aggron, and Empoleon are also helpful for better handling Pokemon like Moltres and Togekiss. Pivots such as Scizor and Mega Manectric form a VoltTurn core with Infernape and can safely bring it into play. Entry hazard support from the likes of Mamoswine, Hippowdon, and Froslass can help Infernape break past bulkier foes more easily and punish switches. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Hydreigon, Tentacruel, and Mega Blastoise can also be important for preventing Infernape from taking too much residual damage from pivoting.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is mandatory for boosting Infernape's Attack stat by two stages and turning it into a threatening sweeper. Flare Blitz is a powerful STAB move that, once boosted, at worst 2HKOes anything that doesn't resist it. Close Combat nails Pokemon that resist Flare Blitz, such as Hydreigon and Terrakion, while also 2HKOing Swampert on the switch after a boost. Fightinium Z turns Close Combat into a powerful All-Out Pummeling, allowing Infernape to OHKO Pokemon like Hippowdon, Swampert, and Primarina at +2. Mach Punch can be used to pick off weakened or frail threats. It also dissuades Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Hydreigon from easily revenge killing Infernape. Thunder Punch dents Water-types like Slowbro and Starmie that boast resistances to both of Infernape's STAB attacks. With Electrium Z, Thunder Punch turns into Gigavolt Havoc, which at +2 can OHKO even the bulkiest Water-types in Alomomola, Suicune, and Slowbro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack gives Infernape great power behind its attacks, while maximum investment in Speed with a Jolly nature gives it a good amount of Speed. Iron Fist is the preferred ability, as it puts a good amount of power behind Thunder Punch and Mach Punch. Fightinium Z is preferred for this set, allowing Infernape to break past Pokemon like Swampert and Hippowdon more easily. Electrium Z helps Infernape KO the bulky Water-types that it lures in like Mega Blastoise and Slowbro. Firium Z is an alternative option that allows Infernape to plow through bulkier Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Sylveon that resist Close Combat. Life Orb is also an option if another teammate is using a Z-Move, as it puts a considerable amount of power behind Infernape's attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's function is as a late-game cleaner, as Infernape can break past teams most reliably once its checks have been removed or weakened. Pokemon that outspeed and pressure Infernape, like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Manectric, are very important to remove so as not to leave it vulnerable to being revenge killed, while Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Latias are important to dispose of for similar reasons. Various Water-types are also important to remove; Mega Sharpedo can outspeed Infernape after Speed Boost and threaten it if it doesn't have Mach Punch, Swampert can tank any of Infernape's hits comfortably aside from a boosted All-Out Pummeling, and Starmie outspeeds and revenge kills it. Setup opportunities can be found against Pokemon that Infernape forces out, like Scizor and Blissey, as well as against Pokemon that can't adequately damage it, like Assault Vest Bisharp and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>The likes of Choice Scarf Krookodile, Alolan Muk, and Scizor can use Pursuit to trap and KO Pokemon like Latias and Starmie, which heavily impede Infernape's sweep. Means of dealing with Pokemon faster than Infernape, such as Thunder Wave Klefki, Thunder Wave Togekiss, and Choice Scarf users, are good ways to take care of threats like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Manectric, which otherwise revenge kill it. Grass-types such as Celebi and Roserade are appreciated as teammates thanks to their ability to pressure the Ground-types that Infernape struggles to break through at times, such as Swampert and Hippowdon. Electric-types like Rotom-H and Mega Manectric are also helpful teammates, as they can dispose of the Flying-types that often outspeed and KO Infernape. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Klefki and Nihilego is key to the success of this set, as it allows Infernape to secure various KOs, such as the OHKOs on Alomomola and Suicune with Gigavolt Havoc, much more reliably.</p>"

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>Roserade holds a niche as a powerful attacker thanks to its massive base 125 Special Attack and ability to hit nearly the entire tier for neutral damage. Access to Poisonium Z alongside two powerful STAB attacks allows Roserade to threaten the common defensive backbones consisting of Fairy-, Ground-, and Water-types that flood the UU tier. Useful utility in Sleep Powder coming off a fast base 90 Speed stat and a Technician-boosted Hidden Power Fire gives Roserade a way to bypass its common checks while providing free turns for its entire team. Furthermore, a Grass / Poison typing enables Roserade to absorb Scald, Toxic, and Spore from defensive Pokemon on offensive teams while still providing respectable damage output thanks to its high Special Attack. However, its terrible base 60 HP and 65 Defense means that Roserade is revenge killed by faster offensive threats like Mega Aerodactyl, Infernape, and Latias and strong priority users like Choice Band Scizor, and Roserade even struggles switching into hard-hitting resisted attacks from slower Pokemon like Primarina's Moonblast. Roserade's longevity is also hampered by its proneness to being Pursuit trapped once weakened by Mega Aerodactyl and Krookodile, two very common attackers in the metagame.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Sleep Powder is a great utility move to ease prediction and induce sleep on common switch-ins like Mega Aggron and Klefki or Pokemon Roserade outspeeds and cannot OHKO in a single turn, giving it more chances to fire off its powerful attacks. Leaf Storm is Roserade's strongest STAB attack that hits unresisted foes like Mega Aerodactyl, Tentacruel, and Gligar for respectable amounts of damage. Sludge Bomb is a phenomenal secondary STAB move that targets foes that do not mind switching into Leaf Storm such as Latias, Hydreigon, and Mega Altaria. Hidden Power Fire becomes a powerful coverage move when boosted by Technician, allowing Roserade to OHKO Scizor and dent other Steel-types like Cobalion and Doublade that resist its STAB attacks. Giga Drain can be used over Leaf Storm as a 100% accurate STAB attack that provides slightly more longevity than Leaf Storm, but it is usually inferior due to the noticeable power drop and Roserade's mediocre bulk.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Timid nature maximizes Roserade's Speed and prevents it from being outsped from otherwise problematic Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Nidoking, and Togekiss. Poisonium Z turns Sludge Bomb into Acid Downpour, allowing Roserade to break past slower defensive Pokemon like Rotom-H and Amoonguss with some prior damage and catch faster offensive Pokemon like Latias, Hydreigon, and Kyurem on the switch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Roserade should be used as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker on offensive teams because its mediocre Speed gives it difficulty sweeping and usually makes it easy to revenge kill. Roserade has a respectable base 105 Special Defense, so try to bring it in against Pokemon that cannot do much damage to it, such as Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Florges. Against more offensively inclined teams, Roserade will struggle switching into resisted attacks like Primarina's Moonblast and Mega Altaria's Return. As such, it's best to attempt to bring it in via U-turn, Volt Switch, or a predicted double. If Roserade is in a favorable matchup and a switch to a faster Pokemon like Latias, Gengar, or Nihilego is predicted, use Sleep Powder to hinder the check and gain free turns for Roserade or its teammates. Hidden Power Fire should be used on predicted switches if the opponent's Roserade check is a Steel-type that can be 2HKOed by it, such as Cobalion, Scizor, and Doublade. If the Pokemon predicted to switch in is slower than Roserade and the opponent's Steel-type is worn down, use Acid Downpour to deal massive damage to Pokemon like Kyurem and Hydreigon that attempt to pivot into Roserade and force it out. Try to use Leaf Storm when Roserade finds itself in a favorable matchup against Ground- and Water-types or if a foe has been put to sleep already, as even common Pokemon that resist it like Cobalion and Hydreigon will take a sizable amount of damage. However, be wary of the Special Attack drop that it brings, as it almost always forces Roserade to switch out and will make it more prone to being revenge killed or trapped by Pursuit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Roserade fits best on offensive teams that appreciate a burn, poison, and sleep absorber that can still hit hard and provide utility with Sleep Powder. Pursuit users such as Krookodile, Scizor, and Mega Aerodactyl make for good partners, as they can potentially trap faster problematic Pokemon like Latias and opposing Mega Aerodactyl. Roserade's poor Defense and mediocre Speed means that it's able to get Pursuit trapped when weakened; as such, Pokemon that can take advantage of Pursuit users have good offensive synergy with Roserade. Fighting-types like Cobalion and Terrakion fit this role nicely and also help weaken specially defensive walls for Roserade. Roserade struggles switching into most attacks, so having pivots like Gligar, Scizor, and Mega Manectric on offensive teams to bring it in safely is greatly appreciated. Similarly, it's important to have defensive Pokemon like Gligar and Diancie that are able to switch into faster offensive Pokemon that threaten Roserade out, such as Infernape and Latias. Mega Altaria, Scizor, and Mega Aerodactyl appreciate Roserade weakening Steel-types with Hidden Power Fire or inducing them with sleep, as this gives them an easier time cleaning late-game. Mega Altaria can potentially set up on a Pokemon locked into Pursuit, while Scizor and Mega Aerodactyl can revenge kill Pokemon like Terrakion and Latias that trouble Roserade. Stealth Rock setters like Cobalion, Terrakion, and Gligar possess good synergy with Roserade and can help soften its checks through residual damage.</p> <h4>Other Options</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes or Spikes can be utilized to wear down certain switch-ins, but these options are generally inferior because Roserade functions better as a threatening attacker able to break past its checks with the help of Sleep Powder. Life Orb can be used over Poisonium Z if the Z-Move is taken by another member on the team, but it will wear down Roserade even faster throughout the match and make it easier to revenge kill. Black Sludge is another option if the Z-Move is not available and Life Orb's damage is unwanted, but the power difference between this set and the previous two is noticeable.</p> <h4>Checks and Counters</h4> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Latias, Infernape, and Celebi can outspeed Roserade and OHKO it with their strong STAB attacks or Z-Moves but are all hit hard by Roserade's STAB attacks. Common Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Hydreigon can't switch into Roserade directly but can revenge kill it after some prior damage or pivot out into another teammate on a forced switch, even if their Choice Scarf is removed.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Mega Aggron, Bronzong, and Klefki can comfortably take a Hidden Power Fire and proceed to deal massive amounts of damage in the case of the former two or cripple it with Thunder Wave in the case of the latter. However, none of these Pokemon appreciate being put to sleep by Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor, Ice Shard from Life Orb Mamoswine, and Sucker Punch from Life Orb Bisharp can all OHKO Roserade after Stealth Rock damage before it gets a chance to attack; however, the latter can be put to sleep with Sleep Powder before it attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Blissey, Nihilego, and even the rare Alolan Muk can comfortably handle any attack that Roserade tries to throw at them and proceed to set up entry hazards or revenge kill it. Blissey deserves a special mention, as it does not mind being put to sleep by Sleep Powder thanks to Natural Cure.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon has a solid niche as a special wall due to it possessing a great defensive typing in Water / Ground combined with a high HP stat and decent Special Defense. Gastrodon stomachs numerous hits comfortably from menacing special wallbreakers such as Gengar, Nidoking, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and its Ground typing blocks Mega Manectric’s and Rotom-H’s Volt Switch and shuts down vital momentum. Storm Drain also grants a Water immunity for Gastrodon that makes it a solid switch-in to Tentacruel, Mega Blastoise, and Volcanion. What really sells Gastrodon compared to its Water / Ground counterparts in Swampert and Seismitoad is its access to reliable recovery, which further bolsters its strong defensive typing and lets it continuously check the aforementioned threats. However, Gastrodon lacks the ubiquitous Stealth Rock, unlike Swampert and Seismitoad, in a metagame that's favorable towards role compression. Gastrodon's typing is only weak to Grass, but it openly invites Grass-types like Celebi and Amoonguss onto the field with no repercussions and gives them free turns to act. Gastrodon is also a passive Pokemon that leaves it set up on by common sweepers such as Mega Altaria and Togekiss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Beam gives Gastrodon the coverage it needs to harm Grass-types and Mega Altaria, but its poor damage output leaves it eclipsed by Earthquake, which is Gastrodon's main attack for removing various special attackers that it checks. Gastrodon could utilize an offensive Groundium Z set with Scald, Earth Power, Ice Beam, and Recover, but this often invalidates Gastrodon’s main niche as a special wall. Curse can give Gastrodon a stronger matchup against physical wallbreakers, but it's largely inconsistent against any other of Gastrodon's matchups.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Gastrodon is almost hopeless against Grass-types like Celebi, Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Tsareena due to its quadruple weakness to Grass and gets obliterated by any of their primary attacks. It can cripple some of them with Toxic, but it will always be threatened out by them. Gastrodon should also watch out for Grass-type coverage from Mega Manectric, Zeraora, and Nihilego.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Setup Sweepers</strong>: Mega Altaria and Togekiss exploit Gastrodon's passivity and use it as setup fodder due to their access to Refresh and Heal Bell, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers</strong>: Gastrodon can be overwhelmed by physical wallbreakers like Scizor, Terrakion, and Crawdaunt, albeit they must all watch out for a potential Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Users</strong>: Toxic from various users like Hippowdon, Gligar, and Slowbro severely cripples Gastrodon's longevity and ability to check its victims.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gastrodon uses Toxic to cripple defensive walls such as Slowbro, Jellicent, and Chesnaught. It should also be noted that Toxic is Gastrodon's form of pressure against Dragon-types like Latias and Hydreigon that could care less about its attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Storm Drain only further improves Gastrodon's defensive typing by adding a second immunity. This lets Gastrodon easily switch into Water-type attacks from Tentacruel, Primarina, and Starmie while also adding a marginal boost to Gastrodon's Scald if it stays in.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Gastrodon's higher Special Defense, it can be played much more liberally against the likes of Gengar and Nidoking. On the contrary, Gastrodon's poor Defense prevents it from being too hasty in switching into physical attackers like Cobalion or physical Infernape that its counterparts can handle more easily. Gastrodon also grants teams a valuable Volt Switch immunity against various pivots like Rotom-H, Mega Manectric, and Zeraora; however, it should still be wary of Toxic from the first and Grass-type coverage from the latter two. Double switching is a plausible strategy due to Gastrodon inviting Grass-types on the field for free, so an aggressive switch can be beneficial based on the scenario. Gastrodon can use Scald to fish for possible burns against some Grass-type switch-ins like Chesnaught and Tsareena to sabotage their offensive presence.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Gastrodon should mainly be used on balance builds that find its higher Special Defense compared to Swampert and Seismitoad valuable to safely switch into wallbreakers like Gengar, Nidoking, and Starmie. Gastrodon easily benefits from the most consistent switch-ins to Grass-types like Latias, Togekiss, and Rotom-H, and the latter two appreciate Gastrodon checking Mega Manectric and Rotom-H. Gastrodon's resistance to Fire-type moves makes it a strong partner for Mega Aggron, which can set up Stealth Rock while also walling most offensive Grass-types that threaten Gastrodon out. Other Stealth Rock users, mainly Cobalion, Bronzong, and Diancie, also pair well with Gastrodon, either boasting a Steel typing or being a secondary Nidoking check that relieves pressure off of Gastrodon. Tentacruel, Empoleon, and Rotom-C synergize well with Gastrodon, as they provide hazard removal; in return, Gastrodon can pivot into Nidoking and multiple Electric-types. In a similar vein, Poison-types like Amoonguss minimize the chip damage that can eat away at Gastrodon by removing Toxic Spikes. Choice Scarf Infernape pressures Grass-types and also appreciates Gastrodon's Water immunity. Choice Scarf Hydreigon values Gastrodon reliably checking Substitute variations of Gengar and absorbing Water-type attacks. Heal Bell users such as Mega Altaria and the aforementioned Togekiss and Diancie replenish Gastrodon by removing Toxic. Rotom-H can benefit from Gastrodon's Storm Drain so it can pressure bulky Water-types more reliably. Gastrodon also appreciates Rotom-H's defensive typing to check some physical wallbreakers like Scizor.</p>"

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzong's great defensive typing, ability, and natural bulk allow it to check many common threats in UU, such as Mega Altaria, Latias, Togekiss, and Mamoswine. Furthermore, thanks to Levitate and its typing, Bronzong is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes and resistant to Stealth Rock, which further improves its defensive capabilities. Its ability to switch into a variety of Pokemon also provides it with a lot of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. However, Bronzong is extremely passive and slow, making it easily exploitable and causing it to be setup bait to other threats such as Scizor, Cobalion, and Doublade. It also faces a lot of competition from other less passive Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix. Bronzong is also crippled by the common Pursuit, so it is threatened by Krookodile. Furthermore, Bronzong also lacks reliable recovery and is forced to rely on Leftovers in order to remain healthy, meaning it can get worn down rather quickly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire allows Bronzong to hit Scizor super effectively, which prevents it from switching in for free. Bronzong still loses to it in a one-on-one situation, however. Earthquake can also be used, as it OHKOes Magneton and deals a significant amount of damage to Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Empoleon. However, Psywave is usually enough to deal with most of the threats Earthquake hits. Bronzong could function as a dedicated Trick Room setter with Explosion, but such a set only fits on very specific teams. A dual screens set might seem like an appealing option to provide its teammates with more opportunities to set up, but it's usually outdone by Klefki, which is a more reliable setter thanks to Prankster.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types resist Bronzong's STAB moves and are immune to Toxic, so they can easily use setup moves, set entry hazards, or remove hazards against Bronzong. Cobalion, Doublade, Empoleon, and Scizor are examples of such Pokemon. Magneton is particularly threatening because it can trap Bronzong with Magnet Pull. However, most Steel-types can get worn down by Psywave, preventing them from setting up.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Mega Sharpedo, Hydreigon, and Krookodile can threaten Bronzong with their STAB moves. Hydreigon takes a considerable amount of damage from Gyro Ball, however. A lot of Dark-types such as Alolan Muk and the aforementioned Krookodile can also trap Bronzong with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Infernape, Chandelure, and Moltres resist Gyro Ball and can force Bronzong out with their STAB moves. Additionally, the aforementioned Pokemon can use Bronzong as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon like Doublade and RestTalk Suicune don't fear much from Bronzong because they take very little from Gyro Ball and are unfazed by Toxic, so they can set up on it with ease. Reuniclus is especially threatening, as it has reliable recovery.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock damages foes when they switch in, and Bronzong is a very reliable setter of it thanks to its great bulk. Toxic is used to wear down opposing Pokemon and allows Bronzong to cripple Pokemon that would otherwise wall it, such as Alomomola. With Gyro Ball, Bronzong can take advantage of its low Speed and threaten faster Pokemon, such as Mega Altaria and Mega Aerodactyl, more easily. Heavy Slam can be used instead, which deals more damage to Pokemon like Sylveon and has more PP. However, it's usually much weaker than Gyro Ball, notably against Pokemon like Mamoswine and Hydreigon. Psywave allows Bronzong to hit Pokemon that would normally check it, such as Doublade and Cobalion, for a considerable amount of damage. Protect is another option that can provide an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and scout for moves and Choice-locked Pokemon. It also works well with Toxic, as foes take additional turns of damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and Special Defense EVs with a Sassy nature maximize Bronzong's defensive capabilities, allowing it to switch into Pokemon like Latias and Mega Pidgeot more easily. Additionally, Bronzong's Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs decrease its Speed to make Gyro Ball stronger. Levitate grants Bronzong the opportunity to check Ground-types, such as Mamoswine and Nidoking, which its typing wouldn't normally allow it to. Leftovers provides Bronzong with a form of passive recovery, increasing its longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bronzong should be used as a pivot throughout the match. Take advantage of the amount of Pokemon Bronzong checks and use any given opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. However, keep in mind that it lacks reliable recovery and can get worn down pretty quickly. Be careful using Protect when there are Pokemon on the opposing team that can use Bronzong as setup bait, such as Doublade and Cobalion. Furthermore, be wary of Pursuit users like Krookodile, since they can weaken Bronzong severely. Use Psywave to chip Pokemon that would normally check Bronzong, such as Scizor and Cobalion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bronzong fits best on balanced teams that can take advantage of its resistances and access to Stealth Rock. Pokemon that appreciate Bronzong's ability to switch into a variety of threats pair well with it. Suicune appreciates Bronzong's ability to switch into almost any variant of Latias, as well as Grass-types such as Celebi. Fighting-types such as Infernape and Chesnaught take advantage of Bronzong's ability to check Fairy- and Flying-types such as Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Mega Pidgeot, which are otherwise troublesome for them. Because it lacks reliable recovery, Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon and Alomomola is valuable to increase Bronzong's longevity. Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo can force Bronzong out with their STAB moves. As such, Pokemon that can check them like the aforementioned Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Choice Scarf Infernape make great partners. Pokemon that can sponge attacks from Fire-types and force them out, such as Suicune and Hydreigon, pair well with Bronzong. Suicune is also a particularly good teammate because its attempts to sweep are eased by Bronzong's ability to weaken the opposing team by setting up Stealth Rock and badly poisoning foes. Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Rotom-H also make good partners, as Bronzong struggles with Steel-types. Pokemon that can take advantage of Stealth Rock, such as Mamoswine and Choice Band Terrakion, also pair well with Bronzong.</p>"

  "Lucario": {
    "overview": "<p>With good offensive stats, access to Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, and a wide movepool, Lucario is a menacing and unpredictable setup sweeper for offensive teams. It also has a good defensive typing with nifty resistances, allowing it to check Pokemon like Scizor as well as having an immunity to Poison, aiding in its ability to set up. However, this is offset by Lucario's meager defensive stats, meaning that it has to rely on forced switches and its resistances for setup opportunities. It also has a middling Speed stat that, while circumvented somewhat by its access to priority moves, leaves it vulnerable to faster threats that can take a hit, like Mega Aerodactyl and Krookodile. Lastly, Lucario faces heavy competition from the tier's plethora of other Fighting-types and struggles to stand out from the likes of Terrakion and Infernape.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thanks to Lucario's expansive coverage options, it can run a number of viable Z-Moves to bust through defensive checks with a single-use powerful attack in exchange for the consistent power boost of Life Orb. For example, +2 Flash Cannon-based Corkscrew Crash nets an OHKO on Amoonguss and Mew. Do be wary, though, that losing the power boost of Life Orb makes Lucario drastically weaker, thus greatly compromising its ability to consistently wallbreak. Crunch and Dark Pulse can be used on Swords Dance and Nasty Plot variants respectively, to allow Lucario to beat Ghost- and Psychic-type like Slowbro, Doublade, and Starmie.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Though Lucario is still strong without a boost, it is outsped and eliminated by a plethora of faster threats before it can get an attack off. Cobalion gets special mention, since it revenge kills the Swords Dance set effortlessly thanks to its high Defense and resistance to Extreme Speed and Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Bulky Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Doublade wall most Lucario variants with ease, but they must watch out for Dark-type coverage. Faster Ghost-types such as Gengar are particularly good at this, as they only have to worry about being put into range of +2 Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fighting-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Slowbro, Mantine, Gligar, and Amoonguss can check Lucario quite convincingly, although they can either be taken out by the appropriate coverage move or be easily worn down by boosted attacks.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Lucario's Special Attack by two stages, making it extremely deadly in a single turn. Focus Blast is a powerful STAB move, albeit inaccurate, that after a Nasty Plot boost, can KO many bulky Pokemon like Blissey, Hippowdon, and Swampert; it can also 2HKO Tentacruel. Aura Sphere is an alternative drawback-free option, but comes at the cost of significantly less power. Flash Cannon is a secondary STAB move that allows Lucario to hit Fairy-types. Vacuum Wave gives Lucario a form of priority, which means that it won't immediately fold to any faster attacker, such as Krookodile, Mega Aerodactyl, or Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Special Attack and Speed are fully invested in, as Lucario doesn't need any other stat to do its job. Fightinium Z provides a powerful one-time attack to help break through bulkier foes such as Quagsire and Alomomola. Alternatively, Life Orb can provide Lucario's attacks with the power to OHKO Pokemon like Hippowdon and Suicune if the Z-Move is best suited on a different teammate. Inner Focus, while situational, is better than Steadfast, since it stops the occasional Fake Out user from getting free chip damage on Lucario. It also stops other Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Togekiss and Hydreigon locked into Dark Pulse from taking Lucario down through flinches and stopping its sweep.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Special Lucario is more of a wallbreaker than a flat-out sweeper. As such, it does best versus balance and stall teams, although it still has an edge versus some offensive builds. Set up on something that can't touch it, such as Blissey or Amoonguss, provided something has already been put to sleep in the case of the latter. Fightinium Z should be used against bulky Pokemon such as Alomomola and Quagsire to give a teammate a chance to sweep. Vacuum Wave is a fairly weak move, meaning that faster threats like Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile must be weakened to be KOed at +2. Faster Fighting-resistant or -immune Pokemon like Latias, Gengar, and Starmie must be eliminated entirely if Lucario wants to sweep.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As a wallbreaker, Nasty Plot Lucario best pairs with Pokemon that appreciate the likes of Blissey, Slowbro, and Hippowdon being weakened and in return alleviate offensive pressure. Such Pokemon include Mega Aerodactyl, Suicune, Mega Beedrill, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon. Pursuit users can trap and eliminate a large number of Lucario's checks such as Jellicent, Doublade, Latias, and Slowbro. Spikes users, such as Klefki and Froslass, are very proficient at whittling down such Pokemon as well, putting them into KO range of a boosted attack. Klefki can also slow down faster Pokemon with priority Thunder Wave, giving Lucario the option to not have to rely on the relatively weak Vacuum Wave to get around them. Speed control in general makes this set's job much easier, and therefore this set is a viable option alongside a Sticky Web setter such as Araquanid. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Mega Manectric and Scizor allow Lucario to come in for free, maximizing its potential to do damage. Bulky pivots such as Doublade, Amoonguss, Slowbro, and Sylveon can hold their own versus offensive threats like Mega Aerodactyl, Infernape, and Latias, which would otherwise prevent Lucario from boosting or shrug off a hit and KO it.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance is needed to boost Lucario's Attack and allows it to set up for a sweep. Close Combat is Lucario's strongest, most reliable STAB move, and its main drawback of lowered defenses is negligible, since Lucario is very frail to begin with. Extreme Speed, with 80 Base Power and +2 priority, is one of this set's biggest selling points, since it nearly always goes first. This allows it to pick off frail or weakened targets without worrying about being outsped as well as take out would-be revenge killers, such as Hydreigon, Latias, and Infernape. Bullet Punch is a priority STAB move that allows Lucario to get around Mega Aerodactyl, Nihilego, and Terrakion, which resist Extreme Speed, as well as hit Fairy-types for super effective damage. Meteor Mash is a very powerful secondary STAB attack that can break through slower Pokemon that can take a Close Combat or Bullet Punch, such as Amoonguss, Mega Altaria, and Togekiss. Ice Punch is another option that lets Lucario break past Gligar as well as Nidoqueen.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Attack and Speed ensures that Lucario hits as fast and as hard as it can. Justified capitalizes on Lucario's resistance to Dark, allowing it to gain an Attack boost from moves such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. A Jolly nature allows Lucario to outspeed the likes of Mamoswine and Nidoking. However, an Adamant nature can be used if you're not worried about hitting the aforementioned threats, as it nets important OHKOs and 2HKOs; for example, Adamant Close Combat 2HKOes Quagsire after Stealth Rock. Life Orb provides a significant boost to all of Lucario's moves with relatively few drawbacks. It is preferable over other items because Lucario typically needs to KO what's in front of it to avoid getting KOed itself, making the effect on its longevity negligible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lucario should generally only be brought in after something on your team has been KOed, as it is frail and needs all the HP it can get in order to properly sweep. Ideally, you should wait until checks, such as Hippowdon and Doublade, have been weakened or eliminated before setting up. However, you can use Lucario as an early-game wallbreaker to set the stage for a teammate as well. Set up on Pokemon that Lucario can threaten, such as Nihilego, Blissey, and Choice-locked Hydreigon. Setup isn't always necessary, however, as Lucario is pressured to get off as much damage as possible and is quite powerful even without a boost. If your opponent sends out a Fighting-resistant Pokemon to stop Lucario, it is worth noting that resisted STAB Close Combat still does more damage than a neutral Extreme Speed, so don't be afraid to use it even against such targets.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Lucario shines best on offensive teams that require a late-game sweeper or an early-game wallbreaker. Users of Volt Switch and U-turn such as Mega Manectric, Rotom-H, Rotom-C, and Hydreigon can all bring in Lucario safely so that it's less likely to take a hit before setting up. Pursuit trappers such as Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl can eliminate Ghost- and Psychic-types. Nasty Plot Celebi threatens bulky Water-types that can take a hit from a boosted Lucario, such as Slowbro and Swampert, and also appreciates Lucario's ability to deal with Scizor and soft check Mega Aerodactyl with Bullet Punch. They also have decent defensive synergy, with Celebi resisting Water, Ground, and Fighting and Lucario resisting Bug and Dark. Spikes users such as Klefki are extremely helpful, as they can wear down particularly bulky checks over the course of the game. Lucario also does an excellent job of exploiting Sticky Web from Araquanid, as the speed control partly nullifies Lucario's main drawback over Cobalion in its lower Speed, and the entry hazard is right at home on hyper offense to begin with.</p>"

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon's great bulk and solid defensive typing allow it to act as a great wall, checking prominent threats such as Cobalion and Mega Manectric. Its bulk also allows it to make good use of support options such as Stealth Rock, and it even has access to reliable recovery in Slack Off. Additionally, its Sand Stream ability can be used to support teammates and wear down the opponent's team. However, Hippowdon is held back by its low Speed, forcing it to typically take an attack before being able to do anything. It is also weak to common offensive types in Water, Grass, and Ice. Finally, being a really passive Stealth Rock user, Hippowdon is forced to rely on Whirlwind in order to not become setup fodder.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stone Edge is an option to hit Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake; however, its practical use doesn't extend much beyond getting super effective damage on Moltres, Mega Aerodactyl, and Rotom-H. Fire Fang can be used to 2HKO most variants of Scizor.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Common Grass-types such as Celebi and Tsareena can easily switch into Hippowdon and force it out with their Grass-type STAB moves. Celebi doesn't mind switching into Toxic either thanks to Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Many Water-types are able to threaten Hippowdon with their STAB moves. All of them bar Suicune have to be wary of getting worn down by Toxic, though, and frailer ones such as Primarina do not appreciate taking an Earthquake while switching in.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Hippowdon has decent mixed walling capabilities, but it's still not able to stand up to powerful hits from wallbreakers such as Hydreigon and Kyurem. They can easily 2HKO or OHKO Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Aside from phazing them, bulky setup sweepers can easily exploit Hippowdon's passiveness to set up on it for free. This is especially so for Pokemon like Reuniclus that don't mind taking a Toxic due to Magic Guard.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Hippowdon can't do much to Pokemon like Gligar and Rest Mega Slowbro aside from using Whirlwind to phaze them, as Earthquake either can't touch them or doesn't do nearly enough damage.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Hippowdon can be worn down by Toxic with no way of getting rid of the status by itself, making it far easier for any physical attacker to break through it. Gligar is a good example because it's not only able to poison Hippowdon, but it's also immune to Earthquake and Toxic.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is a great support move, and Hippowdon is reliable at setting it up due to its great natural bulk. Earthquake gives Hippowdon a reliable STAB move in order to not be completely passive. Slack Off is important for keeping Hippowdon from getting worn down throughout the course of the match. Toxic is used to wear down foes, especially those that Hippowdon can't do much damage to with Earthquake, such as opposing Hippowdon and Latias. Whirlwind is an option to phaze opposing setup sweepers, such as Scizor, as well as racking up residual damage in conjunction with Stealth Rock and Sand Stream. However, running Whirlwind over Toxic leaves Hippowdon unable to do anything against most entry hazard removers like Latias and Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides passive recovery, which is really handy for a defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon. Rocky Helmet is an option to wear down physical attackers such as Cobalion and Bisharp. The given EV spread with an Impish nature allows Hippowdon to avoid getting OHKOed by +2 Cobalion's All-Out Pummeling at full health while still giving Hippowdon some special bulk. A fully physically defensive spread is also an option to better take on threats like Terrakion and Bewear; for example, it enables Hippowdon to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Terrakion's Close Combat after Leftovers recovery and Choice Band Bewear's Return. Sand Stream is the preferred ability on Hippowdon to wear the opponent's team down. However, use Sand Force if the sand cripples your team in ways like hindering certain recovery moves, such as Synthesis on Florges, or teammates being particularly troubled by the residual damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hippowdon mainly focuses on support in setting up Stealth Rock to chip away at the opponent's team when combined with Sand Stream and either Toxic or Whirlwind. Whirlwind should be used to phaze setup sweepers such as Scizor and Latias that may use Hippowdon as setup fodder as well as to prevent Pokemon such as Sylveon from healing themselves or weakened teammates with Wish. Hippowdon is able to check most physical attackers that can't hit it super effectively such as Cobalion, Mimikyu, and Bisharp, so it can reliably pivot into them and use them as an opportunity to potentially set up Stealth Rock. Slack Off should be used often throughout the match to keep Hippowdon healthy, especially due to Hippowdon's low Speed forcing it to usually take a hit or two before being able to fire off a move of its own. Finally, understanding Hippowdon's limits is essential; while it is a good mixed wall, it does not enjoy switching into and taking hits from strong wallbreakers such as Hydreigon and Gengar.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hippowdon gets easily worn down by Spikes, so Pokemon that can provide entry hazard removal for it such as Tentacruel, Starmie, Mega Blastoise, and Hydreigon are appreciated as partners. Grounded Poison-types such as Nihilego and the aforementioned Tentacruel are also useful for absorbing Toxic Spikes, as Hippowdon does not like getting poisoned. Nihilego also benefits from sand's Special Defense boost, allowing it to check Flying-types such as Moltres better. Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Celebi are able to switch into the Water- and Grass-type attacks that Hippowdon is weak to with ease. Celebi is particularly good, as with Natural Cure, it takes on status moves that Hippowdon typically doesn't like taking like Toxic and Will-O-Wisp. Water-types can take on the Ice- and Water-type attacks that target Hippowdon, with examples being Suicune, Mega Slowbro, Volcanion, and Starmie, the latter two of which also are able to keep entry hazards off the field for it. In return, Hippowdon can switch into any Electric-type attacks that threaten them. However, it's worth noting that the latter two Water-types are just as susceptible to status as Hippowdon is. Clerics such as Sylveon and Togekiss support Hippowdon very well, being able to remove status, which helps a lot with its longevity. Mega Aerodactyl and Hippowdon have really good synergy, with Sand Stream giving the former a boost in Special Defense, which allows it to reliably Pursuit trap threats such as Gengar, Celebi, and Latias that Hippowdon struggles to deal with. Hippowdon also takes on the Electric- and Rock-type moves that trouble Mega Aerodactyl. Doublade makes a great partner alongside Hippowdon, as it is able to check Cobalion and Terrakion, which Hippowdon can struggle to consistently check.</p>"

  "Toxicroak": {
    "overview": "<p>Toxicroak is able to carve a niche for itself in UU thanks to Dry Skin, which allows it to use the tier's ever-present bulky Water-types as setup bait. In addition to easily setting up against the likes of Alomomola and Suicune, it can utilize its decent typing to threaten a plethora of common threats, including Bisharp, Togekiss, and Primarina, while finding setup opportunities against big presences such as Amoonguss. Toxicroak also has access to useful coverage options like Sucker Punch and Ice Punch, which it can use to deal with the few Pokemon that don't already succumb to its STAB attacks. The former move can also patch up Toxicroak's vulnerability to several faster Pokemon that may try revenge killing it like Latias, Starmie, and Gengar. Unfortunately, Toxicroak is still often outperformed by similar Fighting-types in Infernape, Cobalion, and Terrakion due to its worse Speed, poorer type coverage, and lack of access to a reliable powerful Fighting-type attack. Toxicroak is also quite frail, which alongside its common weaknesses leaves it susceptible to several Pokemon that outspeed it like Mega Aerodactyl, Krookodile, and Hydreigon. Lastly, Toxicroak struggles to break past the tier's common defensive Ground-types, such as Swampert and Hippowdon, which can all tank an attack and OHKO it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Nasty Plot is Toxicroak's most viable alternative because of Toxicroak's good special coverage, access to Vacuum Wave, and decent power. However, such a set faces stiff competition from other Fighting-type Nasty Plot users in Infernape and Lucario due to its worse Speed, lower Special Attack, and slight four-moveslot syndrome.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Toxicroak's low Speed in tandem with its poor bulk leaves it open to KOs from faster Pokemon that are capable of stomaching a boosted Sucker Punch. Examples include Infernape, which can threaten Toxicroak with Fire-type attacks due to Dry Skin; Hydreigon, which resists Sucker Punch and can almost always OHKO with Draco Meteor; and Krookodile, which can lower Toxicroak's Attack to tank a Sucker Punch even more comfortably while KOing it with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: The likes of Moltres and Mega Pidgeot can easily tank a boosted Sucker Punch while OHKOing Toxicroak in return with their powerful Flying-type STAB attacks. Crobat is especially annoying, as it can easily come in on Toxicroak's STAB moves, tank a Sucker Punch, and OHKO it with STAB Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types resist both of Toxicroak's STAB moves and often have ways of crippling it. Tentacruel can punish the use of Drain Punch thanks to Liquid Ooze, while Nidoking Speed ties with Toxicroak and only fears +2 Black Hole Eclipse. The aforementioned Crobat is also often a particularly troubling opponent.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon, Swampert, and Quagsire are capable of tanking at least one hit from Toxicroak and heavily threatening it with STAB Earthquake in return. Krookodile can be particularly burdensome because of its ability to take a Sucker Punch and OHKO Toxicroak in return.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Although they fear Sucker Punch or Black Hole Eclipse, the likes of Latias, Starmie, and Celebi can threaten Toxicroak out with their 4x super effective STAB attacks, especially if its Attack isn't boosted, in which case Sucker Punch won't OHKO them beforehand.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Toxicroak's Attack to respectable levels, turning it into a formidable threat. Drain Punch is Toxicroak's preferred Fighting-type STAB attack because of its decent damage output and healing capabilities. Gunk Shot nails Fairy-types like Primarina, Mega Altaria, and Sylveon. It is also Toxicroak's best source of damage against most of the Water-types it sets up on, such as Alomomola, Suicune, and Mega Blastoise. When Poisonium Z activates, it becomes a powerful Acid Downpour, capable of OHKOing most neutral targets while patching up Gunk Shot's imperfect accuracy. Sucker Punch OHKOes the fast Psychic-types like Latias and Starmie that will try revenge killing Toxicroak after a boost. When Darkinium Z is activated, Sucker Punch turns into a powerful Black Hole Eclipse that is capable of powering through Pokemon that could otherwise tank a hit or evade Sucker Punch while crippling Toxicroak, most notably Mega Slowbro, Doublade, Bronzong, and Tentacruel, the latter of which can be particularly annoying due to its access to Haze and Liquid Ooze. Ice Punch can provide super effective coverage against Ground-types such as Gligar and Hippowdon. Knock Off can be used in the fourth slot to remove items and pressure a lot of slower Psychic- and Ghost-types, like Bronzong, Doublade, and Chandelure. However, Black Hole Eclipse achieves similar feats while also allowing Toxicroak to still use Sucker Punch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Attack maximizes Toxicroak's offensive presence with a neutral nature. Full Speed investment with a Jolly nature provides it with crucial Speed advantages over a few common threats, including Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Chandelure. Dry Skin is mandatory for securing Toxicroak's niche as a Pokemon that can utilize its pseudo-immunity to Water-type attacks to set up on Pokemon like Empoleon and Mega Blastoise. Life Orb puts a respectable amount of power behind all of Toxicroak's attacks, bolstering its sweeping capabilities. Poisonium Z is an option that Toxicroak can use alongside Gunk Shot to guarantee an OHKO on Pokemon such as Volcanion and defensive variants of Rotom-H. It also patches up Gunk Shot's slight accuracy issue. Darkinium Z can also be used in order to break past Pokemon like Jellicent and Doublade while still granting it access to Sucker Punch. It can also be useful for nullifying the use of Trick from Choice Scarf users such as Chandelure and Latias that may try evading Sucker Punch. The lack of power behind Toxicroak's STAB attacks is worth noting, however.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Toxicroak should look to begin sweeping once its defensive checks like Hippowdon and Swampert are removed. Revenge killers that don't fear Sucker Punch, such as Infernape and Choice Scarf Krookodile, should also be removed in order to maximize Toxicroak's chances of cleaning up late-game. When it's ready to set up, it should switch in on Water-types like Alomomola and Choice-locked Primarina because of the pseudo-immunity to their Water-type attacks that Dry Skin will provide. Dry Skin also helps Toxicroak check these Pokemon as well, as it may not be able to set up and sweep upon forcing them out but can still prevent them from fulfilling their roles. If running Poisonium Z, Toxicroak should activate it if it needs to secure a crucial KO without worrying about Gunk Shot's accuracy, such as against Volcanion, or if it wants to power through a defensive Pokemon like Alomomola or Suicune in one hit. If it's being run, Darkinium Z should be activated against threats that can cripple Toxicroak upon tanking a hit or evading Sucker Punch. Said threats include Doublade and Slowbro. Toxicroak should keep Sucker Punch hidden if Pokemon like Nihilego and Latias are on the opposing team, as they would likely think that they can easily revenge kill it if under the impression that it isn't running priority to OHKO them after a boost.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxicroak fits best on bulky offensive teams as a decent late-game cleaner and check to several hindrances to these archetypes, such as Alomomola, Suicune, and Empoleon. Entry hazard support is essential to Toxicroak's success because it can more easily break past foes that have taken residual damage. Swampert and Krookodile can both reliably set Stealth Rock for Toxicroak, while Klefki is particularly helpful in that it can allow Toxicroak to outrun several faster foes through crippling them with Thunder Wave in addition to providing Spikes support. Toxicroak's inability to break past most Ground-types means that checks to them, such as Mamoswine, Celebi, and Kyurem, often function as useful teammates. Lures to Ground-types, such as Grass Knot Infernape, are particularly useful because of their ability to remove the likes of Swampert, Hippowdon, and Rhyperior. Pokemon like Hippowdon and Scizor that are capable of taking care of most common revenge killers can aid Toxicroak in reliably dealing with the likes of Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Krookodile. Fire-types like Chandelure, Volcanion, and Infernape can weaken opposing teams while, more importantly, luring in bulky Water-types for Toxicroak to KO quite easily. Other powerful wallbreakers, such as Terrakion, Primarina, and Hydreigon, can punch holes in opposing teams and make it easier for Toxicroak to do its job late-game. Toxicroak appreciates Flying-type checks like Rotom-H and Mega Manectric on its team due to its vulnerability to popular threats in Moltres and Crobat. Pokemon that appreciate checks to bulky Water-types on their teams, such as the aforementioned Fire-types and Cobalion, partner well with Toxicroak thanks to its Dry Skin ability.</p>"

Between its ability Solid Rock and ridiculous physical bulk, Rhyperior provides teams with a fantastic tank. One of Rhyperior's primary advantages over other Stealth Rock users is its huge base 140 Attack stat and fantastic coverage between its STAB moves, giving it nice offensive presence to complement its defensive prowess. However, its monstrous physical bulk is offset by its horrible base Special Defense, which requires most of Rhyperior's EV investment in order to shore up. Ground / Rock is also a poor defensive typing, leaving Rhyperior with numerous weaknesses and often forcing it to rely on Solid Rock to stomach the many common super effective hits such as Alomomola's Scald. Rhyperior is vulnerable to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, as they wear it down over time and hinder its longevity. Lastly, Rhyperior faces huge competition from other Ground-type Stealth Rock users like Gligar and Hippowdon, only possessing greater offensive presence and the ability to check opposing Flying-types over those two.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is essential on every competitive team, racking up chip damage on foes throughout a match. Earthquake provides Rhyperior with a powerful Ground-type STAB move. Stone Edge possesses solid coverage in combination with Earthquake, hitting Ground-immune Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Moltres, and Togekiss incredibly hard. Alternatively, Rock Blast allows Rhyperior to better handle suicide leads like Froslass as well as preventing Substitute users from safely punishing it. Ice Punch provides Rhyperior with a way to keep up Stealth Rock against a popular entry hazard remover in Gligar, while also providing a sure-fire way to punish threats such as Celebi and Latias. Toxic lets Rhyperior cripple bulky foes such as Slowbro, Alomomola, and Hippowdon that otherwise do not mind its presence. Swords Dance can give Rhyperior the wallbreaking capabilities to deal with Pokemon like Gligar, Scizor, and Amoonguss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Rhyperior's overall bulk. Naturally, Leftovers is the preferred item, as its passive recovery helps keep Rhyperior healthy throughout a match. 16 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature improve Rhyperior's offensive presence while still allowing it to invest most of its EVs into bulk. The remaining EVs are poured into Special Defense, letting Rhyperior check Pokemon like Mega Manectric, Togekiss, and Rotom-H more effectively. Solid Rock is Rhyperior's best ability, shoring up its lackluster defensive typing by reducing the damage from super effective hits.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Rhyperior into on Pokemon it is meant to check such as Mega Manectric and Moltres. Once on the field in a safe position, use Rhyperior to set up Stealth Rock or spread Toxic poison on the opposing team. If running Swords Dance, prioritize setting up Stealth Rock before attempting to wallbreak and beat Pokemon like Gligar one-on-one. With Rock Blast Rhyperior can have a strong matchup against offensive teams and should potenitally look to lead against suicude leads like Froslass to limit it to one turn of Spikes. Rock Blast also allows Rhyperior to beat common Substitute user like Gengar and Chandelure, while also preventing Mimikyu from safely using Rhyperior as a set up opportunity behind Disguise. While Rhyperior can stomach many super effective hits due to Solid Rock, gauge how important its health will be for the remainder of the game and play accordingly. Scout for possible 4x effective coverage moves such as Mega Aerodactyl's Aqua Tail and Nihilego's Grass Knot. Rhyperior is worn down over time by Spikes and Toxic Spikes; clear them with a teammate if given the opportunity.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon-types like Hydreigon, Latias, and Mega Altaria are fantastic partners, as they help cover Rhyperior's weaknesses to Water- and Grass-type moves. Celebi, Amoonguss, and Tsareena can threaten Rhyperior's most prominent answers in Water-types, while Rhyperior can check the Flying-types that threaten them. Scizor and Cobalion appreciate the presence of Rhyperior, as they are Steel-types incapable of handling opposing Flying-types. Sylveon makes for a great partner, as it can cure Rhyperior of any status with Heal Bell and help to keep it healthy through Wish. Entry hazard removers such as Empoleon, Tentacruel, and Starmie can remove Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which wear Rhyperior down over time. Rhyperior can absorb the Electric-type moves that threaten them in return.</p>"

  "Togekiss": {
    "overview": "<p>Togekiss finds itself a comfortable place among UU's top threats, as it has solidified its role as one of the premier stallbreakers in the tier. Togekiss's Fairy / Flying typing comes with useful tools such as an immunity to Ground, a resistance to Pursuit, and the ability to stop many common threats such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Hippowdon. Despite being primarily known for its ability to easily power through many defensive cores, Togekiss can bring a wide array of supportive options such as Heal Bell, Defog, and Thunder Wave to a team. Togekiss's ability Serene Grace boosts its Air Slash flinch rate to a whopping 60 percent, meaning just about any Pokemon slower than it is at risk of being broken through, leaving very little true defensive counterplay to Togekiss. In addition to Air Slash, Togekiss possesses powerful coverage moves such as Fire Blast, Aura Sphere, and Dazzling Gleam. Backed by its high base 120 Special Attack, it can bypass many of its conventional checks with the appropriate move. While Togekiss may seem extremely powerful, it has many weaknesses to common Pokemon that hold it back greatly; it is vulnerable to many threats in the tier such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, Mega Manectric, Scizor, Nidoking, and Cobalion. In addition, Togekiss only boasts a middling base 80 Speed, meaning many of UU's best sweepers and cleaners can easily outpace it. Togekiss also finds it difficult to make itself a quickly threatening offensive presence due to its lack of immediate power or high-powered STAB moves. Combined with a troublesome weakness to common sights such as Stealth Rock, Volt Switch, and Scizor's Bullet Punch, Togekiss is far from impossible to take down.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Togekiss can utilize Dazzling Gleam to punish threats such as Hydreigon and Krookodile more quickly than Air Slash would. Togekiss can make use of a Choice Specs set decently due to its numerous coverage options and high Special Attack, but the lack of recovery generally leaves it more susceptibile to threats, especially if Stealth Rock is up. A specially defensive of 252 HP / 160 SpD / 96 Spe with a Calm nature can be used to better handle threats such as Latias and Celebi; however, Togekiss is not the most reliable response to them, as it can lose to Calm Mind variants of Latias for instance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Mega Manectric, Rotom-H, and Zeraora are immune to Thunder Wave, resist Air Slash, and can threaten Togekiss with their STAB attacks. Magneton also 4x resists Air Slash, but it must be wary of a potential Flamethrower or Aura Sphere.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-type threats are extremely threatening to Togekiss, as Mega Aerodactyl and Nihilego can switch fairly safely into all of its moves bar Thunder Wave. Terrakion is a softer check than Nihilego and Mega Aerodactyl due to its neutrality to Flying-type moves and weakness to Fairy-type moves, but it can still easily scare Togekiss away. Most Rock-types need to watch out for Charti Berry variants of Togekiss, though.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Nidoking, Mega Beedrill, and Tentacruel can all potentially outspeed Togekiss and threaten to hit it with super effective Poison-type STAB attacks, while Crobat can also shut down Togekiss's attempt to set up or spread paralysis using Taunt. Assault Vest Alolan Muk can OHKO Togekiss with Gunk Shot, since it's very unlikely that it will go down through flinches completely with its extremely high special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Scizor and Doublade can switch into Togekiss that lack Fire-type moves, and the former can attack with a super effective Bullet Punch before Togekiss has a chance to make them flinch with Air Slash. Specially defensive Empoleon, Mega Aggron, and Mega Steelix take little damage from even boosted Air Slash and can phaze Togekiss with Roar or KO it with Heavy Slam in Steelix and Aggron's case. Cobalion is not as sturdy a switch-in as other Steel-types but can outspeed Togekiss by a fair margin and threaten it with Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types such as Kyurem and Mamoswine threaten to KO Togekiss with powerful super effective STAB moves. Kyurem must be wary of switching into a Thunder Wave, though, as this can give Togekiss a fair chance to beat it in a one-on-one scenario, while Mamoswine typically fears switching directly into most Togekiss sets.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: While Togekiss can typically freely use Heal Bell against more passive Pokemon like Blissey, threats such as Mega Aerodactyl and Scizor can potentially switch in freely. Sets without Heal Bell must be wary of status, as paralysis or poison leaves Togekiss heavily crippled with no way to cure itself.</p>",

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot is Togekiss's main tool for breaking down bulky Pokemon and teams, as instantly doubling its Special Attack gives it considerable offensive presence. Heal Bell is an effective tool as well, as it prevents Pokemon such as Blissey and Alomomola from wearing Togekiss down with status conditions. Air Slash is Togekiss's go-to STAB move, as Serene Grace boosts the flinch rate to 60 percent. Roost is a necessity for any Togekiss seeking to break stall teams in order to recover any HP that is lost while boosting with Nasty Plot. Roost also allows Togekiss to check threats such as Krookodile and Hydreigon multiple times throughout the duration of a game. Thunder Wave is a secondary option that Togekiss can employ to bother many of its would-be checks such as Nihilego and Mega Aerodactyl. With the chance of full paralysis and the Serene Grace-boosted flinch chance of Air Slash, Togekiss often has a fair chance to beat these threats in a pinch.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Serene Grace is Togekiss's preferred ability, as it doubles the chance of moves' secondary effects occurring, giving its Air Slash a 60 percent flinch chance. Maximum investment in both HP and Speed gives Togekiss an acceptable amount of bulk while letting it outpace any Pokemon under base 80 Speed. Leftovers allows Togekiss to gain small portions of its health back when not using Roost. If necessary, Togekiss can use a more defensive spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe with a Bold nature to better counter threats like Krookodile while still outspeeding Modest Primarina and paralyzed Mega Aerodactyl. If utilizing Thunder Wave then a Charti Berry can be considered in order to stay in and take a Stone Edge from Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl and Terrakion to paralyze them.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While Togekiss sports a great typing and above average bulk, it should often avoid switching directly into heavy hitters like Heracross and Calm Mind Latias, as Togekiss gets most of its setup opportunities from passive Pokemon like Blissey, Alomomola, and Gligar. In addition to breaking defensive cores, Togekiss's Heal Bell is often extremely useful support for many teams. Heal Bell is also extremely useful for letting Togekiss break past these defensive foes safely, as it can heal its Toxic poison, which would otherwise prevent it from reliably breaking past them after a Nasty Plot. Togekiss should also aim to have checks like Nihilego and Mega Manectric worn down or removed before it comes in to sweep. The option of Thunder Wave is often more threatening to offensive builds, as Togekiss can threaten to muscle past offensive checks like Cobalion and Mega Aerodactyl with the combination of Thunder Wave paralysis and Air Slash flinches. If Charti Berry is used, stay in on Rock-types such as Mega Aerodactyl and Terrakion in order to cripple them with Thunder Wave. For this reason, it is advised to keep Togekiss as healthy as possible to be able to take a Stone Edge from both of them, especially in the case of Terrakion, which can OHKO you after a Swords Dance or with a Continental Crush after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>As Nasty Plot variants of Togekiss do not have room to carry Defog, Togekiss will always appreciate a partner that can remove Stealth Rock to assist in its longevity such as Starmie, Tentacruel, and Empoleon. Toxic Spikes users such as Nihilego, Nidoqueen, and Tentacruel can also assist Togekiss by pressuring Electric-types such as Zeraora and Mega Manectric, Nidoqueen in particular being able to pivot into them and block their Electric STAB coverage. Bulky Ground- and Dragon-types such as Hippowdon, Krookodile, and Latias similarly can prove to be useful partners for Togekiss, as Electric-types such as Rotom-H and Mega Manectric are typically the most consistently threatening Pokemon to Togekiss. In return, Togekiss can check threatening Dragon-types like Mega Sceptile and Hydreigon for them. Steel-types such as Bronzong, Scizor, and Empoleon also make good partners for Togekiss, as they can pivot in to take Poison-, Ice-, and Rock-type moves aimed at it. Pokemon that can check various Steel-types, such as Infernape and Volcanion, also are imperative for effective use of Togekiss. Magneton can be especially useful, as it can trap and eliminate the likes of Empoleon and Scizor. Togekiss often works as a catch-all check to various strong Dark-type attackers, so teammates like Latias and Mew will appreciate Togekiss being able to pivot into these. Finally, other special attackers can often cleave through defensive cores once Togekiss has broken them down, so Togekiss often makes an effective teammate for Pokemon like Nidoking, Suicune, and Latias.</p>"

      "Offensive Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Air Slash is Togekiss's most reliable STAB move, super effectively hitting targets such as Tsareena, Amoonguss, and Infernape as well as neutral foes. Additionally, thanks to Serene Grace, it has a 60% chance to cause the foe to flinch, which aids Togekiss in beating bulky support Pokemon, such as Alomomola, Swampert, and Mantine, that rely on status ailments and recovery to beat Togekiss. Aura Sphere hits Steel-types such as Empoleon and Stakataka super effectively, which Flamethrower doesn't, and should be used in conjunction with Fightinium Z. A boosted All-Out Pummeling allows Togekiss to OHKO Mega Aggron, Rhyperior, and Empoleon. Nasty Plot boosts Togekiss's Special Attack, turning it into a dangerous setup sweeper. Flamethrower allows Togekiss to hit Steel-types such as Scizor and Doublade, which otherwise beat it, for super effective damage. Hence, it should be used in conjunction with a Babiri Berry to do the job effectively. Roost aids Togekiss in maintaining its HP and acquiring setup opportunities.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs maximize Togekiss's damage output. 252 Speed EVs, in conjunction with a Timid nature, allow Togekiss to outspeed base 70s such as Volcanion and threaten them with Air Slash. It also allows Togekiss to Speed tie with other base 80s such as Mega Altaria and Chandelure. Fightinium Z, in conjunction with Aura Sphere, grants Togekiss access to All-Out Pummeling, which KOes Flying-resistant Pokemon that otherwise beat it, such as Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Empoleon, after a boost. Serene Grace boosts Air Slash's flinch chance, which aids Togekiss in beating bulky Toxic users, such as Alomomola and Mantine, that otherwise cripple it. Babiri Berry allows Togekiss to take on Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Scizor more easily. A bulkier spread with more HP investment can be used alongside Fightinium Z to allow Togekiss to better check Pokemon like Krookodile and Hydreigon at the cost of being more reliant on Nasty Plot to break past sturdier walls.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid setting up against passive Pokemon such as Blissey and Alomomola that may carry Toxic, as this set does not utilize Heal Bell and is therefore very susceptible to status ailments. However, if boosted, Togekiss can attempt to beat them down with the combination of Air Slash and Serene Grace. Take advantage of Togekiss's bulk and typing to check Dark-types, such as Hydreigon and Krookodile, and Grass-types, such as Mega Sceptile and Tsareena, and set up on a predicted switch. However, because this Togekiss set does not invest in bulk or have passive recovery, it should avoid switching directly into them if Stealth Rock was set on your side. If it is not up, Togekiss generally doesn't mind switching into them. All-Out Pummeling can be used as a general nuke that allows Togekiss to beat slower and bulkier Pokemon such as Blissey more easily. All-Out Pummeling also allows Togekiss to bypass bulky Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Empoleon, and Rhyperior. However, against those, use All-Out Pummeling only if boosted because Togekiss will fail to OHKO them otherwise. All-Out Pummeling could also be used to severely damage faster Flying-resistant Pokemon that Togekiss lures in such as Rotom-H and Mega Aerodactyl on the switch. If Babiri Berry is used, stay in on unsuspecting Steel-types such as Scizor and Mega Aggron to either KO or severely weaken them. It is advised to make sure Togekiss stays at a comfortable amount of HP because even with a Berry, Togekiss does not appreciate taking a Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch and Doublade's Gyro Ball. However, Togekiss cannot reliably survive attacks from these Pokemon after a Swords Dance from full health. Avoid setting up with Togekiss if the opponent has a healthy check to it, such as Mega Manectric or Nihilego. Instead, take advantage of entry hazards and chip them on the switch with a damaging move.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stealth Rock setters such as Cobalion, Krookodile, and Mega Aggron pair well with Togekiss because not only do they help Togekiss wearing down its checks, but they also take on certain checks to Togekiss. Krookodile is able to check Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Rotom-H and can provide support with Taunt to prevent Stealth Rock and status being used, giving Togekiss a much easier time to set up and wallbreak. Mega Aggron and Cobalion are also able to take on checks to Togekiss like Mega Aerodactyl and Nihilego, which Togekiss struggles to deal with. The latter also being able to wear down bulky Steel-types for Togekiss and appreciating it being able to wear down bulky Water-types and Doublade in exchange. Similarly, because the majority of Togekiss's checks are grounded, Spikes setters such as Klefki and Toxic Spikes setters such as Nidoqueen and Nihilego can help wear down foes such as Mega Manectric and Zeraora that check Togekiss. Entry hazard removers such as Tentacruel, Gligar, and Starmie can remove Stealth Rock so Togekiss can continually switch in. The former can also set up Toxic Spikes to support Togekiss. Generally, Steel-types such as Bronzong and Scizor are good partners for Togekiss because they check Ice-types such as Kyurem and Mamoswine. The former can also set up Stealth Rock to support Togekiss. Dragon-types such as Latias and Mega Altaria appreciate Togekiss's ability to lure in and remove Steel-types so they can spam their strong STAB moves. They can also check Electric-types such as Rotom-C, Rotom-H, and Mega Manectric. Rock-types such as Terrakion and Nihilego also benefit from Togekiss's ability to remove Steel-types. Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Infernape check Steel-types such as Scizor and Mega Aggron, and they also appreciate Togekiss severely weakening bulky Water-types that attempt inflict it with a status ailment and potentially crippling fast Rock-types such as Nihilego and Mega Aerodactyl with the combination of Charti Berry and Thunder Wave.</p>"

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Air Slash is Togekiss's best STAB option, as it is a decently powerful move that comes with a 60 percent flinch chance. Roost is necessary for Togekiss, as it needs a form of recovery to sustain itself throughout a match. Heal Bell is a useful option to support Togekiss's team, as partners like Cobalion and Swampert appreciate status conditions being healed. Thunder Wave can also be utilized to cripple many offensive threats like Nihilego, Cobalion, and Mega Aerodactyl. Togekiss can also remove hazards via Defog, as its unique typing gives it a good matchup against common Stealth Rock setters like Seismitoad and Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Serene Grace should always be used on Togekiss, as it gives Togekiss a 60 percent chance to cause foes to flinch with Air Slash. Leftovers allows Togekiss to recover its HP without using Roost. 96 Speed EVs allow Togekiss to outspeed Modest Primarina and paralyzed Mega Aerodactyl. The remaining EVs are dumped into Defense to maximize Togekiss's physical bulk. A Charti Berry can be used to more reliably Thunder Wave threats like Mega Aerodactyl and Terrakion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Togekiss as a reliable switch-in to Hydreigon and Krookodile. Be wary of switching Togekiss in repeatedly with Stealth Rock up, though, as it often hampers Togekiss's defensive capability; so it should attempt to remove Stealth Rock as often and as soon as possible. Togekiss also makes good use of Heal Bell, which can allow it to cure teammates when they are inflicted with troublesome status conditions. This Togekiss set is rather passive, so be sure to use double switches and proper prediction to prevent Flying-resistant foes such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Manectric from getting free turns. However, the former does have to fear Thunder Wave, which should be used on predicted doubles like this to assist its teammates and potentially flinch down a weakened Mega Aerodactyl itself with Air Slash. If using a Charti Berry then Togekiss can stay in and take a Stone Edge from Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Band Terrakion in order to paralyze them, however, it must be as healthy as possible even after doing this to reliably check other Pokemon like Hydreigon and Krookodile.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon- and Ground-types like Hydreigon, Latias, and Seismitoad all make good teammate options, as they are typically the most reliable checks to Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Rotom-H, which can take advantage of Togekiss with little effort. Bulky Water- and Ground-type Pokemon capable of taking on Mega Aerodactyl such as Suicune and Mega Steelix are also helpful. Their longevity is also bolstered by Togekiss healing their status conditions. Various Steel-types such as Doublade and Scizor can also reliably check offensive Poison-types like Nihilego and Mega Beedrill that threaten Togekiss. Togekiss also requires the support of teammates that are capable of beating troublesome Steel-type Pokemon. Magneton, Infernape, Chandelure, and Cobalion are all capable of performing this task for Togekiss. Many offensive sweepers and wallbreakers like Scizor, Latias, and Cobalion appreciate Togekiss providing support via Heal Bell to ward off crippling status conditions. Lastly, Stealth Rock-weak teammates like Mega Beedrill, Volcanion, and Aerodactyl appreciate Togekiss's ability to remove entry hazards via Defog.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Air Slash is Togekiss's main attacking move. Thanks to Serene Grace, Air Slash has a 60% chance to land a flinch, leaving few drawbacks to spamming it against slower targets. Thunder Wave is brilliant for shutting down faster targets such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Hydreigon, as it allows Togekiss to be able to make them flinch. When Thunder Wave is used in conjunction with Air Slash, it further increases the odds of the opposing Pokemon being completely immobilized. Trick allows Togekiss to be free of its Choice Scarf and cripple walls such as Blissey and Pyukumuku that don't appreciate being Choice-locked, and it also improves the team's matchup against stall. Roost may seem odd on a Pokemon with a Choice item, but it provides Togekiss with more longevity, and if Togekiss gets rid of its Choice Scarf with Trick, Roost becomes a fantastic utility move. Nasty Plot is another nice move for when Togekiss gets rid of its Choice Scarf, allowing it to become a powerful wallbreaker. However, since it forces Togekiss to Trick its Choice Scarf before it can use it, it can be dead move in certain matchups. Heal Bell allows Togekiss to act as a cleric, removing any status effects and providing the team with more longevity. Defog is a useful utility option for Togekiss, as it's able to utilize its high Speed tier to remove entry hazards quickly in emergency situations. Dazzling Gleam is a nice STAB option, allowing Togekiss to hit targets such as Mega Manectric, Latias, and Terrakion, but Air Slash is generally a better option thanks to its flinch chance, and Togekiss doesn't appreciate the lack of utility options. Flamethrower can be used to make Togekiss a nice lure for Scizor and other Steel-types that typically like to switch in on it.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Togekiss to outspeed the majority of unboosted Pokemon in UU, most notably Latias, Terrakion, and Cobalion. It is worth noting, however, that even with a Choice Scarf, Togekiss is outpaced by Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl. A bulkier spread of maximum HP and Speed EVs can be run to allow Togekiss to take advantage of its nice defensive typing and more effectively switch into threats like Hydreigon, but this hampers its ability to provide much of an offensive presence and hurts its ability to revenge kill foes effectively due to the lower damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Togekiss's primary role is to revenge kill faster foes such as Latias and Infernape with Air Slash while utilizing its defensive typing to switch into Pokemon it checks such as Hydreigon and Hippowdon. When faster Pokemon that commonly switch into Togekiss such as Mega Aerodactyl and Nihilego are still active, it's recommended to use Thunder Wave on predicted switches to them, as this allows Togekiss to outspeed them and makes them easier for Togekiss's teammates to check. Roost should be used against Pokemon that can't dish out too much damage to Togekiss like Hydreigon or on predicted switches when its HP is running low. Since Togekiss is Choice-locked into a move, it should be careful using its utility options. While using utility moves such as Roost and Defog against Pokemon that Togekiss can comfortably defensively check such as Hydreigon is rather safe, a misprediction against something like Nasty Plot Celebi can end up meaning that Togekiss becomes setup fodder. Using Trick can reduce the prediction game, as removing Togekiss's Choice Scarf means that it's no longer locked into a single move, but it should only really be used when Togekiss isn't required to have a Choice Scarf to maintain its high Speed. Bulkier archetypes such as stall tend to be perfect matchups for Togekiss to Trick its Choice Scarf away against, as using Trick on Blissey or Pyukumuku can render them virtually useless. Nasty Plot sets especially appreciate having the Choice Scarf Tricked against slower archetypes, as it can then act as a potent wallbreaker. Trick should be used with caution, though, as Z-Crystal holders and Mega Evolutions block Trick, which can end up resulting in Togekiss being locked into a useless move. In some cases, it may be better to avoid revealing a Choice Scarf set to simplify the process of Tricking it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Togekiss tends to fit well on offensive and balance archetypes, as they appreciate the variety of roles that it can pull off. Offensive partners especially appreciate Togekiss's ability to cripple faster threats with Thunder Wave, making them less susceptible to being revenge killed and not forced to use priority attacks to take those threats out. Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Scizor make for great partners for Togekiss, as they're able to deal with faster threats that outspeed Togekiss such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Beedrill, and they're all able to KO them with their powerful Steel-type attacks. Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix are both able to comfortably take any attack from these Pokemon, while Scizor is able to take these Pokemon out easily with a priority Bullet Punch. Answers to these aforementioned Steel-types are mandatory, as they're able to threaten Togekiss with their powerful Steel-type attacks and tend to take minimal damage from Air Slash. Infernape fits this role well, as it's able to threaten them with its powerful Fire- and Fighting-type attacks, can revenge kill faster weakened foes with a priority Vacuum Wave, and appreciates Pyukumuku being useless due to gaining Choice Scarf from Trick. Other Fire-types such as Rotom-H and Volcanion can be useful, as Rotom-H is also a good answer to Electric-types that Togekiss dislikes, and both of these Pokemon can offer a secondary option for hazard removal for Togekiss if necessary. Switch-ins to Knock Off such as Terrakion, Cobalion, and Hydreigon are crucial, as Togekiss relies heavily on its Choice Scarf to perform a lot of its roles. Hydreigon is especially noteworthy, as it is able to run non-Choice Scarf sets, lure in Steel-types and strike them with Fire Blast or Superpower, remove entry hazards with Defog, and pressure bulky Water-types such as Calm Mind Suicune and Slowbro and clerics thanks to Taunt. In return, it appreciates Togekiss shutting down checks such as Sylveon and Blissey with Trick. Bulky Ground-types such as Swampert and Nidoqueen are also great partners due to their ability to switch into Electric-type attacks and provide Stealth Rock support. Hazard removal from Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Tentacruel, and Rotom-H is incredibly useful to improve Togekiss's longevity, as it does not appreciate taking Stealth Rock damage, even if it is running Roost. Tentacruel is especially noteworthy, as it provides the team with a secondary Fighting-type check, which Togekiss appreciates because it tends not to appreciate switching into Cobalion's and Infernape's non-Fighting-type coverage moves.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine is a premier wallbreaker in UnderUsed thanks to its huge Attack stat and an excellent STAB combination, which offers nearly perfect coverage. It also has access to STAB Ice Shard, which can patch up its paltry Speed while picking off several top threats, such as Latias, Mega Altaria, and Mega Aerodactyl, when weakened. Moreover, Mamoswine can support its team with options such as Knock Off and Stealth Rock, increasing its overall utility. Unfortunately, despite hitting extremely hard, Mamoswine has a hard time actually coming into play due to its terrible defensive typing, which lacks useful resistances and gives it several common weaknesses, such as to Fighting and Water. Its poor defensive utility is further compounded by its unremarkable bulk and weakness to common priority moves like Bullet Punch and Aqua Jet, which compromises its ability to pressure slower threats in Scizor and Crawdaunt. Lastly, Mamoswine struggles with a below average Speed tier for an offensive Pokemon, which can leave it vulnerable to several of the tier's powerful faster threats, including Infernape, Cobalion, and Starmie.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Freeze-Dry is also an option in the fourth slot, luring in and 2HKOing bulky Water-types like Swampert and Alomomola. However, with adequate chip damage, both of these Pokemon can already be 2HKOed by Earthquake, while the need to run a Naughty or Naive nature further compromises Mamoswine's defensive capabilities. Mamoswine can viably function as a suicide lead, running a set with Stealth Rock, Focus Sash, Oblivious to evade Taunt, and Ice Shard + Endeavor for picking off at least one foe before fainting. However, it faces competition from other suicide leads like Azelf and Terrakion and isn't nearly as useful a set as Life Orb. Toxic can be used in the fourth slot to cripple Mamoswine's defensive switch-ins but usually doesn't provide as useful of overall utility as Stealth Rock or Knock Off. Finally, Protect is an option for scouting Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch or attacks from other Choice-locked Pokemon like Infernape and Volcanion, though it also often struggles to provide better utility than either Knock Off or Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Defensive Water-types</strong>: Defensive Water-types like Alomomola, Slowbro and its Mega Evolution, and bulkier Suicune variants can often avoid the 2HKO from Earthquake while threatening Mamoswine with a super effective STAB Scald.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Though they can't switch in, the likes of Infernape, Cobalion, and Terrakion are all faster than Mamoswine and can tank an Ice Shard, which allows them to KO Mamoswine with super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Due to Mamoswine's low Speed and terrible defensive typing, faster Pokemon capable of hitting it hard can pose a large threat. Examples include Terrakion, Starmie, and Kyurem, though all should be wary of switching into Mamoswine directly. Rotom-H is particularly troublesome, as it is only hit hard by Knock Off and Stone Edge due to its typing and ability, and it can pick Mamoswine off with STAB Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Priority</strong>: Mamoswine's typing leaves it weak to several forms of super effective priority that are run in UU, including Scizor's Bullet Punch, Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet, and Lucario's Vacuum Wave. However, only offensive variants of the former can KO Mamoswine from full HP, meaning that both Infernape and Crawdaunt will require some chip damage to pick it off with priority moves.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Mamoswine's middling bulk, poor defensive typing, and Life Orb recoil leave it open to being easily chipped down by forms of residual damage, which include entry hazards, U-turn pivoting from foes, and status ailments like poison.</p>",

Earthquake is Mamoswine's most powerful STAB attack, 2HKOing the majority of switch-ins while forcing out defensive threats like Klefki and Mega Aggron. Icicle Crash applies pressure to several defensive Pokemon that could tank an Earthquake and damage Mamoswine in return, including Amoonguss and Hippowdon. It also hits Levitate users and Flying-types like Hydreigon, Latias, and bulkier variants of Togekiss, which would traditionally be used as Ground-type checks. Knock Off 2HKOes Rotom-H in addition to burdening foes with the removal of their items. Stealth Rock is an entry hazard that can be set as Mamoswine forces switches; however, it should only be run on Mamoswine if no other member of its team has room for the move as it greatly appreciates running a better coverage option instead. Stone Edge is an option that can OHKO Rotom-H and Moltres, which can both otherwise come in once and pressure Mamoswine with either powerful attacks or status. It often comes at the cost of utility or better coverage, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Attack with an Adamant nature maximizes Mamoswine's power, allowing it to more easily secure OHKOs on foes such as Primarina and Amoonguss and 2HKOs on the likes of Mega Aggron and Slowbro. Full investment in Speed makes it as fast as possible with a neutral nature, outrunning the majority of the metagame's defensive threats. A Jolly nature is also an option, allowing Mamoswine to outrun Timid Volcanion and Speed tie with Togekiss, Mega Altaria, and Chandelure at the cost of some power. Life Orb increases Mamoswine's overall damage output, notably allowing it to secure the 2HKO on Suicune with Earthquake. Thick Fat is the preferred ability, decreasing the damage Mamoswine takes from Fire- and Ice-type attacks that Electric-types like Mega Manectric often use to power through other Ground-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mamoswine's best use is on offensive teams as an early-game wallbreaker that can pave way for teammates to clean up later on. Ice Shard should be utilized to threaten to revenge kill the tier's several faster Pokemon that are weak to it, such as Latias, Togekiss, and Mega Aerodactyl. If the opposing team is weakened enough, Mamoswine can also try using it to clean up late-game. The decision of whether to use Icicle Crash or Earthquake to wallbreak can be tough at times, though against teams with Ground-immune Pokemon, which are often weak to Ice, Icicle Crash is often smarter to use early on. Earthquake is best to use once Ground-resistant and -immune foes are removed or weakened due to its better neutral coverage. Mamoswine forces several switches as it wallbreaks and as such should take advantage of said switches to fire off powerful STAB attacks, hit various switch-ins that tank its STAB attacks, like Rotom-H, with Knock Off, or set Stealth Rock if utilizing the move. Because its typing doesn't provide it with many switch-in opportunities, it's best to bring Mamoswine in via pivot support or after a teammate has fainted. However, it can come into play in a few specific scenarios, such as against passive defensive Pokemon like Klefki, Hippowdon, and Blissey and against Electric-types like Mega Manectric if it predicts carefully. Lastly, Mamoswine should capitalize on its strong matchup against defensive teams by using Knock Off to chip foes early-game, then weakening them further later on.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its huge offensive presence and struggle to defensively contribute to teams, Mamoswine is most comfortably fitted on offensively inclined builds. It is appreciated by setup sweepers, like Terrakion, Mega Altaria, and Doublade, thanks to its ability to weaken opposing teams for them to more easily do their job late-game. Cleaners such as Mega Sharpedo and Scizor also appreciate Mamoswine's support for this reason. Pokemon capable of providing pivot support, like Scizor, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-H, are capable of safely bringing Mamoswine into play. Mamoswine also appreciates teammates capable of supporting it with entry hazards, such as Cobalion and Nihilego, as chip damage allows it to more easily muscle past the likes of Alomomola and Mega Slowbro on its own. Stealth Rock support can also allow Mamoswine to more comfortably run Knock Off, its preferred coverage option. Klefki and Froslass are particularly helpful partners, as they can provide Spikes support for Mamoswine to take advantage of in addition Klefki being able to patch up its poor Speed with Thunder Wave. Adequate methods of checking faster foes, such as Choice Scarf Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl, can help patch up Mamoswine's susceptibility to being revenge killed due to its poor Speed. Fighting-type checks like Latias, Mimikyu, and Primarina can come in on the several Fighting-types that force Mamoswine out, such as Infernape, Cobalion, and Terrakion. Lastly, due to Mamoswine's susceptibility to being worn down, it enjoys the support of Pokemon capable of removing entry hazards, such as Mega Blastoise, Starmie, and Hydreigon.</p>"

  "Froslass": {
    "overview": "<p>Froslass holds a notable niche as a lead on hyper offense teams thanks to its useful utility options such as Icy Wind and Destiny Bond in tandem with its blistering base 110 Speed. Froslass also possesses Taunt and the ability to spinblock, allowing it to stop entry hazard removers such as Empoleon and Tentacruel, as well as prevent the opposing team from setting up their own entry hazards, giving Froslass an edge in many situations. Unfortunately, Froslass is quite frail, meaning that numerous powerful attackers like Scizor, Zeraora, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon are able to outpace and KO it if its Focus Sash is broken. Furthermore, Froslass is quite weak outside of hitting certain targets super effectively, meaning it isn't very threatening offensively. Froslass faces competition from Klefki and Chesnaught as a user of Spikes, as their better defensive traits grant them more opportunities to set up entry hazards throughout a match, and Klefki also has priority Spikes, which ensures that it will almost always set a layer before going down. Thus, Froslass's defensive limitations relegate its use strictly to hyper offense teams. As a suicide lead, Froslass also has to compete with Azelf, which possesses higher Speed and greater offensive stats, allowing it to wear down the opposing team much more effectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Ball inflicts super effective damage against Ghost-types and Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Doublade and Starmie, but it otherwise limits Froslass's utility options. Froslass can opt for a bulkier spread to better take on Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel and Starmie, but this further limits Froslass's already poor power, and Froslass is still frail overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Taunt users</strong>: Froslass is shut down by faster Taunt users such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Houndoom, and Azelf, though the former does not appreciate Froslass potentially going for Icy Wind.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Bisharp, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and Mega Sharpedo are all incredibly threatening to Froslass, as they can outspeed and KO it if its Focus Sash is not intact. The former can even acquire Attack boosts from Icy Wind's Speed drop thanks to Defiant. While quite rare, Mega Absol possesses the coveted Magic Bounce, meaning it is able to pivot into Froslass after Mega Evolving and bounce back Spikes and Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers and Priority</strong>: Once its Focus Sash is broken, Froslass can easily be outsped and KOed by fast Pokemon such as Mega Manectric as well as various Choice Scarf users such as Latias, Infernape, and Terrakion. Scizor and Doublade both possess super effective priority moves, though they risk a potential Will-O-Wisp if they directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removal</strong>: Though Froslass can threaten most users of Defog and Rapid Spin while on the field, they can easily perform their role once Froslass is KOed or crippled. Certain users of Defog such as Moltres, Hydreigon, and Rotom-H also naturally threaten Froslass with their STAB moves.</p>",

      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt stops status moves such as Defog and prevents Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Mega Aggron from setting up entry hazards. Icy Wind is used to slow down faster targets such as Zeraora and Choice Scarf Krookodile, giving Froslass an opportunity to use Destiny Bond or set up another layer of Spikes. Destiny Bond functions as a last-ditch effort by giving Froslass the ability to potentially take a Pokemon down with it; it pairs especially well with Icy Wind, as it allows Froslass to potentially remove the aforementioned faster threats from a game. Ice Beam is a stronger alternative to Icy Wind, most notably 2HKOing Hydreigon and Latias and OHKOing Gligar. Note that Icy Wind is generally preferred for letting Froslass slow down faster Pokemon and subsequently eliminate them with Destiny Bond, however. Will-O-Wisp can be used over Destiny Bond to give Froslass a tool to cripple Pokemon like Scizor and Terrakion, though this misses out on Destiny Bond's potential to remove a foe entirely.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Focus Sash allows Froslass to circumvent its poor defenses by letting it survive a single attack, and it allows Froslass to set up at least one layer of Spikes. Cursed Body provides use in potentially shutting down a foe's attacking move, possibly forcing a Choice-locked foe to Struggle and giving Froslass another chance to set up Spikes.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Lead off with Froslass whenever possible to ensure that Spikes enter the field quickly while using Taunt first against opposing entry hazard setters such as Mega Aggron and Swampert to prevent them from doing their job. However, if the opposing team has a faster Taunt user such as Azelf or Crobat, it's often a good idea to not lead Froslass as to avoid losing momentum. Once said Pokemon is off the field or eliminated, Froslass can come in and start setting up Spikes. Froslass should prioritize setting Spikes and keeping them on the field with Taunt and its natural ability to spinblock. Due to Froslass's mediocre Special Attack stat and the opportunity cost of not being able to set another layer of Spikes, Icy Wind should only be used when it's imperative that a faster threat such as Mega Aerodactyl, Zeraora, or Choice Scarf Hydreigon is able to be picked off. Froslass can then use Destiny Bond to possibly net a KO if it's about to go down; this is also an effective way for Froslass to preserve momentum for its team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Froslass sees use on hyper offense teams due to its ability to quickly set up Spikes. Froslass's ability to wear down the opposing team with Spikes is appreciated by a wide array of wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Scizor, Infernape, and Latias, as they're able to capitalize on having walls weakened or use crippled Pokemon as setup fodder. Frailer offensive threats like Zeraora, Mega Sharpedo, and Lucario can more safely come into play thanks to Froslass's ability to potentially remove an opposing Pokemon and provide a free switch with Destiny Bond. Ways of deterring entry hazard removal increase the chances of Froslass keeping its Spikes on the field; Defiant users such as Bisharp and Tornadus discourage and punish the use of Defog, whereas Ghost-types such as Gengar and Doublade possess the ability to spinblock. Fast Taunt users such as Crobat and Cobalion are additionally able to block Defog. Froslass can form an entry hazard setting core with Stealth Rock setters such as Cobalion, Nidoking, and Nihilego. These examples are also able to take on Rock- and Fire-types that threaten Froslass such as Terrakion and Rotom-H.</p>"

  "Rotom-Heat": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-H's unique Fire / Electric typing provides key resistances to common offensive typings, such as Electric, Fire, Flying, Fairy, and Steel, allowing it to check Togekiss, Scizor, Mamoswine, and Mega Manectric all at once. When combined with its ability and access to Defog, this makes Rotom-H effective at role compression. With Defog, Rotom-H functions as an effective means of entry hazard removal and is able to threaten common hazard setters such as Klefki, Mega Aggron, and Hippowdon with Overheat and Toxic. Rotom-H's Speed tier allows it to outspeed important Pokemon in the tier like Mamoswine and Togekiss and just barely outspeed Nidoking, but it is slower than Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Moltres. Rotom-H also has a hard time removing hazards against setters such as Nihilego and Swampert, but Swampert does not like to be badly poisoned. It's often hard for Rotom-H to perform all of its roles effectively, as it is used to check many popular Pokemon in the metagame and has no reliable recovery, which causes it to be worn down easily. Rotom-H is also easily set up on by Dragon-types such as Haxorus and Latias, as they resist its STAB moves; they do have to be wary of status conditions on the switch, though.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-H can run a Choice Scarf set, but it often finds itself heavily outclassed by Mega Manectric and Infernape as a fast offensive pivot, especially due to Rotom-H's STAB combination being walled by Dragon-types. Trick is a good option for this set, as it allows Rotom-H to shut down walls such as Hippowdon and Blissey, locking them into moves and limiting their usefulness. The set is able to work if you are having heavy issues with the Pokemon Rotom-H checks and desperately need a Choice Scarf user, but only in very rare situations is the Choice Scarf set better than either of the aforementioned Pokemon. Thunder Wave is able to slow down often-problematic Pokemon such as Latias and Hydreigon,  to allow slower Pokemon such as Crawdaunt and Lucario to sweep more easily.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Rock-types and Stealth Rock</strong>: Rock-types such as Terrakion, Nihilego, Mega Aerodactyl, and Rhyperior give Rotom-H a hard time, as they can OHKO it with their super effective STAB moves. Rotom-H's weakness to Stealth Rock is often detrimental because of its lack of reliable recovery, limiting Rotom-H's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types such as Latias, Hydreigon, and Haxorus resist Rotom-H's STAB moves and are able to set up on Rotom-H, and Rotom-H must pivot out of them or risk being KOed. Many of them dislike Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Poison</strong>: Toxic poison completely cripples Rotom-H, as it cancels out its recovery and chips it considerably, leaving it forced to switch out to a cleric or limit its use even further.</p> <p><strong>Strong Offensive Threats</strong>: Pokemon such as Infernape, Terrakion, Mega Sharpedo, and Gengar can significantly wear down or outright KO Rotom-H, leaving it in a severely weakened state with only an unreliable Pain Split to recover HP.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Swampert, Seismitoad, and Gligar are able to give Rotom-H trouble. All of these Pokemon except Gligar have to be wary of Toxic, though.</p>",

      "Fast Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog lets Rotom-H take advantage of its ability to force out common entry hazard setters such as Mega Aggron, Chesnaught, and Klefki to remove hazards uninterrupted. Volt Switch allows Rotom-H to gain momentum and provide a safe switch for a teammate while dishing out respectable damage in the process. Toxic allows Rotom-H to cripple Pokemon that would normally give it trouble, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Latias. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple popular physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl, dropping their power and providing decent chip damage. Pain Split can be used to give Rotom-H a form of recovery, gaining back significant amounts of health when used against common switch-ins such as Blissey and Hydreigon, but Rotom-H has to give up either Defog or status to make room for it. Thunderbolt is another offensive option for Rotom-H, letting it heavily damage Flying-types such as Togekiss and Moltres without switching out, although carrying the move means giving up defensive utility.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rotom-H runs maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature to be able to outspeed Nidoking, Togekiss, and Mamoswine, allowing it to hit these threats hard or cripple them. 20 Special Attack EVs allow Rotom-H to OHKO Celebi with Overheat after Stealth Rock damage. 236 HP EVs improve Rotom-H's bulk so it can check threats more reliably and also let Rotom-H activate its Wiki Berry after switching into Stealth Rock three times. Wiki Berry gives Rotom-H a form of burst recovery when its HP is low, increasing its longevity greatly with proper play. Leftovers can be used instead for a more reliable but less significant form of passive recovery. However, when using Leftovers, Rotom-H should use a spread of 232 HP / 24 SpA / 252 Spe so that it can switch into Stealth Rock more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Rotom-H into common entry hazard setters such as Chesnaught and Mega Aggron frequently, but be wary of switching into moves like Leech Seed and Toxic. If you expect a switch, use Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, or Volt Switch. This allows Rotom-H to either inflict status conditions or send out a check to common switch-ins such as Nihilego and Latias without leaving either Rotom-H or your team vulnerable. Before deciding which move to use in these cases, consider the opponent's team and decide if you need to pivot or cripple a potential switch-in. Rotom-H's typing allows it to effectively check many of the top Pokemon of the tier, but it is easily worn down because of its abysmal HP stat, weakness to Stealth Rock, and lack of reliable options of recovery. Keep an eye on Rotom-H's HP, as it dropping down to 25% or below allows Wiki Berry to activate and restore its health back up to 75%. Be careful of using Volt Switch when Pokemon such as Swampert and Gligar are on the opposing team, as they can stop Rotom-H from gaining momentum. Be wary of the Special Attack drop caused by Overheat, as it usually allows wallbreakers to switch in inconsequentially, gives foes a free turn to set up, and lets Pokemon like Alolan Muk Pursuit trap Rotom-H without taking much damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-H is able to fit easily onto bulky offense or balance because of its role compression and defensive utility. It is easily able to fit into VoltTurn teams as well, being able to pair effectively with both Scizor and Hydreigon because of its defensive utility and access to Volt Switch. Scizor enjoys having Rotom-H as a partner, as it can check Moltres, which Scizor struggles with. In return, Scizor is able to check Pokemon Rotom-H struggles with, such as Nihilego, Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Altaria, and Terrakion. Rotom-H appreciates Pokemon like Nidoqueen and defensive Primarina that can take hits well from its checks such as Terrakion and Hydreigon, threaten them out, and absorb otherwise crippling status conditions. Rotom-H can pair well with Mega Altaria because of Rotom-H's utility as a Defogger and check to Scizor and Moltres. Mega Altaria can beat strong Dragon-types that would check Rotom-H, such as Hydreigon and Latias, to support Rotom-H in return. Rotom-H appreciates Wish and cleric support, as it has problems with recovery and status. Alomomola, Sylveon, and Florges are great Pokemon for the job. Rotom-H's job as a pivot allows it to safely bring in wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt, Mamoswine, and Choice Specs Primarina. Pursuit trappers such as Alolan Muk, Mega Aerodactyl, and Krookodile are able to take advantage of Rotom-H's ability to lure in Latias and physically frail Pokemon such as Nihilego and Blissey to trap them much more easily. While Rotom-H matches up well against Scizor, it is useful to include another check to it on your team, as Quick Attack and All-Out Pummeling variants of it can KO Rotom-H and leave your team open to being swept.</p>"

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Overheat is Rotom-H's strongest STAB move, and when combined with Firium Z, it has a solid chance to OHKO offensive Nidoqueen after Stealth Rock and Hippowdon and Gligar with Inferno Overdrive into Overheat on the switch. Volt Switch lets Rotom-H generate momentum against its switch-ins like Latias and Hydreigon. Toxic lets it cripple these checks instead so they struggle to deal with it in the long term. Pain Split allows Rotom-H to keep itself healthy throughout a match, healing off against its switch-ins like Latias, Swampert, Chansey, and Rhyperior.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Rotom-H to outspeed targets like Togekiss and Nidoking. If another teammate is using a Z-Crystal, Leftovers is an option to give Rotom-H some passive recovery to check Pokemon like Scizor better. However, without Firium Z, Rotom-H struggles to properly break through Pokemon that can stop it from using Volt Switch, like Gligar and Hippowdon</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to running a more offensive spread, this Rotom-H set struggles to check foes like Scizor as reliably as other variants. For example, Swords Dance Scizor's Life Orb-boosted Quick Attack has a high chance to OHKO Rotom-H after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock damage. Rotom-H should therefore try to preserve its HP if it is needed to check such Pokemon, either through using Pain Split more often or avoiding taking unnecessary chip damage. Rotom-H's Z-move allows it to break through Pokemon that could otherwise live a hit and either force it out or block its Volt Switch, like Nidoqueen. It also allows it to more consistently break through Electric-immune foes like Gligar and Hippowdon. Against Gligar, Rotom-H should be careful to not waste its Z-move, as it won't be able to break through it without it. Rotom-H should therefore be careful to not throw away its Z-move out randomly when other switch-ins like Latias are present. It is often wiser to use Pain Split, Toxic, or attempt to Volt Switch beforehand and wait for Electric-immune Pokemon to be in range of its Z-move. Pain Split and Toxic are great options to cripple switch-ins like Latias and Hydreigon, as well as Fire-resistant Ground-types like Swampert and Rhyperior. Notably, Pain Split also allows Rotom-H to remove a large portion of Blissey's HP while fully healing itself, letting it put in more consistent work versus stall teams.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dragon-types like Mega Altaria, Hydreigon, and Latias tend to switch into Rotom-H very consistently, especially when they are running recovery moves. Teammates like Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl can take advantage of this to get free opportunities to trap Latias with Pursuit. Mega Aerodactyl in particular appreciates Rotom-H crippling and breaking through Ground-types like Gligar and Hippowdon that it struggles with. Teammates like Scizor and Primarina are also helpful in this regard. Scizor is able to threaten Dragon Dance Mega Altaria that attempts to set up on Rotom-H and potentially Pursuit trap Latias. Primarina can pressure Hydreigon and either provide a defensive check to threats like Mega Aerodactyl and Nasty Plot Infernape or a wallbreaker that can help pressure Rotom-H's checks, especially those like Swampert and Rhyperior that can safely block its Volt Switch. Other wallbreakers, like mixed Infernape and Gengar, can pressure Ground-types for Rotom-H and appreciate being brought in against Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Altaria. Rotom-H's weakness to Stealth Rock means it benefits greatly from Defog and Rapid Spin support from Pokemon like Hydreigon, Tentacruel, and Empoleon. Hydreigon appreciates Rotom-H checking Togekiss, while Tentacruel and Empoleon provide reliable Primarina switch-ins. Tentacruel also provides a secondary Scizor check, while Empoleon can help Rotom-H break through Wish passers like Florges and Sylveon with Roar.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-C possesses an interesting niche in UU as a fast offensive pivot with a good matchup against some of the top threats in the tier like Primarina, Togekiss, and Mega Slowbro. Its secondary Grass typing and access to Leaf Storm make it extremely difficult to bring in a Ground-type Pokemon to block its Volt Switch, allowing it to gain momentum for its team quite easily. In addition to its useful STAB combination, it also has a handful of useful support moves such as Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Defog in its arsenal. Its access to Defog in particular also allows it to become a solid remover of entry hazards with a good matchup against common setters like Klefki, Hippowdon, and Empoleon. Additionally, Rotom-C's ability Levitate gives it a useful immunity to Ground-type moves. On the other hand, its typing gives it a poor matchup against many other significant threats in UU, most notably Dragon-type Pokemon like Hydreigon, Latias, and Mega Altaria. In addition to this, Rotom-C is held back by its somewhat average Special Attack that can pale in comparison to some of UU's more prominent special attackers like Mega Manectric and Hydreigon. Its Speed stat is only slightly above average as well, which means that it will almost always be forced out by faster offensive threats like Infernape, Latias, and Mega Beedrill. Its defensive prowess is also somewhat lackluster compared to Rotom-H's, and its base HP of 50 combined with weaknesses to Bug and Ice as well as its inability to face common Dragon-type Pokemon means that Rotom-C often won't bring much to a team defensively. Lastly, Rotom-C also lacks any powerful coverage to help it break through its normal checks. Conventional special walls like Blissey, Amoonguss, and Alolan Muk will almost always be able to beat it in a one-on-one scenario.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-C can use Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp in its fourth moveslot to leave a crippling status condition on threats to it such as Alolan Muk and Mega Altaria. It can also attempt to use a Choice Scarf to become a decent revenge killer but is often better off acting as an offensive Defogger with Grassium Z or Iapapa Berry. Choice Specs is another viable option so Rotom-C can act as a strong wallbreaker and pivot that can be very threatening with its high-Base Power STAB move in Leaf Storm; however, Rotom-C often prefers being able to switch between attacking moves so it can threaten more of the tier offensively as well as being able to use Defog without being forced out. Hidden Power Ice can catch Mega Sceptile that attempt to check Rotom-C and dent switch-ins like Latias and Mega Altaria. Rotom-C can also attempt to use lure sets like Dream Eater with Psychium Z and Signal Beam with Buginium Z. The former is used to surprise Chesnaught and Amoonguss, which can allow a teammate like Calm Mind Suicune to sweep more easily, and the latter is used to surprise Hydreigon and Latias.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Due to Rotom-C's STAB combination and lack of powerful coverage moves, it struggles to break through Dragon-types like Mega Altaria, Latias, and Hydreigon. Mega Sceptile in particular is 4x resistant to Leaf Storm and immune to Electric-type moves thanks to its ability Lighting Rod.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Most of UU's Grass-type Pokemon do not mind facing off with Rotom-C, as they can take advantage of it fairly easily. Mega Sceptile is immune to its Electric-type STAB moves thanks to Lightning Rod while also being 4x resistant to Leaf Storm due to its typing. Amoonguss can shrug off any of Rotom-C's hits besides the extremely rare Shattered Psyche from Dream Eater thanks to Regenerator constantly restoring a third of its HP. Celebi threatens to get free Nasty Plot boosts when facing off with Rotom-C as well. However, they all must be mindful of Rotom-C being commonly paired with Pursuit trappers.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Rotom-C's middling Special Attack and lack of coverage outside of Hidden Power means that conventional special walls often give it trouble. Blissey, Amoonguss, and Alolan Muk will all be able to stop Rotom-C in a one-on-one scenario, though Blissey and Amoonguss should be wary of Trick.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: While Rotom-C can switch in on weak Scald users such as Swampert and Suicune and passive Ground-types like Hippowdon, it should be wary of taking damage from status conditions like burn and poison as well as residual damage from sand and Stealth Rock, which can all wear it down very quickly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While Rotom-C's defensive prowess is decent, it often will still take a large amount of damage from any Pokemon that outpaces it. Mega Beedrill, Infernape, Mega Aerodactyl, and Nihilego are all examples of Pokemon that can threaten it with large amounts of damage before it can pivot out with Volt Switch.</p>",

Volt Switch is a slightly weaker Electric-type STAB attack than Thunderbolt but allows Rotom-C to gain momentum while dealing damage. Leaf Storm is Rotom-C's Grass-type STAB move, which is extremely powerful and deters Ground-types from switching into its Electric-type moves. Defog allows Rotom-C to remove entry hazards, which lets it and its teammates switch around more freely. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative option to OHKO Scizor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack gives Rotom-C the highest offensive output possible.

Grassium Z allows Rotom-C to use a 195-Base Power Bloom Doom to KO or heavily damage Pokemon such as Gligar without lowering its Special Attack. Alternatively, Rotom-C can use an Iapapa Berry to provide a method of sustaining its HP throughout the match while winning one-on-one matchups against Pokemon like Mamoswine with plenty of HP left to spare. Electrium Z is another good option to act as a catch-all powerful attack with the more specific targets being Pokemon such as Mega Aggron, Klefki, and Cobalion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Rotom-C excels at gaining momentum with Volt Switch, so it should attempt to create opportunities to use Volt Switch as much as possible. Rotom-C should avoid switching into strong hits due to its poor base 50 HP. It can come in on a weak Scald from Seismitoad, Swampert, and Suicune, as well as come in on Pokemon like Klefki, Togekiss, Alomomola, and Hippowdon. Rotom-C can also come in for free via momentum from a teammate's U-turn or Volt Switch. When running Hidden Power Fire, Rotom-C should attempt to lure in Scizor somehow. It can usually catch a healthy Scizor, since there will be little noticeable downside for the Scizor to use U-turn. Be wary of Pokemon that will attempt to take advantage of Rotom-C in its weakened state after using Leaf Storm, as it will be very easy to set up on if it has decreased Special Attack.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Rotom-C pairs well with Pursuit trappers like Krookodile and Scizor because it can easily lure in Latias and Celebi while using Volt Switch, which allows the Pursuit user to come in and trap them. Rotom-C synergizes with U-turn users like Scizor, Mega Beedrill, and Infernape, as they can pivot with Volt Switch and U-turn together to gain momentum throughout a match. Offensive VoltTurn teams that Infernape, Mega Beedrill, and Scizor often fit on will also appreciate Rotom-C's ability to remove entry hazards so they don't get worn down from switching constantly. Pokemon that can take advantage of common Dragon-types, such as Primarina, Klefki, and Scizor, appreciate being able to come in for free via Volt Switch against Latias or Hydreigon, as they are typically the safest switch-ins to Rotom-C. Additionally, since Rotom-C is a fairly consistent entry hazard remover, Pokemon susceptible to Stealth Rock like Moltres, Mega Beedrill, Mega Aerodactyl, and Talonflame all value Rotom-C's ability to remove it. Powerful wallbreakers like Terrakion, Crawdaunt, and Heracross appreciate Rotom-C's ability to bring them in for free via momentum from Volt Switch. In turn, these high-powered physical wallbreakers can threaten Rotom-C's usual counters like Blissey and Amoonguss. Lastly, Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Infernape, and Mamoswine all appreciate Rotom-C's ability to threaten bulky Water-types that attempt to switch into them.</p>"

  "Uxie": {
    "overview": "<p>Uxie is a fairly one-dimensional Pokemon, yet it finds itself a place in the UU metagame as a reliable Trick Room setter thanks to its ability to compress roles, its access to many different utility moves like Stealth Rock and Memento that allow it to support its team in various ways, and its great bulk, which allows it to sponge hits from Pokemon like Cobalion and Mega Aerodactyl as well as super effective hits such as Hydreigon's Dark Pulse and Krookodile and Alolan Muk's Knock Off. However, Uxie is almost entirely restricted to Trick Room teams due to being outclassed both offensively and defensively by other Psychic-types, such as Latias, Bronzong, and Necrozma, as it's unable to perform any other roles as effectively as them. Uxie is also very passive, as it can't do much damage to most Pokemon, meaning it's dead weight in most scenarios outside of performing its role. Substitute users like Nidoking and Kyurem, for example, can take advantage of it, as they're capable of blocking Memento. Furthermore, Uxie faces competition from other Trick Room setters such as Cresselia, which has access to Lunar Dance and reliable recovery, and Bronzong, which benefits from its Steel typing and has access to Explosion. They are usually better picks for a Trick Room setter, but this is only the case on Trick Room teams that are only using one dedicated setter.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Uxie doesn't have many other options outside of the Trick Room set. Offensive sets are outclassed by Latias, and Pokemon like Bronzong and Necrozma are usually better options as defensive Psychic-type Stealth Rock setters. Red Card could be used over Mental Herb, as it's a way to keep up momentum by forcing out an opposing Pokemon that hits Uxie. It's also a way of cancelling U-turn and Volt Switch's switching effect, bringing out a random Pokemon instead. However, without Mental Herb, Uxie can be easily shut down by common Taunt users. Darkinium Z is an option when using Memento, as it allows Uxie to take less damage from Knock Off and fully heal one of its teammates while keeping up momentum. However, using it would mean that none of Uxie's teammates could run a Z-Move. Skill Swap could be used to remove Magic Bounce from Pokemon like Mega Absol, allowing Uxie to set up Stealth Rock against it. However, there's not room for it most of the time. Hidden Power Fire allows Uxie to 2HKO offensive variants of Scizor, but it's usually not worth using, as it doesn't offer any other additional utility and it fails to do any significant damage to bulkier Scizor sets. Toxic can be used to cripple Pokemon that might try to take advantage of Uxie's passivity, such as Swampert and Hippowdon, but it's hard to fit onto the set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon like Choice Specs Gengar and Chandelure could potentially OHKO Uxie and prevent it from setting up Trick Room and Stealth Rock. Other strong wallbreakers that are able to 2HKO it, such as Hydreigon and Primarina, are also threatening for the same reason.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Pokemon like Swords Dance Scizor, Swords Dance Crawdaunt, and Calm Mind Suicune are able to take advantage of Uxie's passive nature and can set up on it with ease. Additionally, the Pokemon listed can also threaten most Trick Room teams due to either their access to priority or their ability to stall out Trick Room turns, which makes them especially threatening.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo are immune to Uxie's only attacking move and can threaten to 2HKO it with their super effective STAB moves, thus preventing it from setting up Trick Room or Stealth Rock. Hydreigon can also potentially cause it to flinch with Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: After it has used its Mental Herb, Uxie can be easily shut down by Taunt users like Krookodile.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Trick Room Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room grants Uxie and its teammates a form of speed control and a way of punishing offensive teams by making slower Pokemon move before faster ones. Stealth Rock is a necessity on every team, punishing switches by damaging foes. Memento allows Uxie to sacrifice itself to gain momentum and open up opportunities for one of its teammates to safely come in and potentially set up or pressure the opposing team. U-turn is another way to keep up momentum without having to sacrifice Uxie. Magic Coat is used to bounce back Spikes and Toxic Spikes from Pokemon like Klefki and Nihilego as well as Taunt, which is especially useful if Uxie is not carrying Mental Herb. Psychic can be used instead of Magic Coat in the last slot, allowing Uxie to hit Pokemon like Infernape for super effective damage, decreasing its passivity. However, without Magic Coat, Uxie becomes powerless against the aforementioned Spikes and Toxic Spikes setters.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread and nature maximize Uxie's defensive capabilities, allowing it to sponge hits from Pokemon like Cobalion and Mega Aerodactyl more easily. Additionally, a Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs make Uxie the fastest it can be under the effect of Trick Room. Levitate is Uxie's only ability and grants it a valuable Ground-type immunity. Mental Herb is used as a way to escape Taunt once. Colbur Berry is also an option, providing Uxie the ability to endure Dark-type attacks such as Hydreigon's Dark Pulse and Mega Sharpedo's Crunch, which could otherwise prevent it from setting up Trick Room or Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Uxie is generally used as a lead; if the opposing team has a Pokemon that could take advantage of it, such as a setup sweeper like Swords Dance Scizor, it's reasonable to choose not to lead with it as to not be put into a bad position from the start. Depending on the scenario, Uxie should try to set up Trick Room or Stealth Rock once it's brought out; it should prioritize setting up Stealth Rock first most of the time in order to preserve Trick Room turns. However, if faced against a foe such as Hydreigon or Choice Band Scizor that can 2HKO Uxie, Trick Room is the preferred play so that it can also set up Stealth Rock. Magic Coat should be used against Taunt users to prevent them from shutting down Uxie and to bounce back Spikes and Toxic Spikes from Pokemon like Klefki and Nihilego. It shouldn't be used to bounce back Stealth Rock, though, as Stealth Rock has more PP than Magic Coat, so Uxie will never prevent it from going up. Magic Coat also has less PP than Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but it's still beneficial to bounce those back to cripple the opposing team. Uxie doesn't usually provide much more utility after setting up Stealth Rock and Trick Room, so it's safe to use Memento to bring one of its teammates in safely in those situations. U-turn can be used similarly to Memento to bring one of Uxie's teammates in after Stealth Rock and Trick Room have been set. Be careful around Substitute users such as Chandelure and Kyurem, as once they're behind a Substitute, they're not affected by Memento and are only going to waste Trick Room turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Uxie only fits on dedicated Trick Room teams, so slower Pokemon that can take advantage of and pressure the opposing team are mandatory partners. Slower setup sweepers that usually take advantage of the support Memento can provide like Swords Dance Crawdaunt and Alolan Marowak and wallbreakers such as Bewear, Mega Abomasnow, and Mega Camerupt are examples of such Pokemon. Other slower Pokemon that also benefit from the effect of Trick Room like Stakataka are also good teammates. Other Trick Room setters, such as Cresselia and the aforementioned Stakataka, are also valuable partners, as Uxie is often not capable of keeping up Trick Room by itself for an entire match. Cresselia is a particularly good teammate, as it can set up Trick Room on a lot of Pokemon, provide Lunar Dance support, and offer similar defensive utility, which Uxie and most of the teams it's found on would appreciate. Fairy-type Trick Room setters such as Aromatisse also pair well with Uxie, since they can check Dark-types like Hydreigon and Crawdaunt.</p>"

  "Azelf": {
    "overview": "<p>Azelf is a versatile presence in the tier thanks to its vast movepool, which grants it several coverage and utility options alike. This in tandem with its blistering Speed and excellent offenses allows it to fulfill several unique roles in the metagame. Its access to Nasty Plot and the coverage necessary to hit most of the tier hard allows it to make for a formidable late-game sweeper. It can also function as an efficient dual screens setter or suicide lead with Stealth Rock thanks to the excellent combination of its Speed and access to useful utility moves in Taunt, Explosion, and Knock Off. Unfortunately, Azelf is severely hampered by its abysmal defenses, which leave it open to faster attackers, Choice Scarf users, and powerful priority attacks. This can complicate its ability to perform its various roles without significant support, often requiring careful play in order to make the most out of its tools. Lastly, because of its pitiful bulk and typing, Azelf suffers stiff competition in all of its common roles. Celebi and Latias provide more defensive utility with their typings, bulk, and access to recovery, making them more reliable options for special sweepers. Xatu stands as solid competition as a screens setter, providing Magic Bounce and a slower U-turn. Froslass competes heavily with Azelf for the slot of a suicide lead, providing spinblocking capabilities and unique utility with Icy Wind, Destiny Bond, and Cursed Body.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psychium Z is an option on Azelf's Nasty Plot set alongside Psyshock for allowing it to break both physically and specially defensive foes with one moveslot, giving it a decent stall matchup. However, Azelf often makes more consistent use of its other options for items, which better accommodate its poor longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Azelf's frailty allows most faster Pokemon, such as Zeraora and Mega Beedrill, to easily overwhelm it with powerful attacks. Mega Aerodactyl is particularly threatening due to its ability to trap Azelf with Pursuit. Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Infernape can also outrun and power through Azelf fairly efficiently. However, Krookodile must look out for Adrenaline Orb variants. Mega Manectric can naturally outpace Azelf, but it also has to watch out for sets running Adrenaline Orb.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Most Dark-type Pokemon have sufficient ways of pressuring Azelf, or at the very least forcing it into mind games. Choice Scarf variants of Hydreigon and Krookodile can hinder support sets from performing their roles, while Mega Sharpedo can use Speed Boost to outrun and overpower any Azelf set with Crunch. All of these must look out for Dazzling Gleam, however. Alolan Muk can sturdily check Azelf's Nasty Plot sets while threatening it with Knock Off and Pursuit, though it also must watch out for Explosion on support sets.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Azelf's pitiful bulk leaves it open to the majority of the tier's priority attacks. Doublade's Shadow Sneak and Bisharp's Sucker Punch both hit it super effectively, though it also takes significant damage from Mamoswine's Ice Shard, Scizor's Bullet Punch, Lucario's Extreme Speed, and Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Mimikyu</strong>: Mimikyu serves as a particularly reliable revenge killer to Azelf thanks to its Disguise ability, which allows it to always take an attack and hit Azelf hard with super effective Ghost-type STAB moves. Even with its Disguise broken, Mimikyu can heavily damage Azelf with priority Shadow Sneak and doesn't risk getting KOed by Explosion.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psyshock is Azelf's best STAB move for this set, 2HKOing Blissey after a boost and heavily damaging most targets that don't resist it. Psychic is an option over Psyshock for its ability to more efficiently power through various physically defensive Pokemon, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Rhyperior, and Gligar, though this comes at the cost of being unable to heavily damage Blissey. Flamethrower provides strong coverage against Steel-types like Scizor and Mega Steelix, consistently OHKOing the former and powering through the latter after a boost. Fire Blast provides a stronger Fire-type move at the cost of accuracy, allowing Azelf to more easily power through the likes of Empoleon and Mega Aggron. This does notably worsen its reliability against Scizor, however. Dazzling Gleam hits Hydreigon and Latias, which otherwise wall Azelf, super effectively. It also allows Azelf to cleanly OHKO Krookodile, offensive Mega Altaria, and Crawdaunt after a boost. Energy Ball is an option for powering through Rhyperior, Slowbro, Quagsire, and Hippowdon more easily than Azelf's other attacks. It also still hits Krookodile and Crawdaunt hard but leaves Azelf unable to combat Hydreigon and Latias.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Adrenaline Orb allows Azelf to take advantage of Krookodile and Mega Manectric's Intimidate to increase its Speed, allowing it to outrun the entire unboosted metagame and every relevant Choice Scarf user once activated. Life Orb is also an option for its ability to put a great amount of power behind Azelf's attacks, allowing it to reliably OHKO Mega Aggron with a boosted Fire Blast, for instance. This, however, does put it at risk of being easier to revenge kill with priority attacks, as well as by Choice Scarf users and Pursuit. Levitate is Azelf's only available ability, though it can be useful for easier setup against passive Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Azelf's frailty usually only allows it to set up once, meaning that it should usually only try functioning as a cleaner, sweeping in late-game scenarios after its checks have been removed. This also means that Azelf should generally refrain from coming into play earlier. However, its Speed tier can be used to help revenge kill various Pokemon, such as Infernape and Gengar, if need be. Faster Pokemon capable of outrunning Azelf, like Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill, should be outright removed from play to maximize its sweeping potential. Both mentioned threats can also carry Pursuit to trap Azelf with, making them particularly important to remove before bringing it out. Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon, Infernape, and Chandelure should also be removed. Azelf can circumvent this, however, if Adrenaline Orb is activated before these Pokemon try revenge killing it. Priority users like Scizor, Bisharp, Doublade, and Mamoswine should also be removed in order to more easily sweep late-game. It should be noted, however, that only Bisharp can KO Azelf from full, meaning that in emergency situations, it can still prevail against the other mentioned Pokemon. Azelf should utilize Adrenaline Orb to receive a boost in Speed from Pokemon with the Intimidate ability, such as Krookodile and Mega Manectric. This furthers its late-game sweeping potential by making it harder to revenge kill, outrunning the aforementioned threats and powering through them with its boosted attacks. If running Adrenaline Orb, Azelf should be extra careful about coming into play too early in matchups with Mega Manectric or Krookodile on the other team, as its item could get consumed too early for Azelf to adequately take advantage of its Speed boost. Azelf should capitalize on its coverage in matchups against bulkier teams to function as a wallbreaker instead of a cleaner, though it should be careful in doing this depending on the specific structures of said teams. If a Pokemon like Alolan Muk or Pyukumuku is being run, or if Azelf is using Psychic and can't break Blissey, it should try refocusing its role to break or clean after threats it can't take on are removed, much like in offensive matchups.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set's easiest fit is on offensive teams due to its nature as a late-game cleaner. Azelf greatly appreciates entry hazard support in order to more easily break past its foes, making Nihilego, Cobalion, and Terrakion solid options for teammates. Klefki can be particularly helpful due to its ability to provide Azelf with speed control with Thunder Wave as well as soften Azelf's slightly shaky matchups against Hydreigon and Latias. Knock Off support from the likes of Krookodile and Bisharp can also be beneficial, removing Choice Scarf from Pokemon like Infernape and Hydreigon and allowing Azelf to more easily sweep. Pursuit trappers such as Alolan Muk, Scizor, and Mega Aerodactyl can also patch up Azelf's shaky matchup against Latias while also taking care of Starmie, which it Speed ties with. Strong wallbreakers generally make good partners due to their ability to soften up opposing teams for Azelf to clean up. Examples include Nidoking, Primarina, and Mamoswine. Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile can help Azelf through their ability to revenge kill various faster Pokemon that threaten it, like Mega Aerodactyl. Lastly, pivots like Mega Manectric, Scizor, and Moltres can bring Azelf into play, circumventing its frailty. Mega Manectric and Moltres can also help improve the Scizor matchup.</p>"
      },
      "Suicide Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Azelf to support its team by dealing useful chip damage to foes. Explosion is an extremely powerful attack coming off Azelf's high Attack and is useful for heavily weakening a foe after Stealth Rock has been set. Taunt prevents opposing leads from setting their own entry hazards and also prevents the use of Defog from the likes of Latias, Empoleon, Moltres, and Mantine. Knock Off provides the utility of removing crucial items from foes, such as Krookodile's Choice Scarf, while also allowing Azelf to scout for Z-Crystals on foes. Fire Blast is an alternative to Knock Off, hitting Pokemon that don't take much damage from Explosion, such as Scizor and Cobalion, for super effective damage. Dazzling Gleam is an option for hitting Dark-types like Krookodile and Hydreigon harder. However, both are already hit fairly hard by Explosion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Speed allows Azelf to outspeed a good portion of the metagame, notably outpacing other leads such as Terrakion and Cobalion. Maximum investment in Attack is also quite important, as it puts as much power behind Explosion as possible. The remaining 4 EVs go into Special Attack to boost the power of Fire Blast if it's being used. A Jolly nature is used if Azelf uses Knock Off, making it as fast as possible without cutting into its bulk. However, a Naive nature is an option if Fire Blast is being used to prevent cutting into its power. Levitate is Azelf's only possible ability, but it is useful for avoiding Ground-type attacks from the likes of Swampert, Hippowdon, and Gligar, which Azelf can then reliably set Stealth Rock against.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Azelf functions best as a suicide lead on hyper offensive teams, which means that more often than not, it is best to bring Azelf into play first. However, some opponents may use counters, making it necessary to bring out a teammate capable of dealing with these threats first. Due to Azelf's poor bulk, Stealth Rock should almost always be used first, though Taunt should be used against opposing leads that are likely to set their own entry hazards or inflict Azelf with status, such as Swampert, Hippowdon, and Terrakion. Knock Off can also be used in certain situations, such as against Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Infernape. This allows Azelf to set Stealth Rock while also crippling these Pokemon, though it's worth noting that it likely won't be able to use Explosion. Azelf will usually opt to use Stealth Rock and then Explosion soon after. It is possible, however, to preserve Azelf for later on in the match after setting Stealth Rock, as with Focus Sash and Explosion, it can act as a decent revenge killer to boosted sweepers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Azelf's role as a suicide lead allows it to fit quite comfortably on hyper offensive teams, adequately supporting offensive threats that enjoy entry hazard support for securing KOs, such as Infernape, Celebi, and Hydreigon. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Talonflame, appreciate Azelf's ability to prevent opposing leads from setting it with Taunt. Frailer offensive Pokemon, such as Infernape and Starmie, are also appreciative of Azelf due to its ability to give them a safe opportunity to switch in with Explosion. Ghost-types like Gengar, Doublade, and Chandelure are capable of acting as spinblockers for Azelf, thus preventing its Stealth Rock from being removed. Tornadus can use its Defiant ability to deter Defog, which can otherwise prove troublesome for Azelf.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt is necessary on Azelf to prevent foes such as Froslass and Cobalion from setting up entry hazards and foes such as Gligar and Rotom-H from clearing your team's dual screens or entry hazards with Defog. It also prevents certain Pokemon such as Mega Altaria and Celebi from setting up on Azelf while it sets up dual screens. U-turn allows Azelf to generate momentum for its teammates in order to bring them in and let them set up under the protection of the dual screens while gaining small chip damage. However, due to Azelf's Speed, the newly brought-in Pokemon will usually have to take a hit or status move first. Explosion is an option over U-turn that allows Azelf to deal some final damage and guarantee a safe entry for a setup sweeper, but this prevents it from setting up dual screens again later in the match.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Defense investment allows Azelf to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Aerodactyl's Stone Edge and Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch if it uses Reflect after the first attack, while 216 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature let Azelf to outspeed all Pokemon up to and including Latias, allowing Azelf to set up dual screens before being attacked. Maximum HP and Speed investment can be run instead to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Manectric's Thunderbolt if Azelf uses Light Screen after the first attack and to outspeed Tornadus. Tornadus, however, has access to Prankster Defog to remove dual screens before being Taunted, and Mega Aerodactyl and Scizor are much more common than Mega Manectric, making this the inferior choice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Azelf's main objective during a match is to set up dual screens in order to support setup sweepers on its team. Azelf should aim to lead versus Pokemon that can't do much damage to it such as Froslass, which azelf can outspeed and Taunt to prevent it from setting up entry hazards. Azelf should, however, be careful of using Taunt on more offensive entry hazard setters such as Nihilego, Terrakion, and Rhyperior that can heavily damage it if predicted correctly. You should either focus on setting up dual screens in these scenarios or lead with a different Pokemon and set up dual screens with Azelf later when it is safer to do so. Against teams featuring Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Krookodile, it is unwise to lead with Azelf, as they can outspeed it and either KO it with their Dark-type STAB moves or Pursuit trap it to prevent it from setting up dual screens again later in the match. In these situations, Azelf should instead come in later when it can set up dual screens more reliably, such as against a Hydreigon Choice-locked into Draco Meteor. Azelf should try to preserve its health when possible in order to potentially set up dual screens again later in the match, such as by taking advantage of Choice-locked Pokemon such as Terrakion and Krookodile locked into an ineffective move. After setting dual screens, Azelf should use U-turn to pivot out into an appropriate setup sweeper. This enables Azelf to generate momentum and ease prediction in the case of the foe switching out while maximizing the number of usable turns of dual screens. Due to its Speed, however, Azelf will likely be moving first, and therefore the incoming Pokemon may have to take chip damage or potentially receive a status ailment such as a burn from Scald or Will-O-Wisp. If running Explosion, Azelf should use it to bring in a setup sweeper safely after setting up dual screens; the sweeper will not have to worry about status or chip damage like it would with U-turn. If Azelf still has high HP, or if the opposing Pokemon has no moves that could induce status such as Scald and Toxic, then directly switching is advisable over using Explosion in order to allow Azelf to set up dual screens again later in the game. Azelf should aim to use Taunt against Defog users such as Gligar and Empoleon to prevent them from potentially clearing your team's dual screens. Azelf should watch out for Knock Off users, including more passive Pokemon such as Empoleon and Tentacruel that it might otherwise try to set up dual screens on, as losing Light Clay will severely limit the number of turns that the dual screens last for.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Dual screens Azelf fits on hyper offense teams that can use the dual screens support to set up and break down opposing teams more easily. Krookodile pairs excellently with Azelf, as it is able to set Stealth Rock and stop opposing entry hazard setters and Defoggers with Taunt. It can also offer Knock Off support against Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon, allowing Azelf to set up dual screens on them more reliably. Scizor and Latias both greatly appreciate the dual screens support Azelf provides, allowing them to set up with Swords Dance and Calm Mind more easily, preventing Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Krookodile from revenge killing Latias as easily, and making Scizor less susceptible to Hidden Power Fire from opposing Pokemon. The free setup opportunity that dual screens provides these Pokemon allows them to be dangerous wallbreakers that the rest of the team can clean up after. Latias in particular offers the team a reliable check to bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Tentacruel, as it does not care as much about swapping in on a Scald and helps to check threatening setup sweepers such as Celebi, Infernape, and Lucario by virtue of its Speed tier and defensive typing. Other setup sweepers such as Feraligatr appreciate the dual screens support Azelf provides, as it allows them to set up more easily and potentially multiple times. Swords Dance Lucario and Terrakion can both pair nicely with Azelf, as Justified allows them to take advantage of Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Krookodile locked into Dark-type moves, giving them an opportunity to immediately break the opposing team, or to set up as the foe is forced out. Terrakion in particular appreciates the ability to survive Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch, even after a Defense drop from Close Combat. Frail setup sweepers such as Venomoth and Linoone can also take advantage of the ability to find easier boost and become harder to revenge kill via priority moves such as Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p>"

  "Shaymin": {
    "overview": "<p>Shaymin distinguishes itself from other offensive Grass-types like Celebi and Mega Sceptile with its access to Z-Celebrate, which boosts all of its stats by one stage. The boosted bulk and Speed can make Shaymin fairly difficult to revenge kill due to its neutrality to Scizor's Bullet Punch and ability to outspeed Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Hydreigon with boosts. Shaymin also finds easy opportunities to set up on common Pokemon such as Krookodile and Slowbro due to its decent Speed and bulk, which further defines its niche as the only viable user of Z-Celebrate in the tier. Access to the devastating Seed Flare can make common counters such as Mega Aggron and Moltres possibly lose if they immediately switch in and have their Special Defense dropped. Shaymin’s biggest flaw that it has only one opportunity to set up, which makes it confined to late-game as a cleaner. It needs to ensure that it doesn’t set up prematurely to where its checks can still reliably wall and remove it. Its mono-Grass typing can also be a burden due to the lack of a secondary typing that could give it leverage against checks such as Mega Aggron and Moltres. Shaymin also requires strenuous team support and the rest of the team to work together to remove or chip away at its checks to let it sweep late-game. Shaymin cannot circumvent special walls such as Blissey and Amoonguss, unlike other offensive Grass-types like Celebi and Decidueye. Because of this, Shaymin faces major competition from Celebi, which can reliably set up Nasty Plot far more throughout the match and can bust through common counterplay with Z-Moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Earth Power is stronger than Hidden Power Fire, so it allows Shaymin to nail bulky Steel-types for greater damage and hits Poison-types like Nihilego and Alolan Muk more reliably. However, Shaymin now fails to defeat bulkier Scizor sets, and Hidden Power Fire is sufficient to handle other Steel-types.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Blissey, Amoonguss, and Alolan Muk tank anything that Shaymin can throw at them despite them risking possible Special Defense drops. They still wall Shaymin indefinitely and can slowly but steadily beat it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Chandelure and Mega Houndoom threaten Shaymin drastically with their primary STAB attack, while Choice Scarf Infernape outspeeds it. Rotom-H and Moltres are also immune to the rare Earth Power from Shaymin.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Shaymin’s Hidden Power Fire lacks much firepower behind it, which makes Mega Aggron and Bronzong respectable walls unless they’ve taken considerable damage beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types like Moltres and Togekiss cannot be seriously harmed by any of Shaymin’s moves if they are still healthy.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dazzling Gleam is Shaymin’s first coverage option to nail Dragon-types that cannot be harmed by Seed Flare such as Hydreigon, Latias, and Mega Altaria. Hidden Power Fire is Shaymin’s way of removing Scizor while hitting other Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Doublade, and Bronzong.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Natural Cure can be decently useful to Shaymin, as it can pivot in for its teammates on status moves from Alomomola and Klefki. Normalium Z boosts all of Shaymin's stats by one stage when used in tandem with Celebrate, which increases its bulk and lets it outspeed Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Shaymin should only be brought in late-game once its checks and counters have either been chipped down or removed. Because of this, Shaymin should stay as healthy as possible and should never be brought in on anything unless it is a last resort scenario. Shaymin can set up on Pokemon such as Krookodile and Slowbro, as they fail to do any significant damage to it. However, Shaymin should avoid setting up on Pokemon that can still deal a significant amount of damage even if Shaymin can beat them, as Shaymin takes a longer time to break through them. Mega Steelix and Gligar are defensive Pokemon that fall under this criteria. Avoid Toxic and paralysis while setting up, as they can either hinder or neutralize Shaymin completely and waste its one opportunity at sweeping. Seed Flare is useful in fishing for possible Special Defense drops on Pokemon that take it neutrally such as Nihilego and Mega Steelix in order to break through them much more smoothly. Seed Flare can also place Pokemon such as Latias and Amoonguss in range of Shaymin’s coverage moves, but avoid spamming the move too much due to its very limited PP.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Shaymin fits best on specific bulky offense teams that offer constant support in order to let it clean up effectively. Shaymin easily takes advantage of the support offered from Pursuit, so Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Scizor, and Krookodile can scare out and weaken Blissey, Bronzong, and Moltres. Moltres and Rotom-H are effective stops to bulky Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Doublade so Shaymin won't have to rely too much on Hidden Power Fire. Terrakion and Infernape offensively pressure teams as powerful wallbreakers that can muscle through bulky Steel-types, take advantage of special walls like Blissey, and can possibly set up entry hazards. Overall, Stealth Rock is mandatory to chip down Grass-type switch-ins like various Fire- and Flying-types. Entry hazard setters like Nihilego and Rhyperior are good partners for this reason and they can also switch into Fire- and Flying-type moves aimed at Shaymin. Furthermore, Klefki can stack Spikes to constantly chip away the opposition, softening up bulky Steel-types for Shaymin to break more easily. Pivoting can also be used to get Shaymin in safely before attempting a sweep. Scizor is a great pivot, as it can lure in bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Gligar for Shaymin to take advantage of while also fulfilling the role as a Pursuit trapper.</p>"

  "Seismitoad": {
    "overview": "<p>Seismitoad's niche over other Ground-type Stealth Rock setters in the metagame lies in its access to Water Absorb, which allows it to threaten common Water-type Pokemon like Slowbro, Tentacruel, and Empoleon more easily. Its above average Speed also allows it to fill a more offensive role on some teams while also providing some defensive utility by offensively checking Pokemon like Scizor, Crawdaunt, Choice Specs Primarina, and Volcanion. Furthermore, Seismitoad fares well against some of the tier's most common threats, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Rotom-H, thanks to its solid defensive typing. Despite not having the greatest offensive stats, Seismitoad can also be somewhat difficult to switch into due to its decent offensive typing and coverage moves such as Hidden Power Fire and Sludge Wave. However, Seismitoad can be easily worn down, as it doesn't have access to reliable recovery, relying on Leftovers to stay healthy. This is aggravated by its vulnerability to status-inducing moves, specifically Toxic, which hinders Seismitoad's ability to check the Pokemon it's supposed to in the long run. Its 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks also holds it back defensively, making it harder for it to check Pokemon like Infernape, Zeraora, and Mega Manectric due to their access to coverage moves like Grass Knot and Hidden Power Grass. Seismitoad also faces heavy competition from other Ground-types as a Stealth Rock setter. Hippowdon's better overall bulk and access to more utility options such as Whirlwind and Slack Off make it the preferred option as a defensive Stealth Rock setter most of the time, as it's capable of keeping a much wider array of threats in check reliably. Seismitoad must also compete with other offensive Stealth Rock setters like Krookodile and Mamoswine, which have far superior offensive capabilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Refresh is a viable option on Seismitoad's defensive set that allows it to cure itself from status conditions, which makes it easier for it to check Pokemon that rely on status to cripple it, such as Empoleon and Rotom-H. However, it forces Seismitoad to give up Toxic, which means it has a much harder time pressuring bulky Water-types like Slowbro while also allowing Pokemon like Latias and Hydreigon to freely switch into it without any difficulty.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage</strong>: Amoonguss is one of Seismitoad's biggest counters, as it's able to comfortably switch into any of its moves and OHKO it with its Grass-type STAB move. Although Pokemon like Rotom-C and Tsareena take a lot from an Expert Belt-boosted Hidden Power Fire or Sludge Wave, they can also threaten Seismitoad heavily, as they're also able to remove Seismitoad's Stealth Rock from the field with Defog and Rapid Spin, respectively. Additionally, Pokemon that usually carry Grass-type coverage such as Hidden Power Grass Mega Manectric and Grass Knot Nihilego can pressure Seismitoad, but they can't switch in.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Pokemon like Latias and Hydreigon take little to no damage from Seismitoad's STAB moves, being immune to Ground-type attacks and resisting Water-type attacks, and can either threaten it with a strong hit or Defog its Stealth Rock away from the field. They must be wary of being hit by Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Articuno can easily switch into Seismitoad's attacks without having to fear anything from it. Articuno can also clear Seismitoad's Stealth Rock away from the field and threaten Seismitoad with Freeze-Dry, and it doesn't mind being hit with a Toxic, as it runs Heal Bell.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Seismitoad's suboptimal bulk leaves it susceptible to strong attackers like Terrakion, Scizor, and Mamoswine that can easily break through it.</p>",

      "Offensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earth Power is notable for OHKOing Pokemon like Volcanion and Cobalion when holding an Expert Belt, and it is integral in letting Seismitoad pressure Empoleon and Tentacruel. Hidden Power Fire allows Seismitoad to revenge kill offensive Scizor, which other moves fail to do. Sludge Wave can also be used, allowing Seismitoad to hit Pokemon like Primarina, Rotom-C, Mega Altaria, and Celebi super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Seismitoad to outspeed maximum Speed Scizor while also retaining some bulk. Water Absorb grants Seismitoad an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to take advantage of Pokemon like Starmie, Choice Specs Primarina, and Volcanion. Leftovers is the item of choice, as it provides Seismitoad with a form of passive recovery, allowing it to be more durable and tank certain hits more easily, such as Mega Aerodactyl's Wing Attack. Expert Belt is also an option, as it allows Seismitoad to secure the OHKO on offensive Scizor and Volcanion while also giving it a chance to OHKO Hippowdon without hindering its longevity too much. 228 Speed EVs should be used with Expert Belt to outspeed Volcanion, one of its main targets. It also allows Seismitoad to outspeed base 60s like Primarina and Bewear.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Seismitoad should be brought in via double switching or on a U-turn or Volt Switch, as it's not bulky enough to switch directly into attacks. However, it can attempt to switch into Pokemon like Rotom-H or moves like Scizor's Bullet Punch. Once it's brought onto the field, Seismitoad should attempt to set up Stealth Rock on a free turn due to its ability to force switches. However, if there's a Pokemon on the opposing team that could remove Stealth Rock from the field like Rotom-C or Hydreigon, Seismitoad should either attack accordingly or switch out. After setting up Stealth Rock, Seismitoad should focus on wallbreaking and weakening the opposing team by using its STAB and coverage moves appropriately. Sludge Wave should be used on a predicted switch to Pokemon like Celebi and the aforementioned Rotom-C, while Hidden Power Fire should only be used against Scizor, as it's too weak to be useful in any other scenario. Although it's immune to Water-type attacks thanks to Water Absorb, Seismitoad should not be recklessly switching into every potential attack, as most Water-type Pokemon can hit it very hard with a different move and bulky Water-types can cripple it with Toxic. As such, it should only switch into a Water-type attack if it's certain that the opponent will use one or from a Choice-locked Pokemon like Primarina or Volcanion. Seismitoad should be wary of Grass-type coverage such as Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Grass and Infernape's Grass Knot, as they can easily OHKO it. Avoid switching into a potential Knock Off, Toxic, or Will-O-Wisp because Seismitoad can be easily worn down, especially without its Leftovers, meaning sets utilizing Expert Belt have to be particularly cautious.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seismitoad fits best on offensive builds that benefit from its ability to reliably set up Stealth Rock without giving up momentum and keep threatening Pokemon like Swords Dance Scizor in check. U-turn and Volt Switch users like Mega Beedrill and Rotom-C pair well with Seismitoad for their ability to bring it safely onto the field. Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Latias have good synergy with Seismitoad, since they're able to check Grass-types like Celebi and provide a secondary check to Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Zeraora, which Seismitoad usually struggles to deal with on its own. In return, Seismitoad is able to pressure Steel-types like Empoleon and Mega Aggron while also being able to revenge kill Scizor. Pokemon that can sponge Grass-type attacks such as Rotom-H and Moltres make good teammates for Seismitoad as well, as it's heavily threatened by them. Dragon-type Pokemon like Latias and Hydreigon can switch into Seismitoad with ease and hit it hard with one of their STAB moves. As such, Dragon-type checks such as Mega Altaria and Klefki pair well with Seismitoad. Other Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Sylveon, and Florges can also pivot into the likes of Hydreigon as well as provide Seismitoad with Heal Bell support, the latter two also being able to alleviate its lack of recovery with Wish support. Pursuit users such as Choice Band Scizor and Mega Aerodactyl also make great partners, as they can trap and remove Celebi and Latias for Seismitoad. Wallbreakers such as Terrakion and Infernape are able to threaten the special walls that try to tank Seismitoad's attacks, thus making them good partners.</p>"

      "Defensive Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Earthquake is preferred over any other Ground-type STAB moves because it allows Seismitoad to hit certain Pokemon harder, notably 2HKOing Empoleon and OHKOing Nihilego. However, Earth Power can be used instead to hit Pokemon like Cobalion and Crawdaunt harder. Toxic is used to cripple Pokemon that would otherwise wall Seismitoad, such as Slowbro and Latias. Alternatively, Refresh can be used to cure itself of status ailments such as poison and burn that would otherwise whittle it down.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers provides Seismitoad with the passive recovery it needs to help it check the threats it needs to. Water Absorb grants Seismitoad an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to take advantage of Pokemon like Choice Specs Primarina and Volcanion.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The point of this set is to make use of Seismitoad's immunity to Water-type attacks to threaten bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Alomomola with Toxic, something Pokemon like Swampert and Hippowdon have a hard time doing. Seismitoad is a relatively straightforward Pokemon to use: it should attempt to switch into Pokemon that it can check like Mega Aerodactyl and Slowbro in order to find an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Even though Water Absorb grants Seismitoad an immunity to Water-type attacks, it should not be recklessly switching into any Water-type Pokemon, as they can still hit it very hard with a different move. It's safe to switch into a Water-type attack from a Choice-locked Pokemon like Primarina or Volcanion, however, or when it's certain that the foe will use said move. Since it doesn't have access to reliable recovery, Seismitoad can be easily worn down. As such, it should try to avoid tanking hits unnecessarily, as that would hinder its ability to check what it's intended to. It should also avoid switching into a potential Knock Off, Toxic, or Will-O-Wisp for the same reason, as it heavily relies on Leftovers as its main form of recovery. However, if running Refresh then status such as the aforementioned Toxic aren't as worrying and Seismitoad should attempt to cleanse itself of any status ailment as soon as inflicted. This being key for allowing Seismitoad to indefinitely wall the likes of Rotom-H. Be wary of Grass-type coverage such as Mega Manectric's Hidden Power Grass and Infernape's Grass Knot, as they can easily OHKO Seismitoad.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Seismitoad fits best on balance or bulky offense builds that appreciate its ability to set up Stealth Rock and wear down bulky Water-types with Toxic. The best partners for Seismitoad are Pokemon that can sponge Grass-type attacks like Moltres, Latias, and Hydreigon, as Seismitoad is very threatened by them. Latias and Hydreigon are exceptionally good partners because they're also able to provide a secondary check to Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Zeraora, Pokemon that Seismitoad has trouble dealing with on its own. Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon and Florges is appreciated, as Seismitoad is prone to being worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery. Cleric support from Pokemon like Togekiss, Blissey, and the aformentioned Sylveon and Florges is also very useful, since Seismitoad is heavily crippled by status. Dragon-type Pokemon like Latias and Hydreigon can easily switch into Seismitoad and take advantage of its passive nature, so Pokemon that can check them, such as the aforementioned Togekiss and Florges, make good teammates. Pursuit users are extremely useful partners, especially if Seismitoad is not running Toxic in order to trap and remove Pokemon like Latias and Celebi that easily pivot into it. Pokemon that appreciate bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Alomomola being worn down like to be partnered with Seismitoad. Examples include Cobalion, Mega Aerodactyl, and Infernape. Entry hazards are another way to wear down Seismitoad, so Pokemon that can remove them from the field like Defog Rotom-H and Hydreigon pair well with it.</p>"

  "Krookodile": {
    "overview": "<p>With the ability to fulfill many roles, Krookodile is a big threat in the UnderUsed metagame and is capable of fitting onto multiple team archetypes. Its great typing gives it excellent coverage between its STAB attacks as well as key immunities to Psychic- and Electric-type attacks and four helpful resistances. Its Intimidate ability further solidifies its defensive capabilities and allows it to function as a capable Stealth Rock setter. Krookodile also excels as one of the tier's best Choice Scarf users thanks to its ability to revenge kill several foes quite easily as well as take advantage of the switches it forces with STAB Pursuit. However, Krookodile's typing provides with as many useful resistances as common weaknesses, most notably to Fairy-, Water-, and Fighting-type attacks. Krookodile can also be hindered at times by its Speed tier if it isn't running Choice Scarf, which, while not bad, leaves it outsped by several offensive Pokemon, including Terrakion, Celebi, and Infernape. Lastly, Krookodile is also hurt by its only average damage output, which prevents it from breaking past especially bulky foes like Hippowdon, Suicune, and Alomomola.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Krookodile can run Beat Up as an option on Choice Scarf sets to deal with leads such as Froslass and Azelf as well as revenge kill Substitute Gengar better, however, it is very dependant on not losing members of its team to be of any use. Krookodile can run Iron Tail to help deal with common Fairy-types like Togekiss and Mega Altaria, but its shaky accuracy and poor coverage outside of this make it hard to justify. Fire Fang can be used if needed to OHKO Scizor, but it doesn't provide any other significant coverage. Choice Band is an option for giving Krookodile a decent amount of wallbreaking prowess and surprising Pokemon like Blissey and Mega Steelix. However, Krookodile's poor Speed and the drawbacks of its STAB attacks make this a difficult set to consistently put to effective use, which makes Pokemon like Nidoking and Mamoswine better options as Ground-type wallbreakers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Bulky Fairy-types like Sylveon, defensive Primarina, and Togekiss can freely switch in on Krookodile's Choice Scarf set, though Togekiss fears Stone Edge. Fairy-types without recovery like Choice Specs Primarina can't directly switch in, but they can force Krookodile out with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Heracross can freely switch in on Krookodile while threatening to either set up or KO it with STAB attacks, while other Fighting-types in Terrakion, Cobalion, Lucario, and Infernape can't directly come in but can threaten to KO Krookodile with STAB attacks. Infernape and Lucario frequently run Vacuum Wave on their specially offensive sets, allowing them to even potentially work around Krookodile if it's wielding a Choice Scarf.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss can threaten to immobilize Krookodile with Spore while wearing it down with Giga Drain. Celebi fears Dark-type STAB moves from the Choice Scarf set, but it can still threaten Krookodile with either Leaf Storm or Giga Drain and take any attack Krookodile can throw at it if it's at full health. More uncommon options in Chesnaught and Tsareena tank any of Krookodile's attacks fairly reliably, though neither necessarily appreciates losing its item.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Several Water-types are bulky enough to tank Krookodile's hits while either setting up on it or wearing it down with Scald. Rest variants of Calm Mind Suicune can set up on Krookodile for free while absorbing Knock Off if running Waterium Z. Slowbro can tank Knock Off from full, even avoiding very heavy damage if it's running either Colbur Berry or a Z-Crystal, and proceed to hit Krookodile hard with Scald while recovering any damage taken with Regenerator. Water-types that can't switch in, such as Crawdaunt, Choice Specs Primarina, and Starmie, can still heavily threaten Krookodile with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Krookodile will often struggle to break through Pokemon with exceptional physical bulk, such as Alomomola, Hippowdon, and even Mega Slowbro. They can easily stall out Krookodile with Toxic, but they often won't appreciate being hit with Taunt. Bulky variants of Scizor possess enough physical bulk to reliably tank most hits from Krookodile while recovering with Roost, while in return threatening to either set up on Krookodile or nail it with a super effective STAB U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: While they may not be able to outspeed the Choice Scarf set, the likes of Terrakion, Cobalion, and Hydreigon can all outspeed and heavily pressure Krookodile's Stealth Rock set. Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Latias, and Hydreigon can outspeed even the Choice Scarf set and proceed to heavily threaten Krookodile with powerful STAB moves or super effective coverage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is a powerful STAB attack that burdens most foes with the removal of their items. Earthquake is a very powerful secondary STAB attack that reliably revenge kills Pokemon like Infernape, Mega Manectric, and Terrakion. Pursuit punishes foes that may try switching out of Krookodile, such as Gengar, Latias, Nihilego, and Celebi, by trapping and either KOing or severely weakening them. Stone Edge nails Flying-types that may try switching in on Earthquake, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Togekiss, and Moltres. Crunch is an alternate option over Stone Edge that OHKOes even Z-Move variants of Latias after Stealth Rock, allowing Krookodile to revenge kill it reliably. It also deals greater damage to most Celebi sets, which usually run a Z-Crystal or Colbur Berry, than Knock Off. Superpower can also be used in the fourth moveslot to hit Hydreigon, a Pokemon that otherwise walls Krookodile, for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Attack maximizes Krookodile's offensive presence, and 252 EVs invested in Speed with a Jolly nature make it as fast as possible. A Choice Scarf further boosts Krookodile's Speed, allowing it to outrun prominent threats like Latias, Mega Manectric, and Starmie. Intimidate is the preferred ability, as it lowers foes' Attack stats, which allows Krookodile to switch in more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in the tier as well as +1 Pokemon like Mega Altaria and Adamant Mega Sharpedo, so it should be used as a revenge killer. Krookodile should look to switch in on attacks it resists from Pokemon it can either revenge kill or Pursuit trap, such as Latias, Mega Manectric, and Nihilego. When a foe is predicted to switch out, it is best to use Pursuit to trap and deal heavy damage to it. Foes that will commonly switch out of Krookodile include Latias, Starmie, Gengar, and Mega Manectric. Knock Off should be used frequently early-game, as Krookodile will often annoy foes that even resist the attack by removing items. Most of Krookodile's attacks are rather undesirable to stay locked into for long, as this allows Pokemon like Cobalion, Suicune, and Scizor to begin setting up on Krookodile. Due to this, Krookodile should immediately switch out as its foe begins setting up and bring in a teammate that can reliably take care of the foe. Due to the nature of Choice Scarf, it is best that Krookodile carefully predicts when attacking. For example, if a Flying-type is expected to switch into an anticipated Earthquake, Krookodile should predict the switch by using Stone Edge to hit it super effectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fighting-types such as Infernape, Cobalion, and Terrakion appreciate Krookodile's ability to Pursuit trap the Ghost- and Psychic-types that often pressure them. Other Pokemon that enjoy the removal of Psychic-types like Latias, such as Tentacruel, Mew, and Suicune, also appreciate Krookodile as a teammate. Electric- and Grass-types like Zeraora, Mega Manectric, Celebi, and Roserade can pressure the bulky Water-types that Krookodile often struggles to break past. Krookodile also appreciates Psychic- and Fairy-types like Starmie, Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Primarina thanks to their ability to threaten Fighting-types. Powerful wallbreakers like Primarina, Scizor, Terrakion, and Lucario can break past the bulkier Pokemon that Krookodile can have problems with while also potentially paving the way for it to clean late-game. Entry hazard support from the likes of Cobalion, Mega Aggron, and Nihilego can let Krookodile break past foes more easily. Klefki is a particularly good entry hazard setter to pair with Krookodile, as it can come in on Bug-, Fairy-, Grass-, and Ice-type attacks and appreciates the removal of Fire-types. Toxic Spikes from Tentacruel is also notably helpful to Krookodile, as Toxic poison punishes several Pokemon that try switching in on Krookodile, like Swampert, Suicune, and Mega Slowbro.</p>"
      },
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock provides crucial entry hazard support for Krookodile and its teammates and pressures some of its common switch-ins such as Togekiss and Mega Aerodactyl. Knock Off heavily damages common Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latias, Starmie, and Chandelure and cripples defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola and Blissey with the removal of their items. The combination of Knock Off and Taunt allows Krookodile to hinder threats like Suicune, giving teammates an easier time in dealing with them. Earthquake provides a consistent STAB option for Krookodile that can heavily threaten foes such as Mega Manectric, Tentacruel, and Empoleon. Taunt helps Krookodile keep entry hazards off its side of the field from slower setters like Hippowdon and Mega Aggron while stopping walls such as Blissey and Quagsire from recovering HP or using Toxic. Taunt also shuts down Defoggers like Empoleon, Mew, and Rotom-H. Pursuit puts pressure on Dark-weak foes like Latias and Gengar and can effectively trap and remove them to benefit Krookodile and its teammates. Alternatively, Stone Edge can also be used in the last slot to hit Flying-types such as Togekiss and Moltres, but it lacks the utility of Taunt or Pursuit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs maximize Krookodile's offensive presence so it can deal with the Pokemon that it checks more easily, and 252 Speed EVs coupled with a Jolly nature allow it to outspeed common foes like Nidoking, Tentacruel, and Lucario. Intimidate cripples physical attackers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Aggron, increasing Krookodile's longevity and ability to set up hazards against them. It also helps Krookodile take hits from some of its checks such as Choice Band Scizor. Iapapa Berry provides Krookodile with a burst of recovery when its health drops low, allowing it to stay in on Pokemon like Hippowdon and Mega Steelix to set up entry hazards and pressure them with Taunt and Earthquake respectively. Krookodile can utilize Groundium Z to power up Earthquake to a 180-Base Power Tectonic Rage that either OHKOes or severely weakens foes like Scizor and Mega Aggron. Focus Sash is also an option, guaranteeing that Krookodile survives a hit in order to perform its role, which can be especially useful on offensively inclined teams. Rocky Helmet is an option that further pressures physical attackers, damaging all contact move users and allowing Krookodile to weaken some of its answers like Scizor. Leftovers can be run as another option, providing Krookodile with a form of longevity. Iapapa Berry is also an option for improving its longevity, restoring Krookodile's health after it's been weakened and allowing it to more easily set Stealth Rock multiple times in a match.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Krookodile should be primarily used early-game to set up Stealth Rock, taking advantage of its good matchup against other Stealth Rock users such as Gligar and Hippowdon to either cripple them with Knock Off or afflict them with Taunt. After Stealth Rock has been set up, Krookodile can utilize Taunt and its offensive typing to pressure Defoggers like Empoleon, Mew, and Rotom-H to keep its hazards up. Knock Off should be used liberally, particularly against defensive teams, to remove items early-game to cripple foes and make it easier for Krookodile's teammates to break them. Earthquake's high Base Power and overall good neutral coverage means it can be used frequently, especially to weaken or KO bulky hazard removers like Empoleon and Tentacruel. If Krookodile is running Iapapa Berry it can stay in on Pokemon like Mega Steelix and Rotom-H to use Earthquake and Knock Off respectively knowing it can regain lost health once its health drops below the threshold. If running Groundium Z, it should be saved for breaking past a particularly bulky target like Mega Aggron or OHKOing a crucial threat that avoids it otherwise. Focus Sash Krookodile should be used as your lead so it can immediately set up Stealth Rock, unless there are faster Pokemon like Froslass, Mew, and Crobat that can Taunt Krookodile, though Mew does have to risk the mind games between Taunt and Will-O-Wisp. Pursuit can be used when predicting a Pokemon that is severely threatened by Krookodile to switch out, particularly Latias and Chandelure, due to Krookodile's ability to survive an unboosted attack from them and retaliate for an OHKO on both. If Krookodile is severely weakened and Stealth Rock is up, it can be used to switch into some physically oriented answers, such as Crawdaunt and Scizor, to lower their Attack with Intimidate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Krookodile fits best on bulky offense and balance teams due to its offensive and defensive capabilities. Krookodile's vulnerability to the ever-present Fairy-type moves from foes such as Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Primarina can be problematic, so bulky Steel-types like Empoleon, Scizor, and Doublade can act as switch-ins to them. Cobalion also pairs well with Krookodile due to its ability to absorb U-turn and act as a setup sweeper that can capitalize on Krookodile's hazards to punish foes. The aforementioned teammates can also switch into Grass-type moves from Celebi as well as U-turn from Scizor and Mega Beedrill. Pokemon that appreciate the constant chip damage that Stealth Rock provides and have the ability to force switches to capitalize on this are also appreciated; as such, strong wallbreakers like Primarina, Terrakion, and Latias, and sweepers like Mega Altaria and Mimikyu make for good teammates. These teammates can also take advantage of Krookodile's Knock Off support. Krookodile's average Speed stat leaves it outsped and pressured by foes such as Kyurem and Starmie; a faster partner that can take advantage of these checks, such as Mega Manectric or Mega Aerodactyl, is appreciated due to this. In addition, a Choice Scarf user such as Togekiss or Infernape is also an option. Due to Krookodile's lack of recovery, it is prone to being chipped and worn down. Wish support from Sylveon and Florges patches up this issue and enables Krookodile to set up Stealth Rock more consistently.</p>"

  "Darmanitan": {
    "overview": "<p>While Darmanitan possesses a remarkable Attack stat that is further boosted by its ability Sheer Force, it struggles to perform the role of a wallbreaker reliably. Darmanitan is susceptible to being revenge killed, as it is easily worn down through the combination of its weakness to Stealth Rock and recoil damage from Flare Blitz, a move it is overreliant on due to lacking a secondary STAB move to spam. This lack of a dual typing also gives Darmanitan a lot of competition with Infernape, which doesn't have a Stealth Rock weakness, has access to boosting moves in Nasty Plot and Swords Dance, boasts a higher Speed stat, and has access to priority moves like Vacuum Wave and a wider movepool to break past common checks in Mega Altaria, Primarina, and Suicune. Darmanitan is further hindered by its base 95 Speed tier, which, while respectable, leaves it outpaced and revenge killed by a lot of common threats like Hydreigon and Terrakion. Furthermore, very lackluster defenses go with its mono-Fire typing leave Darmanitan unable to take even resisted hits such as a Bullet Punch from Choice Band Scizor, which can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock damage; this leaves it unable to take advantage of the defensive capabilities of its typing at all, meaning it struggles to compete with Infernape in this regard, which is able to deal with threats like Bisharp and the aforementioned Scizor much better.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Darmanitan should attempt to wallbreak by switching in safely via a slow pivoting move, off a predicted double switch, or after a partner Pokemon fainting due to its susceptibility to being worn down too quickly if forced to take a hit. This provides Darmanitan with optimal opportunities to wallbreak because almost everything in the tier is unable to switch into a Choice Band- and Sheer Force boosted Flare Blitz well. While this is the case, Darmanitan is unable to reliably break past Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Suicune, and defensive Mega Altaria due to its lack of coverage options, unlike Infernape, which can run a multitude of different sets with coverage options like Grass Knot and Gunk Shot. Infernape also outclasses Darmanitan as a Choice Band user, as it has a better Speed tier with a secondary STAB option in Close Combat and, as previously mentioned, coverage like Gunk Shot to break past some of their shared Fire-type checks. Furthermore, Choice Band Infernape's Fighting typing removes the weakness to Stealth Rock that greatly hinders Darmanitan. Darmanitan also fails to compete against other noticeable wallbreakers in the tier such as Crawdaunt and Terrakion when it comes to utilizing a Choice Band, as the former has access to priority and the latter has a greater Speed tier, with both also having a better offensive typing.</p>"

  "Cofagrigus": {
    "overview": "<p>Cofagrigus's access to Nasty Plot and Trick Room makes it a potent sweeper in the UU metagame, particularly against offensively inclined teams, where it generally outspeeds every Pokemon while Trick Room is up. Its Ghost typing is good offensively, especially when paired with Ghostium Z, with STAB Shadow Ball only being resisted by Dark- and Normal-types like Hydreigon and Blissey. Cofagrigus also possesses great natural bulk, especially physically, granting it a solid number of setup opportunities and allowing it to act as a blanket check to certain physical threats such as Scizor and Mega Altaria. Ghost is rather mediocre defensively, though it does give Cofagrigus setup opportunities against Pokemon like Cobalion and Choice Scarf Infernape. Cofagrigus's ability Mummy helps it set up in the face of Pokemon such as Scizor and physical Mega Altaria that rely on their abilities to do meaningful damage. However, Cofagrigus is not particularly threatening without both Nasty Plot and Trick Room set up, often being either too weak to execute a sweep without Nasty Plot boosts or revenge killed by a faster Pokemon outside of Trick Room. It also struggles to break past any formidable special wall that is not hit at least neutrally by its Ghost STAB moves; examples include Blissey and Alolan Muk. While in theory Hidden Power Fighting offers fantastic coverage alongside Cofagrigus's STAB Shadow Ball, its low Base Power leads Cofagrigus to struggle against Ghost-resistant Pokemon such as Blissey and Mega Pidgeot, due to the former's great Special Defense and the latter's neutrality to Fighting-type moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cofagrigus possesses a decent array of utility moves that could be utilized on a more defensive set such as Will-O-Wisp, Toxic Spikes, Pain Split, Hex, and Haze. However, its mediocre defensive typing and poor HP stat prevent any combination of these from being too effective in comparison to its extremely threatening offensive Trick Room set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey, Alolan Muk, and the uncommon Haze Mantine completely wall Cofagrigus and can proceed to take advantage of it, though Mantine must be wary of Never-Ending Nightmare if it has taken prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Dark-types</strong>: Hydreigon, Mega Sharpedo, and Crawdaunt deal huge damage with their Dark STAB moves and prevent Cofagrigus from setting up. Bisharp in particular is threatening, as it can bypass Trick Room with its priority Sucker Punch and pick off a weakened Cofagrigus, though it must look out for Hidden Power Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Gengar, Primarina, Nidoking, and Moltres take advantage of Cofagrigus's mediocre special bulk and prevent any setup attempt. Mega Pidgeot in particular presents a huge stop to any sweep attempt due to its immunity to Ghost and neutrality to Cofagrigus's weak Fighting coverage.</p>",

      "Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shadow Ball is Cofagrigus's main STAB move, with few strong Pokemon resisting it in the UU tier. Never-Ending Nightmare deals huge damage after a Nasty Plot boost to even the bulkiest of targets, provided that they do not resist Ghost. Hidden Power Fighting deals super effective damage to Dark- and Normal-types like Krookodile and Bewear that resist or are immune to Shadow Ball. Nasty Plot raises Cofagrigus's Special Attack by two stages, letting it do huge amounts of damage to foes. For four turns, Trick Room often makes Cofagrigus the fastest Pokemon on the field, which is perfect for a late-game sweep after a Nasty Plot boost or two.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP improves Cofagrigus's overall bulk as much as possible. 252 Special Attack EVs along with a Quiet nature let it hit as hard as possible in its attempt to sweep late-game. The Quiet nature also couples with its 0 Speed IVs in hopes of making Cofagrigus the fastest Pokemon under Trick Room at all times. Ghostium Z allows Cofagrigus to break past bulkier targets like Primarina, Amoonguss, and Togekiss that may get in the way of its sweep, as well as reducing the Base Power of opposing Knock Off. Mummy lets Cofagrigus check Scizor, Flame Orb Heracross, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria more effectively, as they largely rely on their abilities to deal damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>It is preferable to bring Cofagrigus in to clean up late-game after opposing dedicated special walls and Dark-types have been weakened to the point that they can no longer stand in the way of a sweep. Set up Nasty Plot and Trick Room against Pokemon such as Infernape, Cobalion, and Mienshao that deal minimal amounts of damage to Cofagrigus. Always keep an eye out for other setup opportunities such as a Latias or Choice Scarf Hydreigon using Draco Meteor and dropping its Special Attack by two stages. It is ideal to keep Cofagrigus healthy if aiming to sweep with it late-game. Cofagrigus can be used to check Pokemon like Scizor and Mega Aerodactyl in a pinch, but this should really only be done if sweeping later on is out of the question.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Cofagrigus fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to clean late-game and act as a blanket check to physical attackers if need be. Fighting-types like Cobalion and Infernape are great partners, as they can threaten special walls like Blissey and Alolan Muk that halt any attempt at a Cofagrigus sweep while also checking Dark-types. Physical wallbreakers such as Terrakion and Crawdaunt can break through special walls to aid Cofagrigus in cleaning later on. Klefki can check Dark-types and set up Spikes to whittle down the opposing team; in return, Cofagrigus can block Rapid Spin attempts and pivot out. Blissey lures like Superpower Nidoking and Block Slowbro are much appreciated, as they can potentially eliminate one of Cofagrigus's most sturdy counters. Choice Scarf Hydreigon lures in the special walls that Cofagrigus hates so that the team's physical attackers can break past them; Hydreigon also lures opposing Draco Meteors, often presenting Cofagrigus with setup opportunities. Other U-turn users such as Gligar and Scizor can provide Cofagrigus with free switches into favorable positions, potentially leading to a sweep. Stealth Rock setters like Empoleon and Nihilego help ensure Cofagrigus OHKOs on Hydreigon and Krookodile with +2 Hidden Power Fighting, often providing the small amount of chip damage necessary to do so. Entry hazards can hinder Cofagrigus's ability to set up by whittling it down over time, so hazard removal options such as Tentacruel and Hydreigon pair nicely.</p>"

In addition, Zoroark sits at an unfortunate Speed tier where prevalent Pokemon like Cobalion, Terrakion, and Latias can easily revenge kill it.

Access to a strong STAB Psyshock grants Reuniclus the ability to win most Calm Mind wars and beat specially defensive walls such as Blissey easily; access to Focus Blast lets it take on common Dark-type switch-ins, such as Hydreigon, Bisharp, and Krookodile. A low Speed stat, high base Special Attack stat, unresisted coverage, and access to Trick Room also allow Reuniclus to function not only as a great Trick Room wallbreaker. However, said Speed stat means that under normal circumstances, Reuniclus will have to almost always take a hit or be shut down by either Taunt or Trick before boosting or attacking, leaving it vulnerable to strong wallbreakers, such as Choice Specs Hydreigon, and Taunt or Trick users, such as Krookodile and Togekiss. Furthermore, despite its respectable bulk, Reuniclus possesses only two resistances and has common weaknesses in Dark and Bug. As a result, Reuniclus is deterred by the presence of Pokemon like Hydreigon and Scizor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball allows Reuniclus to hit Quagsire and Krookodile for super effective damage. Psychium Z gives Reuniclus a powerful Shattered Psyche to break past Pokemon like Hippowdon and Amoonguss easier and if used in conjunction with Energy Ball then it allows it to do significant damage to Steel-types like Scizor. Shadow Ball on the Calm Mind set grants Reuniclus a way of hitting Psychic- and Ghost-types on the switch, such as Latias and Chandelure. Acid Armor allows Reuniclus to boost its Defense alongside its Special Defense, making it even harder to break, although this comes at the cost of an important coverage move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-type Pokemon, such as Krookodile and Hydreigon, are immune to Reuniclus's STAB move and threaten it out with a powerful Dark-type attack. Alolan Muk deserves a special mention because it can switch in on any of Reuniclus's moves and potentially Pursuit trap it.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types</strong>: Bug-type Pokemon, such as Scizor and Mega Beedrill, threaten Reuniclus with a potential U-turn, forcing it out while also keeping momentum. Both can potentially Pursuit trap Reuniclus as well.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types, such as Mimikyu, Doublade, and Gengar scare out Reuniclus with a powerful STAB move. However, they can't switch into Reuniclus comfortably, as it might carry Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Walls</strong>: Unaware walls, such as Quagsire and Pyukumuku, can reliably stall Reuniclus out of PP. Pyukumuku, with Spite, can easily stall it. However, both find it hard switching into Life Orb-boosted Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls, such as Blissey, can reliably take on Reuniclus, taking any hit and wearing it down with Seismic Toss.

      "Defensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind boosts Reuniclus's Special Attack and Special Defense, amplifying its offensive presence while also making it difficult for the foe to revenge kill it. Psyshock is Reuniclus's main STAB attack, which allows it to not only win most Calm Mind wars against Pokemon such as Suicune but also break special walls, such as Blissey, more easily. Focus Blast is Reuniclus's best way of breaking through Dark-types, such as Krookodile and Hydreigon, and Steel-types, such as Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix, the former of which may force it out with Roar. Recover is reliable and instant recovery, which helps Reuniclus remain healthy for long periods of time.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fightinium Z with 44 Speed EVs allows Reuniclus to outspeed uninvested Quagsire and gives Reuniclus a chance to beat it after some chip damage. It also allows Reuniclus to grab some initial damage on Scizor, take less damage from Knock Off, remove the drawback of Focus Blast missing, and be immune to Trick. 252 HP and 212 Defense EVs maximize Reuniclus's physical bulk, as Reuniclus is almost always going to have to take a hit before moving. Alternatively, Leftovers provides Reuniclus with passive recovery, which helps its longevity. Magic Guard blocks passive damage caused by Toxic, Leech Seed, and entry hazards, giving Reuniclus better chances at sweeping.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid setting up with Reuniclus until late-game; wait until Reuniclus's checks are weakened enough. Focus Blast is best used early- and mid-game to lure certain Dark-type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Krookodile that may attempt to switch in to prevent Reuniclus from setting up further. Set up with Reuniclus on passive Pokemon, such as Blissey and Alomomola, attackers and pivots that Reuniclus isn't 2HKOed by, such as Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Infernape and Latias. Be wary of Trick users, such as Latias, as they may shut down Reuniclus by giving it a Choice item if running Leftovers.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Spikes setters, such as Tentacruel and Nidoqueen, help Reuniclus by wearing down opposing Dark-types, opposing Calm Mind users, and opposing Unaware users. Likewise, other entry hazard users such as Empoleon, Hippowdon, Klefki, and Mega Aggron make great partners to wear down its checks. Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Cobalion and Infernape, make great partners for their ability to reliably check Dark-types for Reuniclus as well as checking non-Superpower Scizor, the former being able to punish it with Rocky Helmet. Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Gligar check Bug-type Pokemon and thus make for great partners with Reuniclus. Magneton makes for a great partner thanks to its ability to trap troublesome Steel-types like Scizor. Fairy-type Pokemon, such as Mega Altaria and Primarina, work well with Reuniclus because they beat Dark-types that prevent Reuniclus from sweeping. Mega Altaria specifically lures in and removes Scizor with Fire Blast. If Reuniclus is running Focus Blast, Pursuit trappers, such as Krookodile, make great partners because they can trap troublesome Pokemon, such as Gengar and Latias. Wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Terrakion are good partners for Reuniclus, as they help pressure the Psychic ans Steel-types that Reuniclus can have issues breaking through without multiple boosts.</p>"

      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Psychic is Reuniclus's main STAB move that hits most Pokemon that do not resist Psychic-type moves hard, such as Mega Altaria and Mega Aerodactyl. Alternatively, Psyshock hits specially bulky walls, such as Blissey, harder. Shadow Ball lets Reuniclus hit Pokemon like Latias and Celebi for super effective damage. Focus Blast lets Reuniclus hit Steel-types, such as Empoleon and Mega Aggron, super effectively. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Scizor and Klefki for super effective damage, but the drop in power and loss of option to hit Empoleon super effectively is crucial. Trick Room takes advantage of Reuniclus's low Speed, drastically helping its matchup against offensive teams. Trick Room enhances Reuniclus's matchup against offensive teams by making it a fearsome wallbreaker that is usually the fastest on the field.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The EV spread focuses on maximizing bulk and power simultaneously. A Quiet nature with 0 Speed IVs makes sure Reuniclus outspeeds Amoonguss and Gyro Ball Doublade while Trick Room is active. Magic Guard ignores recoil from Life Orb and makes Reuniclus immune to residual damage caused by entry hazards, Toxic, and Leech Seed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Usually, send out Reuniclus late-game when all its checks and counters are weakened. Despite its good bulk, it will most likely only get one chance to set up Trick Room against offensive teams. This is why, as it is sent out, it should set up Trick Room as soon as it enters the field. Reuniclus should be setting up Trick Room on Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Cobalion, and passive Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Quagsire.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support is really beneficial for Reuniclus because, after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, it usually 2HKOes Blissey with Focus Blast. Hence, hazard support from the likes of Klefki and Gligar is appreciated. Fairy-type Pokemon, such as Sylveon and Mega Altaria, make for good partners because they cover up Reuniclus's weakness to Dark and Bug. While not necessary, Pokemon that can take advantage of Trick Room, such as Crawdaunt, make good partners. Pivots, such as Mega Manectric and Scizor, can bring in Reuniclus safely with Volt Switch or U-turn. Wallbreakers such as Mamoswine and Terrakion make great partners to remove bulkier Pokemon like Blissey for it to sweep. Mamoswine is also able to revenge kill Latias and Hydreigon that prove to be troublesome for Reuniclus, the latter especially if Trick Room hasn't been set up.</p>"

Key resistances to Grass, Electric, Water, Fairy, and Fighting enable it to check a large number of threats such as Primarina, Mega Altaria, and Zeraora, giving it a place on many balanced and bulky offensive teams. Amoonguss is able to do this reliably because of Regenerator, which gives it one-third of its maximum health upon switching out, making it hard to wear down. Another fantastic trait of Amoonguss is Spore, which lets it inflict guaranteed sleep on non-Grass-types. Despite Amoonguss's strengths, however, it possesses crippling weaknesses to Ice, Fire, Psychic, and Flying, which is amplified by the strong presence of Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mamoswine, Moltres, and Latias. Amoonguss is also very passive because of its pitiful Speed stat and low offenses, which can make it setup fodder after Spore's been used.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Seed Bomb is an option to get past Calm Mind users such as Suicune. Synthesis is also an option for reliable recovery on teams that are particularly weak to Primarina and want Amoonguss to always be able to answer it. Eject Button is an option, alongside Magneton, to trap and eliminate Scizor while giving Pokemon such as Mega Absol free switches.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Volcanion, Infernape, and Moltres don't care much about any of Amoonguss's attacks and can hit it very hard with super effective Fire-type moves, but none can switch into Spore without being put to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Latias, Reuniclus, and Celebi don't care much for what Amoonguss can go for, with the exception of Sludge Bomb in Celebi's case and Spore in Latias's and Reuniclus's case.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Pidgeot, Crobat, and Togekiss can all force Amoonguss out with super effective Flying-type moves, but Togekiss doesn't like Sludge Bomb, and all can be hit by Spore. Although it's uncommon, Mandibuzz gets a special mention, as it's immune to Spore thanks to Overcoat and takes very little from any other move Amoonguss can go for.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers such as Choice Band Terrakion, Choice Specs Hydreigon, and Mamoswine can do huge damage to Amoonguss.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Cobalion is immune to Clear Smog, takes little from Hidden Power Fire, and can do huge damage back with a boosted Iron Head.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spore is one of the main reasons to use Amoonguss, putting anything that isn't a Grass-type to sleep. Giga Drain is a consistent STAB move that also gets Amoonguss some health back. Hidden Power Fire is used to hit Steel-types such as Scizor and Cobalion, which otherwise completely wall Amoonguss. Sludge Bomb hits Celebi, Togekiss, and Primarina for more damage, the former two of which otherwise use Amoonguss as setup fodder. Stun Spore can be used to paralyze an unsuspecting foe that thinks it's safe after Spore's been used. Another option is Foul Play, which can hit Pokemon such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl pretty hard.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs and 80 Special Defense EVs allow Amoonguss to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Primarina's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock and guarantee that it survives Mega Manectric's Overheat after Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs, alongside a Bold nature, are placed in Defense to allow Amoonguss to take physical attacks more easily. However, a Calm nature can be used to always survive Psychic from Choice Specs Primarina after Stealth Rock at the cost of some physical bulk. Regenerator allows Amoonguss to consistently check special attackers such as Primarina and Rotom-C. Rocky Helmet allows Amoonguss to wear down U-turn users like Scizor and Hydreigon, but Black Sludge can also be used for extra longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Amoonguss into the Pokemon that it checks, such as Primarina, Mega Altaria, and Mega Blastoise, but be wary of coverage options. Spore is often a good move to go for to put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, but refrain from using it too early on so that you can put something more important to sleep later. Utilize Regenerator a lot so that you keep Amoonguss as high on health as possible, because Amoonguss needs to be at high HP to check Primarina, Zeraora, and Mega Altaria.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Water-types such as Alomomola, Slowbro, Suicune, and Volcanion work well with Amoonguss, as they can check Fire-types while Amoonguss checks Grass- and Electric-types. Alomomola and Slowbro form a solid Regenerator core with Amoonguss, as they can check many of the physical attackers that can break past it. Entry hazard removers such as Latias and Scizor are also appreciated, as not having to take the chip damage is ideal to handle the special attackers that Amoonguss checks. Latias and Starmie make for good picks, as they both resist Fire. Pursuit trappers such as Scizor, Krookodile, and Mega Aerodactyl can make for good teammates, as they can remove the Psychic-types that threaten Amoonguss. Pokemon that appreciate the setup opportunities that Amoonguss gives with Spore, such as Swords Dance Cobalion, Calm Mind Latias, and Swords Dance Terrakion, pair well with it. Steel-types such as Cobalion, Scizor, and Klefki can also patch up Amoonguss's Ice and Psychic weaknesses, but they do share a weakness in Fire. If running Stun Spore, teammates that appreciate Latias being paralyzed, such as Nidoking, make for good teammates.</p>"

Water Absorb allows Jellicent to pivot in on a large range of Water-type Pokemon, such as Tentacruel and Volcanion. Despite that, Jellicent's weakness to Dark leaves it with a crippling weakness to Pursuit, Knock Off, and Dark-type moves in general from Pokemon like Krookodile, Hydreigon, Scizor, and Bisharp. In addition, the popularity of VoltTurn-based teams, combined with Jellicent's weakness to Volt Switch users, such as Rotom-C and Mega Manectric, is detrimental for it. Jellicent's Speed doesn't help it either; it is a bit slow and, as a result, is shut down by faster Taunt users, such as Krookodile. With investment, however, it can still outspeed and Taunt many defensive threats, such as Alomomola and Blissey.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dazzling Gleam with Fairium Z allows Jellicent to take less damage from Knock Off, be immune to Trick, and lure and severely damage Dark-type Pokemon, such as Hydreigon and Krookodile.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types, such as Celebi, Amoonguss, Rotom-C, and Mega Sceptile, pose a threat to Jellicent, as they resist Scald and can retaliate with their STAB moves. Celebi deserves a special mention, as it doesn't mind getting burned thanks to Natural Cure, although it must be wary of Hex.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Rotom-C, Mega Manectric, and Zeraora threaten Jellicent with Electric-type STAB moves. The former two can take advantage of Jellicent by using Volt Switch to keep momentum, and the latter can set up either a Substitute or a Calm Mind on it. The latter two, however, don't appreciate switching in on a Scald or a boosted Hex from Jellicent.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Jellicent hates residual damage, mainly damage from Toxic and entry hazards, as they give Jellicent a harder time checking what it is supposed to check, thus giving the opponent an easier time wearing it down.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Krookodile, Alolan Muk, and Bisharp threaten Jellicent out and force mind games between Knock Off and Pursuit, though they can't directly switch in on Jellicent, as they fear getting burned by Will-O-Wisp or Scald. Hydreigon can come in on any of Jellicent's moves without fearing getting burned that much and launch a powerful attack, and Mega Absol can bounce back Will-O-Wisp via Magic Bounce.</p> <p><strong>Status-resistant Attackers</strong>: Status-resistant attackers, mainly Guts Heracross and Facade Mega Altaria, take advantage of Jellicent's status to power up their attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fast Clerics</strong>: Fast clerics, such as Mega Altaria and Togekiss, undo Jellicent's job of spreading status. Those two also can further take advantage of it by either setting up Dragon Dance or Nasty Plot, respectively.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hex synergizes well with Will-O-Wisp and increases Jellicent's wallbreaking capabilities. It also hits already statused Grass-type Pokemon like Mega Sceptile and Amoonguss that tend to switch on it. Be wary, though, that forgoing Scald means that Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Krookodile are more likely to get a safe switch on a predicted attack without fearing status and can proceed to threaten Jellicent with a Dark-type STAB move. It also makes Jellicent lose a reliable way of hitting Normal-type Pokemon. Scald functions as a spammable STAB move with a chance to burn its target, which deters the majority of physical attackers from switching in. However, using Scald means that most Grass-type Pokemon, such as Mega Sceptile and Celebi, can almost always switch in on Jellicent and proceed to threaten it out with a STAB move, and it's also much weaker against Latias. Taunt allows Jellicent to cripple slower passive Pokemon, such as Blissey, Empoleon, and Alomomola. Will-O-Wisp lets Jellicent cripple physical attackers, such as Scizor and Cobalion, and Pokemon that rely on Leftovers or Black Sludge, such as Alomomola and Amoonguss. It also eases Jellicent's matchup against Pursuit trappers, such as Krookodile and Alolan Muk. Recover is mandatory, as it lets Jellicent heal itself and continually check the Pokemon it is meant to check. Toxic is an option over Will-O-Wisp that puts Pokemon such as Blissey and Alomomola on a timer and provides an easier matchup against more defensive builds. However, this option leaves Jellicent weaker to physical attackers that may overpower it, such as Mamoswine and Terrakion, and it also takes away the option to reliably burn Steel-types, such as Scizor and Cobalion. Therefore, it's often best to use Scald when using Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP EVs and 212 Defense EVs with a Bold nature maximize Jellicent's defensive capabilities and allow it to check strong physical attackers, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Infernape, and Scizor. 44 EVs in Speed allow Jellicent to outspeed uninvested Scizor and Alomomola and proceed to either status them or shut them down with Taunt. Water Absorb grants Jellicent a third immunity, which allows it to pivot on Water-type Pokemon such as Empoleon and Swampert more effectively. Leftovers increases Jellicent's longevity through passive recovery. Colbur Berry could be used over Leftovers, as it helps Jellicent against opposing Dark-type Pokemon that carry Knock Off and Pursuit and retaliate with a Will-O-Wisp; however, it makes Jellicent more vulnerable to VoltTurn-based teams and entry hazards in general, as it negates its passive recovery.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch in Jellicent on physical attackers it is designed to beat, such as Scizor, Mega Aerodactyl, and Cobalion. Use Taunt against slower Pokemon that may try to beat Jellicent by crippling it with status or take advantage of it to set up hazards, such as Blissey and Alomomola. Its immunity to Water-type moves also allows Jellicent to switch in to opposing Water-types, such as Tentacruel, Alomomola, and Starmie, but you should be wary of Toxic from the former two and Thunderbolt from the latter. Take advantage of Jellicent's Ghost typing to spinblock effectively by pivoting into Rapid Spin users, such as Tentacruel and Starmie. Afterwards, afflicting the foe with status or double switching to a Pokemon that threatens out the aforementioned spinblockers are both great plays. Thanks to its naturally high Special Defense, Jellicent can switch in on weak or neutral special hits, such as defensive Sylveon's Hyper Voice and Volcanion's Earth Power. Jellicent is a huge threat to defensive teams if played correctly, as it can spam Taunt against them and continually chip slower Pokemon. Keep in mind that Jellicent's low Speed means that it often has to tank two hits when switching in. It can be worn down by Scizor and Cobalion repetitively using U-turn or Volt Switch, respectively, on Jellicent's switch-in to them, especially if Jellicent holds a Colbur Berry and not Leftovers. While it has access to reliable recovery, it is important to keep it away from status, especially Toxic, so it can continually tank hits and stallbreak must be played around, as they can cripple Jellicent by giving it a Choice item.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Jellicent should be used on more balanced and defensive teams and some bulky offense teams. Teams that are weak to physical attackers, such as Scizor, Cobalion, and Infernape, and need spinblocking support appreciate Jellicent a lot. Entry hazard setters, such as Klefki, Hippowdon, and Cobalion, appreciate Jellicent's ability to keep their hazards up. Hippowdon deserves a special mention, as it has a great defensive synergy with Jellicent; it can beat Electric-type Pokemon, which Jellicent struggles against, and Jellicent can beat Water-type Pokemon, which Hippowdon has trouble with. Due to Jellicent's susceptibility to Pursuit trappers, such as Krookodile and Alolan Muk, Pokemon that take on those, such as Togekiss and Krookodile, respectively, make good partners for it. Clerics and status absorbers such as Mega Altaria and Blissey synergize well with Jellicent, as Jellicent can be quite easily crippled by status. Jellicent works well with Toxic Spikes users, such as Tentacruel, Nidoqueen, and Nihilego, as it can take advantage of Toxic Spikes to automatically power up Hex on grounded targets. Since Jellicent will repetitively switch in on physical attackers, entry hazard removers such as Tentacruel and Latias can prevent Jellicent from taking any unnecessary residual damage.</p>"

  "Alomomola": {
    "overview": "<p>Alomomola has a great defensive typing, a huge HP stat, and a solid Defense stat, which allow it to blanket check a huge portion of the physically based metagame, including huge threats such as Infernape, Mega Sharpedo, and Cobalion. Its access to Wish provides great team utility and gives it a means of reliable recovery at the same time. Regenerator allows Alomomola to easily pivot in and out of the physical attackers it checks throughout a match. These traits allow it to fit comfortably on stall and balanced teams as a premier Wish passer that can blanket check many Pokemon. However, Alomomola is a pretty passive Pokemon because of its low offensive stats, meaning it can be turned into setup fodder by Pokemon that it cannot threaten, like Celebi, and Substitute users, such as Gengar and Kyurem. Its low Special Defense stat also means that it can be taken advantage of by special attackers such as Primarina and Hydreigon. While it only has two weaknesses, Pokemon that threaten Alomomola such as Rotom-H and Amoonguss see high usage. Alomomola is also very susceptible to Toxic Spikes and other entry hazards, which require removal if Alomomola wants to avoid the 2HKO from most of the attackers it checks. While very bulky, Alomomola is not bulky enough to take on extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Terrakion and Crawdaunt, which are big threats to balance and stall teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Healing Wish is a valid option on any bulky offensive team, as it can heal up Pokemon such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Manectric.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Special attackers such as Hydreigon, Primarina, and Starmie can deal heavy damage to Alomomola by taking advantage of its lower Special Defense stat and dealing heavy damage with a STAB or coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Mega Sceptile, Amoonguss, and Celebi can force Alomomola out with the threat of an OHKO; Celebi and Amoonguss in particular do not mind Toxic thanks to Natural Cure and a Poison typing, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Rotom-C can use Volt Switch to gain momentum or just OHKO Alomomola with Thunderbolt, but none like Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Status ailments such as Toxic poison and burn hinder Alomomola's ability to act as a wall, as it cannot perform its role on a team properly when taking too much chip damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Wish heals not only Alomomola but also its teammates. Protect ensures that Alomomola receives its Wish and lets it scout for common Choice item users such as Hydreigon. Toxic allows Alomomola to stall out the attackers it checks with Wish and Protect. Scald is the primary option in the fourth slot, as it can burn physical attackers such as Scizor and Cobalion. Knock Off is also an option in either the Toxic or Scald slot to remove items such as Amoonguss's Black Sludge and Klefki's Leftovers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread with a Bold nature is the best possible spread Alomomola can use, as it maximizes Alomomola's overall bulk. If Alomomola is only running Knock Off, then Impish is the preferred nature. Regenerator is by far the best ability Alomomola can use, giving it one-third of its health back every time it switches in and out, allowing it to pivot in and out of the attackers it checks. Leftovers is used to give Alomomola more passive recovery and helps with potential status ailments such as Toxic poison and burns. Rocky Helmet is an option as well to wear down physical attackers and U-turn users because Alomomola can still get passive recovery from Regenerator, but it leaves Alomomola significantly more vulnerable to residual damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Alomomola completely walls physical attackers such as Mega Sharpedo and Choice Band Scizor, so it's best to switch into them and start spreading Toxic poison as much as possible. Don't switch Alomomola into Pokemon such as Crawdaunt and Terrakion until their set has been scouted, as these Pokemon possess the ability to OHKO or heavily damage Alomomola at +2 with potential Z-Moves. Make sure to clear all entry hazards before pivoting Alomomola into a physical attacker, since, with multiple layers of Spikes and Stealth Rock up, it is often 2HKOed. Make sure that Alomomola cannot be 2HKOed by what it is switching into, especially when using Rocky Helmet. Alomomola should also focus on keeping its team healthy with its huge Wishes, so whenever a Pokemon is low on health, try to heal it back up. Against non-setup sweepers, Alomomola can be used as a scout to reveal potential Choice item users because of Regenerator, as it can pivot in and out of them without fearing being worn down. Be careful using Scald if the enemy team has a Mega Altaria, as a Scald burn could power up Facade and allow Mega Altaria to break through your team more easily.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>It should be noted that Alomomola fits best on stall and balance teams. Blissey is one of Alomomola's best partners because it blanket checks most special attackers in UU, while Alomomola blanket checks most physical attackers. The two form a rock-solid defensive core that is very hard to break. Clerics are also nice to have on a team with Alomomola, since Toxic puts it on an uncomfortable timer and can prevent it from walling Pokemon late-game. Mega Altaria and Blissey can fill this role well on stall teams. Quagsire is another good partner for Alomomola because, with Unaware, it is able to check setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Terrakion, Swords Dance Cobalion, and certain Crawdaunt sets, and Alomomola helps out by being able to pass a Wish to Quagsire so it avoids the 2HKO from said Pokemon, although this does stack a Grass-type weakness. Entry hazard removers such as Latias, Moltres, and Tentacruel are almost mandatory because Alomomola detests Toxic Spikes and any other entry hazard that can wear it down. Grass-type checks are nice because Grass-types take advantage of Alomomola pretty well. Togekiss checks Amoonguss, while Latias can check Celebi and Amoonguss as well. Electric-type checks such as the aforementioned Quagsire and Latias are also appreciated.</p>"

  "Ferroseed": {
    "overview": "<p>A good defensive typing and above average bulk when holding Eviolite give Ferroseed a small niche as a check to prominent threats such as Primarina, Latias, Grassium Z Celebi, and Mega Altaria as well as a setter of Stealth Rock or Spikes. Additionally, Iron Barbs is a good situational ability, giving Ferroseed the ability to punish certain physical attackers such as Mimikyu and spinners like Starmie. Moreover, Ferroseed can use its ability along with moves like Leech Seed and Toxic to reliably rack up chip damage on opposing teams. However, Ferroseed's reliance on Eviolite means the omnipresent Knock Off and the less common Trick from Pokemon like Bisharp and Togekiss must always be accounted for. Ferroseed additionally has a subpar matchup against common entry hazard removers like Rotom-H and Gligar, and its weaknesses to Fighting- and Fire-type moves leave it forced out by common threats like Moltres and Terrakion and susceptible to coverage moves on the Pokemon it is supposed to check like Fire Blast on Mega Altaria. This is further compounded by Ferroseed's lacking damage output, making it vulnerable to common Taunt users such as Hydreigon and Krookodile and common setup users like Cobalion. Ferroseed also faces competition from other defensive Grass-types like Amoonguss and Chesnaught, as they have more reliable forms of recovery and check more threats. Roserade and Chesnaught in particular can set Spikes like Ferroseed. Finally, Ferroseed's lack of reliable recovery outside of Leech Seed often leaves it easily worn down, hampering its ability to check the threats it's supposed to check, especially if there is an opposing Grass-type to potentially absorb Leech Seed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Knock Off is a plausible option in the fourth moveslot to remove items from switch-ins, but it does not provide enough utility compared to the moves listed on the set. Similarly, Thunder Wave is an option over Toxic, but being left completely susceptible to threats like Rotom-H and Krookodile is inadvisable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Knock Off and Trick Users</strong>: Ferroseed's reliance on Eviolite for a significant portion of its bulk means that Knock Off and Trick users like Krookodile, Tentacruel, and Latias can severely cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Infernape and Rotom-H shrug off anything Ferroseed can throw at them and force it out with the threat of their STAB moves. Defog Moltres and Rotom-H in particular are extraordinarily troublesome, as they can easily Defog away any entry hazards set by Ferroseed, but they should still watch out for Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Fighting-types like Terrakion and Bewear can easily come in on Ferroseed and OHKO it. Additionally, these threats often have setup moves, punishing Ferroseed for coming out in the first place, although the former should be mindful of Gyro Ball. Lucario and Cobalion in particular are immune to Toxic, making them especially notable checks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Ferroseed's reliance on Leech Seed means Grass-types like Chesnaught, Amoonguss, and Tsareena can easily come in on it and prevent it from recovering health. Roserade in particular can come in on most of its moves and force it out with the threat of Hidden Power Fire, even though it must watch out for Gyro Ball. Ferroseed's poor matchup against opposing Grass-types is further exacerbated by the fact that Chesnaught and Roserade can use Ferroseed to get a free turn to set Spikes as it switches out, while Tsareena can remove any entry hazards set by Ferroseed with Rapid Spin.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Steelix and Bisharp can easily come in on Ferroseed due to their immunity to Toxic and resistance to Gyro Ball and force it out with their strong physical attacks. Additionally, the likes of Scizor and Doublade can also use Ferroseed as setup fodder, and Roost Scizor in particular does not care about Leech Seed. Magneton is another notable threat, as it essentially comes in for free on Ferroseed, traps it with Magnet Pull, and OHKOes it with Hidden Power Fire. Leech Seed is problematic for all of these Pokemon bar Magneton and Roost Scizor, however, as their lack of recovery can mean the chip damage could leave them in KO range of Ferroseed's teammates later in the match.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup users like Psychium Z Celebi and Suicune can easily use Ferroseed as setup fodder due to its low damage output.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Ferroseed's abysmal Speed and damage output leave it vulnerable to common Taunt users like Cobalion and Krookodile.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Strong wallbreakers like Gengar, Choice Band Crawdaunt, and Life Orb Hydreigon can quite easily muscle past Ferroseed regardless of Eviolite.</p>",

      "Bulky Entry Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock or Spikes is mandatory, giving Ferroseed the ability to utilize its above average bulk to set the entry hazard and support teammates. Gyro Ball is Ferroseed's main attack, taking advantage of its poor Speed stat in order to take on the likes of Mega Altaria and Mega Aerodactyl and discourage prominent threats such as Terrakion and Choice Scarf Hydreigon from directly switching in. Leech Seed is mandatory as Ferroseed's only form of recovery, allowing it to stay healthy over the course of long games. Toxic lets Ferroseed take on Celebi and Latias and also punishes common switch-ins such as Rotom-H, making it the best option in the majority of scenarios. Protect can be useful, however, to scout the likes of Choice Scarf Krookodile and Choice Band Terrakion and gain extra Leech Seed recovery.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Eviolite is mandatory, giving Ferroseed the bulk it needs to take on metagame staples like Primarina. The given HP and Special Defense investment lets Ferroseed avoid a 4HKO from Choice Specs Primarina's Hydro Pump, with the remaining EVs placed into Defense in order to improve its survivability against weaker physical attackers. A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs provide the strongest possible Gyro Ball. Iron Barbs is Ferroseed's only ability, punishing common Rapid Spin users such as Starmie.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Ferroseed's bulk and typing give it good matchups against threats like Primarina and Latias, forcing them to switch out. Use these switches as an opportunity to set entry hazards. However, before sending in Ferroseed, scout for coverage moves such as Hidden Power Fire on Latias and Fire Blast on Mega Altaria. The combination of Gyro Ball and Toxic is nearly mandatory for taking on the likes of Latias, Grassium Z Celebi, and Choice Specs Primarina, so prioritize landing Toxic on these threats before doing anything else. Protect should be used to scout out Knock Off and Trick users like Krookodile and Togekiss, which is important due to Ferroseed's reliance on Eviolite to check foes. It can also help Ferroseed scout for Choice item users with super effective coverage like Choice Scarf Infernape, as well as get a free turn of Leech Seed. Do not let Ferroseed stay in for too long, as its reliance on status moves for damage can often give openings to setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Infernape. If entry hazards are up, however, using Leech Seed is a semi-reliable option to recover HP while also chipping away at switch-ins. Still, Ferroseed's reliance on Leech Seed means one should focus on using it to check only one or two threats at most in order to avoid overstretching your limited resources and losing too much momentum. Lastly, Iron Barbs should be used to deter Rapid Spin as well as punishing weaker U-turns from foes like Gligar and defensive Celebi.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Ferroseed fits best on bulky offense and balance teams looking for an entry hazard setter and answer to common threats like Choice Specs Primarina and Mega Altaria. Knock Off switch-ins are a necessity when using Ferroseed, so Fairy-types like Sylveon and defensive Primarina make for good partners. Sylveon and Florges in particular work well, as they can heal Ferroseed with Wish. Additionally, Heal Bell support from teammates such as Sylveon, Florges, Blissey, and Mega Altaria is helpful to keep Ferroseed healthy throughout a match. Fire- and Fighting-type checks such as Latias and Tentacruel are also necessities when using Ferroseed, as they can take on common switch-ins like Cobalion. Strong wallbreakers that can take advantage of entry hazards set by Ferroseed, like Nidoking, are good complements as well. Hydreigon in particular appreciates Ferroseed checking Fairy-types and Latias for it, making it a good option. Ghost-types like Mimikyu and Gengar can also take advantage of entry hazards while also blocking Rapid Spin from users Ferroseed cannot check safely, like Tentacruel. If using Spikes, an offensive Stealth Rock user is necessary in order to stop Defog and Rapid Spin users from removing entry hazards, as Ferroseed's lackluster matchups versus common removers like Empoleon, Mew, and Tentacruel mean it will struggle to keep Spikes up without support. Krookodile is a good example of this, as it can also use Taunt to prevent the use of Defog. Physical walls like Slowbro form defensive good cores with Ferroseed, as Ferroseed can deal with a lot of threatening special attackers that they cannot, like Primarina and Starmie. Checks to Scizor, like Tentacruel and Rotom-H, are good partners as well. Rock-types such as Terrakion and Rhyperior can take on Rotom-H and free up Ferroseed to run Spikes. Infernape is a very good teammate, taking advantage of the entry hazards set by Ferroseed, while Ferroseed can answer common checks to Infernape like Primarina and Latias.</p>"

  "Chandelure": {
    "overview": "<p>Chandelure's huge Special Attack stat and unique typing allow it to function as a decently versatile offensive threat capable of fulfilling many different roles for a team. By virtue of its immunity to Blissey's Seismic Toss, ability to bypass status with Substitute, and solid STAB coverage, it can take on several defensive teams as a reliable stallbreaker with Calm Mind. Chandelure can also utilize a Choice Scarf to revenge kill several offensive threats, such as Scizor, Celebi, and Latias, thanks to its typing, solid offensive prowess, and ability to cripple some of its switch-ins with Trick. Its typing also has its defensive perks, such as two immunities and a plethora of useful resistances, allowing Chandelure to check various tier staples such as Scizor, Cobalion, and Infernape. However, the benefits of Chandelure's typing can be quite offset by its common weaknesses, such as its vulnerabilities to Pursuit and Stealth Rock, as well as its huge susceptibility to one of the tier's most used Pokemon in Hydreigon. Chandelure is also hurt by its paltry Speed tier, which prevents it from outrunning threats like Terrakion, Krookodile, and Nihilego, as well as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill even with a Choice Scarf. These flaws plague Chandelure with stiff competition from Gengar, another offensive Ghost-type with a much better Speed tier, the coverage necessary to work around Hydreigon and Pursuit trappers, and more overall customizability. Gengar is also much less susceptible to entry hazards due to its Stealth Rock neutrality and ability to absorb Toxic Spikes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast can be used on the Calm Mind set for its ability to more easily break past threats such as Mega Aggron, though compared to Flamethrower's better accuracy and higher PP, which allow Chandelure to more reliably whittle down defensive cores, the advantages are often not worthwhile. Choice Specs puts Chandelure's decent typing and great Special Attack to use by turning it into an extremely powerful wallbreaker. However, Chandelure's exploitable Speed tier and typing often leave it easily taken advantage of if running such a set. Pain Split is an option for further annoying stall teams, though Chandelure often more reliably takes them on with Substitute. If Pain Split is run, however, it could be utilized on 3 attacks, 2 attacks + Substitute, and even Substitute + Calm Mind sets. A set running Will-O-Wisp and Hex allows Chandelure to work around the tier's many Pursuit trappers more easily, though its mediocre Speed prevents it from pulling this set off as well as Gengar most of the time.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Hydreigon</strong>: Hydreigon's typing and decent bulk allow it to comfortably tank any hit Chandelure can throw at it barring the rare Hidden Power Ice, while it can threaten Chandelure with STAB Dark Pulse and use Roost to consistently recover any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers</strong>: Chandelure's typing leaves it susceptible to the majority of the tier's Pursuit trappers. Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile naturally force it out with their typings and can trap it, while Alolan Muk can tank any attack Chandelure can throw at it when equipped with an Assault Vest. Pursuit Bisharp sets have a shakier matchup against Chandelure due to Bisharp's Fire-type weakness, though they can still force mind games due to the threat of Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Chandelure's only decent Speed and fairly exploitable typing mean that faster Pokemon, such as Terrakion, Latias, Nidoking, and Gengar, can all revenge kill it fairly reliably, though Latias will often require Stealth Rock damage to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Chandelure's nasty weakness to Stealth Rock often prevents it from reliably doing its job if it switches in with the entry hazard onto the field. It also doesn't appreciate Toxic, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Blissey, Sylveon, and Florges can all switch into Chandelure's Choice Scarf set without fear of being 2HKOed, though all must be wary of getting nailed by Trick on the switch, and they also don't reliably take on Calm Mind sets. Alolan Muk reliably checks either Chandelure set, though it also must look out for Trick. Nihilego can scout Chandelure's set with Protect, tank any of its attacks, and hit it hard with super effective STAB Power Gem.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Chandelure can struggle to break past the likes of Tentacruel and Suicune, which can both work around its Calm Mind set with Haze and Pressure stalling, respectively. Mega Sharpedo and Crawdaunt can also be bothersome Water-types, being able to tank at least one hit while nailing Chandelure with super effective STAB attacks.</p>",

      "Substitute + Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute can be used on forced switches, such as against Amoonguss or Scizor, to allow Chandelure opportunities to set up or attack. This also protects it from any potential status ailment, which is essential in allowing it to reliably stallbreak. Shadow Ball breaks past foes resistant to Chandelure's Fire-type moves, such as Latias, Slowbro, and Quagsire. Despite Flamethrower's worse damage output than Fire Blast, it is often the safer option due to its better accuracy and reliability against foes like Scizor, Bisharp, and Blissey.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Leftovers lets Chandelure passively restore its health throughout a match, which can allow it to more reliably switch into Pokemon it can check while further improving its stall matchup. It can also be important in allowing Chandelure to use Substitute against defensive teams several times. Ghostium Z is an option for reliably breaking past tankier offensive Pokemon, like Primarina and Moltres, in one hit with a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare. It also allows Chandelure to more reliably defeat neutral targets, such as Gligar and Hippowdon. Flame Body gives Chandelure a chance to burden foes like Cobalion and Scizor with burns as it switches into their resisted attacks. Flash Fire is also an option, however, for allowing Chandelure to completely wall setup Infernape sets while being able to come in on Rotom-H and Choice-locked Moltres more reliably. A bulkier, slower EV spread of 248 HP / 52 Def / 16 SpA / 56 SpD / 136 Spe with a Modest nature and Flame Body can be used to allow Chandelure to stomach some attacks it otherwise couldn't, such as Mega Aerodactyl's Earthquake and Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet, while still outrunning threats like Scizor and Modest Primarina. The extra bulk can also help it more easily set up Substitute and more consistently put Flame Body to use. The main drawback, however, would be its decreased damage output, which would require setup for immediate power.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's best use is as a decent stallbreaker due to Substitute and Chandelure's typing allowing it to put heavy pressure on several defensive builds. Substitute should be used on forced switches, such as against Mega Steelix and Chesnaught, as well as against Pokemon likely to try crippling Chandelure with status ailments, such as Blissey, Amoonguss, and non-Diamond Storm Diancie. If a Pokemon that Chandelure cannot reliably beat one-on-one, such as Primarina or Tentacruel, switches in as it sets its Substitute, it should try wearing them down with Shadow Ball instead of attempting to set up. Against more offensive teams, Chandelure should be preserved for late-game due to its ability to more reliably clean up after the removal of its offensive checks. In early-game situations against these teams, its best bet is often to fire off attacks instead of setting up. In more offensive matchups, Chandelure should also be careful coming in if a Pursuit trapper, like Krookodile or Mega Aerodactyl, is on the other team, as they will be able to easily revenge kill it if it cannot keep a Substitute up. If the bulkier EV spread is being run, it can allow Chandelure to tank one Pursuit as it switches out and potentially burn foes with Flame Body. Against stall teams, however, Chandelure is often free to begin accruing stat boosts due to most defensive foes' inability to break through it before being KOed. However, if a Pokemon like Hydreigon or Tentacruel is on the opposing team, Chandelure should rely on a teammate to remove or sufficiently weaken them in order to more reliably stallbreak without fear of being heavily worn down. Entry hazard support from another teammate can often help accomplish this goal more quickly. By virtue of Chandelure's high Special Attack and typing, it can be quite effective against balanced teams highly reliant on Steel-types like Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Cobalion for defensive utility. In these matchups, Chandelure will often be provided with several opportunities to either use Substitute or fire off an attack to weaken foes. While Chandelure's typing can allow it blanket check Infernape, Cobalion, and Scizor, it should be wary of super effective coverage moves on all three, as the former two sometimes carry Stone Edge and the latter often carries Knock Off.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is a decent fit on bulky offense and balanced teams in need of a serviceable stallbreaker, as Chandelure can often pressure a decent number of stall teams. It's also appreciated for its ability to function as a solid late-game cleaner. Hydreigon is a particularly capable Chandelure check, meaning answers to it like Primarina and Mega Altaria will often be appreciated as teammates. Both Pokemon can also check other Dark-types that Chandelure often fears, such as Mega Sharpedo and Krookodile. Fighting-types like Terrakion and Cobalion can also check Dark-types well, and in return, Chandelure can threaten the Psychic-types they dislike dealing with. Entry hazard removal is essential due to Chandelure's Stealth Rock weakness, making spinners and Defoggers like Tsareena, Starmie, Empoleon, and Gligar worthwhile teammates. Chandelure's poor offensive matchup makes defensive Pokemon capable of checking various portions of the metagame, like Sylveon, Hippowdon, and Mega Slowbro, decent options for teammates on more balanced builds. Revenge killers like Mega Manectric, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and Choice Scarf Nihilego appreciate Chandelure's ability to break past bulkier builds they often can't take on while they can pick off fast offensive threats that force it out in return. Various setup sweepers and cleaners, like Latias and Mega Sharpedo, also appreciate Chandelure's ability to muscle past defensive builds for them to more easily sweep later on.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Fire Blast is Chandelure's strongest Fire-type move, guaranteeing an OHKO on Celebi while dealing more damage to neutral targets, like Nidoking, Kyurem, and Togekiss, than any of Chandelure's other attacks. Trick cripples Chandelure's defensive checks, like Blissey, Swampert, and Florges, as they switch in. Memento can be used after Chandelure has done its job, punishing offensive foes like Hydreigon and Crawdaunt and opening up the door for teammates to potentially sweep. Hidden Power Ice is another option that 2HKOes Hydreigon after Stealth Rock, which otherwise switches in comfortably. It also OHKOes Gligar after minor prior damage. Flamethrower is also an option in the fourth slot, more reliably revenge killing Cobalion and Scizor due to its better accuracy than Fire Blast. However, its lower damage output prevents it from 2HKOing Hippowdon and OHKOing Amoonguss. It also requires more chip damage to power through Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Nidoking. Energy Ball OHKOes Swampert and Seismitoad while hitting other Water-types hard, though it offers generally inferior coverage compared to Chandelure's other attacks.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf enhances Chandelure's Speed, allowing it to outrun and revenge kill several large metagame threats, including Celebi, Cobalion, Gengar, and Latias. Flame Body allows Chandelure to punish physical attackers with potential burns, further aiding it in checking Scizor and Cobalion. Flash Fire can also be used to provide an immunity to Fire-type attacks, notably allowing Chandelure to more easily pivot in on Infernape and Rotom-H.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set aims to revenge kill foes due to Chandelure's boosted Speed. It can often reliably switch in on Infernape, Scizor, Lucario, and Cobalion, though it should be wary of potential super effective coverage moves they can hit it with. Chandelure can also come into play through the support of a pivot, after a teammate has fainted, or on double switches. If Scizor is on the opposing team, preserving Chandelure's HP throughout the match until it can revenge kill Scizor is its best course of action. If a defensive Pokemon capable of tanking Chandelure's hits, like Alomomola or Blissey, is expected to switch in, it should attempt crippling them with Trick. It can more liberally use the move against stall teams specifically, as this set usually doesn't provide much in the defensive matchup. If Chandelure is running Memento, it should use the attack after it's fulfilled its role to provide a teammate with an opportunity to set up. Despite its boosted Speed, Chandelure should look out for especially fast Pokemon still capable of outrunning it, like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Beedrill, as well as faster Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile. Due to this set's good Speed, Chandelure can attempt cleaning up late-game with Shadow Ball once Pokemon resistant to it are removed and the opposing team has been generally weakened. It should make sure it's done its primary job first, though.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well on offensive and balanced teams in need of a revenge killer. Pokemon that appreciate a check to Scizor, like Nihilego and Togekiss, benefit from Chandelure's support. Setup sweepers and cleaners like Terrakion and Mega Sharpedo appreciate Chandelure's ability to pick off opposing fast threats, making their jobs easier. They also enjoy the support it can provide with Memento, allowing them to more easily boost up. Pivots such as Hydreigon, Mega Manectric, and Scizor can bring Chandelure into play to get its job done while also luring in some Pokemon it matches up well against, like Latias and Infernape. Entry hazard removal is crucial for allowing Chandelure to switch in multiple times, making the likes of Empoleon and Tentacruel solid teammates. Due to this set's merely decent power, Chandelure benefits from the support of wallbreakers like Primarina, Bisharp, and Moltres. Chandelure also appreciates Pokemon capable of taking on most Pursuit trappers, like Cobalion and Terrakion, on its team. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Gligar and Cobalion is also beneficial, with Stealth Rock allowing Chandelure to reliably 2HKO Togekiss and Hippowdon with Fire Blast.</p>"

  "Haxorus": {
    "overview": "<p>Haxorus is a solid physical sweeper and wallbreaker in the UU metagame thanks to its superb Attack stat and a powerful STAB move in Outrage, as well as two setup moves in Swords Dance and Dragon Dance. Its typing also grants it good resistances that help it take hits from threats such as Suicune, Rotom-C, and Rotom-H and open up some setup opportunities. Furthermore, a decent physical movepool with coverage such as Earthquake and Poison Jab allows it to go toe-to-toe with Steel- and Fairy-types such as Mega Aggron, Empoleon, and Togekiss, and its ability Mold Breaker helps it to be a stallbreaker, allowing it to set up and bypass the tier's Unaware users in Quagsire and Pyukumuku, stall's normal answers to physical setup sweepers, and giving it an edge over other setup sweepers such as Cobalion. However, Haxorus's Speed tier, while good for outspeeding balance and stall teams, renders it slower than many of UU's faster offensive threats such as Latias, Infernape, and Hydreigon. Its mediocre bulk also hinders it by limiting its ability to set up and leaving it prone to being revenge killed by said faster offensive Pokemon or priority such as Mamoswine's Ice Shard. It faces competition as a Dragon-type from Latias, Hydreigon, and Mega Altaria, all of which offer more utility due to their better bulk, better typings, and stronger coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice item, namely Choice Band or Choice Scarf, could work, but Haxorus is a little too slow to use a Choice Scarf effectively, and it would like to use its coverage effectively to deal with its switch-ins. A Double Dance set with both Dragon Dance and Swords Dance is also a possibility to work against both stall and offense. However, this forces Haxorus to compromise a coverage option, lessening its effectiveness as a wallbreaker or sweeper. Taunt can also be used to disrupt defensive threats such as Alomomola and Blissey, albeit at the expense of potential coverage. Life Orb is also a usable alternative item for Haxorus to give it extra immediate power although Haxorus does not appreciate the recoil damage that cuts into its already limited longevity.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf variants of Hydreigon, Infernape, and Latias can revenge kill Haxorus fairly easy even after a Dragon Dance boost, though they cannot switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Common Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Togekiss can check Haxorus fairly well, as they are immune to Outrage and can OHKO it in return. However, they must be wary of a potential Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Ice Shard Mamoswine, Bullet Punch Scizor, and Sucker Punch Bisharp can pick off Haxorus with just a little prior damage and revenge kill it both before and after a boost.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Scizor, Cobalion, and Klefki resist or are immune to Outrage, and they can either retaliate with a strong STAB move or cripple Haxorus with Thunder Wave. Scizor and Bisharp can also revenge kill a weakened Haxorus with Bullet Punch or Sucker Punch, respectively. Klefki can also use Magnet Rise to make it invulnerable to all of Haxorus's potential moves bar Iron Tail.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Forcing out Haxorus in tandem with entry hazards is useful to wear it down to a point where it can be KOed relatively easily, as well as preventing it from obtaining setup opportunities due to its mediocre bulk or preventing it from pulling off any KOs. Pokemon such as Scizor, Latias, and Mamoswine can force Haxorus out easily.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Haxorus's Attack stat to incredible levels, giving it enough raw firepower to muscle through even the bulkiest of walls, such as Alomomola and Hippowdon. Outrage is a powerful STAB move that deals significant damage to anything that doesn't resist it, especially after a Swords Dance boost. Earthquake allows Haxorus to deal heavy damage to opposing Steel-types, such as Cobalion, Mega Aggron, and even Bronzong thanks to Mold Breaker. Poison Jab serves as a reliable coverage move to hit Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Togekiss that could otherwise switch into Outrage comfortably.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature allow Haxorus to outspeed Suicune and Kyurem, while 252 Attack EVs maximize its damage output. Mold Breaker allows Haxorus to bypass abilities such as Unaware, Filter, and Levitate, making it fare better against threats such as Quagsire and Mega Aggron, while also preventing Bronzong and Latias from freely switching into Earthquake. Dragonium Z gives Haxorus a one-time nuke in Devastating Drake, allowing it to OHKO Alomomola and Hippowdon after a boost and avoid locking itself into Outrage. Lum Berry, on the other hand, allows Haxorus to recover from a status ailment inflicted by a move such as Will-O-Wisp, Scald, or Thunder Wave while setting up or relieve Haxorus of Outrage confusion once after use.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Haxorus functions mainly as a wallbreaker, using its sheer power to muscle through bulkier threats on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams. Ideally, Haxorus should be used mid-game to break down or pressure walls such as Suicune and Hippowdon. It should aim to soften such walls so that other teammates can pull off a sweep late-game. Due to its middling bulk, Haxorus often struggles to find setup opportunities, particularly against faster offensive teams. In those cases, Haxorus can afford to immediately use Devastating Drake or wallbreak with its attacks before going down; since it possesses such a high amount of initial power, it can wallbreak competently without a boost. However, against defensive and balanced teams, Lum Berry Haxorus can try to use a weaker defensive threat such as Blissey or Alomomola as setup fodder to enhance its wallbreaking capabilities.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Haxorus appreciates entry hazard support due to its ability to force switches. Klefki is a very good teammate that can use Spikes to wear down grounded switch-ins and can paralyze faster threats such as Latias and Infernape. Cobalion and Mamoswine also set up hazards very well. VoltTurn users such as Mega Manectric, Scizor, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon steadily wear down the opposing team and help Haxorus switch in safely. Infernape is also a good user of U-turn that can check Scizor. Magneton can be used to trap Scizor and Klefki, which can otherwise check Haxorus. Late-game cleaners such as Scizor and Mega Sharpedo appreciate Haxorus's wallbreaking support and can handle faster offensive teams that Haxorus struggles against. Haxorus appreciates good revenge killers such as Nihilego and Krookodile that can fare well against offensive teams. Entry hazard removal is appreciated, since residual damage cause Haxorus to be easily revenge killed. Starmie, Latias, and Rotom-C make solid candidates; Latias can also heal Haxorus to full health with Healing Wish if the need arises. As a niche option, dual screens support is also very useful for Haxorus, as giving it extra bulk to safely obtain a Swords Dance boost will make it much harder to stop. The aforementioned Klefki is a very good candidates to provide such support.</p>"
      },
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Dragon Dance boosts Haxorus's Attack and Speed stat to high levels, making it a very deadly sweeper that can outspeed most Pokemon after a boost. Outrage serves as a powerful STAB move, 2HKOing or OHKOing the vast majority of the metagame. Earthquake provides coverage for Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, and it can also hit Latias and Hydreigon through Levitate without the need to resort to Outrage. Poison Jab serves as coverage for Fairy-types such as Togekiss and Sylveon, which are immune to Outrage. Iron Tail is a usable alternative over Poison Jab due to its increased power, potentially OHKOing Sylveon and Togekiss after a boost.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in both Attack and Speed along with a Jolly nature maximize Haxorus's initial power and speed. Mold Breaker is Haxorus's most useful ability, giving it an edge against threats such as Rotom-H, Mega Aggron, and Quagsire by bypassing abilities such as Levitate, Filter, and Unaware. Dragonium Z allows Haxorus to have a one-off nuke with Devastating Drake without locking itself into Outrage, allowing it to potentially OHKO Hippowdon and Swampert after a boost. Lum Berry, however, allows Haxorus to absorb a single Thunder Wave from Klefki, absorb a Scald burn, or undo the confusion from Outrage once.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Haxorus can function in two ways: it can sweep late-game with a Dragon Dance boost once its checks, such as Mega Altaria and Scizor, are removed from play, or it can function as a competent wallbreaker and lure mid-game. Since Haxorus struggles to find setup opportunities due to its mediocre bulk and awkward Speed tier, it can be used to lure in its potential checks and wear them down with Earthquake or Poison Jab, and it can use its raw immediate power to muscle through teams, which can help it sweep late-game. It can wallbreak well overall, as it possesses a solid matchup against more defensive teams. If needed, Devastating Drake allows Haxorus to break past Alomomola and Hippowdon after a boost or two without locking itself into Outrage. Devastating Drake is most useful when the raw power is needed but there are still Steel- or Fairy-types on the opposing team to switch into Outrage. Haxorus can find setup opportunities against certain Pokemon such as Tsareena, as well as passive threats such as Blissey. VoltTurn support is also appreciated as a means of helping Haxorus get into battle more safely. Haxorus shouldn't try switching into moves, since doing that will leave it more vulnerable to being revenge killed by priority such as Scizor's Bullet Punch or reasonably strong attacks from faster Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Haxorus works very well on offensive teams as an effective sweeper and wallbreaker, so offensively oriented teammates work best for it. Entry hazard support is very valuable in aiding Haxorus's ability to sweep. Klefki can provide Spikes support as well as paralysis with Thunder Wave, and Cobalion can also be useful as a Stealth Rock setter. VoltTurn users such as Mega Manectric and Scizor can get Haxorus into play more safely, and Scizor is very useful to check Fairy-types such as Togekiss and Mega Altaria. Pokemon that can check Scizor are very useful; Moltres in particular makes a very good teammate that can also check Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Klefki to an extent. Magneton can also work as a means of trapping Scizor. Checks to Fairy-types are also appreciated, since Haxorus fails to OHKO several Fairy-types at +1, so Pokemon such as Scizor are very useful in that regard. Wallbreakers such as Nidoking, Primarina, and Terrakion can wear down Haxorus's checks mid-game to help it sweep late-game. Since Haxorus makes for a fairly competent wallbreaker even without setting up, other cleaners such as Scizor and Mega Sharpedo work well in tandem with Haxorus. Latias can provide Healing Wish support to recover a weakened Haxorus and give it a second shot at sweeping. Since Haxorus isn't particularly bulky and has difficulty setting up, dual screens support is generally useful, which Klefki can provide. Haxorus appreciates entry hazard removal to prevent it from being worn down to a point where it can be revenge killed, so Starmie and Latias make for very useful candidates.</p>"

  "Mienshao": {
    "overview": "<p>Mienshao is a good fast pivot due to its access to U-turn and Knock Off in conjunction with Regenerator and an Assault Vest, allowing it to constantly pivot in and chip foes throughout a game. Furthermore, its high Speed lets it outspeed metagame staples such as Hydreigon, Celebi, and Nihilego, which greatly bolsters its ability as a pivot, and its pure Fighting typing enables Mienshao to check some of the tier's key threats in Hydreigon and Kyurem. Mienshao can also switch into other special attackers more easily due to its resistance to Stealth Rock and its increased special bulk from an Assault Vest. However, its typing also leaves it vulnerable to several key attacking types in Fairy, Flying, and Psychic, and it struggles with foes such as Mega Altaria, Moltres, and Latias as a result. While Mienshao may be able to switch into some special attacks due to its Assault Vest, it has minimal physical bulk, which makes it vulnerable to priority moves from Scizor, Mamoswine, and Crawdaunt and faster physical attackers like Terrakion and Zeraora.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mienshao can opt to run a more offensive set of High Jump Kick / Knock Off / U-turn / Poison Jab with maximum Attack EVs and the Reckless ability combined with a Choice Band, which functions best on Sticky Web teams, but despite its additional power, this directly competes with Terrakion, which is faster and has a secondary STAB option that threatens typical Fighting-resistant foes. The same set can also be run with a Choice Scarf, but it becomes a lot weaker and struggles to compete with Choice Scarf Infernape as a pivot, which has better coverage and secondary STAB options as well. Stone Edge can be run to punish Flying-types, such as Moltres and Togekiss, that otherwise switch into Mienshao for free.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Aside from removing their items and pivoting out of their attacks, Mienshao is left helpless against Pokemon like Primarina, which can fire off a strong attack; Florges, which can remove entry hazards or heal itself and its teammates; and Mega Altaria, which can set up a Dragon Dance or attack.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Moltres, Togekiss, and Crobat resist Mienshao's STAB attack, can switch in without any major issues, and force it out. Mega Aerodactyl struggles to switch in but is faster and can force Mienshao out with potential Flying-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Mienshao is threatened significantly by faster physical attackers it can't effectively pivot out of, such as Terrakion, as well as key priority users, such as Scizor and Crawdaunt.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Due to Mienshao's relative lack of offensive presence, it cannot break through Pokemon such as Alomomola, Hippowdon, and Mega Slowbro, and these Pokemon can all cripple it with some form of status. However, none of these Pokemon appreciate the removal of their items.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>High Jump Kick is run due to its high Base Power, enabling Mienshao to OHKO Hydreigon and Empoleon. Knock Off enables Mienshao to remove the items of its switch-ins such as Amoonguss, Alomomola, and Primarina. U-turn lets Mienshao act as an offensive pivot, which can help it in unfavorable matchups against Pokemon that resist its moves or aren't crippled by Knock Off such as Mega Altaria and Mega Slowbro. Fake Out chips faster foes that threaten to KO Mienshao, such as Mega Beedrill and Infernape, and provides it with a way to pick off extremely weakened sweepers such as Dragon Dance Haxorus. It is also extremely effective at racking up chip damage when stacked with poison or burns.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>100 HP and 156 Special Defense EVs combined with an Assault Vest allow Mienshao to take Devastating Drake or a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor from Hydreigon or a Draco Meteor from +1 Latias. An alternative spread of 132 HP / 136 SpD / 240 Spe hits the same defensive benchmarks while sacrificing some Speed for HP to help in the matchup against physical attackers. Regenerator enables Mienshao to be a consistent pivot throughout a game so it can consistently check Hydreigon and other special attackers.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Mienshao should be used primarily to pivot into special attackers like Hydreigon and Nihilego. It can also be switched into passive Pokemon such as Blissey that it doesn't fear much from; however, it must be wary of status. Once on the field, Mienshao should try to pivot out and generate offensive momentum with U-turn. It can also use U-turn to capitalize on the switches it can force against top-tier Pokemon like Hydreigon and Empoleon. Mienshao should attempt to stay healthy throughout the course of a match to ensure it can consistently check what it needs to. Pivoting or switching it out to recover health with Regenerator after taking an attack helps with this, but it should avoid taking strong attacks unless necessary. If a Pokemon that relies heavily on its item to function, such as Suicune or Choice Specs Primarina, is predicted to switch in, using Knock Off to punish it and thus lessening a threat to Mienshao's teammates is preferred as opposed to switching it out immediately. Against defensive teams, Mienshao functions best as a means to cripple key stall staples and passive Pokemon like Alomomola and Quagsire with the removal of their items, which can make it easier for its more offensive teammates to break through them. Despite Mienshao's lack of offensive investment, it can be used to KO certain frailer offensive threats like Lucario due to its naturally high Attack combined with a high-Base Power STAB move. It must scout for Protect users that can force it to lose 50% of its HP, however, such as Empoleon and Nihilego. Mienshao can be used as an effective switch-in to Volt Switch from Mega Manectric due to its high special bulk and ability to regain HP through Regenerator and pivoting.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mienshao fits best on offensive and bulkier or balanced builds alike that need a fast pivot capable of taking on Dark-types. It pairs extremely well with other Regenerator users, such as Amoonguss and Slowbro, to form a strong Regenerator core that aids and strengthens Mienshao's pivoting ability. These partners can also help Mienshao due to their high physical bulk that enables them to check strong physical attackers like Terrakion for it. Mienshao does not have the offensive presence to be able to break through bulkier teams and cores effectively, so it pairs well with strong wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Choice Specs Primarina, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Choice Band Crawdaunt. In return, it can pivot these slower Pokemon into play without them having to take prior damage. Due to the number of switches forced by Mienshao, entry hazard support helps it further punish opposing switches; Stealth Rock setters such as Mega Steelix, Nihilego, and Nidoqueen make good partners. Additionally, the latter two can set up Toxic Spikes, which pair extremely well with Fake Out from Mienshao. Flying-type checks like Mega Aerodactyl, Rotom-H, and Diancie can patch up Mienshao's weaknesses to key offensive threats in Moltres and Togekiss, and Mienshao can provide pivoting and Knock Off utility for them in return. Mienshao is susceptible to all forms of status, preventing it from performing its role adequately. As a result, clerics such as Florges, Sylveon, and Togekiss make good partners, all of which are also able to deal with strong Fighting-types like Terrakion that threaten Mienshao thanks to their Fairy typing. Mega Altaria is another great partner for this reason, as it can pivot into Scald and status from Pokemon Mienshao cannot threaten such as Swampert and Slowbro and can break through bulkier teams with a boosted Facade as a result. Entry hazards can prevent Mienshao from being able to survive powerful attacks due to the chip damage they provide; thus, pairing it with hazard removal options such as Empoleon, Tentacruel, Volcanion, and Hydreigon is beneficial. Priority moves from the likes of Scizor, Mamoswine, and Crawdaunt can pick off a weakened Mienshao due to its low physical bulk, so pairing it with physically defensive priority checks such as Mega Aggron and Suicune helps alleviate this. Doublade works exceptionally well with Mienshao, as it appreciates Mienshao's ability to check Hydreigon and can pivot into threats such as Terrakion and Scizor in return.</p>"

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Bisharp is one of UU's most capable sweepers and wallbreakers thanks to its solid offensive typing, access to Swords Dance, and excellent Attack stat. Its access to a powerful STAB Sucker Punch allows it to pick off weakened threats while deterring foes' attempts to revenge kill it, limiting some of its offensive counterplay. Bisharp can also muscle through large portions of the defensive metagame thanks to its powerful STAB moves in Knock Off and Iron Head, as well as its ability to use Black Hole Eclipse to take on some of its would-be defensive checks like Hippowdon, Mega Aggron, and Gligar. Furthermore, its ability Defiant allows it to discourage the use of Defog from common entry hazard removers such as Hydreigon and Empoleon. With its unique set of resistances, Bisharp can also pull off an Assault Vest set capable of tanking hits from and Pursuit trapping prominent special attackers like Latias, Celebi, and Nihilego. However, Bisharp's offensive prowess is slightly held back by its defensive drawbacks, such as its middling overall bulk, which prevents it from checking foes like Hydreigon, Latias, and Togekiss as reliably as it'd like to if not running Assault Vest. This is further compounded by the disadvantages of its typing, which include a huge weakness to the tier's several Fighting-types, like Infernape and Cobalion, and weaknesses to other common types in Fire and Ground. Because of its poor Speed, Bisharp can also tend to overrely on Sucker Punch, which, due to the attack's poor reliability, requires that Bisharp predicts carefully when using it so as not to allow foes like Gengar and Moltres to take advantage of it by using Substitute or restoring health, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Steelium Z is an option on the Swords Dance set for allowing Bisharp to break past a few of its otherwise solid defensive checks, such as Chesnaught and Bewear, with a boosted Corkscrew Crash. It can also catch Pokemon like Hydreigon and Krookodile on the switch, reliably KOing them or weakening them into range of Sucker Punch. However, it offers worse overall coverage than Darkinium Z, and most of its would-be targets outspeed Bisharp and KO it as is, requiring that it predicts very carefully. A more offensively inclined Pursuit set with fully invested Speed and Attack EVs with a Dread Plate is an option for giving Bisharp both solid breaking and trapping abilities. Heavily offensive teams appreciate this set due to its ability to keep up momentum more reliably than the listed trapping set. However, the decreased bulk will prevent it from reliably taking on most of the threats it attempts trapping. Low Kick pressures several Pokemon that Bisharp struggles to reliably break past without, such as Cobalion, Mega Steelix, Mega Aggron, and Mega Houndoom, when boosted. It can be put to particularly good use on Sticky Web teams due to Bisharp's ability to outrun Cobalion and Krookodile after their Speed is lowered. Unfortunately, it is often too hard to find room for on a set, must be used on the switch to adequately targets faster than Bisharp, and has a similar boosted damaged output against the aforementioned bulky Steel-types as Black Hole Eclipse.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Bisharp's nasty 4x weakness to Fighting-type attacks allows most Pokemon of the type to deal with it fairly easily. Cobalion, Lucario, and Infernape all resist Bisharp's STAB combination, allowing them to switch in on an unboosted hit at least once to KO it. The latter two also carry STAB Vacuum Wave as priority on their special sets frequently, allowing them to efficiently pick Bisharp off. Chesnaught and Bewear are also particularly good checks, as with its solid bulk, Chesnaught can repeatedly tank hits while KOing Bisharp and restoring its health with Drain Punch, while Fluffy allows Bewear to tank most hits Bisharp can throw at it quite nicely. While Terrakion and Heracross both struggle to come in on Bisharp as reliably, their Sucker Punch resistances allow them to easily revenge kill it with 4x effective STAB attacks once in play.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Hippowdon, Stakataka, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Aggron can all tank at least one hit from Bisharp if it isn't running Darkinium Z, crippling it with status, Earthquake, or possibly Fire Blast in Mega Slowbro's case. Mega Steelix is particularly annoying to deal with, as it can tank a boosted Black Hole Eclipse from full HP while cleanly OHKOing Bisharp with STAB Earthquake. Pokemon with the Unaware ability, like Quagsire and Pyukumuku, are also hard for Bisharp to break past, as they can ignore its stat boosts while hitting it with STAB attacks or stalling it out. Neither appreciates losing Leftovers to Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Although they struggle to deal with Bisharp as reliably when it's boosted, Fire-types like Moltres and Rotom-H can tank at least one hit, outrun Bisharp, and OHKO it with super effective STAB attacks. Infernape and Mega Houndoom are notable in that they both resist Bisharp's STAB combination, allowing them to switch into and revenge kill it even more reliably.</p> <p><strong>Fast Dark-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon resistant to Dark-type attacks can often tank one boosted Sucker Punch and reliably revenge kill Bisharp. Examples include Togekiss running either Flamethrower or Aura Sphere, Mega Altaria, and Terrakion, though all must be wary of switching in directly.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Knock Off is Bisharp's most reliable Dark-type STAB attack and has the added benefit of removing foes' items, which can help set Bisharp up to accumulate boosts due to putting some foes, such as Gligar and Moltres, into situations that may require restoring health or switching back out after being hit on the switch. In addition to covering various Dark-resistant foes, Iron Head can be useful for damaging foes that have already had their items removed or can't have their items removed, as well as giving Bisharp the chance to cause slower Pokemon to flinch. Sucker Punch allows Bisharp to circumvent its low Speed to damage threats faster than it like Moltres, Latias, and Zeraora. However, its reliance on the foe using an attack can make it unreliable at times. If Darkinium Z is activated, Sucker Punch turns into a powerful Black Hole Eclipse, capable of breaking past slower defensive threats like Alomomola, Mega Blastoise, and Hippowdon in one hit.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb is the main option, which greatly boosts the power behind its STAB moves. Alternatively, Dread Plate is an option to boost the power behind the Dark-type moves Bisharp primarily spams without the recoil drawback from Life Orb, but it is worth noting it makes Bisharp more reliant on a Swords Dance boost to deal significant damage with Iron Head. Darkinium Z is another option for allowing Bisharp to more easily break past some of its would-be defensive answers like Gligar, Mega Steelix, and Mega Aggron. An Adamant nature gives Bisharp more breaking power, while a Jolly nature allows it to outrun Modest Volcanion, Adamant Mamoswine, and Bewear in exchange for less power behind its attacks. Defiant allows Bisharp to keep entry hazards on the foe's side of the field by discouraging Pokemon like Empoleon, Gligar, and Hydreigon from using Defog. It also makes Intimidate users like Mega Manectric and Krookodile wary of switching in to revenge kill Bisharp.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bisharp is best used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker in matchups against defensive teams due to its immense power, though it can be used as a late-game cleaner thanks to its powerful STAB priority allowing it to overwhelm several offensive builds after its checks have been weakened. Bisharp can most often find opportunities to set up against Pokemon it forces out of play, such as Latias, Slowbro, Florges, and Celebi. However, since it can't come in on these threats very reliably, it is often best brought in via pivot support or after a teammate has fainted. Knock Off is Bisharp's most spammable STAB attack and should be used liberally early-game due to its ability to adequately chip down several checks and counters. It is also the best Dark-type STAB attack to use against slower or defensive foes due to its better reliability and power than Sucker Punch. Darkinium Z should be activated only with Sucker Punch due to its higher Base Power than Knock Off. Black Hole Eclipse's best use is against defensive threats that could otherwise tank a boosted hit from Bisharp and cripple it, such as Mega Slowbro, Hippowdon, Mega Aggron, and Mega Steelix, though the latter two require a fair amount of chip damage to be KOed. If it wishes to clean up late-game, Pokemon capable of outrunning Bisharp, tanking a boosted Sucker Punch, and KOing it are important to either remove entirely or weaken into range of the attack. Examples include Hydreigon, Togekiss running Flamethrower or Aura Sphere, and Fighting-types like Terrakion and Infernape. Bisharp can try using its Defiant ability to switch into a predicted Defog from an entry hazard remover like Hydreigon, Gligar, Empoleon, or Rotom-C. However, all of these Pokemon are capable of damaging Bisharp a fair amount or crippling it if it mispredicts, while other common Defoggers in Moltres, Volcanion, and Rotom-H are even riskier to switch into due to their ability to OHKO Bisharp with their super effective STAB attacks, making this a high-risk high-reward tactic.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bisharp fits well on all types of offensive teams in need of a wallbreaker or late-game cleaner. It's a particularly good fit on Spikes and Sticky Web-based offenses that utilize entry hazard setters like Froslass, Klefki, and Araquanid, thanks to Defiant allowing it to dissuade Defoggers from removing the entry hazards its teammates have set. Furthermore, Klefki and Araquanid can help Bisharp patch up its poor Speed through the use of Thunder Wave and Sticky Web, respectively. Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego and Krookodile also make good partners, since they can help Bisharp more easily power through foes while Bisharp itself can use Defiant to keep up the entry hazards they set. Fighting-types like Terrakion, Infernape, and Cobalion often make great partners, as they can adequately pressure bulky Steel-types that Bisharp tends to struggle with while it can check Psychic-, Ghost-, and Fairy-types for them in return. Late-game cleaners and sweepers, such as Mega Sharpedo, Mimikyu, and Mega Altaria, appreciate Bisharp's ability to weaken opposing teams for them to finish off more easily if it is being used as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker. If Bisharp would like to sweep itself, it appreciates wallbreakers such as Gengar, Mamoswine, and Nidoking that can weaken teams early for it to more easily power through later on. Sturdy Fighting-type checks are crucial due to Bisharp's vulnerability to most of them, making Primarina, Doublade, and Moltres good options for teammates. Ground-type checks like Togekiss and Celebi and Fire-type checks like Hydreigon and Mega Altaria cover the rest of Bisharp's weaknesses and patch up some of its shakier matchups, such as against Pokemon like Hippowdon and Volcanion. Pivots like Scizor, Rotom-H, and Mega Manectric can safely bring Bisharp into play, circumventing its frailty. Rotom-H can also switch into most Ground- and Fire-types for Bisharp while spreading status across the opposing team. Latias can make for an excellent teammate, covering Bisharp's Fire-, Fighting-, and Ground-type weaknesses while appreciating its ability to take on Fairy-types and opposing Latias well. If running Healing Wish, it can also give Bisharp multiple chances to set up and wallbreak throughout a match.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Pursuit punishes several Pokemon that would try switching out of Bisharp, such as Latias, Starmie, and Gengar, trapping and KOing them. Knock Off is Bisharp's STAB move of choice to use against weakened and slower foes, removing the items of otherwise sturdy switch-ins like Gligar, Hippowdon, and Alomomola. Sucker Punch is important for pressuring faster threats that may try revenge killing Bisharp, such as Mega Manectric, Moltres, and Mega Aerodactyl. Its unreliability is important to note, however.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given Attack investment with an Adamant nature allows Bisharp to KO Latias with Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock and with Pursuit as it switches out, while the given Speed investment allows it to outpace uninvested Mega Altaria. The remaining EVs are invested in HP, which, alongside its Assault Vest, give Bisharp the ability to tank a few special hits to trap Pokemon like Latias and Celebi more easily. Defiant gives Bisharp a +2 boost in Attack when any of its stats are lowered, allowing it to take advantage of Sticky Web, Defog, and Intimidate.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's main goal in a match is to come in on Pokemon Bisharp can force out, such as Latias and Celebi, in order to trap and remove them from play with Pursuit. When utilizing this set, Bisharp should play a more supportive role for its team due to its lack of Swords Dance and the need to preserve its health in order to reliably trap foes. It is important to note that Bisharp forces several mind games with some of its foes. For example, an opposing Gengar may opt to use Focus Blast under the impression that Bisharp will try using Pursuit instead of Sucker Punch, OHKOing Bisharp. Because of this, Bisharp must be played carefully and must always be on the top of its prediction game throughout the course of a match so as not to compromise its longevity. Moves like Will-O-Wisp and Destiny Bond from the likes of Mew and Froslass are also important to scout for, as they can compromise Bisharp's ability to fulfill its role if Sucker Punch is taken advantage of. It's important to note that due to its typing, Bisharp should be wary of mindlessly switching in on special attackers that have ways of hitting it hard still, such as Chandelure or the aforementioned Gengar, despite holding an Assault Vest. When Bisharp has completed its role or the role of a Pursuit trapper is not needed in a certain matchup, it can still use Knock Off and its generally solid offensive presence to weaken opposing teams some while removing their items. Defiant can be used to discourage foes such as Araquanid and Hydreigon from using moves like Sticky Web and Defog, respectively. However, Bisharp must be wary of switching into most foes with these moves, as they can often punish it with powerful attacks or status ailments.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Most Fighting-types appreciate Bisharp's ability to remove Psychic- and Ghost-types from play alongside its ability to weaken Fairy-types. Examples include Terrakion, Cobalion, and Infernape; the latter particularly appreciates the removal of foes such as Latias and Starmie if running Nasty Plot. Entry hazard setters like Nihilego, Swampert, and Klefki can help Bisharp circumvent the slight power issues that may come with this set, and in return, it can discourage Defoggers from removing their hazards with Defiant. Reliable Fighting-type checks, like Slowbro, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel, are important partners due to Bisharp's huge vulnerability to them. Ground-type checks like Latias, Celebi, and Tsareena are also consistently useful partners for Bisharp due to its inability to muscle past Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert with this set. Bisharp's vulnerability to Fire-types makes checks to them, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Suicune, solid options for partners as well. Wallbreakers like Nidoking and Crawdaunt can maintain offensive pressure with the entry hazards Bisharp can keep up well while circumventing its slight lack of wallbreaking prowess. Due to Bisharp's typing making it take neutral damage from Fairy-types like Mega Altaria, Sylveon, and Mimikyu checks capable of pivoting into them such as Scizor and Amoonguss make great partners for Bisharp.</p>"

  "Mandibuzz": {
    "overview": "<p>Mandibuzz is an effective, if somewhat niche utility Pokemon that is capable of keeping a number of both passive and offensive Pokemon at bay with its combination of good bulk, unique defensive typing, and reliable recovery, allowing it to shut down key threats such as Slowbro, Krookodile, and Celebi. This is further augmented by Mandibuzz's high Speed for a defensive Pokemon, which lets it outspeed and annoy slower Pokemon such as Blissey and Alomomola, as well as its access to Taunt and Toxic to shut down passive counterplay, and Overcoat, which makes it immune to sandstorm damage and Spore from Amoonguss. These traits together make Mandibuzz a nuisance to offensive and defensive teams alike, as generally only super effective or boosted neutral hits can break through it reliably, and it can outspeed most defensive Pokemon and Taunt them before it is hit with a status move. This resilience to a unique array of threats is what sets it apart from Togekiss and Moltres, two other Flying-types commonly utilized on balance and bulky offense. That said, Mandibuzz is nevertheless quite easily overwhelmed due to the ubiquity of offensive threats that can easily exploit it, such as Cobalion and Mega Manectric, as well as the bulky Fairy-types found on many defensive teams that can pressure it despite being slower, such as Sylveon and Florges. It is also extremely vulnerable to faster setup sweepers, such as Suicune, Terrakion, and Togekiss, since it cannot Taunt them before they set up. This sheer passivity is why the aforementioned Togekiss and Moltres are generally better options as Flying-types, as these both have top-notch offensive presence to back up their defensive utility. Lastly, Mandibuzz's typing only has a handful of useful resistances and makes it weak to Stealth Rock, which greatly limits the number of threats that it can beat reliably.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rocky Helmet gives Mandibuzz the option to more effectively punish physical attackers alongside Foul Play, but the loss of longevity provided by Leftovers is extremely costly, turning many 3HKOs from the tier's wallbreakers into 2HKOs, and the chip damage provided by both Foul Play and Toxic is generally enough for Mandibuzz to do its job. Mandibuzz is also very prone to having its item removed with Knock Off, thereby nullifying any benefit it might provide. U-turn over Taunt changes Mandibuzz's function from that of a wall to that of a bulky pivot, allowing it to bait in Pokemon such as Sylveon, Cobalion, Primarina, and Togekiss to bring in a teammate that can exploit such threats safely. It is relatively subpar in this role, though, as the lack of Taunt renders Mandibuzz even more passive than normal and forfeits its solid matchup versus bulky teams. Despite Mandibuzz's pitiful Attack stat, it can viably run Brave Bird to prevent it from being setup fodder for Fighting-types such as Heracross and Infernape. It struggles to fit Brave Bird onto its moveset, though, as sacrificing any of Foul Play, Taunt, or Toxic cuts drastically into its role compression and its recoil effect hurts Mandibuzz's longevity somewhat. Mandibuzz can make for an effective user of Defog, since its natural bulk allows it to Defog consistently despite its Stealth Rock weakness, but there are many other Pokemon better suited for this role that, unlike Mandibuzz, are capable of beating the tier's most common hazard setters.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types can come in on Mandibuzz for free due to their generally high bulk and resistance to Foul Play. Klefki, Florges, and Sylveon are all able to fire off free status moves or attacks at Mandibuzz, while Mandibuzz can do little in return. Togekiss and Mega Altaria are particularly dangerous because they can set up on Mandibuzz with impunity. They must be mindful of Toxic if they lack Heal Bell, though.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Outside of Toxic, Mandibuzz has little in the way of consistently threatening the tier's slew of dangerous Fighting-types, meaning that they can come in on Mandibuzz relatively safely and either set up or attack. They also fear little from Foul Play due to their resistance to Dark. Special mention goes to Cobalion, Swords Dance Lucario, and Terrakion, all of which gain an Attack boost via Justified if Mandibuzz goes for Foul Play against them. The former two of these are also immune to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: With the exception of Zeraora, all relevant Electric-types take little damage from Foul Play and can beat Mandibuzz one-on-one by spamming their STAB moves. Mandibuzz is bulky enough, however, to Roost off the damage from a predicted Volt Switch in a pinch, meaning that the momentum gained isn't necessarily free.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Terrakion, Mega Aerodactyl, and Nihilego all threaten Mandibuzz with Stone Edge or Power Gem, with the former two examples targeting Mandibuzz's somewhat lower Defense. Nihilego's low Attack stat means that it takes little damage from Foul Play and consistently switch in and threaten it with a super effective Power Gem or coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Mamoswine, Kyurem, and the rare Mega Glalie all outspeed Mandibuzz and annihilate it with their STAB moves, while Mandibuzz can do virtually nothing in return if they can manage to come in for free against it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Volcanion, Terrakion, and Choice Specs Primarina can overwhelm it with their-high powered STAB moves. Their low Attack stats or, in the case of Terrakion, resistance to Dark mean they also take little damage from Foul Play and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Mandibuzz is heavily reliant on being able to use its own status moves to not be a sitting duck, meaning that it is virtually helpless versus faster Taunt users such as Hydreigon and Mega Houndoom.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All forms of status put a massive damper on Mandibuzz's effectiveness. Burn makes it far more exploitable by halving its already shaky damage output, paralysis greatly increases the number of Pokemon that can outspeed it and beat it down, and Toxic puts it on a timer, preventing it from staying in for an extended period of time.</p>",

      "Utility Birb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Foul Play is Mandibuzz's primary means of dealing damage and punishes strong physical attackers such as Crawdaunt as well as Dark-weak offensive Pokemon such as Gengar, Latias, and Celebi. It also allows Mandibuzz to punish slower physical setup Pokemon such as Scizor. Taunt is key to Mandibuzz's success, as it prevents slower Pokemon from using status moves, allowing it to stop Toxic from Pokemon such as Alomomola and Blissey as well as prevent them from healing. Toxic helps mitigate Mandibuzz's passivity by crippling foes. It is crucial to Mandibuzz's role as a stallbreaker, as it allows Mandibuzz to beat Pokemon such as Alomomola, Slowbro, and Hippowdon one-on-one. Knock Off can be run over Foul Play to cripple foes by removing their items, but it generally does much less damage due to Mandibuzz's miserable offensive stats and should really only be considered if you intend to dedicate Mandibuzz to crippling slower teams. This makes it much more passive, and it becomes setup fodder for much more of the tier.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>248 HP and 124 Special Defense EVs with a Careful ensure Mandibuzz is never OHKOed by +1 Devastating Drake from Latias or Thunderbolt from Mega Manectric, and never 2HKOed by Choice Specs Draco Meteor from Hydreigon or Life Orb Ice Beam from Starmie. 136 Speed EVs give Mandibuzz the jump on maximum Speed Adamant Scizor as well as Jolly Crawdaunt, allowing it to fire off a Foul Play or Toxic before they can go for a strong attack. Overcoat gives it the unique defensive perk of being immune to Amoonguss's Spore as well as sand damage from Hippowdon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful to account for Mandibuzz's extreme passivity in offensive matchups, as giving free turns to Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Cobalion, Primarina, and Togekiss can prove extremely costly to a balance team. Do not carelessly toss it in versus a Scizor with Stealth Rock up, for example. It can come in, however, on a resisted attack from a Pokemon such as Celebi or Krookodile and take that as an opportunity to fire off Toxic or Foul Play. Mandibuzz must be careful to avoid being crippled by Knock Off, too, as losing its Leftovers means it will be 2HKOed by far more threats later on. Due to this passivity, you shouldn't always wait until it is at low HP to use Roost, as this will often lead to it getting KOed before it can move. You should therefore predict when the opponent will attack and use Roost proactively. Thanks to the combination of Taunt, Toxic, and its high Speed for a defensive Pokemon, Mandibuzz can prove a massive headache for defensive teams. Be careful switching it in, though, as it can only do its job with any sort of consistency if it is not statused. Alomomola and Blissey, for example, both almost always carry Toxic, meaning Mandibuzz cannot safely switch in despite beating them one-on-one. Pokemon such as Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Amoonguss are generally safer bets for bringing Mandibuzz in. If the opposing team has any of Swords Dance Lucario, Cobalion, or Terrakion, be cautious when going for Foul Play, as giving them a free Attack boost with Justified would be extremely dangerous.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mandibuzz fits best on bulkier balance, stall, and semi-stall teams in need of a defensive check to offensive Grass-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Psychic-types, as well as a means of pressuring opposing bulky teams. Mega and non-Mega Slowbro both do an excellent job of shutting down most Fighting-types that would otherwise make Mandibuzz a liability thanks to Regenerator and their high Defense. They also provide an effective win condition with Calm Mind to make your team less passive. Hippowdon and Empoleon make for a very potent balance core that shuts down most offensive threats that could take advantage of Mandibuzz such as Primarina and Mega Manectric. This pairing greatly appreciates Mandibuzz's ability to break stall teams and keep Pokemon such as Gengar and Celebi at bay. Clerics are crucial for Mandibuzz to keep up the pressure versus stall and not be crippled by status. Blissey, Florges, and defensive Mega Altaria are all very capable clerics that also have good type synergy with Mandibuzz and the aforementioned Hippowdon + Empoleon core. Hazard removers are a must-have on any bulky team, but this is especially true for teams carrying Mandibuzz due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Empoleon, Tentacruel, Hydreigon, and defensive Mega Altaria are very proficient hazard removers that are generally capable of beating most hazard setters. Bulky Stealth Rock setters such as Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Empoleon are necessary on balance teams to consistently rack up chip damage on Pokemon forced to come in against Mandibuzz on top of being worn down by Taunt and Toxic. These examples also make for excellent answers to Fairy-types, compensating for one of Mandibuzz's biggest defensive shortcomings. Similarly, Spikes setters such as Chesnaught and Klefki turn the matchup versus stall teams further in Mandibuzz's favor by increasing the pressure from entry hazard damage. Chesnaught can also take on select Pokemon that attempt to set up on Mandibuzz, such as Cobalion and Zeraora, while Klefki's defensive typing allows it to check opposing Fairy-types.</p>"

  "Durant": {
    "overview": "<p>On paper, Durant appears to have all the tools to make it a formidable wallbreaker, with good Speed and Attack, access to Hustle, and Hone Claws to boost Attack and make up for the accuracy issues arising from Hustle. Additionally, good coverage combined with a good offensive typing theoretically let it threaten common defensive archetypes relying on traditional Steel-type checks like Cobalion and Rotom-H, setting it apart from Scizor. However, Durant's bad defensive stats and good, but not great, Speed tier leave it vulnerable to faster threats like Mega Manectric and common Choice Scarf users like Togekiss, and it is unable to perform tasks typically assigned to Steel-types, such as being able to pivot into resisted attacks from prominent threats like Celebi. These factors combined with the massive accuracy issues arising from Hustle while unboosted leave it outclassed by other more reliable Steel-type setup users with a better ability to threaten those faster Pokemon with priority, like Scizor and Lucario, or those with more defensive utility, like Cobalion.</p>",
    "sets": {"Hone Claws": {"description": "<p>Durant aims to be used as a wallbreaker that can use its immense power, above average Speed, and good coverage to break past traditional answers to Steel-types like Rotom-H and Doublade after it comes in off a teammate's sacrifice or pivoting move like Volt Switch, which is mandated due to its poor defenses. Scizor simply does this better, though, as more offensive teams can utilize Swords Dance sets instead to pressure the same checks while also dealing with the faster threats such as Choice Scarf Krookodile and Hydreigon much more easily than Durant ever could due to Scizor's strong Bullet Punch. Other options like Mega Steelix and Bisharp are also better than Durant, as they can still wallbreak while being able to switch into and threaten out foes that Durant cannot, like Dragonium Z Latias.</p>"}},

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon is a premier special attacker in UU thanks to its exceptional power and respectable Speed tier. Its spammable STAB combination, great coverage, and access to a few different utility options allow it to viably run a plethora of sets, including Choice Scarf, utility sets with Defog, and a stallbreaking set that utilizes Taunt. Hydreigon also has respectable bulk for an offensive Pokemon, with resistances that allow it to easily take on Pokemon like Chandelure, Mega Houndoom, and Celebi. Moreover, its access to Defog allows it to function as a reliable offensive entry hazard remover that can clear hazards when it forces switches. However, Hydreigon's typing also provides it with weaknesses to common types in Bug, Fighting, and especially Fairy, which can at times limit its opportunities to switch in. Hydreigon is also weak to priority attacks like Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave, which can allow the likes of Infernape and Lucario to pick it off with some prior damage. Lastly, Hydreigon suffers from the presence of faster threats despite its decent Speed tier, meaning that Pokemon such as Latias, Cobalion, and Mega Beedrill can easily outrun non-Choice Scarf sets and force Hydreigon out.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Belch + Poisonium Z is a compelling option for luring in and heavily damaging the majority of defensive Fairy-types, notably OHKOing the likes of Primarina. However, its main problem is its opportunity cost and the general waste of a moveslot once Acid Downpour has been used. While weaker, Steelium Z with Flash Cannon can be run instead for its usability after the Z-Move has been used for its ability to OHKO Mega Aerodactyl and other Rock-types. Earth Power can be used on some sets for its good general coverage against most of the metagame, including Stakataka, Alolan Muk, and Klefki. Unfortunately, all of its targets are already hit quite hard by other coverage moves, and it's a rather poor move for Hydreigon to be locked into.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Klefki resist Hydreigon's STAB attacks and can OHKO it with their STAB attacks. All fear super effective coverage, however. Florges and Primarina are particularly troublesome, as the latter doesn't take super effective damage from any of Hydreigon's coverage options, while the former has enough special bulk to avoid a 2HKO from Life Orb-boosted Flash Cannon.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Cobalion, Infernape, and Terrakion all naturally outspeed Hydreigon and can OHKO it with super effective STAB Close Combat. The latter two can also viably run Choice Scarf sets of their own, which outspeed and OHKO Hydreigon's Choice Scarf set. Infernape even carries priority in the form of STAB Vacuum Wave on its Nasty Plot set, which it can use to take advantage of even Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: While Hydreigon's Speed is above average, it still leaves it outrun by common threats in Latias, Cobalion, and Mega Beedrill, which can all OHKO it with their respective STAB attacks. Faster Choice Scarf users such as Latias and Infernape can outrun even Hydreigon's Choice Scarf set and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with exceptional special bulk are often capable of repeatedly tanking hits from Hydreigon. Examples include Blissey, Alolan Muk, and Empoleon.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Hydreigon's bulk is decent, though it at times isn't enough to fend it off from some of the tier's more powerful priority attacks, which include Infernape and Lucario's Vacuum Wave and Scizor's Bullet Punch, the former being notable for hitting Hydreigon super effectively.</p>",

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's most powerful STAB attack and is useful for revenge killing faster Pokemon like Latias, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Manectric. Dark Pulse is a spammable STAB attack that, in addition to providing good overall coverage, reliably lets Hydreigon revenge kill Pokemon like Celebi, Doublade, and Gengar. U-turn safely pivots Hydreigon out of play while chipping common switch-ins such as Primarina, Mega Altaria, and Blissey. Fire Blast covers Steel-types that otherwise tank Hydreigon's attacks, with some examples being Cobalion, bulky Scizor, and Klefki. Defog is an option that can be run over Fire Blast in order to quickly remove entry hazards on forced switches.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs invested in Speed with a Timid nature give Hydreigon a respectable amount of Speed. A Choice Scarf further adds onto this, turning Hydreigon into a reliable revenge killer and allowing it to outrun the entire unboosted metagame. 252 EVs invested in Special Attack give Hydreigon's attacks a considerable amount of power, especially for a Choice Scarf user. Levitate is the only ability available, but it can be utilized to freely switch into the likes of Swampert and Choice-locked Krookodile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hydreigon's decent defensive typing and bulk allow it to pivot into attacks it resists or is immune to, such as Scald or Psyshock from Mega Slowbro, to then begin forcing switches with its good Speed and power. It should also look to come in through the support of a pivot or as a foe is setting up in order to guarantee a reliable revenge kill. Due to the fact that many of its attacks can be punished when locked into, Hydreigon should carefully predict as it does its job. For example, if Mega Altaria or Togekiss is expected to switch in, pivoting out with U-turn would be optimal, while predicted Steel-type switch-ins such as Cobalion should be nailed with Fire Blast. Hydreigon should also be careful as it uses Draco Meteor due to the potential threat of a Pokemon like Scizor, Mimikyu, or Mega Altaria receiving an easy opportunity to punish Hydreigon and set up, Mimikyu in particular is given an opportunity to boost twice with its Disguise still intact. If running Defog, Hydreigon can use it to clear entry hazards as it forces switches. It can also attempt using the move in emergency situations, such as when entry hazards are on its side of the field and a Pokemon weak to them is desperate for their removal. If opposing offensive teams have been sufficiently weakened, Hydreigon can attempt to use its above average Speed and power to clean up with Dark Pulse.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set's ability to function as a reliable, powerful way to keep faster threats in check allows it to fit very well on offensive teams, in addition to fitting on really any other team archetype other than dedicated stall. Because of this set's lack of Steel-type coverage, Fairy-type checks are fairly important to pair with Hydreigon. Scizor, Mega Steelix, and Stakataka can check Fairy-types for Hydreigon while in return appreciating its ability to switch into Fire- and Ground-type attacks. Fighting-type checks like Doublade, Mega Altaria, and Latias can come in on or offensively pressure a few huge thorns in Hydreigon's side in Terrakion, Mienshao, and Infernape. Physical wallbreakers like Terrakion and Scizor are capable of breaking past the specially bulky Pokemon Hydreigon hates dealing with, thus improving its chances of a potential late-game sweep. Nidoking and Gengar are particularly helpful partners for this set, as they are able to threaten the Fairy-types that wall Hydreigon, Gengar also providing an immunity to the Fighting-type STAB moves that threaten Hydreigon. Through the use of Superpower or Taunt, Nidoking can also break past Blissey, which enables a late-game sweep for Hydreigon.</p>"
      },
      "Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor allows Hydreigon to OHKO threatening Pokemon like Nidoking, Crawdaunt, and Kyurem. Fire Blast can be used as an alternative over Draco Meteor to hit Steel-types like Scizor, Mega Aggron, Bisharp, and Cobalion for a significant amount of damage. Focus Blast should only be used alongside Fightinium Z and can break past Empoleon, which Draco Meteor and Fire Blast can't, while retaining valuable coverage on Steel- and Dark-types.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Levitate strengthens Hydreigon's role as a Defog user by making it immune to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web. Dragonium Z turns Draco Meteor into a powerful nuke that lets Hydreigon beat many Pokemon that don't resist it without dropping Hydreigon's Special Attack, such as Hippowdon, Amoonguss, and Gligar. Dread Plate can be used to power up Dark Pulse, especially if the team already has a Z-Move user. Darkinium Z can be used to give Hydreigon a reliable nuke with good coverage overall that lets it muscle through Steel-types like Mega Aggron more easily. Leftovers is a good alternative on defensive teams that are in need of entry hazard control to help keep Hydreigon healthy throughout.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hydreigon should be pivoted into Pokemon that it can naturally beat due to its typing, such as Krookodile, Mew, and Tentacruel, and utilize these opportunities to remove entry hazards. If using a Z-Move, take care to save it for the appropriate moment. For example, some Stealth Rock users like Hippowdon and Gligar can stall out Hydreigon one-on-one if it has already used its Z-Move, whereas Devastating Drake allows Hydreigon to beat them with a bit of prior damage. Use Dark Pulse liberally throughout the match, as it has limited drawbacks , but be wary of potentially giving Terrakion or Cobalion an Attack boost on the switch. Be cautious of status from Pokemon that Hydreigon tends to pivot into, such as Rotom-H and Mega Slowbro, as a potential poison or paralysis will hinder Hydreigon's job of removing entry hazards. Due to this set's limited attacking moves, Fire Blast and Focus Blast should be used on predicted switches to Steel-types like Mega Aggron, Klefki, and Empoleon to allow Hydreigon to spam Dark Pulse or allow another teammate to potentially clean later on in the match. This set can bluff a Choice Scarf, primarily by spamming Dark Pulse, which can be used to Hydreigon's advantage to catch Pokemon like Krookodile and Empoleon with Dragonium Z or Fightinium Z.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set can be used on a variety of playstyles ranging from bulky offense to stall due to its incredible offensive and defensive utility, so it possesses a wide variety of team options. Fairy-types like Togekiss, Primarina, and Mega Altaria wall this set with ease. As a result, it's vital to have teammates that can pressure them. Some good examples include Cobalion, Rotom-H, and Amoonguss. Pokemon that appreciate entry hazard removal, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Rotom-H, and Moltres, make for good teammates, and these can also pressure Steel-types to make Hydreigon's job easier. Since common Fighting-type Pokemon like Terrakion, Infernape, and Cobalion can all outspeed Hydreigon and OHKO it with their STAB attacks, Gligar, Slowbro, and Nidoqueen are valuable teammates that can counter them as well as wear down Steel-types. Fighting-types possess excellent offensive synergy with Hydreigon thanks to their ability to pressure Steel- and Ground-types as well as break past specially bulky Pokemon. For example, Terrakion and Cobalion can heavily pressure Mega Altaria, Empoleon, and Blissey for Hydreigon, while Hydreigon can pressure physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro and Hippowdon. Scizor and Mega Aerodactyl make for good teammates because they can utilize their ability as physical breakers to weaken special walls for Hydreigon. Moreover, both can trap Latias with Pursuit, which can use Hydreigon as setup fodder if Hydreigon has used or isn't running Dragonium Z. Hydreigon also fits well on stall builds due to its ability to switch in against troublesome stallbreakers like Chandelure, revenge kill Pokemon that can be difficult to check like Celebi and Mew, and provide reliable entry hazard removal. For this reason, partners like Blissey, Alomomola, and Pyukumuku make great partners with Hydreigon. Blissey can provide Heal Bell support to ease Hydreigon's vulnerability to Toxic while also checking some Fairy-types like Sylveon and Primarina for it.</p>"
      },
      "Taunt": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Taunt shuts down a large portion of specially defensive threats that can otherwise wall Hydreigon and attempt to cripple it, such as Blissey and Empoleon. Dark Pulse is a consistent STAB attack without drawbacks, hitting decently hard with the given investment. Roost provides Hydreigon with a reliable method of sustaining itself throughout a match, allowing it to consistently stallbreak. Draco Meteor is a powerful STAB attack that Hydreigon can use to muscle past offensive Pokemon like Nidoking and Mega Manectric. When Dragonium Z is activated, Draco Meteor becomes a powerful Devastating Drake that can be used to break a few defensive Pokemon without decreasing Hydreigon's Special Attack, such as Alomomola and Suicune after chip damage. Fire Blast is an option over Dark Pulse that can prove to be useful for weakening Steel-types like Cobalion and Scizor. However, it generally prevents Hydreigon from hitting a wider variety of foes due to Dark Pulse's better overall coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given investment and nature maximize Hydreigon's power while giving it as much Speed as possible. Levitate is especially useful on this set, as Hydreigon can easily utilize it to shut down defensive Ground-types like Swampert and Hippowdon. Life Orb is the preferred item due to the respectable power it will put behind Hydreigon's attacks. Dragonium Z is also an option, however, for granting access to Devastating Drake in addition to minimizing Knock Off damage. It should only be used if another teammate is not holding a Z-Crystal, however. Dread Plate is another option to boost the power of Dark Pulse without damaging Hydreigon with recoil.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Hydreigon looks to break past opposing teams, using Taunt whenever it needs to shut down a wall like Alomomola or Quagsire. Roost should be used whenever Hydreigon has been worn down a fair amount so as not to leave it open to a revenge killer. Lastly, Hydreigon should carefully count the turns in which the opposing Pokemon is crippled with Taunt, as if it doesn't continuously hit defensive foes with the move, they will be able to easily recover their health and stall it out.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well on bulky offensive teams that appreciate a Pokemon capable of crippling and wearing down defensive threats. Entry hazard support is important to the success of this set, as Hydreigon forces many switches and will be able to rack up residual damage on foes in doing so. Toxic Spikes from Nihilego, Tentacruel, or Nidoqueen is particularly helpful due to its ability to further wear defensive foes down. Hydreigon's inability to break past the likes of Mega Altaria, Sylveon, and Florges with this set makes checks to them like Scizor and Lucario good options as teammates. Fighting-types can also be useful if Hydreigon doesn't wish to use up a fair amount of PP breaking past Blissey. Cobalion and Terrakion are both notable examples due to their ability to also set Stealth Rock for Hydreigon if need be. Special sweepers that can have trouble breaking past bulky walls appreciate Hydreigon's ability to significantly chip them down with this set. Examples include Agility Moltres, Suicune, and Volcanion. All of which also appreciate Hydreigon being able to prevent the setting of entry hazards like Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes with Taunt.</p>"
      },
      "Life Orb Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is Hydreigon's strongest available STAB attack and has very limited switch-ins. Dark Pulse heavily damages Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latias and Doublade while also hitting the majority of the tier for neutral damage. Roost provides Hydreigon with a way of reliably recovering its health. Flash Cannon is able to 2HKO Togekiss and Sylveon, which otherwise wall Hydreigon, after Stealth Rock damage. Fire Blast is an option over Roost, which covers Steel-types that may attempt coming in on Draco Meteor, such as Klefki. Superpower is also an option that can be used to lure in Blissey and KO it, though it also forces Hydreigon to decrease its defenses so as not to run an Attack-reducing nature.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack gives Hydreigon a respectable amount of power. Maximum investment in Speed with a Timid nature makes Hydreigon as fast as possible, giving it key Speed advantages over threats like Rotom-H and non-Choice Scarf Krookodile. Life Orb gives Hydreigon the freedom of switching between its moves while putting more power behind its attacks. Levitate provides an immunity to Ground-type attacks that can be used to exploit Pokemon like Swampert.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>In order to maximize effectiveness, Hydreigon should look to come in on weak hits like Scald from Alomomola. It can then freely fire off its powerful attacks. However, prediction is required in order to 2HKO Pokemon like Sylveon on the switch with super effective coverage. It is important to be wary of Hydreigon's HP throughout the match, as Life Orb damage will wear it down rather quickly. When it has been significantly worn down, it should thus look to restore its HP with Roost. Lastly, Hydreigon should try spamming its STAB attacks as frequently as possible, which means that it is best that its common checks are removed or weakened before it is utilized in later stages of the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazards from Pokemon like Cobalion, Hippowdon, and Mega Aggron are useful for increasing Hydreigon's overall damage output. Physical wallbreakers are ideal for pairing with this set due to their ability to take on the majority of special walls for Hydreigon. Swords Dance Doublade is a notable example thanks to its ability to take care of both Blissey and Fairy-types. Other Fairy-type checks like Nidoqueen and Scizor can take care of big threats to Hydreigon in Sylveon and Mega Altaria. Fast threats like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega manectric, and Gengar can take on revenge killers for Hydreigon, while the likes of Suicune and Mega Aggron can easily switch into the priority attacks that threaten it. Sweepers such as Scizor, Infernape, and Celebi enjoy Hydreigon's ability to weaken opposing teams for them to easily clean up late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is a devastatingly powerful STAB attack with Choice Specs equipped, OHKOing the majority of offensive Pokemon while even cutting into defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Alolan Muk. Dark Pulse is a spammable STAB attack with no drawbacks and good neutral coverage. Flash Cannon can be used to catch Fairy-types on the switch, 2HKOing even Sylveon and Florges after entry hazard damage. Fire Blast rounds off Hydreigon's coverage, giving it a way to hit Steel-types like Klefki, Cobalion, and Mega Aggron for super effective damage. U-turn can be used over either Flash Cannon or Fire Blast for to allowing Hydreigon to pivot out of predicted switch-ins such as Blissey and Primarina. It can also potentially allow Hydreigon to bluff a Choice Scarf set.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Full investment in Special Attack with Choice Specs equipped maximizes Hydreigon's damage output. Full Speed investment with a Timid nature gives Hydreigon as much Speed as possible, notably allowing it to outrun threats such as Rotom-H and non-Choice Scarf Krookodile. Levitate grants Hydreigon opportunities to switch in against passive Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set looks to wallbreak throughout the early and middle stages of a match, meaning that Hydreigon should look to switch in on Pokemon like Volcanion, Mew, and Chandelure in order to get off a powerful hit. If it cannot find an opportunity to switch in, it should seek support from a pivot or come in after a teammate has fainted. Due to Choice Specs locking Hydreigon into one move, it should be wary of switch-ins and look to either pivot out or nail them with super effective coverage. For example, if a Fairy-type like Sylveon or Togekiss is expected to switch in, Hydreigon should look to use Flash Cannon to hit them super effectively, while it should try pivoting out with U-turn against predicted switch-ins from specially bulky Pokemon like Blissey and the rare Umbreon. Draco Meteor should be used liberally once reliable switch-ins are weakened due to its immense power, otherwise Pokemon like Mimikyu can take advantage of this and use Hydreigon as a free setup opportunity. Dark Pulse can also be spammed freely throughout later portions of the game due to its good neutral coverage and flinch chance. One thing to keep in mind is that this set is prone to being worn down, which means that entry hazard damage and status conditions should be avoided if possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Powerful physical attackers appreciate Hydreigon's ability to break past physical walls while in return taking care of specially bulky Pokemon. Cobalion is an especially notably example, due to its ability to take on both Blissey and Fairy-types. Other Fairy-type checks, such as Nidoqueen, Scizor, and Mega Aggron, are capable of offensively pressuring the likes of Sylveon and Primarina for Hydreigon. Fighting-type checks like Gligar and Latias can apply pressure to foes like Infernape, Cobalion, and Lucario. Late-game cleaners such as Mega Sharpedo, Scizor, and Gengar are appreciative of Hydreigon's ability to weaken opposing teams for them to more easily break through. VoltTurn support from Pokemon like Mega Beedrill, Mega Manectric, and Scizor can safely bring Hydreigon into play while also chipping foes for it to more easily muscle past. Lastly, clerics such as Sylveon and Togekiss can prove useful to Hydreigon on bulky offense teams due to its lack of recovery and vulnerability to status.</p>"

  "Cobalion": {
    "overview": "<p>Cobalion is one of the premier threats in the tier, with a versatile set of options including the ability to boost with both Swords Dance and Calm Mind, access to Stealth Rock, excellent Speed, and a great defensive typing that lets it check top-tier threats like Scizor, Hydreigon, and Bisharp. Its immunity to Toxic lets it come in on threats like Blissey and means it doesn't have to worry about losing to poison damage. Swords Dance is its flagship set, being very customizable and fulfilling a lot of roles besides that of a sweeper. Cobalion can run a variety of items to better fit the need of the team it is used on, with Z-Moves to wallbreak more easily, Rocky Helmet to punish physical attackers, and Shuca Berry to lure and remove Ground-types like Krookodile all being viable options. It is one of the best Pokemon at punishing Dark-types and Pursuit trappers thanks to its ability Justified, and its presence alone will make some of Cobalion's Dark-weak teammates able to be played more freely. There are some drawbacks to using Cobalion; notably, its Steel / Fighting dual typing leaves it without resistances to Psychic and Flying, which means that threats like Latias and Togekiss can be harder for Cobalion's team to deal with if it is the only Steel-type. It also faces competition from other offensive Stealth Rock users like Krookodile, Nihilego, and Terrakion, all of which have more unboosted power and different defensive typings to take advantage of. It also is severely lacking in initial power before boosting, having a mediocre base 90 in both Attack and Special Attack. This leaves the Swords Dance set walled by Pokemon like Slowbro even after a boost, while the Calm Mind set can struggle to get KOs on even offensive Pokemon. The Calm Mind set's main competition in Nasty Plot Lucario can wallbreak much more easily, as well.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A utility set with maximum HP and Speed investment and Stealth Rock, Close Combat, Thunder Wave, and Volt Switch is usable to focus on Cobalion's supportive aspects, but it is much more passive than the typical offensive sets and relies on teammates taking advantage of the status and entry hazards it provides. Life Orb is an option on Swords Dance sets to have a little bit more immediate power when unboosted, but the recoil takes away from a lot of the defensive utility Cobalion provides and worsens its matchup versus tanks with recovery like Hippowdon. X-Scissor can be used as coverage to hit Psychic-types like Slowbro, Celebi, and Latias super effectively, but its coverage otherwise is lacking and Cobalion has to drop a utility move for it. Taunt can be used to anti-lead other hazard users, but Pokemon with more offensive utility like Terrakion, Azelf, and Froslass generally outclass Cobalion in this role.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types:</strong> Bulky Ground-types have a relatively easy time handling Cobalion due to its lacking offensive stats. Hippowdon, Gligar, and Nidoqueen all can come in on Cobalion multiple times during a game and force it out. Cobalion can break through them with proper Z-Move usage, though, so they must be careful.</p> <p><strong>Water-types:</strong> Water-types also have the ability to wall Cobalion, especially those with secondary typings that grant Fighting-type resistance like Slowbro, Jellicent, and Tentacruel. Scald burns will prevent physical Cobalion from accomplishing anything. Water-types should be careful around Calm Mind sets, as they do not appreciate taking a +1 Gigavolt Havoc.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage:</strong> Cobalion, while 4x resistant to Stealth Rock, is often used as a team's tank to U-turn users like Scizor and Mega Beedrill. This will result in it switching in and immediately out often in the course of a game. If Spikes are up, the passive damage can add up more quickly than expected.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-resistant Pokemon:</strong> With its strongest STAB options being Close Combat and Focus Blast, a number of other Fighting-type checks are able to force out Cobalion despite its Steel-type STAB options. For defensive switch-ins, Amoonguss, Nidoqueen, and RestTalk Primarina all can take a Close Combat or Focus Blast well and usually force out Cobalion with either the threat of status or a STAB Earth Power in Nidoqueen's case. Offensively, there are Fire-types like Moltres and Chandelure that handle Cobalion's STAB combination well.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats:</strong> Cobalion has a great Speed tier, but there are a myriad of offensive threats that can revenge kill it still. Psychic-types like Starmie and Latias don't have a ton to fear by switching in directly, while other Pokemon like Mega Manectric, Earthquake Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile can all revenge kill it with a little bit of chip damage.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Cobalion can run Stealth Rock viably, using its ability to force switches via the threat of Swords Dance to find time to set Stealth Rock. It can also set up on potential entry hazard removers that would come in to remove the Stealth Rock like Empoleon. If the team already has Stealth Rock support, Rock Polish is a great option to help Cobalion clean offensive teams. At +2 Speed, Cobalion will be faster than Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Hydreigon that normally revenge kill it, allowing it to hit them with Close Combat. Stone Edge is a viable coverage option to lure and remove Pokemon that normally wall Cobalion like Moltres, Chandelure, and Tentacruel. It has to give up either its ability to boost Speed or set Stealth Rock for this, so make sure Stealth Rock is present somewhere else on Cobalion's team.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>All-Out Pummeling is the strongest Z-Move available to Cobalion, allowing it to break through sturdy walls like Mega Aggron, Suicune, and Hippowdon when boosted as well as gaining KOs on threats like Krookodile unboosted. Steelium Z is an option to break through bulky Fighting-resistant foes like Gligar, Amoonguss, and Celebi more easily, but Fightinium Z's general power is usually the superior choice. Rocky Helmet allows Cobalion to punish pivots like Scizor and Mega Beedrill with chip damage, helping it generate momentum even by switching in. Shuca Berry gives Cobalion insurance when facing opposing Ground-types, allowing it to lure and remove faster ones like Choice Scarf Krookodile and switch into or set up on slower ones like Mamoswine more safely once. Justified is often activated when Cobalion attempts to check Dark-types like Bisharp and Hydreigon. It can take advantage of the +1 Attack boost by hitting hard immediately instead of having to use Swords Dance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cobalion is not great at breaking through teams early-game, since its Attack leaves much to be desired. If run, Cobalion should be focused on setting Stealth Rock early and waiting for teammates or entry hazards to weaken foes before it attempts to sweep. Cobalion's HP should be kept high so it can survive revenge killing attempts when it is attempting to clean. Rock Polish aids it here by being able to outspeed and avoid attacks from Choice Scarf users when boosted, only fearing priority from Fighting-types like Infernape and Lucario. Be careful when using Cobalion's Z-Moves, be it Fightinium Z or Steelium Z. They should be used in order to get through walls Cobalion normally can't break. After it uses Swords Dance, Hippowdon, Alomomola, and Swampert all have to be wary of taking an All-Out Pummeling, while Gligar and Amoonguss should fear Corkscrew Crash. Aggressive play is rewarded with Rocky Helmet, so try to switch Cobalion into U-turn users like Scizor, Mega Beedrill, and even Choice Scarf Hydreigon; the chip damage will quickly add up for Cobalion's team and allow a cleaner to sweep more easily. Shuca Berry allows Cobalion to be more aggressive when facing Ground-types like Mamoswine and Gligar. In neutral situations, it can safely boost thanks to the reduced damage, while if the Ground-type is already on low HP, it can come in with impunity to revenge kill. Cobalion, despite being a Steel-type, has issues dealing with Fairy- and Psychic-types due to its neutrality to their attacks and its mediocre Special Defense. It is generally not advised to switch in and try and directly force them out, as Cobalion loses chunks of its HP quickly. Once it has acquired a Swords Dance boost, however, Cobalion will cleanly KO most Fairy-types like Florges and Togekiss.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Special tanks that can absorb some of the punishment Cobalion doesn't like from attackers such as Starmie, Latias, Moltres, and Mega Manectric make good partners. Mega Altaria, Blissey, Empoleon and Nihilego all can cover varying special attackers for Cobalion, while it can check Scizor in return. Toxic Spikes can help Cobalion clean defensive teams more easily by putting the walls that beat it like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Mega Slowbro on a timer. Tentacruel and Nihilego both can set the entry hazard well while also taking special attacks aimed at Cobalion. Spikes help Cobalion as well; although Klefki and Chesnaught both share parts of its typing, they are both able to cover weaknesses of Cobalion's dual typing with Klefki checking Fairy- and Psychic-types much better and Chesnaught handling bulky Water- and Ground-types. Klefki can also be used for Thunder Wave support, which lets Cobalion outspeed targets like Latias and Starmie it would normally fail to reach. Froslass can be used on as a Spikes setter on hyper offense teams with Cobalion. Cobalion can often appreciate a secondary Steel-type to supplement its role, as Cobalion itself is neutral to Psychic-, Flying-, and Fairy-type moves. Scizor is a great partner for Pursuit trapping threats like Latias and coming in on the defensive Fairy-types like Florges and Sylveon more easily, but this leaves the Flying-type weakness open. Bisharp also excels at helping remove Psychic-types but trades the Flying-type resistance for a Fairy-type neutrality. When using Rocky Helmet especially, cleaners like Mega Sharpedo, Swords Dance Scizor, and Mega Aerodactyl all appreciate the chip damage Cobalion sends early-game while also benefiting from Stealth Rock staying on the field. Pursuit users such as Krookodile, Mega Aerodactyl, and Alolan Muk can remove Psychic-types like Latias and Starmie that would check Cobalion and weaken the bulkier ones like Slowbro and Celebi into range for Cobalion to break through them. Dark-weak Pokemon like Latias, Gengar, and Starmie can all bait in Dark-types and Pursuit trappers that Cobalion loves to get setup opportunities on.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Calm Mind allows Cobalion to patch its weak Special Defense and break through traditional physical walls, with Focus Blast and especially All-Out Pummeling surprising physical walls like Hippowdon and Swampert expecting to take a Close Combat. Flash Cannon is useful for hitting Fairy-types, and Calm Mind boosts help Cobalion tank Fairy-type STAB attacks more easily from Florges and Sylveon. Hidden Power Grass lets Cobalion break through Water-types like Jellicent and Slowbro and allows it to run Fightinium Z. This is especially notable for hitting Quagsire, which is used to check setup sweepers on stall teams. Volt Switch with Electrium Z is crucial for hitting a number of threats that normally wall Calm Mind Cobalion like Tentacruel and Moltres.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Fightinium Z allows Cobalion to break through neutral targets like Hippowdon more easily, as well as giving it the necessary power to take down Blissey without having to boost a ton and lose HP in the process. Electrium Z is important for giving Cobalion access to a one-time nuke that also doesn't force it to switch out like using Volt Switch without the Z-Move does. Its targets include Tentacruel, Moltres, and Jellicent. Shuca Berry can be used on this set as well, giving Cobalion more setup opportunities when facing Ground-types.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Cobalion should not be used much at all early-game, instead letting its teammates punch holes in the enemy team first. The Calm Mind set is better at finishing games than opening them. Be careful about revealing its moveset early, as the surprise factor is often a big part in Calm Mind sets picking up KOs on unsuspecting physical walls like Slowbro. Cobalion is especially valuable versus stall teams, which often will play around it as if its physical. Use Gigavolt Havoc wisely when running Volt Switch, as it is otherwise forced out when using Electric-type coverage, removing any boosts it has accumulated. It is often wise to use Volt Switch before boosting to try and soften targets into the Z-Move's range. This way, Cobalion won't have to use Volt Switch again and can keep its boosts to sweep. Cobalion can come in on special walls like Blissey and Nihilego to bluff the physical set and then proceed to set up Calm Minds at little cost. Choice item users like Hydreigon and Krookodile locked into Dark-type moves are also used as chances to get free setup. Alomomola is weak enough for Cobalion to set up on as well. While Cobalion does have the natural bulk to come in directly when it must, it appreciates having close to full HP when attempting to sweep, as it must usually tank a hit or two when setting up. Try and bring it in off pivoting moves or double switches when possible.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Since this Cobalion set requires Stealth Rock support, a Ground-type like Hippowdon, Nidoqueen, or Gligar can both set the entry hazard and check Electric-types that could revenge kill Cobalion such as Mega Manectric and Zeraora. Toxic Spikes are a valuable tool, especially for breaking defensive teams, and Poison-types like Tentacruel, Nidoqueen, and Nihilego can provide them. Spikes from the likes of Chesnaught and Klefki can both chip enemy teams and force in hazard removers like Moltres and Tentacruel that Cobalion appreciates chip damage on. Pursuit trapping is valuable to prevent Latias from engaging in a Calm Mind war with Cobalion, along with removing potential revenge killers like Starmie and Gengar. Krookodile, Scizor, and Alolan Muk all can provide this utility. Calm Mind Cobalion starts off pretty weak and needs significant help from Pokemon that have good offense matchups in order to perform against those teams. Mega Aerodactyl, Starmie, and Mega Manectric are good examples of high-Speed threats that can soften offensive teams for Cobalion to eventually get through. Pivots to bring it in safely such as Gligar, Rotom-H, Rotom-C, and Zeraora help preserve Cobalion's HP and grant it more setup opportunities. Gligar and the Rotom formes also act as great pivots into the Ground-types that Cobalion is forced out by. Wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Gengar, and Primarina are all viable options to help soften teams early-game before Cobalion comes in to finish a game. Cobalion usually appreciates a secondary Steel-type like Empoleon or Scizor, especially because Calm Mind sets like to preserve their HP.</p>"

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the UU tier thanks to its high Attack stat and amazing STAB combination. It can also work as a fearsome setup sweeper with Swords Dance, as it's able to pressure and break through a lot of stall and balance teams. Despite facing competition from other Fighting-types like Infernape and Cobalion, Terrakion sets itself apart from them due to its ability to beat common Fighting-type answers like Togekiss and Moltres, its better Attack stat, and its access to Justified. However, Terrakion's typing is very poor defensively, making it easily exploitable and weak to a lot of priority moves like Bullet Punch, Mach Punch, and Aqua Jet and common typings, such as Steel, Psychic, Ground, and Fighting. The Defense and Special Defense drops caused by using Close Combat only aggravate this weakness. On sets utilizing a Z-Move, Terrakion can be easily exploited by bulky threats like Hippowdon and Alomomola that can tank a hit from it and cripple it after it has used its Z-Move. Terrakion is also outsped by a lot of common threats in the metagame, such as Latias and Gengar, meaning it can have a hard time sweeping.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Double Dance set utilizing both Swords Dance and Rock Polish can be used to punish more fast-paced teams, but it's not very reliable, as it's still prone to being revenge killed by priority users and has a hard time setting up. Choice Scarf can be used to make Terrakion a decent revenge killer but the loss of power without a Choice Band or Z-Move is very noticeable, preventing it from being able to break through bulkier Pokemon like Gligar and Hippowdon at all. A dedicated Stealth Rock set with Focus Sash could be used on very fast-paced teams, as Terrakion can threaten the opposing team with Swords Dance boosts. A set utilizing the combination of Substitute and Salac Berry is an option, as Terrakion could have more opportunities to set up a Swords Dance behind a Substitute, while the Speed boost could allow it to threaten offensive teams more easily, but it's still very hard to set up with this set.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Pokemon like Latias and Choice Scarf Krookodile are able to outspeed and revenge kill Terrakion with ease due to its mediocre defensive typing. Priority moves from Pokemon like Scizor, Infernape, and Crawdaunt can also threaten it, especially after the stat drops from Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon like Hippowdon and Gligar can tank any hit from Terrakion bar +2 All-Out Pummeling and OHKO it in return with their STAB moves, while Quagsire and Palossand only have to fear Toxic. Hippowdon and Quagsire struggle to switch into a Choice Band- or Life Orb-boosted Close Combat, however.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Mega Slowbro is one of the best checks to Terrakion, as it can switch into any of Terrakion's sets without fearing anything bar Toxic and deal heavy damage in return with its STAB moves. Other bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Suicune can also beat it one-on-one, but they are usually unable to directly switch into a Choice Band- or Life Orb-boosted attack.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types like Latias and Starmie can outspeed Terrakion and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Bulkier Psychic-types like Slowbro are also able to tank many hits from Terrakion and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Doublade</strong>: Doublade can easily switch into any of Terrakion's STAB attacks, being immune to Close Combat and resisting Stone Edge, and threaten to OHKO Terrakion with STAB Gyro Ball. However, it must be wary of Earthquake.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Terrakion's Attack by two stages, allowing it to break through bulkier teams with ease. Stone Edge is Terrakion's strongest Rock-type STAB attack, and in combination with Rockium Z, it can turn into a very powerful Continental Crush, which can KO Pokemon like Mega Slowbro and Gligar after some prior damage. Close Combat is a stronger and more reliable STAB move that hits Pokemon that resist Stone Edge like Quagsire hard. It can also OHKO Pokemon like Hippowdon and Swampert if used in combination with Fightinium Z to turn into a very strong All-Out Pummeling. Earthquake allows Terrakion to OHKO Pokemon like Volcanion and Chandelure without having to risk missing Stone Edge and KO Doublade at +2 after some some prior damage. Stealth Rock is a viable option in the last moveslot if no other Pokemon on the team can afford to use it. Protect can also be used to scout for moves and Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Choice Band Scizor and Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack allows Terrakion to hit as hard as it can without a boosting nature. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature let Terrakion outspeed Pokemon like Nihilego and non-Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Speed tie with Pokemon like Cobalion. Rockium Z turns Stone Edge into a powerful Continental crush, which allows Terrakion to break through some of its checks such as Mega Slowbro after some prior damage. Fightinium Z is an alternative for a Z-Move, as it allows Terrakion to OHKO Pokemon that resist Stone Edge like Quagsire and Hippowdon with +2 All-Out Pummeling. Life Orb is a decent option, allowing it to pressure bulkier teams far more easily by 2HKOing Pokemon like Quagsire with Close Combat and OHKOing Pokemon like Latias and Celebi with Stone Edge after a Swords Dance; however, Terrakion struggles with longevity even without the recoil from Life Orb, so this could prove problematic for it. Babiri Berry could be chosen in order to take a Bullet Punch from Scizor while sacrificing the power from a Z-Move, allowing Terrakion to break through teams or sweep more easily. Justified is Terrakion's only available ability, allowing it to get an Attack boost whenever it is hit by a Dark-type attack. Additionally, if holding a Z-Move, it also allows Terrakion to act as a Knock Off absorber from Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Choice-locked Krookodile.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Early-game, Terrakion should focus on attacking instead of setting up with Swords Dance so it can whittle down the opposing team. Setting up with Terrakion before Pokemon with access to priority moves like Scizor or that usually hold a Choice Scarf like Krookodile are removed is not advised, as Terrakion will most likely not be able to sweep. However, against bulkier teams that lack the ability to easily revenge kill Terrakion you should prioritise setting up on Pokemon it can force out like Blissey. Terrakion should be brought in via double switches, via pivoting, or if a Pokemon has fainted, as it has a poor defensive typing and cannot afford to switch in directly to most Pokemon. However, if holding a Z-Move, as it can't lose its item, Terrakion can be used to switch into a predicted Knock Off to get an Attack boost from Justified. Both Continental Crush and All-Out Pummeling should be used carefully, as they can only be used once and are necessary for Terrakion to be able to break through Pokemon like Mega Slowbro, Gligar, and Hippowdon. Using them against the wrong Pokemon can be very costly. If running Stealth Rock in the last slot it should attempt to set them up early-game with all the switches it can force and ability to overwhelm common entry hazard removers in Gligar and Tentacruel after a Swords Dance. If Terrakion lacks Earthquake and is against a foe like Doublade it is best to double switch in order to gain momentum, especially if Stealth Rock has already been set up. Finally, once the Pokemon that can threaten Terrakion are removed, it should try to find opportunities to set up by making predictions and double switches in order to break through and potentially sweep the opposing team.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Terrakion fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to break through bulkier builds. Due to its bad defensive typing, Terrakion has a very hard time directly switching in and thus pairs well with U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Scizor and Mega Manectric that can bring it in safely. Entry hazard setters such as Mega Aggron, Krookodile, and Klefki make good teammates for Terrakion, as hazards can secure OHKOs on certain Pokemon, such as Mega Slowbro and Hippowdon. Pokemon like Moltres and Tentacruel are able to tank most priority moves aimed at Terrakion, such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Infernape's Vacuum Wave. Entry hazard removers like Volcanion and the aforementioned Moltres and Tentacruel make great partners, as they can prevent Terrakion being worn down and can pressure bulky Ground-types for Terrakion. Pursuit users such as Choice Scarf Krookodile and Choice Band Scizor are able to trap threatening Pokemon for Terrakion like Latias and Starmie. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Togekiss make good partners, since they're able to easily switch into Pokemon like Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Krookodile, which can usually threaten Terrakion. Grass-types like Celebi and Tsareena also pair well with it for the same reason. Choice Scarf Latias has good synergy with Terrakion, as it can check faster Pokemon that usually threaten Terrakion such as Choice Scarf Infernape, and it has access to Healing Wish, which can heal Terrakion back up after it has weakened the opposing team. In return, Terrakion can take advantage of Pokemon that lock themselves into Dark-type moves such as Choice Scarf Krookodile and Choice Band Scizor and try to set up. Pokemon like Doublade and Gengar can also force the same situation and thus pair well with Terrakion. Magneton pairs very well with Terrakion, as it can check Fairy-types such as Sylveon, bring Terrakion in safely via Volt Switch, and most importantly, trap and remove Scizor, which can prevent Terrakion from sweeping with Bullet Punch.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is Terrakion's strongest and most accurate STAB move, dealing a great amount of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Stone Edge complements Close Combat by hitting Pokemon that resist Fighting-type attacks, such as Latias and Sylveon, hard. Earthquake allows Terrakion to hit Doublade, which would otherwise be able to completely wall it. It can also be used to revenge kill Pokemon like Nidoking and Tentacruel, which usually avoid the OHKO from any of Terrakion's other moves. Toxic allows Terrakion to cripple non-Rest Mega Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Alomomola which can stomach a hit and retaliate with their STAB coverage or status. Quick Attack could also be used in the last slot to pick off weakened faster threats such as Latias and a Speed boosted Mega Sharpedo. However, it's important to note that Quick Attack should only be used if it can absolutely revenge kill the foe, as it's a very weak move. Rock Slide can be used over Toxic as a more reliable Rock-type STAB move that guarantee OHKOes Moltres and Rotom-H, however, it is much weaker than Stone Edge and shouldn't be used in any other situations, as it misses out on the OHKO or 2HKO on a lot of Pokemon, such as Primarina and Starmie.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment coupled with a Choice Band allows Terrakion to be as strong as it can be with a neutral nature, making it extremely difficult to switch into. 252 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature provide Terrakion with the ability to outspeed Pokemon like Nihilego, Hydreigon, and Celebi and Speed tie with Cobalion and non-Choice Scarf Infernape. Justified is the only available ability for Terrakion. However, it can give Terrakion an Attack boost whenever it is hit by a Dark-type attack, like Hydreigon's Choice-locked Dark Pulse or Mega Houndoom's Dark Pulse.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>While using Terrakion, it's advised to make predictions often, as the opponent can take advantage of the fact that Terrakion has to be locked into a move whenever it fires off an attack. For instance, if the opponent is predicted to switch into a Pokemon that resists Close Combat, such as Latias, then Stone Edge should be used, and vice versa. Making a bad prediction may cause a loss of momentum and give the opponent an advantage, so Terrakion should be used carefully. Additionally, Terrakion should not switch into attacks directly, as its typing is very poor defensively. Instead, it should be brought in via double switches, via pivots, or when a Pokemon has fainted. Even with Justified, it shouldn't switch into Dark-type moves most of the time, as most Dark-type Pokemon can still threaten Terrakion with their other moves; Terrakion should be especially wary of Knock Off users, which cause it to lose its Choice Band. It should only switch in on attacks like a Choice-locked Hydreigon's Dark Pulse. Earthquake should be used on a predicted switch to Doublade, while Toxic should be used to cripple bulky Pokemon that try to switch into Terrakion, specifically Mega Slowbro, as they can avoid being 2HKOed by any of its moves. Toxic also alleviates the need to correctly predict what move Terrakion needs to lock itself into to break these bulkier foes. Use Quick Attack to pick off a weakened target that usually outspeeds Terrakion, such as a weakened Latias or Choice Scarf Hydreigon that can otherwise revenge kill it easily after taking prior damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Terrakion is best used on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to break through walls and weaken foes. Terrakion has a very hard time switching in due to its poor defensive typing, so it pairs well with U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Scizor and Mega Manectric that can bring it in safely. Cleaners such as Mega Sharpedo and Swords Dance Scizor make good teammates, as they can take advantage of Terrakion's ability to weaken the opposing team. Entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Krookodile, and Klefki also pair well with Terrakion, as it can force a lot of switches and hazards may also secure OHKOs or 2HKOs on certain Pokemon, such as Latias and Slowbro. Klefki in particular is a great partner for Terrakion due to its ability to cripple faster Pokemon like Latias and Mega Aerodactyl with Thunder Wave. Grass-types such as Celebi and Tsareena also make good partners, as they can check most bulky Ground- and Water-types that threaten Terrakion, such as Hippowdon and Alomomola. Terrakion appreciates being paired with Pokemon that can check Psychic-types like Slowbro and Latias, as they can threaten it a lot. Examples of such Pokemon include Empoleon, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Mega Aggron. Pursuit trappers such as Choice Band Scizor and Choice Scarf Krookodile make great partners as they are able to trap and remove the likes of Latias for Terrakion. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Togekiss also make good partners, as they can switch into Ground-types like Hippowdon and Choice Scarf Krookodile that usually threaten Terrakion. Pokemon like Moltres, Tentacruel, and Rotom-H also pair well with Terrakion because they're able to sponge the priority moves aimed at it such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Infernape's Vacuum Wave. Rotom-H is a especially good partner, as it can also bring Terrakion in with Volt Switch. Magneton, although situational, can be a very useful partner, as it can bring Terrakion in with Volt Switch, check Fairy-types, and most importantly, trap and remove Pokemon like Scizor, which can threaten Terrakion a lot.</p>"

  "Tornadus": {
    "overview": "<p>Tornadus is a versatile offensive Pokemon that can function as a wallbreaker with its solid power and coverage or as a utility pivot with U-turn and Prankster status moves like Defog and Tailwind. Its high Special Attack and high Speed allow it to outspeed several prominent threats in UU, including Gengar, Celebi, and Infernape, and overpower them with STAB Hurricane. It also can utilize Supersonic Skystrike to even break past bulkier offensive threats like Latias and Terrakion after minor chip damage. This middle ground of power and Speed allows it to distinguish itself from other Flying-type choices. Its large range of coverage options also benefits it, allowing it to utilize moves like Superpower and Heat Wave to greatly limit its switch-ins. Unfortunately, Tornadus provides very little defensive utility to teams due to its Stealth Rock weakness, lack of recovery, mediocre defenses, and lack of useful resistances. Because of this, it faces competition from other offensive Flying-types such as Moltres, Mega Pidgeot, and Togekiss, which have better defensive typings, better bulk, and access to reliable recovery. Its reliance on Hurricane as its STAB attack can be disadvantageous due to the move's poor accuracy. Lastly, due to Tornadus's poor defenses and typing, it struggles to do anything of worth to most priority users like Mamoswine and Scizor, as they can power through it easily after minor chip damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Tornadus's good Attack and physical coverage options can allow it to viably run Defiant-based or Bulk Up sets that utilize Acrobatics as its Flying-type STAB move, though these are often more situational than mixed wallbreaking and pivoting sets due to its worse overall physical coverage and its frailty preventing it from finding too many setup opportunities. It would also be unable to run an item due to its reliance on Acrobatics as its STAB attack. Full-on special attacking sets are also options due to Tornadus's equally diverse special movepool, though it still struggles to break past the metagame as easily as with its mixed sets. Knock Off can be run for its ability to burden switch-ins with the removal of their items, providing more overall utility to Tornadus's team. However, it is often too hard to find room for.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Due to Tornadus's poor bulk and typing, it's easily overcome by faster offensive threats that can hit it with strong neutral attacks or super effective moves. Examples include Mega Beedrill and Starmie as well as Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Nihilego.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mega Manectric can switch in on Tornadus at least twice, avoiding a 2HKO from both its STAB attacks and coverage moves, while outspeeding and KOing it with super effective STAB moves. Zeraora can only switch in once due to being 2HKOed by Superpower, though it can outspeed and OHKO Tornadus with STAB Plasma Fists. Rotom-H's typing allows it to come in on Heat Wave even more comfortably, though due to its worse Speed than Tornadus's and Stealth Rock weakness, offensive variants should be wary of getting 2HKOed by Hurricane after minor chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Although they can't often take more than one Superpower, Rock-types like Nihilego and Stakataka can threaten Tornadus heavily with their super effective STAB attacks. Mega Aerodactyl resists both Hurricane and Heat Wave, avoids the 2HKO from Superpower when at full health, outruns Tornadus, and KOes it with its super effective STAB Stone Edge, making it a very reliable method of counterplay.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Some specially defensive Pokemon have easy times working around Tornadus. Alolan Muk tanks any special hit while avoiding the 2HKO from Superpower from full, allowing it to threaten to Pursuit trap Tornadus or OHKO it with STAB Gunk Shot. Blissey can switch into any of Tornadus's special moves, but it must be wary of Superpower. Florges and Sylveon can also defensively check Tornadus, tanking any of its hits while wearing it down with Fairy-type STAB moves. Both should be wary of getting 2HKOed by Hurricane followed by Supersonic Skystrike, however.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Life Orb": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is a powerful STAB attack that has good neutral coverage and allows Tornadus to revenge kill several slower threats, like Infernape, Celebi, and Chandelure. Heat Wave covers some Steel-types that could otherwise come in on Hurricane, such as Klefki, Mega Steelix, and Mega Aggron. It also more reliably KOes Scizor and Cobalion. Superpower hits most other conventional Flying-type switch-ins, dealing heavy damage to Empoleon and Stakataka. It also heavily damages Blissey and Snorlax, two Pokemon that could otherwise tank hits from Tornadus, on the switch. Grass Knot is an option for OHKOing Terrakion and Swampert, more heavily and reliably damaging Hippowdon than Hurricane, and taking out Rhyperior, which could otherwise tank the rest of Tornadus's attacks. It also reliably powers through Swampert and Seismitoad in one hit. Defog allows Tornadus to exploit the switches it forces to remove entry hazards from the field. Tailwind is an option if entry hazard removal is being provided by another teammate, allowing Tornadus to support its teammates before fainting by briefly doubling their Speed.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Hasty nature allows Tornadus to increase its Speed while refraining from decreasing Superpower's damage output. Life Orb puts considerable power behind Tornadus's attacks, allowing it to apply heavy offensive pressure to the majority of the metagame and achieve a potentially crucial guaranteed OHKO on Terrakion with Grass Knot. Defiant can be run to boost Superpower's damage output by switching in on the Defog users Tornadus beats to boost its Attack. However, Prankster can be used if running Defog or Tailwind to give them priority.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is aimed to function as more of a wallbreaker on offensive teams, due to Tornadus's great coverage and attacking stats allowing it to threaten a large portion of the metagame. Because of its lacking defensive utility, Tornadus should be brought into play via pivot support or after a teammate has fainted so it doesn't compromise its already limited longevity. Hurricane should be spammed against teams due to its impressive general coverage, tough Tornadus should try predicting a switch-in to the attack, such as Klefki or Blissey, if they're on the opposing team and healthy and nailing them with super effective coverage on the switch. Defog is best to use on forced switches when entry hazards are on Tornadus's side of the field. Thanks to its ability to force out several Stealth Rock setters like Hippowdon and Swampert, it can also often successfully attempt to switch in on them as they set Stealth Rock. Defog can also be used when Tornadus is weakened in a last-ditch effort to keep entry hazards off its side of the field. Tailwind should be used when Tornadus is weakened into range of a KO from the next attack to hit it, as this can generate momentum for its teammates while also providing them with a boost in Speed. Tornadus's Speed tier should be utilized to revenge kill various threats, such as Terrakion, Cobalion, and Hydreigon, once they've been weakened a bit.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set works best on offensive teams that appreciate Tornadus's ability to break past several defensive foes while weakening opposing offensive builds. Setup sweepers like Latias, Mega Altaria, and Lucario appreciate Tornadus's ability to muscle past opposing teams for them to clean up late-game. Powerful offensive threats like Mamoswine, Primarina, and Nidoking appreciate Tornadus's Tailwind support, as their offensive presences will become even harder to combat without opposing foes capable of outrunning them. Tornadus often favors pivoting support from the likes of Hydreigon, Scizor, and Rotom-H due to its poor typing and frailty preventing it from getting in easily. Entry hazard removal from a teammate like Tsareena, Starmie, or Hydreigon is also important to support Tornadus with if it isn't running Defog itself, due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Electric-type checks, like Hydreigon and Mega Sceptile, can pivot in on the likes of Rotom-H and Mega Manectric, which can hit Tornadus super effectively while tanking a hit or two.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hurricane is a fairly powerful STAB attack that offers good neutral coverage. It can also be useful for revenge killing some of the tier's several Fighting-types, such as Infernape and Heracross. When Flyinium Z is activated, it turns into Supersonic Skystrike, which patches up Hurricane's imperfect accuracy while powering through bulkier foes like Swampert, Hippowdon, and Togekiss after Stealth Rock damage. U-turn pivots Tornadus out of undesirable situations, such as a predicted switch into a foe that checks it, such as Mega Aggron. Superpower deals heavy damage to Blissey, a common switch-in to the majority of special attackers, while also dealing adequate damage to Flying-type switch-ins, such as Nihilego, Stakataka, and Empoleon. Heat Wave is an option over Superpower for punishing Steel-type switch-ins like Bronzong, Mega Aggron, and Klefki, though being unable to power through Blissey, Stakataka, or Empoleon as reliably is a notable drawback. Defog is boosted by Prankster and allows Tornadus to remove all entry hazards on the field. It can both be used as Tornadus forces switches and, thanks to Prankster, in a last-ditch effort when it's weakened. If entry hazard removal is not needed or is being provided by another teammate, Tailwind is an option for allowing Tornadus to double the Speed of its teammates before fainting.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A Hasty nature are preferred for preventing Superpower's damage output from being decreased while keeping Tornadus's decent natural Special Defense intact. However, if Superpower is not being run, a Timid nature is preferred to not unnecessarily lower Tornadus's already poor Defense stat. Flyinium Z grants access to Supersonic Skystrike, which is useful for powering through bulkier foes or guaranteeing a perfectly accurate Flying-type attack. Prankster gives Tornadus's status attacks priority, allowing it to almost always move first when using Defog or Tailwind. Prankster also allows it to move before priority users like Scizor, Crawdaunt, and Mamoswine in last-ditch efforts.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's main goal is to act as an offensive pivot, meaning Tornadus will often be brought into play either to weaken the opposing team with its attacks or to use Defog before generating momentum with U-turn. Due to its poor defensive utility, Tornadus is best to bring into play through the support of a pivot or after a teammate has fainted. It can come in on predicted Ground-type attacks from the likes of Gligar and Hippowdon, however. When Tornadus is weakened and entry hazards are on its side of the field, it should attempt using Defog as a last-ditch effort to remove them before fainting. If Tailwind is being run, it should be used late-game to allow a teammate to clean up with an enhanced Speed tier. It's also best used when Tornadus is weakened, as it will give a teammate a free switch into play upon Tornadus fainting after using the move. U-turn should be used to pivot out of Pokemon that Tornadus won't be able to muscle past before losing to, such as Mega Aggron and Nihilego.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its nature as an offensive pivot, this set fits best on teams that are very offensively inclined more often than not. Pokemon that enjoy the removal or weakening of Grass-types like Zeraora and Suicune appreciate Tornadus as a partner thanks to its ability to apply pressure to the likes of Amoonguss and Celebi. Frailer offensive Pokemon, such as Infernape, Starmie, and Nidoking, like Tornadus's ability to safely bring them into play with U-turn. Ground-types such as Gligar and Krookodile make good partners thanks to their ability to check most Rock- and Electric-types for Tornadus. If Tornadus is running Tailwind, powerful offensive forces like Terrakion, Heracross, and Volcanion will appreciate having their Speed increased thanks to it. Tornadus's frailty and odd defensive typing mean oftentimes it will require the support of a pivot to get into play, making Pokemon like Scizor, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-H good options as teammates. It also often enjoys Pokemon capable of weakening Steel-types for it, such as Heracross, Mega Houndoom, and Infernape, as teammates. Entry hazard control from the likes of Latias, Starmie, and Hydreigon can allow Tornadus to forgo running Defog for Tailwind while also alleviating its Stealth Rock weakness.</p>"

While Kyurem's base 95 Speed is certainly decent, it leaves it outpaced by a number of offensive threats, such as Hydreigon, Cobalion, and Terrakion. Its typing is also a double-edged sword, leaving it vulnerable to Steel-types, most notably Scizor, and weak to Stealth Rock. Furthermore, Kyurem faces stiff competition from Hydreigon, which is generally a better choice as a special Dragon-type wallbreaker due to it requiring less prediction and its superior defensive utility. However, Kyurem has a notable niche over Hydreigon in its Ice typing, which allows it to directly threaten typical checks to Dragon-types, such as Togekiss and Mega Altaria.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used on SubRoost sets so that Kyurem can beat one of its best checks in Scizor, while still retaining the ability to hit Steel-types, however it will have difficulty breaking through Pokemon like Empoleon and Tentacruel if so. Metronome can be run on the SubRoost set to better break through its natural checks in Scizor and Florges, but the cost to longevity is risky, especially for the bulky teams on which you'd use it. SubRoost can also run Protect to PP stall further or rack up poison damage, but the cost in coverage is also very risky.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types, such as Scizor, Bronzong, Empoleon, and Mega Aggron, can wall Kyurem's STAB combination and potentially beat it one-on-one. However, they must watch out for Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types are immune to Kyurem's Dragon-type STAB attacks and can threaten it with Moonblast. A special mention goes to Primarina, which also resists Ice and has good special bulk to tank Kyurem's attacks more than once.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Many of the tier's Fighting-types, such as Cobalion, Terrakion, and Infernape, outspeed Kyurem and eliminate it with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Most dedicated special walls such as Umbreon, Alolan Muk, Empoleon, and Mantine can eat a hit from any Kyurem variant. These Pokemon must watch out for the proper coverage move, however, and can be PP stalled by the SubRoost set.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage</strong>: Kyurem is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and weak to Stealth Rock, which severely limits its chances to enter the field. Status also wears down Kyurem very quickly, especially if it is lacking Roost. Toxic in particular squanders any hope SubRoost Kyurem might have of doing its job.</p>",

      "SubRoost": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Ice Beam is the only STAB attack this set uses, and it does decent damage despite the lack of a boosting item due to Kyurem's high Special Attack. Substitute is necessary to block status and waste the foe's PP with Pressure. Earth Power keeps Steel- and Water-types from coming in completely for free, giving Kyurem optimal coverage alongside Ice Beam. Lastly, Roost is a reliable recovery move, giving Kyurem much needed staying power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Substitute blocks status, and the foe has to waste PP via Pressure to break it before it can hurt Kyurem. 56 HP EVs give Kyurem 101 HP Substitutes, meaning that a single Seismic Toss cannot break it. The rest goes into its Special Attack and Speed so Kyurem isn't too passive and can utilize its good Speed tier. Leftovers is used to give Kyurem passive recovery so it doesn't have to use Roost as often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set is based around taking advantage of Kyurem's bulk and Pressure to PP stall the opposing Pokemon. As a result, it shines versus passive teams that can't break Kyurem's Substitute and most often finds a place on passive teams itself as a stallbreaker and check to Electric-types. Due to the lack of boosting item, this set is relatively weak and as such shouldn't be treated like a wallbreaker. Be careful versus bulky setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Suicune and Swords Dance Scizor, which can take advantage of this set with relative ease. Toxic Spikes are paramount to this set's success, as they make stalling out the opponent much easier.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Steel-types, such as Mega Aggron, Cobalion and Scizor, can check opposing Fairy- and Steel-types and the latter two can help break special walls. But be careful, as with the exception of Scizor, they stack a Fighting weakness. Pursuit trappers such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile also help to alleviate offensive pressure, putting an end to nuisances such as Latias and revenge killing setup sweepers. Toxic Spikes setters, namely Tentacruel and Nidoqueen, can wear down Pokemon that threaten Kyurem and allow it to stall them out, while reliably checking opposing Fairy-types, an important one being Primarina. Entry hazard removers such as Starmie, Mantine, and the aforementioned Tentacruel are a must, as they allow Kyurem to come in without being whittled or crippled by Toxic Spikes. Most are also able to check Fighting-types. Florges and Sylveon make great partners as they can provide Kyurem with Wish support as well as cleric support in Heal Bell, reducing its vulnerability to status like Toxic. Celebi, Terrakion, and Togekiss appreciate Kyurem being able to break through Pokemon like Mega Steelix, Gligar, and Rhyperior, giving them an easier chance to sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Draco Meteor is an obscenely powerful nuke that does considerable damage even to Pokemon that resist it, doing half to bulky Scizor, for example, and a third to Empoleon. Ice Beam is Kyurem's secondary STAB attack, and it is very spammable due to its fantastic offensive coverage and lack of drawbacks. Hidden Power Fire removes Steel-types switching in to tank Kyurem's STAB moves, such as Scizor and Klefki. Earth Power pairs nicely alongside Hidden Power Fire, as it hits certain Ice-resistant Pokemon harder, like Tentacruel and Empoleon, while maintaining neutral coverage against Scizor and it also nets an OHKO on physically defensive Klefki. Dragon Pulse is another viable option in the final slot, as it provides a secondary drawback-free STAB attack with great neutral coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>A straightforward spread of maximum Special Attack and Speed allows Kyurem to hit as fast and as hard as possible. Choice Specs boosts Kyurem's Special Attack by one stage, making it extremely powerful, but locks it into using a single move in exchange. A Timid nature is needed for Kyurem to outspeed threats such as Krookodile, Nidoking, and Rotom-H, making it worth the slight decrease in power versus a Modest nature. Although Pressure is Kyurem's only option for an ability, it offers nice utility in forcing opposing Pokemon to use double the normal PP, which can come into play with low PP moves like Hydro Pump and Leaf Storm.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to the nature of Choice items, it is worth trying to predict what your opponent will do and move accordingly to maximize Kyurem's damage output. Make sure entry hazards are off the field if you can, as Kyurem's vulnerability to them cuts considerably into its opportunities to switch in and its bulk. Volt Switch and U-turn allow Kyurem to come in for free versus Pokemon it can threaten, such as Amoonguss. However, Kyurem has the bulk and resistances to switch directly into weaker attacks, such as Earthquake from Gligar and Scald from Suicune. On more offensive teams, it helps to play Kyurem aggressively, spamming attacks early-game and bringing it in on double switches. Be selective with the use of Draco Meteor, however, as it lowers Kyurem's Special Attack by two stages. This drop in power can be quite risky, as it means that setup sweepers and dangerous wallbreakers such as Togekiss and Primarina are able to come in with little consequence.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Starmie, Mega Blastoise, Empoleon, and Tentacruel can remove entry hazards as well as, bar Empoleon, check dangerous Fighting-types. Tentacruel is especially noteworthy, since it can also set Toxic Spikes, an invaluable method for wearing down Kyurem switch-ins that aren't Steel-types, like Primarina and Sylveon. Klefki not only has good defensive synergy with Tentacruel but also makes Kyurem's job as a wallbreaker much easier by setting Spikes and switching reliably into opposing Dragon- and Fairy-types. Scizor, Mega Manectric, and Gligar can bring in Kyurem for free with U-turn or Volt Switch while also checking opposing Steel-types. Magneton is an extremely helpful teammate, as it can trap and remove Steel-types, check Fairy-types, and let Kyurem come in for free with Volt Switch. Fairy-types such as Primarina and Togekiss can reliably check faster Dragon-types such Hydreigon and Latias, which can outspeed Kyurem and KO it with their own Dragon moves. Setup sweepers like Cobalion and Terrakion greatly appreciate Kyurem's ability to place heavy pressure on walls such as Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Florges.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Unfortunately, Meloetta simply has no place in the UU metagame. Despite its great Special Attack and natural bulk, its mediocre typing leaves with only two resistances and a common weakness in Dark, it lacks recovery, and it has an average Speed tier that puts it behind most Choice Scarf users even with a boost. For these reasons, it is hopelessly outclassed by Latias as an offensive Psychic-type. The closest it has to a worthwhile niche is as a late-game sweeper with Z-Celebrate, which, even with its bulk and power, is easy to both wall and overwhelm offensively due to its aforementioned setbacks.</p>",

Though the listed attacks have solid coverage and Meloetta is quite strong, it only has one shot to truly accomplish anything, as it is quite vulnerable the turn it sets up, can only set up once, and is not much of a threat without a boost. Its added bulk upon boosting doesn't help much, either, as its lack of resistances and recovery makes it more delicate than its stats might imply. This leaves it easy to wear down or simply revenge kill, as it fails to outspeed the ubiquitous Choice Scarf Krookodile and Choice Scarf Hydreigon.</p>"}},

  "Chesnaught": {
    "overview": "<p>Chesnaught is a reliable physically bulky Spikes user that has access to recovery in Synthesis, enabling it to get the entry hazard up several times in a game. Bulletproof helps it out defensively, providing it with immunities to common moves such as Gengar and Chandelure's Shadow Ball and Stakataka's Gyro Ball. Its Grass / Fighting typing combined with Chesnaught's high Defense helps it switch into several key physical attackers such as Krookodile, Zeraora, and Bisharp. However, while this typing helps Chesnaught greatly against many physical threats, it also leaves Chesnaught critically weak to several powerful attackers such as Latias, Togekiss, Moltres, and Mega Altaria. This, combined with its passivity, gives several free turns to threatening setup sweepers like Calm Mind Latias, Swords Dance Scizor, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Furthermore, while Chesnaught offers several utility options and more physical bulk, it still competes with Klefki as a Spiker, which is faster, has access to Prankster and a variety of status moves, and has a typing that can check threatening Dragon-types.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Spiky Shield can be run to stack passive damage on foes and gain an extra turn of Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery so Chesnaught isn't forced to use Synthesis repeatedly. 176 Speed EVs can be used with Taunt to prevent Gligar from using Toxic and Defog, but it cuts into Chesnaught's bulk a lot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Chesnaught does not have any counterplay to Flying-types such as Moltres and Togekiss; they can switch in freely, only being damaged by Toxic and Leech Seed. This allows Moltres to remove entry hazards or fire off a powerful attack and enables Togekiss to start setting up with Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Infernape, Chandelure, and Moltres can switch into Chesnaught and force it out, but the former two do not appreciate switching into several layers of Spikes. Rotom-H's good bulk and Spikes immunity allow it to pivot in more easily and remove entry hazards or KO Chesnaught.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Mega Altaria, Primarina, and Florges can easily force out Chesnaught with their STAB attacks, but the latter two don't appreciate taking damage from Wood Hammer on the switch. Dragon Dance Mega Altaria can also use Chesnaught as setup fodder. Mega Altaria and Florges can additionally use Defog to remove Chesnaught's Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Chesnaught is setup fodder for many setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Scizor, Calm Mind Latias, and Nasty Plot Celebi. Though it can phaze them with Roar or cripple them with Leech Seed, its passivity can give these dangerous setup sweepers several free turns.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes gives Chesnaught and its teammates a way to directly punish switches and weaken the opposing team over the course of the game. Wood Hammer allows Chesnaught to hit Water-types such as Slowbro and Primarina and Ground-types like Swampert and Hippowdon. Roar helps mitigate some of Chesnaught's passiveness that makes it setup fodder for Swords Dance Scizor and Heracross by phazing them. This also works well in tandem with Spikes damage. Drain Punch gives Chesnaught a form of recovery while damaging Dark- and Steel-types like Bisharp and Cobalion. Leech Seed can be run instead to generate passive recovery for Chesnaught so it isn't overreliant on Synthesis, which greatly benefits Rocky Helmet sets particularly. Toxic can be run to punish Chesnaught's switch-ins such as Latias, Moltres, and Infernape to weaken them over time and prevent setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Mega Altaria from setting up.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>12 Speed EVs enable Chesnaught to outspeed Alomomola and potentially KO it with Wood Hammer if it's sufficiently weakened. Leftovers provides consistent passive recovery that can help it check threats like Krookodile without being forced to rely on recovery, while Rocky Helmet helps rack up more chip damage, aided by Spikes damage, on physical foes such as Choice Band Scizor that try to attack it or pivot out with U-turn.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Chesnaught can be switched into physical attackers that fail to substantially damage it, such as Bisharp, Krookodile, and Crawdaunt, to generate free turns as they're forced out. Chesnaught can take advantage of free turns to either heal itself or set up Spikes, which can punish the switches that Chesnaught forces by virtue of its typing and physical bulk. Synthesis should be used to maintain Chesnaught's HP if it's needed to check a threatening physical attacker such as Crawdaunt and Zeraora, but it has low PP, so being aware of this and preserving it for when it's necessary ensures Chesnaught has the best matchup against key physical wallbreakers. Chesnaught should utilize Drain Punch consistently due to its good neutral coverage against foes it switches into like Zeraora. It is also optimal to use it against foes such as Krookodile and Crawdaunt to prevent Chesnaught from being worn down through recoil if it can be avoided. Chesnaught is extremely passive and does not have much offensive presence, so it should be wary of letting setup sweepers in. However, if it is running Roar, it can phaze them. Roar can also be used to phaze entry hazard removers predicted to switch in, such as Moltres, Rotom-H, and Tentacruel, to prevent them from being able to remove Chesnaught's Spikes and force them to take more damage from entry hazards when switching back in. Leech Seed should also be used liberally if being run; Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery can help to keep Chesnaught healthy without being forced to rely on Synthesis as much. If a foe is predicted to switch out, using Leech Seed consistently helps to wear switch-ins down and punish them. Status can burden Chesnaught greatly, particularly Toxic poison and burn, so being wary of potential Toxic users like Alomomola and Blissey and Scald users such as Suicune and Empoleon can keep Chesnaught clear of status. Without cleric support, switching Chesnaught into these Pokemon, despite its typing and resistances, can cripple it for the remainder of the game.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Chesnaught fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that need a physically defensive Pokemon with a good matchup against several of the tier's most threatening Dark-types. It appreciates Flying-type checks such as Rotom-H, Nihilego, and Diancie greatly, as they can pivot into foes like Moltres and Togekiss that Chesnaught is forced out by and appreciate Chesnaught dealing with more specially defensive foes such as Blissey. Stealth Rock support from teammates such as the aforementioned Nihilego and Diancie as well as other options such as Hippowdon, Mega Steelix, and Mega Aggron helps Chesnaught by stacking residual damage with Spikes and further punishing switches. The latter two options as well as other Steel-types such as Scizor can help Chesnaught in the matchup against Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Mega Altaria and Latias too. Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Tentacruel, and Empoleon can take care of threatening Fire-types such as Infernape and Volcanion for Chesnaught and appreciate its ability to switch into several physical attackers such as Crawdaunt that these Pokemon struggle with. Due to Chesnaught's susceptibility to status, cleric support from teammates such as Togekiss, Blissey, and Florges is appreciated, allowing it to switch into Scald and Toxic more freely to check certain Water-types or set up Spikes. The latter two can also provide Wish support to make Chesnaught less reliant on Synthesis. Immediate offensive threats such as Latias, Choice Band Crawdaunt, and Nidoking can help to make up for Chesnaught's overall passivity, preventing it from letting in too many opposing threats or giving bulkier foes more opportunities to recover HP. Chesnaught offers these Pokemon Spikes support for chip damage on foes as a result; Bisharp is an especially good teammate, providing offensive presence, being able to deter Defog with Defiant, and taking advantage of Spikes support immensely. Due to Chesnaught's role as a Spikes setter, having other team options that can punish opposing entry hazard removal, such as Taunt Hydreigon, Electrium Z Latias, and Pursuit Mega Aerodactyl, is extremely useful.</p>"

  "Talonflame": {
    "overview": "<p>Talonflame is able to carve a small niche in the UU metagame as a threatening sweeper and revenge killer for offensive teams thanks to its great speed, excellent offensive typing, ability Gale Wings, and access to the boosting move Swords Dance. Its Fire / Flying typing allows it to hit most of the metagame for neutral damage and grants it key resistances to Fire-, Fighting-, and Fairy-type attacks as well as an immunity to the common Ground-type. Its ability Gale Wings allows Talonflame to hit faster threats with its Flying-type STAB move before being hit in return, letting it deal great damage to common Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Hydreigon with Brave Bird or a Supersonic Skystrike if Gale Wings hasn't been broken.</p> <p>Despite these attributes, however, losing 50% of its health to Stealth Rock damage means that Talonflame requires a lot of support and constant entry hazard removal in order to function as a reliable sweeper or revenge killer, since any form of damage automatically stops it from making use of its ability. Its defenses also leave much to be desired, which makes it susceptible to Pursuit trappers, priority users, and faster Pokemon that resist its Flying-type moves such as Mega Aerodactyl, Zeraora, and Mega Manectric. Talonflame is also weak to Water-, Electric-, and Rock-type moves, meaning that it will often be walled or forced out by common threats such as Rotom-H and Mega Slowbro. Furthermore, most Rock-type Pokemon in the tier resist both of its attacks and can threaten Talonflame with a 4x effective STAB move or cripple it with status, with examples being Mega Aerodactyl and Stealth Rock setters such as Rhyperior and Diancie. Lastly, Pokemon such as Infernape, Rotom-H, and Moltres give Talonflame competition as Fire-types due to their better secondary typing, more reliable abilities, ability to fit on more varied playstyles, or increased utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An Adamant nature provides Talonflame with more immediate offensive power but allows other fast threats such as offensive Starmie to outspeed it. This option notably secures an OHKO on Rotom-H with Supersonic Skystrike after Stealth Rock damage and a Swords Dance boost.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock damage will severely cut Talonflame's longevity, since it loses half of its health upon entry, limiting its opportunities to switch in and often forcing it to use Roost or switch out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Despite Talonflame's great speed and useful ability, it is still outpaced by common Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Latias if Gale Wings has been broken, and all of them can revenge kill Talonflame or force it out. This is equally the case with naturally faster threats such as Mega Manectric, Mega Aerodactyl, and Zeraora.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Prior damage makes Talonflame susceptible to priority users such as Bisharp and even some Scizor variants. Bisharp can 2HKO Talonflame with Sucker Punch, Talonflame does not appreciate being hit by a boosted Quick Attack or even Bullet Punch from offensive Scizor, and all Crawdaunt variants are able to OHKO it with Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Talonflame often struggles with the Electric-type Pokemon in the tier, since it isn't able to outspeed most of them or takes considerable amounts of damage without an unboosted attack. Rotom-H takes little damage from either of Talonflame's unboosted STAB moves and is able to 2HKO it with Volt Switch or pressure it with Toxic. Talonflame is unable to outspeed faster Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Zeraora; Mega Manectric is particularly troublesome, since its ability Intimidate reduces Talonflame's chances of sweeping even further. It must be noted, though, that Talonflame is able to break through Electric-types such as Zeraora and Rotom-H with a boosted Supersonic Skystrike if they've taken prior Stealth Rock damage, notably always being able to OHKO Zeraora and having a high chance to do the same to Rotom-H.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Most of the Rock-types in the tier resist both of Talonflame's STAB moves and can threaten it with their respective STAB or coverage moves. Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Talonflame and survives an unboosted Supersonic Skystrike, though the opponent must be wary of it taking prior damage. In return, Mega Aerodactyl is able to OHKO Talonflame with a STAB Stone Edge or even Pursuit trap it. Nihilego doesn't appreciate being hit by a boosted Supersonic Skystrike but is able to beat Talonflame one-on-one with a Gigavolt Havoc, Power Gem, or Thunderbolt. Rhyperior and Diancie can easily take any hit from Talonflame and OHKO it with their respective Rock-type STAB attack or cripple it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Quagsire and Mega Slowbro easily wall Talonflame, take minimum damage from either of its STAB moves, and are able to beat it with their Water-type moves in return. Some other Water-types such as Suicune and Alomomola can threaten and beat Talonflame in a one-on-one scenario but don't appreciate being hit by a boosted Supersonic Skystrike.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Brave Bird allows Talonflame to threaten the majority of the tier for neutral damage. A +2 Supersonic Skystrike allows it to heavily damage defensive Pokemon such as Gligar and Hippowdon and Water-types such as Suicune, Alomomola, and Primarina as well as OHKO all the Dragon-types in the tier. Flare Blitz enables Talonflame to break through the Steel-types that resist its Flying-type STAB move such as Mega Steelix, Doublade, and Empoleon, notably being able to 2HKO all of them after one Swords Dance. Flame Charge is another option that allows Talonflame to be a faster late-game sweeper, most notably outspeeding every common Choice Scarf user after one boost in its Speed stat, which is beneficial if Gale Wings has been broken. Its damage output is considerably lower than Flare Blitz's, though, which means it requires multiple Swords Dance boosts in order to do a good job sweeping. For example, Flame Charge Talonflame requires one Swords Dance boost in order to OHKO bulky Scizor and it requires two to even have a chance at 2HKOing the aforementioned Mega Steelix and Empoleon. Taunt allows Talonflame to set up in front of common passive Stealth Rock setters and Defog users such as Hippowdon and Gligar as well as clerics such as Florges and Sylveon. Alternatively, Roost lets Talonflame heal itself, which can also allow it to restore its health back to full and make use of another +1 priority Flying-type move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Flyinium Z allows Talonflame to use a 190-Base Power Supersonic Skystrike. With the combination of Supersonic Skystrike, one Swords Dance boost, and Stealth Rock damage, Talonflame is able to OHKO threats such as Suicune and Mega Aerodactyl and has a chance to do the same to Swampert, Rotom-H, and Zeraora after they've taken chip damage. Gale Wings grants Talonflame +1 to priority Flying-type moves when it is at full health, which allows it to revenge kill and sweep more reliably if it hasn't taken any prior damage.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to its great speed, offensive typing, and ability to wallbreak and revenge kill, Talonflame can be used at any stage of the battle. It functions best as a late-game sweeper, though, since its poor Attack stat sometimes stops it from reliably breaking through sturdier Pokemon such as Mega Slowbro and Alomomola without prior damage. Talonflame is able to force switches and wall passive threats such as Hippowdon, Gligar, and Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Florges when running Taunt; it must utilize these instances to set up with Swords Dance in order to break through bulkier Pokemon and sweep or, if running Flame Charge, to boost its Speed stat with the same goal.</p> <p>Preserving Talonflame's Gale Wings can be crucial during a battle, so good entry hazard control is necessary in order to use Talonflame to its full potential and preserve a reliable way of outspeeding faster threats. Find different moments in which Talonflame can safely come in and set up for a sweep or heavily damage opposing Pokemon. Bring it safely into the field by using slow pivots or after another Pokemon has fainted, since Talonflame's low bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock can heavily threaten its longevity. If Talonflame is running Roost, it can afford to come in on weaker attacks and even on entry hazards, as long as it's able to recover its health afterwards or doesn't require Gale Wings in order to sweep. If using Flame Charge, making use of the attack against passive threats, even if only for the Speed boost, which can be a defining moment in a battle, since Talonflame only requires using the move once in order to outspeed all common Choice Scarf users and faster Pokemon, without having to rely on Gale Wings any longer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Talonflame's wallbreaking capabilities, ability to wear down opposing teams, and ability to sweep late-game mean that it fits well on offensive builds, particularly hyper offense. Spikes support from the likes of Froslass and Klefki is appreciated for chipping down opposing teams and putting them in range of one of Talonflame's attacks. Klefki can also support Talonflame by using Thunder Wave against faster threats such as Crobat and Mega Aerodactyl, allowing Talonflame to be the fastest Pokemon on the field. A suicide lead such as Krookodile is particularly helpful, since it's able to set up Stealth Rock and stop the opposing team from doing the same with Taunt. Nihilego and Cobalion are other notable Stealth Rock setters that support Talonflame due to their great offensive presence and movepool that allow them to threaten a plethora of Defoggers such as Empoleon and Rotom-H. Due to Talonflame's weakness to Stealth Rock damage, hazard control is necessary, so spinners such as Starmie, Mega Blastoise, and Tsareena are preferable, since they're able to get rid of hazards on your side while keeping those on the opponent's side and still have great offensive presence against common Stealth Rock setters such as Hippowdon, Mega Steelix, and Mega Aggron. Spinblockers such as Gengar, Mimikyu, and Doublade and Defiant Pokemon such as Bisharp stop or punish the use of Rapid Spin or Defog from opposing teams, supporting Talonflame's goal of wearing down teams in order to sweep. Setup sweepers like Terrakion, Mega Altaria, and Lucario appreciate physically defensive walls such as Swampert, Gligar, and Doublade weakened. Special wallbreakers such as Primarina, Latias, and Hydreigon support Talonflame by threatening bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Quagsire and in return appreciate Talonflame's ability to threaten Steel-types. Choice Scarf Latias and Hydreigon are naturally decent partners, since they're able to beat Electric-type Pokemon that trouble Talonflame such as Rotom-H. They're also able to beat faster threats that Talonflame can't outspeed naturally, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Zeraora, and Mega Manectric. Scizor, Bisharp, and Mega Sharpedo fit well in hyper offense builds alongside Talonflame, since they can function as cleaners that appreciate Talonflame's ability to wear down opposing teams.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Florges has a niche in the UU metagame as a defensive Fairy-type thanks to its ability to compress roles well and offer different utility compared to its main competition in Sylveon. Instant recovery in Synthesis lets Florges directly come in on what it needs to check more easily, not fearing having to wait a second turn with Wish. Having this additional moveslot also lets it use options such as Toxic more effectively, giving it more versatility overall. Unfortunately, Florges's mediocre physical bulk leaves it competing with Sylveon, which takes on physical threats like Mega Aerodactyl and Infernape much more efficiently. Florges is also weaker, not having an ability to boost its damage as Sylveon does in Pixilate. Florges's low HP stat makes it a mediocre Wish passer compared to other users like Alomomola, Blissey, and Sylveon. Finally, Florges suffers from competition with other Fairy-types besides Sylveon, such as Primarina, Togekiss, and Mega Altaria, all of which bring secondary typings and much more power to teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>An offensive Calm Mind set can be run with Hidden Power Fire and a Babiri Berry to lure in and remove Scizor while also potentially running coverage moves like Psychic, but it is often outclassed by Togekiss, which has more power thanks to its access to Nasty Plot and Flamethrower, as well as a useful secondary typing. Defog can be used to remove entry hazards for your team, letting your Pokemon switch in more easily. However, Florges does struggle to use Defog against a number of common hazard setters and is easily overwhelmed as both a cleric and entry hazard remover.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: UU's large number of Steel-types all take advantage of Florges to some degree. Mega Aggron and Cobalion can set Stealth Rock and boost with Curse and Swords Dance, respectively, and Stakataka finds a chance to set up Trick Room. Scizor threatens Florges with Bullet Punch but must be cautious of Hidden Power Fire, so it cannot safely switch in. Cobalion can also fall to repeated uses of Moonblast because its special bulk is mediocre.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Poison-types can also use Florges for free turns easily, resisting its only STAB option and hitting hard with either neutral STAB attacks or super effective Poison-type moves. Tentacruel can safely remove entry hazards against Florges; Nidoking, Gengar, and Nihilego get opportunities to wallbreak or set hazards; Mega Beedrill gets more chances to pivot using U-turn; and Nidoqueen finds multiple opportunities to set up Toxic Spikes or Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Toxic Users</strong>: Many Toxic users such as Blissey, Empoleon, Klefki, and Alomomola can beat Florges by stalling it out of PP for Aromatherapy , taking little from Moonblast and eventually forcing it to switch. They can also use Florges for free turns to perform a variety of roles, including passing Wishes and removing or setting entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Florges's lackluster Defense stat leaves it weak to most neutral physical wallbreakers in the tier. Attackers like Mamoswine and Rockium Z Terrakion all threaten to KO it with just a little chip damage.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Moonblast is Florges's strongest STAB option, hitting threats such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, Mega Altaria, and unboosted Latias hard. Synthesis gives Florges instant reliable recovery, which is useful when compared to its competition as a cleric. Aromatherapy lets it remove status conditions from teammates. This is especially useful for clearing burns from the Steel-types and Toxic poison from the Water-types that are commonly run as teammates. Wish gives Florges another recovery option, letting it choose between healing itself or switching to a teammate, although its low HP stat compared to other clerics makes it worse at performing this job than its competition. Toxic is also an option in Florges's fourth slot for whittling down foes more efficiently, as well as allowing it to more easily check Calm Mind Latias. It should be noted that most of the defensive Pokemon Florges lures in are immune to Toxic or can circumvent it with either Regenerator or Natural Cure, however. Hidden Power Fire is an option for dealing with Scizor, which Florges lures in, 2HKOing any set while also making Florges less passive versus other Steel-types like Klefki and Bronzong, though it gives up the utility of either Wish or Toxic.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 HP and 252 Defense EVs with a Bold nature give Florges as much physical bulk as possible, giving it a better chance at switching into the physical Dark- and Fighting-types it wants to check. Leftovers provides passive recovery that helps Florges perform its role as a cleric for longer periods of time. Both abilities Florges has are completely worthless, so it doesn't matter which one you choose. A spread of 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 Spe can be used to outpace Bewear and Timid Primarina, which allows it to reliably beat them with Moonblast, the latter only if also carrying Toxic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful of preserving the PP of Aromatherapy. When running into a Toxic user that Florges can’t beat with Moonblast, such as Empoleon, Alomomola, or Blissey, it's best to save its ability to clear status and switch to a proper check instead of trying to brute force through Toxic. Therefore you should bring Florges in on Pokemon like Hydreigon and use Wish a lot early-game if Florges is not in dire need of healing. By using Wish as a buffer for your teammates, you can pivot into your wallbreakers more easily, knowing they will have some health restored. This also allows Florges to preserve the limited PP of Synthesis, which it is reliant on to better handle threats like Krookodile and Latias. Toxic should be used to whittle down Pokemon like Alomomola, Primarina, Volcanion, and Mega Slowbro, which it is unable to threaten otherwise with Moonblast. Toxic is also extremely important when combatting Calm Mind Latias, as the combination of poison and Moonblast allows Florges to beat it one on one. If running Hidden Power Fire then it should mostly be used when you expect Scizor to switch in, as it is often too risky to keep Florges on the field in case Scizor uses Bullet Punch.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Florges fits very well onto common balanced teams, letting it support the other members of a defensive core and keep offensive threats free of status. It can also support common sweepers on bulky offense such as Lucario, Calm Mind Chandelure, and Nasty Plot Infernape, which appreciate Wish support and Florges inviting in Steel-types for them to set up on. Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, Empoleon, and Cobalion support Florges well by checking the opposing Steel- and Poison-types that Florges has trouble with, as well as setting up Stealth Rock to give it more breathing room to find chances to use Aromatherapy or recover lost health. In return, Florges switches into Fighting-types like Infernape that would beat them and can recover their health if running Wish. Ground-types such as Swampert, Hippowdon, and Rhyperior check the Steel- and Poison-types that like to come in on Florges, and they also block pivots attempting to use Volt Switch on Florges to gain momentum. In return, Florges can heal their status conditions, preventing them from being worn down, as well as offer Wish support to make up for their lack of reliable recovery. Pursuit users in Choice Band Scizor, Mega Aerodactyl, and Krookodile make great partners as they can help trap and remove Gengar, which uses Florges as a free opportunity to wallbreak. It also takes pressure off Florges having to take on Latias, which it is unable to beat without Toxic. Water-types like Suicune and Mega Slowbro check threats such as Cobalion and Doublade that could use Florges to switch in to set up a Swords Dance while also appreciating Aromatherapy support from Florges. Hazard removal options like Tentacruel and Empoleon let Florges comfortably use Wish as its primary source of healing early-game than having to be overly reliant on Synthesis.</p>"

  "Doublade": {
    "overview": "<p>Doublade presents a unique pick for teams in the UU metagame as both a solid defensive pivot and a late-game sweeper. Doublade's defensive prowess stem from its monstrous Defense stat, access to Eviolite, and fantastic defensive typing. Its Ghost / Steel typing possesses nine resistances and three immunities, letting it check common threats such as Mega Aerodactyl, Latias, and Cobalion. Its respectable base 110 Attack and access to Swords Dance and STAB Shadow Sneak also make Doublade a formidable late-game sweeper, provided that its strong checks and counters have been weakened or removed. To counteract its fantastic physical bulk, however, Doublade's HP and Special Defense stats are much lower than it would prefer, leaving it to only rely on its typing to stomach strong special hits like Calm Mind Latias's +1 Devastating Drake. While it does possess a plethora of resistances, Doublade finds itself weak to common attacking types in Ground, Fire, and Dark, letting Pokemon such as Earthquake Terrakion, Fire Blast Mega Altaria, and Knock Off Scizor muscle past it after prior damage. Doublade's weakness to Dark-type moves also notably leaves it weak to Pursuit and Knock Off. The former often means that it is too weak to act as a defensive pivot, while the latter removes its Eviolite, hindering its overall bulk. Doublade also lacks any form of reliable recovery, meaning it is easily worn down by entry hazards and other damage accumulated throughout a match. Finally, Doublade has no use for its ability, No Guard, and it also makes opposing inaccurate moves like Fire Blast and Hydro Pump always hit.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Toxic is an option to cripple bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Swampert, though it is generally less effective than its other options. Pursuit can be used to punish Pokemon like Latias and Mega Beedrill switching out, but it is similar to Toxic in that coverage moves are usually superior options. A specially defensive RestTalk set with Toxic is a niche option on stall teams but lacks the utility that other options may offer.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Swampert, and Suicune fear little from an unboosted Doublade, threatening to burn it with Scald and neuter its effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Crawdaunt, Hydreigon, and Bisharp all deal huge damage to Doublade and resist its priority Shadow Sneak, though Crawdaunt and Bisharp must watch out for Sacred Sword and Hydreigon must be wary of Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Nidoking, Krookodile, and Hippowdon threaten Doublade with their super effective STAB moves and threaten it out.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers</strong>: Due to its poor special bulk, Doublade matches up badly against strong special attackers such as Mega Manectric, Volcanion, and Mega Pidgeot.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Doublade is quite dependent on its Eviolite to help cover its awful HP stat, making Knock Off users such as Mega Beedrill, Heracross, Alomomola, and Scizor rather annoying to deal with.</p>",

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance boosts Doublade's solid Attack stat, letting it act as a late-game sweeper when its checks are weakened. Due to Doublade's poor Speed stat, Gyro Ball possesses high Base Power against much of the UU metagame, specifically against common threats like Terrakion and Mega Aerodactyl, making it the preferred Steel-type STAB move in most cases. Iron Head is another strong option that provides more consistent damage as well as significantly more PP than Gyro Ball, letting Doublade threaten slow targets such as Alolan Muk and Amoonguss much more effectively. Shadow Claw is a decent Ghost-type STAB move, notably hitting Pokemon such as Scizor and Moltres harder than any of Doublade's other viable options. Sacred Sword lets Doublade hit Snorlax and Dark-types like Bisharp, Mega Sharpedo, and Crawdaunt for super effective damage, though it does further worsen its matchup against Pokemon such as Scizor and Tentacruel. Shadow Sneak helps alleviate Doublade's awful Speed stat, letting it take out weakened faster threats like Latias, Chandelure, and Starmie without being forced to stomach hard hits.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>240 HP EVs make Doublade as bulky as possible while minimizing Stealth Rock and burn damage, making the most of its fantastic defensive typing. Maximum investment in Attack along with a Brave nature lets Doublade hit as hard as possible in its pursuit of a potential late-game sweep. A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs also minimize Doublade's Speed stat, maximizing Gyro Ball's damage output. However, an Adamant nature is preferred if running Iron Head as its Steel-type STAB move, as it allows Doublade to outspeed notable Pokemon like Amoonguss and Slowbro, while a Brave nature does not. Eviolite pairs nicely with Doublade's HP investment and great defensive typing, making its Defense stat even more formidable while helping to shore up its low Special Defense.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Doublade in on Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Cobalion, and Scizor that it fares well against in order to either throw out a free attack or set up a Swords Dance. Weaken or remove Doublade's main counters in Water- and Dark-types like Alomomola and Hydreigon before attempting to sweep with Doublade late-game. Doublade can also be used as a revenge killer, picking off weakened foes like Latias and Starmie with Shadow Sneak. Scout for super effective coverage moves such as Mega Altaria's Fire Blast and Scizor's Knock Off to avoid unnecessary damage. Keep Doublade as healthy as possible if it is needed to check multiple foes or if it has a good chance to clean up late-game. Remove opposing entry hazards, specifically Spikes, with a teammate whenever possible, as they severely hinder Doublade's longevity. Doublade can also be used early- to mid-game to soften a Pokemon like Hydreigon with Gyro Ball to aid teammates and ease its attempts to sweep late-game. If possible, do not let Doublade get hit by Knock Off, as it relies on Eviolite for much of its bulk.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Doublade fits best on offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to pivot into attackers and act as a solid late-game sweeper with Swords Dance. Pokemon like Rotom-C, Mega Manectric, and Calm Mind Latias pair nicely with Doublade, as they can threaten the bulky Water-types that fare well against it. Fairy- and Fighting-types like Sylveon and Infernape make for good partners, checking opposing Dark-types. Sylveon also provides Wish support, helping to keep Doublade healthy throughout a match. Defog users such as Mandibuzz, Rotom-C, and Moltres can remove the Spikes that Doublade hates; Mandibuzz also appreciates Doublade's ability to counter its best offensive answer in Cobalion. Doublade and Hydreigon share incredible defensive synergy, with the combination resisting every type. Swampert and Nihilego can set up Stealth Rock, letting Doublade get certain KOs such as the OHKO on Latias with +2 Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock. Bulky Water-types like Slowbro and Suicune can absorb Fire- and Ground-type moves aimed at Doublade, also easing the pressure placed upon it by Mega Aerodactyl.</p>"

  "Barbaracle": {
    "overview": "<p>Barbaracle has carved itself a niche in the UnderUsed metagame as a potent Shell Smash sweeper due to its access to Liquidation and ability to viably run Rockium Z. Most teams are easily swept due to lack of preparation for Barbaracle, as they usually only have a couple decent checks for it and are more often than not unable to prevent it from gaining a good setup opportunity thanks to its great Defense and strong offensive typing. Barbaracle is also one of the tier's better stallbreakers, thanks to its ability to be a boosting Pokemon that can break past most of stall's typical answers like Quagsire. However, while Barbaracle is generally effective against most playstyles, it tends to struggle against most matchups where the opponent has one or two strong checks to Barbaracle and thus can dissuade it from ever setting up a Shell Smash. Furthermore, Barbaracle is a one-trick pony and requires its teammates to cater to it in order to function successfully in the tier. This reliance on being built around as well as its reliance on Shell Smash in order to become a potent threat makes Barbaracle a rather mediocre option when compared to other setup sweepers with more overall utility like Scizor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cross Chop is an option over Earthquake in order to hit most Steel-types harder due to the higher damage and the Tough Claws boost, but it fails to hit Doublade and Metagross super effectively and is also an inaccurate move. Barbaracle has access to a variety of other setup moves like Swords Dance and Bulk Up, but they are all inferior options when compared to Shell Smash.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Pokemon that can outspeed Barbaracle after a boost, notably Choice Scarf Infernape and Choice Scarf Latias, as well as Pokemon with strong priority attacks, like Scizor with Bullet Punch, can easily revenge kill Barbaracle as long as it isn't allowed to gain a free opportunity to use Shell Smash.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Each and every status condition in the game is extremely detrimental to Barbaracle. Poison cripples it and allows bulkier teams to stall it out; Alomomola, for example, is a good Toxic user that can stall out most of Barbaracle's HP through the use of Protect. Burn cuts Barbaracle's Attack in half, taking away a majority of Barbaracle's damage output; bulky Water-types like Suicune can use Scald to attempt to burn Barbaracle in order to prevent a sweep. Paralysis halves Barbaracle's Speed, ensuring it is easily revenge killed by most offensive Pokemon; Klefki gets a notable mention for having Prankster and thus being able to almost guarantee paralysis through priority Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure</strong>: Offensive pressure can prevent Barbaracle from gaining a free opportunity to click Shell Smash, thus making sure it never becomes a threat to most teams. Threatening it with a Pokemon that does enough damage to put it in range of a revenge killer or with a Pokemon that commonly spreads status conditions, such as Tentacruel, will ensure Barbaracle either is pressured enough to not Shell Smash or is unable to do too much damage even if it does end up doing so.</p>",

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Shell Smash allows Barbaracle to act as an effective sweeper, boosting all of Barbaracle's offensive stats at the expense of lowering its defenses. Stone Edge is Barbaracle's main STAB attack, sporting high damage output despite being inaccurate. Liquidation is Barbaracle's second STAB attack, having high damage output as well as perfect accuracy. Grass Knot allows Barbaracle to hit the likes of Swampert, Seismitoad, and Quagsire for super effective damage, preventing them from stopping Barbaracle from sweeping. Earthquake is also an option, as it allows Barbaracle to hit valuable targets, such as Empoleon, Metagross, and Doublade, for super effective damage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Rockium Z is used to give Barbaracle an extremely powerful nuke to break past walls, such as Alomomola and Suicune, without the need for excessive chip damage, and it also allows Barbaracle to hit targets it normally would with Stone Edge without risking the miss chance; such targets include Volcanion and Latias. Tough Claws is the chosen ability, as it boosts the damage of Liquidation and Grass Knot and is more beneficial than other abilities, as Sniper is inconsistent and luck dependent and Pickpocket doesn't work with Barbaracle's Rockium Z. The given EVs and nature allow Barbaracle to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Mienshao while also ensuring Barbaracle does as much damage as possible.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>The first thing to be done when starting a match with Barbaracle is seeing what Barbaracle checks are present and if Barbaracle has any opportunities to set up. If Barbaracle's checks are many and are unable to be removed without at the same time still ensuring Barbaracle is able to set up, Barbaracle can be used as a sacrificial lamb in order to break past certain Pokemon through the use of Continental Crush for its teammates to clean afterwards. Barbaracle should only be sent in whenever an opportunity to set up and sweep is available. When a sweeping opportunity is taken and Barbaracle has already used Shell Smash, it is important to evaluate the use of Continental Crush, as sometimes it may be better to save it for targets that require the extra damage in order to be KOed, such as Suicune and Alomomola. If up against stall teams, typically one would attempt to use Barbaracle to either completely sweep through once anything bulky enough to take a hit, such as Mega Aggron, is weakened to a point whereby Barbaracle can KO it or try to weaken as many Pokemon as possible in order to clean up with another teammate.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon with access to entry hazards make for excellent Barbaracle teammates, as Barbaracle greatly benefits from the chip damage in order to ease a sweep later on. Such Pokemon include Klefki, Nidoking, and Tentacruel. Pokemon that can set up Aurora Veil or dual screens, such as Alolan Sandslash and Klefki, can allow Barbaracle to set up much more easily. Cleaners and other sweepers, such as Mega Sharpedo and Cobalion, can capitalize on Barbaracle's wallbreaking capabilities to sweep past the remaining foes. Choice Scarf Latias is an amazing Barbaracle teammate due to its access to Healing Wish, ensuring Barbaracle can attempt to sweep multiple times in a match. Barbaracle tends to have difficulty being brought into the match freely, making VoltTurn users, such as Magneton, which also traps and removes Scizor, one of Barbaracle's best checks, and Mega Beedrill, which tends to lure in Gligar and Mega Aerodactyl, which Barbaracle can take advantage of to set up, good partners. Memento users, namely Choice Scarf Chandelure, also alleviate this issue.</p>"

Aurorus's typing allows it to deal with most Defog users, such as Mega Altaria, Gligar, and Hydreigon, and its support movepool, featuring Encore and Thunder Wave, allows it to play around those it can't beat. However, an atrocious defensive typing coupled with low Speed leaves Aurorus extremely vulnerable to a lot of Pokemon in the metagame, so it is unable to do much other than function as a one-dimensional suicide lead for Aurora Veil teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>None whatsoever.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Hippowdon and Gigalith can remove hail and stop Aurora Veil from being set up, although the former should avoid taking on Aurorus directly.

Similarly, Infernape has an easy time beating Aurorus and will prevent Alolan Sandslash from setting up Aurora Veil due to either being faster and OHKOing it with a STAB move if it carries a Choice Scarf or through strong Fighting-type priority if it carries any other item.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Although they don't stop Aurorus from doing its job, Pokemon like Cobalion, Mega Aggron, Metagross and many more have an easy time beating Aurorus one-on-one.

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock is used as soon as possible to help Aurorus's teammates sweep by taking a little of the foe's health upon switch-in, which can put some Pokemon in KO range and break potential Focus Sashes. Freeze-Dry is a STAB move that hits Water-types such as Mantine, Swampert, and Primarina super effectively. Hidden Power Fire allows Aurorus to KO Scizor and is generally used as a coverage move against Steel-types. Encore stops opposing Pokemon from freely removing Stealth Rock or setting up on Aurorus by locking them into a certain move, and it can also be used to create setup opportunities for teammates. Common targets of Encore include Mega Aggron and Klefki. Blizzard can be used over Hidden Power Fire, but although it hits harder than Freeze-Dry and will never miss in hail, it leaves Aurorus unable to beat Scizor. Thunder Wave can be used over Encore to cripple faster threats such as Cobalion and Infernape.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread coupled with a Timid nature allows Aurorus to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding Modest Primarina. Snow Warning is necessary to let Alolan Sandslash set Aurora Veil and help Aurorus deal with opposing Focus Sash users in a single turn. A Focus Sash is used to more reliably set up Stealth Rock at lead. A Modest nature can be used to deal more damage, but it comes at the cost of Primarina outspeeding Aurorus.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Aurorus should be used as a lead and set up Stealth Rock as early as possible. Against opposing leads that carry Taunt, such as Azelf, attacking them is generally recommended. Lead Kabutops should be OHKOed immediately through a combination of Freeze-Dry and hail; if it attacks, it is unlikely that Aurorus will set up Stealth Rock but neither will your opponent. If it opts to set up Stealth Rock, Aurorus's Focus Sash will remain intact, and it can still set up Stealth Rock on its partners; Alolan Sandslash can likely remove the Stealth Rock on your side of the field later. Hidden Power Fire should be used to OHKO Scizor if possible, as Aurora Veil-based teams often lack a good way of dealing with it if setting up Aurora Veil fails. Encore is mainly used to lock opposing Defog and Rapid Spin users into these moves, forcing them to switch out or risk becoming setup fodder. This helps in keeping up Stealth Rock and generating setup opportunities for Aurorus's teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Alolan Sandslash should be on every team with Aurorus, as its ability Slush Rush allows it to outspeed many Pokemon and set up Aurora Veil reliably. It also beats many common Defog users such as Gligar and Hydreigon, helping it keep up the Aurora Veil. Life Orb Swords Dance Scizor is also an especially good teammate and almost mandatory on any Aurora Veil team, as its boosted moves allow it to be an incredible wallbreaker and cleaner, and it can revenge kill some of the bigger threats to hyper offense such as Mega Aerodactyl. Threatening setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Latias, Dragon Dance Haxorus, and Nasty Plot Salazzle make for great partners, as they have an easy time setting up behind Aurora Veil and become hard to stop once they get rolling. Bulkier threats such as Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune and Swords Dance Doublade also profit from Aurora Veil, as it allows them to set up to extremely threatening levels with ease.</p>"

It also has access to Wish and Heal Bell, which allows it to keep its teammates healthy throughout a match and get rid of potentially damaging status conditions. Additionally, it can take most unboosted special attacks due to its superb special bulk and can retaliate with a strong Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice. However, some special attackers such as Volcanion and Primarina can 2HKO Sylveon in spite of its bulk. Latias in particular can beat Sylveon with a combination of Calm Mind and Roost. Sylveon is further held back by its mediocre base 65 Defense stat, which means it is 2HKOed by some physical attackers, such as Choice Band Infernape and Terrakion, even with maximum investment. Furthermore, it also has weaknesses to common Poison- and Steel-type moves from the likes of Scizor and Nidoking. It also faces competition from Florges, which trades a lower Defense stat and weaker attacks for more Speed and access to a one-turn recovery move.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hidden Power Fire is an alternative option over Heal Bell that can be used to 2HKO bulky Scizor and OHKO offensive Scizor.

In addition, common hazard setters such as Klefki, Tentacruel, and Empoleon can take advantage of Sylveon's inability to meaningfully damage them as an opportunity to set up their hazards, thus limiting Sylveon's ability to be effective later in the game.</p>",

Pixilate allows Sylveon to hit as hard as possible with Hyper Voice.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Come in on a Pokemon that Sylveon walls, such as Mega Sceptile or Hydreigon, and use Wish if you need to replenish the HP of Sylveon or use Hyper Voice to chip down frailer switch-ins like Mega Beedrill if this is not the case. Be careful of using Protect, however, as it could allow offensive threats such as Nidoking and Scizor to switch in freely, the latter being able to use it as a setup opportunity. Sylveon should also not nonchalantly use Wish at every opportunity, as it has limited PP. while its teammates may benefit from the recovery, it is Sylveon's only form of effective recovery. Lastly, be careful not to let Sylveon take stronger physical attacks such as those from Mamoswine, Terrakion, and Choice Band Infernape due to its middling Defense stat.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Sylveon generally fits on more bulky or balanced teams that appreciate that Wish support and its useful defensive typing. Bulky Water-types such as Swampert, Mantine, and Suicune can take on Steel-types such as Mega Steelix and Klefki as well as Fire-types. In return, Sylveon takes on prominent Dragon-types like Hydreigon and Latias while also keeping them healthy with Wish, something the aforementioned bulky Water-types would otherwise struggle with due to their lack of recovery or weakness to entry hazards. Tentacruel is especially good, since it resists Poison- and Steel-type attacks and can keep entry hazards off the field, thus taking pressure off Sylveon to keep itself healthy. Sylveon also likes Psychic-types such as Celebi, Mew, and Latias, which can get rid of Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Tentacruel. Steel-types such as Mega Steelix, Mega Aggron, Doublade, and Scizor make good partners because they resist both of Sylveon's weaknesses, enjoy Sylveon's ability to keep them healthy with Wish and stomach many physical attacks, which Sylveon struggles with due to its low Defense stat. Doublade, in particular, can also take on the likes of Cobalion and Terrakion, which can overwhelm and remove Sylveon. Offensive Pokemon such as Latias and Cobalion like Sylveon's ability to keep them healthy and cure them of status like poison and burn that limit their sweeping capabilities. Rock-types like Mega Aerodactyl, Rhyperior, and Nihilego also make great partners, as they are able to take on the Fire-types like Rotom-H and Moltres that Sylveon is unable to break past, and the latter can even stall it out of Heal Bell PP through the combination of Toxic and Pain Split. These partners also appreciate Sylveon making up for their lack of recovery, with this only applying to Mega Aerodactyl if it opts to run an all-out attacker set.</p>"

  "Klefki": {
    "overview": "<p>Klefki's massive utility movepool alongside its Prankster ability makes it a premier support Pokemon in the UU metagame and the best user of Spikes by far. Its amazing defensive typing alongside access to moves like Thunder Wave and Magnet Rise allows it to very adequately check top-tier threats, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Latias, Mega Beedrill, and Hydreigon. Klefki also possesses a lot of flexibility in terms of which moves it can opt to run, which, alongside its ability to set up Spikes, allows it to fit very comfortably on offensive and balanced teams alike. Unfortunately, Klefki lacks recovery, which in tandem with its subpar bulk leaves it prone to being worn down, thus preventing it from reliably checking foes it aims to check from time to time. Klefki also lacks an offensive presence, which leaves it reliant on hitting foes super effectively to avoid being too passive.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dazzling Gleam is an option over Play Rough to more heavily damage the likes of Krookodile, Bewear, and Crawdaunt. However, it doesn't allow Klefki to damage Latias, which often uses Calm Mind, as reliably. Hidden Power Fire is another option for luring in and heavily damaging Scizor. However, it also isn't often preferred due to leaving Klefki unable to do anything to Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo. A dual screens set with Light Clay is an option for giving Klefki a way of reliably supporting setup sweepers, but it is usually less consistently useful than the standard set. Defog can be run, allowing Klefki to take advantage of Prankster to remove entry hazards, but it is hard to fit on the set and removes the Spikes Klefki sets up as well as opposing hazards. Flash Cannon can be used as a Steel-type STAB attack, but it will almost never cover as many threats as either Fairy-type STAB moves or Foul Play.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Although they fear Thunder Wave, Fire-types like Chandelure, Moltres, and Volcanion resist Klefki's Fairy-type STAB moves and can threaten to OHKO it with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types such as Krookodile and Mamoswine are immune to Thunder Wave and can threaten Klefki with their super effective STAB attacks. Zygarde-10% is particularly troublesome, due to its ability to ignore Magnet Rise with Thousand Arrows.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Klefki is easily shut down by Taunt users like Hydreigon, which, upon preventing it from using Spikes or Thunder Wave, can apply heavy offensive pressure.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Klefki's lack of an offensive presence usually prevents it from beating most defensive Pokemon in one-on-one situations, even with Toxic. Defensive Pokemon that are immune to poison, such as Amoonguss and Mega Aggron, are particularly troublesome due to their ability to tank Klefki's hits without fear of being worn down by its status moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types like Mega Manectric and Rotom-H can freely switch into Thunder Wave and will often take minimal damage from Klefki's Fairy-type STAB attacks, which allows them to apply heavy offensive pressure to Klefki or use it as setup bait. All fear Toxic, however. Magneton is particularly annoying for Klefki to deal with, as its ability Magnet Pull allows it to trap and remove Klefki from play entirely.</p>",

      "Support": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Spikes gives Klefki a way of supporting its teammates with entry hazards, punishing grounded foes that switch in and out of play. Thunder Wave cripples fast offensive threats like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Pidgeot, and Talonflame with paralysis and gives Klefki a way of easily spreading status. Toxic cripples defensive Pokemon that may try stalling Klefki out, such as Hippowdon and Alomomola, and is also good for crippling various setup sweepers like Latias. Magnet Rise grants Klefki a temporary immunity to Ground-type moves that can allow it to ease its matchup against Ground-types like Krookodile and Gligar. Play Rough is Klefki's best source of damage against Latias, and it is also useful for pressuring Fighting- and Dark-type Pokemon like Terrakion and Hydreigon. Foul Play is also an option for punishing physically offensive Pokemon that stay in on Klefki, such as Scizor and Mega Beedrill. However, it generally isn't worth it due to leaving Klefki walled by Dark-types, and Klefki is also very reliant on Scizor setting up in order to actually pressure it with the attack. Lastly, Reflect can be used to aid Klefki's teammates in setting up or attacking against physically offensive Pokemon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Heavy investment in HP alongside maximum investment in Special Defense with a positive nature nearly maximizes Klefki's special bulk, allowing it to check threats like Togekiss, Latias, and Hydreigon as reliably as possible. 8 EVs are invested in Speed to allow Klefki to outrun Mega Pidgeot and everything slower after paralysis. A Careful nature is used to further bolster Klefki's special bulk while preventing Play Rough's power from dropping. Leftovers gives Klefki a form of passive recovery, providing it with decent longevity. Prankster is the preferred ability, giving Klefki's status moves a +1 boost in priority and securing its niche as a reliable Spikes setter.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Klefki should look to set up Spikes early-game, as this will effectively deal good chip damage to foes throughout the course of the match. If setting up Spikes early on proves to be a monumental task, Klefki should try coming in on a foe that it can adequately tank hits from, such as Choice-locked Hydreigon or Togekiss, as this will create an opportunity to easily set at least a layer or two. Once Spikes is set, Klefki should be preserved for later on instead of being sacrificed, as it can work as an emergency check to various fast sweepers due to priority Thunder Wave and Toxic. Thunder Wave should be used against offensive threats that Klefki can tank at least one hit from, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Pidgeot, Latias, and Starmie, as the paralysis will cripple them for the remainder of the match. Due to Klefki's passive nature, it should look to use Toxic to cripple various Pokemon that try setting up on it like Latias or, if it isn't using Toxic, switch out into a Pokemon capable of taking care of the sweeper it has invited in so as not to generate more free turns. Klefki should only look to attack against threats that it's capable of adequately damaging, such as Mega Sceptile, or, if it's using Foul Play, against Pokemon that try using it as setup bait, such as Scizor. If Magnet Rise is being run, Klefki should use it against Ground-types like Krookodile and Nidoqueen and Pokemon that often carry Ground-type coverage, like Mega Aerodactyl, in order to blanket check them and reliably set up Spikes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to its ability to cripple fast threats with Thunder Wave while easily setting Spikes, Klefki is the main component of Spikes offense and usually fits best on offensive builds as a result. Rapid Spin support from the likes of Tentacruel and Starmie prevents Klefki from having to set Spikes more than once while also allowing it to check various threats more reliably due to refraining from taking chip damage. Cleaners like Mega Sharpedo and Zygarde-10% are fantastic Pokemon to pair with Klefki, as they can utilize its Spikes support to easily finish off weakened teams. Wallbreakers like Nidoking, Choice Band Scizor, and Terrakion appreciate the Spikes support Klefki provides them with, while setup sweepers like Infernape and Cobalion also enjoy utilizing Spikes to break past foes more easily. Water-types like Suicune, Swampert, and Mega Blastoise can switch into the Fire- and Steel-types that Klefki generally hates dealing with, while they in return appreciate its ability to switch into Grass-type attacks. Klefki appreciates Ground-type switch-ins if it isn't running Magnet Rise, which makes Flying-types like Talonflame and Moltres and Grass-types like Mega Sceptile and Celebi good options as teammates. Latias and Hydreigon have particularly good synergy with Klefki, as both resist or are immune to the types that Klefki is weak to, and they appreciate its Spikes and Thunder Wave support and ability to come in on Fairy-, Dragon-, and Bug-type attacks.</p>"

  "Zygarde-10%": {
    "overview": "<p>Zygarde-10%'s high Speed stat combined with its access to Thousand Arrows makes it a potent attacker, being able to threaten many common Pokemon in the tier such as Latias, Cobalion, and Infernape. It also has access to Extreme Speed to pick off weakened threats. However, while its Speed stat is solid, it is also where it falls short. Zygarde-10% still loses to many of the faster Mega Evolutions in the tier such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Manectric, the latter being a Pokemon it cannot check despite its Ground typing. Zygarde-10% also has to risk Speed ties with Pokemon such as Starmie and Raikou, and it is vulnerable to priority moves from the likes of Scizor and Mamoswine due to its poor bulk. Even with a Choice Band, Zygarde-10% still falls short of many KOs on Pokemon such as Primarina and even Cobalion. Zygarde-10% is also walled by common defensive threats such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Alomomola, meaning it has to lock itself into Outrage or predict well with Toxic to gain any leverage against these type of teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Zygarde-10% can use Iron Tail to surprise Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Sylveon, but it is usually not worth dropping the ability to cripple Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Alomomola. Zygarde-10% can use a Dragon Dance set with Dragonium Z or Groundium Z under certain circumstances, but this is hindered by its low bulk.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Zygarde-10% is not strong enough to break physical walls such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Gligar, Suicune, and Alomomola without using Toxic on the switch or locking itself into Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Zygarde-10% is frail, meaning many of the faster attackers in the tier OHKO it with ease. Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Beedrill, Mega Manectric, Mega Pidgeot, and Choice Scarf users such as Latias and Infernape can pick it off. Mega Sceptile can switch into Thousand Arrows and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Zygarde-10%'s poor bulk makes it vulnerable to priority. Mamoswine can pick it off easily with Ice Shard, though it should watch out for Extreme Speed. Scizor and Crawdaunt can also force it out with their strong priority attacks.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Can Tank a Hit</strong>: Zygarde-10% is strong with a Choice Band, but not strong enough. Many Pokemon in the tier such as Primarina, Mega Altaria, Togekiss, Mega Aggron, and Mega Blastoise can easily tank a Thousand Arrows and OHKO Zygarde-10% in return. Zygarde-10% is also forced to lock itself into Outrage if it wants to deal with Pokemon such as Heracross and Hydreigon, placing it in awkward positions.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thousand Arrows is very difficult to switch into when backed by Choice Band. No Pokemon being immune to it and few resisting it means that Zygarde-10% can simply use this attack and do serious damage. Outrage is Zygarde-10%'s secondary STAB move, being much more powerful and 2HKOing Pokemon such as Swampert and Jellicent on the switch after Stealth Rock damage. It also complements Toxic nicely, since it allows Zygarde-10% to defeat defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Alomomola, and Slowbro if they have been poisoned. Extreme Speed has decent power behind a Choice Band, allowing Zygarde to pick off weakened threats such as Mega Beedrill and +1 Mega Sharpedo. While Toxic is the preferred option in the final slot, since it improves Zygarde-10%'s matchup against bulkier teams, Earthquake can be used to OHKO Primarina and Cobalion after Stealth Rock, as Thousand Arrows either is a roll or fails to KO them. It also lets Zygarde-10% 2HKO Sylveon on the switch, which can avoid the 2HKO from Thousand Arrows and shrug off a Toxic with Heal Bell.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Zygarde-10% sits at a solid Speed tier, so it should maximize its Speed with 252 EVs and a Jolly nature to Speed tie with Raikou, Starmie, and Azelf and outpace Pokemon such as Infernape and Latias. The remaining EVs are invested into Attack with a Choice Band so Zygarde-10% can hit as hard as possible, boosting its mediocre base 100 Attack stat. Sadly, Zygarde-10% is stuck with a useless ability in Aura Break.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Zygarde-10% should take advantage of Pokemon such as Empoleon and Klefki to spam Thousand Arrows. However, there are a few instances where Zygarde-10% will use its other moves. Outrage is used to pick up OHKOs and 2HKOs on Pokemon such as Heracross and Swampert. It also forces defensive Suicune to use Rest. Extreme Speed can force out or wear down the many fast Mega Evolutions in the tier such as Mega Manectric, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Sceptile. If the opponent has a Pokemon that walls Zygarde-10%, such as Hippowdon or Alomomola, Toxic should be used to cripple it. Zygarde-10% should be played very aggressively in such matchups because it cannot get any leverage otherwise. Against more offensive teams, spamming Thousand Arrows is not a bad idea due to their lack of good Pokemon that resist it and reliance on defensive pivots that lack recovery or simply cannot switch in such as Swampert and Amoonguss, respectively.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Spikes support from Klefki is greatly appreciated because it allows Zygarde-10% to secure the OHKO on Cobalion and lets Zygarde-10% play safer against more defensive teams because it does not have to risk overpredicting with a Steel-type staying in expecting a Toxic. This set fits best on more offensive teams, as they complement Klefki the best. Toxic Spikes support is still an option, however, so Zygarde-10% does not have to rely on using Toxic too much or using Earthquake at all. Nihilego and Tentacruel are viable options for this. Zygarde-10% often has trouble getting in because most Pokemon it takes advantage of threaten it back too: Empoleon can use Scald, Klefki can use Dazzling Gleam, and Latias can use Draco Meteor. Because of this, VoltTurn support makes it much easier for Zygarde-10% to get in. Mega Beedrill is solid, since it can also set up Toxic Spikes and get Zygarde-10% in on Pokemon that Mega Beedrill usually lures in such as Cobalion and Doublade. Rotom-C is a solid teammate as well, spreading burns and chipping at Pokemon such as Latias and Mega Altaria for Zygarde-10%. Mega Manectric is similarly a good teammate, but both Pokemon have trouble dealing with Hippowdon and Swampert. Finally, while Toxic is a way for Zygarde-10% to deal with its defensive answers, it is not always practical. Wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Cobalion, Infernape, and Heracross can pressure physical walls.</p>"

  "Diancie": {
    "overview": "<p>Diancie finds its niche in the tier by making use of its useful Rock / Fairy typing to check Dragon- and Flying-types. It can take advantage of its typing, bulk, and decent offensive stats to punish Defoggers like Hydreigon and Moltres and keep Stealth Rock up. Diancie can also act as a cleric, making use of the safe turns it gets on the field to aid its partners. It can also prevent Pokemon such as Latias from setting up on it with its STAB moves or the threat of Toxic. Its typing and bulk allow Diancie to take hits such as Moltres's Supersonic Skystrike. However, its low HP, weaknesses to common types such as Water, Ground, and Steel, lack of reliable recovery, and poor Speed make it easily checked by common Pokemon in the tier like Primarina, Mamoswine, Scizor, and Cobalion. Diancie also doesn't have great offensive stats and can't threaten Steel-types efficiently, meaning it faces competition from Rock-type Stealth Rock users that aren't as passive, such as Nihilego.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Power Gem can be run over Diamond Storm due to it having more PP and punishing Defoggers such as Mantine, Togekiss, and Moltres more reliably. However, Diamond Storm is still usually preferred due to its greater damage output against Calm Mind users and specially bulky Pokemon and great secondary effect. Rock Tomb is an option to defeat Togekiss more easily, as Diancie can eventually outspeed and hit it before it can use Roost. A set with Diamond Storm and Heal Bell and without Toxic is also possible, compressing the roles of a Stealth Rock user and a cleric while not being harmless versus Flying-types and Scizor lacking Roost, although it comes with the drawback of a worse Latias and Togekiss matchup. Protect can be run to maximize Leftovers recovery as well as scout what move Pokemon with Choice items lock themselves into, such as Hydreigon, Scizor, and Krookodile. However, forgoing Toxic or Heal Bell for this isn't the common choice, as playing Diancie safely is usually enough to keep it healthy. Earth Power can be run to punish common Diancie switch-ins such as Empoleon, Nidoking, and Stakataka, but keep in mind that it lowers Diancie's utility, as Diancie has to run it over Toxic or Heal Bell.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, Scizor, and Empoleon can threaten Diancie with their STAB attacks and usually OHKO it, with some of them being able to switch into Diancie's attacks with no big problems. Empoleon is especially troublesome, as it can switch into Diancie and remove Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Hippowdon, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen can hit Diancie with super effective STAB moves and don't care much about Diancie's attacks. The latter two are also immune to Toxic, and they can all set entry hazards against it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Amoonguss doesn't mind Moonblast and can take advantage of Diancie switching out to use Spore. Tsareena can threaten Diancie out with Power Whip, Rotom-C can severely damage it with Leaf Storm, and Celebi doesn't mind status and can start setting up as Diancie switches out, although none of them switch in as well.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Rest Suicune can switch into Diancie reliably and hit it hard with Scald, potentially burning it and making Diamond Storm a lot weaker. Meanwhile, offensive Water-types like Volcanion and Crawdaunt can't necessarily switch into Diancie, but they can use their offensive capabilities to force it out with their strong Water-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, Amoonguss, and Bronzong, don't really mind Toxic or Diancie's offensive moves and can take advantage of it.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock punishes other teams' switches and is vital for any competitive team, and Heal Bell, which is mainly appreciated by bulkier teams, supports Diancie's teammates as well as itself by healing status. Diancie is able to get opportunities to easily make use of both these moves against foes such as Rotom-H and Hydreigon. Diamond Storm is a Rock-type STAB attack that hits specially bulky Pokemon like Nihilego and Tentacruel hard and lets Diancie better check threatening Flying- and Fire-types such as Moltres and Rotom-H. Also, a +2 Defense boost from Diamond Storm lets Diancie better take hits from Mega Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and even Cobalion and makes it difficult to take down overall. Toxic punishes bulky switch-ins to Diancie such as Hippowdon as well as setup sweepers like Latias that neither Moonblast nor Diamond Storm punish hard enough. Toxic also allows Diancie to pressure Flying-types like Togekiss without having to worry about the PP of Diamond Storm.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Diancie's spread lets it be a good special wall, dealing with Pokemon such as Mega Manectric well while also helping it wall the Pokemon it's supposed to, such as Hydreigon, Rotom-H, and Kyurem. A Calm nature enhances its special bulk, while Sassy is used when Diamond Storm is part of the set so it isn't weakened. Meanwhile, Leftovers is used to passively get health back, help Diancie fulfill its goal as a wall, and improve its longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Diancie in on resisted or weak hits and on Dragon- or Flying-types that it can beat, such as Hydreigon and Moltres, and use such turns to set Stealth Rock early, fire off attacks, or heal status ailments. Use Toxic when you expect bulky foes such as Hippowdon to switch in. Diancie doesn't have a reliable recovery move, so don't make reckless plays like setting Stealth Rock against foes that threaten Diancie, such as Slowbro and Amoonguss, as you can end up with a weakened and inefficient Diancie. If not running Heal Bell, watch out for status, as that cripples Diancie's longevity. Also, beware of strong wallbreakers that can come in for free on Diancie, such as Nidoqueen. In such scenarios, the best course of action for Diancie is usually double switching out. Don't stay in with Diancie on Pokemon that can set up and aren't really threatened by it, such as Scizor, as Diancie gives free turns away to them. Use Heal Bell to support its partners on optimal turns, such as when faced with a Pokemon that Diancie walls. Be careful to conserve the PP of Heal Bell and Diamond Storm throughout the match.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Diancie fits well on balance and bulky offense builds that value its resistances and role compression. Diancie struggles with Steel-types, as they don't really mind its STAB moves or Toxic and can even keep Stealth Rock off the field in the case of Empoleon. Because of this, Pokemon that deal with them, such as Rotom-H and Infernape, are appreciated. Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Scizor, and Cobalion appreciate Diancie's ability to take on Fire- and Flying-types, such as Moltres and Togekiss. Wallbreakers enjoy how Diancie can set Stealth Rock up to help them secure KOs. In particular, Tsareena and Moltres pair well with Diancie, as they can break bulky Ground- and Steel-types, such as Hippowdon and Mega Aggron. Ground-immune Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Moltres, and Hydreigon support Diancie, as a myriad of Ground-types can force it out, such as Nidoking and Hippowdon. They also deserve a special note for resisting Grass-type moves, which also threaten Diancie. Pokemon that don't like status appreciate being paired with Diancie. For example, Slowbro has good defensive synergy with Diancie due to its great physical bulk and resistances to Water and Steel, and it appreciates Diancie's resistance to Dark. Partners with Wish, such as Alomomola, can help circumvent Diancie's lack of a reliable recovery move. Allies such as Mantine, Rotom-H, and Tentacruel help Diancie exert its role, removing the entry hazards that really hinder its Leftovers recovery.</p>"

This is bolstered by its access to Nasty Plot and All-Out Pummeling, which further increases Hoopa's wallbreaking potential and allows it to muscle past would-be checks such as Alolan Muk and Blissey with ease after some mild chip damage. Hoopa also boasts impressive 80 / 130 special bulk, allowing it to take on the likes of Latias and Suicune. However, Hoopa's greatest strength, its Ghost / Psychic typing, is also its greatest weakness, giving it a 4x weakness to Pursuit, thus limiting its matchup versus offensively inclined teams. In addition, Hoopa's poor Speed and Defense stats leave it forced out by common physical attackers, such as Cobalion and Infernape. Finally, Hoopa faces stiff competition as an offensive Ghost-type from the likes of Mimikyu and Gengar, which offer better Speed and utility than Hoopa. Other Psychic-types like Celebi, Latias, and Starmie also offer better Speed and utility and less vulnerability to Pursuit trapping. Hoopa's ability, Magician, also is useless in every situation.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Taunt can be used over Substitute to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola and Blissey, but Hoopa can already set Substitute on most of these anyway, so it's generally not worth it. An Aguav Berry can be used to provide Hoopa with a way to recover health, allowing it to pivot into weaker specially offensive Pokemon better. This also allows Hoopa to potentially take advantage of its ability Magician, but the loss of power without a Z-Move leaves it unable to break specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Hoopa's 4x weakness to Pursuit leaves it easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl, but they cannot switch directly into Hoopa.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Hoopa's low physical bulk leaves it KOed by stronger threats such as Choice Band Infernape and Terrakion, though they cannot switch in.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Hoopa's 4x weakness to Dark-type moves such as Knock Off and Dark Pulse leave it easily picked off by the likes of Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Mega Sharpedo, though they can't come in directly.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Hoopa is easily revenge killed by Ghost-types such as Gengar, Mimikyu, and Shadow Sneak Doublade.

Substitute gives safer setup opportunities and prevents Hoopa from being worn down by status conditions, and it can be used on a free turn or on a forced switch. Psyshock can be used over Substitute to break bulky Pokemon like Blissey and Calm Mind Suicune harder, but this makes Hoopa easily revenge killed by common Pursuit users like Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack and a Modest nature give Hoopa as much power and breaking potential as possible. 252 Speed EVs let Hoopa outspeed threats such as Scizor, Crawdaunt, and most defensive Pokemon such as Mantine and defensive Togekiss. 4 Special Defense EVs are used so unboosted Suicune never breaks Hoopa's Substitute. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Primarina, but since at +2, Modest Hoopa has a 50% chance to OHKO Alolan Muk after Stealth Rock and a Nasty Plot boost, Modest is the preferred option. Fightinium Z is the more viable item option, allowing Hoopa to muscle past common checks to Psychic-types such as Alolan Muk and Blissey while being a no-drawback move to OHKO Krookodile and Hydreigon. Ghostium Z allows Hoopa to severely dent neutral switch-ins with its excellent power and break defensive cores more readily at the cost of being unable to KO Alolan Muk and Blissey reliably. Alternatively, Life Orb can be used if another teammate utilizes the Z-Move better or if running an all-out attacker set.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Do not try to set up until Pursuit trappers like Choice Band Scizor are have been weakened and faster Pokemon like Hydreigon have been KOed. Take advantage of Hoopa's good special bulk by using Pokemon such as -2 Latias, bulky Water-types, and resisted attackers as setup fodder. Additionally, forcing switches also gives free setup opportunities. Use Hoopa's Ghost typing to block Rapid Spin from weaker spinners such as Tentacruel, but not offensive ones like Mega Blastoise and Starmie, which can overpower Hoopa quite easily, and use Substitute on weaker or resisted special attackers like Suicune, as this can help alleviate pressure from incoming Pursuit trappers, as well as avoid being hit by a potentially damaging status effect. Try to keep Hoopa healthy versus bulkier teams, as its power to break through walls such as Mega Aggron, Alomomola, and Blissey is extremely useful. Steel-types such as Cobalion and Scizor also are good targets of the Z-Move if opposing Dark-types have been chipped down or KOed. Never-Ending Nightmare should be used as soon as opposing Dark-types are heavily damaged, as most teams do not have switch-ins to it. Due to Hoopa's lack of recovery and need to set Substitute, try to pivot into it in via U-turn, Volt Switch, or a sacrifice.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Hoopa fares well on offensive builds that appreciate its wallbreaking capacity. Klefki makes an excellent partner, as it can set entry hazards to weaken checks, as well as slow down faster teams with Thunder Wave to ease a sweep, and in return, Hoopa can block Rapid Spin. Stealth Rock setters such as Nihilego, Krookodile, and Cobalion also weaken checks and appreciate Hoopa's spinblocking. Other powerful special attackers like Latias, Mega Manectric, and Hydreigon enjoy Hoopa's ability to break past common checks such as Blissey and Alolan Muk. Checks to Dark-types, such as Mega Altaria, and Cobalion, help Hoopa by alleviating offensive pressure on it, provided you play aggressively. Fast Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Hydreigon can help make up for Hoopa's lack of Speed. Hazard removers such as Tentacruel, Gligar, and Rotom-H are good teammates because Hoopa is less effective once it has taken residual damage. Wallbreakers such as Infernape and Scizor appreciate Hoopa's ability to weaken defensive Pokemon that they struggle with. Pokemon that resist Dark- or Ghost-type attacks such as Krookodile and Terrakion make good teammates due to their ability to take hits such as Knock Off from opposing Krookodile and Shadow Ball from Gengar.</p>"

  "Volcanion": {
    "overview": "<p>Volcanion makes for an interesting pick in the UU metagame with its unique typing, movepool, and stat distribution enabling a variety of viable sets and approaches. Given its high Special Attack, plethora of coverage options, and signature move Steam Eruption, Volcanion is most commonly used as a Defogger that can punish common entry hazard setters such as Mega Aggron and Hippowdon, and it can also be a strong wallbreaker with Choice Specs. Additionally, its solid defensive typing, overall bulk, and useful ability in Water Absorb allow it to serve as a respectable offensive check to Pokemon like Scizor, Mega Altaria, and Primarina and even let it run bulkier sets featuring Toxic. However, Volcanion has difficulty in dealing with the tier's omnipresent Dragon-types in Latias and Hydreigon. Its middling Speed tier and weaknesses to common attacking types in Rock, Ground, and Electric also open up opportunities for some of the tier's most potent wallbreakers in Terrakion and Nidoking to do big damage and for Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Rotom-C to gain momentum with Volt Switch. Lastly, Volcanion is vulnerable to all entry hazards, most importantly Stealth Rock, hurting its overall longevity and defensive utility if they are not cleared accordingly.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf is a decent option, as it helps to mitigate Volcanion's low Speed stat, but its damage output is unimpressive and it remains outsped by fast foes such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Manectric. Grassium Z alongside Solar Beam allows Volcanion to surprise Water-types like Seismitoad and Slowbro, but it is often much less useful than other, more consistent sets, and Toxic wears down Bloom Doom's main targets anyway. A mixed set featuring Fightinium Z and Superpower lets Volcanion punish some of its hardest answers in Blissey, Snorlax, and Hydreigon, but it is hard to justify over other options given its uselessness in matchups lacking these targets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Latias and Hydreigon are Volcanion's two most prominent answers, resisting its STAB moves and possessing reliable recovery, while fearing little outside of Toxic. While it does not resist Fire, Kyurem tanks Steam Eruption comfortably and threatens Volcanion with Draco Meteor and Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types like Suicune, Slowbro, and Seismitoad can pivot into any of Volcanion's attacking moves and proceed to perform their roles in front of it. However, Slowbro must watch out for Toxic and Choice Specs Hidden Power Electric, and Suicune must PP stall Volcanion to beat it one-on-one.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey shrugs off any of Volcanion's attacking moves and can freely take advantage of it. Additionally, Blissey's Natural Cure ability makes it the best answer to Volcanion's Toxic set.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While they cannot come in safely on Volcanion, Pokemon such Mega Manectric, Rotom-C, and Raikou threaten it with their STAB moves and can gain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Volcanion is prone to being worn down by all entry hazards, most notably Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, if they are not cleared in a timely manner.</p>",

      "Defog": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Steam Eruption is Volcanion's best Water-type STAB move, coming with high Base Power, reliable accuracy, a good chance to burn Volcanion's target, and most notably the ability to OHKO slower Ground-type Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Rhyperior, and Mega Steelix after Stealth Rock damage. Flamethrower is chosen over Fire Blast due to its higher accuracy and PP while still retaining the ability to 2HKO Mega Aggron and OHKO Doublade. Sludge Bomb is Volcanion's best option against Fairy-types, notably 2HKOing Mega Altaria and defensive Primarina, which resist Volcanion's STAB moves. It is preferable to Sludge Wave due to the higher poison chance, which helps to punish Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Latias, and Mantine for attempting to switch into Volcanion.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>216 Speed EVs allow Volcanion to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Scizor and OHKO it with Flamethrower before it can hit Volcanion with a +2 Knock Off or Superpower. Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature lets Volcanion hit as hard as possible, allowing it to 2HKO defensive Primarina after Stealth Rock with Sludge Bomb and OHKO Celebi after Stealth Rock with Flamethrower. The remaining EVs are put into HP for additional bulk. Shuca Berry allows Volcanion to lure in faster Ground-types such as Mamoswine, Nidoking, and Krookodile that may attempt to revenge kill it and OHKO them with Steam Eruption. Leftovers is an alternative option that offers Volcanion a form of passive recovery, allowing it to switch into Pokemon such as Scizor and Primarina more reliably. Water Absorb offers Volcanion a way to recover its health, albeit unreliably, when switching in against targets such as Suicune and Primarina. Volcanion may opt to run 188 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed offensive Mega Altaria and Adamant Bisharp or 252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature to outspeed Adamant Mamoswine, although the loss of power is noticeable, preventing Volcanion from OHKOing Amoonguss after Stealth Rock damage, for example.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Due to Volcanion's weakness to Stealth Rock, it should take advantage of its good matchup versus slower entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon, Mega Steelix, Rhyperior, and Nidoqueen and proactively attempt to prevent them from setting Stealth Rock. Due to its respectable bulk and Shuca Berry, it can risk switching in on the former two and forcing them out with the threat of Steam Eruption if it has high enough HP and keeping Stealth Rock off the field is a priority, although it must watch out for Toxic when doing this. Volcanion can also make use of the switches it forces against Pokemon such as Primarina and Scizor to clear entry hazards when facing Stealth Rock setters such as Terrakion, Mew, and Blissey that it cannot beat. If Volcanion is running a Shuca Berry, it can also attempt to lure and take out faster Ground-types such as Krookodile and Mamoswine. Shuca Berry can also be used to allow Volcanion to stay in against Swampert, which is otherwise risky to stay in against due to the high chance that Steam Eruption won't burn it, especially Choice Band sets, which can OHKO Volcanion from full. Due to its lack of reliable recovery, Volcanion should be kept healthy when possible in order to check Pokemon such as Primarina, non-Earthquake Mega Aggron, non-Earthquake Mega Altaria, and Scizor more reliably, especially if the opposing Stealth Rock setter has not yet fainted so it can continue to remove entry hazards. It should also watch out for coverage from these Pokemon, such as Psychic from Choice Specs Primarina and Superpower from Choice Band Scizor, as it leaves Volcanion susceptible to being 2HKOed the next time it comes in, and Primarina can survive one Sludge Bomb to 2HKO Volcanion with Psychic. If you predict a Pokemon such as Calm Mind Latias, Slowbro, or Suicune to switch in and Volcanion does not need to use Defog, it is recommended to either use Sludge Bomb to attempt to poison the opposing Pokemon or double switch to prevent Volcanion being used as setup fodder. Similarly, Volcanion should prioritize double switching when expecting Blissey to switch in to prevent offering it free turns to heal up, pass Wish, or set Stealth Rock. Volcanion should be careful about attempting to switch in against Scald users such as Empoleon, Tentacruel, and Starmie in order to attempt to regain HP due to the threat of either having its item removed by Knock Off or being hit by Toxic, the latter of which severely limits its longevity. However, if Volcanion has already used its Shuca Berry or has a teammate with Heal Bell, it can more freely attempt this and wear these Pokemon down for its teammates.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Defog Volcanion fits mainly on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate a strong offensive entry hazard remover that checks Pokemon such as Primarina and Scizor. Krookodile, Rhyperior, and Hippowdon are excellent Stealth Rock setters to pair with Volcanion, being able to check Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Rotom-H, and Mega Aerodactyl for it. Krookodile can also shut down common entry hazard setters such as Hippowdon and Mega Steelix with Taunt, taking pressure off of Volcanion to use Defog, while Rhyperior provides a check to Flying-types such as Togekiss and Moltres, and Hippowdon can provide a switch-in to other threats to Volcanion such as Choice Scarf Krookodile while more consistently checking the above Pokemon due to having reliable recovery. In return, Volcanion offers a switch-in to Primarina, which can OHKO all of them. Steel-types such as Mega Steelix, Mega Aggron, and Doublade are great partners, as they can check threats such as Nihilego and Mega Aerodactyl, which can OHKO Volcanion after Stealth Rock damage, as well as Latias and non-Fire Blast Mega Altaria, which can freely set up on Volcanion, provided Mega Altaria has not yet Mega Evolved. Mega Steelix and Mega Aggron can also set up Stealth Rock, while Doublade can check Terrakion. In return, Volcanion can provide a switch-in to Scald users such as Empoleon, Tentacruel, and Primarina while offering a secondary Scizor check. Pursuit trappers such as Choice Scarf Krookodile, Mega Aerodactyl, and Choice Band Scizor can help alleviate some of the problems Latias causes for Volcanion. Krookodile in particular also offers a valuable Electric immunity, which helps to deal with Pokemon such as Mega Manectric and Rotom-H, while Mega Aerodactyl can help check Flying-types such as Togekiss and Moltres. Volcanion appreciates them checking threatening Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl and Terrakion and provides a switch-in to Primarina and Scizor in return.</p> <p>Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Florges, and Togekiss are able to check Hydreigon, one of Volcanion's best checks. They can also provide Heal Bell support in order to remove status such as poison and paralysis inflicted by Mega Aggron, Klefki, and Empoleon, allowing Volcanion to remove entry hazards from these setters more readily. Sylveon and Florges can also provide Wish support, alleviating Volcanion's lack of recovery and letting it check Primarina and Scizor more consistently. In return, these Fairy-types greatly appreciate Volcanion removing Steel-types such as Scizor and Doublade, which helps Togekiss in particular to sweep more easily. Mega Altaria can check and set up on Electric-types such as Zeraora and Rotom-H and deal with Calm Mind Suicune, which can set up on Volcanion. It can also help to threaten Pokemon such as Pyukumuku and Blissey, and in return, it appreciates Volcanion's ability to OHKO Scizor and Amoonguss, which can otherwise consistently check Mega Altaria and limit its sweeping potential. Hydreigon and Latias make for good partners for Volcanion, as they can check Ground-types such as Swampert, Nidoking, and, in Hydreigon's case, Krookodile for Volcanion, which can potentially allow Volcanion to forgo running Shuca Berry in favor of Leftovers for extra recovery. Furthermore, Hydreigon can run Taunt to prevent Pokemon such as Swampert, Blissey, and Krookodile from setting entry hazards, which takes pressure off Volcanion, and to help break bulkier teams featuring Pokemon such as Mantine and Pyukumuku. Hydreigon and Latias can also help to deal with Calm Mind Mega Slowbro and Suicune, which can both use Volcanion as setup fodder, and in return, they appreciate Volcanion weakening Fairy- and Steel-types such as Primarina and Mega Steelix. Pivots such as Mienshao and Scizor make for helpful partners to Volcanion. Assault Vest Mienshao in particular can switch into Hydreigon and bring Volcanion into favorable positions against common switch-ins such as Hippowdon, Primarina, Scizor, and Amoonguss. Mega Manectric also pairs well with Volcanion, appreciating it breaking bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon that would otherwise prevent Mega Manectric from pivoting with Volt Switch, and in return, it can pressure bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Mega Slowbro that wall Volcanion while taking some pressure off Volcanion to check Scizor.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Steam Eruption serves as Volcanion's Water-type STAB move, possessing high Base Power, solid accuracy, and a decent chance to cripple foes with burns. Fire Blast is generally Volcanion's preferred Fire-type STAB move, featuring great damage output at the cost of fairly unreliable accuracy. Flamethrower is safer, more reliable option with more PP and perfect accuracy, but it is hard to justify over Fire Blast's raw power. Earth Power offers nice coverage alongside Volcanion's STAB moves, notably netting the OHKO on opposing Volcanion while threatening Tentacruel and Empoleon more than other options. Alternatively, Hidden Power Electric punishes other Water-types like Mantine, Mega Slowbro, and Alomomola, though due to its low damage output, it can be poor to lock into. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Primarina super effectively and possesses a decent chance to cripple common switch-ins such Latias and Hydreigon with poison. Sludge Wave is a slightly more powerful option, providing a better chance to OHKO Primarina, but the extra poison chance usually makes Sludge Bomb the superior move.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Special Attack EVs in combination with Choice Specs let Volcanion hit as hard as possible at the cost of locking into a move. Maximum Speed investment allows Volcanion to outrun most of the tier's bulky Pokemon as well as threats like Scizor and Crawdaunt. A Modest nature offers even more damage output and gets better rolls on Pokemon like Primarina, while a Timid nature lets Volcanion at least Speed tie with other base 70 Speed Pokemon, most notably opposing Volcanion and neutral Speed-natured Mamoswine. Water Absorb is the only available ability, giving Volcanion an immunity to Water-type attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Volcanion is best used as a wallbreaker early on, throwing out powerful attacks to break down the opposing team. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's most spammable move given its high Base Power coupled with the ability to cripple its switch-ins with burns. Ideally, Volcanion is brought in safely through the use of double switches or U-turn and Volt Switch, though it is bulky enough to stomach hits if need be. However, switching directly into attacks in tandem with its vulnerability to all entry hazards tends to wear down Volcanion quickly, so be wary if it is needed to offensively check threats like Primarina and Scizor later on in the match. Clear entry hazards, most specifically Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, with teammates when given the opportunity, since they can severely hinder Volcanion's longevity and opportunities to come in and effectively perform its role. Only lock into coverage moves when completely necessary, as they can often be taken advantage of by foes.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Choice Specs Volcanion fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that make use of its wallbreaking prowess and solid defensive utility. With its most common answer being Latias, Pursuit is a valuable tool alongside Volcanion, making Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Alolan Muk, and Choice Scarf Krookodile effective partners. Volt Switch and U-turn users like Rotom-C, Scizor, and Mega Pidgeot provide solid avenues of getting Volcanion into favorable positions safely. Scizor can also offer Pursuit support with its Choice Band set while Rotom-C can remove entry hazards and threaten bulky Water-types. Volcanion is easily taken advantage of by Dragon-types like Latias and Hydreigon, meaning switch-ins like Silvally-Steel, Sylveon, and Mega Altaria make for valuable teammates. Similarly to Rotom-C, Silvally-Steel and Mega Altaria are also able to remove entry hazards for Volcanion with Defog. Sylveon can keep Volcanion healthy with its Wish support. Fighting-types and other powerful physical attackers such as Terrakion, Cobalion, and the aforementioned Scizor are necessary to break through Volcanion's most sturdy answer in Blissey. Dragon-types like Latias and Hydreigon cover Volcanion's weaknesses to Ground- and Electric-type attacks, while appreciating its ability to punish opposing Steel- and Fairy-types. Stealth Rock setters such as Mega Aggron, Celebi, and Nihilego aid Volcanion in its wallbreaking efforts, further pressuring the switches it forces.</p>"

      "Toxic": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Steam Eruption is Volcanion's best Water-type STAB move, featuring high Base Power and a chance to burn foes. Flamethrower is the preferred option on a bulkier set like this given its perfect accuracy, respectable damage output, and high PP. Toxic cripples common switch-ins to Volcanion like Latias, Hydreigon, and Slowbro, making them easier to deal with as the match progresses. Protect racks up damage on badly poisoned foes, also scouting the move common Choice item users such as Hydreigon and Krookodile lock into. Substitute serves a similar purpose to Protect, chipping foes in tandem with Toxic, while also taking advantage of Empoleon and Toxic targets like Mantine and Slowbro.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment improves Volcanion's overall bulk, letting it serve as a better check to Scizor and preventing Slowbro's unboosted Psyshock from breaking its Substitute. 216 Speed EVs allow Volcanion to outpace maximum Speed Adamant Scizor and singe it with Flamethrower before it can get off an attack. The remaining EVs are dumped into Special Attack with a Modest nature in order to maximize Volcanion's offensive presence. Leftovers provides Volcanion with passive recovery, pairing nicely with Protect and Substitute. Water Absorb is the only usable ability, presenting Volcanion with an appreciated immunity to Water-type attacks.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Use Volcanion early-game to spread Toxic poison and cripple its long-term answers like Latias, Hydreigon, and Seismitoad. This can be an especially easy task given that many opponents will usually assume Volcanion to be running Choice Specs if it has yet to reveal Leftovers, meaning the aforementioned Pokemon are likely to switch in initially. When facing common Choice item users like Hydreigon and Krookodile, utilize Protect to scout their move and react accordingly. If running Substitute, use it in the face of Pokemon like Scizor, Doublade, and Mega Aggron that are commonly threatened out by Volcanion, or simply against foes such as Empoleon and Mantine that are unable to break it. While weak to all entry hazards, this Volcanion set is especially weak to Toxic Spikes, making their removal a top priority if Volcanion is to function as intended. Keep Volcanion healthy if it is needed to handle a threatening foe like Scizor, Wish passing to it if need be. Poison essentially neuters Volcanion's effectiveness by ruining its longevity, meaning it is best to avoid switching into potential Toxic users like Empoleon or making it necessary for a teammate to use Heal Bell if it is to occur.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Toxic Volcanion is a strong pick for balance teams as a means of spreading status and checking Scizor. Fairy-types like Sylveon, Togekiss, and Mega Altaria are great partners, checking Dragon-types, providing Heal Bell support, and Wish passing in the case of Sylveon. Hydreigon and Latias cover some of Volcanion's main weaknesses and take advantage of its ability to threaten Steel-types and cripple bulky Water-types with Toxic. Rotom-C and all the aforementioned Dragon-types can remove entry hazards with Defog, making Volcanion much more efficient in accomplishing its role on a team. Choice Scarf Krookodile shares nice type synergy with Volcanion and can pick off opposing Latias weakened by Volcanion with Pursuit. Similarly, grounded Poison-types like Nihilego, Amoonguss, and Nidoking remove the Toxic Spikes that Volcanion hates upon their entry. Nihilego appreciates Volcanion checking Scizor, while Nidoking can help wear down Volcanion hardest counter in Blissey with either Taunt or Superpower.</p>"

  "Decidueye": {
    "overview": "<p>Decidueye finds a unique place in the UU tier with its powerful Z-Move and useful secondary Ghost typing giving it some strengths over its main competition in Celebi. It is one of the best dedicated stallbreakers in the metagame, being able to take advantage of many common defensive Pokemon and become immediately threatening after a Swords Dance. Furthermore, its incredibly strong Z-Move lets it push through even Ghost-resistant Pokemon like Bisharp and Alolan Muk after some chip damage or at +2. However, Decidueye's weakness to Pursuit and Sucker Punch from threats like Krookodile and Bisharp forces it to rely on Substitute to avoid dangerous situations with trappers, especially with the prevalence of Dark-types in UU. Their prevalence also hinders it from breaking through non-defensive teams cleanly, though it can still deal some damage in such matchups with its powerful Z-Move. Decidueye's low base 70 Speed also is a huge disadvantage, making it prone to being revenge killed and preventing it from outspeeding many offensive Pokemon like Moltres, Hydreigon, and Rotom-H, needing either a Substitute up or teammates to break these Pokemon. Lastly, Decidueye still faces strong competition from Celebi, which can deal with faster offensive threats significantly more easily because of its base 100 Speed, is more sustainable thanks to Giga Drain, and has a higher Speed tier, more natural bulk, and wider coverage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Shadow Sneak is an option over Substitute, improving Decidueye's matchup against faster threats like Latias and Psychium Z or Ghostium Z Celebi, but it leaves much to be desired when fighting the slower teams Decidueye is used to take on. Low Sweep is usable as a way to hit Dark-types like Hydreigon and Bisharp unboosted, but Decidueye is strong enough to break through them with its STAB moves eventually, and it has to give up either Substitute or Shadow Sneak in order to find room for it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types are amongst the harder Pokemon for Decidueye to break, resisting its Ghost-type STAB moves and usually outspeeding it. Hydreigon, especially with Roost, is very difficult for Decidueye to take down on its own because it resists both of Decidueye's STAB moves. Krookodile, Bisharp, and Mega Sharpedo can all revenge kill Decidueye as well, with Bisharp getting potential setup chances of its own.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: While most don't like taking a Sinister Arrow Raid, Flying-types resist Decidueye's Grass-type STAB move and can usually outspeed and KO it. Moltres, Togekiss, and Crobat can all revenge kill Decidueye with their STAB attacks, while less common options like Mega Pidgeot and Mandibuzz completely wall it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Decidueye's lackluster Speed means that a number of offensive threats can revenge kill it even without a favorable type matchup. Infernape, Rotom-H, Jolly Mamoswine, Gengar, and Chandelure are all examples of Pokemon that can force Decidueye out if it's not behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic poison and burns immediately remove a lot of Decidueye's presence as a sweeper, while even paralysis can be annoying to it, removing its ability to attack walls first and potentially lose its ability to easily set up a Substitute. Hence, either run Decidueye with a cleric or be careful when switching it in to situations it can be statused.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Users</strong>: Once Decidueye has been weakened, Pursuit users are free to come in and safely remove it from the battle. Krookodile and Mega Aerodactyl both outspeed it and, as long as it is not behind a Substitute, are safe to come in and get the KO. Scizor and Alolan Muk also can attempt to trap it but must be more careful trying to tank Decidueye's Z-Move.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Substitute is very useful for giving Decidueye more opportunities to either attack or boost safely while protecting it from some attacks like Bisharp's Sucker Punch and status from the Pokemon it sets up on. Decidueye can take advantage of passive Pokemon like Blissey, Alomomola, and Slowbro to find times to set up a Substitute. Leaf Blade threatens common Water- and Ground-type tanks like Slowbro, Alomomola, Suicune, and Hippowdon and is also useful for being able to break through the Unaware users in Quagsire and Pyukumuku. Sinister Arrow Raid lets Decidueye break through sturdy walls such as Chesnaught and Mega Altaria when boosted while even KOing some Ghost-resistant Pokemon like Bisharp and Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>32 HP EVs let Decidueye survive Choice Scarf Krookodile's Knock Off and Choice Scarf Hydreigon's Dark Pulse from full health. Both Jolly and Adamant natures are viable; Jolly helps Decidueye check slower offensive powerhouses like Primarina and Bewear and Speed tie Bisharp and Metagross, while Adamant gives it more power to break walls down and damage Ghost-resistant Pokemon like Hydreigon.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Be careful when using Decidueye early-game if your opponent has a trapper such as Krookodile or Mega Aerodactyl. It's often good to use Substitute in order to scout these Pokemon and potentially hit them hard with Leaf Blade or Spirit Shackle. Decidueye should be brought in through pivoting moves and after fainted Pokemon most of the time, as even against the Pokemon it sets up on, it can risk being afflicted with Scald burns or Toxic poison, which greatly hinder or even ruin its chances to break through teams. When using Decidueye against stall, try to wear down the few Pokemon those teams carry that can potentially stop a Decidueye sweep like Moltres and Hydreigon. It is worth it to preserve Decidueye's health so it can find more opportunities to set up later in the game rather than blowing its chance early and being revenge killed. There are many Pokemon that can't touch Decidueye at all behind a Substitute, such as Blissey, Alomomola, Slowbro lacking Psyshock, Quagsire, Suicune, and non-Whirlwind Hippowdon. Use Substitute on these Pokemon to initiate a sweep. Against offensive teams, it is often wise to use Decidueye's Z-Move relatively early to take a huge hit out of a Pokemon that resists Decidueye's STAB moves and open paths for other Pokemon more geared to sweeping against faster teams to win; Choice Scarf Hydreigon is a great target for this strategy. Decidueye often won't get chances to use Swords Dance against these teams. Instead, rely on using Substitute to force trades and attacking with your STAB moves.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard support helps Decidueye break down defensive cores more easily. Amongst Spikes users, Klefki and Froslass in particular have great synergy with Decidueye, with Klefki checking Dark-types for it directly and Froslass being able to lure some like Hydreigon and Krookodile in and weaken them for Decidueye to KO them. Offensive Stealth Rock users such as Terrakion, Cobalion, and Nihilego are good choices to complement Decidueye, as they can wallbreak while laying down hazards. Decidueye also appreciates partners that can take advantage of Dark-types, which often come in to take its Ghost-type STAB moves or to attempt to revenge kill it. This can be done either defensively with Fairy-types like Togekiss and Mega Altaria or offensively with Justified users like Terrakion and Cobalion. However, to check faster opposing Ghost-types that may attempt to revenge kill it, Dark-types themselves work well as partners for Decidueye: Hydreigon stands out for having access to recovery while also potentially helping to remove hazards for Decidueye, while Krookodile and Alolan Muk can Pursuit trap many of Decidueye's potential revenge killers. VoltTurn users like Scizor, Rotom-H, and Mega Manectric are also heavily appreciated to safely get in Decidueye without having to hard switch. Additionally, entry hazard removal can be vital for Decidueye's ability to complete sweeps. Poison-types can be helpful to absorb Toxic Spikes, which is the most detrimental hazard for Decidueye, preventing it from performing its job. Examples include Tentacruel, which can remove other hazards; Nihilego, which can check most Flying-types; and Alolan Muk, which can use Pursuit on faster threats like Gengar, Chandelure, and Latias. Otherwise, Mega Blastoise, Starmie, and Mega Altaria all can be good partners both offensively and for their ability to Rapid Spin or Defog. Lastly, cleaners can take advantage of Decidueye's breaking power to burst through weakened teams. Mega Sharpedo is an excellent example of this, also setting up on some of Decidueye's revenge killers like Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Krookodile, as are Swords Dance Scizor and Bisharp.</p>"

  "Primarina": {
    "overview": "<p>Primarina is a fearsome wallbreaker in the UU tier, possessing a high Special Attack stat that is complemented nicely by its fantastic offensive and defensive typing in Water / Fairy. Its typing along with its solid natural special bulk allows it to reliably handle Hydreigon as well as stomach hits from threats like Moltres, Chandelure, and Mega Pidgeot and KO in return. However, Primarina is ultimately held back by its lackluster Defense stat, worsening its one-on-one matchup against common Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Scizor, and Dragon Dance Mega Altaria. Additionally, due to its low Speed stat, Primarina is often forced to take damage in order to get off attacks of its own, ultimately limiting its longevity in combination with its vulnerability to all entry hazards.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Energy Ball further improves Primarina's one-on-one matchup against bulky Water-types like Suicune, Slowbro, and Swampert, but it is usually inferior to Psychic. Ice Beam hits Grass-types super effectively, but Moonblast is usually sufficient in damaging them, and Psychic already nails Amoonguss. Hidden Power Electric deals solid damage to Volcanion, Mantine, and Empoleon, but it, too, is hard to justify over Psychic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey and Empoleon often shrug off Primarina's moves and can perform their roles in front of it. Alolan Muk is a softer answer, as it is more easily worn down over time, but it threatens Primarina with its Poison-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Primarina's STAB Moves</strong>: Tentacruel, Amoonguss, and Volcanion can all tank hits from Primarina and deal huge damage in return. However, the former two must watch out for Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Mega Manectric, Zeraora, and Rotom-C threaten Primarina with their STAB moves and often force it out. Furthermore, they can all freely use Volt Switch to gain offensive momentum.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Celebi and Tsareena resist Primarina's Water-type STAB moves and can heavily damage it with their own STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers like Terrakion, Latias, and Haxorus all threaten Primarina with their respective coverage moves, taking advantage of its lackluster Defense stat.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Hydro Pump is Primarina's most powerful viable Water-type STAB move, only held back by its unreliable accuracy. Moonblast offers Primarina a more spammable STAB move, possessing no drawbacks and few sturdy Pokemon that resist it. Sparkling Aria makes for a more reliable Water-type STAB move, also hitting Pokemon like Terrakion and Chandelure through Substitute. Psychic provides great coverage alongside Primarina's STAB moves, nailing Pokemon like Tentacruel and Amoonguss.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment, a Modest nature, and Choice Specs allow Primarina to hit as hard as possible at the cost of locking into a move. 216 Speed EVs let Primarina outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt along with other Pokemon like Gligar, though this stat is easily customizable to fit the team. The rest of Primarina's EVs are dumped into HP, improving its ability to tank hits and do huge damage in return. Torrent allows Primarina to do even more damage with its Water-type STAB moves when its HP is low. A Timid nature with maximum Speed can be used to outspeed and OHKO threats such as Bisharp and Scizor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Primarina is best used early- to mid-game to punch holes for teammates, ideally being brought in on double switches and free switches from U-turn or Volt Switch to preserve its health to handle hits better later on in the match. Primarina does a terrific job of threatening common Stealth Rock users such as Rhyperior and Hippowdon, and it should be used aggressively to take advantage of them early-game. If expecting a hard Primarina counter like Blissey or Empoleon to come in, it is often better to double switch to a teammate that threatens them in order to maintain momentum. Be wary of locking into Psychic, as though it can nab Tentacruel and Amoonguss on the switch, it is easily exploited by common threats like Scizor, Latias, and Krookodile. While Primarina's ability to often stomach a powerful hit and deal huge damage in return to foes is a valuable tool, determine when it is necessary to do so, as it often leaves Primarina too weak to perform its role defensively. Primarina is easily worn down and should be kept at a sufficient amount of HP to check Pokemon like Hydreigon and Infernape if necessary. Entry hazards play a major role in wearing down Primarina, and they should be cleared by teammates whenever needed.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primarina's offensive and defensive capabilities allow it to fit nicely on a wide variety of teams, ranging from balance to offense. Fighting-types like Terrakion, Infernape, and Cobalion provide great ways of breaking through Primarina's best answers in Blissey and Empoleon. Choice Scarf users like Hydreigon and Krookodile make for solid partners, dealing with Mega Manectric and helping to cover for Primarina's low Speed stat. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Scizor, Mega Manectric, and the aforementioned Hydreigon allow Primarina to switch in for free, letting it effectively perform its role as a wallbreaker while staying healthy over time. Dragon-types as a whole possess great type synergy alongside Primarina, resisting Grass- and Electric-type moves and appreciating its ability to tank opposing Dragon- and Ice-type moves in return. Grass-types offer similar defensive synergy, and Tsareena can double down as a physical wallbreaker to beat Primarina's sturdier answers. Bulky Steel-types such as Mega Steelix, Scizor, and Doublade can absorb Poison-type moves aimed at Primarina while helping to combat many of the physical wallbreakers that threaten it. Entry hazard removers like Gligar, Hydreigon, and Rotom-H are also great options, helping to keep Primarina healthy throughout a match. Similarly, entry hazard setters such as Nihilego and the aforementioned Mega Steelix are essential in further pressuring Primarina's switch-ins, notably guaranteeing that Torrent-boosted Hydro Pump 2HKOes Blissey after Stealth Rock damage.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rest lets Primarina make up for its lack of reliable recovery and is mandatory to check threats like Crawdaunt and Infernape reliably throughout the match. Sleep Talk ensures Primarina is neither passive nor setup fodder while asleep, letting it potentially punish setup sweepers like Terrakion and Cobalion that can otherwise beat it if it is asleep.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Thanks to Primarina's naturally good special bulk, it can already take on special attackers like Hydreigon and Lucario well, so 252 Defense EVs in conjunction with a Bold nature let Primarina be as physically bulky as possible to handle physical attackers like Mamoswine, Infernape, and Krookodile. Leftovers not only provides Primarina with passive recovery, which allows Primarina to remain healthy, but also lets it switch into U-turn users like Gligar and Hydreigon more reliably, as it potentially negates U-turn's damage. Torrent's power boost can come in handy against Pokemon like Terrakion and Infernape that Primarina can't reliably OHKO otherwise.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Primarina into Pokemon whose STAB moves it resists, including Crawdaunt, Mega Sharpedo, Hydreigon, Kyurem, and Infernape. Be wary of switching Primarina into Pokemon such as Volcanion and Haxorus, though; even though Primarina resists their STAB moves, they are likely to carry super effective coverage in Sludge Bomb and Poison Jab, respectively. However, in Dragon Dance Haxorus's case, a healthy Primarina can survive even a boosted hit and revenge kill it. Generally, scouting for super effective coverage moves on Pokemon Primarina may attempt to beat, such as Gunk Shot on Infernape, is ideal. Early-game, it is advised to use Scald, as it is very spammable and can potentially burn foes and wear them down. A burn from Scald helps Primarina beat Pokemon like Empoleon and Tentacruel that often rely on passive recovery to beat it and cripples other common switch-ins like Amoonguss. Moonblast should be used mid- to late-game, as it is slightly more powerful than Scald and OHKOes certain Pokemon Scald doesn't, such as Krookodile and Crawdaunt. Moonblast can also be used to pressure opposing Water-types like Alomomola and Slowbro, especially if they are burned. Because of its lack of reliable recovery, Primarina should be using Rest as often as it can to take on threats like Krookodile and Infernape throughout the match. Thanks to Rest, Primarina can also act as a status absorber, as it can come in on Toxic users such as Hippowdon and Empoleon and heal itself with Rest. Sleep Talk should almost always be used if Primarina is asleep and it is in its favor to stay in so it is not completely inactive and may still attempt to burn or hit an opposing Pokemon with a STAB move. However, in the rare cases when Primarina needs to save PP, it should not use Sleep Talk every turn it is asleep. Despite having super effective coverage for Latias, Primarina must be wary of staying in on it, as Calm Mind sets can set up on this variant of Primarina and heal off the damage taken with Roost. Furthermore, to avoid unnecessary risks, if Primarina is asleep, it shouldn't stay in on setup sweepers like Scizor and Cobalion.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Primarina, generally, fits in on bulky offensive teams and balanced teams that appreciate its unique typing and mixed defensive capabilities. Because Primarina is susceptible to every form of entry hazard, hazard control from Pokemon like Hydreigon and Rotom-C is mandatory to help Primarina reach its full potential as a wall. Similarly, Poison-types like Nidoqueen and Nihilego can absorb Toxic Spikes, which Primarina dislikes. Rotom-H and Moltres deserve a special mention because not only are they able to Defog away hazards for Primarina, they also can check Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tsareena as well as Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Scizor that Primarina fails to beat. Ground-types like Krookodile and Hippowdon generally pair well with Primarina thanks to their ability to check Volt Switch users like Mega Manectric and Zeraora that threaten it out. Steel-types like Scizor, Mega Steelix, and Doublade make great partners as they are capable of beating strong wallbreakers like Celebi and Latias that can beat Primarina. Certain wallbreakers like Infernape and Hydreigon synergize well with Primarina because they are able to take advantage of Primarina forcing in Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tsareena as well as bulky Water-types like Empoleon and Tentacruel. Latias pairs exceptionally well here because it is able to reliably take advantage of Poison-types like Tentacruel and Amoonguss for Primarina, while Primarina can check Dark-types like Krookodile and Hydreigon for it. Because Primarina's typing allows it to serve as a check to Hydreigon, Pokemon like Mega Manectric and Krookodile that struggle to break through Hydreigon pair well with it. Primarina's typing also allows it to handle Fighting-types like Infernape, so Pokemon such as Krookodile, Scizor, and Hydreigon that appreciate Primarina taking them on pair well with it.</p>"

  "Araquanid": {
    "overview": "<p>Araquanid carves its niche in the metagame as a reliable Sticky Web setter that can double as a wallbreaker using Liquidation in conjunction with its ability Water Bubble. It also has decent bulk, giving it opportunities to set up Sticky Web throughout the match against Pokemon that have a hard time breaking through it such as Celebi, Hydreigon, and Infernape instead of only functioning as a lead. Araquanid's decent defensive typing and ability make it capable of checking common threats such as Cobalion, Mamoswine, and Lucario while dishing out respectable amounts of damage in the process. However, it's still not bulky enough to consistently switch into threats, and its low Speed makes it less reliable because it will often have to take a hit before moving. Because of its low Speed and good wallbreaking power, though, it benefits well from the support that its own Sticky Web offers. Araquanid's weakness to Stealth Rock hurts its longevity a lot, making it more difficult to set Sticky Web throughout the match. It also has a tough matchup against several special attackers such as Mega Manectric, Togekiss, and Mega Blastoise, despite its bulk. The latter can also remove Araquanid's Sticky Web with Rapid Spin. Araquanid finds itself rather niche and inconsistent due to its best-fitting playstyle being matchup reliant; it also has a lot of competition as a wallbreaking Water-type, as Starmie, Crawdaunt, and Primarina generally outclass it with their higher Speed, better coverage, and overall consistency.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mirror Coat can be used on the same set with Sticky Web to allow it to beat special attackers that it'd usually lose to one-on-one, such as Mega Manectric, Volcanion, and Primarina. However, this isn't nearly as valuable as the other options for this set and is often unnecessary due to Liquidation doing a lot of damage to most foes anyways. On top of this, Araquanid doesn't like taking unnecessary damage, as it likes being able to set Sticky Web throughout the match. Choice Band could be useful due to the high damage output Araquanid already has due to its ability, although it is pretty much outclassed as a Choice item user by other Water-type wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt and Primarina. However, Araquanid is bulkier and isn't afraid of Scald, which gives it a niche in some cases. Either way, its lack of power in its attacks bar Liquidation and lack of Speed or priority is a pain.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types give Araquanid a tough time, as they all outpace it and can potentially OHKO it with a STAB move. Moltres and Mega Pidgeot are good examples of this, while Togekiss is able to cause it to flinch and 2HKO it with Air Slash, making Togekiss a good anti-lead. Flying-types also ignore Sticky Web's debuff, making dealing with them more difficult for Araquanid's team.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types can outspeed and OHKO Araquanid with a STAB move. Mega Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and Nihilego are good examples of this. However, Nihilego fails to KO it without using a Z-Move, and the former two lose if Araquanid has Focus Sash intact. Other Rock-types like Rhyperior, Diancie, and Stakataka are outsped and can be pressured with Liquidation, but Araquanid should still be wary of being KOed by a STAB move from Stakataka because Araquanid needs chip to reliably KO it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Most of the Electric-types in the tier fail to reliably OHKO Araquanid but still pressure it with super effective STAB attacks all the same. Mega Manectric, Rotom-H, Rotom-C, and Zeraora are all good examples of this, although most of them aren't too hard to play around, fail to OHKO Araquanid, and are pressured by Liquidation, or, in Rotom-C's case, Leech Life.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Stealth Rock can limit Araquanid's longevity significantly and can be especially irritating if Araquanid is running Focus Sash.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: While Araquanid has good defenses, its poor HP stat and only decent Defense stat make it very scared of the more heavy-hitting physical attackers in the tier such as Scizor, Mega Sharpedo, and Choice Band Crawdaunt. While Araquanid can threaten all of these with its STAB moves, they outspeed it and do massive amounts of damage, potentially KOing it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sticky Web": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Leech Life lets Araquanid act as a soft check to Pokemon like Latias and Hydreigon and regain some HP in the process. Lunge can be used over Leech Life as a Bug-type STAB move that prevents foes like Haxorus and Mega Altaria from setting up with Dragon Dance and punishes other physical attackers that try to switch in. However, the longevity Leech Life gives is generally much more valuable. Magic Coat is helpful to Araquanid when it's up against Pokemon that can reliably set up Stealth Rock on it or irritate it with Taunt or Toxic such as Swampert, Azelf, and Alomomola. Toxic can also be used over Magic Coat or even Leech Life because it's capable of bugging common Water-resistant Pokemon; however, most of them either can be muscled through with a STAB attack or rely on Toxic to beat Araquanid, making Magic Coat equally as efficient in that sense alone.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Splash Plate heightens the absurd damage output Araquanid dishes out, increasing its ability to break opposing teams. This is often preferred over Focus Sash due to it being more effective in the long run, as Araquanid is not a suicide lead. However, Focus Sash can still be useful; even though Araquanid has decent bulk, Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Terrakion, and Zeraora can otherwise OHKO it with a STAB attack, which would prevent it from setting up Sticky Web. This can be more valuable than Splash Plate during times where you just need to reliably get Sticky Web onto the field, especially in lead scenarios. 108 EVs in Speed allow Araquanid to outpace Blissey and everything slower than it. Araquanid can also viably run Waterium Z if there is no other Z-Move user on the team for a 160-Base Power Water Bubble-enhanced Hydro Vortex.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Araquanid should primarily be used to set Sticky Web and irritate opposing teams with Liquidation and Magic Coat. You should get Sticky Web on the field as early as you reliably can so that your team, including Araquanid, can take advantage of it throughout the match. Even though Araquanid has decent defenses, switch it in sparingly. While it does resist the STAB attacks of Cobalion, Mamoswine, and Lucario, recklessly switching into these Pokemon could, along with Stealth Rock, deal enough damage to Araquanid to leave it unable to set up Sticky Web later on in the match. However, you can use Araquanid to soft check these threats in emergency situations. While getting Sticky Web up early is important, Araquanid is durable enough and forces enough switches to set them up throughout the match reliably, so you should keep it healthy if you feel you won't be able to keep your hazards up and will need to set them again later to win. Araquanid is capable of beating a lot of the more passive Pokemon in the tier due to its high damage output, immunity to burns, and access to Magic Coat. Magic Coat should be used to bounce back status moves such as Taunt, Stealth Rock, and Toxic. Bouncing back the latter is especially important to beat other bulky Water-types such as Alomomola. Also keep in mind that while you can bounce Stealth Rock and other hazards back, you cannot keep them off the field due to Magic Coat having fewer PP. Araquanid can be used as a soft check to Latias and Hydreigon thanks to its access to Leech Life and its high Special Defense stat. As said before, switch it in sparingly, but be aware of these matchups because their immunity to Sticky Web could thus make Araquanid vital to the rest of the team's success. Early-game, especially after setting Sticky Web, Araquanid can spam Liquidation to put dents in the enemy team. Liquidation has an absurd damage output due to Araquanid's ability and can do decent chunks to the majority of tier, including Water-resistant switch-ins such as Empoleon, Tsareena, and Latias. Pressure the opponent's hazard removal as much as you can because keeping your hazards up is vital to the team's success more often than not.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Araquanid only fits on offense teams that appreciate Sticky Web support, as its niche is setting Sticky Web. Wallbreakers with a mediocre Speed tier appreciate Sticky Web support; some examples of this are Chandelure, Swords Dance Haxorus, and Mega Blastoise. Sticky Web teams have several matchup problems by default, the main one being non-grounded Pokemon such as Latias, Hydreigon, and Mega Aerodactyl. A good way to pressure these Pokemon is with priority; specifically, Scizor and Mamoswine pressure each of these examples with Bullet Punch and Ice Shard, respectively. Stealth Rock support is very necessary to help chip the opposing team down, particularly to punish Flying-type Pokemon that can ignore Sticky Web for coming onto the field. Stealth Rock setters that fit well on Sticky Web offense include Nidoking, Terrakion, and the aforementioned Mamoswine. These examples fit well because of the offensive pressure they give off, which makes removing hazards against them very difficult and lets them take advantage of the Sticky Web themselves. Bisharp can be a nuisance to deal with for Sticky Web teams due to its access to Defiant and priority, giving it a free +2 Attack boost once it comes onto the field with Sticky Web up. Pokemon that can deal with Bisharp while taking advantage of Sticky Web such as Lucario, Cobalion, and Infernape are appreciated. Moltres specifically is really difficult to handle due to its STAB combination and defensive typing in conjunction with its immunity to Sticky Web. Pokemon that can help pressure Moltres in conjunction with Stealth Rock that appreciate Sticky Web support like Nihilego, Latias, Quick Attack Scizor, and Zeraora can make a nice fit. Offensive Ghost-types that can spinblock foes such as Starmie, Tsareena, and Tentacruel can help keep Sticky Web on the field. Decidueye, Gengar, and Doublade are good examples of this. However, all of these examples fail to reliably block Rapid Spin due to most spinners' ability to offensively pressure them, making this appreciated, but not a necessity. Similarly, Bisharp also works very well with Araquanid due to its ability to deter and punish Defog users with Defiant, and it can also take advantage of Sticky Web in its own right. Bisharp also can pressure non-grounded Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl, Latias, and Moltres with Sucker Punch. More niche options that can take advantage of Sticky Web such as Choice Band Mienshao and Choice Band Darmanitan can also work due to their subpar Speed stats and absurdly high damage output.</p>"

  "Salazzle": {
    "overview": "<p>Salazzle has an excellent Speed tier that allows it to outspeed many prominent threats in the UU metagame such as Infernape, Latias, and Cobalion. It has a respectable Special Attack stat and access to moves like Fire Blast and Sludge Wave that complement it. It also has a fantastic offensive typing that is well suited the UU metagame, which is full of Grass-, Fairy-, and Steel-type Pokemon such as Celebi, Togekiss, and Scizor. Access to Nasty Plot allows it to reliably threaten most defensive Pokemon. Salazzle can also take advantage of its ability Corrosion to punish typical Poison-immune walls such as Empoleon with Toxic. Unfortunately, Salazzle has extremely poor coverage outside of its STAB moves; it relies on Hidden Power for coverage. Additionally, its ability to set up and plow through teams or stall foes out with Toxic damage is hampered by its lackluster bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock, which makes it hard to set up and incredibly easy to revenge kill.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute on the Nasty Plot set provides Salazzle with some safety against faster Pokemon, but it comes at the cost of coverage. Taunt can be run on this set to prevent defensive walls such as Blissey from recovering. Knock Off allows Salazzle to cripple some checks to it like Tentacruel and Empoleon by removing their passive recovery but again, like all of its other options, is hard to justify due to the fact that it forces Salazzle to give up Hidden Power coverage. If you already have a Z-Move user on your team, then using Life Orb Salazzle is a viable alternative.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Salazzle's pathetic bulk and lack of a way of boosting its Speed, it will always lose to faster Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Manectric and Crobat as well as Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Krookodile.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Rock-types like Terrakion and Mega Aerodactyl are capable of taking any hit from Salazzle and KOing it in return. They do have to be cautious of Hidden Power coverage; however, they do not take much damage from an unboosted attack.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Pokemon such as specially defensive Gligar and Hippowdon can take any hit from Salazzle and KO it. Similarly to Salazzle's Rock-type checks, they do not take much from an unboosted attack yet have to be cautious of what Z-Move it is running or what Hidden Power it has.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon with high Special Defense stat such as Blissey do not get KOed by Salazzle and damage it badly in return.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Tentacruel and Jellicent make for good checks to Salazzle, as they resist both its STAB moves and will not be OHKOed by a boosted attack. It's also vulnerable to Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nasty Plot boosts Salazzle's Special Attack sharply, allowing it to become a powerful threat. Sludge Wave is Salazzle's most reliable STAB move, which when augmented by Poisonium Z provides it with a very strong Acid Downpour that is capable of breaking past Pokemon such as Latias at +2. Fire Blast is Salazzle's secondary STAB move and allows it to have good offensive coverage coupled with Sludge Wave, capable of hitting Steel- and Ground-types that Sludge Wave can't. Hidden Power Grass offers coverage for Pokemon that Fire Blast and Sludge Wave do not hit at least neutrally such as Swampert and Gastrodon. Hidden Power Ice may be run over Hidden Power Grass to hit Gligar.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>The given EV spread allows Salazzle to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch while maximizing Special Attack and Speed. Oblivious prevents Salazzle from being afflicted by Taunt, meaning that it can always set up with Nasty Plot. Poisonium Z is the item of choice, which allows Salazzle to break past Pokemon such as Latias and Suicune with Acid Downpour. Firium Z is an alternative to this, as Inferno Overdrive is capable of heavily damaging checks like Alolan Muk and can OHKO other Pokemon like Gligar without having to forfeit Hidden Power Grass.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Salazzle is at its best when its faster checks such as Choice Scarf Pokemon like Hydreigon and Krookodile and Pokemon like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Manectric, and Mega Beedrill are removed from play, so ideally avoid setting up while they are still around. Do not attempt to use Salazzle as a switch-in to anything; its abysmal bulk prevents it from being a reliable switch-in to even resisted hits. Salazzle can be brought in via pivoting, via double switches, or after a teammate has fainted. It is best to set up with Salazzle on a Pokemon that it forces out like Sylveon or Scizor. Alternatively, you can take advantage of a foe locked into a move like Pursuit or Bullet Punch and set up with Salazzle. Ensure that Pokemon that could potentially halt a Salazzle sweep such as Hippowdon are sufficiently worn down or eliminated before attempting to set up. Due to Salazzle's typing, it can serve as a soft check to Pokemon like Choice Scarf Infernape and Rotom-C if absolutely necessary, but this hampers its ability to set up in the process.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Entry hazard removers like Hydreigon and Starmie synergize really well and ensure that Salazzle will be as healthy as possible when trying to set up. Methods of speed control like Thunder Wave from Pokemon such as Klefki and Rotom-H and Tailwind from Pokemon such as Tornadus help Salazzle to get around its faster checks. Entry hazard setters like Nihilego, Cobalion, and Klefki make for great partners because they are able to wear down Salazzle's defensive checks. Pokemon like Rotom-C, Celebi, and Crawdaunt that are capable of punishing Ground- and Rock-types make for good partners. Pivots like Hydreigon and Zeraora can be used to bring in Salazzle safely.</p>"
      },
      "Corrosion": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Toxic lets Salazzle rack up poison damage on any Pokemon without an ability that grants a poison immunity thanks to Corrosion. Protect lets Salazzle stall for poison damage as well as Black Sludge recovery, massively reducing the time a poisoned Pokemon has to react. It also is useful for scouting Choice Scarf users such as Krookodile and Hydreigon that might come in to revenge kill Salazzle. Flamethrower makes sure Salazzle has ways to immediately pressure Scizor and is a good way to damage Steel-types even more quickly. Substitute is helpful for racking up even more poison damage in conjunction with Protect, forcing your opponent to either bring in something faster than Salazzle or use Volt Switch to break the cycle. Taunt is useful versus defensive teams especially, preventing clerics like Florges and Blissey from using Heal Bell or Aromatherapy. However, using a moveslot on Taunt does sacrifice the ability to use Substitute to stall attackers that can actually threaten Salazzle as well as losing the move that gives Salazzle a buffer for Pursuit users like Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Salazzle to outspeed base 115 Pokemon such as Starmie and Raikou, allowing Salazzle to hit them with a Toxic in dangerous situations. Corrosion is what makes Salazzle unique as a Toxic user, giving it the ability to damage Poison- and Steel-types that normally are immune to the move, such as Empoleon and Nihilego.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Salazzle is generally free to start spamming Toxic every time it enters the field. The only times it should be wary is when a poison-immune Pokemon by virtue of abilities such as Gligar or Reuniclus is on the opposing team. RestTalk users such as Suicune are also easily able to pivot in and take advantage of the set's weak offenses. Try to bring Salazzle in on free switches or when you predict a resisted hit, as even with investment, its bulk is pitiful, and it will fall to most STAB attacks from breakers like Hydreigon and Moltres. Predicting Pokemon such as Cobalion and Amoonguss is a good way to find turns to spread status or get a Substitute up. Use Protect when needed to maximize Salazzle's potential recovery and residual damage. You can also catch double switches this way and potentially amass even more chip damage. Be careful of letting in threatening Pursuit users like Mega Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Krookodile. Avoid Knock Off from support Pokemon like Alomomola and Mienshao at all costs, as Salazzle will not be able to stall for long periods of time without its Black Sludge. If Salazzle is carrying Taunt, it can often keep using Taunt to cover switches as long as some of your opponent's team is already poisoned. This is even more effective when you have some form of entry hazards up and makes it hard for defensive teams to break through Salazzle's onslaught when they can't recover any health. Try and keep entry hazards off your side of the field, as Salazzle's already limited defensive utility is cut even further when it is losing 1/4 of its health due to Stealth Rock or even more with Spikes added. Avoiding paralysis from Klefki, Rotom-H, and Amoonguss is important, as Salazzle needs its speed in order to set up Substitutes safely and dislikes the full paralysis chance on Protect turns.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Corrosion Salazzle mostly fits on bulkier teams that are able to take advantage of its passive damage and stalling abilities. Entry hazard setters like Hippowdon, Empoleon, Mega Aggron, and Mega Steelix will all help soften the Pokemon Salazzle poisons. Wish users are a great way to aid Salazzle's recovery, giving it more flexibility in when it switches in. Alomomola, Blissey, and Sylveon all can cover different defensive needs Salazzle fails to provide while supporting it with Wish. Having secondary Scizor checks such as Cobalion, Tentacruel, and Mega Aggron is important, as it prevents Salazzle from being overworked. Taunt users are another way to ensure that Salazze's residual damage continues to be a hindrance, with Pokemon like Hydreigon and Krookodile being great options. Pokemon that can tank Ground- and Rock-type attacks well like Mega Aggron, Slowbro, and Hippowdon synergize well defensively. Hazard removal options like Empoleon, Hydreigon, and Mega Altaria keep Salazzle healthy and allow it to pressure opposing Steel- and Poison-types even more. Mega Altaria in particular appreciates the types that resist its Fairy-type STAB move being weakened. Offensive threats that appreciate tanks and walls like Tentacruel and Empoleon being weakened make for good partners. Swords Dance Scizor and Calm Mind Suicune are both adept in taking advantage of Salazzle's damage.</p>"

  "Bewear": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to its Normal / Fighting STAB combination and high Attack stat, Bewear functions as a potent wallbreaker in the UU metagame. Its ability Fluffy in conjunction with its solid HP and Defense stats allows Bewear to check a large range of physical threats in the metagame such as Mega Beedrill, Scizor lacking Superpower, and Mega Aerodactyl. The coverage moves Bewear has at its disposal, such as Shadow Claw and Earthquake, allow it to take on a wide variety of would-be checks like Chandelure, Jellicent, and Doublade. However, Bewear's low special bulk and set of weaknesses let special attackers like Latias, Celebi, Nidoking, and Primarina force it out easily, even if they cannot switch into its attacks. In addition, Bewear's typing and Fluffy's mechanics give many physical attackers in the tier like Terrakion and Mamoswine a way to bypass its bulk with super effective Fighting-type attacks like Close Combat or non-contact moves like Earthquake and Icicle Crash. Fluffy also causes Bewear to take double damage from Fire-type attacks, which prevents it from being very useful versus Pokemon like Infernape, Volcanion, and Chandelure. Bewear's Speed stat also leaves it outsped by the vast majority of offensive Pokemon even with maximum investment, although it still outspeeds most defensive Pokemon like Alomomola and Blissey.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hammer Arm is an option over Superpower for the less severe drawback of a Speed drop, but the lower power and accuracy of it make Superpower heavily preferred.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Pokemon like Jellicent, Chandelure, and Doublade are immune to both of Bewear's STAB attacks, although most of these must be wary of Bewear's coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Primarina, Togekiss, and Latias can all force out Bewear with the threat of their strong special attacks, even if they cannot switch in directly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Mega Sceptile, and Mega Manectric can all outspeed Bewear and heavily damage it with strong non-contact attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Strong Fighting-types like Heracross, Mienshao, and Terrakion can all heavily damage Bewear even through Fluffy.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Infernape, Moltres, and Volcanion can all take advantage of Fluffy's artificial weakness to Fire-type attacks to threaten Bewear.</p>",

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>STAB Return boasts good neutral coverage and high power with no drawbacks. Double-Edge can be considered over Return when running an Adamant nature for extra power to obtain OHKOs versus Pokemon like Amoonguss and Tentacruel after Stealth Rock damage, and it can also 2HKO physically defensive Mandibuzz. However, the recoil cuts into Bewear's longevity, and there is little reason to run it if not running an Adamant nature. Superpower is Bewear's strongest attack, capable of breaking Pokemon that Return cannot such as Scizor, Bisharp, Mega Aerodactyl, and Mega Aggron. Shadow Claw is used to hit Ghost-types like Chandelure, Jellicent, and Cofagrigus super effectively. Earthquake is an option to 2HKO Doublade, which Bewear cannot do with Shadow Claw. However, Earthquake has less crucial coverage than Shadow Claw outside of this purpose. Facade allows Bewear to punish status effects from Pokemon like Alomomola, Blissey, and Mantine with a 140-Base Power STAB attack. Ice Punch can be used instead of Facade to 2HKO Gligar and should be run alongside Earthquake.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack EVs with a Choice Band gives Bewear an immense amount of wallbreaking power. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allows Bewear to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant maximum Speed Scizor and Speed tie with Timid Primarina. Fluffy halves the damage taken from contact moves, allowing Bewear to take a wide array of physical attacks. An Adamant nature can instead be used in order to gain extra power, netting some important 2HKOs like Earthquake on Jellicent, but it is not usually preferred due to the significant drop in Speed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bewear should use Return as much as possible due to its lack of drawbacks compared to Superpower. It should be sent in either on a free switch or on a Pokemon that cannot harm it significantly such as Scizor, Mega Aggron, or Blissey. Bewear should use its coverage moves as little as possible to minimize opportunities for the foe to set up on it. Its coverage moves should primarily be used to damage predicted Ghost-type switch-ins. Try to keep Bewear healthy throughout the game if Pokemon that it needs to check or revenge kill like Scizor and Mega Sharpedo are still in play.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bewear fits best on bulky offense and balance due to its great physical bulk and wallbreaking capabilities. Pursuit support from Pokemon such as Krookodile and Alolan Muk can help to remove Ghost- and Psychic-types like Jellicent, Chandelure, and Latias, which Bewear struggles with. As an extension to this, Dark-types in general such as Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo help versus Ghost-types and can allow Bewear to forgo Shadow Claw for Earthquake. Users of U-turn and Volt Switch like Scizor, Hydreigon, and Rotom-C can help to bring Bewear in safely to wallbreak. Specially bulky Pokemon such as Empoleon can help to take attacks from Pokemon like Primarina that Bewear cannot. Wish support from Pokemon like Alomomola and Sylveon, Healing Wish support from Latias, and Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Togekiss and Florges can help to keep Bewear as healthy as possible throughout a match. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Swampert, Empoleon, and Nihilego and Spikes support from Klefki both assist in Bewear's wallbreaking capabilities by dealing residual damage to the opposing team. Entry hazard removal support from Pokemon such as Tentacruel, Mega Blastoise, and Starmie can help to prevent Bewear from being worn down by switching into Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Setup sweepers like Scizor, Latias, and Mega Altaria appreciate Bewear's ability to wear down opposing teams so that they can sweep more easily.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance allows Bewear to boost its Attack to incredible levels, which lets it easily demolish defensive Pokemon. It also helps Bewear break through Pokemon that it would otherwise struggle with like Hippowdon and Amoonguss. Drain Punch hits Rock- and Steel-types like Terrakion and Scizor and lets Bewear recover health. Double-Edge is Bewear's strongest attack, and it hits Pokemon like Primarina, Sylveon, and Amoonguss hard. Breakneck Blitz gives Bewear the ability to smash past Pokemon like Quagsire and Alomomola when wallbreaking, and it also lets Bewear OHKO several less bulky Pokemon without needing to use Swords Dance like Tentacruel, Celebi, and Latias. Earthquake lets Bewear hit Ghost-types like Doublade and Chandelure hard and gives Bewear a way to hit Poison-types like Tentacruel without recoil and marginally harder than with Double-Edge.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Attack and Speed EVs with a Jolly nature give Bewear as much wallbreaking power as possible while also letting it Speed tie with Timid Primarina and outspeed Adamant Scizor and Jolly Crawdaunt. Normalium Z lets Bewear use a 190-Base Power Breakneck Blitz. Fluffy cuts the damage dealt by contact moves in half, which gives Bewear a good defensive presence. However, it also gives it an artificial weakness to Fire-type attacks. A Life Orb can be used if the team already has a more crucial Z-Move user, but this leaves Bewear unable to reliably break past the majority of defensive Pokemon and also significantly cuts in on its defensive utility, so it is not preferred.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Swords Dance is generally most useful when trying to break through bulkier balance or stall teams, as versus offensive teams Bewear is often forced out too easily to make setting up worth it. To elaborate on this, Bewear can set up Swords Dance easily on Pokemon such as Blissey or bulky variants of Scizor. Versus stall teams, Bewear should save its Z-Move for breaking past Quagsire, as it cannot do so otherwise. Versus offensive teams, Bewear should be using Double-Edge as much as possible and expending its Z-Move whenever it is most opportune to get an OHKO in order to break through as many Pokemon as possible before fainting. Bring Bewear in on free switches or versus certain physical attackers like Scizor, Alolan Muk, and Mega Aggron in order to keep its health as high as possible. However, be wary of Scizor's Superpower and Alolan Muk's Fire Blast. If possible, attempt to avoid having Bewear inflicted with status effects, as they severely hinder its wallbreaking capabilities. For example, try not to switch Bewear into Pokemon that are known to use Scald, such as Alomomola and Mantine. If there is a Pokemon that Bewear is able to check on the opposing team such as Scizor or Mega Beedrill, try to keep Bewear as healthy as possible to maximize its usefulness against said threats.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Bewear fits well on bulky offense or hyper offense due to its prowess at wallbreaking and ability to act as a soft check to Pokemon like Scizor. Faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users like Latias, Infernape, and Hydreigon can deal with the faster threats that Bewear often struggles to take on, and Bewear can also break past the special walls like Blissey and Alolan Muk that fast special attackers have difficulty breaking through. Pursuit support from Pokemon like Krookodile helps Bewear deal with the various Ghost-types like Jellicent that it has difficulty breaking past. Pursuit users also help Bewear by trapping the various fast Psychic-types in the tier like Latias and Starmie that commonly attempt to force out Bewear. Dark-types as a whole, such as Hydreigon and Mega Sharpedo, can also help to deal with Ghost- and Psychic-types. Volt Switch and U-turn users like Rotom-C, Mega Manectric, and Scizor can help to bring Bewear in safely. Klefki makes a good partner for Bewear, since the Spikes support Klefki provides can significantly ease Bewear's attempts to get KOs, and the Thunder Wave support lets Bewear outspeed more Pokemon on offensive teams. Hazard removal support from Pokemon like Starmie and Hydreigon can help to keep Bewear as healthy as possible by removing Spikes and Toxic Spikes that would normally limit Bewear's usefulness. Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Mamoswine and Nihilego can help Bewear break past teams. Heal Bell support from Pokemon like Mega Altaria and Togekiss can come in handy to cure any troublesome status conditions that Bewear may be inflicted with.</p>"

  "Tsareena": {
    "overview": "<p>Tsareena's good Attack stat, usable Speed tier, and access to a strong STAB move in Power Whip make it a strong wallbreaker. It also has access to a variety of useful coverage moves in High Jump Kick and Knock Off as well as utility moves in Rapid Spin and Synthesis. Queenly Majesty enables Tsareena to avoid priority moves, allowing it to switch in safely on common priority users such as Scizor and revenge kill them without fear of being picked off itself. Its Grass typing and high Attack stat let it threaten common defensive staples such as Quagsire and Alomomola. However, Tsareena's typing gives it weaknesses to common types such as Fire, Flying, and Bug, and while it is somewhat bulky, Tsareena can be easily overwhelmed by common offensive threats such as Infernape, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Manectric. Tsareena's low Speed leaves it outsped and threatened by Pokemon such as Chandelure and Mega Pidgeot. The abundance of other faster and more viable Grass-types in the tier such as Mega Sceptile and Celebi also makes it harder for Tsareena to fit on a team, but they lack the utility that Knock Off and Rapid Spin provide.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Choice Scarf can be run instead of a Choice Band, making Tsareena a somewhat decent revenge killer. However, it is still outsped by common Pokemon such as Mega Manectric, Mega Beedrill, and Mega Aerodactyl as well as most other Choice Scarf users. An offensive set with Life Orb and Synthesis can be run so that Tsareena isn't locked into one move, but it lacks the wallbreaking capabilities that a Choice Band provides. Fightinium Z in conjunction with High Jump Kick allows Tsareena to OHKO Scizor with prior damage, and it doesn't risk missing like a Choice Band set. However, this lacks the immediate power that a Choice Band provides, reducing Tsareena's ability to cripple defensive foes. A defensive Rapid Spin set can be used, but a more offensive set is better to capitalize on Tsareena's high Attack and good movepool. Aromatherapy can be used to cure teammates of status ailments, but Tsareena is outclassed by Sylveon as a cleric and such a set doesn't make use of Tsareena's Attack.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Offensive Fire-types, such as Infernape and Rotom-Heat outspeed Tsareena and can easily OHKO it with their STAB moves while resisting Tsareena's main attacks. Moltres in particular resists all of Tsareena's common moves except Knock Off and can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Togekiss and Crobat resist most of Tsareena's attacks and can outspeed it and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Mandibuzz resists Power Whip and can 2HKO Tsareena with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Infernape and Hydreigon can outspeed Tsareena and OHKO it with super effective moves. Faster offensive Pokemon such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl also outspeed and OHKO Tsareena.</p> <p><strong>Burns</strong>: Burns from moves such as Suicune's Scald halve Tsareena's Attack, meaning that it cannot effectively wallbreak.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Power Whip is Tsareena's main STAB move, OHKOing threats such as Quagsire and Seismitoad, as well as OHKOing Alomomola after Stealth Rock damage. It is also Tsareena's most powerful move for neutral targets such as Sylveon. Knock Off removes key items from foes, such as Amoonguss's Black Sludge and Doublade's Eviolite, and gives useful utility overall. It also allows Tsareena to hit Psychic-types such as Latias and Ghost-types such as Chandelure super effectively. Rapid Spin is an option instead to remove entry hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, which could otherwise cripple Tsareena's team. This allows Tsareena to have more overall utility. High Jump Kick allows Tsareena to hit Steel-types such as Cobalion and Mega Aggron super effectively, as well as being its best way to damage Blissey. U-turn allows Tsareena to generate momentum, bringing in a teammate relatively safely. It also does consistent damage to Psychic-types like Celebi. Play Rough is another option to hit Dragon-types like Mega Altaria, which Tsareena's other moves can't, but this sacrifices a better coverage option in High Jump Kick.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Tsareena to outspeed base 70s and below, which includes key threats such as Volcanion and Primarina. Queenly Majesty allows Tsareena to dodge priority moves such as Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Tsareena should be used to break holes in the opponent's team, which is more crucial against bulky teams. It is best to bring Tsareena in safely with U-turn or Volt Switch, but its decent bulk means it can also take some resisted or weak neutral hits such as Hippowdon's Earthquake. Tsareena should mainly be using Power Whip, as its high Base Power and ability to hit a majority of the tier neutrally or super effectively is good for a Choice Band attacker. Rapid Spin is used best on predicted switches so it doesn't sacrifice too much momentum, and it can also be used as a last resort to allow Tsareena's teammates to sweep more easily. U-turn generates momentum for its team in unfavorable matchups against Pokemon such as Crobat and bulky Scizor so Tsareena can bring in a teammate safely. Its relatively low Speed means that this can be relatively safe, especially if U-turn is used on a predicted switch. However, the move should be used minimally and generally only for this purpose. Use Knock Off mostly on defensive foes that rely on their item, such as Amoonguss. It can also be used to hit Psychic-types such as Latias on the switch. Try to avoid burns from Scald, from Pokemon such as Suicune and Swampert, whenever possible, as they can severely cripple Tsareena's breaking ability.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tsareena works best on offensive teams that appreciate a Pokemon that can break through most defensive cores, as it is able to OHKO Quagsire and OHKO Alomomola after Stealth Rock damage. Tsareena is relatively slow, so teammates such as Choice Scarf Infernape, Choice Scarf Hydreigon, and Mega Aerodactyl that can revenge kill faster threats for Tsareena would be useful. Pokemon such as Scizor and Nidoking can help Tsareena against the majority of Poison-types that can freely switch into it. In return, Tsareena can hit Psychic-types with Knock Off and help against Water- and Ground-types for Nidoking. It also appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Cobalion and Seismitoad so it can wear down potential checks and further pressure foes with residual damage. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Latias and Empoleon is useful so that pivoting with U-turn does not wear Tsareena and its teammates down too much, allowing Tsareena to freely use Knock Off. Tsareena can form a VoltTurn core with Pokemon such as Scizor and Mega Manectric to further pressure foes.</p>"

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Rapid Spin allows Tsareena to remove entry hazards, letting teammates come in and out more easily. Power Whip is Tsareena's most powerful STAB move, giving it the best one-on-one matchup possible against opposing Stealth Rock setters like Hippowdon, Swampert, and Rhyperior. U-turn lets Tsareena keep up offensive momentum, safely bringing teammates into favorable positions. High Jump Kick hits other Stealth Rock users such as Cobalion, Stakataka, and Mega Aggron for respectable damage while also making Tsareena a great Bisharp revenge killer in combination with Queenly Majesty. Knock Off most notably punishes Ghost-types like Gengar, Doublade, and Chandelure, which can threaten to block Rapid Spin. Additionally, it can cripple common switch-ins such as Rotom-H, Togekiss, and Amoonguss by removing their items and potentially preventing their passive recovery. Synthesis is an alternative option to keep Tsareena at high amounts of health to more reliably perform its role, but this can be hard to justify over other move options.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 Speed EVs along with a Jolly nature guarantee that Tsareena outspeeds Pokemon such as Bisharp, Volcanion, and Adamant Mamoswine. Lum Berry lets Tsareena act as a more reliable check to bulky Pokemon like Suicune, Empoleon, and Hippowdon, curing it of the status ailments they induce. Queenly Majesty prevents priority moves from hitting Tsareena, allowing it to more easily revenge kill Bisharp, Scizor, and Crawdaunt if needed.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Bring Tsareena into favorable positions against bulky Water- and Ground-types, which it can immediately threaten. The most notable examples include Stealth Rock setters such as Empoleon, Swampert, and Hippowdon, as well as other foes like Suicune, Slowbro, and bulky Primarina. Tsareena's main purpose tends to be keeping entry hazards off the user's field, meaning it should take advantage of these one-on-one matchups to use Rapid Spin. Knock Off is best used early-game to remove items of common switch-ins or to prevent Ghost-types from coming in to block Rapid Spin. Lum Berry allows Tsareena to come in aggressively on Scald and Toxic users like Suicune, Empoleon, and Hippowdon, but it should be more wary if its Berry has already been used. Keep Tsareena healthy if removing entry hazards appears to be a pressing priority at some point later on, or if it is necessary to handle a certain foe. Queenly Majesty blocks Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Scizor's Bullet Punch, so preserving Tsareena to revenge kill either one could prove beneficial as well. However, Scizor must be sufficiently weakened to do so. Take advantage of favorable positions by throwing out powerful attacks or using U-turn to keep up momentum, getting teammates into good spots to perform their roles. A common example is Choice Band Scizor locked into Bullet Punch, which Tsareena walls completely and can use to gain momentum.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Tsareena is best used on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its Rapid Spin support and its ability to threaten bulky Water- and Ground-types. Tsareena possesses great defensive synergy with Water-types such as Volcanion, Slowbro, and Primarina, making them natural partners, as they can absorb Fire- and Ice-type moves aimed at it. Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Moltres takes full advantage of Tsareena's Rapid Spin support, as well as of its ability to threaten some of its main checks in Empoleon and Rhyperior. In return, Moltres punishes Amoonguss and bulky Steel-types like Mega Aggron and Doublade for Tsareena. Rotom-H and Nihilego offer great checks to Tsareena's primary counters in Flying-types, performing their respective roles after Tsareena gets them into favorable positions to do so with U-turn. Tsareena also removes Rotom-H's need to run Defog itself, freeing up a valuable moveslot. Grounded Poison-types such as Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and the aforementioned Nihilego are heavily appreciated, helping to alleviate some of Tsareena's occasional struggles in removing Toxic Spikes. Its Spikes support makes Klefki a nice partner, helping to wear down Amoonguss and bulky Steel-types as they continually switch into Tsareena. Mega Aerodactyl, Krookodile, and Scizor offer Pursuit utlity, making opposing Ghost-types more easily manageable if Tsareena lacks Knock Off. Mega Aerodactyl doubles as a strong answer to Flying-types.</p>"

  "Palossand": {
    "overview": "<p>Palossand has a small niche in the UnderUsed metagame over other Stealth Rock setters, capable of checking several physical attackers like Mega Aerodactyl, Cobalion, Zeraora, and one of the most threatening wallbreakers in the tier, Terrakion. Its Ground typing gives it an Electric immunity that prevents Mega Manectric and Zeraora from using Volt Switch to switch out, while its Ghost typing gives it a Fighting immunity and resistance to U-turn. However, Palossand is fairly passive and is prone to becoming setup fodder for Pokemon such as Swords Dance Scizor and Nasty Plot Togekiss. Palossand also faces competition from other Stealth Rock setters like Hippowdon, Gligar, Swampert, and even Seismitoad to an extent as it exerts less offensive pressure and has no phazing move. Hippowdon's overall superior bulk and much more useful ability makes it usually a better pick than Palossand.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Palossand could run a spread with maximum HP and Defense to make it an even bulkier physical wall, but this leaves it unable to check Mega Manectric as well now that it can be 2HKOed by Hidden Power. Shadow Ball hits Latias, chips Celebi on the switch, and prevents Palossand from being hard walled by Bronzong, but this is usually an inferior choice due to Toxic having overall far more utility, and Calm Mind variants of Latias can still defeat Palossand.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Hydreigon and Krookodile can easily switch into Palossand and fire back a strong Dark-type move or Pursuit trap it once it's weakened, in Krookodile's case. However, both of these Pokemon can get badly poisoned by Toxic on the switch. Bisharp and Mega Houndoom also hit Palossand but aren't safe switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Even with Water Compaction, Palossand cannot take a hit from most physical Water-type moves and has even bigger issues with special Water-type attacks. Primarina, Feraligatr, and Crawdaunt hit Palossand really hard with no drawbacks, while Suicune uses it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Pokemon</strong>: Latias, Hydreigon, Moltres, and Rotom-H are good switch-ins because they are immune to Palossand’s Earth Power, the former also being able to use it as a setup opportunity. However, they do all dislike being poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Status-resistant Setup Sweepers</strong>: Swords Dance Scizor, Nasty Plot Togekiss, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Reuniclus can all take a Toxic and still reliably use Palossand as setup fodder. Scizor is immune to Toxic, Togekiss can use Heal Bell to remove Toxic poison, and Celebi and Reuniclus generally don't care about status due to their abilities.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Ice-types like Mamoswine and Kyurem both deal hefty damage to Palossand with their Ice-type attacks while SubRoost Kyurem uses Palossand as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types like Gengar, Mimikyu, and Chandelure aren’t good switch-ins to Palossand, but they can still easily pressure it if they can switch in. Jellicent has the added benefit of not caring about Earth Power.</p>",

Toxic lets Palossand pressure Ground-immune foes like Hydreigon, Latias, and Rotom-H. It's also integral to pressure bulky Pokemon and setup sweepers.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Investments of 252 HP EVs and 92 SpD EVs with Leftovers let Palossand survive Hidden Power followed by Overheat after Stealth Rock from Mega Manectric. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 132 Def / 124 SpD with a Colbur Berry prevents Mega Manectric from 2HKOing Palossand with Hidden Power after Stealth Rock damage. These items both find their uses for Palossand, as Leftovers is used as passive recovery, while a Colbur Berry makes Palossand less weak to Pursuit and can be used to beat a weakened Mega Houndoom while also minimizing the damage of Knock Off from Scizor, Bisharp, and Krookodile. Palossand's ability Water Compaction is only useful in stalling out Aqua Tail variants of Mega Aerodactyl by using Shore Up and Toxic.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Palossand is given many opportunities to switch in and set up Stealth Rock. It can easily switch into Cobalion, Terrakion, and physical variants of Infernape and Lucario. Palossand can also pivot into a Volt Switch from Mega Manectric, Zeraora, or Rotom-H and drain vital momentum from the opposing team. Shore Up should be used to keep your Palossand healthy, especially in long matches. Toxic is an overall amazing utility move, and it is imperative that it should be used against opposing walls, Ground-immune Pokemon, and setup sweepers that cannot handle the status. However, you must prevent your Palossand from becoming poisoned itself, as this hinders its longevity. Its Ghost typing makes non-Colbur Berry Palossand appear to be weak to Pursuit trappers, but it surprisingly enough doesn't have the worst matchup against them. With proper prediction, it can even beat some trappers like Choice Scarf Krookodile by using Shore Up to scout for Pursuit or Knock Off. However, do not become too paranoid against a Scizor set that you don't know yet, as you could predict wrong, and the Scizor could end up being a Swords Dance variant.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pairing Palossand with Empoleon forms a solid balance core. Empoleon is able to remove entry hazards, wall Primarina, and check problematic Dragon-types, while Palossand offers immunities to Electric and Fighting, which are very beneficial for Empoleon. Palossand usually works really well with Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Mega Altaria, and Florges, as they all stop Palossand's most common switch-in, Hydreigon. Many of them also have Heal Bell to cure off poison from Palossand. In return, Palossand checks bulky Steel-types such as Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix. Pokemon weak to Terrakion like Nihilego, Rotom-H, and Moltres appreciate Palossand being one of the very few Pokemon that hard walls it. Cobalion and Terrakion are good partners for Palossand, as they scare away setup sweepers like Togekiss and Bisharp. Blissey, and the rare RestTalk Snorlax are two special walls that detest Fighting-type moves, so Palossand can easily pivot in for them, and these two can absorb status for it. Scizor makes a great partner as it appreciates Palossand being able to remove Cobalion and Mega Altaria for it. In return it is capable of dealing with Pokemon like Celebi, Mimikyu, and Latias that Palossand struggles to deal with.</p>"

  "Pyukumuku": {
    "overview": "<p>Pyukumuku's fantastic defensive stats, great defensive typing, and access to Unaware carve it out a strong niche on stall teams as a stop to various stallbreakers, such as Nasty Plot Lucario, Calm Mind Reuniclus, Block Slowbro, and Superpower Nidoking. Furthermore, Pyukumuku's unique set of tools allows it to break opposing stall teams by trapping and removing key foes with either Toxic or Spite. However, Pyukumuku is held back by how passive it is, allowing Taunt users such as Hydreigon, Mew, and Krookodile to completely shut it down and often giving free momentum to Scizor, which cannot be punished with Toxic on the switch due to its Steel typing. Pyukumuku's passivity is especially noticeable when running Rest with Spite, as it has no way of dissuading Pokemon such as Taunt Hydreigon and Mega Manectric from coming in. Certain stallbreakers are also able to set up on and break through Pyukumuku with little issue, such as Heracross, Haxorus, and Leaf Storm Celebi, meaning that teams with Pyukumuku will need to cover these Pokemon with teammates such as Mega Altaria and Scizor.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Counter can be used to punish U-turn users such as Scizor that would otherwise freely come in and gain momentum off of Pyukumuku and to possibly revenge kill unsuspecting physical attackers such as Terrakion. This move is generally hard to fit onto Pyukumuku's moveset, however. Protect can be run to improve Pyukumuku's matchup against Nasty Plot Togekiss by gaining extra HP between uses of Air Slash. It also allows Pyukumuku to scout for possible Z-Moves intended to surprise it and for Choice item users such as Primarina. This move is also hard to fit onto Pyukumuku's moveset, however, preventing Pyukumuku from either trapping targets or badly poisoning Steel-types if running Toxic, or making Pyukumuku more vulnerable to Toxic if running Spite. An alternative EV spread with maximum Defense investment can allow Pyukumuku to handle physical attackers such as Dragon Dance Mega Altaria and Swords Dance Terrakion, but other teammates such as Quagsire can also do this, and Pyukumuku loses out on its ability to check a large number of specially offensive stallbreakers.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt users such as Hydreigon, Mew, and Krookodile are able to completely shut down Pyukumuku, forcing it to either use Struggle or switch out. Nidoking can also opt to run Taunt over Substitute to break past Pyukumuku.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Can't Be Trapped</strong>: Due to Pyukumuku's reliance on trapping Pokemon with Block in order to break them, Ghost-types and U-turn and Volt Switch users are an issue. U-turn users immune to Toxic such as Scizor and Mega Beedrill are particularly problematic, as they can switch in freely and gain free momentum against Pyukumuku's team. Ghost-types such as Doublade and Gengar also pose a problem, as they can switch in and waste Block's PP without having to worry about being badly poisoned due to their typings. Doublade can also cripple Pyukumuku with Toxic if it is not running Rest, while Gengar can waste Pyukumuku's PP and set up a Substitute on it if it is not running Spite.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-type Pokemon such as Mega Manectric and Zeraora pose a huge threat to Pyukumuku. Zeraora can KO Pyukumuku with Plasma Fists, and both Pokemon can gain free momentum with Volt Switch while threatening common Ground-type partners that might attempt to block Volt Switch such as Quagsire and Gligar with their coverage moves, such as Hidden Power, Grass Knot, and Knock Off. Rotom-H is also problematic, as it is able to gain free momentum against Pyukumuku with Volt Switch, spread status with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, and heal itself while wearing down targets such as Blissey with Pain Split. All of these Pokemon need to be wary of Toxic from Pyukumuku when switching in, however.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-type Pokemon such as Tsareena and Mega Sceptile can easily KO Pyukumuku, while Tsareena can gain momentum with U-turn and rid itself of Toxic once if running Lum Berry. Celebi can also be a threat if it is running a Leaf Storm + Nasty Plot set.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Mega Altaria and Choice Band Terrakion are capable of easily beating Pyukumuku. Mega Altaria in particular is a very large threat, either shrugging off Toxic with Refresh or taking advantage of being poisoned with Facade, making it much more dangerous to switch into.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazards can allow stallbreakers such as Nidoking and Infernape to potentially 2HKO Pyukumuku on the switch, and if Pyukumuku is badly poisoned, stallbreakers such as Celebi and Togekiss can set up on Pyukumuku and break through it. This can be further confounded by Pyukumuku being forced to pivot in a lot to deal with these stallbreakers, as the opponent can double switch to a Pokemon that can force Pyukumuku out again, meaning it will frequently take damage from entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma and Haxorus</strong>: Due to Photon Geyser and Mold Breaker ignoring Unaware, Necrozma and Haxorus are able to break through Pyukumuku by boosting with Swords Dance, or potentially Calm Mind in Necrozma's case. However, both of these Pokemon must be wary of Toxic putting them on a timer.</p>",

      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Block allows Pyukumuku to trap more passive Pokemon that cannot directly threaten it such as Mega Aggron and Sylveon in order to either PP stall or Toxic stall them. The move also allows Pyukumuku to trap threatening stallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Infernape and Lucario that Pyukumuku can beat due to Unaware. Toxic allows Pyukumuku to cripple Pokemon such as Taunt Hydreigon and Mega Manectric that would otherwise switch in freely. It also lets Pyukumuku stall out offensive Pokemon that it beats, such as Calm Mind Latias, Nasty Plot Togekiss, and Volcanion. Soak allows Pyukumuku to use Toxic against Steel- and Poison-types, which are otherwise immune to it. It also helps Pyukumuku against targets such as Cobalion and Lucario by removing the STAB bonus from their attacks. Spite allows Pyukumuku to PP stall stallbreakers such as Reuniclus and Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure that are unable to be stalled out with Toxic. Rest in conjunction with Spite allows Pyukumuku to beat stallbreakers such as Block + Toxic Slowbro while also allowing it to break stall teams itself by trapping and PP stalling targets such as Blissey and Alomomola. Recover lets Pyukumuku check targets such as Nasty Plot Infernape and Lucario throughout the game without needing to use Rest.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Unaware allows Pyukumuku to beat boosting special attackers such as Infernape, as well as some weaker boosting physical attackers such as Mimikyu.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Pyukumuku should be brought in against threatening stallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Infernape and Lucario in order to wall and potentially trap and remove them, and its HP should be carefully conserved otherwise to take their Z-Moves reliably. However, Pyukumuku should be wary of physical sets from both these Pokemon, as they are capable of 2HKOing it. Pyukumuku should try to avoid Toxic users unless it needs to trap them, as removing the status with Rest allows Pokemon such as Psychium Z Nasty Plot Celebi and Substitute Chandelure to come in and 3HKO it. Be careful to conserve Block's PP, as opponents can easily stall out all uses of Block if they switch into a Ghost-type or a U-turn or Volt Switch user. When you predict one of these Pokemon to come in, it is better to either heal up with Recover or double switch instead of wasting Block's PP. If running Soak, Pyukumuku should use it to weaken opposing Pokemon such as Lucario and Cobalion by removing their STAB multipliers, allowing it to better take hits from them. This also allows Pyukumuku to wall Swords Dance Terrakion in a pinch, but only if Terrakion's Z-Move was already used. If running Spite, Pyukumuku should usually only use it against trapped foes in order to conserve its PP. It's often necessary to have a high number of PP for Spite in order to reliably take on Pokemon such as Celebi, Reuniclus, and Chandelure. Pyukumuku should avoid trying to PP stall foes such as Tentacruel and Mantine that have high-PP moves such as Rapid Spin and Haze, and Suicune should also be avoided due to Pressure unless PP stalling it is absolutely necessary. If running Rest and Spite, Pyukumuku should attempt to trap more passive entry hazard setters such as Mega Aggron, Empoleon, and Blissey, as it is not bothered by Toxic and can prevent them from setting entry hazards later in the match, although it should be wary of Roar from the former two. Spite Pyukumuku should also attempt to trap variants of Gligar that do not have U-turn, which is otherwise annoying due to Immunity. If Spite Pyukumuku does not have more important targets, it can be used to dismantle bulkier teams by eliminating Pokemon such as Alomomola, Slowbro, and defensive Moltres. Pyukumuku should be careful about using Rest against targets that aren't trapped, however, as this can offer free turns to the opposing team. Pyukumuku should be careful to scout the movesets and items of Pokemon such as Celebi and Togekiss, as Celebi can run Grassium Z on its Nasty Plot set to break through Pyukumuku, while Choice Scarf Togekiss can use Trick to cripple Pyukumuku and make it functionally useless.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pyukumuku fits on stall teams that appreciate its ability to beat many specially offensive stallbreakers such as Infernape and Lucario. Blissey is a fantastic partner for Pyukumuku, as it can set Stealth Rock to chip away at Pyukumuku's common switch-ins such as Scizor and use Heal Bell to cure Pyukumuku of status, which is especially helpful for Rest variants. Mega Altaria is a fantastic partner for Pyukumuku, capable of easily taking on physical attackers such as Crawdaunt, Tsareena, Haxorus, and Zeraora that force out Pyukumuku. It can also take Knock Off for Pyukumuku, act as a cleric with Heal Bell, remove entry hazards with Defog, and beat one of Pyukumuku's hardest checks in Taunt Hydreigon. Quagsire can form a double Unaware core with Pyukumuku, helping with physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Terrakion and Scizor that Pyukumuku can't deal with. It also provides an Electric immunity to help deal with non-Hidden Power Grass Mega Manectric trying to gain momentum on Pyukumuku. Quagsire can also help to punish U-turn spam with Counter, which also lets it deal with Mega Altaria and Bug Bite Scizor more reliably. Gligar can help deal with Terrakion while providing Defog support to Pyukumuku. In conjunction with Quagsire, it can also cover all variants of Mega Manectric, making Pyukumuku's team much less weak to Volt Switch spam. Nihilego can help Pyukumuku deal with Pokemon such as Leaf Storm Celebi while providing a stronger answer to Nasty Plot Togekiss that does not rely on not flinching. It can also set up Stealth Rock, allowing Blissey to run other moves such as Heal Bell and Wish, and absorb Toxic Spikes that would otherwise hinder Pyukumuku. Scizor can act as a strong answer to Leaf Storm Celebi while providing Defog support and helping deal with Swords Dance Haxorus, which is able to easily break through both Quagsire and Pyukumuku due to its ability Mold Breaker. In return, Pyukumuku can check the Fire-types such as Infernape and Chandelure that can use Scizor as setup fodder.</p>"

  "Silvally-Steel": {
    "overview": "<p>Silvally-Steel presents a unique blend of utility in the UU metagame, most notably bringing Defog and Parting Shot. These traits combined with its solid defensive typing and respectable bulk make Silvally-Steel an effective defensive pivot for bulky offense and balance teams. Common Pokemon checked or pivoted into by Silvally-Steel include the ever-present Scizor, Latias, and Hydreigon. However, Silvally-Steel finds itself more passive than it would prefer, often relying on Toxic to pressure foes itself. Silvally-Steel also possesses no means of recovery, making it easily worn down when pivoting into entry hazards and foes' attacks. Additionally, common Stealth Rock users such as Hippowdon, Swampert, Stakataka, and Terrakion threaten Silvally-Steel and can usually keep up their entry hazards on it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>U-turn is an option over Parting Shot to do a bit of damage when pivoting out and to prevent Bisharp from gaining a Defiant boost, but it is generally less useful than dropping foes' attacking stats. Steel-type STAB moves like Flash Cannon and Multi-Attack let Silvally-Steel deal decent damage to Fairy- and Rock-types, though they are hard to justify over other options. Thunder Wave cripples offensive foes more than Toxic, but it is much less useful overall. Protect lets Silvally-Steel scout Choice item users such as Krookodile and Infernape, pairing nicely with Parting Shot as a means of gaining momentum, though it is difficult to find room for on usual sets.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Commonly pivoting in and out while lacking any form of recovery makes Silvally-Steel incredibly vulnerable to residual damage, at times leaving it too weak to perform its intended roles.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Pokemon like Terrakion, Infernape, and Cobalion threaten Silvally-Steel with their powerful Fighting-type STAB moves, forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Volcanion, and Moltres fear little from Silvally-Steel outside of Toxic and can deal huge damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Nidoking, Mamoswine, and Krookodile all present a huge threat to Silvally-Steel with their super effective STAB moves.</p>",

      "Defog Pivot": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Defog removes all entry hazards, helping out teammates that may be vulnerable to them. Parting Shot allows Silvally-Steel to act as a solid pivot, lowering foes' offensive stats and potentially offering teammates free switch opportunities. Toxic cripples Pokemon such as Slowbro, Swampert, and Latias, helping to mitigate Silvally-Steel's lack of offensive presence. Flamethrower threatens opposing Steel-types, most notably letting Silvally-Steel check Scizor.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum HP investment combined with 200 Special Defense EVs and a Calm nature make Silvally-Steel as specially bulky as possible, letting it more effectively pivot into common threats like Latias, Nihilego, and Hydreigon. 56 Speed EVs are necessary to outrun maximum Speed Adamant Bisharp and threaten it with Flamethrower. RKS System in tandem with Steel Memory gives Silvally-Steel its typing.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Silvally-Steel's primary role is acting as a solid defensive pivot early- to mid-game, commonly switching into Pokemon whose STAB moves it resists like Latias, Scizor, and Nihilego. These generally favorable matchups offer Silvally-Steel opportunities to clear entry hazards with Defog or to keep up momentum with Parting Shot. Given its lack of recovery, Spikes is especially annoying for Silvally-Steel and often makes clearing entry hazards a bigger priority. Parting Shot is best utilized either when predicting a switch or to escape an unfavorable one-on-one matchup, providing teammates with safer opportunities to switch in. Toxic lets Silvally-Steel fare better against offensive threats like Latias and Hydreigon while also crippling bulky foes such as Hippowdon and Swampert that threaten to keep up Stealth Rock. Silvally-Steel is worn down fairly easily when performing its roles, so gauge when it is necessary to let it take damage if it is needed later on to check a specific threat like Scizor.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Silvally-Steel fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to pivot and remove entry hazards. Entry hazard-weak wallbreakers like Moltres, Volcanion, and Kyurem take advantage of Silvally-Steel's Defog support and the safe switches from Parting Shot. Dragon-types like Latias, Hydreigon, and Mega Altaria possess great defensive synergy with Silvally-Steel, absorbing various attacks that hit it super effectively. In return, Silvally-Steel can pivot into the Ice- and Fairy-type moves aimed at them. Flying-types such as Togekiss and Mega Aerodactyl share similarly solid synergy while also appreciating Silvally-Steel's ability to pivot into Scizor. Rhyperior, Nihilego, and Diancie can all set up Stealth Rock while covering opposing Flying-types like Moltres and Togekiss that threaten Silvally-Steel. Wish users such as Alomomola and Sylveon help to mitigate Silvally-Steel’s tendency to get worn down easily, making them solid options alongside it.</p>"

  "Mimikyu": {
    "overview": "<p>Mimikyu has a solid place on UU offensive teams as a revenge killer and cleaner. Its STAB moves provide neutral coverage on the entire tier while its typing makes it one of the few Ghost-types that aren't forced out by Pursuit, and it can threaten most Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Krookodile with a super effective STAB Play Rough. Arguably, Mimikyu's biggest selling point is its brilliant ability in Disguise, which guarantees it a free turn without taking damage. This allows it to check and revenge kill faster offensive threats such as Latias, Mega Sharpedo, and Terrakion, as well as providing it with an opportunity to break through bulkier teams in conjunction with Swords Dance. Mimikyu can also act as a valuable spinblocker, as it is able to apply decent offensive pressure against Starmie and Tentacruel. However, Mimikyu's initial damage output can be rather underwhelming, as it struggles to be a threat to physically bulkier threats such as Amoonguss, and without the use of Wood Hammer, it is impossible for it to beat Quagsire and Pyukumuku. The omnipresence of Steel-types also hinders Mimikyu's ability to thrive in the tier, as even with multiple boosts, it can fail to break through bulkier Steel-types such as Mega Aggron, while offensive Steel-types like Cobalion can outspeed and OHKO it after its Disguise has been busted. Furthermore, while Disguise provides it with the ability to check a large number of Pokemon, Mimikyu is unable to switch into any of them, as once it loses its Disguise, it loses most of its utility. Its average Speed stat also means that it has to rely heavily on Disguise to check faster offensive threats such as Hydreigon or on a weaker move in Shadow Sneak in order to revenge kill foes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Wood Hammer can be used over Shadow Claw to have an improved matchup against stall, as it's able to break through the classic Blissey + Alomomola + Quagsire core and also 2HKOes Pyukumuku. However, Mimikyu ends up taking a huge amount of recoil damage from this, often KOing itself in the process before being able to make a major dent in the team, and the loss of Shadow Claw means that it's completely unable to break through Steel-types and other bulky Fairy-resistant Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Rotom-H. Red Card can be a nice item to utilize Mimikyu's Disguise by forcing in a random Pokemon when it has been busted, either for a free setup turn or to force out an opposing setup sweeper.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mimikyu fails to even 2HKO bulky Steel-type Pokemon such as Mega Aggron and Mega Steelix and is OHKOed by their Steel-type STAB attacks. Scizor OHKOes Mimikyu with priority Bullet Punch, and Mimikyu can't OHKO Scizor without boosts, while Doublade's high Defense stat allows it to beat Mimikyu one-on-one. Cobalion has enough natural bulk to avoid being 2HKOed by Mimikyu and is able to OHKO it in return with Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Unaware Pokemon</strong>: Mimikyu relies heavily on boosts, so unless it's running Wood Hammer to combat Unaware Quagsire and Pyukumuku, it's not going to be able to break through them. Quagsire can also potentially render Mimikyu useless if it's able to burn it with Scald or wear it down with Toxic, and Pyukumuku can drain its PP with Spite.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Amoonguss, and Rhyperior are able to comfortably take boosted attacks from Mimikyu and annoy it back by either burning it with Scald, removing its stat boosts with Clear Smog, or KOing it with Earthquake or Stone Edge. Hippowdon can also be problematic, as it has enough natural bulk to take any attack from Mimikyu at +4, can phaze it with Whirlwind, and can recover damage off with Slack Off.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl can be quite problematic to Mimikyu if its Disguise has been busted, as they're able to take advantage of Mimikyu's low defenses and KO it before it's able to sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Swords Dance compensates for Mimikyu's otherwise average damage output, providing it with better chances to OHKO faster threats such as Latias, Celebi, and Gengar with Shadow Sneak. Play Rough is Mimikyu's most powerful Fairy-type STAB move, allowing it to beat targets such as Mega Altaria, Krookodile, and Hydreigon. Shadow Claw is its most powerful Ghost-type STAB attack and provides it with perfect neutral coverage. Shadow Sneak gives Mimikyu a priority move, compensating for its average Speed tier to revenge kill faster, weakened threats such as Latias, Terrakion, and Mega Aerodactyl.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>252 EVs in Attack and Speed allows Mimikyu to hit as hard and as fast as possible. An Adamant nature helps boost Mimikyu's damage output and claim a number of KOs that a Jolly nature misses out on, such as OHKOing Krookodile with an unboosted Play Rough after Stealth Rock and OHKOing Choice Band Scizor with a +2 Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. On the other hand, a Jolly nature is needed for Mimikyu to outpace non-Choice Scarf Krookodile, Nidoking, and Rotom-H, which can break its Disguise if they outspeed it, potentially costing it opportunities to set up and turns on the battlefield. Life Orb provides Mimikyu with a consistent damage output, making it the preferred item. However, Ghostium Z is a nice option, as Never-Ending Nightmare can help against Pokemon that it otherwise struggles to break through, being able to OHKO Cobalion and bulky Scizor sets at +2 after Stealth Rock, as well as doing the same to Amoonguss when running an Adamant nature. However, by forgoing Life Orb, Mimikyu misses out on a number of KOs against other threats, such as KOing offensive Mega Altaria with Play Rough and potentially taking out Gengar with Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Most of Mimikyu's utility comes from its ability Disguise, so it is optimal to avoid letting Mimikyu take any hits, especially if there are offensive threats that Mimikyu can take out such as Latias. This is also applicable when trying to use Mimikyu as a spinblocker against Tentacruel or Starmie, because if they opt to attack instead of attempting to use Rapid Spin, Mimikyu's Disguise will be busted. In earlier stages of the game, Mimikyu should be used to revenge kill slower foes with Play Rough or Shadow Claw and revenge kill faster, weakened foes with Shadow Sneak, but it can also be used to switch in on Pokemon that it can comfortably check such as Latias and force them out. Mimikyu can also prevent opposing Pokemon from sweeping teams such as by KOing a boosted Mega Altaria with Play Rough or KOing a boosted Celebi, as it is guaranteed to survive a hit thanks to its Disguise. If Mimikyu is able to avoid situations where its Disguise has been broken, it can also potentially be used as a late-game cleaner, using its Disguise as a free opportunity to boost its Attack stat with Swords Dance, allowing it to break through bulker targets such as Hippowdon more easily and to KO faster foes from full with Shadow Claw such as Latias, Celebi, and opposing Mimikyu as long as their own Disguise is busted.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Mimikyu is a staple Pokemon on hazard stacking teams, as it's immune to Rapid Spin, and entry hazards allow Mimikyu to claim a number of KOs that it normally would struggle to get, leading to it often being paired with hazard setters such as Froslass and Araquanid or offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Cobalion, Mamoswine, and Terrakion. It can also be used on bulkier teams as an offensive Fairy-type, commonly in place of Mega Altaria when the Mega slot has been filled by another Pokemon, filling the role of a much-needed check to threats such as Latias and Mega Altaria. Checks to Steel-types are mandatory for teams with Mimikyu, as it struggles to break through them and is KOed by all their Steel-type attacks. Noteworthy examples of these checks are Cobalion, Infernape, and Lucario. Cobalion is also able to provide an offensive Stealth Rock setter, while Infernape and Lucario significantly improve the team's matchup against stall, as they're both able to OHKO Quagsire with All-Out Pummeling after Stealth Rock or comfortably 2HKO it with Life Orb-boosted Focus Blast. All of these are also able to improve the matchup against Dark-types such as Hydreigon and Sharpedo. Other wallbreakers that commonly find themselves on hyper offense teams tend to perform well with Mimikyu. Dragonium Z Latias pairs brilliantly with Mimikyu, as it's able to take out Quagsire due to it ignoring Latias's Special Attack drops from Draco Meteor while pressuring Blissey with Psyshock and Steel-types with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Sharpedo can act as a valuable late-game cleaner while also being able to comfortably pressure Ghost-types that Mimikyu dislikes such as Gengar and Chandelure.</p>"

Its access to Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes can allow it to function as a reliable offensive entry hazard setter, using its typing and coverage to threaten out many common entry hazard removers, though it also has the option of running moves such as Protect and Pain Split to more easily work around its checks. Thanks to its typing, coverage, and Speed, Nihilego can also utilize Choice Scarf to revenge kill several of the tier's threatening forces, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Altaria, Terrakion, and Celebi. Moreover, its excellent special bulk for an offensive Pokemon can allow it to sponge weaker or resisted special attacks well, take on Flying-types like Moltres and Togekiss, and blanket check foes like Gengar, Mega Manectric, and Choice Scarf Hydreigon if need be. Unfortunately, Nihilego is at times held back by its terrible physical bulk, which allows the tier's several faster physical threats, including Cobalion and Zeraora, to easily take advantage of it. This also leaves it vulnerable to Pursuit and powerful priority attacks, most notably Scizor's Bullet Punch. It's also unable to power through the tier's surplus of Ground- and Steel-types with its STAB moves alone, which allows most to tank a hit and KO Nihilego with super effective attacks. Nihilego can also struggle to break through a few key defensive Pokemon in the metagame, such as Blissey and Mega Steelix, compromising its wallbreaking capabilities. Lastly, while Nihilego's Speed and typing provide plentiful perks, they also leave it outrun and overwhelmed by a few tier staples, such as Terrakion, Latias, and Cobalion.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Passho Berry can prevent Nihilego from being revenge killed by Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt while also giving it an easier time removing Water-types like Primarina, Empoleon, and Tentacruel. Choice Specs turns Nihilego into a formidable wallbreaker with great coverage, though this makes it easier to reliably revenge kill, as it doesn't particularly enjoy being locked into any of its attacks and has a slightly exploitable Speed tier. Hidden Power Fire covers the omnipresent Scizor, though since it already takes healthy damage from Power Gem and Gigavolt Havoc, it often isn't worth the trouble.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types resist Nihilego's STAB combination and can KO it with super effective attacks. Klefki and Mega Aggron often can't be 2HKOed by Gigavolt Havoc followed by Thunderbolt and can threaten Nihilego with paralysis and STAB Heavy Slam. Cobalion, Doublade, and Lucario are all more susceptible to strong neutral attacks but can still force Nihilego out and garner opportunities to set up in the process. Mega Steelix is particularly troublesome, as it is immune to Gigavolt Havoc, doesn't take heavy damage from anything Nihilego can hit it with, and carries two STAB attacks capable of OHKOing Nihilego from full HP. Assault Vest variants of Bisharp are also often annoying, as they don't take very much damage from Nihilego's moves while threatening it with Iron Head and Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Several Ground-types resist Nihilego's STAB combination, making them sturdy checks. Although Krookodile, Swampert, and Hippowdon have to look out for Grass Knot on the switch, they can take the attack once while OHKOing Nihilego in return with STAB Earthquake. Nidoking and Nidoqueen both resist Nihilego's STAB combination, but they do have to be wary of Hidden Power Ice. Gligar must look out for Hidden Power Ice also, though otherwise it can't be 2HKOed by Nihilego and can OHKO it or take advantage of it for free turns.</p> <p><strong>Fast Physical Attackers</strong>: Nihilego's poor Defense allows heavy-hitting, fast physical attackers to overwhelm it. Examples include Terrakion, Zeraora, and Mega Aerodactyl as well as physical Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Krookodile.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: The likes of Blissey and Mega Steelix can repeatedly tank hits from Nihilego while threatening it with Seismic Toss or Earthquake. Assault Vest variants of Alolan Muk and Bisharp can also tank multiple hits while trapping Nihilego with Pursuit. Empoleon must look out for Gigavolt Havoc but otherwise is only 3HKOed by Thunderbolt, so it can Defog Nihilego's entry hazards away or wear it down with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Nihilego's pitiful physical bulk allows Scizor, Bisharp, Lucario, and Crawdaunt to heavily damage or outright KO it with their respective priority moves.</p>",

      "3 Attacks": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Thunderbolt provides coverage against troublesome bulky Water-types such as Empoleon, Slowbro, and Tentacruel. With Electrium Z, it turns into a powerful Gigavolt Havoc capable of OHKOing the aforementioned Water-types after some chip damage while heavily damaging Steel-types like Scizor, Bisharp, and Cobalion. Grass Knot nails various Ground-types that could otherwise wall Nihilego, like Krookodile, Hippowdon, and Swampert. Hidden Power Ice allows Nihilego to keep entry hazards up against Gligar and is also its strongest attack to punish Nidoqueen and Nidoking, which otherwise sponge anything Nihilego can throw at them and can absorb its Toxic Spikes. Power Gem is an option over Grass Knot, sacrificing coverage on Ground-types for a STAB attack capable of hitting Fire-types and Ice-types like Rotom-H, Kyurem, and Chandelure super effectively while hitting Scizor harder than Thunderbolt. It can also hit Flying-types harder than Thunderbolt, KOing Moltres and Crobat in one hit. Nihilego can set Stealth Rock as it forces switches, punishing the opponent's switches with chip damage. Protect can be used in tandem with Black Sludge to scout for moves on Choice-locked Pokemon, like Choice Band Scizor and Terrakion and Choice Scarf Krookodile, while passively restoring Nihilego's HP. Toxic Spikes can also be set on forced switches, racking up poison damage on foes as they come in. Thunder can be run in place of Thunderbolt to more easily power through Gigavolt Havoc's targets, requiring notably less chip damage to OHKO Empoleon and Tentacruel while always OHKOing Bisharp after Stealth Rock. However, it has limited use outside of this due to its shaky accuracy despite its higher power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Sludge should be run as Nihilego's item  to improve its longevity and when used with Protect it can passively restore its HP as it scouts foes' attacks. Electrium Z lets Nihilego lure and KO several Water- and Steel-types, such as Tentacruel, Empoleon, Doublade, and Bisharp, punishing them with heavy damage. Life Orb is another option if another teammate is running a Z-Move, putting power behind Nihilego's moves and notably allowing it to OHKO Primarina with Sludge Wave and 2HKO Empoleon with Thunderbolt. It can complicate Nihilego's entry hazard setting capabilities by cutting into its longevity, however. Beast Boost allows Nihilego to increase its Special Attack upon netting KOs. An EV spread of 80 HP / 176 SpA / 252 Spe allows Nihilego to boost its Speed instead of its Special Attack with Beast Boost, though this can notably cut into its damage output at times, preventing it from reliably OHKOing Swampert with Grass Knot, for instance.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>If Nihilego is running Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes, it should attempt to set them early-game in order to immediately apply pressure to the opposing team. It should do this against special attackers that can't hit it hard, like Moltres, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-H, or against passive defensive Pokemon like Alomomola and Florges. After setting entry hazards, Nihilego should capitalize on its good coverage and power to try punching holes in opposing teams. Later on in the game, when its checks have been removed or weakened, Nihilego can try cleaning up thanks to its decent Speed and Beast Boost, especially if it is running the investment necessary to receive a Speed boost. If Protect is being run in the fourth slot, it should be used against potential Choice item Pokemon like Scizor, Krookodile, and Hydreigon to scout for their attack. This also allows Nihilego to passively restore health with Black Sludge to better handle Pokemon like Togekiss and Mega Manectric. If Toxic Spikes is being used, Nihilego should only set one layer against offensive teams, as most Pokemon on these teams won't stay in play long, making consistent poison damage an easy method of quickly chipping them down. Against defensive teams, however, two layers should be set in order to rack up poison damage over time against the passive Pokemon often found on these builds. Electrium Z is best activated against offensive Steel-types and bulky Water-types, such as Bisharp, Mega Aggron, and Mega Slowbro, as otherwise these Pokemon would be able to tank a hit and pressure Nihilego. Prediction is important in securing KOs against Pokemon that could tank a hit and KO Nihilego. For instance, if a Ground-type like Hippowdon or Krookodile is expected to switch in, Nihilego should try nabbing them with Grass Knot on the switch in order to secure the 2HKO without taking any damage itself. Nihilego shouldn't stay in on physical attackers that it can't outrun or KO, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Steelix, and Mega Aggron, due to its awful physical bulk. It should also look out for powerful priority attacks from foes like Scizor, Bisharp, and Crawdaunt, Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Krookodile, and Pursuit from the aforementioned Scizor, Bisharp, and Krookodile.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Nihilego fits well onto several different archetypes, ranging from hyper offense to balance, thanks to the useful offensive and defensive utility it provides to teams it's placed on. If Nihilego is running Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes, setup sweepers like Latias, Mega Altaria, and Lucario appreciate its ability to chip down opposing teams. The latter two appreciate its ability to deal with Moltres as well. Wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Crawdaunt, and Volcanion also enjoy its entry hazard support for this reason. If Nihilego wishes to forego entry hazards for Protect, other setters like Mega Aggron, Cobalion, and Hippowdon, which can additionally support Nihilego with Sand Stream, can let it more comfortably do so while also allowing Nihilego to more easily muscle past opposing Pokemon. Steel-type checks like Infernape, Suicune, and Moltres can weaken or entirely remove a few particularly troublesome answers to Nihilego, such as Mega Aggron, Mega Steelix, and Klefki. Ground-type answers, such as Tsareena, Celebi, and Primarina, can also be important for easing Nihilego's matchups against them while also potentially allowing it to more comfortably run Power Gem. Pivots like Scizor and Hydreigon can bring Nihilego in more easily, since it at times won't be able to comfortably come into play on account of its poor Defense. Pokemon capable of tanking a few physical attacks, like Gligar, Doublade, and Cobalion, can help Nihilego more easily circumvent its physical frailty. In return, Nihilego can reliably come in on a few troublesome special attackers for the aforementioned teammates to face, such as Mega Manectric and Celebi. Pokemon that appreciate a sturdy check to Fairy-types, such as Hydreigon, Latias, and Mega Altaria, benefit from Nihilego's support. Infernape particularly pairs up well with Nihilego, appreciating its ability to check Flying-types and threaten Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Primarina, checking Steel-types for it in return, and benefiting immensely from its Toxic Spikes support if being used. Specially frail Pokemon can also benefit from Nihilego's ability to blanket check a few important special attackers, meaning the likes of Bisharp and Slowbro will often appreciate it as a teammate.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Grass Knot allows Nihilego to revenge kill the likes of Terrakion, Krookodile, and Mega Sharpedo, though the former two often require some chip damage to KO. It is also Nihilego's best source of damage against Mega Blastoise, Suicune, and Ground-types like Mamoswine and Hippowdon. Thunderbolt damages bulky Water-types like Alomomola, Empoleon, and Tentacruel more than any of Nihilego's other attacks while letting it revenge kill offensive Starmie after some chip damage. It also adequately damages offensive Steel-types like Lucario and Bisharp, 2HKOing both after minor chip damage. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam allows Nihilego to KO Hydreigon in one hit while dealing heavy damage to wallbreakers like Heracross and Latias, being able to reliably 2HKO the latter after Stealth Rock damage. Toxic Spikes can be used to allow Nihilego to set an entry hazard as an opposing Pokemon that walls it switches in, punishing the opposing team with poison damage. It can also try bluffing a hazard setting set, though this is often a situational and risky strategy, and the moves themselves cost coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Choice Scarf allows Nihilego to function as a revenge killer, capable of removing fast threats like Mega Aerodactyl, +1 Mega Altaria, and Mega Beedrill. Beast Boost increases Nihilego's threat level by boosting its Special Attack every time it KOes a foe.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set should be used to revenge kill various tier sweepers, such as +1 Mega Altaria, Celebi, and Togekiss, after they've sustained some residual damage. It also revenge kills faster threats like Mega Aerodactyl, Mega Manectric, and Zeraora after some prior damage. Since Nihilego often can't directly switch into most of the Pokemon it revenge kills, it will have to come into play as its targeted sweeper is setting up, after a teammate has fainted, or through the support of a pivot, though the first strategy is by far the riskiest. Nihilego can, however, come in on several special attackers that can't hit it super effectively, such as Gengar, Mega Manectric, Moltres, and Rotom-H, as well as passive attackers like Alomomola and Sylveon. Due to Choice Scarf locking Nihilego into one attack, it is important to predict properly so as not to provide the opponent free turns. Nailing Ground-types on the switch with Grass Knot and hitting bulky Water-types with Thunderbolt are examples of how to accomplish this. Nihilego must also look out for Pursuit from Pokemon like Krookodile and Pokemon that can take advantage of it to set up, like Latias and Cobalion. Nabbing these foes with a super effective attack on the switch or, in Cobalion's case, doubling out of play or switching out as it begins to set up is the best way for Nihilego to minimize any potential harm done to its team. Nihilego should be wary of priority moves from Pokemon like Bisharp, Scizor, Lucario, and Crawdaunt, as its poor Defense will cause it to sustain major damage from their attacks, which will complicate its role.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set is a comfortable fit on offensive teams in need of a fast revenge killer. Setup sweepers and cleaners, like Swords Dance Scizor and Mega Sharpedo, appreciate Nihilego's ability to revenge kill opposing sweepers for them to more easily do their job late-game. Pokemon with poor or shaky special bulk, like Doublade and Mega Slowbro, also value Nihilego as a teammate thanks to its ability to blanket check many of the tier's special attackers. Pokemon in need of Fairy-type checks as teammates, like Hydreigon and Mega Altaria, often welcome Nihilego's ability to offensively threaten most of them. Pokemon weak to Flying-types, like Infernape and Celebi, and most Fighting-types, enjoy Nihilego as a teammate as well. Entry hazard setters such as Cobalion, Krookodile, and Klefki are helpful teammates for Nihilego, allowing it to more easily power through foes thanks to the additional chip damage. Nihilego also appreciates Steel-type checks like Moltres, Volcanion, and Infernape for their ability to weaken some of this set's sturdier switch-ins, like Cobalion and Mega Aggron. Ground-immune Pokemon can also be important due to Nihilego's weakness to Pokemon like Gligar and Nidoking, making Hydreigon, Latias, and Togekiss worthwhile teammates. Powerful wallbreakers like Terrakion and Primarina can weaken foes for Nihilego and help circumvent its occasional power problems. Pivots reliably bring Nihilego into play if its opportunities to switch in are limited, making Hydreigon, Gligar, and Mega Manectric good options for partners. Pursuit trappers like Bisharp and Scizor can weaken or remove a few troublesome Pokemon for Nihilego to match up against at times, such as Latias.</p>"
      },
      "Stall Utility": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Nihilego is a fantastic user of Stealth Rock, which further justifies its usefulness on stall teams by providing a lot of utility and role compression. Protect allows Nihilego to scout for opposing moves such as Choice-locked moves from Pokemon like Hydreigon and Pursuit from Scizor and Krookodile to act accordingly, which is vital because it lacks the Defense to survive being trapped more than once. Protect also provides Nihilego with a way to gain an extra turn of recovery from Black Sludge to help improve its longevity. Pain Split is an option to provide Nihilego with a more efficient way to recover lost health than from the passive recovery of Black Sludge that is also a useful tool to punish common switch-ins like Empoleon, Mega Steelix, and Mega Aggron, which lack reliable recovery. Pain Split also drastically improves Nihilego's matchup against opposing stall teams, as it can recover a lot of health against foes like Blissey and Alomomola and cripple them in the process. Power Gem allows Nihilego to hit stallbreakers such as Kyurem, Chandelure, and Gengar to potentially remove or severely weaken them. Power Gem also does a decent amount of damage to Scizor, which would otherwise look to switch in freely, on the switch. Thunderbolt can be used over Power Gem to give Nihilego the coverage to punish bulky Water-types like Empoleon and Tentacruel more than Power Gem would, as they are common entry hazard removers that may look to remove Nihilego's hazards or punish it with their Water-type STAB moves. Thunderbolt also hits almost every Steel-type such as Cobalion, Klefki, and Doublade harder than Power Gem can, preventing them from freely pivoting in on Nihilego. Toxic Spikes is an option over Stealth Rock to cripple and slowly chip away at foes; however, Nihilego should primarily be used as a Stealth Rock user, as it provides a lot of role compression in addition to Toxic Spikes being an inconsistent form of entry hazards due to being absorbed by Poison-types. Therefore, Toxic Spikes should only be used on stall teams that greatly appreciate the utility Nihilego can provide and already feature a dedicated Stealth Rock user.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Black Sludge is vital for Nihilego to have a passive form of recovery to increase its longevity. It works exceptionally well in conjunction with Protect to scout for moves such as Pursuit while providing it with a free turn to recover some lost health.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Nihilego should be used to give stall teams a switch-in to Flying-type stallbreakers like Togekiss by virtue of its typing, as well as absorbing Toxic Spikes, which can be a huge nuisance for stall teams. Nihilego's good natural Special Defense allows it to pivot into special threats like Gengar, Mega Houndoom, and Chandelure, which Blissey, the usual dedicated special wall on stall teams, struggles to check. Nihilego should capitalize on its ability to pivot into these threats for a free opportunity to set up Stealth Rock; however, it should only aim to do so against unboosted targets, as it doesn't appreciate taking a strong hit, especially if they are common Z-Move users. Nihilego should take advantage of its Speed tier to force out stallbreakers that most stall teams have issues pressuring effectively outside of status, such as Kyurem, Celebi, and Mega Altaria, with its STAB combination. Protect should be used to scout what common Choice item users like Scizor and Krookodile lock themselves into to switch safely or attack them. This is important due to them both being very common Pursuit users, which are a huge detriment to Nihilego's ability to stay healthy enough to check the threats it needs to. Protect can also be used liberally to gain a free turn of Black Sludge recovery to be healthy enough to handle Pokemon like Gengar and Togekiss; however, Nihilego should be careful not to provide Pokemon like Terrakion and Scizor too many free turns to set up in doing so. If utilizing Pain Split, Nihilego can be played more aggressively when it comes to switching into the threats it can handle, as it can recover off most of its lost health at a later point. Nihilego must avoid losing its Black Sludge via Knock Off, as this is detrimental to its recovery, even if it has Pain Split. Nihilego must fear strong physical attackers like Infernape, Bisharp, and Krookodile, as they can punish Nihilego due to its pitiful Defense rendering it unable to take a hit reliably, and the latter two are also common Knock Off users. Nihilego should also not stay in on common priority users like Scizor and the aforementioned Bisharp, which can easily revenge kill it.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This Nihilego set should primarily be used on stall teams by virtue of its combination of defensive and offensive utility against common stallbreakers while being able to offer role compression with Stealth Rock. Blissey is the usual staple on stall teams and works fantastically in tandem with Nihilego, as it is able to cure Nihilego of any status ailments with Heal Bell and provide Wish support. Blissey can also handle Psychic-types like Latias and check offensive Water-types like Volcanion and Primarina, which Nihilego cannot pivot into nor reliably revenge kill without sufficient chip damage on them. In return, Nihilego provides Blissey with an answer to special threats like Gengar and Chandelure. Alomomola is another great partner due to its ability to check premier physical threats like Scizor and Mega Aerodactyl for Nihilego thanks to its ability Regenerator while also being able to heal Nihilego with Wish support. Nihilego can give a lot of Pokemon opportunities to set up by using Protect to scout or regain health, so Unaware users like Quagsire and Pyukumuku make fantastic partners to better switch into setup Pokemon like Bisharp, Terrakion, and Cobalion. In return, Nihilego is able to switch into and absorb Toxic Spikes for them, which helps prevent their susceptibility of being worn down by status. Mega Altaria is a fantastic partner, as it can provide entry hazard removal in the form of Defog and Heal Bell support to cure Nihilego of status conditions and act as a strong Knock Off sponge to prevent Nihilego from getting crippled and easily worn down. Mega Altaria also switches into many of the tier's Fighting-types like Infernape and Heracross, as well as potentially luring in and KOing Scizor with Flamethrower for Nihilego. Gligar works exceptionally well with Nihilego, as it can check Fighting- and Steel-types like Terrakion, Cobalion, and Mega Aggron, which Nihilego is unable to punish effectively without Thunderbolt. Gligar is also able to remove hazards for Nihilego and is immune to Toxic Spikes, which takes pressure off Nihilego risking switching in to absorb them. Steel-types like defensive Scizor, Doublade, and Mega Aggron that have issues handling threats like Moltres and Chandelure appreciate Nihilego's ability to check and remove them. In return, these Steel-types can handle Pokemon like Latias, Mew, and Mega Aerodactyl that threaten Nihilego, and Doublade can also Pursuit trap said threats.</p>"

  "Necrozma": {
    "overview": "<p>Necrozma's unique traits as both a Stealth Rock setter and wallbreaker allow it to fit well on bulky offensive teams. Its high offensive stats, decent bulk, and access to Stealth Rock make it a good offensive entry hazard setter. Necrozma's ability, Prism Armor, lets it mitigate some of the damage from super effective attacks, contributing to Necrozma's overall longevity throughout the match. Prism Armor also lowers damage from Pursuit, allowing Necrozma to switch more freely. Necrozma's strong STAB move in Photon Geyser hits most neutral targets hard, and with coverage moves such as Heat Wave, Signal Beam, and Ground-type options, it can punish the Dark-, Psychic-, and Steel- types that are immune to or resist its STAB move. However, Necrozma's Psychic typing is not beneficial for it, as it lacks a secondary STAB attack while also being weak to many common Pokemon like Hydreigon, Gengar, and Scizor. Necrozma also has a very mediocre Speed stat, which prevents it from flourishing in the metagame, as it is unable to outspeed maximally invested base 80s and above, such as Mega Altaria, Togekiss, and Mamoswine.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Psyshock is an option over Photon Geyser that allows Necrozma to 2HKO Blissey, though it brings worse breaking power overall. A physical Swords Dance set using Groundium Z and Earthquake can effectively beat a lot of standard Necrozma answers, such as Blissey, Alolan Muk, and many Steel-types. However, this set is easily revenge killed and prone to being crippled by status. A defensively oriented Stored Power set consisting of Moonlight / Calm Mind / Stored Power / Rock Polish can be used as well, but this variant of Necrozma is completely walled by Dark-types and extremely susceptible to Toxic. A set featuring Rock Polish along with a Weakness Policy can be used for Necrozma to instantly gain fast and powerful wallbreaking capabilities, but it tends to be unreliable, as it is overly dependent on getting hit by a super effective move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types, such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, and Bisharp, are immune to Photon Geyser and take significantly less damage from Necrozma's coverage moves; however, all of them fear various coverage moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attackers</strong>: Strong attackers such as Hydreigon, Flyinium Z Moltres, and Dragonium Z Latias can OHKO Necrozma and prevent it from getting up Stealth Rock. Most wallbreakers can beat Necrozma because of its average Speed.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls like Blissey and Empoleon take little damage from Necrozma's attacks and are able to threaten it in return with Toxic, though Empoleon has no reliable recovery and takes a chunk from Earth Power and Earthquake. Mandibuzz, while rare, is also able to cripple Necrozma with Knock Off while taking minimal damage from its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Pokemon that outspeed Necrozma like Gengar, Mega Beedrill, and Terrakion can KO it. Faster Taunt users like Azelf, Krookodile, and Froslass can prevent Necrozma from doing its job effectively.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Stealth Rock allows Necrozma to function as an effective offensive entry hazard setter with a comfortable balance of longevity and offensive presence. Photon Geyser is a consistent and powerful Psychic-type attack that has no drawbacks. Heat Wave allows Necrozma to hit Steel-types such as Scizor, Magneton, and Klefki that resist Photon Geyser. Signal Beam can be run to threaten Dark-types such as Mega Sharpedo and Hydreigon, although is often quite weak. Earth Power and Earthquake can be used to 2HKO Empoleon and Alolan Muk, respectively, though both moves provide worse coverage than Signal Beam otherwise.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment along with a Modest nature lets Necrozma hit as hard as possible. With the given Speed EVs, Necrozma is able to outspeed maximum Speed Scizor with an Adamant nature. Prism Armor is Necrozma's only ability and reduces damage taken from super effective attacks. Metronome allows Necrozma to more easily power through many entry hazard removers, such as Florges and Mega Altaria, while also preventing Latias from repeatedly using Roost against Signal Beam. However, Metronome will somewhat limit Necrozma's longevity. Iapapa Berry restores 50% of Necrozma's HP in a pinch, helping it stay alive longer and perform its duties more consistently. Life Orb can be run to increase Necrozma's power, but it wears Necrozma down significantly and also prevents it from coming onto the field as often.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Necrozma should get Stealth Rock up as soon as possible to punish the many switches that it is able to force due to its threatening movepool. If using Metronome, Necrozma should be used to spam Photon Geyser to force entry hazard removers out of play before setting up Stealth Rock and put pressure on them to prevent them from using Defog. When using Iapapa Berry, be conscious of when Necrozma is low on HP to prevent it from being knocked out before its Berry activates. Carefully using residual damage from weather, status, and entry hazards to your advantage can help Necrozma activate its Berry in a controlled manner if it cannot reliably stay in on a foe's attack. Photon Geyser is powerful and should be used most of the time; however, keep in mind that it has relatively low PP. Status conditions, particularly Toxic poison, can cripple Necrozma and put it on a timer.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Necrozma should be used as a Stealth Rock setter on offensive teams that appreciate its strong offensive presence. Wallbreakers that threaten Dark- and Steel-types, such as Infernape, Scizor, and Terrakion, appreciate the Stealth Rock support that Necrozma offers, since it allows them to secure some KOs they would miss out on without the chip damage. Pokemon that work well on bulky offense teams with Necrozma, such as pivots like Scizor and tanks like Mega Aggron, can be effective partners as well. Necrozma also appreciates cleric support from Pokemon like Togekiss and Sylveon. Other Pokemon that threaten Dark-types, such as Mega Altaria and Primarina, also synergize well with Necrozma.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Photon Geyser is a powerful and reliable STAB attack. Earth Power allows Necrozma to chunk Steel-types that resist Photon Geyser and lets it hit Alolan Muk super effectively. Heat Wave is a good coverage move for Steel-types that take Earth Power neutrally, particularly Scizor, and it also hits Celebi. Signal Beam allows Necrozma to damage Dark- and Psychic-types, such as Hydreigon, Mega Sharpedo, Krookodile, Celebi, and Latias. Power Gem can be run to hit Pokemon like Moltres and Mandibuzz for more damage, though the former already takes a fair amount from Photon Geyser while the latter isn't particularly common. Dark Pulse is an alternative option for the fourth moveslot that lets Necrozma hit Ghost-types like Chandelure and Gengar and Psychic-types like Celebi and Latias without having to choose between Signal Beam, Heat Wave, and Earth Power.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Prism Armor is Necrozma's ability and helps it survive longer by sponging some of the damage from super effective attacks, including Pursuit. Choice Specs boosts Necrozma's Special Attack immensely, allowing it to hit hard with its STAB attack and good coverage. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and a Modest Nature allow Necrozma to hit as hard and fast as possible. A bulkier EV spread of 68 HP / 252 SpA / 188 Spe with a Modest nature can be used for additional longevity.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Necrozma can be used as an early-game wallbreaker with its powerful no-drawback STAB attack in Photon Geyser, as it is able to break down teams that lack a sturdy Psychic-resistant or Psychic-immune Pokemon. Necrozma should be used with good prediction, as being able to use the proper coverage moves against common switch-ins to Photon Geyser, such as Scizor, Latias, Hydreigon, and Alolan Muk, can turn the tide of a game in your favor. Necrozma often can be a good lead due to its sheer power, the unpredictability of its set, and its ability to downplay Pursuit trapping thanks to Prism Armor. Necrozma needs to be cautious of Photon Geyser's low PP, as Pokemon with Pressure, such as Suicune, Moltres, and Kyurem, can deplete it quite quickly.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Pokemon that set up entry hazards, such as Gligar and Cobalion, are able to chip foes on the switch and ease Necrozma's wallbreaking. Necrozma enjoys Spikes to help chip down Pokemon like Swampert and Sylveon into OHKO and 2HKO range, respectively, so Spikes setters such as Klefki can be effective teammates. Fairy- and Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Mega Altaria, Primarina, Infernape, Terrakion, and Cobalion, are able to check Dark-types that generally threaten Necrozma. Dark- and Ghost-type teammates like Alolan Muk, Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Gengar can remove opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types for Necrozma, which it appreciates greatly. The former two can Pursuit trap many of those Pokemon as well. Necrozma also appreciates offensive pivots, such as Scizor, Infernape, and Mega Manectric, which allow Necrozma to get in safely and hit a foe hard.</p>"

      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Photon Geyser busts through common defensive threats such as Amoonguss and ignores abilities like Unaware on Quagsire. Furthermore, when the move is powered up with Psychium Z Necrozma can defeat more specially defensive foes like Diancie and Hippowdon. Heat Wave and Signal Beam form good coverage in conjunction with Photon Geyser, hitting important Steel-types such as Scizor and Mega Aggron and Psychic- and Dark-types like Latias and Krookodile. Psyshock and Moonlight can be used over Photon Geyser and Signal Beam in order to let Necrozma serve as a more reliable sweeper late-game and beat foes such as Blissey and Suicune that shrug off Photon Geyser, but the drop in power, the fact that other Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Latias directly outclass this set, and the limiting of Necrozma's coverage can prove troublesome. Earth Power is also a viable option, hitting the likes of Empoleon and Alolan Muk for good damage, but this comes at the high cost of being unable to hit Scizor super effectively.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Psychium Z turns Photon Geyser into Shattered Psyche, which breaks through walls such as Rhyperior and Sylveon when boosted with little to no chip damage needed. Wiki Berry is an alternative if your team's Z-Crystal slot is already taken, giving Necrozma a semi-reliable form of recovery. One should note the vulnerability to Knock Off when running this item, however. Prism Armor grants Necrozma the ability to take hits from Dark- and Ghost-types attempting to revenge kill it, like Gengar, Hydreigon, and Krookodile, a lot better than it otherwise would. 188 Speed EVs allow Necrozma to outspeed neutral-natured base 70 Speed Pokemon, like Bisharp and Volcanion, and Jolly Bewear.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Necrozma's average bulk means it should set up on forced switches from Psychic-weak targets like Nidoking and weaker attackers such as Gligar. If Necrozma has Psychium Z, the item's use should be entirely dependent on the nature of the opposing team. Offensive teams more than likely won't let Necrozma set up freely, if at all, so using the Z-Move for damage on forced switches is entirely acceptable, whereas bulkier teams will more than likely let Necrozma use Calm Mind at some point, making saving the Z-Move until boosted the optimal play in most cases. One should consider opposing Dark-types potentially coming in on the Z-Move, though. Additionally, when facing bulkier teams, Necrozma can be used as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker or a late-game cleaner, with the choice being up to the player. Prism Armor's reduction of damage from super effective moves means Necrozma can stay in at higher ranges of health and punish common attackers such as Krookodile and non-Ghostium Z Gengar. The former is especially notable, as Krookodile will often try to Pursuit trap Necrozma, making staying in a good play in some scenarios. Attempt to weaken bulkier Psychic-resistant Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Slowbro with the appropriate coverage move or pressure from teammates before setting up with Necrozma. Photon Geyser's lacking PP means liberal usage can hamper any attempts to wallbreak or sweep with Necrozma, so great care has to be taken with it, especially against Pokemon with Pressure, such as Suicune, or specially defensive foes like Blissey. Take advantage of Necrozma's good power when unboosted and bulk when boosted by hitting predicted switch-ins with the appropriate coverage move and using weaker revenge killers like Choice Scarf Hydreigon as further setup fodder. Finally, this set's lack of reliable recovery means Toxic can cripple Necrozma severely, so avoid it unless you absolutely have to leave Necrozma in.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Florges, and Klefki make for excellent partners, as they take on troublesome Dark-types, and in return, Necrozma serves as a reliable lure to Scizor. Klefki in particular fits well, as Necrozma benefits heavily from the entry hazards while being capable of pressuring most Defoggers and spinners. Sylveon and Florges can also provide Wish and Heal Bell support to keep Necrozma healthy throughout the match. Fighting-types like Terrakion and Infernape help pressure Steel-types that can take Heat Wave, such as Empoleon and Bronzong, as well as punish Dark-types looking to switch into Necrozma. VoltTurn support from pivots such as Mega Manectric and Mega Beedrill can help bring Necrozma in safely on weaker defensive threats that offer free setup opportunities. Entry hazard setters are important to get the opposing team in range of boosted attacks, so the likes of Cobalion and Empoleon are always good teammates. Pursuit users such as Mega Aerodactyl, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and Assault Vest Bisharp are great options to deal with a weakened Blissey, which, if at full HP, can shrug off any attack Necrozma uses, as well as Calm Mind Latias, which can freely switch in on Necrozma and beat it one-on-one. Teammates such as Mega Altaria and Taunt Hydreigon that can deal with Calm Mind users other than Latias, such as Suicune and Reuniclus, can fit well with Necrozma. Necrozma can also break common defensive threats like Mega Aggron and Alomomola, so teammates that can take advantage of these threats being removed, such as Scizor and Mega Sharpedo, make for very good partners.</p>"

  "Stakataka": {
    "overview": "<p>Stakataka possesses a unique niche in the UU tier, as its respectable Attack stat in conjunction with one of the lowest Speed stats in the game gives it a monstrously strong Gyro Ball. In addition, Stakataka's ability to accrue boosts upon KOing opposing Pokemon through Beast Boost combined with its access to Trick Room can make it a devastating late-game sweeper under the right conditions. A Steel typing and massive 61 / 211 / 101 bulk make Stakataka a decent choice for offensive teams that struggle with common threats such as Latias and Crobat. However, Stakataka's secondary Rock typing hinders its defensive utility by leaving it vulnerable to common bulky Water-types like Swampert and Suicune and compounding its weakness to Ground- and Fighting-type moves, making Stakataka extremely vulnerable to common Pokemon in UU like Krookodile, Cobalion, and Hippowdon as well as leaving it extremely vulnerable to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave from Infernape and Lucario, hindering its capacity to clean up under Trick Room. Stakataka is also extremely one-dimensional, as its movepool is quite limited outside of Trick Room and its STAB moves. Thus, the same pool of Pokemon that can check Stakataka will always be reliable stops to it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stakataka can use a Choice Band with Toxic, Superpower, or Sleep Talk in place of Trick Room to utilize its immediate power. Toxic can catch usual switch-ins such as Swampert off guard, while Sleep Talk allows Stakataka to reliably absorb Spore from Amoonguss. However, this set will make Stakataka even more one-dimensional, as it loses its sweeping capability and becomes easier to check when locked into a move with its extremely low Speed. Stakataka can also run a Chople or Shuca Berry to attempt to tank hits from offensive Fighting- and Ground-types like Nidoking and Heracross and do massive damage in return. However, this will make Stakataka significantly weaker compared to running a Life Orb or Rockium Z.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Stakataka sports an unfortunate 4x weakness to Ground. Thus, Ground-types such as Nidoking and Mamoswine are able to easily KO it. Bulky Ground-types like Swampert and Hippowdon are able to effectively wall any Stakataka. Krookodile can OHKO Stakataka with Earthquake and lower its Attack using Intimidate.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: In a similar fashion to common Ground-types, many Water-types in UU pose a threat to Stakataka. Offensive Water-types like Primarina and Starmie can crush Stakataka with high-powered STAB moves, while bulky Water-types like Suicune and Alomomola can shrug off its attacks and threaten it with Scald burns. Crawdaunt is also capable of picking off a weakened Stakataka with a strong Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Since Stakataka is also 4x weak to Fighting-type moves, users of such moves also pose a massive threat to Stakataka. Heracross, Cobalion, Infernape, and Terrakion all are capable of easily OHKOing Stakataka with their STAB moves. Pokemon with strong Fighting-type priority moves like Vacuum Wave Lucario and Mach Punch or Vacuum Wave Infernape will also be able to pick off a Stakataka even under Trick Room. In addition, Chesnaught has access to the ability Bulletproof, which grants it an immunity to Gyro Ball, Stakataka's primary source of damage output.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Steel-types</strong>: Steel-type Pokemon with high Defense like Mega Steelix, Cobalion, Doublade, and Mega Aggron all match up decently against Stakataka. While Stakataka commonly carries Earthquake to deal noticeable damage to all of the above, they often are still able to comfortably tank even a boosted Earthquake if kept healthy and put a stop to a Stakataka attempting to sweep.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Trick Room": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Trick Room allows Stakataka to clean up teams late-game, since it will likely be attacking first due to its abysmal Speed. Gyro Ball is Stakataka's primary STAB move, hitting extremely hard due to its high Attack and ridiculously low Speed stats. Stone Edge is Stakataka's secondary STAB move, allowing it to break past Pokemon that resist Gyro Ball like Scizor and Volcanion. Lastly, Earthquake is the preferred coverage move for this set, as it allows Stakataka to meaningfully damage threats like Cobalion, Doublade, and Magneton.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum Attack investment with a boosting nature ensures that Stakataka will hit as hard as possible. Maximum HP investment will allow Stakataka to take as many hits as possible while setting up. Rockium Z turns Stakataka's Stone Edge into a 180-Base Power Continental Crush that can break past Scizor, Amoonguss, and other bulky Pokemon it would be incapable of OHKOing. Since Stakataka's Defense stat is absurdly high, a Lonely nature with 15 Defense IVs is necessary to allow Beast Boost to boost its Attack upon scoring a KO. Furthermore, Stakataka uses 0 Speed IVs to push the damage output of its Gyro Ball higher. In the case of another teammate needing to use a Z-Crystal, Life Orb can be used instead of Rockium Z to increase Stakataka's overall damage output.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Avoid switching Stakataka in until its checks or counters are weakened as much as possible, as taking unnecessary chip damage will hinder its ability to tank common priority moves such as Scizor's Bullet Punch and Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet when attempting to sweep. Stakataka should aim to set up on Pokemon that cannot damage it significantly such as Crobat and Latias, though its massive bulk will usually allow it to set up Trick Room on most neutral hits should the situation require it. Keep in mind that Continental Crush's targets, such as Scizor and Alomomola, are often not safely OHKOed by it and must take a sizeable amount of chip damage before they can be taken out. In addition, bulky Ground-types like Swampert and Hippowdon will stop Stakataka in its tracks and must be removed before it can sweep. Likewise, Fighting-types with priority like Infernape and Lucario must be removed to prevent them from revenge killing Stakataka with a fair amount of prior chip damage.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stakataka requires that bulky Water- and Ground-types be severely weakened or removed. Thus, strong Grass-types like Tsareena and Celebi are often effective at breaking down threats like Hippowdon, and Suicune. Pokemon like Mamoswine and Mega Manectric can also heavily pressure Stakataka's standard checks and counters. Decent switch-ins to Ground- and Fighting-type moves are also necessary for Stakataka to fall back on should the situation arise. Pokemon like Latias and Crobat will all make decent partners for it. As the premier Spikes setter in the tier, Klefki makes for a good partner for Stakataka, as the residual damage will help Stakataka net more clean KOs. In addition, Klefki can be used as a check to Dragon-types like Latias and Hydreigon, which allows Stakataka to remain healthy until the late-game when it can set up and sweep. To assist in a sweep, Pokemon that can create setup opportunities for Stakataka are also valuable partners for it. Memento Chandelure and viable users of Light Screen or Reflect such as Klefki can be used to weaken incoming damage for Stakataka.</p>"
      },
      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Gyro Ball is Stakataka's most powerful STAB move that hits hard even when uninvested, allowing it to reliably check Psychic-types such as Latias and Azelf and Dragon-types such as Hydreigon. Rock Blast grants Stakataka a secondary STAB move that gives it an easier time against Substitute users like Chandelure. Stone Edge is an alternative to Rock Blast that gives Stakataka a STAB move with more consistent power, but its lower accuracy and fewer PP make it inferior to Rock Blast. Stealth Rock allows Stakataka to punish opposing switches and rack up chip damage. Protect allows Stakataka to scout for Choice item users such as Terrakion and Scizor. It also helps Stakataka gain more HP from its passive recovery and thus stay healthy. Toxic, alternatively, allows Stakataka to cripple common switch-ins like Hippowdon and Swampert.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Special Defense in tandem with a Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs allows Stakataka to better take on special attackers such as Latias and Mega Pidgeot and maximize Gyro Ball's Base Power. Beast Boost is Stakataka's only ability, allowing it to gain a boost in Defense for each Pokemon it KOes, letting it potentially check a wider range of Pokemon. Leftovers grants Stakataka with passive recovery, allowing it to stay healthy more easily.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>Switch Stakataka into special attackers that don't have super effective STAB moves, such as Latias, Moltres, and Togekiss, and prioritize setting up Stealth Rock against them to punish opposing switch-ins as much as possible. However, in Togekiss's case, it is advised to scout for super effective coverage. Scout with Protect against potential Choice-locked Pokemon such as Hydreigon, Terrakion, and Scizor, but take into account that some of them can punish Stakataka's attempts at scouting by setting up. It is also advised to scout for super effective coverage on Pokemon like Latias and Necrozma, whose STAB moves are resisted by Stakataka, and act accordingly. Hence, unless your team has countermeasures to setup sweepers that have the potential to actually be Choice-locked attackers, Stakataka should not use Protect on them. Gyro Ball is Stakataka's strongest STAB option and is meant to hit faster threats such as Latias and Nihilego. However, because of its low PP, it should be preserved, and Stakataka should use Rock Blast more often, especially if you predict a Steel-resistant Pokemon to switch in. Furthermore, if possible, attempt to double switch if predicting a Steel-resistant Pokemon to switch in. If using Toxic, attempt to cripple opposing switch-ins to Stakataka, such as Swampert and Alomomola.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Stakataka fits best on defensive and balance teams because its unique defensive typing and immense bulk allow it to check threats to them, including Mega Pidgeot and Latias. Stakataka's typing and bulk allow it to take on Flying-types such as Mega Pidgeot and Moltres, so Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tsareena make for good partners. They can also take on Ground-types such as Swampert and Rhyperior that Stakataka struggles against, while Stakataka can take on Dragon- and Flying-types such as Latias and Mega Pidgeot for them. Because Stakataka has no reliable recovery, Wish passers like Alomomola make for good partners because they help Stakataka remain healthy. Fairy-types like Mega Altaria and Sylveon take on Fighting-types such as Infernape and Mienshao that threaten Stakataka out. Likewise, Doublade makes for a good partner because it can take on other Fighting-types such as Terrakion, Cobalion, and Lucario that can break past Fairy-types. Flying-types such as Moltres and Crobat can help Stakataka out by switching into both Fighting- and Ground-type attacks and checking Fighting-types such as Heracross and Infernape. Unaware users such as Quagsire and Pyukumuku can beat certain setup sweepers like Scizor and Terrakion that can potentially set up on Stakataka. Hazard removers such as Tentacruel and Moltres can remove entry hazards that wear down Stakataka, which allows it to switch into certain threats more easily. They can also take on certain Fighting-types, including Lucario and Cobalion, for Stakataka.</p>"

  },
  "Zeraora": {
    "overview": "<p>Zeraora is a potent offensive threat in UU by virtue of its decent mixed offenses, outstanding Speed, and access to a powerful physical Electric-type move in Plasma Fists. Thanks to its aforementioned Speed, it can outrun and threaten some of the tier's fastest threats, including Mega Manectric, Latias, Gengar, and Starmie. Its vast coverage movepool allows it to hit several conventional Electric-type checks like Hydreigon and Hippowdon with moves like Close Combat and Grass Knot, making it a solid mixed wallbreaker. It can also attempt to sweep with Bulk Up thanks to its ability to power through several bulkier threats with either Gigavolt Havoc or Breakneck Blitz, as well as its Speed allowing it to limit the number of Pokemon capable of revenge killing it. Unfortunately, Zeraora's pitiful defenses and weak typing limit its opportunities to come into play on its own and prevent it from reliably checking Pokemon that other Electric-types can often handle well, such as Scizor and Togekiss. Its lack of immediate power causes it to rely on Life Orb for damage output on some sets, damaging its longevity in the process. This also makes Zeraora more prediction reliant in order to adequately punish its switch-ins. Zeraora struggles to fit all of its desired coverage moves on its setup sets, meaning that they will always fail to hit at least one key target hard. Because of these downsides, Zeraora faces competition from other Electric-types like Rotom-H and Mega Manectric, which can more reliably fulfill their roles due to being less hard pressed to fit coverage on their sets and having better defensive utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Punch hits Scizor 4x effectively, but it has few uses outside of this and thus ends up costing Zeraora more valuable coverage most of the time. Iron Tail is also an option for hitting Mega Altaria, Sylveon, and Florges hard, though this also ends up denying Zeraora access to more useful coverage moves. Drain Punch is an option on the Bulk Up set for restoring Zeraora's health, but Zeraora often requires the power Close Combat will provide. Zeraora can pull off a Calm Mind set due to its solid special movepool, though it often struggles breaking past as much of the metagame or its conventional checks with such a set compared to Bulk Up. Choice Band is an option for allowing Zeraora to function as an adequate physical wallbreaker. However, Zeraora's other sets are easier to put to consistent use, and it also dislikes locking itself into most of its attacks.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Several Ground-type Pokemon have various ways of punishing Zeraora. Nidoking and Krookodile can tank any hit and OHKO Zeraora with super effective STAB attacks, though their lack of recovery or bulk investment doesn't make them particularly consistent answers. Gligar, Hippowdon, Mega Steelix, and Nidoqueen are all fairly solid checks, even taking super effective or strong neutral hits due to their great defenses and punishing Zeraora with Ground-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Due to Zeraora's occasionally middling power, physically bulky Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Doublade are capable of tanking a hit and punishing it with powerful attacks or status in return. Mega Altaria, Amoonguss, and Chesnaught are all particularly troublesome, as only offensive variants of the former fear the KO from a boosted Breakneck Blitz while the latter two don't take significant damage from any common coverage move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Despite Zeraora's high Speed, it is still outrun by the likes of Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill, which can prey on its poor bulk to force it out. Choice Scarf users like Infernape, Krookodile, Hydreigon, and Latias can also do a good job offensively threatening Zeraora.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority</strong>: Zeraora's poor typing and defenses leave it susceptible to several common forms of priority. While Bisharp's boosted Sucker Punch is the only priority move capable of OHKOing it from full, it can still take heavy damage from Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet, Infernape and Lucario's boosted Vacuum Wave, and even Scizor's Swords Dance-boosted Bullet Punch.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Close Combat is essential in covering a few Pokemon capable of coming in on Plasma Fists, such as Hydreigon, Krookodile, Mamoswine, and Mega Steelix. Grass Knot hits the majority of Ground-types not already hit hard by Close Combat, such as Hippowdon, Swampert, and Seismitoad, for respectable damage. Knock Off hits Latias, which otherwise walls Zeraora, for a 2HKO on the switch while also removing the items of switch-ins like Gligar, Amoonguss, and Nidoqueen. Volt Switch is an option over Knock Off for its ability to pivot Zeraora out of play. It is important, however, to note that it will come at the cost of being able to punish Gligar and Amoonguss and hitting Latias hard. Hidden Power Ice is an option for hitting Ground-types like Gligar, Nidoqueen, and Nidoking harder than Zeraora's other attacks. However, Knock Off can still annoy these foes while allowing Zeraora to do much more meaningful damage to Psychic-types like Latias and Celebi. Work Up is an option for allowing Zeraora to increase its offensive presence to become a more threatening sweeper. However, it is often difficult to find room for due to sacrificing coverage.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Life Orb provides Zeraora's attacks with a necessary boost in power, allowing it to achieve feats such as 2HKOing Mega Steelix with Close Combat after one layer of Spikes and 2HKOing Hippowdon with Grass Knot. Expert Belt lets Zeraora hit super effective targets almost as hard as Life Orb without cutting into its HP. However, it will be unable to damage targets hit by its moves neutrally, such as Infernape and Scizor, nearly as reliably. Shuca Berry is also an option for allowing Zeraora to tank one Ground-type hit from a foe like Mega Aerodactyl or Choice Scarf Krookodile and retaliate with powerful attacks. Volt Absorb is Zeraora's only available ability, though it can allow Zeraora to come in on predicted Electric-type attacks from Rotom-C, Mega Manectric, and Rotom-H to restore health. A Naive nature is preferred for preventing Zeraora from taking too heavy of damage from Bullet Punch as it tries revenge killing Scizor, though a Hasty nature is also an option if the rest of the team adequately accounts for Scizor.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's main function is as a fast mixed wallbreaker capable of punching holes in opposing teams early- or mid-game. However, if Zeraora is still healthy at the end of the match and Plasma Fists switch-ins are weakened or removed, it can attempt cleaning up thanks to its high Speed. Due to its poor bulk and typing, Zeraora should almost never switch into foes directly, instead coming into play with support from a pivot or after a teammate has fainted. Prediction is vital in reliably securing various KOs for Zeraora. For instance, if a Ground-type like Hippowdon or Swampert is likely to switch in on an expected Plasma Fists, Zeraora should try nailing them with Grass Knot as they come in, sufficiently weakening them. Due to its Speed, Zeraora can be used to revenge kill weakened sweepers like Cobalion, Mega Houndoom, and Latias. However, it should be wary of revenge killing setup sweepers that often carry priority, such as Scizor, Bisharp, Infernape, and Lucario, as after a boost these threats will likely be able to wear Zeraora down immensely or pick it off if it's weakened enough. If Volt Switch is being used, Zeraora should use the attack on predicted switches into foes it can't reliably break through, like Mega Altaria and Amoonguss, in order to chip them while generating momentum. While Zeraora's typing can allow it to tank a hit or two from foes like Togekiss, Scizor, and Crobat, it should never be used primarily as a check to these Pokemon due to its poor longevity. This is further compounded by the Life Orb recoil it may sustain, making it often only an offensive answer. If Shuca Berry is being run, Zeraora should use it to either tank a hit from a faster foe like Mega Aerodactyl or Krookodile while retaliating with super effective hits or inflict damage on a slower Ground-type like Hippowdon or Mega Steelix while stomaching an Earthquake.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>Due to Zeraora's high Speed, good offenses, and lack of defensive qualities it can provide, it fits best on offensively inclined teams. Entry hazard setters like Nihilego, Cobalion, and Mamoswine can help Zeraora secure a few vital KOs with extra chip damage, such as the OHKO on Chandelure with Knock Off after Stealth Rock and, if Zeraora is running Shuca Berry, the guaranteed 2HKO on Krookodile with Grass Knot. Klefki can be particularly helpful, more reliably chipping Ground-types with Spikes damage while slowing Choice Scarf users down with Prankster Thunder Wave. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon like Hydreigon, Mega Blastoise, and Tsareena can also be useful to Zeraora in order to minimize its chances of taking unnecessary residual damage. Zeraora also appreciates support from pivots like Hydreigon, Scizor, and Moltres that can reliably bring it into play. If running Volt Switch, Zeraora can also form VoltTurn cores with the aforementioned examples. Sturdy Dragon-type checks like Primarina and Doublade can also be helpful to circumvent a few Pokemon Zeraora can at times struggle breaking past, like Mega Altaria and Latias. Secondary checks to Pokemon like Scizor and Togekiss, like Cobalion and Mega Aerodactyl, respectively, can help alleviate the longevity issues Zeraora may run into trying to check these threats on its own. Setup sweepers such as Celebi, Bisharp, and Infernape appreciate Zeraora's ability to punch holes in opposing teams for them to more easily sweep late-game. Pokemon that appreciate various Water- and Flying-types getting weakened, such as Scizor, Krookodile, and Terrakion, also enjoy the support Zeraora can provide. If it's running Volt Switch, Zeraora can greatly aid frailer teammates like Gengar and Crawdaunt by more easily bringing them into play. With Grass Knot, it can also support Pokemon that appreciate the weakening of Ground-types, such as Mega Beedrill and Mega Aerodactyl, by luring in and damaging the likes of Hippowdon and Swampert.</p>"
      },
      "Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<h4>Moves</h4> <p>Bulk Up turns Zeraora into a formidable sweeper, boosting its Attack enough for it to OHKO Infernape with Plasma Fists and its Defense enough for it to survive Earthquake from Gligar. Close Combat is important for covering various foes that could otherwise easily stomach a boosted Plasma Fists, such as Hydreigon, Cobalion, and Stakataka, while also hitting some Ground-types like Mamoswine and Krookodile super effectively. Knock Off hits foes like Latias, Doublade, and Celebi super effectively while removing items from typical switch-ins such as Gligar and defensive Rotom-H. Giga Impact in tandem with Normalium Z delivers a powerful blow to several otherwise safe answers to Zeraora, such as Mega Altaria, Hippowdon, and Latias, after a boost. It also hits a lot of Knock Off targets, such as Gligar and Celebi, for respectable damage. Grass Knot is an option on this set for reliably dealing super effective damage to most Ground-types, though it gives up valuable coverage and can be an undesirable option on a physically based set. Bounce is also an option alongside Flyinium Z to lure in and KO Grass-type checks like Chesnaught and Amoonguss. However, the move costs coverage and is quite situational, and the aforementioned targets are already hit decently hard by Breakneck Blitz.</p> <h4>Set Details</h4> <p>Electrium Z grants access to Gigavolt Havoc, which when boosted allows Zeraora to more easily muscle past several foes, including Mega Aggron, Mega Slowbro, and Diancie. Shuca Berry is also an option for more easily taking on various Ground-type foes, like Krookodile and Hippowdon, if another teammate is using a Z-Move. Normalium Z gives Zeraora the ability to utilize Breakneck Blitz to severely dent several conventional checks, like Amoonguss and Nidoking, after a boost. While Volt Absorb is the only ability available to Zeraora, it can be useful in switching into a predicted Electric-type attack from Mega Manectric or Rotom-H to restore health, although this strategy is often quite risky. If Zeraora happens to be running Grass Knot, a Naive nature is preferred so as not to decrease its Special Attack.</p> <h4>Usage Tips</h4> <p>This set's function is as a sweeper capable of cleaning up late-game once its checks have been removed or weakened. However, with Normalium Z, it can also double as a lure to several of Zeraora's otherwise solid checks, like Mega Altaria, Amoonguss, and several Ground-types. Due to its frailty, Zeraora should only come in after a teammate has fainted or with support from a pivoting teammate. It should be brought in on foes it can force out, such as Primarina and Starmie, in order to find opportunities to set up. Zeraora can also attempt setup against foes like Rotom-H and Latias after they have used moves like Overheat and Draco Meteor, respectively. While on paper it could switch in on opposing Electric-types or resisted attacks to set up, its susceptibility to coverage and chip damage often makes this an unreliable strategy. Electrium Z should be activated to deal heavy damage to bulky Pokemon that would otherwise tank a hit or two from Zeraora and possibly cripple it, like Mega Aggron and Mega Slowbro. If Normalium Z is being used, it should be activated after a boost to dent targets that would otherwise take minimal damage from even boosted hits, like Amoonguss, Celebi, Gligar, and Mega Altaria. Conserving Zeraora's HP in order to allow it to reliably sweep is important, meaning it should rarely be brought out before setting up unless it is needed to revenge kill an opposing Pokemon.</p> <h4>Team Options</h4> <p>This set fits well on offensive teams thanks to its ability to sweep late-game. Entry hazard support from teammates like Chesnaught, Mega Aggron, and Nidoking can be useful for allowing Zeraora to more easily sweep, notably allowing it to OHKO offensive Mega Altaria sets with +1 Breakneck Blitz after minimal chip damage. Pivots are also helpful to Zeraora for reliably bringing it into play, making the likes of U-turn Hydreigon and Infernape good options for teammates. Sturdy Ground-type answers like Tsareena and Celebi are important for removing or chipping them into range of a boosted Breakneck Blitz. Wallbreakers like Gengar, Kyurem, and Volcanion can all break past several of the physically bulky Pokemon Zeraora would have trouble dealing with on its own, like Gligar, Hippowdon, and Mega Steelix. Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Nihilego could also be useful teammates to Zeraora due to the presence of a few faster Pokemon capable of pressuring it, such as Mega Aerodactyl and Mega Beedrill.</p>"
