  "Charizard": {
    "overview": "<p>In the RU tier, Charizard is usually considered to be outclassed by a plethora of other powerful Fire-types, most notably Moltres by virtue of their shared secondary typing. However, Charizard has a few tricks up its sleeve that can make it worth using over its Fire-type brethren. First of all, it has a rather expansive movepool by RU standards, with a wide selection physical and special attacks as well as several boosting moves, the most notable of which is Swords Dance. This last move, when combined with Acrobatics, allows it to function as a physical setup sweeper, which is a role that none of its competitors can fill efficiently. Second, it has usable stats with which to take advantage of said movepool, including a fairly high Special Attack stat and a 100 base Speed stat, which allows it to Speed tie with Timid Typhlosion and Entei, the fastest Fire-types in RU. Third, its hidden ability, Solar Power, raises its Special Attack to unparalleled heights under the sun, making special sets very difficult to wall. That said, it's clear that Charizard has to capitalize on these singular traits if it doesn't want to be outclassed in RU, but even then, unfortunately, it requires a lot of team support to alleviate its shortcomings. In fact, its easily exploitable weaknesses and the prominence of faster threats make it prone to being revenge killed; moreover, Charizard has a terrible 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, which makes Rapid Spin support absolutely necessary.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Every specially attacking set not employing Solar Power would be completely outclassed by Moltres, which has better bulk and higher Special Attack. The sheer wallbreaking power of a Choice Specs set in the sun may look appealing, but generally Moltres outclasses Charizard when it comes to Choiced sets, as the former is less reliant on team support to function and has access to Hurricane and U-turn. It must be noted, though, that Choice Specs Charizard has an insane amount of power, and can actually 2HKO a fully invested Slowking with a sun- and Solar Power-boosted Fire Blast. Physical boosting sets with Belly Drum or Dragon Dance are either too frail or too weak to perform adequately, and these boosting moves are illegal with Acrobatics, arguably its best physical move.</p> <p>Notable other moves in Charizard's arsenal are Dragon Pulse and Will-O-Wisp. The former has perfect neutral coverage in RU alongside Fire Blast, but the threats that you need to cover are hit harder by SolarBeam, while the latter sees better use on a Pokemon that actually has the bulk to play a supporting role.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to check all of Charizard's sets is to keep Stealth Rock on the field, as it saps half of its health every time it switches in. Also, Choice Scarf users and priority users (barring Mach Punch users), will, in most cases, put an end to its sweep. Given that Charizard lacks a reliable way to boost its Speed, basically every Pokemon in RU with more than 100 base Speed, barring Scyther and Cryogonal, can outspeed and OHKO it. Aerodactyl needs special attention, because it can also switch into Charizard in neutral weather.</p> <p>Druddigon stands out from the crowd as one of the best and most viable answers to the Solar Power set; it can easily come in while Charizard sets up sun, without fear of its unboosted attacks, and force it to switch out with the threat of a powerful Dragon-type STAB move. It must be noted, though, that Druddigon can be easily worn down during the match and that it must be at almost full health to successfully counter Charizard, seeing that a sun-boosted Fire Blast will put a huge dent in it. The specially defensive variant takes hits a little better and can employ a RestTalk strategy to remain sufficiently healthy to stop it, all while threatening to cripple Charizard with Glare or to phaze it away with Dragon Tail. Flareon and Altaria, even though they are NU, can wall this set, especially if it lacks Air Slash. More defensive teams can deal with the Solar Power set by stalling out sun turns, using either smart switching or Protect. Even after a boost, the Swords Dance set is walled by Quagsire, thanks to Unaware, and Regirock, thanks to its massive physical bulk. The latter doesn't have reliable recovery, but can easily tank a hit and retaliate with a super effective Rock-type STAB move. Furthermore, if Charizard is not running Flare Blitz, Steelix cannot be 2HKOed, and Eelektross and defensive versions of Rotom can take a hit and OHKO back.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Despite its low base Attack stat, Charizard can pull off an effective Swords Dance set. Charizard is threatening enough to force switches and this grants it plenty of opportunities to grab a boost; once it is at +2, the Pokemon that would wall special sets, such as Slowking and Druddigon, are easily OHKOed by a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. Earthquake is Charizard's best move alongside Acrobatics, as it hits most of the Pokemon that resist Flying for a hefty amount of damage, leaving just a few threats uncovered. A Fire-type STAB move in the fourth slot rounds out the coverage and hits Steelix, Ferroseed, and Rotom harder; Fire Punch is slashed before Flare Blitz due to the absence of recoil. Roost is a viable alternative if you don't feel the need for the added coverage; in this case, though, its ability, Blaze, goes from being situational to being almost completely useless.</p> <p>The nature can be changed from Jolly to Naive if you opt for Fire Blast in the fourth slot. Despite this being a physical set, this move is still its safest option to take out Steelix, Ferroseed and Tangrowth, as it can be done even without boosts and without consuming its vital Flying Gem.</p> <p>Rapid Spin users, the best being Kabutops and Cryogonal, are obvious choices as teammates. Charizard also has decent synergy with them, seeing that it can take on Grass-types for Kabutops and Fighting-types for Cryogonal. Choice Scarf users and priority users must be eliminated beforehand for Charizard to have a chance to actually sweep. On more defensive teams, you may need a partner to deal with Charizard's weaknesses; Ground-types, especially Torterra and Seismitoad, who are also neutral and immune to Water-type attacks, respectively, can cover Rock- and Electric-type attacks, and in particular deter the opponent from spamming fast Volt Switches against Charizard. Defensive variants of Torterra and Cryogonal, when paired together, can counter most of the revenge killers that threaten Charizard, while at the same time offering the invaluable Rapid Spin support.</p> <p>Rock-types are natural counters to this set, as they can switch into most of its attacks and proceed to threaten it with their STAB moves. As a result, Water-types are also excellent partners; Slowking and Seismitoad are the only two that are not only capable of switching into their attacks and pressuring them, but also continue to offer good offensive and defensive synergy with Charizard. More specifically, Aqua Jet users, such as Feraligatr, Kabutops, and Samurott, are immediately threatening to Rhydon and Regirock (especially Samurott with its mixed set), but they can't switch more than once into powerful Rock-type attacks, making them shakier checks to Aerodactyl and Archeops. In addition, these Pokemon greatly appreciate Charizard's ability to wear down certain physical walls, such as Alomomola and Tangrowth. Lastly, Pokemon that benefit from the elimination of Pokemon that resist Fire-type attacks, such as Entei, are also good partners.</p> "

        "name": "Solar Power",
        "description": "<p>This set revolves around setting up sun and capitalizing on the subsequent Special Attack boost, granted by Solar Power, to turn Charizard into a fearsome wallbreaker. When sun is up, in fact, its Fire Blast OHKOes literally everything bar the bulkiest Pokemon that resist it, with just a bit of entry hazard support. SolarBeam is its best choice for the third slot in order to beat Water-types, as it easily 2HKOes defensive variants of Slowking and Lanturn. Actually, given the insane damage output of a sun-boosted Fire Blast, SolarBeam is the only coverage move you will need in most situations. This is also the reason why Charizard can forgo a damaging move in the fourth slot, thus favoring Roost over Air Slash. Roost gives it the ability to heal off Solar Power damage, especially against Pokemon with a below-average offensive presence, possibly allowing Charizard to set up sun more than once during the match. On the other hand, Air Slash certainly is a good coverage option for those situations in which Charizard can't set up sun (without this move, in neutral weather this basically is a mono-attacking set); however, when the sun is up, Fire Blast is almost always the best choice, as there's nothing significant that Air Slash accomplishes and Fire Blast doesn't.</p> <p>The EV spread is the classic for special sweepers, and dropping Speed EVs for bulk doesn't accomplish anything worthy of note. A Timid nature is the only one you should choose, in order to make the best use of Charizard's solid Speed. As far as items go, Leftovers enhances Charizard's durability, but Flame Plate gives a little boost to its most important move, which is greatly needed the achieve some crucial OHKOs, especially on Fire-types, such as Entei and Emboar, and against bulky Pokemon like Clefable and Uxie. Life Orb is an option to secure the OHKOs on Lanturn and Slowking (the latter only after Stealth Rock), while generally increasing the damage output of its other moves, but it severely limits Charizard's staying power; equipping Charizard with a Grass Gem, on the other hand, makes it even more efficient in eliminating bulky Water-types, but with the obvious downside of having a one-use item which doesn't boost its most powerful move. An interesting support move for the fourth slot is Tailwind, which can be useful when Charizard just needs a Speed boost to clean a weakened team, and gives Charizard another decent way to support its teammates.</p> <p>This Charizard set obviously needs Rapid Spin support, which can be provided by Kabutops or Cryogonal, and benefits from having teammates that deal with its weaknesses; Ground-types are a good fit for this role. In addition, Chlorophyll users are valuable partners on more offensively oriented teams, as they resist the Water- and Electric-type moves that trouble Charizard and become fast revenge killers in the sun, using the remaining turns for a late-game sweep; Heat Rock can be the item of choice in this case. Lilligant and Sawsbuck are ideal because of their ability to function even outside of sun, unlike other sun sweepers such as Shiftry and Victreebel.</p> "

  "Butterfree": {
    "overview": "<p>Butterfree has never been a premier choice for competitive battlers, as her poor stats, hideous typing, Stealth Rock weakness, and shallow movepool have prevented her from being a decent Pokemon. However, she has become noticeably better throughout the generations: in ADV, she received Compound Eyes which remedied Sleep Powder and Stun Spore's accuracy problems, and DPP introduced the Focus Sash and Choice Scarf, which gave her more opportunities to use her status moves. But while Butterfree has had a niche in the last two generations as the only Pokemon with a 97.5% accurate Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, she has never really been able to shine in the spotlight of any tier. Now, BW has once again given her some useful tools which have finally given her the chance to shine. First of all, Butterfree has gained Quiver Dance, and with it, she finally has a way to sweep the opposition. Additionally, the Dream World has given Butterfree the Tinted Lens ability, which allows her to circumvent her lack of coverage and sweep with Bug Buzz. To top it all off, Venomoth is banned from RU, so Butterfree is the sole Bug-type that has access to both Quiver Dance and Sleep Powder. While Butterfree is still a poor Pokemon in many ways, and she faces stiff competition from the likes of Quiver Dancing Bug-types and Lilligant, she occupies a few niches in RU as either a reliable status spreader or a lethal Quiver Dance sweeper, and she can be very successful at those niches with a little support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Unfortunately, Butterfree is fairly one-dimensional, as her movepool is pitifully shallow. Butterfree has access to alternative special attacks such as Shadow Ball, Psychic, Hidden Power Flying, and Energy Ball, but these moves cannot sufficiently damage most of the Pokemon who can wall her. She also is capable of utilizing support options such as Rain Dance, Sunny Day, and Tailwind. However, due to her poor stats, she is unable to use these options as well as a Pokemon such as Uxie, though she does have a very reliable Sleep Powder to compensate. If you wish to increase Butterfree's longevity, Roost is a viable option, though Butterfree is so frail that it usually isn't worth sacrificing a moveslot for it. You can also try using Butterfree in the lead position with a Focus Sash, but because of Team Preview, Butterfree is significantly more prone to Taunt.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As threatening as Butterfree can be, Butterfree has a few crippling flaws. Even though she might not seem like it when she manages to tear through your team, she is still a delicate butterfly that is frail, slow, and weak without a boost. Additionally, she is severely crippled by Stealth Rock, so keeping it on the field is the first step you should take towards countering her. With Stealth Rock up, she loses the ability to switch into weaker attacks, and her trainer is immediately pressured into making the right move as at 50% HP, Butterfree dies to anything aside from a Caterpie's Tackle. Thus, keeping Stealth Rock up is the necessary step to take to make it less likely that Butterfree will manage a sweep.</p> <p>Even with Stealth Rock up, Butterfree can still manage to pull her weight as she still has the threat of Sleep Powder to keep you on your toes. The best way to deal with this is to pack a Sleep Talk user on your team, such as Emboar, Hariyama, or Escavalier. However, make sure that you also have a phazer, as Sleep Talk can be unreliable, and this can sometimes allow Butterfree to set up on the Pokemon with Sleep Talk. If you do not have a Sleep Talker, Butterfree becomes more of an issue. Usually, it is fairly safe to sacrifice a bulky Pokemon or one which isn't very useful against the opponent to Butterfree's sleep. Unfortunately, this is still easily thwarted by good prediction, so sometimes, it is necessary to run two counters to Butterfree: one to sacrifice to sleep, and one to actually beat her. Fortunately, Butterfree is fairly weak and RU has a collection of great special walls that aren't afraid to wall her, including Altaria, Clefable, Escavalier, Cryogonal, Ferroseed, Gallade, Hitmonchan, Mandibuzz, and Steelix. Most teams often have at least one of these Pokemon as they are fairly useful overall.</p> <p>While Butterfree can be bothersome for offensive teams, she is still very manageable. Though it is significantly less likely for offensive teams to have something that walls Butterfree, they can easily prevent her from getting in a Quiver Dance. Even after a Quiver Dance, Butterfree is outsped by common Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Rotom and Primeape, in addition to Accelgor and Aerodactyl. Furthermore, she is vulnerable to priority, so Pokemon such as Entei, Hitmonlee and Hariyama can check her. However, offensive teams are weak to Sleep Powder, and once Choice Scarf Pokemon and priority have been removed, she finds it easier to sweep due to most offensive teams' lack of bulk.</p> ",

        "name": "Quiver Dance",
        "description": "<p>With access to the picture-perfect combination of Sleep Powder, Quiver Dance, and Tinted Lens, Butterfree is perfectly capable of sweeping the opposing team. Butterfree is the only Bug-type in RU who receives the combination of Sleep Powder and Quiver Dance, and her access to Sleep Powder makes her arguably the best Bug-type Quiver Dancer in RU. While Butterfree does face some heavy competition in Lilligant, Butterfree's abilities set her apart, as Tinted Lens allows Butterfree to rely solely on Bug Buzz for coverage, freeing up room for Substitute, while Compound Eyes nearly guarantees that her Sleep Powder will hit the foe. Additionally, Butterfree is able to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the RU metagame after one Quiver Dance, bar Accelgor, Ninjask, and Electrode, making her difficult to revenge kill after a single boost. With little support, Quiver Dance Butterfree is very capable of freely slicing her way through the opposing team like a hot knife through butter.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is key to this set, as Butterfree's main way to set up on an opponent is to put them to sleep. It is usually a safe option to simply throw out first when Butterfree is sent out, as BW's sleep mechanics basically guarantee that a sleeping Pokemon is effectively knocked out. However, while Sleep Powder is a key weapon in Butterfree's arsenal, note that once Butterfree has put a Pokemon to sleep, she will be unable to do so again until said Pokemon has woken up or fainted, due to Sleep Clause. As such, sometimes it is better to simply set up a Substitute instead (assuming Butterfree is facing a slower opponent), and hope the opponent switches from the threat of Sleep Powder. This allows Butterfree to save her Sleep Powder from being wasted on a Pokemon that would serve as sleep fodder, and she can then react appropriately. If the opponent merely switched in a Pokemon whom she cannot beat, such as Haze Cryogonal, Butterfree should simply use Bug Buzz to deal a little damage, then switch out. However, against other opponents, Butterfree will have a huge advantage if she has a Substitute up, as she has a variety of options at that point. This can vary from putting a dangerous Pokemon to sleep with Sleep Powder, Quiver Dancing to set up on a Pokemon who Butterfree can deal with easily, or just using Bug Buzz to deal some damage. Even if the opponent stayed in and attacked, Butterfree will only lose 25% of her health thanks to Substitute. Choosing between using Sleep Powder or using Substitute is an important choice, as it will determine how effective Butterfree will be for the rest of the match.</p> <p>Quiver Dance is Butterfree's necessary boosting move, and Butterfree will quickly become difficult to deal with once she has accrued a few boosts. As Bug Buzz is a relatively decent STAB move to fall back upon, especially with Tinted Lens backing it up, Butterfree can become a considerable threat to the opponent after a single Quiver Dance. Do note however, that Butterfree's Special Attack stat is rather mediocre, so multiple Quiver Dances may be needed to sweep. Pokemon such as Moltres can wall Butterfree, so you can opt to use a coverage move such as Hidden Power Rock instead of Substitute, though keep in mind that this makes Butterfree significantly more vulnerable to priority and revenge killers.</p> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment is necessary to make Butterfree as potent as possible. With the given EVs, Butterfree reaches a Speed stat of 393 after a Quiver Dance, which outspeeds everything under base 130 Speed Pokemon with maximum investment. With Butterfree's mediocre base 80 Special Attack stat, Butterfree needs to pump all her remaining EVs into Special Attack to make her Bug Buzz strong enough to actually hurt opposing Pokemon. Leftovers are the recommended item as they work well alongside Substitute and give Butterfree much needed longevity, but Life Orb gives her a significant increase in power. If you use Life Orb, though, you should use an alternative attacking option in the last slot, such as Hidden Power Ground, Psychic, Shadow Ball, or Hidden Power Flying. Tinted Lens is the preferred ability on this set as it alleviates Butterfree's issues with coverage, but Compound Eyes ensures that Sleep Powder won't miss at crucial moments.</p> <p>Though Butterfree is a very capable sweeper, she has a few faults which are heavily restricting should they not be dealt with. First and foremost, Butterfree despises Stealth Rock, as it further cripples Butterfree's already poor longevity, and guarantees that Butterfree will not be able to take any hits at all. Thus, a Rapid Spinner is necessary to remove Stealth Rock so Butterfree can perform at her full potential. Kabutops and Cryogonal are good choices for this role, as they both resist some of Butterfree's weaknesses and are very bulky on either the physical or special side, respectively. Additionally, they are physical attackers, which allows them to deal with some specially defensive Pokemon who can be irksome for Butterfree to deal with, such as Cryogonal. On the flip side, Butterfree appreciates entry hazards as her Special Attack is rather average, and entry hazards guarantee some important 2HKOs and OHKOs. Spikes can be set up by the likes of Qwilfish, Ferroseed, Roselia, or Crustle, while Stealth Rock can be set up by a slew of Pokemon, including Probopass, Omastar, Sandslash, Uxie, and Steelix. Butterfree is also very frail, so moves such as Volt Switch, Baton Pass, and U-turn are useful to get her safely into the match.</p> <p>The other and more troublesome issue are specially defensive Pokemon who can phaze Butterfree or KO her before she can even attempt to 2HKO them. Unfortunately, RU holds many specially defensive Pokemon who are more than happy to sponge Butterfree's attacks, such as Clefable, Cryogonal, Escavalier, Ferroseed, Gallade, Hitmonchan, Moltres, and Steelix. Though Butterfree can partially circumvent these counters via Sleep Powder, the opponent may carry more than one of these Pokemon on their team, as some of them have good synergy together. While these Pokemon are varied, for the most part, strong physical attackers are able to muscle their way through these Pokemon, paving the way for Butterfree's sweep. Aggron, Rhydon, Hitmonlee, and Crawdaunt are all capable physical attackers who can rip huge holes in these specially defensive walls. Wynaut and Magneton can also trap certain troublesome Pokemon to assist Butterfree's sweep. You can try to lure out some of these walls with another Pokemon that they commonly counter, before KOing them with a surprise move. Additionally, some offensive Pokemon can still take a hit from Butterfree after a Quiver Dance, such as Bouffalant, Drapion, and a multitude of others, so be sure to weaken the opposing team sufficiently before attempting a sweep.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Butterfree's unique access to Compound Eyes, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore allow her to be a very reliable status spreader. The accuracy boost that Compound Eyes provides buffs the accuracy of both Sleep Powder and Stun Spore to 97.5%, which means that Butterfree is almost guaranteed to have her status move hit when given the chance. Unfortunately, Butterfree is usually both frail and relatively slow, so she is often unable to do so easily. With a Choice Scarf equipped, however, Butterfree outspeeds the entire unboosted RU metagame bar Accelgor, Ninjask, and Electrode; this gives her more chances to use her status moves, though it does have the drawback of locking Butterfree into a single move.</p> <p>As always, Sleep Powder is the key move on this set, and as sleep is more deadly than ever in BW, Butterfree can incapacitate a foe for the rest of the match when played correctly. Unfortunately, Sleep Powder has always been Butterfree's staple move, so many opponents will simply switch in their least useful Pokemon, or a Sleep Talker, to take the Sleep Powder. In an attempt to deal with this, U-turn is useful to scout for any such Pokemon. U-turn will also keep the momentum of the match in your favor if the opponent switches, which is useful on offensive teams. Stun Spore is an alternative status to spread over opposing teams to cripple fast sweepers permanently, and few Pokemon are immune to it, unlike Thunder Wave. Toxic is another option to cripple walls, but Stun Spore is generally more useful. Bug Buzz gives Butterfree a fairly strong STAB option that allows her to serve as a revenge killer in some scenarios. For example, Bug Buzz OHKOes Sceptile after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOes Galvantula and other frail Pokemon.</p> <p>252 Speed and Special Attack EVs are used as Butterfree needs all the Speed she can get, and she appreciates a stronger Bug Buzz with which to revenge kill opponents. Alternatively, you can shift those 252 Special Attack EVs into HP so Butterfree can take a light hit or two. In this case, it is recommended that Bug Buzz is replaced with an alternative option such as Roost or Toxic, as without investment, Bug Buzz is pitifully weak. While Compound Eyes is typically the better ability because it makes Butterfree more reliable, Tinted Lens can allow Butterfree to revenge kill a wider variety of opponents. Do note however that Butterfree's main niche lies in her 97.5% accurate Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, so forgoing this would be a waste.</p> <p>Rapid Spin users are necessary teammates for this set, as Butterfree will be switching numerous times during the match, and she cannot afford to lose 50% of her health each time. While Butterfree can normally take a light hit or two, with Stealth Rock up Butterfree cannot take a hit at all. For Rapid Spin duties, Kabutops, Cryogonal, and Hitmonchan are the best candidates to use alongside Butterfree, as they resist some of Butterfree's bothersome weaknesses and can strike physically to deal with some troublesome special walls that don't care about Stun Spore, such as Slowking and Clefable. Furthermore, Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee have the added advantage of being able to guarantee a Rapid Spin with Foresight, while Sandslash can set up Stealth Rock to punish opposing Pokemon for switching out.</p> <p>The best teammates for this set are Pokemon that appreciate a free turn of set-up. With the threat of sleep, Butterfree can simply U-turn as the opponent switches to create a free switch in for one of her teammates, or she can just put a Pokemon to sleep to allow her teammates to set up. Of note are Pokemon such as Swellow, Hariyama, and Ursaring, who can utilize that single free switch in to activate their status orbs and be an immediate threat to the opponent. Alternatively, slow Pokemon such as Aggron, Crawdaunt, and Rhydon can be useful to deal massive amounts of damage to opposing walls, and Butterfree can allow them to sweep by sufficiently paralyzing enough of the opposing team. The key to this Butterfree set is to use a plethora of offensive Pokemon to keep constant pressure on the opponent, and use Butterfree's ability to gain momentum and cripple threats to keep that offensive pressure.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Clefable, who was one of the most versatile Pokemon in DPP UU, makes a comeback, this time in RU. Clefable possesses respectable special bulk, along with reliable healing and an amazing ability in Magic Guard. it also has great support moves in its arsenal, such as Wish, Heal Bell, and Stealth Rock. All these traits make its a great special wall, Wish passer, cleric, and hazard setter. Magic Guard gives its immunity to any form of passive damage, which greatly hinders any other wall's effectiveness. To top it all off, Clefable has a very wide attacking movepool, allowing its to surprise many checks and counters. it can pack quite a punch, as Magic Guard gives its the ability to use Life Orb and moves such as Double-Edge without any recoil. Finally, when holding a Toxic Orb, Clefable can act as a great status absorber and also use a very powerful Facade.</p> <p>However as with everything, Clefable has its flaws. The lack of useful resistances--Normal-types only have one immunity, to Ghost-type moves--hurts its, as it often finds it difficult to wall very strong special attacks. Another drawback is its somewhat low physical bulk and weakness to Fighting-type moves, which makes its very vulnerable to strong physical attackers, Fighting-type Pokemon in particular. All in all, Clefable is a great Pokemon who will provide valuable team support throughout the match if you use its correctly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clefable has a very wide movepool full of interesting options. it can run a Belly Drum + Soft-Boiled set with two attacks, most likely Double-Edge and either Drain Punch or Fire Punch, but most of the time, it will be forced out by faster Pokemon that can OHKO its after it uses Belly Drum. A defensive set with Flame Orb and Trick can be utilized to cripple physical attackers eager to switch into Clefable, while making its a good status absorber. Finally, Clefable receives many other support moves such as Gravity, Knock Off, Light Screen, Cosmic Power, and Sing, as well as the attacking options Body Slam, Focus Blast, Psychic, and Charge Beam, but these moves are usually inferior to the main options. Gravity is generally a gimmick move, Knock Off, Light Screen, Body Slam, Psychic, and Focus Blast are situational, and Sing is inaccurate. Cosmic Power could be used in a set with Charge Beam and Soft-Boiled to boost both Clefable's defenses and Special Attack, making it unkillable after a few boosts without strong physical Fighting-type attacks, but takes too much time to set-up and gets forced out easily.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Any strong physical attacker will force Clefable out. For example, Hitmonlee, Gallade, and Hitmonchan can all take hits from its all day long and either set up or outright KO its. However, they must watch out for Thunder Wave, Toxic, or Life Orb Double-Edge. Most Ghost-types, especially bulky ones such as Dusknoir, are also good checks, as they are immune to Clefable's primary attacks and can set up on its. Qwilfish fares well against every set bar Calm Mind variants, but must avoid Thunderbolt. Finally, Ferroseed is a good check that can set up on any Clefable lacking a Fire-type move except the Calm Mind set.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Boasting very nice HP and Special Defense stats, Clefable is capable of walling many strong special attackers in RU, such as Manectric, Rotom-C, and Galvantula. Magic Guard further enhances its walling capabilities, allowing its to avoid damage from entry hazards or damaging status, which trouble many other walls. With a good HP stat, it can pass big 197 HP Wishes, healing many offensive Pokemon almost completely, and most defensive Pokemon for at least half of their HP. Protect is used to scout Choice-locked moves from the likes of Entei, Sceptile, and Manectric, gives Clefable one free turn of Leftovers healing, and most importantly, makes sure that it can reliably heal with Wish. If you prefer having instant recovery and want to avoid giving free turns to your opponent, Soft-Boiled is always an option. Seismic Toss is the attacking move of choice due to its consistent power and Clefable's sub-par offensive stats. Lastly, a support move of your choice can be chosen. Heal Bell makes Clefable a reliable cleric, allowing its to heal its teammates of any troublesome status, Stealth Rock helps any team, and Encore is great for preventing sweepers from setting up against Clefable.</p> <p>The EVs are put into HP and Special Defense to maximize Clefable's special bulk. Leftovers is the best item, as it works very well with Protect and gives its constant passive healing. Magic Guard is by far the best ability, for the reasons mentioned above. If you need a status absorber, Toxic Orb is a viable item on Clefable, as it gives Clefable immunity to status. If you choose to run Toxic Orb, you should consider changing Seismic Toss to Facade, which is more powerful against almost all targets hit neutrally, even with Clefable's low Attack stat. Toxic and Thunder Wave are both viable alternatives for the fourth slot to make opposing Pokemon think twice about switching in. You can also run a special attack of your choice in the last slot to cover more threats, since Clefable has a decent Special Attack stat. The most useful of these moves are Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Grass Knot, Ice Beam, and Shadow Ball. Something important to note is that with one of these moves, except Grass Knot, Clefable is no longer completely helpless against offensive Ghost-types with Substitute, such as Rotom and Haunter. Finally, if you decide to use a special move, you might consider using Double-Edge over Seismic Toss, as it offers better coverage alongside said special move.</p> <p>Clefable loves teammates that can take physical hits for its, especially Fighting-type moves. For this reason, Qwilfish, Rotom, Dusknoir, and Spiritomb are very good partners; every one of these Pokemon appreciates the Wish support, since all of them lack reliable recovery. A Dark- or Steel-type Pokemon will also be very useful to take care of Ghost-types, such as Spiritomb and Golurk, who can set up on Clefable. Mandibuzz and Steelix are good choices, as they are immune or resistant to Ghost-type moves and can phaze away their boosts.</p> "

        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<p>This set can catch the opponent off guard with its underrated power. With Magic Guard, Clefable can abuse a recoil-free Double-Edge and use Life Orb while still maintaining a great deal of bulk. Double-Edge is the main attraction of this set, 2HKOing many Pokemon in RU. To illustrate, almost all Pokemon that do not resist Double-Edge are OHKOed or 2HKOed. Grass Knot covers most Rock-types, such as Omastar and Kabutops, and even some heavy Steel-types, particularly Steelix and Aggron, while Flamethrower OHKOes or 2HKOes most Steel-types, namely Steelix, Ferroseed, and Klinklang. Stealth Rock should be chosen if you don't have any other Pokemon to set it up, and Wish can be used for extra healing support. In the last slot, Soft-Boiled pairs well with Stealth Rock to give Clefable instant recovery, while Protect matches well with Wish, allowing Clefable to heal reliably.</p> <p>The EVs and the nature maximize Clefable's Attack, which reaches respectable levels when backed by Life Orb in spite of its base 70 Attack. Combined with the high Base Power of Double-Edge, this makes sure that almost nothing is safe from Clefable. The rest of the EVs are then put into HP to maximize its bulk and Wish passing capabilities. A Brave nature is chosen so that neither Clefable's bulk nor its power is compromised. Magic Guard is chosen as usual to enhance its offensive and defensive potential, granting its immunity to both entry hazards and Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>In the last slot, Encore can be used to prevent opponents from setting up on Clefable; Heal Bell can be used if your team needs a cleric. Fire Blast is a viable choice in the second slot for the added power, but Flamethrower is preferred due to its greater PP and reliability. Toxic and Thunder Wave are both good options in the last slot to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Rotom, Dusknoir, and Spiritomb. Another option is to run Toxic Orb and Facade instead of Life Orb and Double-Edge. This gives Clefable pseudo-status immunity, but it loses quite a bit of power.</p> <p>Teammates that can switch into Pokemon that resist Clefable's attacks are useful. Good examples are Qwilfish and Moltres, who can switch into Dusknoir and Spiritomb, respectively. Teammates that can set up Spikes are also appreciated as this set's surprise factor, meaning its ability to hit very hard many of the support set's switch-ins, can cause many switches; Spikes also help Clefable gain some OHKOs and 2HKOs, such as on Gallade, Tangrowth, Lilligant, and Entei with Stealth Rock, and Hitmonchan without it. Qwilfish is the best option, as it has good synergy with Clefable and benefits from Wish greatly, having no reliable healing of its own. Lastly, Clefable can often lure in and eliminate certain walls so one of your Pokemon can sweep. Clefable that pack Grass Knot can lure out and KO Omastar and Kabutops, facilitating a sweep for Entei, while Klinklang appreciates Flamethrower-wielding Clefable's ability to remove Steelix and Ferroseed.</p> "

        "name": "Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<p>With surprisingly good power and coverage, this set can surprise anyone who thinks that Clefable is a harmless wall. Double-Edge is its nuke, OHKOing and 2HKOing many Pokemon. Additionally, Life Orb and Double-Edge recoil are canceled out by Magic Guard, which gives Clefable a distinct advantage over other wallbreakers. Grass Knot provides coverage against Rock-types that resist Double-Edge, Fire Blast roasts Steel-types, and Soft-Boiled gives Clefable a way to heal and continue to batter your opponent with powerful attacks.</p> <p>The EVs go into Attack and Special Attack to maximize Clefable's power output, while a Brave nature is chosen to improve the power of Double-Edge without jeopardizing Clefable's bulk. Shadow Ball can be used with a Quiet nature if you want Clefable to have a chance of 2HKOing Dusknoir, Uxie, and Qwilfish with the help of entry hazards. Thunderbolt can be used along with a Quiet nature; it maintains coverage against Archeops and Aerodactyl, OHKOes any Feraligatr after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes, and OHKOes Qwilfish unconditionally. A Toxic Orb can be used to prevent Clefable from getting burned, and generally lets its act as a status absorber. If you choose Toxic Orb, you should be sure to pick Facade instead of Double-Edge to hit harder. It should be noted, however, that without Life Orb, Clefable's special attacks are much weaker.</p> <p>As with most wallbreakers, entry hazards are very useful, as they help Clefable score many OHKOs and 2HKOs. Stealth Rock in particular helps Clefable's Double-Edge to OHKO many offensive Pokemon, such as Moltres and Scyther. Sandslash and Uxie are excellent partners for this reason, as they can set up Stealth Rock and take the Fighting-type attacks aimed at Clefable. Most bulky Ghost-types, particularly Dusknoir, trouble this set, as they can take anything but Shadow Ball and set up on Clefable. For this reason, teammates that can deal with bulky Ghost-types, such as Pursuit users and Moltres, are very useful.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This set makes Clefable a formidable bulky sweeper that both hits hard and is difficult to take down thanks to Soft-Boiled and Magic Guard. Calm Mind is the most important move on this set, raising its Special Attack and Special Defense to high levels. Thunderbolt and Ice Beam take the second and third slots because of the almost-unresisted coverage they provide together in RU. The only Pokemon that resist this combination in RU are Magneton and Lanturn, both of which are setup fodder. Finally, Soft-Boiled goes in the last slot to make Clefable nearly impossible to bring down from the special side after a few boosts, prolonging its sweep.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Clefable's Special Attack and HP to provide maximum bulk and firepower, because this set wants to hit hard while at the same time being difficult to take down from the special side. Magic Guard is chosen mainly to prevent Clefable from being stalled out with Toxic; after a couple of boosts, Clefable only fears strong physical attacks. Life Orb is used for the free 30% boost in power to Clefable's attacks, but Leftovers is perfectly viable if you prefer more survivability. A spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature makes Clefable more difficult to bring down from the physical side, but it loses out on a great deal of power. Flamethrower can be used instead of Ice Beam to better deal with Roar Steelix and Steel-types in general. Fire + Electric also offers exceptional neutral coverage in RU, being walled only by Lanturn and Druddigon, the former being set-up bait for Clefable.</p> <p>As with most Clefable sets, this one fears strong physical attackers, especially Fighting-types such as Gallade, who can easily take any attack with its good special bulk and either KO Clefable outright or set up. As such, teammates that can take on the physical attackers that Clefable attracts, such as Qwilfish and Slowking, are once again appreciated. Calm Mind Psyshock Uxie is also a good counter to Clefable, as it can easily take Clefable's attacks, boost up alongside its, and comfortably 2HKO Clefable at +2, since Psyshock hits Clefable's unboosted Defense. Steelix and specially defensive Drapion counter Uxie by phazing its with Whirlwind, and also provide entry hazards to help Clefable gain the OHKOs and 2HKOs that it needs.</p> "

  "Vileplume": {
    "overview": "<p>Vileplume, on her own merits, is a very respectable Pokemon, but she has always received the short end of the stick from Game Freak. In the same generation she was introduced in, Game Freak saw fit to introduce Venusaur, who has better stats than Vileplume in everything other than Defense. Unsurprisingly, Vileplume has been relegated to at least a tier lower than Venusaur throughout the generations, and this honestly hasn't changed much in BW. Furthermore, despite the banishment of Venusaur and Roserade into higher tiers, Vileplume receives significant competition in RU from the newly introduced Amoonguss and now Eviolite-wielding Roselia; nonetheless, she is able to distinguish herself from them with her unique traits. Defensively, Vileplume has significantly more physical bulk than Roselia and boasts Aromatherapy over Amoonguss, so she acts as a neat mix of the two. Unlike the two, Vileplume is also capable of acting as a strong special attacker by utilizing her great STAB coverage and as an excellent tank due to her mix of power and bulk. Make no mistake, Vileplume is not a Pokemon to be underestimated.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Despite a wide variety of options at her disposal, Vileplume often struggles to utilize them effectively enough to distinguish herself from other Pokemon and most of the time becomes inferior to other RU Pokemon instead. Vileplume can attempt to use a Swords Dance set with powerful physical attacks in Seed Bomb, Bullet Seed, Drain Punch, Nature Power, and Return, but it is ineffective as Vileplume's pitifully low Speed and mediocre Attack prevent her from being a true threat. Moreover, she is horribly outclassed by Sawsbuck, Leafeon, and even Bellossom, who all boast the stronger STAB Leaf Blade, as well as either better Speed or superior bulk. In addition, Vileplume can attempt to go mixed to hit foes that wall her special attacks, such as Drain Punch for Munchlax and Cryogonal. Unfortunately, she is simply too weak to utilize these non-STAB physical attacks, as they only do marginally more damage against the majority of foes. Choice Scarf and Choice Specs might seem like decent items, but Vileplume is much too slow to utilize Choice Scarf effectively and often values the ability to switch moves over the slight power boost from Choice Specs. Petal Dance is Vileplume's strongest STAB move, but it is not a good move to be locked into as it is easily resisted and thus almost guarantees Vileplume's demise.</p> <p>Support-wise, Vileplume has some other moves that work nicely. Leech Seed is a wonderful support move that helps Vileplume wear down tough special walls such as Munchlax; she can even attempt to utilize the fabled SubSeed combination in tandem with her powerful Poison-type STAB attacks to ward off troublesome Grass-types that might attempt to stop Leech Seed. However, as far as healing is concerned, Moonlight is simply much more reliable, and Leech Seed does not deal with most of the Pokemon Vileplume has issues with. For example, Clefable, Roselia, Cryogonal, and Ferroseed are all Pokemon who couldn't care less about Leech Seed and will be glad for the opportunity to set up. Furthermore, Leech Seed is illegal with Effect Spore, which severely hinders Vileplume's usefulness with defensive sets. Stun Spore is another powerful option that Vileplume can use decently, as her great bulk ensures that she can repeatedly switch in to paralyze opponents, but she often has trouble finding room for it on her sets. Finally, Vileplume makes a very respectable user of Sunny Day because of her access to Chlorophyll, STAB Solar Beam, and Moonlight. However, keep in mind that stacking a sun team with only Grass- and Fire-type inducers and sweepers is rarely a good idea. As such, there are often better users of Sunny Day.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As with anything that carries a sleep-inducing move, RestTalk users are always recommended to prevent Vileplume's Sleep Powder from opening a huge hole in your team. Munchlax, the primary RestTalk user of RU, does an admirable job of completely and utterly walling Vileplume no matter what she does, and his ability to spread paralysis will further burden Vileplume. Alternatively, RestTalk Spiritomb, Magneton, and Hariyama are the next best choices, as they can still beat Vileplume, though not nearly as well as Munchlax can. If your prediction skills are good, you can use other RestTalk users such as Poliwrath and Lanturn. Although they lose to Vileplume one-on-one, they can switch in to take the Sleep Powder if necessary, but note that one misprediction will cause these Pokemon to take a huge amount of damage. Keep in mind, however, that all of these Pokemon are still somewhat crippled by sleep, as they will have to rely on the unreliable Sleep Talk. Therefore, you can instead opt to simply sacrifice a Pokemon to Sleep Powder, then attempt to wake it up once Vileplume has been removed from the match.</p> <p>Once a Pokemon has been put to sleep, Poison- and Steel-types are easily the best counters to Vileplume. As far as Steel-types go, Magneton and Klinklang are wonderful counters, as they can easily set up Substitutes against Vileplume's pitiful STAB attacks, then utilize their boosting move in Charge Beam or Shift Gear to wreak havoc. Ferroseed is another Steel-type who can switch in without fear and easily set up a layer of Spikes, making Vileplume a huge liability to her team. As for Poison-types, Drapion is an amazing counter against Vileplume due to his ability to Taunt her before setting up Toxic Spikes or wearing her down with Crunch. Though she doesn't resist Vileplume's Poison-type attacks, Roselia works equally well, as her wonderful special bulk lets her take Poison-type attacks with ease and set up layers of Spikes and Toxic Spikes. In fact, most special walls can take on Vileplume pretty easily too; Mandibuzz, Cryogonal, and Clefable can also take Vileplume's attacks with ease. Though they will not stop support Vileplume from providing cleric support, they can nonetheless switch into Vileplume for a free setup opportunity.</p> <p>Offensively, Vileplume has quite a few weaknesses thanks to her Grass / Poison typing, and Pokemon who can prey upon them generally work well. The likes of Entei, Scyther, Moltres, Gallade, and Medicham will easily wreck Vileplume with their powerful STAB moves, but note that they have issues switching into offensive variants. Scolipede in particular is able to switch into Vileplume's STAB attacks with ease, set up a Swords Dance, and slam Vileplume with its incredibly powerful Megahorn. Bulky Calm Mind users such as Sigilyph, Uxie, and Mesprit can all use Vileplume as setup bait and demolish her with super effective Psychic-type STAB attacks. Bouffalant deserves a special mention, as he can not only destroy Vileplume with his incredibly powerful Head Charge, but also switch into all of Vileplume's moves bar Sludge Bomb with ease--even gaining an Attack boost from Giga Drain and Sleep Powder.</p> ",

        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<p>Though she might seem outclassed by Roselia and Amoonguss, Vileplume differentiates herself from them by combining useful traits of the two. Vileplume's access to Aromatherapy and excellent physical bulk allow her to act as a physically defensive cleric while checking and countering almost every threat that Amoonguss does. This gives Vileplume a unique niche, as cleric support is not particularly widespread, and the ability to check threats such as Feraligatr, Hitmonlee, Rhydon, and Lilligant makes Vileplume useful outside of her clerical duties. Additionally, thanks to Vileplume's nice Special Attack, she can hit these threats reasonably hard with her STAB moves. However, Aromatherapy is the main reason you should be using Vileplume; without it, you might as well use Roselia or Amoonguss as your defensive Grass-type.</p> <p>Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb serve as Vileplume's obligatory STAB moves and allow her to check a variety of threats; Giga Drain nails foes such as Feraligatr and Hitmonlee for some nice damage, while Sludge Bomb dents Lilligant and Sawsbuck. These two moves also have wonderful synergy together, as only Poison- and Steel-types resist the combination; this prevents Vileplume from being setup bait. Moonlight serves as a reliable recovery move that keeps Vileplume healthy and capable of consistently checking troublesome threats while curing her team of status.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Vileplume's physical bulk, allowing her to check threats such as Rhydon, Feraligatr, and Hitmonlee. As Roselia outclasses Vileplume as a specially defensive cleric, this also distinguishes Vileplume from Roselia. However, a specially defensive spread is still viable, as Vileplume's access to Black Sludge gives her an advantage over Roselia, and Vileplume is also effective at checking the threats that Roselia usually checks, including Rotom and Galvantula. Alternatively, some Defense EVs can be shifted into Special Attack to hit foes harder. For example, with 132 EVs, you can guarantee that Vileplume will 2HKO Entei with Stealth Rock on the field. Effect Spore is the recommended ability, as Vileplume will often switch into contact moves, making it a great way to spread status to the opposing team.</p> <p>Sleep Powder and Stun Spore are viable options that can replace either Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb. The former gives Vileplume a weapon against almost anything and makes opponents wary of switching into her. The latter, on the other hand, provides slower teammates with useful paralysis support and allows them to tear through the opposing team without fear. However, Vileplume faces four-moveslot syndrome; each listed move is necessary for her to continually provide cleric support and check a wide variety of threats.</p> <p>To demonstrate how bulky Vileplume is, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>252 Atk+ Rhydon Earthquake 40.68% - 48.31% <li>252 Atk+ Life Orb Feraligatr Waterfall 18.08% - 21.47%</li> <li>252 Atk+ Life Orb Feraligatr Return 31.07% - 36.72%</li> <li>+2 252 Atk+ Life Orb Feraligatr Return 61.58% - 72.60%</li> <li>252 Atk+ Golurk Earthquake 39.27% - 46.61%</li> <li>252 Atk+ Life Orb Reckless Hitmonlee High Jump Kick 41.53% - 49.15%</li> <li>252 Atk Life Orb Aerodactyl Stone Edge 40.96% - 48.59%</li> <li>252 Atk+ Poliwrath Focus Punch 22.88% - 27.12%</li> <li>252 Atk Primeape Close Combat 18.93% - 22.60%</li> <li>252 Atk Primeape Ice Punch 31.64% - 37.85%</li> </ul> <p>As a supporting Pokemon, Vileplume doesn't really need that much support herself, as her access to reliable recovery and Aromatherapy allow her to be fairly self-sustaining. However, she does need certain teammates to deal with troublesome threats that can capitalize on her plethora of weaknesses. Like almost every Grass-type Pokemon in the game, Vileplume appreciates being paired with a Fire- and a Water-type Pokemon to form a core that packs good resistances and that can take on most threats with ease. Moltres and Entei work well with Vileplume, as Vileplume can beat troublesome Pokemon such as Feraligatr, Lanturn, and Rhydon for them, while they can destroy Ferroseed and Roselia, who would otherwise use Vileplume as setup bait. Slowking is another wonderful partner for Vileplume, as he can take on the likes of Moltres, Entei, and Gallade, who would normally give Vileplume trouble. In return, Vileplume can heal Slowking of Toxic with Aromatherapy. Rock- and Steel-types, such as Rhydon and Steelix, are also great partners as they ward off Flying-types, who can give Vileplume issues. Additionally, they appreciate the cleric support that Vileplume provides, as they both lack a form of recovery to mitigate the effects of status.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<p>In a throwback to DPP UU Venusaur, Vileplume can pull off a remarkably similar special attacking set to what was arguably the most prominent threat in that metagame; by utilizing the exact same STAB coverage and Special Attack stat that made Venusaur so fearsome, Vileplume is a very potent threat in the RU metagame. First and foremost, Vileplume has Sleep Powder to incapacitate the few Pokemon that can stand up to her powerful STAB coverage. Furthermore, there is nothing that compares to Vileplume's combination of bulk and power in RU: Amoonguss is too slow and weak, Roselia is weaker due to her need to use Eviolite, and Victreebel is incredibly frail. The only thing that holds Vileplume back is her poor Speed, but she can still outrun many common RU walls and deal massive damage off her good Special Attack. Overall, this Vileplume makes a fearsome tank. Like DPP UU Venusaur, she can switch into many prominent threats such as Sceptile (beware of Acrobatics), Tangrowth, Rotom-C, and Slowking and dish out incredibly powerful attacks to continually wear down the opposing team.</p> <p>Sludge Bomb and Giga Drain are Vileplume's quintessential offensive attacks, and they have remarkable coverage together. Sludge Bomb is Vileplume's main attack due to its significantly higher Base Power and excellent neutral coverage, while Giga Drain dents many common walls, such as Slowking and Poliwrath, and restores a significant amount of Vileplume's HP. With good prediction, the combination of these two moves will break down many common RU cores, including the Tangrowth and Slowking core. Because this requires an incredible amount of prediction to pull off successfully, Sleep Powder is a fantastic move, as it can simply be thrown out to cripple whatever switches in, should you feel unsure of your prediction skills. Sleep Powder also allows Vileplume to circumvent some of her counters by putting them to sleep and then bashing at them with her incredibly lethal STAB attacks. To round out this set, Moonlight gives Vileplume a very reliable form of recovery due to RU's lack of weather, and it helps mitigate Life Orb recoil, as well as damage from entry hazards and attacks, allowing Vileplume to stay alive to check troublesome threats and smack opponents with her powerful attacks.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Vileplume to outspeed uninvested base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Poliwrath, which allows her to quickly nail them with a powerful attack or Sleep Powder. Maximum Special Attack investment is highly recommended on Vileplume to make her as strong as she can possibly be, while any remaining EVs should be dumped into HP to give Vileplume some extra bulk. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is another decent option, as Vileplume still hits respectably hard and becomes able to outspeed troublesome foes such as Adamant Bouffalant and 2HKO them. On the other hand, fewer Speed EVs can be used if bulk is more important: 142 Speed EVs let Vileplume outrun uninvested Lanturn, 124 Speed EVs beat out uninvested base 65 Speed Pokemon such as Sandslash, and 84 Speed EVs can be used for base 60 Speed Pokemon such as Clefable. It is not recommended to run fewer Speed EVs unless you simply want to maximize HP, as beyond this, most Pokemon tend to use at least a little Speed investment. Effect Spore is the recommended ability; though unreliable, the 30% chance to inflict a status condition on the opposing Pokemon can come in handy, and Vileplume is too slow to make use of Chlorophyll. However, note that Chlorophyll has no move restrictions while Effect Spore does; moves such as Leech Seed can only be used with Chlorophyll. Hidden Power Fire can also be used over Moonlight if you desperately need a way to remove Steel-types.</p> <p>To show how powerful and bulky this Vileplume is, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>Sludge Bomb vs. +1 4/0 Lilligant 110.64% - 130.50% <li>Sludge Bomb vs. 0/0 Accelgor 92.69% - 108.97%</li> <li>Sludge Bomb vs. 4/0 Scolipede 47.71% - 56.11%</li> <li>Sludge Bomb vs. 0/0 Moltres 65.73% - 77.88%</li> <li>Sludge Bomb vs. 0/4 Bouffalant 58.31% - 68.88%</li> <li>Sludge Bomb vs. 252/0 Uxie 41.81% - 49.44%</li> <li>Sludge Bomb vs. 248/116+ Slowking 35.37% - 41.98%</li> <li>Giga Drain vs. 252/0 Poliwrath 83.33% - 98.44%</li> <li>Giga Drain vs. 52/204+ Lanturn 65.35% - 77.23%</li> <li>Giga Drain vs. 248/116+ Slowking 56.49% - 67.18%</li> <li>Giga Drain vs. 0/0 Aerodactyl 61.79% - 72.76%</li> </ul> <p>&lt;!-- --&gt;</p> <ul> <li>252 SpA Life Orb Accelgor Bug Buzz 57.24% - 67.43%</li> <li>252 SpA Life Orb Lilligant Hidden Power Fire 63.16% - 75.00%</li> <li>+1 252 SpA Lilligant Hidden Power Fire 73.68% - 86.84%</li> <li>+1 252 SpA Life Orb Lilligant Hidden Power Fire 95.39% - 112.50%</li> <li>252 Atk Life Orb Adaptability Crawdaunt Crunch 80.92% - 95.39%</li> <li>252 Atk Life Orb Sawsbuck Return 68.09% - 80.26%</li> <li>252 Atk Life Orb Scolipede Megahorn 75.00% - 88.16%</li> <li>252 Atk+ Choice Band Aggron Ice Punch 90.13% - 106.58%</li> </ul> <p>As you can see from these damage calculations, entry hazards are lethal for Vileplume, as she can just barely survive the attacks from some of RU's most powerful attackers. Furthermore, with entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and damage from attacks as she switches in, Vileplume will not last as long as one might like. As such, Rapid Spin support is recommended to increase Vileplume's longevity and allow her to keep dishing out powerful attacks. Kabutops, Sandslash, Hitmonchan, and Cryogonal make wonderful spinners to use alongside Vileplume. The former two are able to set up Stealth Rock for Vileplume in addition to spinning away entry hazards, while the latter two are extremely reliable spinners. Entry hazards of her own are also beneficial, as demonstrated by the above damage calculations. In addition to Sandslash and Kabutops, Omastar, Ferroseed, Qwilfish, and Crustle make excellent entry hazard users, as they can each use two different types of entry hazards to assist Vileplume.</p> <p>This set's main adversaries are defensive Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon, as they resist Vileplume's STAB combination and Sleep Powder can only do so much in dealing with them. Magneton makes a wonderful partner because of this, as it is immune to Poison-type attacks and can easily trap and KO troublesome Steel-types such as Ferroseed, Klinklang, and other Magneton. Alternatively, Ground-types such as Steelix, Sandslash, Golurk, and Rhydon can wield a STAB Earthquake that hits both Poison- and Steel- type Pokemon super effectively. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Munchlax, Cryogonal, Clefable, and Mandibuzz might also pose an issue if an opposing Pokemon is already asleep, so powerful physical attackers, particularly Hitmonchan, Entei, Aggron, Feraligatr, and Medicham, are recommended partners. Entei and Feraligatr also share wonderful type synergy with Vileplume, as Vileplume works well in the traditional Fire / Water / Grass core due to its members' abilities to take on each other's weaknesses extraordinarily well.</p> "

  "Poliwrath": {
    "overview": "<p>Poliwrath might look like just an average fighter with mediocre stats, but in reality, it is quite a formidable threat. A well-balanced stat distribution gives Poliwrath a few options in offensive and defensive sets, and a unique Water / Fighting typing grants it many useful resistances, while Water Absorb gives it a full immunity to Water-type attacks. These traits allow it to take on many of the most dangerous threats in RU, including Crawdaunt, Kabutops, Aggron, and Feraligatr. In addition, BW brought Poliwrath Circle Throw, a STAB phazing move which works extremely well on a bulky set. Even though Poliwrath is unable to excel in one specific role due to its all-around mediocre stats, it is certainly a Pokemon that has a solid niche in RU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Poliwrath has very few other options. It can use a Belly Drum set to raise its Attack to sky-high levels, but it will be easily revenge killed due to its low Speed. Hypnosis is another option, but its low accuracy makes it extremely unappealing, and Poliwrath has much better options. Finally, Poliwrath gets Swift Swim from the Dream World, which can help it overcome its poor Speed. However, other Water-type Pokemon, such as Kabutops and Ludicolo, are much better at sweeping in rain due to their wider movepools.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Tangrowth is the best counter to Poliwrath because of its massive Defense stat and Grass typing. Grass- and Electric-types in general are good checks to Poliwrath, as they can usually OHKO it with a super effective attack; some specific checks include Sceptile, Lilligant, Rotom-C, and Manectric. Ghost-types are also good counters to Poliwrath, as they are immune to its Fighting-type STAB. In addition, Rotom, Dusknoir, and Spiritomb can burn the SubPunch set, making it useless. Psychic-types will also destroy Poliwrath, and Sigilyph, Slowking, Uxie, and Mesprit all take minimal damage from anything Poliwrath can throw at them. Qwilfish walls Poliwrath and can set up entry hazards or Taunt it. Flying-types can hit Poliwrath with a super effective STAB move, and Mandibuzz in particular can prevent Poliwrath from healing or setting up a Substitute with Taunt. Lastly, bulky Swords Dance Scyther is a solid check, as it will beat Poliwrath one-on-one.</p> ",

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<p>Poliwrath is able to function as a physical wall in RU due to its unique typing, 90 / 95 / 90 defenses, and ability, Water Absorb. These qualities, along with Circle Throw, allow Poliwrath to counter and phaze many prominent threats, including Entei, Emboar, Escavalier, Crawdaunt, Aerodactyl, Kabutops, Aggron, and most variants of Durant. Protect can be used for scouting the opponent's movesets, as some may be packing moves specifically for dealing with Poliwrath and/or Qwilfish, a major example being Thunder Fang Durant. It also scouts your opponent's plays with Choice item users, allows for extra Leftovers recovery, and stalls for turns to build up Toxic damage. Carrying two status moves in Toxic and Scald allows Poliwrath to better take on both stall and offense teams, at the cost of some longevity. However, by replacing Protect and Toxic with RestTalk, Poliwrath is able to accomplish a couple of things that it otherwise could not. First, it can absorb status for the team and heal itself with Rest, a form of semi-reliable recovery. Second, Poliwrath is no longer completely useless while asleep, as Sleep Talk can choose Circle Throw, which will force out Poliwrath's counters.</p> <p>Despite having a low Base Power, Circle Throw hits relatively hard thanks to STAB. For example, it 2HKOes Clefable and Cryogonal, both of which take minimal damage from Scald. Speaking of which, Scald is a great move on this set, as it has a chance to burn troublesome opponents, such as Qwilfish and Ferroseed, which would otherwise wall this set, and is Poliwrath's best weapon against Emboar and other Fire-types. While Waterfall might seem appealing, Scald is superior for a couple of reasons, the most prominent being the burn chance, and also because it deals more damage to Pokemon like Aggron and Klinklang, breaking the latter's Substitutes in one hit.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Poliwrath's physical bulk, as it will primarily be used to take on physical attackers. If using Toxic and Protect, Poliwrath fits better on balanced teams, as it's more tailored to take on and cripple a larger variety of Pokemon while providing a defensive backbone. With RestTalk, Poliwrath becomes an immovable wall more suited to stall teams that don't care as much if Poliwrath has to rely on Sleep Talk to accomplish its job. Heal Bell support is nice for both sets, preventing Poliwrath from suffering from Toxic or burn if it carries Protect, and waking it up quicker if it carries RestTalk. Clefable is a good fit to provide cleric support for stall teams, whereas Gardevoir might be a better fit for balanced teams.</p> <p>Poliwrath loves entry hazard support, as it can phaze opponents with Circle Throw and rack up damage. The combination of Toxic, Scald, Circle Throw, and entry hazards all culminating around a single Pokemon is truly a brutal sight to behold. Thus, Roselia makes for a great partner, as it can lay Spikes or Toxic Spikes and has good type synergy with Poliwrath. Drapion is another good option to lay Toxic Spikes and beats a lot of the Pokemon that give Poliwrath trouble, particularly Lilligant and SubCM Uxie. Steelix and Golurk are great options to provide Stealth Rock, as they have pretty good type synergy with Poliwrath, and the former can continue the phazing chain with Roar. Poliwrath is weak to the ever-present Grass- and Psychic-type moves, so Pokemon that can switch in on the likes of Sceptile, Tangrowth, Rotom-C, Sigilyph, and Slowking make great teammates. Mandibuzz in particular comes to mind, as it resists Grass and is immune to Psychic; furthermore, it can also take advantage of the team's entry hazards with Whirlwind. Bouffalant is another great option, as it can garner a free Attack boost with Sap Sipper by switching into a Grass-type attack, and with entry hazard support, its attacks are fierce to say the least. Fire-types, such as Entei and Moltres, are great switch-ins to the aforementioned Grass-types and can eliminate them with ease.</p> "

        "name": "SubPunch",
        "description": "<p>Poliwrath can run an effective SubPunch set, as its numerous resistances allow it to easily set up a Substitute on the majority of Pokemon in RU. In addition to allowing Focus Punch to hit successfully, Substitute also blocks status, so Poliwrath won't have to worry about being burned by Spiritomb's Will-O-Wisp or being put to sleep by Lilligant's Sleep Powder. A STAB Focus Punch hits hard despite coming off of a base 85 Attack; it destroys common Normal-, Rock-, and Steel-types such as Clefable, Kabutops, and Steelix, respectively. Waterfall is Poliwrath's secondary STAB move, and it hits Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon for super effective damage. It also comes in handy when Poliwrath does not have a Substitute up, as Focus Punch will then be unreliable. As for the last moveslot, Bulk Up makes Poliwrath's Substitutes much harder to break with physical attacks. Bulk Up boosts Poliwrath's Attack stat as well, which allows it to deal more damage with Focus Punch and Waterfall. However, Encore gives Poliwrath more opportunities to set up Substitutes on Pokemon locked into Water-type moves.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Poliwrath to outspeed Adamant Aggron, and lets it hit as hard as possible while retaining as much bulk as possible. Alternative EV spreads of 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe or 40 HP / 252 Atk / 216 Spe allow for Poliwrath to outspeed Modest Omastar or Timid Omastar and 230 Speed Feraligatr, respectively. Poliwrath should use these if it has Encore, as it can lock these opponents into a Water-type move and set up a free Substitute. Toxic can be used in the last moveslot to hit Pokemon that resist Focus Punch, such as Spiritomb and Slowking.</p> <p>The likes of Tangrowth can take Poliwrath's moves, heal off the damage, and break Poliwrath's Substitutes. Thus, Pokemon that can eliminate such threats are great teammates. Fire-types are the best for the job; strong attacks such as Choice Band Entei's Flare Blitz can break through walls weakened by Focus Punch. In addition to helping to break walls, Poliwrath can provide solid resistances to Rock- and Water-type moves for its Fire-type teammates. Rotom-C is another recommended partner, as it resists Grass- and Electric-type attacks, and has Volt Switch to nab Poliwrath a free switch-in. Finally, a teammate with Toxic Spikes is extremely useful for wearing down opposing walls, such as Spiritomb and Slowking. Good setters of Toxic Spikes include Roselia and Drapion.</p> "

  "Victreebel": {
    "overview": "<p>Victreebel rarely had a chance to shine in previous generations, having few options to give it any niche. That changes in BW RU, where Victreebel becomes one of the most threatening Pokemon in the game with the proper support. Its great 105 / 100 mixed attacking stats, along with its very powerful offensive moves, make Victreebel a solid Pokemon. But that's not all—under Sunny Day, Victreebel becomes a monster; Chlorophyll doubles its Speed, while Growth does the same to its offenses. Sun makes or breaks Victreebel; under sun it is ridiculously powerful, 2HKOing the entire tier, but outside of it, Victreebel is all but dead weight.</p> <p>All this power comes at a price, however. Its poor defensive stats mean that even though it can decimate most of the tier in one or two hits, it will only be able to take one attack at best; priority also causes it huge problems defensively. Victreebel also has very limited offensive options, the lack of physical coverage practically requires it to go mixed. Although Victreebel has received very few changes since DPP, it is still capable of obliterating teams with some support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of the moves already mentioned, Victreebel has very few alternative choices. Sucker Punch is Victreebel's only form of priority, and can be used to pick off weakened Pokemon or Pokemon who could outspeed and threaten Victreebel. However, it generally lacks power without any boosts to back it up. Encore is an option that can grant Victreebel turns to set up; for example, Victreebel can Encore a wall using Toxic, and use this time to set up Growth. Unfortunately, this greatly reduces Victreebel's coverage and leaves it more vulnerable than it should be. A Swords Dance set is an alternative option to the mixed set; with a set of Leaf Blade, Sucker Punch, Swords Dance, and Return, Victreebel can hit most of the tier hard. However, this set struggles greatly with Steel-types and physical walls in general, only managing to 3HKO Steelix with a +2 Leaf Blade.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>With the immense power Victreebel wields, it is very difficult to find a Pokemon to take it on. If Victreebel is given the chance to set up, nothing in the tier is capable of avoiding a 2HKO. That said, Victreebel suffers from frailty, so attacking it immediately can weaken it to the point where a clean sweep is not an option. After it sets up, the best way to stop it is with smart switches that can outstall the sun turns and increase Life Orb recoil damage. Choice Scarf variants of base 100 Speed Pokemon, such as Typhlosion, are able to outspeed Victreebel in the sun, thereby revenge killing it before it wreaks too much havoc. The bulkier Pokemon in the tier can take one attack and fire back in return; Throh is the best option for this, but Gallade is also a good choice. Strong priority such as Entei's Extreme Speed or Absol's Sucker Punch will put Victreebel in a position where it cannot use more than a couple of attacks before fainting to Life Orb recoil, possibly even KOing it if Victreebel has switched into entry hazards.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed Growth",
        "description": "<p>This is the ultimate sun attacker; after a Growth boost, Victreebel is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing everything in RU. As the intent of the set is to cover the entirety of the tier, Victreebel's two STAB options, Leaf Blade and Sludge Bomb, attack off both the physical and special side, leaving nothing safe from its deadly assaults. Weather Ball is the key to this set, giving Victreebel perfect coverage, as well as a 100 Base Power Fire-type move under the sun, allowing it to gain a pseudo-STAB from the weather. The power this set provides is ridiculous, with only maximum Defense Munchlax, a niche option at best, able to withstand Victreebel's onslaught.</p> <p>Chlorophyll is the crux of any Victreebel set, doubling its Speed underneath the sun. Full investment in Speed ensures that Victreebel is able to outspeed Choice Scarf variants of base 95 Speed Pokemon, outspeeding and KOing threats such as Moltres and Sawsbuck. The given offensive EVs ensure that Victreebel will always OHKO Moltres and Entei with Sludge Bomb at +2 Special Attack, and will always 2HKO Munchlax with Leaf Blade after a Growth boost, which is important since those three Pokemon are the greatest threats to Victreebel's sweep.</p> <p>Victreebel's perfect type coverage is enhanced further by the use of Life Orb, ensuring that its one and two hit KOs remain as such. In terms of alternative moveset options, Solar Beam can be used over Leaf Blade, along with a purely specially-based EV spread. This makes the most of its destructive power and lets it take full advantage of the sun. With the additional EVs, Solar Beam is almost equally as effective as Leaf Blade in accomplishing a sweep, although it may force Victreebel to struggle more against dedicated special walls. Sleep Powder is a useful move on Victreebel, granting it the ability to incapacitate one of its counters. However, this choice gives it significant coverage issues, hindering a potential sweep. An alternative moveset utilizing Power Whip and Hidden Power Fire can be used in place of Leaf Blade and Weather Ball, as Power Whip and Weather Ball are an illegal breeding combination. This trades the power Weather Ball provides in favor of the sheer destruction Power Whip allows for, OHKOing almost anything that doesn't resist it.</p> <p>Despite the ridiculous power Victreebel has, it is quite frail, and almost any attacker is capable of at least 2HKOing it. Additionally, it absolutely requires Sunny Day support to function. To this end, Uxie makes an amazing partner for Victreebel, capable of setting up Sunny Day before U-turning out, as well as setting up Reflect and Light Screen, aiding Victreebel's set up. Victreebel also loves support from entry hazards, especially Spikes, as it turns many of the 2HKOs on opposing Pokemon into outright kills. Therefore, Qwilfish is an excellent partner thanks to its ability to set up Spikes, while also checking the opposing Fire-type Pokemon that give sun teams pause.</p> "

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Hindered by a horrible movepool, bad typing, and a severe Stealth Rock weakness, it's no wonder that Articuno is often overshadowed by its legendary counterpart Moltres in RU. Although Articuno doesn't have the same offensive presence that Moltres does, it boasts an amazing base 125 Special Defense stat and a decent base 90 HP stat, making it a capable phazer and stalling Pokemon. With the Pressure ability, as well as reliable recovery in the form of Roost, Articuno can be a great defensive asset to the right team if provided with the proper support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Articuno's movepool is sadly lacking. Ice Beam aside, Articuno's offensive options are limited to Hurricane and Hidden Power; sadly Articuno does not have the raw power of Moltres to warrant going offensive. However, Articuno does have a few viable support options; Tailwind and Heal Bell are great choices, as with proper management of Stealth Rock, Articuno can easily handle the frequent switching that these moves require. Haze can be used to defeat slower stat boosters, though Articuno can rarely find a moveslot for it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Generally, countering Articuno is not a difficult feat. Almost any Steel-type Pokemon can take it on; Klinklang can easily set up on or KO Articuno, and strong physical attackers that outrun Articuno can usually force a switch if it isn't behind a Substitute. Hitmonlee, Primeape, Entei, and Aggron are just a few common choices. Even some special attackers can take advantage of Articuno's horrible defensive typing. Typhlosion and Moltres absolutely wreck it with their STAB Fire-type moves, while Magneton resists both Toxic and Ice Beam and can easily set up on it. Even when behind a Substitute, Pokemon with access to Rock Blast such as Crustle and Cinccino pose as a severe threat to Articuno.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is the only set that Articuno can pull off effectively. Because of its nonexistent attacking capabilities, you must instead take advantage of Articuno's high defensive stats. With entry hazard support, Articuno serves as an effective phazer or Toxic staller. However, because it relies solely on Ice Beam for damage, it is recommended that Roar be used over Toxic so that Steel-type Pokemon cannot wall or set up on Articuno. Substitute is useful for Pressure stalling, racking up poison damage, avoiding status, and scouting for dangerous attacks. When combined with Pressure, Substitute allows Articuno to PP stall even super effective moves such as Stone Edge and Thunderbolt. Provided Articuno is faster, it can alternate between Substitute and Roost until the opponent runs out of PP or dies from poison damage.</p> <p>Articuno requires both Rapid Spin and entry hazard support in order to maximize its effectiveness at stalling. Kabutops is a solid choice thanks to its decent synergy with Articuno. If Roar is used in the fourth moveslot, an alternate EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 252 SpD can be used, as the extra bulk is helpful to a dedicated phazer. With 84 Speed EVs, Articuno outruns some notable Pokemon such as minimum Speed Uxie and Drapion, Adamant max Speed Bouffalant and Crawdaunt, and bulky Rotom-C and Gallade.</p> <p>Articuno struggles to do anything to Steel-type Pokemon; therefore, trappers such as Gothorita and Magneton are excellent choices for dealing with them.

  "Moltres": {
    "overview": "<p>The incredible beast known as Moltres has waited its turn and now eagerly preys on the souls of many players, as its power cannot be matched. Its dominance over the metagame is felt by many, and most teams have burned at the hand of Moltres. While Moltres always had the mighty Fire Blast to pulverize opponents with, it now has a shiny new toy to play with: Hurricane. Hurricane is a welcome upgrade over Air Slash, allowing Moltres to break through what was once arguably its best counter in Slowking with two Life Orb-boosted Hurricanes being a guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage. Moltres is one of the best wallbreakers in the metagame now, as it has very few defensive checks and can beat nearly all of the metagame's prominent defensive cores, including the Tangrowth + Slowking Regenerator core. However, this isn't as important as it once was because the core is dropping in popularity, due to new threats such as Durant, Escavalier, and of course our beloved Moltres. Moltres doesn't necessarily struggle against offensive teams either, as it boasts a base 90 Speed stat, which is pretty fast by RU standards.</p> <p>If all of this is true, then why hasn't Moltres been banned? First and foremost, Moltres's most crippling flaw comes with its typing; being 4x weak to Stealth Rock does it no favors. This means that Moltres must always be used alongside a spinner, and the pickings of effective spinners are rather slim in the metagame. While Cryogonal and Kabutops boast the ability to beat nearly all of the prominent spinblockers in the metagame, Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee are not nearly as reliable and can be responsible for Moltres's premature death. Moltres can also be revenge killed quite easily, since Hidden Power Rock is common among fast special attackers such as Sceptile, Accelgor, and Typhlosion, and priority moves such as Aqua Jet and Sucker Punch are prominent in the metagame as well. Moltres also suffers from Hurricane's extreme unreliability, since it's almost a coin flip to see if Moltres will hit two of them in a row. Nevertheless, Moltres is stupidly good at what it does, and it was almost singlehandedly responsible in Slowking's rise to fame as well as Lanturn's, and it is a top-tier threat that must be handled in some way before it's allowed to rampage through your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Moltres has a few other options that it can use, but none of them are as effective as the sets listed above. Atop the list is a Sunny Day set, with Fire Blast and Solar Beam both taking advantage of the sun's effects and Roost being used to ensure longevity. While this is a decent set that can be used to lure in and beat Slowking and Lanturn, Typhlosion usually does this better due to its higher Speed, allowing it to beat more offensive threats. Overheat is Moltres's most powerful STAB move, but it is generally inferior to Fire Blast because Moltres gets pretty much all the KOs it needs, and two Fire Blasts will do more damage than two Overheats. Both Flame Charge and Agility can be used to boost Moltres's Speed, with the latter being superior for its ability to outspeed every common Choice Scarf user after a single boost. Morning Sun is another healing move that Moltres has access to, and can be good if you don't want Moltres to lose its Flying typing while healing. Roar can also be used on more defensive sets, although it isn't as useful as some of Moltres's other moves and can't really find a place on any set. Moltres also has a decent Attack stat that it can make use out of, but lacks any good STAB moves. Its only option to use its Attack would likely be a Choice Band set using Double-Edge, U-turn, and other less useful moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Lanturn is the best all-purpose counter to Moltres, as it can easily take multiple Fire Blasts and Hurricanes before retaliating with Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, or Scald. However, with hazards on the field Moltres can power through it with consecutive Hidden Power Grasses. Even the defensive set is beaten by RestTalk Lanturn, which is probably the most well-equipped Lanturn set to handle Moltres throughout the match. While Slowking can no longer be classified as a counter, it is Moltres's best common check, only fearing two Hurricanes after Stealth Rock. Slowking can still force it out, or else Moltres will be crippled by Thunder Wave or Toxic, and be slowly worn down by Scald.</p> <p>While Hurricane has made Moltres a bit harder to directly counter, it can still be checked easily by a number of things. One of the best checks to Moltres is the ever-present Stealth Rock, costing Moltres half its health upon switching in. Steelix, Uxie, Rhydon, and Aerodactyl are all common users of Stealth Rock. There are many fast specially attacking Electric-types in the RU metagame; Galvantula, Manectric, Rotom, and Choice Scarf Rotom-C are all adept at revenge killing Moltres. However, Manectric and Rotom-C need to use Thunderbolt to ensure the KO without a boosting item, and Rotom needs a Life Orb to KO Moltres with Thunderbolt. Other fast special attackers, such as Accelgor, Sceptile, and Typhlosion, can all use Hidden Power Rock effectively, KOing Moltres without a second thought. Primeape and Hitmonlee can run Stone Edge to deal with Moltres; while Primeape naturally outspeeds Moltres, Hitmonlee can utilize a Normal Gem-boosted Fake Out to activate Unburden, giving Hitmonlee the Speed it needs to outrun Moltres. Entei and Magmortar are also decent checks despite being slower than Moltres, since Entei has no chance to get KOed by a Life Orb Hurricane at full health, while Magmortar only has a small chance. They can both KO back with Stone Edge and Thunderbolt, respectively. Aerodactyl and Archeops both outspeed Moltres and happen to resist its STAB moves, and they can swiftly end it with Stone Edge. Moltres is also vulnerable to common priority, with Aqua Jet users, such as Feraligatr and Kabutops, and Sucker Punch users, such as Absol and Spiritomb, threatening it. However, Moltres will only be KOed after Stealth Rock, and can avoid Sucker Punch through the use of Roost.</p> <p>Moltres also has some shakier defensive checks, too. Clefable and Mandibuzz are the first ones that come to mind, and both can hit Moltres with a timely Toxic to keep it from sweeping the rest of their team. However, Clefable can be 2HKOed by Life Orb Fire Blast, and needs to be in tiptop shape to take on Moltres. Mandibuzz can take its hits well, but not well enough that Moltres can't easily 2HKO it after Stealth Rock. There are also some less common defensive checks to Moltres, including Flareon, Altaria, Lickilicky, and specially defensive Regirock. Flareon and Altaria suffer from the same fate as Mandibuzz, since while they are bulky and resist Fire Blast, they are hit equally hard by Hurricane and aren't bulky enough to avoid the 2HKO after Stealth Rock. Lickilicky and Regirock are both solid, but as always repeated powerful attacks will bring them down. Lickilicky has semi-reliable recovery in Wish, and can hit Moltres with Toxic or Thunder Wave, and Regirock can destroy Moltres with its STAB moves.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>Through metagame shifts and BW2, Moltres's standard set has remained mostly the same. Moltres is most commonly seen using a Life Orb to take advantage of its awesome power and coverage, making it very difficult to directly counter. Fire Blast is the primary STAB move of the set, and is preferred over Hurricane most of the time because Fire-type attacks have better coverage in RU, hitting special walls such as Roselia and Cryogonal super effectively. However, Hurricane is still very useful, as most notably it grants Moltres a way to 2HKO Slowking after Stealth Rock. This allows Moltres to singlehandedly beat the Tangrowth + Slowking Regenerator core with a single move, although this was more important in a past metagame. Hurricane is also useful for Dragon-types such as Druddigon and Fraxure, as well as Fire-types such as Entei, Magmortar, and opposing Moltres. Don't count on it too much though, as it has been known to let you down with its poor accuracy.</p> <p>While Moltres's two STAB moves are usually set in stone, its third move most certainly isn't. Hidden Power Grass and Substitute are both very good options, with the former being more threatening to stall, and the latter being more threatening to offense. Hidden Power Grass is useful for hitting the Pokemon that resist both Fire Blast and Hurricane, such as Lanturn, Kabutops, and Rhydon. Lanturn is typically a tough nut to crack, but can be beaten with multiple Hidden Power Grasses and the help of some entry hazards. On the other hand, Substitute allows Moltres to combat two of its biggest problems: status and revenge killers. While Moltres can set up a Substitute easily against most Fighting-types, Tangrowth, and Roselia as it forces them out, it is significantly worse against stall teams, since Lanturn becomes untouchable and Slowking has a lower chance to get 2HKOed by Hurricane due to the extra turn of Leftovers recovery. It is very rare to see a stall team without one of these two Pokemon. The reason that Moltres can feasibly run Substitute is the power of Hurricane; Kabutops and offensive Omastar are 2HKOed by it, and Rhydon that didn't invest heavily in Special Defense were already 2HKOed by Fire Blast. That being said, Hidden Power Grass will be sorely missed for its perfect accuracy.</p> <p>Roost is really the only option in the last slot, although Moltres hardly needs a fourth move to wreak havoc. Nevertheless, Roost is useful for healing damage taken from Stealth Rock, allowing you to brace for another switch-in if your spinner is dead, or if Moltres happens to be brought in via a phazing move. It also comes in handy against the likes of Absol and Spiritomb, as they must use Sucker Punch to KO Moltres or else they die to Fire Blast. If running Substitute, Roost is even more important, because while Hidden Power Grass variants tend to come in and smash things, Substitute variants use Substitute first and then smash things, and Roost is needed a lot earlier.</p> <p>Maximum Speed along with a Timid nature is absolutely necessary for Moltres because it needs to be able to outspeed Lilligant so it can avoid the Speed tie and KO it first. Note that while Lilligant shares the same base Speed as Moltres, it always uses a Hidden Power that lowers its Speed IV. While the 4 Defense EVs aren't especially helpful for surviving certain attacks, putting them here instead of in HP allows Moltres to switch into Stealth Rock twice without dying. Life Orb is the item of choice on this set, as Moltres absolutely needs its power to get several key KOs, such as the OHKO on Rhydon with Hidden Power Grass. However, Leftovers is a viable item choice when using Substitute. While Life Orb is still better most of the time, Leftovers works well since it doesn't force Moltres to use Roost as often. Despite this, note that the main reason that Moltres can afford to use only two attacking moves for coverage is that Hurricane can 2HKO most things that resist it; with Leftovers, that's no longer true. Flamethrower or Air Slash can be used for reliability, but only Flamethrower is worth the higher accuracy.</p> <p>Moltres should never be used without a spinner, and this set is no exception. Cryogonal and Kabutops are the two best choices, with Cryogonal taking on Electric-type revenge killers to Moltres, and Kabutops beating most of Moltres's checks with a Swords Dance set. Moltres also appreciates entry hazards so it can ensure a sweep. With Stealth Rock alone, Hurricane is a guaranteed 2HKO on Slowking, and OHKOes Magmortar and Entei. Ferroseed is a good teammate that can set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and also provides paralysis support for Moltres, which is useful against offensive teams. Smeargle is another effective hazard-setter that works well on offensive teams, and is certain to give your opponent a headache. Manectric is a good offensive partner that can use Switcheroo to cripple walls, and hits Slowking and Mandibuzz super effectively with its STAB moves. Tangrowth is another good partner that switches into Lanturn and Slowking that lack Fire Blast fairly easily before annihilating them with Leaf Storm. Moltres can also switch into and beat some of Tangrowth's best checks, such as Roselia and Cryogonal.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Moltres already carries immense power, it can obliterate everything in sight when equipped with Choice Specs. Choice Specs Moltres is one of the best wallbreakers in the tier, and is even better than it was before because of Hurricane. Defensive threats that used to be able to check Moltres, such as Lanturn and Clefable, don't stand a chance against this set. It's an effective lure as well, luring in the aforementioned special walls as well as Slowking, and 2HKOing all of them with the appropriate move. This set has very few safe switch-ins, but it is significantly easier to play around because of its lack of Roost. To demonstrate the destruction that Moltres is capable of causing, here are some damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252/252+ Clefable 56.29%-66.23% <li>Fire Blast vs. 248/244+ Mandibuzz 50.95%-59.94%</li> <li>Fire Blast vs. 252/0 Dusknoir 75.44%-88.75%</li> <li>Hurricane vs. 248/116+ Slowking 55.18%-64.93%</li> <li>Hurricane vs. 104/0 Feraligatr 99.31%-116.38%</li> <li>Hurricane vs. 252/0 Druddigon 87.47%-102.91%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 40/252+ Lanturn 47.99%-56.46%</li> <li>Hidden Power Grass vs. 252/240 Rhydon 91.99%-108.23%</li> </ul> <p>Fire Blast is the move that will see the most use, if only for its superior accuracy compared to Hurricane. It gets better neutral coverage overall as well, hitting the many Grass-types in RU as well as Cryogonal especially hard. Hurricane is another wildly powerful STAB move that hits a lot of the Pokemon that resist Fire Blast, with the most notable examples being Slowking, Entei, and Feraligatr. It is also useful to eliminate the need for prediction in certain instances such as when facing a Tangrowth + Slowking Regenerator core. While your opponent will most likely switch out of Tangrowth into Slowking, you don't have to make a choice of which move to use since Hurricane does as much damage to Tangrowth as Fire Blast does, but Slowking is hit much harder by Hurricane. Hidden Power Grass rounds out Moltres's coverage, hitting the Rock-types and Lanturn that resist both of its STABs. Hidden Power Grass can 2HKO Lanturn with Stealth Rock support, and is a guaranteed OHKO on most variants of Rhydon, as well as Kabutops. While the last slot is mostly filler as Moltres can accomplish its goal with three moves, U-turn is the best option, since it can keep momentum against stall or balanced teams and can take advantage of hazards.</p> <p>The 4 Defense EVs are of little importance, but if put into HP then Moltres wouldn't be able to switch into Stealth Rock twice without dying. A Modest nature might seem like it would be a good fit on the set to hit as hard as physically possible, but a Timid nature is strongly recommended as otherwise Moltres won't even be able to outspeed Pokemon with base 80 Speed such as Gallade, Mesprit, and Medicham. A Timid nature also allows Moltres to outspeed Rotom-C and Lilligant, two Pokemon that would be troublesome if Moltres couldn't outspeed them. Air Slash can be used for its higher accuracy and flinch chance, but Hurricane grants Moltres too many KOs for it to be easily given up. Roost can be used over U-turn if you feel that Moltres needs it, and it will probably be more useful than U-turn in some matches, but it's a question of sacrificing Moltres for momentum, or allowing Moltres to live while giving up momentum.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is more crucial to this set's success more than any other set, mainly because Moltres doesn't even have Roost to offset Stealth Rock damage. Cryogonal and Kabutops are both trusty spinners that can beat the majority of spinblockers in the tier. Hitmonchan is a pretty good partner that appreciates the wallbreaking that Moltres does and appreciates both Tangrowth and Slowking out of the way. It can take on Lanturn decently well, and can even stick Rapid Spin on its set to aid Moltres; don't expect it to beat spinblockers though. Smeargle is a good hazard setter for offensive teams that Moltres works well in, and with entry hazards on the field Moltres will have no safe switch-ins. Lanturn is another good partner that offers paralysis support, and can switch into Slowking and opposing Fire-types that can take advantage of Moltres locked into Fire Blast, which is the move that it will be using most of the time.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Agility",
        "description": "<p>You'll find that by using Agility, Moltres has all the tools it needs to pull off an effective sweeping set. With enough power to 2HKO the entire tier, and ability to outspeed nearly the whole tier after a single boost, Moltres has the capability to double up as a simultaneous wallbreaker and sweeper. While Moltres is more often seen using traditional wallbreaking sets or acting as a wall itself, by making use of Agility, it can take it another step further by bringing its terrifying power to the face of both defensive and offensive teams alike.</p> <p>Exploiting this set's power is all about executing it at the best possible moment; in other words, save it for mid- to late-game. It is best to use Agility when Moltres forces out a bulky Grass-type or when facing an opponent that is Choice-locked into a resisted attack. When against a bulky target that takes neutral damage from all three of Moltres's attacks, such as Clefable, Bouffalant, and Uxie, it is better to use Hurricane as opposed to Flamethrower; this is especially true due to the fact that if either of the previously mentioned Pokemon have not attained enough residual damage, they will be able to take a Flamethrower and either cripple or outright OHKO Moltres. In stark contrast to Hurricane, Flamethrower doesn't have that shaky 70% accuracy. This is quite useful in situations where Moltres is up against fast, frail attackers such as Cinccino, Unburden Hitmonlee, and Accelgor. A miss against these types of Pokemon will likely make the difference between a continued sweep and a dead sweeper.</p> <p>The final two moves are dependent on how you plan to support Moltres. If you decide to make it a primary goal to keep Stealth Rock off the field, then making use of Hidden Power Grass is useful, as it allows Moltres to demolish both Rhydon and Omastar—two Pokemon that resist Moltres's STABs. Hidden Power Grass's perfect accuracy also makes it \"safer\" to use than Hurricane when it comes to dealing with bulky Water-types such as Alomomola. However, if you plan on supporting Moltres by pairing it with Grass-type attackers, you'll find that Roost can be useful in more ways than one. First off, Roost allows Moltres to regain its health from Stealth Rock should its Rapid Spinning partner fail to keep the entry hazard off the field. Second, you'll find that Moltres can take advantage of Pressure + Roost to play mindgames with the likes of Sucker Punch Absol. Thirdly, Roost will allow Moltres to offset the damage from Life Orb recoil and/or priority attacks against less threatening targets. In short, whichever of the two moves you decide to use in the last slot is dependent on how Moltres functions relative to the structure of your team.</p> <p>First and foremost, the given EVs allow Moltres to outspeed Choice Scarf Cinccino and Unburden Hitmonlee after an Agility boost; once boosted by Agility, the Speed EVs give Moltres an almost guaranteed win condition versus offensive teams. This win condition is supplemented by the fact that Moltres can easily one-shot most, if not all, standard hyper-offensive Pokemon and withstand the strongest priority moves in RU at least once. However, Moltres can make use of a bulkier spread. For example, a spread consisting of 96 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA / 156 Spe with Leftovers as the main item and a Modest nature is most certainly a viable alternative. After an Agility boost, the given spread allows Moltres to outspeed everything up to Choice Scarf Manectric. Moreover, the bulkier EV spread combined with Leftovers allows Moltres to withstand priority attacks with greater ease. For instance, Moltres now has the bulk to take not one, but two of Choice Band Entei's Extreme Speeds and avoid the 2HKO From Spiritomb's Black Glasses-boosted Sucker Punch.</p> <p>The only other viable move Moltres can make use of on this set is Fire Blast. Generally, it is better to use Flamethrower in place of Fire Blast, as having two inaccurate STABs can prove to be costly in situations where Moltres cannot afford to miss. However, Fire Blast's 85% accuracy isn't as shaky as Hurricane's 70%, so the risk factor is considerably lower. Although the main draw when it comes to utilizing Fire Blast is the increased damage output—in contrast to Flamethrower—along with the increased accuracy—in contrast to Hurricane—which allows Moltres to OHKO the likes of offensive Spiritomb and Mesprit without relying on Hurricane's coin flip-like consistency.</p> <p>As with any Moltres set, Pokemon that can utilize Rapid Spin aid it immensely, given that Stealth Rock damage will deteriorate its performance. When the pointed stones aren't jabbing away at its health, Moltres will have an easier time setting up and be better equipped to take on priority attackers. To get an idea of how vital it is to keep Stealth Rock off the field, Moltres is put into KO range for a slew of priority attacks it would have otherwise survived at full health. For example, Absol's Sucker Punch, Choice Band Entei's Extreme Speed, and Feraligatr's Aqua Jet get a clean OHKO after Stealth Rock damage. Moreover, Moltres now finds itself OHKOed by even resisted attacks such as Adamant Medicham's High Jump Kick. By providing Moltres with Rapid Spin support, it not only has an easier time setting up for a sweep, but it is able to maintain that sweep too. Kabutops and Cryogonal are the most reliable at providing Moltres with Rapid Spin support. Kabutops has the distinction of being able to defeat every spinblocker one-on-one, allowing it to pull off a Rapid Spin with a high success rate. Kabutops can even lure out Grass-types for Moltres to set up on. In terms of offensive synergy, both Kabutops and Moltres complement each other very well, as after a Swords Dance boost, Kabutops can take down Lanturn, Rhydon, and Omastar with ease, thus paving the way for Moltres's sweep. Unlike Kabutops, Cryogonal has a much easier time lasting throughout the match thanks to its access to reliable recovery. Cryogonal also checks Electric-types that harry Moltres, such as Manectric, Galvantula, Lanturn, and Rotom.</p> <p>Do note, however, that both Pokemon share some distinct flaws with Moltres; Kabutops and Moltres both share a weakness to Electric-type attacks, while Cryogonal and Moltres are both quickly dealt with by powerful Rock-types such as Aerodactyl. It is imperative to provide each of the following pairs with the right support. For example, Kabutops and Moltres will appreciate Druddigon's partnership so that it can provide the two with entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock and act as a bulwark for Electric- and Water-type attacks. On the other hand, Cryogonal and Moltres will appreciate support from the likes of Tangrowth, providing both with a solid switch-in to many physical attackers and a way to deal with Water-types in general.</p> <p>In order to optimize on Moltres's ability to dish out damage, entry hazard support is highly recommended. Entry hazard support allows Moltres to achieve a plethora of KOs it wouldn't have otherwise. For example, with the aid of Stealth Rock, Moltres can take out Bouffalant, Mesprit, offensive Spiritomb, and Entei in one shot with Hurricane. In addition, entry hazard support breaks Focus Sashes and Sturdy from the likes of Crustle and Accelgor, with the former item being common on hyper offensive teams. By removing their lease on life, Moltres will not have to fear an OHKO from either Accelgor's Hidden Power Rock or Crustle's Rock Blast. One of the best partners to set up Stealth Rock is Smeargle. On top of setting up Stealth Rock, Smeargle can also set up Spikes, give Moltres a chance to set up with the use of Spore, and help get it in safely with Explosion, Memento, or U-turn. Just like Smeargle, Rotom-C and Amoonguss can help get Moltres in safely or give it free setup opportunities with Volt Switch and Spore, respectively. Due to their Grass typing, offensive variants of Rotom-C and Amoonguss can take out many of Moltres's checks if it lacks Hidden Power Grass. Such Pokemon include Rhydon, Omastar, Lanturn, and Regirock. Similar offensive support involves Pokemon that can break down walls; the likes of Clefable, mixed Absol, and Emboar all work effectively at doing so. While none of those three Pokemon share particularly good synergy with Moltres, they all come with other added benefits. The entire premise of pairing Moltres and Emboar is to overload the opposition's Fire-type check(s), as they are more likely to stay in on Emboar as opposed to a Grass-type; by weakening these Pokemon, Moltres will have an easier time attempting to sweep. In contrast to Emboar, Clefable's respectable bulk allows it to easily switch into Moltres's defensive checks such as Lanturn and Slowking. From there, it can proceed to demolish the two with its STAB- and Life Orb-boosted Double-Edge. Absol can take it a step further by Pursuit trapping the likes of Uxie and Slowking, both of which can tank an attack at full health and cripple Moltres with Thunder Wave. In a similar vein to Absol, Escavalier can also Pursuit trap the above Pokemon and other dedicated special sponges such as Clefable and Lanturn (watch out for Scald burns), but its excellent bulk in comparison gives it a much easier time switching in.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive SubRoost",
        "description": "<p>Moltres can also use a more defensive set effectively. This set takes advantage of Moltres's handy resistances as well as Pressure to be an effective Toxic staller. With Pressure, Moltres can stall out low-PP moves such as Stone Edge, as well as Electric-type moves such as Thunderbolt. Moltres is fast for a defensive Pokemon, so it is easily able to stall out the likes of Entei and Magmortar, even though they carry threatening moves. Only Poison-types, such as Qwilfish and Drapion, can switch in freely without fear of Toxic, since bulky Water-types that would switch in to resist Moltres's Fire-type attack would be crippled by Toxic, while Steel-types that hope to avoid Toxic are wrecked by Flamethrower. Not only can Moltres spread Toxic around your opponent's team, it is also very capable of stalling out the damage using the combination of Substitute and Roost. What makes Moltres so effective as a Toxic staller is its Fire typing that can be used to obliterate Steel-types such as Escavalier and Steelix. This set is especially effective against balanced teams, since walls are stalled out, and offensive Pokemon don't want to switch in for fear of Toxic.</p> <p>248 HP EVs are used to increase Moltres's overall bulk as much as possible while still allowing it to switch into Stealth Rock twice without dying. 228 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Adamant Entei, Magmortar, and Rotom-C, allowing you to stall out Stone Edge or Thunderbolt before they can KO Moltres, and the remaining EVs are thrown into Defense to take physical hits better. Leftovers is the only viable item choice, as the constant recovery allows Moltres to keep making Substitutes. For a slightly different variation of this set, you can use Will-O-Wisp and invest in Special Defense instead. This allows Moltres to take on physical attackers better, but it's generally much less effective because a draw of this set is that Moltres can either Toxic stall an opponent to death or KO Steel-types with Flamethrower. Moltres is completely helpless against Fire-types when using Will-O-Wisp, since they are immune to the move and don't take much damage from Flamethrower either.</p> <p>Cryogonal and Kabutops are the spinners that should be used along with Moltres; it's a necessity to carry a Rapid Spin user when using Moltres. While this set appreciates hazards, it appreciates a different kind of hazards than Moltres's other sets; Toxic Spikes allow Moltres to begin the cycle of Substitute and Roost without wasting a turn on Toxic, although they aren't that effective in the current metagame due to the number of grounded Poison-types. Nevertheless, Drapion, Qwilfish, and Omastar can all set them up with ease. To deal with Poison-types, a Ground-type like Rhydon or Golurk might be of use to your team, taking care of Drapion and Qwilfish somewhat easily. All of them can support Moltres with Stealth Rock should it come in handy, but Sandslash can also aid Moltres with Rapid Spin. This set is threatened by Rock Blast users, such as Rhydon, so something to absorb the hit, such as Ferroseed, is a good partner. Steelix and Mandibuzz are also fine partners because of their phazing abilities, allowing them to defeat Substitute users that can beat the set such as Gallade.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>While the inaccuracy of Moltres's STAB moves and its massive 4x weakness to Stealth Rock may make it seem as if Moltres would be a poor candidate to attach a Choice Scarf to, the sheer power and neutral coverage of Hurricane makes it a very potent wielder of the item. So long as it is able to hit its moves, Choice Scarf Moltres can act as a potent revenge killer and check to some of the most dangerous threats in the tier, including Pokemon such as Durant and Sceptile, which are otherwise extremely difficult to answer on more offensive teams. Additionally, due to the lack of any common specially bulky Pokemon that are resistant to Flying-type moves, if Moltres can hit multiple Hurricanes in a row, this set is very capable of cleanly shredding though teams if it is allowed to simply spam the move, as Hurricane alone can cleanly 2HKO offensive checks such as Manectric. This set is also notable for being one of the best ways for Moltres to muscle past what is arguably its most common counter, Aerodactyl, due to its ability to outspeed and 2HKO most sets as long as Stealth Rock is up, barring significant HP or Special Defense investment.</p> <p>Hurricane is largely what allows this set to function, despite an awful 70% accuracy. Hurricane's 120 Base Power allows it to tear huge chunks of HP out of most switch-ins and is generally just extremely difficult to switch into due to its insanely good neutral coverage. Fire Blast acts as a powerful secondary STAB move that hits some of the threats that are resistant to Hurricane, notably Steel-types such as Steelix and Aggron, and its greater accuracy allows it to be used in situations where you need the reliability to secure a KO. Aside from these two moves, the remaining slots are essentially filler due to the fact that Moltres lacks strong additional coverage moves and generally doesn't want to be locked into anything other than the first two moves, but there are some neat utility moves that are usable in the last two slots. U-turn is a neat scouting move that is useful against teams where Moltres cannot freely spam Hurricane and Fire Blast, as it allows Moltres to force out a threat while gaining momentum for its team. However, due to Moltres's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, it is a move that should be used conservatively unless you have effective entry hazard removal on your team. Finally, Sleep Talk is a nice niche option to have against teams with sleep inducers such as Lilligant and Tangrowth, but Flamethrower and Air Slash are acceptable options as well if you already have a sleep absorber and want the extra reliability those moves provide.</p> <p>The EV spread here is fairly straightforward. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature are important, as they allow Moltres to outspeed Pokemon that sit below base 90 Speed and hold a Choice Scarf, including the prominent Rotom-C. Notably, these EVs will also allow Moltres to just barely outspeed Choice Scarf Lilligant the majority of the time, as Moltres's lack of a Speed-lowering Hidden Power will put it one Speed point ahead. Maximum Special Attack is needed given that Moltres's STAB moves are both special attacks, and the remaining 4 EVs can be placed in either Defense or Special Defense; either is effective, as the key thing is not putting them into HP, as doing so will give Moltres an even HP and only allow Moltres to switch into Stealth Rock once.</p> <p>The worst enemies of this set are specially defensive Pokemon that resist Hurricane and Fire Blast, as they can continuously switch into Moltres's most damaging moves and force it out, causing it to potentially lose 50% of its HP on its next switch into Stealth Rock and lose a ton of momentum for its team unless it predicts the switch effectively and is able to use U-turn. Pokemon such as Slowking, Lanturn, Regirock, and Rhydon are this set's worst nightmare, as they're bulky enough to shrug off multiple attacks and either pivot for momentum in the case of Slowking and Lanturn or set up Stealth Rock to dissuade Moltres from switching in. Rotom-C and Sceptile are excellent choices to deal with these threats, as they resist Water- and Electric-type attacks and are incredibly punishing to switch into due to the threat of Volt Switch from Rotom-C and Choice Specs-boosted Leaf Storm from Sceptile.</p> <p>Furthermore, although this set is less dependent on it than other Moltres sets, Rapid Spin support is appreciated due to Moltres's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Of the spinners available in RU, the only real options are Cryogonal and Kabutops, as the other spinners are too unreliable to be worth pairing with Moltres. Of the two, Cryogonal is the more reliable spinner, although its shared weakness with Moltres can prove to be problematic, while Kabutops has more synergy with Moltres in terms of typing.</p> "

  "Meganium": {
    "overview": "<p>Among the plethora of Grass-types available in RU, Meganium truly doesn't have too much to offer over its competition. However, with its good all-around bulk, and access to Aromatherapy and Dragon Tail, Meganium does have a niche in providing both moves in one teamslot, and with its lack of a secondary typing, it keeps useful resistances to Electric-, Ground-, and Water-type moves that some other Grass-types do not possess. Outside of this role, however, Meganium suffers immensely from its low attacking stats and weaknesses to common types of moves such as Bug and Fire that leave it weak to common threats such as Entei and Escavalier. Unless you need the specific role Meganium provides, you are probably better off using a different Grass-type such as Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Torterra, or Roselia.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Meganium could run a Swords Dance set with Seed Bomb, Earthquake, and Return, but such a set is usually outclassed by either the much faster and stronger Sceptile or the bulkier and much stronger Torterra. In addition, Meganium has no strong physical moves, meaning it takes a long time to start hitting hard. Hidden Power Fire is always an option for anything that struggles against Escavalier, but unfortunately an uninvested Hidden Power Fire will never get close to OHKOing Escavalier. There are many strong STAB moves that Meganium has access to, including Solar Beam alongside Sunny Day, Leaf Storm, and Petal Dance. Unfortunately, Meganium lacks the power to take advantage of them, leaving it outclassed by Pokemon such as Lilligant in this regard.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Meganium is relatively easy to counter due to its low offensive presence. Pokemon that can hit it hard enough to OHKO it, such as Escavalier, Durant, Entei, Braviary, and Emboar, none of which fear taking an significant damage from Giga Drain, are good options. Bouffalant, however, is quite possibly Meganium's best counter, as it has Sap Sipper and Meganium's Dragon Tail won't even break its Substitutes in two hits, giving it plenty of time to set up. Anything else with Sap Sipper, such as Miltank and Sawsbuck, also walls it and can take advantage of the boost Sap Sipper provides. Cryogonal walls Meganium with its high Special Defense, can use Rapid Spin to eliminate the entry hazards Meganium relies on, and can hit back with a STAB Ice Beam. Grass / Poison types such as Roselia and Amoonguss are immune to Toxic; Roselia can set up Spikes on Meganium and wear it down with Sludge Bomb, and Amoonguss has Regenerator to mitigate entry hazard damage. Overall, Meganium is not too much of a threat as long as you don't let it rack up too much passive damage, but if Aromatherapy heals a sweeper that was neutered by status, be sure to watch out for it.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With the ability to take both physical and special hits somewhat well combined with the ability to support its team via healing status effects and phazing, Meganium has what it takes to be a good supporter for its team. Aromatherapy lets Meganium cure its team of status, possibly giving teammates a second chance if they were crippled by it. It also ensures Meganium is not worn down by Toxic, which would ruin its staying power otherwise. Dragon Tail allows Meganium to phaze opponents, and it works well with entry hazards in order to rack up damage. Phazing also prevents Meganium from being setup fodder for sweepers unless they are using Substitute. Giga Drain is Meganium's STAB move of choice and lets Meganium keep itself healthy while damaging foes such as Kabutops. For the final slot, Synthesis provides useful instant recovery to let Meganium last longer, but Toxic is a viable alternative in order to wear down other Pokemon.</p> <p>A specially defensive spread is chosen in order to allow Meganium to take moves such as Scald and Volt Switch better, as well as an Ice coverage move if the need arises. Although Meganium's Dragon Tail suffers from a Calm nature, avoiding this is not worth lowering Meganium's surprisingly decent Speed stat that can allow it to use Aromatherapy in a pinch, and the amount of damage dealt with Dragon Tail is not overly important as it is not meant to hit very hard in the first place and struggles to break Substitutes regardless. A physically defensive nature is usable to sponge Earthquakes and Waterfalls more easily, but as most of Meganium's resistances are primarily used as special attacks, a corresponding EV spread comes in handy more often. There are other moves worth considering that can occasionally come in handy. Leech Seed is always a cool option in order to wear down the foe while getting recovery, but unfortunately, Dragon Tail cancels this effect. Meganium can also support its team via dual screens, but as that means giving up Aromatherapy, Dragon Tail, or Giga Drain, it can be tough to fit both moves onto Meganium. Finally, Grass Whistle has the reward of inflicting the always-useful sleep, but its poor accuracy makes it risky, and there are many sleep absorbers that already get free switches into Meganium.</p> <p>As Dragon Tail itself isn't the most powerful attack, entry hazard support is useful as the passive damage makes phazing much more devastating. Toxic Spikes in particular can be very useful as it allows Meganium to run Synthesis over Toxic without any problems. As a result, Qwilfish makes a very good partner, as it is an effective dual Spiker and can take Bug and Fire moves that might be directed at Meganium. Defensive Omastar can play a similar role, except it doesn't resist Bug. It does, however, get access to Stealth Rock to wear down Fire-type switch-ins. Alomomola and Poliwrath can also switch into Fire attacks and provide support for Meganium; Alomomola can provide Wish support, which helps Meganium if it's running Toxic and, as a result, has no instant recovery. Poliwrath can switch into Durant and Escavalier without much of a problem, and can also provide additional phazing via Circle Throw. Poliwrath also appreciates Aromatherapy support to make its typical RestTalk strategy more reliable. Finally, Escavalier and Durant cover many of Meganium's weaknesses and can usually destroy some of Meganium's common checks, such as Amoonguss, Cryogonal, and Roselia. Both also become utterly useless if inflicted with a burn (and for Durant, paralysis as well), so they appreciate Aromatherapy giving them a second chance. Note that the two weaknesses Bug and Steel do not cover, Flying and Fire, can be worn down by Stealth Rock, and Flying STAB moves are uncommon in RU.</p> "

  "Typhlosion": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier occupied by powerful Fire-types such as Entei and Moltres, Typhlosion naturally has a bit of trouble finding a place on a team. Sporting the same well-rounded statistics as its brethren, Typhlosion is by no means frail, although a weakness to Stealth Rock and several common attacking types detract from this. However, Typhlosion has a few aces up its sleeve that allow it to distinguish itself from its fellow Fire-types. Its movepool holds some hidden gems, including the potent Eruption, which offers Typhlosion a much-needed powerful STAB attack. Of course, that's not to say that Typhlosion is weak by any means. A high base 109 Special Attack supported by a respectable base 100 Speed allows Typhlosion to hit hard and fast and lends it to serving as a powerful Choice item user, among other options. While certainly no one-man army, a properly supported Typhlosion is capable of laying all manner of destruction in its wake.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With most of its attacking options restricted to what's already been stated, Typhlosion's remaining possibilities are quite sparse. Substitute can be utilized to minimize prediction and get down to Blaze range more safely, although aside from this it accomplishes very little in terms of surmounting Typhlosion's standard set of checks and counters. Will-O-Wisp is a neat option capable of safely crippling a handful of Typhlosion's common switch-ins, although there is rarely a time where Typhlosion wouldn't rather be attacking outright. With access to a couple of physical moves such as Earthquake and Wild Charge, Typhlosion can overcome select counters such as Slowking and Lanturn with proper prediction, although in the end the same can be accomplished with Choice Specs and the same prediction abilities without starkly reducing Typhlosion's overall usefulness.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As one would imagine, entry hazards, notably Stealth Rock, are Typhlosion's undisputed bane, ruining its Eruption and generally wearing it down before it can accomplish much. Regirock and its high Special Defense can take a few Eruptions, setting up Stealth Rock in the process. Bulky Altaria can shrug off Eruptions as well and recover the damage through Roost, though it must be careful of Hidden Power Rock. Moreover, bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Lanturn take very little from all but Choice Specs Hidden Power Grass and Solar Beam and can cripple it with paralysis in return. Additionally, regardless of variant, priority, such as Kabutops's Aqua Jet and Entei's Extreme Speed, keeps Typhlosion in check throughout the match. In more specific cases, the Choice Scarf set can be managed by defensively oriented Pokemon such as Druddigon and Clefable, which take very little damage from all but the inaccurate Focus Blast. In a similar vein, naturally bulky Pokemon such as Gallade can take any given hit and hit back hard in return. While Choice Specs has a few less conventional counters, it is much more vulnerable to being revenge killed, with Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Galvantula, and Scolipede being capable of outpacing and knocking it out.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Whilst wielding Choice Specs, Typhlosion becomes one of the most dangerous immediate special attackers in the tier. A maximum power Eruption being fired off 475 Special Attack is nothing to scoff at; it's even capable of beating bulky Pokemon such as Druddigon and Poliwrath with Stealth Rock in play. Of course, while ideal, Typhlosion can't always remain at full HP, so Fire Blast ensures that it retains a usable STAB move outside of such a scenario. Additionally, when Typhlosion is worn down enough, Blaze can supplement Fire Blast's power to the point where the drop in Base Power is almost unnoticeable. Focus Blast offers respectable neutral coverage alongside Typhlosion's Fire-type attacks, hitting Rock-types and dedicated special walls such as Clefable and Regirock for super effective damage. Lastly, Hidden Power allows Typhlosion to round off its coverage or even reinforce it. Hidden Power Grass hits bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Lanturn hard while offering a more accurate method to hit Rock-types. Hidden Power Rock hits Fire-types for super effective damage, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Entei hard as it tries to switch in.</p> <p>Considering the fact that Choice Specs Typhlosion excels against slower, bulkier teams, a Modest nature is not out of the question, allowing it to push through defensive Pokemon more efficiently. However, when doing so, Typhlosion is outsped by Pokemon such as Moltres, Rotom, and Lilligant, and risks a Speed tie with Adamant Entei, and this should be taken into account when doing so. Even so, a Timid nature is usually more than enough, as can be observed in its damage:</p> <ul> <li>Eruption vs. 4/0 Kabutops 41.6 - 48.85% <li>Eruption vs. 4/0 Entei 55.25 - 65.22%</li> <li>Eruption vs. 4/0 Moltres 57.94 - 68.22%</li> <li>Eruption vs. 252/4 Poliwrath 45.83 - 53.9%</li> <li>Eruption vs. 252/0 Druddigon 49.44 - 58.37%</li> </ul> <p>Flamethrower is an available option over Fire Blast, the choice boiling down to the long-standing power versus accuracy debate.</p> <p>More so than most of its Fire-type brethren, Typhlosion needs Rapid Spin support to function, ensuring the most powerful Eruption possible. Kabutops stands out as a natural partner, maintaining a solid offensive presence while reliably spinning, with each appreciating the other's ability to lure in bulky-Water-types and wear them down. Moreover, Kabutops lures in bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth, which Typhlosion can in turn threaten with its STAB attacks. As Typhlosion is hard-pressed to outpace faster teams, paralysis support can help Typhlosion burn through teams. Rotom-C and Ferroseed both make solid partners in this right, covering up Typhlosion's weaknesses well, with the former being able to maintain offensive momentum with Volt Switch and the latter being able to set up hazards on an assortment of Pokemon Typhlosion lures in.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Though inferior to the Choice Specs set, with access to a powerful STAB Eruption and strong offensive stats, Choice Scarf Typhlosion makes for a useful revenge killer and late-game sweeper. Eruption is naturally the crux of the set, allowing Typhlosion to hit everything that doesn't resist it for respectable damage. Of course, Fire Blast's consistent damage remains important to Typhlosion's success, allowing it to perform even at low HP. Focus Blast offers respectable neutral coverage alongside Typhlosion's STAB moves, punishing Rock-types such as Kabutops and Omastar should they try to switch in on a predicted Fire-type attack. Hidden Power Rock rounds off Typhlosion's coverage, allowing it to hit Fire-type Pokemon hard, as well as allowing Typhlosion to consistently knock out incoming Aerodactyl. It should be noted, though, that it doesn't hit nearly as hard as the Choice Specs set, and will thus get worn down much more easily by entry hazards due to the need to switch out more often.</p> <p>A Modest nature can be utilized to hit harder, although losing the ability to outpace Timid Lilligant after a Quiver Dance is pretty detrimental to Typhlosion's ability as a revenge killer. In terms of alternative moves, Flamethrower offers a more accurate option to Fire Blast, although without an item boosting its Special Attack, Typhlosion really appreciates the extra power. Hidden Power Grass can be utilized over Hidden Power Rock to hit bulky Water-types hard, but it should be noted that targets such as Slowking and Lanturn need to be worn down quite significantly before being threatened by this move.</p> <p>In order to retain Typhlosion's HP and Eruption's power, a Rapid Spin user is necessary to Typhlosion's success. Kabutops and Cryogonal are both apt partners for the task. Because it lacks the immediate power to break through bulky resistances, Typhlosion thoroughly appreciates dedicated hazard support to wear down bulky Water- and Dragon-types that switch into it. Ferroseed, Druddigon, and Qwilfish all make solid examples of such partners, setting up Stealth Rock or Spikes on common Typhlosion checks. However, certain dedicated special walls such as Slowking are capable of walling Typhlosion even with hazard support, making powerful Pursuit users such as Escavalier and Spiritomb good partners for trapping such threats.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While often seen utilizing a Choice item, by utilizing Sunny Day, Typhlosion can put holes in some of its more conventional checks and counters, while also supporting Sunny Day teams. Fire Blast offers Typhlosion a powerful STAB attack that gets further boosted by the presence of sun, even dealing respectable damage to Pokemon such as Druddigon. Common switch-ins to Typhlosion, such as Slowking and Lanturn, find the tables turned as their Water-type STAB moves are reduced in power, and Typhlosion can respond with a powerful Solar Beam. Hidden Power Rock ties everything together, allowing Typhlosion to hit opposing Fire-types hard, preventing Pokemon such as Moltres from burning turns of Sunny Day (pun intended).</p> <p>Flamethrower can be utilized in the place of Fire Blast for a STAB move, should accuracy be more important than extra power. Heat Rock is an option over Life Orb and allows Typhlosion to prolong the Sunny Day for an additional 3 turns, although the drop in power is very noticeable when met with Pokemon such as Slowking and Druddigon. Due to the nature of the set, Chlorophyll sweepers such as Victreebel and Sawsbuck are excellent partners for Typhlosion, taking advantage of the Sunny Day by setting up and wearing down each other's prospective checks and counters. Sunny Day supporters such as Uxie and Regirock both present solid support for Typhlosion, offering not only respectable checks to opposing Fire-types, but also Stealth Rock and Sunny Day, allowing Typhlosion to sweep more effectively. Rapid Spin support is obviously thoroughly appreciated for keeping Typhlosion alive and kicking, making Cryogonal an excellent partner, being immune to Ground-type attacks aimed at Typhlosion and capable of threatening Dragon-types with it's STAB Ice Beam, while providing the obvious Rapid Spin support.</p> "

  "Feraligatr": {
    "overview": "<p>The big boss alligator is here in the form of Feraligatr, one of the more fearsome Pokemon in RU. Wielding dual setup moves in Swords Dance and Dragon Dance along with a solid movepool to make use of them makes Feraligatr an incredibly effective sweeper. Powerful priority in Aqua Jet combined with stellar coverage options in Superpower, Crunch, and Ice Punch make both the Swords Dance and Dragon Dance sets very efficient as well as difficult to wall or revenge kill effectively, especially with a Torrent boost. Despite Feraligatr's solid offensive prowess, it does have a few issues. Choice Scarf users that resist Aqua Jet, such as Rotom-C, can effectively revenge kill Feraligatr with relative ease, whereas bulky Grass- and Water-types, such as Tangrowth and Slowking, are able to wall it depending on Feraligatr's coverage moves of choice. In addition, Feraligatr faces stiff competition as a Swords Dance user from the more powerful Kabutops, and competes with Crawdaunt as a Dragon Dance user. Nevertheless, Feraligatr is a significant offensive threat in the RU metagame.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Like any offensive Pokemon, Feraligatr can use Substitute to block status and set up in the face of defensive Pokemon such as Ferroseed and RestTalk Poliwrath. The problem is that the recoil damage from Substitute and Life Orb together cut Feraligatr's lifespan dramatically. Switching Feraligatr's item to Leftovers would help counteract Substitute's HP cost, but Feraligatr relies heavily on Life Orb for its KOs; without that extra power, it would rarely be able to sweep without gathering multiple boosts. Lum Berry is another option to protect Feraligatr from status, but Life Orb is simply more reliable if you want to sweep.</p> <p>Aqua Tail is a slightly more powerful STAB attack, but Waterfall's perfect accuracy and useful flinch rate are hard to pass up. Superpower is Feraligatr's best option against Ferroseed, but its stat-reducing effect makes it a poor option on a boosting sweeper. Superpower would fit nicely on a Choice Band set, though, along with Waterfall, Aqua Jet, and Ice Punch or Crunch. Rock Slide and Dragon Claw round out Feraligatr's physical movepool, but they don't offer any significant additional coverage. If you're tired of Tangrowth ruining Feraligatr's sweeps, Ice Beam will always 2HKO it, even with a Special Attack-hindering nature. Venturing into the land of the insane, a Choice Specs set would be a fantastic lure for Tangrowth, and Choice Specs Hydro Pump is statistically Feraligatr's strongest viable unboosted attack thanks to its high Base Power. Feraligatr has the bulk and typing to be a passable defensive bulky Water-type, but its support movepool is limited to Toxic, Dragon Tail, and Roar, and it lacks the excellent secondary typing and ability that Pokemon such as Slowking, Qwilfish, Lanturn, and Quagsire enjoy. Stick to using Feraligatr as a deadly physical sweeper; anything else would be a waste.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Tangrowth is the ultimate answer to Feraligatr. Even a +1 Ice Punch will never 2HKO Tangrowth, whereas Tangrowth always OHKOes Feraligatr with Power Whip after Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil, or 2HKOes with Giga Drain while recovering most of its HP. Quagsire ignores Feraligatr's boosts thanks to Unaware and takes a maximum of 39% from Waterfall, so it can easily stall Feraligatr out with Toxic and Recover. Ferroseed takes little from any of Feraligatr's attacks even after a boost, and it can cripple Dragon Dance sets with Thunder Wave while siphoning Feraligatr's HP with Leech Seed. Poliwrath is immune to Waterfall and resists Ice Punch and Crunch, so it can take a hit and phaze Feraligatr with Circle Throw. Faster Grass-types such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and Rotom-C are all good switch-ins to Swords Dance sets, while Choice Scarf users with super effective STAB attacks can take out Dragon Dance versions with ease.</p> ",

        "name": "GATR TIME (Swords Dance)",
        "description": "<p>It's Gatr Time! Swords Dance turns Feraligatr into an absolute juggernaut that can both crush walls and wipe out sweepers with ease. Grab that boost at the right moment and then watch with pride as Feraligatr tears the opponent's team apart in just a few turns. With a little bit of residual damage, Aqua Jet OHKOes most of the fast, frail Pokemon that outspeed Feraligatr, including Rotom, Accelgor, Manectric, and Primeape. Meanwhile, Waterfall easily 2HKOes any wall that doesn't resist it, and Feraligatr's solid natural bulk allows it to take a hit from most defensive Pokemon and carry on sweeping. In fact, opponents that try to wear Feraligatr down with weak attacks often hasten their own demise by bringing it into Torrent range; three Torrent-boosted hits from +2 Feraligatr will often translate into three quick KOs. Return is generally the best coverage option, as it hits every common Pokemon that resists Water neutrally, barring Ferroseed. Crunch is also a worthy option for super effective coverage against foes like Slowking and Uxie that could otherwise survive any of Feraligatr's attacks and cripple it with status or powerful special attacks. However, Poliwrath completely walls Feraligatr without Return, and the lower Base Power of Crunch makes it harder for Feraligatr to get past other bulky Pokemon that resist Water, such as Lanturn and Druddigon.</p> <p>Feraligatr sits immediately below the base 80 Speed tier, which means there isn't much benefit to maximizing its Speed. Instead, the best strategy is to fully invest in Attack with an Adamant nature and rely on Aqua Jet to take down faster foes. 152 Speed EVs allow Feraligatr to beat Timid Omastar and Jolly Crawdaunt, but note that this is a common benchmark for Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Uxie, as well as opposing Feraligatr, so throwing in a few extra Speed EVs might be worth your while. Invest the remaining EVs in HP to bolster Feraligatr's above-average bulk.</p> <p>Feraligatr absolutely needs entry hazard support to sweep consistently. Rotom, Manectric, and Galvantula can survive a +2 Aqua Jet from full health and OHKO Feraligatr with their STAB Electric-type attacks, but a single round of Stealth Rock damage turns Aqua Jet into an OHKO on all of them. You will also need to eliminate the opponent's Grass-types before attempting to sweep. Sceptile is physically frail, so Feraligatr can deal with it reasonably well by hitting it with an unboosted Return for 70-80% on the switch, putting it in KO range for a +2 Aqua Jet later in the match. However, bulkier Grass-types, such as Tangrowth, Rotom-C, and Ferroseed, will have to be handled by Feraligatr's teammates. Entei can drive these Pokemon away with Flare Blitz, and Bouffalant can switch in on their STAB moves for a free Attack boost. Alternatively, you can use a lure such as Choice Specs Lanturn to draw in and OHKO Grass-types with Ice Beam or Hidden Power Fire. Once the entry hazards are set up and the Grass-types are out of the way, send Feraligatr in and enjoy the massacre.</p> "

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance sweepers are a rare sight in RU, primarily because all of the best Pokemon with access to such a powerful setup move are perched in higher tiers. For the most part, those that have fallen to RU are poor sweepers that lack sufficient power (Altaria and Dragonair), Speed (Crawdaunt and Shelgon), or both (Whiscash). Feraligatr is the exception to this rule; a single Dragon Dance gives it enough power to OHKO most offensive Pokemon and enough Speed to beat virtually every unboosted Pokemon in the tier. Unfortunately, a +1 Attack boost isn't enough for Feraligatr to break through RU's sturdiest walls, and most Choice Scarf users will outspeed it even after a Dragon Dance, so this Feraligatr is generally easier to stop than the Swords Dance variant. On the other hand, the Speed boost and additional coverage this set brings to the table help Feraligatr defeat some of its most common switch-ins, and it is still a capable sweeper, especially if it can grab a second boost.</p> <p>Waterfall is the STAB move of choice thanks to its perfect accuracy, respectable Base Power, and handy flinch rate. Ice Punch covers Grass- and Dragon-types, allowing Feraligatr to beat some of the best counters to its Swords Dance set; after a Dragon Dance, Feraligatr outspeeds and OHKOes Sceptile, Lilligant, and Rotom-C with Ice Punch. In the last slot, Earthquake offers the best overall coverage, OHKOing Lanturn and Drapion, 2HKOing Qwilfish through Intimidate, and hitting Slowking, Poliwrath, and Ferroseed for neutral damage. However, Crunch is a notable alternative for extra power against Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Dusknoir, Slowking, and Uxie, which can ruin Feraligatr's sweep with paralysis or a burn.</p> <p>A simple offensive EV spread is the way to go, but choosing the best nature is more difficult. Jolly Feraligatr reaches 420 Speed after a boost, putting it ahead of neutral-natured Choice Scarf users with base 90 Speed or less, such as Modest Moltres, Modest Rotom-C, and Adamant Medicham, as well as every unboosted Pokemon not named Accelgor or Ninjask. While that extra Speed can potentially save Feraligatr from being revenge killed, trying to figure out mid-battle which nature your opponent chose for its Choice Scarf Rotom-C is a dangerous game that you should avoid playing whenever possible. Opting for an Adamant nature sidesteps the guessing game entirely; you give up any shot at outspeeding most Choice Scarf users (and Aerodactyl), but the extra power nets some additional OHKOs against Pokemon that would barely survive a +1 attack from Jolly Feraligatr, including bulky Gallade, bulky Rotom-C, Scolipede, and Druddigon.</p> <p>As was alluded to earlier, there are several Pokemon that can easily prevent Feraligatr from sweeping. Choice Scarf Electric-types are the quickest answer; Manectric, Galvantula, and Timid Rotom-C will always outspeed a boosted Feraligatr and can OHKO it with their STAB moves, although they can't safely switch into its attacks. A Ground-type such as Quagsire or Steelix can help shut them down. Poliwrath can take a hit and phaze Feraligatr with Circle Throw, while Quagsire ignores Feraligatr's boosts and can stall it out with Toxic and Recover, so a Grass-type attacking partner such as Sceptile or Rotom-C is a good teammate. Feraligatr also has no chance of getting past Tangrowth or Ferroseed on its own, so you would be wise to bring a powerful Fire-type, such as Entei or Moltres. Life Orb Manectric is a particularly nice partner for Feraligatr, as its Lightningrod ability allows it to switch in on Thunderbolt or Volt Switch for a free power boost, and it can take out Poliwrath, Quagsire, and Tangrowth with Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass, and Flamethrower, respectively.</p> "

  "Hitmonlee": {
    "overview": "<p>Hitmonlee at first glance might look like a simple Fighting-type Pokemon, but there are things that Hitmonlee is capable of doing well compared to its competition. Its base 120 Attack is wonderful, and is above average compared to other Fighting-types, and unlike most other powerful Fighting-types, it also has a very useful Speed stat, which allows it to outspeed threats such as Rotom-C, Gallade, Magmortar, and Kabutops. Hitmonlee also has a good offensive movepool to utilize, including its powerful STAB and coverage options such as Earthquake and Sucker Punch, as well as two great abilities in Reckless, which makes its High Jump Kick hit incredibly hard, and Unburden, which makes it one of the best late-game sweepers available to use in RU. However, Hitmonlee has a few major flaws. Although it has impressive coverage, it is fairly helpless against Psychic- and Ghost-types, especially considering that hitting Ghosts with High Jump Kick causes a lot of recoil damage. Hitmonlee is also extremely frail on the physical side, making it very vulnerable to priority moves and hard to switch in.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hitmonlee has access to, for some reason, Rapid Spin. Although Rapid Spin is useful for obvious reasons, Hitmonlee is already extremely vulnerable to Ghost-types as it is, meaning that if it decides to use Rapid Spin it will likely end up extremely weakened or burned. There are far more reliable spinners in the tier that are capable of defeating most Ghost-types with ease, particularly Kabutops. Hitmonlee can use a Choice Scarf to revenge kill foes with a Reckless High Jump Kick, which OHKOes even healthy foes, but Medicham's higher Attack, Trick, and Hitmonlee already having Unburden make this set not worth it. A Choice Band set also features similar competition with Medicham, especially considering Hitmonlee's coverage makes it threatening. Considering Hitmonlee is vulnerable to paralysis, it could use Limber to prevent this. Although it's a good ability, it is ultimately less useful than Unburden or Reckless. Return is a bit stronger against Psychic-types than Stone Edge, as well as more accurate, but Hitmonlee isn't defeating most Psychic-types in the first place. Blaze Kick hits Amoonguss harder than anything else Hitmonlee has, but doesn't offer anything else.</p> <p>Pursuit is usually a good option for trapping Ghost- and Psychic-types, but there is rarely an instance where these Pokemon will be switching out from Hitmonlee, as most Pokemon of this type are Hitmonlee's best counters. Bulk Up is Hitmonlee's only setup move, and Hitmonlee has a decent special bulk to use along with it. However, Gallade's access to Drain Punch and an even better special bulk make Bulk Up outclassed in this regard. Finally, there are many interesting strategies to activate Unburden, such as using a Lum Berry to cure status, a ChestoRest strategy, activating a Focus Sash as a lead, or even using Fling and a heavy item to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types with a super effective attack. However, these strategies are somewhat gimmicky and you can never guarantee Unburden will activate for various reasons.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Without resistances to its STAB moves, Hitmonlee is tough to deal with, especially considering Unburden makes revenge killing it difficult. Fortunately, the Pokemon that wall Hitmonlee do so extremely well. Ghost-types are among the best counters, being immune to its Fighting STAB and not being weak to anything Hitmonlee has other than Sucker Punch. Misdreavus, Rotom, and Spiritomb are good Ghost-types, and can all use Will-O-Wisp to make Hitmonlee much weaker and then hit it hard with their STAB moves. Golurk doesn't have Will-O-Wisp and is a bit vulnerable to Sucker Punch, but it easily OHKOes Hitmonlee with a STAB move of its own. Psychic-types such as Slowking and Uxie also wall Hitmonlee fairly well, and can hit back with their STAB moves or paralyze it, though be warned that a Reckless-boosted Double-Edge can leave its mark. Alomomola can easily wear Hitmonlee down thanks to its high physical bulk, Regenerator, and Wish, and Hitmonlee's low bulk means that Waterfall hurts somewhat badly. Although rare, Weezing almost completely walls Hitmonlee thanks to its typing, Levitate, and Will-O-Wisp. Poliwrath has good physical bulk and can phaze Hitmonlee out of its Unburden boost by hitting it with Circle Throw, although note that a Reckless-boosted High Jump Kick hurt too badly for Poliwrath to deal with. Scolipede performs well against any Reckless variant thanks to its 4x resistance to Fighting and can OHKO Hitmonlee with Earthquake after Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil, although it must be careful about Stone Edge. Hitmonlee's extremely low physical bulk makes it easy to KO with priority moves. Entei will always outspeed and OHKO Hitmonlee with Extreme Speed thanks to its +2 priority, and other Pokemon can hit it with a STAB priority move of their own as long as they aren't weak to Mach Punch, such as Feraligatr.</p> ",

        "name": "Unburden",
        "description": "<p>Although Hitmonlee is relatively fast, it can still find itself outpaced by many Pokemon, and it also can easily be revenge killed by Choice Scarf users due to its low bulk. However, it can fix these problems with Unburden, which raises its Speed to 546 and allows it to outrun practically every Pokemon in the metagame, including all relevant Choice Scarf users. Be sure not to activate Unburden too early within the match, because there are usually many Pokemon that need to be eliminated before Hitmonlee can clean up, particularly Ghost-types, Psychic-types, and priority users.</p> <p>Although Close Combat is the weaker of the two STABs Hitmonlee has available, it has perfect accuracy and is not lacking in power by any means, while the defense drops from the move are rather irrelevant because Hitmonlee won't get outsped and will get defeated by priority regardless because of its frailty. High Jump Kick offers a bit more power, but its 90% accuracy can ruin the chance of a late-game sweep. Stone Edge covers Flying-type Pokemon and also hits bulky Pokemon such as Rotom or Uxie harder than anything else Hitmonlee has. Although a priority move may seem useless with Unburden, it can still be useful for activating the ability. Mach Punch is preferred for this slot, as a Fighting Gem-boosted Mach Punch can finish off faster foes, and after Unburden activates, it can help Hitmonlee avoid getting hit by other priority moves. If you really need to activate Unburden, Fake Out with a Normal Gem guarantees the foe cannot strike unless it is a Ghost-type. However, be warned that this pretty much takes your item slot away, removing Hitmonlee's boosts on its main attacks. For the last filler slot, Return hits Psychic-types harder than any of Hitmonlee's other moves, while Earthquake hits Qwilfish hard, although neither do that much to their respective targets.</p> <p>The item choice depends on the priority move. A Fighting Gem is generally more useful, because that way Mach Punch or the main STAB can activate Unburden. However, as mentioned, if Fake Out is used, a Normal Gem will ensure that the move activates Unburden. You could use other odd Gems to activate Unburden, such as a Ground Gem to power up Earthquake and hit targets such as Qwilfish for a ton of damage, and let Hitmonlee use its STAB moves early-game to try and avoid activating Unburden too early, but you must be sure that you will consistently be using the move that activates the Gem. Adamant is preferred because Hitmonlee will outspeed anything that isn't an unconventional Choice Scarf user—it outspeeds even Choice Scarf Cinccino.</p> <p>Before Hitmonlee starts sweeping, Psychic- and Ghost-types need to be removed, as Hitmonlee cannot hit most of them very hard. Due to this, Absol, Spiritomb, and Drapion make good partners, as they have both Pursuit and alternative STAB options to take them down. There also exist many Poison-types in RU that do not take very much damage from Earthquake, such as Amoonguss and Qwilfish, that can stop Hitmonlee's sweep. Sigilyph can take down both of them or set up as they flee. Hitmonlee can also switch into Dark attacks that may be targeted at Psychic-types and has Mach Punch to bypass possible Sucker Punches. Finally, as almost all priority murders Hitmonlee if it cannot finish off the foe with Mach Punch, Alomomola makes a good partner, as it makes a great switch into physical attacks, most notably Entei, which packs Extreme Speed.</p> "

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>Even when compared to other Fighting-types, this set boasts a lot of power and coverage. Hitmonlee's oft overlooked ability, Reckless, boosts some of Hitmonlee's moves, including High Jump Kick, making it very difficult to switch into. While Medicham is more powerful, even with Reckless factored in, Hitmonlee's Speed stat is higher and it arguably has better coverage. Factoring in the STAB boost and Reckless, High Jump Kick hits a whopping 234 Base Power, which is so powerful that it 2HKOes 252/252+ Tangrowth after Stealth Rock! Because Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick is so powerful, coverage moves will generally do less damage even factoring in super effective damage. Sucker Punch is a fairly strong priority move Hitmonlee can use, and it can also hit Psychic-types hard if they decide to attack Hitmonlee. Mach Punch is an alternative priority, as it is more reliable and gets a STAB boost, though it doesn't offer extra coverage. Double-Edge is also boosted by Reckless, and with 144 Base Power after the boost, it gets a strong neutral hit on Pokemon such as Slowking and Uxie. Stone Edge can be used instead to hit Flying-types and Rotom hard, but beware that most of these Pokemon outpace Hitmonlee. Finally, Earthquake hits Poison-types such as Qwilfish for super effective damage that would generally be able to take a High Jump Kick relatively well.</p> <p>Although this set emphasizes power, a Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed many Pokemon, including non-Choice Scarf Rotom-C, Timid Magmortar, and Jolly Kabutops. However, as most of these Pokemon generally run either Choice Scarf or non-boosting natures, an Adamant nature can be used for more power. Close Combat can be used as the main STAB, but in this case, the power drop is very noticeable thanks to Reckless boosting High Jump Kick to nearly unmatched levels of power.</p> <p>Hitmonlee desperately needs to get rid of Ghost-types, as not only can Hitmonlee generally not hit them hard, but using High Jump Kick on them makes Hitmonlee lose half of its health and easy to finish off. Due to this, Pursuit support from the likes of Drapion or Absol can finish off these Ghosts even if they switch out. Dark-types also take care of Psychic-types in a similar fashion, a type that gives Hitmonlee similar problems. Although Hitmonlee can use Stone Edge, most Flying-types remain faster than Hitmonlee, can switch into its Fighting STAB, and threaten it with a STAB of their own. Lanturn makes a good partner, as it resists Flying-type moves and also can take Moltres's and Sigilyph's coverage moves well due to its typing and great Special Defense. Hitmonlee takes tons of recoil damage from its moves and has a low HP stat, so Wish support can be helpful, provided you can find a moment to switch Hitmonlee back in. Clefable knows Wish and is immune to Ghost-type attacks as well as damage from burns. Both Clefable and the aforementioned Lanturn also know Heal Bell, which Hitmonlee appreciates due to how susceptible it is to status moves.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Although a combination of Endure and a Berry looks very out of date, Hitmonlee's unique traits, including Unburden, means it does not have to rely on a Salac Berry to outpace its foes. After a boost from Unburden and Liechi Berry, Hitmonlee becomes a very fearsome sweeper. With the boost from Liechi Berry, it reaches a staggering 558 Attack, meaning Hitmonlee can hit anything it faces hard. Not only this, but after an Unburden boost, Hitmonlee hits 546 Speed, which is good enough to outspeed everything unboosted in RU and every relevant Choice Scarf Pokemon as well. Endure pairs well with Unburden and Liechi Berry because it allows Hitmonlee to survive an attack that would normally KO it with 1 HP, gain both boosts, and proceed to sweep with a STAB 200 Base Power Reversal.</p> <p>Because of how hard Reversal hits, the only time its coverage moves will see usage is both when they hit a Pokemon for super effective damage and when Reversal is not very effective. Stone Edge gets coverage on Flying-type Pokemon and Earthquake gets coverage on Poison-types. Furthermore, the combination of these three moves hits every Pokemon in RU for at least neutral damage. However, due to Poison-types not being overly common, Mach Punch can be used to potentially finish off priority users such as Kabutops, though note that it may not KO the opponent unless it is super effective or the opponent has a bit of prior damage.</p> <p>Although this particular Hitmonlee can be extremely hard to stop, because Hitmonlee is stuck at 1 HP, opponents that can survive a hit pose huge threats to this set. Many of these Pokemon, such as Uxie, Spiritomb, and Slowking, can be taken down with Dark-type support from the likes of Drapion or Absol, as they can hit them when they switch with Pursuit or hit them hard if they decide to stay in with a different Dark STAB. Priority moves destroy this set, as even with Mach Punch there is no guarantee that Hitmonlee will be able to OHKO them. Alomomola makes a great partner due to this, being able to take on priority moves well thanks to its excellent physical bulk, especially Entei which packs Extreme Speed. Finally, if Hitmonlee ever has to switch out, Rapid Spin support is needed to ensure that it won't be immediately taken out upon switching back in. Kabutops makes a great partner, as it can also take on Entei well and can defeat all spinblockers in RU with ease.</p> "

  "Hitmonchan": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier filled with many viable Fighting-type Pokemon, Hitmonchan struggles to stand out. Hitmonchan often finds itself weaker, slower, or frailer than other Fighting-types, and in some cases all three. It is also flawed as a Rapid Spin user, as it cannot handle spinblockers very well unlike the usually superior option, Kabutops. Hitmonchan also doesn't have any tricks up its sleeve to get past Psychic- and Ghost-types like some other Fighting-types; with these things in mind, it might seem like Hitmonchan has nothing going for it.</p> <p>Despite generally lacking in stats, and to an extent in movepool, Hitmonchan does have a small niche provided by Iron Fist. It has access to a very wide array of punching moves, including the rare Mach Punch and the elemental punches, a trait only shared by Gurdurr. Due to this, its coverage moves hit harder than its competition, and Mach Punch, a move most other Fighting-types lack, can revenge kill a large number of threats, especially those that are weak to it. Overall, always consider your other options before using Hitmonchan, but don't discount it completely, as it might be just what you are looking for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Most of what Hitmonchan has access to is used better by something else. Hitmonchan can run a set with Rapid Spin and Foresight, guaranteeing a spin. However, such a set has numerous problems: Hitmonchan has four-moveslot syndrome, lacks good resistances, has a mediocre physical bulk even when invested, does poorly against Ghost-types already, and most Ghost-types are unable to defeat Kabutops, another Rapid Spin user. Hitmonchan learns Agility, which can allow it to sweep late-game, but Hitmonlee has a much easier time doubling its Speed thanks to Unburden, which allows it to attack and set up in the same turn. SubPunch is an interesting option on Hitmonchan, considering Focus Punch is boosted via Iron Fist, raising the power of the move to near-unmatched levels, but there are not very many cases where Hitmonchan will be able to keep the Substitute up, and it doesn't beat any additional Pokemon with Focus Punch. Bulk Up is mostly outclassed by Gallade due to higher stats in almost every area; although Mach Punch gives Hitmonchan a slight advantage, it is not enough to make it worth using over Gallade. Stone Edge can nail Flying-types a bit harder than Thunder Punch while also hitting Fire-types hard, but Hitmonchan already either easily defeats or flat-out loses to all of the Flying-types in RU, and Stone Edge does not alleviate this fact. High Jump Kick is stronger than even Close Combat, but the side effect is very undesirable, and it isn't that much more powerful. Finally, Hitmonchan has access to Bullet Punch and Fake Out, but Bullet Punch has redundant coverage with Mach Punch, and Fake Out can become a waste of space considering that its damage output is fairly low.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Just like other Fighting-types, Hitmonchan struggles against Ghost-type Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Rotom, which are immune to Hitmonchan's Fighting moves, can burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and then proceed to wear it down with repeated Shadow Balls. Psychic-types, such as Uxie or Mesprit, are similar cases, since even though they are not immune to Fighting-moves, they still do not take very much damage from them and can hit Hitmonchan hard with their STAB. Flying-types, such as Sigilyph, Moltres, and Scyther, can outspeed and OHKO Hitmonchan with their super effective STAB moves and switch into Fighting moves with ease, but they must watch out for Thunder Punch and Ice Punch. Durant and Galvantula are not weak to anything Hitmonchan commonly carries and can deal a lot of damage with Thunder and Iron Head, respectively, though both must watch out for the rare Fire Punch. Finally, in a general sense, Hitmonchan's stats can work against it in one-on-one situations. Generally, if the foe is a strong physical attacker, is not weak to Mach Punch, and is faster than Hitmonchan, there is a very good chance that the Pokemon can do massive damage to if not OHKO Hitmonchan, with examples including Entei, Gallade, and Choice Scarf Emboar.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>A simple offensive set is the best way to utilize Hitmonchan. Although it might not look very unique at first, access to Iron Fist, a plethora of punching moves that get boosted by said ability, and priority in Mach Punch give it all the advantages that it needs and somewhat make up for its inferior power. Without Psychic- and Ghost-types, Hitmonchan is surprisingly difficult to wall, so it can serve as an effective wallbreaker with its good coverage while keeping faster Pokemon in check with Mach Punch. Drain Punch is the preferred STAB option, as it gets boosted by Iron Fist, making it reach decent levels of power while simultaneously healing off damage taken from Life Orb. Alternatively, Close Combat can be used, as even factoring in Iron Fist it is stronger than Drain Punch. Mach Punch is an important move for Hitmonchan, as it is one of the few Pokemon that can learn the move, allowing it to finish off or revenge kill foes weak to it; for example, it almost always OHKOes Sawsbuck and Crawdaunt after Stealth Rock damage. Thunder Punch allows Hitmonchan to 2HKO bulky Water-types, such as Poliwrath and Slowking, and it can also hit Flying-types hard on the switch. Ice Punch is preferred for the final slot, getting good coverage with Thunder Punch to form a pseudo BoltBeam combination and hitting Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Druddigon, and Amoonguss for super effective damage. However, Hitmonchan could instead use Rapid Spin in this slot, as it allows Hitmonchan to rid the field of hazards, though this is at the expense of losing coverage. Keep in mind though that it loses to all relevant spinblockers, so only use it in case space cannot be made on your team for the few other Rapid Spin users in the tier and Hitmonchan's other traits are needed.</p> <p>Hitmonchan should always run maximum Attack and Speed with an Adamant nature, as it needs all the power it can get and needs to outpace Absol, as Mach Punch will then make Sucker Punch fail, which can do a lot of damage despite the resistance it has. A Life Orb is preferred simply because it offers more power, and Drain Punch mitigates the recoil damage from the item anyways. Fire Punch can be used over one of Hitmonchan's coverage moves, and is notable for getting past Bug-types such as Escavalier and Galvantula, but space is fairly limited on this set and Fire Punch doesn't offer as much offensive coverage as the other moves that Hitmonchan typically uses.</p> <p>Like almost every other Fighting-type in the metagame, Hitmonchan struggles a lot against Ghost- and Psychic-type Pokemon, having nothing in its movepool that can be used to defeat them reliably. Due to this, Pursuit support from the likes of Absol, Spiritomb, and Escavalier is a good idea, as it can trap them or hit them with a stronger move if they decide to stay in. In addition, if Ghost-types are eliminated, Hitmonchan can use Rapid Spin more freely. If Hitmonchan is running Rapid Spin, Fire-types, such as Moltres and Entei, also make good partners, as they appreciate the lack of entry hazards on the field and can switch into Will-O-Wisps from the Ghost-types that carry them. They also offer the ability to destroy said Ghost-types as well as the Bug-types that resist Hitmonchan's STAB moves. Hitmonchan is easily taken out by STAB Flying-type moves from the likes of Moltres and Sigilyph, making Lanturn a good partner since it resists Flying and has the bulk to take all their other moves, while Heal Bell can cure Hitmonchan of troubling statuses, most of which severely cripple Hitmonchan. Although Archeops stands a chance at beating Lanturn with Earthquake, Hitmonchan can hit Archeops hard with any of its moves, so the likelihood of one directly threatening Hitmonchan is rare.</p> "

  "Sceptile": {
    "overview": "<p>Sceptile is widely regarded as one of the best offensive Pokemon in RU. This is largely due to its nearly unmatched Speed, above-average Special Attack, and useful Grass typing. Additionally, unlike most Grass-types, Sceptile actually has access to a coverage move not named Hidden Power in the form of Focus Blast, which it can use to hit Steel-types and various Sap Sipper Pokemon. This also means that Sceptile is free to run a different Hidden Power that gives it coverage on Fire-types, such as Hidden Power Rock. On top of that, Sceptile can also take you by surprise by attacking from the physical side with a very dangerous Swords Dance set. It's not all peaches for Sceptile though, as its subpar Defense and average Special Defense make it quite vulnerable to priority and only let it get so far. Nevertheless, when used correctly, Sceptile is hands down one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier and is sure to leave its mark in any battle it takes part in.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sceptile has access to a few other moves that have not been covered in the above sets but may prove to be useful if your team is in need of such support. Grass Whistle, despite its unreliable accuracy, can be used to put an opposing Pokemon out of commission--often permanently thanks to BW's sleep mechanics. Endeavor may also be considered, with Sceptile using its blazing Speed to cripple something just before it goes down. A Sunny Day + Solar Beam set with Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast as coverage can also be used, but most of the time Sceptile will find itself missing the additional power Leaf Storm provides or being unable to set up and stay in a second turn to attack. Another option for Sceptile is to take advantage of both its offenses and go mixed. This, however, would require it to split its EVs, something that it is not keen on doing. A specially-based Unburden set with Grass Gem is also viable, but Sceptile is usually fast enough as it is and Life Orb brings more consistent results. Finally, White Herb may be used to provide Sceptile with the ability to fire off two consecutive, full-powered Leaf Storms, but this can prove to be a very situational tool.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Straight-up countering Sceptile is impossible due to its versatility and tendency to use different Hidden Powers for coverage. However, if you manage to figure out which Hidden Power type Sceptile is carrying, then the task of countering it becomes much easier--at least as far as special sets are concerned. Roselia and Amoonguss are the safest switch-ins, as they only fear Acrobatics due to their high Special Defense allowing them to take even super effective Hidden Powers and have Poison-type STAB to retaliate with. Altaria is probably the next safest switch-in, as it resists the Grass- and Fighting-type attacks Sceptile commonly carries and doesn't take too much from Hidden Power Rock due to its awesome Special Defense. However, if Sceptile happens to be carrying Hidden Power Ice or is a Swords Dance variant with Rock Slide, Altaria is no good. Similarly, Moltres and Charizard resist every move Sceptile commonly carries, except for Rock-type ones which hit them 4x super effectively. A specially defensive Flareon also works quite well as a counter to the special sets, but the Swords Dance variant will almost certainly be able to OHKO it after setting up. Cryogonal is in a similar boat, but it fears being hit by two consecutive Focus Blasts and will definitely lose to the Swords Dance set. Ferroseed and Pokemon with the ability Sap Sipper, such as Bouffalant and Miltank, also work quite well if Sceptile happens to be lacking Focus Blast--and Hidden Power Fire in the case of the former. Many of the aforementioned Pokemon have a fatal weakness to Stealth Rock though, so you need to be careful. Accelgor, Aerodactyl, and various common Choice Scarf users outpace Sceptile too, so you can always try to deal with it this way; watch out for Unburden sets though.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Substitute + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<p>Arguably Sceptile's most dangerous set, this variant attempts to set up a Substitute on the numerous Pokemon that it can threaten, such as Kabutops, Slowking, and Aggron, and then let its high Speed and Special Attack do the rest. A Substitute does many good things for Sceptile, including allowing it to avoid status conditions, particularly paralysis, evade Sucker Punch, a relatively common priority move that could cause Sceptile issues, and ease prediction if in the case a faster Pokemon, such as Accelgor, or a dangerous Pokemon, such as Escavalier, switches in. However, arguably the best part about a Substitute is that it allows Sceptile to get into Overgrow range almost whenever it wants to. In case it is incapable of doing enough damage to finish off the opponent, Sceptile can repeatedly use a Substitute until it has a low enough HP and then attack with an Overgrow-boosted STAB Giga Drain. Giga Drain can not only heal off the damage from the Substitutes, but it also keeps Sceptile from getting worn down too quickly from its Life Orb and is thus used as its main STAB.</p> <p>The remaining two moves are used for coverage. Focus Blast is a godsend for Sceptile, as it obtains coverage against Steel-type Pokemon and Sap Sipper users such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck. Focus Blast is also Sceptile's strongest option against Pokemon such as Emboar, and in normal situations, it does more damage than Giga Drain (although its shaky accuracy must be considered in these cases). Hidden Power Rock covers Fire-, Bug-, and Flying-types such as Moltres and Sigilyph. Due to Focus Blast, Sceptile, unlike other Grass-types, can afford to run Hidden Power Rock without needing to worry about most of the targets that Hidden Power Fire would otherwise hit.</p> <p>Sceptile should always run maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs with a Timid nature, as it is hard-pressed to take a hit, and a Life Orb is used to hit harder itself. A Life Orb also results in recoil damage, which can help get Sceptile into Overgrow range. There are other Hidden Powers that Sceptile can consider using over Hidden Power Rock. The first of these is Hidden Power Fire, which gets an OHKO on Escavalier, a Pokemon that could otherwise cause problems for Sceptile. Hidden Power Ice is similar, as it gives Sceptile a reliable way to 2HKO Druddigon; Hidden Power Ice also allows Sceptile to run 31 Speed IVs unlike the other two Hidden Power options, which can allow Sceptile to outspeed and OHKO other Sceptile. Both Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ice also hit Amoonguss and Roselia super effectively, but they still don't do that much to either of them. Ultimately, however, Hidden Power Rock is more useful in most situations to deal with Moltres and other similar Pokemon.</p> <p>Amoonguss and other bulky Grass-types are generally problems for Sceptile, even if it runs a super effective Hidden Power. Therefore, strong Fire-type Pokemon such as Entei or Emboar make good partners, as they can OHKO any Grass-type in their path, can take a Megahorn from Escavalier and retaliate, and can act as a sleep absorber if the need arises. Entei can also deal with Accelgor and Cryogonal, two Pokemon that Sceptile might have trouble with. In return, Sceptile can directly switch into and subsequently threaten bulky Water-types, which are common switch-ins to Fire-types. Water-types are also helpful partners, as they can withstand hits from Fire-types that threaten Sceptile, particularly Choice Scarf Emboar and Entei, and they can also KO Aerodactyl, a rather common Pokemon that is faster than Sceptile. Qwilfish is a standout example, as its excellent physical bulk allows it to take many hits, and its access to Spikes helps wear down opponents such as Escavalier and Druddigon so that Sceptile can finish them off more easily. Bringing a Fire- and Water-type also results in a Fire / Water / Grass core, which is rather effective in RU.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Sceptile functions well as an all-out attacker as a result of its high Speed and Special Attack. Although many Sceptile sets have the issue of not running very powerful moves, a STAB Leaf Storm completely alleviates this issue, and because it's nearly twice as strong as Giga Drain, its power is rather terrifying, doing over 50% damage to even bulky special walls such as Clefable. Leaf Storm also does quite a bit of damage to some of Sceptile's offensive checks, with Entei and Druddigon taking about 50% damage from it. Although the side effect will often cause Sceptile to switch out afterwards, the raw power of the move usually means Sceptile should use it unless there is a bulky resist to Leaf Storm on the opposing team. Focus Blast hits Steel-types and Sap Sipper Pokemon such as Bouffalant hard, which might try to switch into Leaf Storm. Hidden Power Rock covers Flying-, Fire-, and Bug-types, particularly Moltres, which packs a 4x resistance to Leaf Storm. Finally, because Sceptile tends to switch out a lot, Giga Drain is an alternative STAB that helps recover HP lost to entry hazards and Life Orb recoil. It also makes a good move to clean up teams with, considering it is accurate and does not have an undesirable side effect.</p> <p>A Life Orb is the preferred item, as it allows Sceptile to switch its moves, and Giga Drain can heal off Life Orb damage. However, Choice Specs is a viable option as well, considering Leaf Storm might make Sceptile a hit-and-run attacker and will therefore not need to switch moves too much. Once again, Hidden Power Ice or Fire are viable options for Druddigon and other Dragon-types or Escavalier and other Grass-types, but Hidden Power Rock is more useful in most situations due to Moltres and other Fire-types being so common and dangerous, as providing a free switch-in for Moltres is generally not a good idea.</p> <p>Sceptile is prone to being revenge killed by Pokemon holding a Choice Scarf, especially the common Emboar. Water-types, such as Kabutops or Slowking, make good switch-ins to Emboar, and although Rapid Spin is not needed, Kabutops might be helpful with its Rapid Spin support if Choice Specs is the chosen item. Water-types also help deal with the naturally faster Aerodactyl, and Kabutops can take a hit from Swellow as well. This particular Sceptile is also prone to being hit by Sucker Punch due to its poor physical bulk and lack of a way to avoid the move. Steelix makes a good partner as a result of this, as it can take on most physical attackers that carry the move, especially Druddigon, which resists Sceptile's STAB. It may also be worth using a Fighting-type such as Hariyama to check Sucker Punch users as an alternative due to Dark-types being weak to their STABs, particularly Absol, which has coverage moves for Steel-types. Finally, because Sceptile is almost completely walled by Amoonguss and Roselia, packing a Fire-type such as Entei or Emboar is a good idea, as they can easily deal with the Grass-types and not be crippled by sleep-inducing moves thanks to Sleep Talk.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>While it may seem odd to let Sceptile's special attacking prowess go to waste by using it as a physical sweeper, this set has a few perks over the others. For one, it can more readily take advantage of Sceptile's Dream World ability, Unburden, which takes the already fast Sceptile and makes certain that nothing outspeeds it. Secondly, Sceptile's physical movepool is actually much better than its special movepool. Finally, there's the fact that this set actually has a means of boosting its offense, something the specially offensive sets lack. Swords Dance allows Sceptile to double its Attack in a single turn and lets it sweep much more easily. Leaf Blade is the STAB move of choice here, as its respectable 90 Base Power will do good amounts of damage to anything after a Swords Dance boost. The last two slots are dedicated to coverage moves. Earthquake and Drain Punch both demolish Steel-types, but the former trades super effective coverage on Normal-type users of Sap Sipper and Ferroseed for a higher Base Power and the ability to maim grounded Fire- and Poison-types such as Entei and Drapion. Acrobatics is used not only to ensure the activation of Flying Gem, but also because of its high Base Power and super effective coverage on opposing Grass-types and Bug-types, bar Ferroseed. If you choose to forgo Acrobatics, then Rock Slide can be used to land a good hit on Flying-types such as Moltres that would otherwise have no trouble countering this set.</p> <p>The given EVs ensure that, before an Unburden boost, Sceptile ties with base 105s if it runs Adamant and at worse ties with opposing Sceptile with Jolly. Attack is then maximized and the remaining EVs are placed in Defense to slightly cushion Sceptile against physical priority. Adamant is preferred with Flying Gem as Sceptile is missing out on the power that Life Orb provides and gets a ton of Speed once it activates Unburden. If you're confident you can get Unburden to activate, you can get away with running 0 Speed and invest all of the EVs in Sceptile's bulk, since even without any investment, Sceptile outruns Timid Choice Scarf Manectric--the fastest thing you'll see in RU. Grass Gem is also an option to activate Unburden, but Flying Gem ensures Sceptile always has access to a fully powered Acrobatics. A Jolly nature and Overgrow should be used when Sceptile forgoes the use of a Gem to activate Unburden. Stick to the given moves; all of Sceptile's effective coverage moves have been talked about.</p> <p>This set is pretty self-sufficient as it is, but it benefits from the standard things all offensive Pokemon benefit from, namely entry hazards and the weakening of its checks. Uxie can set up Stealth Rock and then give Sceptile a good setup opportunity with its trademark Yawn + U-turn combo. Spikes users such as Smeargle and Crustle also make good partners. Strong physical attackers that can severely dent opposing physical walls, perhaps even a second Swords Dance sweeper, are also appreciated. Kabutops has decent defensive synergy with Sceptile and can either punch holes into enemy defenses or take advantage of the holes Sceptile punches and sweep itself.</p> "

      {
        "name": "SubSeed",
        "description": "<p>Despite the introduction of Whimsicott, which is the be-all and end-all of SubSeeders, Sceptile can also fill this niche and differentiates itself from the cotton ball due to its ability to hurt opposing Pokemon through direct offense in addition to passive damage. The strategy here is to use Leech Seed as a Pokemon switches in, then use Substitute to protect Sceptile from status and attacks while regaining most of the sacrificed HP though the aforementioned Leech Seed. Whenever the opportunity presents itself, Sceptile is free to fire off a powerful Leaf Storm or do more consistent damage with Giga Drain. It's worth noting that Sceptile also has the option of using Substitute until it is in Overgrow range in order to fire off an even stronger STAB attack. Hidden Power Fire is the coverage move of choice because it lands a super effective hit on all the Grass-types that would otherwise wall this set. Focus Blast is a viable alternative because it maintains coverage on Ferroseed and makes it possible for Sceptile to beat Sap Sipper users such as Sawsbuck and Bouffalant. It does, however, come with the unfortunate side effect of leaving Sceptile completely walled by Roselia and Amoonguss.</p> <p>The given EVs ensure that Sceptile outpaces as much as possible, Speed tying with other Sceptile at the very least, and maximize its Special Attack. You may also choose to run max Speed; this is especially useful if you opt against Hidden Power Fire as Sceptile's coverage move, as this would mean it doesn't need to run a 30 Speed IV, essentially ensuring its always faster than opposing Sceptile. Doing this also comes with the benefit of recovering a greater HP percentage though Leech Seed every turn. Hidden Power Ice is also an acceptable coverage move, as it still gets super effective coverage on all the Grass-types in the tier, bar Ferroseed.</p> <p>This particular Sceptile variant appreciates entry hazard support more than any other due to the sheer volume of switches it forces. Smeargle can act as a very effective suicide lead, often getting at least two layers of entry hazards up before going down. This, of course, means that you will also have to invest in a spinblocker to prevent the hazards from being blown away; Spiritomb and Rotom both fill this role quite nicely. Because Sceptile cannot possibly cover every relevant threat with a single coverage move, it also appreciates a partner who can take advantage of the Pokemon that don't mind its chosen coverage move. If you went with Hidden Power Fire, then Sap Sipper users such as Miltank and Bouffalant are the main issue. Luckily, every Pokemon with access to this ability shares the Normal typing, allowing you to take advantage of it by pairing Sceptile with a sturdy Fighting-type, such as Gurdurr or Hariyama. On the other hand, if you decide to go with Focus Blast, then pairing Sceptile with a Fire-type that can take advantage of the Grass-types which will wall this set is a good idea.</p> "

The physically oriented Gallade quickly outclassed the feminine Gardevoir in every aspect: the former possesses the rare Psychic / Fighting typing while retaining the same great Special Defense stat as the latter. Though both are the last in their evolutionary line, Gardevoir and Gallade have never met in the same tier. After a short stay in ADV BL, Gardevoir fell from grace and never saw the glory of the OU tier, instead finding itself in the densely populated NU tier. Post-ADV, it was outclassed by other Psychic-types introduced in DPP and BW, such as Azelf and Reuniclus.</p> <p>The Embrace Pokemon now finds itself sitting in the NU tier, but is viable in RU. As its elegance suggests, Gardevoir is very frail on the physical side, with a dismal base 68 HP and an even lower base 65 Defense stat. However, Gardevoir fares much better on the special side; it has an outstanding base 125 Special Attack, equal to that of Azelf, backed by a solid base 115 Special Defense. Thus, it can launch powerful special attacks and sponge them as well with nary a scratch to its beautiful gown. However, Gardevoir's pure Psychic typing means that it is in constant danger of becoming Pursuit bait in a tier infested with Dark-types, such as Absol and Spiritomb. As its Pokedex entries often say, Gardevoir will protect its trainer with its life. To express its loyalty, it will serve with its tremendously wide movepool that makes Smeargle drool.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gardevoir's gown is so wide that it can easily fit many moves. Its wide movepool consists of many great supporting options as well as other offensive moves to consider. Encore can be used to help with set-up, though Gardevoir often prefers to have wide coverage. It can pull off a Substitute + Disable set to some success, nailing threats such as Choice Band Drapion, but the Substitute + 3 Attacks set already achieves this. As base 80 Speed isn't really impressive, Gardevoir can use a support or offensive Trick Room set. Gardevoir's wide variety of support moves also include Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Healing Wish, each with its own use in supporting the team. Other offensive options include Signal Beam, Energy Ball, Grass Knot, and Shadow Ball. Gardevoir can also support weather teams with Rain Dance and Sunny Day, though there are other Pokemon better suited for this role. Mean Look can be used to ensure that Gardevoir can use Memento on a specific target, benefiting the incoming Pokemon. Destiny Bond can also be used as another suicidal move, though it will probably cause a blind switch, which might be unfavorable for your switch-in. Gardevoir has access to boosting moves, such as Charge Beam and Calm Mind, but in a tier filled with Pokemon that can down Gardevoir in a single move, Gardevoir rarely finds a chance to set up, let alone sweep. Though Gardevoir has many options to choose from, the given sets are the best and have the most general utility.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Dark-types and Pursuit users are possibly the best counters to Gardevoir. If they find an opportunity to switch in safely, Gardevoir is almost certainly cornered and defeated. Special walls, such as Clefable, can handle Gardevoir, but they must be wary if it carries Choice Specs. Gardevoir is extremely frail on the physical side, and that should be where to target when attempting to take it down. Any decently strong physical attack will easily cause Gardevoir to literally fall from grace. Ferroseed can use Gardevoir as setup fodder if it lacks Focus Blast. Dusknoir can take a hit or two and KO Gardevoir with Shadow Sneak. Physical attackers that are faster than Gardevoir, such as Sceptile and Choice Scarf Primeape, are great checks. Ironically, Gardevoir's kin, Gallade, can survive a special attack as it is also blessed with great Special Defense, and can cut all ties with Gardevoir with Night Slash.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Despite having a poor defensive typing and an abysmal Defense stat, Gardevoir is well suited for a support role thanks to its excellent movepool. Will-O-Wisp allows Gardevoir to spread burns and abuse its tendency to attract physical attackers, punishing them for their naivety. As the burn status halves the burnt Pokemon's power, Gardevoir can take physical hits more easily from a burnt opponent; Gardevoir can even survive a Pursuit at full health from a burnt Choice Band Drapion. It can also stall for burn damage with Wish and Protect. Wish provides Gardevoir's allies with some support, although Gardevoir does not have a huge HP stat, which diminishes the usefulness of such a strategy. Alternatively, Gardevoir can use Heal Bell to act as a cleric, though it might have to rely on the inconsistent Pain Split to regain health, as Gardevoir often has difficulty receiving its own Wish without the use of Protect. Psychic is Gardevoir's best STAB option, and prevents it from being Taunt bait. This set not only aims to support the team, it can also wall several special attackers, who can't even scratch its white dress without a super effective move.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes both Gardevoir's special bulk and the HP payload of its Wish. With this spread, most special attackers will have difficulty denting Gardevoir unless they pack super effective attacks, such as Shadow Ball and Signal Beam. It is recommended to invest Gardevoir's EVs into Special Defense instead of Defense, as even with maximum Defense EVs, Gardevoir has difficulty walling a considerable number of physical attackers. Thus, it is better for it to simply cripple physical attackers with a burn. Gardevoir is not restricted to spreading burns; it can also utilize other status moves, such as Thunder Wave and Toxic, though Will-O-Wisp is generally the better option. Thunder Wave is an excellent choice for supporting slow sweepers on the team, such as Choice Band Aggron, whereas Toxic enables Gardevoir to stall a myriad of Pokemon with the use of Wish and Protect. Thunderbolt can be used over Psychic as the sole attacking move, as it hits Absol--a common switch-in to Gardevoir--for good damage. Healing Wish is an interesting option to consider that gives a sweeper a second chance at doing its job after Gardevoir is done supporting the team. Synchronize can be used over Trace to deter status, and let Gardevoir act as a pseudo-status absorber. However it is rather counterproductive, as Gardevoir can cure itself with Heal Bell, and Trace is the better option in most cases. For example, Trace allows Gardevoir to switch in on the likes of Lightningrod Manectric for free if it uses an Electric-type move, and also gain a Special Attack boost. This would greatly aid Gardevoir in walling several special attackers.</p> <p>Although Gardevoir has Will-O-Wisp to threaten physical attackers, there are several that it still has to be wary of. A single physical attack can swiftly eliminate this graceful Pokemon. Pursuit users are always a great concern for Gardevoir; Drapion, for example, checkmates Gardevoir if it can get in safely--Gardevoir has to burn Drapion on the switch to stand a chance of winning. Even with Will-O-Wisp to stunt most physical attackers, physical walls such as Steelix are still great teammates to the maiden in white dress as it can sponge Dark-, Bug-, and Ghost-type moves attempting to finish Gardevoir off. Furthermore, the burn support that Gardevoir provides makes it easier for the physical walls to do their job. Bulky Fighting-types, such as Hariyama and Poliwrath, are good teammates; they can easily set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit and appreciate the Wish and Heal Bell support that Gardevoir provides.</p> "

        "description": "<p>A great movepool often means wide coverage, and this holds true for Gardevoir. With Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Focus Blast, Gardevoir hits everything in the tier bar Shedinja for at least neutral damage. With a Choice Scarf, Gardevoir makes a great revenge killer, albeit a graceful one. Coupled with decent base 80 Speed, Gardevoir is no slouch at outpacing many opponents when decked out with a Choice Scarf. With Trace, Gardevoir can act as a great counter to Pokemon dependent on weather to boost their Speed, such as Swift Swim Omastar. Because Trace copies the opponent's ability, Gardevoir can enjoy the benefits of the opponent's weather and put them to its own advantage. Choice Scarf Gardevoir outspeeds all Swift Swim and Chlorophyll abusers thanks to Trace, effectively countering them. On the other hand, Choice Specs Gardevoir is a force to be reckoned with. Hidden beneath its docile appearance is the nasty ability to absolutely wreck most Pokemon when holding Choice Specs. Trick allows Gardevoir to cripple walls, especially those dependent on Eviolite, such as Ferroseed. However, a Choice Specs-boosted Focus Blast will 2HKO Eviolite Ferroseed anyway. A timely Trick can also cripple set-up sweepers attempting to nab free boosts on Gardevoir. Shadow Ball is an alternative to Trick that has perfect coverage with Focus Blast.</p> <p>Other interesting moves that Gardevoir can use on this set include Energy Ball, Grass Knot, and Signal Beam. However, the standard moves as given are generally the best options, unless you need Gardevoir to nab surprise KOs on certain threats. This Gardevoir set is bound to have problems with Pursuit users, unfortunately. Furthermore, locking Gardevoir into an inappropriate move too early can spell doom for this damsel in distress. Gardevoir is extremely prone to getting revenge killed, especially since Dark-types, such as Spiritomb and Drapion, run rampant in the RU tier.</p> <p>This is where Team Preview comes into play; Team Preview is a huge asset to take advantage of when using this Gardevoir set, as you can use it to easily spot potential Gardevoir counters. Instead of blindly sending out Gardevoir and clicking Psychic, you can opt to immediately switch it out to scout for the opponent's switch-in and possibly predict the switch the next time Gardevoir is in play. A well-timed Focus Blast can easily decimate Steel-types such as Steelix and Aggron, while Thunderbolt will fry Absol and Crawdaunt. Dark-types of your own, such as Drapion and Zweilous, are good teammates; Fighting-types are also notable partners. They can easily set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit in the event of a misplay.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is really great, as it allows Gardevoir to secure a few KOs. Steelix is not only a physical wall that has good synergy with Gardevoir, it can also set up Stealth Rock. Ferroseed is another notable teammate, as it resists two of the types that Gardevoir is weak to, has access to entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, and can use Leech Seed to provide some recovery for Gardevoir. Wish support is deeply appreciated as Gardevoir has no method of healing itself; Wish can bring Gardevoir back from the brink of fainting, allowing it to wreak even more havoc and cause more frustration for the opponent as they try in vain to bring it down.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<p>Gardevoir has access to dual screens, so why not make use of it? At first glance, Gardevoir might seemed outclassed by other dual screens users, most notably Uxie, which boasts better bulk and access to U-turn. There seems to be no reason to use Gardevoir over Uxie! However, Gardevoir has access to Taunt and Will-O-Wisp, which might prove to be more useful than U-turn or Yawn in certain cases. With Taunt, Gardevoir can prevent the opposing Pokemon from setting up while Gardevoir executes its strategy, which takes a total of three turns. Additionally, Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers, so Gardevoir is effectively taking a quarter of the usual damage when facing a burnt Pokemon behind Reflect. Psychic can be used if you would rather Gardevoir not be Taunt bait. Like Uxie, it has access to Memento, which Gardevoir can use to sacrifice itself after setting up the screens and allow its teammate to enter the field safely, and gain a free turn to set up. The main aim of this set is to support a sweeper, especially one that cannot be taken down easily while behind screens. As a rule of thumb, you should always set up Reflect first, as Gardevoir never fails to attract physical attackers. After that, it can proceed to burn the target with Will-O-Wisp or set up Light Screen, then pave way for the sweeper with Memento.</p> <p>Light Clay is the compulsory item on this set to extend the screens' number of turns. The given EV spread maximizes Gardevoir's HP and Speed, allowing it to take hits better generally, and quickly set up screens or cripple the opposing Pokemon with an appropriate move. Healing Wish is an alternative to Memento that heals your sweeper completely. As this set's sole purpose is to make set up easier for the incoming sweeper, Gardevoir must be paired with a set up sweeper that appreciates the dual screens support. Rock Polish Aggron is a good example. It has extremely high Defense behind Reflect and great Special Defense under Light Screen, making it obscenely hard to take down. Furthermore, it has good synergy with Gardevoir--Aggron resists all of the attacks Gardevoir is weak to. Other examples include Shell Smash Omastar and Hariyama. Though Omastar might not have good type synergy with Gardevoir, it greatly appreciates dual screens support, as it makes Omastar harder to take down with priority moves--even Mach Punch. Hariyama can easily set up on a Choice-locked Pursuit, and is extremely difficult to KO thanks to the screens.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<p>With so many powerful Dark-types in RU just waiting to plunge Gardevoir into total darkness, the graceful Gardevoir must find a way to outdo them without plainly resorting to brute strength. The multitude of Dark-types can often corner Gardevoir with Pursuit, but this set aims to rectify that. By casting a Substitute, Gardevoir shields itself from a possible incoming Pursuit. Behind a Substitute, Gardevoir will put many physical attackers in an awkward position; physical attackers find themselves no longer able to neither check nor counter Gardevoir in a single move, and possibly have to choose between breaking the Substitute and getting KOed by an attack, or flee for their lives. With Substitute giving Gardevoir some protection from physical attacks, it can proceed to launch off a few powerful attacks of its own. Additionally, Substitute can possibly earn Gardevoir a couple of free turns as the opponent scrambles to find an appropriate counter. This set remedies Gardevoir's Pursuit weakness, and allows it to counter several threats it probably couldn't with other sets. For example, Absol will be put in a disadvantageous position when Gardevoir is behind a Substitute. No longer can Absol use Sucker Punch to KO Gardevoir; it now faces the possibility of being OHKOed by Focus Blast instead.</p> <p>Although this set allows Gardevoir to easily outmaneuver several threats, it can still be revenge killed if you're not careful. Substitute is mandatory to keep Gardevoir alive as long as possible and nab a few KOs. However, once the Substitute has faded, it signals the time for Gardevoir to fly gracefully back into its Poke Ball, elated that it has done what it usually could not. Without Substitute, this variant is no different from the other sets, and is as prone to being revenge killed as it normally would be. Keeping the Substitute up is the key to success for this set. Use this set with caution, as a simple misplay can prove to be costly. For example, if Gardevoir loses its Substitute while attempting to KO something when the opponent has a Pursuit user waiting in the wings, Gardevoir will still be revenge killed. With some sleight of hand, it is possible that Gardevoir can swiftly remove Pursuit users itself. Expert Belt can be used on this set for greater damage output; Life Orb should not be used as its recoil, coupled with the HP lost in creating Substitutes, can be overwhelming. Shadow Ball can be used over Thunderbolt for perfect coverage alongside Focus Blast, but Thunderbolt hits more Pokemon super effectively, most notably Murkrow and Crawdaunt. Encore is an option to use for easing set up, though Gardevoir appreciates the coverage it gets from its three main moves. Fighting-types are great teammates to maintain offensive pressure, even when Gardevoir's Substitute is broken and it has to switch out. Entry hazard support is much appreciated, as this set can force multiple switches thanks to Substitute. Ferroseed makes a good teammate because it can set up entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, and has good synergy with Gardevoir. Wish support from Clefable can give Gardevoir another whirl and heal any HP lost from making Substitutes.</p> "

  "Regirock": {
    "overview": "<p>Regirock sports an amazingly high base 200 Defense, backed by an acceptable base 80 HP. It can take on some of the strongest physical attacks, even weaker super effective ones. Additionally, Regirock can make do with its base 100 Special Defense with EV investment while still maintaining most of its physical bulk. Rock is not an excellent defensive typing as it's weak to many common attacking types, such as Ground, Water, Grass, and Fighting; nonetheless, it grants Regirock a crucial resistance to Fire, which allows it to comfortably check many Fire-types, such as Moltres and Entei. Another of Regirock's flaws is its lack of any reliable recovery outside of Rest. Despite such drawbacks, Regirock is still a very sturdy and reliable defensive Pokemon in RU, and also one that can set Stealth Rock reliably and repeatedly when needed. Aside from being a generally good bulky wall to fall back on, Regirock finds its niche in stopping many Fire-types--specifically, it is one of the few counters to Moltres.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Regirock's main niche is as a defensive Pokemon that can check many Fire-types, and even straight-up counter Moltres, it also has several other more offensive options to choose from. Drain Punch and Hammer Arm are viable Fighting-type attacks. Counter can be used as Regirock's titanic Defense virtually guarantees that it will not fall to any non-super effective physical attack. Curse is a possible boosting option, though Regirock's Rock typing does not really help in this regard as it is weak to many common attacking types. Strong support in removing Fighting-type attacks and other threatening foes will be needed to pull off a sweep. In most cases, Regirock will be better off supporting the team than receiving support. Rest, used in tandem with Chesto Berry or cleric support, is worth considering if your team has trouble dealing with Fire-types. Regirock can also work as an offensive tank with a spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD and support the team with Stealth Rock and even Thunder Wave. Drain Punch, Stone Edge, and Earthquake are all usable on an offensive tank Regirock. It has a reduced ability to check Fire-types without Special Defense investment, however. Explosion with a type-resist Berry, such as Chople or Rindo Berry, allows Regirock to lure and take out Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee or Grass-types such as Sceptile, respectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fighting-types are a menace for Regirock: Poliwrath often has Rest to shrug off status while Guts Hariyama benefits from it. Steel-types have an easy time setting up on Regirock: Steelix can set up Stealth Rock and proceed to threaten with Earthquake, Klinklang can use Shift Gear if Regirock doesn't have Earthquake, and Escavalier and Durant can threaten directly with Iron Head, provided that Regirock does not have Fire Punch. Grass-types can also walk over Regirock without much difficulty; Sceptile can prey on Regirock's lower Special Defense, while Lilligant can either put down Regirock with Sleep Powder or use it as setup fodder should Lilligant have a Lum Berry. Defensive Water-types such as Slowking and Lanturn can safely wall Regirock, though the latter has to watch out for Earthquake. Slowking has Regenerator and fears only Toxic, while Lanturn sometimes carries Heal Bell to negate even that. Qwilfish can Taunt Regirock and set up entry hazards, but Earthquake dents it as Clear Body negates Intimidate. Offensive Water-types such as Kabutops and Omastar can set up on it, although Thunder Wave will badly cripple them. Ferroseed can set up directly on Regirock without Fire Punch. Regirock abhors status as it greatly reduces its ability to reliably fulfill its main purpose--checking Fire-types. A strong offensive presence coupled with status can sometimes be sufficient to stop a cleric from healing Regirock of status and allow said Fire-type to finally get past Regirock.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With Stealth Rock almost an absolute necessity on every team, Regirock is a reliable and consistent Stealth Rock user. It defeats Cryogonal one on one, meaning that spinblocking against Cryogonal isn't compulsory as you could switch Regirock in as Cryogonal uses Rapid Spin and just set it back up again. Rock Slide is chosen as the STAB move over Stone Edge thanks to its higher PP and better accuracy to deal consistent damage; it also OHKOes both Moltres and Cryogonal. Thunder Wave and Toxic are both secondary support options to cater to teams. Thunder Wave slows down sweepers and other offensive threats such as Durant and Stoutland, whereas Toxic is an option for use on defensive teams looking to stall out foes and to cripple many of Regirock's common switch-ins, such as Lanturn and Gallade. Protect can be used in the fourth slot to scout for moves such as Medicham's High Jump Kick while letting Regirock heal with Leftovers and helps Regirock to check Fire-types more reliably in the long run. Protect helps to stall out foes with poison damage from Toxic. Earthquake is yet another reliable attacking move that dents Kabutops and Steel-type switch-ins such as Steelix and Aggron.</p> <p>A specially defensive EV spread allows Regirock to handle Fire-type behemoths such as Moltres, and Regirock still has plenty of physical bulk even without investment. Here are some damage calculations to demonstrate Regirock's huge special bulk and its still-high physical bulk:</p> <ul> <li>252 SpA Life Orb Moltres Hidden Power Grass 38.46 - 45.6% <li>252 SpA Life Orb Moltres Fire Blast 24.72 - 29.12%</li> <li>252 Atk Choice Band Hustle Durant Iron Head 77.47 - 91.2%</li> </ul> <p>Moltres can manage a maximum of 74.7% damage in total with one Fire Blast and Hidden Power Grass. Thus, bar a critical hit or burn, Regirock needs about 62% HP after entry hazards to check Moltres if Regirock has Protect. Specially defensive Regirock is no slouch physically either, as shown by Choice Band Durant's failure to OHKO it from full health. Wish support from teammates such as Clefable and Alomomola are good options to keep Regirock healthy as it often needs to be at high HP to be able to check the aforementioned threats. Rapid Spin support from Cryogonal, ironically, is also helpful as Regirock has no reliable recovery and appreciates the removal of hazards. However, this compounds your team's Fighting-type weakness, so Ghost-types such as Rotom and Spiritomb, bulky Poison-types such as Qwilfish and Amoonguss, and Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Uxie will come in handy. Other Grass-types, such as Tangrowth and Roselia, are also good teammates as they resist Water- and Grass-type attacks; the latter can also provide further entry hazard support. Aside from defensive teammates, offensive Pokemon such as Moltres and Lilligant are also good teammates as they can capitalize on the status spread by Regirock and fall back on its defenses if they fail to pull off a sweep. Stone Edge is an option over Rock Slide for added power, but it can be stalled out easily by SubRoost Moltres and has poorer accuracy. Rock Slide is often enough as it is usually used against foes weak to it.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Regirock's Rock typing is a huge boon for sun teams. It pairs well with many sun sweepers as it can take Fire-type attacks targeting Grass-type sweepers while also resisting common priority moves or being bulky enough to sponge them. Many priority users, such as Extreme Speed Entei, Belly Drum Linoone, and Swords Dance Absol, threaten sun teams due to their sweepers' frailty. Regirock is able to check the aforementioned Pokemon. It also benefits from sun as its Water weakness is negated, and its natural Fire resistance lets it shrug off even sun-boosted attacks. Regirock can set up not only Sunny Day, but also Stealth Rock, and is thus a good utility teammate for sun teams. It can often set up Sunny Day more than once when needed, as it has the defenses to keep itself healthy enough for another setup.</p> <p>Rock Slide is the main STAB move used, often to check opposing Fire-types hoping to take advantage of sun-boosted Fire-type attacks. However, when relying on Regirock to check Fire-types, be wary of the occasional Solar Beam from Pokemon such as Typhlosion. Rock Slide is also useful for dealing with Cryogonal, a common Rapid Spin user. Fire Punch receives pseudo-STAB from sun, where it is just as powerful and even more reliable than Rock Slide. Escavalier and Durant are both notable foes that Fire Punch works extremely well against, and the former is often even slower than Regirock as it usually does not invest in Speed. Explosion, however, is a usable last resort to deal damage while bringing in another teammate safely, possibly paving a way for a sweep.</p> <p>A specially defensive EV spread enables Regirock to tank special hits more comfortably as it already has sufficient physical bulk. It also allows Regirock to sponge common special Water-type attacks such as Scald, and physical ones aren't going to break through Regirock while weakened by sun. As with all dedicated sun inducers, Heat Rock is used to prolong the sun. Thunder Wave is another option to support the team as it slows down foes, which can be helpful in the event that the sun is out. Toxic deters opponents from stalling out sun with Protect, though Thunder Wave is usually the better option for an offensive sun team. Stone Edge can be considered for added power over Rock Slide. For other great Sunny Day users as teammates, Uxie is a good partner and complements Regirock, as it resists Fighting and is immune to Ground. Furthermore, with Regirock taking care of Stealth Rock, Uxie will be able to free up a moveslot for another support move such as Heal Bell. Sun sweepers are definitely compulsory teammates. Victreebel, Exeggutor, Moltres, and Sawsbuck are common sun sweepers. However, defensive sun-reliant teammates such as Harvest Exeggutor are also usable, though less common.</p> "

  "Torterra": {
    "overview": "<p>Torterra is a strange case of a Pokemon. With solid defenses, good Attack, and high-powered STAB options, Torterra can fill quite a few roles in the RU metagame. With its solid Grass / Ground typing, Torterra can take up a defensive role by checking or outright countering many of the common Electric-types in the tier, with Rotom-C, Rotom, and Magneton being the most important ones. Torterra's access to Stealth Rock and Synthesis only make these defensive sets better as it lets Torterra support its team and stay around for a long time. Offensively, Torterra has great STAB options in Wood Hammer and Earthquake, thus allowing it to deal with dangerous threats such as Druddigon, Amoonguss, and Alomomola quite nicely. Torterra also has a great boosting move in Rock Polish to fix its otherwise poor Speed.</p> <p>In spite of these great attributes, Torterra can find life difficult in RU. Despite its great STAB combination and solid coverage move in Stone Edge, Torterra has no hope of breaking through Tangrowth. Despite its usage quite possibly being lower than it ever has been in the history of RU, Tangrowth's amazing Regenerator ability can make it quite difficult for Torterra's teammates to successfully wear it down. Even after a Rock Polish boost, some Choice Scarf users such as Manectric and Durant can still outspeed Torterra and severely dent or outright KO it. Defensively, Fire-types are extremely common in the tier and Pokemon such as Moltres and Emboar are always ready to pound away at Torterra or one of its teammates. While Torterra can KO or severely dent these Fire-types, it will often have to predict these Fire-types switching in due to them outspeeding Torterra. Status is also a major pain for Torterra, in particular being burns, since this severely limits Torterra's damage output as a defensive Pokemon. However, despite these downfalls, Torterra remains a solid choice for many teams due to its ability to successfully run both defensive and offensive sets.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Torterra doesn't have a lot of noteworthy options remaining in its movepool that haven't already been discussed. Of these, Swords Dance is probably the most appealing. Although this doubles Torterra's already beefy Attack stat, it does nothing to fix its Speed issues, and this can prove very problematic in a tier full of faster Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon. Torterra gets dual screens, but you're better off using Uxie for this as it is much faster, has much better bulk, and can use either U-turn or Memento to get its teammates in safely. Crunch is the only noteworthy attacking option that hasn't been discussed as it can smack Exeggutor.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>If you haven't noticed a theme yet, Tangrowth is the best answer to Torterra hands down. It can switch into Torterra with relative impunity, threaten to put one of Torterra's teammates to sleep, and then just switch back out to regain any health it lost thanks to Regenerator. Outside of Tangrowth, Flying-types such as Moltres can come in on any STAB move, but a swift Stone Edge can ruin their day. Fire-types such as Typhlosion and Emboar also suffer a similar fate when it comes to trying to switch in, but their STAB Fire-type moves can make quick work of Torterra if they can get in safely. Weezing isn't very common, but it doesn't mind anything Torterra has to offer and it can simply use Will-O-Wisp to cripple any Torterra set. Cryogonal is a bit shaky as Wood Hammer and Stone Edge decimate it, but it is immune to Earthquake and can threaten an OHKO with Ice Beam. Cryogonal can also spin away the Stealth Rock that Torterra sets. Most Fire-types can take out Torterra, but they have a much harder time if Torterra gets a Rock Polish boost under its belt before they're able to deal with it. Some Choice Scarf users, such as Durant, Manectric, and Typhlosion, can outspeed Torterra even after a Rock Polish boost. In general, you're better off using Speed to beat Torterra, as many of RU's top physical walls, such as Rhydon, Alomomola, and Steelix, are hit really hard by Torterra's STAB moves, thus letting it muscle past them most of the time.</p> ",

With this set, Torterra is able to check most Electric-types and stop their attempts at building momentum with Volt Switch, as well as retaining the ability to check some dangerous physical attackers such as Aggron and Kabutops. Stealth Rock is a great move for any defensive Pokemon, but it is especially useful coming from Torterra as it beats the most common Rapid Spin user in the tier, Kabutops, without many issues. Wood Hammer is a reliable STAB move Torterra can use to deal with bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Slowking and Poliwrath. This also serves to nail Levitate Pokemon, such as Uxie and Rotom. Earthquake is another good STAB option to smash Aggron while also keeping any Fire-type not named Moltres at bay. Synthesis is a great move as it provides reliable recovery so Torterra can continue to come in on powerful offensive threats and set up Stealth Rock again should it be removed by a spinner.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes special bulk while making sure Torterra can switch into Choice Band Aggron's Head Smash without suffering a 2HKO after Stealth Rock damage. Although the given moveset and EV spread is the best to use, there are a couple of things to consider. Leech Seed is an alternative method of healing for Torterra. While it makes it much harder for Torterra to stay healthy, the extra chip damage it provides can be useful for when a sweeper would otherwise fall just short of being able to push past its check. Toxic is useful if only to screw over Tangrowth. It's also nice to chip away at the likes of Moltres and Uxie. Roar can be a neat option if you're using Torterra with Spikes support. Both Toxic and Roar should be seriously considered should your team already have a Stealth Rock user. As a final note, one can use a physically defensive spread with 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature to take on Pokemon such as Aggron, Rhydon, and Golurk with much greater ease. However, this will make it very difficult for Torterra to handle the likes of Rotom-C and the given spread already allows Torterra to sufficiently handle Aggron in most situations.</p> <p>Bulky Water-type Pokemon are generally good options to use with Torterra as they can take on many of the Fire-type Pokemon in the tier. Alomomola and Qwilfish are both good options. Alomomola can take on many of the tier's physical attackers while Qwilfish is a more reliable check to Escavalier and Durant. If you're more concerned about Moltres being a pain, Slowking is a better option as it can still take on resisted physical attacks while handling Moltres more reliably than Alomomola or Qwilfish ever could. As Torterra isn't just a sitting duck, it isn't a bad idea to run it on balanced teams either. Moltres has great defensive synergy with Torterra as it can take on most Electric- and Rock-types that can force Moltres out. Meanwhile, Moltres can use its powerful attacks to quickly break down the opposing team or even use a Choice Scarf set to pick and choose its spots while having a good fall-back option in Torterra. Offensive Water-types such as Omastar, Kabutops, and Samurott can find their lives much easier with Torterra being a great way to answer most Electric-types in the tier.</p> "

        "name": "Rock Polish",
        "description": "<p>This is Torterra's trademark offensive set, and for good reason. The premise of this set is simple: grab a Rock Polish boost on a Pokemon that cannot hit Torterra for significant damage such as Aggron to make Torterra fast enough to outspeed the entire unboosted RU metagame, bar Accelgor, and watch as Torterra shreds through offensive and defensive teams alike with its blistering Speed and fantastic coverage. Earthquake will be Torterra's main attack, as it is still incredibly strong and lacks the recoil Wood Hammer has; however, Wood Hammer's extra power and Grass-type coverage allows it to crush certain Pokemon that Earthquake would be unable to dent, such as Uxie and Mesprit. Wood Hammer also crushes bulky Water-type Pokemon, most importantly Alomomola, thus making Torterra one of the very few physical sweepers that can get past Alomomola with little to no support. Stone Edge rounds off Torterra's coverage by allowing it to nail those pesky Flying-type Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake and resist Wood Hammer. Between these three attacks, Torterra has virtually flawless coverage, and in tandem with its blistering Speed after a Rock Polish, Torterra would appear to have the ability to tear through opposing teams in an instant.</p> <p>However, things aren't quite so simple for Torterra. As much as it would enjoy the ability to simply Rock Polish up and sweep at any moment, this simply isn't feasible early- or mid-game just because the things that do beat Torterra will likely still be alive and kicking, ready to stop Torterra's sweep in an instant should it attempt it. Furthermore, even though Torterra is a very strong Pokemon offensively, RU is a metagame with numerous bulky Pokemon, and there are a large number of Pokemon that are capable of surviving an Earthquake or Wood Hammer from Torterra at full health. Fortunately, Torterra is not really just a one-trick pony; thanks to its bulk and typing, it can still act as a solid bulky attacker early- and mid-game. By using Torterra in this way, it can actually wear down many of its checks by itself early-game, giving it the opportunity to sweep late-game. For example, while Escavalier can take a hit from Torterra and KO it in return with Megahorn, it is actually 2HKOed by Earthquake; therefore, if you can get Torterra in earlier in the match and hit it with Earthquake as it comes in on a predicted Wood Hammer, you could have easily just opened the door for Torterra to sweep later in the match, should Escavalier have been the opponent's main answer to it. Keep in mind though that most of the time the opponent will carry more than one answer to Torterra simply due to the nature of its coverage and typing. Thus, during Team Preview, it is important to see what answers to Torterra the opponent has, and decide whether or not it is more advantageous to play Torterra as just a bulky attacker or your team's main sweeper.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is generally preferred for this set, as it gives Torterra a much-needed boost in power. With an Adamant nature, Leftovers are the recommended item, as they give Torterra a way to offset the recoil from Wood Hammer and give Torterra more longevity in general. However, Jolly is certainly a respectable option; for example, with a Jolly nature, Torterra is able to outspeed the likes of Accelgor after a Rock Polish, though this comes at the cost of a large amount of power. To circumvent this, you can opt to use a Life Orb in order to make up for the lost power, but unfortunately this will cause Torterra to faint very quickly, especially when coupled with the recoil from Wood Hammer. Still, the increased Speed and power from using a Jolly nature in tandem with Life Orb does make Torterra a much better sweeper, though at the cost of much of its early- to mid-game utility. Overgrow is the ability of choice on this set, as it allows Torterra, in a desperate situation, to unleash one last, devastating Wood Hammer against a slower opponent.</p> <p>When it comes to sweeping, Torterra absolutely needs Tangrowth out of the picture. Moltres, Emboar, and Sigilyph are all solid options to remove it from play. Slowking is a solid pivot option as it can use Thunder Wave to slow down faster Choice Scarf users while also luring out Electric-type moves for Torterra to gain free access to the battlefield to set up. Although Typhlosion isn't exactly the best Choice Scarf user around, it can outspeed and OHKO Torterra even after it uses Rock Polish, so having a Slowking or Druddigon would be a good idea to ensure it can't inflict much damage on your team when it forces out Torterra. As Tangrowth is the best defensive counter to Rock Polish Torterra, Toxic Spikes aren't a bad idea in order to wear it down faster. Qwilfish is ideal for this role as it can handle Escavalier and Durant without a lot of problems.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Torterra can go fully defensive or fully offensive quite effectively, it can also perform as a reliable bulky attacker capable of taking strong attacks and returning the favor with its own strong moves. Stealth Rock is a great move on Torterra as it can keep the Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon that Torterra generally has issues with at bay. Wood Hammer is the primary choice for a STAB move as it deals with bulky Water-type Pokemon, and most importantly ensures Kabutops will have to sacrifice itself to spin away Stealth Rock. However, Earthquake is another solid STAB option. While it is incapable of dealing with Water-types as effectively, it does let Torterra better handle Aggron and it gets better neutral coverage with Torterra's coverage move on this set. Stone Edge gives Torterra solid coverage and ensures that Flying-types, such as Moltres, will always have something to think about before switching in. Synthesis rounds off the set as it allows Torterra to stay healthy and keep taking hits from serious threats such as Aggron and Rotom-C.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Torterra's damage output and ensures it can outspeed minimum Speed Lanturn. The rest is put into HP for overall bulk. As many bulkier Pokemon such as Golurk also aim for the same Speed tier, it might be worth your while to move a few HP EVs over to Speed in order to ensure Torterra can outspeed and prevent them from doing anything before Torterra strikes. Rock Slide can be used over Stone Edge if the accuracy bugs you, but the loss in power is rarely worth it. Overgrow is the primary ability choice as it gives Wood Hammer a serious power boost for when you just need Torterra to blast the opposing team one final time. Shell Armor is a bit more niche, but an untimely critical hit can quickly spell the end for Torterra, and possibly cost you the game should Torterra be the last thing keeping something like Rotom-C or Aerodactyl from freely using their STAB moves to finish a match.</p> <p>This Torterra is one of the most reliable offensive responses to Aggron in the entire tier, so Pokemon that loathe the presence of Aggron, such as Uxie, Spiritomb, and Swellow, are good options to use with Torterra. Swellow is especially notable due to Torterra's ability to destroy just about any Rock- or Steel-type in the tier, especially if it runs Earthquake. Bulky Water-type Pokemon are nice choices as they can come in on most Fire- and Ice-type moves aimed at Torterra while it is immune to the Electric-type moves they don't like. Slowking, Alomomola, and Poliwrath are all solid choices in this regard. Torterra really has nothing to stop Tangrowth from switching in at will, so teammates that can handle it are much appreciated. Moltres, Emboar, and Escavalier are all capable of handling Tangrowth with relative ease. Toxic Spikes support is another option and Qwilfish is a great option for this considering it can reliably take on Escavalier and Durant for Torterra.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>While Torterra is capable of using its offensive prowess to sweep with Rock Polish or utilize it alongside its good bulk, a Choice Band turns Torterra into a very potent wallbreaker. Torterra is capable of 2HKOing the vast majority of the RU tier, but as its STABs have many resistances and immunities, one must play with great prediction to get the absolute most out of this set. Wood Hammer is the primary STAB move as it lacks any immunities and is able to smash many of the bulky Water- and Ground-types in the tier, such as Slowking, Alomomola, and Golurk. Earthquake beats up the Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon expecting to come in on a resisted Wood Hammer, but due to the presence of Levitate users and Flying-type Pokemon, this can be an even riskier move to lock into. Stone Edge is there to crush the Flying-type Pokemon that can otherwise switch-in on Torterra's STAB moves and respond accordingly. With the offensive coverage it really needs in three moves, Torterra can use more of a niche utility move in the last slot. Bullet Seed might seem strange, but it does have the ability to hit through Substitutes, Focus Sashes, and Sturdy. Sleep Talk is never a terrible option in a metagame that is infested with sleep inducers, but one must keep in mind that Torterra can't deal with most of them as effectively as other Sleep Talk users such as Emboar, Escavalier, and Druddigon.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes damage output while making sure Torterra will outspeed max Speed Adamant Aggron. As Torterra will rarely ever use the move it chooses in the last slot, there are some other options to look into. Toxic can cripple Tangrowth to help Torterra's teammates wear it down faster. Seed Bomb is a bit stronger than Bullet Seed on average, but it lacks the ability to hit through Substitutes. Superpower is there if you really need to deal with Ferroseed in short order, but Earthquake will usually be enough to handle it. A bulkier spread of 164 HP / 252 Atk / 92 Spe can be used if you want more bulk with Torterra, but being outsped by Aggron limits Torterra's ability to reliably beat it since this set lacks any kind of recovery.</p> <p>Like any other Torterra set, you want something to deal with Tangrowth as it simply doesn't care about anything Torterra runs outside of the rare Toxic. Powerful Fire- and Bug-type Pokemon such as Moltres, Emboar, and Escavalier can quickly break down Tangrowth. Alternatively, Spikes support from Qwilfish or Omastar can also be used to wear down Tangrowth and limit the effect Regenerator has. Paralysis support from the likes of Uxie and Slowking can be useful to allow Torterra to have more of an impact against offensive teams. Having sturdy fall-back options for when you overpredict or simply don't predict the correct switch-in is a good idea due to the nature of Torterra's STABs. Aerodactyl has blazing fast Speed and can use its typing to check most Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon. Once Torterra has dented the opposing team enough, Life Orb Aerodactyl can easily clean up with its decent power and amazing Speed. Uxie, Mesprit, and Rotom-C are common Levitate Pokemon that can come in for free on Earthquake. Spiritomb fares well against the former two while Rotom-C can find it difficult to handle the likes of Druddigon, Roselia, and even your own Rotom-C. If you can't afford paralysis support, but still wish to fix the Speed issues, then you can use Trick Room. Slowking happens to be a reliable Trick Room setter and have solid synergy with Torterra. However, keep in mind that this will let Escavalier outspeed Torterra. Make sure to use a Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs and to move all Speed EVs to HP when going this route.</p> "

  "Dusknoir": {
    "overview": "<p>Dusknoir is, in a nutshell, outclassed. Holding the dubious honor of being the only Pokemon in a lower tier than its pre-evolution, Dusknoir struggles to find much use in the RU metagame. This is because all of its positive points are offset by very negative points. Its incredible base 135 defenses are let down by a laughable base HP of 45, as well as a lack of reliable recovery outside of Pain Split, which is relatively easy to play around. Secondly, while Dusknoir's Attack is very usable, it does not have any powerful moves in its arsenal, with its most powerful STAB move being the weak Shadow Punch. This leaves Dusknoir outclassed offensively by Golurk and Rotom and defensively by Spiritomb and Misdreavus. However, courtesy of its Ghost typing, Dusknoir is capable of spinblocking Cryogonal and Kabutops, two common spinners in the tier, giving it a niche as a tool to keep entry hazards on the field. Dusknoir can also reliably take on Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee, Gallade, and Medicham one-on-one. Overall, before using Dusknoir, consider the existence of the aforementioned better Ghost-types, lest it prove to be a waste of a teamslot.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dusknoir has quite the expansive physical movepool, with options such as Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Rock Slide, Focus Punch, Dynamic Punch, Brick Break, Shadow Sneak, and Pursuit. Unfortunately, Dusknoir will never find the room for these moves, as the moves listed in the above moveset are essentially mandatory. It has a good special movepool with Shadow Ball, Ice Beam, Focus Blast, and Psychic along with a boosting move in Calm Mind. Sadly its low Special Attack and Speed aren't doing it any favors. It has a vast support movepool as well, with Rain Dance, Sunny Day, Trick Room, Torment, Toxic, and Psych Up. However, these are put to better use by other Pokemon, and the only notable support move Dusknoir can use effectively is Trick Room with a Life Orb. However, Dusknoir is rather weak to begin with, and there are much better users of Trick Room out there, such as Slowking, Uxie, and Mesprit.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Dusknoir's list of checks and counters is quite long. The first notable Pokemon that can take on Dusknoir are Dark-types such as Absol, Crawdaunt, and Spiritomb. These Pokemon can deal significant damage to Dusknoir but must be wary of Will-O-Wisp. In the same vein, Ghost-types such as Golurk and Rotom can both hit Dusknoir very hard and shrug off anything Dusknoir has to offer outside of the odd Shadow Punch. Strong special attackers such as Magmortar, Sceptile, Omastar, and especially Moltres can take down Dusknoir rather easily, as they don't care about Will-O-Wisp and hit it extremely hard. Taunt and Substitute are also great ways to stop Dusknoir, as they block Will-O-Wisp or Pain Split, and any users of the move can either set up or start wearing Dusknoir down. Drapion, Qwilfish, and Mandibuzz are all good examples of this. Fire-types in general can come in on Will-O-Wisp or Fire Punch and ravage it with their attacks, but they must be wary of Earthquake. Sigilyph can use Dusknoir as setup fodder and either burn it or simply hit it hard depending on its set. Finally, inflicting poison or burn on it will steadily wear Dusknoir down to the point where it can easily be taken out by even moderately strong neutral attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>If you happen to be using Dusknoir, this is the set you should be running, as it is Dusknoir's best chance of standing out from its superior Ghost-type brethren. With its high defenses and usable Attack supported by its expansive movepool, Dusknoir can fulfill the role of a defensive spinblocker that can endure hits and dish them out decently. Will-O-Wisp is important to cripple physical attackers, especially Kabutops, aiding Dusknoir in its main job. Pain Split is unfortunately Dusknoir's only form of recovery, which is still rather unreliable. Fire Punch is chosen to put the hurt on Cryogonal, a Pokemon that Dusknoir is supposed to beat, and also dent common Pokemon such as Escavalier and Lilligant. Finally, Earthquake is chosen in the last moveslot to hit Kabutops and Fire-types trying to switch into Will-O-Wisp; it also has good coverage with Fire Punch. Although it's almost completely outclassed, Dusknoir can be used to the best of its abilities with this set.</p> <p>Maximum investment in HP and 248 Defense EVs help Dusknoir avoid being cleanly 2HKOed by Stone Edge from Kabutops even after Stealth Rock damage. The remaining Special Defense EVs ensure that Icicle Plate Cryogonal only 3HKOes Dusknoir with Ice Beam, and defensive variants only 4HKO. An Impish nature complements the Defense EVs perfectly, helping Dusknoir accomplish its spinblocking job better. Leftovers is Dusknoir's only source of recovery outside of Pain Split. Shadow Punch can be used over Fire Punch to hit Uxie, Mesprit, Sigilyph, and other opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types while also providing STAB. However, Fire Punch and Earthquake are almost non-negotiable.</p> <p>If you do happen to be using Dusknoir, it is best to pair it with a hazard user such as Roselia, Qwilfish, or Crustle to ensure its job as a spinblocker is beneficial to the team in at least some way. Pokemon such as Escavalier and Gallade can work to remove opposing Dark-types while benefiting from Dusknoir's ability to maintain hazards on the field. Absol works well, removing the Ghost-types that Dusknoir almost always struggles with. Clefable is useful for providing Wish and cleric support, helping Dusknoir last longer and also providing useful defensive synergy. Cryogonal or Kabutops are important to keep hazards off the field so that Dusknoir doesn't get worn down to the point where it can't spinblock. Let's face it, though—you really shouldn't be trying to support Dusknoir in the first place.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>At a glance, Emboar doesn't exactly seem to stand out. The last car on a train of potent Fire-types occupying RU, Emboar is found constantly vying for spots occupied by well-established powerhouses such as Entei and Moltres. However, Emboar retains several unique attributes that allow it to differentiate itself from its Fire-type brethren. Emboar's secondary Fighting typing not only grants it a potent secondary STAB attack for breaking through a variety of Pokemon, but also a neutrality to Stealth Rock, making it easier to switch in and out, as well as granting it an important resistance to Sucker Punch so that it can check Pokemon such as Absol and Spiritomb effectively. Emboar's 110 / 65 / 65 defenses are well suited for it, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Sceptile, Escavalier, and Durant, while also minimizing recoil damage.</p> <p>Notwithstanding, Emboar retains certain glaring flaws. Emboar's poor Speed tends to hold it back quite often, only marginally outpacing Sceptile when wielding a Choice Scarf. The vast majority of Emboar's movepool retains nasty side effects, ranging from recoil to stat drops, hurting its longevity and staying power. Moreover, with common Pokemon such as Slowking, Qwilfish, and Rhydon innately keeping it in check, Emboar has to rely on solid team support to function properly. Emboar can prove a dangerous threat and valuable asset to any team, though to do so it must receive proper support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Emboar has a rather expansive special movepool that includes Focus Blast, Fire Blast, Grass Knot, and even Scald, as well as a solid base 100 Special Attack to work with, though for the most part the surprise value and ability to overcome Alomomola isn't worth the drop in overall power that such a change mandates. Arm Thrust is an interesting option, as it offers Emboar the ability to OHKO Focus Sash users such as Smeargle and a Fighting-type STAB that doesn't reduce its stats, though its usefulness doesn't go far beyond that. Flame Charge can mitigate Emboar's mediocre Speed in a similar manner to Choice Scarf, but unlike Choice Scarf it requires a free turn to set up and is thus punished even more by Aqua Jet users or other faster Pokemon. Toxic is feasible for non-Choice Band sets, as it cripples Pokemon such as Slowking and Alomomola that can generally switch into Emboar repeatedly without too much hassle, though the fact that both such Pokemon have Regenerator to passively neutralize a few turns of Toxic damage while resetting the Toxic turns greatly devalues this.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-type Pokemon are the usually the best responses to Emboar, with Slowking, Poliwrath, Qwilfish, Quagsire, and Alomomola all being able to take everything but Choice Band-boosted Wild Charges fairly comfortably and pressure it with their STAB attacks (Quagsire being the exception as it's immune to even Wild Charge). Slowking and Alomomola in particular are very strong switch-ins, with Regenerator preventing them from being worn down as easily. As Emboar is vulnerable to every form of entry hazard and relies upon recoil moves as its primary source of damage, entry hazards are an excellent solution to limit its time on the field. Kabutops and Feraligatr can stomach Emboar's Flare Blitz well and threaten it with Aqua Jet, with the former capable of further capitalizing on Flare Blitz by ascertaining a Speed boost from Weak Armor. Druddigon takes on Emboar rather well, resisting all of Emboar's common attacks barring Superpower and damaging it with Rough Skin. Despite a weakness to Fighting-type attacks, Rhydon's excellent physical bulk allows it to shrug off everything barring Choice Band-boosted Superpowers and threatening Emboar with its powerful Earthquake. Uxie's natural bulk and resistance to Superpower means that it can switch into Emboar rather easily, from which point it can either paralyze it with Thunder Wave or immediately threaten it with a STAB Psychic. Emboar's lower base Speed means that even with a Choice Scarf it is only outspeeding Pokemon like Sceptile by a hair, meaning faster threats such as Swellow and Aerodactyl can easily revenge kill it.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>By utilizing a Choice Scarf, Emboar is capable of mitigating its low base Speed to become a dangerous immediate attacker. Though a Choice Scarf does not by any means make Emboar exceedingly fast, only achieving a Speed of 376, it does allow Emboar to outpace and threaten several common and dangerous Pokemon, such as Sceptile, Durant, and Jynx, with ease. Flare Blitz is Emboar's STAB move of choice, hitting many common Pokemon hard and allowing Emboar to threaten bulky Pokemon such as Tangrowth. Superpower offers a high-powered secondary STAB move for Emboar, providing respectable neutral coverage alongside Flare Blitz, as well as hitting Rock-types particularly hard. Wild Charge rounds off Emboar's coverage, allowing it to hit Slowking, Qwilfish, and Moltres hard, while also generally hitting bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath consistently, allowing Emboar to KO it after a little prior damage. With its bases covered in terms of coverage, Emboar can reinforce its ability to switch into common sleep inducers such as Lilligant and Jynx with Sleep Talk.</p> <p>In terms of alternative moves, Head Smash can be utilized to punish Fire-types attempting to switch into Emboar as well as breaking through moderately bulky Flying-types such as Sigilyph that can take a single Flare Blitz or Wild Charge, though Stealth Rock does help wear down most of these Pokemon to the point where they can be dispatched by other means. Fire Punch is also a solid alternative, providing Emboar a Fire-type STAB lacking recoil, improving its survivability mid-game. Earthquake is capable of hitting Fire-types that switch into Flare Blitz and the Poison-types that switch into Superpower such as Drapion and Qwilfish, making it worthwhile if only as a \"safe\" attacking move.</p> <p>Emboar appreciates Grass-types for their ability to wear down bulky Water-types for it, Sceptile and Amoonguss being two pertinent examples. Electric-types such as Rotom are also quite useful, being able to threaten common Pokemon that resist Emboar's STAB attacks as well as offering a respectable pivot to fall back on when Emboar is threatened by speedy Flying-types. Emboar functions very well in a Fire / Water / Grass core, and accordingly Water-types such as Feraligatr and Kabutops make solid partners, wearing down opposing Water-types and taking advantage of Emboar's ability to wear down Grass-types for them.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Combined with its impressive 123 base Attack, high-powered attacks, and the Choice Band, Emboar becomes an incredibly potent wallbreaker. Emboar's Choice Band-boosted Flare Blitz is ridiculously powerful, hitting even harder than Entei's, and is capable of breaking through the vast majority of Pokemon. Superpower complements Flare Blitz very well, allowing Emboar to maintain solid neutral coverage against a variety of Pokemon, as well breaking through bulky Rock-types such as Regirock. Wild Charge allows Emboar to hit bulky Water-types without the stat drops of Superpower, as well as hitting Pokemon such as Moltres that resist its dual STAB. Sleep Talk is a useful tool for Emboar to switch into sleep inducing Grass-types such as Lilligant, allowing it to absorb the sleep and retain a solid chance to OHKO it the next turn with either Superpower or Flare Blitz.</p> <p>With 20 Speed EVs, Emboar is capable of outpacing minimum Speed Lanturn, allowing it to 2HKO with Superpower before it can hit back, and the remaining EVs are invested in HP to allow Emboar to take hits and recoil damage better. However, Emboar can bump up its Speed investment to outpace other defensive Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Qwilfish. Moreover, though it does not improve its wallbreaking capabilities, Emboar can run a spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature to outpace Adamant Absol. Head Smash can be used to more definitively take on Fire-types, though for the most part they cannot stomach unresisted hits from Emboar after Stealth Rock damage. Fire Punch offers a reasonably powerful Fire-type STAB that doesn't sap Emboar's HP with recoil damage.</p> <p>Since Choice Band Emboar has no real \"counters\" in the strictest sense of the word, partners for Emboar are largely Pokemon who can take advantage of its wallbreaking capabilities. Flying-types such as Swellow and Braviary appreciate Emboar's ability to break through Rock- and Steel-types, allowing them to take advantage of STAB attacks. Additionally, Water-type sweepers such as Kabutops and Feraligatr appreciate Emboar's ability to draw in and wear down Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Slowking to prepare a sweep. Emboar also provides a solid switch-in to Rotom-C and specially oriented Sceptile, which both Kabutops and Feraligatr fear. Emboar is one of the better Pokemon for stacking Fire-types, as it lacks the Stealth Rock weakness of other Fire-types and thus is less reliant on Rapid Spin support to perform at optimal capacity, making it a potent partner for Entei, with very few Pokemon being capable of taking the brunt of both Pokemon's attacks continuously.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Emboar is most commonly seen using its incredible Attack stat with its high Base Power physical attacks, you shouldn't forget that Emboar has a solid Special Attack stat with some great special attacks as well. This set aims to use Emboar's often overlooked Special Attack stat to catch some conventional counters to Emboar off guard without giving up Emboar's ability to check the likes of Escavalier and Absol.</p> <p>Fire Blast lets Emboar beat Steelix, Tangrowth, and even Qwilfish without taking recoil damage, as they are all either OHKOed or 2HKOed. Stealth Rock support is needed to 2HKO Qwilfish, however. Superpower hits Pokemon such as Entei and opposing Emboar hard and is also Emboar's best bet against incoming Lanturn. The stat drops aren't nearly as detrimental to this set due to Emboar's larger reliance on special attacks. Grass Knot deals with the physical walls that Fire Blast cannot; Poliwrath, Rhydon, and Alomomola are all hit incredibly hard while defensive Slowking is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. The last slot either reinforces Emboar's coverage or gives it some added utility. Wild Charge is generally preferred for the more consistent hit on Slowking and Qwilfish, but Emboar will need Stealth Rock support in order to 2HKO Slowking. It also gives Emboar a way to KO Moltres on the switch with Stealth Rock support, as it walls this set otherwise. Sleep Talk is a viable option as well, as Emboar matches up well against most sleep inducers in the tier. However, do note that Emboar lacks the Speed and bulk that its other sets have, which can sometimes hurt it when trying to absorb sleep and still defeat its inducer.</p> <p>The nature and EV spread aim to get the most out of Emboar's solid Special Attack stat. 184 Speed EVs are required to outspeed defensive Qwilfish and ensure Emboar can land two hits on it before being hit with a possible Waterfall. The remaining EVs go into Attack to pump up Superpower and Wild Charge. A Rash nature is used so Emboar's physical bulk isn't compromised, thus allowing it to still deal with Escavalier and Spiritomb relatively well. Expert Belt is the recommended hold item for mixed Emboar, as it has great super effective coverage and is able to bluff a Choice item very well. For example, it can predict a Slowking switch-in with Wild Charge and then surprise an incoming Pokemon with an Electric-type immunity, such as Rhydon or Manectric, with the appropriate move. However, Life Orb is a possibility for a more consistent power boost. Be sure to watch Wild Charge usage with Life Orb though, as the combined recoil will quickly take its toll on Emboar if it's used too excessively. Hidden Power Ice is the most notable other option to consider for this set, as it can handle Druddigon. Hidden Power Electric can be used if you desire an OHKO on Qwilfish after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Finally, Earthquake is able to 2HKO Lanturn. However, Superpower will generally handle it well enough over time anyway due to Lanturn's lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p>Like with any other offensive Pokemon, Emboar appreciates Stealth Rock support to turn many 3HKOs into 2HKOs. With Stealth Rock support, Emboar is able to 2HKO Qwilfish with Fire Blast and 2HKO Slowking with Wild Charge. Offensive teams can turn to the likes of Omastar, Smeargle, and Crustle for early-game Stealth Rock support, and more balanced teams can find Golurk, Rhydon, and Druddigon to be effective. Mesprit is perhaps the most notable Stealth Rock user due to its ability to get Emboar in safely with U-turn, as it commonly draws out the likes of Steelix and Absol for Emboar to handle. Emboar struggles with Uxie and Mesprit, as it can't immediately overwhelm them nor can it outspeed them. For this reason, Escavalier makes for a fine partner; not only can it trap these Psychic-types with Pursuit, but it can also run Sleep Talk so Emboar doesn't have to worry about having to use it. Gallade is a great offensive partner for this set as Emboar can lure in and 2HKO Slowking, one of Gallade's most prominent checks. If Emboar decides to use a Life Orb, then Rapid Spin support from Kabutops can be a worthy addition to ensure Emboar doesn't wear down too quickly. Because this Emboar is able to handle most physical walls in RU, fast physical attackers are great teammates to take advantage of the holes it punches into the opposing team. With Steelix and Rhydon out of the way, Swellow and Choice Scarf Braviary will have few problems with going on a late-game sweep. If Emboar is able to successfully eliminate Tangrowth, then Rock Polish Torterra becomes a very terrifying foe to face, while a fallen Qwilfish or Poliwrath will make Durant's life much easier. Fast special attackers can also be effective; Sceptile, Galvantula, Choice Scarf Rotom-C, and Shell Smash Omastar all appreciate special walls being weakened or outright KOed.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Emboar is often seen as an offensive Fire-type due to its fantastic STAB combination and coverage, people often overlook its 110 / 65 / 65 defenses and great defensive typing, which allow defensive variants to check a surprising number of threats. Unlike some its fellow Fire-types that can be used defensively, such as Entei and Moltres, Emboar is not weak to Stealth Rock, which means that it is significantly more difficult to wear down throughout the match, and since entry hazards are omnipresent in RU, this gives Emboar a very distinct advantage over its competitors. Together, these factors make this variant of Emboar a worthy addition to any Fire / Water / Grass core in need of a solid check to threats such as Durant, Escavalier, Lilligant, Accelgor, and Klinklang.</p> <p>While their side effects might be off-putting, Flare Blitz and Superpower are Emboar's best STABs for this set, as they are simply the strongest physical attacks that Emboar has at its disposal. Though attacks such as Fire Punch and Brick Break might seem more appealing due to their lack of negative effects, Flare Blitz and Superpower give Emboar some much-needed power to make up for this set's lack of offensive investment, and let it do serious damage to the Pokemon that might attempt to switch in on it. Will-O-Wisp is a huge part of this set's effectiveness, as it allows Emboar to neuter physically offensive threats, allowing it to take their attacks with greater ease. Furthermore, Will-O-Wisp is incredibly effective against many of Emboar's common switch-ins, such as Rhydon, Feraligatr, Kabutops, Aerodactyl, and Druddigon, as these Pokemon will typically switch in expecting one of Emboar's STAB moves, only to be quickly crippled by a burn. Finally, Protect rounds off this set by allowing Emboar to scout for dangerous moves, as well as giving it a crucial extra turn of Leftovers recovery. While this might not seem that important, Protect also lets Emboar play mindgames with the opponent, and the extra turn of Leftovers recovery can occasionally cause Emboar to move out of KO range from certain attacks.</p> <p>A physically defensive spread is generally best for defensive Emboar, as it lets Emboar take on the biggest range of threats, including Durant and Escavalier, which are otherwise fairly difficult to check. A physically defensive spread also allows Emboar to survive a slew of powerful attacks from strong, physically offensive Pokemon and retaliate with Will-O-Wisp to cripple them for the rest of the match. However, a specially defensive spread is also a viable option, as it allows Emboar to check the likes of Lilligant and Sceptile with greater effectiveness while still acting as a decent answer to Durant and Escavalier. However, Durant and Escavalier are far more difficult to answer effectively, and as RU is largely dominated by physically offensive threats rather than specially based ones, a physically defensive spread will generally prove to be the better option.</p> <p>Due to Emboar's incredibly vast movepool, there are a plethora of options that one can use over the suggested moves. For starters, if you really dislike the negative effects of Superpower and Flare Blitz, Hammer Arm and Fire Punch are viable options, though Fire Punch is noticeably weaker and Hammer Arm might miss in crucial situations. Alternatively, you can replace Will-O-Wisp with Toxic in order to lure in and cripple defensive Water-types such as Alomomola and Slowking; however, this means that Emboar can't cripple Druddigon and other physical attackers anymore and that Qwilfish can switch in without any threat. Finally, if you do not find the extra Leftovers recovery from Protect particularly useful, you can replace it with Roar in order to deter setup sweepers, Wild Charge to somewhat threaten Moltres and Slowking on the switch, or Taunt to prevent the likes of Alomomola from passing Wishes as easily.</p> <p>Defensive Water-types such as Qwilfish, Alomomola, and Slowking give this set huge problems, as it cannot do anything to them barring a burn from Will-O-Wisp, and they can proceed to either threaten it with their STAB Water-type attacks or support their team by setting up hazards or passing huge Wishes to their teammates. To make up for this, it is recommended that you support Emboar with Grass-type Pokemon such as Sceptile, Lilligant, Rotom-C, and Roselia in order to take advantage of the defensive Water-types that Emboar tends to lure in so effectively. Furthermore, while Emboar has fantastic physical bulk, its weaknesses mean that it cannot effectively check certain physical threats, in particular Ground- and Flying-type ones such as Golurk and Braviary. In order to make up for this shortcoming, it is recommended to pair Emboar with another physical wall that can cover the threats it is unable to beat. Alomomola is particularly effective, since it is also able to pass huge Wishes to Emboar, which helps make up for the latter's lack of reliable recovery. In general, this Emboar fits best on a balanced Fire / Water / Grass core, as these cores are able to effectively cover most of Emboar's weaknesses.</p> "

  "Samurott": {
    "overview": "<p>Samurott is one of the few Water-types that can hit hard physically and specially, making it unpredictable because each set has its own counters. It has a usable movepool on both sides, as well as Swords Dance, to limit the amount of Pokemon that can wall it, including access to moves such as Megahorn, which are rarely seen on a Pokemon of its type. Thanks to its above-average defenses, it also can take a hit or two when it needs to, even without any investment. Despite these quirks, Samurott is a bit slow and often finds itself outpaced, a problem considering it has no way to boost its Speed. The individual sets suffer from a bit of competition with other Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Slowking, which have similar options. Despite its status as an NU Pokemon, Samurott is a threat to watch out for in RU.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Samurott has a few other options to consider. Samurott's physical bulk is fairly good, being equal to that of Quagsire's, and its access to moves such as Scald, Encore, and Dragon Tail are interesting, but a lack of recovery and good defensive ability results in it being outclassed most of the time by other bulky Water-types. A Choice Band allows Samurott to hit hard immediately, but its movepool isn't really enough to fit in a Choice set on the physical side; using Choice Specs results in a similar fate. Return is interesting because it creates Water + Normal coverage, which is resisted only by Ferroseed and Shedinja in RU, but Feraligatr's higher Attack stat makes this option outclassed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>To deal with Samurott you first must know what set it is running, and even from there many Pokemon must be careful if they switch into the wrong move. In general, Grass-types stand out as the best checks due to their resistance to Samurott's STAB. Ferroseed is arguably the best option to take down Samurott, as it can take all hits aside from the rare Superpower with ease and wear it down with Leech Seed or set up entry hazards. Other Grass-types need to be careful about Ice Beam and Megahorn, but faster ones such as Sceptile, Rotom-C, and Lilligant can destroy Samurott with their STAB moves and also resist Aqua Jet, making them decent checks to both variants of Samurott. Although Samurott can hit Amoonguss hard with Ice Beam, Amoonguss can use Spore to temporarily shut down Samurott or heal itself with Giga Drain.</p> <p>The mixed attacker set is particularly difficult to deal with due to its great coverage, but Lanturn has an easy time dealing with it due to its resistance to Water- and Ice-type moves, its light weight reducing Grass Knot's power, and its Special Defense ensuring that even Hidden Power Grass won't be doing much. It is also not weak to any other coverage move Samurott has. Electric-types such as Manectric and Rotom cannot switch into Samurott due to their general frailty, but they can easily OHKO Samurott with Thunderbolt thanks to its relatively low Special Defense. Due to a high Special Defense, Roselia takes hits fairly easily from the mixed attacker, including Ice Beam, and it lacks a weakness to Megahorn as well. The Swords Dance set is arguably a bit easier to defeat, although a +2 Aqua Jet, possibly backed up by Torrent, ensures Electric-types cannot revenge kill it without taking tons of damage. Thanks to Intimidate and its resistance to Megahorn, Qwilfish walls this particular Samurott and can paralyze it or set up entry hazards—note that despite not being weak to anything the mixed attacker has, Hydro Pump can actually 2HKO 252/0 Qwilfish despite the resistance! Poliwrath is similar to Qwilfish, and although it cannot inflict a status on Samurott, it gets healed by its Water-type STAB and can phaze out Samurott, ridding it of its Swords Dance boosts. Finally, although Altaria is not seen often in RU, its good Defense and resistance to both Waterfall and Megahorn mean that Altaria can set up on or wall Samurott lacking Ice Beam.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Samurott's great Special Attack and good coverage, backed by a decent Attack stat, makes Samurott a fearsome wallbreaker that is difficult to switch into. While its Speed isn't that great, it's enough to outspeed many of the Pokemon within the tier, including almost all walls and neutral natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Kabutops and Gallade. Hydro Pump is the main STAB option here as it powers through many Pokemon in the tier with ease. Grass Knot's power is inconsistent, but most of the Water-types in the tier, such as Poliwrath and Feraligatr, will be hit harder by Grass Knot than Hidden Power Grass. However, if Lanturn, which is lighter, is an annoyance, Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit it hard. If these Pokemon aren't an issue, Samurott can use Aqua Jet to revenge kill foes such as Magmortar and Moltres. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Dragon-types, both of which resist the combination of Grass and Water, for super effective damage. The final slot is used for a physical option. Megahorn hits the many Psychic-types in the tier, such as Uxie and Jynx, very hard, while also hitting Slowking harder than Grass Knot. However, if these Pokemon are not a concern, Samurott can use Superpower in order to blast through Clefable and Ferroseed, which would otherwise completely wall this set.</p> <p>Naive is the preferred nature to get the jump on neutral natured base 80s. In addition, because almost all Grass- and Electric-type moves are used on the special side, it's better to lose special bulk than physical. The EV spread allows Samurott to 2HKO Roselia and 252 HP Gallade with Megahorn and 2HKO Qwilfish with Hydro Pump. If accuracy is an issue, then Surf can be used, but its lack of power compared to Hydro Pump makes it much less appealing. In addition, Samurott can be an effective stallbreaker with Taunt, and if used over a physical move, then a Timid nature is recommended. However, note that stall is not a very common playstyle in RU at the moment due to the many powerful Pokemon in the tier.</p> <p>As Samurott tends to force a lot of switches, entry hazard support is useful. Also, there are a few Grass-types, such as Lilligant and Sceptile, which can outspeed and OHKO. Roselia is a great defensive partner that can use Spikes to wear down switch-ins and can easily deal with Grass-types thanks to its typing, Natural Cure, great Special Defense, and STAB Sludge Bomb to hit them hard. As for offensive partners, Flying-types such as Braviary and Swellow can destroy Grass-types with their STAB Brave Bird. In return, Samurott hits Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon very hard with Hydro Pump, allowing both of them to have a much easier time sweeping or wallbreaking. If Superpower can't find its way onto the set, Magneton is a good partner because it can trap and kill Ferroseed thanks to Magnet Pull while enjoying the threat Samurott poses to Ground-type Pokemon. Finally, Druddigon is a good partner for Samurott as well thanks to its rare Dragon-type resistances to Electric and Grass, and with its stellar bulk, it covers up Samurott's weaknesses nicely.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Usually, when you think of a Swords Dance using Water-type in RU, you think of Feraligatr or Kabutops, as the former has a better bulk while the latter gets STAB Stone Edge, and both are stronger and faster. However, Samurott has one trick up its sleeve; Megahorn. With this move, Samurott can get past Grass-types far more easily, meaning Pokemon such as Tangrowth cannot wall it—assuming it has a Life Orb, it OHKOes Tangrowth at +2. Water and Bug also gets good neutral coverage, with only a few Pokemon resisting the combination, many of which are irrelevant in RU.</p> <p>Other than that, Samurott functions fairly similar to the other two Pokemon. Swords Dance allows Samurott to get a boost and obtain 598 Attack at +2. Waterfall demolishes any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, and Aqua Jet picks off faster foes. Thanks to Torrent, Samurott hits a lot harder when at low health with its Water-type moves, allowing it to destroy Pokemon that could have previously taken its hits. Megahorn, as mentioned before, is the advantage of using this set—hitting as hard as a STAB Waterfall on neutral targets, and it is a powerful move that blasts through Psychic-types and especially Grass-types.</p> <p>A Jolly Nature is used to outspeed Pokemon around base 80 Speed that usually don't use a boosting nature, including Kabutops and Gallade, but due to the fact that it is usually using a priority move, an Adamant nature gives Aqua Jet more of a sting, boosting the chance to OHKO Manectric after Stealth Rock from 18.75% to 75%. The choice of item depends on the circumstances. Generally, a Life Orb is more useful because it makes Samurott harder to switch into and helps it pick off foes with Aqua Jet, but a Lum Berry lets it avoid a crippling burn or paralysis. Although Waterfall is slightly more powerful, Razor Shell is a good option when it comes to Water STAB as well, trading a small amount of Base Power and accuracy for a 50% chance of cutting the opponent's Defense stat when used. Using Mystic Water is a viable alternative because two of the three attacking moves are Water-type moves, but Samurott needs a Life Orb to put more of a dent in Pokemon such as Uxie and Tangrowth with Megahorn.</p> <p>If you are using a Lum Berry, Stealth Rock is needed to ensure the OHKO on Tangrowth, and even with a Life Orb it appreciates Stealth Rock to pick off frailer Pokemon, such as Manectric, more easily with Aqua Jet. Golurk stands out as a good partner, as it is immune to Electric-type moves, can set up Stealth Rock, and threatens Qwilfish (which walls this set) with a strong Earthquake. Grass-types neutral to Megahorn, such as Amoonguss and Ferroseed, can also wall this set. Due to this, Fire-types in general, such as Magmortar or Entei, are helpful to get past Grass-type Pokemon, especially considering many of them are faster and cannot be easily revenge killed by Aqua Jet due to their resistance. Bouffalant is also a good option to take down Grass-types because it gets a boost from Grass moves thanks to Sap Sipper. Ironically, Grass-types such as Rotom-C and Sceptile can be good partners for Samurott, as they can get past bulky Water-types such as Qwilfish and Poliwrath that can wall Samurott, and in return Samurott can use Fire-types as setup fodder as they flee from a predicted Aqua Jet.</p> "

  "Seismitoad": {
    "overview": "<p>Seismitoad is a rather unique Water-type Pokemon in that it can be played in a variety of different ways. Seismitoad can go on the offensive as a rain sweeper or go on a more defensive route with its good typing and set up Stealth Rock for its team. It is also a good check to several Water-types in the tier by utilizing Water Absorb and Substitute. Seismitoad's typing comes with several benefits: Seismitoad can't be paralyzed by Thunder Wave, so its rain sweep will not be ruined, and while on the defensive, it gives Seismitoad good resistances to some of the most common offensive types, such as Rock and Fire. However, a mediocre movepool and average stats bring Seismitoad down a bit. It doesn't hit super hard with its moves unless they're boosted by Life Orb and rain, while its coverage is limited to Sludge Wave and Grass Knot to hit Water- and Grass-types that resist Seismitoad's Water-type STAB. A lack of reliable recovery also makes it hard for Seismitoad to take repeated hits, while other bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Slowking give it huge competition due to that reason. All in all, Seismitoad's unique assets in the roles it plays is definitely something to take into consideration.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Seismitoad's other options are rather limited, especially those that it can make good use of. Hidden Power Ice can also work to hit Druddigon and other Dragon-types for super effective damage while still covering Grass-types. However, the power difference between it and Sludge Wave is huge, and Hidden Power Ice doesn't hit Druddigon much harder than Earth Power. Icy Wind can also be used, but it's a better option for the Substitute and defensive sets, as it is more of a supportive move than an offensive one. Hidden Power Fire can help the physically defensive set by hitting Escavalier and Durant for super effective damage. However, fitting it onto Seismitoad can be quite hard, and if you forgo a specific move, a teammate must compensate for the loss of coverage or answers to certain threats. Venoshock can be a solid option if Seismitoad has Toxic Spikes support, as it will become significantly more powerful than Sludge Wave if the opponent is poisoned. However, this can become a huge gamble, and it makes it so that Rotom-C can easily revenge kill Seismitoad unless it has been poisoned by Toxic, as Rotom-C is immune to Toxic Spikes. To compensate for Seismitoad's lack of recovery, Rest and Sleep Talk can be used, but much like Hidden Power Fire, it can be hard fit these two moves onto the set without losing crucial options. Refresh can be easier to fit onto the defensive set, however, as it can remove any unwanted status from Seismitoad, increasing its longevity. Lastly, Seismitoad can go on a physically offensive route as well with its equally high base Attack. Seismitoad has a good variety of moves to choose from, such as Earthquake, Ice Punch, Drain Punch, Bounce, and Rock Slide, but it has no physical Water-type STAB. This makes a physically oriented Swift Swim Sweeper implausible, so its best bet is either a Choice Band or Life Orb set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Slowking is one of the best answers to Seismitoad. Even if Seismitoad uses Grass Knot it will have a hard time taking Slowking down. However, Slowking will have a harder time against the Substitute and defensive sets, as Toxic will quickly wear it down and it will most likely need Toxic itself to beat Seismitoad if Slowking doesn't run Psychic or Psyshock. Most Grass-types will more or less beat Seismitoad. The more offensively inclined Sceptile, Lilligant, and Rotom-C will have no trouble beating the slower sets with their super effective STABs, but will most likely lose to the Swift Swim sweeper. However, if the rain is stopped, all three will outspeed Seismitoad, so waiting out the rain can definitely help. Tangrowth can deal with the defensive version with relative ease, but it will most likely be hit by Toxic before taking Seismitoad down, severely crippling it. Amoonguss is a 100% guaranteed counter to any Seismitoad. Amoonguss's Poison typing makes it immune to Toxic so it can't be stalled out, while it is only hit super effectively by Hidden Power, making it near impossible to take down for Seismitoad. The same applies for Roselia, as it shares the same typing with Amoonguss and has great bulk thanks to Eviolite. Also, Pokemon that use Grass-type moves for coverage, such as Moltres and Manectric with Hidden Power Grass and Galvantula with Giga Drain, will easily OHKO Seismitoad. The only exception is Choice Scarf Manectric's Hidden Power Grass, as it will surprisingly only do 95% damage at most to defensive Seismitoad. Druddigon can be a real problem for Seismitoad, regardless of the set. Offensive Seismitoad can only hope to 2HKO Druddigon with Earth Power, while defensive Seismitoad can only hope for Scald burning Druddigon as it is easily 2HKOed by Outrage. Escavalier and Durant are very similar. They can 2HKO defensive Seismitoad, but they are both OHKOed by Hydro Pump in rain; however, Stealth Rock is needed for Escavalier. Other Pokemon that can use brute force to break through Seismitoad include, but are not limited to, Gallade, Medicham, Hitmonlee, and Bouffalant, if they can avoid being burned by Scald.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<p>Seismitoad makes for a solid defensive Pokemon due to its impressive bulk and good typing. Its Water / Ground typing gives it several good resistances and two useful immunities in combination with Water Absorb, allowing Seismitoad to check various threats in the tier such as Kabutops and Entei, while even walling the likes of Magneton and Lanturn. This gives Seismitoad many good opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Scald is a great STAB for any defensive Water-type, as the high burn chance will greatly improve Seismitoad's survivability. Earth Power does not only provide a great secondary STAB move, allowing Seismitoad to hit Pokemon that resist Scald like Druddigon and Slowking harder, but is also crucial for its ability to deal with Lanturn so well. Toxic rounds out this set by giving Seismitoad a solid option for dealing with defensive threats such as Alomomola and the aforementioned Slowking a lot easier, as Earth Power will never be enough to beat them.</p> <p>Seismitoad's options are rather limited to what's already been mentioned. However, Knock Off can be useful to make Eviolite and Leftovers users easier to handle. Knock Off will be mostly used against Ferroseed and Tangrowth, but the occasional Misdreavus and Mandibuzz can be severely neutered by it. Protect can also be useful, as it can help Seismitoad recover more HP with Leftovers while it works great in tandem with Toxic when it comes to stalling the opponent. With the given spread, Seismitoad is able to outspeed Adamant Aggron with max Speed while it ties with Steel trapper Magneton that aim for the same Speed mark. Seismitoad can use a faster EV spread of 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 Spe to outspeed certain Pokemon so it can avoid taking an unnecessary hit before dealing one itself, while still retaining most of its bulk. 104 Speed EVs allows Seismitoad to outspeed neutral base 55 Speed Pokemon with max Speed, such as Modest Omastar, Adamant Bouffalant, and Adamant Crawdaunt. This is particularly useful for Pokemon like Omastar, as it means Seismitoad can KO or severely cripple them before they can set up. Seismitoad is also able to outspeed Qwilfish with no Speed investment, while hitting the same Speed as Qwilfish with 16 Speed EVs, as they aim to outspeed the same Pokemon. Seismitoad can also be specially defensive, but Grass is a commonly seen special attacking type meaning Seismitoad will be 2HKOed at worst by a number of Pokemon, so it's not recommended.</p> <p>Seismitoad's typing does bring a 4x weakness to Grass-type moves, so Pokemon that can deal with threats that use moves of this type make for great teammates. Fire-types, Emboar, Moltres, Entei, and Magmortar to be more specific, make for great answers to Grass-type Pokemon. They also pair well with Seismitoad as it can take care of most Water-types with ease, especially Kabutops, the most threatening one. Magmortar gets a special mention as it is immune to Spore and Sleep Powder thanks to Vital Spirit, making it the most effective answer to Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Adding a Grass-type to your team gives you a nice Fire / Water / Grass core; Amoonguss can become a good complement defensively, while Lilligant gives you a more offensive option. Sap Sipper Pokemon, most notably Bouffalant and Miltank, can also help against Grass-types and other Pokemon using Grass-type moves. Miltank also complements Seismitoad's physical defense with a specially defensive set. However, an offensive version of Miltank works just as well. Sawsbuck is another good candidate, especially since it can be a part of a Fire / Water / Grass core while being able to pass its Attack boosts with Baton Pass.</p> <p>While Seismitoad is bulky, there are a few Pokemon that can break through it with brute force. Gallade, Medicham, and Hitmonlee are Fighting-types that can do just that. This means Spiritomb pairs well with Seismitoad, especially a more specially defensive version, as it can break down these Fighting-types with relative ease. Spiritomb is also good at dealing with Slowking, and even Amoonguss if Spiritomb uses a RestTalk set, two Pokemon that can give Seismitoad a lot of trouble. Escavalier and Durant fall into this category as well. Again, Fire-types are the easiest solution, more specifically Choice Scarf Emboar. Choice Scarf Electric-types, in this case Manectric and Rotom-C who can run Fire-type moves, handle Durant as well. Using either of the three mentioned Pokemon makes Sceptile easier to deal with as well. When it comes to Pokemon that benefit from Seismitoad's support, it's pretty straightforward. Grass-types that fear the likes of Entei will greatly appreciate Seismitoad's typing. The same goes for physically frail Pokemon and Fire-types that fear Kabutops, and Steel- and Water-types that have trouble with Magneton and Lanturn.</p> "

        "name": "Swift Swim Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>This is Seismitoad's best bet on the offensive. Seismitoad as a rain sweeper is pretty straightforward, but it has a key difference from other Swift Swim Sweepers. Its Ground typing makes Seismitoad immune to Electric-type moves. Not only does it remove a weakness to the type, but also keeps Seismitoad from being paralyzed by Thunder Wave, something that would otherwise stop any Pokemon from sweeping through a team. Hydro Pump gives Seismitoad much-needed power, as Surf does not cut it. This is the move Seismitoad will most likely use the most in the rain, as it will OHKO nearly everything that doesn't resist it. Earth Power adds a secondary STAB move for Seismitoad to use, and it will dent most things that resist Hydro Pump. Sludge Wave rounds out Seismitoad's coverage, as it allows Seismitoad to hit Grass-types that resist its STAB moves. Sludge Wave will OHKO every Grass-type bar Amoonguss; the chances of Sceptile, Lilligant, and Rotom-C surviving it are really slim. When it comes to Seismitoad's final move, it really depends on how the rest of the team is shaped, although it shouldn't matter much which move you pick. Rain Dance is the slightly more useful choice. Rain Dance allows Seismitoad to keep its sweep going without switching to another Pokemon; however, Grass Knot does allow Seismitoad to hit certain threats, such as Slowking and Poliwrath, slightly harder than with Earth Power.</p> <p>Surf can be used over Hydro Pump for a more consistent move with more PP, but the power drop is noticeable as OHKOs against the likes of Escavalier are turned into 2HKOs, so keep that in mind. Focus Blast can be used as a faster way to take down Ferroseed, as it is immune to Sludge Wave. However, Ferroseed can't do much back to Seismitoad as Thunder Wave doesn't affect it and Seismitoad resists Gyro Ball, so Earth Power is usually enough to break through Ferroseed. When it comes to teammates, Seismitoad only needs help with a few things. The first are teammates that can set up rain. Uxie is one of the more consistent Pokemon to choose from, as it can usually set up rain twice or more thanks to its great bulk. On top of that, Uxie can also set up Stealth Rock. Rotom-C can also be effective in this role, as it helps in covering Seismitoad's Grass weakness while also taking care of Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Alomomola with little effort. Mesprit is a slightly less bulky version of Uxie, but brings a more offensive presence to the field with its higher attacking stats. Druddigon pairs well with Seismitoad as well, as its Dragon typing gives it a nice resistance to Grass-type moves while also having the ability to set up Stealth Rock that will help Seismitoad OHKO Escavalier with Hydro Pump in the rain. Druddigon can help in taking care of opposing Druddigon as well, as Seismitoad is only able to 2HKO them with Earth Power. Escavalier not only packs a nice Grass resistance, but has the ability to reliably take care of Slowking, one of the most problematic Pokemon for Seismitoad. Absol and Spiritomb are also good at this, but lack the same type synergy with Seismitoad. Other Electric-types besides Rotom-C, such as Manectric, Galvantula, and Rotom, make for good teammates as well, as they can easily deal with most Water-types in the tier, most notably Alomomola and Slowking.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Water Absorb and Seismitoad's good typing to make it a great check to Water-types, as well as a lure to Grass-types and other Pokemon that would naturally switch in on Seismitoad. Substitute allows Seismitoad to avoid any kind of status that might hinder it, while it also acts as a buffer against attacks that would KO it, giving Seismitoad a chance to potentially KO Pokemon such as Sceptile and Moltres. Setting up a Substitute isn't impossible either, as Seismitoad will cause a lot of switching against Pokemon like Lanturn, Magneton, and Kabutops. Earth Power will be Seismitoad's most useful STAB move, as with it Seismitoad can OHKO Kabutops, Magneton, and Omastar, while dealing a good chunk of damage to Pokemon such as Lanturn. Surf provides a great secondary STAB move for Seismitoad to use against Pokemon that resist Earth Power, and will hit Pokemon like Entei and Steelix a bit harder. Sludge Bomb gives Seismitoad something to hit Grass-types, mostly slower ones such as Tangrowth, but it can also help KO faster ones such as Lilligant and Sceptile if Seismitoad has a Substitute up. A 30% chance to poison the foe is really nice too, as it can make Pokemon like Slowking easier to deal with. However, Toxic is a better option if you want a more reliable way to deal with Pokemon such as Alomomola, Cryogonal, and the aforementioned Slowking. This does, however, make Seismitoad more susceptible to Grass-types.</p> <p>Hydro Pump can be used over Surf for a more powerful STAB move, but beware of the lowered accuracy. In the same vein, Sludge Wave can be used over Sludge Bomb for slightly more power, but Sludge Bomb's 30% chance to poison the foe is preferred over Sludge Wave's 10% and five points higher Base Power. The EV spread and the Timid nature are used to allow Seismitoad to outspeed Adamant Kabutops by one point. This makes it so that Seismitoad can OHKO Kabutops before taking any unnecessary damage. As this set is meant to be used as a way to deal with Water-types, Pokemon that have trouble with them should be paired with Seismitoad. Durant has serious trouble with Qwilfish as its Intimidate and Thunder Wave can severely cripple Durant. Seismitoad should have no trouble KOing Qwilfish with Earth Power, giving Durant a big opening for a sweep. Seismitoad can also take care of Steelix, another Pokemon that gives Durant trouble. Fire-types that have trouble with Kabutops and Lanturn, such as Entei and Moltres, appreciate Seismitoad's help. Seismitoad should be immune to or resist both Pokemon's commonly used moves, and can proceed to KO them with ease; Lanturn might be using Ice Beam at times. Slowking is also a common switch-in to Seismitoad, meaning that Seismitoad can either poison it with Toxic or switch to a teammate such as Spiritomb, Escavalier, or Absol with no worries and trap Slowking with Pursuit mindgames. Seismitoad will also lure out Grass-types, which could give Fire-types, Pokemon such as Druddigon and Escavalier, and Sap Sipper Pokemon like Sawsbuck a free switch in and an opportunity to set up. Grass-types such as Lilligant can also take advantage of this.</p> "

  "Scolipede": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its large appearance, Scolipede is actually one of the fastest Pokemon in RU, sitting at a high 112 base Speed only shared with the rare Purugly. In addition to this, Scolipede is one of the few Pokemon with access to Spikes and has a niche among other Spikers due to its physical power. Laying down Spikes is not all Scolipede can do, however, as it also has access to Swords Dance and a powerful STAB Megahorn along with a number of coverage moves, letting it bring the pain when it needs to. Thanks to Scolipede's Poison-type, it can also provide support in absorbing the ubiquitous Toxic Spikes, and is one of the best offensive candidates for this role. Unfortunately, Scolipede's defenses are mediocre, and it doesn't have the best defensive typing aside from a handy 4x resistances to Grass- and Fighting-type moves. There are also a lot of other Bug-types in RU that give it competition. In regards to entry hazards, Accelgor also has Spikes and is even faster, while Crustle has Spikes and Stealth Rock. There is also no shortage of physical Bug-types in RU, a tier which includes powerful Pokemon such as Durant. Despite this competition, Scolipede's ability to perform as a Spiker and a physical sweeper should not be ignored.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scolipede doesn't have too many other options to consider. Superpower doesn't provide any notable coverage, but it is the only way to hit Ferroseed for significant damage when outside of Swarm range. However, the Attack drop is unappealing and is usually not worth it. A Choice Band is a decent option, as Scolipede has a decent movepool, but Durant is usually the better option, as it has a much higher Attack. Scolipede has Pursuit, which is always useful to catch fleeing Pokemon, but its Pursuit is not very strong compared to other Pokemon in the tier. In addition, there is rarely a circumstance where a Ghost-type will switch out against Scolipede. Finally, if a Focus Sash is used on the hazard lead, Endeavor can cripple the opponent and bring it down to 1 HP, but Scolipede would rather use that turn to set up an extra layer of Spikes. Lastly, Scolipede has access to Baton Pass and is perfectly capable of passing things such as Swords Dance, Agility, and Substitute, although Scolipede often has trouble pulling off the pass due to its frailty.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best checks to Scolipede are generally those that do not take very much damage from its brutal STAB Megahorn. From there, Pokemon that do not take very much damage from its various coverage moves stand out as counters. Rotom, Misdreavus, and other Levitating Ghost-types take little damage from Megahorn, are immune to Earthquake, and can proceed to burn Scolipede. Steelix is weak to Earthquake, but its massive Defense means that it won't take all too much damage from the move, and it can do a lot of damage to Scolipede or phaze it out. Poliwrath resists Megahorn, is immune to Aqua Tail, and can phaze out Scolipede if it has gotten too many boosts, but be warned that it will rarely do much damage back to Scolipede other than possibly burn it with Scald. If Scolipede doesn't have Earthquake, Magneton and Qwilfish can counter it, as Magneton can easily OHKO and Qwilfish can soften blows with Intimidate and begin to set up Spikes. If Scolipede doesn't have Aqua Tail, Rhydon can take an Earthquake and then proceed to destroy it with Rock Blast, and Crustle can do the same or set up entry hazards. While Aerodactyl takes a lot of damage from Rock Slide and Aqua Tail, it outspeeds Scolipede and can either OHKO it or Taunt it so it cannot set up Spikes or Swords Dance. There are many Choice Scarf Pokemon that can revenge kill Scolipede, such as Emboar and Manectric, but note that they cannot switch into almost any of Scolipede's moves without taking massive damage.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Spikes",
        "description": "<p>Spikes are useful on almost any team to net specific KOs for offensive Pokemon. Thanks to its high Speed, Scolipede is an effective Pokemon to quickly lay down layers of Spikes;—it will usually get two layers off, in fact. While Crustle and Accelgor are capable of laying down Spikes too, Crustle is much slower, and Accelgor has less coverage. In addition to Spikes, Scolipede has a powerful STAB Megahorn to scare frailer Pokemon, which is a major draw, as it is capable of easily OHKOing Sceptile and Mesprit, which are two very relevant threats in RU. Earthquake hurts the Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon that resist Megahorn, and Rock Slide hits Flying-types, particularly Moltres. Note that the combination of these moves provides unresisted coverage.</p> <p>The choice of item is dependent on when you want Scolipede to do its job. If Scolipede is a dedicated lead, Focus Sash almost guarantees that it will get two layers of Spikes off; otherwise, Life Orb is a better choice because any entry hazards break Focus Sash. Scolipede has access to Toxic Spikes, but while they can be useful, about 1/3 of the Pokemon in RU aren't affected by Toxic Spikes, and many Poison-type Pokemon such as Drapion and opposing Scolipede can simply switch in and absorb them. If you do want to run Toxic Spikes alongside Spikes, however, Megahorn and Aqua Tail provide the best two-move neutral coverage.</p> <p>Be sure to run Jolly over Adamant to outspeed Manectric, Archeops, and Galvantula, which are four Pokemon that could potentially OHKO Scolipede. To keep Spikes up, running a spinblocker, such as Rotom or Spiritomb, is a good idea, as then Scolipede's work won't go to waste. Scolipede has a hard time dealing with bulky Steel-types such as Steelix, for this reason, bulky Water-types like Slowking are good choices for teammates to take them down. Bulky Water-types also can also defeat Fire-type Pokemon that can roast Scolipede, such as Entei, and Rock-type Pokemon with Rock Blast, such as Rhydon and Crustle, but be warned that bulky Water-types like Lanturn that are weak to Earthquake can't take on these Pokemon as easily.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Swords Dance + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<p>Despite a somewhat average Attack stat, Scolipede can easily become threatening by boosting it with Swords Dance. After using Swords Dance, it reaches 558 Attack, and with enough speed to outspeed several Pokemon that it will come across, it is a dangerous sweeper. While Scolipede might look inferior to Durant, which is stronger and has a useful set of resistances, it can outspeed Galvantula and Archeops, has a stronger Bug-type STAB, and doesn't have the risk of missing all of its moves.</p> <p>Megahorn, of course, is the primary STAB, and it deals massive damage to non-resistant foes. Earthquake and Rock Slide form the QuakeSlide combo, which grants nearly perfect coverage and deals with Pokemon such as Aggron, Moltres, and Entei, which can take a Megahorn and retaliate easily. However, Aqua Tail is usable over Rock Slide because most Flying-types in the tier either take neutral damage from Megahorn or take super effective damage from Aqua Tail.</p> <p>A Life Orb is the suggested item; however, Lum Berry can work as Scolipede is practically useless if it gets burned. This set tends to attract special attackers with a Choice Scarf, such as Manectric and Typhlosion, which can easily destroy it due to Scolipede's bad Special Defense. To deal with this, special walls such as Clefable, which can take these hits easily and then wear down their users, are good teammates. This set wants Rapid Spin support more so than others, because it wants to stay in as long as possible and the extra 25% can cause a large problem. Kabutops does two things as a partner, it can use Rapid Spin and also take on Fire-type moves easily thanks to its 4x resistance.</p> <p>Rock Slide isn't very strong, so Stealth Rock support is very useful to help Scolipede reliably defeat Flying-types. Omastar and Kabutops can use Stealth Rock, as can Aerodactyl and Uxie. As usual, Steelix is a problem for Scolipede to deal with, as even a +2 Earthquake won't take it down and it can phaze Scolipede out, so bulky Water-types such as Slowking are good partners because of this.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Substitute + Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>While this set might look strange at first, it uses many of Scolipede's qualities to its advantage. Scolipede has a tendency to get revenge killed by Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Manectric and Emboar, and its low special bulk ensures that it is easy to take out with a special move. With a Substitute, Scolipede can avoid these hits. However, Substitute has more merit than that. After ideally getting a Swords Dance up, repeatedly using Substitute will drop Scolipede down to 25% health and activate its Salac Berry and Swarm ability, giving you a dangerous sweeper capable of outspeeding Choice Scarf revenge killers.</p> <p>Megahorn is the main STAB option, and at +2 with a Swarm boost, there isn't much that can take the move without resisting it, and some Pokemon like Magmortar are OHKOed even though they do. Aqua Tail takes care of any Fire-type Pokemon that can take a Megahorn, and also hits Steelix relatively hard. In addition, Aqua Tail provides the best coverage with Megahorn, as the combination of the two moves is only resisted by Poliwrath, Qwilfish, Altaria, Water / Flying types, Shedinja, and irrelevant NFE Pokemon, making it easy for Scolipede to finish off weakened teams or any offensive teams that lack enough bulk.</p> <p>12 HP EV's are invested to give enough HP for Salac Berry to activate after three Substitutes. While it may seem tempting to give Scolipede an item such as a Life Orb, note that a Swarm-boosted Megahorn will be hitting harder than a Life Orb-boosted Megahorn, and anything that makes it lose HP is generally not good when used with Substitute, as it will lose health far too quickly. A Jolly nature ensures that Scolipede can outspeed Choice Scarf Manectric, which would otherwise outspeed and OHKO even after the Salac Berry boost. Earthquake is an option to use over Aqua Tail to get past all Steel-types, but note that Bug + Ground coverage is a bit underwhelming, and Aggron and Steelix, the two bulkiest Steel-types, are hit hard by Aqua Tail regardless, although getting past Klinklang and Magneton is nice.</p> <p>The bane of this set's existence is priority other than Mach Punch. Common priority users include Entei, Feraligatr, and Kabutops, so if any of them are seen in Team Preview, make sure they are eliminated from the match before Scolipede starts setting up. Druddigon is a good partner for ensuring this, as it can take a hit from all three while being able to OHKO them with its brutal STAB Outrage, or Earthquake for Entei. If Entei isn't an issue, running a Grass-type such as Amoonguss or Tangrowth will take care of the Aqua Jet users easily. Steelix and Aggron can take boosted Aqua Tails pretty well and then proceed to wear down Scolipede, Steelix in particular can phaze it out. Bulky Water-types like Slowking can take on Steelix as well as the aforementioned Entei.</p> "

  "Whimsicott": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its poor reputation, Whimsicott still has a notable niche in RU. With Prankster and a seemingly endless list of good support moves including Stun Spore, Taunt, Encore, Memento, and Tailwind, Whimsicott can provide support for a variety of teams; this includes, and is not limited to: spreading status through Stun Spore and Toxic, using Taunt to prevent the foe from setting up, and providing Sunny Day support for a sun team. However, due to its lackluster offensive stats, Whimsicott is limited to a supporting role. Moreover, Whimsicott's bulk is also mediocre, and its lack of a reliable recovery move is a major disappointment. Finally, after Whimsicott performs its job, it will usually become dead weight, as it poses no threat offensively and has no way outside of Leftovers and Leech Seed—which is blocked by opposing Grass-types—to recover its health. Whimsicott has a good Grass typing, but it faces competition from other Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Sceptile. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a Grass-type pivot that can prevent the foe from setting up, spread paralysis, and scout the opposing team, Whimsicott will have no trouble filling that role.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If you thought that Whimsicott's movepool ended there, then you've guessed wrong. Whimsicott has a plethora of other options, but they're relatively poor compared to the options already mentioned. It can use Switcheroo to cripple a foe with a Choice item or status Orb. Cotton Guard sharply raises Whimsicott's Defense, but Whimsicott doesn't have a lot to do outside of Leech Seed, and thus the move is rather useless. Cotton Spore can be used to lower the foe's Speed, but Stun Spore is usually better at slowing down the opposition. Fake Tears  lowers the target's Special Defense stat and can be used to deal more damage with Giga Drain or Solar Beam. An offensive set with Growth, Giga Drain, Hidden Power Rock or Fire, and Shadow Ball will surprise the opponent, but sadly, one Growth boost won't cure Whimsicott's terrible base 77 Special Attack stat. A Sunny Day set with Solar Beam is also an option, but again, Whimsicott can't put Solar Beam to much use because of its poor Special Attack. Tickle is another move that affects the foe's stats, lowering the target's Attack and Defense by one stage, but it is gimmicky at best. Whimsicott has access to Trick Room, but Whimsicott cannot make use of it due to its high Speed. Hurricane can be used to hit opposing Grass-types such as Sceptile, Tangrowth, and Lilligant, but sadly, Whimsicott does not learn Rain Dance, so it will be stuck with a 70% accurate move. Grass Whistle, although it has horrible accuracy, can infuriate the opposing team if it hits. <strong>It is strongly advised to not use the SubSeed combination on Whimsicott under any circumstances, as it is walled by a plethora of Pokemon, mainly Grass-types, and generally ends up being a waste of a teamslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Pokemon with Sap Sipper, such as Bouffalant, Miltank, and Sawsbuck, are immune to and get an Attack boost from Stun Spore, Leech Seed, and Giga Drain. Cryogonal is another great check, as it can spin away Leech Seed and hit hard with Ice Beam. Roselia completely walls Whimsicott, as it can cure itself of status upon switching out with Natural Cure and can KO Whimsicott with Sludge Bomb; Amoonguss is similar to Roselia, but it dislikes being hit with Encore. Escavalier doesn't mind being paralyzed, as it already has terrible Speed, and it can OHKO Whimsicott with a STAB Megahorn. Braviary can OHKO Whimsicott with Brave Bird or bail with U-turn—which will do quite a bit of damage if Whimsicott chooses to stay in—if Whimsicott tries to use U-turn itself or switch out to a Pokemon that beats Braviary. Moreover, thanks to Defiant, Braviary gets an Attack boost from Memento. Anything that can OHKO Whimsicott will force it to switch out or KO if it uses a support move. This includes Accelgor, Archeops, Drapion, Entei, Galvantula, Jynx, Magmortar, Moltres, Scolipede, Scyther, Sigilyph, and Typhlosion. Rotom-C and Entei can check Whimsicott well, but they dislike paralysis. Thus, Pokemon with Heal Bell, such as Clefable and Miltank, are good at combating Whimsicott, as they can rid their team of Whimsicott's paralysis. Pokemon with Natural Cure, such as Altaria and the aforementioned Roselia, also don't mind paralysis, as they will be cured upon switching out. Natu and Pokemon with Magic Coat such as Smeargle can reflect Whimsicott's moves, rendering Whimsicott useless. Lastly, Whimsicott gets worn down easily, especially by entry hazards, as it will be constantly switching in and out. Constant pressure from any of the above Pokemon will lead to Whimsicott's downfall.</p> ",

        "name": "Support",
        "description": "<p>This is Whimsicott's best set and can be manipulated to fit onto a wide variety of teams. Priority Stun Spore is extremely annoying for the opposing team, especially when it can paralyze Ground-type Pokemon that are normally immune to Thunder Wave; this can greatly aid a slower sweeper, such as Magmortar, and give it the opportunity to sweep. U-turn gives Whimsicott the ability to scout the opposing team and safely bring in a teammate after it has successfully paralyzed the foe. If you would like to bring in a teammate that is a setup sweeper, then Memento may be more appealing, as it will most likely force the opponent to switch out, giving your sweeper a free turn to set up. Encore is another reliable way to force switches and aid setup sweepers, as forcing the foe to continually use a move such as Protect will provide a massive setup opportunity for a teammate. The moves in the first three moveslots are mainly for team support and should always be used in tandem with slow offensive Pokemon or setup sweepers.</p> <p>The last slot is more dependent on your team's needs. Taunt can prevent any Pokemon without Magic Coat or Magic Bounce from setting up; this is especially useful if you have a Pokemon such as Moltres that is weak to entry hazards, as Whimsicott can almost always prevent Stealth Rock from being set up using Taunt. Giga Drain is Whimsicott's best weapon against the likes of Rhydon, Omastar, Kabutops, Feraligatr, and other Water- and Rock-types; note that Whimsicott cannot touch these Pokemon if it is not running Giga Drain. Finally, Leech Seed can be used to increase Whimsicott's longevity and force switches, which is very useful on a team with multiple layers of entry hazards. However, do not use Leech Seed in tandem with Substitute, as Whimsicott will be easily walled by opposing Grass-types and thus have more trouble supporting your team.</p> <p>252 HP and 252 Defense EVs are used in order to take as many physical hits as possible from the likes of Kabutops and Feraligatr; most special attackers would beat Whimsicott regardless of investment, such as Moltres, Magmortar, and Sceptile, and its Grass typing is more effective for walling physical threats in RU. A Bold nature is used to raise Whimsicott's Defense; it lowers Attack, but because Whimsicott's Attack stat is already very low, U-turn should not be used for dealing damage.</p> <p>Thanks to its plethora of support moves, Whimsicott's moveset is extremely flexible; mix and match to your heart's content. Tailwind is quite useful, as it will raise the Speed of Whimsicott and its teammates for four turns; slower Pokemon, such as Magmortar and Feraligatr, benefit most from this. If Whimsicott's team doesn't need paralysis support, Stun Spore can be replaced with Toxic, which wears down opposing walls and cripples faster Pokemon that tend to use Substitute, such as Sceptile. Finally, Light Screen can be used to support Whimsicott's team and give it more opportunities to spread paralysis.</p> <p>As for teammates, Magmortar benefits the most from Whimsicott. It greatly appreciates paralysis support, as its low base 83 Speed hinders its ability to sweep; it also enjoys the safe switch-in opportunities that Whimsicott's U-turn brings. Setup sweepers such as Omastar, Lilligant, Mesprit, Feraligatr, Crawdaunt, Gallade, and Linoone love Whimsicott's Memento or Encore support, as it forces the opponent to switch Pokemon and helps them set up more easily. Linoone especially likes to have this support, as it will be able to set up Belly Drum without worrying about being KOed in the process. Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock or Spikes, such as Moltres and Magmortar, really enjoy having Whimsicott as a teammate, as Whimsicott can prevent entry hazards from being set up by even the fastest Pokemon, such as Aerodactyl, with Taunt. Whimsicott benefits from Pokemon that can eliminate Bouffalant and Sawsbuck, as they both have the Sap Sipper ability and will gain an Attack boost if they are hit by Stun Spore, Giga Drain, or Leech Seed; Spiritomb, Steelix, and Fighting-types are all good options, as they can burn, wall, and severely damage those Pokemon, respectively. Entry hazards take their toll on Whimsicott, so Rapid Spin support is appreciated, especially from the likes of Kabutops, as Whimsicott can help it set up a Swords Dance boost with Encore.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set capitalizes on Whimsicott's Prankster ability and access to Sunny Day to make it a formidable weather setter. Prankster is this set's biggest advantage over other sun setters, as it allows Whimsicott to almost always set up sun before the foe can react. Once Whimsicott sets up sun, it should either use U-turn and switch into a teammate that can take advantage of the sun or use Memento to allow a free setup turn for a sun sweeper. Whimsicott should not be setting up sun on offensive behemoths, such as Gallade and Druddigon, as doing so will usually leave Whimsicott fainted due to its fragility. Instead, Whimsicott should be setting up the sun on weaker defensive Pokemon, such as Ferroseed and Alomomola.</p> <p>Taunt is a useful utility move, as it prevents setup sweepers such as Kabutops from boosting their stats. The last slot is a toss-up between Encore, Memento, and Leech Seed. Encore is the recommended option, as it can lock the foe into an unfavorable move, giving Whimsicott more opportunities to set up. Memento is once again an option to give sun sweepers free setup opportunities. Leech Seed can be used, however, to provide a way of healing for Whimsicott and its teammates once it has switched out.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Whimsicott to take weaker physical moves such as Spiritomb's Shadow Sneak and Ferroseed's Gyro Ball. Despite maximum investment in Defense, Whimsicott still cannot take on powerful physical attackers, so always be cautious. Whimsicott can use Stun Spore to paralyze the foe. This is extremely beneficial for slower Pokemon without Chlorophyll, such as Entei, which will gain the opportunity to slaughter the foe's team with a Choice Band-boosted Flare Blitz. Toxic can be used to provide residual damage, but it is generally inferior to Leech Seed, as it does not recover Whimsicott's health. Due to Whimsicott's lack of recovery, it is recommended to have a Wish user such as Alomomola to keep it healthy.</p> <p>There are two types of Pokemon that benefit from Whimsicott's sun support: Pokemon with the Chlorophyll ability and Fire-types. Chlorophyll users, including Sawsbuck, Exeggutor, Shiftry, and Victreebel, can make use of the sun Whimsicott provides as well as a potential free setup turn from Memento. Effective Fire-type partners include Charizard, Emboar, Moltres, Entei, and Typhlosion, as all of these Pokemon enjoy their Fire-type STAB moves being boosted by the sun. It is also recommended to have another sun setter, such as Regirock or Uxie, just in case Whimsicott faints or sacrifices itself with Memento.</p> "

Fortunately, Exeggutor hardly suffers in this regard; due to its unique movepool, typing, and stats, Exeggutor is an impressively flexible Pokemon. Its solid defensive stats, backed by a sizable base 125 Special Attack, allow Exeggutor to fill both offensive and defensive roles comfortably, making it a challenge to switch into until its set has been determined. To supplement this further, Chlorophyll and Harvest can both be utilized rather effectively by Exeggutor, meaning it can function as anything from a dangerous sun sweeper to an irritating Leech Seed user. Even as a Grass-type, Exeggutor distinguishes itself reasonably, as its Psychic typing allows it to threaten common checks to Grass-types, such as Bouffalant, Druddigon, Emboar, and Entei. Of course, this is not to say that Exeggutor is by any means perfect, as many aspects of RU still give it trouble. Due to Pursuit becoming an increasingly useful commodity for offensively inclined teams, Exeggutor becomes less and less likely to hold up throughout a match, and the ability of Toxic Spikes to put a timer on some of its sets isn't doing it any favors either. Furthermore, Exeggutor's underwhelming base 55 Speed leaves much to be desired, as even Sunny Day variants lack the Speed to outpace Choice Scarf users such as Rotom, while anything else can very easily fall prey to a plethora of powerful and common offensive Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although Sleep Powder is generally the most consistently significant, Stun Spore could be used either over or alongside it to allow Exeggutor to cripple faster threats on the switch, though the majority of common switch-ins to it are naturally slow. Exeggutor could utilize Reflect and Light Screen, either in a dedicated dual screens set or as a stand-alone support option, but often Uxie outclasses it in both respects. Of course, Exeggutor's Attack and complementing physical movepool is also usable, albeit somewhat weaker overall, and it is therefore more than capable of utilizing a Swords Dance set to capitalize on this. However, Exeggutor's low Speed makes it ill-suited in a sweeping role outside of either Trick Room or sun, and even under these conditions it requires notable team support in order to avoid being otherwise outclassed. An option not mentioned directly is that of a mixed attacking set, utilizing Exeggutor's decent Attack stat with moves such as Nature Power and Low Kick, which under sun can prove fairly effectual. However, it should be noted that, with some rare exceptions, many targets of these moves are aptly covered with either Psyshock or Hidden Power Fire, making the idea of spreading EVs across multiple stats somewhat undesirable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As Exeggutor is a moderately versatile Pokemon, outright countering it is a rather daunting task, though it hinges largely on two issues: what set it is running, and whether or not it has put something to sleep with Sleep Powder. Bulkier sleep absorbers, such as Entei, Escavalier, and Druddigon (particularly defensive variants), make for fairly safe initial switch-ins, only being threatened heavily by the more offensive Exeggutor variants and in turn threatening Exeggutor with their own strong attacks. The latter two are even capable of pressuring fleeing Exeggutor with Pursuit, further improving their ability to combat it. Pokemon immune to Sleep Powder, such as Bouffalant, Magmortar, and Sap Sipper Miltank, are generally capable of switching into and subsequently threatening Exeggutor, though none of these Pokemon appreciate switching into a Psyshock from more offensively oriented Exeggutor, and Magmortar specifically has a reasonable chance of being OHKOed by an unboosted Psyshock after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>After Sleep Powder has been utilized effectively, far more Pokemon find the opportunity to switch into Exeggutor safely; Pokemon such as Bulk Up Braviary, Druddigon, and Uxie all switch into Exeggutor's attacks with moderate ease, then threaten it in one way or another in turn. Strong Fire-types, such as Emboar and Entei, fall similarly into this category, though neither stomach Psyshock particularly well. Furthermore, once Sleep Powder has been used, Pursuit users, such as Absol, Escavalier, and Spiritomb, have a much easier time switching into and picking off Exeggutor, as long as they remain wary of the appropriate attacking move. Of course, should Exeggutor be lacking an item to boost its damage output, namely Choice Specs or Life Orb, issues with switching in are significantly diminished, as it becomes much easier to switch into and absorb Exeggutor's attacks, though this in turn means that it will be far more durable thanks to Harvest-renewable berries. Magic Guard Pokemon, namely Clefable and Sigilyph, are perfect examples of Pokemon that prey on a less offensive Exeggutor, being capable of safely switching into and finding free turns against most, if not all, defensively oriented Exeggutor. Moreover, while Harvest-reliant variants of Exeggutor do prove fairly difficult to wear down, they are rather susceptible to lure sets, such as Expert Belt Manectric and Rotom-C, which puts it in a position of caution when taking on such Pokemon. Of course, while this isn't the most ideal means of approaching Exeggutor offensively, it can be worn down by stacking hazards such as Toxic Spikes, which puts a draining timer on any Exeggutor lacking Lum Berry, and continuing to force it out with Pokemon such as Accelgor, Cryogonal, and Galvantula, though they do struggle to switch in under normal circumstances.</p> ",

        "name": "LumRest",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to the combination of Lum Berry and Harvest, Exeggutor can switch into common status moves from Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Slowking, and either cripple the foe with Sleep Powder or retaliate with one of its STAB moves. In the first slot, Rest is used to heal off residual damage taken from entry hazards and resisted moves, and is risk-free thanks to Lum Berry. When Exeggutor should use Rest depends on the foe's team. For example, if Exeggutor is at half health and the foe has a Slowking out, Exeggutor should use Rest immediately so it doesn't get KOed by Fire Blast the next time it switches into it. In the second slot, Sleep Powder is used to incapacitate common switch-ins such as Moltres and Druddigon. Leaf Storm occupies the third slot, and thanks to its immediate power, it OHKOes several Pokemon that Giga Drain cannot, including Slowking and Lanturn. It should be noted that Exeggutor has the strongest Leaf Storm in RU, which is a boon over other Grass-types like Sceptile. Giga Drain can be used for its reliability, but be warned, as missing out on the previously mentioned KOs could be crucial. The last slot is dedicated to a Psychic STAB move of choice. Psyshock is generally the better option, as it 2HKOes Lilligant after a Quiver Dance boost and OHKOes Roselia and Cryogonal after Stealth Rock. However, Psychic can be used to guarantee an OHKO on Emboar, as well as land a solid 2HKO on Tangrowth. It should be noted that Exeggutor's part Psychic typing is a huge advantage it has over other Grass-types, as it not only pressures common sleep inducers such as Emboar and Druddigon, but also destroys Amoonguss and Roselia, which would normally be threatening to other Grass-types.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Exeggutor to outpace minimum Speed Lanturn while also making it as powerful and bulky as possible. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-types like Escavalier, but it is very difficult to fit into Exeggutor's moveset. Pokemon that resist Exeggutor's weaknesses are good partners. Steelix resists five of Exeggutor's weaknesses and walls Escavalier. In return, Exeggutor can deal with Poliwrath and Qwilfish, which would otherwise give Steelix problems. Entei and Kabutops are also good partners, as they not only destroy Escavalier and Moltres, but also form a dangerous Fire / Water / Grass core. Qwilfish is another solid partner as it can switch into Durant and Entei and either cripple them with Thunder Wave or use them as a Spikes fodder. In return, Exeggutor deals with Rotom-C and Sceptile fairly well. It also deals with non-Hidden Power Lilligant, assuming that Exeggutor has Psyshock and Lilligant uses Sleep Powder the turn Exeggutor switches in. It should be noted that all of the aforementioned Pokemon appreciate Exeggutor's ability to absorb Scald, as many of them fare poorly against bulky Water-types and are greatly hindered when burned.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Sunny Day",
        "description": "<p>Exeggutor makes a naturally threatening sun sweeper; its high Special Attack stat allows it to burn through offensive teams with the sun up, and while fairly slow, Chlorophyll allows it to outpace most common revenge killers by a hair. What's more, Exeggutor is also rather proficient at setting up the sun on its own merit, as between its moderate bulk and threat of either a powerful attack or a Sleep Powder, it can force many Pokemon out, giving it the window necessary to use Sunny Day. Accordingly, Solar Beam is the most potent STAB move Exeggutor can utilize, as it is the most powerful and consistent move in its arsenal under the sun. On the other hand, Giga Drain offers Exeggutor a Grass-type STAB move that is usable both in and out of sun, and the recovery it provides is useful for mitigating the HP lost from Life Orb recoil and similar chip damage. Psyshock complements Exeggutor's Grass-type attacks nicely, allowing it to comfortably dispatch Pokemon, such as Emboar and Amoonguss, that would otherwise keep it in check. Sleep Powder is a very useful multi-purpose tool for Exeggutor, as it can either give it the turn necessary to set up Sunny Day safely or allow it to circumvent a potential check to it, whether it's a defensive response, such as Clefable, or an offensive one, such as Absol. However, the added coverage provided by Hidden Power Fire shouldn't be overlooked either, as with it in tow Exeggutor can much more proficiently sweep teams lacking a healthy special wall or Sucker Punch user, breezing through Pokemon such as Escavalier, Ferroseed, and Tangrowth that might have otherwise kept it in check.</p> <p>The extra Speed provided by a Timid nature allows Exeggutor to outpace several important threats, both inside and out of the sun; most defensively inclined Pokemon cannot outpace Exeggutor outside of the sun, and Accelgor and Choice Scarf Rotom-C can't quite outpace it with the sun up. However, the extra power offered by a Modest nature shouldn't be overlooked, as it is capable of reinforcing KOs on notable Pokemon such as Sceptile, Gallade, Lilligant, and more. Generally, the extra power provided by Life Orb makes it the most useful item for Exeggutor, as it otherwise finds itself just short of a plethora of KOs. However, for a dedicated sun team, Heat Rock's ability to extend the turns of Sun can prove invaluable, allowing Exeggutor to sweep teams much more comfortably once they have been worn down. Hidden Power Fire can replace Psyshock on this set, which allows Exeggutor to hit Steel-types while retaining Sleep Powder, which is perfectly acceptable if it is being used as a standalone sweeper. However, this isn't an advisable choice if Exeggutor is being used on a dedicated sun team, since this leaves it unable to threaten Entei, Emboar, or Druddigon, all of which are particularly threatening to sun teams. Explosion, alongside a Naive or Rash nature, is also a useful option for Exeggutor when being used on a dedicated sun team; not only does it inflict substantial damage on problematic Fire- and Dragon-types, but it also gives a free switch to another sweeper that can capitalize on the sun Exeggutor sets up.</p> <p>The most optimal partners for Exeggutor are those that can appropriately capitalize on the sun it brings. Choice Scarf Emboar is one such example, capable of not only utilizing the sunlight to fire off sun-boosted, STAB Flare Blitzes, but also comfortably taking on most of the Steel-types that check Exeggutor, should it forgo Hidden Power Fire. Entei fares similarly, though its lower Speed makes it unable to adequately deal with Durant. Moreover, Rock-types, such as Rhydon and Regirock, make very useful partners to Exeggutor, offering Stealth Rock support and a fallback to powerful Fire- and Flying-type attacks. Regirock in particular is a very useful pivot for dedicated sun teams, as it is capable of setting up sun itself and keeping momentum with Explosion.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Due to Exeggutor's reasonable natural bulk and high Special Attack, it makes a naturally proficient user of Choice Specs. Leaf Storm's damage output is incredible, 2HKOing even bulky Pokemon resistant to it, such as Druddigon and Entei, after Stealth Rock damage, and is therefore Exeggutor's primary means of dealing damage. With this in mind, Psyshock does an excellent job of patching up many of the \"blind spots\" of Leaf Storm, hitting more resilient resistances, such as Amoonguss and Moltres, as well as Sap Sipper users like Bouffalant for impressive damage. This also gives Exeggutor a more consistent STAB option, preventing dedicated special walls, most notably Clefable, from being able to simply absorb a Leaf Storm and recover off most of the damage, effectively forcing Exeggutor out. Of course, certain noteworthy Pokemon, namely Escavalier and Ferroseed, are capable of weathering these attacks rather well regardless, meaning Hidden Power Fire makes an excellent tool for drawing in and incapacitating the same. Due to both Exeggutor's admittedly sparse attacking options and lack of real necessity for further coverage, Sleep Powder makes a perfectly viable option for its final moveslot, allowing it a comparatively safe option for crippling a wide assortment of Pokemon without much risk. Of course, due to the limited application of both the final two options, Giga Drain is worth considering over both, as having a consistent Grass-type STAB move and semi-reliable recovery does grant Exeggutor somewhat more leeway mid-game, both in switching into weaker attacks and throwing around attacks without consequently becoming vulnerable to opposing setup.</p> <p>The given Speed investment allows Exeggutor to outpace uninvested Lanturn (assuming for the use of Hidden Power Fire), though it is more than viable to invest further in Speed. With maximum investment and a Timid nature, Exeggutor is capable of outpacing the vast majority of defensively inclined Pokemon, as well as bulky attackers such as Aggron and Bouffalant though the loss in bulk and Special Attack are both evident. Psychic can be used over Psyshock, as its increased damage output against targets such as Entei and Tangrowth can be useful at times, though typically the usefulness of Psyshock outweighs that of Psychic.</p> <p>Choice Specs Exeggutor is best utilized as a means of paving the way for another sweeper, which should be reflected upon in partner usage. Calm Mind sweepers such as Uxie and Mesprit appreciate Exeggutor's ability to beat down on Steel-types, though they retain similar typing, and offensive Water-types such as Feraligatr and Samurott are capable of spring-boarding off Exeggutor's ability to pressure opposing bulky Grass-types. Similarly, Rock-types such as Kabutops and Rhydon appreciate Exeggutor's ability to pressure Grass-, Steel-, and Water-types decently, and in return provide a solid fallback to Fire- and Flying-type attacks.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>Due to its naturally low Speed and high damage output, Exeggutor makes for a very threatening Trick Room user. With a Quiet nature and minimal Speed IVs, Exeggutor is able to \"outspeed\" everything faster than uninvested base 34 Speed Pokemon under Trick Room, effectively allowing it to get the jump on the vast majority of the tier. From there, Leaf Storm becomes a very dangerous move to switch into, dealing hefty damage to even moderately bulky resistant Pokemon, such as Entei and Druddigon. However, the stat drop that comes with Leaf Storm can be unappealing, as it often forces it to switch out afterwards, and therefore Giga Drain is a perfectly acceptable and comparatively safer alternative as a Grass-type STAB move. Psyshock complements either move rather well, allowing Exeggutor to burst through bulky resistances such as Amoonguss and effectively pressure specially defensive Pokemon as well. In terms of sheer usefulness, Sleep Powder is the most effective choice for the final moveslot; it not only helps Exeggutor find a window to safely set up Trick Room, but also prevents it from becoming vulnerable to opposing setup upon using Leaf Storm. Sleep Powder also provides Exeggutor a means of circumventing Sucker Punch attempts from Pokemon such as Absol and Spiritomb, both of which are inherently problematic for Trick Room users to handle.</p> <p>Harvest, while not offering any immediate benefits for the set, does prevent Exeggutor from having its Speed stat compromised by any potential Sunny Day inducers, as rare as that may be. While it doesn't truly capitalize on Harvest, a Colbur Berry is a viable alternative for Exeggutor if the drop in power isn't an issue, as the reinforced ability to take on Sucker Punch users and similar Dark-type attacks is rather useful for circumventing some of its offensive checks. Psychic offers an alternative Psychic-type STAB move, and while Psyshock is often preferable for its ability to break through special walls more comfortably, the extra damage against more physically bulky Grass resistances, such as Entei and Tangrowth, gives Psychic some merit. Exeggutor can forgo Sleep Powder for Hidden Power Fire, aiming to take on bulky Steel-types more comfortably, which is hardly unreasonable when considering that an uninvested Escavalier, a very threatening Pokemon under Trick Room, is capable of naturally outpacing Exeggutor under Trick Room. Moreover, Explosion can replace Sleep Powder, as it gives Exeggutor the ability to set up Trick Room for a partner and immediately give that partner a safe switch in, inflicting reasonable damage to most opposing Pokemon in the process.</p> <p>Naturally, bulky attackers pair nicely with Exeggutor, capitalizing on Trick Room and supporting Exeggutor defensively. Examples of this include Druddigon and Aggron, as they not only are capable of thrashing teams with their powerful attacks under Trick Room, but can also greatly pressure Steel-types alongside Exeggutor, limiting their effectiveness in checking this core. Emboar, particularly Choice Band and mixed variants, also makes for a useful partner to Exeggutor; it benefits greatly from the Trick Room support Exeggutor provides, and in return provides a strong pivot into Pokemon such as Escavalier and Tangrowth. Slowking, despite sharing a Psychic typing with Exeggutor, provides a solid secondary Trick Room setter that supports it offensively, and the duo is capable of either threatening or overloading one another's check effectively.</p> "

        "name": "Leech Seed",
        "description": "<p>Between respectable bulk, a series of significant resistances, and an impressive level of recovery via Harvest-fueled Sitrus Berries, Exeggutor can function as an impressive defensive tank. This vitality, when coupled with the recovery offered by Leech Seed, makes Exeggutor very difficult to KO, while simultaneously chipping away at the opponent. However, it is often difficult to initiate that Leech Seed cycle due to Exeggutor's lack of offensive presence, which is where Sleep Powder comes into play; by incapacitating a Pokemon for a minimum of one turn, Exeggutor is capable of safely setting up its Leech Seed, thereby improving its chances of stalling out the opponent. From this point, Exeggutor's primary objective becomes extending its own staying power, furthering its ability to chip away at Pokemon. For this purpose, Substitute is the option that offers the most tangible benefits to Exeggutor, protecting it from both status and powerful attacks while sapping away HP with Leech Seed. However, due to Exeggutor's low Speed, it is not always realistic to stall out by the merit of Substitute alone. Therefore, Protect makes a reasonable alternative, similarly allowing Exeggutor to stall out the opponent and providing the ability to scout moves in lieu of the ability to more effectively avoid status. Psyshock ensures that Exeggutor is not entirely reliant on Leech Seed to inflict damage upon the opponent; it allows Exeggutor to apply pressure to most Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed, apply additional pressure to Pokemon with recovery moves, and prevent Qwilfish, the most notable Taunt user of the tier, from shutting it down and setting up entry hazards on it. Hidden Power Fire, though it sacrifices the consistency of a STAB move and the ability to combat Qwilfish, is capable of similarly pressuring Grass-types, while threatening some significant targets Psyshock misses out on, such as Durant, Escavalier, and Ferroseed.</p> <p>The given EV spread, in tandem with a Bold nature, seeks to maximize Exeggutor's ability to tank and whittle away at physically based threats, with enough Speed to outpace minimally invested Lanturn, allowing it to either put Lanturn to sleep or set up a Substitute before compromising itself to status. A faster spread, specifically 248 HP / 16 Def / 244 Spe, can be used in order to get the jump on the vast majority of defensively inclined Pokemon and bulky attackers, though Exeggutor sacrifices a substantial amount of bulk in doing so. Due to the very precise nature of the set, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to make room for alternative move options to work with. However, it is technically possible to utilize Giga Drain over either Protect or Substitute, shifting Exeggutor's role from a stall-oriented tank to that of a defensive pivot, though it does face some serious competition from Tangrowth and Amoonguss in this role.</p> <p>Exeggutor greatly benefits from Toxic Spikes, as the additional damage they can accrue alongside Leech Seed facilitates the stalling process immensely, though they can also be highly detrimental to it if they remain on its side of the field. Therefore, a Poison-type Toxic Spikes setter, such as Qwilfish or Drapion, is very helpful. Furthermore, supporting Exeggutor with a cleric, such as Clefable or Lickilicky, can further bolster it against the possibility of life-shortening status. In addition to status, Magic Guard users, such as Clefable and Sigilyph, give Exeggutor a great deal of grief, as they can't be stalled out through Leech Seed or status. A Pursuit user, such as Absol, Escavalier, or Spiritomb, does wonders for this dilemma, either isolating and KOing them or bringing them down to the point where Exeggutor can usually take them out with a Psyshock upon their next switch-in.</p> "

  "Qwilfish": {
    "overview": "<p>Qwilfish is a Pokemon that has been overlooked time and time again in previous generations due to its poor base stats overall. However, BW brought Qwilfish its saving grace: a new Dream World ability in Intimidate. This makes Qwilfish much bulkier on the physical side than its stats would make it seem and gives it a chance to shine in RU. Qwilfish is a top choice for a defensive Spikes user, as it can check many top physically attacking threats such as Entei and Escavalier. Qwilfish's semi-unique typing gives it handy resistances to Fire-, Fighting-, and Bug-type attacks, all of which are common in RU. It's also gotten better with the coming of BW2, as one of its main issues was a lack of recovery, and this has been somewhat mitigated by the addition of Pain Split to its arsenal. However, some flaws remain. Qwilfish's atrocious Special Defense means that it struggles to take any powerful neutral special attacks, making it a setup opportunity for threatening foes such as Sceptile and Lilligant. It also has a bit of four-moveslot syndrome, as it has several moves that allow it to deal with certain kinds of foes, whether they are setup sweepers with Substitute, slower entry hazard setters, or fast offensive Pokemon. Qwilfish can't fit all of these moves on a single set though, so it's bound to have trouble with a certain type of threat. Nevertheless, Qwilfish is a top utility Pokemon and one of the best Spikes users in the metagame, and it is absolutely deserving of a teamslot should you require its services.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Qwilfish is useful on a rain team, as it becomes a fearsome rain sweeper with Swift Swim and a Swords Dance under its belt. It's also not weak to Grass-type attacks, which is very helpful on a rain team, and it can absorb Toxic Spikes. It can even set up Rain Dance by itself. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall for its higher Base Power, but Waterfall is usually superior for its higher accuracy and flinch chance. Qwilfish can also use a Choice Band set with Waterfall, Aqua Jet, Poison Jab, and Explosion, but such a set is largely outclassed by Kabutops or Feraligatr, which have better natural bulk, more power, or a better secondary STAB in the former's case. Lastly, Destiny Bond can be used as an alternative to Explosion on a suicide Spikes set, but most offensive leads are faster than Qwilfish and slower Pokemon can usually see it coming.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In general, special attackers are the easiest way to beat Qwilfish. Lanturn is arguably the best counter to Qwilfish, as it can switch into Waterfall easily and end Qwilfish with a Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Rotom-C is another top counter to Qwilfish, as it only fears the rare Poison Jab and also KOes with either Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Tangrowth is another foolproof counter, as it doesn't even care about Poison Jab and can hit Qwilfish with Giga Drain; Regenerator also cancels out Spikes damage. Psychic-types are also good counters to Qwilfish, especially Slowking, which switches into Waterfall with impunity, doesn't mind Thunder Wave, and hits back with Psyshock. Other Psychic-types, such as Mesprit, Sigilyph, and Uxie, are also good counters, as Uxie commonly uses a Lum Berry to neuter paralysis, Mesprit often uses a Substitute + Calm Mind set, and Sigilyph can hold a Flame Orb to shield itself from paralysis. They can all hit Qwilfish hard with Psychic, Psyshock, or Stored Power. Lilligant and Sceptile can both come in on anything bar Thunder Wave or Poison Jab (although Lum Berry Lilligant doesn't even fear Thunder Wave) and KO with Giga Drain or set up a Quiver Dance or Substitute, respectively. Steelix takes Waterfall like a champion and sets up Stealth Rock before 2HKOing with Earthquake, although it's setup fodder if its Attack has been lowered.</p> <p>While Qwilfish can be easily countered, preventing it from setting up Spikes is a far more difficult task. Natu is the ultimate answer to Qwilfish, as it can bounce back Spikes onto your opponent's side of the field and set up Reflect to avoid taking much damage from Waterfall. Faster Taunt users, such as Aerodactyl and Drapion, can prevent Qwilfish from doing much of anything, but the former doesn't take Waterfall well. Manectric and Electivire can take a Waterfall and KO with their STAB moves, and pick up a boost if they switch into Thunder Wave. Also, if Qwilfish lacks Taunt or Haze, it can be set up on by several threatening sweepers. Substitute + Dragon Dance Crawdaunt, Klinklang, Lum Berry Gallade, Swords Dance Feraligatr, and others can make Qwilfish setup fodder, and they all don't care about Thunder Wave. Roselia has Natural Cure to get rid of paralysis and 2HKOes Qwilfish with Giga Drain, while Qwilfish struggles to do much in return. Some of the most powerful physical attackers in the metagame can beat Qwilfish even after Intimidate because Qwilfish doesn't resist their STAB move; Choice Band Aggron and Druddigon are the best examples of this.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<p>This is the only Qwilfish set you should be using, but it does so much for a team and will always satisfy your desires. Spikes is an instrumental support move, and Qwilfish is one of its best users in the metagame, as it gets numerous opportunities to switch in and set them up during the match thanks to Intimidate and its great defensive typing. Qwilfish also boasts the ability to beat most of the main spinners in the tier, as it can paralyze both defensive Cryogonal and Swords Dance Kabutops and use Waterfall to beat them. It also beats both Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee, provided the former isn't carrying Thunder Punch, although this isn't much of a feat as the two of them aren't very effective Rapid Spin users. Pain Split is an important move for Qwilfish, as it provides Qwilfish with some form of recovery, allowing it to perform its job even better. Waterfall is Qwilfish's STAB move, which prevents it from being Taunt bait against Pokemon such as Aerodactyl and helps it wear down Entei; it works especially well in combination with Thunder Wave, as your opponent will find it hard to get an attack off because of the effects of paralysis in addition to Waterfall's flinch chance.</p> <p>Qwilfish has a plethora of utility moves at its disposal; however, there is only room for one of them. Thunder Wave is usually the best option, as it deters Pokemon like Sceptile, Galvantula, and Moltres from switching in, although the latter doesn't particularly like Waterfall either. It also clears the way for slower Pokemon such as Escavalier, Rhydon, and Magmortar to sweep. Taunt is more useful against defensive teams, as Qwilfish is faster than most other defensive Pokemon and can prevent them from healing or setting up entry hazards; Pokemon like Ferroseed, Clefable, and Mandibuzz are especially vulnerable to Taunt. Lastly, Haze is also a viable option, and it works wonders against setup sweepers with Substitute, particularly Klinklang, Crawdaunt, and Bulk Up Gallade. Each one has different uses for different teams, so it might require some experimentation to find exactly the right move.</p> <p>16 Speed EVs are used to outspeed neutral-nature base 55 Speed Pokemon, such as Bouffalant and Golurk, and hit them with Waterfall, Taunt, or Thunder Wave. The remaining EVs increase Qwilfish's physical bulk as much as possible to cushion physical blows better in combination with Intimidate. However, Qwilfish can run a faster EV spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spd with a Jolly nature in order to outrun Smeargle and Taunt it before it can make a move, crippling it. Explosion is also a good option on a faster Qwilfish over Pain Split, as it ensures that Qwilfish will go out with a bang in case a threatening sweeper such as Feraligatr attempts to set up. Toxic Spikes can be used as well, but they are largely ineffective in the current metagame due to the high number of common grounded Poison-types, such as Amoonguss, Drapion, Roselia, and opposing Qwilfish. Toxic can also be used, but is generally inferior to Qwilfish's other utility options, particularly Thunder Wave, as Qwilfish will be unable to stall out Toxic damage well against special attackers. Poison Jab is an alternate STAB move that can be used to hit Grass-types such as Sceptile, Rotom-C, and Lilligant on the switch-in, but it won't do enough damage due to the lack of investment, and Thunder Wave cripples them more anyway.</p> <p>Qwilfish is very vulnerable to special attacks, so it requires a partner that will be able to take them well. Clefable and Cryogonal are two such partners, and each provides additional utility. Clefable provides Wish support when Qwilfish is too low on health to use Pain Split, while Cryogonal provides Rapid Spin support when Qwilfish has been forced out by an opposing entry hazard user. The combination of Qwilfish and either of these two is very hard to break because they synergize so well; they form the start of a good stall team. Grass-types are good partners too, even frailer ones, as Qwilfish is a hard stop to some of their biggest nightmares: Entei and Escavalier. Rotom is another great partner that can spinblock the hazards that Qwilfish sets up; it synergizes well and the two of them can wear down Kabutops quite easily. If using Thunder Wave, it's a good idea to use Pokemon that benefit from paralysis support, such as Tangrowth, Magmortar, and Rhydon. Qwilfish can be a very effective pivot for bulky offensive teams. Finally, powerful wallbreakers such as Moltres appreciate the damage from Spikes that racks up on their checks and allows them to sweep more easily.</p> "

  "Entei": {
    "overview": "<p>After spending the last decade being completely outclassed, first by its fellow legendary beasts and later by Arcanine, Entei has finally found a home in RU. With most of its rivals safely locked away in higher tiers, Entei is free to rampage through RU unhindered. Its high Attack and Speed stats and access to Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed make Entei easily one of the best physical attackers in the tier, but it can also use Calm Mind to become one of RU's most dangerous (and overlooked) special sweepers. Its movepool is quite shallow, and the forced Adamant nature that comes with its event moves hinders it to an extent, but do not overlook Entei; its power and versatility make it a Pokemon every successful team must consider.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Physical Entei can forgo a boosting item and use Leftovers instead to take advantage of its natural bulk and avoid being worn down by residual damage. This opens up some new options for that otherwise forgettable fourth moveslot, most notably Will-O-Wisp. Using Leftovers reduces Entei's potency as a wallbreaker and revenge killer, but it still has respectable power even without a boosting item, and the ability to stick around longer and cripple certain counters with a burn is sometimes worth the power drop.</p> <p>Entei can use a mono-attacking set with RestTalk, Lava Plume, and Calm Mind to keep itself healthy and potentially set up multiple boosts (especially with a few lucky burns). Such a set is very threatening to stall teams, but it is also an invitation for Omastar to come in, set up a Shell Smash, and sweep your team. You can try a more defensive RestTalk set with Roar in place of Calm Mind to spread burns and rack up entry hazard damage, or even a full support set with Will-O-Wisp and Reflect as well, but Entei's common weaknesses make it a poor wall in general.</p> <p>An all-out offensive Calm Mind set with Fire Blast, Hidden Power Grass, and Stone Edge can surprise some of Entei's counters. Stone Edge may seem unorthodox on a Calm Mind set, but even without much Attack investment it does significant damage to Altaria and Moltres, which are normally good switch-ins to special Entei. Extrasensory is also an option for decent neutral coverage, although the only target it's really useful against is Qwilfish. Shadow Ball is the only other coverage move Entei has that's worth noting, but it offers absolutely no additional coverage over the options already mentioned.</p> <p>Choice Scarf is a usable item on Entei, either as a physical attacker with Flare Blitz or a special attacker with Eruption. However, Extreme Speed makes Choice Scarf somewhat redundant for the physical attacker, and Eruption is generally used better by Typhlosion. Flame Charge is a decent option to boost Entei's Speed while retaining the ability to switch moves, and Entei's movepool is small enough that it won't mind only having three true attacking moves. Finally, Entei can use Howl to boost its already impressive Attack even higher; just note that Howl is an event move like Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed, meaning it forces Entei to run an Adamant nature, which makes it slower than many of the tier's top threats.</p> <p>A Sunny Day set with Flare Blitz and Solar Beam can be used, as Flare Blitz will hit like a truck and Solar Beam will eliminate Water-types more effectively than Hidden Power Grass. However, Solar Beam will not be that strong, as Entei struggles to divide its EVs equally. Furthermore, a Sunny Day set is generally outclassed by Typhlosion who is faster and has higher Special Attack. Extreme Speed and Stone Edge are really the only advantages that Entei has over Typhlosion, but physical sun sweepers are rare so a Sunny Day set is usable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Quagsire, Alomomola, Poliwrath, and Intimidate Qwilfish all counter physical sets quite effectively, but none of them enjoy taking boosted special attacks. Other Water-types such as Kabutops, Carracosta, and Omastar 4x resist Flare Blitz and also resist Extreme Speed, but neither of them enjoy taking a 4x super effective Hidden Power Grass; however, the former two can KO Entei with Aqua Jet before it has the chance to use Hidden Power Grass. Rock-types such as Rhydon can take on Entei, but they also fear Hidden Power Grass and dislike being crippled by Will-O-Wisp. A physically defensive Druddigon also takes Entei's attacks quite well and can cause damage with Rough Skin, but Druddigon distastes Will-O-Wisp. Calm Mind variants have trouble dealing significant damage to Moltres and Altaria, but they in turn cannot do much back to Entei, and they greatly dislike Stone Edge. Fast Pokemon with super effective STAB attacks, such as Aerodactyl and Archeops, can be troublesome for Entei, but physical sets can bypass this Speed difference with Extreme Speed, and special sets will often have a Substitute up to prevent revenge killing. Entry hazards are an effective way to weaken Entei, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and fully vulnerable to Spikes. The damage taken switching in will greatly reduce Entei's ability to set up, and Toxic Spikes will completely ruin any Calm Mind sets.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Entei's combination of power, Speed, bulk, access to Extreme Speed, and immunity to Will-O-Wisp makes it one of RU's most fearsome physical attackers. With a Choice Band equipped, Flare Blitz 2HKOes everything that doesn't resist it, while Extreme Speed takes a huge chunk out of most offensive Pokemon. Together, these two moves make Entei both a powerful wallbreaker and an excellent revenge killer. In the third slot, Stone Edge OHKOes Aerodactyl, Moltres, and most relevant Fire-types. Unfortunately, Entei's physical movepool essentially ends there, so the final slot is largely filler. Hidden Power Grass may seem out of place on a Choice Band set, but it allows Entei to 2HKO a few Pokemon that would otherwise force it out, such as Kabutops, Omastar, Quagsire, and Rhydon. Sleep Talk is a useful option for handling sleep inducers, as Entei can switch into almost all of them including Smeargle, Lilligant, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss.</p> <p>Flare Blitz and Extreme Speed are event moves with an unfortunate restriction: to use them, Entei must have an Adamant nature (and be shiny). This means that Entei will always be slower than Pokemon such as Timid Moltres and Jolly Drapion, despite having a higher base Speed. With 252 Speed EVs, Entei outspeeds the Rotom appliances and everything below, but you can use a slightly slower spread of 60 HP / 252 Atk / 196 Spe to give Entei a little extra bulk while still allowing it to outpace positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Gallade.</p> <p>Choice Band allows Entei to hit as hard as possible, the only drawback being that Entei is locked into one move. To fix this, Entei can hold a Flame Plate. Flame Plate allows Entei to switch moves while maintaining power on its STAB Flare Blitz, but the power drop in Entei's other moves is noticeable. However, a Flame Plate can do a good job at bluffing a Choice Band, as you may be able to fool a Kabutops into thinking that you're locked into Flare Blitz. Another solid item choice would be for Entei to hold a Life Orb. Life Orb also gives Entei the flexibility to change moves, but maintains higher power on all of Entei's attacks instead of just Flare Blitz. Life Orb grants Entei much more power in general than Flame Plate, but the recoil between entry hazards, Flare Blitz, and Life Orb itself severely limits Entei's longevity. Another option if holding a Choice Band would be Bite, as it 2HKOes defensive Slowking. If not using a Choice Band, an option in the fourth moveslot would be Will-O-Wisp, as it can cripple physical attackers such as Druddigon that tend to switch in. Roar may also be used, but it is generally inferior to the other available options.</p> <p>The power and versatility of this set make it a good fit on nearly any offensive team, but it does need some specific support to reach its full potential. Poliwrath and defensive Qwilfish can switch into Entei all day, so a powerful Electric-type attacker, such as Rotom-C or Manectric, is a great help. Entei is weak to Stealth Rock and vulnerable to Spikes, and as a Choice item user, it will want to switch in several times, so Rapid Spin support is very beneficial. Kabutops can remove entry hazards for Entei, and together with Rotom-C, the trio forms the powerful Fire / Water / Grass core. Kabutops can't switch into Hidden Power Grass or Will-O-Wisp, but it can come in on Flare Blitz or Extreme Speed and KO Entei with Aqua Jet; therefore, a Pokemon that can take out Kabutops, such as Sceptile, is a good teammate. Finally, Entei appreciates entry hazard support as Stealth Rock and Spikes can push a 3HKO on something such as Slowking to a 2HKO. Smeargle is great for setting up entry hazards early-game, and it can give the team early momentum by putting something to sleep with Spore.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>With base 100 Speed and the ability to create 101 HP Substitutes, Entei is an excellent bulky Calm Mind sweeper. Although Entei's average Special Attack and limited special movepool prevent this set from being as immediately threatening as its physical set, it is surprisingly easy to set up. Entei's reputation as a powerful physical attacker makes it easy to force a switch and set up an initial Calm Mind or Substitute, and many of the best switch-ins to its physical sets, such as Kabutops and Poliwrath, are forced to switch right back out when they realize that Entei is running a special set. Entei's 101 HP Substitutes and high base Speed also allow it to set up on nearly any wall. If your opponent lacks the right counter or waits too long to switch it in, Entei quickly becomes unstoppable.</p> <p>The first two moves are obvious, and Flamethrower is a pretty clear choice as well; its 100% accuracy means that Entei doesn't have to worry about losing its Substitute due to an untimely miss, and it has plenty of power once Entei has set up. Lava Plume can be used over Flamethrower for its high chance to burn the opponent. Hidden Power Grass is usually the best option in the last slot to cover Pokemon such as Kabutops, Quagsire, and Rhydon. However, Roar is also a viable option, especially with entry hazard support. Phazing is one of the only ways for opponents to stop Entei once it sets up, but Entei outspeeds every common phazer and can Roar them out first, forcing them to take another round of hazard damage and giving itself another turn to set up. Roar also prevents Pokemon such as Calm Mind Slowking and Calm Mind Uxie from setting up alongside Entei. However, sacrificing Hidden Power Grass means most Water-types will completely wall Entei, and Roar's negative priority means they will always be able to hit Entei with Surf or Waterfall before it can phaze them out, so Entei will need its teammates to eliminate the opponent's Water-types before it attempts to sweep.</p> <p>Hidden Power Rock is another option in the last slot to hit Altaria, Moltres, and other Fire-types, but it forces Entei to have an imperfect Speed IV, and Entei can use most Fire-types as setup fodder anyway. The given EVs maximize Entei's Speed and allow it to create 101 HP Substitutes, while the leftover EVs go in Special Attack to boost Entei's power. While this spread gives the best balance between power and ability to set up, by no means is it the only option. For example, reducing Entei's Speed investment to 176 EVs will still allow it to outspeed Timid Lilligant and Moltres while freeing up some EVs to invest in additional bulk or power. Taking things even further, a completely defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with Lava Plume in place of Flamethrower will make it much easier for Entei to set up against offensive Pokemon, although the lack of Speed leaves it more vulnerable to status. On the other hand, an all-out offensive spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with Fire Blast will make Entei much more powerful, but this also makes it harder to keep a Substitute up. Which spread is best depends on what your team needs Entei to set up on, so play around with it until you find the one that works best for you.</p> <p>This set can be extremely difficult to stop once it gets going, but it does have a couple of solid counters, especially once you reveal Entei's fourth move. If Entei lacks Roar, Dragon Dance Altaria can set up in its face, while defensive Moltres can simply phaze Entei out. If Entei forgoes Hidden Power Grass, most Water-types can beat it, especially Quagsire (which ignores Entei's boosts due to Unaware) and Water / Rock-types such as Omastar and Kabutops. Either way, entry hazard support is Entei's best friend. Stealth Rock cripples Moltres and Altaria, while multiple layers of Spikes allow Entei to stall out Water-types by simply phazing them out as they break its Substitute, and then setting up a new Substitute as they switch back in and take another round of hazard damage. Ferroseed is a great partner that can often stack several layers of Spikes; it also lures in Fire-type attacks for Entei to switch in on, and it can use Leech Seed to keep Entei healthy during its initial setup.</p> "

  "Swellow": {
    "overview": "<p>With fantastic Speed, solid Attack, and a great ability, Swellow makes its mark in RU as one of the premier late-game sweepers in the tier. Swellow's gives it the edge against Pokemon such as Sceptile, Choice Scarf Emboar, and Cinccino, three big threats in RU that few other Pokemon can claim to outspeed. Swellow also has a great ability in Guts, which boosts its decent Attack to very high levels when afflicted with a status condition. Two high-powered STAB moves and priority in Quick Attack only augment this firepower and cleaning ability, making it quite difficult to stop Swellow with sheer bulk or Speed once it gets going.</p> <p>In spite of all of these good qualities, Swellow has next to no coverage against the numerous Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon in RU. It doesn't help that Steelix and Rhydon are two of the premier physical walls in the tier, as both can handle Swellow without much difficulty. With paltry defenses, a weakness to Stealth Rock, the use of a Toxic Orb to activate Guts, and recoil from possible Brave Birds, Swellow's lifespan is very short and generally relegates it to the late-game sweeping role. In spite of this, Swellow is very good at what it does and makes for a great a late-game cleaner with the right support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Quite frankly, Swellow has an incredibly limited movepool. However, there are a couple of options you could consider. A Choice Band set seems decent thanks to Guts allowing Swellow to not be crippled by burns and it having a strong STAB move in Brave Bird. However, Braviary not only has a much higher Attack stat but also has the ability to overwhelm opposing Rock- and Steel-types with Superpower. Pursuit can catch fleeing Ghost- and Psychic-types, but Swellow is better off just firing off one of its STAB moves. Toxic is an interesting option to cripple Rhydon for the remainder of the match. Steel Wing can catch Rhydon for some damage, but its low Base Power and Rhydon's insane physical bulk makes this a lesser option. Finally, Endeavor can be used as a last-ditch effort to damage an opposing threat if Swellow is really low on HP and can't finish off a sweep.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steelix and Rhydon are, bar none, the best counters to Swellow. With a resistance to both STAB moves and very high physical bulk, both can take numerous attacks from Swellow and respond with Gyro Ball or Rock Blast respectively. Aggron is the most notable offensive counter to Swellow as it sports a 4x resistance to both of Swellow's STABs and has a powerful Head Smash to decimate Swellow or any teammate that tries to switch in. Choice Scarf Rotom is incredibly annoying for Swellow as it's immune to Facade and Quick Attack and has STAB Volt Switch to build momentum or outright KO Swellow if it stays in. Choice Scarf Rotom-C is also problematic, although a weakened one will have trouble dealing with Quick Attack. Aerodactyl and Accelgor are two of the very few Pokemon that naturally outspeed Swellow, but Accelgor's frailty makes it hard for it to deal with Quick Attack.</p> <p>Priority users are always an option to revenge kill Swellow, but keep in mind that most will have to deal with Quick Attack first as Swellow outspeeds them. Entei is one of the two exceptions as Extreme Speed's +2 priority lets it hit before Swellow can move. The other exception is Spiritomb as its Ghost typing makes it immune to Quick Attack. Samurott and Kabutops can use Aqua Jet and Kabutops even resists Quick Attack. Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee can use Mach Punch. Hitmonchan's is boosted by Iron Fist, and Hitmonlee's is usually backed by a Fighting Gem. Although it will have difficulty tanking it, Ferroseed can force Swellow to take a ridiculous amount of damage from using Brave Bird due to Iron Barbs and the recoil incurred from using Brave Bird in the first place. Pokemon with high physical bulk such as Alomomola and Uxie can take a hit and strike back with their STAB moves, but both must be careful about taking too much prior damage, especially Uxie as Alomomola has Wish and Regenerator to stay in good health throughout the match.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Guts",
        "description": "<p>This is Swellow's best set to run in RU and lets it perform as a great late-game cleaner. This set aims to activate Swellow's Guts ability to power up its moves and go on a late-game sweep. Facade should be the move you use under most circumstances. After Guts is activated, Facade has an incredible 210 Base Power after STAB, allowing it to get through even frailer resistances such as Archeops and Aerodactyl. Brave Bird is useful for hitting defensive Grass-types such as Tangrowth, Torterra, and Amoonguss as well as Pokemon that resist Facade like Escavalier, Durant, and Spiritomb. U-turn lets Swellow hit its checks and counters as they come in and switch to a teammate to either take them out or force them out to take more entry hazard damage. The final move is mostly used to ensure Swellow can activate Guts safely. Quick Attack has the more general use as it allows Swellow to revenge kill weakened threats while activating Guts. It's also useful to get in front of other priority users such as Absol, which might be sent in to revenge kill Swellow with its STAB Sucker Punch. Protect is an option to ensure Guts is activated safely. However, keep in mind that once the Toxic Orb is activated, Swellow takes poison damage every turn, which makes it somewhat counter-productive to scout for moves later with Protect.</p> <p>Although it might be tempting to use Adamant, Swellow absolutely needs to run Jolly in order to outspeed dangerous threats such as Sceptile, Choice Scarf Emboar, and Cinccino so that it can beat them one-on-one if the opponent uses one of them as his or her late-game cleaner. Swellow's movepool is rather shallow, but there are a couple of options to at least consider using in the last slot. Work Up boosts Swellow's Attack to absolutely ridiculous levels and lets it OHKO defensive Spiritomb, Druddigon, and Golurk without question. Roost is another option, allowing Swellow to regain some health and possibly prolong its chance at sweeping. However, neither of these options get used that much in practice due to Swellow's extreme frailty. Finally, one can use Protect over U-turn if you desire to keep Quick Attack on the set.</p> <p>Steelix and Rhydon are the two biggest problems for Swellow as they resist both of its STABs and have great physical bulk. Mixed Emboar can destroy both with Fire Blast and Grass Knot respectively, and Samurott can take them out with its powerful STAB Hydro Pump. Magneton can trap and KO most Steel-types, Pokemon Swellow struggles with in general due to its inability to hit them for effective damage, but note that it will struggle to reliably KO Steelix due to Earthquake. One of the more unique partners for Swellow is Acrobatics Drifblim. Drifblim shares many checks and counters with Swellow, so one can typically be used to weaken checks and counters for the other to sweep. Fighting-types such as Gallade, Medicham, and Hitmonlee can all reliably take out Steel- and Rock-types. A Rapid Spin user is helpful to keep Stealth Rock off the field so Swellow has as much HP as possible for taking poison damage. Kabutops is the best choice for this as it can draw out defensive Grass-types for Swellow to switch in on. Slow, bulky pivots such as Eelektross and Musharna can be used to get Swellow in safely. Eelektross even matches up well against most Steel- and Rock-types thanks to its access to Flamethrower and Giga Drain. Finally, Spikes support is recommended to not only take advantage of U-turn but also exploit Steelix and Rhydon's lack of reliable recovery. Roselia is a good choice as it can handle many of the Choice Scarf-equipped Electric-types that are often used to attempt to revenge kill Swellow. Scolipede is a more offensive choice that can weaken Steelix and Rhydon with Aqua Tail as well as smashing Uxie and Slowking with Megahorn.</p> "

  "Volbeat": {
    "overview": "<p>Volbeat isn't a Pokemon that seems very viable due to its pitiful stats, but a closer look reveals that it has access to the rare Prankster ability, which is where its main niche lies. It has all the right moves to utilize its ability as well, although the lack of Taunt really hinders it. Despite that, Volbeat makes for a great rain setter and also supports rain teams with paralysis support in the form of priority Thunder Wave. Volbeat also has a rare boosting move in Tail Glow, which it can effectively pass onto another Pokemon with priority Baton Pass, and priority Encore makes setting up against the likes of entry hazard leads and opposing boosting Pokemon easier. Unfortunately, Volbeat has low bulk and an even lower offensive presence, making setting up and passing a difficult task. Furthermore, its Bug typing is a double-edged sword; it gives Volbeat resistances to Fighting and Ground, but also burdens it with weaknesses to the omnipresent Fire- and Rock-type attacks. It faces a lot of competition from Liepard as a rain setter and Smeargle as a Baton Passer, as the former lacks a Stealth Rock weakness and the latter has a superior boosting move in Quiver Dance.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tailwind is the most viable other option for Volbeat, although its two-turn duration for the team is very off-putting. Confuse Ray is another viable option, although the unreliability of confusion makes it a lesser option. An attacking set with Tail Glow / Bug Buzz / Giga Drain / Thunderbolt and a Life Orb can be considered, but Volbeat doesn't have the bulk, Speed, or power (even after Tail Glow) to utilize it effectively. Volbeat's Attack is higher than its Special Attack and it does have a plethora of physical moves such as U-turn, Acrobatics, Ice Punch, and even Focus Punch, but again, its stats really hinder it. Lagging Tail or a status Orb used alongside Trick is feasible, but Volbeat doesn't have much room for it. Toxic is great to cripple most walls, but takes up a precious moveslot and usually isn't worth it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Manectric appreciates switching in on a Thunder Wave due to Lightningrod and can blast Volbeat away with Overheat or Flamethrower. Rhydon doesn't care for Thunder Wave either and can KO Volbeat even through Substitute with Rock Blast as long is it gets at least four hits (three if Stealth Rock is up). Phazing moves such as Roar and Whirlwind can remove Volbeat's boosts as well as the recipient's if they catch it on the switch. Dragon Tail can also work, but it's a bit unreliable due to its 90% accuracy and inability to phaze through Substitute. Steelix can learn both Roar and Dragon Tail, so it makes for a good check. Qwilfish can use Taunt to put a complete stop to Volbeat, and it can even set up Spikes to annoy Volbeat's team. Keeping up the offensive momentum and threatening to KO or severely cripple Volbeat or its recipient is another way to avoid a successful pass. Lastly, any decently powerful Pokemon can KO Volbeat, although they will almost always be left crippled by Thunder Wave.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Rain Dance",
        "description": "<p>RU is filled with dangerous Pokemon that become even more threatening when it's raining; Volbeat aims to bring out the true power in such Pokemon by setting up the weather while also supporting them with slow U-turns and Encore. Liepard might seem to outclass this set due to its lack of a Stealth Rock weakness and access to Taunt; however, Volbeat's typing is much better defensively, giving it resistances to Fighting and Ground, while the rain mitigates its Fire-type weakness (giving it another boon as Volbeat utilizes the rain it sets). U-turn is used to bring in a rain sweeper unscathed once Volbeat's job is done. Encore is very useful to lock an unsuspecting opponent into a non-attacking move, giving Volbeat more setup opportunities and its teammates more switch-in opportunities. Thunder Wave lets Volbeat support its team further by crippling dangerous Pokemon such as Sceptile and Kabutops, which would otherwise trouble rain teams.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Volbeat's physical bulk, as its typing is more geared towards taking physical hits. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs ensure that Volbeat gets outsped by the majority of the metagame so it can U-turn into a rain sweeper without said sweeper taking any damage. Sunny Day and Heat Rock can be used to turn Volbeat into a sun supporter, but Whimsicott gives it too much competition in that role. Roost can be used for reliable recovery, but Volbeat typically prefers the options listed above as they provide more utility overall. Pokemon that utilize the rain are obvious partners; Ludicolo, Omastar, Kabutops, and Moltres all fall into that category. Defensive Grass-types such as Ferroseed and Amoonguss also love the rain, as it mitigates their Fire-type weaknesses (especially for the former), and offensive variants of the latter also love the paralysis support Volbeat has to offer. Having a backup rain setter is highly recommended in case Volbeat goes down; Lanturn and Uxie fit that bill nicely.</p> "

        "name": "Baton Pass",
        "description": "<p>Access to Tail Glow already gives Volbeat a niche as a Baton Passer, but Prankster elevates that niche to a whole new level. The +3 Special Attack boost, when passed to the right teammate, can be devastating for the opposing team. Encore aids Volbeat in the daunting task of setting up, as locking the opponent into a non-attacking move can give Volbeat just the time it needs to set up and pass. Substitute allows Volbeat to avoid status to aid in its setup. If the Substitute stays intact when Volbeat Baton Passes, the effects can be game-changing, as the opponent will almost always need to sacrifice at least one Pokemon to even attempt to regain momentum. Thunder Wave can be used instead to cripple the opposing Pokemon and make it easier to Baton Pass into its recipient safely.</p> <p>Much like with the previous set, the EV spread utilizes Volbeat's Bug typing by giving it usable physical bulk. A Salac Berry can be used with an EV spread of 244 HP / 252 Def / 12 SpD to pass a Speed boost to the recipient. However, this should only be used with Substitute, as Substitute makes it easy to get into activation range without having the risk of being KOed. Mental Herb can be used alongside Thunder Wave to get surefire protection from Taunt, but it's only a one-time thing. Roost can be used for reliable recovery, but Volbeat is better off using the options listed above as they provide more utility overall. Bug Buzz seems tempting, but is usually a bad idea, as Volbeat will almost always want to do something other than outright attack the opponent; even if Volbeat gets Taunted, its best bet is to switch out, as it won't be doing much to the opponent with a pathetically weak Bug Buzz. Recipients for Tail Glow should typically be either bulky or fast, as Tail Glow only provides a Special Attack boost, leaving the recipient prone to revenge killing. Lanturn and Slowking are both good examples of bulky recipients that also provide a valuable Fire resistance, with the former having a Flying resistance as well. Manectric and Rotom-C are fast recipients that Volbeat can Baton Pass to when facing a Flying-type. Lastly, Tangrowth is a wonderful recipient when Volbeat is up against a Rhydon.</p> "

Rather, Crustle actually functions at its best on hyper offense teams where it can make the most of its unique attributes. Access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes is a wonderful commodity in the RU tier, which, in tandem with its Sturdy ability, makes it an effectual lead for teams requiring speedy hazard support. What's more, access to Shell Smash allows Crustle to bring a whole new dimension to this role, allowing it to effectively anti-lead a great deal of the metagame. However, even within this role, Crustle faces competition from other Pokemon such as Smeargle and Omastar, both of which can fill very similar, if not identical, roles as Crustle, even going on to outclass it at times depending on the team structure. Furthermore, low Speed and lack of useful resistances consistently restrict Crustle, preventing it from maintaining a more consistent offensive presence and leading it to get \"played around\" at times. While by no means an appropriate Pokemon for any team, Crustle is a strong choice for any offensive team seeking a flexible lead, capable of providing excellent team support under most circumstances.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As could be assumed, Crustle struggles to adequately fulfill a role outside of the lead position under normal circumstances. A dedicated Shell Smash set is an option, and while it is not technically outclassed in this role, it simply does not fare well in the RU metagame; its low Speed leads it to fall short of various relevant Choice Scarf users after a boost (even when factoring in the potential Speed boost from Weak Armor), and while its natural bulk might otherwise have been able to offset this issue, its vulnerability to entry hazards hinders it too heavily. A similar set that looks decent enough on paper but fails in practice is a defensive hazard setter, attempting to play off Crustle's acceptable defensive stats to set up hazards. However, this set too struggles greatly with Crustle's vulnerability to opposing entry hazards, in addition to its sheer lack of relevant resistances, making this role better off left to Pokemon such as Omastar, which retains somewhat better resistances and the ever-significant STAB Scald.</p> <p>As far as alternatives on a lead set go, Flail might be a useful option if the tier occupied more relevant Ground- and Fighting-types that were hit neutrally by it, but with Pokemon such as Golurk, Rhydon, and Steelix being some of the more common leads, Flail tends to fall flat. However, a moderate amount of common defensive Pokemon that will stay in on Crustle are susceptible to Toxic, which makes it a usable alternative over an attacking move if need be. Unfortunately, given the offensive nature of the teams Crustle occupies and the inability for it to spare any of its moveslots, it is rather difficult to implement effectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As it plays mostly in the early-game, Crustle's primary checks and counters are those that can restrict its entry hazards without in turn being dispatched. Kabutops can immediately put Crustle in a difficult position, as it can avoid being OHKOed by any given move, threaten Crustle with its STAB attacks, and potentially spin away any entry hazards Crustle might attempt to set up. Faster sleep inducers such as Jynx and Lilligant can capably shut down and 2HKO Custap lead variants of Crustle without allowing it to set up hazards. However, variants of these Pokemon that run Life Orb risk bringing it into Custap range with an attack, and can therefore be KOed in the proceeding turn should Crustle wake up, and Shell Smash leads easily shrug this off thanks to Lum Berry and subsequently OHKO both. Opposing Rock Blast users such as Cinccino and Rhydon are capable of restricting the amount of hazards Shell Smash leads can set up very nicely, but cannot typically manage similar results against the bulkier Custap lead variants, with Rhydon needing very favorable amounts of hits and damage rolls in order to OHKO it. Furthermore, for teams lacking in such specifics means with which to limit Crustle's entry hazard laying, a fairly effective method of combating it is to play around the Custap Berry by 2HKOing Crustle without bringing it below 25% health in the first attack, thereby effectively restricting it to a single layer of entry hazards. While it can at times be difficult to find a Pokemon capable of doing so and still having the bulk and typing to sponge a hit, certain variants of Bouffalant, Druddigon, and Gallade, among others, are capable of achieving this handily.</p> <p>Though more offensively oriented teams cannot typically give Crustle too much breathing room, as they cannot easily counteract the entry hazards it sets up midway through a game without sacrificing a substantial amount of offensive momentum, defensively oriented teams are somewhat less hard-pressed to restrict Crustle, allowing them the leniency to set up a few layers of entry hazards and spin them away at a later point in the game. In regards to Shell Smash variants, most are fairly easy to revenge kill once Sturdy has been broken, either through Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom, Rotom-C, and Durant, or priority users such as Absol and Kabutops. Furthermore, phazers such as Poliwrath and Steelix can typically prevent Crustle from leaving any sort of lasting impact in an offensive regard, though the damage it deals to them in exchange can at times put them in range of another sweeper, which is one of Crustle's primary goals, making it important to note the consequences of such a play.</p> ",

        "name": "Custap Lead",
        "description": "<p>As a Pokemon capable of utilizing Stealth Rock and Spikes at once, especially backed by Sturdy, Crustle is a natural choice for a dual entry hazards lead. While such a set faces competition from Smeargle, Crustle retains certain perks that make it worthwhile for this role. One of the most significant of these is Crustle's significantly better maneuverability as a hazard setter; while Crustle can similarly ensure multiple layers of entry hazards by merit of Sturdy and Custap Berry, its superior bulk makes it capable of setting up later in a game if need be, making it less reliant on the first few turns of the game to accomplish its goal. This gap in bulk also makes Crustle far more resilient to multi-hit attacks, with Pokemon such as Cinccino and Rhydon becoming far less effective at restricting the amount of entry hazards it can set up. Furthermore, Crustle's better offensive presence allows it to immediately threaten other leads in a way Smeargle simply cannot, such as Scolipede.</p> <p>Thanks to the combination of Sturdy, Custap Berry, and solid natural bulk, Crustle is typically capable of setting up two layers of entry hazards in most games; most defensive Pokemon cannot shut down Crustle without putting it to sleep immediately, and most offensive Pokemon either fall short of 2HKOing Crustle or put it into Custap Berry range in doing so, allowing it to pick up another layer of hazards. While typically reserved to setting up entry hazards, Crustle's ability to attack on its own should not be overlooked. For instance, Crustle's Rock-type STAB moves allow it to effectively prevent Cryogonal from spinning away its entry hazards, as well as generally damaging less bulky Pokemon. For this purpose, Rock Blast is typically the most useful option, as on top of being accurate and moderately powerful, it is also capable of breaking through Substitute and Focus Sash, allowing Crustle to better take on overzealous Substitute users and leads. Stone Edge, while not offering the same utility as Rock Blast, is significantly more consistent in its damage output, which can prove indispensable in acquiring chip damage on Pokemon. In terms of coverage, X-Scissor is often the most consistently useful, as Bug-type STAB allows Crustle to deal significant damage to Slowking, Tangrowth, and Uxie while maintaining reasonable neutral coverage overall. However, Earthquake achieves near-perfect neutral coverage alongside Crustle's Rock-type STAB and also allows Crustle to better chip away at Pokemon such as Golurk and Qwilfish, which Crustle will encounter somewhat commonly in the lead position.</p> <p>220 HP EVs puts Crustle at a total HP stat that is divisible by 16, which allows it to more easily bring itself into Custap Berry range through residual damage. For example, three consecutive switch-in's worth of Stealth Rock damage will bring Crustle into Custap Berry range, allowing it to make better use of the item should it attempt to preserve itself beyond the first few turns of the game. This investment in bulk, alongside the additional 20 Defense EVs, allow Crustle to avoid being KOed outright by attacks such as Cinccino's Rock Blast, specifically avoiding the 2HKO from Golurk's unboosted Earthquake, a common opponent to a lead Crustle. The 44 Speed EVs allow Crustle to outpace minimally invested Tangrowth, allowing it to either set up another layer of entry hazards or X-Scissor Tangrowth before being put to sleep. The remaining EVs are pooled into Attack to make the most of Crustle's moderate offensive presence. One might consider investing solely in Speed and Attack, given the nature of the set, as it would theoretically allow Crustle the opportunity to set up hazards more effectively against slower teams and consequently bring itself into Custap Berry range more consistently. However, it should be worth noting that given how the metagame tends to favor bulkier Pokemon, it is more likely for the extra bulk to benefit Crustle as a hazard setter under most circumstances.</p> <p>As Crustle is primarily functioning as a lead, it doesn't exactly mandate any specific partner Pokemon, though there are certainly solid options for taking advantage of exactly what Crustle brings to the table. The most significant of these options is a spinblocker; as Crustle has no method of directly preserving its own hazards, it is very important to retain the option of preventing Rapid Spin. The most common choice for this role is Rotom, as it is both capable of immediately threatening Kabutops (the most consistent Rapid Spin user in the tier) and generating entry hazard damage with its reasonable offensive presence and access to Volt Switch, though alternatives such as Spiritomb, Misdreavus, and even more offensive variants of Golurk are usable as well. However, given the efficiency of the Rapid Spin users of the tier, it is worth planning one step ahead and utilizing a Pokemon capable of following up that spinblocker and pressuring the spinner in turn. Pertinent examples of these include Durant, Gallade, Manectric, and Sceptile, though various fast Pokemon with relevant coverage options can fill this role comfortably. Ultimately, partners capable of capitalizing on the Spikes support provided is one of the most crucial of partners. Normal-types, such as Tauros and Swellow, benefit greatly from Spikes, as many of their common checks and counters are affected by them.</p> "

        "name": "Shell Smash Lead",
        "description": "<p>By incorporating Shell Smash onto an otherwise-straightforward entry hazard lead, Crustle is capable of significantly increasing its flexibility in the lead position. Perhaps one of the most desirable benefits this set offers is that of effectively anti-leading a plethora of common offensive leads very effectively while retaining utility value; Pokemon such as Scolipede and Smeargle consistently struggle to match up with this set, either forgoing their entry hazards of choice entirely or conceding a +2 Crustle with intact Sturdy for a single layer. While this is Crustle's most favorable match-up, it does not necessarily restrict its usefulness, as it is more than capable of functioning as a basic hazard lead against more defensively oriented teams. Furthermore, after entry hazards are accounted for, Crustle can utilize Shell Smash to apply significant offensive pressure to opposing teams, even sweeping under the right conditions (though this typically is not the case).</p> <p>The combination of Shell Smash, Rock Blast, and Lum Berry is what makes Crustle so effective in combating opposing lead Pokemon, allowing it to significantly limit their performance and immediately threaten the opponent with a Shell Smash boost. Against leads such as Scolipede, Smeargle, and Uxie Crustle can comfortably Shell Smash without fear of immediate repercussion, being able to absorb a singular status move then follow up with a Rock Blast, breaking through the potential Focus Sash and forcing the opponent to respond to a boosted, potentially Sturdy-backed sweeper. This process can similarly function against teams that utilize fast sleep inducers, such as Jynx and Lilligant, to restrict Crustle's hazard laying capabilities. However, as this match-up will not be constantly relevant to Crustle, it is important to provide an alternative option to round out its usefulness as a lead, making entry hazards a perfect option for it. Typically, Spikes is preferable in this slot, since in addition to its limited distribution in comparison to Stealth Rock, it also makes more of the free turns Crustle finds against more defensively oriented teams, where its role as a Shell Smash sweeper is far less significant. However, depending on individual necessity, certain teams will require Crustle to utilize Stealth Rock itself, and it is by no means a bad option. As this particular Crustle is capable of exerting far more significant offensive pressure than a non-boosting variant, Earthquake's better neutral coverage alongside Rock Blast makes it the more consistent coverage move, allowing it to significantly damage Pokemon such as Golurk, Qwilfish, and Steelix, wearing them down for a more dedicated sweeper. However, the amount of relevant targets hit by Bug-type STAB is reason enough for X-Scissor to be given consideration, and more specifically is Crustle's most effective move to handle lead Uxie and Mesprit with.</p> <p>Adamant is the nature of choice, with the boost in damage output being highly appreciated. As far as optimizing its potential as an anti-lead, a Lum Berry is the most effective item for ensuring that Crustle is not crippled before fulfilling its role, more specifically allowing it to Shell Smash against Smeargle without being shut down by Spore and proceeding to OHKO with Rock Blast. Similarly, while Crustle could technically utilize Stone Edge over Rock Blast for a more consistent attack in terms of damage output, it would disallow Crustle from KOing opposing leads through their respective Focus Sashes.</p> <p>As Crustle is played most commonly as a lead, partners should be geared primarily towards making the most of the support Crustle provides. As the most significant niche of this Crustle set is its ability to gain an early-game advantage against opposing offensive teams, it accomplishes very little against more defensive ones aside from providing entry hazard support, making it worthwhile to invest in Pokemon capable of threatening common defensive cores. Examples of this range from Pokemon with relevant offensive typing and offensive presence, such as Moltres and Durant, to mixed attackers with appropriate coverage moves, such as Life Orb Druddigon and mixed Sceptile. In the case of more balanced teams, which perhaps have limited responses to boosting physical attackers, it is worth considering strong physical sweepers, such as Durant, Tauros, and Swords Dance Absol, to back Crustle, as the chip damage it provides through entry hazards and attacks of its own can help pave the way for a sweep. While not integral to the set's success, having a spinner such as Cryogonal or Kabutops can significantly increase Crustle's flexibility, allowing it to maintain its Sturdy further into the game.</p> "

  "Cryogonal": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier with multiple hazard setters and few Rapid Spin users, Cryogonal's ability to provide Rapid Spin support is highly appreciated. Cryogonal's stat distribution and ability to heal quickly with Recover allow it to keep entry hazards off the field throughout the match. Levitate gives Cryogonal an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, but sadly its weakness to Stealth Rock remains. A pitiful base 30 Defense limits Cryogonal's flexibility, as it is not able take full advantage of its high Special Defense; it must run a high amount of Defense EVs in order to have less trouble against Pursuit users and other physical attackers, mainly one of the only Ghost-types that can spinblock against Cryogonal: Spiritomb. In order to prevent itself from being worn down, Cryogonal can use dual screens, Haze, or use an offensive set in order to knock out the opponent before Cryogonal goes down itself. Cryogonal usually finds its place on a defensive team, though, which comes as no surprise as there is no doubt that it is the best bulky Rapid Spin user in the tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A dual screens set with Light Clay is a usable option, as Cryogonal can set up Reflect and Light Screen quickly and consistently thanks to its high Speed and access to Recover, respectively; this set pairs well with setup sweepers. Rain Dance can be used to support rain teams, and Cryogonal has the advantage of stopping opposing Ludicolo and Jynx, which can both take advantage of the weather condition. Frost Breath, though quite situational, is a good option to obtain critical hits on opposing Calm Mind users such as Sigilyph and Spiritomb. However, Haze will almost always be the superior choice. Among the other moves Cryogonal has, it can use Acid Armor to raise its Defense, though a physically defensive partner is much more convenient. Finally, if you're a gimmicky player, a physical set with Poison Jab, Night Slash, Ice Shard, and Explosion will be for you.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As for Pokemon that can block Rapid Spin, Spiritomb is the best option, even though it gets worn down easily; Tricking a Choice Band onto Cryogonal, or using a combination of Black Glasses and Return can quickly limit Cryogonal's effectiveness. Physical attackers are no doubt the most threatening Pokemon to Cryogonal, as they will take advantage of its miserable Defense. Durant, Escavalier, Aggron, and Klinklang all have nothing to fear besides the rare Hidden Power, and can OHKO with a STAB move. Fire-types in general are a major threat, as Pokemon like Entei and Typhlosion resist Ice Beam and Hidden Power Fire and can blow past Cryogonal's defenses with sheer power. Similarly, those that resist Ice Beam, such as Kabutops, Crawdaunt, and Feraligatr, can set up on Cryogonal or simply KO it. Qwilfish in particular is an effective counter, as it can threaten Cryogonal out with a STAB Waterfall and proceed to set up Spikes. Steelix and Rhydon are other threatening Pokemon that will usually be able to keep their entry hazards up against Cryogonal. Fighting-types such as Gallade, Hariyama, and Primeape leave Cryogonal completely defenseless, and the former two also boast good bulk (and Thick Fat in the case of Hariyama). Psyshock users, specifically Slowking and Uxie, can also capitalize on Cryogonal's low Defense and set up all over it. Finally, even with some Defense investment, Pursuit users such as the aforementioned Spiritomb and Escavalier can trap and do a number on Cryogonal.</p> ",

        "name": "Rapid Spin",
        "description": "<p>This set is dedicated to Cryogonal's rare ability to Rapid Spin. Its good Speed and Special Attack allow it to outspeed and wear down opposing Ghost-types, such as Spiritomb and Misdreavus, while it is still bulky enough to take on Rotom. Recover provides Cryogonal with longevity, allowing it to switch in multiple times and spin away entry hazards. Quick recovery is also necessary when dealing with offensive Spiritomb and Escavalier, as their Pursuits will leave Cryogonal weakened, but not completely useless if it gets the chance to use Recover. The last moveslot is generally based on your team's needs. Haze is useful for putting a stop to setup sweepers like Lilligant, Sigilyph, and Jynx; it can also force a Pokemon such as Swords Dance Kabutops to KO Cryogonal instead of getting boosts so a teammate can come in freely on a much less powerful Kabutops. Toxic is useful in that it can wear down Pokemon that might wall or set up on Cryogonal, including Slowking, Uxie, and Entei. Finally, Reflect is extremely useful when dealing with physical attackers. Using it to predict when a physical attacker, such as Escavalier, will switch in can save Cryogonal's--or even a teammate's--life.</p> <p>Cryogonal's EV spread is very useful and quite necessary if it wants to Rapid Spin with ease. 248 HP EVs allow it to take less damage from Stealth Rock upon each switch in. The Defense EVs let Cryogonal survive a Choice Band Spiritomb's Sucker Punch, as well as not be 2HKOed by the same Spiritomb's Shadow Sneak or Pursuit; this also applies to Escavalier's Pursuit. 0 Attack IVs are used in order to minimize the damage that Cryogonal takes from Spiritomb's Foul Play. Bumping the Speed EVs up to 56 is an option, as it allows Cryogonal to outspeed neutral nature base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Gallade. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to absorb hits from the likes of Rotom, Tangrowth, and other special attackers. Cryogonal is not limited to this EV spread, though. If you are not concerned about Spiritomb and other Pursuit trappers, a spread of 248 HP / 136 SpD / 124 Spe allows Cryogonal to outspeed max Speed Smeargle and maintain a good amount of Special Defense. Cryogonal's EV spread can easily be manipulated to fit its team's needs.</p> <p>Cryogonal can also use a Hidden Power of choice in the last slot. Hidden Power Fire 2HKOes Escavalier and damages other Steel-types such as Steelix and Klinklang. Hidden Power Ground also hits Steel-types, particularly Aggron, as well as Fire-types like Entei and Typhlosion. Teammates that can deal with these types of Pokemon are much appreciated. Poliwrath and Slowking have excellent synergy with Cryogonal, and form a solid defensive core. Because Cryogonal has a low Defense stat, Psyshock users such as Sigilyph and Mesprit threaten it; thus, Spiritomb or Drapion are good teammates. Partners that can take out hazard users are also welcomed, so Cryogonal can spin just once and not have to worry about hazards for the rest of the game. Spiritomb and Escavalier come to mind, as they can trap Uxie and Roselia. Of course, Pokemon that are weak to entry hazards love Cryogonal's support, so pairing it with something like Moltres is always helpful.</p> "

As this Cryogonal will most likely be used on an offensive team, a fast Rapid Spin is great for maintaining momentum and keeping your sweepers healthy. Hidden Power Fire is recommended in order to eliminate Steel-types, especially Escavalier. However, Cryogonal must use a Life Orb in order to have a chance to OHKO Escavalier. This is risky, though, as Cryogonal will most likely have trouble dealing with the residual damage. For this reason, Recover is the number one choice for the last slot, curing damage and allowing Cryogonal to continue its job.</p> <p>Icicle Plate boosts the power of Cryogonal's most used move, and as stated above, prevents it from taking any residual damage through Life Orb. The Speed EVs allow Cryogonal to outspeed max Speed Timid Sigilyph and everything below, which is extremely useful in dealing with other threats such as Drapion and Moltres; note that 252 Speed EVs can be used in order to Speed tie with Scyther and non-Choice Scarf Manectric. 64 HP EVs bring Cryogonal's HP to a number indivisible by 4, allowing it to minimize Stealth Rock damage, while Special Attack is maximized. A Modest nature can be used for more power, but Cryogonal will be slower than Drapion and Sigilyph which is very unfavorable. Hidden Power Ground can be used instead of Hidden Power Fire, as it still maintains super effective damage on Steel-types, but also hits Fire-types, Kabutops, Qwilfish, and Lanturn.</p> <p>Offensive Cryogonal makes for a solid pivot on offensive teams, as these types of teams greatly appreciate the removal of entry hazards. As a bonus, Cryogonal can keep the offensive pressure by hitting reasonably hard. Moltres and Entei appreciate this support the most, but they would normally be paired with Rapid Spin Kabutops due to the superior synergy; however, Cryogonal comes with the benefit of reliable recovery and additional bulk, allowing it to compete with Kabutops. Note that this set is much less bulky than the Rapid Spin set, and should be played to its strengths. Thus, teammates that can set up on the offensive switch-ins that plague Cryogonal can be very beneficial to the team. Pokemon that can set up on Spiritomb, such as Absol, or other threats like Feraligatr, such as Sceptile and Lilligant, make for great partners.</p> "

Don't get too excited though; Weezing, although bulky, is not impossible to break through. Weezing's Special Defense is nothing compared to his Defense and he will fold to powerful special attacks. Despite having recovery, Pain Split is not very reliable on a weakened Pokemon, so Weezing has issues taking repeated physical attacks.

Entei is one of the few physical attackers that can stop Weezing, being immune to Will-O-Wisp and seriously hurting Weezing with Flare Blitz. Medicham can lure in Weezing expecting to take a High Jump Kick and 2HKO with Zen Headbutt. Swellow can take advantage of the burn from Will-O-Wisp and threaten Weezing with a STAB Facade, but cannot absorb a Thunderbolt.

Rest is an option over Pain Split if you want a method to remove status. If you use Rest, it is recommended that you use Sleep Talk over one of the attacking moves.

This set would be better suited to a more defensive team than the Swords Dance + Baton Pass set. That being said, Leafeon doesn't have a very good HP stat, so there are likely better Wish users for your team. Leafeon also faces a lot of competition from Tangrowth as a defensive Grass-type, as Tangrowth has more natural bulk and better coverage to go alongside its Grass-type STAB move, as well as simply having the ability to last much longer. Aside from that, most of the other things that Leafeon can do are done better by Sawsbuck. Things like Choice Band or Choice Scarf sets, or a Substitute + Swords Dance set, simply cater better to Sawsbuck's superior movepool and typing. Leafeon does have a redeeming quality in that its Substitutes are more physically bulky, but this is still not a good enough reason to justify its use. Leafeon can use status moves like Toxic, Yawn, and Sing, but there is just not enough room for them on the set, and they are not good enough to replace one of the four moves. Roar can be used in tandem with hazards to beat opposing phazers, but there are more effective ways to deal with all of the common ones.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Though it is easily beatable on its own, Leafeon's overall strategy is nearly impossible to fully counter due to the nature of Baton Pass. Clear Smog Amoonguss is about as close as they come to a full stop to Leafeon's game, as it can damage Leafeon while erasing the boosts of a switch-in. However, if Leafeon Baton Passes to a Steel-type such as Aggron, Amoonguss's efforts will be in vain. If nothing on Leafeon's team has been put to sleep, though, Amoonguss can cause some mind games with Spore. Phazers are also a good way to deal with Leafeon, specifically Mandibuzz and Dragon Tail Druddigon. Steelix is not included in this because it is a rather poor stop to Leafeon, as Leafeon can break through it over time and Roar only delays the inevitable by phazing Leafeon so it can't defeat Steelix one-on-one. Mandibuzz has the best chance of beating Leafeon as only the nonexistent Roar can discourage it from using Whirlwind (although this can backfire if Whirlwind brings out something that threatens Mandibuzz and forces it out with Stealth Rock up), and it can also use Foul Play to hit many of Leafeon's receivers extremely hard. Druddigon is nearly foolproof as a counter if not for the fact that it has no reliable recovery and also that Dragon Tail can miss.</p> <p>Leafeon is forced out by a large amount of threats in the metagame, but many of these can be taken advantage of with Baton Pass. Sigilyph and Durant are exceptionally good Leafeon checks because they are faster, and Leafeon cannot Baton Pass out of them with a boost unless Sigilyph cannot OHKO it. Several other prominent threats such as Entei, Moltres, Roselia, Druddigon, Escavalier, Bouffalant, and Tangrowth can all stop Leafeon as well, although almost all of these will be covered by Leafeon's receivers, making dealing with Leafeon risky business. If needed, faster threats that are either special attackers or can hit Leafeon super effectively can also deal with it. Manectric and Swellow are examples of these kinds of threats. Overall, beating Leafeon on its own is easy for any competent team, but its overall strategy is rather good and difficult to stop. Offensive teams can deal with Leafeon more easily, though, as they can limit Leafeon by preventing it from getting any switch-in opportunities in the first place or outspeeding it if it does get into battle.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance + Baton Pass",
        "description": "<p>This set works best against slower and bulkier teams such as bulky offense, balance, or even more defensive teams. Leafeon's strategy is simple and linear. Firstly, Leafeon needs to actually get into battle against something that it can force out. Luckily, this isn't hard at all, as Leafeon can switch in on many common threats found on all different types of teams; Kabutops, Rhydon, Slowking, Alomomola, Uxie, and more are prime switch-in opportunities, although some of these Pokemon can hurt Leafeon depending on their set. Next, feel free to set up a Swords Dance, as your opponent will likely switch to a Grass-type counter such as Druddigon, Amoonguss, or Entei. Then, Leafeon can use Baton Pass to switch out of these threatening foes to something more apt to take them on. An important reason why this will work most of the time is that Leafeon is faster than most of the metagame, and nearly all of its best checks are slower than it. Now, the teammate on the receiving end of the Swords Dance boost is ready to wreak havoc. To get an idea of how much Leafeon can help its team with a boost, here are some damage calculations involving some ideal receivers:</p> <ul> <li>252+ Choice Band Entei Flare Blitz vs. 248/144 Slowking: 76.3-90% <li>252+ Choice Band Entei Flare Blitz vs. 252/240+ Intimidate Qwilfish: 64.3-76%</li> <li>252+ Choice Band Entei Flare Blitz vs. 252/252+ Alomomola: 46-54.1%</li> <li>252+ Choice Band Aggron Head Smash vs. 252/252+ Alomomola: 112.1-131%</li> <li>252+ Choice Band Aggron Head Smash vs. 156/0 Golurk: 120.3-141.6%</li> <li>252+ Choice Band Aggron Head Smash vs. 252/0 Eviolite Rhydon: 49.2-57.9%</li> <li>252+ Choice Band Escavalier Megahorn vs. 252/252+ Poliwrath: 64-75.7%</li> <li>252+ Choice Band Escavalier Megahorn vs. 252/252+ Alomomola: 103.3-121.5%</li> <li>252+ Choice Band Druddigon Outrage vs. 252/252+ Alomomola: 94.9-111.7%</li> <li>252+ Choice Band Druddigon Outrage vs. 252/252+ Eviolite Ferroseed: 53-62.6%</li> <li>252+ Choice Band Druddigon Outrage vs. 252/252+ Tangrowth: 92.8-109.4%</li> </ul> <p>As you can see, the damage output of some of Leafeon's best teammates is quite ridiculous after a Swords Dance boost. Slower teams will seriously struggle to find anything that can beat these behemoths. Leafeon does have another dimension to its strategy, though, and its remaining moves allow it to accomplish this. Against more offensive teams, Leafeon is able to serve as a good check to some of the metagame's most prominent threats like Kabutops. Leaf Blade allows Leafeon to actually damage its foes, and it is decently powerful after a Swords Dance boost. In theory, Leafeon would be able to sweep once all of your opponent's Grass-type resistances have been removed, but this is actually very hard to do in practice because there are just so many of them in the metagame. Baton Pass can also be used to gain momentum easily against offensive teams, as dry passing to a counter is extremely effective and impossible to stop. Synthesis gives Leafeon some added survivability to ensure that it can execute its strategy multiple times over the course of a match. It also ensures that Leafeon is difficult to wear down with hazards against teams that use Spikes. It may also allow Leafeon to get another Swords Dance boost under its belt, though one is usually plenty to Baton Pass to a teammate.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Speed EVs make Leafeon the best pivot it can be; Leafeon needs to outspeed as many threats as possible while retaining as much bulk as possible after that. Leftovers is the preferred item choice to ensure that Leafeon doesn't go down easily, but a Lum Berry can be used as well if avoiding status becomes a major issue. However, you should only use Lum Berry if you are deathly afraid of Leafeon getting paralyzed, as the only other status that significantly impacts its effectiveness is burn. Note that Pokemon that can put Leafeon to sleep or freeze it are generally not good ones to switch into in the first place. Also, Toxic is not a big deal to Leafeon, as it rarely spends more than two or three consecutive turns in battle. Chlorophyll is Leafeon's best ability, as it will be more useful than Leaf Guard against the rare sun team. Leafeon can also use Heal Bell on this set; however, it is not recommended because that would mean giving up either Swords Dance or Baton Pass, both of which are needed to make this set effective. Leafeon could also forgo Baton Pass or Synthesis for Return to gain coverage against many Pokemon that resist Leaf Blade. However, this is essentially making Leafeon a worse Sawsbuck, whose superior power, coverage, and additional Normal-type STAB make it a better Swords Dance sweeper than Leafeon.</p> <p>Leafeon needs a good amount of support from its teammates to reach its maximum effectiveness. Good receivers for Baton Pass are necessary; a good receiver is one that can easily cover Leafeon's weaknesses while also boasting a great deal of power after a Swords Dance boost. Ideally, Leafeon wants at least two different receivers, but this is not an issue because RU has many good candidates for this job. Entei is one of the best receivers, as it can switch into many threats that Leafeon has trouble with, including Amoonguss, Roselia, and Escavalier to an extent (Choice Band-boosted Megahorn hurts). Kabutops can switch into Moltres and Entei with relative ease. Escavalier can switch into Druddigon, Amoonguss, Bouffalant, and opposing Escavalier (although this can end up in a stalemate or worse depending on how much Speed or bulk both you and your opponent are running). Druddigon can switch into Entei and all the Grass-types that give Leafeon trouble, as well as Moltres if you get lucky with a Hurricane miss or two. Aggron can switch into Druddigon (don't get caught by Earthquake or Superpower), Escavalier, some Sigilyph variants, and Bouffalant (again, avoid Earthquake). There are other receivers that can work, like Durant, but these are among the best.</p> <p>Leafeon can also benefit from more defensively inclined partners. These teammates can be dry passed to to gain momentum, or they can benefit from a Swords Dance boost if they use physical attacks. Alomomola is a great physical wall that can stop nearly every physical threat in the metagame along with Leafeon, and it can also pass Wishes to Leafeon. Using Leafeon with Alomomola is one of the few instances where it can be beneficial to drop Synthesis on Leafeon for Heal Bell; Synthesis could end up being redundant while Heal Bell is appreciated on nearly every team. Hazard setters can also benefit Leafeon greatly, as the extra damage allows Leafeon and its receivers to destroy the opponent that much more easily. Both Steelix and Regirock are good Stealth Rock users that can check some of the threats that beat Leafeon, such as Escavalier and Moltres respectively. They both use physical attacks as well, so they benefit from a Swords Dance boost. Spikes aren't as necessary because Leafeon's receivers are already obnoxiously powerful and there often isn't enough room to fit Spikes, but if you can fit a Qwilfish or Roselia on your team, Leafeon will surely benefit from it. A field full of hazards on your opponent's side allows Leafeon to dry pass very effectively and make it nearly impossible to wall its receivers.</p> "

  "Gallade": {
    "overview": "<p>Gallade is the most versatile Fighting-type in RU. With a great stat spread, superb movepool, and solid typing, Gallade is capable of running many sets, ranging from a Choice Band set to a specially defensive set and almost everything in between. Gallade's versatility is further enhanced by setup moves such as Swords Dance, Substitute, and Bulk Up, along with a very high Attack stat. Additionally, Gallade's great Special Defense allows Gallade to run bulkier boosting sets while its typing leaves it with few exploitable weaknesses. This unpredictability leads to major difficulty when dealing with Gallade, as simply knowing what setup move it has won't make it any easier to handle.</p> <p>Gallade has a few limitations that keep it from plowing through most teams. It suffers one of the most severe cases of four-moveslot syndrome in RU, as it will never be able to cover all of RU's major threats at once. The ubiquity of Spiritomb also doesn't help either, as it's immune to both of Gallade's STABs and has the bulk to handle anything else Gallade tries to throw at it offensively. Gallade's base Speed might be good, but it's not blazing fast, and a low Defense stat means most faster physical attackers will force Gallade off the field. Nevertheless, Gallade is a top threat and should be prepared for when building any team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thanks to its wide movepool, Gallade has plenty of other options at its disposal. A Choice Scarf set seems like a perfect fit thanks to Gallade's base 125 Attack and a somewhat middling Speed stat when not holding said item. However, Medicham is much better for this role thanks to Pure Power. Gallade has the elemental punches available to it, but for the most part, they aren't really useful when compared to Gallade's main attacks. Earthquake is powerful, but it runs into the same problems that the elemental punches do. Like many other Psychic-types, Gallade has access to Calm Mind, as well as various special moves such as Psyshock, Focus Blast, and Thunderbolt. However, a paltry base 65 Special Attack makes this a bad option for Gallade.</p> <p>In terms of support options, a combination of Taunt and Will-O-Wisp can be used to break down stall teams, but these types of teams aren't too common in RU. A dual screens set with Memento is usable, but it faces stiff competition from Uxie and Mesprit in this role, as both have better overall bulk than Gallade. A set utilizing Trick Room is possible to make up for Gallade's mediocre Speed. However, it still runs into competition with Uxie and Mesprit, and on top of that, it lets major threats such as Escavalier and Druddigon outspeed Gallade. Destiny Bond is gimmicky, but it can net a surprise kill every once and a while. Finally, a SubDisable set is possible a la Gengar in OU, but Gallade's lack of immunities limits its viability.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gallade is difficult to counter due to its versatility, power, coverage, and support options, but there are ways to deal with each set. Spiritomb, specifically with a defensive set, is the best response, as it is able to handle every Gallade set thanks to its immunity to both of Gallade's STABs, solid bulk and Foul Play. If it lacks Rest, however, it must be careful around specially defensive sets because Will-O-Wisp can cripple offensive Spiritomb. Choice Specs Slowking can tank all of Gallade's unboosted attacks and can OHKO with Psyshock; similarly, defensive Slowking can take hits more easily and 2HKO with Psyshock or burn Gallade with Scald. Moltres and Mesprit are two of the safer options to handle Gallade, as each resists one or both of Gallade's STAB moves. can outspeed, and only fear one of its coverage moves. Perhaps the easiest way to deal with Gallade is to use its major case of four-moveslot syndrome to your advantage. Most sets use a setup move and two STAB moves, so finding out its coverage move will go a long way when handling Gallade. If Gallade lacks Leaf Blade, Alomomola and Quagsire can handle it admirably. Without Night Slash, Mesprit becomes all the more dangerous while Uxie can generally outlast Gallade in most scenarios. Tangrowth only fears a +2 Close Combat and the rare Ice Punch and X-Scissor, and it can KO a slightly weakened Gallade with a STAB Power Whip on its weaker Defense stat. However, Bulk Up sets can set up on Tangrowth without Power Whip. Escavalier is capable of overpowering Gallade with its powerful STAB Megahorn, but the Substitute set 2HKOes with Drain Punch and might have a Substitute up to block Escavalier's first attack, and the specially defensive set can cripple Escavalier with a burn. The specially defensive set struggles with most Flying-types; Pokemon such as Braviary, Moltres, and Sigilyph are more than capable of dealing with this set. Cinccino can easily check the Substitute set, but it has no hope of actually switching into it thanks to its frailty.</p> <p>Preying on Gallade's base 80 Speed and lackluster base 65 Defense is perhaps the easiest way to limit the damage Gallade can do. Choice Scarf users such as Emboar and Braviary do quite well, while naturally fast Pokemon such as Swellow, Tauros, and Durant are capable of smashing Gallade before it gets a chance to strike them. Pokemon that can take a hit and KO back with a STAB move, such as Golurk and Exeggutor, can check Gallade as well. Priority users can also be effective, with examples being Entei, Spiritomb, and Feraligatr. Note that Sucker Punch users such as Absol run the risk of activating Justified if they are unable to KO Gallade and will likely be hit with a decisive blow after the attack. As Gallade will often want to use a setup move before attacking, one can always resort to offensive pressure to limit Gallade's chances to setup. However, this is risky as Gallade usually has enough raw power and coverage to do damage even without a setup move, and the Choice Band set doesn't set up at all.</p> ",

        "name": "Bulky Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>This is Gallade's most commonly seen set in RU. With a base 125 Attack stat, a solid base 115 Special Defense, and a decent typing both offensively and defensively, a bulky Swords Dance set fits Gallade perfectly. This is aided by Gallade's decent base 80 Speed, which allows it to outspeed most defensive Pokemon with minimal investment.</p> <p>Swords Dance is Gallade's boosting move of choice on this set. Once Gallade gets in, it can easily threaten out an opposing Pokemon and set up a Swords Dance on the switch. Drain Punch is the primary STAB move, which has solid power, great coverage, and the ability to restore Gallade's HP which sets it apart from other offensive sets by significantly increasing its longevity. This is important as few Pokemon possess the ability to outspeed and OHKO Gallade. Psycho Cut is a solid secondary STAB move that is able to get past many Pokemon that can take Drain Punch, such as Qwilfish, Amoonguss, and opposing Gallade. The last slot gives Gallade coverage on Pokemon that can handle its STAB combination. Night Slash is preferred to handle Mesprit, Sigilyph, and Uxie. However, Leaf Blade is an option to get past Alomomola, Quagsire, and Rhydon, the latter of which is not OHKOed by +2 Drain Punch when holding Eviolite and can retaliate with a powerful STAB Earthquake that will leave Gallade extremely susceptible to the next thing that comes in. Regardless of whether one chooses Night Slash or Leaf Blade, both will hit Slowking and Golurk hard, which is important as both can handle Gallade's STAB moves and retaliate with Psyshock or Shadow Punch, respectively.</p> <p>56 Speed EVs allow Gallade to jump ahead of neutral base 55s such as Omastar and Bouffalant. The remaining EVs get placed in HP to improve Gallade's overall bulk. Lum Berry is the best item for this set, as it gives Gallade a one-time immunity to status, which is important when trying to set up against more defensive teams. However, Leftovers is also an option, as Gallade will take its fair share of hits during a sweep and a single round of Leftovers recovery can sometimes be just what Gallade needs to survive an incoming attack and KO its target. X-Scissor is the most notable coverage move not used on this set, being the best move Gallade has for Tangrowth and still retaining coverage on all Psychic-types except for Sigilyph. Stone Edge is an option for crushing Moltres while also hitting Spiritomb harder than any other move. Finally, Shadow Sneak is an option to pick off weakened threats, but it still isn't very strong even after a boost and will struggle to KO many threats unless they have a low Defense stat.</p> <p>Entry hazards are a necessity for this set in order to compensate for the lower power of Drain Punch. On offensive teams, Omastar, Scolipede, and Smeargle are effective partners while more balanced teams can use Ferroseed, Rhydon, and Qwilfish. Spiritomb is an absolute pain for this set, as it can survive any boosted attack and 2HKO Gallade with Shadow Sneak or OHKO it with Foul Play after a Swords Dance boost. Emboar is a very good partner for this reason, as not only does it handle Spiritomb nicely, but it also deals with Escavalier, another major problem for this set. Other Fire-types, such as Typhlosion, Entei, and Moltres, can also be used to handle these threats. Entei and Moltres can are also royal pains for this set in addition to being good partners; Qwilfish is able to check Entei and Escavalier while Lanturn is a good answer to Moltres. Paralysis support is welcome so Gallade doesn't have to take as many hits. The aforementioned Qwilfish and Lanturn are solid options to provide this, as are Ferroseed and specially defensive Druddigon. Although it has Night Slash, Gallade will have some problems with Sigilyph thanks to its powerful Flying-type STAB. Spiritomb can be used to trap and KO Sigilyph to ensure Gallade's sweep isn't interrupted. Mesprit is also a feasible option thanks to having access to both Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, while its access to Healing Wish can also give Gallade a second chance to sweep if it gets stopped earlier on.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + 3 Attacks",
        "description": "<p>While Gallade is capable of boosting its Attack stat with Swords Dance and Bulk Up, a simple Substitute + 3 Attacks set suits Gallade very nicely. Thanks to the sheer offensive presence Gallade imposes when it enters the battle, it can force many switches, thus buying it time to set up a Substitute to ease prediction and showcase its great coverage.</p> <p>Substitute shields Gallade from revenge killers and status moves, which are two common methods of dealing with it. Once it's behind a Substitute, Gallade can unleash its great power and coverage to pick apart the opposing team. Drain Punch is the chosen STAB move and it gives this set great staying power. With it, Gallade is able to deal serious damage and heal itself of the HP it lost through making Substitutes and Life Orb recoil. Gallade's coverage move comes down to whether you need it to be more of a standalone attacker or a lure for a teammate. Night Slash is the more useful move for Gallade itself as it easily 2HKOes Uxie, Mesprit, and Sigilyph. This allows Gallade to better handle Uxie, and to seriously dent or KO two of the most common offensive responses to Gallade. However, if you need Gallade to handle physical walls to aid a teammate, then Leaf Blade is perfectly usable. With it, Gallade is able to take on the likes of Alomomola, Rhydon, and Quagsire without a second thought, which can easily clear a path for a teammate to sweep unimpeded. Regardless of the move you choose, both will hit Slowking, a very common threat, for super effective damage. Psycho Cut fills up the last moveslot as it allows Gallade to get past Qwilfish and Amoonguss without much difficulty, while also OHKOing Emboar, a common revenge killer that typically targets Gallade.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is used to ensure Gallade outspeeds positive base 75s, notably Smeargle. Although you can use an Adamant nature to give Gallade more power, the ability to outspeed Smeargle unconditionally is usually too important to give up. If Gallade outspeeds Smeargle, then it's unable to cripple Gallade with Spore. With the offensive EV spread, it's easy to understand that you would want to use Close Combat. However, this is not advised under any circumstances as the staying power and flexibility Drain Punch brings is just too good to give up. The reason Gallade is able to use a Life Orb in the first place is because of the healing side effect of Drain Punch, and the use of Life Orb will help to offset the power difference between Drain Punch and Close Combat. X-Scissor is the most notable coverage move that can be used on this set. It's the strongest move Gallade has to handle Tangrowth, and it will retain coverage on all Psychic-types with the exception of Sigilyph. Stone Edge is another alternative coverage move that can be used if you absolutely hate Sigilyph and Moltres. However, Sigilyph is hit hard enough by Night Slash and Moltres is OHKOed by Psycho Cut after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Entry hazard support will go a long way to supporting this set as the opponent will likely be forced to switch again after Gallade sets up a Substitute. Smeargle, Omastar, and Scolipede can provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support for more offensive-minded teams while more balanced teams can turn to the likes of Rhydon, Qwilfish, Ferroseed, and Mesprit for this support. Druddigon particularly makes for a very solid partner as it can not only set up Stealth Rock, but it can also keep up offensive pressure. As Gallade isn't the fastest thing in RU, paralysis support can be helpful as well to make it even easier for Gallade to sweep late-game. The aforementioned Ferroseed can provide this support on top of Spikes support while keeping Spiritomb in check without too much difficulty. Lanturn can also provide paralysis support and check Moltres throughout the match. It can also provide cleric support and use a slow Volt Switch to allow Gallade to switch in freely. Because this Gallade can be both a sweeper and a wallbreaker, it's very easy to form an offensive core with. Most Fire-types work very well with this set. Emboar is a great example, as it can easily check Spiritomb and Tangrowth, and it cleans up weakened teams with Flare Blitz after Gallade has done its job. Other Fire-types such as Typhlosion, Entei, and Moltres can also be effective in this regard. Without Night Slash, a Pursuit user such as Absol or Escavalier can be effective to trap Psychic-types such as Uxie and Mesprit. If Gallade forgoes Leaf Blade, it will need help to get around Alomomola and Quagsire. Grass-types such as Sceptile, Rotom-C, and Lilligant fit the bill nicely as they will find it much easier to sweep if Gallade has removed special walls. On the other hand, you can use a Spikes user such as Ferroseed or Roselia to take advantage of the low offensive presence these two Water-types have, which could help Gallade break past them later.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>This is a more offensive approach to Swords Dance. While this set lacks the longevity and flexibility of its bulkier counterpart, this Gallade is much less reliant on boosting to leave its mark on the opposing team. Swords Dance skyrockets Gallade's already dangerous Attack stat, while Close Combat is the chosen Fighting STAB move, as its incredible 120 Base Power allows Gallade to even weaken some Pokemon that resist Fighting-type moves after a boost. Psycho Cut is Gallade's secondary STAB move and hits the likes of Qwilfish and Amoonguss much harder than Close Combat would. Night Slash is the preferred option in the final slot, allowing Gallade to get past bulky Psychic-types such as Uxie, Slowking, and Mesprit much more easily. However, Shadow Sneak is an option to fend off revenge killers and faster, frail Pokemon like Rotom and Archeops looking to take advantage of the defense drops caused by using Close Combat.</p> <p>Because Close Combat lowers Gallade's defenses with each use, a fully offensive EV spread is utilized. A Lum Berry is still the preferred item to get a one-time immunity to status, which can often mean the difference between a sweep and a crippled Gallade. However, a Life Orb is certainly viable, as with a Life Orb, Gallade is even less reliant on boosting than it already is and can be turned into more of a wallbreaker. Adamant is the preferred nature to give Gallade more power and to, again, lessen the reliance on setting up to deal major damage. However, Jolly can be used if outspeeding neutral-natured base 92s and below, such as Rotom-C, Hitmonlee, and Lilligant, is desired. Leaf Blade is the only coverage option worth considering. Although a super effective Leaf Blade only hits as hard as a neutral Close Combat, it can be useful against the likes of Rhydon and Alomomola when the defense drops from Close Combat aren't desired. However, Night Slash and Shadow Sneak are generally the better moves to use.</p> <p>Gallade appreciates entry hazard support to gain more KOs and ensure that its targets can't take advantage of the defense drops from using Close Combat. Smeargle, Omastar, and Accelgor can utilize entry hazards on more offensive teams, and Druddigon, Roselia, and Uxie can be used on more balanced teams. With the defense drops from Close Combat, this Gallade is extremely vulnerable to being revenge killed. For this reason, paralysis support from Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Lanturn, and Slowking can be very helpful. As always, Spiritomb is an absolute pain for Gallade, as Gallade has no hope of OHKOing it while Spiritomb's Shadow Sneak does a real number on it. For this reason, Emboar, Entei, and Aggron are all good partners as they can all effectively handle Spiritomb. Sigilyph is problematic thanks to its STAB Air Slash and Psyshock. A Spiritomb of your own can trap and KO Sigilyph with Pursuit so Gallade can sweep without fear later. Fast attackers are solid teammates as they can pick up Gallade's slack if it can't complete its sweep. Sceptile, Swellow, and Choice Scarf variants of Rotom-C, Emboar, and Braviary can all work nicely in this role. Other powerful attackers such as Druddigon and Durant work well with Gallade, as a combination of two strong physical attackers can overwhelm the opponent. Another Fighting-type is especially good since Gallade can weaken Psychic-types with Night Slash to pave the way for a Hitmonlee or Medicham sweep.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>While Gallade is more commonly known for its offensive prowess, it can also take advantage of its stellar Special Defense and typing to use a specially defensive set that can beat some of the metagame's most threatening special attackers. Specially attacking Sceptile, Rotom-C, Galvantula, Expert Belt Magmortar, and Omastar are only a few of the threats that Gallade checks. Gallade has many unique traits that separate it from the rest of RU's special walls; the most notable of these is access to reliable recovery in the form of Wish. Also, Gallade is resistant to Stealth Rock, making it hard to wear down through double switches unless your opponent has Spikes up. These traits make Gallade perfect for defensive balance or full stall teams.</p> <p>As said before, Wish is a great move that Gallade has access to and helps set it apart from Pokemon like Uxie, which is more physically bulky. Protect ensures that Gallade receives the recovery from Wish, as without it Gallade could just be forced out again and again until it is within 2HKO range from a threatening sweeper. Protect can also be used to scout moves from Choice item users such as Slowking and Switcheroo Manectric. Be careful though, as Protect gives your opponent a free turn to set up, and sometimes it's best to use Will-O-Wisp to deter a physical sweeper that might try to get a free boost off of Protect. Drain Punch is a reliable STAB move that still hits decently hard even without investment thanks to Gallade's high base Attack, and has that cool side effect of regaining a bit of health afterwards. Will-O-Wisp is another great move for Gallade, as it can cripple its common switch-ins easily such as Spiritomb and Escavalier. As mentioned before, it also ensures that Gallade isn't setup fodder for any moderately bulky physical sweeper; Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Fraxure will think twice about setting up as opposed to attacking.</p> <p>Almost maximum HP and Special Defense investment is used to make Gallade as specially bulky as possible, while 16 Speed EVs outrun Adamant Aggron so that Gallade can burn it or just KO with Drain Punch after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. Steadfast is the only ability that Gallade can use with Wish; Justified would be the superior choice if not for its illegality on this set. Thunder Wave and Toxic are alternative status moves that can be used, but even if you are building a team around either of these two statuses, Will-O-Wisp is still better the majority of the time. Stone Edge serves one purpose and one purpose only: to OHKO Moltres as it tries to switch in for free. Drain Punch is better in just about every other situation though, so only use Stone Edge if your team is absurdly weak to Moltres. Zen Headbutt is a middle ground between Drain Punch and Stone Edge; however, it still doesn't KO Moltres even after Stealth Rock and has only a trivial amount of higher Base Power, so only use it if you're extremely worried about Accelgor getting a Special Defense drop or a critical hit, as Zen Headbutt hits that harder too. Drain Punch is a lot better because of its perfect accuracy and healing side effect.</p> <p>Gallade doesn't really require any specific support, but there are some Pokemon that it works better with than others. Regirock is a great partner for this set, as it can take on nearly all of the special attackers that Gallade has trouble with, such as Moltres, Sigilyph, and Substitute + Calm Mind Uxie and Mesprit, and can also check Entei. In return, Gallade can easily pass Wishes to compensate for Regirock's lack of reliable recovery. Qwilfish is another solid partner that can check a good amount of physical attackers that Gallade struggles with such as Entei, Escavalier, and Feraligatr. It also lacks reliable recovery, and can set up Spikes to take advantage of the many switches that Gallade forces due to its sheer special bulk. Similarly, Alomomola checks many of the same things that Qwilfish does and can form a dual Wish core with Gallade that can be very hard to break. Gallade struggles against opposing Psychic-types, especially those that can set up on it with Substitute or a Lum Berry; Spiritomb and Escavalier are two of the best Psychic-type killers in the metagame, and they too appreciate Wish support as they can be worn down quickly due to frequent switch-ins and commonly don't use Leftovers. Spiritomb is a better check to Sigilyph while Escavalier has better synergy with Gallade, resisting Ghost-type moves, and is better against the Dark-types that also typically pose a threat to Gallade such as Spiritomb and Absol. Status is extremely crippling to this set, especially burn, so using a cleric as a teammate is also a good idea. Lanturn beats Moltres and appreciates Wish support, although Misdreavus, Miltank, and Lickilicky are also good choices.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>While Gallade is most commonly seen striking fear into an opponent with a setup move, the simplicity of a Choice Band can also be quite effective. The inability to switch moves or set up is made up for with the immediate power boost Gallade receives from said item. Close Combat is the main STAB move on this set. With a massive 120 Base Power, few things will be safe from Gallade's wrath. The defense drops are somewhat mitigated with the hit-and-run nature of this set. Psycho Cut allows Gallade to lay the hurt on Qwilfish and Amoonguss without much difficulty. Night Slash is very important for being able to deal with Uxie and Slowking and keeping them from trying to cripple Gallade with paralysis or a burn. The last slot reinforces Gallade's coverage on certain threats. Stone Edge is preferred, as it's the strongest move Gallade has to hit Spiritomb with while it also destroys any Moltres that tries to switch in. Leaf Blade provides a safer move to use in order to hammer Alomomola, Rhydon, and Quagsire, but keep in mind that a neutral Close Combat will hit just as hard as a 2x super effective Leaf Blade.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred because Choice Band Gallade is primarily used as a wallbreaker. However, Jolly is feasible in order to outspeed Absol and Smeargle while also tying with other positive-natured base 80s such as Mesprit and Kabutops. There aren't really any other moves to consider on this set as Gallade's Close Combat will often be hitting harder than other super effective coverage moves, such as X-Scissor.</p> <p>Entry hazard support goes a long way to help Gallade break down walls such as Tangrowth and Alomomola. Smeargle, Crustle, and Omastar are solid choices for offensive teams of which this Gallade is usually found on. Partners that can check Spiritomb are a must for this set, as Gallade will be incapable of using either of its STAB moves with freedom if it is around. Pokemon such as Escavalier, Steelix, and Emboar can be used for this. This variant of Gallade is the most vulnerable to status because it lacks any method of healing. For this reason, clerics and designated status absorbers are very helpful. Clefable can absorb status rather easily and is capable of keeping Gallade healthy with Wish. On the other hand, Lanturn provides cleric and paralysis support to help Gallade while also checking Moltres, lessening the pressure on Gallade to predict its switch in with Stone Edge. A Pursuit user, such as Absol and Escavalier, can be used to clear out bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types so Gallade can freely use Close Combat. Due to its fantastic wallbreaking capabilities, Choice Band Gallade pairs very well with fast physical attackers that are capable of cleaning up a team that Gallade has left its mark on. Choice Scarf Braviary and Emboar are solid examples of this, while Swellow and Entei can use their combination of speed and power to finish off the opposing team. If a wallbreaking core is desired, Choice Specs Rotom-C and Typhlosion as well as mixed attacking Samurott work nicely with Gallade.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Gallade's other sets become a major threat after just one turn of set up, this set attempts to use Bulk Up to slowly become a threat while simultaneously becoming more and more difficult to revenge kill. While this might be the hardest set to pull off a sweep with, it is also the hardest offensive set to revenge kill and use walls to deal with thanks to heavy investment in special bulk and boosting its Defense through Bulk Up.</p> <p>Bulk Up is the chosen boosting move for this set, as it boosts Gallade's great Attack stat and subpar Defense as well. Drain Punch fits the goal of this set perfectly; it provides solid power and simultaneously heals Gallade in the process, thus increasing its longevity. The coverage option is a difficult choice, as it will leave Gallade open to certain defensive threats. Night Slash is generally preferred thanks to the neutral coverage it gets with Gallade's Fighting STAB while being able to smash Slowking, Uxie, and Mesprit. Substitute fills in the last slot to shield Gallade from status and to make revenge killing this set that much harder.</p> <p>The EV spread looks odd, but it is actually quite simple. 56 Speed EVs is necessary to outspeed neutral-natured base 55s such as Omastar and Bouffalant, and 240 HP EVs hits an optimal HP number for making Substitutes. The remaining EVs get thrown into Special Defense, and when combined with a Careful nature, Gallade gains far more setup opportunities against special attackers such as Sceptile, Lanturn, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and support Uxie.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is more important for this Gallade set than any other due to the low initial power it has. Ferroseed, Qwilfish, and Rhydon are solid choices for this role, as this Gallade will usually find itself on more balanced teams. Entei and Escavalier are perhaps the biggest issues for this set, as both can still OHKO Gallade at +1 Defense with Flare Blitz and Megahorn, respectively. Alomomola, Qwilfish, and Rhydon can be used to check Entei while Moltres, Emboar, and Typhlosion can keep Escavalier at bay. Spiritomb is still a bit of a pain for this set thanks to the lack in initial power. Emboar, Aggron, and Escavalier can all keep Spiritomb in check. Even with this set's heavy investment in special bulk, Moltres's STAB Hurricane will still run right through Gallade. For this reason, Lanturn is a solid partner to not only keep it in check but to also provide paralysis support so Gallade has to take fewer hits. Other paralysis inducers, such as Ferroseed and Uxie, can also be helpful so Gallade isn't forced to use Substitute as often.</p> "

  "Sandslash": {
    "overview": "<p>When looking for a Rapid Spin user, Sandslash shouldn't be your first choice. This is mostly because Sandslash has many flaws that make it a poor option on most teams. One of these is Sandslash's inability to deal with many of RU's spinblockers, such as Golurk, Rotom, and Misdreavus, while its competitors, Kabutops and Cryogonal, can. In spite of Sandslash's ability to set up Stealth Rock, it is largely outclassed by other Stealth Rock users such as Uxie, Steelix, and Mesprit. Due to Sandslash's miserable Special Defense, it becomes an easy target for even resisted special attacks. Sandslash also loses to many prominent threats, including Sceptile, Slowking, and Lilligant. Its poor Speed does not help its case either; it is often too slow to pull off a Rapid Spin.</p> <p>However, Sandslash does have a few redeeming qualities. It can reliably beat the most popular Ghost-type, Spiritomb, one-on-one. Sandslash can also set up Swords Dance to inflict decent damage on the opposing team. Its physical bulk, while not amazing, is sufficient to allow it to survive enough physical hits to pull off Rapid Spin. In addition to Rapid Spin, Sandslash also has access to Stealth Rock to further support its team. Thanks to these characteristics, Sandslash can also slide onto teams that desperately need to absorb Volt Switch from Pokemon such as Magneton and Manectric. This also makes it a decent fit on teams that do not want their Rapid Spin user vulnerable to Spiritomb. Overall, Sandslash has a very specific niche, and it should only be considered as a last resort if the other Rapid Spin users are too difficult to fit on your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sandslash doesn't have many other options. The most notable one is Sandstorm, which lets Sandslash run a gimmicky set with Sand Rush and Swords Dance to sweep. It can also run Protect to scout the opponent's move and is useful to allow Sandslash to utilize its Leftovers recovery. Sandslash is capable of running a defensive set to take on a few physical attackers more easily while supporting its team with Stealth Rock and Toxic. It also has Sunny Day to support sun teams while providing Rapid Spin support. X-Scissor and Rock Slide are additional options for extra coverage. Finally, Sandslash can also run Knock Off to remove Eviolite from Magneton, Rhydon, Roselia, and Ferroseed. As it stands, Sandslash's utility is already severely limited, and implementing any of these options could diminish any marginal usefulness Sandslash originally possessed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most spinblockers are very capable of stopping Sandslash from pulling off a Rapid Spin, especially if it lacks Night Slash. If it lacks Lum Berry, burning it with Will-O-Wisp is an effective way to stop it from defeating any spinblockers while gradually chipping away at its HP. Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola, Poliwrath, and Slowking can tank hits from it while also dealing a significant amount of damage with Scald. Sandslash loses to common entry hazard setters such as Mesprit, Uxie, Qwilfish, and Roselia, ultimately rendering it useless. Sceptile, Lilligant, and Rotom-C can hit Sandslash super effectively with their Grass-type STAB moves. Jynx and Cryogonal can easily eliminate Sandslash with a powerful Ice Beam. It is also useful to constantly pressure Sandslash with repeated attacks and Spikes, as forcing it out will consistently weaken it. Finally, using Trick with a Choice item can make Sandslash easier to deal with by locking it into Earthquake or Rapid Spin.</p> ",

While Kabutops and Cryogonal are significantly better choices on a vast majority of teams, Sandslash aims to be used sparingly, enduring physical hits while using Rapid Spin when it's necessary. It also serves as an emergency check to physical sweepers at full health, and it doesn't have a Volt Switch or Stealth Rock weakness, unlike Kabutops and Cryogonal.</p> <p>Rapid Spin is the sole reason Sandslash should be used, and as such, it finds itself a spot in this set, allowing Sandslash to remove entry hazards that may cripple its team. Earthquake serves as a powerful and reliable STAB move for Sandslash to hit fairly hard with, especially against Spiritomb. Be wary though, Sandslash can potentially lure in Grass-types, such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and Rotom-C, that will easily score a KO. Stone Edge provides good coverage alongside Earthquake, while Night Slash allows Sandslash to also nail Rotom and Misdreavus. Swords Dance is useful because it allows Sandslash to handle Pokemon such as Spiritomb, Rotom, and Misdreavus more effectively. Stealth Rock is another option for the final moveslot, as it enables Sandslash to provide extra support for its team.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Sandslash enough power to 2HKO standard Spiritomb while 3HKOing defensive variants, both after Stealth Rock, while the Speed EVs allow Sandslash to outspeed minimum Speed Lanturn. A Lum Berry is the preferred item, allowing Sandslash to bypass status conditions from opposing Pokemon once. Leftovers, however, is useful for recovery, although this leaves Sandslash prone to being burned by Ghost-types. An Adamant nature is chosen to further enhance Sandslash's Attack, allowing it to beat Spiritomb. Toxic is a viable option in the last slot to wear down Alomomola and Poliwrath while crippling incoming spinblockers.</p> <p>Aside from Spiritomb, Absol can Pursuit trap opposing Ghost-types; this is quite useful as Sandslash is helpless against the majority of them. Sandslash also needs Wish support to keep it from being worn out; Alomomola and Clefable are both viable options to this end. Sandslash also needs a cleric such as Clefable, Misdreavus, or Roselia if it isn't using a Lum Berry. Roselia can also take Water- and Grass-type moves aimed at Sandslash. Sandslash also appreciates Pokemon that can take on Grass-types as it is typically helpless against them. Emboar, Roselia, Druddigon, and Scolipede are all very good options for this. Pokemon that appreciate Rapid Spin support, such as Moltres and Scyther, are good partners for Sandslash as well. All things considered, supporting Sandslash is probably more trouble than it's worth.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Everything about Golbat just screams defensive Pokemon. It has a great defensive typing, being 4x resistant to the common Grass-, Fighting-, and Bug-type moves in the RU tier, as well as having immunities to both Ground-type moves and Toxic. Eviolite boosts Golbat's already decent defenses to great levels, and when in conjunction with Roost, Golbat becomes nigh impossible to kill. A good Speed stat allows Golbat to outspeed most of the common walls in the tier, Taunting them before they can retaliate. However, Golbat suffers from a crippling weakness to the common Psychic-, Electric-, Ice-, and Rock-type moves, as well as Stealth Rock. However, this won't stop Golbat, as it's still one of the best checks to Fighting-, Grass-, and Bug-types in the tier, and makes for a solid defensive threat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hypnosis is a viable option for Golbat to use, as putting something to sleep can be beneficial. However, Hypnosis's shaky accuracy is off-putting. Confuse Ray is an option if you're feeling lucky, but confusion is unreliable overall. Mean Look can be used to trap something Golbat is supposed to check, as well as preventing poisoned opponents from switching. Screech can help Golbat's teammates take down certain defensive behemoths, such as Rhydon and Steelix, or force switches. Golbat can also make use of its bulk to set up with Nasty Plot. Thanks to its great resistances, Golbat has no trouble setting up, but its Speed lets it down, often leading it to be KOed before it can do anything. However, if Golbat uses Nasty Plot, it can utilize a set consisting of Air Slash, Hidden Power Ground, and Roost alongside Nasty Plot. Infiltrator is also viable with Nasty Plot, as it allows Golbat to bypass Light Screen. Infiltrator can also be used on the main set to bypass Reflect, but it is illegal with Super Fang.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Aggron is the number one counter to Golbat. Aggron resists Brave Bird, doesn't care much about Super Fang or Taunt, and is immune to Toxic, while easily KOing Golbat with STAB Head Smash. While Golbat is supposed to check Fighting-types, Medicham and Gallade can still beat it with their STAB Psychic-type moves. However, Medicham can't do anything to Golbat if it's locked into High Jump Kick. Golbat can take a Bug Buzz from Galvantula with ease, but a STAB Thunder can be incredibly dangerous. Rotom not only resists Brave Bird, but is also immune to Super Fang and can hide behind Substitute to avoid Toxic, all before severely denting Golbat with a STAB Thunderbolt.</p> ",

With its great typing and Eviolite, Golbat will take hits with ease. Brave Bird is Golbat's most powerful move, and is the main course of action against Fighting-, Grass-, and Bug-types. Roost recovers lost health, while removing three of its four weaknesses for one turn. Taunt will shut down most walls, preventing them from setting up, spreading status, or healing themselves. Super Fang is Golbat's best move against Steel-types, such as Ferroseed and Aggron, quickly halving their health. Toxic is another good option to use, as the poison status can make certain Pokemon easier to finish off. However, if you opt to use Toxic, Golbat will be completely walled by Steel-types.</p> <p>Haze can be used to remove the opponent's boosts. Whirlwind also does this, but forces your opponent out in the process. The listed EVs give Golbat ample defenses for taking both physical and special hits. Golbat can easily survive a +6 Petal Dance from Lilligant, while taking next to nothing from Medicham's High Jump Kick. Grass-type Pokemon, such as Lilligant and Sceptile, make for good teammates, as they will greatly benefit from having faster Bug-types, such as Scyther and Accelgor, removed. Normal- and Rock-type Pokemon, such as Bouffalant and Aggron, hate Fighting-types, so they really appreciate Golbat's support. Dark-types, such as Skuntank, will also benefit from the aforementioned Pokemon being removed. Water- and Ground-types, such as Kabutops and Rhydon, also benefit from the removal of faster Grass-types. If Golbat lacks Toxic, Toxic Spikes support really helps. Qwilfish and Scolipede are the best choices to pair with Golbat, as Qwilfish can check Ice- and Rock-types, while Scolipede can take care of those pesky Psychic-types.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>If one could call RBY the Psychic generation, then it's certain that BW is the Fighting generation. While Primeape has to compete with a plethora of other Fighting-types for a team spot, it has the right tools to help it stand out. Not only is Primeape the fastest Fighting-type in RU, it also has the rare Vital Spirit ability. This allows it to switch into the Sleep Powder users that dominate RU, namely Tangrowth and Lilligant, and makes it the best switch-in to Smeargle as well. Furthermore, Primeape has a unique support move in Encore, along with an extremely powerful attack in Close Combat.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there is one major weakness in our anger management case. Primeape has serious issues with Ghost-types as it lacks a reliable coverage move against them, and is terrified of being burned by Will-O-Wisp. This weakness is compounded by Primeape's hatred of any kind of status, as well as its frail defenses. Primeape users should fear not, however, as Primeape has carved itself a niche in RU as a strong and speedy scout.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Even though Primeape has a fairly limited physical movepool, it has all the tools it needs to succeed. Choice Scarf Primeape only needs U-turn, Close Combat, and Stone Edge to excel, and the choice of fourth move is usually trivial. Although Primeape has some interesting support moves, such as Sunny Day and Toxic, a support set is not a good idea due to Primeape's abysmal defenses. The Life Orb set can utilize Screech or Taunt to force switches, but are generally inferior to the moves listed. Overheat can 2HKO Tangrowth, one of RU's premier physical walls. However, mixed Primeape should always either use Life Orb or be backed up by entry hazards in order to secure the KO.</p> <p>A boosting set consisting of Bulk Up, Cross Chop, Stone Edge, and Punishment can be used, but is unlikely to be consistently successful due to the unreliable nature of its attacks. On top of this, Primeape is largely outclassed in this role by Gallade, and to an extent Gurdurr; it should therefore stick to the sets listed. Focus Punch and Cross Chop are alternative STAB moves; the former is useful on sets running Substitute and the latter, though weaker than Close Combat, doesn't lower Primeape's defenses. However, this benefit is usually useless as Primeape is more of a hit-and-run attacker.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although Primeape is relatively strong and fast, it isn't incredible at either. Qwilfish is a hard counter to any Primeape that doesn't run Earthquake and Defiant thanks to Intimidate and its good physical bulk. Bulky Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus and Spiritomb, make short work of Primeape thanks to their excellent bulk and immunity to Close Combat; they can also burn Primeape with Will-O-Wisp and cripple it for the remainder of the match. In fact, any type of status is debilitating to Primeape as it doesn't appreciate drops in Speed, Attack, or longevity. Uxie and Mesprit resist Close Combat, take little damage from U-turn, have Psychic-type STAB attacks, and can paralyze Primeape. Scolipede 4x resists Close Combat and can set up Toxic Spikes and Spikes to stop Primeape from constantly switching in and out of play. Golurk is a good offensive check as it resists or is immune to just about all of Primeape's attacks and takes little from Punishment thanks to its good bulk and Punishment's low Base Power.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its good Speed stat, Choice Scarf, and access to U-turn, Primeape grabs momentum very easily and serves as an excellent scout. U-turn allows Primeape to evade counters while dealing some damage to them. In addition to forcing the aforementioned counters to take damage from entry hazards, it also enables favorable switch-ins for your team. Close Combat is Primeape's best STAB move; it hits extremely hard and demolishes common RU Pokemon, such as Ferroseed, Clefable, and Steelix. Stone Edge hits most other Pokemon that resist Close Combat, such as Moltres, Sigilyph, and Scolipede, for super effective damage. Ice Punch gives Primeape a reliable way to hit Golurk hard. Punishment, however, hits Rotom, Misdreavus, and Golurk for super effective damage.</p> <p>The nature and EVs maximize Primeape's Attack and Speed, which allows it to outspeed several prominent threats, such as Choice Scarf variants of Moltres, Rotom, and Rotom-C, as well as boosted Omastar and Lilligant. Earthquake can be used to hit Drapion and Qwilfish, but it should only ever be used with the Defiant ability, as Qwilfish isn't even 3HKOed by -1 Earthquake. Vital Spirit is the preferred ability most of the time as it grants Primeape more switch-in opportunities against the likes of Lilligant, Tangrowth, and Smeargle, which it desperately needs due to its paper-thin defenses. However, Defiant, when used with Earthquake, enables Primeape to lure in Qwilfish and 2HKO it with +1 Earthquake.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Primeape makes great use of entry hazards thanks to its ability to force switches so effectively; it is essential to partner Primeape with one, if not several, layers of entry hazards. Entry hazards also help Primeape by making its average damage output a non-issue. Mesprit and Uxie can both set up Stealth Rock and resist Psychic-type attacks; Ferroseed sports the same resistance and can set up both Spikes and Stealth Rock while healing Primeape with Leech Seed. It should be noted, however, that Ferroseed cannot run those three moves all on the same set. It is equally important to keep hazards off of your side of the battlefield; although it takes little damage from Stealth Rock, Primeape despises Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Therefore, Rapid Spin users, such as Cryogonal and Kabutops, make for good partners as they can spin away the hazards that infuriate Primeape. Partnering Primeape with other users of Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Rotom-C and Scyther, takes advantage of entry hazards even more effectively and is therefore recommended. Finally, this set loses to most Ghost-types in the RU tier, particularly Misdreavus and Golurk; a Pursuit trapper therefore helps it immensely. Spiritomb makes for an excellent teammate thanks to its considerable bulk, access to Pursuit and Sucker Punch, and lack of weaknesses. In addition to trapping Ghost-types, Drapion can lay down Toxic Spikes to cripple the aforementioned Dusknoir and Golurk.</p> "

Close Combat does great damage to anything that doesn't resist it thanks to the STAB and Life Orb boost. Stone Edge hits the Flying- and Bug-types that resist Primeape's STAB, and also hits Entei and Typhlosion harder than Close Combat does. Encore helps define this set as it is a fairly unique move that slows down the opponent's momentum, and can potentially disrupt their strategy, while U-turn allows Primeape to help its teammates set up. For instance, Primeape can use Encore on a boosting move or ineffective status move, and then U-turn out to a teammate while scoring some damage on the opponent's Pokemon. Ice Punch is a great option, however, to effectively hit Golurk for good damage.</p> <p>Thunder Punch is an option to hit Slowking and Qwilfish for super effective damage, but should only be used in conjunction with the Defiant ability to block and take advantage of Qwilfish's Intimidate. Toxic can also be used in place of U-turn or Punishment to capitalize on the switches Primeape causes, as well as to rack up residual damage on the opponent. Life Orb is the item of choice as it gives Primeape a much-needed power boost and increases its versatility. Alternatively, Leftovers and Substitute can replace Life Orb and U-turn to block status and increase Primeape's longevity. Such a variant should instead run a spread of 8 HP / 248 Atk / 252 Spe to make five Substitutes instead of four.</p> <p>Thanks to its Vital Spirit ability, Primeape can easily switch into common sleep moves in RU, such as Sleep Powder from Tangrowth and Lilligant, as well as Spore from Smeargle. Primeape can then Encore the move and proceed to either hit them hard with Close Combat or U-turn out to an appropriate counter should they switch. This set's advantages over other common Encore users, namely Poliwrath and Raichu, are its STAB Close Combat and better overall coverage.</p> <p>Primeape excels when paired with entry hazards as they literally put your opponent between a rock and a hard place. If the opposing Pokemon stays in, it risks being hit hard by Primeape's attacks; if it switches out, another one of their Pokemon takes entry hazard damage in addition to a powerful attack. Drapion is a great setter of Toxic Spikes, which greatly help Primeape defeat its usual counters, such as Misdreavus, Spiritomb, and Golurk. Stat-boosting Pokemon, such as Nasty Plot Slowking and Swords Dance Sceptile, can take advantage of Primeape's ability to gain free turns with Encore and set up more easily. Spiritomb and Misdreavus will make short work of this set. As Entei is immune to Will-O--Wisp and takes little damage from their STAB attacks, it pairs well with Primeape.</p> "

  "Kadabra": {
    "overview": "<p>Kadabra manages to carve itself a niche in RU thanks to its ability, Magic Guard, which protects it from all indirect damage, including entry hazards. This guarantees that it will live at least one hit if it holds a Focus Sash. Combine this with its excellent Special Attack and above-average Speed and Kadabra has all the makings of a good revenge killer. It can also provide Encore support. However, Sigilyph, Mesprit, and Jynx give it competition for its role as a specially attacking Psychic-type and tend to have an advantage due to their overall superior versatility. Even so, Kadabra's Speed, Special Attack, and ability are enough to set it apart from them.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb is a usable option over Focus Sash, given that Kadabra's ability negates its recoil, but Kadabra prefers the safety net provided by Focus Sash, which allows it to revenge kill faster Pokemon as well. Calm Mind can be used to increase Kadabra's Special Attack to sky-high levels, but Kadabra isn't nearly bulky enough to act as a setup sweeper. Substitute prevents Kadabra from being revenge killed, but just about everything breaks Kadabra's Substitutes due to its horrible bulk and Focus Sash already does the same job. It can be used relatively effectively in conjunction with Life Orb, though. Energy Ball hits Kabutops and Omastar harder, but provides poor coverage otherwise. Dual screens can be used, but Kadabra is still very frail even with screens up and it has better things to be doing with those turns. Signal Beam hits Psychic- and Dark-types hard, but Shadow Ball along with Hidden Power Fire already covers the threats Signal Beam otherwise would, and more importantly, it misses out on Sigilyph. Trick Room can be set up reliably by Kadabra due to Focus Sash, after which it can proceed to let slower Pokemon come in under Trick Room, but it's too fast to utilize it itself. It should be noted, however, that Kadabra isn't the one that is supposed to be utilizing Trick Room, but rather a suicide setter in this case.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Spiritomb is the ultimate counter to Kadabra; it can take anything Kadabra throws at it and can proceed to bring it down to its Focus Sash, from where it can pick it off with a STAB priority move of choice. Notably, it has STAB on Pursuit and Shadow Sneak, so can limit Kadabra's options greatly. Mandibuzz is a great counter as well; it can take all of Kadabra's hits and can hit it hard with Brave Bird or Foul Play. Pokemon that use multi-hit moves, such as Cinccino, Rhydon, and Klinklang, can KO Kadabra through its Focus Sash, with the former outspeeding it and the latter two having enough bulk to take a hit from it. Slowking can take anything Kadabra throws at it with ease and can keep healthy for the entirety of the match with Slack Off and Regenerator. Most priority moves can OHKO Kadabra provided its Focus Sash is broken, most notably ExtremeSpeed from Entei and Shadow Sneak from the previously mentioned Spiritomb. Both offensive and defensive variants of Drapion do well against Kadabra, with the added benefit of being able to Pursuit trap it. Cryogonal can take anything Kadabra throws at it, provided it lacks Psyshock, and can 2HKO it with Ice Beam while regaining any lost health with Recover. Pokemon such as Clefable, Bouffalant, and Druddigon can take one hit and OHKO Kadabra, but cannot do so if its Focus Sash is intact, and the latter must be wary of being locked into Sucker Punch.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Kadabra makes a good revenge killer thanks to its Special Attack, Speed, and excellent ability in Magic Guard. Focus Sash is what makes this set so effective, as it can revenge kill Pokemon even if the opponent is faster, and if it is kept intact, it can do the same thing more than once, or harm the next switch-in with its good coverage. Examples of sweepers that fall prey to Kadabra include Kabutops, Durant, -1 Gallade, and Omastar. Psychic is the preferred option for a STAB move as it hits most threats harder, with particular reference to the physically robust Omastar and Kabutops, but Psyshock can be used to defeat more specially defensive Pokemon such as Cryogonal. For its coverage moves, Shadow Ball lets Kadabra 2HKO many of the tier's Psychic-types, such as Uxie, Mesprit, and Sigilyph, while Hidden Power Fire allows Kadabra to consistently revenge kill Durant and Escavalier. Encore gives a way for Kadabra to lock opposing threats into ineffective moves such as support moves and Sucker Punch, giving a teammate the opportunity to set up.</p> <p>Modest is the primary choice for a nature as the two most common Pokemon that share Kadabra's base Speed are Manectric and Scyther, and due to the need to lower its IVs to use Hidden Power Fire, it gets outsped anyway. However, Timid is a viable option as well as it lets it beat Sigilyph 100% of the time with a combination of Shadow Ball and Encore. Kadabra pairs well with Pokemon such as Durant and Klinklang that can take advantage of Dark-types locked into Sucker Punch by setting up on them. Quiver Dance Lilligant can also utilize Encore support to set up and possibly sweep the opposing team. It also appreciates Kadabra's ability to lure in and get rid of Escavalier with Hidden Power Fire. Emboar makes for a great partner, as it is able to deal with Spiritomb and Absol, two major annoyances for Kadabra. Choice Band and mixed variants can wallbreak for Kadabra while Choice Scarf variants appreciate Kadabra's ability to revenge kill faster threats. Slow Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Lanturn and Eelektross can give it a free switch-in, making them great partners. Finally, Rhydon and Aggron can take out Mandibuzz, a great threat to Kadabra, making them decent partners. The former can set up Stealth Rock for it as well.</p> "

  "Magneton": {
    "overview": "<p>In a tier ridden with many powerful Electric-types such as Rotom-C, Manectric, and Rotom, one might be left wondering how Magneton stands out. The answer lies in its ability, Magnet Pull. With this ability, Magneton is able to trap and KO many dangerous Steel-types such as Escavalier, Durant, and Aggron, depending on the set it runs. A unique Electric / Steel typing also gives Magneton some solid resistances to Dragon-, Electric-, Grass-, and Bug-type moves, among others. However, this is a double-edged sword as Magneton is left weak to the many powerful Fire- and Fighting-type moves in the tier along with a whopping 4x weakness to Ground. Due to its NFE status, Magneton can use Eviolite to bolster its defenses to capitalize on the previously mentioned resistances it has. Choice items are also a possibility thanks to its high Special Attack and access to Volt Switch. Magneton's Speed is okay but certainly nothing amazing, thus leaving it outsped by a myriad of offensive threats, including Durant should Magneton not run a Choice Scarf. While it has solid defenses and great resistances, Magneton is compromised by a low HP stat that can let many of the offensive Steel-types hit it really hard should they predict it switching in. If one can get around its faults, Magneton can be a great addition to many teams, especially those that center around Pokemon that have problems with Steel-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Magneton's movepool is somewhat limited, but there are some options to look at. A specially defensive set with Rest and Sleep Talk can tank multiple hits, but the BW sleep mechanics make this a very inconsistent option. One can use Endure with a Custap Berry to ensure Magneton gets off a minimum of at least two attacks, but this fails to capitalize on Magneton's Steel-trapping capabilities, although it allows Magneton to trap Durant without a Choice Scarf and revenge kill Rock Polish Aggron. Magneton has access to both Reflect and Light Screen, but it is largely outclassed by the faster and bulkier Uxie. Magic Coat is an option, but Magneton is able to threaten most entry hazard users offensively. Magnet Rise can allow Magneton to more safely eliminate Steelix. Metal Sound can force switches, but Magneton usually just wants to spend a free turn by attacking. Rain Dance can be used in conjunction with Thunder, but Magneton will struggle to take out Steel-types, especially Escavalier.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Magneton has no real counters, as its primary job is to eliminate certain Steel-types depending on the set it is running. There are, however, plenty of checks to the steel trapping magnet. Lanturn is a complete stop to Magneton outside of the rare Hidden Power Ground. Gallade and Hitmonlee are perfectly capable of outspeeding Magneton and crushing it with their powerful Fighting-type STAB moves. Hariyama can't outspeed Magneton, but it has the bulk to tank a hit and fire back with its strong STAB Close Combat. Emboar and Entei can tank a hit and retaliate with their strong Fire-type STAB moves. However, they will both fall to an Electric-type STAB move from the Choice Specs set should Stealth Rock be up. Clefable avoids the 2HKO from Choice Specs Thunderbolt, but it can be defeated should it get unlucky with Flash Cannon Special Defense drops. Steelix and Durant are two Steel-types that can actually stand up to Magneton depending on the set being used. Steelix only fears the Choice Specs set, while Durant only has to worry about the Choice Scarf set. Choice Scarf Durant can even use Baton Pass to escape from Magneton.</p> <p>Ground-types such as Rhydon and Golurk can come in for free against Magneton's Electric-type STAB moves, but they must be wary of Flash Cannon. Druddigon is 2HKOed by Choice Specs Flash Cannon, but it can take any other attack and proceed to OHKO Magneton with Earthquake. Quagsire isn't very common, but it is only 3HKOed by Flash Cannon and can OHKO Magneton with a STAB Earthquake. Manectric has Lightning Rod to benefit from Electric-type moves and it resists Flash Cannon as well while typically carrying Overheat or Flamethrower as a coverage move. Rotom resists Magneton's STABs, but it will fail to do much in return outside of Will-O-Wisp and the extremely rare Hidden Power Fire. Magneton's Choice sets are rather frail thanks to its awful base 50 HP. Powerful resisted attacks such as Druddigon's Outrage and Escavalier's Megahorn can actually 2HKO it.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With STAB Volt Switch, the highest Special Attack stat of any Electric-type in RU, and enough Speed to outpace most defensive Pokemon, a Choice Specs set suits Magneton very well, as the extra power lets it get through Aggron and Steelix, two Steel-types Magneton usually struggles with. Thunderbolt is a strong and accurate STAB move that Magneton can use to punch holes in opposing teams. Volt Switch is great for any Choice item user, and Magneton is no different, as it allows Magneton to do serious damage and scout for potential checks and counters. Hidden Power Fire is a necessity to remove Steel-types that Magneton traps, such as Escavalier, Ferroseed, and Steelix. Flash Cannon rounds off the set by hitting Ground- and Dragon-types, such as Rhydon, Druddigon, and Golurk, that typically switch into Magneton's Electric STAB moves.</p> <p>Timid is the primary nature to outspeed the likes of Adamant Kabutops and Adamant Gallade. Modest can be used as Magneton will still outspeed Omastar and Crawdaunt, while the boost in power secures the OHKO on Cryogonal with Flash Cannon and gives Magneton a 56.25% chance to OHKO Choice Band Emboar after Stealth Rock; it also ensures the OHKO on Choice Scarf variants of Emboar. Hidden Power Ground is a noteworthy alternative to hit Magneton and Lanturn much harder while still retaining coverage on Steelix.</p> <p>Any Pokemon that appreciates the removal of bulkier Steel-types such as Escavalier, Steelix, and Ferroseed can be a good teammate. Perhaps the most dangerous is Druddigon, as very few things can stop its rampage after Steel-types are removed. Fraxure is a rarely seen Dragon-type, but it too can greatly benefit from the removal of Steel-types and possibly sweep the opposing team. Flying-types such as Swellow and Braviary are able to sweep more easily with Steel-types removed, while Psychic-types like Mesprit and Uxie appreciate not having to worry about being Pursuit trapped by Escavalier. Speaking of Psychic-types, Slowking is a solid defensive partner as it can switch into most of the threats that force Magneton out. Hidden Power Rock variants of Lilligant can also be quite dangerous once Magneton is able to remove opposing Steel-types. VoltTurn teams welcome Magneton's ability to remove Steel-types and maintain momentum. Rotom-C, Cinccino, and Braviary are all teammates that appreciate the removal of Steel-types and can maintain the momentum Magneton gains.</p> "

The boost provided by Eviolite allows Magneton better handle more offensive Steel-types, such as Escavalier and Aggron. Thunderbolt is still the primary STAB move as it is strong and reliable. Volt Switch allows Magneton to scout for checks and counters. Hidden Power Fire deals with Steel-types that Magneton traps, easily taking out the likes of Escavalier and Ferroseed. Flash Cannon is a secondary STAB move to handle the Ground- and Dragon-types that take Magneton's Electric STAB moves easily. Substitute and Charge Beam can replace Volt Switch and Flash Cannon respectively to set up on Steel-types that Magneton traps, but Ferroseed is the only one that won't break its Substitutes on average, and the only other attacks Magneton can safely set up a Substitute against is Iron Head from the likes of Escavalier and Aggron.</p> <p>The EV spread lets Magneton avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Escavalier's Megahorn while also outspeeding maximum Speed Adamant Aggron. A Timid nature with a fully offensive spread can be used to outspeed Adamant Kabutops and Adamant Gallade. Discharge has a nifty 30% paralysis chance that can help slower powerhouses such as Druddigon and bulkier Gallade variants, among others.</p> <p>This Magneton has problems with Steelix and Durant, so teammates that are able to take care of them are helpful. Slowking fears very little from Steelix and can use its STAB Water-type moves to take it down. Emboar and Moltres have a 4x Bug resistance and a Steel resistance to handle Durant's STAB moves, and both can roast the ant with their Fire-type STAB moves. This variant of Magneton handles bulkier Steel-types such as Escavalier better than its other sets, so teammates that can take advantage of such Steel-types not being around are good choices. Druddigon and Fraxure have a much easier time using their powerful Dragon-type STAB moves with Steel-types out of the way, while Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Slowking appreciate not having to worry about Escavalier. Hidden Power Rock variants of Sceptile and Lilligant can switch into Ground-type moves, and lure in Fire-types that Magneton struggles with, such as Moltres and Entei, and take them out with Hidden Power Rock. VoltTurn teams appreciate this Magneton's ability to switch into most Steel-types and remove them from battle, so Pokemon such as Cinccino, Rotom-C, and Mesprit can make for solid teammates.</p> "

With the boost in Speed, Magneton is able to outspeed the likes of Durant, Sceptile, and Choice Scarf Emboar. Thunderbolt is Magneton's most reliable STAB option with great power and perfect accuracy. Volt Switch provides utility and allows Magneton to scout for checks and counters. Hidden Power Fire wipes out Durant and does significant damage to Sceptile, hence hitting two Pokemon that Magneton is normally incapable of outspeeding. Flash Cannon rounds off the set by hitting the likes of Rhydon and Druddigon harder than any other move Magneton has.</p> <p>Timid is absolutely necessary to keep Magneton in front of Durant, Sceptile, and Choice Scarf versions of Emboar. Due to the lack of power when compared to other sets, it is generally not advised to use another Hidden Power type as Magneton needs Hidden Power Fire to OHKO Durant and deal as much damage to Sceptile as possible. This Magneton is perhaps the best failsafe option for teams that struggle against Durant, so Pokemon that appreciate not having to worry about the steel ant are good choices. Sturdy Psychic-types such as Uxie and Slowking can switch into many of the Pokemon that can force Magneton out while benefiting from the absence of Durant. This Magneton has significant issues with Steelix, so teammates that can handle it are appreciated. Slowking fears little from Steelix, while Moltres only fears Roar forcing it off of the field and can uses its powerful STAB moves to open up holes in an opposing team for Magneton to clean up later in the match. VoltTurn teams can benefit from Magneton's ability to outspeed and eliminate Durant and Sceptile from the match. Braviary, Mesprit, and Cinccino are all decent options for VoltTurn teams looking to take advantage of Choice Scarf Magneton's qualities.</p> "

  "Muk": {
    "overview": "<p>Muk: THE tank. With high natural bulk, usable offensive and defensive typing, good Attack, and low Speed, Muk is the pure definition of a tank in the RU metagame. While it's outclassed as an offensive tank on balanced and offensive teams, Muk does have a niche on full stall teams by combining a bunch of various roles into one Pokemon. Muk's unique traits allow it to perform as a Trick and Toxic Spikes absorber, Toxic spreader, Rotom-C counter, and Durant, Escavalier, and Qwilfish lure all in one Pokemon. Muk is a formidable specially defensive tank, but its Defense leaves a lot to be desired and it's easy enough to take out due to its lack of reliable recovery. In most situations, Qwilfish is a better Poison-type for defensive teams thanks to Intimidate and its access to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Thunder Wave, but if the roles described before are needed in one teamslot, Muk is your Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Muk's movepool is huge and thus has a ton of other options and sets it can utilize in RU, though none that really offer a whole lot over most other RU Pokemon. Brick Break, Hidden Power Water, or Hidden Power Ground could be used on the specially defensive set as they're Muk's best weapons versus Aggron, Steelix, and Rhydon. However, they're generally not worth the moveslot unless your team can secure Toxic Spikes on the opponent's side of the field, thus freeing up Muk's last moveslot in place of Toxic. An offensive set with full Attack investment and an Adamant nature with Poison Touch + Poison Jab can be incredibly frustrating for the opponent, as the poison chance is very high. On more balanced teams, this spread of poison and consistent damage can provide the openings needed to secure a late-game sweep by something like Dragon Dance Fraxure or Swords Dance Feraligatr.</p> <p>More classic offensive Muk sets include a Choice Band set featuring Gunk Shot and a SubPunch set. Both offer a lot of power backed by Muk's good defenses, though Muk is just so slow and the metagame so hostile to it that it'll usually end up being dead weight. There are also just more reliable wallbreakers available in Pokemon like Medicham, Gallade, and Druddigon, so it's rarely worth giving up a teamslot for Muk in place of them. Other more obscure choices include Curse, Memento, Taunt, and Torment, but Muk's typing is just not suited for creating a set around any of those moves, as it'll usually just be KOed before they can be effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steelix and Aggron just laugh at anything Muk can throw at them apart from the odd Hidden Power Ground or Water on the main set. Choice Band Brick Break can hurt Aggron, but that's pretty rare. Other Steel-types are immune to Poison Jab and Toxic, but switching into Fire Punch can mean trouble, particularly for Escavalier and Durant. Earthquake is the easiest general way to eliminate Muk from the scene, and there are plenty of users of it in RU including Rhydon, Crustle, Druddigon, Aerodactyl, Archeops, and Drapion, the last of which even being immune to Toxic. All of these Pokemon are also good general answers to more offensive Muk sets.</p> <p>Clefable and Sigilyph are annihilated by Gunk Shot, but both make great counters to the main specially defensive set, as Poison Jab and Thunderbolt simply don't do enough, and they're immune to Toxic to boot. Psychic-types such as Uxie, Gallade, Mesprit, and Medicham generally have an easy time with Muk, particularly if they aim for its lower Defense stat and avoid Toxic (though Uxie with Heal Bell doesn't even have to care about that either). Muk is most effective if the opponent doesn't have recovery, so sending in something with recovery will generally force Muk out, especially if it can't poison it. Muk's lack of recovery outside of Black Sludge means most of the damage inflicted on it is permanent, and its weakness to entry hazards means it'll get worn out quickly over time. However, be aware that Muk is generally paired with Wish users, so oftentimes it'll mean not allowing them to get a Wish pass off to Muk in order to defeat it.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>This set should only be used on full stall teams, as Muk will lose too much momentum for the team otherwise, and it doesn't hit quite hard enough or fulfill a role useful enough on balanced and offensive teams to warrant a teamslot. Muk's foremost role on the team is as a Grass-type counter, particularly against Rotom-C, which can otherwise give stall teams some trouble, and the moveset helps accomplish this. Poison Jab has good neutral coverage in RU, the poison chance is nice, and it absolutely demolishes Rotom-C and lands a good hit on other Grass-types as well. However, it should only be used if the Pokemon you predict to switch in isn't more harmed by Toxic. Fire Punch puts the hurt on Amoonguss and Roselia, but it's more useful for luring in and KOing Durant, Escavalier, and Ferroseed, which are all very dangerous Pokemon to give a free turn to. Thunderbolt's main role is to 2HKO Qwilfish after Stealth Rock damage, and it gets a decent hit on Moltres and other Flying-types. The last slot will usually go to Toxic, which deters a lot of the Pokemon that will generally be switching into Muk such as Slowking, Mesprit, Rhydon, Quagsire, and Gallade. However, Haze is usually a requirement on stall teams, and if you're not using Cryogonal or another Pokemon for the role, then Muk fits the bill well. Unfortunately, most of the Pokemon that Haze is most useful against can threaten Muk with their STAB moves or OHKO it if it switches in against the likes of SubCM Uxie, Mesprit, Sigilyph, Gallade, and Kabutops.</p> <p>Sticky Hold is needed so that Muk can absorb Trick from the most common users of it in the tier, particularly Rotom, Rotom-C, and Manectric. Poison Touch might be tempting to use, but Muk usually can't risk normal poisoning something it'd rather Toxic poison such as Tangrowth and Slowking. A fully specially defensive EV spread takes advantage of Muk's typing and stat spread the best, and even with Defense investment, Muk will still usually be 2HKOed by most physical attackers. Don't bother trying to beef up Muk's Attack either because it needs all the special defense it can get, and investing in Muk's offense is only efficient if it becomes an all-out attacker.</p> <p>Gunk Shot can be used for a gigantic increase in power and offensive presence, which can also force more enemy switches and rack up entry hazard damage. However, the accuracy will more often than not bite Muk in the slime and force it to switch instead; granted, this isn't as punishing as it is for the opponent, since full stall teams should usually be able to get off a Rapid Spin and have Wish support. Thunder Punch can be used over Thunderbolt if Qwilfish isn't a concern for your team, as it does a bit more to Sigilyph, Moltres, and Kabutops, usually forcing the former two into using Roost, which will open up a free switch for you. Sleep Talk can be used as well if you want Muk to be a complete Grass-type counter, but Muk is a lackluster sleep absorber, as it doesn't pose much of a threat while asleep.</p> <p>As Muk should only be used on full stall teams, its teammates should follow suit as such. A spinner is needed, since while Muk absorbs Toxic Spikes, it's still susceptible to Stealth Rock and Spikes, meaning Cryogonal makes a good partner, and it can also provide Haze support. Because Muk has no recovery, it appreciates Wish support immensely. Two really good users in Clefable and Alomomola are available, and both have good defensive synergy with Muk.</p> <p>Steelix and Aggron have a free switch into Muk, so teammates are needed for them. A Steelix of your own or Poliwrath are good choices; Qwilfish also does alright in this role despite its frailty and can provide Spikes or Toxic Spikes once it's in. Magneton works here as well, particularly Choice Specs Magneton, as it can trap Steel-types and obliterate most of them with its STABs and Hidden Power Fire. Sigilyph laughs hysterically at Muk, so a counter to it is needed too. Spiritomb fits best on stall teams, and it can beat most variants of Sigilyph; Haze Cryogonal also works OK here as well. Most other threats that will generally be switching into Muk are maimed by Toxic or its coverage, so simply providing good defensive switches is all that's really needed to wear down the opponent over time and secure the win for Muk's team. Pokemon like Clefable, Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Steelix, Alomomola, Slowking, and Uxie are all classic RU stall Pokemon that cover a huge variety of offensive threats within the metagame.</p> "

It also has really nice defensive typing and ability, granting Haunter three immunities and some nice resistances, allowing switch-in opportunities in spite of its frailty. You should try to avoid switching Haunter into resisted hits, however, as even resisted hits do quite a bit of damage to it. As such, Haunter is not the greatest spinblocker, because switching in on the wrong move spells the end for it. However, Haunter is a very useful Pokemon, capable of either disrupting the opponents strategy or sweeping the opponents team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Giga Drain is a coverage move that allows Haunter to hit specific Pokemon such as Rhydon harder while regaining health, but is weak, even failing to OHKO standard Rhydon after Stealth Rock. Hypnosis seems like a cool support move on Haunter, but its low accuracy and Haunter's frailty make this a bad choice. Clear Smog and Haze are interesting options for Haunter, but once again, Haunter does not have the bulk to pull it off. A set that utilizes Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers could be used, but Rotom and Spiritomb outclass Haunter when it comes to using defensive sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Spiritomb is probably the best counter to Haunter in the tier, as it has super effective STAB priority in Shadow Sneak and can also Pursuit trap Haunter. Mandibuzz is a good answer to any Haunter that lacks Thunderbolt, as it can Roost off all damage and Whirlwind Haunter away even if it is behind a Substitute. Its STAB Foul Play also puts a large dent in Haunter in spite of Haunter's poor Attack. Specially bulky Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Roselia, and Cryogonal don't really care about Haunter's attacks and can either KO it or set up on it. Drapion also laughs at its attacks and can set up Toxic Spikes in front of Hanter or just go for the kill with Crunch. Steel-types such as Aggron and Magneton don't mind any of Haunter's attacks barring Hidden Power Ground and are good responses to Haunter that lack it. Clefable has no trouble with Haunter if it has something to hit Haunter with, as Clefable can't be 2HKOed and can recover its health with Soft-Boiled or Wish + Protect. There are also quite a few Pokemon that can take any hit an KO back, such as Druddigon, Entei, and Hitmonlee, but they are all taken down by a well-timed Destiny Bond, or SubDisable combo in Hitmonlee's case. Finally, anything faster or with a decently strong priority move can revenge kill Haunter.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Due to Haunter's non-existent defenses and good Speed, it is the perfect candidate for a Life Orb set. Immunity to Fighting-, Normal-, and Ground-type moves grant Haunter quite a few switch-in opportunities, and once Haunter manages to switch in safely, it is capable of taking out many of the top threats in the tier. Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb are decently strong STAB moves, capable of doing heavy damage to RU staples such as Uxie, Slowking, and Tangrowth. The third slot is a choice between OHKOing Escavalier and hitting Aggron, Drapion, and Magneton. Hidden Power Ground also retains 31 Speed EVs, which is useful as it allows you to Speed tie with max Speed positive-natured Uxie, Drapion, and Electivire, even though they are somewhat rare. Generally it is more useful to run Hidden Power Fire, however, as hitting Escavalier before it Pursuit traps you is more useful than hitting Drapion. The last move depends on what you want Haunter to do for your team. Substitute allows Haunter to function better on its own, as Haunter tends to force switches. Substitute also allows Haunter to avoid Sucker Punches from the likes of Absol and revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Medicham. Destiny Bond aims to lure in a check after Haunter has killed something and take it down as it kills Haunter. This is a good option if you have Pokemon such as Uxie and Jynx on your team that have similar checks to Haunter, as this allows them to sweep late-game.</p> <p>A Timid nature is preferred, as you'll want Haunter to take as few hits as possible; it also gives it the jump on SubSplit Rotom, which would otherwise KO Haunter with Shadow Ball. It also allows Haunter to outspeed Moltres and OHKO it after Stealth Rock with Sludge Bomb. Life Orb lets Haunter hit hard while also taking advantage of its good coverage. Thunderbolt can be used over one of the other attacking moves, as it allows Haunter to hit many of the Water- and Flying-types in the tier harder. Pain Split could be used in the last slot alongside Substitute, allowing Haunter to regain health while weakening an opposing wall. Taunt is also a choice in the last slot, preventing special walls such as Roselia from setting up on it. Fire-types such as Entei and Choice Scarf Emboar are good teammates for Haunter, as they are capable of taking on most of the Pursuit trappers in the tier, as well as the Steel-type Pokemon that give Haunter trouble. Choice Scarf Emboar in particular is a good teammate, as it can take on many of the Pokemon that are faster than Haunter. Aggron is another good teammate, as it draws in Ground- and Fighting-type attacks for Haunter to switch into, while threatening Cinccino and Spiritomb.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Due to Haunter's extremely useful typing, it can run a successful SubDisable set, as many Pokemon only have one move to hit Haunter with. This allows Haunter to check a lot Pokemon in the tier while maintaining heavy offensive pressure. Disable is also a nice response to the many slower Choice-locked Pokemon in the tier, such as Choice Band Escavalier, Choice Specs Slowking, and Choice Band Druddigon. Once something has been Disabled and Haunter sets up a Substitute, it can be really difficult for your opponent to respond to Haunter. Shadow Ball is a strong STAB move with decent coverage. The last slot is a choice between hitting the Normal-types such as Bouffalant that Haunter walls or hitting Escavalier and Ferroseed hard. Sludge Bomb also has a nice 30% chance to poison, which can wear down things that otherwise may have beaten Haunter.</p> <p>Black Sludge is the item of choice, as it allows you to set up more Substitutes and also cripples Pokemon looking to use Trick on Haunter. Hidden Power Ground is an option in the last slot to hit Aggron and Drapion harder, but Drapion isn't that great in RU and Aggron tends to be Choice locked, so it loses to this set anyways. Because Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb have a minimal effect Steel-types, Haunter appreciates Magneton support, as it can trap and eliminate any opposing Steel-type giving Haunter trouble. Aggron is also an excellent teammate for this set, as it has no problem taking on the Pokemon that Haunter struggles with, such as Spiritomb and Drapion. Haunter also really appreciates entry hazard support, as Toxic Spikes wear down the opponent as Haunter just sets up Substitutes. Drapion is a decent choice for setting up Toxic Spikes, as it has pretty nice synergy with Haunter; Qwilfish is another good option that can set up Toxic Spikes for Haunter, as it can switch into many of the Pokemon that threaten Haunter and set them up. Spikes and Stealth Rock are also nice, as Haunter tends to force a lot of switches, meaning that Crustle and Qwilfish are good teammates. Kabutops and Cryogonal are also good teammates, as Haunter allows certain entry hazard setters like Roselia to set up Spikes in front of it and they can spin them away.</p> "

Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb are strong STAB moves that allow Haunter to do decent damage to most of the tier. Sludge Bomb differentiates Haunter from Rotom, as it allows Haunter to revenge kill Lilligant after a Quiver Dance with a little prior damage. Destiny Bond is another move that Haunter has over Rotom, giving it the ability to revenge kill things that it usually can't, such as Durant, at the cost of its own life. The last move is a choice between hitting Aggron and Magneton hard and crippling special walls such as Clefable looking to switch in on Haunter.</p> <p>A Timid nature is chosen to allow Haunter to revenge kill as many threats as possible, especially Choice Scarf Rotom and +1 Lilligant. Hidden Power Fire is another option in the last slot, that allows Haunter to surprise opposing Durant or Escavalier. Magneton is a good partner for Haunter, as it can trap Steel-types, giving Haunter a shot at cleaning late-game. Psychic-types such as Jynx and Uxie appreciate Haunter sacrificing itself with Destiny Bond to take out one of their counters, as they tend to share counters with Haunter. Pokemon such as Mesprit and Lanturn that have access to a slower U-turn or Volt Switch can help get Haunter into the battle more easily. Lanturn also tends to draw in Earthquakes, which is nice for getting Haunter into the match for free. Haunter hates Pursuit users, so it is important to have a teammate that can beat them. Aggron is a good choice as it destroys most Pursuit users and draws in Fighting- and Ground-type attacks for Aggron.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>When people think of cavemen, the trademark weapon that comes to mind is the club. This powerful weapon was taken to a whole new level in the realm of Pokemon, where it can turn an average Pokemon with an average base 80 Attack stat into a monster with 568 Attack; the beast it creates is so powerful that it makes even Deoxys-A tremble in its wake. Yes, a small creature with a fossil on its head is transformed into a destructive force that is capable of shattering the very world as we know it; its name is Marowak. When equipped with a Thick Club, Marowak can deal massive damage. Its Defense isn't shabby either, maxing out at 350. But sadly for this demon from the past, its other stats are terrible, with the exception of its average Special Defense stat. However, this monster should not be underestimated; under Trick Room, it can truly thrive. Its pitiful Speed can be turned into an advantage under the twisted dimensions, thus making Marowak an exceptional candidate for a Trick Room team. It also has access to the EdgeQuake combination, gaining STAB on Earthquake thanks to its Ground typing. All in all, with Thick Club equipped, Marowak can be force to be reckoned with in the RU environment, even with its decidedly average stats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Marowak has a small amount of other options that are not listed in the sets above. Bonemerang is an option over Earthquake in order to break the enemy's Substitutes, but some of the most common users of Substitute, Uxie and Rotom, are immune to Ground-type moves, so Earthquake is generally the better option. Marowak also has access to Stealth Rock, but this is better left to other Pokemon, as Marowak's goal in life is to destroy the opposition through brute force, not to support its team. Belly Drum is also an option, raising Marowak's already stellar Attack stat to unthinkable levels, but it halves Marowak's HP, and since Marowak has no reliable way of recovering HP, it is not as effective as Swords Dance. Marowak also has access to a variety of special moves, including Fire Blast, Ice Beam, and Earth Power. Sadly, its pathetic base 50 Special Attack stat makes the concept of using special moves much less attractive.</p> <p>Marowak gets Battle Armor from the Dream World, which prevents Marowak from being hit by critical hits. This ability is relatively useless, however, compared to Rock Head, as Double-Edge is an essential part of Marowak's moveset. This ability is better left to walls anyway, not to mention Marowak already gets destroyed by common attacks such as Surf and Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Tangrowth is the biggest counter to Marowak, being able to switch in and wall it relatively easily, thus stalling valuable turns of Trick Room. Slow variants of Slowking are also major problems, being able to outpace Marowak in Trick Room and knock it out with either Surf or Scald. Also, Marowak's pathetic base 45 Speed stat and Ground typing allow it to be easily revenge killed outside of Trick Room.

That's right, Trick Room! With Trick Room up, Marowak is very hard to stop. It becomes the bane of hyper offense teams everywhere, capable of OHKOing all of the common Pokemon found on them. It's excellent base 110 Defense stat means that even priority from the likes of Entei and Absol won't be enough to take it down. Earthquake is the main STAB of choice and it can dent almost anything that isn't resistant or immune to it. Double-Edge works very well thanks to Rock Head and, thanks to its high Base Power, is a good move to use when there are still Pokemon immune to Earthquake. Fire Punch lets Marowak annihilate the likes of Ferroseed and Rotom-C, making them wish that they had never chosen to come face to face with this monster. The last slot is mostly a filler, so Stone Edge is the preferred move in order to add to Marowak's good coverage. Swords Dance is also an option, however, as it boosts Marowak's frightening Attack stat even further, enabling it to destroy anything that comes in its path.</p> <p>252 Attack EVs allow Marowak to hit as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are placed into HP to give it some bulk. Rock Head negates the recoil that Double-Edge causes. As for move options, Knock Off and Toxic are potential candidates to replace Stone Edge, as they can cripple common switch-ins, such as Alomomola and Quagsire. Any Pokemon with Trick Room is a great partner for Marowak. Slowking and Uxie deserve special mentions, however, as both are able to set up Trick Room and cripple Marowak's biggest counter: Tangrowth. Slowking can outright KO it with with Fire Blast. Uxie, on the other hand, can cripple it with Trick and set up dual screens, or use Memento in order to let Marowak set up more easily if it is running Swords Dance.</p> "

The combination of Earthquake and Double-Edge provide excellent coverage, destroying most of the RU tier thanks to Marowak's phenomenal Attack stat when holding a Thick Club. Fire Punch rounds off the set by adding to the coverage provided by the combination of Earthquake and Double-Edge, allowing Marowak to wreak havoc on opposing Grass-types, especially Ferroseed.

  "Rhydon": {
    "overview": "<p>Rhydon is a prime example of a Pokemon that is a great risk to use, but those who do will surely reap the rewards. Its physical bulk is unmatched in RU, as Eviolite boosts its stellar Defense stat to ridiculous levels in combination with Rhydon's naturally high base HP. To illustrate Rhydon's incredible defensive capabilities, with maximum investment and Eviolite, Rhydon can survive Choice Band Medicham's High Jump Kick! Add to this Rhydon's wonderful base 130 Attack stat, and you have a Stealth Rock-laying tank that can take powerful hits and dish out equally powerful ones back. Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. Rhydon's downright awful Speed holds it back from sweeping without resorting to Rock Polish or paralysis support. In addition, when functioning as a tank, Rhydon is often passed over for Steelix, who has better defensive typing as well as Roar to rack up hazard damage for stall teams. However, Rhydon has a niche of countering Entei that lack Hidden Power Grass while filling a similar role to Steelix.</p> <p>Another aspect of Rhydon that is quite debatable is its typing. On the offensive side, STAB EdgeQuake is nothing to laugh at, especially when Rhydon also has Megahorn to hit Grass-types and break down the popular Regenerator core of Tangrowth and Slowking. However, Rhydon's typing leaves it with many common weaknesses on the defensive side, such as Water-, Grass-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks. Furthermore, Rhydon is prone to being killed by most special attackers, as most carry a move that can hit Rhydon hard enough to KO it. Therefore, Rhydon often finds itself in a kill-or-be-killed situation; while few things can actually switch into every move in Rhydon's arsenal, three-fourths of the tier can outspeed and KO Rhydon before it has a chance to do anything in the first place. As mentioned before, using Rhydon is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that can ultimately pay off if used properly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rhydon has a wide movepool, although most of these options are inferior to other Pokemon or just aren't good enough to warrant their own set. First on the list is a SubPunch set, which can utilize Stone Edge and Megahorn for coverage. Earthquake isn't used because Stone Edge and Focus Punch are both as powerful as it, and in general it offers redundant coverage. An Adamant nature along with an EV spread of 72 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Def / 84 Spe should be used to not only maximize power, but also to outrun Tangrowth, hit a Leftovers number, and avoid the OHKO from defensive Qwilfish after one layer of Spikes. This set isn't very good because it doesn't beat any threats that one of Rhydon's other sets doesn't, and Earthquake is a much better attacking option than Focus Punch. As such, you're better off not using this set. However, it can set up on Pokemon that can't do anything to Rhydon, such as Mandibuzz, and possibly take out other members of your opponent's team after that as well.</p> <p>Here we draw the line from \"decent if used well\" to \"there is absolutely no reason to use this.\" Counter is one of the most prediction reliant moves in the game, and only has value on Rhydon for its ability to take almost every physical attack in the tier. However, most players will attempt to bring Rhydon down with special attacks, so the uses of Counter are few. Rhydon can also set up Sunny Day and Rain Dance with Stealth Rock to complement its weather, but Rhydon doesn't offer any key resistances and Uxie does this much better. Rhydon has a very large special movepool to possibly take advantage of as well, but nothing hurts coming off of Rhydon's base 40 Special Attack. Its Nidoking-like coverage gives it a would-be powerful STAB in Earth Power, while getting another pair of moves other than its STAB combination that provide some of the best two-move coverage in the game in Thunderbolt and Ice Beam. Rhydon also has Fire Blast to hit Steel-types, especially those such as Ferroseed and Steelix. If Rhydon had more Special Attack, not even Normal-type special walls such as Clefable would be able to stop it with its access to Focus Blast.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Rhydon's incredible power and coverage leave most defensive Pokemon unable to touch it, there are a few exceptions to this. Ridiculously bulky Pokemon, such as Poliwrath, Tangrowth, and Alomomola can take even Rhydon's most powerful hits in some cases and deal damage back. Poliwrath is the best Rhydon counter in existence, as it only fears the 2HKO from a Choice Band Earthquake, and can outspeed and OHKO with Scald. Eviolite Rhydon isn't OHKOed by Scald, but can't 2HKO Poliwrath in return. Tangrowth is a close second, as only the Choice Band set is guaranteed to beat it. Without an item boosting its power, Rhydon can't get a guaranteed 2HKO Tangrowth with Megahorn, and although offensive variants are 2HKOed, they outspeed and OHKO Rhydon with Leaf Storm. Alomomola can take any hit from Rhydon with ease thanks to her incredible physical bulk and either prey on Rhydon's 4x weakness to Water with Scald or Waterfall or whittle Rhydon down over time with Toxic, which is especially effective as Rhydon lacks any form of reliable recovery. Ironically, Rhydon is also checked by itself, and only a very rare Aqua Tail can catch it off-guard. Usually, whichever Rhydon with more Speed wins.</p> <p>As not much else can take Rhydon's attacks, you'll usually have to resort to revenge killing it. Obviously the most difficult set to revenge kill is the Rock Polish set, but there are a few Pokemon capable of it. Aqua Jet users such as Kabutops and Feraligatr can each deal approximately 80% to Rhydon if it lacks an Eviolite, which makes Rhydon very prone to entry hazards or Life Orb damage after that. Various Choice Scarf users with over base 70 Speed have no trouble with revenge killing Rhydon, and most are fairly common as well. Your best bet is to hit Rhydon on the special side, and Pokemon such as Rotom-C, Manectric, Typhlosion, and Galvantula can all outspeed +2 Rhydon with a Choice Scarf and OHKO with either Leaf Storm, Hidden Power Grass, or Giga Drain. Physical Choice Scarf users give Rhydon trouble as well, mainly Primeape and Medicham. Both Close Combat and High Jump Kick are typically too much for Rhydon to handle. Accelgor doesn't even need a Choice Scarf to outspeed Rhydon at +2, and can OHKO with Giga Drain or Focus Blast. Although they are faster than +2 Rhydon and carry super effective moves, both Choice Scarf Rotom and Choice Scarf Drapion can't OHKO Rhydon and will promptly be destroyed by Stone Edge or Earthquake, respectively.</p> <p>Non-Rock Polish variants of Rhydon are a lot easier to kill. Rhydon is hilariously slow, and most Grass- or Water-type special attacks will put an end to the beast. While the Choice Band set uses enough Speed to outrun Roselia and Lanturn, tank sets are prone to being killed by Giga Drain and Scald, respectively. Lilligant and Sceptile can switch in on Earthquake, and both OHKO with Giga Drain. However, they must watch out for either Megahorn or Stone Edge, as both do enough damage to make switching in difficult, or even to outright OHKO them. Moltres comes in for free on Earthquake, and can end Rhydon with a simple Hidden Power Grass. However, it is crippled tremendously by the Stealth Rock that Rhydon sets up, and fears Stone Edge or Rock Blast greatly. Omastar is a good check to Rhydon as defensive variants aren't OHKOed by any of Rhydon's moves, and can outspeed tank Rhydon and OHKO it with Scald. Choice Band and Rock Polish sets outspeed and 2HKO, however. Offensive Omastar can't switch in, but it outspeeds all variants of Rhydon and can Hydro Pump for the kill. Similar to offensive Omastar, Crawdaunt outspeeds all Rhydon sets and OHKOes with Adaptability Waterfall. Other Waterfall users, such as Feraligatr and Kabutops, outspeed and are guaranteed to OHKO most Rhydon variants as long as they use a Life Orb.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<p>Rhydon is most often seen using its combination of incredible bulk and power in a tanking role. It has a niche as being a physical tank that can set up Stealth Rock, with its ability to switch into most Entei separating it from Steelix. Stealth Rock is a must for every team in a tier filled with behemoths such as Moltres, Scyther, and Entei, and Rhydon is a fine choice to set it up if you require its talents. Rhydon appreciates the reliable STAB of Earthquake in its arsenal, and it is especially important when facing Taunt + Swords Dance Drapion because Rhydon hard counters it. When considering Rhydon's Rock-type STAB move, there are two viable choices. Rock Blast is the preferred choice to break through Focus Sash users such as Aerodactyl, Accelgor, and Scolipede, as well as Crustle. As such, Rhydon makes a fine lead when using Rock Blast as it can set up Stealth Rock on turn one while also being able to dispose of other hazard leads. However, another option that should be considered is Stone Edge. While Stone Edge is strangely more reliable, Rock Blast has a good chance to hit at least as hard as the former while also reaping the benefits of being a multi-hit move. Megahorn is a great move for Rhydon that enables it to hit bulky Grass- and Psychic-types, such as Tangrowth and Uxie, that would otherwise be able to tank its hits and retaliate. It is also essential for breaking down the Regenerator core of Slowking and Tangrowth which plagues most teams.</p> <p>Another option that can go in place of Stealth Rock is Substitute. While Stealth Rock is the recommended choice in nearly all aspects, Rhydon has a free moveslot when Stealth Rock is covered by another member of your team. The only thing holding Rhydon back from destroying most teams is its abysmal Speed, which leaves it forced out by many threats, so Substitute attempts to remedy this by creating a buffer that Rhydon can safely hide behind while it dispatches the opposing Pokemon with the appropriate move. However, when using Substitute, Eviolite becomes a liability and Rhydon will be worn down immensely due to entry hazard damage and Substitute. Leftovers is the primary item choice when using Substitute, as is an alternate EV spread of 72 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Def / 84 Spe. Not only does this mitigate the health lost from creating Substitutes, it also allows Rhydon to create five Substitutes when at full health, as well as survive uninvested Qwilfish's Waterfall after one layer of Spikes. However, Eviolite can still be used with Substitute to increase special bulk tremendously and stand a better chance of countering Drapion.</p> <p>When creating EV spreads for Rhydon, especially bulkier ones, they tend to be complicated due to Eviolite and the imbalance of Rhydon's stat spread. This set is no exception. Maximum investment along with an Adamant nature allows Rhydon to hit as hard as possible, maximizing its effectiveness as an offensively-oriented tank. 84 Speed EVs are required to outspeed minimum Speed Tangrowth and hit it with Megahorn, although 124 Speed EVs aren't that big of a step up and can be used to outspeed minimum Speed Omastar. The HP and Special Defense EVs are used to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Rotom's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock, making Rhydon an effective counter to sets that lack Will-O-Wisp by breaking their Substitutes with Rock Blast. It is worth noting that should you choose to use enough Speed to beat minimum Speed Omastar, Rhydon will no longer be able to avoid being 2HKOed by Life Orb Rotom if Stealth Rock is in play. Eviolite is really the only item choice that you should ever consider if not using Substitute due to Rhydon's low Speed and NFE status. Keep in mind that a fully-evolved Pokemon using a similar set would only consider Leftovers, and Eviolite is much better than Leftovers for Rhydon in almost every way. The choice of ability is negligible when using this set; don't even bother changing it on the teambuilder. All three of Rhydon's abilities are completely useless and it doesn't matter which one you decide to use. That being said, don't use Reckless because its illegality with Stealth Rock isn't worth losing over Reckless's, uh, cool name I guess.</p> <p>While the options listed take advantage of Rhydon's offensive potential, a more defensive set can be used effectively thanks to Rhydon's great defensive prowess. An EV spread of 252 HP / 16 Def / 240 SpD and an Impish nature should be used to take on foes such as Choice Scarf Primeape, defensive Qwilfish, and Choice Band Bouffalant. With this spread, Rhydon can avoid the 2HKO from all of these Pokemon. There are moves in Rhydon's movepool that don't find use on offensive sets but are instead useful on defensive sets, such as Toxic and Roar. These moves should replace Megahorn and Rhydon's Rock-type STAB move, as they are the less reliable, and won't do as much damage without investment, than Earthquake. Another role that Rhydon can play while filling a more defensive role is to utilize RestTalk to become a mono-attacking phazer. This has its pros and cons, as while Rhydon is so immensely bulky on the physical side that it can avoid the 2HKO from even STAB super effective attacks, it is also forced out by so many specially based Pokemon and can be quickly worn down by entry hazards in this manner. A spread with much heavier physical bias isn't recommended because Rhydon is extremely hard to kill with basically any physical attack in the first place, and extra investment would leave it even more prone to hits on its weaker Special Defense.</p> <p>If Stealth Rock is already covered by another teammate and Substitute doesn't float your boat, then Swords Dance is an interesting option to boost Rhydon's Attack to extremely threatening levels and destroy stall with its awesome STABs and Megahorn. To give an example of Rhydon's power at +2, Earthquake stands a good chance of OHKOing standard 252/96+ Steelix after it has taken Stealth Rock damage! However, with the listed spread, Rhydon will be outsped and OHKOed by stall stalwarts such as Lanturn, Roselia, and Omastar. This more offensive Rhydon should use a speedier spread--namely 36 HP / 252 Atk / 220 Spe--to outspeed uninvested Lanturn and Roselia as it can OHKO the former two very hard. Another good choice over Substitute is Double-Edge, as it is very useful for finishing off weakened Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake without risking the accuracy of Stone Edge or Rock Blast. If using Double-Edge, then the ability choice becomes important, as either Rock Head or Reckless can be used to make better use of Double-Edge.</p> <p>Due to its easily exploitable weaknesses, Rhydon needs a lot of team support to function to the best of its ability. Paralysis support is required when using Rhydon as it is slower than most of the metagame and needs to be able to outspeed most special attackers. Luckily for Rhydon, there are several special walls that are happy to provide paralysis support for it. Slowking is a wonderful special pivot that can take on Fighting-, Water-, and Ice-type attackers while also spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave. Rhydon appreciates Spikes to complement its own Stealth Rock, and Pokemon such as Roselia and Ferroseed can offer both Spikes and paralysis support, which makes them ideal partners. On the opposite side of the field, Toxic Spikes are the bane of Rhydon's existence and shorten its longevity greatly. Therefore, when using Rhydon, you should be sure to pack a spinner, a Toxic Spikes absorber, or both. Qwilfish is a good partner that can set up Spikes while also absorbing Toxic Spikes as it switches in, and can soften blows even further with Intimidate. When considering a spinner to aid Rhydon, look no further than Cryogonal. Cryogonal can take on many of the specially-based Water- and Grass-type foes that eat Rhydon for breakfast, and Rhydon takes on powerful physical attackers that Cryogonal easily falls to, such as Aggron and Entei. Last but not least, Clefable is probably one of the best partners for Rhydon defensively as it can not only pass Wishes to compensate for Rhydon's complete lack of healing, but it can also act as a cleric with Heal Bell and take on most special attackers.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Although Rhydon often capitalizes on its bulk to attack, a more offensive set is also effective. When holding a Choice Band, Rhydon can pulverize anything not named Poliwrath with its incredible power. Due to the loss of bulk that comes from the loss of Eviolite and a reduced defensive investment, Rhydon must be treated as more of a wallbreaker than something that can take hits. Its resistances still allow it to take attacks such as Flare Blitz and Head Smash with ease, but the loss of bulk is noticeable when tanking the likes of Earthquake and Close Combat. In fact, Rhydon is best brought in on double switches to Pokemon who can't hurt it, such as Slowking, Lanturn, and Mandibuzz, before firing off one of its incredibly powerful moves. This set functions as an excellent Tangrowth lure, as Rhydon will always win if Tangrowth decides to switch in on it. Defensive versions of Tangrowth are outsped and always 2HKOed by Megahorn, while offensive variants are OHKOed by that same Megahorn. As such, this set finds a home on balanced and offensive teams, particularly bulky offense. Rhydon is unique in that it is a powerful Choice Band user that can switch into many of its competitors, while Entei and Aggron can't say the same.</p> <p>Many users of either Choice Band or Choice Specs have their so-called \"spam attack,\" their most powerful move that can destroy most of the metagame; your opponent will typically switch in a Pokemon that resists this move as there is a large chance that you will use it. Rhydon is no exception to this. Earthquake is powerful, reliable, and it gets the job done, so it is the move that Rhydon should be using most of the time. Stone Edge completes Rhydon's wonderful STAB combination, and is used to hit Flying- and Bug-type foes as well as Levitate users, as Moltres, Accelgor, and Rotom will all look to come in for free and they are all disposed of by Stone Edge. Complementing Rhydon's wonderful STAB coverage is Megahorn, which hits Psychic- and Grass-types, such as Uxie and Torterra, right where it hurts. Double-Edge is the primary option in the last slot as Rhydon doesn't need additional coverage, and Double-Edge is useful for hitting Pokemon that don't take much damage from Earthquake, such as Flying- and Bug-types in addition to Levitate users, without risking Stone Edge's accuracy. However, Rock Blast can go in that spot as well; although Rhydon shouldn't set up Stealth Rock with a Choice Band, it still makes a fine anti-lead that can destroy common leads such as Aerodactyl, Scolipede, Accelgor, and Crustle, while limiting them to only one layer of hazards.</p> <p>This EV spread is a lot less complicated than most of Rhydon's sets. As always, maximum investment in Attack in conjunction with an Adamant nature allows Rhydon to hit as hard as possible. 220 Speed EVs enable it to outrun defensive versions of Lanturn and Roselia as they usually won't run any Speed themselves. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to slightly increase bulk both physically and specially, whatever difference that may make. However, you can also use a slightly bulkier spread of 32 HP / 252 Atk / 100 Def / 124 Spe to increase Rhydon's longevity. Specifically, the Speed is dropped to outspeed uninvested Omastar, while the HP and Defense EVs allow Rhydon to survive defensive Qwilfish's Waterfall after one layer of Spikes. In this case though, you're usually better off sticking to the listed spread as Lanturn and Roselia are threats too important to pass up on. Rock Head is the preferred ability as it allows Rhydon to use Double-Edge without receiving the recoil from it. This is a great asset for Rhydon, but feel free to use Reckless as well, as there aren't any illegality issues with the slashed moves, and a Reckless-boosted Double-Edge is almost as powerful as Rhydon's STAB moves! Of course, if you're using Rock Blast or some other move, the choice of ability really doesn't matter.</p> <p>If you have no use for Double-Edge or Rock Blast, Rhydon has many coverage moves at its disposal that can be used to hit specific threats harder than the listed moves. However, all of these moves are situational at best, as they usually only turn 2HKOs into OHKOs against certain Pokemon. First and foremost on the list is Aqua Tail, which is useful for doing more damage to opposing Rhydon as well as the odd Air Balloon Aggron. Fire Punch hits Ferroseed harder, but Rhydon already outspeeds and 2HKOes Ferroseed. Crunch is an option if you want Rhydon to have a more consistent option to hit Misdreavus with, but do note that a super effective Crunch is only slightly more powerful than a neutral Earthquake or Stone Edge, making it a lesser option in most cases. Lastly, Rhydon has a couple of powerful Fighting-type attacks that it can use to hit Normal-type walls such as Clefable and Miltank harder than Earthquake or Stone Edge. Superpower is the better option most of the time, but Focus Punch is a move for those feeling ballsy and who can predict well. Focus Punch's main draw is that it is as powerful as both Earthquake and Stone Edge, even factoring in STAB! All in all, as the last moveslot is truly filler, Stealth Rock can even be used to fill your team's needs. However, note that all of the moves mentioned in this paragraph bar Crunch are illegal with Reckless, although you shouldn't be considering it anyway if you're not using Double-Edge.</p> <p>As with any Rhydon set, paralysis support is crucial when trying to do damage to your opponent's team. Both Ferroseed and Roselia can offer paralysis support, as well as crucial resistances to Grass- and Water-type attacks. They can also lay down Spikes to aid in Rhydon's attempt to break down your opponent's defensive core. Slowking offers resistances to Ice-, Fighting-, and Water-type attacks and also offers paralysis support. Likewise, Sigilyph can paralyze foes while being able to cover Rhydon's weaknesses to Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type attacks. Rhydon, just like any other offensive Pokemon, enjoys entry hazards support to break through its checks. When considering Pokemon to set up hazards, Rhydon prefers offensive partners that can aid it in its path of destruction. As such, powerful suicide hazard leads that also have an offensive presence such as Smeargle, Scolipede, and Accelgor are all great partners for Rhydon. As said before, this set is a fine Tangrowth lure, so Pokemon that can take advantage of its absence, such as the aforementioned Aerodactyl, as well as Feraligatr, Rotom-C, and Golurk, are all great partners that can benefit a lot from having Rhydon on their team.</p> "

        "name": "Rock Polish",
        "description": "<p>While Rhydon's other sets focus on being bulky and powerful at the same time while sacrificing the need for Speed, this set aims to singlehandedly fix Rhydon's poor Speed with one move: Rock Polish. After only one Rock Polish, Rhydon outspeeds Sceptile as well as Choice Scarf base 70 Speed Pokemon, such as Magneton. To make sure that Rhydon can sweep, a few things must occur. Firstly, defensive walls that can counter this set such as Steelix, Poliwrath, and Tangrowth must be removed from play entirely as they will jeopardize the success of this set. Secondly, Aqua Jet users such as Feraligatr and Kabutops, as well as common Choice Scarf users over base 70 Speed, such as Rotom-C, Manectric, Primeape, and Medicham, must be nowhere to be found. The idea of this set is to wear down its counters over time with hazards and offensive pressure, then use Rock Polish for the final attempt at a sweep. As such, this set prefers to be on offensive teams that can take advantage of its powerful coverage and ability to take a hit while softening each other's checks so that one Pokemon can sweep with the help of its teammates.</p> <p>The rest of the move choices are fairly obvious and take advantage of Rhydon's unique assets. Earthquake is Rhydon's most reliable STAB move, and should be used more than anything else, especially when there is no need to predict. Next, \"the worst move in the game\" finds major use on this set, completing Rhydon's STAB EdgeQuake combination, and hitting the Flying- and Bug-types as well as Levitate users that like to come in on a predicted Earthquake. It is less of a risk to take than other users of the move as, even if you predict incorrectly, it will still have the same Base Power as Earthquake. Rounding out the set is Megahorn, which is essential for hitting the Grass-types that resist Earthquake, as well as bulky Psychic-types such as Slowking. It is worth noting that a Life Orb-boosted Megahorn will always OHKO Slowking after Stealth Rock, and it is a 2HKO on Tangrowth after Stealth Rock as well.</p> <p>The recommended EV spread places maximum emphasis on Attack, and uses enough Speed to outrun Sceptile as well as Choice Scarf Magneton after a Rock Polish. The leftover EVs are placed in HP to slightly increase bulk. A Jolly nature is mainly used to outspeed Sceptile, but if you aren't too worried about that, then an Adamant nature can be used instead for more power. If using Adamant, an EV spread of 8 HP / 252 Atk / 248 Spe should be used to outspeed Scolipede. The main benefit of using Adamant is the ability to 2HKO all variants of Tangrowth without Stealth Rock, in addition to added power against every other foe that Rhydon faces. Life Orb is the item of choice for this set as it provides a sizable boost to all of Rhydon's moves while allowing it to switch between them. Eviolite can be used, but the drop in power is too great to make up for added bulk while setting up. Swords Dance is an interesting option over Megahorn to form a double dance set, and is usable thanks to Rhydon's amazing STAB combination and incredible power. However, it's generally not advised because of Rhydon's frequent lack of opportunities to set up, due to its multitude of common weaknesses as well as its pathetic Speed. In addition, the coverage provided by Megahorn is too good to pass up most of the time in a tier where Psychic and Grass are two prominent defensive types.</p> <p>As with any offensive Pokemon, Rhydon appreciates entry hazards to do its job better. Specifically, Stealth Rock alone enables Jolly Rhydon to 2HKO Tangrowth with Megahorn all of the time. Good partners that can set up hazards include Scolipede, Roselia, and Ferroseed, as they all either provide crucial resistances or added offensive pressure. Also, this set appreciates a cleric as it tends to get hit with status. Both Clefable and Lanturn are excellent choices, with the former taking a slight edge thanks to its access to Wish. Although Megahorn has a good chance to 2HKO Tangrowth, it can simply switch out again and take Rhydon on again due to Regenerator. As such, Magmortar is a fantastic partner that can switch into Tangrowth with impunity and OHKO with Fire Blast. Rhydon fulfills its side of the bargain by taking out Slowking with Megahorn. Bulky Ghost-types, such as Misdreavus, Dusknoir, and Spiritomb, can take Rhydon's attacks and burn it with Will-O-Wisp. As such, a Pursuit user is helpful to tame these beasts, and Spiritomb is the superior choice thanks to its immunity to Fighting-type attacks. Another thing that Rhydon asks of its teammates is the ability to remove Toxic Spikes from the field of play. Qwilfish and Drapion are both excellent choices as the former can set up Spikes for Rhydon to take advantage of, and the latter can provide the aforementioned Pursuit support.</p> "

  "Kangaskhan": {
    "overview": "<p>As a Normal-type, saying that Kangaskhan faces competition for use is an understatement. In a tier with access to many Normal-types to choose from, Kangaskhan hardly seems to stand out. However, upon further inspection, there are many useful attributes Kangaskhan possesses that allows it to distinguish itself from its competition. Kangaskhan's extensive movepool grants it a variety of useful offensive tools, including Fake Out, Sucker Punch, and more, allowing it to threaten fast and slow Pokemon alike. Scrappy is also a major selling point for Kangaskhan, granting it perfect two-move coverage and preventing Ghost-types from adequately checking it. However, Kangaskhan is by no means a one-man army. Its only slightly above average Attack and Speed make it both unable to break through common bulkier Pokemon without prior damage and incapable of taking on faster offensive teams without resorting to its shakier priority attacks. While it certainly isn't any kind of powerhouse like Moltres or Druddigon, Kangaskhan is a very well-rounded offensive Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Being a Normal-type, Kangaskhan has a variety of other options available to it. A Choice Band set can be used to push through certain defensive Pokemon like Poliwrath and Tangrowth better, though it turns some of Kangaskhan's most noteworthy moves, namely Fake Out and Sucker Punch, into liabilities. A Choice Scarf set can be used to decent effect considering Kangaskhan's decent Speed tier and Attack, though it belittles its nice priority moves and doesn't deal all too much damage without any particular item backing its Attack stat. Thunder Punch and Ice Punch both offer Kangaskhan respectable super effective coverage, though barring a couple exceptions, the targets of these attacks are hit slightly harder by STAB Return. Aqua Tail offers good neutral coverage alongside Kangaskhan's Normal STAB, in particular putting a big dent in Rhydon. Kangaskhan can use Disable to play around Choice users, though its lack of useful immunities or resistances severely impedes this. Kangaskhan has access to some decent defensive options such as Wish, Roar, and Circle Throw, along with good bulk, though it faces competition from Lickilicky, who can run essentially the same set with better overall bulk. Work Up can be used to boost Kangaskhan's Attack stat, though with Kangaskhan every moveslot counts, and Kangaskan lacks the Speed to reliably sweep.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Steel- and Rock-types such as Steelix, Escavalier, and Rhydon are Kangaskhan's preliminary counters, taking very little from its attacks and being able to wear it down with their attacks. Durant in particular can switch into, set up on, and break through Kangaskhan, while Kangaskhan's priority attacks are unable to dent it, making Durant one of the few fast sweepers that Kangaskhan can't realistically check. However, Durant's lack of recovery makes it vulnerable to being worn down by entry hazard damage. Generally, physically bulky Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Tangrowth, and Uxie can all check Kangaskhan moderately well, though they cannot do so repeatedly. Fast Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Primeape can outpace Kangaskhan, resist Sucker Punch, and can OHKO it with their STAB attacks. Due to Kangaskhan's lack of resistances and vulnerability to entry hazard damage, it is very easily worn down from repeated switch-ins.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Kangaskhan's well-rounded stats and movepool allow it to effectively take on the role of a bulky attacker. Thanks to its Scrappy ability, Kangaskhan can much more safely capitalize on the neutral coverage of its STAB moves than its Normal-type brethren. Thus, Kangaskhan's Double-Edge is significantly more difficult to switch into, 2HKOing defensive pivots such as Slowking and Amoonguss while also OHKOing frail offensive Pokemon like Sceptile. While Double-Edge's extra oomph does help compensate for Kangaskhan's average Attack stat, the recoil can be rather off-putting, which makes Return a respectable alternative. Drain Punch provides perfect neutral coverage alongside Kangaskhan's STAB attack of choice, allowing it to hit Rock- and Steel-types for reasonable damage while also allowing Kangaskhan to recover some HP. However, considering the natural physical bulk of Rock- and Steel-types, Earthquake is also a very viable option, with its extra damage output allowing Kangaskhan to wear down Pokemon like Rhydon and Steelix better.</p> <p>With Kangaskhan's bases covered with its first two moves, it can focus its attention on versatility. Fake Out allows Kangaskhan to deal what is essentially \"free damage,\" allowing it to hit any Pokemon lacking Inner Focus or Steadfast without immediate consequence. This extra damage not only aides Kangaskhan in checking a variety of frailer sweepers, but also allows it to beat Smeargle safely, breaking its Focus Sash with Fake Out and outpacing and finishing it off with another attack. However, this luxury must be played carefully, as simply clicking Fake Out every time Kangaskhan switches in can easily be exploited. Sucker Punch offers Kangaskhan a priority move of use after its first turn on the field, and forms an effective 1-2 punch alongside Fake Out, allowing it to take down a variety of frailer Pokemon, including but not necessarily limited to Galvantula, Sceptile, and Accelgor.</p> <p>While the extra power of an Adamant nature is often preferred, especially considering half of Kangaskhan's attacks are already priority-based and thus do not often require Speed, Jolly should never be overlooked, as the ability to Speed tie dangerous Pokemon such as Moltres and Lilligant and outpacing Entei is incredibly valuable for any Pokemon. A Jolly nature also ensures Kangaskhan can outspeed unboosted Gallade and Kabutops, both of which also remain very threatening Pokemon. While the generalized power of Life Orb is helpful and does help in picking off offensive Pokemon with less prior damage, Silk Scarf is often the superior choice, as it better complements Kangaskhan's natural bulk and helps in preventing it from being worn down by entry hazard damage and weaker attacks as easily. This is especially true when Kangaskhan is running Double-Edge, as the accumulative recoil puts Kangaskhan on an uncomfortably short timer, even with the recovery Drain Punch provides. Crush Claw can be used, as its high chance of Defense drops allows it to force bulkier Pokemon out with the prospect of taking unnecessarily hefty hits, though it often means losing out on Fake Out, a major draw to Kangaskhan. Fire Punch offers Kangaskhan an attack capable of dispatching Escavalier and Durant cleanly, though using it means either dropping its other coverage option, and in turn losing its ability to hit Rock-types, or Fake Out.</p> <p>Fire-type Pokemon like Entei, Moltres, and Emboar make excellent partners for Kangaskhan, not only taking on Steel-types and Tangrowth comfortably, but also switching into Will-O-Wisps that would otherwise cripple Kangaskhan. Spikes support helps Kangaskhan wear down bulky Rock- and Steel-types that give it problems, as well as dedicated physical walls such Poliwrath and Tangrowth. Smeargle is useful partner for setting up early-game hazards, and Qwilfish is a useful fallback for fast Fighting-types that can also provide Thunder Wave support to help alleviate Kangaskhan's average Speed stat. Thanks to Kangaskhan's ability to comfortably take on Ghost-types, it makes it one of the better Pokemon for Normal-type stacking, with partners such as Tauros, Zangoose, and Sawsbuck all benefiting from its ability to wear down their preliminary checks and counters so that they can sweep late-game. Choice Scarf Rotom-C offers a solid switch-in to Tangrowth and bulky Water- and Rock-types that give Kangaskhan troubles and a partner capable of safely revenge killing most Steel-type setup sweepers that Kangaskhan has difficulty facing. Strong Fighting-types, such as Gallade and Hitmonlee, appreciate Kangaskhan's ability to combat Ghost-types and wear down physical walls, aiding their ability to sweep, while in turn they are capable of pressuring bulky Rock- and Steel-types that check Kangaskhan.</p> "

Kangaskhan's sizable 105 / 80 / 80 defenses allow it to take hits surprisingly well, and in turn making its Substitutes very resilient, allowing it to play around Seismic Toss users with ease. Focus Punch allows Kangaskhan to punch holes in the Rock- and Steel-types that it lures in, even having a high chance of 2HKOing Rhydon after Stealth Rock damage. Return allows Kangaskhan perfect neutral coverage alongside Focus Punch with the aide of Scrappy, as well as providing a move with neutral priority for hitting slower Pokemon safely. Sucker Punch is the icing on the cake, allowing Kangaskhan to pick off faster Pokemon, with Substitute preventing the opponent from playing around it.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Kangaskhan to produce five consecutive 101 HP Substitutes with enough Speed to outpace Jolly Crawdaunt, allowing it to KO it with Return before it can respond. A faster spread of 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe can be used to get the jump on base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Gallade and Kabutops, though it comes with a noticeable drop in bulk that hurts its ability to switch in repeatedly.</p> <p>In terms of support, Misdreavus is a solid partner for taking on Fighting-types, spreading burns to indirectly make Kangaskhan's Substitutes more resilient to physical attacks, and providing Heal Bell support to prevent Kangaskhan from being crippled by status. Considering Kangaskhan is adept in luring in and wearing down Normal-type resists, other strong Normal-types such as Cinccino and Zangoose are excellent partners for Kangaskhan for sweeping late-game. Strong Fighting-types, such as Gallade and Hitmonlee, appreciate Kangaskhan's ability to combat Ghost-types and wear down physical walls to clean up late-game, while also wearing down Rock- and Steel-types.</p> "

  "Scyther": {
    "overview": "<p>Even though Scyther boasts the same Base Stat Total as its evolution, Scizor, a simple retype has set the two eons apart. While Scizor has been consistently vying for top spot in OU, Scyther is forced to dwell in its shadows. This leaves Scyther relegated to the RU metagame, where it can function as a good sweeper with Swords Dance to set up or Baton Pass its boosts to a teammate, thanks to its solid 105 Speed and 110 Attack in tandem with Technician boosted Aerial Ace and Bug Bite, allowing it to take down a fair number of threats in RU. Additionally, it can function as a scout with its access to U-turn in order to maintain momentum. However, Scyther possesses a severe weakness to Stealth Rock, mandating that it be used in tandem with a Rapid Spin user. Furthermore, it also faces competition from Scolipede and Durant, both of which are faster than Scyther, possess better type combinations, and have stronger offensive movepools. While Scyther is still a solidly viable Pokemon, you need to be sure it is exactly what you are looking for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Scyther has access to Reversal, which can hit tremendously hard with the help of a Focus Sash and a Swords Dance boost; Fighting-type moves also provide excellent coverage alongside Scyther's Flying-type STAB. Scyther can also take advantage of its Stealth Rock weakness by running an odd-numbered HP stat; by switching in twice with Stealth Rock up, Scyther attains a maximum power Reversal. Because this would make Scyther incredibly prone to revenge killing, Substitute can be used to scout for potential revenge killers. Scyther also has access to Agility, which it can utilize in one of two ways: either as a replacement for Swords Dance on the Bulky Swords Dance set, or along with Swords Dance or Substitute on a designated Baton Pass set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As far as counters go, Moltres is without a doubt Scyther's worst nightmare. It resists Scyther's Bug-type STAB, has enough bulk to take an Aerial Ace, and can turn Scyther into a fried mantis. To make matters worse, Moltres can Roost off any damage accumulated from the altercation and continue its onslaught. Bulky Ghost-types such as Misdreavus laugh at Scyther's attacks and send it packing with Will-O-Wisp. Steelix can impose its will on most sets, as it can set up Stealth Rock and phaze. However, Steelix is potentially 2HKOed by a +2 Life Orb boosted Brick Break.</p> <p>The best way to deal with Scyther is without a doubt Stealth Rock. It severely limits Scyther's ability to set up and can prevent the Choice set from functioning entirely. With Stealth Rock up, Scyther can be forced into a corner; if it stays in, it will fall to a check or revenge killer, while if it switches out, it will loses half its health the next time it switches in. Hence, eliminating the opposing Rapid Spinner is crucial for dealing with Scyther. Additionally, Scyther loathes status of all kinds, and if it gets tagged by a status move as it tries to set up, it will be severely limited. Scyther's relatively low bulk and horrendous defensive typing can be exploited; although Scyther is fast, it is no Accelgor. Many Choice Scarf users and natural speed demons, such as Manectric and Galvantula, can outspeed and revenge kill Scyther, but must be wary of a boosted Quick Attack.</p> ",

After one boost, Scyther's Attack stat reaches a frightening 638, enough to slice through all but the bulkiest of walls. Its movepool, while shallow, is tailor-made for this set, as Technician turns the normally weak Aerial Ace and Bug Bite into deadly STABs. In a tier bereft of Steel-types, Bug and Flying are both extremely potent offensive types. Brick Break rounds off this set, allowing Scyther to hit Pokemon that resist its STAB combination, namely Steelix and Aggron.</p> <p>The EV spread is standard, taking advantage of Scyther's excellent Speed and Attack. A Jolly nature is an absolute necessity, as it allows Scyther to outspeed the base 95 Speed tier, and proceed to raze the likes of Uxie and Primeape with its boosted STAB moves. Life Orb gets the best mileage out of any setup sweeper, and Scyther is no exception. However, because of its crippling Stealth Rock weakness, Scyther often gets only one chance to set up and sweep. Lum Berry is therefore a viable alternative; it not only prevents Scyther from being shut down by a rogue Thunder Wave or Toxic, but also ensures that Scyther is not a ticking time bomb.</p> <p>Although Scyther can comfortably outspeed most of RU, there are still troublesome Pokemon, such as Galvantula, who can outspeed and cause headaches. Many Choice Scarf users can also exploit Scyther's sub-par bulk. Therefore, Quick Attack is a viable option to make Scyther less prone to revenge killers. Bolstered by Technician and a Swords Dance boost, Quick Attack drastically diminishes the number of Pokemon who can reliably revenge kill Scyther. Unfortunately, should Scyther choose to run Quick Attack, it sacrifices a great deal of coverage, and Uxie and Steelix can comfortably wall Scyther should it lack the appropriate move.</p> <p>As mentioned before, Scyther suffers from a crippling Stealth Rock weakness. Rapid Spin support is therefore a must, with Cryogonal, Hitmonchan, and Kabutops being the best options in RU. Sandslash also provides Stealth Rock support, which allows Scyther to nab a number of OHKOs and 2HKOs it wouldn't otherwise get. Moltres and Charizard absolutely have their way with Scyther, making Slowking an ideal teammate. Scyther returns the favor by taking out powerful Bug- and Dark-types, such as Crawdaunt and Accelgor, who would otherwise be absolute nightmares for Slowking.</p> "

U-turn builds momentum, and can bail Scyther out of unfavorable matchups. Scyther's ninja-esque Speed gives it an advantage over Scizor in some instances, as Scyther can force opponents into a no-win situation: either stay in and die, or switch out and lose momentum. Technician-boosted Aerial Ace is a great complementary STAB for hitting Fighting-types, whereas Technician-boosted Bug Bite hits harder than U-turn and is more reliable when going for a late game sweep. Quick Attack is an excellent option over Bug Bite if running Choice Band, as it allows Scyther to pick off frail but potentially dangerous sweepers. Brick Break is the coverage move of choice, as it allows Scyther to hit Steel types, such as Steelix and Aggron, that resist its dual STAB combination.</p> <p>The choice between a Band and a Scarf (pun not intended) depends on what you want Scyther to accomplish; the former packs significantly more power and dents opposing walls, potentially opening up a sweep for a teammate, whereas the latter allows Scyther to troll faster Pokemon such as Galvantula, Sceptile, and Accelgor, while simultaneously fulfilling the role of revenge killer. While Choice Scarf variants are more reliable for a late game sweep and more difficult to revenge kill, Choice Band variants grab significantly more KOs and can attempt a sweep much earlier.</p> <p>Technician-boosted Pursuit gives Scyther the ever so handy U-turn + Pursuit combination, made famous by none other than the crimson mantis itself. With so many RU teams reliant on Uxie and Tangrowth to wall threats, Scyther can throw a wrench into the opponent's plans by playing mind games with this dangerous combination of attacks. Quick Attack is a viable move on the Choice Scarf set--just kidding, anyone who tries this should feel ashamed.</p> <p>Obviously, U-turn spamming will not work if Scyther is losing 50% of its health every time it switches in. As a result, Rapid Spin support is an absolute necessity; Cryogonal, Kabutops, and Hitmonchan are some of the most reliable spinners in RU. Furthermore, because Rapid Spin is so crucial for this set to function properly, it is important to eliminate all potential spinblockers. Scyther itself is not the bug for the job, since most bulky Ghost-types will stay in as it Pursuits and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. It is therefore advisable to run a Dark-type, such as Absol or Drapion, to eliminate bulky Ghost-types, and ensure you don't run into problems when attempting to pull off a spin.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Black and White brought Scyther a very useful gift in the form of Eviolite, which allows Scyther to perform the role of a bulky Swords Dance sweeper. While this set lacks the sheer power and immediate sweeping potential of the standard Swords Dance set, it does alleviate Scyther's below average bulk and enables it to accumulate multiple boosts. As always, Aerial Ace provides a powerful, reliable STAB, and allows Scyther to dispose of troublesome phazers such as Hariyama. Roost maintains Scyther's survivability, and potentially allows it to stall out weaker Electric- and Ice-type attacks; an added bonus is the ability to Roost off Stealth Rock damage should your Rapid Spinner go down early. Your choice for the final moveslot depends on what role you want Scyther to fill. If all you're looking for is a bulky sweeper, Brick Break provides the best possible coverage alongside Aerial Ace. However, Scyther is capable of passing Attack boosts via Baton Pass. Speed is maximized to ensure a Speed tie with opposing Scyther, and 248 HP EVs ensure Scyther can switch into Stealth Rock at least twice without fainting.</p> <p>Bug Bite can be used as an alternative STAB if running Baton Pass. As a stand-alone STAB move, Bug Bite is more useful on some occasions. However, if using Brick Break, Aerial Ace is the preferred STAB move due to the superior coverage of Fighting- and Flying-type moves. Scyther also has the option of running Safeguard to protect itself against status. Unfortunately, this is very situational, as it only allows Scyther to bypass bulky Ghost-types attempting to Will-O-Wisp, and sacrifices coverage as well as Baton Pass.</p> <p>As with any Scyther set, Rapid Spin support is an absolute must. Hitmonlee in particular has great synergy with this set; not only can Hitmonlee guarantee a spin with Foresight, it can also dispatch Steelix with High Jump Kick, making Scyther's life that much easier. Hitmonlee is also a great recipient for Swords Dance passes. Bulky Ghost-types such as Rotom and Misdreavus are huge nuisances to the duo, however, so a strong Dark-type, such as Spiritomb or Drapion, makes a great partner. This set absolutely loathes status of all kinds, so a reliable status absorber such as Clefable or a cleric such as Heal Bell Uxie would work well too.</p> "

  "Jynx": {
    "overview": "<p>A remnant of the rebellious late 90's fashion trends, Jynx's competitive merits are by no means as grotesque as her aesthetics. Sporting an excellent base 115 Special Attack, coupled with a superb base 95 Speed, Jynx is one of the most potent special attackers in RU. Dream World bestowed Jynx with one amazing ability, Dry Skin. With Dry Skin, Jynx can set up on bulky Water-types such as Lanturn and Alomomola. Moreover, Jynx's signature move Lovely Kiss allows her to incapacitate almost any opponent, then taking advantage of the situation to set up a Substitute or acquire a Nasty Plot boost.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the bane of Jynx's existence is her frailty, horrendous defensive typing, and her Stealth Rock weakness. To make matters worse, priority attackers run rampant in RU and almost all of them can outright OHKO Jynx. Jynx's movepool doesn't give her any relief either, as she frequently has to rely on two inaccurate moves in Lovely Kiss and Focus Blast to sweep; if either of the aforementioned moves miss, it will likely mean the end of Jynx. While taking an attack isn't in her best interest, dishing one out most certainly is. When played to her strengths, Jynx's offensive prowess is daunting.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Jynx can use her well-known Luna set; a Calm Mind set with max HP and Speed. Luna is not quite as effective is it used to be due to the offensive nature of the current metagame; however, with stall teams becoming more common, the Luna set is an incredible weapon against the archetype. Taunt can be used to stop slower Pokemon from setting up effects, especially Stealth Rock. In a similar vein, Magic Coat can bounce back entry hazards or status afflictions. Signal Beam is an interesting attack that can target both Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon; however, Ice Beam will usually hit harder. Due to Jynx's frailty, Focus Sash can be used, giving her more opportunities to attack. Grass Knot hits Slowking harder than Energy Ball, but it does very little to Lanturn, making it an inferior choice. Finally, Shadow Ball can target Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon making it an acceptable option as well.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Countering Jynx can be cumbersome before Sleep Clause is activated; once it is, Slowking is Jynx's best counter. Slowking takes very little from most of Jynx's attacks and can melt her with Fire Blast; however, Slowking has to avoid an Energy Ball or a boosted Blizzard. Sleep Talk users such as Emboar, Escavalier, Entei, and defensive Spiritomb can all absorb Lovely Kiss and scare Jynx out. Cryogonal and defensive Magneton can both check Jynx fairly well. Cryogonal has to watch out for Psyshock while Magneton has to steer clear of Focus Blast. Specially defensive Escavalier is also a great check so long as Jynx does not have Hidden Power Fire. Entei's great bulk, resistance to Ice-type attacks, and powerful priority move in Extreme Speed make it one of the best Jynx checks in RU. Speaking of priority attacks, Choice Band Spiritomb, Absol, Gallade, and Hariyama can all take advantage of Jynx's pitiful defenses and revenge kill her with their priority moves. Absol, Spiritomb, and Escavalier can even Pursuit trap Jynx on a predicted switch.</p> <p>Stealth Rock helps deal with Jynx, as the residual damage piles up quickly, especially if she uses Life Orb. Finally, because of Jynx's lackluster defenses, any Pokemon that is faster than Jynx and carries a strong neutral attack can outright OHKO her. Cinccino gets a special mention as it is even able to revenge kill Jynx behind a Substitute thanks to Rock Blast and Tail Slap. Accelgor, Galvantula, and Archeops can all outspeed Jynx and OHKO with their powerful STABs. So long as Stealth Rock is not on the field, Typhlosion can switch in once on Jynx and OHKO with Fire Blast.</p> ",

Ice Beam is Jynx's most powerful reliable move, OHKOing bulky Pokemon such as Druddigon and Braviary. Psyshock targets Pokemon that Ice Beam cannot break past, namely pesky special walls such as Clefable, Cryogonal, and Lanturn. Focus Blast destroys Steel-types such as Steelix and Magneton. Due to Focus Blast's unappealing accuracy, Hidden Power Fire can be used. On top of the improved accuracy, Hidden Power Fire has the added bonus of OHKOing Durant and Escavalier. With Lovely Kiss, Jynx can potentially disable a counter for the entirety of the match; from there, Jynx can bombard the foe with attacks or let a teammate remove it.</p> <p>Energy Ball is a reliable option to OHKO Kabutops and to nail Slowking, who would otherwise wall Jynx. Nasty Plot and Psychic are two other options. Psychic hits physical walls such as Hariyama and Alomomola, while Nasty Plot boosts Jynx's Special Attack to terrifying levels. Finally, Jynx can use Choice Specs to boost her power without the cost of recoil. If Jynx does use Choice Specs, she should probably use Trick over Lovely Kiss, giving up a sleep move but allowing her to cripple a wall such as Slowking.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is much appreciated as it allows Jynx to put more pressure on the opponent. Speaking of Stealth Rock, the pointed stones limit Jynx's switching opportunities. Thus, Kabutops partners well with Jynx, eliminating Stealth Rock and dealing with troublesome Fire-types. In return, Jynx can take out Rotom-C and Lilligant, two problematic Grass-types. Just like Kabutops, Poliwrath and Slowking can take on an array of pesky Fire-types like Typhlosion and Entei.</p> "

Nasty Plot is the second most important aspect of the set, as after a few boosts, Jynx will be powerful enough to 2HKO Slowking and Lanturn, Pokemon who resist her attacks. Ice Beam is the chosen attack because no Pokemon is immune to Ice-type attacks, meaning Jynx can even plow through resists after a Nasty Plot boost or two. Lovely Kiss ensures that Jynx gets to set up at least one Nasty Plot by disabling a counter or a faster revenge killer.</p> <p>A Life Orb can be used over Leftovers to gain a power boost, however, it will limit the amount of times Jynx can set up a Substitute and make her reliant on Wish support from either Clefable or Alomomola. Psychic or Psyshock can be used over Lovely Kiss so that Jynx isn't walled by Fire- and Water-type Pokemon, and another coverage move of choice can work as well. Do keep in mind that, without Lovely Kiss, Jynx will accumulate fewer boosts on average.</p> <p>Jynx appreciates entry hazard support, as well as a way to handle Cinccino and Klinklang. Ferroseed and Steelix can both set up Stealth Rock and deal with Cinccino, a troublesome Pokemon for any Substitute user. Rapid Spin support from Cryogonal and Kabutops is not necessary, however, it extends Jynx's longevity, giving her more opportunities to come in and set up. Roselia, Omastar, and Qwilfish can set up Toxic Spikes in order to break down resilient walls; they can also set up Spikes to soften up the opposing team. Offensive Grass-types such as Sceptile and Lilligant can break through bulky Water-types, letting Jynx sweep more easily. In the same vein, Fighting-types like Gallade and Fire-types such as Moltres can destroy the plethora of Steel-types that harry Jynx.</p> "

Choice Scarf Jynx is able to outspeed Cinccino, Durant, +2 Omastar, and +2 Aggron and OHKO them with Focus Blast after Stealth Rock.

Finally, Hidden Power Fire can be used to revenge kill Durant and Escavalier.</p> <p>Jynx appreciates powerful wallbreakers such as Moltres, Absol, Gallade, and Sceptile are needed in order to soften up the opposing team, allowing it to clean up fairly easily. Entry hazard support from Druddigon and Scolipede is also helpful in chipping away at the opposing team. Rapid Spin support from Cryogonal and Kabutops is useful because Jynx will not be restricted to the amount of times it can switch in.

  "Pinsir": {
    "overview": "<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the coolest, Pinsir scores at least a 12. Besides its fantastic design, Pinsir also boasts a fearsome base 125 Attack, above-average Speed, STAB X-Scissor to hit many of RU's walls super effectively, and powerful coverage moves such as Earthquake, Stone Edge, and Close Combat. Throw that all together and you have a dangerous offensive Pokemon. Unfortunately for Pinsir, \"dangerous offensive Pokemon\" are a common sight in RU, and Pinsir's limited switch-in opportunities and lack of a powerful STAB move have made it difficult to justify using over other physical sweepers like Kabutops, Gallade, and Durant. In fact, there's only one thing that really makes Pinsir worth considering over more standard alternatives: Moxie. Pinsir is the only viable Pokemon with Moxie in RU, giving it a unique ability to put constantly increasing offensive pressure on its opponent. Moxie forces Pinsir's opponents to respond predictably or risk losing the match quickly as Pinsir picks up boosts and becomes unwallable. It requires a significant amount of support to be successful; if you're looking for a physical sweeper that you can throw on your team as an afterthought and be successful, Kabutops or Gallade would be a better choice. On the other hand, if you're looking to build a team around an extremely manly bug with the potential to steamroll healthy teams in just a few turns, give Pinsir a shot.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Pinsir can use an all-out attacking set with Life Orb or Choice Band to do a lot of damage to slow or paralyzed teams. However, it has difficulty switching in safely, and faster Pokemon will easily force it out, so this type of set doesn't really play to Pinsir's strengths. A Substitute + 3 attacks set with a Salac Berry can sweep late-game if the opponent's physical walls and priority users have been eliminated, but it will struggle to accomplish anything at all before those two conditions are met. Superpower and the uncommon Storm Throw are Pinsir's best legal options for Fighting-type coverage on sets that use Quick Attack, but both are completely inferior to Close Combat in any other situation. Pinsir can set up Stealth Rock if absolutely necessary, but it's not very good in a supporting role and rarely has moveslots to spare. Toxic is Pinsir's best option against certain bulky Pokemon like Misdreavus and Quagsire. Finally, Hyper Cutter and Mold Breaker are both decent abilities; Mold Breaker in particular is intriguing, as it allows Pinsir to beat one of its biggest counters in Rotom (although Mold Breaker announces itself when Pinsir comes into the match, so good players won't switch Rotom in). Unfortunately, Pinsir is simply a mediocre Pokemon without Moxie. If you're using Pinsir with one of its other abilities, you'd almost certainly be better off using another Pokemon like Kabutops, Durant, Gallade, or Entei in its place.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Quagsire and Misdreavus are the safest counters to Pinsir; Misdreavus resists or is immune to most of Pinsir's attacks, has excellent physical bulk with Eviolite, and can burn Pinsir with Will-O-Wisp, while Quagsire ignores Pinsir's Moxie boosts with Unaware and can simply stall it out with Recover. All other counters depend on which set Pinsir is running. Rotom and Aerodactyl are excellent answers to the Swords Dance set, but neither can switch into Stone Edge from the Choice Scarf set. Poliwrath and Alomomola are hard stops to the Choice Scarf set, but Poliwrath takes heavy damage from the Swords Dance set and can only phaze Pinsir with Circle Throw, while Alomomola becomes setup bait as it is forced into a predictable Wish + Protect cycle. Faster Choice Scarf users that can survive Quick Attack are good revenge killers if Pinsir is weakened, but most of them won't be able to OHKO a healthy Pinsir without a STAB super effective attack; for example, Choice Scarf Rotom-C's Thunderbolt does a maximum of 78% to Pinsir. In general, the most important thing is to prevent Pinsir from boosting. Avoid switching in slower Pokemon that give it a chance to set up or weakened Pokemon that it can KO for a free Moxie boost. Without boosts, Pinsir is just another powerful physical attacker that any good team should already be able to handle.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>The market for Swords Dance in RU might seem crowded, but Pinsir has plenty of perks that make it a lethal boosting sweeper. Above-average Speed gives Pinsir the advantage against the popular base 80 Speed group, and a solid Defense stat allows it to brush off most priority moves. Bug typing, despite all its defensive disadvantages, is a blessing offensively, as STAB X-Scissor slices through many of RU's top defensive Pokemon, including Tangrowth, Slowking, and Uxie. Earthquake is the coverage move that RU's other Bug-types wish they had, giving Pinsir super effective coverage against Qwilfish, Steelix, and Rhydon. The true magic of this set, however, is the combination of Quick Attack and Moxie. For most Pokemon, non-STAB Quick Attack is dismissed as too weak to be useful, but with Moxie, it becomes an excellent defense against revenge killers and is the key to Pinsir's success. After a Swords Dance boost, Pinsir can OHKO most of RU's best walls with X-Scissor or Earthquake. With Moxie kicking in and boosting Pinsir to +3, Quick Attack becomes powerful enough to OHKO most potential revenge killers with hazard support. Once it reaches +3, the list of Pokemon that can stop Pinsir from sweeping is short: Aerodactyl, Archeops, Durant, Emboar (with a Choice Scarf), Entei, Misdreavus, Quagsire, and Rotom. Unless your opponent has one of those Pokemon healthy, the game is over.</p> <p>Of course, the real trick is getting to +3 in the first place. Pinsir's best chance at setting up is by forcing out slow Pokemon like Slowking and Lanturn. Against fast offensive teams, Pinsir probably won't have the opportunity to set up and is unlikely to single-handedly 6-0 your opponent's team. However, it still has value in offensive match-ups thanks to its Speed, power, and access to priority. Pinsir can OHKO Kabutops attempting to spin or pick off weakened Cinccino and Manectric with Quick Attack, and although a single Moxie boost usually won't be enough to sweep, it does put a lot of pressure on your opponent to play conservatively and predictably to avoid giving Pinsir the opportunity to pick up any more boosts.</p> <p>Here are some damage calculations showing how difficult Pinsir can be to wall at +2 and to revenge kill at +3:</p> <ul> <li>+2 X-Scissor vs. 252/252+ Tangrowth 110.6 - 131.2% <li>+2 X-Scissor vs. 252/88 Amoonguss 99.5 - 117.6%</li> <li>+2 X-Scissor vs. 252/124 Druddigon 96.9 - 114.2%</li> <li>+1 Earthquake vs. 252/240+ Qwilfish 119.2 - 140.1%</li> <li>+2 Earthquake vs. 88/0 Eviolite Rhydon 92.8 - 109.4% (94% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>+2 Earthquake vs. 248/0 Escavalier 84.5 - 99.7% (75% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>+2 Earthquake vs. 252/220+ Steelix 74.9 - 89% (31% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock and 1 layer of Spikes)</li> <li>+3 Quick Attack vs. 0/4 Absol 83.8 - 98.9% (75% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>+3 Quick Attack vs. 0/4 Galvantula 80.8 - 95.4% (OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>+3 Quick Attack vs. 0/4 Manectric 80.8 - 95.4% (56% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>+3 Quick Attack vs. 0/4 Moltres 51.4 - 60.7% (OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>+3 Quick Attack vs. 0/4 Cinccino 78 - 92.1% (OHKO after Stealth Rock and 1 layer of Spikes)</li> <li>+3 Quick Attack vs. 0/4 Sceptile 75.8 - 89.7% (94% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock and 1 layer of Spikes)</li> <li>+3 Quick Attack vs. 0/4 Typhlosion 62.3 - 73.4% (69% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock and 1 layer of Spikes)</li> </ul> <p>Life Orb and an Adamant nature might sound like overkill at first, given that Pinsir will be boosting its Attack with Swords Dance and Moxie, but a look at the calculations above reveals that Pinsir really does need all the power it can get. Switching to a Lum Berry or a Jolly nature makes many of those OHKOs disappear, and if Pinsir can't OHKO its initial switch-in or potential revenge killer, its sweep will end before it begins. Luckily, Kabutops and Gallade usually run Adamant natures, so Adamant Pinsir will still outspeed them, although it will unfortunately miss out on beating Smeargle and Timid Mesprit. Stone Edge is a tempting move to add to this set in order to hit Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Moltres, and Rotom, but most of its potential targets are faster than Pinsir, so it wouldn't prevent them from stopping Pinsir's sweep; it's certainly not worth giving up Earthquake's coverage against physical walls or Quick Attack's priority. Close Combat would normally be an appealing alternative to Earthquake, but sadly it is illegal with Quick Attack, so it is not recommended on this set.</p> <p>As the calculations above show, Pinsir relies heavily on entry hazard support. Stealth Rock is absolutely essential for wearing down Moltres and Pinsir's other Fire- and Flying-type checks, but Spikes are also very valuable, especially for bringing faster Pokemon into Quick Attack's range. If you can consistently get multiple layers of Spikes up, that extra damage can also make up for the power loss if you choose to use a Jolly nature. Qwilfish is a fantastic teammate for Pinsir, as it can set up Spikes, spread paralysis to help Pinsir beat faster Pokemon that Quick Attack can't OHKO, and check most of the Pokemon that give Pinsir trouble. Uxie and Druddigon are also good teammates that can spread paralysis to additional targets and set up Stealth Rock. Spiritomb and Escavalier provide helpful Pursuit support to take out opposing Rotom, Misdreavus, and Mesprit. Finally, Pinsir greatly appreciates Rapid Spin support. It isn't strictly necessary, as Pinsir should ideally only need to switch in one time per match to sweep, but Kabutops has excellent synergy with Pinsir, so it's usually worth including.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Pinsir's decent Speed, excellent Attack, and great coverage moves make it an effective revenge killer when holding a Choice Scarf. It can OHKO many of RU's most popular sweepers, including Kabutops, Sceptile, Entei, Cinccino, Sigilyph, and Moltres, and its solid Defense allows it to survive powerful priority attacks, including Choice Band Entei's Extreme Speed and +2 Life Orb Kabutops's Aqua Jet. Moxie is the cherry on top of this set, allowing Pinsir to put heavy pressure on the opponent and potentially achieve a late-game sweep. However, beware of focusing too much on trying to get a Moxie sweep. Without a boosting item or the ability to switch moves, Pinsir is quite easy to wall, even at +1, so it usually won't have any shot at sweeping until late in the game when the opponent's team is significantly weakened. This can make it tempting to try to keep Pinsir healthy for the end of the match in order to achieve that sweep. Unfortunately, no matter how healthy it is, there will be many matches when Pinsir simply won't be able to sweep, so keeping it in reserve all match will result in a wasted teamslot and put you at a disadvantage. If your opponent's team looks particularly vulnerable to a Pinsir sweep, go for it, but otherwise you should play Pinsir like any other revenge killer: send it out whenever you need to KO or force out a dangerous opponent.</p> <p>240 Speed EVs allow Pinsir to outspeed +1 Modest Magmortar and +2 Adamant Aggron. The 16 HP EVs actually do serve a useful purpose: they guarantee that Pinsir will survive a super effective Hidden Power from Life Orb Sceptile if it hasn't taken any previous damage, meaning Pinsir can revenge kill Sceptile even if Sceptile has a Substitute up. Pinsir needs an Adamant nature to consistently get the KOs it should; Entei, Sigilyph, and Emboar will usually survive a hit from Jolly Pinsir even after Stealth Rock, but all three will usually fall to Adamant Pinsir. You should only consider using Jolly if you have multiple layers of hazards to make up for the loss of power and you need Pinsir to outspeed Accelgor and positive-nature +1 base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Jolly Choice Scarf Medicham and Jolly Weak Armor Kabutops. Speaking of Kabutops, it is an excellent partner for this set. As a revenge killer, Pinsir will want to switch in several times during the match without being crippled by Stealth Rock damage; Kabutops can reliably spin away hazards and has great synergy with Pinsir. Poliwrath is a hard stop to both Pinsir and Kabutops, so make sure you bring something that can beat it, such as Rotom, Sigilyph, or Uxie.</p> "

  "Tauros": {
    "overview": "<p>Tauros is arguably the best offensive Normal-type available in RU, eclipsing the competition thanks to his wonderful combination of power, coverage, speed, and durability. Looking at his stats, the first thing that strikes the eye is his excellent base Speed stat, which is high enough to let him outpace a large portion of the unboosted metagame. Although his base Attack stat is not sky-high, Tauros has access to Sheer Force, an ability that boosts the power of all moves with a secondary effect by 30%, so most of his moves hit fairly hard. Luckily, his movepool is wide enough to make use of his ability, and the coverage moves at his disposal, most notably Fire Blast, hit a large portion of the metagame for super effective damage. Moreover, Sheer Force allows Tauros to run Life Orb without having to worry about recoil damage slowly wearing him down. This is particularly important because he has good bulk when compared to the many fast and frail attackers in the tier, and preserving it can help him survive weaker attacks or even attempts to revenge kill him. Despite all of these positive traits, Tauros is not a flawless Pokemon; in fact, his potential in the tier is hindered by the fact that he is countered by several rather common Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Spiritomb, and checked by a number of other prominent threats, most notably Golurk and Rhydon. Another thing that keeps Tauros from being an unstoppable force is the fact that he usually relies on moves with imperfect accuracy, and this can sometimes limit what he can accomplish throughout a battle. That said, Tauros is still an outstanding Pokemon in the tier that has the ability to tear apart teams when properly supported by his teammates.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thanks to his generous movepool and usable stats, Tauros has some other sets he can run, even though they are not as dangerous as the one listed above. Thanks to his awesome Speed stat, Tauros can run a decent Choice Scarf set that outspeeds most of the other relevant Choice Scarf users, even with an Adamant nature. Intimidate should be the ability of choice in this case, given that this set runs the more reliable Double-Edge as a STAB move. A set employing Substitute and Endeavor, albeit rather gimmicky, can help Tauros in dealing with Alomomola, as long as he is adequately supported via Toxic Spikes and possibly Pursuit to trap Ghost-types, which are immune to Endeavor. This set must resort to Rock Slide to hit most of the Ghost-types in the tier, but sadly, Golurk hard walls this move combination. Tauros can also make use of his secondary ability, Intimidate, when equipped with a Choice Band. Choice Band Tauros functions as an offensive pivot, coming in on physical attackers and scaring them away with powerful moves, and is capable of netting safe 2HKOs with Earthquake on Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Rhydon.</p> <p>Apart from Fire Blast, Tauros has an expansive special movepool that unfortunately goes wasted for the most part due to his meager Special Attack stat. The only special move that adds to Tauros's coverage is Thunderbolt, which is his only way of ensuring a 2HKO on Alomomola, although he needs Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes to do so. These entry hazard requirements can be lowered by moving some Attack EVs into Special Attack, but this will hamper his overall effectiveness. Tauros has some other physical Sheer Force-boosted moves to choose from, namely Iron Head and the more powerful but less accurate Iron Tail. Both of these moves can supply Tauros with a recoil-free move that hits Rock-types (barring Aggron) harder than Earthquake does. Earthquake has more general utility on this set, but it must be noted that Iron Tail allows Tauros to 2HKO Rhydon after Stealth Rock damage. The only boosting move available to Tauros is Work Up, but its use is generally not recommended, as in most cases, he is better off attacking. As a side note, Sheer Force Tauros can't use Body Slam over the somewhat inaccurate Rock Climb due to legality issues.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to deal with Tauros is by using a Pokemon that outright walls him, and there are several of them that can perform this task. Bulky Ghost-types, most notably Spiritomb and Misdreavus, can tank any of his moves and proceed to cripple him with Will-O-Wisp. Other Ghost-types such as Golurk and bulky Rotom are less safe as counters, because they have a chance to be 2HKOed by Zen Headbutt after entry hazard damage. With Regenerator and its massive physical bulk, Alomomola can switch in comfortably on any attack and support its teammates with Wish. Poliwrath can wall Tauros, as it cannot be 2HKOed by any of his moves and can phaze him out with Circle Throw. However, it needs to be wary of switching into Tauros if Spikes are on the field, seeing that Tauros can predict the switch and 2HKO with Zen Headbutt. Physically defensive Slowking risks getting 2HKOed by Rock Climb after Stealth Rock damage, but takes negligible damage from his other moves and can function as a pivot, switching out to recover health with Regenerator. Rock-types such as Rhydon and Regirock are incredibly bulky on the physical side, can tank an Earthquake on the switch as Tauros can't 2HKO them, and retaliate with their move of choice. Another common Pokemon that can endure Tauros's attacks is Uxie; however, its below average offensive presence means that it can only incapacitate him with status.</p> <p>Most faster Pokemon, such as Sceptile, Accelgor, and Aerodactyl, the latter of which takes little damage from his STAB moves, can reliably revenge kill Tauros. This is obviously valid for Choice Scarf users as well; Fighting-types in particular, such as Medicham and Emboar, are solid answers to Tauros, easily OHKOing him with their STAB moves. Bulky Fighting-types such as Hariyama and Gurdurr are competent checks as they can, in most cases, OHKO him with their STAB moves. The former can use Close Combat, while the latter has Drain Punch and can pick off a weakened Tauros with Mach Punch. Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan are more common users of Mach Punch, but they need Tauros to be weakened beforehand as they cannot OHKO him from full health, and will be OHKOed in return by Rock Climb. Moreover, Hitmonlee most commonly runs an offensive Unburden set that has to consume its only opportunity to sweep in order to beat Tauros reliably, which can prove to be counterproductive if its counters are still around. In general, Tauros is not overly afraid of other priority moves. The only notable exception is Choice Band Entei's ExtremeSpeed, which will 2HKO him with just a little bit of prior damage, whereas Tauros can't OHKO a fully healthy Entei.</p> ",

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>An all-out attacking set is the most appropriate way to make use of Tauros's qualities, as he has the power and coverage to wallbreak and the Speed to perform a late-game sweep, provided that his counters have been removed. Rock Climb, albeit inaccurate, is Tauros's best option as a STAB move, and hits quite hard thanks to the boost from Sheer Force. The opponent's Pokemon must have impressive physical bulk and/or a resistance to Normal-type moves to avoid being 2HKOed. Earthquake is a mandatory coverage move that hits the Rock-types that resist Tauros's STAB moves for super effective damage, dealing a considerable amount of damage to most of them. In the third slot, Tauros runs Fire Blast, which is an important selling point of this set and allows him to differentiate himself from his competitors. In fact, in spite of his measly base 40 Special Attack, Tauros can use the move to 2HKO some otherwise problematic physical walls, such as Steelix, Tangrowth, and Ferroseed, and OHKO Durant and Escavalier lacking Occa Berry (the latter only after Stealth Rock damage). The fourth slot is basically a matter of preference: Zen Headbutt, provided that Stealth Rock is up, has a chance to 2HKO Poliwrath and Golurk and a better chance, compared to Earthquake, to 2HKO Qwilfish, whereas Rock Slide mainly targets Flying-types such as Moltres, Sigilyph, and Aerodactyl.</p> <p>The EV distribution listed in the set is in practice the only one Tauros can afford to run, and a Naive nature is compulsory as well, given that Special Defense is his only expandable stat. More specifically, a Special Attack-lowering nature would diminish the power output of Fire Blast, which is barely adequate to begin with, and an Attack-boosting nature would deprive Tauros of the ability to outspeed important threats such as Durant and Manectric. If moves with low accuracy aren't your cup of tea, Tauros has other powerful and more reliable STAB options, namely Double-Edge and Return. The first has the obvious advantage of a higher Base Power, but the recoil combined with the damage from Life Orb can steadily reduce Tauros's staying power, which is quite good. Another option for the fourth moveslot is Substitute, which can help ease prediction, especially when your opponent has multiple checks to Tauros, and shield him from priority users and revenge killers. Lastly, Toxic allows Tauros to cripple many of its common switch-ins, such as Alomomola, Quagsire, Rhydon, and Regirock. The last two are damaged by Toxic the most because their standard sets don't include recovery moves. Unfortunately, giving up on any of Tauros's coverage moves will significantly expand his list of checks and counters.</p> <p>Tauros, like many offensive Pokemon, really appreciates entry hazard support. One layer of Spikes is enough to secure 2HKOs on Steelix, Poliwrath, and Golurk, all of which resist Stealth Rock, with the appropriate move. On the other hand, Stealth Rock will suffice for Tauros to be able to obtain the OHKO on Escavalier and give Tauros a chance to 2HKO Qwilfish. Qwilfish has good defensive synergy with Tauros and can set up Spikes in the face of some of its counters. Roselia is also a good choice for this role, and it is particularly good at taking advantage of Alomomola. On more offensively inclined teams, you may prefer setting up hazards through a dedicated lead; notable examples of suicide leads are Smeargle, Crustle, and Omastar. Bulky Psychic-types such as Uxie and Mesprit can cover Tauros's weakness, are able to set up Stealth Rock, and are particularly troublesome for Fighting-type Choice Scarf users that threaten Tauros. Other countermeasures for Choice Scarf users include Druddigon and specially defensive Torterra, both of which fare well against the most common of them, Rotom-C, and can offer Stealth Rock support. Choice Scarf Medicham can work as a great teammate for Tauros, as it has good defensive synergy with him and can clean up the opponent's team after Tauros has weakened its counters. In addition, Medicham's access to Trick can come in handy in order to cripple counters, such as Spiritomb and Alomomola, with a Choice Scarf. When using this offensive core though, finding a way to get past Ghost-types becomes even more important.</p> <p>Grass-types such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and Tangrowth get many switch-in opportunities against Alomomola and other bulky Water-types, and can also take care of the sturdy Rock-types that resist Tauros's STAB moves. Fearing a Scald burn, Rock Polish Torterra cannot switch into Alomomola directly, but nonetheless has particularly good offensive synergy with Tauros. Tauros can easily defeat Torterra's best counters, namely Tangrowth and Ferroseed, and appreciates its ability to get past Alomomola. Lastly, Fire-types such as Moltres and Emboar are good partners for Tauros, as they can take advantage of the bulky Ghost-types that wall him and put additional pressure on the Pokemon that Tauros is supposed to hit with Fire Blast.</p> "

  "Ditto": {
    "overview": "<p>Ditto, formerly nothing but the whore of the Pokemon world, has finally risen to some degree of usefulness. While previously Ditto's only real use was breeding to obtain Pokemon with perfect IVs, it has received a tremendous boon in its new ability, Imposter. Imposter allows Ditto to instantly Transform into the Pokemon it is facing upon switching in, perfectly copying said Pokemon's moves and stat boosts, along with every stat other than HP. This makes Ditto a decent revenge killer in the tier, with its ability to check most boosted Pokemon with ease by copying the opponent's boosts and turning sweeps completely around. However, Ditto cannot be played recklessly due to retaining its poor HP stat upon transformation, and is forced to run a Choice Scarf in order to guarantee that it outspeeds the Pokemon it transforms into. Ditto is also extremely predictable as well as borderline useless against most defensively oriented teams that lack setup sweepers for Ditto to copy. Finally, Ditto suffers from RU's relative lack in setup sweepers, and there are also a few that sweepers that are incapable of doing very much damage against themselves or often utilize a Substitute, which blocks Imposter, such as Klinklang. Regardless, it is a completely viable Pokemon that is nearly unparalleled in its ability to fix up holes on teams suffering against some of RU's powerful boosting sweepers.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>To put it bluntly, Ditto has basically no other options. The only effective way to use it is as a revenge killer with a Choice Scarf, with the only possible variations being in the type of Hidden Power it uses. As mentioned, Hidden Power Fire, achieved with the IVs 30 Atk / 30 Def / 30 Spe, is the most useful, although Hidden Power Rock with the IVs of 30 Def / 30 SpD / 30 Spe is also effective. Other viable, though by no means as effective, options include Hidden Power Grass, with IVs of 30 Atk / 30 SpA, and Hidden Power Ground, with IVs of 30 SpA / 30 SpD. Aside from Hidden Power types, Ditto is completely without other usable choices.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Technically, Ditto has no true counter due to the fact that it is a different Pokemon every time it switches in, but it has a few very easily exploitable flaws. Keeping its minuscule base HP stat after transforming is Ditto's most notable weak point, as it means that Ditto is easily beaten by most users of priority moves, which can be a hindrance to any Ditto attempting to sweep the opponent after copying one of their offensive Pokemon's boosts. Similarly, Ditto is also very Pursuit weak if it copies a frail Pokemon, as its low base HP causes it be easily demolished by some of the high-powered Pursuit users in RU. The fact that Ditto maintains its typing and ability until after it switches in is another minor issue for Ditto, as it is hit by Spikes, Stealth Rock, and Toxic Spikes upon switching in, easily wearing it down over time as it switches in and out to check sweepers.</p> <p>Ditto is naturally incredibly predictable, as it is copying the exact moveset and ability of the Pokemon that it switches in against. This can make Ditto very easy to counter, as the player facing Ditto will know its exact moveset and stats. However, the best way of handling Ditto in many situations is simply to play cautiously until it is gone. If Ditto is still alive, simply wait to set up offensive Pokemon such as Hone Claws Durant until after it has fainted. A little bit of patience will help you more against Ditto than any amount of preparation.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Ditto That",
        "description": "<p>Ditto is the epitome of a revenge killer, outspeeding literally everything that it switches in on while copying any offensive and defensive boosts that they've accumulated while in play. Ditto has the nifty advantage of forcing the opponent to play very carefully with all of their boosting sweepers, such as Omastar, Durant, and Fraxure, lest they risk getting swept in return when Ditto switches in to copy the boosts. However, Calm Mind, Quiver Dance, and Bulk Up users are not optimal targets for Ditto unless they are already heavily weakened, as Ditto's low base HP will allow the Pokemon it is copying to defeat it before it can break through. Imposter also allows Ditto to serve as a perfect scout, completely revealing the movesets of the opponent's Pokemon simply by switching in. Ditto must be careful when attempting this, however, because it cannot switch into anything but weak resisted hits due to its incredibly low base HP. Imposter copies abilities as well as moves and stats, which can let Ditto recover off some HP by pivoting in and out against a Pokemon with Regenerator. Similarly, status can be healed by switching Ditto in and out against a Pokemon with Natural Cure. Finally, Ditto even has some small utility against teams that are more defensively minded, as it can switch in against a wall that has a crippling status move such as Toxic or copy an entry hazard, Heal Bell, or Aromatherapy.</p> <p>The only EVs that are significant for Ditto are its HP EVs, as HP is the only stat that Ditto retains after it transforms. The remaining EVs are completely insignificant barring Imposter failing, due to either two Ditto double switching into each other or Ditto switching in against a Pokemon that already has a Substitute up. As the Ditto user should always switch out either of those situations, Ditto's non-HP EVs are irrelevant. Ditto's IVs should be customized depending on what it wants to counter the most effectively; the given IVs give Ditto Hidden Power Fire, which hits the majority of the notable Hidden Power users in RU, such as Lilligant, Rotom-C, Sceptile, and Accelgor. Hidden Power Grass is a somewhat usable option, hitting Omastar and Gorebyss, but Gorebyss isn't really common enough to warrant its use, and Surf OHKOes Omastar if Ditto switches in after a Shell Smash. Hidden Power Rock is the main other option for Ditto's Hidden Power, notably scoring hits on most Fire-types, such as the powerful Moltres, Magmortar, and Typhlosion.</p> <p>Ditto has a very wide range of possible teammates; due to its sole use as a revenge killer, it fits well on both offensive and defensive teams, helping against the majority of offensive Pokemon in the tier. There are, however, a few Pokemon that immediately stick out as pairing well with Ditto, most notably Rapid Spin users. Cryogonal and Kabutops, for example, are very helpful to prevent Ditto from taking too much damage from entry hazards as it switches in and out over the course of a match. Ditto needs all the HP it can get in order to avoid being picked off by the many common priority move users in the tier such as Spiritomb, Entei, and Feraligatr. However, Ditto fits in very well without much support on most teams that simply need a revenge killer, as it effectively checks nearly every setup sweeper in RU.</p> "

  "Flareon": {
    "overview": "<p>Flareon has always had the reputation of being the worst of the Eeveelutions, and the fifth generation didn't do much to change its status in the competitive scene. Despite its excellent base Attack, Flareon is held back by its lack of a powerful physical STAB move, and is therefore forced to concentrate on its next best stat, its Special Defense, in order to pull its weight in battle. Nonetheless, Flareon does make an effective special sponge, as it can literally absorb hits from the powerful Fire-types in RU, such as Moltres and Typhlosion, and at the same time support its team with Wish. Although Flareon will almost never be your first choice for a Fire-type on your team, one would do well to keep its impressive special walling capabilities in mind.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flareon can make good use of its great Attack stat by running a physical set with Flame Charge and Guts. With a Toxic Orb in hand, Facade does an obscene amount of damage to everything except physical walls, and after a Flame Charge, Jolly Flareon outspeeds base 120 Speed Pokemon and Adamant Flareon outspeeds base 105s. Flareon can also set up Sunny Day to boost the power of its special moves; in addition to providing team support, it makes Flareon very powerful as well. In addition, Flareon can make use of Choice items. Choice Specs or Choice Band makes it a bulky attacker, while a mixed Choice Scarf set addresses its middling Speed and lets it revenge kill a fair amount of threats. Other options in Flareon's movepool include Substitute, Curse, Baton Pass, and Yawn. Curse is rather ironic, as Flareon has the perfect stat spread for it to be an effective user of Curse, but doesn't have the movepool for it to work at all.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When countering Flareon, almost any physical attacker can fit the bill. Powerful physical attackers such as Aggron, Aerodactyl, and Feraligatr can annihilate Flareon with their STAB moves without a second thought; however, they must be careful of a burn from either Lava Plume or Will-O-Wisp. Aggron gets a special mention as it is immune to Toxic. Qwilfish is another solid option for getting rid of Flareon, as it is immune to Toxic, takes minimal damage from Flamethrower, and 2HKOes it with Waterfall. Qwilfish can also set up Spikes, making Flareon's job harder the next time it switches in.</p> <p>Flareon is setup fodder for Bulk Up Gallade, and can only hope to beat it with a Toxic on the switch. Entei is another great way of dealing with Flareon, as it can't be burned and takes almost no damage from Flamethrower. It can then either OHKO with a Choice Band Stone Edge or set up Calm Minds while Flareon can do nothing back. Hariyama can also set up Bulk Ups, and thanks to Thick Fat, it easily shrugs off Flamethrower. Flareon usually won't use Toxic for fear of Guts, allowing Hariyama to easily dispose of it with either Drain Punch or Close Combat. Kabutops is a hard counter to Flareon, and can cause problems by either using Stealth Rock or setting up a Swords Dance while it switches out. Crawdaunt can set up Dragon Dances on Flareon, and can avoid status with one of Substitute, Taunt, or Lum Berry. Golurk can also use Substitute to avoid status, and OHKOes with Earthquake. In general, most physical attackers that can avoid status are fine switch-ins to Flareon, as it is setup fodder for nearly all of them and can't beat any of the physical attackers in the tier with the exception of a lucky Toxic or Lava Plume burn.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Tank",
        "description": "<p>Flareon's most impressive attribute is its ability to solidly counter some very threatening specially based Fire- and Grass-types, such as Moltres, Typhlosion, Rotom-C, and offensive Tangrowth. As such, it is a great answer to sun teams, which use the amazing coverage of Grass- and Fire-type moves in RU to great effect. Flareon is also a great team supporter with its access to Wish, and it forms a fantastic defensive core with physically defensive Pokemon that resist its weaknesses but lack recovery, including Ferroseed, Steelix, and Sandslash.</p> <p>Protect is a necessity for Flareon for several reasons: it ensures that Flareon receives the healing from Wish, helps rack up Toxic damage on the foe, and eases prediction by scouting for random super effective moves. Flamethrower is Flareon's best STAB option, but Lava Plume is also a good choice because it has a higher burn rate to help cushion physical hits. Flamethrower is usually the preferred option as it works better in conjunction with Toxic, letting Flareon outlast specially based bulky Water-types. If using Lava Plume, however, Roar is the superior choice to phaze as carrying two status moves is counterproductive.</p> <p>The EV spread makes the most out of Flareon's specially defensive capabilities, and lets it just avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Moltres's Air Slash after Stealth Rock. Two solid alternative moves on this set are Heal Bell and Will-O-Wisp. Heal Bell turns Flareon into the ultimate cleric, with advantages over Clefable in Flash Fire and useful resistances; the loss of Toxic really hurts it, though. Will-O-Wisp patches up Flareon's low Defense, but leaves it vulnerable to bulky Water-types. Hidden Power Grass gives Flareon coverage against Quagsire and hits other Water-types harder, but is incredibly weak otherwise and compromises its ability to run a status move.</p> <p>Good teammates for Flareon are those that can either lay down entry hazards or use Rapid Spin to blow them away. As such, Kabutops is an excellent teammate. Additionally, it has decent synergy with Flareon. As it lacks recovery of its own, it also really appreciates Flareon's Wishes. Ferroseed and Qwilfish are also good partners as they, too, lack recovery, and can set up Spikes and take physical hits. Steelix is an excellent physical wall that can set up Stealth Rock and loves Wish support, although it shares two of Flareon's three weaknesses.</p> "

  "Omastar": {
    "overview": "<p>When looking at Omastar's stats, it seems to be just another one of many bulky Water-type attackers. However, Omastar has access to what is arguably the best boosting move in the game, Shell Smash. With this gem of a move, Omastar is able to fix its low Speed and boost its already great Special Attack stat to incredible levels in just one turn of setup. Omastar also has access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, thus allowing it to step outside of its normal sweeping role with decent success. It can even use Shell Smash along with one of these entry hazards to make for quite the flexible Pokemon. Omastar has some very useful resistances as well, including an all-important 4x Fire-type resistance that lets it use Entei, one of the most common Pokemon in the tier, as easy setup bait.</p> <p>However, Omastar is held back by a few glaring flaws that prevent it from dominating the tier. Its Speed is low; even after a Shell Smash boost, Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom and Manectric can still effortlessly revenge kill Omastar and limit the damage it can do in a match. A mediocre Special Defense combined with weaknesses to common attacking types such as Grass, Electric, and Fighting makes it quite difficult for Omastar to successfully set up and pull off a sweep. Nevertheless, Omastar is a very potent sweeping threat to look out for in RU. Omastar only requires one turn to lay waste to entire teams, so tread lightly around it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Most of the relevant options in Omastar's movepool have already been covered, but there are a couple of other things to consider. Omastar could use Choice Specs to hit really hard right off the bat, but Omastar will generally want to use a free turn to set up a Shell Smash or a layer of entry hazards. Ancient Power and Hidden Power Rock can be used for a Rock-type STAB move, but this is usually not needed due to Omastar's great three move coverage. Knock Off can be used on the defensive set to remove items off of Pokemon such as Roselia and Ferroseed. Hidden Power Fire is an option if you're really having issues against Jynx or Ferroseed, but Hidden Power Grass is usually too important to give up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When trying to counter Omastar, it's generally best to use a Choice Scarf Pokemon that can outspeed and OHKO it at +2. Rotom and Manectric are the best two options for this as their STAB Volt Switches can OHKO Omastar or build momentum for their team if Omastar switches out. Primeape isn't a very common Pokemon, but it can outspeed +2 Omastar if it has a Choice Scarf equipped and it can defeat Omastar with STAB Close Combat. However, they will fail to outspeed if Omastar is able to get a Weak Armor boost on top of a Shell Smash boost. Lanturn is a solid defensive response as it can survive even a +2 Life Orb-boosted Hidden Power Grass and proceed to OHKO Omastar with Volt Switch. Depending on the set it's running, Slowking can handle Omastar decently well. Slowking's Choice Specs set only loses to Life Orb variants while defensive Slowking only loses to Lum Berry variants of the Shell Smash set. Roselia fears a +2 Life Orb Ice Beam, but it can take any other hit and proceed to OHKO Omastar with its STAB Giga Drain. If Omastar lacks a Life Orb, Jynx can check it thanks to its immunity to Water and Ice-type resistance. Ferroseed can beat Omastar if it packs Seed Bomb, but both must be wary of the rare Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>A powerful priority user can limit the damage Omastar can cause. Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan are the most notable since their STAB Mach Punch can hit Omastar for super effective damage. Hitmonlee is also able to threaten with a counter-sweep with Unburden-boosted Speed after it activates its Fighting Gem with Mach Punch. Absol and Spiritomb can utilize their powerful STAB Sucker Punch, but they will need Omastar to be weakened a little due to its high base 125 Defense. Each of Omastar's hazard sets can be limited through the use of Rapid Spin. Kabutops and Cryogonal are by far the best spinners in the tier and Cryogonal even matches up well against Omastar in most cases. Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Lilligant, and Roselia can easily threaten the defensive set due to its lack of offensive investment. Finally, you can always resort to constant offensive pressure to limit the chances Omastar has to set up. However, you must be very careful if you rely on Pokemon like Entei and Swellow to provide this general pressure, as Omastar can easily use their STAB moves as setup bait, and all Omastar needs is one turn to wreak havoc for the rest of the match.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Shell Smash",
        "description": "<p>This is the set that made Omastar the feared sweeping threat it is today. With just a single turn, Omastar is capable of boosting its Speed and Special Attack to very threatening levels, and it's all thanks to Shell Smash. After using this, Omastar can make use of its solid three move coverage to ravage the opposing team. Omastar's STAB move comes down to the age old argument of power vs. accuracy. Since this Omastar is used more as a sweeper, Surf is preferred for the reliability it brings and still has sufficient power in most situations. Hydro Pump is an option in order to muscle past Pokemon like Cryogonal and Uxie, but an untimely miss can mark the premature end of a sweep. Ice Beam is useful to hit the many Grass-types in RU, including Rotom-C, Sceptile, and Amoonguss. Hidden Power Grass rounds off Omastar's coverage and allows it to deal with opposing Water-types such as Slowking, Lanturn, and Alomomola.</p> <p>Timid is the preferred nature to ensure Omastar can outspeed Rotom-C, the most common Choice Scarf user in the tier, after a Shell Smash boost. Weak Armor is the recommended ability as it grants Omastar an extra Speed boost if it manages to come in on a physical attack, such as Entei's Flare Blitz. The item choice is a bit difficult as there are plenty of options. However, Lum Berry and Life Orb are generally the best choices. Lum Berry grants more leniency to Omastar, allowing it to set up on more defensive threats that might use status to cripple Omastar. Life Orb is also a decent option, as it lets Omastar sweep sooner since special walls won't need to be weakened as much with the boost in power. Earth Power can be used for a stronger hit on Lanturn, but it has very little use outside of this. Substitute is an option to get around Sucker Punch users such as Absol and Spiritomb, but this restricts Omastar's coverage. White Herb is an alternative item choice to negate the defense drops from using Shell Smash, but it's actually counter-productive with the defense drop incurred from Weak Armor. Lastly, Omastar can use Swift Swim should it be used on a rain team. However, you should only use Swift Swim if you plan on using a rain team, as you won't run into many opposing rain teams in RU.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom and Choice Scarf Manectric are perhaps the best answers to this set thanks to their ability to outspeed and OHKO Omastar at +2, so having a check or counter for them is highly recommended to remove them from play. Roselia and Druddigon are good responses to these threats as well as many other Grass- and Electric-types that could become problematic. Roselia's access to Spikes and its Fire-type weakness make it a very appealing option as it attracts the likes of Emboar and Entei like a magnet. Special attacker Manectric can absorb Volt Switches and Thunderbolts from any Electric-type attempting to revenge kill Omastar and use the Lightningrod boost it gains to facilitate its own sweep. Pursuit support can be helpful to weaken or outright KO Slowking. Escavalier has great synergy with Omastar as it can check any Grass-type without Hidden Power Fire and its 4x Fire weakness can lure out Fire-type moves for Omastar to set up on. Specially defensive Gallade can tank any hit other than Life Orb Hydro Pump and KO back with Drain Punch, so Sigilyph and Braviary are good choices to deal with it. Hitmonlee is also a very serious threat as it can revenge kill Omastar with a Fighting Gem-boosted Mach Punch and attempt to counter-sweep with its Unburden-boosted Speed. Mesprit can not only check Hitmonlee, but it can also easily handle most other Fighting-types, including specially defensive Gallade and the rarer Choice Scarf Primeape.</p> "

        "name": "Suicide Lead",
        "description": "<p>Instead of using a free turn to set up Shell Smash and sweep the opposing team, this Omastar uses free turns to litter the other side of the field with entry hazards. Omastar might lack the Speed of other fast Spikers such as Smeargle and Scolipede, but a combination of Weak Armor and Icy Wind can mitigate this. Spikes is the main entry hazard on this set due to its lesser distribution and Omastar's ability to get two layers up almost every time. Scald generally gets the nod for Omastar's STAB move as the burn chance can deter physical attackers from attempting to set up on it. Hydro Pump is an option for the much greater power, but Omastar's primary concern should be to get entry hazards up. Icy Wind is nice to slow down faster Pokemon switching in such as Manectric, Sceptile, and Galvantula. Ice Beam is a solid alternative to get the harder hit on Pokemon such as Druddigon and Amoonguss, which are already slower than Omastar. The last move gives Omastar added utility. Stealth Rock allows Omastar to support its team even more and free up a teamslot to cover other things. However, Shell Smash is an option if you don't need Omastar to use Stealth Rock. Although it looks odd, Shell Smash allows Omastar to weaken the opposing team and have more flexibility in how it's played outside of the lead position. Note that you should always use Ice Beam if you opt for Shell Smash as you will now have a way of boosting Omastar's Speed reliably.</p> <p>This set simply aims to set up as many entry hazards as possible, so maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed is used to aid this. Focus Sash ensures that Omastar can survive an attack and possibly get an extra layer of hazards up before it goes down. Weak Armor is the preferred ability as it boosts Omastar's Speed if it gets hit by a physical move. This, when used in conjunction with Icy Wind, allows Omastar to handle most offensive leads such as Scolipede. Earth Power is an option to hit the likes of Qwilfish, Kabutops, and Lanturn hard. Toxic Spikes can provide extra entry hazard support, but Qwilfish is usually better for the dual Spiking role. Surf is a middle ground between Scald and Hydro Pump, but the burn chance of Scald or the raw power of Hydro Pump is generally preferred.</p> <p>Omastar fares well against most leads, but there is one that it is absolutely powerless against: Smeargle. Due to Spore, Smeargle can immediately put Omastar to sleep and begin littering Omastar's side of the field with entry hazards. For this reason, Sleep Talk users such as Emboar and Entei make for very solid options. Magmortar and Primeape have Vital Spirit to avoid sleep and can easily take out Smeargle. Substitute users such as Gallade and Sceptile can use Substitute to block Spore and do serious damage to the opposing team. However, these Pokemon need to be careful of Whirlwind. Pokemon with Sap Sipper, such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck, are also good choices to deal with Smeargle. Since this set will generally set up hazards and go down early in the match, a spinblocker is useful to protect the entry hazards Omastar lays down. Spiritomb matches up extremely well with Cryogonal and a Foul Play Spiritomb can cause Kabutops some major issues as well. Bulky Rotom is a more reliable answer to Kabutops. Pokemon that can take advantage of the Spikes support Omastar gives are good teammates. Rotom-C is able to come in on Ground-, Electric-, and Grass-type moves aimed at Omastar and can force multiple switches with its STAB Volt Switch. Choice Band Druddigon is a great Sleep Talk user and it will find it much easier to break through its checks with Spikes support. The deal is made all the better since Druddigon can come in on Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Omastar to begin unleashing its powerful attacks. Moltres and Magmortar can break through Lanturn much more quickly with Spikes support. Finally, Stealth Rock users are solid options should Omastar opt to use Shell Smash. Mesprit is immune to Ground-type moves and resists Fighting-type moves while also having U-turn to bring Omastar in safely. Lastly, Steelix can use Roar to rack up residual damage thanks to Omastar's Spikes.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Omastar's great base 125 Defense and key resistances to Fire-, Normal-, and Flying-type moves to check dangerous threats and supply entry hazards for its team. Spikes is the main entry hazard on this set, as it sets Omastar apart from other physical walls, such as Rhydon and Steelix. Stealth Rock comes next as it makes it difficult for many of the threats Omastar checks to outlast it, since many are weak to Stealth Rock. Scald is Omastar's STAB move with the ever-infuriating 30% chance to burn the opponent. Ice Beam rounds off the set by giving Omastar a way to try and fend off Grass-types that try to come in on it.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Omastar's physical bulk in order to check the likes of Entei and Swellow more reliably. Although none of Omastar's abilities are particularly useful on this set, Shell Armor is the best one to use if only to take untimely critical hits out of the equation. Omastar does have access to Toxic Spikes, but the dual Spiker role is done better by Qwilfish thanks to its better set of resistances and Intimidate.</p> <p>This Omastar struggles to fend off most sleep inducers, especially Amoonguss, so having a way to combat sleep is highly recommended. Emboar and Choice Band Druddigon are great Sleep Talk users that handle most sleep inducers, including Lilligant, with ease. Bouffalant has Sap Sipper to benefit from Spore and Sleep Powder and its all around bulk lets it handle most sleep inducers as well. Phazers and Volt Switch and U-turn users are recommended to take advantage of the Spikes support Omastar provides. Steelix and specially defensive Druddigon are good phazers. Rotom-C, Braviary, and Manectric can all use Volt Switch or U-turn to force their checks and counters to take repeated Spikes damage. Spiritomb is a good teammate to protect Omastar's entry hazards as it can easily handle Cryogonal and Kabutops reliably, although a Spiritomb with Foul Play will be better equipped on average to handle Kabutops.</p> "

  "Kabutops": {
    "overview": "<p>In many senses of the word, Kabutops is at the pinnacle of RU. In a tier chock-full of hazard users, Rapid Spin users are coveted, and Kabutops is the best offensive user of the move available. Not only is Kabutops able to effectively beat every Ghost-type Pokemon in RU switching into it with proper execution, but its respectable offensive prowess provokes several Pokemon to switch out, giving it plenty of opportunities to use Rapid Spin. Kabutops's interesting Water / Rock typing, on top of granting it a STAB combination that is unresisted by most of the tier, provides useful resistances to Fire-, Normal-, and Flying-type attacks, making it capable of switching into common Pokemon such as Entei rather easily. Kabutops can also capitalize on these opportunities with moves such as Swords Dance, becoming a dangerous sweeper at the drop of a hat. Moreover, excellent abilities such as Weak Armor and Swift Swim allow Kabutops to mitigate its somewhat low base 80 Speed stat. Similarly, access to Aqua Jet further supports Kabutops's middling Speed, allowing it to check dangerous Pokemon such as Entei, Moltres, and Aerodactyl rather well.</p> <p>Of course, Kabutops is by no means without its faults. Common Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Tangrowth can wall Kabutops for extended periods of time without much trouble, and without a reasonable method of hitting fast Grass-types, Kabutops is susceptible to being taken advantage of by dangerous Pokemon such as Sceptile and Lilligant. What's more, weaknesses to common Electric-, Fighting-, and Ground-type attacks severely impede Kabutops's potency against more offensive teams. However, when all is said and done, Kabutops is an excellent Pokemon and should be considered for almost any team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Kabutops is very capable of taking advantage of its Swift Swim ability and serving as a dangerous rain sweeper, though it should be noted that it requires serious support to function. Similarly, a Rock Polish set can be utilized to boost Kabutops's Speed, though it usually is an inferior option to Rain Dance, only serving to prevent opposing rain teams from gaining advantage. Lastly, Kabutops's fairly unique typing, in addition to access to both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, makes a defensive set a possibility, though Kabutops is simply better off playing to its strengths rather than serving as a defensive Rapid Spin user, a task Cryogonal does far better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Kabutops's most prominent check is Poliwrath, which shrugs off all of its attacks without too much trouble and can either cripple it with a potential Scald burn or phaze it out with Circle Throw, dealing heavy damage in the process. Similarly, Quagsire is capable of handling Kabutops's attacks very well, negating any possible Swords Dance boosts with its Unaware ability and threatening Kabutops with STAB Earthquake. Defensive Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Ferroseed also handle Kabutops well, though Ferroseed needs to be wary of the stray Superpower. Bulky Pokemon such as Steelix and Aggron, despite being weak to Water-type attacks, take Kabutops lacking Waterfall and Superpower quite well, taking very little from Aqua Jet and being able to retaliate with a STAB Earthquake. Speedy Grass-types such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and Rotom-C can all switch in on everything but Stone Edge and Superpower without much trouble and threaten with their STAB moves. Fast Fighting- and Electric-types are capable of outpacing Kabutops and KOing it with their STAB attacks, though if they allow themselves to be worn down, they will fall victim to a powerful Aqua Jet. Rotom in particular is a very prominent example of an Electric-type, as it is also a Ghost-type, and thus is commonly found matched up against Kabutops.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Offensive Rapid Spin",
        "description": "<p>Kabutops's excellent offensive capabilities and movepool allow it to serve as an excellent user of Rapid Spin, capable of beating every conventional Ghost-type in the tier that attempts to switch into it. Stone Edge provides a high-powered STAB move, essential to allowing Kabutops to break through defensive Ghost-types such as Calm Mind Spiritomb and Dusknoir, as well as knocking out Pokemon such as Sceptile that try to switch into it and force it out. Aqua Jet is an excellent priority move for Kabutops to have access to, as it not only allows Kabutops to handle an assortment of weakened offensive Pokemon, but also always beats 4 HP Rotom after a Swords Dance after Stealth Rock damage when using Life Orb, preventing Rotom from being able to block Rapid Spin and threaten Kabutops with a powerful Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. As a result of situations like this, Swords Dance is also a very useful move on Kabutops, as it not only allows Kabutops the ability to effectively sweep later in a match, but also allows it to pressure every Ghost-type in the tier, being able to OHKO both Dusknoir and Spiritomb with Stone Edge, and OHKO Rotom with Aqua Jet after a boost with Stealth Rock damage. On the other hand, Waterfall provides Kabutops with a moderately powerful Water-type STAB move, allowing it to hit Fighting- and Steel-types moderately hard without dedicating Kabutops to a sweep, which is invaluable in early stages of a match.</p> <p>The choice between Life Orb and Lum Berry is hugely important to Kabutops and largely alters how it plays. Life Orb is technically the \"better item\" for Kabutops to wield purely due to its ability to hit Ghost-types for the extra damage needed to knock them out. Here are some damage calculations that demonstrate this:</p> <ul> <li>Stone Edge vs. 252/252+ Spiritomb 48.02 - 56.9% <li>+2 Stone Edge vs. 252/252 Spiritomb 96.05 - 113.15%</li> <li>Stone Edge vs. 252/104+ Dusknoir 47.61 - 56.12%</li> <li>+2 Stone Edge vs. 252/104 Dusknoir 94.21 - 111.56%</li> <li>+2 Aqua Jet vs. 4/0 Rotom 87.6 - 103.71%</li> </ul> <p>That being said, teams that absolutely require Rapid Spin support to function, including those with multiple hazard-weak Pokemon or Pokemon such as Moltres that can't function with Stealth Rock on the field, would appreciate Life Orb Kabutops more so than any alternative item choice. In contrast, Lum Berry offers Kabutops leniency in play. The ability to rid itself of status passively is invaluable in match-ups with more defensively based Pokemon, where Thunder Wave, Scald, and Will-O-Wisp are highly common. Moreover, whilst wielding Lum Berry, Kabutops becomes an effective response to Smeargle on offensive teams, being able to absorb a singular Spore, bring it down to its Focus Sash with either Stone Edge or Waterfall, and then proceeding to KO it with either Rapid Spin or Aqua Jet, preventing it from setting up any hazards or passing stat boosts at minimal cost to the team.</p> <p>While Aqua Jet is useful for more offensive threats, Waterfall can be utilized instead to increase Kabutops's effectiveness against slower teams, allowing it to hit Fighting- and Steel-types much better than it normally would. Though Weak Armor is often better suited for Kabutops, allowing it to switch into attacks such as Entei's Flare Blitz and obtain a Speed boost, Battle Armor grants it a safer ability for maintaining Kabutops's Defense. When using Battle Armor, a bulkier spread such as 120 HP / 252 Atk / 136 Spe with Leftovers should be given thought, increasing Kabutops's longevity and granting it more leniency in spinning hazards in exchange for sweeping capabilities. A Jolly nature can be used to good effect, allowing Kabutops to outpace a few notable targets, the most prominent being Modest Rotom-C, Smeargle, Adamant Gallade, and opposing Adamant Kabutops.</p> <p>Naturally, hazard-weak Pokemon make for respectable partners for this set, not only in that Kabutops keeps hazards off the field well, but also in that most Stealth Rock weak Pokemon lend themselves to supporting Kabutops well offensively, and vice-versa. Moltres, Pinsir, and Entei all make solid examples of this, with all three being able to threaten Pokemon like Tangrowth with their STAB moves who otherwise wall Kabutops quite aptly. Moltres is even capable of threatening Poliwrath, Kabutops's nemesis, with its powerful Hurricane. Moreover, as Pokemon such as Sceptile and Rotom-C are very capable of switching into everything in Kabutops's arsenal barring Stone Edge, having a respectable switch-in to Grass-types is always appreciated. Druddigon and Escavalier are both good examples of this, being able to shrug off most Grass-type Pokemon's conventional attacks and threatening them with powerful attacks off their own. Kabutops pairs very well with Fire- and Grass-types, as they collectively have excellent offensive and defensive synergy. Aside from the previously mentioned Entei and Moltres, Grass-types such as Sceptile and Rotom-C are very solid partners for Kabutops, being able to threaten bulky Water-types that trouble both Kabutops and its Fire-type partners with their STAB attacks, and also receiving the Scalds from these Water-types better than most.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>By abandoning the pretense of Rapid Spin, Kabutops is capable of serving as an incredibly potent and dangerous sweeper. Weak Armor compounds upon Kabutops's potency, allowing it to switch into common attacks such as Entei's Flare Blitz to grab a Speed boost, reaching a point where Pokemon such as Sceptile can no longer keep it in check. Stone Edge offers Kabutops a powerful STAB move, hitting Water-, Dragon-, and Grass-types hard and allowing Kabutops to better distinguish itself from similar Water-type sweepers such as Feraligatr. Aqua Jet makes up for Kabutops's lack of immediate Speed, allowing it to KO faster Pokemon such as Manectric and Primeape that would otherwise keep Kabutops under control. Waterfall offers a more powerful Water-type attack, allowing Kabutops to hit slower Fighting-types such as Hariyama for respectable damage, in addition to hitting Pokemon such as Steelix and Aggron hard.</p> <p>In terms of item choice, Life Orb's ability to procure critical damage on Pokemon is certainly appreciated, allowing Kabutops to take on Pokemon such as Druddigon, Steelix, and offensive Tangrowth with little more than Stealth Rock support after a Swords Dance. However, in a tier where status is so commonplace, Lum Berry is never a bad option on a sweeper such as Kabutops, and the leniency the item grants allows it a much easier time setting up. While Weak Armor's general usefulness is undeniable, Kabutops's other abilities have merit as well. Battle Armor is a useful \"safe\" ability, keeping Kabutops's Defense intact and removing certain elements of luck from the equation, whereas Swift Swim, in the context of a rain team, is by no extent bad and allows Kabutops to serve as an incredibly dangerous speedy sweeper. A Jolly nature is useful for outpacing Pokemon such as Adamant Gallade and Modest Rotom-C, though the loss in power becomes very evident when facing bulky Pokemon such as Druddigon and Steelix. Superpower is a viable attacking option, allowing Kabutops to hit Ferroseed hard as well as being Kabutops's best bet at damaging Poliwrath, though the Attack drop it ensues hurts its sweeping potential and should be used sparingly if possible.</p> <p>Kabutops appreciates partners capable of taking on bulkier Water- and Grass-types, Poliwrath, Tangrowth, and Ferroseed being the biggest issues, though faster Grass-types such as Sceptile and Lilligant are moderately threatening as well. Sigilyph is a very useful partner for removing Kabutops's defensive checks, being able to switch into the majority of their attacks with ease courtesy of Magic Guard negating damage from Leech Seed and Scald and threaten them with Psychic, Air Slash, or even Heat Wave. Similarly, Roselia can switch into the majority of Pokemon that threaten Kabutops, taking advantage of such Pokemon to set up Spikes that in turn make Kabutops's job of sweeping that much easier.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Kabutops is very capable of utilizing a Choice Band to overcome some of its more conventional checks and counters. Stone Edge offers a powerful STAB attack to hit hard with, even being able to 2HKO bulky Pokemon such as Tangrowth with Stealth Rock and Spikes on the field. Aqua Jet offers Kabutops a powerful priority attack, allowing it to revenge kill speedy Pokemon such as Aerodactyl with ease. Waterfall provides Kabutops with a more powerful Water-type STAB move, allowing it to hit slower Fighting-types hard. Superpower rounds off Kabutops's coverage, allowing it to hit Steel-types hard, punishing Ferroseed that would otherwise check Kabutops. This is also Kabutops's best bet at hitting Poliwrath, dealing respectable damage to it and forcing it to use Rest.</p> <p>Though Weak Armor is generally preferred for its ability to mitigate Kabutops's low base Speed and better fits the hit-and-run style of a Choice Band set, Battle Armor is perfectly viable for those wishing to preserve Kabutops's Defense. A Jolly nature can be used and allows Kabutops to outpace Adamant Gallade and opposing Adamant Kabutops as well as Modest Rotom-C, though otherwise Adamant's extra power is preferred. Rapid Spin, despite being generally ill-suited for a Choice set, still remains a very useful move overall and can be utilized over Waterfall to decent effect. However, it should be noted that this is not a very consistent method of keeping hazards off the field and should not be utilized over a more consistent Rapid Spin user if the team explicitly requires the removal of entry hazards to function.</p> <p>Entry hazard support, both Stealth Rock and Spikes ideally, are essential to guaranteeing certain KOs on Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Druddigon. Steelix, Druddigon, and Roselia all make reasonable examples of partners for such an end, being able to set up hazards on many Pokemon Kabutops attracts. Moreover, as Kabutops still struggles to play around bulky Water-types, Poliwrath in particular, partners that can exploit such opposing Pokemon are very helpful. Lilligant, Sceptile, and Substitute + Calm Mind Uxie are all excellent examples of this.</p> "

Aerodactyl is a great pivot for offensive teams thanks to its typing, which grants it resistances to common types such as Fire- and Normal-type attacks; it also has reliable recovery with Roost, so it can take advantage of any lull in a battle.</p> <p>The Rock / Flying typing is a double-edged sword because it leaves Aerodactyl vulnerable to common Water-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks. A weakness to Stealth Rock means that Aerodactyl will need support from its team to reach its full potential, otherwise Stealth Rock will be a constant annoyance by draining Aerodactyl's health. Aerodactyl's Speed and high offensive pressure makes it a fantastic presence on heavy offensive teams, but its utility on more defensive teams is a bit limited due to its frailty. Although, combining the power of a Life Orb or Choice Band wielder with the Speed of most Choice Scarf users is a beautiful thing to have. Finally, don't use Aerodactyl as a dedicated lead; its glory days as a DPP OU lead are far behind it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The options above are Aerodactyl's best sets, but Aerodactyl does have other attacks to surprise its opponents. Aerodactyl can try its hand at utilizing Hone Claws, which would definitely help with Stone Edge's accuracy, but its frail defenses will make it difficult to consistently set up. The combination of Power Herb and Sky Attack can surprise Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss, but it's a one-time use. Aerodactyl has all the elemental fangs at its disposal, but they all have paltry Base Power, and Fire Blast is better in every instance for its ability to take out Tangrowth and Steelix in addition to Ferroseed. Aerodactyl can utilize Sunny Day and Rain Dance with the respective weather Rock, which can work thanks to its high Speed and the ability to disrupt its opponent with Taunt. Toxic can be used to surprise some walls like Slowking and Quagsire that would otherwise force Aerodactyl out. Aerodactyl can utilize RestTalk in conjunction with Whirlwind or Roar, which gives it the ability to phaze very quickly with Sleep Talk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Aerodactyl is a bit difficult to beat because its high Speed means it will get two attacks on a switch-in before fainting, so a Pokemon that can consistently take a beating is your best bet to take it down. Tangrowth will be impossible for Aerodactyl to bypass if it lacks Fire Blast, and Tangrowth can use Sleep Powder, heal with Leech Seed or Synthesis, or simply wear down Aerodactyl with its attacks. Physically defensive Slowking will be very difficult for Aerodactyl, and the only way for Aerodactyl to take it down is to get a critical hit with Stone Edge. Slowking has a multitude of options to handle Aerodactyl with; Thunder Wave cuts Aerodactyl's Speed, Scald will KO, and Trick Room can be used to start a counter sweep with Slowking. Quagsire is a great choice to take down Aerodactyl with Recover and Scald. Choice Scarf Pokemon can be used to revenge kill Aerodactyl but you need to make sure that they are faster than Jolly Aerodactyl, otherwise it will be for naught. Choice Scarf users like Rotom or Lilligant are good choices because they can take out Aerodactyl quickly and can always reliably outspeed it. Priority is another method to take down Aerodactyl: Aqua Jet from the likes of Kabutops, Feraligatr, and Carracosta can quickly take care of Aerodactyl. Sucker Punch from Pokemon such as Spiritomb and Absol is another choice to take out a weakened Aerodactyl, but they need to be careful Aerodactyl doesn't use Roost.</p> ",

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<p>This set combines all of Aerodactyl's positive traits to maximize its potential. With its high Speed, Aerodactyl can act as a backup revenge killer for offensive teams that cannot afford to have an additional Choice Scarf user. Slower, defensive teams enjoy Aerodactyl because it's a non-Choice item revenge killer, and can break down stall that lacks its counters. Aerodactyl's Speed is so great that it can even outspeed some Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Emboar and Braviary. Thanks to its typing, Aerodactyl can switch into them directly, although it must be careful of coverage attacks. Aerodactyl's function on an offensive team is to wallbreak and act as a pivot that can switch into Fire-types like Moltres and Entei and outspeed them while threatening to hit them with Stone Edge. This variant of Aerodactyl is self-sufficient, barring its Stealth Rock weakness, because it can take down its own counters with Fire Blast.</p> <p>Stone Edge is Aerodactyl's strongest Rock-type STAB, but it has shaky accuracy. Earthquake is a strong attack with great coverage to hit grounded Fire- or Poison-type Pokemon such as Entei or Drapion without relying on Stone Edge's accuracy. Fire Blast is used to take down the Pokemon that could otherwise withstand Aerodactyl's attacks, particularly Ferroseed, Tangrowth, and Steelix. Fire Blast 2HKOes the mentioned counters, and with the given EVs always OHKOes Escavalier and Durant. Double-Edge is a great alternative neutral attack that takes advantage of Rock Head and offers a perfectly accurate attack for Aerodactyl. Roost finalizes the set by granting Aerodactyl reliable recovery to mitigate damage upon switching in and Life Orb recoil.</p> <p>The suggested EVs maximize Aerodactyl's Speed and allow it to outspeed opposing Swellow, Sceptile, and Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Emboar and Braviary. The 36 Special Attack EVs are to guarantee the OHKO on Escavalier with Fire Blast. A Hasty nature is needed with Fire Blast, whereas Jolly is better with Double-Edge. If Double-Edge is used, then the 36 Special Attack EVs should be allocated to Attack. If outspeeding Swellow and the mentioned Choice Scarf users is not a concern, then the Speed EVs can be reduced to 176, which still allows it to outspeed Sceptile, and the rest can go into HP to garner a minimal increase in bulk. If a Stealth Rock user is needed, then Aerodactyl can fulfill that role thanks to its high Speed; however, with Stealth Rock Aerodactyl will either not be able to take down its counters, or its longevity will be severely shortened. Taunt is another great choice for its ability to shut down defensive Pokemon or Pokemon looking to set up on Aerodactyl. Rock Slide is a potential replacement for Stone Edge thanks to its greater accuracy and flinch rate, but is a weaker alternative and is only considered because of Aerodactyl's speed. Aqua Tail is an option if Rhydon, Crustle, and Sandslash are problems for your team, but it has no use outside hitting these Pokemon. Aerial Ace allows Aerodactyl to 2HKO Poliwrath, who would otherwise counter it, with entry hazard support, and also allows it to revenge kill Gallade. If Aerodactyl is purely going to be used as a lead, then Focus Sash is an option alongside Stealth Rock and Taunt, but this choice wastes Aerodactyl's talents.</p> <p>Aerodactyl is meant to be on an offensively-oriented team, so its optimal partners are those that can take advantage of Aerodactyl's ability to take down its own counters, and have good type and offensive synergy. Partners that can utilize Aerodactyl's removal of Grass-types via Fire Blast are great. Kabutops has a hard time taking down Ferroseed and Tangrowth, and it will have a much easier time with them gone. Kabutops can also spin for Aerodactyl, so Stealth Rock will not be a problem. Similarly, Feraligatr likes Ferroseed and Tangrowth gone, so that it can sweep with Dragon Dance or Swords Dance. Cinccino is a partner that likes having Steelix removed and can bring Aerodactyl in with U-turn. Offensive Grass-type Pokemon don't mind switching into bulky Water-types like Slowking and Poliwrath and can threaten them out. Lilligant, Rotom-C, and offensive Tangrowth are a few partners that don't mind switching into a Thunder Wave or Scald. In return, Aerodactyl can take Fire-type attacks or common priority attacks, such as Extreme Speed, aimed at them.</p> <p>As alluded to earlier, Stealth Rock reduces Aerodactyl's ability to switch in repeatedly, so a Rapid Spin user is a great partner. Kabutops is a great partner that likes the removal of Grass-types, and it can take down Choice Scarf Pokemon with Aqua Jet that are looking to take out Aerodactyl, although Kabutops and Aerodactyl have no notable type synergy apart from Aerodactyl's immunity to Ground. Cryogonal is another option for its ability to switch into specially oriented threats like Amoonguss, and it can Toxic bulky Water-types. Because all the Pokemon that can handle Aerodactyl are grounded, Aerodactyl really appreciates entry hazard support. Smeargle and Scolipede are good Spikes users that can quickly set them up for heavy offensive teams. Qwilfish and Crustle are also good choices for Pokemon that can fulfill more roles than purely setting up Spikes, and they benefit more on balanced offensive teams.</p> <p>Traditionally, it's hard to counter Aerodactyl because some of its counters are taken out with Fire Blast, and with its high Speed it's very difficult to stop Stealth Rock from going up. Additionally, Taunt cannot be countered outside of Magic Bounce. To beat this variant of Aerodactyl, it is necessary to KO it before it becomes a problem. Choice Scarf Pokemon like Rotom-C or Manectric can switch into Aerodactyl, although Manectric needs to be more careful when it switches in, and put Aerodactyl in a difficult position where they can severely damage it with their Electric-type STAB or use Volt Switch to maintain momentum. Bulky Water-types can minimize the damage that Aerodactyl causes. Poliwrath is a great Pokemon, if Aerodactyl doesn't have Aerial Ace, and can phaze Aerodactyl with Circle Throw or burn it with Scald. Qwilfish can switch in with Intimidate, but needs to tread lightly to avoid Earthquake. Physically defensive Slowking can use Thunder Wave, Scald, or Trick Room to take down Aerodactyl.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>This set is more singular in focus, and can attack while switching in with minimal damage taken. In addition, team support is crucial to this set's success, due to Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness and frail defenses. The hit-and-run attitude of this set emphasizes smart prediction and switching; it is best to switch Aerodactyl into Ground-type, weak neutral, or resisted attacks. This set works differently than other Choice Band users thanks to Aerodactyl's high Speed, which lets it almost always attack first, and its useful resistances.</p> <p>Stone Edge is Aerodactyl's strongest Rock-type STAB. Earthquake is a great neutral attack to hit threats like Entei, Qwilfish, and Aggron, although you must exercise caution, as Levitate or Flying-type Pokemon can capitalize on Earthquake. Aqua Tail rounds out Aerodactyl's coverage by hitting Ground-types such as Rhydon, which would otherwise be major annoyances. Double-Edge provides great neutral coverage and is a great fall-back for Aerodactyl due to its perfect accuracy, and it also takes advantage of Rock Head.</p> <p>The suggested EVs maximize Aerodactyl's damage output, and a Jolly nature takes advantage of Aerodactyl's high Speed. Maximizing Aerodactyl's Speed is important because it can outspeed Swellow and certain Choice Scarf Pokemon, such as Emboar and Braviary. If outspeeding the mentioned Pokemon is of no concern, then dropping the Speed EVs to 176 still outspeeds Sceptile, and the rest can go into HP for a little additional bulk. Rock Head is the preferred ability thanks to its ability to neutralize Double-Edge's recoil.</p> <p>This set works best on offensively-geared teams due to its frailness and dangerous playstyle. Also, courtesy of its Speed, Aerodactyl can act as a secondary revenge killer for offensive teams, revenge killing threats like Dragon Dance Feraligatr and Choice Scarf Medicham. Caution needs to be taken when using this set due to Aerodactyl's frailty and Stealth Rock weakness. The power given by Choice Band allows Aerodactyl to achieve KOs that it wouldn't otherwise get, such as the 2HKO on defensive Amoonguss and the OHKO on Lilligant after Stealth Rock. This set needs a partner with good offensive synergy that can take down Aerodactyl's counters. Mixed Druddigon fits the bill perfectly thanks to its ability to lure out Ferroseed and Tangrowth with its physical Dragon-type STAB and hit them with a Flamethrower, and Outrage will severely hurt any bulky Water-types. Another good partner is Bouffalant for its ability to switch into Grass-type attacks with Sap Sipper and set up a Substitute and Swords Dance, or form a one-two combo by also utilizing Choice Band. Rotom-C is another great partner to have because it can take down bulky Water-types with either its Grass- or Electric-type STAB, and can help weaken the opposing team with Volt Switch and keep momentum on your side. Rotom-C can also utilize Will-O-Wisp, so Aerodactyl can have an easier time switching into physical attackers. Rotom-C has trouble with Grass-type Pokemon and so does Aerodactyl, but Rotom-C can take out problematic Pokemon like Ferroseed with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>Due to the constant switching of a Choice Band set and Aerodactyl's Stealth Rock weakness, a Rapid Spin user is imperative to the success of this set. Kabutops is a good spinner and applies offensive pressure. Cryogonal is another good spinner, and it can switch into special threats like Slowking and use Toxic. This set is a bit more difficult to directly counter due to the higher damage output from Choice Band, but Pokemon that can easily survive Aerodactyl's attacks are Tangrowth, Ferroseed, and Torterra; however, they all need to keep an eye out for Fire Blast or a partner that is specially designed to take out Grass-type Pokemon. Bulky Water-types can also minimize the damage caused by Aerodactyl. Qwilfish with Intimidate is a great buffer to hold back Aerodactyl as long as it avoids Earthquake. Poliwrath can take Aerodactyl's attacks all day and burn it with Scald or phaze it out with Circle Throw. Physically defensive Slowking can take some assaults and has a multitude of options to retaliate with; it can attack with Scald, paralyze with Thunder Wave, or use Trick Room and flip everything on its head. Quagsire is another great switch-in and has reliable recovery, and in return can burn Aerodactyl with Scald. The best way to contain this set is to predict its attacks beforehand and capitalize on them, because constant switching will eventually take its toll on Aerodactyl with its subpar defenses and Stealth Rock weakness.</p> "

  "Dragonair": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonair boasts an incredible typing for play in the RU tier, which, when combined with its great Eviolite-boosted defenses, amazing abilities, and solid movepool, makes it a great candidate for a spot on offensive balanced and semistall teams. Marvel Scale and Shed Skin are what make Dragonair so potent, as they both immensely aid in setting up. Dragonair's niche in RU is as a bulky Dragon Dance sweeper; straight offensive sets are largely outclassed by Druddigon, which features amazing power without setup, and Fraxure, which is only marginally slower but much more powerful after a single boost. Dragonair's bulky Dragon Dance set is amazing though, with its only major weakness coming from its tendency to get ruined by critical hits. If you're looking for a fun Pokemon to use and can provide Magneton support to remove Steel-types, Dragonair should not disappoint.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast can be used over Sleep Talk on the bulky Dragon Dance set if Shed Skin is used. This helps it destroy many of the Steel-types in the tier, though it's not quite powerful enough without a lot of Special Attack investment. Dragon Tail is also usable, especially when supported by a lot of entry hazards, but Dragonair should focus on sweeping. Thunder Wave is about the only other option that could be considered usable on the bulky set, though it's extremely outclassed by other moves.</p> <p>An offensive Dragon Dance set with Life Orb as the item and Extreme Speed and Waterfall as coverage is usable, but while it's slightly faster than Fraxure and has priority, it's much weaker and can't secure a sweep at +1 like Fraxure can. Finally, a special attacking set is possible, but the power is laughable and outclassed by Altaria.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Every Steel-type in RU is a counter to Dragonair, as the only thing most have to worry about are Waterfall and the very rare Fire Blast. However, the Steel-types should be wary about the nearly-guaranteed Magneton that will be paired with Dragonair. Druddigon easily OHKOes Dragonair with Outrage, though it can only risk coming in when Dragonair is sleeping, as otherwise it'll be OHKOed in return. Very strong physical attackers that can 2HKO Dragonair while it's sleeping and can tank a possible Outrage also work well. Examples include Tauros, Kangaskhan, Medicham, Durant, Kabutops, and Hitmonlee. Phazing Pokemon, like Roar Steelix and Circle Throw Poliwrath, also completely nullify Dragonair's efforts, unless it's the last Pokemon. Clear Smog Amoonguss completely neuters Dragonair, even if it's the last Pokemon standing. Finally, other setup sweepers can take advantage of the turns Dragonair is asleep. Those that are bulky enough to tank a possible Outrage work best, which includes Pokemon like Nasty Plot Slowking, SubCM Mesprit, and Bulk Up Gallade.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With Eviolite, Dragonair is a very bulky and dangerous setup sweeper that can come in either mid-game to wallbreak or late-game to sweep the opponent. Dragonair easily sets up on weak defensive Pokemon and Pokemon often found in Fire / Water / Grass cores, even if they have Ice Beam, such as Lanturn, Slowking, Qwilfish, Uxie, Rotom-C, Roselia, Magmortar, Typhlosion, Sceptile, and Clefable, as well as some offensive Pokemon like Galvantula, Manectric, Lilligant, and Mesprit. Thanks to RestTalk (which lets it absorb sleep from the likes of Lilligant and Amoonguss) keeping it healthy and Marvel Scale boosting its Defense, Dragonair actually benefits from status and is meant to set up while it's afflicted with status. Dragonair can even sweep an entire team while it simply cycles between Rest and Sleep Talk, and sometimes it's even advantageous to do so thanks to the protection from priority Marvel Scale provides and the fact that Sleep Talk bypasses Sucker Punch. However, it's usually best to save Dragonair for mid- to late-game to begin a sweep. Outrage is the sole attacking move on the set, as Dragon is a very good attacking type in RU, and it's easy enough to eliminate the Steel-types from an opponent's team with Magneton support. Caution should be taken with using Outrage all willy-nilly though, and it should only really be used when the sweep is secured, otherwise confusion could cut Dragonair's sweep short.</p> <p>A specially defensive EV spread takes advantage of both Dragonair's typing and the fact that Marvel Scale will often be boosting its Defense anyway. Marvel Scale is what makes this set work as well as it does, since the boosted Defense lets Dragonair set up on physical attackers it normally wouldn't be able to such as Spiritomb, Hitmonchan, defensive Crustle, and Entei. However, Shed Skin is still viable and can be used to increase the speed with which Dragonair can set up and sweep. If used, Sleep Talk should be replaced with Waterfall or Extreme Speed. Shed Skin is more recommended for more offensive sets, though.</p> <p>Magneton support is highly, highly recommended to make this set work. Choice Specs Magneton in particular works phenomenally well to remove the Steel-types from the opponent's team. With the Steel-types gone, particularly the defensive brutes like Steelix, Aggron, and Escavalier, Dragonair has a much easier time sweeping with Outrage. Specs Magneton also has the power to weaken or eliminate other physically defensive walls like Tangrowth, Alomomola, and Poliwrath. Entry hazard support is also extremely helpful in Dragonair's case, as it lowers the amount of times it needs to set up with Dragon Dance to secure a sweep and also pushes some opponents into KO range of Magneton's attacks. However, if the setup opportunity arises, Dragonair can take the time to set up to +6, so entry hazard support isn't mandatory for it to work.</p> <p>Another Dragon-type teammate to ensure Steel-types are out of the way, like Druddigon or Fraxure, is also recommended and can put a ton of offensive pressure on the opponent. Dragon Dance Fraxure works particularly well if Dragonair is used mid-game. Really strong physical attackers like Tauros, Hitmonlee, Medicham, Druddigon, Swords Dance Absol, and Kabutops can pose a threat to Dragonair, especially if it's sleeping and Sleep Talk doesn't select the right move for it. These kinds of threats need to be removed or a setup opportunity for Dragonair needs to be created before they can come in to ensure it can outspeed them. Ghost-types like Rotom can help with the Normal- and Fighting-types, and Steel-types like Magneton work well to weaken or remove Druddigon, Absol, and Kabutops. Finally, Dragonair is very prone to getting ruined by critical hits as it sets up, so a back-up plan is always needed. Knowing precisely when a good time to start sweeping is also needed to reduce the chance of this happening; should Dragonair be at +3, +4, +6? Damage calculations help in this endeavor.</p> "

  "Lanturn": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Lanturn lacks any appealing stats outside of its HP, its rare Water / Electric typing gives it many useful resistances and, combined with its ability Volt Absorb, allows it to check many prominent threats such as Omastar, Manectric, Jynx, and most importantly Moltres. Lanturn stands out as the best counter to Moltres in RU, as it resists both of its STABs and can also tank its hits reasonably well thanks to its excellent HP stat. Lanturn also has access to useful utility moves, such as Volt Switch, Heal Bell, and Thunder Wave, giving it some excellent options to support its team. Lanturn's ultimate downfall, however, is its lack of reliable recovery. Due to this, constant damage from attacks and entry hazards will easily take their toll on it. Lanturn is also fairly weak offensively; its middling base 76 Special Attack isn't remarkably strong, which means Lanturn can sometimes be setup fodder for dangerous threats, particularly Sceptile and Lilligant. Lanturn's middling physical bulk also leaves it vulnerable to powerful physical attacks in the tier. Despite this, Lanturn holds a strong niche in RU as a great special tank and pivot.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lanturn has a number of other options at its disposal that it can make use of. It can use Charge Beam alongside Substitute to steadily boost its middling Special Attack to formidable levels. Rain Dance is usable, and allows Lanturn to hit hard with Surf and Thunder, but is only useful on dedicated rain teams. It can run Confuse Ray alongside Thunder Wave to perform the parafusion strategy; however, this is often seen as a gimmick, and is outdone by Liepard thanks to Prankster. It can also run Aqua Ring to give it a decent form of recovery alongside Leftovers. Lanturn has access to Signal Beam to handle Grass- and Psychic-types. Agility is a notable move to boost Lanturn's Speed and allow it to sweep teams. Finally, Brine is also a decent option to deal heavy damage to weakened opponents, but the move is very situational.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Grass-types such as Roselia, Sceptile, and Lilligant are notable, as they can come in on most of Lanturn's moves and hit it back hard. Substitute users can use Lanturn as setup fodder due to its low damage output. Strong physical attackers such as Cinccino, Druddigon, and Escavalier can do heavy damage to Lanturn, as its Defense is rather lackluster. Guts or Toxic Boost users such as Hariyama, Zangoose, and Gurdurr can avoid Thunder Wave and hit it extremely hard. Due to Lanturn's lack of reliable recovery, constant pressure will make it easier to eliminate from the match. Finally, Earthquake users such as Golurk, Archeops, and Scolipede can deal large amounts of damage to Lanturn.</p> ",

It is able to check many of the prominent special threats in RU, such as Moltres, Omastar, and Manectric. Scald is a great move, as its burn chance allows Lanturn to weaken physical attackers that try to come in on it. Volt Switch lets Lanturn switch out of Grass-types and default to a proper teammate. Thunder Wave can paralyze fast Pokemon such as Accelgor and Sceptile, making them ineffective for the rest of the match. Toxic, however, allows Lanturn to wear down bulkier Pokemon like Druddigon and Slowking. Protect allows Lanturn to scout moves and gain Leftovers recovery; and works well with Toxic. Heal Bell is another invaluable support move in Lanturn's arsenal, allowing it to cure the team and itself from status.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows Lanturn to avoid being 2HKOed by Moltres's Hidden Power Grass, while still being able to check Entei and Emboar relatively well. A Calm nature is chosen to maximize special bulk to make checking Moltres easier. Volt Absorb allows Lanturn to come in on Galvantula and Manectric, while giving it some form of recovery outside of Leftovers. RestTalk is usable to provide Lanturn some form of recovery, and can repeatedly check Moltres. This is, however, quite situational otherwise. Ice Beam could also be used to hit Druddigon and Grass-types, but Lanturn is too weak most of the time anyways.</p> <p>Spikes support is useful because of the numerous switches Lanturn forces; Ferroseed, Roselia, and Scolipede are all viable options for Spikers and handling opposing Grass-types. Scyther can be a decent teammate, as it can handle opposing Grass-types, and has U-turn to form a VoltTurn core with Lanturn. Emboar and Entei are excellent choices to handle Grass-types as well. Clefable and Alomomola are good teammates to pass Wishes to Lanturn due to its lack of recovery. Finally, Cryogonal is a great choice to remove entry hazards to prevent Lanturn from being repeatedly worn down. Cryogonal can also handle Grass-types decently for Lanturn, while Lanturn resists Fire-type moves in return.</p> "

Its bulk and typing allow it to come in on a number of special threats, Moltres in particular, and proceed to fire off reasonably powerful attacks. Its ability also allows it a form of recovery by switching into Galvantula and Manectric, which is useful to keep Lanturn healthy. Even though Lanturn's power can still be a bit lacking, it is bulky enough to use its moves multiple times. Lanturn's main advantage over Slowking in this role is its Electric typing, which grants it a good STAB to use against opposing bulky Water-types.</p> <p>Volt Switch is the most notable move in Lanturn's arsenal, allowing it to switch out to other teammates while grabbing momentum. Hydro Pump is a solid STAB move, packing great power while pummeling Steelix and Rhydon hoping to absorb a Volt Switch. Surf is usable for its accuracy, but the loss in power is noticeable though. Thunderbolt serves as a powerful and reliable move to hit opposing Water-types hard. Ice Beam rounds out the coverage, providing Lanturn with a weapon against opposing Grass-types and Druddigon.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Lanturn's power and bulk, and allows it to outpace maximum speed Adamant Aggron. Choice Specs and Life Orb provide the needed power boosts to Lanturn's middling Special Attack stat, allowing it to deal more damage. Volt Absorb allows Lanturn to check Galvantula and Manectric, and provides it a source of recovery. Expert Belt is a good alternative over Choice Specs or Life Orb due to Lanturn's good coverage, although the loss in power against neutral targets is noticeable.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is very useful to help Lanturn achieve needed KOs. Roselia and Scolipede are both viable options as they can keep opposing Grass-types at bay. Scyther synergizes very well with Lanturn, as it can handle Grass-types, while Lanturn can cover many of Scyther's weaknesses rather well. The two of them can also form a VoltTurn core to maintain pressure on the opponent. Finally, Entei or Emboar are especially useful to be able to handle opposing Grass-types.</p> "

But in BW it got two huge gifts: Eviolite and Magic Bounce. Although it is still outclassed by Xatu, it doesn't have to worry about it because the big bird is in UU, giving Natu a chance to shine in RU. With an incredible ability, good bulk, and reliable healing in Roost, it helps the team in many ways. However, Natu does have its drawbacks. Horrendous offensive stats mean that Natu will often become set-up bait. Natu also has a Pursuit weakness, and while Reflect somewhat mitigates this, it still gives the little bird trouble. Finally, while Natu can be quite bulky on either side, it cannot be both due to its low HP stat, and must choose to invest in either physical or special bulk.</p> ",

Also, as emphasized earlier, Natu's typing is more suited for taking physical hits. Night Shade, Haze, and Trick Room are all viable options for Natu. Night Shade can be used over U-turn to deal consistent damage and break Substitutes from Pokemon that could set up on you before. Haze can be used to stop stat boosters, and Trick Room can be used to support slower sweepers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Natu doesn't have many straight-up counters because its main job is bouncing back hazards and then switching out. Your best bet against Natu is to use faster Pokemon with Substitute or Pokemon that don't mind the status move that Natu carries. Strong Ice, Ghost, Dark, and Electric attacks from the special side will also put a huge dent in Natu. Manectric deserves a special mention, as it is immune to Thunder Wave, doesn't mind Toxic if it has a Choice item, and scouts the switch-in with Volt Switch.

Also, with its 4x resistance to Fighting, and immunity to Ground, Natu is a very nice defensive pivot that helps your team take on all the Choice item-utilizing Fighting-types in RU, such as Medicham, Primeape, and Hitmonlee.</p> <p>Roost is Natu's most important move, as it keeps it healthy throughout the match, and also lets it stall out slower threats using Electric, Ice, and Rock attacks. For example, Regirock, who commonly runs Stealth Rock, cannot OHKO Natu with its Rock attacks, so Natu can switch in, take the first hit, and then slowly recover back. Reflect lets Natu survive the onslaught from Pursuit trappers, such as Spiritomb and Absol. In the third slot, a status move is chosen so that Natu can do something besides reflect non-attacking moves. Thunder Wave neuters common switch-ins to Natu, like speedy Electric-types, and is better for annoying offensive teams, while Toxic hits every Pursuit user in RU and is better for pestering stall and balanced teams. Finally, U-turn is chosen for the last slot to help the team gain momentum, and escape Pursuit users if Reflect is not up.</p> <p>The EVs are put into HP and Defense to maximize Natu's physical bulk, since most of the hazard setters are physical and Natu is best suited as a physical wall. 248 HP EVs ensure that Natu is able to survive four switch-ins with Stealth Rock in play (if the opponent manages to get it up).</p> <p>Wish can be used with Protect (or Roost but then you rely only on U-turn to stop Pursuit trappers) over Roost and Reflect if you want to provide your team with some healing, and Toxic-stall better. Take note, though, that Natu is already set-up bait, so use Protect wisely. You can run a spread of 248 HP / 136 Def / 80 SpD / 44 Spe with a Bold nature if you want to survive two Bug Buzzes from Lead Accelgor, preventing him for setting up Spikes. You can also run a spread of 248 HP / 164 Def / 96 Spe with a Bold nature to outspeed max Speed, neutral natured base 50s. Natu will always have trouble with special Ice, Electric, Dark, and Ghost moves, so teammates that can take those attacks are helpful, especially Magneton, Steelix, and Drapion.

Quagsire is largely outclassed by other bulky Water-types, such as Slowking, Alomomola, and Poliwrath, due to their superior typing and supportive capabilities. Moreover, Quagsire's mediocre defenses often leave it 2HKOed by a vast array of neutral STABs, such as Medicham's High Jump Kick and Druddigon's Outrage. However, it does have one saving grace: its ability Unaware.

Keep in mind, though, that while Quagsire can work in the right situations, its walling capabilities are far too specific to be considered for most teams. When deciding on a bulky Water-type, there are plenty of other options to consider over Quagsire.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Water Absorb is a great ability, as it allows Quagsire to counter Kabutops; however, Quagsire relies on Unaware to establish a niche in RU, so Water Absorb is generally not recommenced. Ice Punch can be used to hit Grass-types on the switch, but it's too weak to warrant much use. Stone Edge can be used to OHKO Moltres and Scyther. Due to Unaware ignoring Attack boosts, Swagger can be used to annoy the opponent. Quagsire often finds itself 2HKOed by quite a few physical attackers, so it can utilize Counter to get a surprise KO on Pokemon such as Medicham. Curse can be used in an attempt to sweep, though this version of Quagsire is prone to luring in Toxic and Scald users. Protect can do a few things: help Quagsire Toxic stall (especially when entry hazards are down), accumulate Leftovers recovery, and scout the moves of its opponent. Finally, Stockpile boosts both of Quagsire's defenses, which can make it impenetrable after a few boosts should the opponent lack strong Grass-type attacks or Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Grass-types have no difficulty inflicting large amounts of damage on Quagsire. Sceptile, Lilligant, and even Ferroseed can use Quagsire as setup bait. Although, all three must be wary of Encore. Amoonguss and Roselia are solid defensive Grass-types that counter Quagsire, as their immunity to Toxic and great bulk prevents it from harming them. Speaking of Toxic, the status move can render Quagsire almost useless, as it will greatly deteriorate Quagsire's walling capabilities. Magic Guard Pokemon, such as Clefable and Sigilyph, do not care about anything Quagsire can do and can either set up on it, should it lack Encore, or inflict heavy damage. A lot of physical attackers have difficulty switching in on Quagsire due to Scald; however, Hariyama isn't one of them, as it can take advantage of the Scald-inflicted burn to acquire a Guts boost and destroy Quagsire with Close Combat. Medicham and Escavalier are both powerful enough to plow right through Quagsire, though they won't enjoy a burn.

Toxic works exceptionally well with Recover, as the combination gives Quagsire the opportunity to outstall a plethora of defensive Pokemon such as Slowking and Uxie. Alternatively, Encore works well by snatching momentum away from setup sweepers and team supporters who attempt to set up on Quagsire. Encore also helps stop Lilligant and Sceptile from boosting, forces entry hazard users into using Stealth Rock repeatedly, and potentially limits dual screens users, such as Uxie, to one screen.</p> <p>Quagsire can make use of a few other moves to use in the final slot. Ice Beam can be used to dent Grass-type switch-ins, Druddigon, and offensive Sigilyph. Yawn can also prove to be useful, functioning as a phazing move, though it can sometimes interfere with Scald. Quagsire can also opt for a specially defensive spread so that it can beat Calm Mind users with greater ease; however, it's best to use Quagsire to wall physical attackers, not special attackers.</p> <p>Quagsire often lures in Grass-types, and as such, Sap Sipper Pokemon, such as Miltank and Bouffalant, make great partners for their ability to absorb these threats' STAB moves.

Ironically, Quagsire can even work well with Grass-types themselves. Amoonguss is useful for its ability to cover Quagsire's Grass-type weakness, while Roselia can set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes to help Quagsire stall. Defensive Steel-types, such as Magneton, work quite well with Quagsire too, as they can take Grass-type moves aimed at it and it can sponge the Fire-type attacks that they loathe. Status afflictions severely cripple Quagsire, as it will be unable to stay in and repeatedly tank hits.

With Insomnia and its ability to outpace all common sleep inducers with full Speed investment, Murkrow can take an offensive approach, with access to two great STAB moves in Brave Bird and Sucker Punch as well as a great coverage move in Heat Wave. However, most defensive Murkrow sets are virtually powerless against dangerous Steel-types such as Escavalier, Aggron, and Durant, while offensive variants have an incredibly difficult time switching in. Murkrow has some serious flaws, but as long as you focus on utilizing its unique abilities to let it shine, it can surprise quite a few opponents with its effectiveness.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Murkrow has a surprisingly wide movepool, so there are certainly some options that can be considered. Murkrow can use a combination of Thunder Wave and Confuse Ray to make an annoying but inconsistent parafusion set. Murkrow's only boosting move is Calm Mind, but it's much too frail to try to sweep. Haze is a neat support option to put a fast stop to most sweepers, but Thunder Wave will usually suffice for this. Murkrow can utilize Perish Song and Mean Look together, but this takes two turns just to set up and Gothorita can enter the battlefield and trap what it wants without taking up any moveslots or extra turns. Murkrow can use Rain Dance or Sunny Day with the appropriate weather item, but Uxie, Volbeat, and Whimsicott are much better weather setters. Uxie and Whimsicott have access to Memento and U-turn to bring in weather sweepers safely, while Volbeat has Prankster Encore to force defensive Pokemon into useless moves to allow weather sweepers to come in. Night Shade can be used for consistent damage, but Foul Play is usually good enough. Mirror Move, Torment, and Whirlwind are extremely situational moves that Murkrow has access to, but they are generally outclassed by other moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Murkrow isn't the easiest thing to counter as its sets play extremely differently from each other, but Aggron is one of the safest responses to it. Outside of the rare Hidden Power Ground, Aggron can come in on virtually any move Murkrow commonly uses and nuke something with a powerful Head Smash. In general, hard-hitting attackers that can either outspeed Murkrow or tank a hit fare well against it. Druddigon, Occa Berry Escavalier, and Tauros don't fear a lot and can use their powerful STAB moves to overwhelm either set. Magneton 4x resists Brave Bird, resists Sucker Punch, can stomach a Heat Wave, and can retaliate with a powerful STAB Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. It's also immune to Toxic from the stallbreaker set. Alomomola only fears Toxic and Hidden Power Grass from the mixed attacker set, and can scout the set with Protect and switch out to a more favorable response if need be. Aerodactyl can come in on Brave Bird and use Roost on the forced Sucker Punch, but it must be wary of Thunder Wave. Regirock isn't common, but it has great mixed defenses to take on the mixed attacker set and has Clear Body to deal with the stallbreaker set if Murkrow tries to be cute with FeatherDance. Piloswine is even rarer than Regirock, but it destroys Murkrow thanks to Thick Fat negating its weakness to Heat Wave and its Eviolite-boosted defenses.</p> <p>The stallbreaker set is crippled by any Trick user, as losing its Eviolite means disaster. Most Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon can beat the stallbreaker set as well, but note that more defensive ones such as Steelix and Ferroseed can be effectively stalled out thanks to Gyro Ball's low PP. The mixed attacker set can be revenge killed by virtually anything that can survive or navigate around Sucker Punch. Durant, Sceptile, Manectric, Choice Scarf Emboar, and Choice Scarf Rotom-C can successfully handle Sucker Punch. However, none of them can switch in reliably and only Rotom-C can reliably take on the stallbreaker set. Status conditions, especially burns, can cripple either set and turn the mixed attacker into a liability if it doesn't run Dark Pulse. However, Prankster Taunt from the stallbreaker set can make this approach a bit more challenging than it might seem.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>With 85 / 85 offenses, Murkrow might not seem like a great mixed attacker, but its expansive movepool allows it to fill the role quite well. The biggest keys to this set lie in Insomnia and Murkrow's base 91 Speed, which lets it outpace every common sleep inducer in the tier. Brave Bird is Murkrow's primary STAB move; with 120 Base Power and a STAB boost, it hits with more than enough force to seriously dent and KO what it needs to. Sucker Punch is a nice secondary STAB move that allows Murkrow to derail the plans of opposing revenge killers while also hitting faster Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Rotom and Sigilyph. Heat Wave provides Murkrow with much-needed coverage and allows it to hammer Escavalier, Ferroseed, and most Steel-types in general. Hidden Power Grass fills in the last slot to handle the likes of Rhydon, Alomomola, and Quagsire.</p> <p>Speed is maximized as Murkrow sits just above one of the more important Speed benchmarks in RU: the base 90 Speed crowd, which includes Lilligant and Moltres. 16 Special Attack EVs are needed to ensure that Alomomola is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. The remaining EVs are thrown into Attack to juice up the power of Murkrow's STAB moves. There are some alternatives to Hidden Power Grass if you have the targets of the move covered on your team. Hidden Power Ground is a noteworthy option, if only to deal with Aggron before it KOes Murkrow or a teammate attempting to cover for it. Prankster in conjunction with Thunder Wave or Tailwind can be very useful should Murkrow not be of much use. A quick Thunder Wave can save your team from a game-ending sweep whereas Tailwind can let a slower teammate such as Gallade, Samurott, or Medicham easily clean up the opposing team with a temporary +2 boost to its Speed. If Hidden Power Grass is replaced by any of these moves, you should simply maximize Attack and leave 4 EVs in Special Attack. Dark Pulse is an alternative STAB option that makes Murkrow less vulnerable to burns and gives it an easier time with Rotom. Finally, Expert Belt is an option as Murkrow gains nice super effective coverage in RU, and the lack of Life Orb recoil can sometimes keep it around for an extra turn or two when it's forced to use Brave Bird a lot.</p> <p>Stealth Rock support is necessary to secure the OHKO on Moltres with Brave Bird and Escavalier with Heat Wave. Uxie is a great option for this as it can use Yawn and U-turn to give Murkrow easy opportunities to switch in. Murkrow has very good coverage against common defensive cores, so teammates that can sweep opposing teams that have had their defensive core weakened are good options. Emboar and Moltres can flourish when opposing Water- and Rock-types have been weakened. Physical Water-types such as Feraligatr, Samurott, and Crawdaunt have an easier time once bulky Grass-types have been weakened or KOed. Swellow and Choice Scarf Braviary are fast Flying-types that can do serious damage to teams after their Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon are weakened. Finally, it would be a good idea to use Spikes support when running Hidden Power Grass to ensure the 2HKO on Alomomola and the OHKO on Quagsire. Faster Spikes users such as Scolipede, Smeargle, and Omastar are typically the way to go as Murkrow should be used on offensive-minded teams.</p> "

        "name": "Stallbreaker",
        "description": "<p>Murkrow has relatively low defensive stats, but thanks to Prankster and its ability to hold Eviolite, it can pull off a stallbreaker set. It must be stressed that Murkrow's defenses are above average at best, even with Eviolite, so it should not be counted on to straight-up wall threats. Taunt is amazing on any Pokemon with Prankster, and Murkrow is no different. Thanks to the priority boost, Murkrow can easily Taunt virtually any Pokemon to disrupt and annoy it. This cuts off the recovery and supporting methods of defensive Pokemon and keeps offensive Pokemon from setting up on Murkrow. Roost gives Murkrow reliable recovery and temporarily removes Murkrow's weaknesses to Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type moves. The next slot allows Murkrow to cripple certain Pokemon. Toxic in conjunction with Taunt can quickly wear down opposing defensive walls as they slowly lose health with no way to use their recovery moves. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can cripple opposing sweepers, and Taunt can keep them from setting up. The last move deals with physical attackers. Foul Play is generally preferred as Murkrow can hit most of the tier for decent damage with it. However, FeatherDance is an option to cut an opponent's Attack stat and allow Murkrow or a teammate to more easily take hits from it.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Murkrow's physical bulk while reducing the damage it takes from Stealth Rock. If you choose to run FeatherDance over Foul Play, it is better to run a Calm nature and invest fully in Special Defense. Murkrow can run a couple of other moves in the last slot. Brave Bird can handle Amoonguss, Roselia, and Clefable more reliably, but be sure to run an Impish nature so as to not gimp its power. Substitute can block attacks from weaker defensive Pokemon, but leaves Murkrow total Taunt bait. Finally, Hidden Power Ground can be used to do something to Steel- and Poison-types, as Murkrow is generally powerless against them.</p> <p>Murkrow has a difficult time dealing with most Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon, so Steelix is a great partner as it can handle many of them. It can also provide phazing and Stealth Rock support. Slowking can handle both physical and special attacks, and is perfectly capable of running the status move Murkrow elects not to run. Entry hazard support is excellent, as Spikes punishes the switches that Murkrow can cause with its antics, while Toxic Spikes can free up a moveslot for Murkrow to use Brave Bird or Hidden Power Ground. Qwilfish and Roselia can utilize both types of Spikes and can check various threats that Murkrow can't handle. Qwilfish is able to take on Escavalier and Durant reliably, while Roselia can deal with Rotom-C and Manectric lacking Flamethrower. Cleric support can be worthwhile as well since many defensive Pokemon can throw out Scald or Sludge Bomb with little risk. Clefable and Miltank can run Heal Bell and can provide other forms of support,with Wish and Stealth Rock, respectively. Thanks to Murkrow's ability to stall out and weaken many defensive Pokemon, offensive Pokemon can benefit from Murkrow's support. Psychic-types that use Calm Mind, such as Uxie, Sigilyph, and Mesprit, enjoy Murkrow's ability to reliably wear down specially defensive Spiritomb. If Murkrow can weaken Alomomola and Quagsire enough, strong physical attackers such as Tauros can lay waste to the remains of a team.</p> "

  "Slowking": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite all the changes that have occurred in RU over time, Slowking still remains one of the best mixed walls within the tier. This is largely thanks to its useful Water typing, access to an instant recovery move, good bulk on both defensive sides, and the incredible Regenerator, which makes it harder to wear down than most other Pokemon. Slowking also has a very wide movepool that consists of good support moves like Trick Room and Thunder Wave, and a wide offensive movepool going from its STABs all the way to Fire Blast, backed up by a decent Special Attack. However, powerful Pokemon such as Durant and Escavalier, as well as Moltres's newfound Hurricane usually being able to 2HKO it, is somewhat troubling, and Slowking's weakness to Pursuit can make its habit of switching out a liability. Overall, though, Slowking is still one of the best Pokemon within the tier, and it is easy to fit onto a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Slowking has a surprisingly large movepool and has many other options. A Nasty Plot set can be used without Trick Room because Slowking has many coverage moves, but Slowking is very slow and therefore gets revenge killed fairly easily. In addition, its main advantage of having Regenerator is fairly worthless in this scenario, since it needs to stay in and keep its boosts. Ice Beam hits Dragon-type Pokemon such as Druddigon and Altaria for a lot of damage, but Druddigon is the only common Dragon-type in RU, making this move usually not worth it. Flamethrower can be used over Fire Blast on any set, but the extra power is preferred even on the defensive set since its main purpose is to deter Grass-types and simply remove them as a threat. Calm Mind can be used in a similar fashion to Slowbro in UU, but Slowking has a much lower physical bulk than Slowbro, meaning it cannot take hits as well.</p> <p>Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit lighter Water-type Pokemon hard, but the most common light Water-types, Lanturn and Qwilfish, are already hit rather hard by Psyshock due to either having a somewhat low physical defense or being weak to the move, respectively. Dragon Tail is useful for phazing the foe, but Slowking generally doesn't have room to put this in its moveset, and against foes with Substitute it can become set-up fodder, since Slowking's Attack is subpar. Finally, Slowking has access to Shadow Ball to deal with Ghost-types, notably Rotom, which can usually cause problems for Slowking, but many Ghost-types, namely Spiritomb, can either take Shadow Balls due to a secondary typing or are weak to another move Slowking has.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to Slowking's versatility, as well as its tendency to switch out often to regain health, it can be difficult to eliminate from the match. Of course, due to Slowking's weakness to Pursuit, STAB users of the move like Drapion and Spiritomb can turn this advantage against Slowking and wear it down much easier. Dark-types can also switch into Slowking's Psychic STABs with impunity. Otherwise, there exist Pokemon that can take repeated hits from Slowking. Lanturn has good bulk and resists its Water and Fire moves, and can use its Electric-type moves and Toxic to wear it down. Ghost-types such as Misdreavus and Rotom can cause problems for Slowking; the former has Taunt to make Slowking unable to heal itself or status Misdreavus, and the other can use Trick to cripple Slowking or hit it hard with its Electric or Ghost STAB. Thanks to Dry Skin, Jynx is immune to or resists Slowking's STABs and can set up on it, but Fire Blast will hurt quite a bit. Escavalier is even weaker to Fire Blast and is somehow slower than Slowking, but with some EV investment in Speed it can outspeed and OHKO with Megahorn.</p> <p>Ironically, Slowking walls itself with its high special defense, but if your Slowking has Toxic it'll win in due time. Despite being rare in RU, Altaria's excellent Special Defense and typing makes it able to take all kinds of hits from Slowking, and thanks to Natural Cure, not even status deters it that much. Druddigon is slow enough to not be deterred by Thunder Wave and it also resists Fire- and Water-type moves, retaliating for a lot of damage with Choice Band-boosted Outrages, but be warned that a burned Druddigon tends to struggle greatly. Despite carrying Fire Blast somewhat often and Psyshock doing quite a bit of damage, Grass-types such as Sceptile and Lilligant can do massive damage to Slowking, and many have access to Sleep Powder to cripple Slowking or a teammate. Finally, using Trick to give Slowking a Choice Scarf or Choice Band severely cripples its walling capabilities, as it will be unable to heal itself without needing to switch out, making it much easier to take down. Users of this strategy include Rotom, Rotom-C, and Manectric, all of whom can also hit Slowking hard with their STAB moves.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<p>Slowking is best utilized by running a defensive set and it works great as a defensive pivot. Bulky Water-types are generally considered to be an important component to any team, and while Slowking doesn't have as many resistances as other bulky Water-types such as Lanturn or Qwilfish, it makes up for it with its incredible staying power. Unlike other bulky Water-types, it has access to instant recovery, and, thanks to Regenerator, Slowking isn't deterred very much by entry hazards compared to other Pokemon. Regenerator also means that it can switch into a resisted hit, land a hit on the foe and then switch out with very little health loss. With key resistances to attacking types such as Fighting-, Fire-, and Ice-moves, Slowking has many opportunities to switch in.</p> <p>The always-infuriating Scald is the main STAB move, and its chance to burn the opponent can help soften blows. Along with this side effect, the ability to hit dangerous threats such as Moltres, Magmortar, and Entei for super effective damage helps it retaliate. As mentioned before, Slack Off allows Slowking to heal even further, meaning it has even more recovery and can heal itself without having to switch out. Slowking also has room for another offensive move. Psyshock gets a STAB boost, and hits Fighting-types and special walls like Cryogonal hard. However, Fire Blast gets the advantage of being able to hit Escavalier and Grass-type Pokemon on the switch. Be warned though that while Escavalier is slower than Slowking, many Escavalier might try to invest in their Speed in order to outspeed Slowking. The last slot comes into play for a status move, and is ultimately dependent on how it's used. In the case that Slowking is switching out often, Thunder Wave is the more preferable option, as it cripples offensive Pokemon that rely on their Speed, even if Slowking cannot hit them hard. However, Toxic is usable as it cripples defensive Pokemon such as opposing Slowking to prevent the annoying Slowking vs Slowking stalemate, or it can wear down an opponent if Slowking isn't repeatedly switching out. However, in the long run, most Pokemon are crippled more by Thunder Wave or a burn caused by Scald.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Slowking to avoid getting OHKOed by Choice Band Drapion's and Choice Band Escavalier's Pursuit when switching out. However, a more specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 SpD is able to avoid a 2HKO from Life Orb Timid Moltres's Hurricane assuming there are no hazards up, which also makes it one of the few Pokemon able to avoid that as well. Slowking can be used as a dedicated special or physical wall with the straightforward EVs, but with these spreads Slowking becomes less of a pivot and less of a solution to hard-hitting foes on the uninvested side. Leftovers should be used here as the item choice, as its extra healing effects work well with all the other HP recovery Slowking can get.</p> <p>One of the main advantages of Slowking is how easy it is to fit onto a team, but one suggestion is that Electric-type Pokemon, especially those that are immune to Thunder Wave, such as Manectric and Electivire, should be dealt with by teammates. Slowking's weakness to Grass-type moves is also troublesome due to how common they are in the tier. Druddigon makes a great partner due to this—its relatively good bulk, resistance to Electric-, Grass-, and Fire-type coverage moves, as well as its high Attack lets it prey on these Pokemon with its Dragon STAB alone. Pursuit users such as Drapion and Spiritomb are also dangerous, as they can make Slowking's tendency to switch in and out more difficult, making Steelix a good partner because it can take hits from common Pursuit users with ease. Slowking aids a lot of Pokemon with its utility, and one common strategy is to pair it up with other Pokemon with Regenerator such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. In particular, these Grass-types are aided by Slowking, as it can easily take Fire-type moves for both of them. Amoonguss can also help out Slowking by taking on Grass-types fairly easily with its Poison STAB. Steel-types like Steelix and Escavalier cannot deal with Fire-type Pokemon very well, and because of this, Slowking pairs up well with them.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Although Slowking is usually seen being played defensively, Slowking still has a fairly good Special Attack stat, as well as a very wide offensive movepool to utilize, making Choice Specs a good item for Slowking. Along with having the advantage of catching foes off guard when they expect a defensive set, Slowking also has a large advantage over other Choice Pokemon. Normally, Choice users have to switch in and out in order to switch their moves again, and because of this many Choice users get worn down very quickly. However, Slowking's access to Regenerator means that this damage can be healed off simply by switching out, allowing it to battle more than other users. Slowking is also still particularly bulky, making it function as an effective tank. Unfortunately, Slowking's vast movepool doesn't contain Hydro Pump, but Surf still does plenty of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Psyshock is preferred as the Psychic STAB because it lets Slowking deal with special walls such as Cryogonal, as well as Pokemon that naturally have a higher Special Defense such as Gallade. However, Psychic's higher Base Power might come in handy. Fire Blast roasts Grass-types such as Sceptile and Lilligant, and hits Ferroseed especially hard. The final slot is up to personal preference; the ever-useful Trick can cripple walls that try to switch into Slowking, making them much easier to deal with in general, but Grass Knot hits Water-types such as opposing Slowking, Quagsire, and Feraligatr hard, all of whom can give Slowking problems.</p> <p>The EVs maximize its Special Attack, and it has enough Speed to outspeed 0 Spe Spiritomb and Quagsire, but there are other foes that Slowking can try to outspeed. For example, with 164 Speed EVs Slowking can get the jump on uninvested Tangrowth, but this Slowking can lose out on quite a lot of bulk, and it is still relatively slow. Of course, doing the opposite is also dangerous, as being unable to outspeed Spiritomb can be a problem because of its STABs hitting hard. Some foes might try to take advantage of Slowking switching out often by trying to use Pursuit on it. Drapion and Spiritomb, the most common STAB Pursuit users, can be taken care of by using physically bulky Pokemon such Steelix, which can take hits from both all day; note that you must scout for them in Team Preview, as escaping will not work.</p> <p>Other Regenerating Pokemon also work well as partners, especially Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. These two Pokemon can take on the bulky Water-types that Slowking struggles to hit hard, and Slowking can also defeat Fire-types rather easily, albeit not as easily as the defensive set. Slowking struggles a bit against Electric-type Pokemon such as Manectric and Rotom, which can hit it for massive damage with their STAB. Specially defensive Pokemon such Clefable can take hits from them fairly easily, and Ground-types such as Golurk can stop any momentum they might try to gain with Volt Switch.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>Slowking is normally extremely slow, but even then, it can easily turn this otherwise crippling flaw into its advantage after it uses Trick Room. With absolute minimum Speed, it gets down to 58 Speed, enough to \"outspeed\" everything in the tier except for Ferroseed and Munchlax, both of which pose no threat offensively toward Slowking. Trick Room also has the advantage of messing with the Speed stats of common Pokemon that hit Slowking hard, such as Manectric or Sceptile, as under these conditions they have a much harder time dealing with Slowking since they must take a hit. Surf is used as the main STAB, and it does quite a bit of damage to the foe if they don't resist it. Fire Blast has decent coverage with Surf, as it destroys Grass-types that resist Surf. The combination of these two moves are only resisted by Water- and Dragon-types. The options for the final slot are both useful, but sadly Slowking only has room for one of them. Nasty Plot allows Slowking to sweep, as at +2 it is difficult to wall without the two aforementioned types. However, Psyshock gets STAB and hits Fighting-types very hard, as well as special walls such as Clefable and Cryogonal.</p> <p>Despite having maximum Special Attack on this set, Leftovers is preferred here, as Slowking is one of the few offensive Pokemon within the tier with access to Trick Room, so keeping it alive is important to set it up more than once. However, a Life Orb lets it hit quite a bit harder, and thanks to Regenerator, it can recover lost HP when it switches out. Slowking could potentially run a bulkier EV spread, possibly with Slack Off for instant recovery over Psyshock or Nasty Plot, if Slowking is used defensively rather than offensively. However, from there it gets quite a bit of competition from Uxie. In addition, instant recovery is risky, as it makes Slowking lose a valuable turn on the already-limited Trick Room.</p> <p>Like any other Trick Room user, pairing Slowking up with other slow offensive Pokemon is very helpful, as under these conditions they can be similar to Slowking—powerful, relatively bulky, and hard to outspeed. Examples of such Pokemon are offensive Tangrowth, Bouffalant, and Escavalier, since they are all normally slow. Since all of them don't need to use Trick Room, they can provide even more offensive coverage and hit more relevant targets. If Nasty Plot is used over Psyshock, this set is walled by Water-types such as opposing Slowking and Lanturn. For these foes, Tangrowth is still a good choice, but other slow Grass-types like Amoonguss can work against these Pokemon. Druddigon is a dangerous opponent for this set, as it resists Fire Blast and Surf, can use Outrage to destroy Slowking, or utilize Sucker Punch to ignore the problem of getting outsped. Since most Druddigon are holding a Choice item, Steel-types such as Steelix can take hits from Druddigon, and they can also usually take a Superpower due to their high physical defense.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This set attempts to use all of Slowking's best traits. With the heavy EV investment in physical bulk, Slowking is able to keep many strong physical Fire- and Fighting-types, such as Entei, Emboar, and Hitmonlee, in check early on, while also being able to sweep late-game once it has obtained a Calm Mind boost. Speaking of Calm Mind, it is the key to this set's flexibility. Slowking can boost its Special Attack and Special Defense to hit much harder and to take special attacks that much better. Scald is Slowking's primary STAB move and allows Slowking to deter physical attackers from just coming in without risk. The 30% burn chance can be very handy when it comes to setting up later in the game. Fire Blast is a great move for Slowking as the move allows it to nail the likes of Escavalier, Ferroseed, and Tangrowth. If these threats are covered, Psyshock is a worthy alternative. With Psyshock, Slowking can break past Poliwrath and Qwilfish much more easily while also faring well against Calm Mind Sigilyph, an ability that few other Pokemon in the tier can boast. Slack Off rounds off the set by giving Slowking reliable recovery so it can continue to pivot in and out early on in a game and to sweep late-game.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Slowking as much physical bulk as possible while also aiming to outspeed minimum Speed Spiritomb. However, because Escavalier is a grave threat to Slowking and also aims for the same Speed benchmark, it may be worth your while to add a few extra Speed EVs to ensure Slowking can outpace all Escavalier and hit them with Fire Blast. Flamethrower is a more reliable Fire-type move that has perfect accuracy and much more PP than Fire Blast. However, the drop in power prevents Slowking from getting the OHKO on Escavalier without a boost. Ice Beam can be used if your team really struggles with Druddigon, but this leaves Slowking eternally walled by most bulky Water-types, which are Pokemon Slowking can easily use as setup fodder late-game. Slowking loves being able to get more than one Calm Mind boost late-game and Toxic Spikes support can allow it to stall out many threats as it does this. For this reason, Roselia can be a great partner as it can switch into many of the Grass- and Electric-type moves Slowking hates having to deal with and use these threats as Toxic Spikes bait. The two also make a solid defensive core that can check many threats and Slowking gives the core a win condition late-game. Slowking likes the presence of powerful wallbreakers to weaken the opposing team so it doesn't need more than one or two Calm Mind boosts to sweep. Moltres, Rotom-C, and special attacker Manectric are good for this role as they can force heavy damage onto most defensive cores with their powerful attacks. Escavalier is much slower than these wallbreakers, but it can easily switch in on most Grass-, Dark-, and Ghost-type Pokemon Slowking hates dealing with. Druddigon is another slower wallbreaker that can switch in on Grass-type moves, but it also fares much better against Electric-types. Absol, Escavalier, and Spiritomb are the biggest threats for this set. Emboar fares well against all three while Moltres and Aggron generally fare well against Escavalier and Spiritomb. Do note, though, that all three of these threats can be crippled by a burn should they try to switch-in and be met with a Scald.</p> "

  "Misdreavus": {
    "overview": "<p>Misdreavus might seem like an odd choice when there's stiff competition from the premier spinblockers, Rotom and Spiritomb. Rotom generally does a better job spinblocking Kabutops and Spiritomb does a better job spinblocking Cryogonal, but Misdreavus acts as an in-between switch-in for both Rapid Spin users. Unfortunately, Misdreavus loses to both Rapid Spin users one-on-one and should only be used as a pivot switch. On the other hand, Misdreavus's NFE status means it can make good use of Eviolite to boost its mediocre defenses. Misdreavus is generally seen on stall teams that need a spinblocker and a cleric. Thankfully, Misdreavus has a handful of support moves, for example Heal Bell, Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Perish Song. Despite these positive characteristics, Misdreavus relies heavily on Eviolite and a simple Trick or Knock Off severely cripples Misdreavus. Misdreavus also has no reliable recovery, leaving it to rely heavily on Wish passing and Pain Split. Misdreavus is still a viable spinblocker to use, but it mustn't switch too much, as it can be worn down quickly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Misdreavus has plenty of other tricks up its sleeve, but alternative sets are either outclassed by another Pokemon or just ineffective. A Calm Mind set could be used, but due to a lack of reliable recovery, Misdreavus finds it hard to stay alive while boosting. The Perish Song trapper from GSC has a slight niche of trapping walls, but because Misdreavus has to stay in for Perish Song's countdown plus spend an extra two turns using Mean Look and Perish Song, it can have difficulty trapping even one Pokemon. Torment is an interesting move because you can force Choice-locked Pokemon to use Struggle, but ideally it's better to use if you're trying to Perish trap. A more offensive approach with Nasty Plot can be used, but with only base 85 Speed and Special Attack, Misdreavus is outsped by many Pokemon such as Archeops and Entei, while bulkier Pokemon such as Emboar, Escavalier, and Druddigon can live a hit and retaliate with their STAB moves. Memento seems appealing because it sacrifices Misdreavus to allow another teammate to set up, but it wastes Misdreavus's walling capability. Misdreavus also has access to Sunny Day, Rain Dance, and Trick Room, but it's generally outclassed by other Pokemon such as Volbeat and Slowking as a field effect setter.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Misdreavus is not a difficult Pokemon to check. Bulky Fire-types such as Emboar and Entei are immune to Will-O-Wisp, take little damage from Shadow Ball, and can strike back with a strong Flare Blitz. Guts users such as Swellow and Hariyama can absorb Will-O-Wisps; the former is immune to Shadow Ball while the latter takes little damage from it. Powerful Dark- and Ghost-types such as Absol, Crawdaunt, and Rotom can hit Misdreavus with their STAB moves, but the former two must be wary of Will-O-Wisp and the latter must watch out for Shadow Ball. Strong special attackers including Typhlosion, Sceptile, Moltres, and Magmortar can take advantage of Misdreavus's uninvested Special Defense. Defensive Pokemon with recovery such as Poliwrath, RestTalk Lanturn, Amoonguss, and Cryogonal can stall out any Misdreavus that doesn't carry Perish Song or Taunt. Finally, Trick and Knock Off severely cripple Misdreavus, making it much easier to take down.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Misdreavus is an excellent choice for a support Pokemon due to its decent defenses and wonderful support moves. Will-O-Wisp is an incredibly helpful move, as it cripples physical attackers such as Hitmonlee, Druddigon, and Kabutops. Pain Split allows Misdreavus to regain some health; it is especially useful against high HP Pokemon such as Slowking, Alomomola, and Tangrowth. Shadow Ball is Misdreavus's strongest STAB move and deals respectable damage to Psychic- and Ghost-types. Heal Bell is the recommended last move because it protects your team from ever-so-common status. Misdreavus also has base 85 Speed, which is quite fast for a support Pokemon, so it can Taunt other walls before they status it. However, if your team has trouble forcing out bulky Pokemon such as Cosmic Power Sigilyph, Alomomola, and Walrein, Perish Song is the optimal choice.</p> <p>Misdreavus still has other supporting moves, including Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Confuse Ray, which are all viable, and you may opt to use any of the moves if they support your team better than the ones listed above. Toxic is especially useful for dealing with Cryogonal, as it might faint from poison before it gets the chance to spin should Misdreavus have enough HP. Foul Play can be used in place of Shadow Ball because it does a considerable amount of damage to physical attackers such as Cinccino, Entei, and Zangoose. As Misdreavus gets worn down quickly, a RestTalk set could be used to have a better form of recovery. If you want to increase Misdreavus's Speed, 100 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed max base 55 Speed Pokemon such as Crawdaunt and Omastar and other Pokemon that aim for the same benchmark. Another alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 132 Def / 124 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Kabutops and burn it while avoiding an OHKO from a +2 Stone Edge.</p> <p>A Wish passer is recommended because Misdreavus doesn't have reliable recovery, so Alomomola and Clefable make good teammates. Misdreavus is perfectly capable of acting as a spinblocker, so Crustle and Ferroseed pair up nicely, spreading entry hazards. Regarding hazards, Misdreavus must be wary of multiple switch-ins since the premier spinners, Kabutops and Cryogonal, can wear it down. Bulky Steel-types such as Steelix and Ferroseed are good partners, as their typing allow them to combat Ghost- and Dark-type moves that threaten Misdreavus, while Misdreavus switches in on the Fighting-type moves aimed at them.</p> "

  "Steelix": {
    "overview": "<p>Large, silver, and sleek, stare in awe at Steelix. That menacing grin is not only for show, as Steelix practically laughs at half of the tier for the pittance in damage it receives. A reliable Steel / Ground typing gives it nine resistances and two immunities, while an astonishing base 200 Defense backed by a great base 75 HP makes Steelix one, if not THE, premier physical wall in the RU tier. With the proper EV investment, it can take both physical and special hits, being a great check or counter to threats such as Galvantula, Escavalier, and Aggron. Don't forget about Sturdy, which acts as a pseudo-Focus Sash. A godawful base 30 Speed and an average base 85 Attack are slightly concerning, but don't let that depress you; even that poor Speed is beneficial, as it enables Steelix to hit hard with Gyro Ball, an especially deadly move against various frail sweepers such as Sceptile. Steelix easily fits in with almost any team, ready to grin and bear the brunt of an opponent while setting up Stealth Rock on a whim!</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Curse set is an option should you want to maximize Steelix's physical bulk and give it a better attacking role. It works best if its counters are gone, as it will gradually get slower as it uses Curse. Rock Head should not even be considered, as Double-Edge is the only worthwhile move to make use of it. Defensive sets love the protection of Sturdy, while offensive sets would, for the better part, prefer Sheer Force. Speaking of Sheer Force, Steelix has an expansive physical movepool to make use of it, but its Speed is a letdown. Rock Polish and Autotomize can mitigate this somewhat, but even after one boost, a max Speed Steelix is still outsped by Archeops by two points. RestTalk remains a viable strategy in that it enables Steelix to reuse Sturdy, but Steelix wants free usage of its moves. In addition, Taunt royally screws such a set.</p> <p>Crunch is available to hit Ghost-types such as Rotom. Bulky Ghost-types can easily shrug off the damage, though. The elemental fangs are available too; Fire Fang has merit in that it can help against Ferroseed and Escavalier. Otherwise, they should really be considered only with Sheer Force, as Steelix is not causing much damage without it. Explosion turns Steelix into fiery pieces of shrapnel to pierce an opponent, though the nerf of it in BW makes it an inferior option. Finally, Taunt is an odd choice for such a slow Pokemon, but it helps against boosting sweepers such as Cosmic Power Sigilyph. It also shuts down most Clefable, and makes one-on-one confrontations with Ferroseed much easier.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath and Slowking can take on anything Steelix throws at them and retaliate with their STAB moves. Rotom has no fear of any moves that Steelix can throw at it, bar the unlikely Crunch. A burn from Will-O-Wisp also ruins Steelix's average Attack, though it should be noted that without Will-O-Wisp, Steelix can win with Gyro Ball. For that reason, Rotom-C takes on Steelix more reliably thanks to an increase in bulk. Omastar, in spite of a weakness to Ground-type attacks, can beat Steelix thanks to its good Defense. In the same vein, Tangrowth has very little to worry about against Steelix. Ferroseed and Clefable become threats to Steelix that don't pack Taunt. Speaking of Taunt, it ruins efforts to set up Stealth Rock and stops Roar from working.</p> <p>Bulky Ground-types such as Rhydon and Sandslash are great checks to Steelix, as both outspeed and can wear down Steelix with Earthquake. In Sandslash's case, it can also use Rapid Spin to eliminate Stealth Rock. Fire-types such as Entei and Magmortar can check Steelix, but an Earthquake when switching into Stealth Rock can spell doom for both. Moltres fears nothing bar the rare Stone Edge, but likewise detests the appearance of Stealth Rock, especially because it strips half of its health upon switching in. Fighting-types such as Gallade and Medicham are also decent checks against Steelix, though they don't appreciate a Gyro Ball to the face.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The gold standard for Steelix; it takes resisted physical hits like a boss while getting the most desired entry hazard up easily. Stealth Rock is right at home in the RU tier, as it wreaks the myriad of Bug-, Flying-, and Fire-types that await. From there, Steelix wants to retaliate with a semblance of force. Earthquake grants this as its primary STAB move, putting a dent on anything it hits super effectively. Gyro Ball is its secondary STAB move that is useful against frail foes that are speedier than Steelix. It OHKOes Archeops and deals 78.59 - 92.25% damage to Primeape, a guaranteed OHKO with Stealth Rock and two layers of Spikes. Gyro Ball also does a decent number against Rotom, should it lack a super effective Hidden Power or Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>The final move is quite a fickle one, though. Because Steelix attracts unwanted attention from Pokemon wanting to set up on it, particularly those who resist or have no problem taking on its STAB moves, a phazing move is desired. The benefit is twofold, as the forced switch also racks up entry hazard damage. With access to two phazing moves, Steelix must make a choice; Roar has been a mainstay in Steelix's arsenal since GSC. Accuracy and the ability to phaze through an opponent's Substitute still make it the primary choice. However, Taunt ruins the chance of a Roar to be bellowed, so Steelix has the option of turning to a secondary phazing move. Dragon Tail deals damage while forcing out the opponent, meaning that damage is caused to both shifted Pokemon when in lieu with entry hazards. However, there are two downsides to Dragon Tail; it doesn't phaze through a Substitute, and the 90% accuracy may result in a costly miss.</p> <p>The given EV spread ensures that Choice Band Archeops and Choice Scarf Primeape 3HKO Steelix with Earthquake and Close Combat, respectively, factoring in Stealth Rock on the field. The remaining EVs bolster Steelix's underwhelming Special Defense. If you prefer to take special attacks a bit better, an alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 96 Def / 160 SpD can be used. Though you trade in the 3HKO guaranteed with the standard spread (a 5.86% chance of being 2HKOed by Choice Band Archeops and Choice Scarf Primeape without Stealth Rock), the additional special bulk ensures that only a 3HKO occurs from unboosted special attackers such as Life Orb Rotom.</p> <p>If Stealth Rock or phazing is left to another Pokemon, Steelix has other options to take on its checks. Toxic can be used against bulkier walls such as Tangrowth, bulky Water-types, and defensive Ghost-types such as Dusknoir and Spiritomb. Stone Edge nails Moltres and Scyther on the switch in. However, because Stealth Rock already robs them of half of their health, it should really be considered only if you have another teammate setting up Stealth Rock. In any case, recall that with no EV investment, the only things Stone Edge will be dealing any meaningful damage to is frail foes weak to Rock-type attacks. Finally, Rest is an option to keep Steelix around longer; against physical attackers who can barely scratch Steelix, it is the perfect way to recover its health. However, the sleep mechanics this generation make sleep undesirable, so the importance of a cleric becomes clear in the case that Steelix is forced out.</p> <p>Because Steelix is weak to some very common types in the metagame, it appreciates Pokemon who can absorb Ground-, Water-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks. It therefore has perfect synergy with Rotom, Slowking, and Poliwrath, who, in return, appreciate Steelix's resistances and immunities. Cleric support is appreciated, as Steelix hates being burned and will love being healed if it carries Rest. Misdreavus carries Heal Bell, so if Steelix packs Rest, it can easily wake it up. Much like Rotom, it also provides anti-spin support. Alomomola is another bulky Water-type with good synergy, with the added benefit of providing Wish support. Gardevoir is also a decent package, carrying both Wish and Heal Bell alongside good special bulk to complement Steelix's natural physical bulk. If its counters are eliminated, Steelix is very difficult to take down, phazing away boosting sweepers and wearing down opponents. Therefore, Steelix adores entry hazards alongside the Stealth Rock it lays.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Looking for a way to counter Choice Band Druddigon, set up Stealth Rock, and keep momentum all in one Pokemon? Boy, do I have the answer for you. This Custap Berry set is about the only way Steelix will fit on an offensive team without giving up momentum by being weak and slow as hell. Switch into a Pokemon that Steelix checks, such as Druddigon, Durant, or Escavalier, set up Stealth Rock, throw around an Earthquake or two, and then once Steelix is in Custap Berry range, use Explosion to get Steelix out of the way and bring in a teammate safely. This Steelix is meant to be played hard and fast, so you should ultimately not feel too bad about losing it in the long run. Heavy Slam is chosen over Gyro Ball as the Steel STAB move due to its greater damage across the board to a varied amount of Pokemon, particularly against other slow Pokemon like Amoonguss.</p> <p>Attack is maxed, and 44 Speed EVs are run to outpace minimum Speed Spiritomb. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP to increase overall bulk. Rock Blast can be used over Heavy Slam since Moltres can otherwise come into this set and set up a Substitute without issue. Getting Stealth Rock set up quickly and getting a teammate in for free is a huge draw for using this set, so frail setup sweepers make excellent teammates, particularly Lilligant, Sigilyph, and Sceptile. Neither Kabutops nor Cryogonal like switching into Steelix, meaning Stealth Rock is unlikely to get blown away while it's in. Once Steelix Explodes out, offensive pressure can then keep those two from spinning away the hazards. This Steelix likes switching into Rotom and other Volt Switch users as it immediately captures momentum from them and allows itself to set up Stealth Rock; however, defensive Will-O-Wisp Rotom will give Steelix a bit of trouble and probably force it to Explode. If you're worried about Rotom you can run Crunch in place of Heavy Slam, though Heavy Slam should be enough to ward off most Rotom.</p> "

With this set, Steelix retains the ability to counter physical attackers like Cinccino and check Druddigon, lures in its common checks, and poses a significant offensive threat to the opponent, meaning it is best suited for balanced teams. Earthquake is Steelix's main STAB move of choice despite revealing its Life Orb. Iron Tail, despite its horrible accuracy, is chosen as the Steel STAB because it hits like an absolute nuke with Sheer Force and Life Orb. However, it should only be used when the power is absolutely needed due to its terrible accuracy. Iron Head is a good alternative to Iron Tail and won't miss, but it misses out on a few KOs: the guaranteed 2HKO on Amoonguss, the OHKO on bulky Swords Dance Gallade after Stealth Rock, a high chance to OHKO Kabutops after Stealth Rock, the OHKO on Lilligant, a small chance to 2HKO Uxie after Stealth Rock, and a high chance to OHKO Sigilyph. However, with Life Orb, the move retains many of the same 2HKOs, so depending on how you want to play with Steelix and the team it's on, Iron Head can still be a great move choice. Crunch takes the last slot to annihilate Rotom and easily 2HKO Slowking and other Psychic-types without needing to rely on Iron Tail.</p> <p>44 Speed EVs are used to outpace minimum Speed Spiritomb and, more importantly, Amoonguss and Slowking. Rock Slide gets the Sheer Force boost and is a great tool to lure in and destroy Fire-types like Moltres. Leftovers is usable over Life Orb to better bluff the standard defensive set, and Steelix is still decently strong thanks to Sheer Force.</p> <p>This set is a great lure for common switch-ins to Steelix, particularly those that like to use it as setup bait, such as Qwilfish. This set always 2HKOes Qwilfish with Earthquake after Stealth Rock and Intimidate, and easily 2HKOes Amoonguss with Iron Tail. This set also survives Life Orb Durant's Superpower, and can OHKO in return with Earthquake (only after the Defense drop from Superpower, though). The luring aspect of this set is what makes it work as well as it does, and it makes a great alternative to Golurk, which is not as physically bulky.</p> <p>Good teammates include Slowking, which has exceptionally good type synergy with Steelix and loves the removal of Pokemon like Amoonguss. Magmortar is another great teammate to take out Tangrowth with and make great use of the holes that Steelix punches into the opponent's team. Pokemon that enjoy Qwilfish being removed or maimed by this set make good teammates too, Escavalier and Emboar in particular.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Say hello to Ursaring, a Pokemon that has been crushing villages since ADV. With its absurdly high base 130 Attack and its two abilities allowing it to play as different kinds of status attackers, this thing is a serious threat to watch out for. It's also slightly bulkier than other status attackers, with decent defenses of 90 / 75 / 75. It has a terrible base Speed of 55, but that can easily be mitigated with Quick Feet.</p> <p>However, Ursaring receives a ton of competition from other status attackers, most notably Zangoose. Zangoose, which is a similar status attacker to Ursaring thanks to its Dream World ability Toxic Boost, is faster than Guts Ursaring, and stronger than Quick Feet Ursaring, so Ursaring is required to specialize to stand out, making it generally inferior. In fact, the only thing that Ursaring is better at in both sets is its bulk. Don't let all this discourage you from using Ursaring, though; while the metagame around it has shifted, Ursaring itself still functions as the same town smasher it was before, and is a deadly force to be reckoned with.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Unfortunately, Ursaring has very few other viable options it can turn to. Fire Punch is a decent move that allows Ursaring to bypass Durant, Escavalier, and Ferroseed more easily, but it's going to find a hard time fitting it into one of the above sets. It also has some other interesting boosting moves such as Belly Drum and Work Up. However, the former will get Ursaring KOed easily while the other pales in comparison to the +2 boost that Swords Dance provides. A RestTalk set can be used in conjunction with Bulk Up, but is generally outclassed by Vigoroth, which possesses similar bulk to Ursaring thanks to Eviolite, higher Speed, and better support moves such as Slack Off and Taunt. Finally, Ursaring has lots of great coverage moves such as Stone Edge and the elemental punches, but the moves given on the above sets already give Ursaring perfect coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ursaring, unfortunately, doesn't come without its checks and counters. First of all, Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan's Mach Punch and Sucker Punch from Pokemon like Absol will put a massive dent in Ursaring's HP. Ferroseed can check the Guts set if Ursaring doesn't have Close Combat or Fire Punch and can chip away at it with a combination of Iron Barbs and Leech Seed. Steelix and Rhydon can take all of Ursaring's moves except for a Guts-boosted Close Combat and Earthquake. Alomomola and Tangrowth can avoid a 2HKO from Quick Feet Ursaring and can also chip away at it. Additionally, Ursaring's reliance on status Orbs is also a double-edged sword; it hates the residual damage and can often be worn down simply by switching in Ghost-types, which are immune to its most powerful attacks. Fast Pokemon with Speed investment, such as Sceptile and Durant, will have no trouble taking down Ursaring. Of course, if even Pokemon without a Choice Scarf can outpace and beat Ursaring, Choice Scarf users such as Medicham will usually be able to do the same. Finally, Escavalier can stomach a hit even from Guts Ursaring and OHKOes it with Megahorn.</p> ",

With the Quick Feet boost, Ursaring is able to outspeed Pokemon in the base 91 to base 105 Speed tier, such as Sigilyph, Scyther, and Rotom, which makes it significantly better at cleaning offensive teams in conjunction with its decent bulk. Protect ensures that the status Orb activates and Ursaring gets its Speed boost, making it kind of like a boosting move. However, if you feel confident that you don't need Protect to activate the Orb and keep Ursaring alive, you can use Swords Dance to boost Ursaring's Attack and muscle through defensive threats a little easier. Facade is the STAB move of choice for this set, as the boost from the poison status pushes this attack to absurd levels of power. Close Combat is a great coverage option for hitting the Rock- and Steel-types that resist Facade, and Crunch hits the Ghost-types that are immune to both the previous moves.</p> <p>Because this set aims to be faster than Zangoose, a Jolly nature is preferred, as it allows Ursaring to do so. However, even after having a Jolly nature, Quick Feet, and maximum Speed investment, Ursaring still isn't that fast, which is something that should be kept in mind while battling. Toxic Orb activates Ursaring's Quick Feet, and Flame Orb shouldn't even be considered, as it halves Ursaring's Attack stat. As for teammates, Ghost- and Psychic-types are great teammates to have, as they can both cover Ursaring's Fighting weakness. This allows Ursaring to clean through teams much more easily late-game. Examples of some good Pokemon to use include Spiritomb and Uxie. Physically based Water-types such as Kabutops and Samurott are also good teammates as they pressure most Rock- and Steel-types and can wear down bulky Water-types.

    "overview": "<p>Despite its NFE status, Piloswine holds a strong niche in RU as a great tank. Thanks to Eviolite, Piloswine's decent 100 / 80 / 60 defenses reach formidable levels, allowing it to take many hits. Piloswine is no slouch offensively either, as it has a solid base 100 Attack and great Ground / Ice coverage to back it up. Thick Fat is a boon for Piloswine as well, as it neuters its Fire weakness and grants it an Ice resistance. However, Piloswine has its flaws. Its typing, while granting some decent resistances, gives it many weaknesses to common attacking types such as Water, Grass, and Fighting. Secondly, Piloswine is extremely slow, meaning it is forced to take damage before it reacts. Finally, Piloswine lacks any reliable recovery, not even Leftovers, so it will be worn down fairly easily by repeated hits over the course of the match. Despite these flaws, Piloswine is still a solid Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Piloswine has some unorthodox options that can be used to some effect. Superpower is a powerful move, but it provides no notable coverage aside from Ferroseed. Toxic is a usable option to wear down defensive Pokemon that Piloswine is unable to break through, such as Uxie and Cryogonal, but it is more often than not a waste of a moveslot. Piloswine has access to Curse, meaning it can act as a powerful and bulky attacker, but it will rarely find the time to boost, and its lack of reliable recovery really lets it down. Quite ironically, Piloswine has access to Light Screen and Reflect to soften up hits. Endeavor in conjunction with a Focus Sash and Ice Shard can work, but this strategy is nothing more than a gimmick. Amnesia is a decent option to boost Piloswine's middling Special Defense, but this is generally not a worthwhile investment overall. Roar is usable for Piloswine to shuffle the opposing team, and this complements Stealth Rock well. Rest and Sleep Talk are Piloswine's only form of recovery, but Piloswine is then strapped for moveslots. Furthermore, the sleep mechanics of the fifth generation make this a bad idea. Finally, Piloswine can go more on the offensive with either a Life Orb or a Choice Band, but is too slow to make good use of the items.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Although Piloswine's great coverage and bulk make it hard to counter, there are several good ways to check it. Sceptile, Rotom-C, and Lilligant cannot come in on Icicle Crash or Ice Shard, but their Grass STAB can make quick work out of Piloswine. Poliwrath and Alomomola are bulky enough to take most of Piloswine's attacks and can retaliate with Scald or Waterfall, respectively. Ludicolo, Feraligatr, and Samurott can all check Piloswine decently, although the latter two must be wary of coming in on Earthquake. Defensive variants of Cryogonal can stall Piloswine with Toxic while spinning away Stealth Rock. Escavalier and Slowking both have enough bulk to take hits from Piloswine and can retaliate with Iron Head or Surf. Moltres can come in on Piloswine that lack Stone Edge and make quick work of them with its power. Durant, Gallade, and Hitmonlee all hit Piloswine super effectively but must be wary of coming in on Piloswine's attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is Piloswine's best bet at working well in RU. With solid bulk, a decent Attack stat, Stealth Rock, and good dual STABs, Piloswine can function as a solid tank that can take strong hits while dishing them out. While it faces stiff competition from Rhydon, Piloswine stands out with its resistance to Ice, lack of a Ground weakness, priority, and greater special bulk. Piloswine also checks threats such as Absol and Jynx rather well. Stealth Rock is a great asset to any team, and Piloswine does well at setting it up with its decent typing and bulk. Earthquake provides an obligatory Ground STAB and hits decently hard off of Piloswine's base 100 Attack stat. Icicle Crash is chosen as the primary Ice STAB due to its decent Base Power. Icicle Spear, however, is useful to break Substitutes from Pokemon such as Sceptile, and also provides perfect accuracy. Finally, Ice Shard is chosen as priority to pick off weakened opponents, and it also patches up Piloswine's low Speed stat decently. However, Stone Edge is usable if priority is not needed; it gives Piloswine the edge over Moltres and Cryogonal.</p> <p>The EV spread is fairly simple; it aims to make the most of Piloswine's bulk and decent power. However, a more defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature can be used to allow Piloswine to take hits better while still hitting decently hard, although the extra bulk is rarely needed. An Adamant nature is chosen to make the most of Piloswine's offensive options. Thick Fat is a great ability, as it neuters Piloswine's Fire weakness and grants it a resistance to Ice, further complementing its tanking abilities. Stone Edge is a viable option over Stealth Rock if the move is not needed.</p> <p>Roselia is a good teammate; it resists the Water- and Grass-type moves that Piloswine despises, while Piloswine resists Ice-type moves. Roselia also can set up Spikes to allow Piloswine to nab more needed KOs. Piloswine has no recovery, not even Leftovers, so Wish support is ideal; Clefable and Alomomola are both viable options. Misdreavus pairs up well and can absorb Fighting-type attacks aimed at Piloswine while preventing the removal of Stealth Rock; it can also cure Piloswine of status with Heal Bell. Offensive Pokemon that benefit from the Stealth Rock that Piloswine sets up are good teammates; Rotom-C and Lilligant are both good examples, handling bulky Water-types for Piloswine.</p> "

  "Smeargle": {
    "overview": "<p>Access to nearly every move in the game creates an infinitely dangerous Pokemon, even if that Pokemon has as pitiful stats as Smeargle. While it really can't make use of its expansive offensive movepool, it can most definitely use its supportive movepool. Due to its lack of defenses and decent Speed, Smeargle is almost always used as a lead, even in the age of Team Preview. This way it can tank at least one hit thanks to Focus Sash and accomplish what it needs to. Spore is an almost universal move found on Smeargle thanks to it being the fastest user of the move in the tier. Beyond that, the possibilities are almost endless. Every setup move + Baton Pass, every entry hazard, dual screens, every supportive move, and every status move are at Smeargle's fingertips.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Smeargle, sleep inducing moves are pretty common in RU, so almost every team is prepared for its Spore in some way or another. Absolutely zero offensive presence also means Smeargle is highly susceptible to Taunt, Substitute, and other setup moves, particularly if it's not carrying Whirlwind. Still, Smeargle will almost always accomplish its goal and is a very real threat in the tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The actual number of possible sets Smeargle can run is legitimately endless. Most of Smeargle's best options have already been covered in the sets above and are what you should be using with Smeargle most of the time. However, some alternative moves that have not been covered that have some niche use will be detailed here.</p> <p>Tailwind is an awesome move to boost the Speed of Smeargle's team before it goes down without the need to use Baton Pass. The limited turns it lasts sucks, so it should only be used if Smeargle is about to be KOed to be most effective. Lunar Dance is an awesome move to give a teammate of Smeargle's a new lease on life, and Smeargle is one of the only ones with access to it or Healing Wish in RU (the other most common user being Mesprit). However, to best use Lunar Dance Smeargle must be used outside of the lead slot. Dual screens are always awesome to give a teammate a great setup chance, and Smeargle's access to Spore creates some wicked setup opportunities. However, Smeargle will rarely be able to survive two hits even with a screen in place, meaning most of the time Memento will be most useful. Disable has some niche use, but Smeargle has a lot of other stuff it needs to accomplish before going down. Encore can be awesome to give Smeargle some more time to set up hazards or safely phaze an opponent out. Smeargle is one of the very few with access to Gravity in the tier, but building a team around the move is hard to do. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are options as well, which, again, combined with Spore can give a sweeper like Ludicolo or Victreebel the opening it needs to get in safely. Aromatherapy is another option to heal the team of status, but Lunar Dance is typically better. Imprison is the best way to win a Smeargle vs Smeargle standoff. Finally, Will-O-Wisp and Toxic are other status options to use against the opponent, though they're typically outclassed by Spore and Glare.</p> <p>Do not, under any circumstances, try to use any attacking move with Smeargle. It simply is not worth it. Even after a Belly Drum, Smeargle lacks the sheer power to really sweep even with STAB ExtremeSpeed. Smeargle should stick to non-damaging moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Multi-hit moves absolutely destroy Smeargle; they break its Focus Sash and prevent it from accomplishing anything. Users of Rock Blast, Bullet Seed, Tail Slap, and Gear Grind that outspeed Smeargle are the best, examples being Cinccino and Klinklang. Rhydon and Crustle can also work but they are open to being put to sleep by Spore. Lum Berry users, such as Gallade, Durant, Kabutops, Uxie, and Lilligant, can easily outspeed and 2HKO Smeargle and not be put to sleep by Spore. They won't prevent a layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock going up though if the Smeargle user suspects Lum Berry and avoids using Spore. Volt Switch and U-turn can be used to break Smeargle's Focus Sash, and something to absorb the Spore can then be switched in to knock it out.</p> <p>Sap Sipper Pokemon gain an Attack boost from Spore, and Miltank and Sawsbuck even outspeed Smeargle to limit it to only 1 layer of hazards. Pokemon with Vital Spirit, such as Magmortar, are also immune to Spore and will limit Smeargle to 1 layer as well. Any Pokemon with Substitute can block Spore and is a good way to deal with Smeargle in general, though the Smeargle user can suspect the Substitute and use an entry hazard as the Substitute goes up and then just Whirlwind away the Pokemon the next turn. Sleep Talk users can absorb the Spore and directly threaten Smeargle, common users being Emboar and Escavalier. However, Escavalier is susceptible to allowing Smeargle to set up multiple layers of hazards due to its low Speed.</p> <p>Faster sleep inducers, such as Jynx and Lilligant, can put Smeargle to sleep before it moves, though their sleep move is less accurate and a miss means they will in turn be put to sleep and possibly crippled for the rest of the match. Magic Coat users, such as Golurk and Mesprit, can bounce back Spore or Smeargle's entry hazards. Taunt users, such as Qwilfish, completely shut down Smeargle as well, though Smeargle is typically faster and it can carry Magic Coat. Fake Out followed by an attack or an attack followed by a priority move such as Aqua Jet also works to limit Smeargle's entry hazards. Kangaskhan in particular works great and will completely prevent Smeargle from accomplishing anything.</p> <p>Setting up entry hazards and phazing Smeargle out also works wonders against it, and phazing is the best way of dealing with the Baton Pass and Trick Room sets. Steelix and Drapion are good phazers, and Cryogonal with Haze is a good option to switch directly into the Baton Pass set. Beware that Smeargle has a field day against most stall teams since it will outspeed a majority of their members; this is where packing a Magic Coat user or using the VoltTurn strategy mentioned above works best against Smeargle.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Hazard Lead",
        "description": "<p>This is Smeargle's most common set, as it fits perfectly on offensive teams, quickly setting up a layer of hazards or two and getting out of the way via KO. If the opportunity presents itself, such as against a slow defensive team, Spore can shut down one Pokemon and allow Smeargle to set up an extra layer of hazards. Against offensive teams, the Pokemon that the opponent chooses to lead with will in all likelihood be the one that will be able to deal with Spore in some way, usually through Sleep Talk, but even just making it rely on that move can significantly help your team. However, you can choose to ignore using Spore and go straight for Spikes if you suspect the opponent's lead is carrying any of Lum Berry, Sleep Talk, or Substitute, or even just switch out and come back in later if you suspect Taunt or a multi-hit move. Spikes is typically the best hazard to set up with Smeargle, as its distribution is poor and another teammate can easily set up Stealth Rock. Stealth Rock is definitely still a main option to run as well, particularly if Smeargle is being used on a heavy offense team. However, Rapid Spin is usable in Stealth Rock's stead as it prevents the opponent from setting up hazards alongside Smeargle for free.</p> <p>The last moveslot is dedicated to ensuring that Smeargle isn't setup fodder post-Spore. Whirlwind blows away Substitute users and other setup sweepers and racks up entry hazard damage. As a bonus, phazing out the Pokemon Smeargle put to sleep resets the sleep counter. Explosion and Memento can be used instead to get Smeargle out as quickly as possible while giving a teammate a free switch in, as well as simultaneously pseudo-spinblocking for itself. Explosion even does upwards of 80% to most Cryogonal and forces Kabutops to incur a Weak Armor Defense drop. However, both of these options leave Smeargle open to most Substitute users.</p> <p>Focus Sash is the item of choice because Smeargle wouldn't survive most hits in the tier without it and it allows Smeargle to get at worst one entry hazard laid down. The EV spread is simple and maxes Speed to outspeed as many Pokemon as possible to put them to sleep before getting hit. HP is maxed as well but isn't necessarily needed; the situations in which having some HP can come into play is if Smeargle isn't used in the lead slot, as attacks like Choice Scarf Volt Switch from Rotom won't OHKO it with max HP. If Smeargle is running Explosion those HP EVs should be moved to Attack so that Smeargle deals the most damage and has the best chance of breaking the opponent's Substitutes.</p> <p>The first three moveslots on the set above are pretty much mandatory for this kind of set, but the last slot is highly fluid. Other options include Magic Coat, Glare, Metal Burst, Endeavor, and Taunt. Magic Coat prevents the opponent from setting up entry hazards and from Taunting Smeargle. Glare can cripple a setup sweeper attempting to use Smeargle as setup bait. Metal Burst will deal a ton of damage back to the opponent and probably KO, but Smeargle needs to be slower than the opponent for it to be effective. Endeavor is a great move that doesn't require Smeargle to be slower than the opponent and can irreparably cripple a Pokemon like Alomomola. Finally, Taunt most effectively prevents any kind of set up against Smeargle, though it needs to be faster than the opponent or catch it on the switch in to be effective.</p> <p>A particular strategy not yet covered is TrickScarf. This requires replacing Focus Sash with Choice Scarf and using Trick in the last slot. This brings several perks to the table. The speed Choice Scarf brings can allow Smeargle to set up two layers of Spikes when normally it would only be able to set up one. A particular situation is when the opponent uses a VoltTurn user to typically break Smeargle's Focus Sash and switch in a faster Pokemon. Smeargle can typically survive the Volt Switch or U-turn and then proceed to outspeed the incoming Pokemon and set up another layer. Against defensive teams, Tricking a Choice Scarf onto one of the Pokemon can be game changing, especially considering the Pokemon chosen to absorb the Spore from Smeargle will likely be a RestTalk user. Finally, the Choice Scarf gives Smeargle an exceptionally fast Spore, meaning it can come in later in the match and cripple an otherwise poised to sweep sweeper. The obvious downside to running TrickScarf is that Smeargle is then open to being OHKOed by an exceptionally large pool of moves it would normally be able to survive thanks to Focus Sash.</p> <p>The standard set works best on offensive teams, as it simply isn't bulky enough to find a place on defensive teams, and Qwilfish and Roselia are better Spikers for those anyway. The best teammates are those offensive Pokemon that make best use of the Spikes Smeargle lays down, prime examples being Entei, Druddigon, Sceptile, and Escavalier. Kabutops fits well on offensive teams as well and can spin for Smeargle should it not be able to come out in the lead slot. If you choose to not run Stealth Rock, a solid offensive Stealth Rock user capable of keeping the offensive momentum should be used in its stead. Mesprit and Golurk are great for this role as they provide varied offensive pressure and force switches, creating opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. The entry hazards Smeargle sets up are easily capitalized on by offensive VoltTurn teams, meaning Manectric, Cinccino, Moltres, and Rotom-C are great teammates too. Finally, a spinblocker like Rotom is recommended to keep Smeargle's hazards on the field, especially considering it won't be around to set them up again past the first couple turns. However, the need for a spinblocker can be circumvented via the use of Explosion or Memento and keeping up a high amount of offensive pressure.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Baton Pass",
        "description": "<p>With access to the best setup moves in the game in combination with Baton Pass, Smeargle is one of the best possible short pass teammates imaginable. Get Smeargle in against a slow Pokemon and proceed to either setup with Quiver Dance or Shift Gear, or put the opponent to sleep with Spore. Deciding which move to use first depends on what you think your opponents are going to do and if you think they have a Pokemon that will absorb Spore easily enough. Usually, boosting first is the better option, as it gives Smeargle and its teammate an extra turn of sleep if Spore is used second. However, if Smeargle boosts first, it leaves itself exposed to priority moves, meaning it won't be able to use either of Spore or Baton Pass to avoid getting hit. Which setup move to use depends on which teammate you'd like to sweep with, Quiver Dance for special sweepers and Shift Gear for physical. Substitute is in the last slot to avoid any kind of status, and it gives Smeargle's teammate a safe switch in when used with Baton Pass (though being able to pass both Substitute and Quiver Dance/Shift Gear is a rare occurrence).</p> <p>The best time to bring this Smeargle out is after you've set up a few entry hazards and have weakened the opposing team a bit. By then, you'll typically have the opponent's check to your Baton Pass recipient at low enough health to proceed to set up and sweep. Smeargle shouldn't be your only win condition though, and it won't always be able to set up, so gauge your opponent and decide if you will need to save Spore for a specific Pokemon. Keeping entry hazards off the field is also a top priority so that Smeargle has the best chance of setting up with its Focus Sash intact.</p> <p>Maxing Speed and HP gives Smeargle the best possible chances of setting up and passing to its teammate. Though Quiver Dance and Shift Gear are usually the best moves to set up and pass to a teammate because of the Speed boost alongside the attack boost they give, there are a few other options to consider. Belly Drum is a viable alternative, as a complete +6 boost to Attack to any physical attacker in the tier is an almost guaranteed sweep. As a bonus, the teammate doesn't have to suffer the 50% cut to its HP, though this obviously makes it substantially harder for Smeargle to set up successfully. Tail Glow is essentially the special equivalent to Belly Drum. Other boosting moves include Hone Claws, Swords Dance, Growth, and Bulk Up. Defensive boosting moves, such as Cotton Guard and Cosmic Power, are not recommended due to their susceptibility to being instantly ruined by critical hits and the lack of immediate threat that they bring compared to the offensive boosting moves. As a note, remember that Shell Smash cannot be Baton Passed due to the ban of Shell Smash + Baton Pass in RU.</p> <p>If you're using Smeargle on a more dedicated Baton Pass team, or if you're worried about being phazed in general, Ingrain can be used over Substitute to prevent Whirlwind and other phazing moves from ruining Smeargle's strategy from the get-go. Taunt can also work in a similar manner and has the added benefit of also preventing status moves, though Smeargle is still open to being phazed by the admittedly rare Dragon Tail and Circle Throw. Magic Coat is another possible option to reflect back Taunt, status moves, phazing moves, and entry hazards.</p> <p>In general, this set is best used as a supplement to offensive teams, creating setup opportunities and keeping up offensive pressure on the opponent. The best recipients are offensive Pokemon with decent Speed that only need a +1 to their offensive stat(s) to complete a sweep. Some examples include Moltres, Magmortar, Medicham, Sceptile, Entei, Emboar, Galvantula, and Gallade, though the full list is very extensive. It's best to have multiple Pokemon on the team that can take advantage of Smeargle's boosts, particularly the Speed boost. For example, passing a Quiver Dance boost to Gallade if the opponent has an Aerodactyl on the field is the better play than passing to Cryogonal, the latter of which would typically be able to \"better make use of\" the pass. Always play to the opponent and don't try to complete a mission when using a short pass Pokemon like Smeargle; this is distinctly different from trying to complete a Baton Pass chain.</p> "

      {
        "name": "FEARgle (Level 1)",
        "description": "<p>This set nearly guarantees that Trick Room will be set up, the few exceptions being if the opponent has Taunt, a sleep inducing move, or multi-hit move. A weird set at first glance, this ability to almost always set up Trick Room immediately and get out of the way is fantastic for more offensively oriented Trick Room teams. The typical sequence of moves is such: Smeargle sets up Trick Room, puts a Pokemon to sleep with Spore, brings a Pokemon down to low health with Endeavor, and finally KOes those with less than 40 HP with Dragon Rage (which is every Pokemon hit by Endeavor even with Leftovers taken into account). However, Dragon Rage will rarely see use in most games as the opponent will be unlikely to allow Smeargle to use more than 3 moves in a row, the exception being if the opponent switches into Smeargle as it sets up Trick Room. Memento can be used in place of Dragon Rage to get Smeargle out of the way as quickly as possible and allow a teammate to get in safely. Magic Coat is neat as it gets priority and blocks Taunt and phazing moves, creating a larger window for Smeargle to set up Trick Room and begin its shenanigans.</p> <p>Smeargle should be at level 1 to make sure its HP is as low as possible, as well as making it as slow as possible. Speed is still maxed for the rare circumstance when there is a level 1 Smeargle vs Smeargle showdown. Focus Sash is the only item that will work here and assures that Smeargle sets up Trick Room; after Focus Sash is broken, Smeargle will fall to any priority move not named Sucker Punch even in Trick Room. Other alternative moveslot options to use over Dragon Rage include Destiny Bond and entry hazards. Destiny Bond ensures that the opponent will get dragged down with Smeargle as it goes out. If you don't want to place Stealth Rock elsewhere on your team or want a layer of Spikes, Smeargle can accomplish that as well before going down.</p> <p>Ghost-types are immune to Endeavor and are thus the best answers to Smeargle after Spore has been used on something else. Spiritomb and other Pursuit trappers such as Escavalier thus make good partners for Smeargle, though Smeargle is a supporter first and foremost, so this is not required. This set is best used on a full Trick Room team, making other Trick Room setters such as Slowking, Exeggutor, Uxie, and Mesprit ideal teammates. Slow sweepers are also needed, great examples include Aggron, Druddigon, Escavalier, and Bouffalant.</p> "

  "Miltank": {
    "overview": "<p>Miltank has basically been doing the same job since her first appearance: supporting her teammates with her great supportive moves. With access to Heal Bell and Stealth Rock, Miltank can provide valuable entry hazard and cleric support to almost any team in need of it. Miltank also has great stats to work with, boasting 95 / 105 / 70 defenses that allow her to take on a huge variety of offensive threats in the tier. Additionally, Miltank is one of the few Pokemon blessed with three great abilities, each with their pros and cons. Despite her great defensive traits, Miltank still has her fair share of letdowns. A Normal typing is not the best defensive typing, as it doesn't give Miltank any useful resistances other than Ghost, while she has a crippling Fighting-type weakness. Miltank also faces stiff competition from Clefable in the supportive role, as Clefable has access to the same moves, as well as Magic Guard and Wish on top of that. Despite this, Miltank still pulls off her defensive role with great success, and while she does face competition from other Normal-types, Miltank has her own advantages, including being able to go on the offensive.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The first thing that comes to mind when one looks at Miltank's other options is the combination of Curse and Scrappy. Curse boosts Miltank's Attack and Defense, and Scrappy allows her to hit Ghost-types with her STAB moves. While this might look good on paper due to the combination of Curse, Milk Drink, and Heal Bell making her impossible to take down without a strong special attack, it is not in practice. The amount of support Miltank will need for this set to work is huge, and the amounts of boosts she will need to be threatening are hard to obtain and it is not hard to stop her from setting up. In short, Curse + Scrappy Miltank is way too situational to be worth the trouble. Rock Slide is a nice move for the Mootility set to instantly KO Moltres after it has taken Stealth Rock damage; otherwise, it is a 2HKO. However, it will be hard to find room for Rock Slide as the moves already mentioned above are far more usable than a move for one specific threat. When it comes to the Moofensive set, Double-Edge and Return will get the same job done. Miltank also has several other physical moves available to her, such as Zen Headbutt and Thunder Punch, but most of them are redundant in coverage while Double-Edge will do more damage most of the time. Much like other supportive Pokemon, Miltank has access to Rain Dance and Sunny Day and can effectively give weather support to a team. In combination with Stealth Rock and Heal Bell, it will be very useful support for most weather-based teams, but for those types of teams only. Block is a very, very gimmicky option that can help in trapping a frailer opponent for a Pursuit user to KO. Counter is another gimmick, but can definitely catch physically offensive beasts such as Aggron and Escavalier for a surprise KO. However, it can't be stressed enough how situational these two moves are compared to the more useful moves that have been mentioned. Counter can't even be used with Sap Sipper either. Much like any other Normal-type, Miltank's movepool is filled with strong special moves such as Thunderbolt, Shadow Ball, and Focus Blast. Miltank even has Work Up to boost its Special Attack; however, Miltank's Special Attack lies at a pitiful base 40, which makes a special attacking set impossible to pull off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When it comes to taking Miltank down, there are several good candidates despite her solid traits (Speed and bulk); however, some Pokemon can only handle one of Miltank's two sets. Fighting-types are the biggest threats to both defensive and offensive Miltank. The likes of Gallade, Hitmonlee, and Medicham have no trouble OHKOing the Mootility set with their Fighting-type moves. The Moofensive set, however, is a tougher nut to crack for the Fighting-types. Due to Miltank's high Speed stat, no Fighting-type in the RU tier can outspeed her without the aid of a Choice Scarf. To make matters worse, Miltank can OHKO the frailer Fighting-types, such as Gallade and Hitmonlee, with Double-Edge even without a boost most of the time. Medicham and Emboar, who often wield a Choice Scarf, can outspeed and OHKO Miltank with ease though, and the same applies for Hitmonlee who has activated Unburden. Other, faster Pokemon with strong Fighting-type moves can also threaten Miltank in a similar manner. Special attackers such as Sceptile and Typhlosion can use Focus Blast to 2HKO any defensive version of Miltank, while easily OHKOing offensive ones. Misdreavus and Rotom give any Miltank trouble, as their typing and ability make them immune to the combination of Body Slam / Double-Edge / Return + Earthquake, which means Miltank can't touch them (without Scrappy). While Miltank can hit them with Fire Punch, bulky versions of Rotom are only 3HKOed while Misdreavus is only 4HKOed at +1. On top of that, they both have access to both Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split, making it impossible for Miltank to beat them. Spiritomb functions in a similar way, except it can be hit by Earthquake. However, despite being hit by Earthquake, Spiritomb's bulk and access to Will-O-Wisp make taking it down a hard task for Miltank, as it can't do anything but 3HKO the defensive versions if it can avoid being burned. Choice Band versions of Spiritomb can even Trick their item to Miltank, shutting down Mootility versions completely.</p> <p>Durant is a huge threat to all Miltank as well. Durant's Superpower will OHKO both the specially defensive version and the offensive version of Miltank; Durant is faster than Miltank as well, so Miltank can't hit it first either. However, Durant must be careful of Fire Punch, as offensive versions of Miltank can OHKO it on a predicted switch or if Durant tries to set up with Hone Claws and Miltank stays in. Escavalier will also give Miltank trouble. Miltank can barely scratch Escavalier without Fire Punch, even with Earthquake. However, if Miltank does carry Fire Punch, Escavalier will need to make sure Miltank has taken damage beforehand as Escavalier does 95% at most with a Choice Band-boosted Megahorn; otherwise, it will get 2HKOed by Fire Punch. Aggron is another offensive behemoth that gives Miltank trouble. Its Choice Band-boosted Head Smash can OHKO specially defensive versions of Miltank after Stealth Rock, while the rare physically defensive ones are 2HKOed. What Aggron needs to watch out for is Earthquake, as Miltank can 2HKO it, meaning Aggron needs to be careful switching in. Moltres is another huge threat to Miltank. Despite Miltank's specially defensive nature, a Life Orb-boosted Hurricane can still easily 2HKO her if it hits. Flamethrower won't be much of a nuisance, especially if Miltank has Thick Fat, while Moltres needs to be wary of paralysis from Body Slam and stray Rock Slides. Substitute + Calm Mind Uxie can easily take advantage of defensive Miltank's lack of power and set up with Calm Mind without any trouble. However, if Miltank does use Seismic Toss, it will be more troublesome for Uxie to set up on her. The offensive version of Miltank has trouble with certain physically bulky threats. While Miltank can take advantage of Tangrowth's Grass-type moves, Miltank still has a hard time against it. Double-Edge can barely 2HKO Tangrowth with Stealth Rock on the field, resulting in 3HKOs more often than 2HKOs. The same premise applies to Alomomola as well, except it doesn't have any moves that Miltank can take advantage of and Alomomola can even burn her with Scald. Steelix is another troublesome foe, despite Miltank's access to Earthquake. Miltank can only 3HKO Steelix at +1 with Earthquake, while Steelix has no trouble wearing Miltank down with Gyro Ball and Life Orb recoil and can even resort to phazing Miltank out. Poliwrath, while 2HKOed by Double-Edge at +1, is still a solid answer, as it can phaze Miltank out with Circle Throw. If Miltank lacks a boost from Sap Sipper, the four aforementioned Pokemon will outright beat Miltank.</p> ",

Stealth Rock is the most vital move that Miltank brings to the table, as it is a great move to wear down incoming Pokemon for any team; what sets her apart from Clefable is her higher Speed stat, and with that, higher insurance of getting Stealth Rock up on the field. Milk Drink gives Miltank her much needed recovery move, while Body Slam is a great offensive move for Miltank to use; not only does it prevent Miltank from becoming completely shut down by Taunt, it also has a nice 30% chance to paralyze the foe, basically eliminating the need for Thunder Wave completely. The last move of choice basically comes down to what the team needs. If status is a major hindrance for your team's sweepers and other defensive Pokemon, Heal Bell is another great support move to use to remove any unwanted status. If there is minimal need of cleric support from Heal Bell, Earthquake is a useful move for Miltank to use against Pokemon such as Entei, Aggron, Lanturn, Magneton, and Emboar; with Earthquake, some of these Pokemon become much easier to deal with for Miltank, as Body Slam might not cut it most of the time.</p> <p>Seismic Toss is a great option to deal more consistent damage against Pokemon such as Steelix and Rhydon, as well as Pokemon such as Substitute + Calm Mind Uxie, to name a few. Thunder Wave and Toxic can also find their uses to give the team some additional support. Thunder Wave allows Miltank to cripple opposing sweepers, allowing Miltank to outspeed them and heal herself before taking a hit. Thunder Wave also helps slightly slower sweepers on Miltank's team in their sweeping. On the other hand, Toxic helps in breaking down bulkier foes such as Slowking. The choice between Thick Fat and Sap Sipper depends solely on what threats you want Miltank to handle for your team. If your team has trouble with the various Fire-types in the tier, Thick Fat is the most optimal option. However, if Grass-types are the bane of the team, then Sap Sipper is the better choice. Sap Sipper also makes Miltank a great answer to Smeargle and Amoonguss, who become less prone to throw Spore around. The EV spread is tailored for Miltank to be faster than Pokemon such as Adamant Absol and Jolly Emboar, which allows her to restore her HP before taking a second hit, while Miltank can also hit back if given the chance. Despite Miltank's great bulk, some powerful special moves, such as Moltres's Hurricane, can 2HKO her, so be careful switching her in. This also applies to Pokemon commonly using Focus Blast for coverage, such as Typhlosion, Sceptile, and Tangrowth; all three 2HKO Miltank with Focus Blast. A faster EV spread of 252 HP / 80 SpD / 176 Spe with a Jolly nature can also be used, as it allows Miltank to outspeed key threats such as Entei and Moltres. While not the most optimal EV spread, it can still be effective due to Miltank's natural bulk and Thick Fat.</p> <p>Miltank is a good fit on most teams in general. Basically, if your team need the support she provides, for example a Grass-type immunity or a Stealth Rock setter, she will most likely fit. Water-types such as Poliwrath, Feraligatr, and Kabutops, who struggle with Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, appreciate Miltank's ability to absorb their Grass-type moves. Other fast sweepers who are crippled by Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, and Spore coming from these Pokemon also benefit from Miltank's Sap Sipper. The same goes for Grass- and Steel-types when Miltank is using Thick Fat. Fire-types such as Entei can't break through, giving Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Escavalier a little more breathing space. While some Fire-types have super effective coverage against Miltank, such as Typhlosion and Magmortar with Focus Blast and Emboar with Superpower, they have to rely on Focus Blast's shaky accuracy, and in Emboar's case, Choice Scarf to outspeed Miltank. In tandem with this, Ghost-types help Miltank out a lot, as they are immune to Miltank's sole weakness to Fighting-type moves. When it comes to selecting a Ghost-types, four come to mind: Rotom, Spiritomb, Golurk, and Misdreavus. Rotom and Spiritomb are pretty straightforward choices as what they are using doesn't really matter to Miltank; however, Choice Band versions of Spiritomb are especially efficient at handling Fighting-types, more specifically Gallade and Medicham. Golurk and Misdreavus aren't as commonly used, but they pair well with Miltank in more ways than just covering her weakness. Golurk is a excellent user of Stealth Rock as well, which relieves Miltank of a moveslot. Misdreavus works in the same way, as it has access to Heal Bell. On the plus side, Misdreavus also commonly takes on a physically defensive role, complementing Miltank's specially defensive nature. As a last note, a fully physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 192 Def / 64 Spe with an Impish nature can work, allowing Miltank to handle physically offensive threats, such as Entei and Sceptile, more easily. However, Miltank will struggle to survive against powerhouses such as Aggron, Escavalier, and Durant without a proper response. If this is something you want to try, and you want something to hit Escavalier and Durant with, Fire Punch is your best bet. Fire Punch allows Miltank to 2HKO both of them; however, Durant has the possibility to OHKO Miltank in return with Superpower, so beware.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Miltank is often seen on the defensive, she is no slouch on the offensive. Her great Speed stat combined with Sap Sipper and high-powered moves make Miltank a potent threat. With Grass-type moves such as Spore, Sleep Powder, and Leech Seed being very common in the tier, gaining an Attack boost is not a hard task. Miltank also sits at a comfortable base 100 Speed stat, allowing her to outspeed Pokemon such as Moltres, Sigilyph, and Adamant Entei, while she Speed ties with Typhlosion and other base 100 Speed Pokemon. Double-Edge is Miltank's best choice when it comes to a STAB move, as the high Base Power of the move makes Miltank hit extremely hard after a boost. However, Double-Edge has a drawback in that recoil damage will wear Miltank down faster, making Return a good substitute if you want Miltank to last longer. Earthquake rounds out Miltank's coverage well, hitting the Steel- and Rock-types that resist her STAB move for super effective damage, with the exception of Aerodactyl, Archeops, Rotom, and Misdreavus. Milk Drink works great in tandem with Miltank's natural bulk and the fact that it will recover all recoil damage she receives from Double-Edge and Life Orb.</p> <p>When it comes to Miltank's last move, it really should be tailored to what your team needs or what Miltank's teammates can cover for her. Heal Bell keeps Miltank free from crippling status such as burn and paralysis, which would otherwise make her offensive presence more or less non-existent. At the same time, she is keeping her teammates free from status as well. Fire Punch is great offensive option to widen Miltank's coverage, making the two offensive monsters Escavalier and Durant much easier to deal with. Escavalier is 2HKOed by Fire Punch without an Attack boost, while it is OHKOed by Miltank at +1. Durant is OHKOed regardless. Fire Punch is mostly used to handle Escavalier as Durant is faster than Miltank, but Fire Punch can nail it on a predicted switch. Stealth Rock is a viable option if your team is in need of a fast setter, or if the team is pressed for a slot for the move. Both Heal Bell and Fire Punch are more helpful for Miltank herself as they cover one huge obstacle for her each, so Stealth Rock should only be considered if you really need it.</p> <p>Ice Punch is the next best thing when it comes to coverage for Miltank. Ice Punch allows Miltank to hit Golurk, who is immune to Double-Edge and takes neutral damage by Miltank's other moves, for super effective damage. However, due to Golurk's great bulk, it is only 2HKOed at best when it has heavy HP investment (which it usually does), while a 4 HP / 0 Def Golurk is only OHKOed 50% of the time at full health. It's a shaky option, but it can still be useful and can come in handy if Miltank's teammates can cover up the lack of coverage on other Pokemon. Due to its ability and desire to absorb incoming Grass-type moves, Miltank pairs well with Water- and Ground-type Pokemon. Rock-types also benefit from this, but the majority of the Rock-types in the tier, like Aggron and Aerodactyl, are neutral to Grass. Good examples of these types of Pokemon are Kabutops, Omastar, Poliwrath, Qwilfish, Golurk, and Regirock, who more or less have a hard time against the common Grass-types Tangrowth, Sceptile, Lilligant, Amoonguss, and Ferroseed. Several of these Pokemon can also provide useful or even vital support back to Miltank. For example, Qwilfish, Omastar, and Regirock can set up Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Stealth Rock, respectively, to wear down the opposing Pokemon, making it easier for Miltank to take down defensive behemoths such as Tangrowth and Alomomola by pushing them into 2HKO range. Pokemon such as Poliwrath and Golurk cover key threats for Miltank thanks to their good typings; Poliwrath takes attacks from Escavalier with ease if Miltank lacks Fire Punch, while Golurk patches up Miltank's sole Fighting-type weakness, being able to take on most Fighting-types such as Unburden Hitmonlee and Choice Scarf Medicham reliably.</p> <p>Teammates that can patch up the holes that Miltank's moves leave are essential. The first weaknesses to cover are Rotom and the less common Misdreavus. These two flat-out wall Miltank even if she carries Fire Punch; however, this is only true for the bulky Rotom set, as the more common Choice Scarf and SubSplit sets are 2HKOed by Fire Punch at +1. Both the bulky version of Rotom and Misdreavus are impossible for Miltank to take down, due to their good bulk, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split. To free Miltank from these two, it is best to use Dark-type Pokemon such as Spiritomb and Absol. They can quickly take down any opposing Ghost-type with their powerful Dark-type moves and Pursuit trapping abilities. Opposing Spiritomb are a little harder to take down due to their bulk and lack of weaknesses, and they are much easier to deal with by wearing them down with status. Pokemon such as standard defensive Slowking and Tangrowth should have no trouble with this. Choice Scarf-wielding Fighting-types such as Medicham and Emboar, as well as Unburden Hitmonlee, are huge, huge threats due to their greater Speed. Bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types are the most reliable answers, with the aforementioned Slowking, Spiritomb, and Golurk, as well as Uxie, Musharna, and Mesprit, being the best to choose from. These Pokemon together with Gallade and Medicham can also reliably take on bulkier Fighting-types such as Poliwrath and Hariyama who can give Miltank trouble as well, as she can only 2HKO these two at best. If Miltank lacks Fire Punch, strong Fire-types and bulky Water-types can help her take down Escavalier, Durant, and Ferroseed, respectively. Moltres, Entei, and Emboar can easily KO these three. While Moltres and Entei can't outspeed Durant for the KO and must watch out for Rock Slide, Choice Scarf Emboar can outspeed and make quick work of it. Poliwrath and Alomomola are the best choices for a bulky Water-type when it comes to dealing with Durant and Escavalier. Due to their sheer bulk and resistances to Durant and Escavalier Steel-type STAB, and in Poliwrath's case, their Bug-type STAB as well, Alomomola and Poliwrath will be almost impossible for them to take down. They can also cover roadblocks such as Steelix, which can be hard for Miltank to take down as well.</p> "

  "Linoone": {
    "overview": "<p>In the depths of the RU tier lies an often overlooked Pokemon, one that trainers typically wouldn't hesitate to release after the first gym. This Pokemon is none other than Linoone, and while it may seem cute and harmless, it's anything but. After one turn of setup with its rare boosting move, Belly Drum, Linoone can easily tear most teams to pieces. What's more, due to STAB Extreme Speed, it's less vulnerable to being revenge killed than other Belly Drummers after a boost. Linoone is not unstoppable, however; there are plenty of Pokemon that can put its rampage to a stop. Linoone also needs some help to begin its sweep in the first place, as it is incredibly frail. If you can provide Linoone with the support it needs to unleash its potential, however, it won't hesitate to drive your opponent up a tree, in fear that is.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Belly Drum is Linoone's only viable option, as most other sets are too weak. A Choice Band set can be used, but Linoone's power is sadly lacking. Iron Tail can be used to hit Rock-types hard, but Seed Bomb already does this. Flail is an option with Substitute, but hazards and priority make this difficult to set up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Despite Linoone's incredible power, there are many things that can stop it. Perhaps the best chance you have against an opposing Linoone is to prevent it from setting up entirely. As its defenses aren't the best around, strong STAB or Fighting-type attacks will take it down, even behind dual screens. Once Linoone has set up a Belly Drum, Steelix is perhaps its most solid counter; even after setup, Linoone's attacks deal little damage to Steelix, which can proceed to Roar out Linoone, forcing it to sacrifice half its health. Tangrowth is a pretty good check, as it can tank a hit and counter with Sleep Powder or KO with Power Whip. Scarf Rotom and the less common Scarf Haunter are immune to Extreme Speed and can revenge kill Linoone once it has set up. Finally, as Unaware Quagsire ignores Belly Drum's stat boost, it is only 3HKOed by Seed Bomb.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Belly Drum Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>This is the key to sweeping with Linoone; once it sets up a Belly Drum, it can cleanly sweep with Extreme Speed. Even though Linoone's STAB move has +2 priority, investing in Speed is crucial, as the investment lets Linoone outrun a variety of things it would not be able to otherwise, the most notable being Rotom, who Linoone can decimate with a +6 Shadow Claw, and Entei, who Linoone can destroy with a +6 Extreme Speed. Almost all variants of Entei run an Adamant nature regardless, so a Speed tie isn't likely to come up. A Silk Scarf allows Linoone to hit much harder with Extreme Speed without the recoil of Life Orb, while Lum Berry gives Linoone a cushion against status users that may try to cripple it. Shadow Claw allows it to hit bulky Ghost-types, such as Dusknoir and Misdreavus, where it hurts, and at +6 it will surely hurt a lot. The last move depends on who you want Linoone to be able to take down; Seed Bomb allows Linoone to beat Rhydon into submission, while Rock Smash makes any Aggron trying to switch into Extreme Speed cry. Return is a secondary STAB move that hits much harder than Extreme Speed. The extra power allows Linoone to OHKO bulky foes that Extreme Speed could not, and it therefore works well along with Lum Berry. Sitrus Berry is also an option that can give Linoone a decent amount of health after it uses Belly Drum, which can give it enough to survive weak hits from walls.</p> <p>Despite having the potential to be an incredibly powerful sweeper, Linoone requires a fair amount of support if it is to to succeed. First of all, Linoone loves dual screens, and can set up much more easily behind them; Swoobat and Uxie are excellent examples of teammates that can set up screens for Linoone. Uxie has better defenses and access to Stealth Rock, while Swoobat has access to Taunt and U-turn for scouting purposes, backed up by an excellent base 114 Speed. Linoone loves trappers that can get rid of Pokemon that threaten it. For instance, Drapion's Pursuit makes short work of Rotom and Haunter, while Magneton can trap and KO Steel-types such as Ferroseed. Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Gallade also complement Linoone well, busting up the walls and Steel-types that the latter cannot. Wynaut provides a unique form of support; it can assist Linoone by Encoring non-attacking moves, by softening up opponents with Tickle, or even by shielding Linoone from status with Safeguard. Linoone loves entry hazards even more than the average sweeper because these allow it to score KOs on some bulky walls, such as Tangrowth and Spiritomb. Some examples of Linoone's power are shown below with damage calculations:</p> <ul> <li>+6 Silk Scarf Extreme Speed vs. 252 / 252+ Tangrowth 69.8% - 82.4% (likely OHKO with Stealth Rock and 1 layer of Spikes) <li>+6 Silk Scarf Extreme Speed vs. 252 / 176+ Clefable 110.4% - 130.2% (guaranteed OHKO)</li> <li>+6 Seed Bomb vs. 252 / 192+ Spiritomb 54.6 - 64.47% (guaranteed 2HKO)</li> </ul> "

  "Ludicolo": {
    "overview": "<p>Throughout the generations, Ludicolo has established itself as one of the faces of rain offense—its trademark STAB combo, exquisite Swift Swim ability, and marvelous coverage all play a role in making it one of the most destructive rain sweepers in RU. Don't be under the impression that Ludicolo is just limited to dedicated rain teams, however, as it is fully capable of utilizing its unique blend of offensive characteristics to function as a potent, standalone sweeper all the same. Moreover, Ludicolo possesses solid bulk for an offensive Pokemon; this in turn eases its ability to set up Rain Dance and lay down a heavy beating on the opposing team. Unfortunately, Ludicolo's greatest asset is also its most crippling flaw. Despite that fact that Ludicolo performs superbly under the rain, that is pretty much all it can do—it can only function in rain, and as a result, it must dedicate a moveslot for Rain Dance, restricting Ludicolo's options to a certain degree. To make matters worse, Ludicolo's Special Attack is nothing short of mediocre, which makes it difficult to OHKO quite a few threats even with a rain-boosted Hydro Pump. Regardless of its shortcomings, Ludicolo is one of the most self-sufficient Pokemon there is; very little support is required to turn it into a late-game wrecking ball.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ludicolo's signature typing and overall acceptable bulk allows it to run a unique specially defensive set by making use of its Rain Dish ability along with Scald, Giga Drain, and any combination of Protect, Leech Seed, Ice Beam, and Synthesis. This allows it to counter specially based Water-types such as Omastar, Slowking, Lanturn, and opposing Ludicolo. In addition, it can also check the likes of Magmortar, Manectric, Magneton, and Mesprit. However, the defensive set falls short in that it lacks resistances to a slew of other special attacks—specially based Bug-types and boosting sweepers in particular greatly detract from the usefulness of such a set. Moreover, other specially defensive walls such as Clefable, Slowking, and Amoonguss give the set varying degrees of competition.</p> <p>A Swords Dance set is an interesting take on Ludicolo's offensive capabilities, given that Ludicolo can hit many of RU's premier physical walls—Alomomola, Rhydon, Poliwrath—super effectively with its STABs alone. Ludicolo's physical movepool is also surprisingly extravagant, including good STAB moves in Waterfall, Bullet Seed, and Seed Bomb, as well as interesting coverage attacks in Drain Punch, Zen Headbutt, Focus Punch, and the three elemental punches. Yet, the main issue with the Swords Dance set is quite simple: Ludicolo's base 70 Attack stat is quite pathetic. The more notable issue is that Ludicolo is already a proficient sweeper with its standard set alone, not to mention that taking the time to set up Swords Dance will whittle away precious rain turns.</p> <p>Lastly, Ludicolo can try out Toxic and Substitute. Toxic can be useful to cripple the likes of Druddigon and Cryogonal, but most of Ludicolo's checks are immune to the move. A more cautionary move is Substitute. Substitute can be used to block out paralysis-inducing moves and shield Ludicolo from priority attacks; however, Ludicolo simply doesn't have the room on its standard set to pull it off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When Ludicolo is under rain, it is surprisingly difficult to stop due to its great coverage, rain-boosted attacks, and insane Speed. It is usually better to play around Ludicolo by pivot switching around its attacks to draw out the rain turns and take advantage of the Life Orb recoil to wear it down even further. Entry hazards in general and especially Toxic Spikes are also useful at limiting Ludicolo's time on the battlefield; Roselia in particular can double up as a Ludicolo check and a superb Toxic Spikes user. In regards to pivot switching around Ludicolo, Regenerator cores—especially Amoonguss and Slowking—work quite well at abusing Ludicolo's Life Orb. On their own, Amoonguss and Roselia are usually your best bets at checking Ludicolo because they resist its STABs, can take an Ice Beam at full health, and 2HKO with Sludge Bomb. However, don't go switching either of the two directly in on Ludicolo, as a rain-boosted Hydro Pump followed by an Ice Beam will lead to their demise after a little bit of prior damage. Ferroseed can also tank Ludicolo's attacks fairly well; on the other hand, it fails at doing much of anything to Ludicolo should it lack Thunder Wave and will instead find itself easily worn out due to its lack of Leftovers and recovery. Speaking of paralysis, two Pokemon that can easily take a hit from Ludicolo at full health and cripple it are Clefable and Druddigon.</p> <p>One of the more effective, offensively inclined checks is Unburden Hitmonlee. Hitmonlee can't directly switch in on Ludicolo; however, it does not fail at checking it if it comes in unscathed. For instance, Hitmonlee can use its Normal Gem-boosted Fake Out to activate its Unburden ability, and from there, it can proceed to demolish Ludicolo with its STAB Close Combat. Similarly, Choice Scarf Durant has a bit of difficulty switching in, but it can outrun Ludicolo and OHKO with its Bug-type STAB moves. Be warned that if Ludicolo uses a Timid nature, Durant will fail to outspeed Ludicolo and will find itself washed away by its powerful Hydro Pump. Choice Scarf Cinccino can outrun Ludicolo in the rain regardless of the nature it opts for, though Ludicolo must be weakened a bit in order to be put in KO range. Finally, as a last resort, powerful priority users such as Entei and Absol can revenge kill a worn out Ludicolo.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Swift Swim Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>This set works superbly as a late-game cleaner with the aid of rain, as it gives Ludicolo the raw speed and power to eradicate the opposing team at a moment's notice. When attempting to use Rain Dance, it is advised to only do so against relatively weaker special attackers such as Manectric and Uxie. There are certain situations where it's better to just straight-up attack the opponent as opposed to setting up Rain Dance. One of the prime examples is when Ludicolo is up against weakened Pokemon that might choose to recover and thus become better equipped at stalling Ludicolo's rain turns; some notable Pokemon include Clefable and Cryogonal. Other situations are when Ludicolo is up against slower threats that can potentially KO or cripple it if given a free turn—both Escavalier and Druddigon are key threats to watch out for. Once Ludicolo has successfully set up Rain Dance, it is best to analyze the opposing team with Team Preview and determine which attack is most opportunistic. For instance, if the opposing team only has a single Water- resist as opposed to two or three Grass-type resists, then it is clear that Hydro Pump is the better move to continually utilize should the opponent choose to pivot switch around Ludicolo. Giga Drain is interesting in that it dilutes Life Orb recoil and is one of the main reasons why Ludicolo is so potent as a rain sweeper. The ability to simultaneously replenish health, attack, and mow down opposing Water-types that give rain teams headaches is invaluable. Lastly, Ice Beam quickly decimates the likes of Sceptile and Druddigon and should only be used if Ludicolo is against such threats, or if an obvious Amoonguss or Roselia switch-in attempts to ruin the fun.</p> <p>The most useful nature is Modest because the extra speed granted by a Timid nature isn't necessary most of the time; however, a Timid nature can be valuable in that it allows Ludicolo to outspeed and OHKO the likes of Choice Scarf Durant and Manectric in the rain as well as other speedy Choice Scarf users, and outspeed neutral base 80s such as Kabutops. This is useful so that Ludicolo can outspeed and OHKO the previously mentioned threat as opposed to taking a Stone Edge to the face. Do note that if Ludicolo opts for a Timid nature, the drop in power prevents Ludicolo from 2HKOing the likes of Roselia and Amoonguss with the combination of a rain-boosted Hydro Pump followed by a Life Orb-boosted Ice Beam after Stealth Rock, and thus makes it much easier to check.</p> <p>While Hydro Pump is easily Ludicolo's most powerful attack, if the 80% accuracy is a turnoff, Ludicolo can instead invest in Surf as its more reliable Water-type STAB. Another move Ludicolo can put to good use is Focus Blast. Focus Blast is notable in that it allows Ludicolo to bypass one of its better checks—Ferroseed. Focus Blast also finds use in situations where Ludicolo is without rain and must take out a weakened Cryogonal or Clefable. In terms of item substitutions, Damp Rock is useful on dedicated rain teams where Ludicolo can function as an interesting offensive supporter, although, Ludicolo will miss its Life Orb dearly because it will lose out on the ability to OHKO 0 / 0 Gallade and 156 / 0 Bouffalant with a rain-boosted Hydro Pump.</p> <p>On dedicated rain teams, Uxie and Volbeat work as effective partners. Volbeat can utilize its Prankster ability to set up rain as quickly as possible, and from there, it can use its slow U-turn to get Ludicolo in safely or attempt to pass Ludicolo a nasty Tail Glow boost. Uxie lacks Volbeat's Prankster ability; however, its excellent bulk in comparison means that it will almost always set up Rain Dance against even the most powerful foes (lacking Taunt). Uxie also possess other advantages over Volbeat; the most notable is having the ability to set up entry hazards in the form of Stealth Rock; this makes it difficult for the opponent to continually switch around Ludicolo. In terms of offensive partners, both Qwilfish and Kabutops can team up with Ludicolo to form a vicious Swift Swim core. Kabutops and Qwilfish can take on annoying special walls such as Cryogonal and Clefable; Kabutops benefits the core even further by removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin; Qwilfish makes use of its Poison-type STABs to smash through opposing Grass-types and can take down a troublesome threat such as Ferroseed with the use of Destiny Bond.</p> <p>Seeing as how Ludicolo isn't just limited to dedicated rain teams, there are a few other non-rain-exclusive partners that can be just as effective. The first two partners that work well with Ludicolo are Medicham and Gallade. Medicham and Gallade can use their STABs to easily take out Ludicolo's checks—Roselia and Amoonguss in particular won't enjoy taking a Psycho Cut. Moreover, both Gallade and Medicham can use their Fighting-type STABs to destroy Ferroseed, Clefable, and Cryogonal. While it might seem strange to pair a Fire-type such as Moltres with Ludicolo, Moltres can function surprisingly well under rain due to Hurricane's accuracy being increased to 100%. Moltres works effectively as a partner for many other reasons as well. Moltres can easily OHKO every Grass-type in the tier, use its wallbreaking prowess to soften up Ludicolo's opponents, and lure in defensive Water-types such as Lanturn to give Ludicolo better opportunities to set up.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>In a tier with plenty of viable Grass-types available, one might wonder how a Pokemon like Shiftry might stand out with its modest base stats. However, Shiftry has plenty of things going for it in the current metagame. Blessed with an outstanding offensive typing, shared only by Cacturne, and good physical and special prowess, Shiftry proves to be a versatile Pokemon. Shiftry is capable of pressuring the opponents to try and play around it, not knowing what set it might be running. Common defensive Pokemon such as Slowking and Clefable are smashed by Shiftry, making it a formidable wallbreaker. Its ability to bypass bulky opponents that its competition cannot effectively do makes it stand out from the pack.</p> <p>However, this nutcracker isn't exactly the toughest to crack. It has terrible bulk, meaning any strong attack will bring Shiftry down quickly. Its great offensive typing also curses it with weaknesses to the common Bug-, Fire-, and Fighting-type moves found in the tier. The few Pokemon that can defeat Shiftry are common and they handle it extremely well, meaning it usually will not be able to function without proper team support. Finally, Shiftry Speed ties with common Pokemon such as Kabutops, Gallade, and Mesprit, causing it to run into many 50-50 situations where luck will determine whether Shiftry wins or loses. However, if you want something that can reliably do its part for your team, whether it be cleanup late-game or cripple opposing walls, you should definitely consider Shiftry.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shiftry has a wide array of other options in its arsenal, but the problem is it generally doesn't excel at any of them. An offensive SubSeed set seems interesting on Shiftry, but it is easy to play around with due to Shiftry's terrible defensive capabilities. A Choice item, such as Choice Scarf or Choice Specs, would help improve Shiftry's middling Speed and average Special Attack, respectively. However, Shiftry does not appreciate being locked into one move and the best use for it is within its dual Grass / Dark STAB and the ability to switch around its moves. Nasty Plot is an interesting move on Shiftry but is overall less effective than Swords Dance. A set utilizing Growth is usable for mixed variants, but it is rather useless outside of sun and it takes away from Shiftry's valuable moveslots. Shiftry has access to Tailwind and Whirlwind, which are both good options for either aiding Shiftry's team further or forcing setup sweepers out. However, Tailwind is better used on a teammate with higher defenses, and Whirlwind is useless given the fact that few Pokemon will want to set up on Shiftry anyway. Toxic and Knock Off would be good for further crippling walls, but Shiftry prefers all-out offense and they are hard to fit on its set due Shiftry's limited number of moveslots. Finally, thanks to Early Bird, Shiftry can use Rest to replenish damage taken from Life Orb recoil and entry hazards, but this strategy is too unreliable due to Shiftry's terrible defenses.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>If you want to stop Shiftry in its tracks, the first thing to do is evaluate what set it's running. Amoonguss is possibly Shiftry's biggest counter, capable of coming in on practically any move and forcing Shiftry out while regaining any HP lost with Regenerator. Mandibuzz also has the bulk to shrug off any of Shiftry's moves and can either Whirlwind Shiftry out to remove its boosts or deal a large amount of damage to Shiftry with Brave Bird. Escavalier, Scolipede, and Durant are able to threaten Shiftry out with their powerful Bug-type STAB moves, but they must be wary of Hidden Power Fire. Druddigon generally takes little damage from most of Shiftry's attacks and can threaten Shiftry with its high Attack stat or crippling moves like Glare. Steelix and Tangrowth are great for taking on the Swords Dance set, as they both take little damage from any of Shiftry's moves. Steelix can Roar Shiftry out to remove its boosts, while Tangrowth will outright beat Shiftry and switch out to regain lost HP. Fire-types also ruin Shiftry's day when they can switch in. Moltres, Entei, and Choice Scarf Emboar are all faster than Shiftry and easily get rid of it, while defensive Emboar takes little from Shiftry's attacks and threatens back with either of its STAB moves. Drapion is also a good all-purpose check for Shiftry lacking Nature Power as it resists Shiftry's STAB moves and threatens it with its own STAB Poison-type moves. Finally, Substitute users like Rotom, Sceptile, and Bouffalant are shaky checks, but they can easily play around Shiftry's Sucker Punch and can either cripple or outright KO it.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Shiftry is an effective late-game sweeper, as its typing allows it to take on a wide array of Pokemon in the tier after a Swords Dance boost. It is one of the few viable Pokemon that gets STAB Sucker Punch, meaning it has strong priority that allows it to pick off the remaining members of your opponent's team. Seed Bomb is a reliable Grass-type STAB move that hits many Pokemon that other Swords Dance sweepers such as Absol can't take on such as Poliwrath and Alomomola. Nature Power always turns into Earthquake, and is Shiftry's best option in taking down Fire-types like Entei while also dealing solid damage to Steel-types such as Steelix and Klinklang.</p> <p>Early Bird is the most useful of Shiftry's abilities, giving it less hassle with sleep inducers like Lilligant carrying Hidden Power Rock. Chlorophyll is a decent option if Shiftry is being used on a sun team, but that is a harder archetype to play with in the current metagame. Life Orb is given to Shiftry to allow it to deal heavy damage and use its powerful moves interchangeably. Lum Berry is another useful option, as it gives Shiftry an advantage against status inducers and Scald users that flock throughout RU. An Adamant nature gives Shiftry the most attacking power needed to burst through the opponent at the expense of Speed tying with Swords Dance Gallade and Kabutops. Jolly is useful for avoiding these Speed ties altogether. There are a couple of other viable moves that can fit into Shiftry's final moveslot. Substitute is a good move to avoid status without taking up an item slot like Lum Berry does, but Shiftry gets worn down easily enough as it is. Rock Slide might seem like a good option on paper to defeat Moltres, but the only advantage Rock Slide has is that it defeats defensive SubRoost Moltres; the more common offensive Moltres is OHKOed by a +2 Sucker Punch after Stealth Rock damage anyway. Low Kick deals more damage to Steelix than Nature Power does, but it has limited use otherwise, not to mention that Steelix is not an opponent Shiftry will want to face alone.</p> <p>When it comes to finding good teammates for Shiftry, Emboar and Moltres offer the ability to lure in bulky Water-types like Lanturn and Slowking that Shiftry can set up on easily. They also have the added utility of taking on some of Shiftry's enemies such as Escavalier and Ferroseed. Shiftry will sometimes find it hard to work around faster Fighting-types like Primeape, so Pokemon that can threaten them or cripple them, including Mesprit and Rotom, will be appreciated. Entry hazard support is very welcome to ease Shiftry's sweep. The common entry hazard setters, Smeargle and Qwilfish, are two good options. Smeargle pairs well with Shiftry's offensive playstyle and Qwilfish sets entry hazards up reliably while also being able to take on Fire-types that threaten Shiftry like Emboar and Entei. Shiftry also threatens the tier's best spinner, Kabutops, so entry hazards are not hard to keep on the field. As Shiftry can't break through bulky Pokemon with Regenerator such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, any Fire-type that can lure these Pokemon in and take them out are huge assets.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Shiftry's great typing and diverse movepool, it makes a great mixed attacker that also functions as a wallbreaker. Shiftry has access to Leaf Storm, a 140 Base Power STAB move that has the ability to tear up any non-resistant switch-in. Combine this with its access to Sucker Punch, which allows it to pick off Pokemon that survive Leaf Storm, and Shiftry already has most of the tools it needs to succeed. Hidden Power Fire is mainly used to defeat Escavalier and Ferroseed which would otherwise wall this set. Dark Pulse, on the other hand, is a STAB move with great neutral coverage and eases the pressure against Substitute users. Focus Blast offers the best coverage alongside Shiftry's Dark-type STAB moves, with no Pokemon that resist both Focus Blast and Shiftry's Dark-type STAB moves in the tier, and also deals with Clefable without lowering Shiftry's Special Attack. Nature Power, on the other hand, deals a large amount of damage to Entei and Emboar, preventing them from taking Shiftry on easily.</p> <p>Life Orb is the item of choice on this set, as it gives the Shiftry needed power to break through walls and allows it to switch moves to accommodate for different threats. 252 Special Attack EVs and a Rash nature gives Shiftry the greatest damage output for Leaf Storm, allowing it to OHKO Slowking a majority of the time and always OHKO Qwilfish. 252 Speed EVs allows Shiftry to Speed tie with other base 80s, including Kabutops and Gallade, and allows it to outspeed some of the most common walls. Although this set capitalizes on Shiftry's ability to use its massively powerful Leaf Storms, an alternate spread of 80 Atk / 176 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naughty nature can be used to allow Shiftry to 2HKO Roselia and OHKO Emboar after Stealth Rock with Nature Power, assuming these two Pokemon threaten your team.</p> <p>Mixed attacking Shiftry is more of an asset to its team and doesn't rely on other teammates to help it as much as it helps its teammates. Kabutops is a good teammate for removing entry hazards, as Shiftry is easily worn down by them, as well as threaten Moltres. Entry hazard setters are even more notable partners for this set, as hazards help weaken defensive Pokemon to the point where Shiftry can break through them without much trouble. Qwilfish is once again a great partner in this role, as it can set up entry hazards and take on many of Shiftry's common checks and counters. Shiftry's wallbreaking ability is useful for other offensive teammates that struggle with common walls. Life Orb Aerodactyl and Guts Swellow both appreciate Shiftry's wallbreaking support. Entei is a good teammate to defeat Escavalier that often force out Shiftry not carrying Hidden Power Fire and appreciates Shiftry's ability to remove Alomomola, Slowking, and Uxie from the field. Shiftry also supports Rotom, which has trouble wearing down the troublesome Clefable, Amoonguss, and Escavalier.</p> "

  "Ninjask": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite its unique role, Ninjask struggles in RU for reasons both inherent to itself and to the tier as a whole. Ninjask's ability to passively acquire Speed boosts and Baton Pass them, along with any other secondary buffs acquired in the process, though not necessarily a simple task, immediately establishes a niche in the tier. Bug / Flying is a very unappealing typing defensively, possessing a series of weaknesses to common attacking types (as well as a dangerous Stealth Rock weakness), and 61 / 45 / 50 defenses aren't doing much to mitigate this issue. The inherently bulky nature of the metagame means that Speed boosts often aren't enough for a Pokemon to consistently sweep, meaning that Ninjask often has to either prioritize passing Swords Dance boosts (a role it doesn't perform nearly as well as that of a Speed passer) to a partner for it to apply the offensive pressure necessary to wear down the common defensive cores of the tier, or resign itself to use in the mid- to late-game in order to find a window in which its abilities become pertinent for a sweeper to effectively clean up.</p> <p>Furthermore, the omnipresence of priority users, such as Entei, Kabutops, and Spiritomb, make both passing and receiving boosts a much more difficult task, forcing the Ninjask user to carefully plan their Baton Pass. Even after all that, there are still multi-hit move users and phazers that can almost completely stop any given Ninjask setup, often forcing it to reserve itself until mid-game to have any impact on the match. Ninjask is a very capable supporter of a plethora of potent Pokemon in RU, but in order to excel in this role, it requires significant support, proper prediction and judgment on the part of the user, and just a pinch of patience.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With a Pokemon as single-minded and linear as Ninjask, expecting it to do anything more than its one designated job is optimistic to say the least. Options to try to make use of its abilities in an offensive manner, such as a Choice Band or offensive Swords Dance set, could be utilized to some extent, though in the end, Ninjask makes for a very mediocre sweeper on its own. Essentially, the one other option worth considering would be more a matter of context rather than a different move or set, and that would be using Ninjask on a dedicated Baton Pass team. While Ninjask is generally better off serving as a means of supporting a powerful sweeper, it does remain the single best Speed booster for dedicated Baton Pass teams, which makes it a staple on such formats. However, due to a variety of factors, including a noticeable lack of strong Baton Pass support and teammates, this strategy is typically inadvisable under most circumstances.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As Ninjask wears itself down to the point where it can be picked off by nearly anything while fulfilling its role, Pokemon that are capable of inhibiting it from successfully passing its boosts are the best counters. The most solid, as well as the most obvious, are phazers, as Pokemon such as Steelix and Mandibuzz are capable of completely preventing Ninjask from supporting its teammates. Contact-based phazing moves from Pokemon such as Druddigon and Poliwrath fall into this category, but their low PP, imperfect accuracy, and inability to phaze through Substitute make them substantially less effective. What's more, Haze Cryogonal can similarly neutralize Ninjask's boosts while also threatening it with a STAB Ice Beam, though its susceptibility to Toxic and inability to remove Substitute without attacking makes it possible to be played around. Qwilfish, being the premier Taunt user of the tier, is capable of restricting the number of boosts Ninjask can accumulate, as well as threatening to cripple the Baton Pass recipient with Thunder Wave if Ninjask fails to acquire a Substitute beforehand. Multi-hit move users, such as Cinccino, Crustle, Piloswine, and Rhydon, are capable of circumventing Substitute and hitting both Ninjask and the recipient hard. Stealth Rock is naturally inhibiting to Ninjask, as it shaves off half of its HP upon every switch-in, restricting it to only one opportunity to set up at best. Moreover, by simply applying consistent offensive pressure to Ninjask, it is put in a very difficult position to safely pass off its boosts to a sweeper.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Base 160 Isn't Enough IMO",
        "description": "<p>Strictly speaking, this is the only set Ninjask should be running competitively. The concept behind this set is very simple on paper: utilize Protect and Substitute to safely acquire Speed boosts, then proceed to pass them off to the appropriate sweeper. Substitute serves a secondary purpose on this set as a buffer for both Ninjask and the recipient, protecting them from becoming compromised by status or Dragon Tail and Circle Throw, while also reducing the necessity for either to take strong hits. With that in mind, it is very rare that Ninjask has either the opportunity or the necessity to use anything other than its first three moves. However, the fourth move does offer Ninjask a degree of additional utility, and does somewhat affect how it plays. In terms of sheer potency, Swords Dance is far and away the most dangerous option—while it is very rare that Ninjask finds the opportunity to both set up a Swords Dance and bring in the proper recipient safely, the results can be devastating. On the other hand, while not nearly as threatening, Toxic is a useful and self-sufficient option for Ninjask. The cumulative chip damage Toxic provides not only synergizes nicely with the cycles of Substitute and Protect Ninjask commonly undergoes but can, at times, even force the opponent to switch out to preserve the poisoned Pokemon, which can open up a free turn for Ninjask to effectively pass off its boosts to a teammate safely.</p> <p>As straightforward as this process appears in theory, it requires substantially more prediction on the part of the Ninjask user in practice. While you can very well get up to +6 Speed by constantly using Protect and Substitute in succession, this not only wastes much more of Ninjask's HP than probably necessary but is also incredibly predictable and very exploitable by a knowledgeable opponent. A very simple and effective method of keeping opponents on their toes is to avoid setting up to +6 except for in the most dire situations—it might sound odd to not acquire as many boosts as possible, but once Ninjask acquires all the Speed boosts it possibly can, it's left with nothing much else to do but attempt to Baton Pass, which makes it all the easier for the opponent to nail the switch-in with a powerful attack. It is very rare that a Pokemon needs all of those Speed boosts to outpace the entirety of the opponent's team; simply boosting to the necessary level both saves PP and HP for Ninjask and makes predicting the Baton Pass all the more difficult.</p> <p>Moreover, it is important to note that having a Substitute up when Ninjask attempts the Baton Pass should hold priority over almost everything else, even if this means sacrificing an extra Speed boost or two in doing so. Having a Substitute active not only completely protects the Baton Pass recipient from everything barring multi-hit attacks and certain non-attacking moves that it might have otherwise struggled to switch into, but also gives it assurance against priority users and particularly fast Choice Scarf users afterwards, which effectively mitigates any Speed boosts the sweeper might have \"lost\" by forgoing the extra turns of boosting with Ninjask. While it isn't necessarily easy to maintain a Substitute, by mixing up the use of Protect and Substitute, rather than simply alternating between the two, Ninjask can do its recipient a much bigger favor than any extra one or two Speed boosts ever will. However, it should be noted that without users of phazing or multi-hit moves already disposed of, these boosts are practically forfeit, as such Pokemon can quickly neutralize Ninjask or its recipient.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Ninjask's physical bulk in order for it to better take on priority attacks, with a Timid nature and 16 Speed EVs ensuring that it outpaces Aerodactyl without a boost, as well as Unburden Hitmonlee at +1. In terms of item choice, Leftovers is often preferable, as the passive recovery not only allows Ninjask to produce more consecutive Substitutes, but also helps put it just outside the KO range of priority attacks, such as Entei's Extreme Speed, by using Protect when necessary. However, due to the fact that Ninjask very often only gets a single chance to set up, other items that can open up more opportunities aren't outside the realm of possibility. Lum Berry is one such example, as this allows Ninjask to more comfortably switch into defensively-inclined Pokemon, such as Clefable, Poliwrath, and Uxie, and proceed to accumulate boosts. Mental Herb gives Ninjask a chance to neutralize a single Taunt, allowing it to pick up a few more boosts against Pokemon such as Qwilfish, though the limited pool of effective Taunt users makes this a less consistently useful option than either Leftovers or Lum Berry.</p> <p>As elaborated upon earlier, Ninjask has very little use for much beyond its first three moves, so its final moveslot can be effectively tinkered with to achieve different results depending on individual necessities. A STAB move, such as X-Scissor or Aerial Ace, while not realistically making Ninjask any less vulnerable to Taunt, does offer Ninjask a method of dealing damage, which can at times prove useful for picking off weakened Grass- and Fighting-types it can occasionally switch into. Roost is also technically a possibility, as it could potentially increase Ninjask's lifespan to the point where it could attempt to pass boosts a second time, but typically teams utilizing Ninjask are too fast-paced and offensive to want to extend the match this long.</p> <p>Because Ninjask is almost entirely support-based in terms of its role, it is more important to focus on what benefits the most from its abilities first and foremost, rather than supporting it, when picking partners. The most appropriate partners for this role are those with high immediate power and the natural bulk and/or resistances necessary to comfortably stomach a priority move or even a weaker attack when switching in, with Ninjask's Speed boosts putting them comfortably outside the range of most Speed-reliant revenge killers. Ideally, these Pokemon should possess good defensive synergy with Ninjask in addition to possibly resisting common coverage options, as this makes predicting the Baton Pass more difficult and thereby dangerous. There are many options for this, which include Aggron, Crawdaunt, Druddigon, Durant, and Emboar, and it would be in one's best interest to utilize multiple recipients in order to diversify the potential threats to best suit various different match-ups. Kabutops should be given special acknowledgment in this role, as it provides the option of Rapid Spin to give Ninjask a bigger window to set up mid-game. Lastly, and while it might seem excessive, dual screens support is a very realistic option for Swords Dance variants of Ninjask—passing a Swords Dance boost in addition to the standard Speed boosts can very often be game-ending if executed properly, and thus very much worth the investment in dual screens. Uxie is the ideal partner for this role, as it can quickly set up screens, provide Stealth Rock support, and get out of the way via Memento, efficiently setting the stage for Ninjask to set up safely.</p> "

  "Hariyama": {
    "overview": "<p>Hariyama is a tough threat to deal with, as its combination of base 120 Attack, Guts, and good coverage make it very difficult to switch into. Hariyama excels at wearing down foes, and it is one of the only Fighting-types in RU that can consistently wear down Psychic-types such as Slowking and Uxie. This is especially useful for aiding teammates on an offensive team as Hariyama will enable them to clean up the opposing team with ease. Hariyama will usually be unable to sweep on its own as it has a pitiful base 50 Speed and will be worn down easily from its status Orb, but its ability to break walls makes up for it. Often overlooked is its base 144 HP and Thick Fat ability, which allow Hariyama to successfully run a defensive set to wall and phaze common threats such as Typhlosion, Magmortar, and even Kabutops. Overall, Hariyama can be used as a powerful attacker or defensive phazer, but play carefully around the offensive set, since even though it can be worn down easily, it will leave a dent.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A SubPunch set is possible for Hariyama to use, but Hariyama has difficulties maintaining a Substitute because of the powerful special attackers, such as Moltres and Sigilyph, found in RU. Hariyama has access to Bulk Up, but is not recommended, as Hariyama is too slow and has trouble finding time to pull it off. A set based around Hariyama's Dream World ability, Sheer Force, using Rock Slide, the elemental punches, or Iron Head has merit, but is outclassed by the status Orb set. A Choice Band set is always plausible, but only hits as hard as the status Orb set without giving Hariyama the freedom to switch moves. Life Orb is a viable alternative to Toxic Orb, as it prevents Protect users such as Alomomola from letting Hariyama die from residual damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The offensive set will be worn down easily by Toxic damage and common attacks. The best thing to do if you're facing it and dealing with other strong physical attackers is to try to keep a Psychic-type such as Slowking healthy, and wear Hariyama down by picking switch-ins that resist its moves instead. Rotom is immune to 3/4 of the offensive set's moves, and can stall it out with Substitute or finish it off with Thunderbolt. Alomomola can also let Hariyama kill itself off by using a combination of Wish + Protect. This may not work for offensive teams, however, so sacrificing something that you don't really need, such as a weakened lead Smeargle, then sending in an appropriate revenge killer will work. Moltres, Sigilyph, Braviary, and Mesprit can all work, as they can hit Hariyama super effectively or force a switch. Bulkier Pokemon such as Slowking, Uxie, and Misdreavus can also work, but they will lose quite a bit of HP in the process of checking Hariyama. Bulky Psychic- and Ghost-types work better when dealing with the RestTalk set.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hariyama's Attack goes through the roof with a Guts boost. It should usually be sent in after a teammate faints or on a predicted Toxic, as this set doesn't have the longevity of a bulkier set. Fake Out should usually be used right off the bat if Hariyama is not inflicted with a status condition, as this will allow Toxic Orb to activate safely. There are certain cases in which Fake Out should not be used, such as when the opponent has a solid switch-in like Sigilyph. Using Fake Out will give them a free switch in, so it would be better to use something like Close Combat or Stone Edge if you are predicting a switch. Being reckless with Fake Out will result in a weakened Hariyama. After Toxic Orb is activated, Hariyama will be used to wear down opposing Psychic-types and other walls for a teammate, usually another Fighting-type, as it can put them in KO range. This set should be used as a wallbreaker rather than a sweeper, as it doesn't have enough Speed to sweep through a team. Close Combat is the most powerful move on this set, even 2HKOing defensive Tangrowth after Stealth Rock with the Guts boost. Facade is very useful for Pokemon that resist Fighting, mainly Amoonguss, Slowking, and Uxie, who all get 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Stone Edge is used for Ghost-types, such as Rotom, and Flying-type switch-ins like Sigilyph and Moltres. However, Bullet Punch is useful for revenge killing foes such as Cinccino, Sceptile, and Lilligant, and it forms a good double priority strategy with Fake Out.</p> <p>Toxic Orb is preferred over Flame Orb as Hariyama won't usually be staying on the field for more than three turns, which is how long it takes for Toxic Orb to out-damage Flame Orb. The Speed EVs allow Hariyama to outspeed Clefable and uninvested Tangrowth, and the Defense EVs are used to make the most of Hariyama's Bug-, Dark-, and Rock-type resistances since most attacks of these types are physical. However, you can shift the EVs to Special Defense depending on which Pokemon you want Hariyama to face off against. In the fourth moveslot, Hariyama can use Earthquake to 2HKO Qwilfish and have a more reliable move to hit Spiritomb, which can increase the chance of a teammate's sweep. Ice Punch can be used to hit Golurk, which otherwise completely walls this set. Otherwise, the elemental punches aren't all that useful since Hariyama will still be getting 2HKOes with Close Combat or Facade.</p> <p>Fighting-type partners, such as Medicham, Gallade, and Hitmonlee, enjoy Hariyama's ability to lure in and weaken Psychic- and Ghost-types with Facade and Stone Edge. A Fighting-type duo with Hariyama will be sure to put a lot of pressure on the opponent. Hariyama will have to be careful of being revenge killed by faster Psychic-types like Sigilyph, so a teammate such as Spiritomb is appreciated. Spiritomb is also a good teammate because it provides Pursuit support; Hariyama greatly benefits from the removal of Ghost-types. Paralysis support is also useful for Hariyama, as it won't have to rely on its Speed as often. Uxie is great for this, as it can spread paralysis, set up Stealth Rock, and get Hariyama in safely with U-turn. Hariyama will usually get opportunities to switch in on defensive Pokemon like Clefable and Ferroseed, so something to lure them in such as Rotom-C or Kabutops will work well.</p> "

Rest keeps Hariyama healthy, allowing it to tank multiple hits from moderately powerful attackers such as Manectric. Sleep Talk prevents Hariyama from being dead weight while asleep and can bypass Whirlwind's negative priority, but does have a risk factor to it. In addition to team support and prolonging longevity, this set also takes advantage of Hariyama's good bulk. This set helps Hariyama check threats such as Typhlosion, Magmortar, and Cryogonal.</p> <p>The given EVs provide Hariyama with a Leftovers number while maximizing its bulk. Since this set is being used primarily as a phazer, it is recommended that you use hazards alongside it. Without them, this set loses a lot of its merit. When being used in conjunction with Toxic Spikes, Brick Break is a better option due to higher Base Power. Steelix and Omastar resist the Flying-type attacks aimed at Hariyama while being able to set up Stealth Rock (and Spikes in Omastar's case). Ferroseed is able to set hazards as well and has enough bulk to switch into most Flying-type attacks. Ferroseed also appreciates having Hariyama sponge Fire-type attacks to help cover its 4x weakness. Paralysis support via Force Palm makes slower offensive teammates, such as Choice Band Druddigon or Aggron, more useful, as scoring a paralysis against faster Pokemon such as Moltres or Qwilfish gives them an easier time. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Lanturn, Clefable, or Uxie is also very useful because they can use Heal Bell to cure Hariyama's status should it be forced out by a powerful attacker while asleep.</p> "

Aggron is also one of the few Steel-types in the tier, and its high Defense makes it surprisingly resilient.

Aggron has several support moves, such as Thunder Wave, Taunt, and phazing moves in Dragon Tail and Roar, but such support moves don't help Aggron much due to its generally offensive role.</p> <p>A Choice Scarf can help patch up Aggron's Speed while still being able to hit hard, but even with this item, it's a bit on the slow side. Aggron can set up using Hone Claws, which will also patch up the accuracy of Head Smash, but finding opportunities to set it up can be difficult. A combination of Metal Burst and Sturdy can take down an opponent by surprise, but it takes away almost everything Aggron can do, such as its recoil-less Head Smash. Iron Head can be used over Heavy Slam for consistency on any set, hitting Hariyama in particular a lot harder, but it is otherwise inferior. Ice Punch can be used for Torterra, but Torterra is uncommon enough to ignore despite it threatening Aggron. Finally, Aggron is one of many Pokemon that got an obnoxiously large special movepool, with goodies such as Thunderbolt and Fire Blast. While it might seem like Aggron can use these moves similarly to Pokemon such as Absol, the raw power of Head Smash and its equally large physical movepool makes it 2HKO almost every physical wall regardless.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Switching into Aggron requires a healthy amount of physical bulk and a Rock resistance, as Aggron will 2HKO at worst most Pokemon otherwise, making it tough to counter. Poliwrath is the most reliable check for Aggron, as Aggron cannot hit Poliwrath very hard while Poliwrath can phaze it out with a 4x super effective Circle Throw or use Scald to hit its weaker Special Defense. Physically defensive Torterra is also a good switch-in, and its reliable recovery and access to a STAB Earthquake allow it to come out on top. Other variants of Torterra get 2HKOed by Head Smash, but at the very least they can outspeed Aggron in this case. Steelix only fears Low Kick and takes Head Smash extremely well, while being able to retaliate with Earthquake. Steelix also cannot be 2HKOed by even a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake, putting it at an immediate advantage. Rhydon is similar, but it also takes notable damage from Heavy Slam and Aqua Tail, so it needs to tread more carefully. Ferroseed takes little damage from most of Aggron's moves other than Fire Punch, and can set up hazards on it easily. On the offensive side, Choice Specs Magneton can trap and OHKO Aggron, but Magneton risks getting OHKOed by a Choice Band-boosted Head Smash with a bit of prior damage, and easily falls to an Earthquake, so it's a bit unreliable outside of the revenge kill.</p> <p>Tangrowth and Alomomola, despite their high physical bulk, don't take Head Smashes all that well, but they can wall any other attack and take a Head Smash if they need to, and Regenerator can help mitigate damage from the switch into a Head Smash. Hariyama can OHKO Aggron easily, but Head Smash can leave its mark on Hariyama, and unless it maximizes Speed (which is not recommended), it risks getting outsped and 2HKOed. Gurdurr and Hitmonchan can actually leave a mark on Aggron with Mach Punch in the case of the Rock Polish set, with Gurdurr in particular being able to take a Head Smash. The Rock Polish set can be revenge killed by Accelgor (as long as it's not Jolly), as well as Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Primeape and Rotom-C. Aggron's low special bulk also ensures that it will not be able to take hits from Sceptile, Omastar, Typhlosion, or other special attackers, so long as it hasn't used Rock Polish to outspeed them.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>The obscene power Head Smash carries, combined with the fact that it has no recoil, means that Aggron will rarely have to use any other move, making Choice Band a perfect fit for Aggron. Every team should have a reliable switch-in for Head Smash, as otherwise whenever Aggron gets on the field, it will likely net a KO. Due to the numerous Pokemon that Aggron can switch into and immediately threaten thanks to its large amount of resistances and titanic physical bulk, such as Cinccino, Escavalier, and Spiritomb, Aggron gets more opportunities to switch in than one would expect from its typing and unleash Head Smash, which is strong enough to potentially OHKO Magneton after a layer of Spikes!</p> <p>Aggron even has coverage moves to deal with the majority of Pokemon that resist Head Smash. Both Earthquake and Low Kick allow Aggron to hit Steel-types, but Earthquake is preferred in order to OHKO Magneton without any support, which could otherwise trap and KO Aggron—Low Kick does not OHKO any variant of Magneton. However, Low Kick does allow Aggron to 2HKO Steelix, a Pokemon that takes nothing from Head Smash. Due to Aggron's immense weight, Heavy Slam is a reliable alternative STAB that will hit most Pokemon for full power and not miss, along with hitting Fighting-types neutrally and 2HKOing Rhydon. The last slot is fairly situational, but Aqua Tail is preferred to OHKO both Rhydon and Golurk, which can be annoying to deal with. However, Fire Punch allows Aggron to OHKO and 2HKO Ferroseed and Torterra, respectively.</p> <p>Despite being slow, Aggron's weaknesses make investing in bulk not worth it as it will usually be OHKOed by Earthquakes, Close Combats, and practically any move it is weak to on the special side regardless of investment. However, if you do desire bulk to take resisted hits better, 140 Speed EVs is the lowest Aggron should go, as it allows Aggron to outspeed Lanturn before it can use Scald. Superpower is an option over Low Kick or Earthquake, as it is consistently strong on the first hit while still providing Fighting-type coverage to hit Ferroseed. However, the stat drops are usually not worth it.</p> <p>Despite its damage output, there are a few Pokemon that can take a Head Smash, namely Ground-, Steel-, Fighting-, and some Rock-types. Poliwrath has a large amount of physical bulk and resistances that allow it to take on hits from most of the aforementioned Pokemon, and proceed to phaze them out and wear them down with Circle Throw. On the offensive side, Aggron is vulnerable to Earthquake and Close Combat, both of which it is 4x weak to. Uxie can take these moves easily thanks to its massive bulk and resistances, possibly allowing it to set up Calm Mind or cripple the opposing Pokemon with status. Moltres, on the other hand, can OHKO STAB users of these moves while also resisting both types. Under Trick Room, Aggron is nothing short of terrifying due to its low Speed then becoming an advantage. Slowking is the best option for a setter, as it can take Water-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks aimed at Aggron with ease. Other Psychic-types such as Mesprit and Exeggutor can also set up Trick Room if Slowking is performing a different role on your team already, and both can set up on Ground-type moves. Note that, if Aggron is on a Trick Room team, a Brave nature and minimum Speed should be used.</p> "

        "name": "Rock Polish",
        "description": "<p>Aggron has always had problems with its Speed stat, but fortunately, its access to Rock Polish allows it to fix this issue. This variant of Aggron is one of the most difficult Pokemon in RU for offensive teams to deal with, as it outspeeds the majority of the tier, including the popular Choice Scarf Emboar, hits obscenely hard, and is surprisingly hard to take down with priority; to put it in perspective, Life Orb Adamant Kabutops can only 3HKO Aggron with Aqua Jet, despite it being weak to the move and having no defensive investment whatsoever. Aside from Rock Polish, this set functions similarly to the Choice Band set. Head Smash will be used most frequently and is likely to OHKO any offensive Pokemon that doesn't resist the move. Earthquake covers Steel-types that resist the move, and Heavy Slam can serve as an alternative STAB and is Aggron's best option against most Fighting-types. Note that the power Heavy Slam can provide means that Aggron should not run the usually superior Autotomize over Rock Polish.</p> <p>While a Jolly nature lets Aggron outspeed Accelgor, an Adamant nature is preferred because, without it, Aggron cannot OHKO offensive Slowking or Lanturn, which could potentially end a sweep. A Life Orb is suggested in order to make everything hit harder, but the recoil damage can end up being a bit annoying. Although Life Orb is almost always worth the recoil, a Hard Stone is an alternative option in order to power up only Head Smash, the main move that will be used. While Lum Berry is a common item on sweepers such as Aggron, the likeliness of Aggron getting statused isn't high enough to give up power.</p> <p>Fighting-types are irritating for this set to deal with, as Mach Punch comes very close to an OHKO on Aggron for most Pokemon and Poliwrath walls Aggron easily. Rotom is an excellent partner as a result, due to it being immune to Fighting, having access to Will-O-Wisp to cripple them, and Thunderbolt to hit Poliwrath hard. It also takes on Aqua Jet users such as Kabutops and Samurott decently in case they try and finish off a weakened Aggron. A few common Pokemon can outspeed and threaten Aggron after the boost, including Accelgor, Choice Scarf Rotom-C, and Choice Scarf Manectric. Druddigon makes a decent switch-in to their strongest moves and can retaliate with a STAB move or Sucker Punch. If you suspect the Electric-types will try to use Volt Switch, Ground-types such as Golurk can stop their momentum. Golurk has the advantage of being able to check Accelgor as well. Rock- and Steel-types have high Defense and take Head Smash on well and might be able to sponge an Earthquake, so Poliwrath makes a good partner to switch in and wear them down with Circle Throw. Magneton support should be considered to eliminate some threats to Aggron, such as Steelix and Ferroseed, that it has no hope of breaking through.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>With its signature ability, Pure Power, Medicham's Attack stat transcends that of even the Uber titans Groudon and Rayquaza. When this ability is combined with one of the most powerful Fighting-type attacks, High Jump Kick, Medicham has the distinction of being one of the deadliest attackers in RU. Moreover, Medicham's decent base 80 Speed is enough to outpace a common defensive teams. This in tandem with its excellent movepool, containing Psycho Cut and Thunder Punch, gives it perfect coverage with only three attacks, making it a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>To say that Medicham has legendary offenses is an understatement, though that embellishment is contrary to its defensive prowess. Medicham can't take a hit to save its life because of its mediocre defenses, lackluster Speed for a sweeper, and unappealing defensive typing. To make matters worse, Medicham is vulnerable to almost every priority attack, which makes sweeping difficult. Often, another common Pokemon with a Psychic / Fighting typing, Gallade, is chosen over Medicham because of its superior bulk, versatility, and Attack-boosting capabilities. Medicham also has difficulty getting past Ghost-types. With a Ghost-type on the opposing team, Medicham will have to be cautious if it's attempting to use High Jump Kick, lest it face devastating repercussions. The most notable Ghost-type is Spiritomb, which is immune to both of Medicham's STABs and can Pursuit trap Medicham if it is locked into an unfavorable attack. Despite these faults, with just a little bit of team support, Medicham can unleash its full potential and slaughter the opposing team with its absurd power.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Medicham has quite a few tricks up its sleeve, though none of them are particularly viable. Low Kick and Reversal are two alternative Fighting-type attacks. Due to Medicham's ability to force switches, it can utilize a decently effective SubPunch set. Magic Coat can be used on an offensive lead set so that Medicham can bounce back entry hazards. Medicham can use Baton Pass in conjunction with Bulk Up to function as an offensive Baton Pass user. Rock Slide is an option to OHKO defensive Moltres and Scyther without the use of Stealth Rock. Feint can be used to hit Pokemon using Protect in an attempt to block Medicham's High Jump Kick. Finally, Toxic is an option to cripple Uxie and Spiritomb and chip away at their health slowly.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Spiritomb is Medicham's best counter. It is immune to both of its STABs and can even tank a Thunder Punch; Spiritomb can then OHKO Medicham with its STAB priority moves, Pursuit trap it on a predicted switch, or cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Uxie and Musharna, can counter Medicham quite easily and can retaliate with repeated attacks or cripple it with Thunder Wave. With Alomomola's gargantuan Defense, it can easily outstall Medicham and incur High Jump Kick's nasty recoil side effect with Protect. Mesprit and Misdreavus can check Medicham, though both of them have difficulty taking constant attacks. If Medicham lacks Thunder Punch, defensive Moltres, Scyther, Sigilyph, and Slowking can tank Medicham's attacks and OHKO.</p> <p>Medicham's lackluster defenses leave it wide open to a vast array of priority attacks. Absol's powerful STAB Sucker Punch can take out Medicham; Absol can even Pursuit trap Medicham if it intends on fleeing. Gallade can OHKO a weakened Medicham with Shadow Sneak. In a similar vein, Hariyama can take out Medicham with a combination of Fake Out and a Guts-boosted Bullet Punch. Choice Band Entei's Extreme Speed slices through Medicham's defenses like a hot knife through butter. Finally, most Pokemon that are faster than Medicham and carry a powerful STAB move can take it out. Galvantula can OHKO Medicham with Thunder, Sceptile can destroy Medicham with its STAB Leaf Storm, and Archeops can OHKO with its STAB Acrobatics.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Scarf, Medicham's otherwise mediocre Speed is augmented, turning it into a formidable revenge killer and late-game sweeper. High Jump Kick is the STAB attack of choice; with an Adamant nature, Medicham is able to 2HKO Alomomola, Tangrowth, and offensive Slowking, as well as OHKO Moltres after Stealth Rock. Psycho Cut is the more reliable STAB attack, hitting Fighting-type resists such as Amoonguss and Gallade. Psycho Cut is best used when the opponent has a Ghost-type, which makes the use of High Jump Kick too risky, as it might cause Medicham to lose much of its HP or become setup bait if said Ghost-type comes in after a kill. Thunder Punch rounds out Medicham's coverage and hits Sigilyph and defensive Slowking for super effective damage while hitting Spiritomb for neutral damage. In the final slot, Trick can be used to cripple walls such as Uxie, a Pokemon that Medicham has difficulty breaking through.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred, as it gives Medicham the ability to OHKO Pokemon like Escavalier and Entei with entry hazard support. However, a Jolly nature is also an acceptable option to outspeed slower Choice Scarf users, Aerodactyl, and +2 Modest Omastar, as well as Speed tie with Hidden Power Rock Accelgor. Drain Punch can be used over Trick, giving Medicham a safer secondary Fighting-type STAB.</p> <p>As previously mentioned, entry hazard support is crucial for Medicham to achieve many critical 2HKOs and OHKOs. With Stealth Rock, Medicham is able to OHKO offensive Moltres, defensive Druddigon, and Drapion while being able to 2HKO Tangrowth. Crustle, Clefable, and Kabutops can all set up Stealth Rock while being able to deal with many of Medicham's counters. Ferroseed, Omastar, and Roselia can set up Spikes; three layers of Spikes combined with Stealth Rock allow Medicham to 2HKO Slowking with High Jump Kick and offensive Spiritomb with Thunder Punch. Toxic Spikes support from Qwilfish and Roselia is also advantageous, as it can soften up walls for Medicham, opening the path for it to sweep. Pursuit support from Spiritomb and Absol is needed in order to get rid of Ghost-types and opposing Psychic-types so that Medicham can then use High Jump Kick with little concern. Offensive Accelgor has almost perfect synergy with Medicham, as the two of them can remove each other's counters while Accelgor can even set up Spikes to keep up the offensive pressure on the opposing team. Finally, priority users, such as Choice Band Entei, Choice Band Spiritomb, and Sucker Punch Absol, can all cut Medicham's sweep short. As such, dual screens Uxie makes an excellent partner; Uxie can set up Reflect, thus softening the impact of the aforementioned attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Although this set relinquishes Medicham's revenge killing capabilities, it turns Medicham into a formidable wallbreaker. High Jump Kick is Medicham's most powerful move; when equipped with either a Life Orb or a Choice Band, Medicham has the capacity to OHKO almost every Pokemon that does not resist it. Psycho Cut is Medicham's less risky attack, being able to OHKO Fighting-type resists such as Amoonguss. Due to Bullet Punch being incompatible with Psycho Cut, Zen Headbutt is a possible alternative physical Psychic-type move. While slightly inferior because of its unappealing accuracy, it is also slightly stronger than Psycho Cut. Zen Headbutt allows Choice Band Medicham to guarantee an OHKO on Qwilfish after Stealth Rock. Thunder Punch gives Medicham perfect coverage against Pokemon like Sigilyph, which would otherwise wall it. Once all Fighting-type resists are gone, Drain Punch becomes an appealing attack, as it allows Medicham to attack and heal itself simultaneously. Finally, Bullet Punch is an excellent priority move in order to pick off fast frail threats such as Archeops and Cryogonal.</p> <p>The remaining 4 EVs are put into Defense; if Medicham is using a Life Orb, it can use 11 attacks with an odd HP number, as opposed to 10 attacks with an even number (assuming it has not used Drain Punch or taken any prior damage).</p> <p>A Lum Berry is an acceptable option to rid Medicham of burn or paralysis. Recover can be used in the final slot to restore HP at a moment's notice. Fake Out can be used to break Focus Sashes and stop pesky Sturdy suicide leads. Speaking of Focus Sash, Medicham can also utilize a Counter + Focus Sash set or just Focus Sash on its own to great effect. Finally, Trick can be used to cripple walls such as Uxie with a Choice Band, but it is generally inferior to Drain Punch and Bullet Punch because Medicham normally has the power to get past these walls without relinquishing its item.</p> <p>Pursuit support is mandatory due to Medicham's inability to deal with bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types. Absol and Escavalier are both excellent Pursuit users, as they can get rid of most of Medicham's counters. Absol can even function as a backup wallbreaker. Due to Medicham's mediocre Speed, pairing it up with Ninjask can be quite useful. Ninjask can easily pass Medicham a few Speed boosts and even a Substitute; Medicham will then be fast enough to outspeed and demolish offensive teams and also have a handy Substitute to cushion the impact of powerful priority moves. Whimsicott can make itself useful by paralyzing faster threats with Prankster Stun Spore or giving Medicham some much needed Tailwind support. Magneton pairs well with Medicham because it can destroy Slowking and Sigilyph with its STAB Electric-type attacks. Entry hazard support in the form of Stealth Rock allows Medicham to OHKO defensive Scyther, while Spikes support from the Qwilfish or Crustle allows Medicham to 2HKO Slowking. Due to Crustle's secondary Bug typing, it can even take out bulky Psychic-types, such as Uxie, while Qwilfish can paralyze faster threats, such as Cinccino and Entei, with Thunder Wave.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>RU is not short of Electric-types and Manectric is one of the better ones out there. Sporting great coverage with solid Special Attack and Speed, Manectric is able to threaten defensive and offensive teams alike. Manectric is one of very few Choice Scarf users that can revenge kill +2 Omastar and +1 Lilligant without too many issues. Utility moves in the form of Volt Switch and Switcheroo only augment Manectric's ability to wield Choice items effectively. It is also blessed with a great ability in Lightning Rod. Thanks to this ability, Manectric is capable of not only absorbing Electric-type moves like Volt Switch and Thunder Wave but is also capable of sweeping thanks to the Special Attack boost granted if Lightning Rod is activated. Manectric makes for one of the best Choice Scarf users in RU because of these traits.</p> <p>However, Manectric does have some issues to overcome in RU. Although it has high Special Attack and Speed, Manectric's defenses are meager and can even make switching into a defensive threat like Lanturn a bit of a risk. Manectric's lack of usable resistances and immunities only magnifies this problem. While Electric / Fire / Grass coverage is still very good, it is now flawed with Druddigon being such a common threat. Although Manectric can utilize Hidden Power Ice to navigate past Druddigon, this would open it up to Rhydon, thus leaving quite the difficult choice when it comes to choosing a Hidden Power type. While Manectric may not be the best Electric-type in the tier, it is certainly a threat you need to be ready for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Manectric doesn't have a very wide movepool, but there are a few options to look at. Discharge and Charge Beam are alternative STAB moves that Manectric can use. Discharge has a better paralysis rate and Charge Beam can boost Manectric's Special Attack, but the utility of Volt Switch and reliable power of Thunderbolt is generally preferred. Thunder Wave can cripple faster threats, but Manectric is usually being met with more defensive Pokemon that can tank some of its attacks. Manectric has Howl to boost its Attack along with Wild Charge, the elemental fangs, and Crunch, but its base 75 Attack is mediocre at best. Light Screen can cushion special attacks for Manectric and its team, but even then, Manectric will still be taking serious damage from most powerful special attackers.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best answers to Manectric are Clefable and Lanturn. Clefable is able to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Thunderbolt while Lanturn only fears the odd Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Grass. Dragon-types such as Druddigon and Zweilous can switch in on the Electric- and Fire-type moves Manectric commonly carries and deal major damage with their powerful STAB moves. However, both need to be careful of a possible Hidden Power Ice. Rhydon is in a similar boat in that it can take on any Manectric lacking Hidden Power Grass as Eviolite sets can avoid the 2HKO from Hidden Power Ice, but a Switcheroo can quickly limit its defensive capabilities. Offensive Pokemon that have good special bulk, such as Gallade and Bouffalant, are good checks, as they can tank any hit and KO back with their powerful STAB moves. Entei is able to take on Manectric decently well as it can use its STAB Flare Blitz or a powerful Extreme Speed to hit Manectric hard. Rotom resists Manectric's STAB moves and it can use a STAB Shadow Ball to deal significant damage to Manectric. Golurk isn't OHKOed by a super effective Hidden Power and can easily KO back with Earthquake.</p> <p>Priority moves are another way to deal with Manectric as its meager defenses means it will take quite a bit of damage from most of them. Absol and Spiritomb are able to use Sucker Punch and both can even Pursuit Manectric if it decides to switch out. Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee can hit hard with STAB Mach Punch; Hitmonchan's is backed by a Life Orb and Iron Fist, while Hitmonlee's will usually be powered up with a Fighting Gem. However, you shouldn't be switching these threats into Manectric as it has a high possibility of Volt Switching out. Cryogonal is a great answer to the Choice Scarf set, but it has a much harder time with the special attacker set. Speaking of the special attacker, it is outsped by Durant, Sceptile, and most other Choice Scarf users in the tier. If all else fails, you can use your own Manectric to take advantage of possible Volt Switches and Thunderbolts to gain a Special Attack boost to try and sweep. However, you must take caution in going this route, because Overheat or even Hidden Power will hurt.</p> ",

Equipped with a momentum-building move, Switcheroo, and the ability to revenge kill serious threats that few other Choice Scarf users can, Manectric is the best example of an \"insurance\" Pokemon for offensive teams to use. Volt Switch allows Manectric to build or maintain offensive momentum while scouting for possible checks and counters. Overheat is an incredibly useful tool for Manectric, as it OHKOes +1 Lilligant, something almost no other Choice Scarf user can do without taking a hit first. Thunderbolt is a great cleaning move for Manectric and also allows it to use a STAB move and stay on the field if the need arises. Switcheroo rounds out the set and allows Manectric to cripple an opposing wall that it might have difficulty beating otherwise, such as Rhydon or Clefable.</p> <p>Lightning Rod should always be used as it grants Manectric an immunity to all Electric-type moves, including Thunder Wave. The resulting Special Attack boost can even aid a possible late-game sweep. Hidden Power Grass can be used to deal with Rock Polish Rhydon and Golurk, but both are quite rare and Golurk is hit just as hard by Overheat. Hidden Power Ice is an option if Druddigon is really annoying you, but it will fail to 2HKO most variants. Flamethrower can be used over Overheat if you find yourself using Switcheroo a lot, and if you don't like the Special Attack drop that is caused by Overheat. However, you must be wary that Flamethrower misses the OHKO on +1 Lilligant, a major target that Manectric can KO with Overheat.</p> <p>As mentioned previously, Manectric is more of an \"insurance\" Pokemon to use when threats get out of control, so it doesn't require a lot of support to function at optimal capacity. Manectric has a hard time with Druddigon, as even Switcheroo will only limit Druddigon's effectiveness. For this reason, Steel-types such as Aggron and Escavalier make for good partners to sponge its powerful Dragon-type attacks while immediately threatening Druddigon with their STAB moves. Rapid Spin support is welcome as it will let Manectric use Volt Switch with much more freedom. Kabutops fits the bill nicely as it can lure in Electric-type moves for Manectric to switch in on. Cryogonal isn't bad either as it's immune to Ground-type moves, but it does struggle against the most common spinblocker in the tier, Spiritomb. Mesprit is a solid partner, in particular its Choice Specs set. Mesprit is immune to Ground-type moves and can quickly weaken the special walls that may try to stop Manectric from revenge killing or going on a late-game sweep with Choice Specs-boosted Psyshocks. Manectric also functions well on VoltTurn teams. Braviary, Rotom-C, Eelektross, and the aforementioned Mesprit can all use either Volt Switch or U-turn if you choose to use a VoltTurn core.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set aims to capitalize on Manectric's great coverage and solid Speed to turn it into a wallbreaker that can still pose a legitimate sweeping threat with its base 105 Speed and Special Attack. Volt Switch is Manectric's main STAB move on this set, as it allows Manectric to scout out how the opponent wants to play against it, thus giving you an advantage the next time Manectric comes in. Flamethrower is used for its consistency and lack of Special Attack drops. It allows Manectric to easily get past the likes of Ferroseed, Steelix, and Tangrowth, all of which may come in to take Manectric's Electric-type STAB moves. Thunderbolt provides Manectric with a reliable STAB move that allows it to stay in and clean up late-game when the chance arises. In the last slot, a Hidden Power type needs to be chosen. Due to how common Druddigon is, Hidden Power Ice is generally preferred to allow Manectric to 2HKO all but specially defensive variants of Druddigon. However, Hidden Power Grass is an option to OHKO Rhydon, a serious threat that can easily demolish Manectric otherwise.</p> <p>The item choice is a tough one, but the ability to switch moves and bluff a Choice item with Expert Belt is generally preferred. Choice Specs is still a solid option for the significant power boost Manectric gains, especially on bulkier targets it can't hit for super effective damage, such as Uxie, Spiritomb, and Mesprit. Life Orb might seem like a middle ground of sorts, but it wears down Manectric way too quickly. Overheat and Switcheroo are two options to consider if you use Choice Specs. Overheat can destroy Cryogonal, but it has little use outside of that. Switcheroo can cripple walls, but Manectric can just as easily use Expert Belt, or even Life Orb, to break them down with its great coverage.</p> <p>This set is one of the best Regenerator core killers in the entire tier, so Pokemon that appreciate not having to deal with these types of Pokemon are great teammates. Fire-types such as Emboar and Entei enjoy having Slowking and Alomomola removed from play so they can use their powerful STAB moves with more freedom. Kabutops provides Rapid Spin support, draws in Electric-type moves, and enjoys not having to deal with Tangrowth and Ferroseed. Fighting-types such as Gallade and Hitmonlee are more than capable of taking out Clefable and Cryogonal, which can open the door for Manectric to sweep late-game. Rhydon can be a pretty big pain for this set if Manectric lacks Hidden Power Grass, so having something that can take its powerful moves can be helpful. For this reason, Torterra can be a pretty solid partner as it resists Ground-type moves and it appreciates having Tangrowth removed since it matches up well against most other defensive Pokemon in the tier. Manectric still performs well on VoltTurn teams, so pairing it with Pokemon such as Braviary and Mesprit can be worthwhile. Braviary appreciates Manectric's ability to remove most Steel-type Pokemon while Choice Specs Mesprit can easily break down special walls, such as Clefable and Lanturn, with its STAB Psyshock.</p> "

  "Roselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Even though she is not fully evolved, Roselia becomes a great asset to RU teams due to Eviolite. Eviolite makes her a great wall, boosting her mediocre Special Defense and pitiful Defense to formidable levels. Roselia also possesses a great support movepool that includes Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sleep Powder. Her pluses don't stop there; Roselia's ability, Natural Cure, is also a boon, as it allows her to shake off status effects and even cure herself from Rest upon switching out. Also, unlike other defensive Pokemon, Roselia boasts a decent base 100 Special Attack stat, which allows her to strike hard with a powerful STAB Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb. With an ideal support movepool, great defensive capabilities, and many other beneficial attributes, Roselia is certainly a Pokemon who will successfully fill the role of a defensive supporter.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roselia has a variety of other moves she can use depending on her teammates. Leaf Storm can be used instead of Giga Drain to hit certain threats such as Spiritomb harder, but Roselia will become setup bait after the decline in Special Attack. Venoshock is an interesting option to use over Sludge Bomb, especially if Roselia is using Toxic Spikes, as it has a much higher Base Power against a poisoned opponent. An offensive set is an option to exploit her base 100 Special Attack; Sleep Powder, Leaf Storm, and Sludge Bomb with a Life Orb could make Roselia into quite a formidable threat.</p> <p>Roselia has quite a few other options in non-attacking moves as well. A SubSeed set is viable, and she can use Sludge Bomb to keep Grass-types that are immune to Leech Seed at bay. Sleep Powder is another good option, as it puts the opponent to sleep, which could allow her to set up another layer of Toxic Spikes. However, keep in mind that Sleep Powder and Spikes are illegal together, so Roselia will be forced to use Toxic Spikes. Finally, Aromatherapy is another great support move as it clears Roselia and her team of status effects. She can also use it with Synthesis so that she does not have to use Rest and switch out to get rid of burns or paralysis.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steel-types, Ferroseed and Klinklang in particular, take basically nothing from Roselia's attacks and can set up on her. Escavalier does not mind anything Roselia has to offer, and can make work of her with Megahorn or Pursuit. Fire-type Pokemon, such as Moltres and Entei, can OHKO Roselia, while she can't do much back and is forced to switch out. Flying-types such as Sigilyph and Mandibuzz are also a nuisance for Roselia, as they resist her STAB Giga Drain and can annihilate her with a boosted Air Slash or a powerful Brave Bird. Specially defensive Mandibuzz takes practically nothing from her attacks and can even Taunt Roselia, preventing her from healing or setting up entry hazards. Cryogonal is one of the most solid counters to Roselia, taking almost nothing from her attacks due to its high Special Defense and either spinning away Spikes or hitting hard with a STAB Ice Beam. Even resisted physical attacks will obliterate Roselia; for example, +2 Feraligatr's Waterfall will 2HKO her, and that same Feraligatr's Return will OHKO. Most Psychic-types have an easy time against Roselia as well because they can simply blast away at Roselia's weaker defense stat with Psyshock. Finally, Roselia hates getting hit by Trick because she becomes much less bulky after she loses Eviolite. Thus, be careful when switching her into Rotom and Rotom-C.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With Eviolite and base 80 Special Defense, Roselia makes for a great special wall. Because of this, she is able to take minimal damage from some of the most frightening special attackers in the tier, including Accelgor, Lilligant, Manectric, Rotom, Rotom-C, Sceptile, and more. As Roselia will usually get a free switch into one of these Pokemon, she will be able to get up one layer of Spikes. Roselia's STAB moves are vital to this set, as they prevent certain threats from being able to harm her and her team. Giga Drain is extremely important, as it hits bulky Water-types and restores a bit of HP, which is useful as Roselia cannot utilize the recovery from Black Sludge. It is also important for checking Omastar, as Roselia can survive a +2 Modest Ice Beam from it and OHKO it with Giga Drain. Giga Drain also prevents common spinners, namely Kabutops, from spinning away Roselia's Spikes. Sludge Bomb is Roselia's secondary STAB move, hitting Grass-types such as Sceptile, Tangrowth, Lilligant, and Rotom-C for super effective damage. It also has the chance to poison the opponent, which could be useful for hitting common switch-ins that are immune to Toxic Spikes, such as Mandibuzz and Cryogonal. Synthesis is the main option for the last slot as it is reliable and doesn't force Roselia out after using it. Rest can be used instead to fully heal her and is more reliable against rain teams, plus she is able to rid herself of sleep upon switching out. Toxic Spikes, however, is useful to spread poison across the opponent's team. Wish support is heavily advised if this is chosen.</p> <p>The EV spread makes Roselia as specially bulky as possible and allows her to survive most non-super effective hits. Because Roselia cannot take physical attacks well due to her horrible base 45 Defense, a fully specially defensive spread is recommended over a physically defensive one. Natural Cure is the best ability for Roselia, as it removes status upon switching out, which is especially useful if she is using Rest. Roselia's wide support movepool leaves her with a few other options. Hidden Power Fire is Roselia's only real weapon against Escavalier, which otherwise has a basically free switch in to trap Roselia with Pursuit.</p> <p>As for teammates, bulky Water-types are the way to go, as their weaknesses and resistances pair well with Roselia's. Slowking and Poliwrath are especially good partners, as they beat Fire-types and can phaze with Dragon Tail and Circle Throw respectively, racking up entry hazard damage. Alomomola is also especially useful, as it can pass Wishes to Roselia should she not find time to use Rest or Synthesis. Spiritomb is another good partner, as it can take physical attacks aimed at Roselia while keeping her hazards on the field by blocking Rapid Spin.</p> "

  "Cacturne": {
    "overview": "<p>At a glance, it is difficult to justify the use of Cacturne in the RU metagame. With so many potent Grass-types available for use, it hardly seems wise to handicap yourself with a Pokemon like Cacturne. However, despite its appearance, Cacturne is actually quite unique in what it offers. Due to Cacturne's high offensive stats and powerful STAB Sucker Punch, it is one of the tier's best offensive Spikes users, capable of threatening a variety of common Pokemon in order to set up entry hazards. To add to this, Cacturne is also able to apply significant offensive pressure to both Kabutops and Cryogonal, the most common and effective Rapid Spin users of the tier, allowing it to effectively prevent its entry hazards from being removed on its own. What's more, its unique typing, complemented by its useful ability in Water Absorb, makes it a very effective choice for offensively-inclined teams, checking threatening Pokemon such as Slowking and Substitute + Calm Mind Uxie, as well as comfortably switching into bulky Water-types. However, Cacturne's lack of natural bulk means that it is heavily reliant on its resistances to take hits of any kind, meaning that it often struggles to switch in and can be forced out just as easily. What's more, being as slow as it is, Cacturne relies heavily on Sucker Punch to handle offensive threats, making it a very prediction-heavy Pokemon in many situations. While Cacturne is by no means a Pokemon that can be thrown on any team, it does retain a significant niche in the RU metagame and should be taken into consideration when building offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Cacturne actually possesses a fairly expansive movepool, this is largely overshadowed by the very similar Shiftry, whose extra Speed gives it the advantage in a sweeping role under most conditions, namely through both Swords Dance and Nasty Plot. For this reason, Cacturne is generally restricted to be used as a Spikes setter in order for it to avoid being outclassed. However, Cacturne's low Speed does benefit it in a Trick Room setting, where its high Attack and Special Attack, excellent coverage, and resistances to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks makes it a fully capable Trick Room sweeper. Additionally, a set utilizing Destiny Bond alongside Custap Berry is an interesting tactic for eliminating problematic Pokemon, but this does require significant maneuvering and knowledge of how well Cacturne can take certain hits in order to be utilized to its fullest potential.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While outright preventing Cacturne from fulfilling its role as a Spikes setter is difficult, as it is capable of pressuring most conventional responses to entry hazards rather well, several Pokemon can simply threaten it offensively. Fire-types, especially ones like Entei and Emboar that can handle Sucker Punch well, are problematic for Cacturne, as it cannot effectively prevent them from switching in while they can OHKO with their STAB attacks in return. Offensively inclined Steel-types, such as Aggron and Klinklang, can switch into most of Cacturne's arsenal safely and proceed to either set up on it or outright KO it with their STAB moves. Although they don't particularly enjoy Life Orb Hidden Power Fire, bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss are more than capable of switching into Cacturne and can cripple it with status or wear it down with their attacks. While Pokemon like Hitmonlee and Primeape don't take Seed Bomb very well, they are otherwise fairly safe responses to Cacturne, resisting Sucker Punch and capable of threatening it with the prospect of a powerful Close Combat. Finally, offensive Substitute users, such as Sceptile and Scolipede, are capable of playing around Cacturne's Substitute with proper prediction, forcing it into a 50-50 prediction scenario.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Spikes",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Cacturne's high offensive stats, unique typing, and potent movepool, it makes an excellent offensive Spikes user. As Cacturne is capable of threatening a variety of Pokemon, ranging from frail sweepers to common defensive pivots, it is capable of finding opportunities to set up Spikes as the opposing Pokemon are forced to switch out. One of Cacturne's most effective tools in threatening Pokemon is its STAB Sucker Punch, which allows it to pick off a variety of frail faster Pokemon. Moreover, Sucker Punch applies significant pressure upon the best Rapid Spin users in the tier, Kabutops and Cryogonal, dealing major damage to the former and OHKOing the latter almost always with a Life Orb. Seed Bomb provides Cacturne with a safe STAB move capable of immediately threatening the Water-types it checks, as well as preventing Kabutops from switching into Cacturne and threatening to either spin away its entry hazards or KO with Stone Edge. Lastly, Hidden Power Fire allows Cacturne to round off its coverage, punishing Steel-types such as Escavalier and Durant as well as defensively-inclined Grass-types, most notably Tangrowth. On the other hand, while Substitute leaves Cacturne vulnerable to Steel-types, it does allow Cacturne to stay in on a variety of Pokemon that would otherwise force it out, as well as minimizing the risk associated with using Sucker Punch.</p> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Cacturne's offensive presence while providing it enough Speed to outpace minimally invested Lanturn, allowing Cacturne to KO with Seed Bomb before being weakened by a potential Ice Beam or Thunder Wave. However, if Substitute is used over Hidden Power Fire, it would be worthwhile to invest the Special Attack EVs in Speed, as many common Pokemon, such as Aggron, Bouffalant, and Golurk, also aim to outpace Lanturn. In terms of item choice, the extra power of Life Orb is somewhat of a necessity when utilizing Hidden Power Fire in order for it to inflict significant damage upon its primary targets, while Leftovers's guaranteed recovery is largely preferable in conjunction with Substitute in order to set up more comfortably. However, that is not to say that Cacturne is restricted to these items, as it is capable of utilizing a reasonably wide arrangement of alternative options in order to allow to better fulfill certain roles. Some of the most pertinent of these choices are Dark Gem, which provides Cacturne a useful \"middle ground\" option between Leftovers and Life Orb, whose boost in power can allow it to better check certain sweepers, and Occa Berry, which allows it to switch more safely into Slowking and Grass-types without risking being blown out of the water by Fire Blast or Hidden Power Fire, respectively. Should the necessity to hit Normal-types be particularly high, Low Kick and Superpower both hit such Pokemon while retaining coverage against Steel-types, but it should be noted that critical targets of Hidden Power Fire, namely Escavalier and Durant, aren't hit particularly hard by this. Moreover, Swords Dance can be used in order to put even further pressure on the opponent to play around Sucker Punch and give Cacturne a window to sweep late-game, but opposing priority users make it rather difficult for it to do so.</p> <p>In terms of partners, Cacturne has a variety of Pokemon that help make its job a little bit easier. Choice Scarf Emboar is a perfect example of this, offering a strong switch-in to support-based Grass-types capable of \"absorbing\" their Sleep Powders and Spores nicely, in addition to baiting bulky Water-types that Cacturne can in turn capitalize on. Moreover, while Cacturne is more than capable of setting up Spikes alongside several common entry hazard users, it is placed in a stalemate position in doing so that can often lead to both sides getting up all their entry hazards of choice. This makes having a spinner highly encouraged, and offensively speaking, Kabutops is the best fit for such a role, offering a solid switch-in to difficult Pokemon such as Entei and providing further offensive pressure on the opponent. However, Water-types as a whole are solid partners for Cacturne, providing good defensive synergy and forming a classic Fire / Water / Grass core, and if hazards are not an issue, then Kabutops can very well be substituted for an alternative Water-type. Omastar and Samurott both prove excellent examples of alternatives, with the former similarly capitalizing on Entei through Shell Smash and the latter acting as an effective wallbreaker to break up defensive cores. Lastly, while Cacturne is fairly self-sufficient in maintaining its own entry hazards against the spinners of the tier, defensive Rotom is a very helpful teammate, offering a solid offensive presence capable of capitalizing on Cacturne's Spikes, a useful resist to Bug-, Flying-, and Fighting-type attacks, and the ability to spinblock, deterring the opponent from attempting to Rapid Spin. Rotom is also the best candidate for spinblocking Kabutops, who Cacturne experiences some issues against as a spinner.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Dragon is a fantastic typing in RU, and Altaria offers a unique Flying typing to go along with it. This nice typing offers a Fighting resistance and, more importantly, a Ground and Spikes / Toxic Spikes immunity. The Stealth Rock weakness sucks, but the advantages that the Flying typing presents Altaria can make up for it at times. While Druddigon outclasses Altaria in most regards due to its amazing power and bulk, Altaria offers a lot of diversity. Its special attacking set is its main niche, sporting the strongest Draco Meteor in the tier alongside a wide movepool and a great Speed stat compared to the other Dragons in the tier. Natural Cure + Heal Bell is another fantastic niche Altaria holds in RU, and with its great defenses, it can utilize defensive sets very well. In the end, Altaria can certainly hold its own in RU, but you should always consider Druddigon before choosing Altaria, as its pure Dragon typing and super high Attack stat are better suited for most teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Altaria's movepool is truly gigantic, most of what it's capable of doing in RU has been covered by the sets above. Fire Blast can be used on the physical sets to help with Escavalier, Ferroseed, and Tangrowth, though Earthquake, Outrage, or Dragon Claw is usually enough to break them down if it's brought in late-game. A Choice Band set is usable as it offers immediate power backed by a really nice Speed stat, but it's largely outclassed by Druddigon, which offers much more power, and Gabite, which is even faster and has STAB Earthquake to go along with it. Cotton Guard is a neat option on defensive sets, but defensive boosting sets are just begging to be ruined by critical hits and the moveslot is usually better relegated to something else. Finally, Cloud Nine makes Altaria a hard stop to nearly every weather-based team, but they're actually extremely rare in RU, and Altaria gets far more mileage out of Natural Cure.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Almost nothing in the tier can easily switch into a Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor without taking some major damage, although Steel-types, particularly Escavalier, Steelix, and Aggron, are a good answer to Altaria, but they need to be extremely wary of Fire Blast and Earthquake, as well as the possible Magneton teammate. Slowking and other special walls like Clefable and Cryogonal are a great stop to the special attacking and support sets, though they're in trouble if they end up switching into the physical sets. Druddigon makes a good check since it can OHKO any Altaria set with Outrage, but Altaria is faster and will probably KO it first unless it's locked into something like Fire Blast. Cinccino is a good offensive check to Altaria as it really puts the hurt down with Rock Blast. Rhydon, Aerodactyl, Archeops, and Kabutops all easily OHKO with Stone Edge and can usually find a way to switch into Altaria between Fire Blast or a weak Dragon Pulse / Dragon Claw. Anything with Ice Beam or another Ice-type attack is an immediate check to Altaria, Cryogonal in particular being a full stop to the special attacking set even with Fire Blast. Stealth Rock is another huge damper to its otherwise fantastic natural bulk. Usually it comes down to what set Altaria is using as to how to play around it, but Altaria has a way around nearly every check or counter it could have, which makes it hard to immediately switch into. Also, once Altaria is at -2 from Draco Meteor or confused from Outrage, almost anything in the tier can use it as setup bait.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Base 70 Special Attack seems rather pathetic in a tier that boasts special attackers with offensive stats reaching 125. However, Altaria's unique STAB and access to Draco Meteor mean that it can still cleave through teams with a special attacking set. Dragon is only resisted by Steel-types, which are few and far between in RU, and any Steel-type that dares to confront Altaria will be quickly melted with a Fire Blast. Draco Meteor is Altaria's main weapon; with it, Altaria can 2HKO most of the metagame. Only the bulkiest special walls will be able to repeatedly switch into Altaria's Choice Specs or Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteor. Unfortunately, the cost of such power is an unsavory Special Attack drop which can sometimes render Altaria as setup bait. Choice Specs sets can instead use Dragon Pulse as a more reliable STAB attack while Life Orb sets can Power Swap away the Special Attack drop onto unsuspecting opponents. Power Swap also gives Altaria a unique way to combat special boosters such as Calm Mind Mesprit or Uxie. After letting them boost up a few times, Altaria can turn your opponent's boosts against them, smacking them with a boosted Draco Meteor. In the last slot, Altaria can take advantage of its excellent bulk with a recovery move; Rest is used on Choice Specs sets to cure Altaria fully. Upon switching out, Natural Cure will heal Altaria of its sleep condition. Roost is a more useful option on the Life Orb set as it doesn't force Altaria to switch.</p> <p>The EVs maximize Altaria's rather low Special Attack stat while ensuring it can still outspeed Timid Omastar. The remaining EVs are placed in HP to take advantage of Altaria's excellent bulk. If you want Altaria to be faster, then maximizing Speed is also an option, but Altaria already outspeeds most walls and appreciates the bulk to help take on offensive Pokemon. As Altaria can do little to Pokemon such as Probopass and Aggron, Altaria can use Hidden Power Ground instead of Dragon Pulse. Hidden Power Ground also hits other Steel-types so it is a viable, although much weaker, alternative to Fire Blast. Despite Altaria's great coverage and power, it is still easily walled by special walls such as Clefable and Slowking. Therefore, a powerful wallbreaker, such as Aggron or Escavalier, can be used as an offensive partner. Both also resist Ice- and Dragon-type attacks directed at Altaria while Aggron also sponges Rock-type attacks. Druddigon is another great partner for Altaria as it can clean up weakened teams after Altaria has lured and destroyed Steel-types such as Steelix and Aggron. Rapid Spin support is also very useful as the Special Attack drop that comes with Draco Meteor will force Altaria to switch out often. Pokemon such as Kabutops and Cryogonal can use Rapid Spin while also covering Altaria's large Ice weakness.</p> "

Roost is Altaria's reliable recovery move and lets it continuously wall threats throughout the game, healing off residual damage from Stealth Rock and resisted attacks. Dragon Pulse is Altaria's only attack and prevents it from being useless when Taunted. Heal Bell is a rather rare move that Altaria can use to support its teammates, curing any status on your team. Lastly, Roar phazes away dangerous setup sweepers hoping to capitalize on Altaria's weak offensive prowess. It also stacks up more entry hazard damage on your opponents. However, Toxic is Altaria's best way of doing damage, and lets it Roost-stall the opposition.</p> <p>The EV spread is the standard for any specially defensive wall. Maximum investment in Special Defense and HP ensures that Altaria can take on many of the special attacking powerhouses in the RU tier. A physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD lets Altaria take on various physical attackers; however, Altaria's Defense stat isn't as impressive as it Special Defense stat. Leftovers provides consistent recovery and helps Altaria avoid certain 2HKOs. Natural Cure is an amazing ability for a wall as it practically eliminates the most common way to take down a wall, Toxic. Although Altaria can already run Heal Bell, it is extremely useful to just be able to switch out and cure any status on Altaria. Although Altaria gets Roar to take care of stat boosters, Altaria can also use Perish Song as a phazing move. It will force your opponent out after a few turns and is excellent when dealing with a last Pokemon on your opponent's team. Instead of Dragon Pulse, Altaria can use Dragon Claw as its sole attack; while it has less Base Power than Dragon Pulse, it is useful for taking down more specially defensive threats that Altaria walls such as Slowking.</p> <p>As Altaria is a team supporter itself, it stands to reason that it doesn't need much help from its teammates. However, there are a few things one can do to help Altaria do its job. Rapid Spin support is great for Altaria as it hates having to lose 25% of its health from switching into Stealth Rock. Pokemon such as Kabutops and Cryogonal are great candidates, as both also resist the Ice-type attacks directed at Altaria. Physically defensive Steel-types, such as Steelix, form a powerful defensive core with Altaria, as they can take Dragon-type attacks and cover Altaria's weaker Defense.

Although its attacks aren't nearly as powerful as that of the Dragon-types in upper tiers, the relative lack of Steel-types in RU means that Altaria will have little trouble slicing through your opponent's team after a few boosts. Dragon Dance increases both Altaria's Attack and Speed stats to respectable levels; after a couple of boosts, almost nothing in RU will be able to stomach Altaria's assaults. Outrage is Altaria's STAB move of choice, and lets it pummel its foe with an anger-fueled, 100% accurate, 120 Base Power STAB attack. Unfortunately, it locks Altaria in and forces it to become confused after a few turns, so it should be used with caution. Earthquake provides amazing coverage alongside Outrage, hitting Steel-types such as Steelix and Magneton hard. Lastly, Roost is used to take advantage of Altaria's great natural bulk while setting up. It also removes Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage that Altaria will no doubt accumulate throughout the game.</p> <p>A Life Orb, Adamant nature, and fully offensive EV spread makes the most of Altaria's offenses. However, Leftovers can be used instead as Altaria has excellent bulk which helps it set up. Like other sweepers, Altaria is fairly easy to play with, as it can easily set up Dragon Dances on most resisted moves, potentially obtaining two or more boosts. From then on, Altaria can outspeed almost every Pokemon in the tier and fire off its Dragon-type STAB attacks. As Outrage has the drawback of locking Altaria in and causing confusion, Dragon Claw is a more reliable, albeit weaker, option for Altaria. Natural Cure, although less useful for Altaria than it is on support variants, still helps Altaria significantly, ensuring that a stray Thunder Wave or burn from Scald doesn't cripple Altaria for the rest of the match. However, in order to activate Natural Cure, Altaria must switch out, which removes any boosts it might have obtained. Although Altaria can hit everything in the tier for at least neutral damage, it still struggles against defensive behemoths such as Tangrowth and Steelix. Therefore, Pokemon such as Magneton are excellent partners for Altaria, as Magneton traps and disposes of almost every Steel-type in the tier, paving the way for an Altaria sweep. As Altaria detests Stealth Rock, a Rapid Spin user such as Kabutops or Cryogonal makes a good teammate.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Altaria's Flying typing, great natural bulk, and the ability to straight up not care about status gives it a niche over Dragonair as a defensive Dragon Dance user. This set is super easy to set up when used on a team with Magneton support, as it ensures that Steel-types are out of the picture before sweeping the other team. This set also easily fits on stall-based teams as a win condition to sweep late-game, since it offers a ton of resistances, an immunity to Toxic Spikes, and great coverage in just Dragon Claw. Dragon Claw is used over Outrage so that Altaria can come in and tank, as it limits Altaria's susceptibility to being revenge killed since it can immediately switch out if need be. Plus, it takes a few boosts for Altaria to get very threatening anyway, so it can afford the drop in power. Safeguard or Heal Bell lets Altaria set up on Pokemon like Slowking, Qwilfish, and Amoonguss without worrying about status. Safeguard is preferred because it totally blocks paralysis and sleep, though Hell Bell helps the whole team and allows Altaria to switch into status (other than sleep) and heal it off. It should be noted that Safeguard does not prevent the confusion from Outrage as well should you choose to go with that.</p> <p>64 Speed EVs lets Altaria outpace positive-natured base 95s after a boost, and the specially defensive spread lowers the chance that Altaria is 2HKOed by Ice Beam from Slowking and Lanturn if it Roosts and then sets up. As stated before, Outrage can go over Dragon Claw, but the point of this set is to be able to sweep without anything getting in its way, so the confusion side effect is not wanted; an offensive Dragon Dance set makes better use of Outrage anyway. Magneton support is amazing for this set since it uses mono-Dragon coverage, and having Steel-types out of the way makes the sweep easier. Magneton can also leave a nice dent in Tangrowth, Alomomola, and other bulky Pokemon that can tank a couple Dragon Claws.</p> <p>Altaria will never get so obscenely strong that it'll OHKO the opponent with Dragon Claw, even at +6. However, that isn't a problem for Altaria as it can simply out-tank a huge portion of the tier. While it won't OHKO many opponents, it easily 2HKOes most of the tier after a couple of boosts, and is rarely even 4HKOed in return by most defensive Pokemon. When beginning to set up, Safeguard should be used first to block status, followed by Dragon Dance. Use Roost when necessary, and begin the onslaught once Altaria outspeeds the entirety of the opponent's team. Be wary of bringing out Altaria too early though, as it can be revenge killed by most physical Rock-type moves, most notably Stone Edge from Choice Band Entei and Rock Blast from Crustle and Rhydon.</p> <p>Teams that have a bit of a problem with Fighting-types should choose Altaria over Dragonair as a defensive Dragon Dance user. The Ground-type, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes immunities are also other perks that Altaria offers over other Dragon-types in RU. Rapid Spin support is needed for Altaria, and Kabutops is probably best to provide it, though Cryogonal works better on more defensive teams. Altaria absolutely demolishes Fire / Water / Grass cores, so teams that benefit from that will love Altaria. It provides a nice defensive backbone in the early- and mid-game, and a formidable sweeper in the late-game once Steel- and Rock-type Pokemon are out of the way.</p> "

  "Zangoose": {
    "overview": "<p>Ever since its introduction in ADV, Zangoose was always outclassed with little to stand out among the plethora of Normal-types available in the lower tiers. It was often thrown aside for bigger and better options such as Swellow and Ursaring. This is no longer true, as Zangoose hit the jackpot when it comes to Dream World abilities. Zangoose's new ability, Toxic Boost, functions a lot like Guts, boosting Zangoose's Attack stat if its afflicted with the poison status. This is a godsend for Zangoose, shooting its already high Attack to astronomical levels after only being in for one turn. Combine this newfound power with Zangoose's above average base 90 Speed and one of the most powerful STAB moves in the game in the form of Facade, and you have a monster on your hands. Sadly, there is one very important attribute holding Zangoose back, and that is its frailty. 73 / 60 / 60 defenses are nothing to write home about, and with no notable resistances to take advantage of, it can be quite hard to switch Zangoose in and activate Toxic Orb. Zangoose is also held back by its own Toxic Orb; while the poison status gives Zangoose enough power to break down a brick wall with its bare hands, it also puts Zangoose on a timer, slowly wearing it down over the course of the match. Nonetheless, Zangoose's incredible power makes it a threat to watch out for, and it would be foolish to underestimate it, despite its frailty.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As a Normal-type, Zangoose has a pretty varied movepool with quite a few options; sadly, there's usually no reason to use any of them due to the sheer power of a Toxic Boosted Facade. Zangoose is capable of using a wide array of special moves such as Fire Blast, Giga Drain, Focus Blast, and Ice Beam, but none of them are worth it in the long run thanks to the power of Facade. Zangoose can potentially use Double Kick over Close Combat to break down Substitutes, but the power drop is very noticeable. The elemental punches can be useful at times for hitting certain Pokemon such as Escavalier and the rare Torterra harder than Facade, but keep in mind that in the majority of cases Facade will do more than enough to the Pokemon in question anyway, making the punches obsolete. Zangoose can choose to use an item other than Toxic Orb such as Life Orb, Choice Band, or Silk Scarf if you think you can predict Toxics well enough to get the boost, but it makes Zangoose pretty unreliable and the extra item boost usually isn't worth it unless Zangoose switches into a random Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because of how hard Zangoose hits with Toxic Boost taken into account, foolproof counters are few and far between, but there are plenty of ways to stop a rampant Zangoose from sweeping your whole team. Spiritomb is your best bet when it comes to countering Zangoose; it's completely immune to Facade and Close Combat, while its secondary Dark-type makes it take little from Night Slash. Spiritomb can then trap Zangoose with Pursuit in return, eliminating it from the match. Fast paced offensive teams can minimize the amount of damage Zangoose can do by taking advantage of its frailty, giving it little to no opportunity to switch in with powerful STAB attacks and crippling status. Outside of Spiritomb, perhaps the best way to stop Zangoose is to wear it down with its own Toxic Orb, playing around Zangoose's coverage moves with various resists as the poison damage chips away at Zangoose's HP until it falls. If all else fails, faster opponents that can take a Quick Attack are able to revenge kill Zangoose quite easily thanks to its frailty and lack of notable resistances. Choice Scarf Rotom-C, Aerodactyl, Sceptile, and Durant are all perfectly capable of pulling this off with their high Speed stats and strong offensive presence.</p> ",

        "name": "Toxic Boost",
        "description": "<p>With Toxic Boost to boost its Attack stat, excellent coverage, priority, and a bone crushingly powerful STAB, Zangoose is a perfect candidate for a physical attacker set. The basic objective of the set is to get in safely and then get a boost from the Toxic Orb to start a sweep. While Facade starts off with only 70 Base Power, its Base Power doubles when Zangoose is afflicted with a status problem, so once Zangoose's Toxic Orb activates, Facade has an effective 140 Base Power. Now add on STAB and you have a massively powerful attack that's capable of 2HKOing anything that doesn't resist it. Close Combat takes care of anything that would happen to resist Zangoose's Facade such as Steelix, Ferroseed, Kabutops, and Aggron, all of which take huge amounts of damage. Night Slash rounds off Zangoose's coverage by giving it a solid option to hit the Ghost-types that are immune to both Close Combat and Facade such as Rotom and Misdreavus, allowing Zangoose to break through these Pokemon with little team support. Lastly, Quick Attack provides Zangoose with a decently powerful priority move, a great emergency weapon against faster Pokemon that might otherwise stop Zangoose's sweep prematurely. Zangoose can also give up Night Slash for Swords Dance to further bolster its Attack stat if it gets a boost in; after a Swords Dance boost, Zangoose is fully capable of cleanly OHKOing Tangrowth with Facade, among other incredible feats.</p> <p>Although Zangoose has quite a few alternative options to use on this set, thanks to the immense Base Power of Facade outranking the power of even super effective coverage moves most of the time, they usually aren't needed. If you want a safer way to consistently activate Zangoose's Toxic Orb, Protect is certainly an option, but the vast majority of the time you will miss something about whatever move you replaced, whether it be the power of Facade, the coverage of Close Combat or Night Slash, or the utility of Quick Attack. Like all physical attackers, Zangoose appreciates a teammate that can set up multiple layers of entry hazards to secure some KOs on some really bulky Pokemon such as Tangrowth. Smeargle is excellent at this job, being able to set up every hazard in the game, while also being able to pull its own weight by using Spore to essentially eliminate one Pokemon from the match. If Smeargle doesn't appeal to your tastes, there are plenty of other options for hazard setters such as Crustle, Ferroseed, Uxie, and Omastar. Although Zangoose is a very powerful Pokemon, there is one threat it has significant trouble breaking through: Spiritomb. Therefore, teammates that can readily deal with it are very much appreciated. Aggron, Escavalier, and Klinklang are all good examples of Spiritomb counters, being able to come in on any of its standard attacks bar Will-O-Wisp and either strike back with an incredibly powerful Head Smash or Megahorn or set up a Substitute to avoid status and set up to +6, respectively. Hariyama is also a good way to keep Spiritomb in check, taking almost nothing from its attacks and using the burn from Will-O-Wisp to its advantage with Guts. Zangoose works well with many of the other Normal-types in RU, such as Tauros and Swellow, and thanks to their similar checks and counters, one can come in and either eliminate or weaken the opponent's Normal-type check, giving the second Normal-type a clear opportunity to sweep. Zangoose is especially good at this thanks to its immense power and ability to break through many Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon with Close Combat.</p> "

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>The sound of Crawdaunt snapping its claws is enough to leave most of the tier crying for mercy. Its powerful, Adaptability-boosted STAB moves have almost unresisted coverage in RU, and hit the majority of physical walls for super effective damage. Crawdaunt can comfortably 2HKO defensive titans such as Slowking, Uxie, and even Steelix! Crawdaunt's Speed is the only thing holding it back from sweeping, but this can easily be remedied with the use of Dragon Dance. With a couple of Attack and Speed boosts under its belt, Crawdaunt can outspeed and OHKO almost everything in the tier. Unfortunately, along with its low Speed, Crawdaunt has rather poor defenses as well, which means that it will likely fall to faster opponents. Crawdaunt's small movepool also makes it extremely predictable. However, it would be foolish to ever dismiss Crawdaunt as a threat; its sky-high Attack stat, powerful STAB combination, and access to Dragon Dance are often all it needs to slice through whole teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of the listed moves, Crawdaunt's movepool is extremely barren and unappealing. Swords Dance is an alternative boosting move that lets Crawdaunt OHKO almost everything in the tier. However, it is mostly outclassed by Dragon Dance, as it does not boost Crawdaunt's pitiful Speed, and the extra Attack boost is normally not required for Crawdaunt to sweep. Crawdaunt's Special Attack stat is decent, so it can use Ice Beam to surprise Tangrowth. However, Crunch has a chance to 2HKO and has much better coverage across the tier. Crawdaunt can opt to use a Choice Scarf to become a potent revenge killer and late-game sweeper, but it is still relatively slow; even with the Choice Scarf boost, Crawdaunt is outsped by unboosted Galvantula and Sceptile.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best Pokemon that can completely counter Crawdaunt is Poliwrath. More specifically, the RestTalk set can shrug off status and avoid being worn down. It can then proceed to Circle Throw Crawdaunt away, preventing Crawdaunt from accumulating too many boosts. Defensive variants of Tangrowth and Alomomola can also take on Crawdaunt; however, Alomomola can do little back to Crawdaunt if the latter has Substitute. The only move that Tangrowth fears is the rare Ice Beam. Ferroseed can comfortably take Crawdaunt's STAB attacks, but it must be wary of a potential Superpower. It can even choose to run Seed Bomb or Bullet Seed to avoid letting Substitute Crawdaunt set up on it. Qwilfish is in a similar boat; while it can wall Crawdaunt with a combination of Intimidate and its typing, it can do little back and will eventually fall as it has no reliable recovery. However, in that time, it can set up numerous layers of Spikes and Haze away any boosts Crawdaunt hopes to accrue.</p> <p>Due to the sheer power of Crawdaunt's attacks, revenge killing it is often an easier task than walling it is. Even after a Dragon Dance, Crawdaunt isn't very fast and can be outsped by most Choice Scarf users and fast sweepers. Choice Scarf variants of Galvantula, Rotom, and Manectric can all outspeed even +2 Crawdaunt and fry it with their STAB Electric-type attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>While most of the game's most powerful Dragon Dance sweepers are locked away in higher tiers, Crawdaunt can use this excellent boosting move to wreak havoc in RU. Dragon Dance patches up Crawdaunt's normally poor Speed while skyrocketing its excellent Attack stat to jaw-dropping levels. For example, +1 Waterfall OHKOes even Steelix after Stealth Rock. After two Dragon Dance boosts, only the fastest Choice Scarf users and the strongest priority attackers will be able to halt Crawdaunt's rampage. Waterfall and Crunch are Crawdaunt's primary attacks, as both are boosted by STAB and Adaptability, and hit the majority of RU of at least neutral damage. Crawdaunt has little trouble plowing through dedicated physical walls such as Slowking and Steelix with its STAB attacks.</p> <p>Substitute is the main option in the last slot; it protects Crawdaunt from status, and lets it comfortably set up on defensive Pokemon such as Ferroseed that lack a Grass-type move. It also shields Crawdaunt from revenge killers and priority users hoping to switch in while Crawdaunt is exposed. Superpower is a viable alternative, as it eliminates one of Crawdaunt's biggest counters, Ferroseed. However, if you choose to run Substitute, then only the rare Bullet Seed or Seed Bomb Ferroseed will be able to stop Crawdaunt from boosting to +6, which makes Superpower largely redundant. Nonetheless, Superpower does give Crawdaunt a stronger hit on Poliwrath, and also takes down Clefable even without any boosts.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature let Crawdaunt beat all base 105 Speed Pokemon after a single Dragon Dance, while maximum Attack investment gives it a lot of power. The choice of item is more flexible: Leftovers is best used in conjunction with Substitute to supplement the HP lost from setting up, while Life Orb is more suitable for sets that choose to run Superpower. Notably, the Life Orb boost guarantees the OHKO on Feraligatr and offensive Drapion after a Dragon Dance. Lum Berry is the final option to let Crawdaunt set up on status moves such as the common Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave. Instead of Waterfall, Crawdaunt can choose to run Crabhammer, which is slightly stronger and has a high critical hit ratio. Unfortunately, its accuracy is subpar, and a miss could easily spell doom for the rather frail Crawdaunt.</p> <p>Although Crawdaunt is a mighty offensive force, it has trouble taking strong attacks. Ferroseed is a great partner for Crawdaunt as it can soak up Electric- and Grass-type attacks for Crawdaunt, and also set up entry hazards to aid Crawdaunt's sweep. Furthermore, Ferroseed can paralyze faster opponents with Thunder Wave to make Crawdaunt's sweep even easier. Rotom is another great teammate that can take the Fighting- and Bug-type moves that Crawdaunt hates, and spread around Will-O-Wisp, which makes it easier for Crawdaunt to set up.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Crawdaunt's excellent Attack stat, access to Adaptability, and almost unresisted two-move coverage makes a Choice Band set a terrific option for it. Waterfall, one of Crawdaunt's two STAB attacks, has excellent coverage in the tier, and hits Pokemon such as Steelix and Moltres for super effective damage. With Waterfall and Crunch alone, Crawdaunt can shred through some of the bulkiest walls in the tier, while anything frail is likely to be completely crushed and mutilated. In fact, it has such great power that it can 2HKO frailer Pokemon that resist it, such as Sceptile and Feraligatr. Crunch hits just as hard as Waterfall and scores super effective hits on Uxie and Dusknoir, some of the bulkiest physical walls in the tier. Superpower rounds out Crawdaunt's impeccable coverage by hitting Ferroseed super effectively and hitting Poliwrath for at least neutral damage. However, it should only be used against Ferroseed, Poliwrath, and bulkier Normal-types such as Clefable, as Waterfall and Crunch are generally more powerful. Because Crawdaunt has impeccable coverage in only three moves, it can use Toxic in the last slot to deal with the few bulky walls that it cannot get past, such as Tangrowth and Alomomola. Toxic is also the only way Crawdaunt can effectively damage Poliwrath although the latter can still defeat Crawdaunt if it runs Rest.</p> <p>Choice Band makes this set, as it makes Crawdaunt's attacks almost impossible to wall. While it does have the unfortunate side effect of locking Crawdaunt into only one move, Crawdaunt can normally get away with being Choice-locked as its moves are so powerful that even Pokemon that resist them will be left hurting. The standard EV spread for a physical attacker is used, as investing in Crawdaunt's pitiful defenses would be a waste. An Adamant nature is preferred as Crawdaunt should only need to outspeed walls, and it need the extra power to secure certain KOs, such as the guaranteed 2HKO on Alomomola and Leafeon after Stealth Rock. 252 Speed EVs let Crawdaunt outspeed and 2HKO uninvested Magneton, Mandibuzz, and Aggron. Crabhammer raises Crawdaunt's damage output further, but its poor accuracy is often not worth it as Crawdaunt has enough power already, and common Crawdaunt counters, such as Tangrowth, resist Water-type attacks anyway. Knock Off can replace Toxic as Crawdaunt's utility move of choice; it reduces prediction and can cripple walls dependent on Leftovers or Eviolite. Additionally, Knock Off can OHKO Kadabra and Jynx, and 2HKO Rotom and Cryogonal.</p> <p>Ferroseed is a great partner for Crawdaunt, as it can set up entry hazards; three layers of Spikes help Crawdaunt obtain 2HKOs on Tangrowth and Poliwrath. Ferroseed can also take Grass- and Electric-type attacks that plague Crawdaunt, as well as provide Thunder Wave and Leech Seed support. Pokemon that struggle to break through common physical walls, such as Klinklang and Scyther, appreciate Crawdaunt's help; Crawdaunt can weaken or remove walls such as Steelix to pave the way for a sweep.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This set allows Crawdaunt to turn the tables on its common counters, employing the sheer power of its STAB moves along with Ice Beam to gain sterling super effective coverage on RU's premier walls. Crawdaunt's oft-overlooked base 90 Special Attack provides overwhelming strength combined with a Life Orb, boosting nature, and its wonderful ability, Adaptability. Surf OHKOes Quagsire with a small amount of prior damage, while Dark Pulse is a guaranteed OHKO on Qwilfish after Stealth Rock and a comfortable 2HKO on Alomomola. It is also Crawdaunt's weapon against bulky Psychic-types such as Uxie. Ice Beam is used to simply OHKO Tangrowth and 2HKO Amoonguss and physically defensive Roselia.</p> <p>There are two main options for the last slot, both of which give this set a particular niche. Superpower is preferred for its chance to 2HKO Ferroseed and annihilate dedicated special walls such as Cryogonal and Clefable. Hidden Power Grass can be used to astonish your opponent by blowing past Crawdaunt's hardest counter, Poliwrath, in a mere two hits. It also guarantees the OHKO on Quagsire, although bear in mind that due to Adaptability, Dark Pulse and Surf are stronger than Hidden Power Grass unless the opponent is 4x weak to it. Crawdaunt's Speed is still abysmal though, so it's not going to sweep any time soon. Crawdaunt's defenses haven't gotten any better either, but as this set is focused on breaking down dedicated physical walls, neither flaw is a major issue for Crawdaunt.</p> <p>A Life Orb and a positive Special Attack nature are necessary for this set to function, so a simple EV spread is used to allow Crawdaunt to reach its full offensive potential while Speed tying with Bouffalant, Golurk, and Omastar. A Modest nature should be used if using Hidden Power Grass, but otherwise, Rash is preferred to keep Superpower's damage output high. Substitute is another option in the final slot in order to take advantage of the switches this set forces, but sacrifices coverage. Crunch is an option to better deal with Lanturn, but is inferior to Superpower otherwise. Hidden Power Fire is another potential choice to slaughter unsuspecting Ferroseed and Escavalier in one blow with a little prior damage, but serves no other purpose and forces an imperfect Speed IV. Speaking of which, Dragon Dance is viable to boost Crawdaunt's Speed, but such a set is outclassed by physical variants. Powerful physical attackers that enjoy weakened or outright fainted physical walls and bulky Water-types are particularly good partners for this set; Entei, Kabutops, Emboar, and Feraligatr are prime examples of such. As this set has no means to boost Speed, paralysis support from teammates such as Uxie and Amoonguss is greatly appreciated. Both also match up well against Poliwrath, while Ferroseed is another reliable user of Thunder Wave. All three share good defensive synergy with Crawdaunt and provide further utility such as absorbing Toxic Spikes or laying down entry hazards to aid Crawdaunt's rampage.</p> <p>Crawdaunt without Hidden Power Grass is still outright walled by Poliwrath as well as unable to defeat faster opponents using Electric, Grass, Fighting, or Bug attacks. This means a reliable teammate to deal with these threats such as Roselia or Amoonguss is recommended. Steelix is another teammate to deal with everything Crawdaunt fears bar Fighting- and Grass-types packing Hidden Power Fire. Emboar also has excellent defensive synergy with Crawdaunt as well as a potent offensive symbiosis, being able to tank Bug- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Crawdaunt. Finally, Golurk has no fear of the Bug, Fighting, and Electric moves that Crawdaunt hates, and both Emboar and Golurk highly appreciate the gaps this particular Crawdaunt opens up in the opposing team by defeating Alomomola and Tangrowth.</p> "

Recover helps it survive powerful assaults, and its decent typing helps it take on the majority of special attackers.

Another downfall is the lack of permanent sandstorm inducers in the tier, making Cradily miss out on the Special Defense boost that sandstorm provides.

Substitute can be used alongside Toxic and Recover to form a stalling set, but Cradily's low Speed makes it difficult to set up. A Choice Band can raise its attack, but locking Cradily into a single move gives the opponent the opportunity to set up. Mirror Coat is a nasty surprise for special attackers; just make sure your prediction is top notch. Cradily can support its teammates with Sunny Day and hit the opponent with Solar Beam, but there are much better things it could be doing with its time. Finally, Cradily has access to Rock Polish to raise its Speed, but even after a boost it won't be outrunning much.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fighting-types take little damage from Rock-type moves, making Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan good counters. Fighting-type moves are generally a good way to defeat Cradily, and repeated hits will take its toll on Cradily's health. Lilligant and Tangrowth can switch into Earthquake and Seed Bomb and put Cradily to sleep; however, beware of Hidden Power Fire. Weezing can take anything Cradily can throw at it with a combination of Haze, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split. A vague definition of a Cradily counter is anything with good Defense; Cradily doesn't have the power to break through defensive behemoths, such as Steelix, and is easily defeated. Moltres can switch into Cradily's Earthquake and Seed Bomb and threaten it with powerful STAB moves. Aggron can take on sets that lack Earthquake, while Altaria can set up against sets without Stone Edge. Cradily relies on setup moves, making Taunt and Haze two of its biggest enemies.

  "Armaldo": {
    "overview": "<p>Armaldo is a weird Pokemon, to put it bluntly. Its main niche is Rapid Spin, but its stat distribution and typing make it an extremely awkward candidate for this role. Speaking of its typing, Bug / Rock doesn't really do Armaldo any favors. While it leaves Armaldo with relatively few weaknesses in just Water, Rock, and Steel, it also only offers resistances to Poison and Normal. Not only that, but Armaldo is also weak to Stealth Rock and takes damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which sucks for a Pokemon whose main role and niche is spinning away said hazards. However, its typing does give it a neutrality to most common attacking types that other spinners are weak to, including Fighting, Ground, Fire, and Flying. Armaldo's main perks as a spinner are its gigantic base 125 Attack stat and deadly STAB combination. It also has a nice base 100 Defense stat, which makes it a formidable tank. It's too bad that its huge Attack stat and awesome offensive STAB combination are wasted on such a slow Pokemon. All in all, Armaldo is probably the worst spinner worth considering in RU; however, it provides a couple of unique niches, so it's still worth a look into if you want to try something different.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance and Rock Polish can be used to turn Armaldo into a standalone sweeper, but both are really hard to use as Armaldo is basically impossible to set up. Not to mention that both sets are highly outclassed by Crustle who is a better sweeper thanks to its access to Shell Smash. Armaldo has access to a variety of Fighting-type moves, including Superpower and Brick Break, which can be used to blow through Ferroseed and achieve a neutral hit on Fighting-types. It should be noted that a Choice Band Low Kick 2HKOes Steelix, something Earthquake sometimes misses out on. Double-Edge and Return can be used for greater neutral coverage as well, though Seismic Toss is usually better due to its neutral hit on Steel-types and its ability to break most Pokemon's Substitutes. Knock Off is available to cripple Pokemon that rely almost solely on their item, though this doesn't really matter to Armaldo as it 2HKOes most of the tier with its offensive sets, and removing the Ghost's held items usually won't help your team eliminate them. Finally, Rock Slide can be used as a more reliable Rock-type STAB attack, though the drop in power is too much in most situations.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most Ghost-types not named Rotom are a safe first switch into Armaldo, as they can block its attempts at Rapid Spin and proceed to burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Golurk is probably the best switch in as it doesn't mind a Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge. Most Water-types not named Slowking will have their way with Armaldo as well, with nearly every special Water-type attack nearly OHKOing it. Qwilfish in particular laughs in the face of Armaldo thanks to Intimidate and its typing, not even fearing an Earthquake in most situations. Steelix will normally not care much about Armaldo, can set up Stealth Rock against it, and hit it with a super effective Gyro Ball. Klinklang can easily set up on Armaldo with Shift Gear, though it shouldn't try setting up a Substitute due to Earthquake and Seismic Toss breaking its Substitutes. In general, most strong attackers, even physical attackers, will blow right through Armaldo. Keep in mind though that it's actually really hard to OHKO Armaldo without a super effective attack, so beware when trying to sweep with something such as Life Orb Moltres, Typhlosion, or Galvantula.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Armaldo's huge Attack stat and wide movepool is taken advantage to the fullest with a Choice Band set. X-Scissor is the main draw of this set, and is Armaldo's main STAB attack. With X-Scissor, Armaldo cuts cleanly through the popular Regenerator core of Tangrowth and Slowking--even outspeeding the latter--as well as easily KOing the likes of Uxie. Stone Edge and Earthquake work together to give Armaldo perfect neutral coverage in RU. The last slot is mostly filler, but both moves have their uses: Rapid Spin is the main choice, as the only one Ghost-type that can take the chance to switch into Choice Band Armaldo safely is Golurk. Rotom and Spiritomb are cleanly 2HKOed by Stone Edge, forcing them to risk the chance of eating a Stone Edge in order to switch in on Rapid Spin. The consistent 2HKO on these Ghost-types is also the reason why Stone Edge is the main choice for the Rock-type STAB move; however, Rock Blast is a viable alternative to punish Substitute users, particularly Rotom. Aqua Tail is a viable alternative to Rapid Spin, because Rapid Spin is an awful move to get locked into and forces Armaldo to switch out after using it. Aqua Tail is also nice to nail Sandslash harder than Armaldo's other moves.</p> <p>The EVs are designed to outrun minimum Speed Tangrowth. From there an Adamant nature and max Attack EVs give Armaldo the most bang for its buck, with the remaining EVs placed into HP to make use of Armaldo's bulk. An alternative EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe can be used instead, though then you're wasting Armaldo's decent bulk. It's also not recommended to run such a spread because Armaldo is susceptible to all entry hazards, which means that any extra bulk could be the difference between getting OHKOed or 2HKOed.</p> <p>Ghost-types are still liable to switch in on this set, particularly Rotom, who is immune to Earthquake and Rapid Spin and can survive X-Scissor easily enough. From there said Ghost-types can burn Armaldo with Will-O-Wisp, effectively putting it out of commission. Dark-types with Pursuit, such as Spiritomb and Drapion, are excellent teammates to get rid of the pesky poltergeists. With Ghost-types removed, Armaldo is then able to use Rapid Spin freely, possibly opening a sweep for a teammate weak to entry hazards, like Entei. Choice Band Armaldo excels at breaking through Regenerator cores and balanced teams, making it an excellent addition to most offensive and balanced teams. Choice Band Armaldo doesn't need much team support, and instead is there on the team to provide support for sweepers. With a Regenerator core of Tangrowth and Slowking blown open, a teammate along the lines of Feraligatr, Crawdaunt, or Hitmonlee is free to set up and destroy the opposition.</p> <p>Because Armaldo is so slow, it's incredibly easy to revenge kill. Therefore, having defensive walls that can switch into a variety of opponents is a good idea. Poliwrath is an excellent teammate as it can switch into Water-, Steel-, and Rock-type attacks with ease, as well as phaze any set up attempts with Circle Throw. Quagsire is an excellent teammate in this regard as well. Armaldo's Special Defense leaves a lot to be desired, and having a specially defensive teammate, such as Slowking or Roselia, that can take most special attacks thrown Armaldo's way is also a good idea. Roselia can also set up Spikes, which makes KOing Tangrowth, Slowking, and other threats much easier. In fact, entry hazards in general push many 2HKOs into OHKOs for Armaldo, making Steelix, Uxie, and Qwilfish fantastic teammates as well.</p> <p>If you're having trouble making Rapid Spin work on this set, then packing another spinner is a good idea. Armaldo can then work as a sort of lure to KO the Ghost-types that stand in your other spinner's way. Cryogonal and Sandslash make great teammates in this respect, as well as Hitmonchan. Having a different spinner also takes the pressure off of Armaldo, and also lets it switch in more often, as Armaldo will continue to take damage from all entry hazards.</p> "

        "name": "Rapid Spin Support",
        "description": "<p>The main goal of this set is to pull off a Rapid Spin, and the rest of the moves and EVs help Armaldo achieve this goal. Stealth Rock is placed in the second slot for further team support; Armaldo is the only Pokemon, apart from Sandslash, with this unique combination of moves in RU. However, if Stealth Rock is not needed or another teammate can set it up, Toxic should go in this slot. Toxic is fantastic for crippling the Ghost-types that will be switching into Armaldo to block Rapid Spin, particularly Rotom, Dusknoir, Spiritomb, and Golurk. Rock Blast is the recommended Rock STAB move of choice on this set as it breaks through Rotom's Substitutes and continue to hit it. Plus, thanks to Armaldo's gigantic Attack stat, even if it only hits twice it'll do a respectable amount of damage to a number of Pokemon in the tier. The last slot is a decision between X-Scissor and Seismic Toss. X-Scissor provides Armaldo with a tool to blast through Tangrowth, Slowking, and Uxie, the latter of which will usually try to set up Stealth Rock on Armaldo's team over and over again. X-Scissor also always breaks Gallade's Substitutes, even after a Bulk Up, as well as OHKO Lilligant and Sceptile. Earthquake is a great move to use if Fighting- and Steel-types give your team trouble. It also ensures that Klinklang can't set up a Substitute on Armaldo and deals a ton of damage to Qwilfish. With Earthquake, Armaldo is overall less susceptible to becoming set up bait to a majority of the RU tier.</p> <p>The EVs on this set focus on making Armaldo as physically bulky as possible. However, Armaldo is not a physical wall, and should not be played like one. In fact, even with full defensive investment, Armaldo is 2HKOed by many of the strongest physical attackers in the tier, including Choice Band Entei, Life Orb Hitmonlee, and Choice Scarf Medicham. Luckily, Armaldo is able to tank at least one hit from them, even after taking damage from Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes, and retaliate or use Rapid Spin, should the need arise.</p> <p>Toxic can go in the last slot as well if X-Scissor or Earthquake don't suit your fancy. Toxic is this set's best weapon against the bulky Ghost-types in the tier, so anything that can help your teammates defeat them is always a good thing. Stone Edge can also be used over Rock Blast for consistent damage, though it doesn't hit through Rotom's Substitutes, one of the major draws to this set.</p> <p>Support Armaldo needs teammates that can eliminate the opponent's Ghost-types so that Armaldo can Rapid Spin freely. Dark-type Pursuit users are probably the best way to remove said Ghost-types, making Spiritomb, Absol, Drapion, and Skuntank welcomed partners. Armaldo is outrun by nearly the whole tier, meaning Armaldo is hilariously easy to revenge kill. As Armaldo is probably your only spinner, keeping it alive until you're sure that your opponent won't, or can't, set up any more entry hazards is a top priority. As such, teammates that can switch into Water-type attacks or remove enemy Water-types with ease are required. Ferroseed, Tangrowth, Roselia, Manectric, and Lanturn all fill this role admirably. Rock-type attacks from the likes of Choice Band Aggron are also dangerous, making Quagsire, Rhydon, and Steelix good teammates too. Poliwrath in particular is a great teammate, as it resists Rock-, Water-, and Steel-type attacks, and can make use of the Stealth Rock Armaldo sets up with Circle Throw.</p> <p>Finally, as the main goal of this set is to fire off Rapid Spin, Pokemon that can take full advantage of an entry hazard-less field are the best teammates. Moltres, Scyther, Entei, Accelgor, and Jynx are all highly crippled by entry hazards, and having a clear field gives them the most time to sweep the enemy's team. Teams that make use of multiple Eviolite users will also enjoy having a spinner clear the field of hazards, making Roselia that much of a better partner, as it is able to switch into strong special attacks with ease.</p> "

        "name": "Swift Swim + Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Armaldo received a neat little toy from the Dream World in Swift Swim. Under the rain and with max Speed, Armaldo reaches a Speed stat of 378, enough to outrun all unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, with the exception of Aerodactyl, Accelgor, and Ninjask. When Armaldo switches in, the first thing you should try to do is set up Swords Dance. From there Armaldo is able to outspeed most of the metagame and OHKO a large portion of it with the appropriate move. X-Scissor is used to smite all Grass-types and Slowking in your rain team's path. Stone Edge is for secondary STAB, and is a stronger neutral hit than X-Scissor. It's also great for destroying the Bug- and Flying-types that normally give rain teams trouble; it helps in that Armaldo outspeeds most of them, such as Life Orb Galvantula, Life Orb Moltres, and Aerodactyl. The last slot goes to Aqua Tail, which gives Armaldo another \"STAB\" attack to use in the rain, and destroys Sandslash and Rhydon.</p> <p>An Adamant nature and max Speed is used to outrun Sceptile and all other Pokemon with base 120 Speed or less, with the rest placed into Attack to give Armaldo as much power as possible. Jolly can be used in place of Adamant to outspeed Aerodactyl, but there's a large drop in power to do so. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Spe and a Jolly nature can be used to tank hits from Choice Scarf Manectric and Choice Scarf Rotom-C better and eliminate them; these two Pokemon are normally very dangerous to rain teams. However, breaking through Ferroseed is a bit harder with this EV spread. Superpower can be used to smash through Ferroseed, while Earthquake gets a stronger hit on the other Steel- and Rock-types that stand in Armaldo's way.</p> <p>Armaldo's role on a rain team is to smash through the Grass-types that normally give them trouble, particularly Roselia, Ferroseed, and Lilligant. At +2, X-Scissor is a clean 2HKO on Ferroseed (64.04 - 75.34%), as well as an OHKO on every other Grass-type in the tier and Slowking. Armaldo should not, however, try to set up Swords Dance on Ferroseed, as Gyro Ball is a 2HKO in return. Instead, Armaldo should find time to set up on Pokemon it scares out or can tank an attack from, such as Magneton, Accelgor, Bouffalant, and Electivire. Even if Armaldo can't find the time to set up Swords Dance, X-Scissor will still deal a ton of damage to the Grass-types that Armaldo is there to eliminate.</p> <p>Pokemon that can set up Rain Dance reliably are required teammates. Uxie and Mesprit are fantastic in this regard, as they can set up Stealth Rock and Rain Dance, and then give Armaldo a safe switch in with a slow U-turn. Armaldo is weak to Water, which is only exacerbated by the rain you set up, so a Pokemon immune or resistant to Water to switch in reliably is best as a teammate. Poliwrath is a brilliant partner since it is immune to Water, and resists Rock and Steel too. Slowking and Lanturn are great partners as well, with the latter able to use the rain to its advantage to fire off STAB Thunders with 100% accuracy. Armaldo tends to lure in Pokemon that would normally be terrified of rain teams, such as Sandslash and Steelix, which can be used as set up fodder for your other rain sweepers once they're in. Gorebyss, Ludicolo, Omastar, and Kabutops are all fantastic rain sweepers that enjoy Ferroseed and other Grass-types out of the way, or at least severely maimed. Finally, this set can be used outside of a rain team, but then you're using a worse Rhydon, which is faster and sports a better typing.</p> "

  "Absol": {
    "overview": "<p>While it's a bit too frail to function well in higher tiers, Absol has cemented itself as one of the best Dark-types and overall offensive Pokemon in RU, and it's not hard to see why. Absol is well-known for possessing what is bar none the most powerful priority move in the entire game in the form of its STAB Sucker Punch, and this is what makes it so dangerous in RU, as it makes up for Absol's average Speed stat, revenge kills a slew of threats such as Accelgor, Rotom-C, and Sceptile, and cleans up rather nicely late-game. Outside of this powerful move, Absol happens to be one of the best users of Pursuit in the tier, trapping and eliminating threats such as Slowking, Uxie, Mesprit, and Rotom for its teammates and starting mind games with the opponent in combination with Sucker Punch. Combine these two moves with Swords Dance, a high critical hit ratio thanks to Super Luck, and coverage moves to get past would-be checks such as Tangrowth, Steelix, and Escavalier, and Absol makes for a great offensive Pokemon. Keep in mind, however, that Absol struggles quite a bit with its frailty; most decently powerful moves will 2HKO Absol at worst, making it very hard to switch in and set up a Swords Dance. Absol struggles with Sucker Punch's drawback too, as faster Pokemon with the appropriate moves can force Absol into unfavorable situations and eventually play around it. All in all, despite these setbacks, underestimating Absol is a grave mistake, as one wrong move against it can mean the difference between a win and a loss.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf set is a viable option on Absol to give it a faster Pursuit and allow it to trap some of the faster Ghost- and Psychic-types more easily, but it's otherwise it's completely inferior to the all-out attacker set, trading Speed for a significant amount of power, the ability to switch moves, and the ability to utilize Sucker Punch effectively. To make matters worse, most of Absol's moves are bad to be locked into due to either a low Base Power or inconsistency. Choice Band Absol is in a similar boat, but doesn't even have a faster Pursuit to work with, making Life Orb and Dread Plate better options almost all the time. Substitute is an option on the Swords Dance set to block status, ease prediction, and possibly get more opportunities to set up a Swords Dance, but keep in mind that Absol misses a consistent Dark-type STAB move sorely, and it hates having to rely on Sucker Punch against Pokemon that either resist or are immune to Superpower and have non-attacking moves. Although Absol's Special Attack stat is somewhat low compared to its Attack stat, it actually has a decent special movepool to work with, including moves such as Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Grass that can be used to nail common checks and counters, such as Poliwrath and Quagsire. Magic Coat is a viable option over Fire Blast and Pursuit to reflect entry hazards and possible status moves effectively, but keep in mind that Magic Coat is very reliant on prediction and can easily be taken advantage of if you're not careful. Lastly, Absol makes a rather decent Baton Passer, able to pass Swords Dance boosts and Substitute to its teammates, although Absol's frailty often gets in the way of this and makes it harder to pass on the boosts without taking a beating.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>When it comes to beating Absol, Fighting-types are public enemy number one. Poliwrath, Hariyama, Gurdurr, and Emboar in particular can give Absol a lot of trouble, resisting its Dark-type STAB and either having the bulk to take a Superpower or outspeeding and OHKOing before Absol has the chance to strike back. Hitmonchan can trouble Absol by outpacing it by one point and striking it with Mach Punch before Absol can even move. Outside of Fighting-type Pokemon, Alomomola and Quagsire make for great checks to Absol, either having the physical bulk to take boosted Night Slashes or completely ignoring potential Swords Dance boosts altogether, all while wearing Absol down with Waterfall and Earthquake, respectively. Tangrowth is in a similar boat to Alomomola and Quagsire, taking pretty much any physical attack from Absol and striking back with a strong Power Whip or Giga Drain, but it's vulnerable to being hit by potential Fire Blasts. Escavalier can take any Dark-type move from Absol and even has the physical bulk to take a Superpower, but cannot take a Fire Blast after Stealth Rock (unless it is holding an Occa Berry), making it a somewhat shaky check. If all else fails, there are many other ways of defeating Absol that take advantage of its reliance on Sucker Punch to hit faster opponents. For example, faster Pokemon with Substitute can evade Absol's Sucker Punch and set up a Substitute as a cushion, allowing them to KO Absol next turn with no fear. Good examples of Pokemon that can do this include Sceptile, Rotom, Moltres, Klinklang, and Gallade. Faster Pokemon with Will-O-Wisp or Sleep Powder, such as Rotom, Rotom-C, and Lilligant, can help against Absol as well, forcing it to Sucker Punch and crippling it when it tries to do so. Lastly, faster Pokemon with priority moves, such as Entei with Extreme Speed, Kabutops with Aqua Jet, and Zangoose with Quick Attack, can get past Absol through bypassing its Sucker Punch and hitting Absol before it can strike.</p> ",

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>With a powerful STAB Sucker Punch, good coverage, and the ability to Pursuit trap, an all-out attacker set is a good choice for Absol. With this set, Absol can wallbreak, revenge kill, and clean up late-game rather efficiently, making it a dangerous threat. Of course, Sucker Punch is what makes Absol so good, and it's by far the most important move on this set, ensuring Absol doesn't get outpaced and revenge killed by faster threats and making up for its somewhat low Speed stat. Sucker Punch also gives Absol the ability to revenge kill, taking out threats such as Omastar, Sceptile, and Accelgor with ease before they become dangerous. When Absol doesn't need to rely on Sucker Punch to do serious damage to its opponent, Night Slash is its go to move. As it is only slightly less powerful than Sucker Punch and doesn't rely on the opponent attacking to work, Night Slash is a solid and consistent STAB move. The combination of Super Luck and Night Slash's naturally high critical hit rate is really good to boot, giving Absol a solid 25 percent chance of inflicting a critical hit whenever it uses Night Slash. Superpower rounds off Absol's coverage nicely, hitting Pokemon such as Aggron and actually giving Absol perfect neutral coverage between its STAB moves and Superpower, as all the Pokemon who resist the combination are locked up in higher tiers. As for the final move, it really depends on what you want Absol to do. Fire Blast gives Absol an extra coverage option that lets it get past certain common checks, including Tangrowth, Steelix, and Escavalier, more easily, 2HKOing all of them at worst. On the other hand, Pursuit makes Absol an effective trapper, letting it remove Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Slowking and Rotom that could give Absol's teammates a hard time.</p> <p>The given EVs are rather simple; as Absol is quite frail and won't be taking hits well, the EVs are geared to maximize Absol's offensive potential. A Naughty nature should be used whenever Fire Blast is being used for the extra power in exchange for special bulk. However, when running Pursuit, an Adamant nature is better overall. Alternatively, either a Jolly or Naive nature can be used on Absol, decreasing its overall power a little bit but giving Absol the ability to outpace neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon, such as Kabutops and Gallade, and hit them with Sucker Punch before they can use their own priority. Life Orb is the main option to give Absol a small amount of power on all of its moves, but Dread Plate is certainly a viable alternative, as it still gives a similar boost to Absol's Dark-type moves while giving it a bit more longevity by removing Life Orb recoil. Keep in mind that Superpower and Fire Blast are significantly weaker without Life Orb. Psycho Cut is a viable option in Absol's fourth moveslot to hit Qwilfish, Poliwrath, and other bulky Fighting-types slightly harder, but Fire Blast and particularly Pursuit generally have more utility overall, especially because of Psycho Cut's somewhat low Base Power.</p> <p>Because Absol struggles with the various Fighting-types in the tier, such as Poliwrath and Emboar, Pokemon that can deal with these threats are naturally good teammates. Slowking is a good example of a Pokemon that can take on Fighting-type Pokemon, pivoting in and out with its Fighting-type resist and Regenerator, while posing an immediate threat with STAB Psyshock. Qwilfish is another good example, using multiple common Fighting-type Pokemon as Spikes fodder, which makes Absol's sweeping job much easier. Other examples of good Fighting-type checks include Uxie, Mesprit, Golurk, and Sigilyph. Due to Absol being a great Pursuit trapper, Pokemon that benefit from this kind of support pair well with Absol. Hitmonlee and Medicham in particular appreciate Absol's Pursuit support, really benefiting from its ability to take out many of their checks and counters, such as Slowking, Rotom, and Uxie, and cleaning up later on in the game when these checks have been weakened or eliminated from the match.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Although Absol's mediocre bulk makes it somewhat challenging to set up sometimes, Swords Dance is still a viable option on Absol, boosting its really high Attack stat to intimidating levels and taking its infamous Sucker Punch to a whole new level of danger. Of course, outside of Swords Dance, Sucker Punch is still the most important move on Absol and what makes it threatening in the first place between its decently high Base Power and priority. After a Swords Dance, Sucker Punch even has the ability to OHKO frailer Pokemon that resist it, such as Hitmonlee and the rare Primeape, which shows just how strong +2 Absol really is. Once again, Night Slash provides Absol with a more consistent STAB move to use when it doesn't need to rely on Sucker Punch to outpace an opponent, hitting threats such as Slowking and Spiritomb without the risk of them not attacking and attempting to either recover or cripple Absol on the same turn. The critical hit ratio is deadly as well, and a critical hit coming from a +2 Absol can easily OHKO common defensive threats that would be able to take Absol on otherwise, such as Tangrowth and Alomomola. Superpower is used in the last slot to round off Absol's coverage and hit everything that resist Dark-type moves at least neutrally, and although it lowers Absol's Attack stat after using it, it's still a very useful move to have, and Absol can often continue to clean up even after using Superpower if it has used Swords Dance previously. Lastly, try to keep in mind that Absol's frailty makes it somewhat challenging to set up Swords Dance at times, and you will often have to take a risk to get a boost. For example, a good opportunity to try and get a Swords Dance boost is on a forced switch.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is used to boost the power of Sucker Punch as much as possible, but a Jolly nature is always a good alternative for the Speed it provides, letting Absol outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon and tie with max Speed Smeargle in exchange for a small amount of raw power. Life Orb is the main item to maximize Absol's damage output as much as possible; however, Lum Berry is a good choice as well, as it lets Absol set up more easily against status-using Pokemon such as Spiritomb. Psycho Cut can be used over Night Slash as a third coverage move to hit Poliwrath and Qwilfish a bit harder, but the consistent Dark-type STAB is often missed. Megahorn is in the same boat, hitting Tangrowth significantly harder, but without a consistent Dark-type STAB, Absol struggles against Ghost-types that can play around Sucker Punch, such as Misdreavus and Rotom.</p> <p>Fighting-types are quite an annoyance for Absol, as they can take pretty much any hit from Absol; therefore, teammates that can eliminate them are always helpful. Uxie, Mesprit, Slowking, and Spiritomb all perform well against Fighting-type Pokemon, as they resist or are immune to their STAB moves, have the bulk to take pretty much any coverage move from them, and can strike back with a STAB Psychic-type move or a crippling burn in return. Because Absol's frailty often makes it somewhat challenging to set up, dual screens are a good way to make Swords Dance Absol more effective, covering for its mediocre bulk and making it significantly easier for Absol to set up. Uxie is the best dual screens user in RU and has the raw bulk to set up Reflect, Light Screen, and Stealth Rock multiple times a match, supporting Absol exceptionally well.</p> "

  "Gorebyss": {
    "overview": "<p>Gorebyss is actually a pretty good Pokemon in RU; good Special Attack stat and decent bulk when coupled with Shell Smash, one of the best set up moves in the game is very threatening. Unfortunately it is almost completely outclassed by Omastar, a Pokemon with higher Special Attack, Speed, and bulk. The reduced Speed is especially significant, because even at +2, Gorebyss is outsped by Choice Scarf Rotom-C by one point. Gorebyss does have a few tricks up its sleeve to give it a slight niche over Omastar as a Shell Smash sweeper, including its sole Water-typing, which allows it to set up on certain Pokemon that Omastar cannot, and a wider movepool that give it some good coverage options. It is, however, very important to consider if Gorebyss is actually the right fit for your team, as more often than not you should just use Omastar.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Gorebyss actually has a pretty wide movepool, which includes access to Baton Pass. Unfortunately for Gorebyss, Shell Smash and Baton Pass are illegal in Rarelyused, so it is limited to passing other moves. Gorebyss could be used on a Baton Pass team, as it has the ability to pass Agility, Amnesia, and Iron Defense, but these teams generally aren't very successful in RU. An offensive Rain Dance set could be used to take advantage of Swift Swim, but Shell Smash is superior, giving the same boost to Speed, more power, and no turn limit. A defensive Rain Dance set could be used in conjunction with Hydration and Rest, but due to Gorebyss being a Water-type, it tends to have really poor synergy with the sweepers it is setting up rain for.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>It is far easier to prevent Gorebyss from setting up than it is to counter Gorebyss after it uses Shell Smash. Make sure you don't let Gorebyss in on any resisted Choice-locked move, as that will probably be devastating for your team. Ferroseed with Seed Bomb is probably your best response to a Gorebyss that has set up, as it can take any of its moves once and OHKO in return with Seed Bomb. Lanturn is in a similar position, being able to take any hit once and OHKO with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Another good option for preventing Gorebyss from sweeping your team is to revenge kill it. Accelgor, Jolly Choice Scarf Medicham, Choice Scarf Rotom, Choice Scarf Rotom-C, and Choice Scarf Manectric can all revenge kill Gorebyss after it has used Shell Smash, but you must first sacrifice something against Gorebyss to get them in.</p> ",

        "name": "Shell Smash",
        "description": "<p>Shell Smash is the only reason there is to consider using Gorebyss, and this set gives it a small niche in RU. Modest Life Orb Gorebyss hits extremely hard after a boost, so Surf is chosen as the main STAB, but Hydro Pump can be used in the last slot if you want more power, as it guarantees the OHKO on Cryogonal after Stealth Rock and has a chance to OHKO without it. Shadow Ball is the one thing that distinguishes Gorebyss from Omastar, as it allows Gorebyss to OHKO Slowking after Stealth Rock 93.75% of the time. Ice Beam is the best option in the last slot, and allows Gorebyss to get around Amoonguss, Druddigon, and Roselia.</p> <p>At +2 with a neutral nature, Gorebyss is able to outspeed every unboosted threat in the tier barring Accelgor. However, with a Timid nature, Gorebyss can outspeed Choice Scarf Rotom-C if it carries Hidden Power Fire, but that isn't all that common. Modest Gorebyss is also necessary for the high chance to OHKO Slowking after Stealth Rock, and makes an OHKO on Cryogonal after Stealth Rock much more likely. Life Orb is chosen as the item for this set, as Gorebyss needs the extra power to secure a lot of OHKOs, but Lum Berry is a great alternative, making setting up on status-spreading walls, such as Uxie, easier. Signal Beam and Substitute can be run together over Shadow Ball and Ice Beam, as Water + Bug has great neutral coverage, and Substitute lets Gorebyss get around Sucker Punch Absol and set up on Qwilfish, Cryogonal, and Ferroseed if it lacks Seed Bomb. However, Signal Beam's low Base Power means a lower chance to OHKO Slowking, and without Ice Beam, Gorebyss is walled by the likes of Amoonguss and Roselia, which can shake off any of Gorebyss's other moves. Swift Swim is the chosen ability on this set, giving your team some extra insurance against rain teams.</p> <p>Gorebyss really appreciates teammates that draw in moves it can set up on. Escavalier is a great choice for a partner, as it draws in Fire-type moves from opposing Emboar and Entei while having the bulk and power to take on many of the Pokemon that could revenge kill Gorebyss. Because Gorebyss is lowering its defenses, it also appreciates dual screens support, which aids in setup and prevents weaker priority from doing to much damage to Gorebyss. Uxie makes for a great partner, as it has access to both Reflect and Light Screen as well as U-turn or Memento to help get Gorebyss on the field.</p> "

  "Relicanth": {
    "overview": "<p>At first glance, Relicanth looks like an inferior version of Kabutops or Omastar. However, Relicanth has a few niches, mainly its access to Rock Head. With Rock Head, Relicanth can abuse STAB Head Smash to great effect, punching holes in just about any Pokemon. It also isn't that bad defensively either; 100 / 130 / 65 defenses aren't half-bad for a Rock-type Pokemon.</p> <p>However, Relicanth is in the NU tier for a reason: base 90 Attack is disappointingly average for a Pokemon with such a potent attack. To make matters worse, it doesn't have a single move in its arsenal with which to boost its Attack. Relicanth is also slow, base 55 Speed means that faster Pokemon can easily attack Relicanth before it can retaliate, though Rock Polish fixes this to an extent. Furthermore, Relicanth has a limited movepool, making it fairly predictable, and a poor typing, which grants it weaknesses to common types in the RU metagame, such as Electric, Fighting, and Grass. However, don't underestimate this bony fish--it has just enough power to rip through unprepared teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Relicanth has a few other options it can utilize. A RestTalk set can be viable, but is generally better left to bulkier Pokemon, such as Regirock. Amnesia could work on a defensive set, but Relicanth has better things to do than to try and set up Amnesia. Speaking of a defensive set, a support set with some combination of Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Yawn can work. However, Kabutops and Omastar do it better thanks to higher Attack and Special Attack, respectively, which means that they can deal more damage even with little investment.</p> <p>Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall, but it is less accurate, and Waterfall's flinch chance is useful. Substitute shields Relicanth from status, and can possibly give Relicanth an extra attack; however, this takes prediction to pull off correctly. Finally, Bounce forces switches, as well as potentially spreading paralysis, but its charge turn makes it very easy to switch into.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Relicanth may have a great combo with Head Smash and Rock Head, but it takes more than that to be a top-tier threat. There are two Pokemon that give Relicanth headaches: Poliwrath and Quagsire. The former resists Head Smash and has Water Absorb to absorb Waterfall, making it an excellent counter. To make matters worse for Relicanth, Poliwrath has STAB Fighting-type attacks to put a dent in it. However, Poliwrath must be careful when switching into the Choice Band set, as a well-timed Zen Headbutt will hurt. Quagsire makes another great Relicanth counter, especially ones with Water Absorb, as it can absorb Waterfall and resists Head Smash. Even Unaware Quagsire does well against Relicanth, though a rain-boosted Waterfall will deal a bit of damage. However, it has Recover to heal off any damage, and thanks to its Ground-type STAB, Quagsire can dispose of Relicanth easily.</p> <p>Bulky Grass-type Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Torterra, do a great job of taking Head Smash, though Torterra will not enjoy taking a Choice Band-boosted Waterfall. Ferroseed can also take any attack as it is resistant to both of Relicanth's STABs, though it can't do much in return unless it has Seed Bomb, and without reliable recovery, repeated Head Smashes will hurt. Bulky Fighting-type Pokemon, such as Hariyama, make good checks in general as they can take a Head Smash and retaliate with their STABs, but they must be wary of switching in on Choice Band Zen Headbutt.</p> <p>Faster Grass-type Pokemon, such as Lilligant and Leafeon, can OHKO Relicanth with their Grass-type STAB attacks before it can attack. However, they must be careful switching in, as Head Smash will hurt. In general, faster special attackers, such as Galvantula and Rotom-C, can beat Relicanth, as they target Relicanth's lower Special Defense. Finally, as Relicanth will most commonly be firing off Choice Band Head Smash, most Pokemon that can take one are safe checks, but note that the right coverage attack will do some damage.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>What better use for a Pokemon that can't boost its Attack than a Choice Band set? Instead of wasting time setting up, Relicanth aims to break skulls with its STAB Head Smash, which is especially good without the recoil thanks to Rock Head. This Relicanth has flawless neutral coverage--it hits every Pokemon in the RU metagame for at least neutral damage. STAB Waterfall has great coverage with Head Smash, as it hits Pokemon that resist Head Smash, such as Steelix, for massive damage. Earthquake nails Magneton, Aggron, and Klinklang, which also resist Head Smash. The last moveslot is a flexible one. Zen Headbutt allows Relicanth to hit Poliwrath, who resists both of Relicanth's STABs, for super effective damage; it also hits all the various Fighting-types in the RU tier besides Gallade and Medicham for super effective damage. On the other hand, Double-Edge hits Quagsire harder, which is just as crucial as Quagsire easily sponges Relicanth's other attacks. Double-Edge also has the benefit of no recoil thanks to Rock Head, so it's a viable alternative over Zen Headbutt.</p> <p>Adamant is the main nature as it gives Relicanth more power. Despite Relicanth's poor base 55 Speed, maximum Speed is used to outspeed Uxie and Qwilfish. A Jolly nature can be used to outspeed Altaria, which makes it a strong alternative. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def can be used for more bulk, which is useful alongside Relicanth's 100 / 130 / 65 defenses. However, Relicanth generally likes to outspeed common RU tanks, particularly Uxie, as Relicanth can deal massive damage with Head Smash, and thanks to Relicanth's weaknesses, it won't get much use of a bulkier spread anyways. To showcase Relicanth's power, the damage calculations below pit an Adamant Relicanth against common RU Pokemon:</p> <ul> <li>Head Smash vs. 252/252+ Uxie 48.3% - 57.1% <li>Head Smash vs. 252/252+ Tangrowth 43.8% - 51.5%</li> <li>Waterfall vs. 252/0 Steelix 47.5% - 55.9%</li> <li>Earthquake vs. 252/4 Poliwrath 34.4% - 40.6%</li> <li>Zen Headbutt vs. 252/4 Poliwrath 55.2% - 65.1%</li> <li>Zen Headbutt vs. 4/0 Hitmonlee 139.7% - 164.5%</li> <li>Zen Headbutt vs. 12/252+ Hariyama 46.8% - 55.1%</li> <li>Double-Edge vs. 252/252+ Quagsire 31% - 36.5%</li> </ul> <p>Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall for more power, though it does not gain any important KOs, making the drop in accuracy undesirable. Waterfall also has the chance to flinch the opponent, making its value worth much more than Aqua Tail. Sleep Talk can be used over Zen Headbutt or Double-Edge to make Relicanth a useful sleep absorber, though the loss of a coverage move generally isn't worth it. Also, most Pokemon that use sleep inducing moves are Grass-types, meaning that they would most likely OHKO Relicanth with STAB Grass-type attacks. Stone Edge or Rock Slide can be used in the last slot as well, as they give Relicanth a Rock-type attack if Head Smash should run out of PP, though both attacks are weaker, making the loss of a coverage move not worth it.</p> <p>As Relicanth tries to deal as much damage as possible, teammates that can set up entry hazards are really appreciated. Roselia is a prime example, as it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, as well as having key resistances to Grass-, Electric-, and Fighting-type attacks, while Relicanth has resistances to Fire- and Flying-type attacks. Leafeon has excellent defensive and offensive synergy with Relicanth as well, and it can Baton Pass a Swords Dance boost, making Relicanth a force to be reckoned with. Rotom-C makes another great partner, as it is resistant to Grass, 4x resistant to Electric-type attacks, and has a key immunity to Ground-type attacks. Rotom-C can also get rid of Quagsire and Poliwrath, Relicanth's key counters.</p> "

        "name": "Rock Polish",
        "description": "<p>While the Choice Band set focuses on Relicanth's power to break through walls, the Rock Polish set has the aim of sweeping the opponent once Relicanth sets up. This is made easier thanks to Relicanth's great excellent defenses, which mean that defensive Pokemon such as Uxie and Mandibuzz often cannot hurt it much. If it can get a safe switch into a Pokemon it forces out, it can set up and begin sweeping. STAB Head Smash is still the main attack on the set, as it wrecks any Pokemon that doesn't resist it. Head Smash and Waterfall make for a great combo, as few Pokemon resist both attacks. Earthquake lets Relicanth quickly dispatch of Pokemon such as Klinklang and Magneton.</p> <p>With a Jolly nature, Relicanth hits 458 Speed, enabling it to outpace +1 positive-natured base 86s and below after a Rock Polish, which includes common Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-C, Magmortar, and Medicham. An Adamant nature, however, guarantees more power, as well as the ability to outspeed positive-natured base 140 Speed Pokemon after a Rock Polish. However, losing out on outspeeding key Pokemon, especially Choice Scarf Rotom-C, might not be worth it. An alternative EV spread of 108 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Relicanth to outspeed positive-natured base 115s, as well as all +1 base 60s after a Rock Polish.</p> <p>Since this Relicanth forgoes the power gained from using a Choice Band, teammates that can set up entry hazards are greatly appreciated. Roselia, again, makes a great teammate, as it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and also has excellent defensive synergy with Relicanth. Ferroseed also partners well with Relicanth, as it can set up both Spikes and Stealth Rock, as well as use Thunder Wave to cripple faster Pokemon that still outspeed Relicanth after a Rock Polish, such as Galvantula. For more offensive partners, Leafeon has excellent defensive and offensive synergy with Relicanth, and it can Baton Pass Relicanth a Swords Dance boost for total and utter devastation. Leafeon also draws out Bug- and Fire-type Pokemon, which gives Relicanth plenty of time to set up a Rock Polish. Rotom-C makes another great partner, as it is resistant to Grass, 4x resistant to Electric, and immune to Ground. Rotom-C can also get rid of Quagsire and Poliwrath, Relicanth's key counters, easing Relicanth's sweeping chances.</p> "

        "name": "Swift Swim Sweeper",
        "description": "<p>This set rose to fame back in the DPP era, and in a tier with Pokemon such as Ludicolo, Qwilfish, and Omastar, it can shine in the BW era as well. By utilizing Relicanth's lesser-used ability, Swift Swim, it aims to use the rain to hit the opponent as powerfully and as speedily as possible. Despite Rock Head no longer being Relicanth's ability of choice, Head Smash still remains the main attack on the set, as its sheer power alone makes it a difficult move to switch into. The combination of Waterfall and Head Smash nails just about every Pokemon in the RU tier--only three Pokemon resist Relicanth's STABs, namely Ferroseed, Poliwrath, and Quagsire. Waterfall is especially dangerous in rain, as it now has the power to take down even more Pokemon. Earthquake is used to pick off Steel-type Pokemon such as Magneton.</p> <p>Finally, the last moveslot depends on personal preference. Rain Dance enables Relicanth to try and sweep with its own rain, and Relicanth's Waterfall becomes even more powerful. However, if Relicanth's teammates can set up the rain for it, Stone Edge is a viable alternative for a STAB attack that doesn't cause recoil damage, which is crucial when one takes into consideration Life Orb and Head Smash recoil.</p> <p>A Jolly nature ensures that Relicanth can outpace +1 positive-natured base 86s in the rain, which include Rotom-A, who gives Relicanth the most problems. However, if one is unconcerned with outspeeding Rotom-A, an Adamant nature guarantees more power, and Relicanth still has enough Speed to outspeed positive-natured base 140 Speed Pokemon in the rain, as well as base 60 Speed Choice Scarf users, so the power isn't wasted. An alternative EV spread of 108 HP / 252 Atk / 144 Spe with an Adamant nature allows Relicanth to outspeed all base 115 Speed Pokemon, as well as all base 60 Speed Choice Scarf users in the rain, while giving it some additional bulk; however, maxing out its Speed usually works best.</p> <p>Relicanth, as with most other sweepers, loves entry hazard support. As with all Relicanth, Roselia makes a great teammate, as it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and thanks to rain, Roselia can take Fire-type attacks much more easily. Ferroseed also makes a great partner; as it can set up both Spikes and Stealth Rock, as well as use Thunder Wave to cripple the likes of Galvantula, who still outspeeds Relicanth in the rain. Ferroseed also benefits from the rain reducing its Fire-type weakness. Other rain abusers, such as Ludicolo, Omastar, and Kabutops, also make great partners, as they can overwhelm the opponent's rain checks. Rotom-C makes another great partner, as it can both set up rain and abuse it with Thunder, and also has the typing to deal with common Relicanth checks Poliwrath and Quagsire.</p> "

  "Rampardos": {
    "overview": "<p>Rampardos is primarily seen as a wallbreaker in the RU tier, and accomplishes this with two main sets: one is that of a Choice Band wallbreaker and another is that of a mixed core-breaker that can lure in its checks and counters and defeat them with the appropriate coverage move. Thus, between its colossal Attack stat and surprisingly generous special movepool, Rampardos is a truly great weapon against stall. However, it is let down by its poor Speed stat, which, along with its horrible defensive typing and quite average bulk, means that it won't be sticking around for long. It also faces competition from Aggron as a Rock-type with access to Head Smash, and unlike Rampardos, Aggron does not have to take massive amounts of recoil thanks to its Rock Head ability, meaning that Rampardos is often passed over in favor of it. Nevertheless, Rampardos separates itself from Aggron through its superior Attack and the ability to utilize its movepool well by going mixed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While a Choice Scarf set might seem perfect due to Rampardos's Speed, it is still very slow and can be outsped by Sceptile and Cinccino even when holding said item. It is also easily revenge killed and unlike its wallbreaking counterparts, struggles against defensively oriented teams. Rampardos can fit quite well on Trick Room teams, and is a good candidate for a wallbreaker on such teams with the appropriate IV and nature adjustments. Hidden Power Grass is an option on the mixed set to hit Quagsire while retaining coverage on Rhydon, but it cannot OHKO the latter (unlike a Sheer Force-boosted Focus Blast) and the former is quite rare. Stealth Rock can be utilized in an offensive lead set, but Rampardos is quite frail and not a very reliable entry hazard setter. Substitute + Focus Punch can be used, but Rampardos has a hard time setting up Substitutes and the moveslots required cut into its coverage. Outrage and Double-Edge are two seemingly appealing moves, but provide no coverage and are both usually a waste of a moveslot.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Countering Rampardos is almost impossible due to its great coverage, high Attack, and strong STAB moves. A very effective way of stopping it is to simply prevent it from switching in on a slower Pokemon, meaning that it will have to take a hit before attacking. Fighting-types, especially bulky ones such as Hariyama and Poliwrath, can stomach any hit from Rampardos and OHKO with a STAB move of choice, though the former has to watch out for a Zen Headbutt and the latter will be hit hard by Thunderbolt or Thunder Punch from the respective sets. Ground-types such as Torterra and Golurk work as well. Golurk warrants a special mention due to its ability to hard counter the Choice Band set and take one Ice Beam (unlike Torterra). However, checking Rampardos is quite easy for most teams. Ferroseed stands out as a good check due to its overall bulk, allowing it to take at least one coverage move and proceed to OHKO Rampardos. Alomomola can take a Head Smash from Rampardos, and although it is 2HKOed, Rampardos in turn takes massive recoil due to Alomomola's high HP stat. However, Alomomola is OHKOed by a Sheer Force-boosted Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>The best way to check Rampardos is to simply revenge kill it, due to the fact that it is quite slow and not exactly sturdy. Pokemon such as Rotom-C, faster variants of Gallade, and Sceptile can easily end Rampardos with their STAB moves. Almost any Pokemon faster than it with decent attacking prowess can OHKO it. Finally, users of priority such as Spiritomb, Absol, Kabutops, Gurdurr, and Hitmonlee can ruin Rampardos's fun very quickly indeed.</p> ",

        "name": "Mixed",
        "description": "<p>While Rampardos would normally be thought of as a one-dimensional wallbreaker, pummeling through the tier with its massive Attack, it also has the ability to go mixed due to access to Sheer Force and an expansive special movepool. The purpose of this set is to lure in Rampardos's checks and counters and destroy them with the appropriate coverage move. Head Smash is Rampardos's signature move for good reason; coming off base 165 Attack, it can OHKO relatively bulky threats such as Amoonguss and Slowking even with minimal investment. However, the massive recoil it takes means that Head Smash should only be used when you are not sure of a switch-in or where its coverage moves would otherwise not OHKO the target. When using Head Smash, Rampardos will usually not survive for long enough to KO more than one or two Pokemon on a given team. Rock Slide is an alternative option, and while it does not hit nearly as hard as Head Smash does, it comes with the benefit of negating Life Orb damage, does not make Rampardos take additional recoil, and hits quite hard when boosted by Sheer Force, although it misses out on the OHKOs mentioned earlier. Thunderbolt OHKOes Qwilfish, OHKOes Alomomola after Stealth Rock, and hits Poliwrath hard, letting Rampardos hit three important targets that would give it trouble; although Rampardos can 2HKO the former two with Head Smash, the recoil it would take makes this less than ideal. Focus Blast is yet another Sheer Force-boosted coverage move that lets Rampardos deal with important threats that would otherwise wall it: Steelix, Aggron, and Rhydon. Ice Beam is in the last slot as it lets Rampardos hit Druddigon and Torterra hard, as well as get an accurate hit on Rhydon. In addition, it forms a BoltBeam combo with Thunderbolt, granting near-flawless reliable coverage.</p> <p>The given EV spread lets Rampardos outspeed Adamant Torterra (which Rampardos can then proceed to destroy with Ice Beam), while Special Attack is maximized to let Rampardos hit hard with its coverage moves and guarantee the OHKO on Rhydon, Steelix, and Alomomola after Stealth Rock. The rest of the EVs go into Attack to power up its STAB move. Rash is suggested for the nature as a Speed- or Attack-boosting nature does not let Rampardos outspeed or KO anything significant, and the extra special power is helpful to net the previously mentioned OHKOs, and while Mild seems like a viable alternative, the extra Defense gained can prove to be handy against priority attacks. Zen Headbutt is an option to hit Fighting-types, which Rampardos despises, most notably Hariyama, but the moves on the set offer more coverage against more threats to Rampardos in general. While this set is able to rip through common stall cores, offense is a playstyle Rampardos struggles with a lot because of its horrible defensive typing, average bulk, and the fact that most offensive Pokemon outspeed it and can easily OHKO. As far as partners go, Uxie, Slowking, and Qwilfish make for good partners as they can provide paralysis support; some of these Pokemon help it in more than one way (Qwilfish provides Spikes support while Uxie can bring Rampardos in with U-turn). Swellow also makes for a good partner as it can clean through weakened teams while Rampardos can break through stall cores that give it trouble. In addition, it also provides a fast hitter, which makes up for Rampardos's poor Speed. Choice Scarf Rotom-C can outspeed and KO Pokemon such as Poliwrath that give this set trouble and appreciates Rampardos's ability to destroy more defensively-oriented Pokemon.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>While Rampardos's most effective set is that of a mixed wallbreaker, this set takes a more straightforward approach to said role, although with more prediction required. Head Smash is the main move on this set and hits most of the tier for good damage. Superpower is run in the second slot to hit Pokemon that would otherwise easily stomach a Head Smash, such as Steelix, Aggron, and Rhydon (and it OHKOes Aggron). Fire Punch gets the Sheer Force boost and OHKOes threats such as Ferroseed and Escavalier without the stat drops from Superpower in the former's case or taking the massive recoil from Head Smash in the latter's case. It also hits the previously mentioned Steelix hard, albeit a lot less hard than Superpower. In the last slot, Thunder Punch hits problematic Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Alomomola, and Qwilfish for good damage, 2HKOing all of them. Alternatively, Rock Slide is a reliable STAB move that is boosted by Sheer Force, is more accurate, and doesn't force Rampardos to take massive recoil.</p> <p>Sheer Force is the preferred ability as it gives Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, and Rock Slide a much-needed boost. Alternatively, Mold Breaker can be used to allow Rampardos to screw over Custap Berry Crustle leads. Stone Edge can be used as an alternative STAB, but Head Smash is generally better and Rock Slide with a Sheer Force boost hits about as hard. Ice Punch can be used on the set to hit Ground-types such as Golurk and Torterra harder, but Rampardos generally cannot spare a moveslot for it. This set especially loves having paralysis support due to its poor Speed; Uxie, Qwilfish, and Slowking make for excellent candidates to spread paralysis. Swellow and Accelgor make for a good cleaners that can wreck the opposing team after their checks are gone and clean up after Rampardos has done its job. Mesprit can cover up Rampardos's Fighting weakness and learns Healing Wish, which can heal Rampardos up to full health and get rid of pesky status. Magneton can trap and get rid of the Steel-types that Rampardos despises. Fast, powerful Pokemon such as Sceptile and Aerodactyl can form a potent offensive core with Rampardos and appreciate its ability to break through defensive Pokemon.</p> "

  "Mothim": {
    "overview": "<p>Honestly, Mothim is pretty generic as far as Bug / Flying types go. With pitiful defenses, good Special Attack, and mediocre Speed, like many of his Bug-type cousins, Mothim doesn't particularly stand out in any way. Furthermore, he isn't particularly good either due to his 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. Even with the gift of Quiver Dance this generation, Mothim still has issues differentiating himself from Butterfree and Masquerain, the former boasting higher Speed and Sleep Powder, while the latter has Baton Pass, Intimidate, and a wider movepool. Mothim is also much frailer than these two Bug-types, which makes setup opportunities harder to come by. Still, Mothim does have a few key traits which allow him to carve out a slight niche for himself. Mothim has Air Slash, while Butterfree does not, granting him a powerful secondary STAB move that has perfect neutral coverage with Tinted Lens and Bug Buzz. He also has the aforementioned Tinted Lens and a somewhat higher Speed stat to separate himself from Masquerain. On top of this, Mothim has a much higher Special Attack stat than his fellow Quiver Dancers, which allows him to hit harder immediately and easily obtain OHKOs and 2HKOs which the other two would struggle to get. In the end, though, the only reason you should be using Mothim is if you really want his power or wish to make a team around him; otherwise, it's usually more advantageous to just use Butterfree or Masquerain, as their access to Sleep Powder or Baton Pass generally make them much easier to fit onto a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mothim's movepool is also generic like his Bug-type cousins, and it doesn't really have much of interest that could be used. Still, thanks to Mothim's decent attacking stats, there are a few offensive options that can be very usable on him. Psychic, Hidden Power, and Giga Drain are basically the only other viable special attacks in Mothim's arsenal, and though they are decent options, Mothim really doesn't need any other special attacks due to the flawless neutral coverage granted by his STAB attacks and Tinted Lens. Furthermore, Giga Drain cannot be used with Tinted Lens. Similarly, Roost would be an okay choice to give Mothim some extra longevity, but it is also illegal with Tinted Lens, which means it should almost never be considered as Tinted Lens is one of Mothim's key advantages. Since Mothim has a respectable Attack stat, he could also use some physical moves as well. Despite his lack of a good physical movepool, Mothim still has just enough to scrape by with Acrobatics, U-turn, and Return, which hit reasonably hard and have enough coverage together thanks to Tinted Lens. Swarm is Mothim's regular ability, but unless you want to use one of the moves which cannot be used alongside Tinted Lens, it is usually an inferior option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Like every other Bug / Flying type in existence, Stealth Rock utterly decimates Mothim, and keeping it up should be the first step in preventing Mothim from sweeping. Using a Stealth Rock user alongside a bulky spinblocker such as Spiritomb will usually ensure that they will stay up for the match, which will, in turn, severely cripple Mothim. It's also important to note that Mothim isn't outstandingly powerful either, so bulky special walls such as Cryogonal, Mandibuzz, and Clefable will easily handle him. Alternatively, if you are using offense, know that Mothim actually isn't that fast, and he is still somewhat easy to revenge after a Quiver Dance. For example, Aerodactyl, Accelgor, and Swellow can still outspeed him and easily hit him with a powerful super effective move to KO him, while Pokemon with a Choice Scarf, such as Rotom or Primeape, can make short work of him as well. Be wary of switching these Pokemon into Mothim directly though, since his Tinted Lens boosted attacks will wear them down if you switch them in too haphazardly. Additionally, Mothim is incredibly frail, so priority attacks from the likes of Entei, Feraligatr, and Kabutops will take him down. Overall, just keep some pressure on Mothim to prevent him from setting up, as without a Quiver Dance, Mothim isn't really that powerful. Just remember to use Pokemon who have massive Special Defense stats, not just ones who resist his STAB moves, to sponge his attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>Though Mothim's access to Quiver Dance gives him a means to sweep, Tinted Lens provides him with essentially perfect neutral coverage, meaning that an all-out attacking set such as this one becomes perfectly viable. Like Choice Specs Yanmega in UU, the premise of this set is incredibly simple: bring this guy in safely on a slow Grass-type such as Tangrowth or on a predicted Earthquake, then proceed to use one of his STAB moves and watch in glee as the opponent's switch-in is utterly demolished by the strength of his Tinted Lens-boosted STAB moves. Despite only having a base 94 Special Attack stat, between Tinted Lens, Choice Specs, and a Special Attack-boosting nature, Mothim actually becomes such an incredible offensive threat that almost every single Pokemon in RU is at least 2HKOed by his STAB moves, barring the bulkiest of special walls such as specially defensive Magneton and Clefable. Alongside the fact that the Bug-type is an incredibly powerful offensive typing in RU, this makes Mothim an incredibly anti-metagame wallbreaker that is fully capable of smashing most of the common cores that many teams rely on.</p> <p>Bug Buzz is Mothim's premier offensive attack, and it's not hard to see why. After all, it's by far Mothim's most powerful attack, and between Tinted Lens and the sheer strength of Bug-type attacks in RU, the opponent usually won't have a Pokemon that actually resists it. However, if opponents do have a Pokemon that resists Bug Buzz on their teams, such as Emboar or Moltres, Air Slash gives Mothim the coverage he needs to hit such threats hard, and once again, thanks to Tinted Lens, the opponent probably won't have a Pokemon that resists it. In tandem with Tinted Lens, Bug Buzz and Air Slash actually give Mothim perfect neutral coverage. Therefore, the last two moves that Mothim uses don't really need to provide coverage at all; they are meant to give Mothim a means of dealing with certain troublesome flaws that he has. For example, U-turn gives Mothim a way to circumvent being walled by special walls such as specially defensive Magneton and Clefable. Instead of just using Bug Buzz against these walls and being forced out, Mothim can instead use U-turn to deal a sizable chunk of damage due to his passable base 94 Attack stat; Mothim can then switch into something that is capable of dealing with them, such as Emboar. In a similar vein, Giga Drain is recommended in the last slot to slightly offset Mothim's huge weakness to Stealth Rock by recovering his lost HP while dealing big damage to Lanturn and Rhydon. However, options such as Hidden Power Rock, which OHKOes Moltres without the need of Stealth Rock support, are also decent.</p> <p>A Mild or Rash nature is used to make Mothim hit as hard as possible and maximize his chances of landing 2HKOs on certain Pokemon, such as Lanturn. Maximum Speed investment conveniently places Mothim at an incredibly nice Speed stat of 231, which lets him outspeed base 55 Speed Pokemon with maximum investment and a Speed-boosting nature, such as Bouffalant and Omastar, in addition to the Pokemon that might attempt to run just enough Speed to outspeed such Pokemon, such as Uxie. Thanks to this magical Speed tier, a Hasty or Naive nature is generally unnecessary, but it does allow Mothim to outspeed max Speed Emboar and Cryogonal without Speed investment.</p> <p>Even though Mothim is so incredibly powerful under the right circumstances, he requires quite a bit of support to perform at his best due to his multiple shortcomings, such as his weakness to Stealth Rock, ridiculous frailty, lack of great resistances, and relatively low Speed, which all hamper his ability to come into a match and 2HKO everything on the opponent's team. Fortunately, in RU, the first flaw is an easy one to fix: simply slapping a Pokemon with Rapid Spin, such as Kabutops or Cryogonal, on your team gives you a way to remove Stealth Rock, and due to just how good those two spinners are, removing that hazard shouldn't be a problem at all. Kabutops is particularly good due to his ability to tank the Fire Blasts and Flare Blitzes that Pokemon such as Moltres and Emboar might try to fire at Mothim. The other flaws are more difficult to alleviate, but they are still manageable. Perhaps the best way to get into the match is to use Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch, such as Uxie and Rotom-C, that can take an attack or force the opponent out, and then bring in Mothim without taking damage. Rotom-C is also especially for this purpose, as it tends to lure in the Grass-types that Mothim threatens and bring him in on them, which would put the opponent at a significant disadvantage.</p> "

        "name": "Quiver Dance",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Quiver Dance, Mothim can actually be a very threatening sweeper, as the combination of his great Special Attack, usable Speed, and Tinted Lens allow him to dish out some serious damage. Because of Tinted Lens, Mothim actually has perfect neutral coverage with just his STAB moves, which makes him incredibly difficult to wall. Mothim's amazing coverage also separates him from Lilligant, who is forced to utilize a mediocre Hidden Power type for coverage, and, no matter what type she chooses, she is still going to be walled by certain Pokemon. After a Quiver Dance, Mothim is extremely powerful and respectably fast, outspeeding everything up to maximum Speed Swellow, making him hard to revenge kill, and he can 2HKO most Pokemon bar bulky special walls. Though he needs support to deal with those troublesome Pokemon, once they have been removed, Mothim will easily rip through the opposing team.</p> <p>Because Bug Buzz and Air Slash work so well together, Substitute is recommended in the last slot in order to protect Mothim from troublesome status attacks, ease prediction and allow Mothim to do some big damage, without having to use Quiver Dance first. Substitute allows him to scout what the opponent switches in, and allows him to choose between Quiver Dance, Air Slash, and Bug Buzz depending on the Pokemon the opponent switched in. For example, if they switch in something that Mothim can outspeed and KO after a Quiver Dance, you should use Quiver Dance as it breaks Mothim's Substitute and proceed to KO it. If, however, they switch in something like Entei, who would be troublesome, Substitute allows you to attack the troublesome Pokemon with a Tinted Lens boosted attack as they break Mothim's Substitute, and then switch out. This can sometimes allow Mothim to wear down the opposition by himself. However, if you feel that Mothim would best be used as a late game sweeper, feel free to use Hidden Power Ground to nail foes like Magneton and Probopass for some nice damage.</p> <p>With the given EVs, Mothim outspeeds everything up to maximum Speed Swellow, while hitting as hard as possible. A Modest nature is a possible alternative if you wish to have a huge amount of power on your hands, but Mothim usually needs the Speed from a Timid nature since he will fail to outspeed many prominent threats, such as Archeops, Scolipede, and Sceptile. However, a Modest nature makes Mothim incredibly powerful and ensures that Mothim will 2HKO certain Pokemon. For example, with a Modest nature and a Life Orb, he 2HKOes specially defensive Flareon with Hidden Power Ground. In terms of alternate coverage moves, Hidden Power Rock can be used instead of Hidden Power Ground if Moltres ends up being a huge threat to your team, as Mothim's +1 Air Slash cannot OHKO without Stealth Rock. If Substitute is used, Leftovers are the recommended item, as with a Life Orb, Mothim will faint far too quickly, but if a coverage move is used instead in the last slot, Life Orb becomes the superior option to allow Mothim to dish out as much damage as possible before fainting.</p> <p>Rapid Spin support is a necessity when using Mothim, as the 50% he loses from Stealth Rock can decide whether or not he will be able to successfully sweep. Cryogonal, Hitmonchan, and Kabutops are wonderful choices, as the former two are very reliable at spinning away hazards, while the latter can also set up Stealth Rock to aid Mothim's sweep. The other entry hazards in Spikes and Toxic Spikes are also great in aiding Mothim, and these can be provided by the likes of Omastar and Roselia. However, even with full entry hazard support, Mothim cannot muscle past special walls such as Clefable and Cryogonal, so using a powerful physical attacker such as Entei, Medicham, Aggron, or the aforementioned Hitmonchan is recommended to remove these troublesome walls and allow Mothim to sweep.</p> "

  "Floatzel": {
    "overview": "<p>What makes Floatzel so special is its amazing Speed stat, which allows it to set up, attack, or cripple an opponent before they have a chance to do anything. Swift Swim is a great, but unnecessary, ability, though Floatzel becomes the fastest Pokemon in the tier when it's raining. In addition to its decent offensive movepool, Floatzel has access to some interesting support options: Taunt cripples an opponent that attempts to set up, Baton Pass can be used alongside Agility and Bulk Up, and Switcheroo can give a useless Choice item to a wall. Floatzel's type coverage is also pretty good with Water-, Dark-, Ice-, and Fighting-type moves, and it can take advantage of a decent Special Attack stat with Hidden Power and Ice Beam. Unfortunately, Floatzel is pretty frail without a Bulk Up boost, and its attacking stats aren't too impressive compared to other Pokemon in the tier, either. Nonetheless, Floatzel is a potent threat in RU, and it shouldn't be taken lightly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Besides the moves already listed, Floatzel can take advantage of a few more moves. Pursuit can catch a fleeing Ghost- or Psychic-type on the switch, though due to the lack of STAB and its measly 40 Base Power, it won't be dealing a lot of damage. Scald is an alternative STAB option with a nifty 30% burn rate, though it's outclassed by Surf for the most part, and it's better left to defensive Pokemon, such as Lanturn. Focus Blast has a higher Base Power than Brick Break, and it hits physical walls harder. Me First is very gimmicky, though it can catch a Ghost- or Dragon-type off-guard, potentially KOing them with their own move. Quick Attack is another priority move, but Aqua Jet is superior in every way. Roar can be used to rack up entry hazard damage, though Floatzel is usually too frail to use it. Finally, Substitute can be used to block status moves, it can be passed to a teammate, and it can also help ease prediction.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Most Water- and Grass-types can take on Floatzel, but they need to watch out for Hidden Power Grass and Ice Beam, respectively. Ferroseed can set up entry hazards and cripple Floatzel with Thunder Wave, provided the latter doesn't carry Taunt. Tangrowth can defeat any set which lacks Ice Beam, Rotom-C can switch into Water-type moves and KO Floatzel with Volt Switch, and Ludicolo is only hit neutrally by Ice-, Water-, and Grass-type moves, KOing Floatzel back with its STAB moves. Omastar doesn't take a lot of damage from anything bar Hidden Power Grass, and it has enough power to KO Floatzel with its own Hidden Power Grass. Poliwrath can switch into Water-, Ice-, and Dark-type moves with ease, and proceed with Substitute and Focus Punch. Dusknoir, Slowking, and Uxie are bulky enough to survive a hit or two, but they must watch out for Taunt, and repeated hits from Crunch will wear them down as well. If all else fails, try and KO Floatzel with priority moves, as its defenses are pretty low.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set is designed to wipe out Floatzel's number one nemesis: Tangrowth. With Ice Beam, Floatzel can take on Dragon-, Grass-, and Flying-types, and it will always OHKO enemy Tangrowth. This set is outclassed by Omastar and Gorebyss as a whole, but Floatzel has higher Speed and only has two weaknesses, while Omastar has four. Waterfall provides reliable physical STAB, and it deals a lot of damage when the weather is rainy. Brick Break hits Steel-types, and Crunch can be used to hit Ghost-types super effectively--note that Waterfall will deal more damage to Ghost-types in the rain. Rain Dance speaks for itself, and Hidden Power Grass can OHKO Omastar and Quagsire. While this set lacks the raw power of other sweepers in the tier, Floatzel's surprise value and unpredictability make it effective.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are fairly specialized: the Speed EVs enable Floatzel to outrun Timid Rotom outside of rain, maximum Special Attack EVs are used to raise Floatzel's lower attacking stat, and the remaining EVs are placed in Attack, giving Waterfall and Brick Break more power. Surf can be used in the last slot to deal more damage to Sandslash, Steelix, and Pokemon with lower Special Defense, and it's surprisingly powerful in the rain. Taunt is another option to shut down walls such as Clefable, but it isn't great on an offensive set.</p> <p>Support from entry hazards is helpful, as they make it easier to weaken and KO threatening Pokemon--not to mention they work great with Floatzel's ability to force switches. Ferroseed can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, and it can also switch into Grass- and Electric-type moves aimed at Floatzel. Sandslash is another good choice, as it sports a useful Electric-type immunity and can support its teammates with Rapid Spin.</p> <p>If you choose Hidden Power Grass in the last slot, it's recommended that you partner Floatzel with a teammate that can set up Rain Dance. Defensive Pokemon, such as Uxie, are great choices as they are difficult to KO, and therefore can set up rain multiple times. Furthermore, if you decide to use Rain Dance in the last slot, Water-types completely wall this set. Using a Grass- or Electric-type, such as Lilligant, Sceptile, or Galvantula, is recommended to power your way through opposing Water-types; in addition, they can switch into one or more of Floatzel's weaknesses. Alternatively, Clefable can take on most Grass- and Water-types, as the majority of them are special attackers.</p> <p>Due to Floatzel's frailty, most priority moves will severely weaken it. A wall such as Uxie can switch into most common priority moves, and it doesn't have to fear Sucker Punch either, as it can cripple physical attackers with Thunder Wave or Yawn. Aggron is another decent choice, as it can switch into Extreme Speed, and takes a pittance from Sucker Punch. Ground-types also make good teammates, especially since Choice Scarf Rotom and Timid Galvantula are pretty common.</p> "

The idea is to switch into a weak or resisted move, then proceed with Switcheroo or an attacking move to cripple or deal huge damage to the opponent, respectively. Waterfall is used for reliable STAB, and it receives a helpful power boost in the rain. Return provides excellent neutral coverage alongside Waterfall, but Ice Beam will OHKO Tangrowth, Floatzel's biggest enemy. Crunch is mainly a filler, though it allows Floatzel to hit Water-types should it use Ice Beam in the second slot, and it deals more damage to the likes of Slowking and Uxie outside of rain. Switcheroo is the main reason to use Floatzel over Feraligatr, as it allows Floatzel to cripple a wall, such as Slowking, Uxie, or Crustle.</p> <p>Floatzel can utilize both of its abilities on this set, as both of them have their own merits. Swift Swim can be used alongside a Rain Dance partner, making Floatzel one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, while Water Veil blocks any attempt to burn Floatzel. Water Veil works excellently alongside Switcheroo as it completely shuts down Spiritomb, one of Floatzel's biggest counters. It also beats common Scald users, such as Slowking.</p> <p>Pokemon that can set up entry hazards are helpful, as they weaken the opponent into Floatzel's KO range. Ferroseed is an excellent choice, as it can switch into Floatzel's weaknesses, and has access to Spikes, Stealth Rock, Leech Seed, and Thunder Wave. Uxie is another good choice, as it can switch in easily thanks to its great defenses, and proceed with a combination of Stealth Rock, U-turn, and Thunder Wave. Scolipede can set up Toxic Spikes, which are helpful to cripple physical walls; however, be careful when using Toxic Spikes, as a Guts user may take advantage of them. As always, carry a spinblocker to keep these hazards on the field.</p> <p>A way to break through physical walls is helpful. Absol is a good example; Superpower hits Aggron 4x super effectively, Night Slash and Sucker Punch will dent Slowking and Uxie, and the occasional Psycho Cut will decimate Throh.</p> "

Bulk Up and Agility are used to aid Floatzel's teammates in sweeping--Bulk Up raises its Attack and Defense, which is good for physical sweepers, while Agility is helpful for slow, powerful sweepers, such as Bouffalant and Entei. Taunt will stop any phazer that attempts to erase Floatzel's stat boosts, and it stops any opponent that attempts to set up alongside Floatzel. Waterfall is mainly a filler, but it gives Floatzel something to do should it be the last Pokemon on your team.</p> <p>216 Speed EVs ensure Floatzel is fast enough to outrun base 110 Speed Pokemon such as Archeops. Maximum HP investment provides extra bulk, while the remaining EVs are placed in Defense. If you desire more power, the additional EVs can be placed in Attack, giving Waterfall more of a kick. Water Veil is the preferred ability, as a burned Floatzel will be drained of its health, and it won't survive long enough to pass its boosts. Swift Swim is usable, however, as it allows Floatzel to function on a Rain Dance team. Aqua Tail can be used over Waterfall if you prefer the extra power, but its lower accuracy may be an issue.</p> <p>Pokemon that can receive Floatzel's stat boosts are obvious choices for teammates. Aggron appreciates an Attack boost from Bulk Up, Sawsbuck and Bouffalant appreciate a Speed boost, and Gallade can take advantage of a Defense boost, giving it more opportunities to switch in. Tangrowth is a more obscure option, but it appreciates both Speed and Attack boosts, and it can switch into Floatzel's weaknesses. Finally, Floatzel can be used as part of a dedicated Baton Pass team--Mawile, Gorebyss, and Drifblim are all suitable teammates if you decide to go down that route.</p> "

Drifblim's Ghost / Flying typing gives it many useful resistances and immunities, but it also comes with a few drawbacks. The first is a weakness to Stealth Rock, which severely hinders Drifblim's spinblocking abilities. It is also weak to Pursuit, and with base 44 Defense, Drifblim will be hard-pressed to survive one. While Unburden cures Drifblim's low base 80 Speed, its mediocre offenses hinder its ability to sweep.

It can run a dedicated Baton Pass set to pass Substitute and boosts from Calm Mind or Stockpile. It can also run a more defensive set to become a sturdier spinblocker, and the Aftermath ability can let it rack up damage on spinners. Though rather gimmicky, Drifblim can play the role of a Flare Boost sweeper as well; when it is burned, its Special Attack will be increased by 1.5x. It has a niche as the only fully evolved Pokemon with the ability, but this is not a reliable strategy as it will be worn down too quickly by Stealth Rock and burn damage to sweep.</p> <p>Drifblim has a few other support options it can use. Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, or Thunder Wave can be used to cripple opposing Pokemon. Will-O-Wisp is helpful if Drifblim is the only spinblocker on your team, as it will help against Kabutops. Toxic helps to wear down opposing walls that give Drifblim trouble, such as Mandibuzz. Thunder Wave cripples sweepers that attempt to OHKO Drifblim, such as Omastar. Haze removes boosts from Pokemon such as Lilligant, while Memento sacrifices Drifblim to cripple an opposing attacker. Disable is an interesting move; due to Drifblim's many resistances and immunities, most Pokemon have only one move effective against it. Drifblim can try a SubDisable set, but it is inferior to every listed set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The best way to take down Drifblim is to keep Stealth Rock on the field; due to its Flying typing, Drifblim will take 25% damage upon switching in, and its lack of reliable recovery and its low defenses mean that it will not be able to take many hits after Stealth Rock damage. Drapion is perhaps the most solid counter to Drifblim, as it only takes neutral damage from any of Drifblim's moves and can either hit it with a super effective STAB Crunch or phaze it with Whirlwind. Magneton resists all of Drifblim's moves except for Hidden Power Fighting and can KO it with a super effective STAB Electric-type move. Absol will decimate Drifblim with Sucker Punch, but will take a massive amount of damage if it switches into Acrobatics. Finally, phazers render Drifblim useless, as it will lose its Unburden boost for the remainder of the match, and it cannot do much with its base 80 Speed; Mandibuzz is the best phazer to use against Drifblim, as it boasts good defenses in addition to Whirlwind.</p> ",

Acrobatics will OHKO Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, and Cryogonal, while Will-O-Wisp cripples other Rapid Spin users, such as Kabutops and Sandslash. After Unburden activates, Drifblim reaches 510 Speed, which allows it to outspeed all Choice Scarf Pokemon with base 105 Speed or less.

Finally, Shadow Ball allows Drifblim to hit physical walls and opposing Ghost-types, but Substitute can be used in order to avoid status.</p> <p>Drifblim's EVs give it as much Attack as possible, as well as enough Speed to outspeed Choice Scarf Manectric after the boost from Unburden; 168 Speed EVs are an option to outrun Choice Scarf Primeape after Unburden if Manectric is not a problem. The remaining EVs are put into HP to make Drifblim a bit bulkier overall.

Roselia and Rhydon are thus ideal partners, as not only can they set up all the hazards between them, but they also resist Electric-type attacks commonly aimed at Drifblim, as well as Rock-type attacks in Rhydon's case. A Pursuit user works well with Drifblim too by eliminating troublesome Ghost-types, such as Rotom. Rapid Spin support should also be considered, as the damage from Stealth Rock limits Drifblim's survivability. Hitmonchan is a great partner; it can not only remove Stealth Rock, but also take out Rock- and Steel-types that give this set problems. Aerodactyl, Aggron, and Klinklang can wall Drifblim but must be careful of Will-O-Wisp and Destiny Bond. Choice Scarf Galvantula outspeeds Drifblim even after the Unburden boost and can OHKO with a STAB Electric-type attack.

With good coverage to complement its high Speed, Drifblim will surely KO at least one Pokemon and can even pull off one more Rain Dance before it goes down.</p> <p>236 Speed EVs let Drifblim outrun Choice Scarf Manectric after Unburden activates. While standard, this is especially useful on a rain team, as Manectric is a huge threat to Water-types. 252 Special Attack EVs maximize the power of Drifblim's main attacking options, and the rest are put in Attack to boost the power of Acrobatics. A Naughty nature can be used instead of a Rash one to boost the power of Acrobatics, but Drifblim should generally capitalize on its higher Special Attack and powerful special moves.</p> <p>Sunny Day lets Drifblim support a sun team, but Thunder cannot be used. Drifblim can run Thunderbolt instead, but its significantly lower Base Power will hinder its ability to sweep. Shadow Ball is another alternative, but it is generally less useful as it does not provide good coverage. In the sun, Weather Ball becomes a Fire-type move, which can be useful in eliminating Steel-types. Good teammates in the sun include Charizard, Sawsbuck, and Victreebel, but note that Rapid Spin support will be almost mandatory.</p> <p>Naturally, Swift Swim Pokemon are ideal partners for Drifblim. Kabutops is particularly notable for its ability to Rapid Spin; it can even set up Stealth Rock, which will help Drifblim gain some KOs. Drifblim can also aid its Swift Swim friends by eliminating the Grass-types that stand in their way. However, note that most Swift Swim Pokemon are Water-types and therefore compound the team's weakness to Electric-type moves, so either Lanturn or a Ground-type teammate will be appreciated.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind is Drifblim's best setup option, and Drifblim can hit surprisingly hard after one boost due to its decent base 90 Special Attack. Shadow Ball is Drifblim's most powerful attack here, and only a few Pokemon, mainly Dark-types, resist it. Thunderbolt hits Mandibuzz, which would otherwise wall this set and phaze Drifblim with Whirlwind. However, Hidden Power Fighting lets Drifblim dent troublesome Steel-type Pokemon, such as Steelix and Klinklang. Rest is a surprisingly good recovery move for this set, as its Chesto Berry not only wakes Drifblim instantly but also activates Unburden. Substitute is an alternative over Rest to block status and possibly obtain a free Calm Mind boost. With a Sitrus Berry, Drifblim will recover the HP lost from Substitute while activating Unburden to become a fast special sweeper.</p> <p>The Speed EVs allow Drifblim to outspeed Choice Scarf Manectric after Unburden, but note that if Drifblim is using Hidden Power Fighting, it needs 240 Speed EVs. Drifblim's Special Attack is maximized so that it hits as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs are put into HP to make it a bit bulkier. As previously mentioned, Rest should be used with a Chesto Berry and Substitute with a Sitrus Berry. Another viable item is a Ghost Gem, which will both boost Shadow Ball's power on the first use and activate Unburden. Drifblim can use Hidden Power Fighting in the fourth moveslot for additional coverage. It will still work well with a Sitrus Berry, as Drifblim can survive a surprising amount of attacks after a Calm Mind, including Life Orb Moltres's Fire Blast.</p> <p>A bulky EV spread of 252 Def / 16 SpA / 240 Spe with a Modest nature lets Drifblim set up more easily and possibly even Baton Pass its boosts, but note that this EV spread leaves Drifblim extremely weak and unable to KO many threats. The likes of Magneton and Tangrowth are good recipients of the Calm Mind boosts, though. Magneton can remove troublesome Steel-types and offensive Tangrowth can eliminate Absol and Drapion.</p> <p>Drapion and Mandibuzz are Calm Mind Drifblim's worst enemies because they can shrug off Drifblim's attacks with ease and phaze it with Whirlwind, which removes all acquired boosts and Unburden's effect. Pokemon that can dispose of these two are good partners; Sandslash in particular can also set up Stealth Rock and spin for Drifblim. Another counter to this set is Cryogonal, as it boasts massive Special Defense stats and can Haze Drifblim. Dark-type Pokemon, such as Spiritomb and Absol, can take advantage of Drifblim's horrible Defense stat and use either Sucker Punch or Pursuit to take it down. Finally, Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Steelix will wall this set if Drifblim lacks Hidden Power Fighting. Magneton is therefore a great teammate as it removes these Steel-types while resisting all moves super effective against Drifblim.</p> "

  "Skuntank": {
    "overview": "<p>Skuntank is one of the most overlooked Pokemon in the RU tier. It possesses decent offenses, wielding base stats of 93 Attack and 71 Special Attack. It has access to a number of useful moves, such as Pursuit, Explosion, Fire Blast, and Taunt. Unlike many of the other Dark-types in the tier, it is only hit neutrally by Fighting-type moves, allowing it to trap nearly all of the common spinblockers in RU. Finally, Skuntank's typing allows it to absorb Toxic Spikes. However, all of these boons aren't quite enough to outweigh Skuntank's shortcomings. Being a significantly weaker attacker than many of the other Dark-types in RU significantly hurts Skuntank, as it's usually incapable of destroying as many teams as Pokemon such as Absol and Crawdaunt can. In addition, Drapion has the same resistances, along with an arguably better movepool and stats. Explosion's nerf this generation also was damaging to Skuntank, as one of its key moves was left almost unusable. However, despite these shortcomings, Skuntank is still quite an effective Pokemon, capable of handling a variety of common threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although it has a relatively sparse movepool, Skuntank has a few other options available to it. Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fighting can be a more reliable alternative over Fire Blast in terms of accuracy, but although they give more power against Aggron, the loss of power against other threats makes them less viable. Screech can be combined with Pursuit to force and take advantages of switches, but is hard to pull off effectively and is a gimmicky strategy at best. Thanks to Skuntank's decent physical movepool, Choice Band sets are somewhat viable, although Drapion can pull those off much more effectively. Skuntank also has access to Night Slash, but it is usually inferior to Crunch. Punishment hits stat boosters hard, but isn't very useful in most situations. Return is the final competitive option in Skuntank's movepool, but doesn't provide Skuntank with any helpful additional coverage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Bulky Steel-types are capable of countering Skuntank easily, as they resist every move it commonly carries, barring Fire Blast. Bulky Rock-types, such as Rhydon, are in a similar vein, even though they do not resist Dark-type attacks, as Skuntank can't really hurt them much. Many strong offensive Ground-types can do a lot of damage to Skuntank, due to their ability to hit it for super effective damage with Earthquake while avoiding Aftermath, as Earthquake is not a contact move. Drapion is an especially effective counter, as it resists almost all the attacks Skuntank commonly carries and can hit it hard with Earthquake. Most Ghost-types are capable of luring in Skuntank and hitting it with Will-O-Wisp on the switch-in, although they're not outright reliable counters. Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Qwilfish, and Alomomola, however, can outright wall Skuntank with ease.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With Pursuit and Taunt at its disposal, Skuntank is capable of beating nearly all of the Psychic- and Ghost-types in RU, which paves the way for a number of dangerous sweepers, and also allows most Rapid Spin users to spin freely. Pursuit is the main reason to use this set, as it prevents Pokemon such as Rotom and Uxie from freely switching out of Skuntank. Taunt works very well in conjunction with Pursuit, as it prevents Pokemon from hitting Skuntank with Will-O-Wisp, which would effectively kill Skuntank's usefulness. Sucker Punch is the best option available for Skuntank's third moveslot, as in addition to being one of the few moves that separates it from Drapion, it is incredibly useful in letting Skuntank beat some faster threats, such as Gardevoir and Rotom. Finally, either Crunch or Poison Jab can fit into Skuntank's fourth moveslot, both being useful for an outright STAB attack when Pursuit and Sucker Punch aren't effective.</p> <p>Max Attack with a positive nature allows Skuntank to hit hard as possible, while max Speed lets it outpace neutral base 80s. Explosion is an option in Skuntank's last moveslot, but due to its mechanics this generation, it's not very useful. Flamethrower and Fire Blast are viable options, as they let Skuntank beat down the many Steel-types that can wall it. However, since this set's main job is to eliminate Ghost- and Psychic-types, it should be paired with Fighting-types easily capable of breaking through Steel-types, so using a Fire-type attack is usually unnecessary. Finally, both Aftermath and Stench are usable with this set. Aftermath is the slightly more reliable option, damaging anything that KOs Skuntank with a contact move, while the occasional flinch that Stench provides can get Skuntank out of some scrapes.</p> <p>Skuntank pairs very well with Pokemon that enjoy having bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types removed. This means that most offensive Fighting-types make good partners for Skuntank, thanks to their ability to fire off high-powered STAB Fighting-type moves without fear of being walled by one of the many Ghost-types of RU. In addition, many Rapid Spin users, such as Cryogonal and Kabutops, also make good partners for Skuntank, as they gain the ability to spin freely with the removal of Ghost-types. Some other good partners are Pokemon that are hit hard by entry hazards, such as Moltres and Articuno, since spinners are able to remove entry hazards without fear of being blocked. Finally, Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate make good partners for Skuntank, as they are immune to Ground-type attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<p>Due to its useful offensive typing, along with its unique stat distribution and movepool, Skuntank can effectively use a moveset capable of breaking down stall teams and a number of common walls. Fire Blast is the most important move on this set, letting Skuntank break through a number of Pokemon that would otherwise wall it, such as Steelix, Ferroseed, and Tangrowth. Fire Blast is also one of the advantages that Skuntank has over Drapion, who can use a similar set but lacks the ability to easily break through bulky physical walls. Taunt protects Skuntank from Will-O-Wisp while also preventing the opponent from setting up against Skuntank easily. Sucker Punch lets Skuntank hit Pokemon that outspeed it, and is useful in conjunction with Taunt. Finally, either Poison Jab or Pursuit can be used in Skuntank's last moveslot. Poison Jab gives Skuntank decent neutral coverage and is more reliable than Sucker Punch, whereas Pursuit allows Skuntank to do more damage to stall cores by hitting fleeing Pokemon.</p> <p>Max Attack allows Skuntank to tear through Pokemon such as Slowking, Rotom, and Cryogonal with Sucker Punch and Pursuit, while 104 Special Attack EVs let Skuntank easily 2HKO Steelix, Ferroseed, and offensive Aggron. 152 Speed EVs are necessary in order for Skuntank to outspeed neutral-natured max Speed Magneton. Both Aftermath and Stench are viable abilities for Skuntank; Aftermath damages the opponent significantly if Skuntank is KOed by a contact move, whereas Stench gives all of Skuntank's offensive moves a 10% flinch chance, which can be extremely helpful in getting Skuntank out of some sticky situations. Skuntank also has a few other useful moves that can be used on this set. Explosion lets it deal the finishing blow on a number of walls that aren't hit hard enough by Sucker Punch, Poison Jab, or Pursuit, but is generally an inferior option due to its power drop compared to previous generations. Crunch is another usable move for this set, but is somewhat redundant with Sucker Punch.</p> <p>In terms of partners, anything that provides entry hazard support and force a lot of switches can pair nicely with Skuntank. Excellent options for setting up Stealth Rock include Uxie, Mesprit, and Golurk, while decent choices for Spikes and Toxic Spikes support include Omastar, Smeargle, and Crustle, all of whom pair nicely with Skuntank defensively as well. Pokemon that can spin away opposing entry hazards also partner well with Skuntank, due to its ability to trap and break down many common spinblockers. Good choices for spinners are Hitmonchan, Cryogonal, and Kabutops. For offensive partners, any Pokemon that has trouble breaking through full stall teams can be helpful, as Skuntank can easily weaken most stall cores. Offensive Fighting-types pair well with Skuntank too, since they have trouble breaking through the Ghost- and Psychic-types that Skuntank can easily defeat.</p> "

  "Spiritomb": {
    "overview": "<p>Spiritomb is one of only three fully evolved Pokemon in the game with no type weaknesses at all. Its typing gives it handy immunities to Normal-, Fighting-, and Psychic-type attacks, making it a potent spinblocker that can beat almost all of RU's prominent Rapid Spin users with the right set, including Hitmonchan, Kabutops, and Cryogonal. Furthermore, it is one of the only Pokemon that checks some of the most powerful threats in RU, namely Sigilyph, Gallade, and Slowking, and one of the best Pursuit trappers. Its decent mixed attacking stats let it go either physical or special, but they will almost always require a significant boost to be of much use. However, Spiritomb's lack of attacking options and reliable recovery are setbacks that can cause your team to lose momentum. All in all, Spiritomb is a great Pokemon in the RU tier, but not one that immediately threatens your opponent's team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Spiritomb has a couple of other setup moves in its movepool that it can make use of. Curse is a perfect move for Spiritomb's stat spread, but sadly, Spiritomb is a Ghost-type, meaning it will only lose half its health when it uses Curse. Nasty Plot could work, although the Calm Mind set outclasses it. Also, while Spiritomb has access to Taunt, it is too slow to make any use of it, although it could work well in tandem with Sucker Punch. Spiritomb also gets both Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but Uxie is a better team supporter with its access to Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, and U-turn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Mandibuzz is the best counter to Spiritomb. It takes almost nothing from both physical and special sets, can use Taunt to avoid status and Trick, and phazes Calm Mind boosts with Whirlwind. Steelix is another solid counter to Spiritomb, although it doesn't like burn or getting Tricked a Choice Band as much. However, it still resists every move in Spiritomb's arsenal and can use either Roar or Dragon Tail to phaze. Klinklang can avoid status through the use of Substitute, and can set up to +6 with little to fear. Aggron isn't hit hard at all by Spiritomb, and OHKOes even the defensive set after only a little residual damage. Hariyama simply wants to get burned to activate Guts, and can set up Bulk Up to prepare a sweep. Druddigon is bulky enough to take a couple of hits and hits hard with Outrage, OHKOing the defensive set with two layers of entry hazards. Entei can't be burned, has good bulk, and also OHKOes the defensive set with two layers of entry hazards. Poliwrath easily sets up on Spiritomb, and a Choice Band-boosted Shadow Sneak won't break its Substitute after just one Bulk Up. Finally, Magneton is very bulky with Eviolite and can set up a free Substitute, slowly boosting its Special Attack with Charge Beam while Spiritomb can't do anything back to it.</p> ",

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>Spiritomb's primary set is an all-out attacking set that plays numerous roles for a team. It heavily relies on prediction, although Black Glasses slightly remedies this issue; nevertheless, it is a great set to eliminate Rapid Spin users such as Cryogonal, which will take heavy damage from a Choice Band-boosted Pursuit. Hitmonchan and Kabutops don't want to switch into Spiritomb either, as they risk getting neutered by Will-O-Wisp. Spiritomb can also get rid of other Ghost-types that prevent your team from eliminating hazards, either by beating them to the punch with Sucker Punch as they try to go for the 2HKO or by trapping them with Pursuit as they switch to a teammate on a predicted Sucker Punch.</p> <p>However, it is advised to be careful when using a Choice Band Sucker Punch, as Spiritomb then becomes setup fodder for bulky sweepers that can take the Sucker Punch with a reasonable amount of health left and proceed to sweep the rest of your team, such as Feraligatr. Shadow Sneak is a great asset late-game, as all of your opponent's Pokemon will be weakened, allowing it to 2HKO nearly everything that doesn't resist it with the help of entry hazards. It is also a good countermeasure against Bulk Up Gallade, and OHKOes offensive Rotom after Stealth Rock. The last slot is mostly dependent on the item Spiritomb holds. Trick is the recommended move to go along with a Choice Band, crippling Eviolite users such as Ferroseed, walls that won't hit that hard such as Steelix, or Pokemon that rely on their coverage to be effective, such as Absol. Will-O-Wisp is recommended with Black Glasses, as being locked into it is usually not the best idea. It cripples Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Kabutops, which rely on their offensive presence in order to be effective Rapid Spin users.</p> <p>If you're worried about Dusknoir outspeeding Spiritomb and staying in to burn it as Spiritomb tries to use Pursuit, a spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe will allow Spiritomb to move first and safely pick off any Dusknoir with less than 40% HP whether they switch out or not. However, those Speed EVs will most likely be useless in any other scenario. Choice Band is the preferred item, as Spiritomb needs all the power it can get and especially appreciates the extra power boost on Shadow Sneak late-game. However, Black Glasses is superior if you prefer crippling physical attackers to trapping walls; furthermore, it also eases prediction. Pain Split is an option in the last slot to regain some health, then switch out. However, because Spiritomb will be locked into the move if it runs Choice Band, it will usually end up healing a wall than healing itself. Return is Spiritomb's strongest option against Dark-type foes such as Absol and Drapion, as well as most Pokemon that aren't weak to either of Spiritomb's STAB options. However, it isn't used because the utility provided by Spiritomb's other moves exceeds its need for coverage. Toxic is an option over Will-O-Wisp, but this does more damage to bulky walls rather than physical attackers, and Trick is the superior option to cripple walls.</p> <p>Steelix, Ferroseed, and Aggron wall this set to kingdom come, although none of them appreciate a burn nor being Tricked a Choice Band. Sandslash can beat Steelix, as well as Aggron that lack Magnet Rise, and can easily pull off a Rapid Spin with no Ghost-type opponents to block it. It also sets up Stealth Rock to complement Shadow Sneak. Ferroseed is a great partner to provide Spikes support, as along with Spiritomb, it can take on almost every physical attacker in the tier, with the lone exception of Entei. Also, Spiritomb pairs well with Pokemon that use High Jump Kick such as Hitmonlee and Medicham, as they are free to spam the move without worry once all Ghost-types are out of the way. This set gives Qwilfish nothing to fear, leaving it free to set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes that will hamper your team. Feraligatr provides great complementary offense alongside Spiritomb, as more often than not they are able to weaken each other's checks so one of them can sweep. Likewise, Magneton is also a great partner, as it can trap Steel-types that get in the way of Spiritomb while also disposing of Qwilfish.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>Unlike the all-out attacking set, which focuses on hitting as hard as possible right away, this set aims to set up a sweep over a long period of time, hitting from the special side. Note that this is not the Pokemon for offensive special sweeps; you are better off using Uxie or Lilligant for that. Calm Mind boosts Spiritomb's average Special Attack, while also making it increasingly harder to KO with each boost. Dark Pulse is the STAB mono-attacking move of choice, as it is the most powerful move that Spiritomb has in its arsenal with no Pokemon that are immune to it. Rest provides recovery, extending Spiritomb's sweep, although with it you are forced to run Sleep Talk to avoid becoming setup bait. While asleep, Spiritomb can do any of three things: hit something hard with Dark Pulse, boost its stats further, or give your opponent a free turn by selecting Rest. However, Rest and Sleep Talk are necessities, as Pain Split generally doesn't cut it as an effective recovery move.</p> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense allows Spiritomb to set up more easily, as it will already be boosting its Special Defense with Calm Mind. Leftovers further enhances Spiritomb's longevity, which is key with this set. Hidden Power Fighting is an option over Sleep Talk to increase coverage on Pokemon such as Clefable, as well as Steel-types. However, leaving an opposing Pokemon free to set up for two turns is usually not the way you win games.</p> <p>Bulky special walls that can phaze are too much for Spiritomb to handle; Mandibuzz resists Dark Pulse while Munchlax is absurdly bulky with its Eviolite, and both can phaze with Whirlwind. As such, Manectric is a great partner for this set, as it can destroy Mandibuzz with its STAB Electric-type moves and cripple Munchlax heavily by using Switcheroo to take its Eviolite away. Also, Spiritomb sets up on Clefable, so Moltres is another great partner that can finish up the game after Spiritomb has done its job. If you are looking for a physical attacker, then Rhydon is a good partner that can destroy Mandibuzz and other special walls with its gargantuan Attack stat and STAB on the EdgeQuake combination.</p> "

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<p>Spiritomb's auspicious Ghost / Dark typing makes it the only Ghost-type in RU not weak to Dark-type attacks, or any other attacking type for that matter. This excellent typing means that Spiritomb is the only spinblocker that is not afraid of Pursuit users. Not only that, but it makes an excellent counter to a plethora of Psychic-types such as Uxie and Mesprit. Spiritomb's grand Special Defense coupled with its RestTalk shenanigans also makes it the best counter available to the premier defensive Rapid Spin user, Cryogonal. For these reasons, this Spiritomb is a staple on many balanced and stall orientated teams.</p> <p>The first move, Will-O-Wisp, significantly diminishes the attacking power of most physical sweepers; this in turn helps patch up Spiritomb's Defense. Will-O-Wisp is also useful for chipping away at special attackers such as Magneton. Foul Play is another way Spiritomb can take on physical attackers, as it can use their power against them and make them hesitant when using physical boosting moves such as Swords Dance. Foul Play's utility is so great that it gives Spiritomb the capability to OHKO Entei after Stealth Rock damage. Rest works well in conjunction with Sleep Talk. RestTalk Spiritomb has many advantages: it always prevents Cryogonal from spinning away entry hazards, defeats many weak walls such as Amoonguss, is an excellent status absorber, and exploits its stalling capabilities via Pressure. Pain Split is a slightly less reliable form of recovery, but it can actually turn Spiritomb's low HP stat into an advantage by recovering more health from the likes of Alomomola. The use of Pain Split provides another distinctive advantage by freeing up an additional moveslot. In that moveslot, Sucker Punch can be used to pick out weakened offensive threats such as Archeops, or Taunt can provide a way to make slower walls helpless.</p> <p>A Calm nature is best used when Spiritomb is not utilizing Sucker Punch, as it reduces the damage taken from Foul Play. If Sucker Punch is used, then a Careful nature is best. In light of other options, Protect works in the final slot by allowing Spiritomb to accumulate Leftovers recovery, stall for burn damage, and ease up prediction when dealing with the likes of Escavalier. While Spiritomb's specially defensive spread allows it to counter Cryogonal and other special attackers, a physically defensive spread with an Impish nature is just as successful in other ways. The physically defensive spread gives Spiritomb a chance to beat Kabutops and makes it a great counter to Normal- and Fighting-types such as Tauros and Gallade; the latter in particular is very threatening for slower teams. When this physically defensive spread is combined with Spiritomb's ability to spread burns, very few physical attacker have the ability to break through it. For example, Choice Band Aggron and Escavalier can usually defeat Spiritomb, but when it uses this physically defensive spread and burns the two threats on the switch, at best, they can only achieve a 3HKO.</p> <p>Spiritomb pairs well with Pokemon that can deal with Fire-types because most Fire-types could care less about anything Spiritomb can do, as they easily power through it with their high-powered STABs. Qwilfish is one of the best at dealing with these threats and it aids Spiritomb in many ways; not only does Qwilfish deal with the likes of Durant, Emboar, and Entei, but it can also set up Spikes, which helps Spiritomb wear down the opposing team faster. Spiritomb's spinblocking ability can help keep those Spikes on the field, and it can also check Electric- and Psychic-types that trouble Qwilfish. Poliwrath can check the same threats as Qwilfish and can also phaze with Circle Throw; this trait compliments Spiritomb's ability to keep entry hazards from being blown away well. Roselia, Lanturn, and Clefable all make fine defensive partners for their ability to rid Spiritomb of status afflictions. Roselia can set up Toxic Spikes and put a threatening Pokemon to sleep, Lanturn is another bulky Water-type that can take on pesky Fire-types, and Clefable can provide Stealth Rock and Wish support. Ferroseed also works well with Spiritomb as it can provide entry hazard support and counter Kabutops fairly well. Physically defensive Spiritomb, Alomomola, and Steelix make an excellent core, as the three can check almost all physical attackers in RU. Steelix benefits the core by providing entry hazard support in Stealth Rock and phazing utility in Roar, Spiritomb keeps Stealth Rock from being spun away and checks Fighting-types, and Alomomola beats physical Fire-types and passes Wishes to the other two.</p> <p>Seeing as how this Spiritomb can fit on balanced teams, offensive partners can also be just as helpful. Medicham and any other Fighting-type destroys annoying Steel-types such as Aggron and Steelix, and Spiritomb can return the favor and beat the Psychic- and Ghost-types that Medicham hates. Magneton can also deal with Steel-types such as Escavalier by trapping and then demolishing them with Hidden Power Fire. Finally, because Spiritomb lures in Choice-locked Fire-types, Water-types such as Omastar and Kabutops are useful to take advantage of that by setting up a Shell Smash or Swords Dance, respectively.</p> "

Its Swords Dance set is threatening, and it is a very effective stallbreaker with the combination of Swords Dance and Taunt. Drapion is also one of the better Pursuit users in the metagame; because it poses the threat of making Pokemon such as Rotom, Slowking, and Cryogonal setup fodder, it can catch them with Pursuit as they flee to make their defensive duties much more difficult. Drapion isn't without its flaws though, because while base 90 Attack is by no means bad, it's still pretty weak without a boost. Drapion also has to rely on weaker Base Power STAB moves than most of the tier. Furthermore, Drapion faces some heavy competition in its attacking roles; Absol has much more Attack and the strongest priority move in the game, Spiritomb can block Rapid Spin while being an effective Pursuit user, and Escavalier has a much more powerful STAB move in Megahorn. That being said, Drapion is still good, but you just need to be sure that it's exactly what you're looking for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chief among Drapion's other options is a Choice Scarf set. With a Choice Scarf, Drapion can function as both a Pursuit trapper and a revenge killer, but base 90 Attack is far too weak without a boosting item. Drapion can run a bulkier take on a Swords Dance set, using Rest and Sleep Talk along with Crunch to act as a mono-attacking RestTalk booster. However, Drapion needs to invest heavily in bulk to accumulate enough boosts this way, making an offensive Swords Dance set usually superior. On the topic of boosting moves, Drapion also has access to Agility. This is of little use, however, as Drapion is relatively fast already, and more often than not lacks the immediate power to sweep as opposed to Speed. To take advantage of Sniper, Night Slash and Cross Poison can be used for a greater chance of a critical hit. However, this is not advised, as relying on luck is never a reason to use an otherwise inferior move. That being said, if you really want to trust your luck, you can always use Acupressure; it might work, but probably not. Drapion can act as a supporter for weather teams, as it is able to set up both Rain Dance and Sunny Day. However, Uxie supports its team far better, and Drapion doesn't bring any key resistances to the table to justify its use. Although it receives STAB, Payback shouldn't get any use as Drapion is too fast to be an effective user of the move. One very interesting move in Drapion's movepool is Torment, which cripples many Ghost-types, such as Rotom and Misdreavus; they usually only run one coverage move, and Drapion resists their STAB Ghost-type move. Other viable physical moves in Drapion's movepool include X-Scissor, Brick Break, Rock Slide, Thunder Fang, Ice Fang, and Iron Tail. While all of these offer coverage options against very specific opponents, they don't bring enough to the table to find use in one of Drapion's main sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Poliwrath is the best counter in existence to all Drapion variants. No matter how hard it tries, Drapion just can't break through it. Poliwrath can then attempt to burn it with Scald, or get rid of its boosts with Circle Throw. Rhydon is the next best option for countering Drapion, although it fears the rare Aqua Tail. Otherwise, it can switch into even Earthquake and KO Drapion with one of its own Earthquakes. Tangrowth is a decent option for checking Drapion if it carries Earthquake, but Poison Jab hurts a lot. Steelix is a pretty good check to Drapion, but like Rhydon, it is easily worn down due to its lack of recovery and can only 2HKO with an uninvested Earthquake. Ferroseed is a good check to any Drapion set that lacks Taunt, as it really doesn't take much from any of its attacks, and can paralyze it and use Leech Seed to continually recover HP. Escavalier is one of the best offensive checks to Drapion, as it can switch in on any of Drapion's moves and OHKOes with a Choice Band-boosted Megahorn. Both Bouffalant and Druddigon are bulky enough to take an unboosted onslaught, and can each KO with Earthquake and Outrage (almost all of the time), respectively. Justified Gallade is worth mentioning, as it can snag an Attack boost if hit by Crunch or Pursuit and proceed to OHKO with Close Combat. Aerodactyl and Archeops are both naturally faster than Drapion, and can switch in for free on a predicted Earthquake and KO it with one of their own. Durant is faster than Drapion as well, and can use its own natural bulk to take even a +2 Earthquake and 2HKO in return.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Drapion is most effective when utilizing its Speed, bulk, and power to sweep with Swords Dance. Setup opportunities aren't hard to come by, as Drapion can force out Pokemon such as Rotom, Slowking, and Mesprit quite easily to pick up a Swords Dance. Once at +2, Drapion is able to 2HKO nearly every Pokemon in the tier, with even defensive behemoths such as Tangrowth, Steelix, and Poliwrath falling to Life Orb-boosted assaults. Crunch is Drapion's main STAB move that gets pretty good neutral coverage on the tier, and hits the many Psychic-types in the metagame for super effective damage. Earthquake hits a lot of things that Crunch doesn't, including Steel-types and opposing Drapion. Steelix and Ferroseed don't take +2 Life Orb-boosted Earthquakes that well, and Earthquake also gets the crucial OHKO on Aggron.</p> <p>The last slot can be a tough decision, as both moves are very good and have a lot of use in the current metagame. Poison Jab is the superior choice to make Drapion a more potent offensive threat, as it OHKOes Tangrowth at +2, and 2HKOes Poliwrath after Stealth Rock, although the latter will phaze Drapion out before it can land a second blow. Poison Jab is also good for getting a guaranteed OHKO on Grass-type threats such as Lilligant and Sceptile. Taunt, on the other hand, ensures Drapion's longevity isn't cut short by status, and prevents Pokemon such as Slowking, Rotom, or Uxie leaving it with a parting gift of paralysis or burn. Poison Jab is generally better, but Taunt can still be useful for setting up to oblivion on certain threats.</p> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed is used so Drapion can hit as hard as possible while Speed tying with other base 95 Speed Pokemon, as well as outspeeding the likes of Rotom, Moltres, and Lilligant. Life Orb is generally the best item, as Drapion needs all the power it can get, and the HP lost is but a small price to pay, especially because Drapion looks to set up by forcing switches. Lum Berry is also a good choice, and it is especially useful to prevent status effects that can't be blocked by Taunt, such as a Scald burn or a Body Slam paralysis. A bulkier spread of 180 HP / 72 Atk / 252 Spe can be used in the hope that Drapion will be able to attain more boosts. Both Lum Berry and Black Sludge are viable item choices with this spread, and Taunt becomes a much better option. Sniper is the ability of choice, as Drapion isn't looking to take hits, it's looking to dish them out. There are some additional options that you can use on this set; Aqua Tail can be used in place of Poison Jab to hit Pokemon that Drapion would otherwise find it hard to get past, such as Rhydon and Steelix, but Poison Jab is better overall. Pursuit is also viable, and it allows Drapion to KO Pokemon such as Rotom that have the balls to stay in as you set up, but then are promptly destroyed as they try to flee.</p> <p>As this set relies on forcing switches to set up a Swords Dance, entry hazard support is greatly recommended. As a bonus, it also helps Drapion get past its checks. For example, two layers of Spikes allows Drapion to OHKO Intimidate Qwilfish with a +1 Earthquake. A great partner to set these hazards up is Roselia, which has access to Spikes, has good synergy with Drapion, and can dispose of Drapion's checks while it sets up on many special walls and attackers. Grass-type Pokemon such as Sceptile work well with Drapion, and can break through Poliwrath, one of Drapion's greatest checks. Rotom is another great partner for this set, as it synergizes well with Drapion, beats Poliwrath, and weakens walls with Pain Split, allowing Drapion to take them down later. Bulkier variants can also go toe-to-toe with Escavalier, another one of this set's best checks. Clefable also partners well with this set, as it has access to Wish and Heal Bell to grant Drapion another chance at a sweep. In return, Drapion can force out Ghost-types such as Rotom and Golurk, which Clefable can't touch when they're behind a Substitute.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Drapion is one of the better Pursuit users in the metagame, and this set looks to hit hard off the bat in order to use the move effectively. Drapion is capable of trapping Ghost- and Psychic-types with ease thanks to its handy resistances to their STAB moves, and it is also the fastest Pursuit user in RU, meaning that it can Speed tie with Uxie and outspeed Mesprit and Rotom. While Pursuit is used to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types as they flee, Drapion also has the reliable and powerful Crunch to hit them with if they choose to stay in. Crunch is also Drapion's best STAB move that gets good coverage on the majority of the metagame, and Drapion can sweep late-game with it once the opponent's team has been weakened. Earthquake hits most of the threats that Crunch misses out on, such as Fighting-, Dark-, and Steel-types. In practice, it gives Drapion a way of hitting Aggron, Steelix, and opposing Drapion hard. There are two good options in the last slot; Poison Jab is generally the better option as it allows Drapion to hit Grass-types hard. It 2HKOes all variants of Tangrowth after Stealth Rock, and allows Drapion to OHKO Lilligant and Sceptile, which no other move in Drapion's arsenal is capable of doing. That being said, Aqua Tail is a viable alternative, and it allows Drapion to hit Rhydon hard, which would otherwise be a hard counter to it; it also allows Drapion to OHKO Moltres without the help of Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature lets Drapion outrun Rotom and Speed tie with opposing base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Uxie, Jynx, and Haunter. Maximum investment in Attack allows Drapion to hit as hard as possible, and the remaining EVs slightly increase Drapion's bulk. Choice Band is the preferred item choice, as Drapion needs all the power it can get due to its average Attack stat, and doesn't mind being locked into one move. However, Life Orb is another good choice that allows Drapion to switch between moves at the cost of slightly decreasing its longevity. Choice Band's power is necessary most of the time though, as Life Orb Crunch can fail to OHKO Golurk and bulky Rotom while a Choice Band picks up both of the aforementioned KOs without fail. Sniper is the recommended ability, as Drapion will be hitting first most of the time and shouldn't be taking many hits.</p> <p>This set is a great partner for Pokemon that enjoy the removal of Ghost-types. The plethora of Fighting-types in RU all appreciate Drapion's help, as Medicham, Hitmonlee, and Primeape can all power through the rest of your opponent's team once their Ghost-type is gone. The former two are especially good partners, as they are free to use their ridiculously high-powered High Jump Kick to great effect with no Ghost-types to stop them. Spinners that fail to get past spinblockers, such as Hitmonchan, also appreciate Drapion's talents. Without a spinblocker standing in their way, they are able to use Rapid Spin without fail, giving Pokemon such as Moltres and Scyther a chance to shine while also giving your team momentum. Because this set can also clean up late-game with Crunch, hazards and complementary offense are of top priority. Accelgor is a good user of Spikes that can take down Tangrowth and Steelix, and Aerodactyl sets up Stealth Rock while weakening Drapion's checks. This set is countered mainly by the likes of Poliwrath, Rhydon, and Steelix, so Pokemon such as Manectric and Magmortar, which can break these defensive behemoths, allows Drapion to sweep late-game.</p> "

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<p>This set takes advantage of Drapion's key resistances to Ghost-, Psychic-, and Grass-type attacks to combat some of the most threatening sweepers in the metagame. This set can fit well on stall teams that are looking for an additional check to Pokemon like Sceptile, Lilligant, Sigilyph, and Substitute + Calm Mind Uxie; it can also defeat Clefable using Taunt, which is usually a headache for stall teams due to its inability to take residual damage. This set looks to take hits and hit back with one of Drapion's STAB moves, and although they are rather weak without investment, they are typically super effective against the threats that Drapion is being used to check. Crunch is good against Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Rotom and Mesprit, while Poison Jab finds use against Grass-types such as Lilligant. Whirlwind is a great asset for Drapion, as it can hit Pokemon behind Substitutes that Drapion may or may not be able to deal with, ranging from Rotom to Entei to Gallade, the latter two being somewhat harder for Drapion to KO. It also allows Drapion to rack up entry hazard damage, which is likely because this set is typically seen on defensive teams. Taunt, while also having the aforementioned use for beating Clefable, also allows Drapion to prevent slower threats from setting up, as well as protecting it from status from the likes of Spiritomb, Tangrowth, and Lilligant.</p> <p>16 Speed EVs allow Drapion to outspeed and Taunt both Omastar and Crawdaunt before they can use Shell Smash or Dragon Dance, respectively. The rest is placed in HP and Special Defense to allow Drapion to take special attacks more easily. 248 HP EVs specifically let Drapion take less damage from entry hazards. A physically defensive spread could work as well thanks to Drapion's impressive Defense stat, but Drapion will never be a true physical wall due to its weakness to common Ground-type attacks and lack of useful resistances. Instead, it is better off using its resistances to play the role of a specially defensive pivot that counters key threats such as Sceptile and Rotom. Battle Armor is the preferred ability; while a Sniper boost might come in handy at times, this set focuses more on taking hits than dishing them out. Toxic Spikes are an option on this set, however they aren't very effective in the current metagame because of common threats such as Amoonguss, Drapion, and Qwilfish that can easily nullify them. Similarly, Toxic can be used to inflict status more reliably. RestTalk is viable on this set as well, with two attacks or Whirlwind being good options that work well with it. It acts as a good sleep absorber against the Grass-types that Drapion can effectively check, such as Lilligant and Tangrowth. However, you miss out on Taunt and become a slave to the random number generator. Knock Off can cripple Eviolite users such as Roselia, Ferroseed, and Rhydon, but the former two are beaten regardless, and Drapion has no business staying in on the latter two. Earthquake can be used as well to hit Steel-types among others, but Drapion lacks the space for it and it is very weak without investment.</p> <p>Wish support is one of the most important qualities Drapion looks for in a teammate. Clefable is an excellent choice that can take on more powerful special attackers such as Moltres, as well as set up Stealth Rock for Drapion to take advantage of with Whirlwind. Another choice is Alomomola, which has decent synergy with Drapion and can take on physical attackers such as Feraligatr. Both Pokemon also have the advantage of being able to Toxic stall with Wish and Protect. Other good partners are those that can set up more hazards, as this lets Drapion rack up more damage with Whirlwind. Some examples that synergize well are Aerodactyl, which can set up Stealth Rock, and Accelgor, for Spikes.</p> "

  "Lickilicky": {
    "overview": "<p>Even with above average defenses and a movepool twice as long as its tongue, Lickilicky finds itself firmly entrenched in the lower tiers. Lickilicky's great 110 / 95 / 95 defenses are among the best available in RU, and its respectable base 85 Attack prevents it from being a sitting duck. Additionally, Lickilicky boasts the second largest Wish in RU, second to only Alomomola. The fun doesn't stop there; Lickilicky has a ton of other support options, including Heal Bell, Dragon Tail, Knock Off, Disable, and Seismic Toss, making it an excellent team supporter. Clefable is Lickilicky's only real challenger in RU as a specially defensive Wish passer; thanks to Magic Guard, Clefable maintains an immunity to entry hazard damage and status moves, as well as all other forms of indirect damage. However, Lickilicky has several advantages over Clefable, including superior natural defenses, a bigger Wish, and Dragon Tail. If you really need another reason to use Lickilicky, it's worth noting that Lickilicky has the strongest Explosion in the game, letting it go out with quite a bang.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Lickilicky has an incredible movepool that many offensive powerhouses can only dream of. Lickilicky has many great coverage moves, including Earthquake, Power Whip, Aqua Tail, Brick Break, Rock Slide, Hammer Arm, Zen Headbutt, Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Gyro Ball on the physical side, and Surf, Focus Blast, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Fire Blast, and Shadow Ball on the special end. Any of these moves can be used for coverage over a particular Pokemon--for example, if Omastar is a huge threat to your team, you could use Power Whip to OHKO it after it uses Shell Smash. Lickilicky gets a variety of boosting moves, including Curse, Work Up, and Swords Dance, but is often outclassed by more offensively inclined Pokemon, such as Sceptile and Kabutops. Lickilicky has enough HP to make 101 HP Substitutes coupled with Focus Punch, but there are stronger Pokemon, like Golurk and Hitmonchan, who use such a set better. Rain Dance and Sunny Day are both interesting options, but Lickilicky doesn't benefit from the weather itself, and it doesn't receive STAB on the moves that do. Rest and Sleep Talk are severely outclassed by Wish, which can be passed to a teammate, and Heal Bell rids it of status already. Cloud Nine, Lickilicky's Dream World ability, would be the primary option if it were not illegal with several of Lickilicky's key moves, including Wish.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Fighting-types, such as Hitmonchan, Gallade, Medicham, and Hitmonlee, can all devastate Lickilicky with their STAB moves, although the latter two must be wary when using High Jump Kick because of Protect. Taunt prevents Lickilicky from healing itself, which often means a swift demise. If not using Heal Bell, Toxic and other forms of status will quickly wear down Lickilicky. Aggron, Klinklang, and other bulky Rock- and Steel-types are not bothered by anything Lickilicky can throw at them bar the rare Earthquake, and can either set up on it or simply attack. Golurk can set up a Substitute and then Focus Punch away, as Dragon Tail will not break its Substitute.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its good bulk, ability to pass enormous Wishes, and access to phazing in Dragon Tail, Lickilicky makes for an outstanding team supporter. Wish in combination with Protect allows Lickilicky to both heal itself and its teammates. With a monstrous 212 HP being passed every time Lickilicky uses Wish, the recipient will often be recovering more than half of their health. Furthermore, Protect allows Lickilicky to scout a potential Trick from a known Choice item user, such as Rotom-C, and respond accordingly. Body Slam provides Lickilicky with a reliable STAB move with a nifty chance of paralysis, while Return does more damage overall. Lastly, Dragon Tail is a fantastic move that allows Lickilicky to phaze out opposing Pokemon that try to set up on it, and it also spreads entry hazard damage.</p> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment allows Lickilicky to pass the largest Wishes possible and makes the most use of Lickilicky's typing and defenses. A physically defensive set is largely outclassed for several reasons: Alomomola functions better as a physically defensive Wish passer; Lickilicky is weak to one of the most prominent physical types, Fighting; and there are superior physical walls available in RU, such as Dusknoir, Tangrowth, and Spiritomb.</p> <p>Lickilicky has many viable options on this set. Heal Bell grants Lickilicky the opportunity to act as a cleric, curing your team of status ailments. Disable is an interesting option that received a huge boost in BW; it now functions over a longer period of time, meaning that Lickilicky can lock the opponent out of using a critical move. Knock Off cripples nearly every Pokemon, ridding Eviolite users of their magnified defenses, Leftovers users of their recovery, and offensive Pokemon of their Life Orb or Choice item. Seismic Toss is usable, although it neutralizes one of Lickilicky's main draws over Clefable, a higher Attack stat and access to Body Slam. Toxic works wonders in conjunction with Protect and Wish, but Lickilicky simply doesn't have enough reason to use it over other useful moves.</p> <p>Physically defensive partners, especially those that resist Fighting-type moves, are capable teammates. Spiritomb and Tangrowth are both viable options and can handle the plethora of Fighting-types that can hit Lickilicky. Entry hazard support is critical for Lickilicky, as Dragon Tail's effectiveness is greatly boosted when Stealth Rock and several layers of Spikes or Toxic Spikes are up. Qwilfish has Intimidate to weaken physical assaults and can lay both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, while Uxie can set up Stealth Rock and KO opposing Fighting-types with Psychic. Both of these Pokemon do not have access to recovery moves outside of Rest, so Lickilicky's Wish support is greatly appreciated. If a more offensively inclined Spikes user is desirable, Scolipede has a 4x resistance to Fighting-type moves and can maim the opposition with STAB Megahorn. Ghost-type Pokemon such as Spiritomb, Dusknoir, and Rotom all pair well with Lickilicky, as they can easily handle obnoxious Fighting-type Pokemon and burn them with Will-O-Wisp, as well as block Rapid Spin from ridding the hazards that generally come with Lickilicky. Lastly, Steelix or bulky Water-types, such as Lanturn and Slowking, make for good partners, as they can handle Klinklang and other Steel-type Pokemon who try to set up on Lickilicky.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Though most offensive variants of Lickilicky are outclassed by Clefable, this set is an exception thanks to its higher base Attack, better coverage, and most importantly, STAB Explosion. Despite the fact that Explosion was weakened with the advent of BW, Lickilicky's is still strong enough to OHKO some of the bulkiest Pokemon in RU such as Tangrowth and Qwilfish. Furthermore, Explosion allows frail powerhouses, such as Absol or Accelgor, who usually struggle finding moves to switch into, to be brought in unscathed. Since Lickilicky's Support set is bait for Fighting-type Pokemon, it also acts as a surprise to them. Return is the main STAB move of the set, and it hits most Pokemon that don't resist it for a lot of damage. However, Body Slam is a very interesting alternative over Return, due to its chance of paralyzing the opponent's Pokemon. Power Whip and Fire Punch are used as coverage moves because they complement Return well, hitting the Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon that resist Lickilicky's STAB for super effective damage. Explosion, despite its raw power, should be used very carefully, since the opponent might predict it and switch in a Ghost-type Pokemon.</p> <p>The best way of stopping Choice Band Lickilicky is proper prediction. Pokemon such as Magneton or Omastar can be brought in on a Power Whip or a Fire Punch, respectively, though they're both OHKOed by the correct coverage move. They can also tank a Return or two if needed. Tangrowth is one of the Pokemon with enough bulk to wall Choice Band Lickilicky, despite its powerful Fire Punch, though it has to be aware of Explosion. Also, since Lickilicky has no way of hitting Ghost-types for super effective damage, Pokemon such as Spiritomb and Dusknoir can take everything Lickilicky throws at them and burn it with Will-O-Wisp, leaving it greatly crippled for the rest of the battle. The EV spread gives Lickilicky all the power it can get, along with a decent amount of bulk and the ability to outrun any Clefable that doesn't invest in Speed, which is very useful, since Lickilicky can 2HKO Clefable before it has the opportunity to use Soft-Boiled. Since this variant of Lickilicky causes lots of switches, entry hazard support from the likes of Accelgor is appreciated, along with a Ghost-type Pokemon to protect the entry hazards from Rapid Spin. Furthermore, both Accelgor and Ghost-types can take Fighting-type moves aimed at Lickilicky. Similarly, since Lickilicky easily lures in Fighting-types, Pokemon such as Omastar and Aerodactyl, that benefit from having them out of the way, are good partners to Lickilicky as well. Lickilicky also has access to an amount of coverage moves bigger than its tongue, including Aqua Tail, Earthquake, Hammer Arm, and Thunder Punch, but Fire Punch and Power Whip are usually superior in terms of coverage. Last but not least, Lickilicky can also be on a Trick Room team with a Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs, but Pokemon such as Druddigon hit much harder than it does, so it's not recommended.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>The first thing people see when looking at Tangrowth are its huge base stats, with four out of its six base stats being over base 100, a rare sight to see in RU. Among those stats lie a high Defense and respectable offenses, which allow Tangrowth to function as an effective tank. The biggest boon to Tangrowth, however, is its ability, which allows it to regain one-third of its maximum health upon switching out, making it much harder to kill. To complement all that, Tangrowth gets access to Sleep Powder, which effectively lets it incapacitate a Pokemon for the rest of the battle. Unfortunately, the two stats that aren't up-to-par are those that burden it the most; a low Special Defense and Speed make it easy to kill with special attacks. Tangrowth also faces stiff competition from Amoonguss, which sports an actual Special Defense stat, the more accurate Spore, a better defensive typing, and the same Regenerator ability; Tangrowth's higher offenses lets it beat most setup sweepers even after sleep clause has been activated, though. The metagame has also prepared for sleep inducers, which lowers the impact of Tangrowth's main weapon: Sleep Powder.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chlorophyll is a great ability to use on a sun team, as it alleviates Tangrowth's Speed issues; Tangrowth even has access to Growth, SolarBeam, and Synthesis to further take advantage of the sun. A Swords Dance set is semi-viable, as Tangrowth has a great base 100 Attack to utilize it with, but Tangrowth's Speed presents itself as a major issue, and it's better off using its higher base 110 Special Attack stat to go on the offensive. Tangrowth also has access to some other support moves such as Toxic and Reflect, but they're mostly outclassed by the moves listed above.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Magmortar is a great check to Tangrowth, as it can hit Tangrowth on its weaker Special Defense with STAB super effective Fire-type attacks, and doesn't care about Sleep Powder thanks to Vital Spirit, either. Other specially offensive Fire-types such as Typhlosion and Moltres are also great at dealing with Tangrowth, but they must be vary of Sleep Powder and Hidden Power Rock. Sap Sipper users such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck can come in on Sleep Powder and Tangrowth's other STAB attacks and get a free Attack boost out of them, but they have to avoid Focus Blast, Hidden Power Fighting, and in the latter's case, Hidden Power Fire as well. Galvantula can hit both Tangrowth and its most common partner, Slowking, with STAB super effective Bug-type attacks. Bulky Sigilyph is resilient enough to tank even a Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Rock, outlast them with Roost, and then proceed to KO Tangrowth with Air Slash, Heat Wave, or even Psychic. Scolipede and Durant need to watch out for Hidden Power Fire, but can otherwise do a number on both Tangrowth and Slowking, effectively defeating the core. Other Fire-types such as Entei and Emboar can deal with Tangrowth despite them being physically based, as a Choice Band-boosted Flare Blitz from either of them will leave Tangrowth crippled. Sleep absorbers, like the two mentioned above, and even Choice Band or specially defensive Druddigon can get past Tangrowth's most threatening weapon, Sleep Powder. Roselia, Amoonguss, and Clefable can wall Tangrowth with ease once sleep clause has been activated and can then proceed to take it out with Hidden Power Fire or Fire Blast if they carry it. Generally any special attacker that has a hard-hitting move can force Tangrowth out, but be careful of Sleep Powder immobilizing said attacker, and know that Tangrowth doesn't mind being forced out thanks to Regenerator.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Although this set has seen better days, it still remains Tangrowth's most effective set, utilizing its high Defense and offenses along with the ability to keep switching thanks to Regenerator to make Tangrowth a tough vine to break. Furthermore, Tangrowth's larger offensive presence gives it an edge over other walls. Sleep Powder is Tangrowth's most valuable move, having the ability to render a would-be threat useless for the entire match; the only thing lacking is its accuracy, as a miss can lead to disastrous results. Power Whip is a strong STAB attack that gives Tangrowth the ability to break past Cryogonal and Slowking while maintaining the ability to check Gallade, something Amoonguss cannot boast of. Giga Drain is a worthy alternative if you desire extra healing as well as the ability to switch into Scalds without fear of weakening Tangrowth's main STAB move. Hidden Power Fighting is used to maim Aggron while landing a strong hit on Sap Sipper users such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck, but Hidden Power Fire can be used instead to decimate Durant while getting much stronger hit on Escavalier and Ferroseed, though it should be noted that Hidden Power Fighting deals with the latter just fine. The last slot is assigned for extra healing; whether it be from Synthesis or Leech Seed is up to you. Synthesis is Tangrowth's most reliable way of healing, as it doesn't force Tangrowth to switch out. Leech Seed, however, provides chip damage as well as a way to force threats out, and is especially useful if Tangrowth is used on a Spikes-stacking team; furthermore, Leech Seed can be used as a way to provide healing for partners that don't have access to reliable recovery, such as Druddigon and Golurk.</p> <p>16 Special Defense EVs are used to avoid the OHKO from Absol's Fire Blast with the rest thrown into Defense and HP for better durability. The choice of nature depends on your choice of STAB move; if Tangrowth is using Power Whip, use Relaxed, otherwise, use Bold. Hidden Power Rock can be used to catch Moltres and other Fire-types on the switch, but Sleep Powder does that well enough and Hidden Power Fire or Fighting provide more utility. In a similar case, Rock Slide can be used so Hidden Power Fire or Fighting isn't sacrificed, but again, the moves mentioned above are overall more useful. Stun Spore and Knock Off are other useful support options, but are outclassed by those listed. Earthquake can be used in the second slot to get a hard hit on Fire-types such as Emboar and Magmortar, but Tangrowth is better off using the moves mentioned above. Similarly, Focus Blast can be used over Hidden Power Fighting for more power, but makes dealing with Substitute Bouffalant and Sawsbuck a luck-driven game, as they can just fish for misses and PP stall Tangrowth.</p> <p>As for partners, Tangrowth appreciates Pokemon that can switch into special Fire-type attacks; specially defensive Regirock, defensive Druddigon, and Thick Fat Miltank fit the bill, and they can also set up Stealth Rock. Qwilfish and Poliwrath can also switch into Fire-types as well as Bug-types; the former can even set up Spikes, which work great with Leech Seed since it forces switches. Slowking forms a solid and sturdy Regenerator core with Tangrowth, as they have great synergy together. Pokemon that deal with the likes of Lilligant, Roselia, and Amoonguss are also appreciated, as Tangrowth is hard walled by them; Fire-types such as Moltres and Emboar are good choices for that, and the latter can even act as a sleep absorber with Sleep Talk.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Tangrowth puts its high Special Attack stat to good use with this set, as it lets Tangrowth go completely offensive while still offering a nice cushion for physical blows. Leaf Storm is the STAB move of choice for this set, as it provides immense power coming off of Tangrowth's boosted Special Attack; the drop in Special Attack isn't too worrisome, as Tangrowth likes switching due to Regenerator healing. Focus Blast hits annoying Steel-types for solid damage, securing an OHKO on Steelix and Ferroseed, the latter after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Hidden Power Rock hits Fire-types such as Moltres and Magmortar for super effective damage, OHKOing the former and having a high chance to OHKO the latter after Stealth Rock, which is guaranteed if Tangrowth uses Choice Specs. While using Sleep Powder seems weird on a set with Choice Specs as one of the recommended items, its potential to cripple a threat for the rest of the match is invaluable; and, as mentioned before, Tangrowth doesn't mind switching, as it will only be healing HP thanks to Regenerator.</p> <p>The EVs maximize power and let Tangrowth outspeed everything up to minimum Speed Lanturn with the rest thrown in HP for overall bulk. Life Orb offers a nice boost in power, with Regenerator offsetting Life Orb recoil more often than not. Choice Specs can be used instead for immense power at the cost of being locked into a move; Tangrowth will be switching often anyway, so that isn't a big problem. Hidden Power Fire is a useful move to hit Escavalier hard while getting rid of other Steel-types with more reliability than Focus Blast, but Hidden Power Rock's ability to hit Moltres and other Fire-types such as Entei and Typhlosion is usually superior. Giga Drain can be used over Leaf Storm, but the latter's power often overshadows the former's healing on this particular set.</p> <p>Despite the increase in power, Amoonguss and Roselia are still stops to Tangrowth, which makes having a Fire-type partner such as Moltres or Emboar useful. In return, Tangrowth blasts Water-types out of the way for them to sweep. Gallade is another good partner to get rid of Amoonguss, and also lures out Spiritomb for Tangrowth to switch in on. Similarly, Absol can Pursuit trap the likes of Uxie while also luring out and getting rid of Escavalier with Fire Blast, but Absol rarely every runs both those moves on the same set, so just Pursuit trapping and having Fire-type partners dispose of Escavalier is good enough. Lanturn also pairs well with Tangrowth, as they have solid synergy together; Lanturn can also get Tangrowth in safely with a slow Volt Switch, while also providing chip damage on Druddigon and other Grass-types with Toxic and Scald burns. Entry hazard setters are useful so that Tangrowth can get KOs such as that on Ferroseed with Focus Blast and Magmortar with Hidden Power Rock; Qwilfish and Rhydon are good for this, and they also have good synergy with Tangrowth. Choice Specs Slowking and Tangrowth make for an excellent Regenerator core, as they share good synergy and hit like trucks.</p> "

  "Electivire": {
    "overview": "<p>Electivire's best trait is the amazing coverage that it obtains, allowing it to hit almost every Pokemon for super effective damage. Electivire also has generally high offensive stats to utilize its coverage with, while also outpacing most of the metagame with its above average Speed. In addition, unlike most other Electric-types, Electivire is primarily a physical attacker, which allows it to defeat Slowking easier, and access to Flamethrower enables to hit certain physical walls, such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, harder than others. Unfortunately, Electivire still struggles against bulky Pokemon that it cannot hit super effectively such as Uxie, Crustle, and Spiritomb, and it can rarely OHKO its foes even with super effective attacks. This, combined with its frailty, entry hazard susceptibility, and recoil from Life Orb and its main STAB move in Wild Charge, wears Electivire down fast. Electivire also lacks a viable way to boost its offensive stats, making it struggle heavily defensively-oriented teams, often going down on its own accord. Electivire has many flaws, but it's overall a very unique Electric-type and is good at wearing down the opposition with its impeccable coverage and offensive prowess.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Electivire has other options to consider, but they are rarely worth using. The first of which is Vital Spirit, which is a useful ability in a tier where sleep inducers such as Lilligant and Smeargle are common. While Vital Spirit is useful, Motor Drive makes Electivire a much scarier late-game sweeper. Some of Electivire's best checks, mainly bulky Ground-types, are hit hard by Hidden Power Grass, but Ice Punch does enough damage to most of them, and the ones it doesn't do very much against are rare or defeat it regardless. Electivire's only means of setup is via Meditate, but finding the opportunity to set up with Electivire is tough, though it could be worth it. Cross Chop is useful for hitting Clefable and other Normal-types, but its use essentially stops there, and its other moves are typically more useful. Electivire's strongest move is actually Focus Punch despite the fact that it lacks a STAB boost, so it is capable of running a decent SubPunch set, aided by the fact that it causes a lot of switches. Unfortunately, using two moveslots ultimately limits Electivire's coverage immensely, and even though its Focus Punch is strong, it pales in comparison to other SubPunch users that get a STAB boost. Finally, Electivire's decent offensive stats, good movepool, and access to Volt Switch allow it to utilize all Choice items effectively, but the main issue is that it cannot switch moves in this case, which is Electivire's most useful trait.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Not very many Pokemon can counter Electivire due to its high offensive stats and amazing coverage, but Electivire struggles to get past Pokemon that aren't weak to any particular move it carries, or Pokemon who have good defensive stats. Bulky Ground-types, such as Piloswine and Rhydon, stand out as the best checks, as they can take anything bar the rare Hidden Power Grass (and in Rhydon's case, Earthquake, does a noticeable amount of damage) and OHKO it back with Earthquake. Quagsire is also a formidable switch-in, as it is immune to Wild Charge, resists Flamethrower, and takes neutral damage from Electivire's coverage moves; however, it too must be aware of Hidden Power Grass variants. Crustle can use Electivire as setup fodder thanks to its high Defense, and either set up entry hazards or Shell Smash, or just hit Electivire with its STAB move or Earthquake. Although Regirock is weak to Earthquake, it can sponge the move with its massive Defense and OHKO back with an Earthquake of its own. Bulky versions of Rotom avoid the 2HKO from anything Electivire has and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp; keep in mind, though, that Ice Punch will 2HKO offensive variants of Rotom. Uxie doesn't take very much damage from any of Electivire's moves and can wear it down with its own STAB moves. Any Gardevoir with Trace gets a free switch into Wild Charge thanks to it copying Motor Drive, and it can hit Electivire back with its STAB moves. There are several revenge killers that can OHKO Electivire, such as Choice Scarf Emboar and Medicham, along with Choice Band Entei thanks to Extreme Speed, which manages to KO after some prior damage. Finally, if all else fails, smart switching will aid in defeating Electivire; between Life Orb damage and Wild Charge recoil, it might end up defeating itself in due time.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Electivire's best traits are shown in this set—namely, a significant amount of coverage. As one of the few physically offensive Electric-types, it plays differently from other Electric-types in the tier. With that in mind, it's important to know that even though the listed moves can 2HKO most of the metagame, Electivire cannot OHKO very many Pokemon, and the opponent can predict around it while it wears itself out with recoil damage. As a result, it works best as a late-game attacker, letting its teammates weaken the opponent and lay entry hazards until it goes in for the KO.</p> <p>In DPP, Electivire lacked a strong STAB option, but BW gifted it with Wild Charge, somewhat fulfilling that wish. As a result, it's Electivire's preferred STAB move, as it comes off of Electivire's higher Attack stat and covers dangerous threats such as Slowking, Qwilfish, Moltres, and Kabutops. Flamethrower complements Wild Charge well, hitting common physical walls such as Steelix and Tangrowth hard, as both are immune to or resist Electric-type moves. Earthquake is mainly for opposing Electric-types, which it can typically get a free switch into thanks to Motor Drive, Fire-type Pokemon such as Typhlosion and Entei, and Aggron. Finally, Ice Punch is useful to get a strong hit on Druddigon and Ground-type Pokemon.</p> <p>The given EVs allow Electivire to OHKO Tangrowth with Flamethrower after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, outspeed Rotom and everything slower, and provide extra power for its physical attacks. However, if eliminating Tangrowth from the match is extremely important, 188 Special Attack EVs can be used to land an OHKO on it after Stealth Rock damage, but this weakens Electivire's physical moves by quite a bit. Motor Drive is the best ability for Electivire, as it grants it a free switch into Electric-type moves, particularly the common Thunder Wave and Volt Switch. The Speed boost can also be helpful for cleaning up teams, but this will only come into play if the opponent is significantly weakened. While it might seem weird to suggest Life Orb over Expert Belt when Electivire's main draw is its coverage, Life Orb gives Wild Charge a notable boost against neutral targets. However, an Expert Belt gives Electivire more survivability and Electivire often hits most of its targets for super effective damage. Electivire has two other usable STAB moves in Thunderbolt and Thunder Punch, but they both are much weaker than Wild Charge. Regardless, Thunderbolt still has a high Base Power and can hit Alomomola and Qwilfish harder, although hitting Slowking's lower Defense tends to be more important, while Thunder Punch's lack of recoil means Electivire won't get worn down as quickly.</p> <p>As mentioned before, without entry hazard support, Electivire struggles to OHKO anything aside from non-defensive Pokemon that are weak to Wild Charge or opponents that are frail. In addition, Electivire forces a lot of switches with its coverage, so entry hazards can wear down the opponent's team as they try to predict around Electivire. As a result, Omastar and Qwilfish make good partners, as both of them can place Spikes (the former also gets Stealth Rock) on the field and attract Electric-type moves to activate Electivire's Motor Drive. Ferroseed also makes a good partner, as it also gets both forms of entry hazards while taking little damage from priority moves and Earthquake, which are often targeted at Electivire. Finally, because Electivire can wear down and possibly KO Pokemon such as Slowking, Rotom, Tangrowth, and Steelix, it can open up the way for a teammate to attack without getting easily walled. Because of this, Kabutops, Druddigon, and Aggron—which all struggle with one or more of the aforementioned Pokemon—make good teammates, as their STAB moves are far more threatening when the opponent lacks a bulky Pokemon that can resist it.</p> "

  "Magmortar": {
    "overview": "<p>Magmortar has long been considered slightly underwhelming; in fact, it was left floundering in NU for the entirety of DPP and the majority of BW. However, Magmortar has found its time to shine in RU. Its excellent base 125 Special Attack and expansive movepool, including Fire Blast, Thunderbolt, Focus Blast, and a variety of Hidden Powers, are but a few of the primary reasons for its rise to stardom. Magmortar also boasts a solid base 95 Attack stat that, in conjunction with access to Cross Chop and Earthquake, enables it to blow straight past special walls, such as Clefable and Lanturn. Although Magmortar might not be particularly fast, that odd base 83 Speed grants it the opportunity to outspeed the myriad of Pokemon sitting at and around base 80 Speed, such as Medicham, Gallade, and Hitmonchan. On top of this, Magmortar appears to be perfectly suited to the RU metagame. The tier's premier special wall, Slowking, would usually be a full stop to any special attacking Fire-type, but Magmortar has no problem disposing of it with repeated Thunderbolt and entry hazard damage. The icing on the cake is that Magmortar can bypass one of the most common status conditions to be inflicted in RU: sleep. Tangrowth and Lilligant are extremely popular Pokemon that Magmortar can switch into and eliminate with impunity thanks to Vital Spirit; Magmortar can also deal with the odd Smeargle lead by absorbing Spore and limiting the number of layers it gets up to a maximum of two.</p> <p>By now you're probably wondering why on earth Magmortar isn't used on every single RU team. Well, unfortunately for our fiery friend there are a couple of things halting its climb to number 1 on the usage ladder. A couple of sharp, pointy things. Yes, Magmortar despises entry hazards as it is susceptible to all three. To compound this weakness, due to its decidedly average defenses, Magmortar has trouble finding good opportunities where it can switch in. The metaphorical nail in the coffin comes from Magmortar's mediocre defensive typing, which leaves it with weaknesses to Ground-, Rock-, and Water-type attacks, as well as its below average Speed. However, don't let these downsides put you off. Magmortar's merits far outweigh its flaws and it is one of RU's premier Fire-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thanks to its expansive movepool and good attacking stats, Magmortar can run a wide variety of sets (with varying degrees of success). With Choice Specs equipped, Magmortar's attacks become incredibly powerful, and Magmortar is now able to 2HKO Slowking 100% of the time with Thunderbolt. On the other hand, a Choice Scarf gives Magmortar enough Speed to outrun the entire unboosted tier, as well as land surprise KOs on opponents expecting a more conventional Expert Belt set. However, both of these sets are held back due to Magmortar's inability to switch moves, its low defenses, and its weakness to entry hazards. Magmortar also has a large, though oft-neglected, physical movepool. With Flare Blitz for STAB, along with Earthquake, Cross Chop, Mach Punch, and Thunder Punch for coverage, Magmortar can surprise a lot of its usual counters, as well as handily deal with Fire-types. Magmortar also has Belly Drum to boost its Attack to astronomical levels. As cool as physical Magmortar sounds, its only average Attack and low Speed hold it back. Magmortar has an ample selection of alternative STAB moves to choose from. Overheat has incredible power and is more accurate than Fire Blast, Lava Plume can spread burns to make up for Magmortar's low Defense, and Flamethrower is slightly less powerful than Fire Blast, but it is much more reliable. Taunt enables Magmortar to easily take out defensive Grass-types, such as Roselia and Tangrowth, whereas Will-O-Wisp can spread status. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, although the loss in coverage is quite severe and the loss of health can severely reduce Magmortar's lifespan. Finally, Magmortar can use Cross Chop to hit special walls hard, although most are hit hard enough by Magmortar's standard moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to its great power and coverage, Magmortar doesn't have many counters in the strictest sense of the word; few walls can afford to take two hits (one on the switch in, another as they move second) from the most effective move. Slowking is 2HKOed by Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock and Lanturn is 2HKOed by Hidden Power Grass. On top of this, there aren't many Pokemon faster than Magmortar that can take a super effective attack or a neutral Fire Blast. The best way to stop Magmortar cold, however, is to go by that old saying: \"fight fire with fire\". Not only does Flareon boast good special bulk, it also lacks a weakness to any of Magmortar's common attacks, while resisting two of them. Furthermore, Flareon can recover and support the team with Wish and Protect, as well as Toxic stall Magmortar. Flareon can also choose to phaze Magmortar out with Roar, which is especially potent when paired with entry hazards. Camerupt is also an excellent counter to Magmortar as it resists Fire Blast, is immune to Thunderbolt, and takes little from a neutral Hidden Power Grass. However, due to its relatively low defenses, Camerupt doesn't enjoy taking too many Focus Blasts. RU's resident Dragon-types, Druddigon and Altaria, stick out as two of Magmortar's most solid counters. Druddigon resists all of Magmortar's moves bar Cross Chop and can OHKO it with Outrage, whereas Altaria is much more defensive and can set up on Magmortar thanks to its good bulk. However, both of the aforementioned Dragons are easily taken care of by Hidden Power Ice. As long as Lanturn doesn't switch into it, Lanturn can take at least one hit from Hidden Power Grass and hit back with a STAB Scald or Surf. When it comes to revenge killing Magmortar, any faster Pokemon that carries a super effective move, such as Archeops, Aerodactyl, or Sceptile, will get the job done easily. One of the easiest ways of limiting Magmortar's effectiveness isn't by carrying a dedicated counter, but by ensuring that you get as many hazards up as soon as possible. Magmortar can lose over half its health just by switching in should it have the misfortune of landing on a complete set of entry hazards. On top of this, Life Orb Magmortar has to deal with recoil wearing it down each time it attacks. In addition, 83 base Speed is quite slow compared to the rest of the tier, so most offensive teams won't have much trouble against Magmortar. As long as you use clever switching and constantly force Magmortar out, it shouldn't be able to harm your team a great deal.</p> ",

        "name": "Wallbreaker",
        "description": "<p>Equipped with its excellent coverage and high powered moves, Magmortar has no trouble blasting past RU's most common walls; Steelix, Tangrowth, Sandslash, Roselia, Rhydon, and Qwilfish are all OHKOed after Stealth Rock. Even RU's premier special walls can't avoid a 2HKO from Magmortar; Clefable is easily 2HKO'd by Focus Blast while Slowking is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage. Although Magmortar's average Speed stops it from pulling off a sweep alone, its great offensive presence and movepool ensure that RU's walls will never be safe with Magmortar waiting in the wings. Fire Blast provides Magmortar with an immensely powerful STAB attack and inflicts huge amounts of damage to anything that doesn't resist it. It is Magmortar's most spammable attack, and is what you should be using early-game when scouting the opponent's team. Not only does Thunderbolt give Magmortar coverage against Water- and Flying-types, but it also enables it to get past Slowking, a Pokemon capable of walling most special attackers (especially Fire-types). Having Focus Blast ensures that one of RU's sturdiest special walls, Clefable cant't stop Magmortar's rampage in its tracks, although its accuracy can sometimes be a let down. Hidden Power Grass rounds out the set's coverage by getting OHKOs against Rhydon and Quagsire, as well as a 2HKO against Lanturn.</p> <p>The given EVs ensure that Magmortar outspeeds all neutral-natured Pokemon with base 80 Speed, as well as maximizing its damage output. A super effective attack coming from a Modest nature and an Expert Belt hits harder than the equivalent of a Timid nature and a Life Orb, and is therefore the first choice for both item and nature. On top of this, Magmortar will often be hitting the enemy super effectively thanks to its great coverage, and therefore it doesn't really miss the Life Orb boost. Finally, and most importantly, using an Expert Belt stops Magmortar from being worn down so easily by stall teams that attempt to stall it out with Life Orb recoil. Entry hazards, status, and recoil all take a serious toll on Magmortar's health, so by limiting one of those, Magmortar will be able to stay alive and wreak havoc for a longer period of time.</p> <p>By running a positive Speed nature, Magmortar ensures that it can outspeed every Pokemon hovering around the 80 Speed mark. A Life Orb gives a strong boost to Magmortar's attacks and is especially useful when you need to hit certain Pokemon, such as Aggron, Druddigon, and Altaria, for as much damage as possible with neutral attacks. Vital Spirit is key to Magmortar's success. It gives Magmortar the switch-in opportunities it needs to do damage; Smeargle, Tangrowth, and Lilligant are all easy Pokemon for Magmortar to take advantage of. Hidden Power Ice hurts Altaria and Druddigon, two of Magmortar's best counters, more than any other of its attacks. Hidden Power Ice also stops Magmortar from having to rely on Focus Blast's shaky inaccuracy to harm Druddigon. Earthquake hits other Fire-types, such as Entei, Typhlosion, Flareon, and Camerupt, harder than any other attack, and will OHKO the less defensive of those Pokemon. Flamethrower can be used as a more reliable alternative to Fire Blast, although the loss in power is very noticeable.</p> <p>Magmortar absolutely despises entry hazards, so packing a spinner is almost a necessity. Sandslash makes for a great teammate as it resists Rock-type moves and can set up Stealth Rock to wear down Magmortar's counters. Cryogonal, on the other hand, is immune to Ground-type moves thanks to Levitate, and takes little from most Water attacks thanks to its excellent base 135 Special Defense. Roselia and Ferroseed both share good defensive synergy with Magmortar and can set up the hazards that are essential in helping Magmortar achieve those KOs. Ferroseed can also spread paralysis with Thunder Wave in order to bypass Magmortar's average Speed. Feraligatr partners well with Magmortar as it can set up on and take out the Fire-types that give Magmortar trouble. In return, Magmortar easily dispatches the Grass-types that try to put a stop to Feraligatr's sweep.</p> "

  "Rotom": {
    "overview": "<p>Unlike its appliance counterparts, Rotom doesn't have access to any special moves and it remains a Ghost-type. Rotom's defenses and Special Attack are also lower than that of the appliances. Rotom's Ghost typing is a blessing in disguise, as not only does it grant Rotom an immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type moves, but it also renders Rapid Spin's effect useless. In place of its lower defenses and Special Attack, Rotom has higher Speed, allowing it to outrun faster threats, such as positive Speed natured Moltres. Rotom's support movepool isn't too shabby either; a combination of Trick, Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and Volt Switch can royally screw the opponent while aiding Rotom's teammates in sweeping. Rotom is unpredictable, and if you're not prepared for it, you'll be in for a shock.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom is a versatile little spark, and there are a variety of specialized movesets it can run. Rotom can make use of Rain Dance and SubCharge sets, but they're hard to pull off and don't use Rotom to the best of its abilities. A RestTalk set can be used instead of having to rely on Pain Split for recovery, but this generation's sleep mechanics make it unreliable. Charge is an effective way to raise the power of Rotom's Electric-type STAB, but unlike Charge Beam, it doesn't deal damage. Spite can be used alongside Substitute and Pain Split to drain an opponent's PP, but it's not very effective as Rotom doesn't have Pressure as its ability. Rotom can support its teammates with Sunny Day, but it doesn't benefit from it in any way. Thunder Wave can be used with a defensive EV spread to cripple fast threats, and it works wonders in tandem with Substitute. Finally, Rotom can support its team with dual screens, but this is largely outclassed by its other sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In terms of counters, almost anything with a good Special Defense stat can take on Rotom. Clefable is the most notorious special wall in the tier; thanks to its Normal typing and Magic Guard, Clefable is immune to Shadow Ball and Will-O-Wisp, respectively, so the only move it has to worry about is Trick. Steelix is immune to Electric-type attacks and resists Shadow Ball, though Will-O-Wisp and Trick will cause it problems. Ferroseed resists Shadow Ball and Electric-type moves, and Will-O-Wisp isn't going to stop it from setting up entry hazards. Electivire receives a Motor Drive boost from Electric-type attacks, but unfortunately, it can't do a lot to Rotom in return. Thanks to its great typing, Drapion boasts a resistance to Shadow Ball, takes little damage from Electric-type moves, and can hit Rotom with its STAB Dark-type moves. Sawsbuck is an interesting option, as it has an immunity to Shadow Ball and resists Electric-type moves. Lanturn is a less common counter, but Volt Absorb grants it an immunity to Electric-type moves, and its excellent HP stat means it'll take a pittance from any of Rotom's attacks. Cryogonal and Regice both have massive Special Defense stats, so the best Rotom can do is Trick them a Choice item. Furthermore, Cryogonal has access to Rapid Spin and Recover to support its teammates and keep itself alive, respectively.</p> <p>Most Grass-, Dark-, Normal-, Ground-, and Steel-types can take on Rotom, just predict carefully, as Trick and Will-O-Wisp can be problematic. Sucker Punch users, such as Absol, can switch into Shadow Ball, and threaten to KO Rotom before it can attack. Shadow Sneak Gallade is another fine choice as it has a good Special Defense stat and poses as a decent offensive threat. Spiritomb is a hard stop to most Rotom as it can nail it with any of Shadow Sneak, Sucker Punch, and Pursuit. Calm Mind and RestTalk sets also wall Rotom pretty well but must be wary of Trick. Finally, revenge killing Rotom is a last resort, but if one of your Pokemon has a decently powered attack and enough Speed, it shouldn't be a difficult task.</p> ",

        "name": "Substitute + Pain Split",
        "description": "<p>The idea behind this set is fairly simple: use a combination of Substitute and Pain Split to weaken the opponent into KO range, then finish them off with one of Rotom's STAB moves. Rotom acts as an effective wallbreaker, as it can weaken the opponent with Pain Split, and should the opponent decide to use a recovery move, Rotom can restore even more of its HP. Instead of outright attacking, Rotom relies on setting up Substitutes and wearing down the opponent slowly and painfully. Good prediction is key, especially if Rotom is slower than the opponent. Shadow Ball and Thunderbolt provide excellent type coverage against everything in the tier bar Magneton, Ferroseed, Sawsbuck, and Steelix, and they both receive a boost from STAB.</p> <p>The EVs are pretty self-explanatory; a Timid nature and maximum Speed investment allow Rotom to outspeed positive-natured base 90 Pokemon, such as Moltres. In truth, only 248 Speed EVs are needed to outrun said Moltres, but generally, adding an extra stat point to anything else won't make a huge difference. Will-O-Wisp can be used over one of Rotom's coverage moves, but doing so will leave it walled by either Ground- or Normal-types. A more defensive spread of 252 HP / 8 Def / 248 Spe should be used with Will-O-Wisp, along with Leftovers for extra survivability.</p> <p>Thanks to this set's ability to force switches, support from entry hazards is greatly appreciated. Ferroseed can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, while crippling faster threats with Thunder Wave. Scolipede and Roselia can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes for your team, and they can break through Grass-types that slow Rotom down. Uxie and Druddigon can set up Stealth Rock, and they both have access to some useful support moves. Rotom's Ghost typing means that entry hazards will remain on the field for as long as possible, and Thunderbolt will deal a number on Kabutops, a common Rapid Spinner.</p> <p>Partners that can switch into Rotom's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses are essential to keeping it alive. Ferroseed can switch into both of Rotom's weaknesses and proceed to set up entry hazards, and Drapion can switch in and fire off powerful attacks. Thanks to their high Special Attack and Speed stats, special attackers, such as Moltres, can pull off a final sweep of a weakened team.</p> "

Thanks to Volt Switch, Rotom is very difficult to KO, especially since it avoids taking a boosted Pursuit if the opponent is faster than Rotom. Furthermore, Rotom is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, giving it an easier time switching in to wreak havoc. Shadow Ball provides Rotom with a secondary STAB move, and its type coverage is excellent in combination with Volt Switch. Thunderbolt is used as a powerful, consistent STAB move that doesn't force Rotom to switch out, whereas Hidden Power Ice is used to hit Ground- and Grass-types super effectively. The idea is to abuse Volt Switch to scout the opponent's Rotom switch-in, and proceed to weaken the opponent with a combination of passive damage and powerful moves. Sucker Punch is a problem for this set, and Trick is the only option to avoid it if you encounter it.</p> <p>A Timid nature should be used on this set so that Rotom can outspeed and revenge kill Timid Omastar after a Shell Smash and Jolly Choice Scarf Medicham. Choice Specs can be used with a Modest nature, but this makes Rotom significantly slower, and leaves it prone to being revenge killed. A Timid nature can be used with Choice Specs for the best of power and Speed, whereas the combination of a Timid nature and a Choice Scarf enables Rotom to outrun even boosted sweepers, such as Shell Smash Crustle and Gorebyss. Hidden Power Fighting can be used in the third slot, as it provides perfect neutral type coverage alongside Shadow Ball. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the last slot as well to fake out the opponent and bluff a bulky set or cripple a dangerous physical sweeper.</p> <p>This set forces a lot of switches, so entry hazard support is something to consider. Ferroseed can set up Spikes and Stealth Rock, Clefable and Uxie can set up Stealth Rock, and Scolipede can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Rotom's Ghost typing help keep hazards on the field, and its useful resistances grant it an easier switch in. Throh and Hariyama are also good partners as they can take out specially defensive Pokemon, such as Clefable. Furthermore, Guts Hariyama can switch into status moves and receive an Attack boost. Clefable and Ferroseed are common switch-ins, making Fighting-type moves favorable. Again, Hariyama can abuse STAB Close Combat.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Although Rotom is usually seen shocking its opponents with its great Speed and Special Attack and mediocre defensive stats, it can also pull off a decent defensive set thanks to its great resistances and access to Pain Split. These attributes allow Rotom to function as a check to many top-tier attackers, including the extraordinarily powerful Escavalier. Rotom's resistance to both Iron Head and Megahorn means it can wall and stall as much as it wants. Rotom's Ghost typing allows it to function as a spinblocker, and a pretty good one at that. Rotom is the only Ghost-type that can reliably beat Kabutops, which most Ghost-types in the tier struggle to defeat. Furthermore, many players will be taken by surprise by Will-O-Wisp, as more offensive sets have no room for it. However, one should keep in mind that Rotom's defenses are not impregnable, so it's best used on a balanced team.</p> <p>Thunderbolt and Shadow Ball provide excellent coverage--hitting most common Pokemon neutrally. Rotom's dual STAB enables it to hit every common spinner and deal with threats such as Gallade, Tauros, and Absol, even without investment. Pain Split keeps Rotom in top shape throughout the match, and is an excellent tool to wear down opposing Pokemon when Rotom has low health. Pain Split also helps Rotom survive when taking Megahorns from Escavalier. Will-O-Wisp is Rotom's greatest weapon against physical attackers and makes this set much more threatening. It also provides constant residual damage to help Rotom KO foes with greater ease.</p> <p>The Speed EVs given allow Rotom to outrun Adamant Kabutops and Braviary; this helps Rotom switch in and KO them the following turn with Thunderbolt. Choice Band Braviary's Brave Bird will 2HKO Rotom after Stealth Rock damage, but with the given EVs Rotom can outspeed and KO it. Jolly variants fail to 2HKO Rotom, making more Speed investment unnecessary. The remaining EVs maximize Rotom's physical bulk, capitalizing on Defense rather than HP as it allows Rotom to recover a higher percentage from Pain Split.</p> <p>Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt for its higher paralysis rate, but the additional power that Thunderbolt provides is invaluable. Furthermore, the chance of paralysis may conflict with your plans to burn a strong physical attacker. The RestTalk combination can be used over Pain Split and Will-O-Wisp to heal off any status that Rotom may be afflicted with, most notably Toxic; however, Will-O-Wisp is absolutely vital to this set, providing residual damage and making physical attackers much less threatening. Even Pain Split plays a vital role in wearing down opponents--not to mention that Sleep Talk is unreliable, with a 33% chance of picking Rest and doing nothing. In addition to all this, BW's sleep mechanics make RestTalk an even less viable option. However, if you really don't want Rotom statused and cannot provide cleric support, RestTalk is your best possible option.</p> <p>Unlike other Rotom variants, this set requires different types of support. It appreciates entry hazards to wear down opponents, and thanks to its Ghost typing, can keep them up easily. Crustle, Smeargle, Accelgor, Ferroseed, Scolipede, and Roselia are all excellent choices for the job. Cleric support is also recommended as Toxic can spell doom for Rotom, making it unable to stay in for very long and tank hits. Clefable is the best choice for this, also providing Wish support for Rotom and its teammates. Although Rotom has its own recovery, Pain Split isn't reliable enough at times because it doesn't do a lot to targets at a low range of health or with a generally low HP stat. Steelix is another wonderful partner as it can switch into Ghost- and Dark-type moves aimed at Rotom and set up Stealth Rock. Mandibuzz also covers Rotom's weaknesses, and in return Rotom can take Megahorn from Escavalier as well as burn Aggron in a pinch.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Despite previously being regarded as a mediocre Pokemon due to its Stealth Rock weakness and inaccurate secondary STAB, Rotom-F's offensive typing is very potent in today's metagame. No doubt, Blizzard's accuracy sucks, but the threat of it connecting when combined with its strong Electric-type STAB moves allows it to be an effective anti-metagame choice. Top metagame threats such as Druddigon, Alomomola, Roselia, Sceptile, Rotom-C, Golurk, Archeops, and Lilligant all cower in fear of Rotom-F's STAB combination, and only Lanturn, Magneton, Thick Fat Piloswine, and the rare Shedinja resist both. Aside from having to rely on Blizzard, Rotom-F's typing is also rather underwhelming defensively, making it hard to get in safely, which puts a damper on its offensive effectiveness. On teams that can keep Stealth Rock off the field and provide good switch-in opportunities for it, Rotom-F can really shine.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set is a viable option if you want Rotom-F to have more power while still being able to scout with Volt Switch, but most of the time you'll usually end up missing the Speed of Choice Scarf or the ability to switch moves that comes with Expert Belt, making it a lesser option. Rotom-F can run a somewhat effective ChestoRest set as well, greatly increasing its longevity, although Rotom-F's mediocre defensive typing often gets in the way of this. Likewise, Rotom-F's decent bulk and access to support moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Pain Split makes a defensive set an option, but once again its mediocre defensive typing gets in the way too much for the set to be effective.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to Rotom-F's excellent dual STAB combination and access to moves such as Trick and Pain Split, finding a foolproof counter to Rotom-F is a difficult task. Lanturn is probably the best answer to Rotom-F, possessing an immunity to Rotom-F's Electric-type moves while taking Blizzard with ease due to its excellent special bulk and resistance to Ice-type attacks, and in return can either paralyze Rotom-F or wear it down with repeated Scalds. Keep in mind, though, that Lanturn has no form of reliable recovery, making it vulnerable to repeated Blizzards. Magneton and Piloswine are in the same boat, taking both of Rotom-F's STAB attacks handily but being prone to being worn down over the course of the match, necessitating careful play to fully counter Rotom-F. Furthermore, both Piloswine and Magneton are vulnerable to Trick, which removes their Eviolite and thus cuts their bulk significantly. Clefable and Lickilicky make decent checks to the Choice Scarf and Expert Belt sets, using their immense special bulk to take both of its STABs without a resistance, but they struggle against the SubSplit set, which can use Substitute to dodge status and slowly sap their HP with Pain Split until they end up in Blizzard's KO range. Cryogonal can check Rotom-F as well, resisting Blizzard and having enough bulk to take repeated Thunderbolts, but struggles to do anything to Rotom-F in return without running a super effective Hidden Power or Toxic. Escavalier resists Rotom-F's Blizzard and has enough bulk to take a Thunderbolt, making it a viable check as well, but it still takes a significant amount from Thunderbolt and Volt Switch and lacks a reliable recovery move, which means it gets worn down quickly. If all else fails, there are a few Pokemon such as Entei, Klinklang, Sceptile, and Emboar that can check Rotom-F, being able to switch in on either Thunderbolt or Blizzard, outspeed Rotom-F, and OHKO it with the appropriate attack, but these Pokemon aren't as reliable as the ones listed above, as they can only safely switch into one of Rotom-F's STABs safely.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "SubSplit",
        "description": "<p>Rotom-F's excellent dual STAB combination makes SubSplit an amazing option on it, taking advantage of its STABs and the combination of Substitute and Pain Split to wear down the opponent's team and do as much damage as possible. Substitute gives Rotom-F protection against status moves, priority, and attacks from faster Pokemon such as Moltres, Sigilyph, and Sceptile while simultaneously easing prediction, making it invaluable. In addition, Rotom-F has ample opportunity to set up a Substitute thanks to its decent bulk and natural ability to force switches. Blizzard is Rotom-F's most powerful attack, at worst 2HKOing anything that doesn't resist Ice-type moves. Thunderbolt is Rotom-F's best secondary STAB attack and complements Blizzard well, hitting Pokemon that can stomach Blizzard with ease, such as Slowking, hard. Blizzard and Thunderbolt have excellent neutral coverage together, only missing out on a few Pokemon such as Lanturn, Magneton, and Piloswine; this is where Pain Split comes into play. While the aforementioned Pokemon can switch into both Blizzard and Thunderbolt, they lack any form of reliable recovery outside of Rest, leaving them vulnerable to being worn down by Pain Split.</p> <p>The given EVs are very simple, maximizing Rotom-F's damage output while making sure it outpaces as many Pokemon as possible. A Modest nature can be used over Timid if you think Rotom-F needs the extra power, but the extra Speed Timid provides is almost always better, making Modest a lesser option. Furthermore, Leftovers can be used over Life Orb if Rotom-F needs some more longevity, but Pain Split is usually enough to keep Rotom-F healthy, and the power difference is rather noticeable.</p> <p>Although almost every other Pokemon appreciates hazards support, entry hazards are especially effective with Rotom-F due to its innate ability to force switches and the fact that the vast majority of Pokemon that can stomach its attacks, such as Lanturn, Magneton, and Piloswine, are grounded, making them really easy to wear down via multiple layers of hazards. Omastar and Qwilfish are excellent choices for this role, as they can reliably set up hazards while checking Pokemon that pose an offensive threat to Rotom-F such as Emboar, Entei, Escavalier, and Durant.</p> <p>Golurk's also a good teammate for Rotom-F, being able to reliably set Stealth Rock while still checking Escavalier and posing an immediate threat to Lanturn and Magneton, two of Rotom-F's best checks. Bulky Water-types such as Slowking, Alomomola, Quagsire, and Poliwrath are excellent teammates for Rotom-F as well, being able to take on multiple Pokemon that threaten Rotom-F such as Entei, Emboar, and Piloswine. Alomomola deserves a special mention because of its ability to pass gigantic Wishes to Rotom-F, completely healing it no matter how much damage it has taken.</p> <p>Rotom-F's weakness to Stealth Rock can wear it down over time if it doesn't get the chance to use Pain Split, meaning Rapid Spin is always appreciated. Kabutops is an excellent option for this role, reliably spinning away Stealth Rock while having good synergy with Rotom-F; it's able to take Fire-type attacks from Entei and Emboar for Rotom-F with ease, while Rotom-F can take out checks to Kabutops such as Tangrowth with Blizzard in return.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Like all of the other Rotom formes, Rotom-F is perfectly capable of running an effective Choice Scarf set, becoming one of the best scouts, revenge killers, and late-game sweepers available. Volt Switch is what separates Rotom-F from other Choice Scarf Ice-types such as Jynx, giving it the ability to switch out while doing a decent amount of damage and easily gaining momentum for its team. Blizzard is Rotom-F's most powerful attack, and what makes Rotom-F the late-game cleaner it is, having more than enough power to muscle through the remains of the opponent's weakened team. Blizzard also hits the vast majority of Electric resists hard, often making switching into Choice Scarf Rotom-F a deadly guessing game. Thunderbolt provides Rotom-F with a much more powerful Electric STAB that doesn't force it to switch out, giving it the capability to clean up even when bulky Blizzard resists such as Slowking are still around. Lastly, Trick gives Rotom-F the ability to cripple almost every defensive Pokemon in the tier by stealing their Leftovers or Eviolite and replacing it with a Choice Scarf. Additionally, Trick also gives Rotom-F a way to get rid of its Choice Scarf when it no longer needs the extra Speed to pose a threat, giving it the ability to switch moves against slower teams and stay in for multiple turns without being locked into an undesirable move.</p> <p>Because of Choice Scarf Rotom-F's innate ability to force switches due to its Choice Scarf-boosted Speed stat, Volt Switch, and excellent dual STABs, entry hazards work exceptionally well with it, forcing the opposing team to take residual damage every time they attempt to check Rotom-F, wearing them down over time and making it infinitely easier for Rotom-F to pull off that final cleanup with Blizzard. Qwilfish is perfect for this role, setting both Spikes and Toxic Spikes for Rotom-F while also taking priority attacks such as Aqua Jet and Extreme Speed that are often aimed at it. Other options for hazard setting include Roselia, Omastar, Golurk, and Druddigon, all of which have their individual merits and further support Rotom-F in different ways. Due to the nature of the set, Rotom-F will be switching in and out quite often, making Rapid Spin support a necessity. Kabutops in particular makes an excellent teammate when it comes to spinning, reliably clearing the field of entry hazards while simultaneously checking Pokemon such as Entei and Emboar that might switch in on Rotom-F while it's locked into Blizzard. In return, Rotom-F can terrorize many of Kabutops's checks such as Lilligant, Sceptile, Tangrowth, and Ferroseed with Blizzard and, in Ferroseed's case, Trick. Cryogonal is a decent option as well, sacrificing some defensive synergy for the ability to batter the Pokemon that might try to switch into Rotom-F's Blizzard with its own Ice Beam, softening them up so Rotom-F can break through them with ease later on. Lastly, Hidden Power Fire and Hidden Power Ground can be used over Trick if you really need Rotom-F to hit threats such as Durant, Escavalier, Typhlosion, Entei, Lanturn, and Aggron harder, but the utility of Trick will be missed.</p> "

        "name": "All-Out Attacker",
        "description": "<p>With excellent super effective coverage between its dual STABs, Rotom-F is capable of using an Expert Belt set to good effect. While Rotom-F is usually seen tearing apart slower, more defensive teams with its SubSplit set or serving as an invaluable scout and revenge killer with its Choice Scarf set, Expert Belt Rotom-F functions as a lure, bluffing Choice Scarf to get surprise KOs on unsuspecting Pokemon. When the opponent doesn't notice any Leftovers recovery or Life Orb recoil on Rotom-F, they'll most likely assume that its holding a Choice item, and switch in various Volt Switch immunities and Blizzard resistances to try to force it out, only to watch in awe as their switch-in gets demolished the next turn by one of Rotom-F's other attacks. Outside of bluffing a Choice Item, Rotom-F still gets the full benefit of using an Expert Belt thanks to its good super effective coverage. Volt Switch allows Rotom-F to gain momentum when needed and deal a decent amount of damage as it switches out. Having a slower Volt Switch than Choice Scarf Rotom-F is a huge help as well, allowing it to take a hit from a faster opponent, then Volt Switch out on the same turn, essentially giving Rotom-F's teammate a free switch. Hidden Power Fire is used to OHKO both Ferroseed and Escavalier after Stealth Rock after luring them in.</p> <p>Expert Belt Rotom-F pairs well with Pokemon that appreciate the removal of the Pokemon that it lures in and KOs, including Escavalier and Slowking. Druddigon's a good example, as the removal of Escavalier from the match allows Druddigon to use Outrage much more freely. In return, Druddigon can pivot into Pokemon such as Entei, Emboar, Lanturn, and Magneton that threaten Rotom-F, possibly wearing the former two down rather quickly via the combination of Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and Flare Blitz recoil. Druddigon can also set up Stealth Rock for Rotom-F's team, wearing down Pokemon without reliable recovery over time and making it easier for Rotom-F to score KOs on Ferroseed and Escavalier with Hidden Power Fire.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Sporting a double immunity to Ground-type moves, a great defensive typing, and above average stats, Rotom-S is definitely a threat to watch out for in RU. A combination of Rotom-S's solid Special Attack and Speed make it a deadly sweeper, while access to Trick, Will-O-Wisp, and Pain Split turn it into a great team supporter. Despite its double immunity to Ground-type moves--even a triple immunity with Air Balloon--Rotom-S does have its weaknesses: losing 25% of its health to Stealth Rock doesn't help it as a sweeper nor supporter, and common weaknesses to Rock and Ice make it much harder to compete. Even without its precious Ghost typing, Rotom-S is a formidable threat, and it shouldn't be taken lightly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-S's movepool isn't very impressive, but there are a few viable options left. Sunny Day or Rain Dance can be used to support its teammates, and Rain Dance pairs nicely with Thunder. A dual screens set is plausible, but there are better users of the strategy. Toxic can be used to wear down its counters, but Will-O-Wisp is usually superior. Discharge can be used over Thunderbolt or Volt Switch if you prefer the higher paralysis rate, but it's slightly weaker and may miss out on KOs. Hidden Power Grass can be used to hit Quagsire super effectively, but it doesn't provide any additional coverage outside of that. Shadow Ball hits Ghost-types harder than any of its other moves, but it provides no extra coverage. Rest and Sleep Talk could work in theory, but its Stealth Rock weakness severely hampers it. Finally, Rotom-S can abuse a paraflinch set with Confuse Ray / Discharge / Air Slash / Pain Split, but it's a bit gimmicky.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Lanturn and Magneton are two of the best counters to Rotom-S; they both resist Rotom-S's STAB and have access to powerful STAB moves of their own. Lightningrod Manectric is another great choice as it gains a boost from Rotom-S's Electric-type attacks and resists Air Slash. Clefable can take on unboosted Rotom-S, but it faces problems with the SubSplit set. Specially defensive Grass-types, such as Ferroseed and Roselia, can wall sets without Air Slash, but they can't do much to Rotom-S in return. Quagsire and Rhydon beat sets without Hidden Power Grass, but neither of them appreciate a burn from Will-O-Wisp. Pokemon with Rock Blast can defeat sets with Substitute; Rhydon, Cinccino, and Crustle are great choices. Altaria can take on most sets without Hidden Power Ice, while Natural Cure and Roost keep it healthy and free from status. Heal Bell users can cure paralysis or a burn, making Miltank, Clefable, and Altaria decent checks. Keeping Stealth Rock on the field will wear down Rotom-S, so Ghost-types, such as Spiritomb, can be used to block Rapid Spin attempts.</p> ",

Although it doesn't have perfect accuracy, Will-O-Wisp is Rotom-S's best utility move, and paired with Pain Split or Substitute, Rotom-S becomes a decent wall. Volt Switch turns Rotom-S into a useful scout, but Thunderbolt can be used if you prefer more power. Air Slash provides reliable STAB and hits Bulk Up Gallade super effectively, whilst Hidden Power Ice gains perfect type coverage alongside its Electric-type STAB.

Electric-types, such as Magneton, wall this set cold, making Clefable, Golurk, and Rhydon great teammates. Electivire can also take on Electric-types and gain a boost from Motor Drive, but requires top-notch prediction to be effective. Hard hitters, such as Entei and Moltres, appreciate the opponent's team being weakened, and make it significantly easier to pull off a final sweep.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-C has always been a curious case. With Rotom-W and Rotom-H locked away in the higher tiers and Rotom-F being a more specialized threat in RU, Rotom-C finds itself stuck in the middle of the Rotom formes. However, this is by no means a bad thing. In a tier littered with powerful Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon, Rotom-C stands out with a great base 105 Special Attack and solid base 86 Speed, making it one of the best Choice Scarf users in RU. This is not all it can do, though; those same offensive stats make Rotom-C one of the most difficult Choice Specs users to switch into. Rotom-C can even put its solid resistances to good use with a solid utility set which takes more advantage of its twin base 107 defenses. All of these sets are further backed by the powerful Leaf Storm and great utility of Volt Switch, the latter of which makes Rotom-C one of the best pivots in the tier for offensive teams. Rotom-C was blessed in the ability department as well, as Levitate gives it a useful immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, as well as Ground-type moves.</p> <p>While it has great STAB options at its disposal, it has very little else to utilize offensively outside of Hidden Power. Rotom-C's strongest move, Leaf Storm, also has a severe drawback, as it cuts Rotom-C's Special Attack by two stages upon use, letting it become setup bait for many boosting sweepers. Rotom-C's typing lends itself to solid resistances, but weaknesses to Fire-, Bug-, and Ice-type moves hold it back defensively when combined with its low base 50 HP. The rise of threats such as Amoonguss and Druddigon have really hurt Rotom-C, as both resist its STAB options and can proceed to threaten it and its teammates with sleep and powerful attacks, respectively. However, do not let these drawbacks fool you into believing that Rotom-C is a bad Pokemon. It's one of the most versatile threats in RU and something that every team needs to prepare for.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Perhaps the easiest set to mold from its other sets is by utilizing the ChestoRest strategy. This can be achieved simply by placing Rest in the last slot of the utility set and switching the item to a Chesto Berry. This gives Rotom-C the ability to fully heal its HP and status once, thus quickly swinging momentum in the mid stages of the match. An Expert Belt set can be used, and it would compose of Volt Switch, Leaf Storm, Thunderbolt, and Hidden Power Fire (or Ice) to lure in and KO threats such as Escavalier, Klinklang, and Druddigon after using a STAB move. Lastly, a Rain Dance support set can be considered, as Rotom-C's typing fits very well into rain teams, giving such teams a solid resistance to Electric- and Grass-type moves.</p> <p>As for individual moves, Rotom-C's offensive movepool is not impressive. Rotom-C's relevant offensive coverage starts and ends with its STABs and Hidden Power. Outside of the Choice Specs set, Hidden Power Ice doesn't have enough power to get through Druddigon's solid bulk fast enough. Signal Beam and Shadow Ball can be used to hit Psychic-types such as Uxie if desired, but they're only hitting about as hard as a neutral Thunderbolt. Any set trying to utilize Substitute is severely hindered by the fact that Leaf Storm cuts Rotom-C's Special Attack by two stages, thus usually forcing it to switch out afterward.</p> <p>Rotom-C's support movepool is actually better. Toxic is a pretty neat looking option to cripple opposing walls, however, Rotom-C tends to attract walls that are immune to poison such as Ferroseed, Clefable, and Amoonguss. Rotom-C has both Thunder Wave and Confuse Ray, which can form a pretty frustrating parafusion set. However, this set lacks the overall reliability of Rotom-C's other sets. With decent Speed and solid defenses, Rotom-C can utilize a dual screens set. Such a set is hampered by the presence of strong Bug-, Fire-, and Ice-type moves, though.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>To attempt to counter Rotom-C, you must first determine what set it's running, as each set typically sets out to do something completely different from the others. That said, Roselia and Amoonguss are decent initial switch-ins to scout a set as the only thing they really fear are Trick and Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Fire. Druddigon is also solid, as it isn't really crippled by Trick. However, it has to be wary of Will-O-Wisp and the rare Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Ice. As ironic as it might sound, Rotom-C can also be a good check to itself due to its resistances to Electric- and Grass-type moves. Outside of these, checks and counters generally vary with each set.</p> <p>The Choice Scarf set gets walled by Amoonguss and Roselia, as even Hidden Power Fire will not break through them while both can threaten Rotom-C with their Poison-type STAB moves. Bulkier Fire-type Pokemon such as Entei and Emboar can stomach an Electric-type move and retaliate with a powerful Flare Blitz, and Entei can even revenge kill a weakened Choice Scarf Rotom-C with Extreme Speed. Without Hidden Power Fire, Ferroseed hard counters the Choice Scarf set, as the best Rotom-C can do to it otherwise is cripple Ferroseed with Trick. Druddigon can also take attacks from the Choice Scarf set with relative ease and it doesn't mind Trick nearly as much as other defensive switch-ins. The Choice Specs set has no true counters, as one correct prediction can seriously dent or KO Rotom-C's check. However, with the boost in power comes a drop in Speed, so revenge killing is much easier. Accelgor, Galvantula, Entei, and Moltres can all revenge kill Rotom-C. The last two can even come in directly to Leaf Storm thanks to their decent bulk and resistance to the move. Choice Scarf users such as Emboar, Braviary, and Medicham can also revenge kill Rotom-C.</p> <p>The utility set doesn't really have \"counters\" in the strictest sense of the word because it simply aims to support its team, but its impact can be lessened by certain Pokemon. Roselia is a full stop to the set as it has Natural Cure to heal status afflictions, a 4x resistance to Leaf Storm, a 2x resistance to Volt Switch and Thunderbolt, and it has the special bulk to stomach Hidden Power Fire if Rotom-C chooses to carry it. Amoonguss and Ferroseed also fare well, but they have to be more careful around Will-O-Wisp as they don't have Natural Cure. Although it's relatively rare in RU, Choice Specs Altaria is a fine offensive response as it has Natural Cure to heal status, a 4x resistance to Leaf Storm, and the special bulk to handle Electric-type moves.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Rotom-C is most commonly seen using a Choice Scarf, and for good reason. It has just about everything you could ever ask for in a Choice Scarf user. It has a great base 105 Special Attack, solid base 86 Speed that lets it outspeed most unboosted threats and even some boosted threats, a good set of resistances to switch in easily, and a momentum grabbing attack in Volt Switch.</p> <p>Volt Switch is what makes this set amazing. Even if it's prepared for, Rotom-C can simply use Volt Switch early on to scout how the opponent intends on playing against it. Leaf Storm is Rotom-C's signature move and it also crushes virtually any Pokemon trying to block Volt Switch, including Rhydon, Golurk, Lanturn, and Manectric. However, you must take caution in utilizing Leaf Storm, as the resulting Special Attack drop will make Rotom-C setup bait for many dangerous sweepers. With Thunderbolt, Rotom-C becomes one of the hardest late-game cleaners to stop in RU, as its combination of Speed and power will be too much for any team that has had its checks and counters weakened or KOed over the course of the match. Despite this, Hidden Power Fire is still a worthy option. With it, Rotom-C gains the ability to effectively revenge kill Sceptile and Durant—both of which are very dangerous attackers in RU—in a moment's notice. Hidden Power Fire also prevents Ferroseed from walling Rotom-C. With Trick, Rotom-C is able to cripple walls such as Ferroseed and Clefable, two Pokemon that prevent Rotom-C from revenge killing its targets. With an important wall crippled by Trick, Rotom-C's teammates will find it much easier to execute their sweeps.</p> <p>A Timid nature is used so Rotom-C is able to outspeed as many threats as possible. Rotom-C can't risk running a Modest nature, as it is then outsped by boosted positive base 80s such as Medicham, Braviary, and Kabutops.</p> <p>Like with any other Choice Scarf user, Rotom-C appreciates entry hazard support. Smeargle, Accelgor, Scolipede, and Qwilfish can all set up various forms of entry hazards. The first three are seen on more offensive teams while Qwilfish is seen on more balanced teams. Qwilfish also has surprisingly good defensive synergy with Rotom-C. After Rotom-C uses Leaf Storm, it is often forced out by Fire-types such as Entei and Emboar, so Qwilfish makes for a solid switch-in to these two threats in particular. Although Volt Switch and Thunderbolt can dent them, a check to Fire-types is still advised so Rotom-C can use Leaf Storm more freely. Slowking, Lanturn, and Poliwrath work as solid partners for the same reason as Qwilfish. Grass-types in general give Rotom-C trouble, as it will be unable to do much of anything to them without Hidden Power Fire. Fire-types such as Entei, Emboar, and Typhlosion may be enemies to Rotom-C, but they are also great partners for it, as they are solid answers to most Grass-types in the tier. The first two can even deal with sleep thanks to Sleep Talk, while Typhlosion has a powerful Choice Specs Eruption that can quickly weaken an opposing team for Rotom-C to clean up. Like with any other Volt Switch user, Rotom-C works well on VoltTurn teams, so Pokemon that can utilize Volt Switch or U-turn, such as Braviary, Manectric, and Mesprit, can all work nicely with Rotom-C.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>When donning a pair of Choice Specs, Rotom-C becomes one of the tier's most powerful wallbreakers. This Rotom-C is particularly effective against more balanced teams thanks to its immediate power, solid resistances, and good Speed.</p> <p>Rotom-C seems outclassed by the likes of Typhlosion and Slowking, but it has one major move over them: Volt Switch. With a Choice Specs boost, Volt Switch hits much harder than you might originally think, and can give many opponents quite the surprise. Leaf Storm is just brutal on this set; virtually anything without a resistance to the move is 2HKOed at worst. Even some Pokemon that resist the move can be dealt with after Stealth Rock. Sceptile and Tangrowth are 2HKOed with Stealth Rock support alone while Galvantula gets OHKOed under the same conditions. Furthermore, Leaf Storm still hits relatively hard after the Special Attack drop on this set. That said, bulkier setup sweepers such as Gallade can still effectively set up after the Special Attack drop from Leaf Storm. Thunderbolt is preferred in the third slot to give Rotom-C a reliable STAB option to use as it has no drawbacks. Assuming a Modest nature, it also OHKOes Entei and Typhlosion and has an 87.5% chance to OHKO 4/0 Emboar after Stealth Rock. In spite of this, Hidden Power Fire is a viable option on this set. With the power boost from Choice Specs, Hidden Power Fire allows Rotom-C to run through the likes of Escavalier, Steelix, and Ferroseed. In the last slot, Trick is the main option as it lets Rotom-C cripple various walls for the remainder of the match. However, if you want both Thunderbolt and Hidden Power Fire, Trick can be eschewed to get the best of both worlds.</p> <p>As Choice Specs Rotom-C relies more on its power rather than its Speed, 208 Speed EVs are used to get the jump on base 80 Speed Pokemon. The remaining 48 HP EVs improve Rotom-C's overall bulk. The nature choice is also a fairly tough one, as both have their merits. With a Modest nature, Rotom-C gets a sizable power boost that lets it break down most Fire-types with Stealth Rock support alone, cutting down on its dependency on its teammates to help it with them. However, because Kabutops, Mesprit, and Braviary sometimes use positive Speed natures, Timid can be used to ensure Rotom-C outspeeds all unboosted variants of these Pokemon. The only other move to really even consider on this set is Hidden Power Ice, as it is the only move Rotom-C has that actually does any sort of decent damage to Druddigon, scoring a 2HKO with the boost from Choice Specs.</p> <p>This Rotom-C really appreciates entry hazard support to maximize its wallbreaking potential. With Stealth Rock alone, Rotom-C is able to seriously dent or outright KO most Fire-types with Thunderbolt. Pokemon such as Smeargle, Druddigon, and Uxie can set up Stealth Rock with relative ease. Spikes support is also welcomed, as most of Rotom-C's checks are grounded. Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Scolipede are all fine options for such support. Steel-types such as Steelix and Klinklang are solid teammates for checking Druddigon. The former can set up Stealth Rock while the latter can take advantage of fallen Water- and Fire-types and prepare a sweep with Shift Gear. As Choice Specs Rotom-C really doesn't have any \"counters\" in the strictest sense of the word, good offensive teammates are generally those who can capitalize on the Pokemon Rotom-C defeats. Choice Scarf Emboar is a prime example of this. It can check most Grass-types that switch into Rotom-C's STAB moves and it will have a much easier time cleaning up with Flare Blitz once Rotom-C weakens or KOes the opponent's Water- and Fire-types. Omastar, offensive Accelgor, and Entei are other examples that have an easier time sweeping or cleaning when Water- and Fire-types are removed.</p> "

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<p>While Rotom-C is one of the best Choice item users in RU, one shouldn't forget its useful resistances to Electric-, Water-, and Grass-type moves. With this set, Rotom-C has more flexibility in its play, as it can check many top threats such as Slowking and Sceptile while still posing as a legitimate offensive threat, as it still has the same power as the Choice Scarf set. Rotom-C's STABs really shine here, as they hit many common physical attackers in RU for super effective damage.</p> <p>Will-O-Wisp is Rotom-C's status move of choice on this set. The resulting burn cripples many physical attackers; Druddigon, Gallade, and Escavalier are just a few of the Pokemon shut down by a burn. However, be aware that most offensive variants of Gallade do run a Lum Berry. If slowing down the opposing team is more beneficial to its team, Rotom-C can opt to use Thunder Wave as its status move. This allows it to cripple physical and special attackers alike. Volt Switch is preferred in the next slot as it retains Rotom-C's overall utility and scouting abilities. If power is desired over general utility, Thunderbolt can be used over Volt Switch to give Rotom-C a way to go on the offensive without being forced to lower its Special Attack. Leaf Storm is an absolute must in the third slot, as it lets Rotom-C directly deal with the likes of Golurk and Rhydon without having to resort to burning them. Thanks to its ability to switch moves, Rotom-C can use Leaf Storm much more freely than either of the Choice sets, as it can Volt Switch out after using Leaf Storm. In the final slot, Rotom-C can use either Pain Split or Hidden Power Fire. Although it's fairly unreliable, Pain Split is Rotom-C's only means of recovery outside of Rest. Hidden Power Fire provides Rotom-C with a means of damaging Grass-types such as Sceptile, Ferroseed, and opposing Rotom-C.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Rotom-C to outspeed all positive base 80s. However, if the extra Speed isn't needed, Rotom-C can choose to invest more in its bulk. An alternate spread of 168 HP / 252 SpA / 88 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to gain more bulk to take hits with while still outspeeding the likes of Omastar and Bouffalant. However, the inability to outspeed Gallade and Kabutops hurts Rotom-C's ability to keep them in check.</p> <p>This Rotom-C really appreciates teammates that can handle Fire-types, as all of them can come in for free on Will-O-Wisp and resist Leaf Storm. Qwilfish, Rhydon, and Slowking can check Fire-types and support Rotom-C in various ways. Most Grass-types can switch into Rotom-C with relative ease, although Thunder Wave and Hidden Power Fire can catch them by surprise. Still, a check to them will ease the pressure on Rotom-C. Fire-types such as Emboar, Moltres, and Entei can handle most Grass-types. Alternatively, you can turn to Sap Sipper Pokemon such as Bouffalant and Miltank to handle opposing Grass-types. Wish support can help Rotom-C stay around longer as Pain Split is far from reliable. Alomomola is perfect for this, as it's one of the best checks to Entei and Emboar in RU and it also possesses the largest Wish in the tier. Although this set is more supportive, entry hazard support is still appreciated. Rhydon, Druddigon, and Qwilfish are all capable of providing such support and checking various Fire-types for Rotom-C. Druddigon can even check various Grass-types.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Uxie is one of the most incredible Pokemon in the RU tier. It has access to an astounding array of support moves, including but not limited to: Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, Yawn, Rain Dance, Reflect, and Light Screen. These options make it a top choice for many teams. In addition, due to its singular Psychic typing and Levitate, Uxie has quite a few useful resistances, not to mention an immunity to the commonly used Ground-type attacks. However, what really sets Uxie apart from the many other support Pokemon in RU is its amazing stat spread. With incredible 75/130/130 defenses coupled with its nifty base 95 Speed and passable offenses, Uxie has several tricks up its sleeves. U-turn and Memento can allow it to serve well on offensive teams that need the momentum it builds, while Uxie's access to Calm Mind and its sturdy bulk can allow it to even play offensive sets with ease. However, despite its many strengths, Uxie does suffer from a few shortcomings. Its offenses are somewhat lackluster prior to setup, and it's often easy to set up hazards, or powerful sweepers that Uxie has trouble damaging. Despite this, Uxie is one of the most versatile Pokemon in the tier, and fits solidly on many teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Uxie has quite the spectacular movepool. In terms of support options, it has access to Safeguard and Heal Bell, the former preventing harmful status inflictions, and the latter removing them. Uxie also has access to Magic Coat, which can help it in rather lopsided lead match-ups, such as against Smeargle and Aerodactyl, while also scoring some surprise advantages when an opponent's Mandibuzz attempts to hit Uxie with Toxic or Lilligant tries to hit it with Sleep Powder. Finally, Amnesia, though gimmicky, can make Uxie nearly invulnerable on the special side. Finally, although it lacks any sort of reliable recovery, Uxie has access to both Rest and Sleep Talk, which can allow it to use its awe inspiring bulk and cleanly wall a number of common RU Pokemon.</p> <p>Uxie also has a number of decent offensive options available to it as well. Thanks to its decent Speed, it can pull off offensive Calm Mind sets relatively well, although it's generally outclassed by Pokemon with higher Special Attack, such as Gardevoir and Mesprit. In addition, Uxie is capable of using Choice Band and Choice Specs movesets decently, although again, it's outclassed by Mesprit. Finally, Uxie really does have a stellar offensive movepool, with access to Shadow Ball, Charge Beam, Grass Knot, and Signal Beam, although generally none of them are all that useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to its astounding versatility, Uxie can be relatively difficult to counter; however, there are a couple of Pokemon that handle it well in nearly any given situation. Fast Taunt users such as Aerodactyl and some Qwilfish can shut down the majority of Uxie's moveset early on, although they must be wary of Thunderbolt and Psychic, respectively. In addition, many Dark-types, such as Skuntank, Drapion, and Spiritomb really have nothing to fear from Uxie, regardless of its set, and can switch-in easily and threaten to KO with their STAB moves. Powerful Ghost-types such as Spiritomb and Rotom are also capable of ripping away a chunk of Uxie's HP without much trouble, although Thunder Wave and Toxic can hurt. Strong Bug-types, such as Scyther, Escavalier, and Scolipede are also capable of ripping Uxie to shreds with powerful STAB U-turns and Megahorns. Finally, at the end of the day, it's easy enough to break through Uxie simply by abusing its lack of reliable recovery and pummeling it with high powered attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Standard Support",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its excellent movepool and defensive bulk, Uxie is capable of playing a supporting role quite handily on many teams. It serves as an excellent catch-all check to a number of dangerous sweepers, and is generally capable of letting its user set the pace of the match in their favor. Stealth Rock is arguably the single best move in the game, and RU has a rather limited number of viable Stealth Rock setters, thus it's usually present on nearly every defensive Uxie moveset. Psychic gives Uxie some offensive presence, allowing it to dissuade Pokemon such as Roselia and Qwilfish from laying hazards against it with impunity. Thunder Wave is capable of preventing Pokemon such as Shell Smash Omastar and the like from setting up against Uxie, whereas Yawn forces switches with ease and prevents setup to a small extent. Thunder Wave has greater mid-game utility, however, as it allows Uxie to cripple dangerous sweepers such as Lilligant and Sceptile. Finally, U-turn rounds off the set very well, giving Uxie an out against Pursuit users such as Choice Band Spiritomb and Absol, which would otherwise trap and easily rip Uxie apart. U-turn also allows Uxie to bring in sweepers for free and build momentum.</p> <p>With the listed EVs, Uxie has enough speed to outrun max Speed Jolly Emboar while max HP gives it a decent amount of bulk. The remaining EVs are pumped into physical defense, to allow Uxie to sponge hits from Pokemon such as Druddigon, Aggron, and Feraligatr. If Absol is not a significant problem, Uxie can opt to run a bulkier spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe, allowing it to outrun max Speed base 55s, while also letting it take significantly stronger hits without much trouble. If one's team has trouble handling specially oriented threats, Uxie can opt to run a spread of 252 HP / 240 SpD / 16 Spe, allowing it to better combat Pokemon such as Magmortar. Uxie can also utilize max Speed, letting it tie with base 95s and paralyze anything slower. Finally, Uxie can opt to run offensive spreads, taking full advantage of Psychic's ability to KO standard Qwilfish and 2HKO some Roselia with minimal Special Attack investment. Defensive spreads are usually better tailored to Uxie's strengths, however.</p> <p>As mentioned, Uxie possesses quite the spectacular support movepool. Memento can be used over U-turn to allow Uxie to build greater momentum and set up for incoming sweepers, but it is generally inferior to U-turn when using a purely defensive set as it forces Uxie to play more recklessly early in the game. Heal Bell can be a useful option over any move, as it provides key support for many offensive teams, but if used over Psychic, Uxie suffers against Taunt users, and if used over any of Uxie's supporting moves, Uxie loses out on either the ability to set up hazards or halt sweepers. Knock Off can be used over any of Uxie's moves as well, allowing it to cripple many defensive Pokemon that rely heavily on Leftovers, as well as those that rely on Eviolite. Finally, Uxie possesses a few offensive options that can be used over any of its moves, such as Giga Drain and Thunderbolt, although due to Uxie's somewhat lackluster offenses, they aren't particularly powerful.</p> <p>Thanks to its incredible versatility, Uxie can fit easily into a number of teams. Offensive teams that struggle if the opponent sets up a sweeper can house Uxie perfectly, thanks to its access to Stealth Rock, U-turn, and Thunder Wave, while defensive teams offer Uxie Wish support to further increase its longevity, while also taking advantage of its ability to check the vast majority of common RU threats. As stated, Uxie appreciates Wish support, and notable Wish users that partner well with it include Clefable, Alomomola, and Flareon. In addition, Uxie suffers heavily against strong Bug- and Dark-types, thus making fast and strong Fighting-types such as Hitmonchan and Hariyama excellent partners for it. Uxie also pairs well with Ghost-type resisters, such as Aggron and Klinklang. However, due to its unique blend of stats and its stellar movepool, Uxie can find its home on any number of teams with relative ease.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>Even though Uxie is normally used for defensive roles, more offensively oriented Calm Mind sets are capable of catching many of Uxie's common switch-ins off guard, as Pokemon such as Absol and Spiritomb that expect to switch in against Uxie for free will find themselves taking hefty hits. Substitute and Calm Mind form the crux of the set, allowing Uxie to set up without fear against Pokemon such as Slowking and Clefable; Pokemon that would be able to hit it with Toxic if Uxie lacked Substitute, or break its Substitutes without Calm Mind boosts. Psychic or Psyshock should be used as Uxie's obligatory STAB move, with each having its own advantages. Psychic hits harder against the majority of the tier, helping Uxie handle Rotom, Amoonguss, and Qwilfish with relative ease, while also letting it dent Steelix. Psyshock, on the other hand, allows Uxie to win Calm Mind wars and beat through Cryogonal, who would otherwise Haze away its boosts. Finally, Thunderbolt is the best option for Uxie's final moveslot, hitting Moltres and Slowking hard, while also letting Uxie dent Absol, Drapion, and Spiritomb.</p> <p>Uxie's EV spread allows it to outspeed standard Rotom-A and either set up against it or outright KO it with Psychic. 96 HP EVs are used in order to allow Uxie to switch in against Life Orb Moltres's Fire Blast and set up a Calm Mind while surviving, then letting it proceed to KO with Thunderbolt. Finally, the remaining EVs are pumped into Uxie's Special Attack in order to give its hits a little more power behind them. Uxie can also opt to use max Speed, with a spread of 96 HP / 160 SpA / 252 Spe, allowing it to tie with Drapion, potentially enabling a late-game sweep. Uxie also has a number of solid move options that can be used over Thunderbolt. Giga Drain can provide Uxie with a little bit of extra HP in a pinch, but is generally useless against a number of common Uxie checks. Hidden Power Fire or Hidden Power Fighting can also be used over Thunderbolt, the former demolishing Ferroseed, while the latter hits Absol and Crawdaunt super effectively, although it leaves Uxie open to Mandibuzz and Spiritomb. Generally though, Thunderbolt is simply the best option for Uxie's coverage moveslot.</p> <p>In order to be effective, Substitute + Calm Mind Uxie requires quite a bit of support. Entry hazards are helpful in wearing down Pokemon such as Spiritomb and Steelix, which can be difficult for Uxie to break through. In addition, Uxie appreciates having teammates who resist its weaknesses, most notably Dark- and Ghost-types, as those are two relatively common offensive types in RU. Bulky Fighting-types, such as Hitmonchan and Poliwrath are capable of taking nearly all of the Dark-type moves aimed at Uxie, while bulky Steel-types handle the Ghosts. Magneton is an excellent choice in this respect, as in addition to resisting many of Uxie's weaknesses, it also traps Steelix, which Uxie has trouble breaking through. Finally, Uxie really appreciates Wish support, as Substitute can wear down its HP remarkably quickly. Notable Wish supporters include Clefable and Alomomola.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its incredible stat distribution and access to momentum building moves such as U-turn and Memento, as well as the ability to set up Reflect and Light Screen against nearly every Pokemon in RU, Uxie is one of the most efficient dual screen users in the tier. Uxie is capable of providing all of the most dangerous sweepers in RU with the ability to set up with little trouble, while also setting the pace of the match in favor of its user. Reflect and Light Screen are key to the set, halving the damage from physically and specially based attacks, respectively. However, the most crucial moves of the set are Memento and U-turn. The former allows Uxie to bring in a sweeper and allow it to set up freely, while the latter keeps Uxie alive to potentially set up screens later in the game, while also building momentum and possibly getting in a sweeper undamaged. Stealth Rock is the best move for Uxie's last moveslot, as the majority of teams that utilize dual screen Uxie are heavily offensively based and lack space for Stealth Rock anywhere else on their team. However, Thunder Wave can also be used to cripple dangerous threats.</p> <p>Uxie's EVs allow it to set up screens before being hit by attacks from Entei, Rotom, and some Drapion, all of which significantly damage Uxie if it doesn't have a screen up. However, Uxie can also utilize an EV spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe, giving it significantly more bulk, while also making U-turn more effective, allowing Uxie to use it to bring in frail sweepers without them taking damage. Uxie can also make use of a spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe, allowing it to outspeed Absol, although it can't hurt it outside of U-turn.</p> <p>When using dual screens, there's only one type of team that Uxie fits well onto: pure offensive. Thus, powerful offensive Pokemon such as Swords Dance Gallade, Belly Drum Linoone, and Shift Gear Klinklang pair very well with Uxie. In addition, they synergize decently with its resistances, although dual screens Uxie can be played recklessly, with little focus on its resistances and immunity, but rather its sole focus being to set up screens. This allows Memento to be used well, as it can weaken Pokemon enough that some of the most dangerous sweepers in the tier, such as Omastar and Sceptile are also capable of setting up unhindered. While it only really fits well on hyper offense, dual screens Uxie is undoubtedly one of the most effective dual screen users in the tier.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Boasting a rather quick base Speed, along with excellent bulk, Uxie makes quite an effective Choice Scarf user. It's capable of thoroughly muddling many common switch-ins, which suffer heavily if given a Choice Scarf. In addition, Uxie possesses the useful ability to outspeed many common Taunt users and set up Stealth Rock prior to being hit by Taunt. U-turn is an excellent move on the set, allowing Uxie to scout out the opponent's moves, and pivot through the opponent's team, gaining momentum. Stealth Rock, Thunder Wave, or Zen Headbutt can be used in any of Uxie's next two moveslots, with each having their own advantages and disadvantages. Generally, Zen Headbutt should be used, as it gives Uxie some offensive presence, allowing it to make use of the fact that it outspeeds the entire metagame. However, being locked into a Psychic-type move is a slight disadvantage, as it makes Uxie open to being trapped by Pursuit users. Stealth Rock is a very helpful option, with the entry hazard being useful on nearly every single team out there. Finally, Thunder Wave can be used in order to allow Uxie to perform as a clutch check against Pokemon such as Lilligant. Trick should be used in Uxie's final moveslot, as it's capable of royally messing with a huge number of common Uxie switch-ins.</p> <p>With max Speed, Uxie is capable of outspeeding everything up to +1 Drapion, whom Uxie ties with. However, bulkier EV spreads can be used, such as 252 HP / 32 Def / 224 Spe, which allows Uxie to outrun +1 positive nature base 90s, such as +1 Moltres and Lilligant. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 72 Def / 184 Speed is capable of outrunning Modest Rotom-A and everything slower. Uxie can also opt to run a more offensive EV spread, to better make use of Zen Headbutt, but such spreads are usually better left to Mesprit, who boasts significantly stronger offenses. As Uxie is an excellent momentum gainer, it partners well with other Pokemon that appreciate having the opponent's team scouted out, including other U-turn and Volt Switch users. In addition, as with any other Uxie set, TrickScarf Uxie really appreciates being paired with Pokemon that resist Dark-, Bug-, and Ghost-type attacks. Bulky Fighting- and Steel-types are usually the best options for this, such as Hariyama and Aggron.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Weather teams have proven at times to have quite a dominating performance in RU, and Uxie is undeniably one of the best weather supporters. Its excellent Speed and defenses, along with access to U-turn and Memento make it the ideal choice for nearly all the sun and rain offense teams in RU. Sunny Day or Rain Dance is the necessary support move of the set, preparing the maelstrom of offensive pressure from either sun or rain sweepers. U-turn and Memento are capable of providing free switch-ins for Uxie's teammates, with U-turn usually being the more useful move, keeping Uxie alive to set weather up again later in the game if need be, while Memento is useful for allowing weather abusers that set up, such as Growth Shiftry and Swords Dance Kabutops, apply their stat boosts with ease. Stealth Rock is a nifty support option, as it's hard to fit onto some weather teams, while either Heal Bell or Psychic can be used in Uxie's last moveslot, with Heal Bell curing any statused weather abusers, and Psychic giving Uxie some mild offensive presence.</p> <p>Uxie's EVs outspeed max Speed base 55s, while giving it enough bulk to handle hits from pretty much every common sweeper in the tier without too much trouble. Uxie can run maximum Speed, which is most useful in conjunction with Memento, as it allows it to near assuredly set up weather and then proceed to Memento and open up the path for a sweeper to come in freely. It can also opt to run minimum Speed with U-turn, allowing it to survive hits from pretty much any Pokemon in the tier to set up weather, then take a hit from the opponent and U-turn out to a weather sweeper, allowing them to switch in unscathed. Finally, Uxie can take more offensive routes, such as when using Psychic, although they usually aren't as useful, as it's best to allow the weather sweepers to take advantage of the weather to sweep rather than trying to punch holes with Uxie.</p> <p>Uxie's teammates are entirely dependent on whether it is using Sunny Day and Heat Rock or Rain Dance and Damp Rock. With Sunny Day sets, Tangrowth, Charizard, and Shiftry all make excellent teammates. They all can take advantage of the sun in some way, either to set up and sweep with Tangrowth and Shiftry, or in Charizard's case, simply punch enormous holes in everything. Shiftry is especially useful, due to its Dark typing giving it some nifty resistances that pair well with Uxie. When using Rain Dance teams, Uxie goes well with Gorebyss, Ludicolo, and Huntail. If it's using Memento, however, Kabutops and Omastar both pair very nicely with Uxie, as it can allow them to freely set up.</p> "

  "Mesprit": {
    "overview": "<p>Mesprit is one of the more versatile Pokemon in the RU metagame. With well-rounded stats, a solid offensive movepool, and a good support movepool, it can take on quite a few roles effectively; for example, Mesprit can support its team, sweep, or even break down defensive cores depending on its set. Its ability to check powerful Pokemon such as Slowking, Gallade, and Sigilyph while keeping up offensive pressure is a big key in differentiating itself from the many other Psychic-types in the tier such as Uxie and Slowking. Mesprit also has Levitate, which lets it get a free pass on Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Ground-type moves, thus making it a better user of U-turn than most other Pokemon in the tier. However, a lack of reliable recovery, a Pursuit weakness, and having only decent Speed leaves Mesprit vulnerable to being worn down or revenge killed by the many offensive Pokemon in the tier. Mesprit's Psychic typing not only leaves it weak to Pursuit, but it also leaves the pixie weak to Bug-type moves from the likes of Galvantula, Durant, and Escavalier. Mesprit's stat distribution, while solid overall, leaves it without a true \"standout\" stat, meaning that no single set can threaten multiple types of team at the same time. Even so, Mesprit's versatility can give your opponent a headache as they attempt to work out what set it could be running. Mesprit is a versatile Psychic-type and can support its team in multiple ways, so always give it some consideration when building a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mesprit's movepool is fairly wide, so it stands to reason that there are quite a few options to consider. With Mesprit's great coverage and utility options, one might wonder why a Choice Scarf set isn't viable. This is due in large part to Mesprit's only above average Special Attack and consequently the fact that it can't deter most Pursuit users from coming in without a boost to its Special Attack in some way. Mesprit's base 80 Speed isn't terribly high, so one might be inclined to try a Trick Room set. While Mesprit's access to Healing Wish does set it apart from other Trick Room setters, its base 80 Speed is still a little too fast and lets two of Mesprit's best checks, Escavalier and Spiritomb, outspeed it. Mesprit has a decent physical movepool which includes Zen Headbutt and the elemental punches. However, Mesprit's only means of boosting its physical attack is through the use of a Choice Band, and the use of Psyshock on special sets can usually accomplish everything a Choice Band set could and more. Signal Beam and Shadow Ball can provide extra coverage, but they are generally not as useful as Mesprit's primary coverage options.</p> <p>Mesprit's support movepool has some options as well. Like most other Psychic-types, Mesprit can use dual screens and its access to Healing Wish can be helpful late-game. Mesprit also has access to Rain Dance and Sunny Day. While Mesprit may have better offensive prowess for such sets, these types of sets generally require Speed and bulk, and Mesprit is outclassed by Uxie in both departments. Thunder Wave can cripple fast attackers attempting to revenge kill Mesprit, but Uxie and Slowking can do this better. Knock Off can remove items from Pokemon such as Ferroseed, Magneton, and Steelix, but Mesprit struggles to find space for it. A set consisting of Trick and a Flame Orb can be used to cripple two of Mesprit's best checks, Spiritomb and Escavalier, but it's a single use combination and the surprise element is gone once Flame Orb activates on Mesprit. Lastly, Mesprit's only reliable form of recovery is to use RestTalk; however, the BW sleep mechanics make this hard to pull off, as Mesprit has exploitable weaknesses and only above average bulk.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Spiritomb is generally a very safe response to Mesprit. It's immune to Mesprit's Psychic-type STAB moves and isn't weak to any of the pixie's coverage moves either. Spiritomb's access to both Sucker Punch and Pursuit puts Mesprit in a terrible situation. Escavalier has to fear Hidden Power Fire, but Occa Berry variants can take the move and retaliate with a powerful STAB Megahorn or Pursuit should Mesprit try to switch out. Absol is a more offensive response that can take down Mesprit with Sucker Punch or Pursuit, but its frailty can often hinder its ability to switch in. Any Mesprit set that lacks Psyshock can be beaten by special walls such as Clefable and Cryogonal. Sturdy Steel-types such as Magneton, Steelix, and Ferroseed can beat most Mesprit that lack Hidden Power Fire. Klinklang is a Steel-type that can not only check Mesprit, but also use the pixie as setup fodder should it lack Hidden Power Fire. Regirock might not be very common in RU, but its solid mixed defenses and lack of a weakness to any of Mesprit's common moves make it a solid check to Mesprit. However, its lack of reliable recovery can catch up with Regirock should it be relied upon too much.</p> <p>Faster Bug- and Ghost-type Pokemon will rarely be able to switch into Mesprit, but they are more than capable of preying on its weaknesses after a KO. Scolipede, Durant, and Rotom can all come in after a KO to do serious damage to Mesprit if it isn't behind a Substitute. Pokemon that can outspeed Mesprit and hit it hard can generally overpower the pixie and its above average bulk. Entei, Tauros, and Moltres are examples of such Pokemon, but most of them will have trouble switching into Mesprit. Mesprit's lack of reliable recovery will ultimately be its downfall against teams that use constant offensive pressure, but do be aware that Mesprit can use the common Fighting-, Ground-, and Psychic-type moves used in the tier to get an easy switch-in opportunity.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Offensive Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<p>This set is very flexible in how it can be played, so it can be described as Mesprit's most balanced set. Stealth Rock is needed for any team and Mesprit can use its resistances to Psychic- and Fighting-type moves to easily come in and set up the entry hazard with few issues. Psychic provides Mesprit with a solid STAB option to take down the Fighting-types that it naturally checks. Thunderbolt is generally preferred for Mesprit's coverage move on this set as it allows Mesprit to hit Sigilyph and Slowking really hard. However, if these Psychic-types are not a problem for your team, Hidden Power Fire is a solid alternative as it hits Escavalier, Steelix, and Ferroseed much harder than Mesprit's other moves. The last slot allows Mesprit to provide extra team support. U-turn generally gets the nod to let Mesprit act as a better pivot throughout the match. If that doesn't appeal to the needs of your team that much, then Healing Wish is an option worth considering. Although Mesprit loses some mid-game utility, it can sacrifice itself to bring back a weakened teammate late-game to possibly win the match.</p> <p>The EV spread is simply meant to maximize Mesprit's offensive presence, but there are some other Speed benchmarks you can consider if you'd prefer to use some EVs for HP to bulk Mesprit up. 216 Speed EVs are required in order to outspeed positive base 75s such as Absol and Smeargle, while 164 Speed EVs will keep Mesprit a step ahead of neutral-natured base 80s such as Kabutops and Gallade. If you opt to use Hidden Power Fire, you will have to compensate with 4 additional EVs in Speed as the move requires an imperfect Speed IV. It is not recommended to drop Mesprit's Speed EVs below 164 as it would then be outclassed by its cousin, Uxie. Leftovers is Mesprit's only form of recovery, so it's the held item of choice on this set. Colbur Berry is a decent alternative to let Mesprit have a bit more safety in the presence of Pursuit users such as Spiritomb and Escavalier. Lum Berry is another option as it lets Mesprit effectively shut down opposing Smeargle leads by outspeeding it and shrugging off a Spore with the Lum Berry. Finally, a Life Orb can be used to increase damage output, but this significantly lowers Mesprit's staying power and will make U-turn more of a liability. Ice Beam is another option to consider to hit Rhydon and Golurk harder than any other move while it also gets a slightly harder hit on Grass-types than Hidden Power Fire would. Psyshock is an alternative STAB move that hits special walls harder and allows Mesprit to handle Gallade more easily.</p> <p>Fighting-types generally pair well with Mesprit, as they can take the Bug- and Dark-type moves aimed at Mesprit, while Mesprit can check most of the Psychic-types that threaten them. Emboar and Hitmonlee in particular both appreciate Mesprit being able to wear down the likes of Slowking and Sigilyph over the course of the match. Aggron is another useful offensive partner that has the added benefit of being able to handle the Ghost-type moves Mesprit dislikes, while Mesprit is able to handle both of Aggron's 4x weaknesses quite nicely. Spikes users can pair well with Mesprit, as the latter can utilize U-turn to get them in on favorable match-ups, making their job easier. Ferroseed and Qwilfish are sturdier Spikes users that provide solid defensive synergy with Mesprit, while Scolipede and Omastar are more offensive options. Thanks to Mesprit's rare combination of Stealth Rock and offensive presence, it can easily find a home on VoltTurn teams as a bulky pivot that provides said offensive presence and Stealth Rock support in one slot. Magneton, Braviary, Rotom-C, and Primeape are all solid options as partners on VoltTurn teams.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>This set uses Mesprit's great coverage and solid base 105 Special Attack stat to become a solid setup sweeper. Calm Mind is Mesprit's only boosting move, and allows Mesprit to boost its Special Attack, while simultaneously boosting Special Defense to make it harder for opposing special attackers to revenge kill. Psyshock is the preferred STAB move in order to hit special walls such as Cryogonal and Clefable that would otherwise handle this set, but Psychic is a decent alternative in order to hit Rhydon and Tangrowth much harder. Thunderbolt is necessary to get past Slowking, a very common Pokemon that is able to stand up to most other special attacking Psychic-types. The last move lets Mesprit hit Grass-types such as Tangrowth for heavy damage regardless of which one you pick. Hidden Power Fire is preferred though so Mesprit can handle the likes of Ferroseed, Steelix, and Escavalier. Ice Beam is an alternative to hit Rhydon, Druddigon, and Golurk harder than any other move.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes damage output while accounting for the imperfect Speed IV required by Hidden Power Fire by using enough Speed EVs to outpace positive base 75s such as Absol and Smeargle. 4 EVs are shifted from HP to Defense in order to hit a Life Orb number. If you opt for Ice Beam, place the HP and Defense EVs into Speed, while leaving 4 EVs in HP. In terms of ideal teammates, a check to Spiritomb is very important to have, as Spiritomb can take any move from this set and checkmate Mesprit between Sucker Punch and Pursuit. Aggron and Emboar can both handle Spiritomb's moves quite nicely and weaken it and other defensive cores to set the stage for Mesprit to sweep later. Drapion isn't as common as Spiritomb, but its typing and decent special bulk mean it can take a hit or two from Mesprit and retaliate with a STAB Crunch. More offensive variants of Drapion will outspeed Mesprit as well. Steel-types such as Steelix and Escavalier can generally handle Drapion without too many issues. Uxie has enough bulk to handle multiple hits from Mesprit and either cripple it with Thunder Wave or force it out with Yawn. Escavalier is a perfect answer to Uxie as it doesn't mind paralysis, can use Sleep Talk to deal with a possible Yawn, and has Pursuit to ensure Uxie can't escape without taking heavy damage. Entry hazard support is nice to have to ensure that Rhydon and bulky Gallade are OHKOed by +1 Ice Beam and Psyshock, respectively. Steelix and Rhydon can take on most of the physical attackers that usually come in to revenge kill Mesprit, and can also set up Stealth Rock. Qwilfish is able to check Durant, Escavalier, and Choice Scarf Emboar, while setting up Spikes against them. Smeargle, Omastar, Ferroseed, and Golurk can also support Mesprit in various ways while also supplying entry hazards.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<p>This set gives up the ability to switch moves in exchange for an immediate power boost. Choice Specs Mesprit doesn't have the raw power of other Choice Specs users such as Moltres, Typhlosion, and Tangrowth, but it is a great offensive pivot with impressive coverage and sufficient power to be threatening. Psyshock is the chosen STAB move to get past the likes of Cryogonal, Clefable, and Gallade with much greater ease. Psychic can be used if your team has issues with Rhydon and Tangrowth, but the ability to break down special walls without the need of a physical move is something few other Choice Specs users have. Thunderbolt is necessary in order to deal serious damage to Slowking while OHKOing the likes of offensive Sigilyph, Kabutops, and Crawdaunt. Hidden Power Fire gets the nod in the next slot to handle Steel-types such as Steelix, Escavalier, and Ferroseed that can handle Mesprit's other moves. Ice Beam is a decent alternative to hit Rhydon, Golurk, and Druddigon super effectively. Both moves hit important Grass-types such as Tangrowth. U-turn rounds out the set by making Mesprit a great offensive pivot and scouting for its checks and counters. Ice Beam can be used here to maximize coverage if it isn't used over Hidden Power Fire already. Trick is also a decent option, although Mesprit will rarely want to lose its Choice Specs.</p> <p>The EV spread lets Mesprit outspeed positive base 75s such as Smeargle and Absol while accounting for the imperfect Speed IV required for Hidden Power Fire. You can maximize Speed if Hidden Power Fire isn't used, but the EV spread given already lets Mesprit outspeed what it needs to while serving as a solid offensive pivot. Timid is preferred so Mesprit can run the small amount of HP EVs needed to ensure Life Orb Gallade and Choice Scarf Medicham fail to 2HKO with Close Combat and Hi Jump Kick, respectively.</p> <p>Entry hazard support, and Spikes in particular, is very useful to ensure Rhydon and specially defensive Gallade are OHKOed by Ice Beam and Psyshock respectively after 3 layers of Spikes and Stealth Rock (assuming a Timid nature). Ferroseed and Qwilfish both share good defensive synergy with Mesprit and are able to set up Spikes. Scolipede is a more offensive Spikes user that can weaken opposing Psychic-types with its STAB Megahorn. Stealth Rock support ensures that Magmortar and Moltres are OHKOed by Psyshock, making Stealth Rock setters such as Rhydon and Golurk solid partners for this set. Escavalier can be taken care of by Hidden Power Fire, but it doesn't fear much of anything else on this set. For this reason, mixed variants of Druddigon and Absol can be used as partners to lure Escavalier in and KO it with their powerful Fire-type coverage moves. Emboar and Moltres can switch into Escavalier thanks to their 4x resistance to Bug and quickly force it out with the threat of a powerful Fire-type STAB move, making them great ways to deal with Escavalier as well. As Mesprit has good synergy with most physically based wallbreakers, said wallbreakers can form an excellent wallbreaking core. Mixed and Choice Band Emboar, Escavalier, and Aggron all provide solid defensive synergy with Mesprit while putting significant pressure on opposing teams. Mesprit's U-turn can also get them in on favorable match-ups to heighten their effectiveness. VoltTurn teams can also make good use of Choice Specs Mesprit thanks to its ability to pivot into and out of attacks. Magneton, Rotom-C, Primeape, and Braviary are all solid partners on such teams. Magneton deserves a special mention, as it can trap and remove Steel-types for Mesprit. Finally, fast special attackers, such as Sceptile and Accelgor, can be used to clean up late-game after Mesprit has broken down the opposing defensive core.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Mesprit is commonly seen using Calm Mind in a more offensively inclined fashion, it is certainly capable of using its acceptable bulk and solid resistances to use Calm Mind in a more defensive approach. Mesprit's superior immediate power and access to Ice Beam is what sets this apart from Uxie. Substitute protects Mesprit against status moves and, more importantly, Sucker Punch from the likes of Absol and Spiritomb. Calm Mind allows Mesprit to boosts its Special Attack to threatening levels, while also making it harder for special attackers to break Mesprit's Substitutes thanks to the Special Defense boost. Psyshock provides Mesprit with a reliable STAB move and gives it a way to beat special walls and opposing Calm Mind users. Thunderbolt gives Mesprit solid two-move coverage between it and Psyshock by hitting the likes of Slowking and Sigilyph hard. Ice Beam is an alternative to hit Rhydon, Golurk, Steelix, and most Grass-types much harder.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Mesprit to outspeed positive base 75s, most notably Absol and Smeargle. Maximum investment in Special Attack is used to let Mesprit hit as hard as possible, with the remaining EVs going into HP to give Mesprit a little more bulk. You can opt to maximize Speed in order to tie with other positive base 80s, but the primary need for this Mesprit is to outspeed Absol and Smeargle so it can play around them with Substitute, so any further Speed EVs tend to be unnecessary. Psychic is an alternative STAB option that can hit Rhydon and Tangrowth hard without having to resort to Ice Beam.</p> <p>Mesprit won't have full coverage owing to the need to use Substitute, so teammates that can cover these holes are necessary. Samurott is a fantastic partner, as it can use a mixed set to break down most of Mesprit's defensive checks, such as Steelix and Regirock, while also being able to carry Ice Beam itself to handle Tangrowth, Druddigon, and others. Escavalier, Magneton, and Spiritomb can all handle this set well. To combat them, Emboar and Entei can be used, and have the added benefit of being able to threaten special walls in general. Regirock isn't a very common threat, but its solid mixed defenses let it hold up against Mesprit quite easily. Grass-types such as Rotom-C, Torterra, and Sceptile are able to deal with Regirock and can also deal with bulky Water-types such as Slowking if Mesprit forgoes Thunderbolt. This set lacks immediate power when compared to Mesprit's other offensive sets, so entry hazards are helpful to mitigate this issue. Rhydon and Steelix are able to handle the majority of physical attackers in the tier and set up Stealth Rock. Qwilfish is able to check Escavalier, Entei, and Durant fairly well, and can set up Spikes to limit their opportunities to switch in. Finally, Pursuit support is nice for Mesprit in order to remove bulky Psychic-types such as Uxie, Slowking, and opposing Mesprit. Escavalier fears very little from these Psychic-types and has the bulk to take any coverage move from them barring Fire-type moves. Absol might lack the bulk of Escavalier, but it has the added benefit of being able to run Fire Blast to catch Tangrowth, Escavalier, and Ferroseed on the switch for major damage.</p> "

  "Liepard": {
    "overview": "<p>Liepard was once considered a useless Pokemon in RU; it had considerably poor stats except for a good base 106 Speed, and its non-existent bulk did it no favors. However, Liepard gained Prankster from the Dream World, which better utilizes its rather good support movepool. With Prankster, Liepard has the ability to set up guaranteed weather, and it also gains priority on moves such as Thunder Wave and Encore. Additionally, Liepard's combination of support moves isn't entirely the same as that of other Prankster users. In contrast to other Prankster Pokemon, Liepard can actually go on the offensive instead of completely relying on its ability as a support Pokemon. It has access to Nasty Plot to boost its base 88 Special Attack with, which is a lot more useful than an offensive Tail Glow Volbeat with base 47 Special Attack. Unlike Volbeat, however, it cannot Baton Pass its boosts to teammates. Much like most other Prankster users, Liepard is rather frail and can sometimes be hard to use effectively. Still, Liepard is a usable Pokemon, and although it might not be a top-tier threat, it is nevertheless a threat to be wary of in its own right.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Liepard has a couple of other useful support moves to use. Toxic can be used to wear down foes, and Taunt can be used in tandem with it to prevent healing. However, Liepard is usually used on an offensive team and would rather use Thunder Wave to slow down the opponent and gain momentum instead of trying to stall with Toxic damage. Liepard also tends to force switches, as it threatens to paralyze foes or set up on them; Yawn can be used to capitalize on those switches and gain entry hazard damage or put a foe to sleep. It can also be used as a last-resort attempt to halt a sweep if a phazing move is not available. Torment is a usable move along with Substitute, Toxic Spikes support, and sometimes Protect; however, it's mostly a situational move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>With very poor defenses and abysmal HP, any reasonably strong attack will do significant damage to Liepard. Keeping a strong offensive presence against Liepard will also make it hard for it to switch in safely. Choice Band Entei makes a good check to Liepard, as Extreme Speed has +2 priority and can take out Liepard once its Substitute is down. Multi-hit move users such as Cinccino and Klinklang can hit Liepard through its Substitute. Ferroseed walls Liepard quite comfortably and can set up entry hazards if the latter doesn't have Taunt. Rhydon can also use Rock Blast to get past Liepard, is immune to Thunder Wave, and can sponge confusion to some extent thanks to its Eviolite-boosted Defense.</p> <p>Against the weather support set, Volbeat and Illumise can give Liepard problems, as U-turn from both of them will 2HKO Liepard; they make it hard for Liepard to be useful at all against them if they are used on another weather team. As Liepard is faster than Volbeat, the latter can Encore Liepard into its weather-inducing move or just use its own weather move after Liepard. As for the Nasty Plot set, Quagsire, Poliwrath, and Crawdaunt are generally good checks to it as long as Liepard doesn't carry Grass Knot. If it doesn't use Hidden Power Fire, Steel-types such as Escavalier and Klinklang are good answers to Liepard. Priority users, such as Entei, are also good checks. Faster Pokemon such as Durant and Choice Scarf users are also great Liepard checks, as offensive Liepard relies on its high Speed and cannot take most hits comfortably. However, one has to be aware of that Liepard can be sacrificed in order to paralyze those faster checks with Thunder Wave.</p> ",

It also stops the opponent from using status and support moves or from setting up. U-turn is obligatory for Liepard to switch out to its teammates. Against Trick Room teams, Taunt and Encore are both valuable tools; the former prevents Trick Room from being set up, while the latter forces the Trick Room user to switch or undo Trick Room on the next turn.</p> <p>The given EVs are to maximize special bulk so as to better allow Liepard to come in on weak special attacks such as Lanturn's Scald. However, a physically defensive EV spread along with Impish can also be opted for, as it reduces the damage taken by Volbeat's U-turn, which can really limit Liepard's ability to win the weather war against it.</p> <p>Weather sweepers are obvious teammates for Liepard. Omastar, Ludicolo, and Kabutops fit the bill for rain sweepers while Victreebel, Exeggutor, and Sawsbuck are options for sun teams. Encore not only lets Liepard set up, but it also opens up opportunities for a free switch to the weather sweepers. Other weather inducers can also work well alongside Liepard, given its poor bulk and inability to stay alive for long. Prankster weather inducers also work well as teammates if you want a fast-paced team, but bulkier weather supporters such as Rotom-C can work too when faced against an offensive team so that Liepard doesn't become single-use only.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Liepard has an average base 88 Special Attack but a pretty useful base 106 Speed. While Liepard's offenses might not be considered high enough for a special attacker, it has access to Nasty Plot to bolster its Special Attack to something much more usable and even threatening. Thanks to Prankster, Liepard can find some ease in setting up despite its low defenses. Encore can trap opponents in their non-attacking and other set-up moves. For example, Calm Mind Sigilyph would simply become setup fodder for Liepard after being Encored. However, Liepard cannot risk trying to Encore sweepers with priority moves such as Aqua Jet Feraligatr and Kabutops. Liepard can also take advantage of Pokemon such as Qwilfish who might try to set up multiple layers of entry hazards. However, Thunder Wave can be used as an alternative support move for the team to ease setup or paralyze switch-ins. After either Encore or Thunder Wave is used, the next turn would be an excellent opportunity to set up Nasty Plot and take advantage of an almost-guaranteed switch. Dark Pulse is a reliable STAB move while Hidden Power Fire is used as a coverage move against Steel-types and common specially defensive behemoths such as Cryogonal.</p> <p>The EVs used are straightforward to maximize Speed and Special Attack. Life Orb gives an all-important boost to Liepard's attacks, and it isn't really affected by a quickly depleting HP, as it is unlikely to survive any considerably strong attack. Liepard's base 88 Special Attack might not look like much, but here are some damage calculations to show how strong it actually is after a Nasty Plot:</p> <ul> <li>Dark Pulse vs. 4/0 Kabutops: 132.82 - 156.87% <li>Dark Pulse vs. 0/0 Moltres: 92.83 - 109.34%</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire vs. 248/92+ Cryogonal: 58.3 - 69.09%</li> <li>Dark Pulse vs. 252/252+ Clefable: 50.76 - 60.4%</li> <li>Dark Pulse vs. 40/216+ Lanturn: 57.6 - 68.07%</li> </ul> <p>Grass Knot is also an option over Hidden Power Fire to hit Water-types such as Quagsire, Crawdaunt, and Poliwrath super effectively. If Grass Knot is used, Steelix can work as a teammate by walling Pokemon such as Escavalier and Klinklang. However, if Hidden Power Fire is used, Grass- or Electric-type teammates such as Rotom-C and Sceptile can be used to deal with bulky Water-types such as Lanturn and more importantly, Poliwrath. Hidden Power Fighting is also another option against Aggron, but Hidden Power Fire is usually recommended as it also allows Liepard to hit Bug-types super effectively. As Liepard is rather frail, dual screens support from Pokemon such as Uxie is recommended. Furthermore, Uxie can also use U-turn to bring Liepard in safely. Liepard will also face problems against Fighting-types, so Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Spiritomb and Uxie are great teammates for it. Qwilfish is also a plausible teammate, as it can check Fighting-types with Intimidate and its Poison typing while also setting up Spikes, which helps to guarantee an OHKO on Kabutops and 2HKOs on Lanturn and Clefable with layers. Furthermore, Qwilfish helps to deal with priority moves such as Extreme Speed from Entei. Choice Scarf users can put a stop to Liepard as well, so their removal is greatly appreciated.</p> "

A Water typing not only gives Simipour a great offensive STAB, but also one the best defensive typings in the game, having only two weaknesses. Simipour is also one of the very few offensive Water-types in the RU tier, having good offensive stats and great Speed, outpacing many top threats. Even though Simipour faces stiff competition from Pokemon such as Feraligatr, it has one thing that sets it apart from the pack: Nasty Plot. Nasty Plot turns Simipour into a dangerous opponent to face, with its Special Attack reaching great levels. However, Simipour still has its downsides. It is weak to the common Grass- and Electric-type moves, and might not last for long due its frailty. However, with access to a great movepool, which includes Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, Simipour is able to break through most teams with a boost or two.</p> ",

Simipour has the Speed and Attack stat to make use of Choice Band, but its physical movepool is severely limited, as evidenced by how it lacks a vital coverage move in Ice Punch. In the same vein, Hone Claws can work, but a mere +1 boost isn't nearly enough either. A mixed set is possible with Work Up, but Simipour's offensive stats don't measure up to what is needed. Taunt is a viable option, making Pokemon such as Slowking and Ferroseed easier to deal with, and works wonderfully with Simipour's great Speed stat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Slowking can survive a Hidden Power Grass or two, and recover the damage taken with Slack Off; a Simipour without Hidden Power Grass will never beat Slowking. Lanturn has the same case scenario against Simipour lacking Hidden Power Grass, but can't take the move as well as Slowking. Galvantula is a lot faster than Simipour and can easily KO it with Thunder, but it needs to be careful of switching in. Cryogonal has a huge Special Defense stat and can easily take a hit from Simipour. It can then recover the damage or even Haze away its boosts; however, it needs to be careful of Focus Blast or when it's at low health.</p> ",

Hidden Power Grass is a way for Simipour to nail opposing Water-types, most notably Slowking and Lanturn, who would otherwise wall Simipour. However, Substitute is still a viable option with the right teammates, making setting up easier for Simipour. Surf can be used over Hydro Pump as a more reliable option, but Simipour will miss the massive power behind Hydro Pump.</p> <p>Although Gluttony is useless for this set, Torrent is, unfortunately, illegal with Nasty Plot. Leftovers is a decent item choice if you opt to use Substitute. Entry hazards can really help against bulkier opponents, such as Slowking. Roselia makes the best partner, as it resists Grass- and Electric-type moves, and can set up both Toxic Spikes and Spikes. Sandslash is a reliable user of Stealth Rock, and can also provide Rapid Spin support, which is beneficial since Simipour is weak to entry hazards in general. However, Cryogonal is a better choice for a Rapid Spinner, as it has access to Recover and isn't prone to being set up on, unlike Sandslash. Dual screens support is also helpful, as it eases setting up. Cryogonal and Uxie can do this alongside providing other forms of support. Also, Baton Pass support in the form of Speed boosts can be helpful in sweeping. Ninjask is a great choice for this. If you choose to use Substitute over Hidden Power Grass, something to take care of Slowking and Lanturn is needed. Crawdaunt hits Slowking hard with Crunch, while Scolipede and Galvantula dent it pretty hard with their STAB moves. Grass-types such as Lilligant and Sceptile can easily take care of Lanturn, resisting both of its STAB moves.</p> "

Entry hazards can also help Simipour, as the extra damage assists it in scoring some necessary KOs or keep the opponent from switching. Roselia and Uxie pair well with Simipour, covering each others weaknesses; Roselia can also support Simipour with Spikes and Toxic Spikes, whereas Uxie can set up Stealth Rock.

  "Musharna": {
    "overview": "<p>Musharna is often overlooked in the RU tier despite having many unique features with which to distinguish itself from other Psychic-types. Thanks to its great mixed bulk and pure Psychic typing, Musharna makes for an excellent all-purpose Fighting-type counter, taking on many of the deadly Fighting-types in RU such as Medicham, Hitmonlee, and Hariyama. Musharna also has a decent movepool, but not a lot of it is usable because of its poor Speed and inability to use physical attacks effectively. However, this does not stop Musharna from doing its job effectively. As an added advantage, it makes good use of Synchronize, which means the opponent will have to think twice before using Toxic to wear Musharna down. Despite these qualities, Musharna is stopped cold by Dark-types, so you should be especially cautious when they are spotted in Team Preview.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Boasting a diverse movepool, Musharna has a number of usable options. Barrier can be used alongside Calm Mind, and can make Musharna virtually untouchable, boosting Stored Power's strength even more. It also has a number of useful support options such as Toxic and Thunder Wave, making an all-purpose walling set viable. However, Slowking will generally do this better, thanks to the added bonus of Regenerator. Musharna can also run Trick Room, but again Slowking does this better. Light Screen and Reflect are interesting options that can provide useful team support, especially when Musharna is holding Light Clay. Musharna gets a number of other support moves, such as Rain Dance, Yawn, and Magic Coat, which can all come in handy depending on what your team requires.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Spiritomb is a full stop to every Musharna set that doesn't run Shadow Ball, and even then Spiritomb will almost always come out on top. Drapion and Skuntank can switch in on any move apart from Hidden Power Ground, Taunt Musharna to stop it from using Calm Mind or Moonlight, and follow up with a STAB Pursuit or Crunch. Crawdaunt can switch in using its immunity to Psychic-type attacks and KO with Crunch, but it must be wary of Hidden Power Fighting. Aggron can do a similar job, just with a resistance to Psychic-type attacks instead of an immunity. Toxic Spikes are an excellent way to wear down Musharna, and Drapion does this excellently thanks of its Dark typing. If Musharna doesn't run Hidden Power Fighting then Ferroseed, Steelix, and Klinklang can all switch in and either set up or Roar Musharna away.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>Exceptional natural bulk and reliable recovery make Musharna an excellent user of Calm Mind provided Dark-types can be removed from the opponent's team first. Calm Mind is the ideal setup move for a slow and bulky Pokemon with decent offenses like Musharna. Stored Power is generally the superior STAB move of choice on this set, as it will be more powerful than Psychic after just two Calm Minds . However, setting up two Calm Minds is not always possible in a fast-paced match, so Psychic can be used to reliably wear down a particular threat that can stop Musharna from sweeping. Then, once the threat is weakened, it can begin to set up with Calm Mind. Moonlight is absolutely essential on Musharna, allowing it to act as both a wall and bulky sweeper at the same time. Reliable recovery is invaluable, as it can let Musharna set up multiple times throughout a match. Dark-types wall this set indefinitely, and there are no shortage of those in RU. Spiritomb, Drapion, and Crawdaunt all get decent usage and can switch into this set without fear. For this reason alone, Baton Pass is the best option for the last moveslot. It allows Musharna to work around its regular checks by using Baton Pass as they switch in, and then switching to an appropriate check or counter. This allows Musharna to indirectly wear down or remove its counters, and sweep later on. Secondly, Baton Pass can be used to pass Calm Mind boosts to a teammate, which can potentially lead to a sweep.</p> <p>The EV spread is used to maximize physical bulk, which lets Musharna set up on the majority of Fighting-types in RU, as well as many other physical attackers that don't carry a move that hits it for super effective damage, while also getting the jump on Slowking and Amoonguss. Calm Mind boosts Musharna's Special Attack and Special Defense, so investing EVs in those two stats is not necessary. Musharna can also use a Sleep Talk set, granting it pseudo-immunity to status, one of its worst enemies. With Rest, Sleep Talk, Calm Mind, and a STAB move, not much will be able to reliably stop Musharna; even the sturdiest special walls in RU, such as Slowking, will eventually fall to it. However, it leaves Musharna completely unable to touch Dark-types or even work around them due to the lack of Baton Pass, not to mention it becomes setup bait for a number of sweepers while it is asleep, including the dangerous Nasty Plot Slowking. Taking this approach will require much more team support, and in particular a powerful Fighting-type to deal with Dark-types. Psyshock is another option for a STAB move, as it means Cryogonal cannot wall Musharna and use Haze repeatedly to get rid of Calm Mind boosts. Hidden Power is an effective move that gives Musharna more coverage, enabling it to hit some of its major threats for decent amounts of damage. Hidden Power Fighting can be used to hit Absol and Crawdaunt, two excellent offensive checks to Musharna. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ground can be used to hit Drapion and Skuntank, or even Hidden Power Bug to hit Psychic-types such as Uxie and Slowking. As you can see there are a number of options for Hidden Power, not all of which are listed here. Whichever type is chosen will still leave a large gap in coverage, so Baton Pass is generally the superior option.</p> <p>Fighting- and Steel-types make for good partners because of their ability to take on Dark-types with ease. Steelix and Ferroseed can wall the majority of Dark-types that plague Musharna, and Magneton can make good use of any Calm Mind boosts that get passed to it. Hariyama is another good option as it also has excellent bulk, meaning it can switch into Dark-types (as well as opposing Steel-types) multiple times in a match and beat them with its powerful offenses in the process. Toxic Spikes seriously limits Musharna's usefulness, so a Rapid Spin user or a Poison-type that can absorb Toxic Spikes are excellent teammates. Hitmonchan has good synergy with Musharna as it can beat Dark-types and get rid of Toxic Spikes, while Musharna can take the Psychic-type attacks aimed at Hitmonchan. As for Poison-types, Qwilfish, Drapion, and Roselia are all good options. Qwilfish and Roselia can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes to wear down switch-ins to Musharna, while Drapion can set up Toxic Spikes and act as a decent check to opposing Dark-types. Moltres deserves a special mention as a teammate to receive Calm Mind boosts, as it can easily switch in on the Bug-types that can beat Musharna.</p> "

  "Gurdurr": {
    "overview": "<p>Gurdurr has all the traits needed of an effective bulky attacker. When boosted by Eviolite, Gurdurr becomes an impressively bulky Pokemon, capable of taking hits from powerful offensive Pokemon such as Absol and Aggron well and allowing it the leniency of switching into and setting up on a variety of physically-inclined offensive Pokemon. Access to Guts also makes crippling Gurdurr with status a much more costly and an ineffective method of handling it, as it can heal a reasonable amount of the HP lost this way with a boosted Drain Punch. Moreover, priority in the form of Mach Punch is icing on the cake, as it allows Gurdurr to mitigate its subpar Speed and check frail or weakened sweepers.</p> <p>Of course, be it due to inherent flaws or simply the nature of the RU metagame, Gurdurr is hard-pressed to effectively fulfill its desired role without significant support. Despite its rather impressive 105 base Attack stat, the lower Base Power moves that Gurdurr is forced to rely upon make it moderately weak without a boost, leaving it vulnerable both to being walled handily by naturally bulky Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Alomomola, and becoming exploited by dangerous offensive threats such as Moltres and Gallade. Gurdurr's reliance on Eviolite also presents an issue, as it not only makes it substantially more vulnerable to Trick and Spikes than similar bulky attackers of the tier but also isolates Drain Punch as Gurdurr's sole source of recovery, making it noticeably easier to wear down over time. Gurdurr is a very capable and even dangerous Pokemon in the RU metagame, but dedicated support is necessary for it to function to its fullest potential.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Gurdurr retains a reasonable amount of alternative options, both in movepool and ability, the fact that it already receives so much competition from the other Fighting-types of the tier severely restricts it from utilizing these options without becoming outclassed in that role. Iron Fist and Sheer Force both boost a substantial amount of Gurdurr's offensive movepool, but by dropping Guts, wearing down Gurdurr with poison and burn damage becomes a much more low-risk option, which is typically very unhealthy in a metagame as status-heavy as RU. In terms of alternative moves, Gurdurr has the capacity to adequately utilize a SubPunch set, but its lack of Leftovers recovery, in addition to its inability to inflict consistent damage without having a Substitute up, makes it a very inconsistent option. Knock Off, as odd as it is, can capably replace Bulk Up and allow Gurdurr to serve as an effective utility attacker, capable of removing Leftovers recovery from a variety of defensive Pokemon that commonly switch into it, such as Alomomola, Qwilfish, Tangrowth, and Uxie. However, the instances in which this is useful to the point where it is worth forgoing the ability to sweep late-game are few and far-between.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gurdurr's most basic and effective counters are Psychic-types; Pokemon such as Gallade, Mesprit, Sigilyph, and Uxie are capable of switching into Gurdurr fairly comfortably and threatening it immediately with their STAB attacks, making them very solid answers to it as long as they are able to evade Pursuit users. Slowking is somewhat similar, but its low Speed and susceptibility to hazards makes it a much less effective check, as Gurdurr can outpace and 2HKO offensive variants with Thunder Punch after Stealth Rock damage, and defensive variants lacking Psychic are very unlikely to beat Gurdurr if they have to switch into it. Bulky physical walls, such as Alomomola and Tangrowth, are capable of comfortably handling Gurdurr as long as they aren't poisoned or burned, being capable of holding up to its attacks very well and wearing it down with Toxic and/or Leech Seed damage. Similarly, Amoonguss is capable of wearing down and eventually beating any Gurdurr lacking Ice Punch while restricting its ability to boost with the threat of Clear Smog. Depending on the coverage move Gurdurr utilizes, a couple select Pokemon are capable of taking on Gurdurr fairly comfortably; Thunder Punch variants are handled by Golurk and Rotom, Qwilfish checks any Gurdurr lacking Thunder Punch, and Scyther can set up on Payback variants without much trouble. Moltres gets special acknowledgement, as it can switch into any Gurdurr set lacking Rock Slide if Stealth Rock is off the field and proceed to either use the offensive momentum it gains to set up a Substitute or outright OHKO Gurdurr with Hurricane. However, if Stealth Rock is in play, Gurdurr is capable of KOing Moltres on the switch with Thunder Punch, which deters it from switching in entirely freely. However, one of the most prominent methods of handling Gurdurr is simply by wearing it down; Gurdurr's reliance on Drain Punch for recovery can usually be exploited in the effort to take it out, as Pokemon such as Misdreavus and Accelgor can simply whittle Gurdurr down, as it cannot adequately recover HP to the extent that it can realistically sweep afterwards.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>Gurdurr's solid natural bulk, adequate movepool, and Guts ability make it a very capable user of a simple Bulk Up set. After a Bulk Up, Gurdurr becomes incredibly tough to break through on the physical side; even powerful attacks such as Choice Band Entei's Flare Blitz and Choice Band Druddigon's Outrage fail to 2HKO Gurdurr at full health. However, without any form of recovery, this becomes a moot point, which is why Drain Punch is the most optimal STAB attack for Gurdurr to use, as this allows Gurdurr to mitigate the damage taken while setting up, as well as giving it the flexibility to take hits afterwards and recover a significant amount of HP in return. Overall, Thunder Punch is the most consistently useful coverage move for Gurdurr, as it allows Gurdurr to comfortably beat Qwilfish and defensive variants of Slowking, prevent dangerous Pokemon such as Moltres from switching in for free, and maintains neutral coverage on the majority of the tier. However, Payback is also an effective option, as despite the fact that Gurdurr becomes noticeably more vulnerable to Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Moltres, it does provide Gurdurr with a method of dealing respectable damage to Psychic-types, such as Mesprit and Uxie, as well as preventing it from being completely walled by Golurk and Rotom. Mach Punch is, of course, a staple for Gurdurr, as it allows it to compensate for its low Speed and prevent stronger special attackers, such as Sceptile and Magmortar, from revenge killing it after they have been worn down enough, in addition to allowing Gurdurr to comfortably check Pokemon such as Zangoose, Tauros, and Shell Smash Omastar.</p> <p>Due to the fact that Gurdurr is more or less confined to using Bulk Up, Drain Punch, and Mach Punch, or it risks becoming outclassed by the other Fighting-types of the tier, the only flexibility it retains lies in the coverage move it uses. Ice Punch is one option, as it retains solid neutral coverage alongside Drain Punch and remains Gurdurr's best bet at breaking through Amoonguss, but the trade-off of being significantly more vulnerable to Slowking, Qwilfish, and Moltres is often reason enough to avoid it without a very capable defensive core supporting Gurdurr. On the other hand, Rock Slide allows Gurdurr to retain similarly solid neutral coverage while allowing it to more effectively take on Bug-types and OHKO Moltres on the switch, but it doesn't help Gurdurr overcome any of its more traditional defensive counters.</p> <p>One of the most important partners to consider for Gurdurr is a Pursuit user; due to the fact that the RU tier shelters a plethora of durable Psychic- and Ghost-types—all of whom give Gurdurr headaches—it is nearly mandatory to carry Pursuit support in order to open a window for Gurdurr to sweep. Considering its ability to effectively combat Gallade in addition to other Psychic- and Ghost-types, Spiritomb is often the most optimal teammate for this purpose, but both Absol and Escavalier are also effective in this role if Gallade is already well-covered. However, while most Ghost- and Psychic-types are covered fairly handily by these means, Spiritomb, particularly the defensive set, can prove a difficult obstacle for Gurdurr to overcome, and having teammates to properly capitalize upon it is encouraged; specially based Fire-types, such as Moltres and Magmortar, can comfortably switch into defensive Spiritomb (being immune to Will-O-Wisp and taking minimal damage from Foul Play) and threaten to 2HKO with their STAB attacks, while Roselia can easily set up entry hazards against Spiritomb, recovering the damage it inflicts with Rest. These Pokemon are also very capable of threatening bothersome physical walls, namely Tangrowth and Alomomola, whom impede Gurdurr indefinitely. Slowking makes a quality partner for Gurdurr as well, being capable of stomaching most of the strong specially based attacks aimed at Gurdurr, while in return baiting Dark- and Bug-types for Gurdurr to set up on. Moreover, due to Slowking's versatility as a Pokemon, it is capable of supporting Gurdurr in a variety of ways to benefit the playstyle used, whether it be spreading burns on Psychic-types with Scald, baiting and KOing Tangrowth with Fire Blast, or even opening up a more comfortable sweep for Gurdurr with Trick Room.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>From the dawn of RU to the present day, Lilligant has been a top-tier threat. Excellent Special Attack and decent Speed combined with Quiver Dance make it a formidable sweeper after just a turn of boosting. Furthermore, it has access to the deadly Sleep Powder, allowing it to disable a surefire counter or provide extra setup opportunities. Unfortunately, it's not all a walk in the park for our flowery queen. Lilligant's mono-Grass typing leaves it with bad STAB coverage and weaknesses to common attacking types. Furthermore, its lack of secondary attacking options means it must rely on Hidden Power, which limits its ability to sweep. Despite these flaws, Lilligant is very dangerous once its checks and counters are removed and should always be played around carefully.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice hits Dragon-types like Druddigon, but otherwise offers poor coverage as it leaves Lilligant helpless against both Fire- and Steel-types. Leftovers is another interesting option, trading an immediate power boost for passive healing, which lets Lilligant set up more consistently. One can opt for a bulky spread of 252 HP / 188 Def / 68 Spe with a Timid nature to set up more easily, but it is usually not worth the loss in power. Lilligant can make good use of Choice Scarf or Choice Specs, utilizing moves such as Leaf Storm and Healing Wish. A Sunny Day set taking advantage of Chlorophyll could work, but without dedicated sun, Quiver Dance is more effective, and in sun, a more powerful sweeper like Sawsbuck or Victreebel is a better choice in its stead. Lilligant has various support options, including Aromatherapy, Healing Wish, Leech Seed, and Synthesis as well as the less conventional Light Screen and Stun Spore. Sadly, its bulk is rather subpar for a purely defensive set, and it is prone to being outclassed by fellow Grass-types like Tangrowth and Ferroseed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Because of Lilligant's reliance on Hidden Power for coverage, many Pokemon wall it by virtue of their typing alone. Fire-types come in freely if Lilligant lacks a Rock-type move—notable examples are Magmortar, who is even immune to Sleep Powder with Vital Spirit, and Emboar, who can tank any hit and OHKO with Flare Blitz. Likewise, if Lilligant is using Hidden Power Rock, Steel- and Grass-types switch in with little worry. Roselia and Amoonguss are bulky enough to take even Hidden Power Fire and can hit Lilligant with Sludge Bomb. Escavalier can use Sleep Talk to OHKO Lilligant and walls it if it lacks Hidden Power Fire; other Steel-types like Klinklang also accomplish the same thing. As Lilligant rarely carries Hidden Power Ice, Druddigon can almost always phaze it out or outright KO it. Sap Sippers such as Bouffalant, Miltank, and Sawsbuck gain an Attack boost from Giga Drain and Sleep Powder and care little about Lilligant's common coverage moves with the exception of Hidden Power Fire in Sawsbuck's case, while Drapion has the bulk to survive most hits and deals heavy damage back. Gallade takes even a +1 Giga Drain and can avoid sleep with a Lum Berry, while Choice Scarf Primeape bypasses sleep altogether with Vital Spirit.</p> <p>Lilligant also has a fair share of defensive checks. Clefable is not 2HKOed by +1 Giga Drain and can stop it with status moves. Mandibuzz will take heavy damage from a possible Hidden Power Rock, but can use Whirlwind to reset Lilligant's boosts. Any bulky wall with Thunder Wave that can survive a hit can cripple Lilligant because it relies on Speed to sweep; paralysis is a dead stop. Cryogonal makes another excellent counter, taking hits with ease thanks to its phenomenal special bulk, as well as having access to Haze and Ice Beam.</p> ",

        "name": "Quiver Dance",
        "description": "<p>Lilligant's stats make it a perfect user of Quiver Dance, being tailor-made for a move that raises its Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed one stage. As an added bonus, Lilligant also has access to Sleep Powder, enabling it to remove a troublesome check or counter as it switches in. These turns of sleep also create free opportunities to set up more. Giga Drain is Lilligant's most reliable STAB move and heals it in the process. Hidden Power Rock nets pretty good coverage alongside Giga Drain, hitting Fire-, Flying-, and Bug-types super effectively—such as Moltres and Entei—but misses out on Grass- and Steel-types. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire hits Pokemon of these types, including Rotom-C and Escavalier, while also nailing Bug-types. It is especially useful early-game, when it can be used to lure out these Pokemon and remove them. Unfortunately, using it leaves Lilligant vulnerable to opposing Fire-types.</p> <p>The EVs on this set are rather straightforward: Special Attack and Speed are maximized to capitalize on Quiver Dance's boosts. A Timid nature is necessary to outpace various Pokemon just below Lilligant's Speed tier, including Choice Scarf Pinsir and Rotom-F at +1. Life Orb is naturally the item of choice, as the KOs it ensures are important considering Lilligant struggles to take a hit. That said, Lum Berry is an interesting alternative, offering a nice one-time save from otherwise crippling status such as Uxie's Thunder Wave or Slowking's Toxic. Chlorophyll is the most useful ability, enabling Lilligant to revenge kill Sunny Day sweepers like Victreebel. Substitute over Sleep Powder turns Pokemon like Slowking into setup fodder, allowing Lilligant to dodge status and obtain multiple boosts. However, it loses the ability to put an enemy to sleep, meaning this set plays very differently from the standard Quiver Dance set. Petal Dance is worth a mention along with the Own Tempo ability, but Grass is a bad type to be locked into and makes it even easier to revenge kill. That being said, the power boost is fantastic—Petal Dance can even 2HKO Pokemon that resist it like Entei at +1.</p> <p>Generally, Lilligant fits well in Fire / Water / Grass cores as these give it teammates that can take on Pokemon that trouble it. With Hidden Power Fire, Fire-types like Moltres and Entei wall Lilligant; therefore, a strong Water-type, such as Kabutops, that can remove these foes is very useful. When running Hidden Power Rock, Grass- and Steel-types come in easily, so the Fire-types mentioned earlier pair well with Lilligant. A lack of a Fire-type move also makes Lilligant Escavalier bait, so a Pokemon like Qwilfish is a good teammate to tank its hits. Hidden Power Rock is better when using Lilligant late-game to hit the more common Fire- and Flying-types, as Lilligant can often beat Grass-types one-on-one regardless.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<p>Thanks to Lilligant's access to Quiver Dance and the fact that such a set is incredibly difficult to stop, most people often forget that Lilligant isn't necessarily limited to just being a Quiver Dance sweeper. By slapping a Choice Scarf on it, Lilligant becomes capable of far more than just acting as a simple setup sweeper. Thanks to its blistering Speed with a Choice Scarf attached, Lilligant is able to pull off certain support moves that it would otherwise be unable to do with its mediocre defenses, which allows it to support its teammates more effectively. Furthermore, although the lack of Quiver Dance will limit Lilligant's damage output, its naturally potent Special Attack stat still lets it dish out serious damage with its most powerful STAB attacks, both of which are generally not used on a Quiver Dance-based set.</p> <p>Of the moves listed on this set, Sleep Powder is easily the most important. Thanks to the extra Speed boost provided by Choice Scarf, Sleep Powder is capable of serving a variety of new, useful purposes that Lilligant would otherwise be unable to use it for. For example, because Lilligant is able to outspeed almost every unboosted Pokemon in the RU metagame, and it can be used in the lead position to shut down virtually every hazard setter in the tier right on the first turn, so long as you do not get unlucky or they use the rare Lum Berry. Furthermore, the basically guaranteed use of Sleep Powder makes Lilligant an incredibly powerful force; putting an opponent to sleep right at the beginning of the game is very useful as long as they don't have a dedicated sleep absorber and/or you don't get unlucky. It will easily give you great early-game momentum.</p> <p>Because Sleep Powder makes Lilligant the incredibly powerful force it is early-game, the rest of the set is designed to make Lilligant strong during the mid- or late-game after Sleep Powder has been used. Leaf Storm, coupled with Lilligant's incredible base 110 Special Attack, is the main move that gives Lilligant much of its mid-game utility. Its humongous power in tandem with Lilligant's blistering Speed lets Lilligant act as a great revenge killer to boosting sweepers such as Rock Polish Aggron. Hidden Power Rock and Hidden Power Fire are used to support Lilligant's revenge killing prowess by giving it the coverage to hit specific troublesome threats super effectively. Hidden Power Rock handles Sigilyph, Entei, Moltres, Magmortar, and Scyther, while also giving Lilligant some nice neutral coverage, while Hidden Power Fire hits Durant, Escavalier, Klinklang, Magneton, Rotom-C, and Sceptile hard. Note that a neutral Leaf Storm still hits harder than a 2x super effective Hidden Power, so Leaf Storm is still Lilligant's best option in most cases. However, while the combination of Leaf Storm and Lilligant's Hidden Power of choice will let it excel mid-game, it is Healing Wish that makes Lilligant so incredibly useful late-game. When Lilligant is at low health, it can use Healing Wish to bring back a weakened partner to full health, which can easily cause the game to end right then and there as that fully-healed Pokemon tears through the opponent's weakened team.</p> <p>With max Speed investment and a Timid nature, Lilligant is capable of outspeeding and threatening Choice Scarf-wielding Pokemon such as Rotom-C, while max Special Attack is used to make Leaf Storm and the Hidden Power of choice hit as hard as possible. If these Pokemon aren't especially problematic for your team, you can opt to use a Modest nature to make Leaf Storm all the more devastating. Alternatively, if you find that Lilligant merely serves more of a supportive role for your team, and you rarely end up using its offensive options, feel free to shift the Special Attack EVs into HP in order to let Lilligant last longer throughout the match.</p> <p>As stated previously, Lilligant actually has a surprisingly broad support movepool that is often neglected, and with a Choice Scarf attached, many of these options become viable; even though Healing Wish is generally the best out of these, its other options should not be discounted. In particular, Stun Spore is an excellent move that can be used in the last slot. Thanks to Lilligant's incredible Speed, Lilligant will almost always be able to use Stun Spore during the match, and this can be used a myriad of ways. For example, Stun Spore can be used to cripple fast threats that are rampaging through your team, so long as Lilligant can outspeed them with a Choice Scarf, thus preventing them from continuing their sweep. Alternatively, Stun Spore can be used to hit sleep absorbers that might try to switch into Sleep Powder, which lets you preserve Sleep Powder so you can use it later in the match. If support moves are not your thing, and you are using this variant of Lilligant more offensively, Giga Drain can be used in the last slot to give Lilligant a reliable STAB move that has no drawbacks, until the time comes to use the primary ones listed on this set. Petal Dance is also an option over Leaf Storm if you want to give Lilligant the ability to sweep, although this greatly limits its ability to revenge kill threats.</p> <p>This set is great at doing three main jobs for your team: stopping entry hazards from going up early in the match, nabbing a free switch in for one of your Pokemon while giving them to the opportunity to set up, and revenge killing annoying Rock-, Water-, and Ground-type threats. Therefore, Pokemon that despise entry hazards and can easily begin to decimate the opponent after a single free switch in are the best partners for this set. Notably, Zangoose and Swellow work particularly well. Both of these Pokemon absolutely despise entry hazards as they shorten their lifespan greatly, and the free switch that Lilligant is able to provide is more than enough of an opportunity for them to tear through the opponent's team with their boosted STAB Facades. Lilligant can even remove the likes of Alomomola, Steelix, and Regirock, which can all give these two Pokemon severe issues, and it can also lure out and destroy Escavalier with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <p>However, this variant of Lilligant does have some issues. Grass-types, such as Amoonguss and Roselia, shrug off anything Lilligant throws at them, so if Sleep Powder has already been used up and these Pokemon are still alive, Lilligant's best choice will be to sacrifice itself with Healing Wish. Thus, you probably want to use Pokemon that are capable of destroying Grass-types with ease. Choice Band Entei, Emboar, and Moltres are all particularly good choices for this job; Lilligant's ability to deny early entry hazards benefits Moltres and Entei greatly, and Healing Wish helps these Pokemon very much as well. Because Emboar and Entei will be taking plenty of recoil damage from Flare Blitz, Healing Wish can help rid them of that residual damage late-game, while Healing Wish can give Moltres that one last switch in if Stealth Rock is up, which could be all it needs to take out the opponent's last few Pokemon. Sap Sipper Pokemon such as Miltank and Bouffalant might also be troublesome as they are immune to both Sleep Powder and Leaf Storm, so a Ghost-type such as Spiritomb or Rotom can be useful to help combat them.</p> "

  "Basculin": {
    "overview": "<p>Although Basculin's mediocre stats seem to estrange it as a viable option in the RU tier, it has a couple of redeeming qualities that should not be overlooked, primarily its excellent ability in Adaptability. Adaptability turns Basculin's Water-type STAB attacks into powerful weapons, making it an effective revenge killer with its strong priority Aqua Jet, as well as smashing anything that doesn't resist Water-type moves with Waterfall. In addition, access to new coverage moves in Superpower and, most importantly, Zen Headbutt, via BW2 move tutors expands Basculin's otherwise sparse movepool. However, the fighting fish faces stiff competition from other offensive Water-types such as Feraligatr and Kabutops, which have greater bulk as well as the ability to boost their Attack with Swords Dance. Basculin also struggles to break through many common defensive Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Slowking, therefore limiting its effectiveness.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Basculin's movepool is quite shallow. It has access to Taunt, which could be useful to shut down defensive Pokemon, but is unwise on a Choiced Set. Aqua Tail is an option over Waterfall, but the decrease in accuracy, as well as the loss of Waterfall's handy flinch chance, is not worth the slight boost in power. A Life Orb can be used to switch moves, although the recoil makes Basculin easier to revenge kill, and the drop in power is noticeable. Finally, Mold Breaker allows Basculin to ignore troublesome abilities such as Water Absorb and Sturdy, but the substantial power decrease means that Adaptability is nearly always the wiser choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Generally speaking, Pokemon that can stomach Basculin's strong Water-type STAB attacks make for good checks and counters. Tangrowth and Alomomola can easily switch into any attack, heal any damage with Regenerator, and in Tangrowth's case, KO with its Grass-type STAB moves or cripple something with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Qwilfish can also handle Water-type attacks while setting up Spikes to hurt Basculin's hit-and-run style, and also avoids the 2HKO from Zen Headbutt thanks to Intimidate. Similarly, Poliwrath is immune to Waterfall and is not 2HKOed by Zen Headbutt, and can retaliate with strong Fighting-type attacks. Druddigon can stomach any single hit and KO in return, and Amoonguss and Slowking can heal with Regenerator while fearing only Zen Headbutt and Crunch, respectively. Exploiting Basculin's average Speed is a good way to check the hostile fish; Galvantula, Cinccino, Accelgor, and Sceptile are naturally faster and can KO with their strong STAB attacks, though it must be noted that most of these fast and frail checks take a hefty chunk of damage from Aqua Jet.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>This set aims for immediate power, using Adaptability-boosted Waterfalls and Aqua Jets to break down walls and revenge kill opposing sweepers. Waterfall hits extremely hard with a Choice Band equipped, reaching a Base Power of 160 thanks to Adaptability. Aqua Jet is an important priority STAB move that allows Basculin to revenge kill boosted sweepers, or clean up a weakened team late-game, as well as strike Choice Scarf users before they can land a hit of their own. The ability to hit common switch-ins such as Amoonguss, Qwilfish, and Poliwrath harder than Basculin's Water-type STAB move of choice makes Zen Headbutt an important move, while Crunch is preferred in the final slot to prevent Slowking from walling the set completely; Superpower is another option to defeat Ferroseed.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred in order to outspeed important threats such as Adamant Entei, Sigilyph, and Rotom. As far as alternate moves go, Double-Edge is an option for decent neutral coverage, and Ice Beam can surprise physical walls expecting a Waterfall, Tangrowth in particular.</p> <p>Basculin appreciates teammates that can switch into Electric- and Grass-type attacks. Rotom-C and Sceptile make for good partners as they resist these types and can threaten bulky Water-types like Slowking and Alomomola with their STAB attacks. In return Basculin can threaten Fire-types such as Typhlosion, though its frailty means that it cannot switch into even resisted hits; Rotom-C's Volt Switch can often allow Basculin to come in safely. Similarly, Fire-types which can check Grass-type Pokemon like Tangrowth and Amoonguss make for nice teammates. Emboar and Moltres are good examples, with the former often able to absorb sleep-inducing moves if it carries Sleep Talk. Basculin can defeat Rock-types such as Aerodactyl and Rhydon which trouble these Pokemon; but again, it must avoid switching directly in.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is particularly helpful to wear down opposing Pokemon; two layers of Spikes support allows Basculin to potentially 2HKO Poliwrath as it switches in, making Ferroseed or Roselia good options. Roselia is a particularly good partner as it can completely stop Alomomola; Roselia can safely set up Spikes and recover HP with Giga Drain, while being immune to Toxic and not fearing burns from Scald thanks to Natural Cure. They can also easily take Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Basculin, and in particular check Sceptile and Lilligant well.</p> "

  "Scraggy": {
    "overview": "<p>Don't let Scraggy's NFE status fool you into thinking that it's not a threat, as Scraggy is far from helpless on the battlefield. While Scraggy's base stats might not look outstanding, or even decent at first, they're just enough for it to get the job done, and Scraggy has unique attributes that further augment its ability and help it stand out from the rest of the crowd, most notably its unresisted STAB combination. Scraggy also boasts two excellent boosting moves in Dragon Dance and Bulk Up, and while at first Scraggy's Attack stat looks too low to effectively utilize them, its aforementioned STAB combination and access to a high Base Power move in High Jump Kick make up for this, turning Scraggy into a dangerous threat after a boost. In addition, Scraggy possesses an excellent ability in Shed Skin, making it resistant to dangerous status conditions and allowing it to set up on a wider variety of Pokemon with little fear. Scraggy is not without its flaws, however; while Scraggy's Speed stat is acceptable after a Dragon Dance, beating out positive nature base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Drapion and Jynx, it's still somewhat vulnerable to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Sceptile and Durant, somewhat reducing its effectiveness. Likewise, Scraggy's Bulk Up set is very hard to KO outright, but opponents can break through it with strong Fighting- and Flying-type moves. In the end, Scraggy isn't a top threat by any means, but underestimating it is a grave mistake.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of its STAB attacks, Scraggy has quite a wide offensive movepool that it can use to its advantage; these include the elemental punches, Stone Edge, and Zen Headbutt. These moves can be useful at times for hitting certain opponents such as Moltres, Escavalier, and Amoonguss harder, but Scraggy doesn't really need them in the end because of the perfect coverage its STABs provide. Scraggy could also run a purely defensive set with Intimidate, functioning as a bulky pivot while using moves such as Toxic, Knock Off, Roar, Super Fang, and Foul Play to mess with the opposition, but the lack of reliable recovery outside of Drain Punch limits its effectiveness. Lastly, Taunt is an option on the Dragon Dance set to make setting up on defensive Pokemon even easier while also stopping the opponent from doing things such as setting up hazards or phazing, but Scraggy has trouble finding a moveslot for it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Poliwrath is the best counter to Scraggy available; it has the physical bulk to take even boosted High Jump Kicks from the little lizard and can phaze Scraggy out with a super effective Circle Throw in return. However, Poliwrath has trouble breaking through Bulk Up Scraggy if it's the last Pokemon. Qwilfish makes a good check to Scraggy as well, possessing a handy resistance to Scraggy's Fighting-type moves and using either Taunt or Haze to stop Scraggy from accumulating any more boosts, eventually wearing it out with Waterfall. Quagsire has enough physical bulk to take a High Jump Kick from Scraggy, has Unaware to ignore any boosts Scraggy might have under its belt, and can retaliate with Earthquake. Amoonguss resists Scraggy's Fighting-type attacks, has the physical bulk to take a Crunch, and can recover HP by switching out when needed thanks to Regenerator; Amoonguss struggles against the Bulk Up set if it lacks Clear Smog, though. Moltres makes a good check to Scraggy as long as Stealth Rock isn't up, but is OHKOed by a +1 Crunch if the Scraggy user manages to set up Stealth Rock, making it a somewhat shaky counter. Pokemon that carry Trick or Switcheroo, such as Rotom-C and Manectric, can remove Scraggy's Eviolite and replace it with an undesirable item such as a Choice Scarf, limiting its effectiveness for the rest of the match. Outside of these Pokemon and moves, there are some other checks to Scraggy that depend on the set, beating one rather easily while struggling with the other. If all else fails, faster Pokemon, including Choice Scarf Emboar, Sceptile, Accelgor, and Durant, can revenge kill Dragon Dance Scraggy even after a boost. Likewise, Pokemon with powerful Fighting- and Flying-types moves such as Gallade, Braviary, and Hitmonlee can break through Bulk Up Scraggy before it becomes too dangerous.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>While Scraggy isn't the fastest or most powerful Pokemon around, it's still an effective user of Dragon Dance. Because of Scraggy's respectable bulk with Eviolite factored in, and excellent ability in Shed Skin, it's capable of setting up on various defensive Pokemon with ease, notably Uxie, Lanturn, and Spiritomb. It can then use its excellent STAB combination to plow through the opposing team. High Jump Kick is Scraggy's most powerful STAB attack, hitting an absolutely massive 130 Base Power even without STAB factored in. This is the move Scraggy will be using whenever it needs to break through bulkier Pokemon quickly like Druddigon. Be careful when using High Jump Kick, though, as any team with a Ghost-type or Protect user can take advantage of it if you don't play carefully. On the other hand, Drain Punch provides Scraggy with a weaker, more consistent STAB move to use when it can't risk using High Jump Kick or doesn't need the extra power. Drain Punch also gives Scraggy some nice HP recovery, which is especially significant because of Scraggy's relatively low HP stat and respectable defenses. Crunch rounds out Scraggy's coverage, giving it an effective way to get past bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Spiritomb, Uxie, and Slowking.</p> <p>The EV spread used here is pretty straightforward: they maximize Scraggy's damage output, while also making sure it can outrun positive nature base 95 Speed Pokemon, such as Drapion and Jynx, at +1, as well as Timid Accelgor at +2. An Adamant nature can be used if you think Scraggy needs a bit more power behind its attacks, but keep in mind that this makes Scraggy significantly slower as well, not even being able to outpace Adamant Entei without the extra Speed boost provided by a Jolly nature. While Shed Skin is an incredibly useful ability for Scraggy, both Intimidate and Moxie are viable options as well. Intimidate cuts the opponent's Attack stat upon switch in, possibly netting Scraggy a free boost, and also allows Scraggy to fodder itself as an emergency stop to a potentially dangerous opponent. Moxie increases Scraggy's Attack stat every time it scores a KO, punishing the opponent for trying to sacrifice something to Scraggy. However, its usefulness is short-lived, because after the first KO or two, Moxie's Attack boosts start becoming overkill, and status resistance is usually more helpful.</p> <p>Like any offensive Pokemon, Scraggy appreciates hazards support to help it score KOs more easily. Qwilfish is an excellent option for hazards support, having the typing and bulk to set up multiple layers of Spikes while checking some of the Fighting-types that trouble Scraggy such as Hitmonlee and Emboar. Furthermore, Qwilfish can use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis, letting Scraggy sweep with fewer boosts. Lastly, Qwilfish's Intimidate can cushion against various physical attackers, making it easier for Scraggy to grab a Dragon Dance. In return, Scraggy can grab a free boost on some of the Psychic-types that prey on Qwilfish's low Special Defense and Poison typing, switching in on their attacks with complete impunity due to its Dark typing. Uxie is a good option for hazards support as well, setting up Stealth Rock for Scraggy while checking the Fighting-types Scraggy struggles with and spreading paralysis just like Qwilfish.</p> <p>Dual screens work well with Dragon Dance Scraggy, augmenting its already good bulk and making it significantly easier for Scraggy to accumulate multiple boosts, especially in conjunction with Shed Skin. Once again, Uxie makes an excellent teammate for Scraggy, as it's arguably the best user of dual screens in the entire tier, with the bulk to set up multiple times in a match and even access to Memento to get Scraggy in for free. Outside of Uxie, Gardevoir, Mesprit, and even Audino can serve as effective users of dual screens, each having their own advantages and disadvantages. Although Scraggy's excellent dual STABs and Shed Skin ability give it the advantage over most defensive Pokemon, Scraggy still struggles with a few physically bulky threats such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, Poliwrath, and Quagsire, making a Pokemon that can break through them an excellent option for a teammate. Gallade and Moltres both perform this role admirably, being able to switch in on at least two of the four offenders and pose a significant threat in return with a combination of raw power and coverage. Likewise, Scraggy can use many of both Moltres's and Gallade's checks as setup bait, taking advantage of Lanturn, Regirock, and Spiritomb, respectively.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<p>Scraggy's impressive Eviolite-boosted bulk, access to Shed Skin, and ability to use Drain Punch to damage the opponent while restoring its health in one move all make Scraggy a good user of Bulk Up. This set has an even easier time setting up on common defensive Pokemon such as Lanturn than the Dragon Dance set does thanks to the defensive investment. Bulk Up bolsters Scraggy's Defense stat to impressive levels while simultaneously increasing its Attack, turning it into a powerful and bulky threat in no time. Drain Punch is easily Scraggy's most reliable STAB move, and the extra HP recovery that it gives is certainly appreciated on a set like this, especially given that Scraggy's HP stat is very low, maximizing the recovery it gets from using the move. Crunch is Scraggy's best secondary STAB move for hitting the bulky Fighting-type resists such as Uxie, Slowking, Rotom, and Spiritomb. Rest gives Scraggy an effective way to fully restore its health at any time especially because Shed Skin makes Rest significantly more reliable than it is when used by other Pokemon such as Poliwrath.</p> <p>To show how bulky Scraggy is, here are a few damage calculations against some common RU Pokemon:</p> <ul> <li>0 SpA Slowking Scald: 17.1% - 20.72% <li>252+ SpA Slowking Surf: 28.61% - 33.88%</li> <li>0 SpA Cryogonal Ice Beam: 19.73% - 23.68%</li> <li>252 SpA Icicle Plate Cryogonal Ice Beam: 30.59% - 35.85%</li> <li>252 Atk Life Orb Drapion Poison Jab: 38.81% - 46.05</li> <li>252 SpA Choice Specs Mesprit Thunderbolt: 26.97% - 31.9%</li> <li>252 SpA Life Orb Rotom Thunderbolt: 32.56% - 38.81%</li> </ul> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Scraggy's special bulk, since Bulk Up shores up Scraggy's Defense stat, and also lets Scraggy outpace minimum Speed Tangrowth and Piloswine. If you feel Scraggy needs some more power behind its attacks, High Jump Kick is an option over Drain Punch to greatly increase its damage output, but Drain Punch has better synergy with the rest of this set due to its perfect accuracy and recovery. Likewise, Payback is an option over Crunch if you want Scraggy to have a stronger Dark-type STAB, but Payback is only stronger against opponents that are faster than Scraggy, and while Scraggy is in fact quite slow, many important bulky Ghost- and Psychic-types, such as Slowking and Spiritomb, are actually slower than it, so Crunch's consistency is generally more useful. Note that you shouldn't try to sweep with Scraggy early on in the match, as you'll have a much harder time being successful if you attempt to do so. Bulk Up Scraggy functions best mid-game and late-game, when its checks and counters are weakened or eliminated, and should be treated as such. Even though Scraggy is incredibly hard to KO with a Bulk Up under its belt, Pokemon with powerful Fighting- and Flying-type moves such as Gallade, Moltres, Braviary, and Emboar can still break through it, so checks to them make good teammates. Uxie, Spiritomb, Qwilfish, and Slowking can check the Fighting-type Pokemon that trouble Scraggy, while Rhydon, Regirock, and Lanturn check the various Flying-types that can break through Scraggy's defenses. If you do use Rhydon or Regirock, though, a check to Fighting-types is that much more important.</p> "

Its good Special Attack and Speed give it scary offensive potential. BW2 made it even better, as Heat Wave was added to its arsenal, making an offensive set more viable and not as easily walled. Sigilyph can also perform a defensively inclined role with Cosmic Power, Roost, and Stored Power to effectively deal damage. It's not absolutely flawless, however. Sigilyph is not very bulky before setting up, with only 72/80/80 defenses and a multitude of common weaknesses. Don't let that deter you from using Sigilyph, though, because it can be a very effective Pokemon when given the right circumstances.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sigilyph has Thunder Wave, which can be useful for spreading paralysis around, but it is better left to spreading burns or hitting opposing Pokemon hard. Hypnosis is another move in its arsenal, but it has shaky accuracy and Sigilyph has better moves to work with. Sigilyph can set up dual screens, but Uxie can do the job much better with more overall bulk and Memento. A Substitute + Calm Mind set can work to some degree, but it is usually better left to Uxie as well, which has much better bulk. Sigilyph has some other interesting options, such as Ice Beam, but it provides little use or coverage. Tinted Lens could be used over Magic Guard for the extra power to break through resists, but generally the immunity to Life Orb and Stealth Rock damage is more useful. A Choice Scarf set can be used with Tinted Lens, but generally a Life Orb set is more useful on offensive terms.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Spiritomb is a big irritant to any of Sigilyph's sets as it has the substantial bulk to take any hit Sigilyph throws at it and can Pursuit trap Sigilyph. The Calm Mind variant can easily set up on Cosmic Power Sigilyph, as it doesn't mind a burn thanks to Rest and is immune to Stored Power. Bulky Psychic-types, such as Uxie and Slowking, can take any hit Sigilyph throws at them and cripple it with Thunder Wave. They can also outlast the Cosmic Power set thanks to their enormous special bulk, and Slowking has Slack Off to recover any damage Sigilyph may do to it. A specially defensive Drapion with Rest can usually beat any Sigilyph variant, as it will take any hit Sigilyph can throw at it and Rest off the burns that Sigilyph tries to cripple it with. Other Pokemon with good special bulk such as Clefable and Cryogonal can take hits from offensive variants but must be wary of Psyshock. Lanturn also makes a good counter to any offensive sets lacking Energy Ball thanks to its good special bulk and can hit Sigilyph with a super effective Thunderbolt. Dark-types, such as Absol or offensively oriented Drapion variants, are immune to Psychic and can usually nail Sigilyph very hard with their Dark STAB, but must be wary of Air Slash, which can effectively OHKO both of them after some entry hazard damage. Fire-types, such as Entei or Magmortar, can easily switch into the Cosmic Power set and hit Sigilyph hard with a strong Fire STAB. However, most Fire-types will not enjoy taking a hit from an offensively inclined Sigilyph. Fast Pokemon such as Cinccino and Aerodactyl can hit Sigilyph hard with Rock Blast or Stone Edge, respectively, while Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-C can outspeed and nail Sigilyph with a strong move. Powerful moves from Pokemon will usually deal out massive amounts of damage to Sigilyph, as its average bulk cannot usually keep it sturdy without any sort of boost.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive",
        "description": "<p>This is by far Sigilyph's best set. With no Life Orb recoil thanks to Magic Guard, Sigilyph can become a powerful offensive threat while staying healthy throughout the match. The choice between Psychic and Psyshock is up to personal preference. Psyshock hits special walls such as Clefable and Cryogonal on their weaker physical defense, while Psychic hits neutral targets harder. Heat Wave is an essential coverage move that hits Escavalier, Steelix, and Ferroseed for super effective damage. The third slot is a toss-up between Air Slash and Energy Ball. Air Slash hits Dark-types for major damage, usually 2HKOing them, while Energy Ball hits Slowking, Crawdaunt, Rhydon, and Lanturn super effectively. Roost provides reliable recovery so that Sigilyph can stay healthy.</p> <p>The EVs allow Sigilyph to get the most out of its offensive capabilities. A Timid nature is chosen to maximize Sigilyph's Speed, which is unique and allows Sigilyph to outspeed Pokemon such as Drapion and Lilligant. Life Orb is the primary item, and because of Magic Guard its recoil is negated, giving Sigilyph a free 30% power boost. Dark Pulse could be used to hit Uxie and Slowking for super effective damage, but has little use otherwise.</p> <p>This set is vulnerable to Dark-types such as Spiritomb and cannot break through Uxie and Slowking easily, so Pokemon such as Escavalier or Durant can work as partners to severely damage them. In return, Sigilyph can dent Poliwrath and Qwilfish, common answers to Durant and Escavalier. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Smeargle and Crustle can make sweeping easier by wearing down Sigilyph's common switch-ins. For example, Slowking is 2HKOed by Energy Ball after switching into Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Spiritomb can also make a fine partner for Sigilyph, as it nicely spinblocks and Pursuit traps Slowking, Uxie, and Cryogonal. Spiritomb can also take hits from Normal-types, such as Cinccino and Tauros, which are typically sent in to revenge kill Sigilyph.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Cosmic Power",
        "description": "<p>This set is what Sigilyph is most known for. A Cosmic Power set can annoy teams with its combination of decent speed, ability to burn physical attackers, and a move that boosts both of Sigilyph's defenses. Cosmic Power boosts Sigilyph's decent defenses to a point where it is very hard to kill, even with super effective hits. Roost provides reliable recovery so that Sigilyph can stay healthy and cushion weaker Electric- and Ice-type moves. Psycho Shift in conjunction with a Flame Orb will burn physical attackers, most importantly Dark-types. This is because Sigilyph can outlast certain Dark-types thanks to their physically offensive nature. Stored Power rounds up the set, as it is the best way to damage an opponent's team, and after a few boosts Sigilyph can be on its way to a potential sweep.</p> <p>The EV spread invests in Sigilyph's bulk as much as possible while outspeeding max Speed Drapion in order to burn it before it threatens with a super effective Crunch. Because of its unique ability, Sigilyph will not take any damage from the burn inflicted by its Flame Orb and can cripple physical attackers with Psycho Shift. Air Slash could be used for damaging Dark-types, but burning them is more effective. Most Dark-types are physically oriented, so Sigilyph can outstall them with a couple of boosts under its belt, while Air Slash provides a weak attack with little use but to hit anything immune to Stored Power. Calm Mind can boost its Special Attack, but it will miss the Defense boost that Cosmic Power offers. Stored Power will typically wipe out a team after many boosts, so boosting Sigilyph's Special Attack is not needed. Whirlwind is another option it can run, as many of the Pokemon trying to phaze Sigilyph will be naturally slower than it, so it's an effective way of keeping its boosts under its belt. However, Whirlwind should only be used with entry hazards, since if a Pokemon tries to constantly phaze Sigilyph the latter will win out thanks to the damage that racks up.</p> <p>Calm Mind Spiritomb is an absolute nightmare for this set, as it doesn't mind a burn thanks to Rest and can use Sigilyph as setup fodder. Slowking and Mandibuzz can also be a nuisance, as they have reliable recovery in Slack Off and Roost. Mandibuzz is immune to Stored Power as well, and Slowking can take multiple Stored Powers and outstall Sigilyph. Klinklang and Aggron can easily switch into Spiritomb thanks to their Steel typing. Aggron can heavily damage Spiritomb and Mandibuzz, and Klinklang can set up on Spiritomb with Shift Gear. Both Pokemon also bait in Fighting- and Ground-type moves, which can give Sigilyph a way to easily set up. Choice Band Spiritomb itself makes a good partner, as it can Pursuit trap Slowking and Uxie, damaging them and clearing a path for Sigilyph to sweep. It can also absorb Tricks that Pokemon such as Rotom use to cripple Sigilyph. Powerful Fire-types, such as Entei and Choice Specs Typhlosion, are immune to burns and can muster enough power to 2HKO Sigilyph even after a Cosmic Power boost. Therefore, Pokemon such as Rhydon, Slowking, and Qwilfish make fantastic partners, as all can switch into the powerful Fire-type attacks thrown at Sigilyph with ease. Speaking of Fire-types, they make good partners for Sigilyph, as they can switch into a defensive Spiritomb with ease and severely damage it so that Sigilyph has more free rein later in the match. As this Sigilyph set lures in Dark-types and can burn them, Pokemon such as Archeops, Cinccino, and Kabutops can take advantage of a lack of a strong Sucker Punch that could otherwise prematurely end their sweep.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Calm Mind",
        "description": "<p>Even with a decent Special Attack that can plow through much of the metagame, Calm Mind is a fine option to boost Sigilyph's Special Attack to even more deadly levels. Calm Mind is the basis of this set, as it allows Sigilyph to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense to become a larger threat. The choice between Psyshock and Psychic is again up to personal preference. Psyshock can be used to hit special walls hard on their weaker physical side, while Psychic is a superior option in dealing out massive damage to neutral targets. Heat Wave is an essential move for hitting Escavalier as well as Steelix, as both Pokemon can comfortably take a Psychic. Roost rounds up the set, as it allows Sigilyph to remain in good shape throughout the match as well as ease the pressure of setting up on weak special attacking threats.</p> <p>The EVs are straightforward, as they try to get the most out of Sigilyph's offensive capabilities, and along with a Timid nature, Sigilyph can outspeed a large portion of the metagame. Life Orb is the preferred item, as it gives Sigilyph a boost in damage without recoil thanks to Magic Guard. A Flame Orb could be used in conjunction with Psycho Shift over Roost, making Sigilyph more self-sufficient in exchange for longevity, as well as giving it the ability to easily set up on Grass-types thanks to an immunity to sleep. This also allows Sigilyph to burn Dark-types and keep them from tearing through it. Whirlwind is another option that Sigilyph can run, as it allows it to win Calm Mind wars against Pokemon such as Uxie, as well as rack up entry hazard damage on common switch-ins such as Entei. As for other offensive options, Air Slash could be used as a secondary STAB move to destroy frailer Dark-type switch-ins such as Absol. Energy Ball is another coverage move that could work as it hits Slowking and Quagsire, but has little use otherwise. Both moves could go over Roost, but Roost provides the ability to set up with more ease and keeps Sigilyph healthy throughout the match.</p> <p>Spiritomb, Slowking, and Uxie are all very irritating to this set, as they have the ability to tank hits from Sigilyph. Spiritomb also threatens Sigilyph with a super effective Dark STAB while Slowking and Uxie can potentially paralyze Sigilyph and make it essentially worthless. Durant and Escavalier make good partners, as they hit most of Sigilyph's counters for heavy damage while Sigilyph can remove their counters, such as Poliwrath, with a swift Psychic. Choice Band Spiritomb can also make a nice partner, as it can Pursuit trap the Psychic-types that come in to wall Sigilyph as well as absorb Tricks thrown at it. It cannot be emphasized enough that Sigilyph needs Dark-types out of the way for this specific set, as Absol can KO it comfortably with a STAB Sucker Punch while Drapion can effectively wall Sigilyph. Therefore, Poliwrath makes a good partner because of its nifty resistance to Dark-type moves, effectively walling them to no end, and it can phaze them out with Circle Throw, which can rack up entry hazard damage. Speaking of entry hazards, support from Pokemon such as Smeargle, Crustle, and Qwilfish give Sigilyph the ability to nab KOes more comfortably. Qwilfish also has the added benefit of taking strong Flare Blitzes and Bug-type attacks aimed at Sigilyph.</p> "

  "Carracosta": {
    "overview": "<p>Carracosta is a commonly overlooked and unloved Pokemon in RU, lacking the effectiveness that other more common Pokemon that share its typing, such as Kabutops and Omastar, have. On the other hand, Carracosta definitely is solidly useful in its own right, with access to two excellent abilities that aide it in taking advantage of its strong offensive prowess. In addition, if Carracosta manages to set up, it can be incredibly difficult for many teams to stop due to its solid type coverage and priority in Aqua Jet. Sadly, Carracosta's typing gives it a number of flaws, most notably a weakness to Fighting-, Electric-, and Ground-types, all of which are fairly common in RU. Regardless, Carracosta is definitely a solid, if somewhat difficult to support, Pokemon that can be quite effective for a number of teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Carracosta has a wide number of options available. Aqua Tail can be used instead of Waterfall, giving Carracosta a slightly stronger STAB option at the cost of accuracy, although due to the possibility of a game changing miss, it's generally not recommended. On the flip side, Rock Slide is a usable choice over Stone Edge, but simply isn't strong enough to be as effective as a primary STAB. Earthquake manages to hit Drapion, Qwilfish, and Aggron, although they are handled by Stone Edge and Waterfall, respectively. Carracosta can potentially make use of a Choice Band set moderately effectively, although Kabutops usually outclasses it in that regard thanks to a higher Attack, Speed, and access to Rapid Spin. Defensive Carracosta can make use of Knock Off, stripping defensive Pokemon of their Leftovers and Eviolites, while knocking Choice items and Life Orbs away from more offensive Pokemon. Curse is another move that Carracosta can make use of, boosting its already solid Defense as well as its Attack. Due to its easily exploitable weaknesses, it is not as effective in sweeping or wallbreaking as Shell Smash, however. Carracosta can also pull off a purely specially based Shell Smash set, utilizing Hydro Pump, Ice Beam, and one of Ancient Power or Hidden Power, which can surprise many common switch-ins, but it is simply not strong enough to sweep off of Carracosta's average Special Attack. Finally, purely physically defensive Carracosta is certainly usable, although again, its weaknesses to many common offensive types are a bit of a letdown.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Despite its offensive prowess, Carracosta is relatively easy for many Pokemon to handle. Notably, Poliwrath will stop anything Carracosta throws at it barring the rare Hidden Power Grass before phazing away Carracosta's boosts with Circle Throw. Physically defensive Ferroseed can also take pretty much any attack from Carracosta other than the borderline nonexistent Hidden Power Fire. Quagsire can also wall any Carracosta lacking Hidden Power Grass, although it must be wary of the occasional Toxic from tank Carracosta. Many Grass-type Pokemon can easily beat Carracosta, with fast ones such as Sceptile outspeeding Jolly Carracosta even after a Shell Smash boost and bulkier Grass-types such as Tangrowth outright walling most Carracosta, although they must watch out for the occasional Ice Beam.</p> <p>While Aqua Jet makes Carracosta fairly difficult to revenge kill after a Shell Smash boost, there are a few Pokemon that are capable of accomplishing the feat. Choice Scarf Manectric is able to survive a boosted Aqua Jet provided Stealth Rock is not up and easily OHKOes Carracosta with Volt Switch or Thunderbolt. Rotom-C is another very solid answer, with Choice Scarf Rotom-C outspeeding boosted Carracosta and threatening it with any of its STAB options. A few bulky Pokemon are also capable of surviving attacks from Carracosta and beating it depending on its moveset. For example, both Rhydon and Steelix can live boosted Aqua Jets, although Steelix can never OHKO Solid Rock Carracosta, while purely defensive Rhydon only manages to do so after a layer of Stealth Rock and a round of Life Orb damage. However, both make viable checks to any Carracosta lacking Waterfall. Finally, a few priority users are able to pick off weakened Carracosta lacking Aqua Jet. Hitmonchan, for example, can solidly 2HKO Carracosta with Mach Punch, and both Spiritomb and Absol can do a fair amount of damage with Sucker Punch, although none of those three are particularly solid checks. Finally, in the worst case scenario, a team with solid enough offensive pressure is often capable of exploiting Carracosta's common weaknesses and preventing it from setting up.</p> ",

        "name": "Shell Smash",
        "description": "<p>Carracosta is one of the most effective physical or mixed Shell Smash users in RU. Thanks to its respectable base 108 Attack, Carracosta becomes a gargantuan powerhouse when boosted by Shell Smash. Stone Edge is Carracosta's main STAB option, hitting large portions of the metagame decently hard and allowing Carracosta to blow past bulky Water-types such as Slowking after a Shell Smash. Waterfall is the secondary STAB option available to Carracosta, hitting most Ground- and Steel-types much harder than Stone Edge, while also being more reliable. Aqua Jet rounds off Carracosta's moveset, allowing it to pick off Choice Scarf users and any weakened Pokemon that are faster than it. Ice Beam is another very usable option over Waterfall or Aqua Jet, letting Carracosta break through physically defensive Grass-types, most notably Tangrowth, that are capable of thoroughly manhandling any Carracosta lacking Ice Beam.</p> <p>If not using Ice Beam, Carracosta should generally use a purely physically offensive EV spread with max Attack and Speed. A Jolly nature is usually recommended over an Adamant Nature, as Carracosta is unable to outspeed positive nature max Speed base 100 Speed Pokemon if not using a Speed boosting nature itself. However, Adamant gives Carracosta significantly more power, most notably allowing it to always OHKO standard Slowking with Stone Edge after a Shell Smash boost. Carracosta is capable of always OHKOing physically defensive Tangrowth with Ice Beam even with a Special Attack decreasing nature; however, if specially defensive Tangrowth is an issue, a Naive nature can be used over Jolly, or Naughty over Adamant. However, EVs should generally not be moved from Speed or Attack into Special Attack, as Ice Beam only notably hits Tangrowth and Carracosta needs all the Attack it can get.</p> <p>Sturdy and Solid Rock Carracosta play somewhat differently and both require different amounts of support. Sturdy Carracosta should use a Lum Berry, which it makes use of very well to set up against Pokemon that attempt to inflict it with status conditions. It also pairs very well with Rapid Spin users such as Cryogonal and Kabutops, the latter of which can be paired with Carracosta in order to help wear down bulky Water- and Grass-types and aide in an eventual Carracosta sweep. Solid Rock Carracosta can make use of a Life Orb in order to hit significantly harder, notably giving its Aqua Jet the ability to OHKO many of the Choice Scarf users that outspeed boosted Carracosta. A White Herb can also be used on Solid Rock Carracosta, giving it the ability to beat Mach Punch users such as Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee. Generally, excellent teammates for Carracosta are Pokemon that provide hazard support. Ferroseed and Uxie are both good options, the former resisting two of Carracosta's common weaknesses, while the latter gives Carracosta easy setup opportunities thanks to U-turn and Memento. Many Fire-types, such as Magmortar and Entei, also pair fairly well with Carracosta, handling Rotom-C, Lilligant, and Tangrowth. Finally, offensive Grass-types such as Swords Dance Sceptile and Quiver Dance Lilligant pair well with Carracosta, as they can set up on Fire- and Flying-type attacks directed at them.</p> <p>Carracosta also has a few other nifty options up its sleeve. It can use Earthquake over any move other than Stone Edge, giving it excellent type coverage. Hidden Power Fire can be used to handle Ferroseed, while Hidden Power Grass is a solid choice for beating Poliwrath. Stone Plate and Splash Plate can be used on Sturdy Carracosta if adding extra power to Stone Edge, Waterfall, or Aqua Jet is necessary. They are also somewhat handy on Solid Rock sets in order to conserve health and avoid being easily KOed by priority users. Lastly, Carracosta can opt to use Aqua Tail over Waterfall for a bit of extra power, although Aqua Tail's lower accuracy and lack of a flinch chance are a bit of a letdown.</p> "

        "name": "Tank",
        "description": "<p>Carracosta can take on a role as a very effective tank, supporting its team via Stealth Rock while making use of its decent resistances, gargantuan Defense stat, and the incredibly useful Solid Rock trait. Stealth Rock is naturally the most alluring part of this Carracosta, being the most important entry hazard in the game, as Carracosta sets up freely against many offensive Pokemon in the tier, such as Swellow, Bouffalant, and most Calm Mind Sigilyph. Waterfall hits remarkably hard from Carracosta's fairly solid Attack, especially with an Adamant nature, significantly damaging the likes of Steelix and Rhydon while also possessing very good neutral coverage in RU. Stone Edge is Carracosta's second STAB option, hurting the Grass-, Water-, and Dragon-types that resist Waterfall. Finally, Aqua Jet rounds off the moveset, giving Carracosta the ability to pick off weakened Fire-types such as Moltres, while also allowing it to beat fast Focus Sash holders and Sturdy users.</p> <p>Maximum HP gives Carracosta a huge amount of bulk, especially in tandem with Solid Rock, which weakens super effective attacks against it. Maximum Attack beefs up Carracosta's powerful Stone Edges and Waterfalls, allowing it to hit as hard as possible. The remaining EVs are placed into Defense in order to better make use of Carracosta's nifty Normal- and Flying-type resistances. More Defense can be used, although it's somewhat unnecessary, as Carracosta solidly survives even powerful super effective attacks without more than 4 EVs of Defense investment, such as Unburden Hitmonlee's High Jump Kick after Stealth Rock, Jolly Life Orb Sawsbuck's Horn Leech, and Choice Band Aggron's Head Smash. In addition, Life Orb Aerodactyl isn't even capable of 2HKOing Carracosta with Earthquake. Leftovers is the item of choice, simply because the durability it adds to Carracosta is more valuable than anything added by any other item. However, Stone Plate is an option to 2HKO standard mixed defensive Slowking after Stealth Rock, while type-resist berries such as Shuca Berry can be used to allow Carracosta to serve as a niche check to some Pokemon, such as offensive Sandslash.</p> <p>Tank Carracosta pairs well with most defensive team support Pokemon, such as Wish and either Aromatherapy or Heal Bell users. Clefable and Lickilicky are bulky enough to take hits from many offensive Grass- and Electric-types that threaten Carracosta, while passing it Wish and curing status afflictions with Heal Bell. Miltank also pairs well with Carracosta, taking advantage of lured Grass-type attacks to increase its own Attack with Sap Sipper. Similarly, Bouffalant and Sawsbuck make good partners for Carracosta, despite sharing its Fighting-type weakness. Carracosta also goes very nicely with Spikes and Toxic Spikes users. Roselia, for example, resists almost all of Carracosta's weaknesses, sets up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and even has Aromatherapy for Carracosta to make use of. Ferroseed covers Electric- and Grass-type attacks for Carracosta without any trouble, while setting up Spikes and letting Carracosta switch into any Fire- or Flying-type attacks aimed towards it. Most Ghost-types also pair somewhat well with Carracosta, blocking Rapid Spin while also taking hits from most Fighting-type Pokemon. Spiritomb especially is a very nifty partner, trapping and beating the omnipresent Slowking in order to let Carracosta breeze through many teams.</p> "

  "Archeops": {
    "overview": "<p>With its phenomenal 140 / 112 / 110 offenses, Archeops is a regular wrecking ball of flying fury. Its overall good movepool, along with new toys from BW2, such as Heat Wave and Roost, allows Archeops to become a scary Pokemon to deal with. However, there's a reason why such a monster is lurking down in the RU tier, mostly courtesy of an awful ability in Defeatist, which halves Archeops's damage output when its health is lower than 50%. Being weak to Stealth Rock and having piss poor defenses don't help Archeops at all to try and compensate for the ability. Nonetheless, with proper support, Archeops can become an offensive juggernaut.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Archeops actually has a pretty colorful movepool, as it has many interesting special attacks, ranging from Ancient Power to Focus Blast, along with a solid base 112 Special Attack, but it's a waste to not use Archeops's superior Attack and is generally inferior outside of surprise factor. A Choice Scarf set can be used to some success, but with Archeops being Stealth Rock weak and Defeatist in tow makes it a subpar choice. Stealth Rock and Taunt are other moves in Archeops's movepool, but generally, it's an inferior option compared to Aerodactyl, and Archeops is strapped for moveslots as it already is. Rock Slide and Crunch are other moves that Archeops can use to some effective degree, but Rock Slide is not very powerful while Crunch is unnecessary, as Archeops can damage Uxie considerably with a Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics. A Choice Band set can be used for immediate power, but it is generally inferior compared to the Acrobatics set due to the lack of a strong Flying STAB. Tailwind is a move that can benefit Archeops and its teammates for 3 turns with doubled Speed, but Archeops usually will have a better move to utilize. Hone Claws can give Archeops an interesting option to boost its good offensive potential, but considering how Archeops can be easily revenge killed, a sweep is unlikely to be pulled off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Even though Archeops may seem like an unstoppable force, there are many ways this monster can be dealt with. Knocking Archeops into Defeatist range is a good way of dealing with it, as doing so severely limits its offensive potential. The best way of dealing with Archeops is Stealth Rock, as it puts Archeops into Defeatist range after three switch-ins. As for actual counters, Alomomola is the best Archeops counter, as its massive base 165 HP stat allows it to tank any hit Archeops could throw at it. Alomomola also has Wish and Regenerator to keep itself healthy to constantly switch into Archeops, and can heavily dent Archeops with a Waterfall. Regirock is another effective Archeops counter due to its massive Defense stat and can shrug off even Earth Powers from Archeops, while potentially paralyzing it or straight up OHKOing it with Rock Slide. Rhydon and Steelix are also decent switch-ins, but must be wary of Earth Power, which 2HKOes Steelix, while Rhydon will be 2HKOed after some prior damage. Ferroseed also makes a good switch-in to Archeops, as it takes any hit Archeops throws at it with the exception of Heat Wave and destroys it with Gyro Ball. Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-C and fast Pokemon such as Cinccino may not be able to switch in, but can check Archeops with a Thunderbolt or Rock Blast, respectively. Priority users, such as Kabutops, Feraligatr, and Absol, can all OHKO Archeops easily after Stealth Rock with their form of priority.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Acrobatics",
        "description": "<p>Archeops's main set uses its great mixed attacking stats to wreak havoc when used properly. Acrobatics is the main attack, as it hits anything without solid Defense or a resistance extremely hard in conjunction with a Flying Gem. However, you shouldn't be urged to go for Acrobatics in situations when it's not needed, as it's extremely predictable and you could waste your Flying Gem right off the bat. Stone Edge is the secondary STAB to hit Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon, as well as hitting Pokemon like bulky Rotom for neutral damage. Earth Power is primarily used as a coverage move to hit Rhydon, Steelix, and Qwilfish for substantial damage on their weaker Special Defense stat. As for the last moveslot, Head Smash gives Archeops the ability to hit hard even when Defeatist is active thanks to its high Base Power. However, U-turn can also be used to good effect to gain momentum because of how many switches Archeops forces. The only issue with U-turn is that it can be counterproductive with Defeatist, considering Archeops will take more Stealth Rock damage if it switches in many times. Roost is another option that Archeops can use, giving Archeops reliable recovery and keeping it out of Defeatist range. A Roost may seem hard to pull off because of Archeops's general frailty, but it does force many Pokemon to switch out fearing a heavy hit, giving itself a free turn.</p> <p>The EV spread is meant to maximize Archeops's offensive potential. A Naive nature is used to avoid lowering Earth Power's damage output, while outspeeding Durant. A Flying Gem is used primarily because Acrobatics becomes a nuke when used, hitting an effective Base Power of 247.5 with STAB and Flying Gem considered. As for other options, Heat Wave is probably the most attractive one, heavily damaging Escavalier and Ferroseed while still maintaining coverage on Steelix. Earthquake is another option that could be used over Earth Power, hitting some neutral targets harder, but is not optimal because Earth Power hits common Archeops switch-ins like Steelix and Rhydon harder. Aqua Tail could be used, seeing as it hits Rhydon harder than any other physical moves Archeops has in its disposal, but with Earth Power 3HKOing standard Rhydon, it is generally unnecessary to run Aqua Tail.</p> <p>As for partners, Rapid Spin support is mandatory for Archeops, as Stealth Rock is one way to lower Archeops into Defeatist range. Kabutops and Cryogonal are the best for the job, as both can beat most of the Ghost-types in the tier while providing decent synergy with Archeops. Entry hazard support is also appreciated from Pokemon such as Smeargle and Qwilfish, as it wears down Archeops's common switch-ins and enables some 2HKOs to turn into OHKOs. For example, standard defensive Rhydon will always be 2HKOed by Earth Power after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Qwilfish also has the added benefit of synergizing well with Archeops, being able to take Aqua Jets and Sucker Punches aimed at Archeops. Alomomola is a good partner as well, being able to take priority that Archeops is vulnerable to while passing huge Wishes to Archeops to keep it out of Defeatist range. Healing Wish users, such as Mesprit and Lilligant, are also good partners, as they keep Archeops out of Defeatist range while giving it a free switch-in to do some major damage.</p> "

  "Garbodor": {
    "overview": "<p>Garbodor is another variation of the standard \"bulky Poison-type\". What makes Garbodor so great defensively is the fact that it only has two weaknesses, Psychic and Ground. In addition, Garbodor has the ability to set up both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, as well as absorbing Toxic Spikes upon entry. Garbodor's stats are all above average, but unfortunately its movepool is only subpar, which limits its effectiveness. Garbodor has a very limited offensive movepool; it lacks any form of reliable recovery, and because its Speed is nothing spectacutar, lack of a priority move can leave it helpless against a lot of Pokemon in the tier. Garbodor is inferior to most other Poison-types in the game, but if you take advantage of its decent defensive stats and great typing, it will not disappoint.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Similarly to Muk, Garbodor has access to Curse, but unfortunately it doesn't have any priority to counteract the Speed drop. Garbodor's physical movepool is pretty bad as well; however, Garbodor does have access to Gunk Shot, Explosion, and Payback. Stockpile can be used to raise Garbodor's defenses, and Swallow is available for recovery, but this is risky, and usually too difficult to be used consistently. Rock Polish is another option, but isn't very effective due to Garbodor's poor movepool and only average attacking stats. Garbodor has a surprisingly good special movepool including attacks such as Thunderbolt, Focus Blast, and Sludge Bomb, but unfortunately, it won't be dealing enough damage coming from a base 60 Special Attack. Finally, Garbodor's decent typing and good defenses means it can support its team in the form of Rain Dance or Sunny Day, but this is better left to Pokemon such as Uxie.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The biggest problem Garbodor faces are Steel-types. Steel-types are immune to Poison-type attacks, and unfortunately Garbodor doesn't have anything else to hit them with. Steelix is probably the best overall counter as it has an immunity to Poison, and can immediately threaten Garbodor with its STAB Earthquake. Aggron is on a similar boat, as it can switch into Garbodor with ease, proceed to set up with Autotomize, and threaten your entire team with its STAB moves. Ground-types such as Rhydon take little from Garbodor's STAB, while STAB Earthquake makes quick work of it. Taunt users will beat most sets, as Garbodor isn't useful for much besides setting hazards. Almost anything that can survive Gunk Shot and hit Garbodor super effectively can be called a check; Garbodor isn't difficult to beat.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This set uses Garbodor's great defensive typing and decent defenses to set up entry hazards for your team. Thanks to its typing, Garbodor can set up on a variety of Pokemon, namely Grass-types such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and Sawsbuck. Garbodor can also set up on weaker walls such as Uxie and Clefable as they have little offensive power. It should be noted that Haze and Spikes are illegal together, so it's down to personal preference whether you choose an extra set of hazards, or the ability to erase stat boosts. Gunk Shot is Garbodor's most powerful STAB move, and it will leave dents in anything that doesn't resist it. Again, the last slot is down to personal preference; Payback can take advantage of Garbodor's below average Speed and hits Psychic-types for super effective damage, while Body Slam can be used to abuse paralysis. Aftermath is the chosen ability because the added residual damage when Garbodor goes down can really come in handy, Stench doesn't activate enough to make it useful, and Weak Armor is more of a liability due its Defense-lowering side effect.</p> <p>Garbodor may use an Air Balloon to avoid Ground-type moves, but if it gets hit by anything else, the Balloon will burst. Rest can be used along with a Chesto Berry to restore Garbodor's health, while a Chesto Berry allows it to take on Lilligant without fearing Sleep Powder. Rock Blast can be used to break Substitutes and hit Flying-types, but note that it's illegal with Haze. Clear Smog is an alternative move to erase stat changes; however, Clear Smog cannot hit Steel-types such as Shift Gear Klinklang, nor does it work if the opponent has a Substitute up.</p> <p>A Ghost-type, such as Rotom or Dusknoir, is an excellent choice of teammate to block Rapid Spin and ensure entry hazards are kept on the field. Phazers are also handy to rack up damage from entry hazards. Mandibuzz can abuse Whirlwind with its great defenses and Roost, Throh can use STAB Circle Throw, and Steelix can use Roar and Dragon Tail. On another note, Wish support is extremely helpful due to Garbodor's lack of recovery; this can be provided by Clefable due to its massive HP and great support movepool.</p> <p>Pokemon who can deal with Ground- and Psychic-types are great partners. Water-types such as Slowking and Poliwrath are good options; Slowking can be used defensively with Slack Off, while Poliwrath can play offensively with Waterfall and Focus Punch. Grass-types such as Lilligant and Tangrowth can also hit Ground-types with their powerful STAB moves. Drapion and Spiritomb are two excellent choices to break through Psychic-types, especially with Spiritomb's priority on Sucker Punch, and Drapion's powerful Crunch.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Don't be fooled by Cinccino's cute and harmless appearance, for it is a very threatening Pokemon. Its ability, Skill Link, allows it to make good use of its signature move, Tail Slap, to hit harder than almost any Pokemon around. Thanks to Cinccino's use of multi-hit moves, not even Substitute and Focus Sash users are safe against it, which also allows Cinccino to be a great weapon against Smeargle. It is also one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, sitting at a high base 115 Speed, even outpacing the speedy Scolipede. On top of that, Cinccino has a decent Attack stat and a good movepool to work with. With all of these qualities, Cinccino is certainly a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>However, don't think that Cinccino is without its flaws. It has absolutely no way to hit Steel- and Ghost-types, and for this reason, it often needs quite a bit of support to work to its full potential. Additionally, Cinccino also has horrible defenses; 75 / 60 / 60 means any decently powerful hit will OHKO it, and a lack of any useful resistances aren't helping Cinccino either. However, don't let these flaws deter you from using Cinccino, as it is still a threat that is not to be overlooked.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Cinccino's list of other viable options is quite sparse. Sing may seem like a cool move due to its sleep inducing effect, but its horrible accuracy is a big letdown. Furthermore, Cinccino is too frail to make use of such moves and is better off attacking outright. Wake-Up Slap is an interesting move to hit Steel-types such as Aggron and Ferroseed, but the move is weak without the less reliable Technician. Return is more accurate than Tail Slap, but it is significantly less powerful and gives up one of Cinccino's main selling points, the safe removal of Smeargle and Scolipede. Knock Off can remove Eviolite from the likes of Roselia and Ferroseed, but the move is weak and has little utility. Finally, Calm Mind is a usable move to boost Special Attack, along with a usable special movepool in Hyper Voice, Grass Knot, Thunderbolt, and Focus Blast, but Cinccino's low base 65 Special Attack and bad defenses aren't doing it any favors.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Steel-types such as Steelix and Escavalier stand as Cinccino's greatest counters. The former takes little from any of Cinccino's attacks and can wear it down while the latter can come in and severely damage it with Megahorn. Ghost-types such as Spiritomb and Misdreavus also take little to nothing from any of Cinccino's attacks and can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Druddigon and Ferroseed can come in on Tail Slap and wear down Cinccino quickly with Rough Skin and Iron Barbs, respectively, dealing damage for each hit of Tail Slap. Some faster opponents, such as Sceptile, can make quick work of Cinccino. Choice Scarf users such as Rotom-C and Emboar, as well as priority users such as Absol and Entei, can revenge kill Cinccino quite easily. Finally, Tangrowth can also take repeated onslaughts from Cinccino and either incapacitate it with Sleep Powder or repeatedly hit it with Giga Drain.</p> ",

Its good coverage also complements its cleaning ability, meaning it can hit many Pokemon except for Steel- and Ghost-types for at least neutral damage. That said, Tail Slap is the STAB move of choice here, taking advantage of Skill Link and hitting for a massive 125 Base Power. Bullet Seed is the preferred coverage move, hitting Kabutops, Rhydon, and Slowking for heavy damage. Rock Blast is a great move to use with Skill Link as well, hitting Moltres and Crustle in addition to dealing decent damage to Escavalier. Finally, Aqua Tail is chosen to dent weakened Steelix and Aggron.</p> <p>Maximum investment has gone into Attack and Speed to be as fast and powerful as possible. A Jolly nature is chosen in order to be able to outspeed Jolly Scolipede and Archeops, two Pokemon Cinccino wouldn't be able to outspeed with an Adamant nature.

King's Rock is usable, as with Cinccino's use of multi-hit moves and high Speed, it can cause flinches; however, the loss in power without Life Orb is very noticeable. Finally, U-turn can be used to switch out of common counters such as Steelix and Spiritomb, but the Life Orb damage along with entry hazards will quickly rack up.</p> <p>As Cinccino very often struggles against Steel-types, a Pokemon such as Magneton or Magmortar can be immensely helpful. The former can trap the Steel-types and eliminate them, while the latter simply roasts them while providing offensive synergy with Cinccino as well as absorbing Will-O-Wisp. Pursuit support from the likes of Spiritomb and Absol is great in order to eliminate Ghost-types such as Rotom and Misdreavus.

This set also scores KOs on bulkier Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Slowking.</p> <p>Tail Slap is Cinccino's STAB move of choice, hitting with great power against many Pokemon. Bullet Seed deals with Kabutops, Omastar, and Rhydon, all of which resist Tail Slap, while Rock Blast pummels Moltres and Braviary. Finally, U-turn serves as a scouting move to allow Cinccino to escape from its common switch-ins such as Steelix and Escavalier.</p> <p>A Jolly nature is chosen here to again be able to outpace maximum Speed Scolipede and Archeops. Choice Band allows Cinccino to deal with threats it would be unable to break through otherwise, such as Amoonguss and Slowking. Skill Link is the chosen ability to get the most out of Cinccino's moves. Technician is significantly less useful, as with it, Cinccino must rely on a higher degree of luck as opposed to Skill Link guaranteeing five hits out of every move. Technician can, however, be useful in some situations for the extra power provided in each hit. Aqua Tail is a usable option in the final moveslot to hit Steelix. However, because it can only achieve a 4HKO at best, it isn't particularly useful. An Adamant nature is a viable alternative if the extra power is needed, especially given that Cinccino outspeeds base 100 Speed foes such as Typhlosion and Charizard regardless. However, with an Adamant nature, Cinccino loses the ability to outspeed Archeops and Scolipede.</p> <p>Cinccino will very often struggle with Steel- and Ghost-types such as the aforementioned Escavalier, Steelix, and Spiritomb. This makes a Fire-type such as Entei or Moltres important, as they can severely damage the former, while absorbing Will-O-Wisp from the latter. Users of Pursuit, such as Spiritomb and Absol, are also very helpful to keep Ghost-types that keep Cinccino at bay. Magneton is also a good teammate, trapping Steel-types, while Volt Switch can allow it to form a VoltTurn core to keep up offensive momentum. For this reason, along with attaining KOs on bulky Pokemon such as Amoonguss, entry hazard support from the likes of Qwilfish, Smeargle, or Crustle is greatly appreciated.

  "Sawsbuck": {
    "overview": "<p>All things considered, Sawsbuck is a very interesting Pokemon. Its unique Normal / Grass typing offers both an effective dual STAB and a set of helpful resistances and immunities. Its offensive stats, while not by any stretch of the imagination amazing, are enough to allow Sawsbuck to function as a dangerous and even versatile offensive threat, sporting a solid base 100 Attack and a Speed stat that allows it to outpace a large amount of the metagame. Sawsbuck's access to Sap Sipper is also an incredibly useful attribute in a metagame where Grass-type attacks abound, allowing Sawsbuck to switch into and, with some prior damage, dispatch the various Grass-types of the tier. Better yet, as walls such as Tangrowth grow less prominent and Alomomola and other such Pokemon become more common, Sawsbuck is becoming better. However, as one would imagine, Sawsbuck is far from perfect, and its low defenses and only slightly above average Speed make it fairly easy to keep in check with priority and faster Pokemon. While walls that handle Sawsbuck are decreasing in use, generally bulky Pokemon such as Escavalier and Druddigon are growing more common, both of whom handle Sawsbuck without too much trouble. While it's far from a bad Pokemon, Sawsbuck does require appropriate team support to function at its fullest potential.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Though it has mostly ignored until this point, Chlorophyll is far from a bad ability, and in the context of a dedicated sun team, Sawsbuck is very capable of utilizing this ability effectively. Agility is also an option to boost Sawsbuck's Speed, but the commonplace nature of priority does somewhat restrict its effectiveness. A dedicated Baton Pass set can be used to pass either Swords Dance or Agility boosts to a partner, but it does waste Sawsbuck's offensive capabilities, and there are superior partners for such a task. Support options such as Aromatherapy and Thunder Wave have niche use on offensive sets, but a fully support-based set is outclassed by bulky Grass-types, such as Roselia and Ferroseed. Leech Seed is a useful tool that can be used alongside Substitute to wear down otherwise impenetrable checks like Escavalier over time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Certain defensive Steel-types, namely Steelix and Ferroseed, are very capable checks to Sawsbuck and take only meager amounts from its attacks and can either threaten it with Gyro Ball or set up entry hazards on it. Tangrowth and Amoonguss are both capable of sponging most of Sawsbuck's attacks repeatedly thanks to their good natural bulk and Regenerator ability, and they can pressure Sawsbuck with the appropriate Hidden Power or Poison-type STAB, respectively. Weezing, while moderately uncommon, is also a stalwart check to Sawsbuck, taking a pittance from most of its attacks and being capable of either crippling it with Will-O-Wisp or threatening it with its STAB attacks.</p> <p>Despite its limited list of defensive checks and counters, Sawsbuck is much less lucky with offensive threats.

Sawsbuck's unique set of resistances and immunities, which is backed by the threat of its powerful STAB attacks, allow it to find numerous opportunities to set up a Substitute to safely pass off to a teammate or simply dish out damage on its own. Baton Pass also allows Sawsbuck to absorb a Grass-type attack with Sap Sipper and pass an Attack boost off to a partner, allowing it to effectively make use of its ability even before the Grass-type in question is in the range where a +1 Return can dispatch it. Substitute, aside from being an excellent tool for bringing in a more frail Pokemon safely, gives Sawsbuck the leeway to play around Ghost-types like Misdreavus that rely on status to combat it. Return is a very consistent STAB move and is critical for threatening Grass-types such as Lilligant and Amoonguss that Sawsbuck enjoys switching into to net an Attack boost. Horn Leech complements Return nicely, hitting Rock-types that would otherwise shrug off Return and providing recovery that allows Sawsbuck to produce more Substitutes throughout the match.</p> <p>A bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe would yield bulkier Substitutes, but in doing so, Sawsbuck loses a moderate amount of offensive presence, failing to 2HKO common Pokemon such as Slowking and Moltres.

Absol, Archeops, and Durant all are good examples of such Pokemon, as they are not only very difficult to stop behind a Substitute, but also appreciate the potential Attack boosts passed to them through Sap Sipper. Similarly, slower Pokemon such as Aggron and Druddigon can utilize the Substitutes Sawsbuck provides to mitigate the disadvantage bestowed by their low Speed, wearing down the Steel-types that can check them. Entei is another useful partner for this set, as it is is capable of breaking through the bulky Grass- and Steel-types that bother Sawbuck and can also bait bulky Water-types that Sawsbuck can set up on.</p> "

Nature Power rounds off Sawsbuck's coverage, allowing it to hit Steel- and Fire-types particularly hard while having the added benefit of evading Sucker Punch from Absol and Spiritomb.

The choice between Life Orb and Lum Berry is generally that of power versus safety, as Lum Berry grants Sawsbuck added insurance switching into potential Will-O-Wisps and Scalds without fear of being crippled. In terms of alternative items, Leftovers can be used alongside Substitute to procure guaranteed HP recovery to produce more Substitutes, but usually the recovery from Horn Leech is sufficient. Salac Berry is also an interesting option with Substitute, as it allows Sawsbuck to more effectively sweep faster teams once priority users have been dispatched. If this is used, an EV spread of 12 HP / 244 Atk / 252 Spe would prove optimal, guaranteeing that the Salac Berry is activated after three uses of Substitute. Baton Pass is a viable choice in the final moveslot, as it allows Sawsbuck to maintain momentum early in the game while even having the potential to pass Attack boosts gained from Sap Sipper and / or Swords Dance. Jump Kick offers similar coverage to Nature Power, trading perfect accuracy and the ability to evade Sucker Punch for the ability to hit Ferroseed for significant damage and prevent Archeops and Aerodactyl from getting a totally free switch into Sawsbuck.

Few other sets have ever been good enough to be worth using in its stead. A defensive set with a focus on Special Defense was once very popular, thanks to Escavalier's fantastic defensive typing and ability to still pose as an offensive threat. Its staying power could also be increased by using a RestTalk set, allowing it to absorb sleep and other status and continue on its warpath. However, its main function was as a hail team counter, and with hail now banned from RU, the need for Escavalier to tank strong Ice-type attacks is no longer as relevant. The set is still effective, as Escavalier makes one of the best Ghost-, Psychic-, and Dark-type counters in the game. However, Escavalier still retains the ability to check or eliminate almost all of these threats with its offensive set as it is.</p> <p>For alternative movepool changes, Toxic can be run in the last slot of the offensive set. Toxic is generally not as important for offensive teams (which is typically where Escavalier will be used), but it can still be effective to cripple the likes of Moltres and Poliwrath and generally wear down defensive teams. If not running Choice Band, Swords Dance can make an appearance on the offensive set. Because Escavalier forces switches like there's no tomorrow, it'll usually find an opportunity to set up. However, Escavalier can't sweep due to its low Speed, meaning that while the next Pokemon to come in is almost assured to be KOed (unless it's a Fire-type), that's the extent of Escavalier's sweep. It's usually just better off pummeling the opponent with Megahorn. Finally, Escavalier is one of the best Pokemon to set up Rain Dance, and it benefits from the rain by then being able to tank Hidden Power Fires without the need for Occa Berry.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Choice Band-boosted Megahorn is the big gun Escavalier will be firing for most of the match, and few Pokemon comfortably tank the hit in the tier. Among them, Emboar and Moltres are one of the better ones, as they also force Escavalier to switch out. However, Moltres will need to Roost if it switches into Stealth Rock as well, and Return will completely wreck both of them (though it's a rare move on Escavalier). Steelix is one of the few defensive Pokemon in the tier that straight up walls Escavalier to no end, and can wear down Escavalier with Earthquake. Aggron works as well, avoiding the 2HKO from a Choice Band-boosted Megahorn and OHKOing back with Head Smash.</p> <p>Qwilfish makes a pretty good check with Intimidate, and it resists both of Escavalier's STAB moves. Even if Qwilfish is at low health and assured to be KOed, the Intimidate Attack drop will help its teammates tank the next hit from Escavalier. Poliwrath is a pretty solid answer to Escavalier, though it's not as good in the current metagame and will be forced to Rest quickly if Spikes are on the field. Eviolite Magneton is the best answer to assuredly trap and defeat Escavalier with Hidden Power Fire; Choice Specs Magneton works as well, but will take massive damage from Megahorn in the process if it switches into it. Choice Scarf Magneton can work, but it only has a small chance to OHKO Escavalier without Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Instead of using a dedicated counter to deal with Escavalier, another option is to lure it out and smack it with Hidden Power Fire or Fire Blast. While Escavalier has a way of dealing with these surprise attacks through Occa Berry, Choice Band is still far and away the most common set, making it a generally consistent option to deal with it. The Pokemon that best lure out Escavalier are Grass-types, such as Lilligant, Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Roselia, and Exeggutor. Running a Fire-type attack on something truly unexpected, such as Hidden Power Fire on Cryogonal, will really throw the Escavalier user off. Other Pokemon capable of dedicating a moveslot include Fire Blast Slowking, Fire Punch or Flamethrower Druddigon, and Hidden Power Fire Mesprit, though these are more common and the Escavalier user will probably be prepared for it.</p> <p>Finally, there are several Pokemon that can tank a hit from Escavalier and defeat it, but they will be severely maimed in the process. Alomomola will lose to Choice Band Escavalier if it switches into Stealth Rock (though it might be able to burn it with Scald), but will win against Occa Berry and Leftovers Escavalier one-on-one. Rotom, Durant, Entei, and other Escavalier can all tank a Choice Band-boosted Megahorn and KO a partially weakened Escavalier in return, but this is generally a poor way of preparing for it, particularly considering these Pokemon need to be at full health in order to stand the best chance of winning.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>OHKOing Escavalier is a near impossibility, creating a situation for the opponent once it's in to decide between the risk of staying in and being KOed by Megahorn or its appropriate coverage move or predicting incorrectly and losing a different Pokemon (or taking a ton of damage). Pursuit destroys the likes of Uxie, Roselia, Cryogonal, and most Cinccino, which have almost no way of harming Escavalier and face a lose-lose situation in either staying in or switching out. Iron Head is Escavalier's \"safe move,\" providing a reliable STAB move that can also do more damage to those that resist Megahorn, such as Aggron and Golurk. The last moveslot is dedicated to Sleep Talk, as Escavalier makes one of the best switch-ins to nearly every sleep inducer in the tier, including Jynx, Lilligant, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth. Hidden Power Fire is a constant threat from these sleep inducers, but the threat of a Choice Band-boosted Megahorn once Escavalier's on the field is usually enough to scare them out, preventing any further setup, and even if they decide to stay in, an item change to Occa Berry can make Escavalier a dedicated counter to these threats.</p> <p>Speaking of item, Choice Band is typically the best option for Escavalier. The sheer power of Escavalier's Choice Band-boosted Megahorn is what makes it the absolute threat that it is, and is one of the most powerful off-hand attacks available in the tier. However, because of the popularity of the Choice Band set and the inability of the opponent to risk the chance of not playing to the threat it brings, Escavalier has the advantage of bluffing pretty effectively with either an Occa or Chesto Berry. Occa Berry allows Escavalier to beat a handful of Pokemon it normally wouldn't be able to go one-on-one with due to the threat of Hidden Power Fire, particularly from the likes of Grass-types like Lilligant and Amoonguss and Psychic-types like Mesprit. Occa Berry even allows Escavalier to comfortably tank a Fire Blast from Absol, Aerodactyl, and defensive Slowking, which all typically carry the move almost solely for Escavalier. This item bluff is particularly effective when using Escavalier to Pursuit trap a Pokemon such as Uxie and the opponent switches in a Pokemon such as Absol to set up on the assumed Choice-locked Pursuit, only to be met with a KO from Megahorn.</p> <p>Chesto Berry allows Escavalier to run Rest in the last slot over Sleep Talk, letting it either absorb a sleep attack once or use Rest to give itself a new lease on life and possibly tank and KO not one, but two of the opponent's Pokemon. This is particularly effective when Escavalier is taking on a setup sweeper like Hidden Power Rock Lilligant, which will typically use Quiver Dance as Escavalier switches in and then attempt to put it to sleep with Sleep Powder, only to have Escavalier wake up immediately and smash it with Megahorn. ChestoRest is fantastic against slow defensive teams too, where Escavalier will typically be able to out-tank at least one Pokemon, survive the hit of the incoming Pokemon and use Rest, and continue its relentless pummeling of the opposition.</p> <p>With a Pokemon as slow as Escavalier, your initial reaction would probably be to ignore its Speed altogether and just focus on Attack and bulk. However, in RU, Escavalier resides in a very interesting Speed tier, meaning even at its snail's pace, speed is still the name of the game. The Speed EVs given on the above set allow it to outspeed minimum Speed Spiritomb, as well as Slowking and Amoonguss. Dropping down to 84 Speed EVs is doable to still outspeed minimum Speed Slowking and Amoonguss, and Escavalier gains a bit of bulk in the process. If you don't care about outspeeding, or figure that those defensive threats will be Speed creeping ahead of Escavalier anyway, max HP can be used instead to take hits more reliably. In particular, Sceptile and Accelgor have a much lower chance of 2HKOing Escavalier with Focus Blast, and Druddigon's Outrage will only 4HKO max HP Escavalier (assuming no entry hazards).</p> <p>Escavalier's movepool is hilariously tiny, but Return is a definite alternative option to place in the last slot or over even Iron Head to nail Fire-types like Moltres and Emboar really hard. If you're choosing to not run Choice Band, Protect is a great option to run in the last slot to scout for Hidden Power Fire or Fire Blast and plan accordingly. While Knock Off is pretty weak, it's still a very helpful option to remove Leftovers and Choice Scarf from the opponent, particularly considering Emboar is one of the most common switch-ins and is significantly less threatening without a Choice Scarf boosting its Speed. Don't bother with anything else, honestly; Escavalier is very one-dimensional and that's fine, even if your opponent knows exactly what's going to happen, Escavalier will accomplish its goal.</p> <p>As for teammates, Escavalier has great synergy with basically every other top-tier threat. Slowking in particular has amazing defensive and offensive synergy with Escavalier, and it can even set up Trick Room to initiate a one-two sweep by the pair as almost nothing else with outspeed them in Trick Room, especially if they're both running 0 Speed IVs. Alomomola has great defensive synergy with Escavalier as well, taking on the likes of Emboar and Steelix like it was getting paid, and provides Wish support for the otherwise-recoverless Escavalier. Escavalier works great in the middle of Regenerator and Fire / Water / Grass cores because it covers the attacking types that they normally miss out on. Escavalier provides the core's Druddigon check, as well as countering Sceptile and Dark-types and Pursuit trapping Psychic- and Ghost-types.</p> <p>Due to most of Escavalier's checks being grounded and all the switches it forces, Escavalier works very well on Spikes-stacking teams. Spikes wear down the defensive counters to Escavalier that don't have reliable recovery very quickly, with Poliwrath and Steelix being prime examples. Escavalier even traps and eliminates Cryogonal for the team and can force Kabutops out. Finally, in general, Pokemon that love having Ghost- and Psychic-types removed from the battle, such as Hitmonlee and other Fighting-types, love having Escavalier as a partner. Offensive Grass-types, such as Lilligant and Rotom-C, also enjoy Escavalier's ability to either Pursuit trap or eliminate via Megahorn other Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Roselia.</p> "

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is one of the best pivots in the RU tier, sporting impressive bulk and a handful of useful resistances as well as an excellent ability in Regenerator, which together allow it to switch in and out repeatedly without much support. Its movepool, while fairly shallow, is tailored to this role perfectly, and in particular contains the coveted Spore. Between these attributes, Amoonguss is capable of taking on a variety of Pokemon, including Sceptile, Feraligatr, and Galvantula, throughout the course of a battle without much fuss.</p> <p>However, even with all the positive attributes Amoonguss sports, it does get held down by several notable negatives. Amoonguss's low Speed and mediocre Special Attack make it extremely exploitable by a variety of offensive threats after Spore has put something to sleep. Even with Spore available, sleep is a status that is highly prepared for in RU, with nearly every team utilizing any of a Sap Sipper or Vital Spirit user, a Choice user carrying Sleep Talk, Lum Berry sweepers that can take out Amoonguss after a boost, Heal Bell support, or some combination of these to prevent Amoonguss from simply using Spore and incapacitating a Pokemon for the rest of the match. What's more, Amoonguss faces direct competition from its Grass-type cousin Tangrowth, which likewise has access to Regenerator and its own sleep move, while sporting better physical bulk, higher offensive stats, and coverage moves that can better deter common sleep absorbers from switching in for free. While Amoonguss can be a very effective multi-purpose pivot, it must be used with caution in order to avoid being exploited by a metagame well prepared for what it aims to accomplish.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss makes for a respectable Rain Dance user, as its solid bulk and good synergy with Water-type Swift Swim users, as well as its ability to use Damp Rock to good effect thanks to Regenerator passively healing it, give it quite a few opportunities to set up rain. Body Slam can be utilized over Stun Spore in order to possibly paralyze Bouffalant and other Sap Sipper users, though its usefulness doesn't extend beyond this. Similarly, Toxic offers Amoonguss the ability to put defensive switch-ins such as Cryogonal on a timer, which can prove more useful than Stun Spore against more defensive teams. Lastly, Substitute allows Amoonguss to use Spore more conservatively while also preventing it from being scared out by strong attacks as quickly.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The task of taking on Amoonguss is largely determined by whether or not it has put something to sleep yet. Magmortar can switch in with near impunity thanks to Vital Spirit and threaten Amoonguss with powerful attacks. Sap Sipper Pokemon, most notably Bouffalant, can capitalize on Amoonguss's Grass-type attacks to net an Attack boost and, in Bouffalant's case, threaten it with a powerful Head Charge. Sleep Talk users such as Entei, Escavalier, and Emboar can absorb sleep well and proceed to threaten Amoonguss with their powerful STAB attacks. Lum Berry sweepers such as Swords Dance Gallade and Absol, while not immediately threatening Amoonguss, are capable of setting up on it as it attempts to inflict them with status in vain and KO it in the proceeding turn. However, these Pokemon should remain wary of offensive variants of Amoonguss, which can pressure most Lum Berry carriers with Life Orb-boosted Sludge Bombs. Roselia is capable of switching into Amoonguss with near impunity due to Natural Cure and set up Spikes on it.</p> <p>After Spore has put an opposing Pokemon to sleep, a lot more Pokemon can check or counter Amoonguss. Steel-types such as Aggron and Klinklang can switch in and potentially set up on Amoonguss thanks to an immunity to Clear Smog, though they must be wary of Stun Spore in doing so. Fire-types such as Moltres and Typhlosion have little trouble switching in on anything in Amoonguss's arsenal barring Stun Spore and Life Orb-boosted Sludge Bombs and can proceed to OHKO with their powerful STAB attacks. Moreover, Pokemon with good special bulk and Substitute such as Substitute + Bulk Up Gallade and Substitute + Calm Mind Uxie can safely set up all over Amoonguss, avoiding both Clear Smog and Stun Spore.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Due to Amoonguss's respectable overall bulk, good defensive typing, and access to Regenerator, it can take on a variety of offensive Pokemon, both physical and special. Spore is a huge draw for Amoonguss, allowing it to cripple any Pokemon unless the opponent carries a Vital Spirit or Sap Sipper user. Giga Drain provides Amoonguss with a moderately powerful STAB attack that also recovers HP, letting it comfortably take on Water-types such as Feraligatr and Lanturn. With Clear Smog, Amoonguss can neutralize stat boosts and hit Grass-types for reasonable damage, allowing it to effectively check an assortment of boosting Grass-, Fighting-, and Water-type Pokemon. On the other hand, Sludge Bomb, while no longer letting Amoonguss indefinitely combat certain boosting sweepers, provides a more powerful secondary STAB. This allows Amoonguss to not only better take on Pokemon such as Substitute + Bulk Up Gallade, but also better threaten incoming Fire-types such as Moltres and Entei, especially with Sludge Bomb's high poison rate. The final move is largely influenced by individual needs. Stun Spore gives Amoonguss a secondary status move to cripple faster Pokemon after Spore has been used, as well as Pokemon unfazed by Spore. Synthesis eases the strain on Regenerator for recovery, allowing Amoonguss to better take on powerful off-the-bat attackers such as Galvantula. Lastly, Hidden Power Fire is an option to hit incoming Steel-types fairly hard, most notably 2HKOing Escavalier and OHKOing Durant, two common switch-ins to Amoonguss.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Amoonguss capably takes on physically and specially attacking Pokemon alike, ensuring it is never 2HKOed by Lilligant's Hidden Power Fire or OHKOed by Sceptile's Flying Gem-boosted Acrobatics among other things, and letting it effectively take on most Water- and Grass-types in the tier. The Special Attack investment allows Amoonguss to consistently 3HKO Qwilfish and 2HKO Ferroseed after Stealth Rock damage with the appropriate attack, limiting the amount of entry hazards they can set up. However, Amoonguss's EVs are incredibly flexible, so don't hesitate to alter the EVs to tailor them to your team's individual needs. Between Regenerator, Giga Drain, and perhaps even Synthesis, Amoonguss isn't exactly hard-pressed for recovery, so Rocky Helmet can be utilized to punish zealous physical attackers, wearing down Pokemon such as Feraligatr and Hitmonlee.</p> <p>Though Amoonguss is rather self-sufficient, certain Pokemon can help ease its duties. Water-types offer good synergy with Amoonguss, both defensively and offensively. Offensive Water-types such as Crawdaunt and Kabutops appreciate Amoonguss's ability to check Grass-types that prevent their sweep, and Slowking and Alomomola can both form an effective Regenerator core with it to take on a variety of threats. Rock-types such as Rhydon and Regirock help combat Fire- and Flying-type Pokemon for Amoonguss and provide Stealth Rock support to wear down Pokemon such as Entei.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Though commonly regarded as a defensive pivot, Amoonguss has a respectable base 85 Special Attack and access to Regenerator, which allow it to serve as a surprisingly versatile tank. While initially appearing outclassed by the very similar Tangrowth, which has higher physical bulk, Special Attack, and Speed than Amoonguss, the latter has certain traits that allow it to remain useful. Spore is the first of these traits and a natural choice for any Amoonguss set, as being able to incapacitate a single Pokemon with perfect accuracy is a great improvement over Tangrowth's sometimes-shaky Sleep Powder. In addition, its Poison typing and superior special bulk make Amoonguss preferred over Tangrowth against dangerous Grass- and Electric-types, such as Sceptile, Lilligant, and Rotom, while also better handling Bug-types, such as Accelgor, in a pinch. Giga Drain provides Amoonguss with a moderately powerful STAB attack with the added benefit of recovering lost HP, mitigating damage from Life Orb recoil and attacks aimed at it. STAB Sludge Bomb provides respectable neutral coverage alongside Giga Drain, hitting Grass-, Dragon-, Flying-, Fire-, and Bug-types that might otherwise switch in fearlessly. Moreover, Sludge Bomb is capable of hitting common Sap Sipper users, such as Bouffalant and Sawsbuck, that try to switch into Spore or Giga Drain, severely hurting the former and OHKOing the latter. Hidden Power Fire rounds out Amoonguss's coverage, hitting Steel-types hard, preventing Pokemon such as Escavalier and Klinklang from switching in for free after a Pokemon has been put to sleep, and letting Amoonguss switch into Ferroseed and beat it. Hidden Power Ground, while leaving Amoonguss vulnerable to Escavalier and to an extent Durant and Ferroseed, allows Amoonguss to hit Poison-types, most notably Drapion, hard.</p> <p>With the given EV spread, Amoonguss seeks to maximize its offensive presence and ability to sponge hits while minimizing damage taken from Life Orb. While a Life Orb is preferred to supplement Amoonguss's moderate Special Attack and Regenerator generally keeps it healthy anyway, Black Sludge can be used to enhance Amoonguss's survivability. Stun Spore can ease prediction, crippling incoming Pokemon and reducing their Speed and even allowing Amoonguss to outpace them in the proceeding turn. Though access to Regenerator and generally solid overall bulk make Amoonguss a fairly self-sufficient Pokemon, certain teammates can be used to improve its overall performance. Hard-hitting Water-types such as Slowking and Kabutops are very capable of switching into Fire-type attacks aimed at Amoonguss which in turn switches into Electric- and Grass-types aimed at them, with Slowking forming a potent Regenerator core. Bulky Rock-types such as Rhydon are also very useful partners, being able to support Amoonguss with Stealth Rock, checking physically oriented Fire- and Flying-types such as Entei and Braviary, and luring in Water-, Grass-, and Fighting-type attacks for Amoonguss to switch into.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Alomomola has obviously been keeping tabs on its cholesterol, because it's just about the healthiest heart around! Sporting a massive base 165 HP stat backed by a respectable base 80 Defense stat, Alomomola is extremely bulky, being able to take nearly every unboosted physical attack in the tier with HP to spare. Furthermore, Regenerator allows Alomomola to switch in and out and heal passively, making the task of wearing it down a chore. These traits allow Alomomola to make for an excellent user of Wish, being able to pass massive amounts of HP to teammates with no direct negative repercussions. Unfortunately, the issues with Alomomola lie in the indirect consequences of its use: due to its low offensive presence, Alomomola is incredibly exploitable, with most setup sweepers and hazard users being capable of switching into it and setting up without much trouble. This lack of offensive capability means Alomomola can only function effectively as a defensive pivot and Wish supporter, as this is the only way to limit the opportunities for the opponent to take advantage of its presence and to differentiate it from more wholly versatile Pokemon such as Slowking and Clefable. Nevertheless, Alomomola excels in this role. As it stands, Alomomola is one of, if not the most durable Wish users in the tier, and as long as the team it is supporting is prepared to take on the Pokemon it innately attracts, it will very rarely disappoint.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>As Alomomola's niche in the tier is somewhat exclusive to taking on non-boosting attackers and using Wish, it is largely restricted in what other options it can realistically use. Calm Mind is a neat idea for mitigating its lower Special Defense and allowing Scald to hit harder, but it would realistically need to set up for several turns to be dealing respectable damage with its attacks—a highly unrealistic feat, considering offensive teams will be capable of breaking through it before it becomes threatening, and defensive teams will simply phaze it away or cripple it with status before it becomes dangerous. Similar to Calm Mind, Light Screen can be used to buffer Alomomola and its team against special attacks for a period of time without the need to stay in over a period of time. Safeguard is also available to temporarily protect Alomomola and its teammates from status. Hydration is an interesting ability that could allow Alomomola to constantly revitalize itself in rain by using Rest, but with turns of rain being valuable to a rain team for attacking with powerful sweepers, it is highly counterproductive to be wasting them attempting to wall Pokemon.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While very few Pokemon can actually stop Alomomola from using Wish directly, there are certainly Pokemon that take advantage of and threaten it. Defensively speaking, Spikes users such as Qwilfish, Ferroseed, and Roselia are capable of setting up hazards for free on Alomomola, being immune to Toxic and resistant to Waterfall. Toxic users can cripple Alomomola, putting it on a timer each time it comes in. Grass-types, particularly specially offensive ones such as Sceptile and Lilligant, switch in with impunity on anything but Toxic and can set up all over Alomomola and threaten it with their STAB attacks. As for setup sweepers, Pokemon carrying Lum Berry, Substitute, or an immediately threatening Electric- or Grass-type attack can for the most part find opportunities to set up on Alomomola and beat it one-on-one. Examples of these include Swords Dance Gallade, Dragon Dance Crawdaunt, and Quiver Dance Lilligant.</p> ",

Alomomola's gargantuan HP stat makes it capable of passing a huge Wish off to teammates, enough to completely rejuvenate frailer Pokemon such as Durant. Waterfall is Alomomola's best bet at dealing direct damage to opposing Pokemon, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Entei and Kabutops for respectable damage. Protect offers Alomomola a useful \"safety net\" option, allowing it to scout Choice users as well as guaranteeing it can receive its own Wish safely. Lastly, Toxic gives Alomomola a weapon to hit Grass-, Water-, and Dragon-types switching into it, allowing it to put a timer on such Pokemon and prevent them from setting up on it for free.</p> <p>Though a physical bias is preferred to take advantage of Alomomola's better Defense stat and the higher number of physically based immediate attackers it can feasibly check, a more specially inclined spread of 36 HP / 252 Def / 220 SpD or 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can be used to allow Alomomola to better take on Choice Specs users, such as Slowking and Typhlosion. Scald, along with a Bold nature, can be used over Waterfall, allowing Alomomola the chance to burn Pokemon on the switch. However, it should be noted that Alomomola will be doing very little damage directly with this move when taking into account its minuscule base 40 Special Attack, making it even more vulnerable to Substitute users. An investment in Special Attack can be made when using Scald to mitigate this issue, though it does noticeably detract from Alomomola's ability to take repeated powerful hits. Considering how uncommon it is for Alomomola to use its attacking moves, Healing Wish is actually a very viable option. Though when played well, Alomomola can survive through the entirety of the match, a point is often reached at which it becomes more exploitable than helpful; Healing Wish allows Alomomola to be useful one last time by completely rejuvenating a teammate, allowing a sweeper or heavy hitter to gain a second chance to do its job. Considering Alomomola's access to multiple sources of recovery, Rocky Helmet is a usable option over Leftovers, allowing it to passively wear down physical attackers such as Entei and Druddigon.</p> <p>The best partners for Alomomola are those that can appreciate its Wishes and take on the stat-boosting Pokemon that it innately lures in.

Both Pokemon are rather vulnerable to being worn down, so Wish support from Alomomola is greatly appreciated. Magneton is also a very solid partner, resisting both Electric- and Grass-type attacks and being able to threaten Water-types that Alomomola can only Toxic, as well as trapping Pokemon such as Klinklang and Ferroseed that would otherwise switch into Alomomola repeatedly and set up on it. Grass-types also provide good defensive synergy with Alomomola. Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Roselia are able to take Electric- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Alomomola without much hassle, with the former forming a bulky Regenerator core with Alomomola and the latter being capable of setting up Spikes to wear down the Pokemon that threaten Alomomola. Cryogonal is also a solid partner to Alomomola, using Rapid Spin to prevent Alomomola from being worn down by hazard damage and offering a solid special wall with access to Haze to prevent setup sweepers such as Lilligant from getting out of hand.</p> "

This potential is further reinforced by its ability, Compound Eyes, which grants it a dangerous 91% accurate Thunder. However, not unlike the itsy bitsy spider, Galvantula is as dainty as they come, failing to shrug off even resisted hits. A weakness to Stealth Rock compounds this, often forcing it under the rug for more self-sufficient Pokemon like Manectric.

Aside from Hidden Power Ground, Galvantula can also utilize a few other Hidden Power types. Hidden Power Fire hits Pokemon such as Escavalier and Ferroseed harder than any other move in its arsenal, whereas Hidden Power Ice enables it to hit Ground- and Flying-types in a single move, although their use doesn't go much further than that. Charge Beam is somewhat usable, boosting Galvantula's Special Attack stat to break through walls, although it is often better off firing off more powerful attacks, and its frailty prevents it from setting up easily. Electro Ball has interesting applications, but the fact of the matter is that there is almost never a situation in which Galvantula is so much faster than a foe that Thunder is dwarfed in power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Dedicated special walls, such as Clefable, Cryogonal, and Roselia, are the best to handle Galvantula, switching into any of its attacks without too much trouble. However, Cryogonal's Stealth Rock weakness somewhat limits its ability to do so, especially when switching into a Volt Switch and being threatened out by a strong physical attacker. Lanturn, Ferroseed, and Druddigon are all capable of shrugging off Galvantula's attacks, while in turn crippling it with paralysis. Steelix, despite being 2HKOed by Hidden Power Ground, can switch into any other attack and threaten Galvantula with its STAB attacks. Priority attacks plague Galvantula's existence, with Choice Band user's attacks, such as Entei's Extreme Speed and Spiritomb's Sucker Punch, quickly threatening Galvantula. Similarly, faster Pokemon such as Sceptile and Aerodactyl are capable of outspeeding Galvantula and promptly taking it out, although they must be wary while switching in.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Galvantula's excellent coverage, great Speed, and good Special Attack makes it adept at sweeping through weakened teams. Thunder provides an excellent primary STAB move, hitting everything that doesn't resist it hard. The 30% chance of paralysis is also very important, deterring faster Pokemon like Sceptile from switching into a resisted hit. Bug Buzz acts as potent secondary STAB attack, hitting Grass-types that resist Thunder. Hidden Power Ground rounds off Galvantula's coverage, punishing Steelix, while also hitting opposing Electric-types that try to switch in on Thunder for super effective damage. Giga Drain allows Galvantula to recover damage from Life Orb and entry hazards, while also hitting Pokemon such as Lanturn and Golurk harder than any of Galvantula's alternative moves. On the other hand, Volt Switch allows Galvantula to hit the opponent while maintaining offensive momentum, which can help wear down defensive checks such as Clefable and Roselia.</p> <p>A Timid nature is invaluable for this set to outspeed dangerous Pokemon such as Typhlosion and Manectric. Life Orb is usually the most useful item, as the ability to switch moves helps Galvantula more effectively sweep late-game. However, Choice Specs provides Galvantula with the extra power to effectively break through Pokemon such as Clefable and Cryogonal. As Galvantula is susceptible to being revenge killed, Substitute can be used to keep it in more safely. This makes Galvantula able to threaten Pokemon such as Choice Band Entei and Spiritomb who would otherwise keep Galvantula in check with their powerful priority attacks. Considering Galvantula's excellent super effective coverage, an Expert Belt can be used as an alternative item.</p> <p>Galvantula's weakness to both Stealth Rock and Spikes is debilitating, so a spinner greatly benefits it. Kabutops makes an excellent choice, not only spinning away hazards, but also resisting Fire-type attacks aimed at Galvantula and in turn luring Grass-types that Galvantula can threaten. Conversely, Galvantula thoroughly appreciates Stealth Rock and Spikes to net valuable KOes on Pokemon such as Druddigon, Ferroseed, and Cryogonal. Smeargle is a very capable partner for quickly and efficiently laying entry hazards, while Pokemon such as Qwilfish can set up hazards on the Fire- and Rock-type attacks targeting Galvantula. Moreover, because Galvantula naturally struggles with dedicated special walls, Pokemon such as Gallade and Choice Band Spiritomb can threaten the majority of such walls and thus are good partners as well.</p> "

  "Ferroseed": {
    "overview": "<p>Ferroseed might have an NFE status, but don't let that trick you into thinking it is a bad Pokemon. In fact, Ferroseed is one of the best pure support Pokemon in the tier. Sporting solid defenses thanks to Eviolite, a great defensive typing, and a wide support movepool, Ferroseed can be quite the pain to take down. Even its abysmal Speed can be turned into an advantage thanks to Ferroseed's access to Gyro Ball. Ferroseed isn't unbeatable though. With a 4x Fire weakness, a Fighting weakness, and Pokemon such as Entei, Gallade, and Moltres being extremely common in the tier, there are plenty of Pokemon that can simply turn Ferroseed into a liability. Ferroseed's low Attack stat also means that nothing outside of Gyro Ball is going to be hitting hard. Ferroseed's abundant support movepool also leads to a case of four-moveslot syndrome that keeps it from carrying every support move it would like to. Within its vast support movepool, Ferroseed is missing one key ingredient: a form of reliable recovery. This can cause Ferroseed to wear down over time as it doesn't even have Leftovers recovery due to the necessity of holding Eviolite to be the defensive stalwart that it is. Ferroseed is a great support Pokemon in RU, but you need to be sure to cover for its faults, mainly its lack of reliable recovery and weaknesses to Fire- and Fighting-type moves, if you want to get the most out of it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ferroseed really doesn't have many other options to consider. It has a decent offensive movepool, but it has pitiful offenses. Curse can attempt to remedy this issue, but commonly seen Pokemon such as Entei and Gallade will ultimately be the downfall of such a set. Toxic is an option on the main set over Thunder Wave if Ferroseed is used on a stall team, but it should ideally be supported with Toxic Spikes from something like Qwilfish in such a case. Bullet Seed can possibly be used against something like Substitute + Dragon Dance Crawdaunt, but it would literally have no use outside of that. Payback can hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Rotom, Uxie, and Sigilyph for decent damage, but most are either hit harder by Gyro Ball or won't be staying in on Ferroseed if they don't have a coverage move for it anyway. Finally, Ferroseed has access to Explosion to go out with a bang, but it won't be hitting as hard as you might think off of Ferroseed's lackluster base 50 Attack.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There are plenty of Pokemon that can beat Ferroseed, but they have to be mindful of a possible Thunder Wave or Leech Seed with most answers. Perhaps the most surefire way to beat Ferroseed is the use of Magneton. Thanks to its ability, Magnet Pull, Ferroseed is unable to switch out and Hidden Power Fire will take care of Ferroseed in very short order. From there, slower Pokemon that are capable of using Fire- and Fighting-type moves are generally safe answers as they aren't crippled badly by Thunder Wave. Such Pokemon include Slowking, Druddigon, and Eelektross. Obviously, Pokemon such as Entei, Gallade, and Magmortar are more than capable of handling Ferroseed, but they have to be careful of being caught by Thunder Wave on the switch.</p> <p>Any Pokemon with Trick or Switcheroo can cripple Ferroseed by giving it a useless Choice item in place of its precious Eviolite. Rotom-C, Mesprit, and Manectric are key users of these moves with Manectric being able to ignore Thunder Wave's paralysis thanks to Lightningrod. All three are also capable of carrying a Fire-type coverage move to handle Ferroseed with if they would prefer to keep their Choice items. Any Qwilfish wielding Taunt can quickly shut down Ferroseed and turn it into Spikes fodder. In the long run, Ferroseed can be worn down quite easily as it doesn't even have Leftovers to recover health and has to rely on Leech Seed to have any sort of recovery. However, by going this route, you risk allowing Ferroseed to get down multiple layers of Spikes before it finally gets KOed, which means it will have probably done its job by then.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is standard fare for Ferroseed in RU. This set allows Ferroseed to check and counter a plethora of threats in RU while using its expansive movepool to support its team. Spikes is the entry hazard of choice, as Ferroseed can find many opportunities to switch in and set up the entry hazard to slowly build up passive damage against the opposing team. Stealth Rock is an alternative to lessen the pressure on Ferroseed to continually set up entry hazards, but do keep in mind that it gets much wider distribution than Spikes does, thus making Spikes the better option on most teams. Thunder Wave generally gets the nod to allow Ferroseed to cripple faster Pokemon, such as Moltres, Gallade, and Entei, that might attempt to switch into it. If you're using more of a stall-based team, Protect could be a better option to stall for Leech Seed damage and possible poison damage from Toxic Spikes support. In general, this also allows Ferroseed to scout for possible Choice-locked attackers or stray Fire- or Fighting-type moves. Leech Seed is a must in the next slot as it provides the only form of recovery Ferroseed has. This works well in conjunction with Spikes anyway, as it will force the opponent to stay in and take more Leech Seed damage or switch out and deal with Spikes damage. The final slot keeps Ferroseed from being complete Taunt bait. Gyro Ball is generally preferred as it hits decently hard thanks to Ferroseed's abysmal Speed stat. However, if your team really struggles with Water-type sweepers, namely Omastar and Crawdaunt, Seed Bomb is an option to better handle them.</p> <p>The EV spread gives Ferroseed as much bulk as possible with a heavy preference in physical bulk, as a lot of Ferroseed's resistances, such as Dark, Dragon, and Rock, are physical attacks on most occasions. A Relaxed nature is used with 0 Speed IVs to maximize the damage output from Gyro Ball. One can reverse the spread with a Sassy nature to give Ferroseed much better special bulk to take more advantage of its resistances to Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Psychic-type moves. However, many of these Pokemon commonly carry coverage moves that are super effective against Ferroseed.</p> <p>Due to its many resistances, it is quite easy to form a defensive core with Ferroseed. Slowking is a great teammate as it resists both Fire- and Fighting-type moves for Ferroseed and can form quite the annoying paralysis core with Ferroseed, which in turn can take on many of the attacks Slowking can't handle. Alomomola is another worthy option as its gigantic Wishes can easily keep Ferroseed healthy while the duo can wall the vast majority of physical attackers in the tier. Uxie, Mesprit, and Sigilyph are other Psychic-types that can be used to check the Fighting-type Pokemon that Ferroseed dislikes. Although Ferroseed matches up well against the likes of Cryogonal and Kabutops, a spinblocker is a decent option to ensure that the entry hazards Ferroseed typically lays down aren't removed. Spiritomb and Rotom are the best choices since each can deal with the best spinner in the tier—Kabutops—reliably in most circumstances. Spiritomb can also handle Cryogonal without much difficulty. Any offensive Pokemon that has decent synergy with Ferroseed and benefits from Spikes, and possibly paralysis, support can make for good teammates. Druddigon and Sigilyph generally struggle with Steel-types, all of which are grounded, thus making them vulnerable to the Spikes Ferroseed can lay down. Moltres and Magmortar enjoy paralysis support and the Spikes Ferroseed lays can quickly wear down Lanturn, arguably their best check, which lacks reliable recovery. Moltres is also notable for its ability to wipe out most Fighting-types in the tier with its absurdly powerful STAB Hurricane. Finally, a Stealth Rock user is useful to form an entry hazard setting core with Ferroseed. Golurk, Uxie, and Rhydon are the most notable as each can resist Fighting- or Fire-type moves for Ferroseed.</p> "

  "Klinklang": {
    "overview": "<p>Klinklang has always been a very odd Pokemon. Its Steel typing and high base 115 Defense seemed to suggest a more defensive Pokemon, whereas its strong base 100 Attack and signature move Shift Gear gave it more of an offensive quality. Ultimately, Klinklang takes advantage of both these traits to succeed. Its good defenses and excellent typing enable it to set up Substitutes with relative ease, behind which it can freely set up with Shift Gear. Klinklang is exceedingly difficult to revenge kill; after a Shift Gear, there are no unboosted Pokemon in RU that can even attempt to outspeed Klinklang. On top of this, Klinklang boasts a resistance to several common priority moves, such as Quick Attack, Shadow Sneak, and Bullet Punch, whilst only sporting a weakness to Mach Punch and Vacuum Wave. However, Klinklang does have its fair share of hard counters, primarily due to its lack of coverage. Opposing Steel-types, such as Steelix and Ferroseed, are particularly tricky to get past as they resist or are immune to all of Klinklang's commonly used moves. Fortunately, the majority of Klinklang's counters lack reliable recovery, and can therefore be broken past with the help of hazards and a little prior damage. Klinklang doesn't boast much in the movepool department, and often has to rely on Return to patch up its less than stellar coverage. It is important when playing with Klinklang to be aware of its weaknesses and limitations; do not expect it to OHKO a vast number of Pokemon off the bat and without any prior set up. Klinklang works best as a late-game sweeper, cleaning up weakened teams once it has boosted its Speed and Attack.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Unfortunately, Klinklang's useful movepool is as barren as the Sahara, so don't expect to find many excellent suggestions here. Nevertheless, Klinklang does have some relatively interesting options. Volt Switch can be used to maintain or grab offensive momentum, as well as hitting Water-types hard (without Wild Charge's annoying recoil), and enabling it to escape the occasional Magneton. However, Volt Switch has a relatively low Base Power and also forces Klinklang to switch, which can be a pain if it has already accumulated several Shift Gear boosts. Klinklang also has access to Trick Room, which it can use in conjunction with Volt Switch to give frailer Pokemon the chance to come in for free. A ChestoRest set, with Rest over Substitute, can give Klinklang the chance to set up more than once, as well as reducing its weakness to status. However, this set accomplishes little that Substitute variants can't, and Substitute is a much more effective way of getting around status than Rest. Klinklang can also make decent use of Air Balloon or the move Magnet Rise to get around its Ground weakness. This also makes it impossible for Steelix to stop Klinklang, apart from phazing it with Roar. In a cruel twist of fate, the Pokemon gods gave Klinklang a surprisingly decent special movepool. Charge Beam, Flash Cannon, Thunderbolt, and various Hidden Powers are all options for a surprise set, although Magneton is superior in almost all cases.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>The list of Klinklang's counters is highly dependent on which coverage moves it runs (or doesn't run), as it doesn't have a huge amount of counters that can take anything it throws at them. Steel-types make for the most reliable counters as they resist both Steel- and Normal-type attacks, as well as possessing naturally high Defense stats. Steelix is perhaps the best Klinklang counter out there; it resists Gear Grind and Return, is immune to Wild Charge, and can either phaze Klinklang out with Roar—thus robbing it of its boosts—or hit it hard with a STAB Earthquake. Magneton can trap Klinklang with Magnet Pull and set up on it with Charge Beam. Aggron, too, has an excellent base 180 Defense to weather Klinklang's attacks, and a great base 110 Attack that it can use to, quite literally, throw a spanner in the works. Both Aggron and Magneton must be extremely wary of Hidden Power Ground, as it hits them on their weaker Special Defense and for 4x the damage. Both Ferroseed and Escavalier boast extremely high defenses and can either stall Klinklang out, or, in Escavalier's case, hit it hard with a Choice Band-boosted Megahorn. Again, it is wise to scout whether or not Klinklang is packing Hidden Power Fire before sending Escavalier or Ferroseed in to wall it.</p> <p>Quagsire and Poliwrath both resist Steel-type attacks and with enough investment can easily stomach a couple of Shift Gear-boosted Returns; however, Poliwrath must look out for Wild Charge. Rotom resists or is immune to all of Klinklang's commonly carried moves and can set up on it with Substitute or Charge Beam. Naturally, physically defensive Pokemon that do not necessarily pack resistances to Klinklang's attacks are also effective. Tangrowth, Steelix, and Entei all boast high attacking stats as well as defensive stats and therefore make for good checks. As long as it is not packing Wild Charge, Omastar and Moltres also make for good checks thanks to their access to powerful attacks and reasonable defenses.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Shift Gear",
        "description": "<p>The key to setting up with Klinklang is to make use of its excellent typing to set up a Substitute, either on a predicted switch or resisted attack. Once Klinklang is sitting safely behind its Substitute, use Shift Gear at your discretion until Klinklang has enough Speed and power to outpace and destroy everything on the opposing team. Gear Grind is a strong STAB move that has the additional benefit of being capable to take down Substitute and Focus Sash users with ease. Although Wild Charge may seem like a better choice thanks to its greater super effective coverage, Return is in fact a better choice overall. Return still 2HKOes Slowking, as well as allowing Klinklang to beat Qwilfish, whereas Klinklang loses to Poliwrath no matter which move you choose to run. Wild Charge does have the benefit of beating Moltres should you be unable keep Stealth Rock on the field, as well as enabling Klinklang to get past support Omastar. Finally, Return lets you hit Electric-types for good damage, which are arguably more dangerous than the couple of Pokemon you would be able to beat with Wild Charge, ultimately making Return the better choice.</p> <p>With the given moves, Klinklang hits the vast majority of types for neutral damage, apart from Steel-types. Fortunately, thanks to Substitute, Klinklang can easily set up on one of RU's most common Steel-types: Ferroseed. Ferroseed usually walls this set with ease but is unable to break Klinklang's Substitutes in two or three hits—let alone one—as well as not being able to paralyze Klinklang whilst it is behind a Substitute. On top of this, Substitute also defends Klinklang from Leech Seed (Ferroseed's only method of recovery) as well as all other status effects. After a Shift Gear boost Klinklang becomes very difficult to revenge kill thanks to its extremely high Speed, as well as its access to Gear Grind, which not only bypasses Sturdy Pokemon and Substitute users, but also gives Klinklang more chances to score a timely critical hit.</p> <p>Leftovers is the recommended item as it gives Klinklang the chance to set up five Substitutes, thus increasing its chances of setting up successfully, as well as granting greater longevity. However, Life Orb is another option thanks to the increased damage output, but unfortunately Klinklang will find itself losing a lot of health to passive damage, such as Substitute and recoil. The given EVs ensure that Klinklang outspeed Timid Choice Scarf Manectric after a boost, as well as maintaining maximum attacking power. An alternate EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Spe can be run for more bulk if you aren't preoccupied with the fastest Choice Scarf users. However, this spread does make it hard for Klinklang to check threats before a boost. Clear Body stops Intimidate and other stat lowering moves or abilities from robbing Klinklang of its boosts, as well as actually having an effect in singles, which makes it the superior ability. In order to remedy its coverage issues, Klinklang can run a choice of two Hidden Powers: Fire or Ground. Hidden Power Fire enables Klinklang to get past Ferroseed and Escavalier, whereas Hidden Power Ground easily dispatches Magneton and Aggron. However, it should be noted that neither of these two attacks is particularly effective against Steelix and that they should always be run with both a Naughty nature and Life Orb.</p> <p>Smeargle and Qwilfish make for great teammates as they can set up the hazards—Spikes in particular—that are a great help in ensuring Klinklang cleans up late-game. Magneton can trap and dispose of the Steel-types that frequently halt Klinklang's sweep, as well as giving Klinklang opportunities to switch in for free thanks to Magneton's slow Volt Switch. Special attacking wallbreakers are key to Klinklang's success; Moltres, Magmortar, Sceptile, and Sigilyph can all break past Klinklang's common counters. On top of this, the aforementioned Pokemon often lure in Pokemon, such as Clefable and Roselia, which Klinklang can set up on with ease. Klinklang benefits hugely from screen support, thanks to its high defenses and strong defensive typing, it will usually get the chance to set up more than once. Uxie therefore makes for a good teammate, as it can set up both Reflect and Light Screen, as well as laying down Stealth Rock and spreading paralysis.</p> "

  "Eelektross": {
    "overview": "<p>Eelektross is a very unique Pokemon, because thanks to its ability Levitate, it is the third Pokemon with essentially no weaknesses. Eelektross has an excellent movepool consisting of moves such as Thunderbolt, Giga Drain, and Flamethrower, giving it almost flawless coverage. Eelektross even has access to Coil, which allows it to be an effective bulky sweeper. Aside from its Speed, Eelektross has very good stats across the board, making it a very versatile Pokemon that can go both physically and specially offensive. Unfortunately, Eelektross faces competition from faster and more powerful Electric-types, such as Rotom-C, Galvantula, and Manectric, which all have superb coverage. Eelektross's bulk, while good, is not great, and because of its lack of resistances, most powerful attacks will be able to 2HKO it. Eelektross's low Speed is a double-edged sword because while it allows Eelektross to give its teammate a free switch-in with a slow Volt Switch, it also means that foes such as Aggron and Gallade can outspeed and OHKO Eelektross before it has a chance to do much of anything. Finally, Eelektross lacks any form of recovery outside of Drain Punch, Giga Drain, and Rest, meaning that it will get worn down rather easily. Overall, Eelektross is a very good Pokemon, but is only rewarding in a few niche roles.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>When looking at Eelektross you might have noticed it has a higher Attack than Special Attack. You can opt to use Choice Band on Eelektross, as it has many physical moves such as Wild Charge, Superpower, U-turn, and Aqua Tail. The problem is that it is generally inferior to the offensive pivot set, which carries better coverage moves. Furthermore, Wild Charge has recoil, hampering Eelektross's bulk. Though it's generally better to use the ones already listed, Eelektross has quite a few other moves it can used. Dragon Claw stands out the most as it hits Druddigon, Fraxure, and Altaria super effectively, giving Eelektross a shot at doing heavy damage to them. Charge Beam is Eelektross's only way of raising its Special Attack, but it's better off attacking right off the bat with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch, and Charge Beam is outclassed by Acid Spray, which forces more switches and has a guaranteed effect. Eelektross has access to other moves such as Flash Cannon, Rock Slide, Signal Beam, and Crunch, but they don't add much to Eelektross's coverage. Finally, a defensive variant of Eelektross can be used as it has good bulk and moves such Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Light Screen to benefit teammates. However, Eelektross's lack of reliable recovery hinders its ability to go defensive.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Eelektross is very difficult to counter, as very few things can handle both the Coil and offensive pivot sets. Druddigon stands out though, for it easily counters both, as it takes little damage due to its sheer bulk and can phaze out Eelektross or attack with Outrage. Altaria can do a similar job, but it might lose to the Coil set. Specially defensive Gallade handles the offensive pivot set well, and can also outspeed and cripple the Coil set with Will-O-Wisp. Clefable and Lickilicky can take any hit from the offensive pivot, wear down Eelektross with their attacks, and keep themselves healthy with Wish. Both Lickilicky and Clefable lose to the Coil set, however. The Coil set is easier to deal with because it is quite weak prior to boosting. Golurk completely walls the Coil set, only fearing the rare Aqua Tail, and can hit Eelektross hard with Shadow Punch. Taunt users such as Whimsicott and Misdreavus can prevent Eelektross from accumulating any boosts, and the former can even Encore Eelektross into Coil or Substitute. Quagsire stops Coil Eelektross completely because it ignores stat boosts thanks to its ability, Unaware. However, both Quagsire and Whimsicott lose to the special set. Choice Band users such as Emboar, Entei, and Aggron can all outspeed Eelektross and OHKO it with their STABs, but they can't handle Eelektross after a few Coil boosts.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Pivot",
        "description": "<p>Eelektross is an excellent offensive pivot thanks to its decent Special Attack, good bulk, and amazing coverage. Volt Switch grants it the ability to scout while still hitting relatively hard. What differentiates Eelektross from other Volt Switch users is its coverage. Flamethrower roasts Grass-types, such as Ferroseed, Rotom-C, and Lilligant, that resist its STAB moves, and Giga Drain takes care of any Pokemon with an Electric immunity such as Lanturn, Golurk, and Rhydon. Thunderbolt is an alternate STAB move, allowing Eelektross to deal more damage to foes like Slowking, Mandibuzz, and Poliwrath and giving it a more useful move in situations when you do not want to switch out.</p> <p>An alternate EV spread of 94 HP / 252 SpA / 162 Spe can be used to outspeed uninvested base 70s, such as specially defensive Magneton and Roselia, and still hit as hard as possible. However, Eelektross loses a great amount of bulk if using this EV spread. Leftovers is the preferred choice because it allows Eelektross to switch up moves and regain crucial HP; however, Choice Specs provides more power and gives Eelektross a chance to 2HKO walls such as Uxie, Spiritomb, and Cryogonal. Life Orb could be used as a sort of middle ground between Choice Specs and Leftovers, but the recoil counteracts Eelektross's main draw over other Electric-types: decent bulk and its lack of weaknesses. Speaking of items, Expert Belt can be used as it does not cause any recoil and Eelektross hits most of the tier for super effective damage. However, Eelektross appreciates the additional healing from Leftovers or the additional power from Choice Specs more, and it cannot hit many of its counters for super effective damage. Eelektross's fourth moveslot is very adaptable and can be changed for the benefit of your team. Superpower can replace Thunderbolt as it can 2HKO Normal-types such as Bouffalant, Clefable, and Lickilicky as well as OHKO Cryogonal, though a Mild nature should be used if running it. Acid Spray can be used over Volt Switch, as it acts as a pseudo-Nasty Plot and can prove very useful because Eelektross's other moves already provide neutral coverage.</p> <p>As Eelektross forces many switches, entry hazard support from teammates such as Smeargle, Omastar, Scolipede, and Crustle is recommended to put pressure on the opponent's team. Paralysis support from Pokemon such as Uxie, Slowking, and Druddigon is recommended to mitigate Eelektross's horrendous Speed. Frail Pokemon such as Zangoose and Durant appreciate Eelektross's slow Volt Switch because it provides a free switch-in and activates the former's Toxic Orb. The only Pokemon in RU that resists all of Eelektross's moves is Druddigon, so powerful Steel-types such as Aggron and Escavalier that can tank hits from Druddigon and strike back with their STABs make for good teammates. Samurott and Omastar are also great partners, as they can both strike Druddigon hard with Ice Beam, as well as lure Water- and Electric-types. Jynx OHKOes Druddigon that don't invest in Special Defense with Ice Beam as well, although it needs Stealth Rock to guarantee the KO if unboosted. Eelektross also fits very well on VoltTurn teams, so Pokemon such as Braviary, Rotom-C, and Mesprit are solid partners.</p> "

Despite Thunder Punch's low Base Power, it is a great STAB move as it doesn't have recoil like Wild Charge does. Drain Punch works well in conjunction with Thunder Punch because it gives Eelektross extra coverage against Pokemon such as Lanturn, Rotom-F, and Ferroseed, which are all immune or resistant, and allows it to recover HP. Substitute is a great option because with Eelektross's great bulk, its Substitute can survive a hit from defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, Lanturn, and Tangrowth. In addition, Substitute lets Eelektross avoid status and set up Coil boosts with greater ease.</p> <p>Max HP and Special Defense with a Careful nature are crucial, because without maximum investment Eelektross's Substitute cannot survive a hit from the Pokemon mentioned above and Coil boosts Defense anyways. Zap Cannon can be an alternative to Thunder Punch as it hits almost as hard, makes good use of Coil's accuracy boost, and always paralyzes the opponent, but with it, Eelektross can easily get PP stalled and lose to Calm Mind sweepers such as Uxie and Spiritomb. Furthermore, Zap Cannon has horrible accuracy before the Coil boost, and its power doesn't get increased by Coil, making it the inferior option overall. Dragon Tail is an acceptable option over Substitute because it forces out threats; if you choose that option, be sure to pair Eelektross with entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Crustle. Aqua Tail can be used as another attacking option, as it can hit bulky Fire- and Ground-types, such as Golurk and Camerupt (the former of which is immune to both of Eelektross's other attacking moves), much harder. Eelektross is walled by defensive Pokemon such as Rotom, Amoonguss, and Golurk. Pokemon that carry appropriate coverage to check these Pokemon, including Entei, Rotom-C, and Moltres, make great teammates. Both Entei and Moltres also help against Lilligant, which can cripple and set up on Eelektross with Sleep Powder and Quiver Dance. Finally, Eelektross appreciates Heal Bell and Wish support from Pokemon such as Clefable and Alomomola as there are many Pokemon that can status it before it sets up a Substitute.</p> "

  "Beheeyem": {
    "overview": "<p>There are three things about Beheeyem that fit together that should pique your interest upon immediate inspection of this kooky alien. First, its gigantic base 125 Special Attack. Second, its incredibly low Speed. And third, its ability Analytic. When combined with an item like Life Orb, Beheeyem's damage output is near-insanity. To make the most out of this power and its stat spread, Beheeyem will almost always employ an offensive Trick Room sweeper set, which flips the tables on a huge portion of RU teams and lets Beheeyem sweep quite handily. Beheeyem will also sometimes be seen simply wielding a Choice Specs to make the absolute most of its power. Outside of these roles though, Beheeyem is totally outclassed by the multitude of other Psychic-types that reside in RU, particularly Uxie, Mesprit, Sigilyph, and to a lesser extent Gardevoir.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Signal Beam is an option for a super effective hit on all of Absol, Crawdaunt, Tangrowth, Uxie, and Slowking in one move, but it's not as strong a hit on Drapion or Mandibuzz and other major threats such as Moltres, Omastar, and Sigilyph. In most cases, Psychic STAB + Thunderbolt grants Beheeyem the best possible coverage. Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball are other coverage options as well but are outclassed by Signal Beam and Hidden Power Fighting overall. One of the dual screens can be put in the last slot of the Trick Room sweeper and could possibly lengthen Beheeyem's sweep, but most of the time its better off simply firing off powerful hits.</p> <p>Choice Specs + Analytic grants Beheeyem truly terrifying power, but it's so slow and relatively frail that it's hard to get in and fire off an attack successfully (granted, when it happens something is likely going down). A Calm Mind set could be used since Beheeyem is decently specially bulky, but its Speed and physical frailty is an issue when compared to other Calm Mind users like Uxie and Mesprit. The rest of Beheeyem's support movepool is simply used better by the other Psychic-types in the tier.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Spiritomb is the best initial counter to Beheeyem. It's immune to Psychic and Hidden Power Fighting, is neutral to Thunderbolt, takes advantage of Trick Room itself, and does a major number on Beheeyem with Shadow Sneak, Sucker Punch, and Dark Pulse. Drapion is another good answer as it too is neutral to Thunderbolt and immune to Psychic and annihilates Beheeyem with Crunch. Absol and other Dark-types can work but Hidden Power Fighting and Thunderbolt are major threats. Slowking is a great answer to Beheeyem despite the weakness to Thunderbolt and can status Beheeyem or 2HKO it with Scald after Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage.</p> <p>Uxie and Mesprit are good checks to Beheeyem as they can stall out Trick Room turns and take little damage from Beheeyem's attacks. Steelix, Klinklang, Escavalier, and other Steel-types make good checks as well but should be wary of Beheeyem's coverage options. Sucker Punch, Extreme Speed Entei, and Aqua Jet Kabutops are great answers to Beheeyem under Trick Room if your team lacks any bulky check to it. There are actually a few options that can tank a hit from Beheeyem and OHKO back or status it such as Bouffalant, Druddigon, Lanturn, and Magneton. Finally, if Beheeyem is outside of Trick Room, don't beat around the bush, just hit it with whatever you got to weaken it.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<p>The idea with this set is simple: get Beheeyem in late-game, set up Trick Room, and proceed to destroy all that stand before you. Beheeyem has a lot of options at its disposal, but it can only have so many on its set at a time, so your team needs to patch up the holes that Beheeyem will miss in its coverage. Psychic is the main STAB option since it blasts through many of the more physically defensive-inclined Pokemon in RU, particularly Tangrowth, Amoonguss, Crustle, Rhydon, and Feraligatr. Psyshock is also viable and hits Cryogonal, Clefable, Gallade, Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, and Lilligant significantly harder. Thunderbolt gets fantastic coverage when paired with Psychic-type STAB, nailing Mandibuzz, Slowking, and Crawdaunt for super effective damage and getting a nice hit on Drapion, Spiritomb, and Absol. In the last slot, Substitute is preferred to let Beheeyem dodge Sucker Punches and block status. However, Hidden Power Fighting is an option as well to blast Steelix and other Steel-types, as well as get a super effective hit on Absol.</p> <p>Drop Beheeyem's Speed down as low as possible to outspeed everything in Trick Room, and nothing out of it to get the Analytic boost. Nasty Plot is about the only move not talked about so far that has a place on the set, though Beheeyem wants as much time in Trick Room as possible, and it isn't the sturdiest of Pokemon to be able to waste turns of set up (it's cleanly 2HKOed by 0 Attack Steelix's Earthquake after Stealth Rock and Life Orb damage, meaning that it really can't set up on much of anything even with 252 HP EVs).</p> <p>Like Slowking, Beheeyem can be a standalone OTR sweeper partnered with something like Escavalier, offering way more power in place of bulk. Alternatively, Beheeyem can be used on a dedicated Trick Room team, where it isn't too bad as a sweeper and secondary setter. If using Substitute, using Magneton to get rid of Steel-types helps tremendously, and Magneton is a nice switch into Spiritomb, which otherwise completely blocks Beheeyem. Fire-types like Magmortar and Entei are also nice switches into Spiritomb to absorb Will-O-Wisp. Escavalier offers fantastic typing synergy with Beheeyem and works fantastically in Trick Room itself, destroying Spiritomb, Drapion, and Absol, which are all major threats to Beheeyem.</p> <p>Trick Room lead Smeargle is a cool teammate as well since it's played super aggressively, will probably put an opponent to sleep, and will suicide, allowing Beheeyem to come in for free and start blasting stuff. Protection from priority from Entei and Kabutops is needed as well. Qwilfish stomps all over Entei and provides Spikes for Beheeyem as well. Tangrowth and Ferroseed are awesome answers to Kabutops, and the latter can provide Stealth Rock as well.</p> <p>Entry hazards in general are cool to support Beheeyem with. Here are some damage calculations to show the effectiveness of providing entry hazard support:</p> <ul> <li>Psychic vs 252/0 Tangrowth: 87.12 - 103.21% (guaranteed OHKO after Stealth Rock) <li>Psychic vs 0/0 Magmortar: 73.53 - 86.94% (87.25% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>Psychic vs 0/0 Electivire: 89.69 - 105.84% (guaranteed OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>Psychic vs 0/0 Rotom-C: 79.66 - 94.19% (50% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs 0/0 Absol: 89.66 - 105.53% (guaranteed OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>Thunderbolt vs 4/0 Durant: 99.61 - 117.44% (guaranteed OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>Psyshock vs 200/0 Gallade: 79.2 - 93.27% (81.25% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock and Spikes)</li> <li>Psyshock vs 0/0 Lilligant: 91.84 - 108.15% (guaranteed OHKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>Psyshock vs 40/252 Lanturn: 49.62 - 58.6% (guaranteed 2HKO after Stealth Rock)</li> <li>Hidden Power Fighting vs 252/36 Steelix: 80.79 - 95.48% (68.75% chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock and Spikes)</li> </ul> <p>It should be noted that none of those calculations need hazards if Beheeyem is outside of Trick Room and the Analytic boost is added.</p> "

  "Fraxure": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being NFE, Fraxure is not a Pokemon to be taken lightly. Its stellar base 117 Attack, STAB Outrage, and access to the incredible boosting move Dragon Dance give it a spot among RU's biggest threats. BW2's move tutors were also extremely kind to Fraxure, supplementing its once limited coverage. Now, Fraxure can use Fighting- and Water-type attacks to break down the few RU tanks capable of surviving boosted Outrages. Although Druddigon's higher base Attack stat and better movepool might seem enticing, Fraxure's higher Speed, ability to hold Eviolite, and most importantly, access to Dragon Dance give Fraxure an edge over its Dragon-type competition. While a more offensive metagame has made setting up more difficult for the fairly frail Fraxure, once it has set up it can easily run through many teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Outside of Dragon Dance, Fraxure's options are somewhat limited. Night Slash and X-Scissor could be used as coverage moves, but most of the targets they attempt to cover are hit harder by Outrage. Fraxure can utilize the famed RestTalk combination in conjunction with Eviolite to avoid status and boost with Dragon Dance even while asleep. However, such a set faces extreme competition from Altaria and even Shelgon, and would be unlikely to succeed in RU's more offensive metagame. Fraxure does have access to Swords Dance, which could be used alongside Dragon Dance to allow Fraxure to pick which boost it needs to sweep. However, the utility of Taunt and consistency of Dragon Dance usually overshadow the sheer power that comes with Swords Dance. Perhaps Fraxure's most viable option not touched on above is its Choice Band set. With a Choice Band attached, Fraxure becomes even more immediately threatening to counters such as Steelix, Escavalier, and Ferroseed. It also allows Fraxure to use Superpower more consistently as it plays as more of a hit-and-run attacker. However, the inability of Choice Band Fraxure to boost its Speed as well as its lower defensive capabilities without Eviolite will prevent it from doing much against an offensive team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>There are a few Pokemon in RU capable of standing up to Fraxure. Escavalier is likely the safest bet. It resists Outrage, takes little damage from Low Kick, and can strike back with its powerful Megahorn. Ferroseed is in a similar position, but needs Gyro Ball to avoid being setup bait for any Fraxure carrying Taunt and must also watch out for the uncommon Superpower. Tangrowth can check Fraxure well despite not resisting Outrage. Although it risks a 2HKO from +1 Life Orb Outrage after Stealth Rock, it checks the Eviolite set well if it carries Hidden Power Ice. Unfortunately, Leech Seed and Sleep Powder are inconsistent ways to deal with Fraxure because of Taunt. For more offensive teams, often the best way to deal with Fraxure is to avoid letting it set up and hit it with powerful attacks. Even if Fraxure does manage to snag a Dragon Dance, all is not lost. Fraxure is still fairly frail even with an Eviolite boost, allowing powerful priority, such as Extreme Speed from Choice Band Entei, to hit Fraxure hard. Most Choice Scarf users can easily outpace Fraxure due to its low Speed, so powerful users of the item such as Manectric and Typhlosion can take out Fraxure if needed, although it should be noted that Fraxure needs to be significantly weakened for it to be in the KO range of the latter two, as Fraxure resists both of their STAB moves.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<p>With this set, Fraxure acts as an excellent trump card for offensive teams. Dragon Dance boosts Fraxure's already great Attack stat to impressive levels, allowing it to reach 499 with a Jolly nature and a whopping 549 with an Adamant nature. Dragon Dance also patches up one of Fraxure's biggest weaknesses in terms of sweeping: its Speed stat. After a Dragon Dance, Fraxure reaches 349 with an Adamant nature, enough to outpace Jolly Durant, and 384 with a Jolly nature, more than Jolly Swellow. Outrage packs a ton of power and allows Fraxure to weaken offensive and defensive teams alike. Low Kick grants Fraxure much needed coverage, allowing Fraxure to 2HKO standard Steelix and OHKO Aggron, regardless of Fraxure's choice of item or nature. Taunt allows Fraxure to boost in the face of opponents such as Tangrowth, Clefable, and Roselia, as well as preventing phazing and setup attempts.</p> <p>While Fraxure is always a force to be reckoned with, the choice of item and nature will greatly impact what Fraxure can and cannot do. Eviolite is the safer item choice in such an offensive metagame, protecting Fraxure from revenge killing attempts and allowing it to set up more easily. Life Orb gives Fraxure quite a power boost, but at the cost of being more prone to unresisted attacks. A Jolly nature greatly reduces the amount of Pokemon able to revenge kill Fraxure after a boost, while an Adamant nature gives it 10% harder hitting attacks in exchange for being vulnerable to Pokemon such as Archeops, Sceptile, and Swellow. Generally, a Jolly nature with Eviolite is recommended, though teams in need of a potent stallbreaker could consider mixing and matching natures and items as they see fit.</p> <p>Despite Taunt's utility against more defensive teams, there are multiple other options that can be considered for Fraxure's set. Dragon Claw provides Fraxure with a STAB move without the disadvantage of being locked into Outrage. Dual Chop packs the same power and allows Fraxure to break Focus Sashes and Substitutes at the cost of slightly lower accuracy. Aqua Tail allows Fraxure to hit Pokemon such as Golurk and Rhydon harder, but they are threatened by Outrage or Low Kick anyway. As an alternative Fighting-type attack, Superpower can be used in place of Low Kick for a stronger hit on Escavalier, Durant, and Ferroseed, but it is generally better to use Fraxure's teammates to weaken these Pokemon to the point that Fraxure can sweep. Finally, Substitute can be used to protect Fraxure further against status and revenge killers like Entei and especially Ditto, which could otherwise steal Fraxure's boosts and reverse its sweep.</p> <p>Entry hazards greatly aid Fraxure in breaking down its sturdiest counters. Stealth Rock and Spikes limit the amount of times Tangrowth, Steelix, Escavalier, and Ferroseed can withstand Fraxure's powerful attacks. Smeargle gets a special mention for its ability to set up both Stealth Rock and Spikes while easily fitting into the more offensive teams where Fraxure belongs. Qwilfish, though more defensive in nature, can set up Spikes and spread paralysis for Fraxure, and is also capable of switching into both Ice-type attacks and threats such as Extreme Speed Entei that wish to revenge kill Fraxure.</p> <p>Dragon Dance Fraxure also appreciates powerful wallbreakers to aid in its sweep. Gallade is one of the best in tier, being able to break down many common defensive cores with Swords Dance-boosted attacks and great coverage. In fact, Swords Dance Gallade is one of Fraxure's best partners overall, as almost nothing in RU can withstand their onslaught. Moltres and Magmortar are in a similar position, using powerful special attacks to weaken the opposition into Fraxure's KO range. In return, Fraxure can use its resistance to Water-type attacks to set up on the bulky Water-types that often try to wall Magmortar and Moltres.</p> "

  "Accelgor": {
    "overview": "<p>Accelgor is notable in RU, or any tier, for its amazing base 145 Speed, making it one of the fastest Pokemon in the game. Accelgor's Bug typing is decent offensively, and gives Accelgor a set of useful resistances to common attacking types. Accelgor complements its excellent Speed with a fair base 100 Special Attack stat which, along with its good STAB options and strong coverage, makes it a dangerous attacker. Furthermore, in addition to being one of the best and most reliable Spikes users in the game, Accelgor has an excellent support movepool that is superbly designed to frustrate an opponent. Things are not entirely rosy for Accelgor, however. It has absolutely pathetic defenses; almost any neutral attack will OHKO it. Additionally, its Special Attack will frequently find itself lacking, missing out on many crucial KOs. Regardless, whether it is running an attacking set or a support set, Accelgor is a threat to be considered when building a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>With access to Baton Pass, Acid Armor, Agility, and Curse, Accelgor is capable of effectively utilizing Baton Pass, passing Defense or Speed boosts to slower Pokemon that appreciate the boosts and can then attempt to sweep the opponent. For example, Eviolite Rhydon with a Curse and an Agility becomes very threatening for the opponent to deal with, either attacking them outright or setting up further boosts on the switch. When using Curse, White Herb is a useful item as it nullifies the stat drop in Speed. Me First is a niche move, but can be used on occasion to find surprise kills on Pokemon such as Altaria, which is OHKOed by its own Draco Meteor. Acid Spray can be used to weaken an opponents switch-in, halving their Special Defense and setting them up for a heavy blow the following turn.</p> <p>Encore can be used to gain free attacking or setup turns by locking an opponent into a non-damaging move. Despite the lack of Taunt, Accelgor can attempt to aid in wall breaking through the use of Toxic. Guard Split can be used to weaken opposing walls while simultaneously boosting its own defenses. Access to Struggle Bug allows Accelgor to function as a last-ditch check to special attackers, lowering their Special Attack. Pursuit can be used to ensure that weakened opponents do not survive; however, its low base Attack means that the opponent would have to be severely weakened for this strategy to work. Accelgor can also function on rain teams, being the fastest user of Rain Dance in the tier. Accelgor can then benefit by gaining a status immunity with its secondary ability, Hydration.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Accelgor lacks overwhelming power, so Pokemon with strong Special Defense such as Cryogonal can sit in front of Accelgor all day with little issue. Other notable special walls that will beat Accelgor easily include Drapion, Roselia and Mandibuzz. Taunt users such as Drapion will completely shut down the lead set, although Accelgor will outspeed all common users of the move and still get a layer of Spikes up in the end. Fire-, Flying-, and Ghost-types all resist Accelgor's primary offensive options and can threaten with super effective attacks or whittle down Accelgor with Shadow Ball in return, in the case of Ghost-types. Entei is a great example of a Fire-type check to Accelgor, switching in on anything other than Hidden Power Rock and OHKOing with Extreme Speed. Status ruins Accelgor, particularly paralysis which strips it of its primary asset.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>With this set, Accelgor attempts to use its good Special Attack and solid neutral coverage to facilitate a sweep. Bug Buzz is Accelgor's strongest and most reliable STAB attack, and is thus its primary attacking option, hitting most Pokemon for neutral damage. Focus Blast is used alongside Bug Buzz to give Accelgor a way to damage the Steel- and Rock-types that resist Bug Buzz. Hidden Power Rock completes Accelgor's coverage, letting it hit Fire- and Flying-types super effectively, notably Moltres, who would otherwise force Accelgor out and greatly threaten the rest of the team. In the last slot, Spikes is a nice option that allows Accelgor to be useful even when faced with walls it can't do much damage to, such as Escavalier. Giga Drain is another good choice; it doesn't add much to Accelgor's coverage, but it does give it a chance to recover some of the HP lost to entry hazards and Life Orb recoil, especially against Water-types such as Lanturn and Poliwrath.</p> <p>A Timid nature is preferable to Modest, as it allows Accelgor to outspeed several common Choice Scarf users, such as Jolly Medicham and Modest Moltres. Furthermore, it ensures that Accelgor can outspeed Pokemon such as Modest Gorebyss and Modest Omastar after a Shell Smash, notable Pokemon to outspeed. Additionally, the power loss is often unnoticeable, still managing to OHKO Lilligant and Moltres with a Life Orb-boosted Bug Buzz and Hidden Power Rock, respectively. Life Orb is the preferred item as Accelgor needs as much additional power as it can muster, while Choice Specs provides even more power at the cost of being locked into one move. Sticky Hold is chosen to ensure that Accelgor is insusceptible to Trick, as being Tricked a Choice item would effectively neutralize it when it is not carrying Choice Specs.</p> <p>Sludge Bomb is an option for additional neutral coverage; however, Bug Buzz overlaps with its only super effective coverage. When using Choice Specs, U-turn is a great option in the fourth slot, giving Accelgor a useful way to scout opposing switch-ins and gain momentum. Accelgor can also use Recover to heal itself on predicted switches, although it's usually better off firing away with an attack or setting up Spikes on those free turns. Offensive Accelgor greatly appreciates Rapid Spin support due to its vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards, while also appreciating the support of hazards of its own to heighten its sweeping potential. Ghost-types primarily wall Accelgor due to their resistance and immunity to Bug Buzz and Focus Blast, respectively. Pursuit support or strong offensive Dark-types, such as Spiritomb and Absol, are appreciated as teammates.</p> "

It also has access to a rarely seen move in Final Gambit, which can completely disrupt your opponents, most likely knocking out of one their Pokemon and possibly destroying their spinner. With maximum HP investment, Accelgor reaches 364 HP, allowing it to OHKO the majority of the RU metagame in exchange for its own life. Its ridiculously high Speed stat means that no unboosted Pokemon will be outspeeding Accelgor anytime soon, allowing it to set up at least 1 layer of Spikes (most likely 2 layers thanks to Focus Sash). Even if knocked down to 1 HP, Final Gambit can still be helpful, as it blocks Rapid Spin users from landing their attack, thus preventing them from spinning away your hazards.</p> <p>Bug Buzz is a good STAB option, and Focus Blast complements it well, allowing Accelgor to demolish Steel- and Rock-types without having to use Final Gambit to do so. Hidden Power Rock is an alternative to Focus Blast, and can be used in order to deal a massive amount of damage to Moltres and, more importantly, defeat Aerodactyl and Scolipede one-on-one.</p> <p>A Timid nature with 252 Speed EVs lets Accelgor outrun the entirety of the unboosted RU metagame, capping out at an amazing 427 Speed. Maximum HP investment is used in order to allow for Final Gambit to deal 364 points of direct damage to the opposition when Accelgor is at full health. Sticky Hold is the ability of choice, completely disrupting Trick users such as Rotom. Focus Sash is used in order to let Accelgor live a hit, basically guaranteeing at least 2 layers of Spikes if you choose. This Accelgor is naturally very good on offensive teams, providing Spikes and possibly knocking out the opponent's Rapid Spin user. Partners with Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes are appreciated, as this Accelgor can demolish opposing spinners, thus making your other hazards much more deadly. Every sweeper will benefit from this Pokemon, enjoying the luxury of being able to destroy the opposition much more easily with hazard support.</p> <p>Giga Drain is an option in the last slot, letting Accelgor hit Water-types and Rhydon harder, but the coverage provided by Focus Blast and Hidden Power Rock is usually much more useful. Yawn is also an option in order to potentially cripple one of the enemy's Pokemon; however, Final Gambit makes Yawn somewhat redundant. U-turn is another option, letting Accelgor scout out the opponent and bring in one of its teammates for a more reasonable match-up, but again, Final Gambit makes it relatively useless. Finally, Recover is also an option in order to restore Accelgor's HP, and can work well in tandem with Final Gambit.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Encore",
        "description": "<p>With this set, Accelgor can play the role of both a momentum thief and team supporter. By using enough Speed EVs to beat even Jolly Choice Scarf Medicham--and, occasionally, its useful resistances to Ground, Grass, and Fighting--it can come in on a large number of Pokemon attempting to set up and Encore the set-up move in order to render them helpless. The key to this set is Substitute; it eases prediction for Accelgor, and when used in conjunction with Baton Pass, a teammate can get in safely without fearing status. In addition, should the Substitute manage to stay intact, you get even more momentum. Bug Buzz lets Accelgor finish off weakened opponents if the opportunity presents itself; it goes some way to hide this set's true purpose, and is a generally useful STAB move. The fact that this set can even set up in the face of Trick is just the icing on the cake.</p> <p>The EV spread is used to allow Accelgor to make 5 Substitutes instead of 4 if it's at full health, letting it stall out field effects such as rain and Trick Room if need be. If you are using 2 attacks instead of Baton Pass, an alternate spread of 16 HP / 240 SpA / 252 Spe is suggested to maintain the same effect while letting Accelgor threaten things more directly. Focus Blast is an excellent move for this purpose, dealing with Aggron, Klinklang, and Steelix--all of which are common switch-ins to Accelgor. Other options include Hidden Power Rock to deal with opponents that resist this combination such as Moltres and Scyther or Hidden Power Ghost to deal with opposing bulky Ghost-types.</p> <p>Because this set has a rather nasty case of four-moveslot syndrome, there will always be something that isn't covered; partners for this set should be considered with this in mind. If Accelgor lacks Focus Blast, Klinklang gives this set trouble, outspeeding Accelgor after Shift Gear and not worrying about Substitute thanks to Gear Grind. While Whimsicott is not likely to switch into Accelgor for fear of Bug Buzz, other Prankster users such as Murkrow and Volbeat are not friendly to this set. For both of these reasons, Steelix makes a great partner, as it is immune to Thunder Wave, laughs at Klinklang, and phazes away any of the opponent's boosts. Speaking of Prankster, priority is another worry for this set; as such, Lanturn pairs well with this set, resisting Aqua Jet while threatening Entei, the main Extreme Speed user.</p> "

  "Druddigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Don't let Druddigon's juvenile design fool you into thinking it can't pull its weight in a match; on the contrary, it is one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the tier. Druddigon resides in a select circle of viable Dragon-type Pokemon in RU, having the qualities needed to take full advantage of this rare trait. Its high Attack stat makes it capable of powering through many Pokemon with its powerful Outrage, a trait magnified by the limited number of Steel-types available in the tier; while the move's unsavory lock-in effect can occasionally prove inconvenient, Druddigon's ability to power through most Pokemon attempting to switch in means this drawback can often be ignored. The useful resistances that come with Druddigon's Dragon typing, complemented by its respectable 77 / 90 / 90 defenses, make it very capable of switching into and dismantling the Fire / Water / Grass cores that plague the metagame. Druddigon also retains two useful abilities in Rough Skin and Sheer Force, which it can use to either passively wear down Pokemon such as Entei or act as a potent lure in the form of a mixed set. Druddigon's movepool tailors to its needs quite well, granting it respectable STAB moves and coverage options to work with as well as an assortment of useful support options for it to take advantage of.</p> <p>While Druddigon is a true force in the metagame, its low base Speed hinders its performance against most faster threats, forcing it to fall back on its bulk to take hits instead. Moreover, its lack of recovery beyond Leftovers and the unreliable RestTalk combination make Druddigon highly susceptible to being worn down. Notwithstanding, Druddigon remains a unique and dangerous threat, so be wary of underestimating it lest you invoke its wrath.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hone Claws is an interesting tool for improving Druddigon's Attack stat, though its low Speed prevents it from taking full advantage of the move outside of a dedicated Trick Room team. Druddigon has access to Taunt, which could be an interesting option for shutting down checks such as Alomomola, though Druddigon's poor Speed again prevents it from making good use of the move. Pursuit is an interesting move to carry, though for the most part Druddigon doesn't scare Ghost-types out particularly well, as most would rather attempt to burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and generally speaking without any form of boost from STAB or ability, Pursuit is rather weak.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>In the most conventional sense, Steel-types are probably the most effective counters to Druddigon, resisting its STAB and generally not caring much about paralysis from Glare due to their characteristically low Speed, though they all need to be wary of its coverage moves. Steelix in particular is problematic for Druddigon, taking any two attacks from it barring the mixed set's Flamethrower by merit of its mammoth physical bulk. Pokemon such as Escavalier and Aggron can steamroll Druddigon with powerful Choice Band-boosted Megahorns and Head Smashes, respectively, and Durant can set up Hone Claws on a locked-in Druddigon. Pokemon with good natural physical bulk, such as Rhydon and Tangrowth, can take most of Druddigon's attacks well, though they struggle to takes hits from the Choice Band and mixed set. However, more often than not, exploiting Druddigon's lower Speed is the best method of checking it, as most Pokemon struggle to take multiple attacks. Fast Pokemon such as Accelgor and Aerodactyl are able to outpace it and put it out of commission after enough prior damage, and Pokemon such as Uxie can take a hit by merit of their bulk and KO after Druddigon has been worn down enough. Powerful Ice-types, such as Jynx and Cryogonal, are usually able to OHKO Druddigon with their powerful STAB attacks. Druddigon as a whole is very susceptible to being worn down and simply crumples from switching in on Pokemon such as Sceptile after switching into entry hazards and attacks enough. The support set, when utilizing RestTalk, falls prey to Substitute users, which are capable of avoiding Druddigon's Glare and phazing prowess.</p> ",

Outrage provides a powerful STAB attack capable of dealing large damage to anything that does not resist it. On the other hand, Dragon Claw provides a much safer attacking option that does not require Druddigon to lock itself in. Earthquake provides Druddigon with a powerful coverage move allowing it to hit Steel-types hard and also hit several common Pokemon, such as Aggron, Kabutops, and Entei, hard without having to lock itself into Outrage. Lastly, Sucker Punch offers Druddigon a moderately powerful priority attack that allows it to mitigate its poor Speed stat and pick off weakened Pokemon.</p> <p>The given EV spread seeks to maximize offensive presence and bulk, with 20 Speed EVs allowing Druddigon to outpace Tangrowth and hit it again before being put to sleep. If need be, Druddigon can invest more heavily in Speed to outpace Pokemon such as Clefable and Lanturn, though the loss in bulk resulting from this is evident when faced with powerful attackers such as Sceptile and Rotom. Superpower and Fire Punch both offer Druddigon alternative coverage moves capable of hitting Steel-types, with the former being capable of punishing bulky Normal-types as well and the latter hitting Pokemon such as Escavalier and Durant that enjoy switching into Druddigon's STAB attacks as well as hitting Ice-types such as Cryogonal consistently without locking into Outrage. As contradictory as it sounds, if one's team can afford an alternative Stealth Rock user, Leftovers Druddigon in its own right is quite viable and threatening, taking advantage of the free moveslot to utilize another attacking option such as Dragon Claw, a secondary coverage move, Glare for crippling faster attackers, or even Substitute to minimize prediction.</p> <p>Generally speaking, powerful offensive Pokemon such as Durant are useful teammates for Druddigon for their ability to wear down dedicated physical walls such as Poliwrath and Steelix so it can more effectively break through them. Spikes support is appreciated for Druddigon considering most of its checks and counters are grounded. Ferroseed and Qwilfish are useful for this purpose, setting up hazards against a respectable amount of common switch-ins to Druddigon. Powerful Fighting- and Ground-types offer a more direct way of pressuring Steel-types that trouble Druddigon. Moltres and Gallade can both pressure Steel-types rather well, with Druddigon in turn helping to barrel through some of their prospective checks with its STAB attacks.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>Druddigon's solid Attack stat, Dragon STAB, and numerous opportunities to switch in lend itself to being a potent Choice Band user. Outrage is Druddigon's primary STAB move and hits everything barring Steel-types for an impressive amount of damage. Superpower and Earthquake both offer Druddigon coverage options for combating Steel-types, with both providing their own benefits. Superpower allows Druddigon to hit Ferroseed hard, while also punishing incoming Normal-types, whereas Earthquake, while not offering any particular coverage against Steel-types that Superpower lacks, allows Druddigon to hit Fire-types it innately checks hard without having to lock itself into Outrage. Earthquake's lack of stat drops is also important, as it allows it to better handle Pokemon such as Steelix, which can otherwise 2HKO with Earthquake when taking into account Defense drops. Sucker Punch allows Druddigon to mitigate its poor Speed stat, picking off weakened or frail Pokemon that would otherwise threaten it. However, being Choice-locked into Sucker Punch is dangerous, so it should be used only in instances of absolute necessity. That said, Fire Punch offers Druddigon a feasible alternative, allowing it to hit Pokemon such as Escavalier, Durant, and Ferroseed hard. Dragon Claw grants Druddigon a \"safe\" Dragon STAB, allowing it to fire off Dragon-type attacks mid-game without giving Steel-types more than one free turn to work with or becoming too vulnerable to being taken out by a strong Ice- or Dragon-type attack.</p> <p>The EV spread seeks to maximize offensive presence and bulk, with 20 Speed EVs allowing Druddigon to outpace Tangrowth and hit it again before being put to sleep, ensuring it can be 2HKOed with Outrage after Stealth Rock damage. Druddigon can also bump up its Speed to outpace Pokemon such as Lanturn before they can attempt to burn it with Scald, though taking away from bulk does somewhat hurt Druddigon's ability to pivot into attacks. In a similar vein, Druddigon performs admirably in Trick Room, with its lower base Speed turned to a boon, and is one of the tier's most dangerous Trick Room sweepers. Should it be used as such, a spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD with a Brave nature should be used to \"maximize\" its Speed. Thunder Punch is a decent option, allowing Druddigon to hit bulky Water-types such as Slowking and Poliwrath without locking itself into Outrage.</p> <p>As Choice Band Druddigon generally faces very few Pokemon that can readily take on multiple attacks from it, other hard-hitting physical attackers are excellent partners for overloading physical walls and sweeping. Pokemon such as Rock Polish Rhydon and Durant make solid examples of this, being able to pressure Steel-types that can check Druddigon and in turn spring-boarding off Druddigon's attacks. Strong Fighting- and Fire-types are also cool partners to Druddigon, as their ability to steamroll through Steel-types makes Druddigon's STAB attacks that much more effectual. Examples of these are Gallade, Entei, and Moltres. As Druddigon's typing lends itself to switching in on a plethora of attacks, it will find itself being worn down by hazard damage rather quickly. Rapid Spin users such as Cryogonal and Kabutops mitigate this issue, as well as offering a reasonable Ice-type resistance.</p> "

        "name": "Mixed",
        "description": "<p>By utilizing its Sheer Force ability in conjunction with Life Orb, Druddigon is capable of luring in and KOing several of its usual checks and counters. Outrage remains as powerful as ever, dealing massive damage to all those that don't resist it. Dragon Claw can be utilized over this, as while the drop in power is very noticeable, it allows Druddigon more leniency in taking advantage of its STAB earlier in a match, as well as functioning better in conjunction with Substitute. Flamethrower is what makes this set tick, allowing it to safely and cleanly break through Pokemon such as Steelix, Tangrowth, and Escavalier, 2HKOing the former two and OHKOing the latter after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake, while seemingly providing redundant coverage, is invaluable for hitting an assortment of Pokemon hard without resorting to locking Druddigon into Outrage, including but not limited to Aggron, Kabutops, and Omastar. Sucker Punch offers Druddigon a useful priority move to pick off faster threats such as Galvantula and Sceptile, among others. On the other hand, Substitute capitalizes on the switches Druddigon forces and the surprise value of the set, allowing it to safely hide behind a Substitute while also taking out Pokemon such as Steelix and Tangrowth effectively.</p> <p>The EV spread allows Druddigon to maintain bulk and high Attack, with 20 Special Attack EVs ensuring that Flamethrower OHKOes 248 HP / 8 SpD Escavalier after Stealth Rock damage and the Speed investment allowing it to outpace minimum Speed Tangrowth, allowing it to effectively 2HKO it with Flamethrower. Alternatively, a spread of 152 HP / 252 Atk / 20 SpA / 84 Spe with a Brave nature can be used to similar effect, making Druddigon more generally bulky and allowing it to take on Pokemon such as Entei better as opposed to favoring Druddigon's ability to take specially oriented hits. While being relatively slow, Druddigon can still outpace Pokemon such as Poliwrath, Clefable, and Lanturn should it be deemed necessary, though doing so would encourage the use of a Lonely nature as opposed to a Brave one. Alternative move options include Crunch, which allows Druddigon to cleanly 2HKO Uxie and hit other such Psychic-types hard, and Thunder Punch, which allows it to hit Water-types such as Slowking and Poliwrath hard without locking into Outrage, both of which receive the boost provided by Sheer Force.</p> <p>Pokemon that appreciate the removal of dedicated physical walls such as Steelix and Tangrowth really appreciate the support of mixed Druddigon. Escavalier, Aerodactyl, and Kabutops all are reasonable examples of this, with the latter also providing Rapid Spin support to allow Druddigon to switch in more often. Paralysis support is nice if available, as it allows Druddigon to avoid relying on Sucker Punch or Substitute to leave an impact on offensively oriented teams. Lanturn, Ferroseed, and Slowking are all capable of slowing down the opposing team for Druddigon and provide good defensive synergy with it as well. Considering Druddigon is often presented with opportunities to switch in, a Rapid Spin user such as Kabutops or Cryogonal can be useful for reducing the rate at which Druddigon can be worn down from doing so.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Due to its plethora of useful resistances and respectable bulk, Druddigon makes for a very effective status platform and phazer. Glare offers a reasonably accurate paralysis move that affects nearly all of the tier, making it easy for Druddigon to cripple opposing Pokemon. Dragon Tail offers Druddigon a moderately powerful STAB move that doubles as a phazing move, allowing it to spread around paralysis and residual damage from entry hazards effectively. Druddigon, finding quite a few opportunities to set up Stealth Rock, makes for a very versatile user of the move. Earthquake allows Druddigon to hit Steel-types that resist Dragon Tail hard, preventing Pokemon such as Klinklang from setting up on it. Having access to a neutral priority attack is also useful, as Druddigon is capable of outpacing most of the unboosted tier should they be paralyzed, and can thusly KO Pokemon before they can attack back. On the other hand, considering how easily Druddigon is worn down, RestTalk can be used to effectively prolong its life.</p> <p>Druddigon's EV spread seeks to maximize special bulk in order to capitalize on its specially based resistances. However, an alternative spread of 252 HP / 124 Def / 132 SpD can be used to better take on certain Pokemon like Choice Band Entei, which this spread is able to consistently survive two Choice Band Flare Blitzes from, though deviating heavily from investment in Special Defense hurts Druddigon's ability to check Pokemon such as Sceptile. Fire Punch can be used over Earthquake for the ability to hit Ferroseed, Durant, and Escavalier hard, while also hitting Grass-types at neutral priority. Roar is an interesting option for helping Druddigon phaze around Substitute users more efficiently and can also be used alongside Dragon Claw instead of Dragon Tail and a coverage move to allow for a neutral priority STAB move to work with. Sucker Punch is available, and priority is never a bad thing to have, though without investment in Attack it is somewhat weak, which should be taken into account. Substitute is a feasible option for Druddigon that can ensure it can safely paralyze Pokemon in most situations where it might otherwise be threatened out, such as match-ups with hard-hitting Ice-types, while also making it less vulnerable to Trick.</p> <p>The most effective partners to this set are slow heavy hitters that can take advantage of the widespread paralysis support Druddigon provides. Examples of this include Aggron, Escavalier, and Bouffalant. As Druddigon spends about half its time phazing Pokemon around, entry hazard support is appreciated for capitalizing on this. Ferroseed and Qwilfish both are strong Spikes users and defensive partners for Druddigon. Wish and Heal Bell support are both appreciated, as Druddigon is quite vulnerable to being worn down over time, a trait exemplified by its occasional resorting to RestTalk. Clefable and Flareon are both respectable examples of users of these moves. As with most of Druddigon's sets, it appreciates Rapid Spin support from Pokemon such as Cryogonal.</p> "

Bouffalant has access to Reckless, which makes its Head Charge hit 20% harder; however, losing out on Sap Sipper is very unfortunate. Wild Charge can be used with Reckless to hit Kabutops and Omastar harder, but note that Earthquake does enough to them and a neutral Head Charge is as powerful as a super effective Wild Charge. Anywhere Stone Edge is listed, Rock Slide can be used for a more accurate option, but the power drop is very noticeable, and even a super effective hit is hitting weaker than a neutral Head Charge. Bouffalant has other physical moves like Outrage and Iron Head, but they don't provide good coverage.</p> <p>A Choice Scarf set can surprise a faster foe and land a KO on them, but Bouffalant doesn't have a good STAB for revenge killing or cleaning. Also, even with a Choice Scarf, the one Grass-type in the tier that actually can fight back, Sceptile, will still outspeed it and hit it with a Focus Blast to do a considerable amount of damage. Bouffalant can use Toxic to wear down walls, but Bouffalant has the power to 2HKO almost any wall in the tier, and the ones that it can't are generally immune to Toxic. Finally, Bouffalant has Rain Dance and Sunny Day, but it is generally outclassed at setting them up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>While Bouffalant hits brutally hard, especially when backed up by a Sap Sipper boost, there are things that severely limit it. The best counters are Levitating Ghost-types such as Rotom, Misdreavus, and Haunter, as they are immune to Head Charge and Earthquake while taking minimal damage from Megahorn. The former two can use Will-O-Wisp, which completely cripples Bouffalant, and Haunter can use Disable to prevent itself from being hit by Stone Edge, the only move that does much damage to it. Steelix can also stop Bouffalant, as even an Earthquake isn't doing much thanks to its superb physical defenses. However, it will not enjoy taking an Earthquake if Bouffalant has acquired a lot of boosts, namely from the combination of Swords Dance and Sap Sipper. Ferroseed generally walls Bouffalant, and can deal enough damage with Gyro Ball to break Bouffalant's Substitutes. Escavalier does not enjoy taking +1 Earthquakes or Stone Edges, but it otherwise is bulky enough to avoid 2HKOs from Head Charge as long as Bouffalant is only at +1, and can dent Bouffalant with a Choice Band-boosted Megahorn. If nothing on your team can switch into Bouffalant safely, then revenge killing it is the way to go. As long as Bouffalant doesn't have a Substitute up, powerful Fighting-types such as Medicham and Hitmonlee can OHKO Bouffalant. Poliwrath in particular can avoid 2HKOs from unboosted variants and phaze it out with Circle Throw.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Because Bouffalant forces a lot of switches, it has many opportunities to set up a Substitute. Ideally, the goal is to switch into an expected Sleep Powder or another Grass-type move to get an Attack boost and then proceed to set up a Substitute as the opponent switches out. Another way to set up a Substitute is to scare away a wall and set one up as it switches out. Behind a Substitute, Bouffalant is very hard to revenge kill, as then it can take a hit from a Pokemon such as Hitmonlee or and Medicham and OHKO them back with ease. While Return is the weaker of the STAB moves, it doesn't deal any recoil damage; it can be used in order to set up more Substitutes, therefore making it the preferred option. However, Head Charge is quite a bit more powerful and while it does cause recoil, it is worth considering if you don't need Bouffalant to last throughout the match. Bouffalant's STAB is resisted by Rock-types and Steel-types, but Earthquake hits these two super effectively. Stone Edge destroys most Flying-types, such as Aerodactyl and Archeops, and is Bouffalant's best option against Rotom and other Levitating Ghost-types, which are immune to its STAB and Earthquake. If Stone Edge is not needed, Swords Dance is also a useful tool, as Bouffalant can set up a Swords Dance against a slower opponent like Steelix and hit even harder.</p> <p>The EV spread maximizes Bouffalant's Attack and also outspeeds minimum Speed Lanturn. Notably, Bouffalant has enough bulk to take an uninvested Scald from Lanturn so that its Substitute will remain intact. An alternative spread is to invest 216 Speed EVs to outspeed all variants of Aggron without a Speed boosting nature. Maximum Speed outspeeds uninvested Qwilfish, but most Qwilfish invest in their Speed to outpace Adamant Bouffalant. Megahorn is an interesting option for this set, as after a Sap Sipper boost, it is capable of OHKOing Slowking and also 2HKOing Tangrowth, but note that major targets of Megahorn are usually Grass-types, which are already helpless against Bouffalant.</p> <p>Bouffalant is weak to Fighting-type attacks, and there are a number of users of these moves that reside in RU. Some Fighting-types like Hariyama can take a hit from Bouffalant, destroy its Substitute, and then proceed to OHKO, and others like Gallade can just flat out OHKO it. Due to this, Psychic-types such as Uxie and Slowking are good partners as they have an easy time against Fighting-types and can hit them back with their Psychic-type STAB moves. Bouffalant will have difficulties against Ghost-types, which are immune to its STAB; due to this, Dark-type support from Spiritomb or Absol, which can hit hard with their STAB or hit Rotom or Misdreavus as they flee with Pursuit, is very useful. Note that if Bouffalant has Swords Dance, any Ghost-type that doesn't have an immunity to Ground will likely lose against Bouffalant. Finally, because Bouffalant is notable for its ability to force out or defeat almost every Grass-type in the tier, Pokemon like Omastar make good partners as they have a much easier time setting up for a sweep once their biggest obstacle is gone.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Is Bouffalant not hitting hard enough for you? A Choice Band is an excellent fit for a Pokemon like Bouffalant, which can be a devastating physical attacker, especially if it gets a boost from Sap Sipper. As this set doesn't hold back, Head Charge is by far the superior choice and will demolish almost every Pokemon in RU. For example, 248/0 Escavalier gets 2HKOed by Head Charge with a Sap Sipper boost, despite having a decent bulk and resisting the move! Even without any Sap Sipper boosts, bulky Pokemon such as Poliwrath will get 2HKOed even with maximum investment.</p> <p>The other moves are for coverage, as Head Charge doesn't always get the job done. Stone Edge gets past Pokemon like Sigilyph and Aerodactyl, easily OHKOing both of them. Once again, it is the best way for Bouffalant to deal with the likes of Rotom and other levitating Ghost-types. Megahorn is for denting Pokemon such as Slowking, Uxie, and Tangrowth, which are bulky enough to take a Head Charge. The final slot is to take care of Steel-types. Earthquake is the more consistent option, dealing a good amount of damage to Steel-types like Steelix. However, Ferroseed takes neutral damage from Earthquake, but a Superpower will OHKO Ferroseed if Bouffalant gets a Sap Sipper boost. Unfortunately, this will often result in Bouffalant switching out, which makes Earthquake preferred in most cases.</p> <p>The given EV spread allows it Bouffalant to outspeed minimum Speed Lanturn, so it won't be able to burn Bouffalant with Scald or paralyze it. 216 Speed EVs allow Bouffalant to outspeed all Aggron that do not have a boosting item or nature, which can allow Bouffalant to heavily damage it with an Earthquake before it can retaliate. Bouffalant has access to Pursuit, which can nail Rotom and Cryogonal if they try to flee from a different move. Return is a usable option over Head Charge if the recoil is not desired, but it is not suggested as Bouffalant wants to hit as hard as possible and the recoil is more often than not worth the increase in power.</p> <p>Although Bouffalant is capable of hitting several types of Pokemon hard, what it truly wants to do is eliminate the need to predict and use Head Charge without worrying about resists or immunities. This is also important to keep any boosts that have been accumulated through Sap Sipper. Ghost-types are easily worked around by using Dark-types such as Spiritomb and Absol, as their STAB Pursuits will trap them easily. Magneton is able to trap some of the Steel-types in RU, but there is little to no chance of it defeating Steelix, which unfortunately happens to be the most physically bulky Steel-type in the game. Water-types such as Omastar and Poliwrath are useful as they can get past Steelix with their STAB moves, and in return, Bouffalant can deal with the Grass-types that hinder them.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<p>Bouffalant is an awesome switch into a huge majority of the Grass-types in the tier thanks to Sap Sipper giving it an Attack boost on any Grass-type move, including Spore and Leech Seed. Ideally, Bouffalant should get in on something with low offenses like defensive Amoonguss, boost up with Swords Dance as the opponent is forced to switch out, and annihilate whatever is bold enough to switch in on the next turn. The reason this set works the way it does is due in large part to the fact that Bouffalant is nigh-impossible to OHKO without a STAB Fighting-type move. This means that whatever switches in isn't going to be able to OHKO Bouffalant and faces a +2 or +3 attack in return.</p> <p>Return is chosen as the STAB move of choice due to its lack of recoil, which would otherwise be non-conducive to the tank strategy this set relies on, and the fact that at +2, Return gets almost all the same KOs that Head Charge would. Stone Edge and Earthquake give the best possible coverage with Return. The EdgeQuake combo reliably hits all of the Ghost-types in the tier, including Rotom, which will most likely to switch in on Bouffalant. Finally, Substitute can be used to block status and is Bouffalant's best weapon against Alomomola, which can then no longer fish for a burn with Scald or poison with Toxic while Bouffalant can boost up to +6. However, opting for Substitute leaves Bouffalant totally exposed to Rotom and Misdreavus, necessitating Pursuit support.</p> <p>The EV spread is designed to give Bouffalant as much bulk as possible and enough Speed to outpace minimum Speed Lanturn. 216 Speed EVs can be used to outrun Adamant Aggron and nail it with Earthquake, but this lowers Bouffalant's damage output or bulk slightly depending on whether the EVs were taken from; if taken from HP, Bouffalant is exposed to a guaranteed OHKO from Hitmonchan's Drain Punch, a near guaranteed OHKO from Choice Specs Sceptile's Focus Blast, and a much higher chance to be 2HKOed by Life Orb Rotom's Thunderbolt. However, most of these attacks are guaranteed on the 248 HP EV spread with Stealth Rock anyway, so running that much Speed may be worth it depending on how you want to use Bouffalant.</p> <p>Megahorn can be used to hit Slowking and Grass-types such as Rotom-C and Tangrowth slightly harder, but it leaves Bouffalant significantly more open to Ghost-types, Rotom in particular. Lum Berry can be used over Leftovers to absorb status from the likes of Rotom, Uxie, and Slowking and continue Bouffalant's rampage. Chople Berry is another cool alternative option for tanking Focus Blast from Tangrowth and Sceptile, or a probable Fighting-type revenge killer switch-in. Running either Berry allows Bouffalant to bluff a Choice item as well, possibly luring in Pokemon thinking Bouffalant will get locked into a move, only to be met with a +2 monster and no way to OHKO it or safely switch any Pokemon into it.</p> <p>Bouffalant works as a tank-meets-wallbreaker, opening up holes for a Pokemon like Druddigon to clean up later or vice versa. OTR Slowking is a cool partner for Bouffalant in particular, as it can set up Trick Room and open up holes in the opponent's team or let Bouffalant to come in with Trick Room up and sweep itself. Bouffalant's Speed should be dropped to as low as possible if you want to center around a Trick Room sweep with it. Bouffalant can fill the role of sleep absorber for the team thanks to its immunity to Spore and Sleep Powder, and it makes an excellent counter to Lilligant, Amoonguss, and Rotom-C, as well as a great check to Sceptile. Choice Specs Slowking and other offensive Water-types like Feraligatr and Samurott also make great teammates due to Bouffalant's great ability to take on Grass-types, and Slowking in particular makes a good teammate as it can take on Emboar and other Fighting-types.</p> <p>Stealth Rock setters are naturally good partners for Bouffalant as well, particularly Rhydon and Golurk. Pursuit support is also great for Bouffalant, because it can take out Ghost-types without having to rely on Stone Edge or Earthquake. Absol, Spiritomb, and Druddigon are great choices for this role. Without Substitute, a Pokemon that can take on Alomomola is needed for this set to be successful, as it's otherwise a complete stop. Grass- and Electric-types are immediately good teammates for this reason. Roselia is cool in particular thanks to the Spikes it provides, and Eelektross's slow Volt Switch can be nice to get Bouffalant in safely as well. The only Pokemon that can normally OHKO Bouffalant are Fighting-types, of which almost none can switch into Bouffalant safely, forcing them to come in as revenge killers. This allows Bouffalant to pick and choose its victims and forces the opponent to play predictably. Having this kind of offensive pressure can be the exact answer a balanced team needs to get their win condition in later in the match with a few chosen Pokemon eliminated.</p> "

  "Braviary": {
    "overview": "<p>Sleek, lithe, and powerful, Braviary is the epitome of physical attacking. Sporting a base 123 Attack stat and high Base Power moves, Braviary's damage output is greater than almost any other Pokemon in the tier. When further augmented with boosting items such as Life Orb and the Choice items, it appears that almost nothing would be able to stop Braviary. With a Choice Scarf, Braviary becomes a devastating revenge killer, being able to outspeed and take down all but the fastest sweepers. With a Choice Band equipped, Braviary reveals his true self--the power boost turning him into a complete powerhouse--allowing him to crush most walls and turn frail sweepers into dust, scattered away by the beating of Braviary's mighty wings. Despite Braviary's overawing Attack stat and power, his Speed is lackluster, leaving him outsped by a whole host of RU threats who can hit him first. However, Braviary has decent overall bulk, especially for a sweeper, to offset this fact. Braviary, like most birds, also has access to Roost which provides reliable recovery, restoring health lost from residual damage such as Life Orb, Stealth Rock, and Brave Bird recoil. With his variety of sets and raw attacking power, Braviary should be considered by every team builder, both on their own team and on the opposing side.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Although Braviary's movepool isn't tiny, most of Braviary's other options are outclassed by his main attacks. Braviary can use Bulk Up along with his already decent bulk to become a deadly tank. However, common revenge killers such as Rotom-C and Galvantula can hit Braviary super effectively and put him out of commission. Braviary can also use Rock Slide in tandem with his alternative ability, Sheer Force. Although Rock Slide doesn't give Braviary any extra coverage, it lets Braviary hit Pokemon such as Moltres and Aerodactyl harder than any of his other moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Due to Braviary's astounding mix of power and perfect coverage, there are almost no Pokemon that can successfully wall him. Anything that is hit neutrally by Brave Bird is 2HKOed at worst, leaving only the sturdiest Steel- and Rock-types to face Braviary. Steelix, the tier's strongest physical wall, has a chance to be 2HKOed by Choice Band Superpower after Stealth Rock, as does the standard Eviolite Rhydon set. The only Pokemon in the tier that can guarantee its own survival after any two of Braviary's attacks and Stealth Rock damage is Metang; however, it cannot do much back to Braviary itself, and is easily set up on by a wide variety of Pokemon. Aside from these Steel- and Rock-types, everything else is comfortably 2HKOed by Braviary. However, while Braviary has a huge Attack stat and powerful moves, he can still be easily outsped by most sweepers. His base 80 Speed leaves him beaten by Pokemon such as Electivire, Magmortar, and Sceptile which can defeat a weakened Braviary if they can enter the field safely. Choice Scarf holders, such as Manectric, Galvantula, and Rotom-C, can outspeed even Choice Scarf Braviary and zap him with their STAB Electric-type attacks. Anything that can take a hit from Braviary and cripple him in return is a decent check; Misdreavus, Spiritomb, and Rotom can all take at least one of Braviary's attacks and cripple him with Will-O-Wisp, while Lanturn can paralyze Braviary with Thunder Wave. Keep in mind though, that all of the above can be 2HKOed upon switching in and will be heavily damaged even after just one attack. Priority attacks such as Kabutops's Aqua Jet and Absol's Sucker Punch can finish off a weakened Braviary. However, Sucker Punch users can be taken advantage of if Braviary runs Roost or Substitute.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>A Choice Scarf patches up Braviary's Speed, turning him into a powerful revenge killer and late-game sweeper. Unlike other Choice Scarf holders, Braviary is still extremely powerful without a boosting item thanks to his excellent Attack stat and high Base Power moves. Brave Bird is Braviary's staple attack; its 120 Base Power and 100% accuracy means that it is a reliable, high-powered move, annihilating most of the metagame. Superpower crushes common Flying-type counters such as Klinklang and Kabutops, 2HKOing both. However, bulky walls such as Steelix and Rhydon can take two Superpowers and retaliate with Gyro Ball and Stone Edge, respectively. Return is a secondary STAB move that has less power, but no recoil or stat drops. If Braviary needs to avoid recoil, then Return is the best option; it also hits Electric-types, such as Electivire, harder than any of Braviary's other moves. Lastly, U-turn, a common move on Choice Scarf holders, is used to scout Braviary's counters and gain momentum for your team. However, if Stealth Rock is on the field, then using U-turn repeatedly is not a good idea.</p> <p>252 EVs in Speed ensures Braviary can outspeed dangerous sweepers and Speed tie with other Choice Scarf-wielding base 80 Pokemon such as Gallade and Medicham. 252 Attack EVs gives Braviary as much power as possible. The choice between an Adamant and Jolly nature depends on whether you want to attempt a late-game sweep with Braviary or ensure he can revenge kill as many threats as possible. A Jolly nature lets Braviary outspeed Modest Gorebyss and Omastar after a Shell Smash, while an Adamant nature secures OHKOs on Typhlosion and Klinklang among others after Stealth Rock. Defiant is Braviary's most useful ability and turns Intimidate from opponents into an Attack boost. As Braviary will be switching a lot with U-turn and being Choice-locked, Stealth Rock will quickly take its toll. A Rapid Spin user, such as Cryogonal or Kabutops, can remove Stealth Rock from the field. Although Choice Scarf Braviary is a great revenge killer, he is also an excellent late-game sweeper, being able to clean up weakened teams with Brave Bird. However, Steelix and Rhydon can stop Braviary in its tracks, so a Pokemon that can take down Rock- and Steel-types, such as Slowking, is a good teammate.</p> "

        "description": "<p>The power of Choice Band Braviary sends shivers down the spines of his enemies. Walls crumble against his perfect neutral coverage while frailer teams will be broken by Brave Bird alone. Brave Bird is so powerful that Braviary can 2HKO offensive Kabutops and even defensive Lanturn. Superpower crushes the bulky Rock- and Steel-types that resist Brave Bird such as Steelix and Rhydon. Return takes advantage of Braviary's other STAB; it is not as powerful as Brave Bird but does not have recoil. Unfortunately, it provides little coverage alongside Brave Bird and is completely walled by Ghost-types who are immune to it. However, the lack of recoil and any other drawbacks mean that it is a good move to use when Braviary is on low health and doesn't want to sacrifice his own HP. Lastly, U-turn lets Braviary scout your opponent as they flee from his immense power. It also lets Braviary gain momentum for your team while dealing sizable damage to most opponents despite its relatively low Base Power. If your prediction skills are spot on, then Braviary is probably the strongest wallbreaker in the tier, removing any physical wall for your teammates to sweep.</p> <p>A standard offensive EV spread of 252 Attack and 252 Speed is used to give Braviary as much power and speed as possible. The remaining 4 EVs are placed in Defense instead of HP to ensure that Braviary takes less damage from Stealth Rock. However, an alternative EV spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 164 Spe along with a Jolly nature ensures that Braviary can still outspeed Adamant Kabutops and Gallade. This EV spread also gives Braviary more bulk, especially, in HP which helps to minimize Brave Bird recoil's impact on Braviary. However, the lesser Speed investment means that Braviary will be unable to outspeed dangerous threats such as Jolly Gallade, Timid Mesprit, and Timid Entei. Out of all of Braviary's abilities, Defiant is the only one that merits usage. Defiant makes Intimidate an Attack boost, rather than a drop, and any stray stat drops such as a Special Defense drop from Psychic will boost Braviary's Attack by two stages.</p> <p>As Braviary can remove almost every physical wall in the tier, physical sweepers such as Klinklang and Sceptile are great teammates to clean up the opposing team afterwards. As Braviary is weak to Stealth Rock and will be switching often, a Rapid Spin user, such as Kabutops or Cryogonal, is also a good choice. On the other hand, entry hazards on the opponent's side of the field will help Braviary in wallbreaking. Support Pokemon, such as Crustle and Smeargle, can both set up Stealth Rock and Spikes.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Braviary's respectable bulk, access to reliable recovery, and Flying STAB make him a very effective user of Bulk Up. After a single boost, Braviary becomes very difficult to KO, being able to take all but strong special Ice- and Electric-type attacks fairly comfortably. Brave Bird provides Braviary with a powerful STAB move with good neutral coverage, allowing him to hit most Pokemon moderately hard. Roost provides Braviary with reliable recovery, allowing him to set up comfortably on strong special attackers, such as Sceptile and Accelgor, while preventing more defensively oriented Pokemon like Slowking, Lanturn, Clefable, and Uxie from whittling him down with repeated attacks. Substitute allows Braviary to set up on bulky Pokemon that rely on status, Seismic Toss, Clear Smog, and Dragon Tail to combat it, and prevents Volt Switch users from forcing it out. Thanks to these attributes, Braviary can easily stall out Stone Edges from bulky Rock-types, effectively eliminating their primary method of damaging him and allowing him to play around them.</p> <p>The given EV spread emphasizes special bulk in order to better set up on offensive Grass-types, such as Sceptile and Lilligant, and bulky Water-types, such as Slowking and Lanturn, whose Scalds fall short of breaking Braviary's Substitute, while also yielding 101 HP Substitutes. The Speed investment allows Braviary to outpace standard Qwilfish and, as such, the majority of RU defensive Pokemon. More Speed can be utilized to outpace moderately fast Pokemon such as Crawdaunt and Shell Smash Omastar, though detracting from Braviary's special bulk to such an extent does detract from his ability to set up on Pokemon such as Sceptile and defensive Slowking, making him more vulnerable to being 2HKOed and having his Substitute broken by Scald, respectively. While seemingly trivial, Bulk Up Braviary adores facing defensively oriented teams, finding numerous opportunities to set up on common defensive Pokemon. To illustrate this, here are some example calculations of common defensive Pokemon against Braviary:</p> <ul> <li>Calm 0 SpA Slowking Scald: 19.55 - 23.26% <li>Calm 0 SpA Roselia Sludge Bomb: 22.27 - 26.23%</li> <li>Bold 0 SpA Tangrowth Hidden Power Fire: 12.62 - 14.85%</li> <li>Calm 0 SpA Lanturn Volt Switch: 27.22 - 32.67%</li> <li>Impish 0 Atk Steelix Gyro Ball: 26.98 - 31.93%</li> </ul> <p>Pokemon that can take on boosting Steel- and Rock-types that can set up alongside Braviary, such as Klinklang, Kabutops, and Aggron, are useful partners. Steelix and Poliwrath are both useful for this reason, with the former also checking Rotom, one of Braviary's most resilient counters. Spikes support is very useful in wearing down Rock- and Steel-types that resist Braviary's STAB. Roselia and Ferroseed are both solid examples of this, who in addition to laying Spikes, also take on Electric-types that trouble Braviary. Rapid Spin support is much appreciated if at all possible, since with Stealth Rock off the field, Braviary can much more definitively check and set up on Pokemon such as Sceptile and Accelgor. Cryogonal and Kabutops both make solid partners for this purpose.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Although Braviary is normally seen with a Choice item equipped, he can also run an effective 3 attacks set. Without the restriction of being Choice-locked, Braviary can use Roost to heal off Brave Bird recoil and residual damage. Brave Bird is still Braviary's most powerful move and hits like a missile with a Life Orb boost. However, the recoil can quickly take its toll, as Braviary often does large amounts of damage to the opponent. This, combined with potential Life Orb recoil, means that Braviary will have to Roost often or risk being KOed. Superpower destroys Rock- and Steel-types hoping to switch in on Brave Bird; without a Choice item, Braviary doesn't need to rely as heavily on prediction and can destroy slower Pokemon that resist one of his moves, such as Kabutops and Klinklang, after they switch in. Return is a STAB attack with no side effects, but because it provides almost no extra coverage, Braviary can instead use Substitute or U-turn. The former eases prediction and acts as a buffer to status while the latter scouts Braviary's checks and gains momentum for your team.</p> <p>Although the standard EV spread with a Jolly nature is recommended, Braviary can choose to invest further in his decent bulk with an EV spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 164 Spe which still outspeeds Adamant Kabutops and Gallade while giving Braviary more bulk and just as much attacking power. 4 EVs are placed in Defense so Stealth Rock damage is rounded down. Life Orb is the main item as Braviary greatly appreciates the boost in power; however, Leftovers is still viable to help cushion Braviary from recoil. Leftovers is best used alongside Substitute as otherwise Braviary will lose health too fast and be forced to Roost much more often. Defiant is useful against Pokemon such as Qwilfish and Stoutland which rely on Intimidate to take hits. Roost can be removed so Braviary has four attacks but, with the lack of recovery, Braviary is better off with a Choice item.</p> <p>As the damage from Stealth Rock, Life Orb, and Brave Bird recoil adds up quickly, support from Braviary's teammates is necessary to protect him from residual damage he can avoid. A Rapid Spin user, such as Kabutops, Cryogonal, or Hitmonchan can remove Stealth Rock from your side of the field. Each of the above also has some sort of defensive synergy with Braviary. Steelix and Rhydon are troublesome as both can avoid being 2HKOed by Superpower and can defeat Braviary with Gyro Ball and Rock Blast respectively, especially after the Defense drops associated with using Superpower. Pokemon that can deal with Rhydon and Steelix, such as Torterra and Tangrowth, are thus good teammates. Even though Braviary has Roost, a teammate with Wish is appreciated, as Braviary often loses health too fast for Roost to keep up with. Alomomola and Clefable both have access to Wish and high HP stats, making them ideal for this.</p> "

Electric-types, such as Magneton, Rotom, and Manectric, resist Brave Bird and can hit very hard with a STAB Electric-type move. Mandibuzz also becomes vulnerable to Fighting-type attacks when using Roost; slower Fighting-types such as Hariyama or Poliwrath can take advantage of this and KO Mandibuzz with some prediction.

Taunt is a great move that prevents Slowking and Accelgor from setting up Nasty Plot and Spikes, respectively. It is also an answer to opposing stall teams, as Mandibuzz's base 80 Speed lets her outrun most walls in RU and prevent them from healing or spreading status. While the opponent is prohibited from healing, Mandibuzz can heal herself with Roost, which is especially helpful to mitigate Stealth Rock damage. In addition, Roost removes her Flying typing, allowing the vulture to take Rock-, Ice-, and Electric-type attacks more easily. Be careful, though, as this makes her more susceptible to Ground-, Bug-, and Fighting-type attacks. All in all, Taunt, Roost, and her two immunities--namely to Ground- and Psychic-type attacks--make Mandibuzz hard to take down.</p> <p>Despite the emphasis on her Special Defense, Mandibuzz is also able to take on physical attackers due to her high base Defense. This is especially useful as Whirlwind can force out set-up Feraligatr, Crawdaunt, Scyther, and Drapion, as well as special sweepers such as Omastar and Sigilyph, but note that Mandibuzz will take a lot of damage in the process. Brave Bird or Foul Play are the preferred moves in the last slot, as Mandibuzz will otherwise become useless if Taunted. Brave Bird hits surprisingly hard even off Mandibuzz's base 65 Attack, OHKOing Sceptile and Lilligant after Stealth Rock damage. Brave Bird also lets Mandibuzz damage Pokemon that can heal or are immune to Toxic, such as Roselia, Clefable, Poliwrath, and Qwilfish. As Taunt will prevent these Pokemon from healing, Brave Bird will eventually wear them down, allowing Mandibuzz to beat them one-on-one. Foul Play is useful for hitting physical attackers, such as Kabutops, Druddigon, and Entei, harder than Brave Bird. Alternatively, Toxic can be used to cripple walls such as opposing Mandibuzz, Slowking, and Cryogonal.</p> <p>248 HP EVs are used to minimize Stealth Rock damage and possibly give Mandibuzz one more switch-in, while 252 Special Defense EVs make the vulture as bulky as possible on the special side. The remaining EVs are put into Defense to help buffer hits against Feraligatr, Scyther, Drapion, and other physical threats. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD can be used to let Mandibuzz play the role of a physical wall, countering Drapion, Crawdaunt, Scyther, Golurk, and Fighting-types.</p> <p>As far as teammates go, a spinner is appreciated as Mandibuzz's Stealth Rock weakness hinders her ability to switch in multiple times. Cryogonal is an especially good partner; the two cover almost every special attacker in the tier bar Moltres. Cleric support from Pokemon such as Uxie and Roselia is also welcome, as Mandibuzz's ability to wall after becoming poisoned or burned is greatly hindered. Pokemon which can set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes are helpful, because Whirlwind enables Mandibuzz to force switches that rack up entry hazard damage on the opponent. Other useful partners include Fighting- and Water-types, such as Hitmonchan and Feraligatr, respectively, as Mandibuzz removes Spiritomb for Fighting-types and gets rid of the Grass-types that trouble her Water-type teammates.</p> "

  "Durant": {
    "overview": "<p>Durant is among the tier's premier offensive threats largely in part due to its high Speed and Attack that is bolstered even further by its ability, Hustle. It can perform a whole variety of roles that can accomplish much in a match, from a wallbreaker to a sweeper to a reliable revenge killer. Its good Bug / Steel typing and decent physical bulk can grant it some chances to freely come in and also makes it hard to take down with priority when attempting a sweep. Unfortunately, while Hustle grants Durant an amazing power boost, it comes at the cost of the accuracy of its moves, which can be a letdown at times. Durant also has terrible special bulk and HP that will make it hard to setup or switch in at times as well as make it easy to revenge kill with many of the common Choice Scarf users. All in all though, Durant is one of tier's best Pokemon and is a threat that should be considered for a spot on your team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Durant's small movepool leaves it strapped for many other options. Durant can try a full Baton Pass set, with some boosting moves such as Agility and Hone Claws, but more often than not, this is a waste of Durant's potential. Durant has access to the move Entrainment, which passes off its ability to another Pokemon. With arguably the worst ability in Truant, it can pass off the horrible ability to the opposing Pokemon, making it into an awful Pokemon. However, this gimmicky strategy only will work with a Shadow Tag Pokemon such as Gothorita, which will be able to trap the opposing Pokemon and set up Calm Minds, or else the Pokemon that has Truant will just switch out. That Pokemon also must not be able to do much to the Gothorita so that it eases setup. The strategy is relatively inconsistent, though, because there are plenty of Pokemon that can heavily dent Gothorita with physical moves and cause it to falter eventually.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Durant is not a very easy Pokemon to directly counter because of the brute power it possesses. In terms of answers, though, Choice Scarf Emboar is the best offensive check to Durant, being able to outspeed and easily OHKO Durant with Flare Blitz. If need be, it can switch into any of Durant's attacks, barring Superpower, and retaliate. Qwilfish can easily stomach any of Durant's attacks, barring a Choice Band or neutral attack Thunder Fang, and paralyze any Durant not packing Lum Berry, rendering Durant useless. Poliwrath can also tank any hit from Durant outside of Thunder Fang, which 2HKOes at +1 or with a Choice Band, and phaze Durant with Circle Throw or burn it with Scald. Alomomola can take repeated hits from Choice Band Durant outside of Thunder Fang, which can put Alomomola in a tough situation, but it fails to threaten Durant with its Waterfalls and can turn into setup bait for Durant. Steelix can take any of Durant's attacks other than a Choice Band-boosted or +1 Superpower and Roar away a boosted Durant.</p> <p>Often the easiest way to deal with Durant is to revenge kill it. Other than the previously mentioned Emboar, Choice Scarf Magneton can trap Durant with Magnet Pull, outspeed it, and OHKO Durant with a Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Fire. Rotom can take any one hit from Durant barring a +1 Life Orb X-Scissor and OHKO with Thunderbolt. Choice Scarf variants of Rotom easily outspeed Durant, while bulky variants can take any one hit and burn any Durant lacking a Lum Berry, crippling it for the rest of the match. Other common Choice Scarf users, such as Rotom-C and Manectric, can also KO Durant with their STAB moves. If Stealth Rock is not on the field, Moltres can take a Thunder Fang and OHKO with its Fire-type STAB. Naturally faster Pokemon, such as Tauros and Aerodactyl, can also revenge kill Durant with a Fire Blast. However, all of the previously mentioned checks, with the exception to Rotom and Manectric, can be outsped by the Choice Scarf set and OHKOed by the appropriate move.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<p>A Choice Band gives Durant the ability to hit hard right off the bat without too many consequences. X-Scissor is the primary STAB, heavily damaging the many Grass- and Psychic-types of the tier, such as Tangrowth, Slowking, and Uxie. Superpower smashes through the Steel-types that would otherwise wall this set, such as Steelix, Aggron, and Magneton. Thunder Fang hits Poliwrath, Qwilfish, and Alomomola, heavily denting them, as well as KOing Moltres after Stealth Rock. Iron Head rounds off this set by providing secondary STAB that allows Durant to hit bulky Ghost-types, such as Golurk and Misdreavus.</p> <p>Hustle is the ability of choice because it gives Durant a great power boost in its attacks that makes it the fearsome wallbreaker it is. As for other options, Baton Pass can work as a pseudo-U-turn in the fourth slot, but Durant wants all the coverage it can get. Rock Slide will always OHKO Moltres and Entei without the need for Stealth Rock and can also nab a kill on non-bulky Rotom after Stealth Rock, but those are the only circumstances that it would be useful in.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is appreciated for Durant, as it allows it to wallbreak even further with its attacks and turns some 3HKOes into 2HKOes. For example, with Stealth Rock on the field, Durant will consistently 2HKO Qwilfish switch-ins with Thunder Fang and OHKO Entei with Superpower, and with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, Durant will be able to 2HKO Alomomola with Thunder Fang. Druddigon and Rhydon both make for excellent candidates for Stealth Rock support, as both can take on the Fire-types that annoy Durant. For more offensive teams, suicide leads such as Smeargle and Crustle can set up entry hazards for Durant to do some work early-game. Mixed Druddigon can make for a decent partner considering that it can lure in Pokemon that discourage Durant from spamming its STAB moves, such as Steelix and Escavalier, and destroy them with a Flamethrower. Physical setup sweepers, such as Sceptile, Kabutops, and Gallade, can take advantage of Durant's ability to wear down physical walls and potentially sweep on their own. Gallade has the added benefit of destroying Steelix with its Fighting-type STAB while being able to scare out Poliwrath and Qwilfish with Psycho Cut, both of which are common switch-ins to Durant, which can possibly give it a chance to setup and do some major damage.</p> "

        "name": "Hone Claws",
        "description": "<p>While Durant is best used as a powerful wallbreaker, this set gives Durant a means to sweep, and when supported by a Hone Claws boost, makes it one of the tier's best sweepers. Hone Claws is Durant's only way of boosting its Attack, and it also mitigates the accuracy drop that Hustle brings. X-Scissor is the primary STAB here, nailing the many Grass- and Psychic-types of the tier, such as Lilligant, Uxie, and Mesprit. Superpower provides the necessary coverage to crush opposing Steel-types, such as Steelix, Escavalier, Ferroseed, and Magneton. Thunder Fang is the preferred move in the last slot, as it hits Poliwrath, Qwilfish, and Alomomola, 2HKOing them at +1 (or in Qwilfish's case, due to Intimidate neutralizing the Attack boost, +0) after Stealth Rock, as well as KOing Moltres after Stealth Rock. On the other hand, Iron Head provides a secondary STAB move which allows Durant to hit bulky Ghost-types, such as Golurk and Misdreavus, that would otherwise wall Durant.</p> <p>Hustle is the preferred ability because of the invaluable power boost that Durant is granted from the ability. Lum Berry is the preferred item, as it allows Durant to have a free pass on status, specifically burn and paralysis, while still having the same amount of power as the Choice Band set after a boost. Life Orb, however, is another alternative that allows Durant to hit hard without a Hone Claws boost and gives Durant the ability to power through even the bulkiest of walls without too many problems. Baton Pass can be somewhat useful on this set, as Durant can pass off Hone Claws boosts when put in an unfavorable situation, but this comes at the cost of coverage, and Durant will usually lose the chance to sweep if giving up its last slot to Baton Pass. Rock Slide will OHKO Moltres and Entei without the need of Stealth Rock after a boost and hits Rotom for major damage, but lacks utility otherwise. A combination of Substitute and a Salac Berry allows Durant to outspeed the common Choice Scarf users that would stop a potential sweep, but Durant loses valuable coverage if taking this route.</p> <p>While this set is extremely potent at sweeping, it will often get easily revenge killed by many common Choice Scarf users, especially Emboar and Rotom-C. Slowking, Druddigon, and Rhydon can all deal with the Fire-types that can revenge kill Durant. Druddigon has the added benefit of dealing the with the common Choice Scarf Electric-types, such as Rotom-C, Rotom, and Manectric. Entry hazard support is also great for Durant, as it can turn some 3HKOs into 2HKOs. For example, with Stealth Rock, Durant will consistently 2HKO Qwilfish with Thunder Fang at +0 and OHKO Entei with Superpower at +1, and with Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes, Durant has the ability to OHKO defensive Steelix 93.75% of the time with a Life Orb-boosted Superpower at +1. Druddigon and Rhydon can also provide Stealth Rock support for Durant. Qwilfish also makes for a great partner, being able to lay down layers of Spikes for Durant as well as take on the Fire-types that limit Durant's chances of sweeping.</p> "

        "description": "<p>While Durant is typically a Pokemon that punches holes with its wallbreaking power, a Choice Scarf set capitalizes on Durant's great base 109 Speed that allows it to outspeed many key threats, such as +1 Lilligant and +2 Omastar. X-Scissor is the main STAB move, hitting opposing Grass-types, such as Sceptile, Rotom-C, and Lilligant. Superpower smashes opposing Steel-types, such as Aggron and Magneton, that would otherwise wall Durant, as well as nabbing a KO on -1 Omastar. Stone Edge destroys Moltres and puts a heavy dent in Entei and Sigilyph. Iron Head rounds off the set by providing a secondary STAB move. However, Baton Pass is another alternative that allows Durant to lure in defensive Pokemon, such as Poliwrath and Qwilfish, and Baton Pass out to something that can threaten it.</p> <p>An Adamant nature is chosen specifically on this set because it provides Durant with a good power boost, and the only Pokemon that Durant loses out on are Choice Scarf Manectric and Choice Scarf Typhlosion. Even with an Adamant nature, Durant is still capable of outspeeding +1 Lilligant and +2 Omastar, which is good enough considering both are massive threats that can have their sweep cut short by Durant. Swarm is the ability of choice here, because as a revenge killer, Durant cannot afford to miss with Hustle.</p> <p>As this set lacks the great power of the other sets, it needs something to lure in its counters, such as Alomomola, Qwilfish, Poliwrath, and Steelix, and heavily damage them so that Durant has a better chance of possibly sweeping. Mixed Emboar and mixed Druddigon are great partners for this set, as they can lure in those previously mentioned counters and wreck them with the appropriate coverage move.</p> "
