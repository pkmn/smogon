Stealth Rock setters like Piloswine and Tinkatuff have great defensive synergy with Ivysaur and are valuable to help wear down the opposition with entry hazard chip damage, as well as, in Tinkatuff's case, helping spread status with Thunder Wave to enable the aforementioned offensive threats even further. Quaxwell is a great teammate, helping sponge attacks from Fire-types like Pignite and Raboot while offering hazard removal to help Ivysaur not get worn down as quickly. Ivysaur, despite its Poison-typing, has a hard time breaking past Koffing because of its combination of Will-O-Wisp and Sludge Bomb; partners like Drakloak and Hisuian Sliggoo are important to help keep Koffing in check. Girafarig and Piloswine are notable threats to Ivysaur, making teammates like Misdreavus, Quaxwell, and Tinkatuff even more valuable.</p>"

Toxic Spikes support from Glimmet, Ivysaur, and Koffing can also help break through Dunsparce and Quaxwell, though Wartortle still needs them chipped down considerably before attempting to set up and sweep. Thwackey is a great partner, as it provides Grassy Terrain to help Wartortle recover health, allowing it some more leeway while setting up. Servine is a notable Wartortle counter, threatening to OHKO it with Leaf Storm; Monferno and Raboot are great partners to sponge attacks from Servine while offering offensive support and safe entry points via U-turn.</p>"

Capable of running either physically or specially defensive sets, Clefairy is flexible in supporting its teammates, such as using Stealth Rock to allow partners like Gabite and Piloswine to focus more on their offensive capabilities. Magic Guard is a useful tool that allows Clefairy to avoid taking residual entry hazard chip damage while sponging status for its teammates without taking residual damage. While Clefairy does offer immense upside as a utility machine, it does compete for the role with Tinkatuff, a dominant figure in the tier. While Tinkatuff is generally better than Clefairy because of its Steel typing, it does not have access to recovery, which makes Clefairy a capable choice for teams that want their Knock Off and Thunder Wave user to stick around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clefairy has access to Calm Mind, which can be used with attacks like Draining Kiss and Flamethrower to hit a large swath of the metagame for nice damage after a few boosts. Healing Wish can allow powerful wallbreakers like Girafarig and Piloswine a second chance to break through the opposition. Trick can be used to disrupt foes as well, opting to steal Eviolite from the foe rather than using Knock Off to remove it or using an unfavorable item like a Choice Scarf to disrupt a switch-in such as Misdreavus or Tinkatuff.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Item Disruption</strong>: Clefairy can struggle to function as a wall once its Eviolite is removed, rendering it less effective against Knock Off users like Monferno, Servine, and Thwackey. Switcheroo and Trick users, such as Frogadier, Girafarig, and Misdreavus can also disrupt Clefairy by giving it an unsavory Choice item.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Koffing, because of its ability Neutralizing Gas removing the effect of Magic Guard, can threaten Clefairy out and use Toxic Spikes to disrupt. Alolan Grimer and Ivysaur can threaten big damage against Clefairy with their STAB attacks while also using Knock Off to remove Eviolite from whatever switches into them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Hisuian Sliggoo can use its powerful Steel-type STAB attacks to obliterate Clefairy, while Tinkatuff can wall non-Night Shade Clefairy with ease and disrupt it with Encore and Knock Off.

Encore can similarly disrupt the opponent, though it is prediction-reliant, as most things will be faster than Clefairy without being paralyzed. Night Shade can be used to provide consistent damage output, though it can't hit Dunsparce, Girafarig, and Vigoroth, giving them opportunities to set up in front of Clefairy. Magic Guard allows Clefairy to sponge status moves and other forms of residual damage for its teammates, such as Toxic from Dunsparce, Salt Cure from Naclstack, and Will-O-Wisp from Misdreavus, though it does still suffer the effects of paralysis and takes boosted damage from Hex while statused. A specially defensive EV spread with a Calm nature lets Clefairy focus on checking Pokemon like Drakloak, Frogadier, and Misdreavus, while a physically defensive EV spread with a Bold nature can let it check Monferno and Piloswine.</p> <p>A natural fit on balance and bulky offense teams, Clefairy can use its utility to free up a moveslot on teammates like Dunsparce, Gabite, Misdreavus, and Piloswine. Clefairy uses its bulk and general longevity to disrupt the opposition drastically, allowing offensive teammates, like Frogadier and Girafarig, to clean late-game after Eviolites are removed from walls such as Dunsparce, Misdreavus, and Tinkatuff. Teammates that appreciate the paralysis spread by Clefairy include Hex users like Drakloak and Misdreavus, which can use the boosted damage to break through special walls like opposing Clefairy and Tinkatuff. Frogadier is a notable partner for Clefairy, as it uses Spikes to create an entry hazard-stacking core that, with Misdreavus as a spinblocker, can rack up hazard chip damage. While Clefairy is fairly bulky and can use Moonlight to stick around for longer, it is generally frail once its Eviolite is removed and can struggle to wall the stronger setup sweepers and wallbreakers in the tier, such as Nasty Plot Girafarig, Contrary + Leaf Storm Servine, and Swords Dance Thwackey. To help with this, Hisuian Sliggoo can cover a lot of these threats because of its own bulk and Steel typing, and it can capitalize on Clefairy removing Eviolites on foes to maximize the damage output of its own strong STAB attacks like Draco Meteor and Flash Cannon. Koffing and Pawniard can also help sponge Knock Offs for Clefairy, with Koffing providing great offensive pressure with Toxic Spikes and Pawniard being a reliable wallbreaker. Fighting-types like Pignite can help Clefairy break through the bulkier Normal- and Steel-types that it can struggle against, like Dunsparce and Hisuian Sliggoo. Gabite can similarly help break through these Pokemon while also threatening Koffing and other Poison-types like Glimmet.</p>"

Entry hazard support from setters like Piloswine and Tinkatuff can help push foes into range of Girafarig's moves, such as consistently allowing it to 2HKO Piloswine and OHKO opposing Girafarig with the right attack. Piloswine is a notable teammate that performs well against Tinkatuff and Clefairy and can absorb Thunder Wave while providing additional entry hazard support. Girafarig can, in return, pivot into non-Thunder Wave Misdreavus.

Hyper Voice and Psychic hit nearly the entire tier for neutral damage. Thunderbolt is Girafarig's strongest move to hit Steel-types such as Tinkatuff and Pawniard, very easily becoming overwhelming with Knock Off and entry hazard support.

Tinkatuff is another exceptional teammate, as it compresses a user of Stealth Rock, Knock Off for opposing Steel-types, and Thunder Wave for nuisances to Girafarig like Vigoroth and Misdreavus into one teamslot. Dedicated Knock Off absorbers such as Thief Koffing and Pawniard are appreciated as ways to take advantage of an otherwise very hard to punish move. Lastly, Mareanie is worth a mention, as despite its passivity, it has a very comfortable time checking revenge killers like Vigoroth, Pawniard, and Raboot and can soft check Hisuian Sliggoo, which all are sizable offensive threats when they come in on Girafarig.</p>"

Quaxwell is a valuable teammate to keep hazards removed, preventing Glare Dunsparce from getting worn down while it spreads paralysis. Gabite and Koffing offer valuable switch-ins against Fighting-type foes like Monferno and Pignite, with the latter absorbing Toxic Spikes as well, which keeps Dunsparce healthy for a late-game sweep potentially.

As a hazard setter, being unsusceptible to Taunt owing to its ability is a major plus point. While Eviolite provides bulk and flexibility, Choice Band enables Piloswine to capitalize on its unresisted STAB combination to dismantle opposing teams. However, despite its strength and bulk, it lacks longevity due to the absence of non-Rest recovery moves and faces competition from other Stealth Rock setters like Tinkatuff and Dunsparce, which have relatively better longevity, better matchup against the tier's premier hazard removal option in Quaxwell, and greater overall utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trailblaze over Ice Shard or Stealth Rock with more Speed EVs is an option for Piloswine. For instance, it outspeeds Frogadier at +2 with 104 Speed EVs. Trailblaze transforms Piloswine into a good late-game cleaner, potentially bypassing checks like Thwackey at low HP and finishing off foes like Misdreavus. This alternative also helps it in winning mirror matchups. However, if you drop Stealth Rock, it's advisable to run another setter like Tinkatuff, or if you drop Ice Shard, consider other revenge killers like Thwackey and Choice Scarf Frogadier. Similarly, Curse is an option over Stealth Rock, making Piloswine a dangerous late-game cleaner and enabling it to beat its former checks such as Thwackey and Raboot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Quaxwell can switch into any move from Piloswine and use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock. It can do so multiple times thanks to Roost and threatens Piloswine out with its STAB moves. Other Water-types like Wartortle and Frogadier can check Piloswine with their STAB attacks too. Wartortle also has Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock and is bulky enough to switch into Piloswine once or twice; Frogadier is relatively frailer but stronger.</p> <p><strong>Misdreavus</strong>: Misdreavus is immune to Piloswine's Ground-type moves, can take its Ice-type moves thanks to its bulk, and has Pain Split for longevity. Will-O-Wisp renders Piloswine ineffective.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers and Revenge Killers</strong>: Thwackey can check Piloswine, but it usually needs support to get Piloswine weakened to Grassy Glide range, generally with Knock Off, strong super effective moves, or pivoting moves, as it would rather not risk Wood Hammer.

As a wallbreaker, its unresisted STAB combination is extremely threatening to unprepared teams and those that have been weakened by Knock Off, hazards, or other residual damage. High Horsepower allows Piloswine to work effectively even in Grassy Terrain, but Earthquake is also a viable alternative due to its extra power and accuracy. Ice Shard allows Piloswine to pick off weakened threats like Girafarig and Fraxure.</p> <p>Piloswine is a strong fit for most archetypes, and it's especially effective on bulky offense and balance teams. Misdreavus is a stellar teammate for Piloswine; its spinblocking ability, which allows it to handle Quaxwell, complements Piloswine's Stealth Rock setting perfectly. In addition, Misdreavus can spread status to support Piloswine's wallbreaking or work in tandem with it to dismantle the opposing team through setup and cleaning. Frogadier is also a superb partner, forming an entry hazard-stacking core with Piloswine; moreover, it provides pivoting support to Piloswine, creating valuable entry opportunities. In a similar vein, Koffing sets Toxic Spikes to maximize hazard pressure; it also acts as a great switch-in to many foes that Piloswine is weak to, handling Grass-types like Thwackey and Servine and absorbing Fighting-type moves from threats like Raboot, Monferno, and Pignite. In general, wallbreakers and cleaners appreciate Piloswine's Stealth Rock support and offensive pressure; Thwackey, Girafarig, Fraxure, and Raboot synergize extremely well with Piloswine, working hand in hand with it to dismantle defensive cores, which may include Pokemon like Dunsparce, Ivysaur, Quaxwell, and Koffing. Thwackey, in particular, is an excellent teammate for Piloswine, dealing with pesky Water-types that check Piloswine, namely Quaxwell, Wartortle, and Frogadier. Thwackey also offers invaluable Knock Off, pivoting, and passive recovery support, bolstering Piloswine's wallbreaking prowess and longevity. In return, Piloswine deals with foes that can prove to be problematic for Thwackey, such as Koffing, Vullaby, and Tinkatuff. Piloswine appreciates Knock Off support a ton; thus, Knock Off users such as Monferno, Pignite, and Vigoroth make amazing teammates, pairing nicely with Piloswine and amplifying its offensive pressure, even allowing it to reach thresholds like 2HKOing maximum Defense Quaxwell that has lost its Eviolite with minimum chip damage. Piloswine is vulnerable to Misdreavus, particularly Will-O-Wisp variants, so Normal-types such as Dunsparce as well as the aforementioned Vigoroth, Monferno, and Pignite are exemplary partners. Defensively, Quaxwell is a remarkable teammate, providing Rapid Spin support to ensure Piloswine's side of the field is free of hazards, thus maximizing hazard pressure on the opposing team. Quaxwell also acts as a switch-in to multiple Pokemon that Piloswine can struggle against, especially if it's chipped or if its Eviolite has been removed by Knock Off, such as Frogadier, Pignite, Monferno, and Raboot; in exchange, Piloswine can deal with foes that Quaxwell is weak to, like Drakloak, Fraxure, and Girafarig. Wartortle is also a good teammate in this regard, though it has less longevity, which is a fair trade for the added offensive pressure. Ivysaur defensively takes care of Grass- and Water-types like Thwackey and Quaxwell for Piloswine, while Piloswine takes care of threats like Girafarig and Tinkatuff.</p>"

It is best paired with entry hazard setters like Tinkatuff, Frogadier, and Koffing to relentlessly pressure foes like Quaxwell and wallbreak as effectively as possible. Tinkatuff and Koffing also act as Knock Off absorbers, aiding Piloswine in keeping its Choice Band, and they also check Grass-types like Thwackey, Ivysaur, and Servine. Tinkatuff can also try to steal Quaxwell's Eviolite with Pickpocket, invalidating it as a potential Piloswine answer. Monferno and Pignite provide Knock Off support and offensively pressure Misdreavus + Quaxwell structures Piloswine may face some difficulty against. Special stallbreakers and wallbreakers such as Misdreavus and Choice Specs Girafarig can work in tandem with Piloswine to absolutely dismantle opposing defensive cores with Pokemon like Quaxwell, Misdreavus, Ivysaur, Tinkatuff, and Dunsparce. Piloswine is vulnerable to Will-O-Wisp from Misdreavus, so Girafarig is an especially noteworthy partner, along with Pokemon like Dunsparce, Vigoroth, and previously mentioned Fire-types, all of which can absorb burns and check Misdreavus. Thwackey and Ivysaur check pesky Water-types that check Piloswine, namely Frogadier, Wartortle, and Quaxwell, while also providing Knock Off support and, in Thwackey's case, passive recovery. In return, Piloswine handles Tinkatuff and Vullaby for them. Piloswine likes taking as little chip damage as possible, so hazard control options such as Quaxwell, Wartortle, and Vullaby are appreciated. Fraxure can take advantage of the holes Piloswine blows into opposing teams to set up and sweep. Servine is also an excellent partner for similar reasons and aids Piloswine by checking Water-types and providing Glare support, potentially mitigating its issue of having mediocre Speed. Pikachu also checks Water-types and provides Volt Switch support to Piloswine, bringing it in on forced switches and enabling its wallbreaking.</p>"

Its Fire typing makes it a suitable wallbreaker due to it not being crippled by Will-O-Wisp from notable Pokemon like Misdreavus and Koffing. U-turn lets Monferno pivot out on its unfavorable matchups and bring its teammates into favorable matchups. Knock Off is especially potent in NFE due to Eviolite being the item on walls such as Gabite, Quaxwell, and Drakloak that could normally give Monferno and its teammates a hard time.</p> <p>Monferno fits best onto balance and offensive teams that appreciate a switch-in to common top mons, Misdreavus and Thwackey, a Knock Off user that invites in Quaxwell, or a pivot to help establish a pivot core. Monferno appreciates teammates such as Girafarig and Thwackey to threaten its main checks in Koffing, Mareanie, and Quaxwell. It also pairs well with teammates like Tinkatuff and Frogadier, which can set entry hazards and weaken foes. Tinkatuff is especially helpful by spreading paralysis to allow Monferno to outspeed and pivot out on potentially dangerous foes, such as Frogadier, Girafarig, and Drakloak. Monferno supports wallbreakers and sweepers like Fraxure and Piloswine by luring in bulky walls like Quaxwell and using Knock Off to weaken them, making it easier for teammates to break through them later. Additionally, it aids these teammates by being a good switch-in to Pokemon like Misdreavus and Thwackey. It serves as a solid partner to one of the top NFE Pokemon, Misdreavus, due to its ability to threaten Normal-types that Misdreavus would otherwise struggle to break through. Monferno benefits from teammates like Clefairy, Quaxwell, and Koffing, which can absorb the otherwise dangerous Water- and Ground-type attacks it could receive from foes, such as Piloswine, Gabite, and Quaxwell.</p>"

Once it has set up, Monferno becomes a potent late-game cleaner, using its powerful, mostly unresisted STAB moves to threaten the opposition. Focus Blast provides essential coverage, dealing with foes like Hisuian Sliggoo, Piloswine, and Quaxwell. Vacuum Wave can pick up KOs on damaged faster foes like Girafarig or Frogadier. Timid nature ensures that Monferno outspeeds and OHKOs foes like Thwackey and allows it to deal sufficient damage without the need for the extra power that Modest would provide.</p> <p>Monferno fits well on offensive teams thanks to its ability to clean up weakened foes late-game. It also excels on balance teams, where it supports physically offensive teammates like Vigoroth, Thwackey, and Piloswine by luring and removing physical walls such as Quaxwell and Koffing that would otherwise hinder their progress. Monferno pairs well with hazard setters like Tinkatuff, Frogadier, and Gabite, which can lay down Stealth Rock and Spikes to weaken the opponent, facilitating Monferno’s sweeps. A layer of Stealth Rock or Spikes enables Monferno, once boosted, to secure the OHKO range on bulkier foes such as defensive Tinkatuff with Fire Blast, or Coil Dunsparce and defensive Gabite with Focus Blast. Wallbreakers like Piloswine and Thwackey are essential teammates, as they clear out key defensive checks such as Mareanie and Quaxwell, respectively. Paralysis absorbers, such as Eelektrik and Piloswine, help mitigate Monferno’s vulnerability to paralysis, which could otherwise allow slower threats like Pignite or Piloswine to outspeed and threaten it. Thunder Wave spreaders are also valuable to provide additional speed control; teammates like Clefairy or Tinkatuff stop faster Pokemon, such as Murkrow or Frogadier, otherwise able to get the jump on Monferno. Grass-types like Servine or Thwackey are helpful dealing with the likes of Quaxwell or Gabite while resisting both Water- and Ground-type moves. Knock Off users like Vigoroth or Thwackey are valuable additions to the team, as they ease Monferno's need for setting up.</p>"

While Gabite can use its Ground typing to find setup opportunities against common foes like Koffing, Monferno, and Tinkatuff, it struggles with capitalizing on its boosts with the abundance of threats that can OHKO it, like Drakloak, Frogadier, and Piloswine. Teammates like Tinkatuff can help handle these threats by providing Knock Off support while sponging attacks from Drakloak and Frogadier. Quaxwell can also help handle them by providing slow pivots with Flip Turn, entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin, and it can take hits from Frogadier. Misdreavus makes an excellent partner too, as it can threaten Will-O-Wisp on Piloswine to limit the damage output of Ice Shard while acting as a spinblocker against opposing Quaxwell. Ivysaur, Monferno, and Pignite are fine teammates for Gabite as well, offering Knock Off support to help remove Eviolite from physical walls, like opposing Ivysaur and Vullaby, to make wallbreaking easier for Gabite.

On top of this, it has access to Bulk Up which can make it even more imposing. While Pignite is a robust option for teams, it isn't without flaws; though it can usually sponge an attack or two from opposing wallbreakers, it can struggle to hit at times because of how slow it is.

However, Choice item Frogadier can hinder all these Water-types with Switcheroo.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Thwackey's Grassy Glide is a nightmare for Frogadier. Other Grass-types like Ivysaur and Servine can also check it. These Grass-types, however, do fear switching into Frogadier's Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Frogadier fails to deal significant damage to Pokemon like Dunsparce, Vigoroth, Duosion, Clefairy, and Tinkatuff, but all of these can threaten it in return. However, it is worth noting that Tinkatuff fails to check Frogadier long-term.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Hisuian Sliggoo, Choice Specs Drakloak, and First Impression Fraxure can revenge kill Frogadier.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Spikes lets Frogadier heavily pressure the opposing team while also making it immune to Thunder Wave due to Protean. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Dragon-types like Thwackey, Ivysaur, Fraxure, and Drakloak and removes its Grass weakness, allowing it to always survive Eviolite Thwackey's Grassy Glide. U-turn allows it to escape problematic matchups, such as Quaxwell and Wartortle, and generate momentum by bringing its teammates in on advantageous matchups.</p> <p>Frogadier fits on offense and balance teams focused on setting entry hazards. Ghost-types are nearly mandatory teammates for Frogadier, providing spinblocking support to ensure Spikes stay up on the field in a metagame where Rapid Spin is the primary hazard removal method. Misdreavus is generally the go-to option thanks to its wide array of utility moves, but Drakloak is also a viable alternative due to its good typing, Speed tier, and movepool. Pawniard is also a decent partner for Frogadier, punishing Defog attempts from Vullaby with Defiant—even though Defog is relatively uncommon—and using the Attack boost to potentially clean or dent the opposing team. Frogadier pairs excellently with other hazard setters like Tinkatuff, Piloswine, Gabite, and Koffing, supporting it in relentlessly pressuring the opposing team with hazards and other utility or damage-dealing moves. Tinkatuff and Koffing also help Frogadier in dealing with Grass-types, most notably Thwackey, which can easily revenge kill Frogadier with Grassy Glide. Strong Pokemon such as Thwackey, Pikachu, Raboot, Pignite, and Girafarig heavily appreciate Frogadier's Spikes support, which enables them to wallbreak or clean with ease. Thwackey assists Frogadier by dealing with threats like Quaxwell and Wartortle, while Frogadier threatens Fire-types like Raboot, Monferno, and Pignite for Thwackey. Pikachu is a good partner for similar reasons, and it appreciates Frogadier threatening Ground-types such as Piloswine and Gabite. Setup variants of Dunsparce and Vigoroth are also terrific teammates, being excellent wincons. Defensive teammates for Frogadier include Pokemon like Quaxwell and Ivysaur. Quaxwell provides the much-needed Rapid Spin support, ensuring Frogadier's team is unaffected by hazards while the opposing team writhes in agony due to them. Ivysaur fends off pesky Grass- and Water-types for Frogadier.</p>"

Whether it runs Choice Band to immediately empower its moves or Swords Dance to make it even scarier to switch into, its threatening Grassy Terrain-powered attacks like the powerful Wood Hammer and priority move in Grassy Glide can decimate teams without a Grass-resistant Pokemon, and even Grass-resistant Pokemon do not appreciate its utility in Knock Off and U-turn. Unlike most wallbreakers, Thwackey's Grassy Glide also enables it to pick off faster wallbreakers like Frogadier and Pikachu, and its Grassy Surge ability also provides valuable healing for offensive and defensive Pokemon that need recovery, like Pignite and Tinkatuff. However, Thwackey can struggle to bypass Grass-resistant checks like Tinkatuff and Ivysaur due to relying on its utility moves for coverage. Outside of Grassy Terrain, its merely good Speed leaves it vulnerable to getting picked off by faster attackers like Frogadier and Drakloak.</p>",

Knock Off creates progress against foes resistant to its STAB moves like Monferno and Koffing, helping out teammates like Vigoroth and Pignite. U-turn lets Thwackey pivot out from unfavorable matchups like Tinkatuff and Pignite.

Walls like Misdreavus and Tinkatuff can spread paralysis and initiate progress through chipping threats down such as opposing Misdreavus and Clefairy with Night Shade and Knock Off, respectively; Tinkatuff also checks Poison-types. In return, Thwackey forces out Ground-types like Gabite and Piloswine and weakens Ground-type attacks. Cleaners like Nasty Plot Girafarig and Fraxure can work together to overwhelm shared Steel-type checks. Opposing Grass-types and Grass-immune Pokemon like Ivysaur and Girafarig are challenging foes if Thwackey is locked into the wrong move; Steel-types like Hisuian Sliggoo and the aforementioned Tinkatuff can help check these foes and retaliate with powerful STAB moves and defensive utility, respectively.</p>"

Double-Edge's power rises to nuclear levels after Swords Dance activates Libero, even 2HKOing Quaxwell at +2. High Jump Kick is an alternative to Double-Edge, letting Raboot handle Naclstack while also dealing with Thick Fat Piloswine and Dunsparce more effectively. Quick Attack and Sucker Punch are both options to address faster checks to Raboot like Frogadier and pick off weakened threats such as Girafarig. Quick Attack is more consistent and boosted by Libero after Swords Dance, while Sucker Punch is a riskier, prediction-reliant option that also hits Drakloak. Heavy-Duty Boots is used to ensure Raboot doesn't take entry hazard damage and remains in peak condition for setup. Libero flips difficult matchups such as against Water-types like Quaxwell and Wartortle while also powering up Double-Edge and Quick Attack after Swords Dance. Alternatively, Blaze always keeps the STAB boost on Flare Blitz, helping against foes like defensive Misdreavus; it also maintains Raboot's Grassy Glide and Ice Shard resistance as well as Will-O-Wisp immunity.</p> <p>Raboot's potential is best unleashed on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Piloswine benefits from Raboot's ability to bait in and destroy its prime check in Quaxwell; it, in return, provides Stealth Rock support to Raboot. Tinkatuff, Frogadier, and Koffing are also excellent partners for entry hazard support. Furthermore, Tinkatuff provides item removal support with Knock Off and Pickpocket, weakening the opposing team for Raboot to sweep effectively. Raboot heavily appreciates Knock Off support, so Pokemon like Thwackey and Vigoroth make wonderful teammates. Since Raboot's longevity is quite low, Thwackey's Grassy Terrain helps it to last longer on the field; it also provides U-turn support, helping bring Raboot safely in against foes like Ivysaur. Specially offensive powerhouses such as Misdreavus, Girafarig, and Choice Specs Drakloak also synergize well with Raboot, working in unison to demolish opposing teams, especially their defensive core, and pick off any foe late-game that Raboot may have failed to KO. Secondary setup sweepers and cleaners such as Wartortle and Servine also appreciate the holes Raboot blows in the opposing team, enjoying the potential fainting of threats like Quaxwell and Ivysaur. Servine's plus point as a Raboot partner is that it answers Naclstack when Raboot's not running High Jump Kick. Quaxwell provides a safe entry point for Raboot through pivoting, ensuring it takes no damage before setting up. It also deals with foes Raboot has trouble with, such as Pignite and Monferno, especially Mach Punch variants of Monferno. Morgrem provides dual screens support to Raboot, helping mitigate its bulk issues. When running Libero, Raboot can struggle against Ghost-types like Drakloak and Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus; thus, Normal-types like Dunsparce and the aforementioned Girafarig make amazing teammates.</p>"

Hydro Pump can be used to break past Fire- and Ground-types like Pignite and Piloswine, while Surf can be used as a less powerful but more reliable option. Thunderbolt is an effective coverage option that can zap Water-types like Quaxwell and Wartortle efficiently. Alternatively, teams that have status-spreading support from teammates like Glare Servine, Toxic Spikes Koffing, Glare or Body Slam Dunsparce, and Will-O-Wisp Misdreavus can opt to use Hex, which is more powerful than Shadow Ball against foes with status. Infiltrator can prevent Substitute + Swords Dance Gabite from being safe against Drakloak, allowing it to function more effectively as a revenge killer. A Modest nature can help Drakloak break more efficiently at the cost of being slower than Frogadier, Raboot, and Vigoroth; it does secure a 2HKO on Quaxwell with Draco Meteor after taking entry hazard chip damage, which can be valuable on sets without Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Choice Specs Drakloak functions best on balance and bulky offense teams that have Knock Off and entry hazard support, using its powerful STAB attacks to clean late-game once its checks like Dunsparce and Tinkatuff are worn down. Clefairy and especially Tinkatuff are excellent teammates for Drakloak, providing Knock Off and Stealth Rock support to go along with their immunity to Dragon-type attacks from opposing Drakloak and other threats like Choice Scarf Gabite and Frogadier. Monferno similarly provides Knock Off and Stealth Rock support while being able to threaten Tinkatuff. Quaxwell can provide hazard removal, check Piloswine, and give Drakloak safe entry points with its Flip Turn, notably enabling it to hit the field safely against Quaxwell's most common switch-in, Misdreavus. Piloswine is a great teammate because it provides Stealth Rock support, while Drakloak can spinblock and check Quaxwell for Piloswine in return. Drakloak has to be wary of Dunsparce, Piloswine, and Vigoroth, as all three can tank its attacks and use the opportunity to dish out high damage in return. Wartortle is another problem for Drakloak, as it can use the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor as an opportunity to set up with Shell Smash. Teammates that can help with these threats include Dunsparce, which can help sponge attacks from Piloswine, and Thwackey, which can provide safe entry points with U-turn and has the powerful Grassy Glide to take down Piloswine and Wartortle if they take some chip damage first. Misdreavus can also help sponge attacks from these foes, though it can be tricky to stack Ghost-types without becoming too weak to Knock Off and opposing Ghost-types. Pignite is a great teammate, as it can use its STAB attacks to help break through bulky Normal- and Steel-types, such as Dunsparce, Tinkatuff, and Vigoroth, while providing Knock Off support. Raboot can also help in these endeavors; it lacks Knock Off but can still use U-turn to give Drakloak entry points against Pokemon like Quaxwell. Koffing can help check Clefairy while boosting the damage of Hex by spreading Toxic Spikes, and other status spreaders like Glare Servine and Thunder Wave can Tinkatuff also provide this support.</p>"

Encore is a great tool to punish foes trying to take advantage of Quaxwell's passivity by setting up such as Fraxure, Gabite, and Wartortle.

Its natural bulk and defensive typing make it a inherent switch-in to the tier's many offensive powerhouses, such as Servine, Girafarig, and Ivysaur, and it can simultaneously pressure the opposition with its vast array of utility moves. While Tinkatuff might face slight competition from Clefairy for the role of a defensive Fairy-type due to the latter's access to Magic Guard, reliable recovery, and Night Shade, Tinkatuff's additional Steel typing and Speed make it the more consistent option. In addition, it is an excellent Knock Off absorber thanks to Pickpocket stealing opposing Eviolites. Lastly, Tinkatuff can be an adept wallbreaker with its deep coverage movepool and acceptable offensive stats, beating out otherwise standard checks like Gabite and Piloswine. Despite Tinkatuff's excellent defensive capabilities, its lack of reliable recovery makes it very susceptible to being worn down over the course of a game, and its reliance on Knock Off for damage makes it passive and easily pressured by wallbreakers like Piloswine, Gabite, and Pignite. Offensively, Tinkatuff can be lacking if its moves don't hit for super effective damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mold Breaker over Pickpocket allows Tinkatuff to bypass Hattrem's and Naclstack's abilities, though these Pokemon struggle in the current metagame, and stealing items from physical attackers is preferred. Air Balloon on the defensive set can be useful for its one-time Ground immunity against foes like Piloswine and Gabite; however, it makes Tinkatuff much more reliant on stealing items via Pickpocket outside of those matchups. Swords Dance sets can surprise bulky walls like Clefairy and Vigoroth, consistently achieving breakthroughs like 2HKOing Hisuian Sliggoo and Vigoroth at +2 after Stealth Rock damage with Play Rough, though Tinkatuff's power is still relatively low compared to setup sweepers like Fraxure and Raboot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Pignite, Monferno, and Raboot are some of Tinkatuff's worst matchups; though none of them appreciate getting hit with Thunder Wave, they can take any of its standard attacks with relative ease and fire back with devastating STAB moves, with the latter two taking back momentum with U-turn and the former two providing their own utility with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Piloswine and Gabite perform even better against defensive sets, stomaching anything Tinkatuff throws at them and retaliating back with powerful Ground-type coverage. However, they also must be aware of its offensive sets, as they are very vulnerable to the coverage it has, like Steel Beam and Ice Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Hisuian Sliggoo can stomach any of Tinkatuff's attacks with ease and can fire back with powerful Steel-type attacks.

Thunder Wave stops Fire-types like Pignite, Monferno, and Raboot looking to easily force Tinkatuff out. Encore discourages utility moves from slower Pokemon like Piloswine and Clefairy and stymies setup sweepers like Dunsparce and Fraxure.

Encore discourages utility and setup moves like Stealth Rock and Swords Dance from foes like Piloswine and Gabite, while Thunder Wave cripples checks like Thwackey, Servine, and Monferno. If teams need an offensive Stealth Rock setter, Tinkatuff can be used to fill the role and threaten or cripple common Stealth Rock removers and setters like Quaxwell and Piloswine. A Mild nature is necessary for Tinkatuff to maintain its special bulk, while the Speed EVs enable it to outspeed Fraxure. Air Balloon sacrifices the bulk provided by Eviolite in exchange for a one-time Ground immunity.</p> <p>This Tinkatuff set fits much more on offensive builds, sacrificing much of its bulk to lure and beat wallbreakers like Piloswine and Dragon-types like Fraxure and Gabite. Fire-types like Monferno and Raboot benefit greatly from Tinkatuff heavily crippling or eliminating their checks; in return, they can help pivot it in without risking switching to the wrong attack. Tinkatuff's defensive profile still allows it to switch into threats like Girafarig and Ivysaur. While Air Balloon Tinkatuff maintains a one-time immunity to Ground-type attacks, it is still threatened by opposing Fire-types like Pignite and the aforementioned Monferno and Raboot; Quaxwell also makes for an excellent core alongside Tinkatuff, stomaching attacks and removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, potentially freeing up Thunder Wave and allowing Tinkatuff to use Encore, and pivoting with Flip Turn. Mareanie and Koffing can use Toxic Spikes to punish opponents for not having reliable hazard control or a Poison-type and discourage Piloswine and Pignite from switching in. If Tinkatuff is not running Stealth Rock, offensive hazard setters like Frogadier and Piloswine can help rack up additional residual hazard damage with their respective hazards. Alolan Grimer, Naclstack, and other teammates that can check Steel-types and walls like Hisuian Sliggoo and Dunsparce, respectively, are also greatly appreciated.</p>"
