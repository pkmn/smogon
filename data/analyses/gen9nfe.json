Teammates that can appreciate the Eviolite and Toxic Spikes removal include setup sweepers like Girafarig, Monferno, and Dunsparce, helping blow past foes like Tinkatuff and Drakloak; wallbreakers like Pignite and Thwackey also benefit greatly, breaking through walls like Koffing and Dunsparce much easier. Stealth Rock setters like Piloswine and Tinkatuff have great defensive synergy with Ivysaur and are valuable to help wear down the opposition with entry hazard chip damage, as well as, in Tinkatuff's case, helping spread status with Thunder Wave to enable the aforementioned offensive threats even further. Quaxwell is a great teammate, helping sponge attacks from Fire-types like Pignite and Raboot while offering hazard removal to help Ivysaur not get worn down as quickly. Ivysaur, despite its Poison-typing, has a hard time breaking past Koffing because of its combination of Will-O-Wisp and Sludge Bomb; partners like Drakloak and Hisuian Sliggoo are important to help keep Koffing in check. Girafarig and Piloswine are notable threats to Ivysaur, making teammates like Quaxwell and Tinkatuff even more valuable.</p>"

Offensive setup partners, like Swords Dance users Gabite and Thwackey and Nasty Plot Girafarig, can provide tremendous support in wearing down foes that Wartortle struggles against, like Dunsparce and Hisuian Sliggoo. Toxic Spikes support from Glimmet, Ivysaur, and Koffing can also help break through Dunsparce and Quaxwell, though Wartortle still needs them chipped down considerably before attempting to set up and sweep. Thwackey is a great partner, as it provides Grassy Terrain to help Wartortle recover health, allowing it some more leeway while setting up. Servine is a notable Wartortle counter, threatening to OHKO it with Leaf Storm; Monferno and Raboot are great partners to sponge attacks from Servine while offering offensive support and safe entry points via U-turn.</p>"

Capable of running either physically or specially defensive sets, Clefairy is flexible in supporting its teammates, such as using Stealth Rock to allow partners like Gabite and Piloswine to focus more on their offensive capabilities. Magic Guard is a useful tool that allows Clefairy to avoid taking residual entry hazard chip damage while sponging status for its teammates without taking residual damage. While Clefairy does offer immense upside as a utility machine, it does compete for the role with Tinkatuff, a dominant figure in the tier. While Tinkatuff is generally better than Clefairy because of its Steel typing, it does not have access to recovery, which makes Clefairy a capable choice for teams that want their Knock Off and Thunder Wave user to stick around.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Clefairy has access to Calm Mind, which can be used with attacks like Draining Kiss and Flamethrower to hit a large swath of the metagame for nice damage after a few boosts. Healing Wish can allow powerful wallbreakers like Girafarig and Piloswine a second chance to break through the opposition. Trick can be used to disrupt foes as well, opting to steal Eviolite from the foe rather than using Knock Off to remove it or using an unfavorable item like a Choice Scarf to disrupt a switch-in such as Koffing or Tinkatuff.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Item Disruption</strong>: Clefairy can struggle to function as a wall once its Eviolite is removed, rendering it less effective against Knock Off users like Monferno, Servine, and Thwackey. Switcheroo and Trick users, such as Frogadier and Girafarig, can also disrupt Clefairy by giving it an unsavory Choice item.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types</strong>: Koffing, because of its ability Neutralizing Gas removing the effect of Magic Guard, can threaten Clefairy out and use Toxic Spikes to disrupt. Alolan Grimer and Ivysaur can threaten big damage against Clefairy with their STAB attacks while also using Knock Off to remove Eviolite from whatever switches into them.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Hisuian Sliggoo can use its powerful Steel-type STAB attacks to obliterate Clefairy, while Tinkatuff can wall non-Night Shade Clefairy with ease and disrupt it with Encore and Knock Off.

Encore can similarly disrupt the opponent, though it is prediction-reliant, as most things will be faster than Clefairy without being paralyzed. Night Shade can be used to provide consistent damage output, though it can't hit Dunsparce and Girafarig, giving them opportunities to set up in front of Clefairy. Magic Guard allows Clefairy to sponge status moves and other forms of residual damage for its teammates, such as Toxic from Dunsparce, Salt Cure from Naclstack, and Will-O-Wisp from Drakloak, though it does still suffer the effects of paralysis and takes boosted damage from Hex while statused. A specially defensive EV spread with a Calm nature lets Clefairy focus on checking Pokemon like Drakloak, Frogadier, and Choice Specs Drakloak, while a physically defensive EV spread with a Bold nature can let it check Monferno and Piloswine.</p> <p>A natural fit on balance and bulky offense teams, Clefairy can use its utility to free up a moveslot on teammates like Dunsparce, Gabite, and Piloswine. Clefairy uses its bulk and general longevity to disrupt the opposition drastically, allowing offensive teammates, like Frogadier and Girafarig, to clean late-game after Eviolites are removed from walls such as Dunsparce and Tinkatuff. Frogadier is a notable partner for Clefairy, as it uses Spikes to create an entry hazard-stacking core that, with Drakloak as a spinblocker, can rack up hazard chip damage. While Clefairy is fairly bulky and can use Moonlight to stick around for longer, it is generally frail once its Eviolite is removed and can struggle to wall the stronger setup sweepers and wallbreakers in the tier, such as Nasty Plot Girafarig, Contrary + Leaf Storm Servine, and Swords Dance Thwackey. To help with this, Hisuian Sliggoo can cover a lot of these threats because of its own bulk and Steel typing, and it can capitalize on Clefairy removing Eviolites on foes to maximize the damage output of its own strong STAB attacks like Draco Meteor and Flash Cannon. Koffing and Pawniard can also help sponge Knock Offs for Clefairy, with Koffing providing great offensive pressure with Toxic Spikes and Pawniard being a reliable wallbreaker. Fighting-types like Pignite can help Clefairy break through the bulkier Normal- and Steel-types that it can struggle against, like Dunsparce and Hisuian Sliggoo. Gabite can similarly help break through these Pokemon while also threatening Koffing and other Poison-types like Glimmet.</p>"

Duosion is particularly fearsome as it is unaffected by the passive damage from Toxic Spikes due to Magic Guard once Koffing is forced out. RestTalk Hattrem is comfortable switching into Koffing and healing off status damage while threatening to use its STAB moves or Nuzzle.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types:</strong> Dusclops and Drakloak commonly run Night Shade, which lets them trade health against Koffing very efficiently due to its low HP stat.

Will-O-Wisp prevents attackers like Pawniard and Coil Dunsparce from setting up on Koffing and puts Steel-types like Tinkatuff and Hisuian Sliggoo on a timer. Toxic Spikes creates extreme pressure against most team structures due to the limited usage Heavy-Duty Boots sees. Thief turns Koffing into a Knock Off absorber and allows it to steal back Eviolite.

Steel-types like Tinkatuff and Hisuian Sliggoo can halt special wallbreakers like Girafarig and Frogadier that pose big threats once let in. Koffing's best defensive trait is that it walls common Grass-types like Servine, Ivysaur, and especially Thwackey. Therefore, wallbreakers that can make immediate progress but let those in for free like Piloswine, Wartortle, and Drakloak are all most appreciative of its defensive utility. Lastly, bulkier wincons like Duosion and Dunsparce really appreciate Toxic Spikes's passive damage as it eases setup for them and makes them even harder to keep checked.</p>"

Tinkatuff is another exceptional teammate, as it compresses a user of Stealth Rock, Knock Off for opposing Steel-types, and Thunder Wave for nuisances to Girafarig like Frogadier and Drakloak into one teamslot. Dedicated Knock Off absorbers such as Thief Koffing and Pawniard are appreciated as ways to take advantage of an otherwise very hard to punish move.

Alternatively, Dunsparce can be an excellent Stealth Rock setter by using its defensive prowess and movepool. However, Dunsparce can be quite passive without boosts and is very vulnerable to residual damage; status and entry hazards compromise its walling capabilities and make it much easier to check.

While Hakamo-o is more niche, it can use defensive sets to heal paralysis and phaze Dunsparce with Dragon Tail, or it can outlast Dunsparce in the setup war with offensive sets. While not a Fighting-type itself, Raboot can use Libero-boosted coverage and remain similarly threatening.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: While they dislike paralysis, Steel-types like Tinkatuff and Hisuian Sliggoo can wear Dunsparce down with their utility moves: the former's access to Thunder Wave and Encore disrupts sweeping attempts, while the latter's Acid Spray weakens Dunsparce's special bulk and makes it much easier to defeat. Pawniard can set up on utility and Coil sets but falters against Calm Mind variants.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Being quite passive without boosts and being weak to all entry hazards, Dunsparce's walling capabilities falter if it is afflicted with any status. Pokemon that can inflict poison and burn like Ivysaur and Koffing force it to use Roost more often for longevity, while paralysis spreaders like Tinkatuff and Hattrem frustrates its sweeping capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Item Disruption</strong>: Dunsparce's defensive prowess becomes much worse without its Eviolite, so Knock Off users like Tinkatuff, Thwackey, and Ivysaur can force it out early-game. Trick or Switcheroo users like Girafarig, Frogadier, and Lampent can give Dunsparce Choice items that can make it even easier to wall.</p> <p><strong>Naclstack</strong>: While relatively uncommon, Naclstack is immune to status conditions and can whittle Dunsparce down with Salt Cure or even use it as setup fodder with IronPress sets.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Dusclops can easily tank any of Dunsparce's attacks and remove potential boosts with Haze, only fearing the rare Toxic.

As a hazard setter, being unsusceptible to Taunt owing to its ability is a major plus point. While Eviolite provides bulk and flexibility, Choice Band enables Piloswine to capitalize on its unresisted STAB combination to dismantle opposing teams. However, despite its strength and bulk, it lacks longevity due to the absence of non-Rest recovery moves and faces competition from other Stealth Rock setters like Tinkatuff and Dunsparce, which have relatively better longevity, better matchup against the tier's premier hazard removal option in Quaxwell, and greater overall utility.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Trailblaze over Ice Shard or Stealth Rock with more Speed EVs is an option for Piloswine. For instance, it outspeeds Frogadier at +2 with 104 Speed EVs. Trailblaze transforms Piloswine into a good late-game cleaner, potentially bypassing checks like Thwackey at low HP and picking off foes like Monferno. This alternative also helps it in winning mirror matchups. However, if one drops Stealth Rock, it's advisable to run another setter like Tinkatuff, or if one drops Ice Shard, consider other revenge killers like Thwackey and Choice Scarf Frogadier. Similarly, Curse is an option over Stealth Rock, making Piloswine a dangerous late-game cleaner and enabling it to beat its former checks such as Thwackey and Raboot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Quaxwell can switch into any move from Piloswine and use Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock. It can do so multiple times thanks to Roost and threatens Piloswine out with its STAB moves. Other Water-types like Wartortle and Frogadier can check Piloswine with their STAB attacks too. Wartortle also has Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock and is bulky enough to switch into Piloswine once or twice; Frogadier is relatively frailer but stronger.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers and Revenge Killers</strong>: Thwackey can check Piloswine, but it usually needs support to get Piloswine weakened to Grassy Glide range, generally with Knock Off, strong super effective moves, or pivoting moves, as it would rather not risk Wood Hammer. Raboot, Monferno, and Pignite heavily damage Piloswine with their Fighting-type moves. Pokemon such as Choice Specs Girafarig, Servine, and Pawniard do a decent job in picking Piloswine off.</p> <p><strong>Dunsparce</strong>: Dunsparce is physically bulky enough to easily take all of Piloswine's STAB moves with impunity. Dunsparce cripples Piloswine with Toxic and can recover the damage off with Roost.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Piloswine's strong matchups against the tier's other dominant entry hazard setters, such as Tinkatuff and Koffing, and the tier's premier Defogger, Vullaby, allow it to excel as a highly effective Stealth Rock setter. As a wallbreaker, its unresisted STAB combination is extremely threatening to unprepared teams and those that have been weakened by Knock Off, hazards, or other residual damage. High Horsepower allows Piloswine to work effectively even in Grassy Terrain, but Earthquake is also a viable alternative due to its extra power and accuracy. Ice Shard allows Piloswine to pick off weakened threats like Girafarig and Fraxure.</p> <p>Piloswine is a strong fit for most archetypes, and it's especially effective on bulky offense and balance teams. Drakloak is a good teammate for Piloswine; its spinblocking ability, which allows it to handle Quaxwell, complements Piloswine's Stealth Rock setting perfectly. In addition, Drakloak can spread status to support Piloswine's wallbreaking or work in tandem with it to dismantle the opposing team through pivoting. Frogadier is also a superb partner, forming an entry hazard-stacking core with Piloswine; moreover, it provides pivoting support to Piloswine, creating valuable entry opportunities. In a similar vein, Koffing sets Toxic Spikes to maximize hazard pressure; it also acts as a great switch-in to many foes that Piloswine is weak to, handling Grass-types like Thwackey and Servine and absorbing Fighting-type moves from threats like Raboot, Monferno, and Pignite. In general, wallbreakers and cleaners appreciate Piloswine's Stealth Rock support and offensive pressure; Thwackey, Girafarig, Fraxure, and Raboot synergize extremely well with Piloswine, working hand in hand with it to dismantle defensive cores, which may include Pokemon like Dunsparce, Ivysaur, Quaxwell, and Koffing. Thwackey, in particular, is an excellent teammate for Piloswine, dealing with pesky Water-types that check Piloswine, namely Quaxwell, Wartortle, and Frogadier. Thwackey also offers invaluable Knock Off, pivoting, and passive recovery support, bolstering Piloswine's wallbreaking prowess and longevity. In return, Piloswine deals with foes that can prove to be problematic for Thwackey, such as Koffing, Vullaby, and Tinkatuff. Piloswine appreciates Knock Off support a ton; thus, Knock Off users such as Monferno, Pignite, and Ivysaur make amazing teammates, pairing nicely with Piloswine and amplifying its offensive pressure, even allowing it to reach thresholds like 2HKOing maximum Defense Quaxwell that has lost its Eviolite with minimum chip damage.  Defensively, Quaxwell is a remarkable teammate, providing Rapid Spin support to ensure Piloswine's side of the field is free of hazards, thus maximizing hazard pressure on the opposing team. Quaxwell also acts as a switch-in to multiple Pokemon that Piloswine can struggle against, especially if it's chipped or if its Eviolite has been removed by Knock Off, such as Frogadier, Pignite, Monferno, and Raboot; in exchange, Piloswine can deal with foes that Quaxwell is weak to, like Drakloak, Fraxure, and Girafarig. Wartortle is also a good teammate in this regard, though it has less longevity, which is a fair trade for the added offensive pressure. Ivysaur defensively takes care of Grass- and Water-types like Thwackey and Quaxwell for Piloswine, while Piloswine takes care of threats like Girafarig and Tinkatuff.</p>"

High Horsepower is the preferred move under Thwackey's Grassy Terrain, while Earthquake serves as a more consistent option outside of it. Ice Shard picks off foes like Fraxure, Gabite, and low-HP Girafarig. 124 Speed EVs ensure Piloswine outspeeds Quaxwell without Speed investment. Maximum Attack and Speed investment can also be used to not risk Speed tier shenanigans.</p> <p>Piloswine fits on bulky offense and balance teams. It is best paired with entry hazard setters like Tinkatuff, Frogadier, and Koffing to relentlessly pressure foes like Quaxwell and wallbreak as effectively as possible. Tinkatuff and Koffing also act as Knock Off absorbers, aiding Piloswine in keeping its Choice Band, and they also check Grass-types like Thwackey, Ivysaur, and Servine. Tinkatuff can also try to steal Quaxwell's Eviolite with Pickpocket, invalidating it as a potential Piloswine answer. Monferno and Pignite provide Knock Off support and offensively pressure Quaxwell structures Piloswine may face some difficulty against. Special stallbreakers and wallbreakers such as Servine and Choice Specs Girafarig can work in tandem with Piloswine to  dismantle opposing defensive cores with Pokemon like Quaxwell, Dunsparce, Ivysaur, and Tinkatuff. Thwackey and Ivysaur check pesky Water-types that check Piloswine, namely Frogadier, Wartortle, and Quaxwell, while also providing Knock Off support and, in Thwackey's case, passive recovery. In return, Piloswine handles Tinkatuff and Vullaby for them. Piloswine likes taking as little chip damage as possible, so hazard control options such as Quaxwell, Wartortle, and Vullaby are appreciated. Fraxure can take advantage of the holes Piloswine blows into opposing teams to set up and sweep. Servine is also an excellent partner for similar reasons and aids Piloswine by checking Water-types and providing Glare support, potentially mitigating its issue of having mediocre Speed. Pikachu also checks Water-types and provides Volt Switch support to Piloswine, bringing it in on forced switches and enabling its wallbreaking.</p>"

Monferno's Speed, power, and coverage make it an excellent Swords Dance sweeper that can overrun teams without sturdy Fire- and Fighting-type checks, backed up with options like Knock Off and Mach Punch. Monferno can also tap into its utility more to become an all-out attacker, becoming an elite pivot with U-turn while still having STAB moves, Knock Off, and good Speed to back it up. Lastly, its Nasty Plot sets are fantastic at luring physical walls anticipating its physical sets. Monferno's set versatility culminates it in being both a great revenge killer and cleaner. Monferno, however, struggles against physical walls and Water-types like Koffing, Gabite, and Quaxwell without a moderate amount of team support. While Monferno's Speed tier is good, it is still vulnerable to getting outpaced by faster foes like Girafarig and Frogadier. Lastly, Monferno faces competition from its Fire-type brethren, as it has neither Raboot's higher Speed and more diverse coverage nor Pignite's Ground-type coverage and raw strength.</p>",

However, this set loses out on Monferno's flexibility and the bulk gained from Eviolite. Thunder Punch can be used to deal with Mareanie and deal more damage to Quaxwell and Wartortle, though this move is hard to fit over a utility move like Knock Off or U-turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Quaxwell and Mareanie are Monferno's most sturdy checks, able to survive any attacks with ease and retaliate with their STAB moves or make progress against it with Rapid Spin and Toxic Spikes, respectively. Seadra's Poison Point can punish physical Monferno sets for making contact with poison. More offensive Water-types, like Wartortle and Frogadier, can similarly threaten Monferno out with their STAB attacks but have trouble switching in.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: While Monferno has good Speed, it still falls short of many faster threats and is vulnerable to being OHKOed or taking significant damage from them before attacking. Examples of such threats include Girafarig, Drakloak, and Raboot.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Defensive behemoths like Koffing and defensive Gabite can stomach at least one of Monferno's attacks before retaliating with their STAB moves; Gabite is particularly dangerous, with its STAB Earthquake and Rough Skin threatening to immediately end Monferno's sweep. Hattrem can threaten a KO after Monferno takes Stealth Rock damage, but it hates switching into Knock Off. Fletchinder resists both of Monferno's STAB moves and U-turn and can threaten it out with STAB Brave Bird, while Clefairy can threaten Thunder Wave and chip it down with Night Shade.

Knock Off weakens checks like the aforementioned Quaxwell and Koffing while easing setup late-game; it also 2HKOes Drakloak after Stealth Rock. Mach Punch is an alternative to Knock Off that deals significant damage to faster revenge killers like Frogadier, Girafarig, and Raboot. Blaze is the preferred ability to further heighten Monferno's Flare Blitz at low HP, though Iron Fist can be used to boost Mach Punch's power.</p> <p>Monferno fits as a fantastic cleaner on offensive teams or as an offensive Swiss Army knife in balanced builds. Water-types like Quaxwell and Mareanie can extinguish Monferno's sweep early with their excellent bulk; Grass-types like Thwackey, Servine, and Ivysaur are helpful to check these threats. Revenge killers like Girafarig, Gabite, and Choice Specs Drakloak can outspeed and pick it off without much chip damage; defensive backbones like Tinkatuff and utility Dunsparce can be helpful in soaking up damage while accumulating progress with Stealth Rock and paralysis. Knock Off users like Ivysaur and Vullaby are immensely helpful for wearing down walls like Gabite and Koffing, enabling Monferno to sweep much more easily. Other wallbreakers and cleaners, like Fraxure, Thwackey, and Girafarig, can take advantage of Monferno's wallbreaking or help it clean themselves; Thwackey also provides useful healing and reduces Earthquake's damage with Grassy Terrain.</p>"

Its Fire typing makes it a suitable wallbreaker due to it not being crippled by Will-O-Wisp from notable Pokemon like Dusclops and Koffing. U-turn lets Monferno pivot out on its unfavorable matchups and bring its teammates into favorable matchups.

Monferno appreciates teammates such as Girafarig and Thwackey to threaten its main checks in Koffing, Mareanie, and Quaxwell. It also pairs well with teammates like Tinkatuff and Frogadier, which can set entry hazards and weaken foes. Tinkatuff is especially helpful by spreading paralysis to allow Monferno to outspeed and pivot out on potentially dangerous foes, such as Frogadier, Girafarig, and Drakloak. Monferno supports wallbreakers and sweepers like Fraxure and Piloswine by luring in bulky walls like Quaxwell and using Knock Off to weaken them, making it easier for teammates to break through them later. Additionally, it aids these teammates by being a good switch-in to Pokemon like Tinkatuff and Thwackey.

Focus Blast provides essential coverage, dealing with foes like Hisuian Sliggoo, Piloswine, and Quaxwell. Vacuum Wave can pick up KOs on damaged faster foes like Girafarig or Frogadier. Timid nature ensures that Monferno outspeeds and OHKOs foes like Thwackey and allows it to deal sufficient damage without the need for the extra power that Modest would provide.</p> <p>Monferno fits well on offensive teams thanks to its ability to clean up weakened foes late-game. It also excels on balance teams, where it supports physically offensive teammates like Thwackey and Piloswine by luring and removing physical walls such as Quaxwell and Koffing that would otherwise hinder their progress. Monferno pairs well with hazard setters like Tinkatuff, Frogadier, and Gabite, which can lay down Stealth Rock and Spikes to weaken the opponent, facilitating Monferno’s sweeps. A layer of Stealth Rock or Spikes enables Monferno, once boosted, to secure the OHKO range on bulkier foes such as defensive Tinkatuff with Fire Blast, or Coil Dunsparce and defensive Gabite with Focus Blast. Wallbreakers like Piloswine and Thwackey are essential teammates, as they clear out key defensive checks such as Mareanie and Quaxwell, respectively. Paralysis absorbers, such as Eelektrik and Piloswine, help mitigate Monferno’s vulnerability to paralysis, which could otherwise allow slower threats like Pignite or Piloswine to outspeed and threaten it. Thunder Wave spreaders are also valuable to provide additional speed control; teammates like Clefairy or Tinkatuff stop faster Pokemon, such as Murkrow or Frogadier, otherwise able to get the jump on Monferno.

  "Pignite": {
    "overview": "<p>Pignite is a powerful wallbreaker in the NFE metagame, using its powerful Fire- and Fighting-type STAB attacks to break through teams while having exceptional coverage in Knock Off and High Horsepower. Pignite is no slouch defensively either, with great natural bulk that makes it capable of trading blows with powerful foes like Monferno, Raboot, and Fraxure as needed. On top of this, it has access to Bulk Up which can make it even more imposing. While Pignite is a robust option for teams, it isn't without flaws; though it can usually sponge an attack or two from opposing wallbreakers, it can struggle to hit at times because of how slow it is. Monferno is a similar wallbreaker to Pignite that trades a little bit of power for more utility in U-turn, Slack Off, and Stealth Rock, which makes it slightly more favorable for some team compositions. Faster wallbreakers like Frogadier, Gabite, and Wartortle can all give Pignite problems, with the latter two capable of using it as setup fodder. To circumvent this, Pignite can use Sucker Punch to inflict damage before being KOed or even take down an unsuspecting revenge killer like Frogadier or Girafarig.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Bulk Up furthers Pignite's offensive and defensive capabilities and works well in conjunction with Sucker Punch to secure potential KOs against faster foes like Frogadier and Girafarig. Drain Punch is a weaker STAB attack than Close Combat but offers healing and doesn't lower its defenses. Choice Band sets rely more on prediction but can offer tremendous power, making Pignite much harder to wall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Quaxwell is capable of sponging Pignite's attacks with ease while recovering any damage with Roost. Frogadier and Wartortle are faster wallbreakers that can threaten to revenge kill Pignite. Mareanie tanks most attacks thrown its way as well, easily recovering the damage with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Faster Wallbreakers</strong>: Given how slow Pignite is, nearly every wallbreaker in the tier can revenge kill it with ease once it has been chipped a bit. Notable examples include Gabite and Girafarig, though Girafarig has to look out for Sucker Punch. Fraxure can sponge an attack and use Pignite as setup fodder, as can Monferno though to a lesser extent.</p>",

Knock Off removes Eviolites to make wallbreaking easier for itself and teammates while also hitting Ghost- and Psychic-types like Drakloak and Girafarig hard. High Horsepower can be used to nail Fire- and Poison-types like Monferno, Koffing, Mareanie, and opposing Pignite; Sucker Punch is an alternative that helps circumvent its lower Speed to hit faster wallbreakers like Frogadier and Girafarig first. An Adamant nature allows Pignite to maximize its damage output while still outpacing foes like Piloswine and bulky Tinkatuff. Blaze can boost the power of Flare Blitz to the point of achieving notable damage rolls, including a 2HKO on Clefairy and Koffing, the latter after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Pignite is a natural fit on balance and bulky offense teams that need a powerful wallbreaker and additional Knock Off support. Faster wallbreakers like Frogadier and Girafarig can benefit from having Pignite remove Eviolites and wear teams down mid-game, allowing them to more effectively clean late-game. Entry hazard support from teammates like Gabite, Tinkatuff, and the aforementioned Frogadier can go a long way in chipping down the opposition, making would-be checks to Pignite like Mareanie and Quaxwell less capable of walling it over the course of a game. Drakloak can help spinblock against Quaxwell to ensure the hazards on the foes' side stay active, along with spreading status via Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp to help Pignite in its efforts to wallbreak. Frogadier and Wartortle are especially threatening foes for Pignite, so teammates that can keep them in check, such as Dunsparce and Tinkatuff, are vital. Specially defensive Clefairy can also wall these threats while providing Stealth Rock and Knock Off support. Quaxwell pairs well with Pignite, tanking Ground- and Water-type attacks thrown its way from the likes of Piloswine and Frogadier while providing hazard removal to keep it healthy. Thwackey checks the Water-types that threaten Pignite, such as Frogadier and Quaxwell, while using U-turn to provide safe entry points against foes like Ivysaur and Koffing that may try to check Thwackey. The Grassy Terrain provided by Thwackey also lowers the damage of Piloswine's Earthquake, allowing Pignite to more comfortably take it on if needed.</p>"

Choice Band sets are extremely threatening for their immediate power and access to First Impression, while Swords Dance sets terrify structures with their immense power after setup and Scale Shot to bypass Fraxure's mediocre Speed and ability to threaten revenge killers. However, Fraxure is held back by its low Speed and bulk; if it cannot use First Impression, much of the metagame can easily outspeed it, and even after a boost, Choice Scarf users like Frogadier and Monferno can easily revenge kill it. Fraxure's typing is a double-edged sword: while it is fantastic offensively and can let Fraxure set up against weaker walls, it also leaves Fraxure very vulnerable against metagame staples like Piloswine and Wartortle.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Poison Jab can be used over Scale Shot to target Clefairy and the uncommon Morgrem while potentially poisoning bulky threats like Piloswine and Dunsparce, though the low poison chance combined with the move's narrower coverage makes it difficult to fit over another attack.

Dragon Dance can be an alternative way of setting up, though Scale Shot's immediate damage output makes Swords Dance the preferred option.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Tinkatuff, Clefairy, and the uncommon Morgrem are some of Fraxure's biggest threats; barring the rare Poison Jab, they can switch into Fraxure relatively easily and threaten it with either Thunder Wave or STAB attacks. Tinkatuff can even run Air Balloon to completely wall Fraxure barring First Impression.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Physical walls like Koffing, Dunsparce, and Naclstack can comfortably stomach even a boosted Fraxure, threaten it with status, and heal off the damage with their recovery moves, with the latter two even using it as setup fodder.

Tinkatuff also provides Knock Off support, and Hattrem can use Healing Wish to give Fraxure a second chance at sweeping. Other wallbreakers and cleaners, like Thwackey and Raboot, are also helpful in working together with Fraxure to more easily break down the opposition.

First Impression is its primary revenge killing tool, being able to pick off several top-tier threats such as Girafarig, Thwackey, and Frogadier. Dragon Claw, unlike Outrage, doesn't lock Fraxure in and helps it avoid being crippled by Fairy-types like Clefairy and Tinkatuff. Stomping Tantrum hits Tinkatuff, 2HKOes Koffing, and OHKOes Pawniard after Stealth Rock damage. An Adamant nature maximizes Fraxure's offensive potential, letting it hit thresholds like always 2HKOing Quaxwell with Outrage and maximum Defense Tinkatuff with Stomping Tantrum.</p> <p>Fraxure fits on bulky offense and balance teams as a dedicated physical wallbreaker and anti-offense revenge killer. It works best when paired with pivots and entry hazard setters, as they provide it with entry opportunities and facilitate its wallbreaking. Frogadier excels in both roles, making it a wonderful partner. Quaxwell, Raboot, and Thwackey provide pivoting support and handle Piloswine, one of the best checks to Fraxure; moreover, Quaxwell provides Rapid Spin support, ensuring Fraxure stays for long in the game. Fraxure can't afford to take Knock Off because it loses too much power; Tinkatuff helps by acting as a Knock Off absorber and also provides Stealth Rock and Knock Off support. Other hazard-setting teammates include Piloswine and Koffing. Piloswine can also act as a Tinkatuff switch-in in case Fraxure is Choice-locked into a move other than Stomping Tantrum. Fraxure is vulnerable to paralysis spreaders like Hattrem and Clefairy, which can cut into its offensive prowess. Thus, paralysis absorbers like Gabite and Koffing are great teammates. Special wallbreakers work excellently with Fraxure, ripping apart defensive cores with ease. Choice Specs Drakloak, Hisuian Sliggoo, and aforementioned Girafarig are all suited for the job. Fraxure appreciates Knock Off support a lot because Eviolite removal makes it even deadlier in its job. Thus, Pokemon like Monferno, Pignite, Vullaby as well as the previously mentioned Thwackey pair amazingly with it, with Vullaby even providing Defog support. Fraxure often gets Choice-locked in the wrong move, so having a solid defensive core backing it up is of utmost importance, especially on balance teams. Defensive options to pair Fraxure with include Pokemon like Ivysaur, Drakloak, and the aforementioned Quaxwell and Koffing.</p>"

    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gunk Shot is an option to blast through Clefairy, but it's usually not worth dropping Sucker Punch for. Quick Attack is a solid option over Sucker Punch because it doesn't have to rely on the foe to attack, but the difference in power is hard to justify, especially since it loses out on doing any significant damage to Drakloak. Choice Band can be used on Raboot's offensive pivot set, but being Choice locked and not having Heavy-Duty Boots is generally not worth the extra power.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Quaxwell and Mareanie can eat up attacks from Raboot and heal them off with no issue. Wartortle and Frogadier can pressure Raboot well offensively but can't take repeated hits from it and need to watch out for being in Sucker Punch's KO range.</p> <p><strong>Physical Tanks</strong>: Clefairy can switch into any of Raboot's attacks without fear and threaten it with Thunder Wave or Night Shade, but it has to be aware of the Swords Dance set overpowering it. Koffing is a little less passive with Sludge Bomb and can take hits very well while being able to heal up with Pain Split. Gabite can punish Raboot's U-turn with Rough Skin and takes hits well enough, but it doesn't have any form of recovery.</p> <p><strong>Fast Attackers</strong>: Frogadier and Drakloak naturally outspeed Raboot and can pressure it with their STAB attacks or Thunder Wave in the case of Drakloak. Choice Scarf users like Girafarig and Monferno can also get the jump on Raboot and threaten it for big damage.</p> <p><strong>Thunder Wave</strong>: Raboot has to be careful of switching into paralysis-inflicting moves from Tinkatuff and Servine, as they can really hurt its ability to perform as a strong pivot. Dunsparce, Drakloak, and Clefairy also carry paralysis-inflicting moves, but Raboot rarely wants to stay in versus them.</p>",

      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Raboot makes for a threatening offensive pivot with its great Speed and powerful ability accompanied with strong coverage moves. High Jump Kick slams Fire-resistant Pokemon like Gabite, Pignite, and Naclstack. U-turn helps Raboot pivot out of bad matchups versus the likes of Quaxwell, Mareanie, and Koffing. Sucker Punch is great at picking off faster foes like Frogadier, Drakloak, and Choice Scarf Girafarig. Heavy-Duty Boots is chosen over the normally popular Eviolite in order to keep Raboot healthy, as it will be pivoting in and out many times, usually trying to avoid taking attacks due to it being frail with no Eviolite.</p> <p>Raboot works well on balance and offensive teams looking to form a pivot core. Thwackey, Frogadier, and Drakloak are all great partners, since they can pressure checks to Raboot like Quaxwell, Gabite, and Koffing, respectively. Quaxwell, Mareanie, and Clefairy pose a great threat to Raboot because they can eat up all of its coverage moves and have reliable recovery, so checks to them like Ivysaur and Hisuian Sliggoo are helpful to combat them. Knock Off users like Pignite and Tinkatuff are also helpful versus these defensive walls, since Raboot can have an easier time removing them if they get chipped. Frogadier and Drakloak naturally outspeed and threaten Raboot, so teammates to combat them like Servine and Clefairy are appreciated. Paralysis-inflicting moves from Tinkatuff, Servine, and Drakloak can greatly inhibit Raboot's ability to perform as a pivot, making Thunder Wave absorbers like Naclstack, Hisuian Sliggoo, and Dunsparce helpful. Wallbreakers like Girafarig, Hisuian Sliggoo, and Pikachu all appreciate Raboot bringing them into good matchups against its passive checks.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Raboot is a dangerous setup sweeper that can be extremely annoying to stop once it's set up. Double-Edge's power rises to nuclear levels after Swords Dance activates Libero, even 2HKOing Quaxwell at +2. High Jump Kick is an alternative to Double-Edge, letting Raboot handle Naclstack while also dealing with Thick Fat Piloswine and Dunsparce more effectively. Quick Attack and Sucker Punch are both options to address faster checks to Raboot like Frogadier and pick off weakened threats such as Girafarig. Quick Attack is more consistent and boosted by Libero after Swords Dance, while Sucker Punch is a riskier, prediction-reliant option that also hits Drakloak. Heavy-Duty Boots is used to ensure Raboot doesn't take entry hazard damage and remains in peak condition for setup. Libero flips difficult matchups such as against Water-types like Quaxwell and Wartortle while also powering up Double-Edge and Quick Attack after Swords Dance. Alternatively, Blaze always keeps the STAB boost on Flare Blitz, helping against foes like Dusclops; it also maintains Raboot's Grassy Glide and Ice Shard resistance as well as Will-O-Wisp immunity.</p> <p>Raboot's potential is best unleashed on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Piloswine benefits from Raboot's ability to bait in and destroy its prime check in Quaxwell; it, in return, provides Stealth Rock support to Raboot. Tinkatuff, Frogadier, and Koffing are also excellent partners for entry hazard support. Furthermore, Tinkatuff provides item removal support with Knock Off and Pickpocket, weakening the opposing team for Raboot to sweep effectively. Raboot heavily appreciates Knock Off support, so Pokemon like Thwackey and Clefairy make wonderful teammates. Since Raboot's longevity is quite low, Thwackey's Grassy Terrain helps it to last longer on the field; it also provides U-turn support, helping bring Raboot safely in against foes like Ivysaur. Specially offensive powerhouses such as Girafarig and Choice Specs Drakloak also synergize well with Raboot, working in unison to demolish opposing teams, especially their defensive core, and pick off any foe late-game that Raboot may have failed to KO. Secondary setup sweepers and cleaners such as Wartortle and Servine also appreciate the holes Raboot blows in the opposing team, enjoying the potential fainting of threats like Quaxwell and Ivysaur. Servine's plus point as a Raboot partner is that it answers Naclstack when Raboot's not running High Jump Kick. Quaxwell provides a safe entry point for Raboot through pivoting, ensuring it takes no damage before setting up. It also deals with foes Raboot has trouble with, such as Pignite and Monferno, especially Mach Punch variants of Monferno. Morgrem provides dual screens support to Raboot, helping mitigate its bulk issues. When running Libero, Raboot can struggle against Ghost-types like Drakloak and Dusclops; thus, Normal-types like Dunsparce and the aforementioned Girafarig make amazing teammates.</p>"

Boasting the highest unboosted Speed in the metagame alongside a variety of utility options, Drakloak is an excellent phazer capable of disrupting attackers and walls alike with Dragon Tail, Night Shade, and status while also doubling as a spinblocker. Additionally, Drakloak is a great wallbreaker, leveraging its high-powered coverage and Speed to disrupt foes expecting utility sets, like Gabite and Naclstack. However, its frailty and typing make it very vulnerable to Knock Off, making matchups like Monferno and Thwackey difficult. Night Shade sets are walled by Normal-types like Dunsparce and Girafarig, while Choice Specs sets can suffer from being too weak even against foes like Tinkatuff and utility Dunsparce.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Status-spreader sets running Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp alongside Hex capitalize on Drakloak's support capabilities. Drakloak can run a dual screens set alongside Light Clay, capitalizing on its deep utility movepool with options like U-turn, Thunder Wave, and Curse, though Morgrem tends to be the superior dual screens setter, the archetype is uncommon, and Drakloak prefers running offensive or more standard utility sets. Hydro Pump can be used on the Choice Specs set to surprise Piloswine and Naclstack while maintaining good coverage against Fire-types, though it loses out on either Fire Blast's wider overall coverage or U-turn's pivoting.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Drakloak heavily struggles against Fairy-types like Tinkatuff and Clefairy with both sets, with only Fire Blast being threatening against physically bulky Tinkatuff variants. Clefairy particularly does well, recovering any damage with ease and disrupting Drakloak with its own utility moves. However, the RestTalk set can outlast the Fairy-types, though it doesn't enjoy losing Eviolite to Knock Off and being locked into unfavorable moves with Encore.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Dunsparce is one of the most consistent answers to Drakloak, being immune to Night Shade and forcing it to use Draco Meteor or Dragon Tail phazing to threaten notable damage. Dunsparce can recover the damage away with Slack Off and use Drakloak as setup fodder. Girafarig is similarly effective against Night Shade sets but struggles a lot more against Choice Specs sets.</p> <p><strong>Piloswine</strong>: Piloswine can tank any hit from Drakloak with ease and revenge kill it; Ice Shard against Choice Specs sets requires minimal chip damage for it to KO.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: While relatively uncommon, Dark-types like Alolan Grimer, Vullaby, and Pawniard perform excellently against Drakloak, resisting at least one of its STAB moves and threatening it back with their own. Alolan Grimer and Vullaby can stomach even Choice Specs-boosted attacks and fire back with Knock Off, while Pawniard resists Drakloak's STAB moves and can KO it first with Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Naclstack</strong>: While similarly uncommon, Naclstack is immune to status conditions and can whittle Drakloak down with Salt Cure, only fearing the rare Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Moves</strong>: While Drakloak is the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, it struggles to deal with Choice Scarf users like Frogadier and Girafarig that can outspeed it with a boost. Sucker Punch users like Raboot and Pignite remain similarly dangerous in spite of their lower Speed tiers, alongside Piloswine's Ice Shard.</p>",

      "RestTalk": {
        "description": "<p>The combination of Night Shade and Dragon Tail alongside Drakloak's high Speed and valued typing makes it a premier phazer. RestTalk gives it longevity, making it a good status absorber for burns, paralysis, and poison from status users like Koffing and Hattrem, all while allowing Drakloak to continue phazing, spinblocking, and chipping foes. 216 Speed EVs enable Drakloak to outspeed non-Choice Scarf Frogadier and make it the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, while the 40 EVs in Defense enable it to always survive Knock Off from Life Orb Thwackey and Icicle Crash from non-Choice Band Piloswine. While Drakloak's abilities are all useful, Clear Body stands out by not having Drakloak's Speed be lowered by Sticky Web, as well as stopping Memento from lead Glimmet sets.</p> <p>Drakloak tends to fit on many balanced and bulky teams, being integral to stopping Rapid Spin attempts from Quaxwell. Entry hazard setters like Piloswine, Frogadier, and Quilladin all pair well with it, forming a hazard-stacking core while providing utility in their own right. Fairy-types like Tinkatuff and Clefairy can be tricky to deal with, able to lock Drakloak into unfavorable moves with Encore and chip away at it with their utility moves. Checks to them like Gabite and Ivysaur can significantly threaten them back while taking paralysis relatively well. Normal-types like Dunsparce and Girafarig are immune to Night Shade and can threaten super effective coverage or powerful Psychic-type STAB moves; Steel-types like the aforementioned Tinkatuff and Hisuian Sliggoo are excellent answers to them. While Drakloak has a good defensive profile, its frailty makes it unreliable at answering certain Pokemon like Monferno and Thwackey; Koffing makes for an excellent Knock Off absorber while completing hazard cores with Toxic Spikes and potentially stealing other Eviolites with Thief. Wallbreakers and revenge killers like Fraxure and Raboot can take advantage of Drakloak's spinblocking capabilities to more easily break down defensive titans like Quaxwell and Koffing from the accumulated residual damage. Given Drakloak's vulnerability to Piloswine, checks to it like Quaxwell and Dunsparce are also appreciated; Quaxwell can pivot and remove hazards with Rapid Spin.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Drakloak is an effective wallbreaker and, with a Timid nature, speed control option, using its powerful STAB moves in conjunction with great coverage options to break through even the sturdiest of checks. Hydro Pump can be used to break past Fire- and Ground-types like Pignite and Piloswine, while Surf can be used as a less powerful but more reliable option. Thunderbolt is an effective coverage option that can zap Water-types like Quaxwell and Wartortle efficiently. Alternatively, if teams have status-spreading support from teammates like Glare Servine, Toxic Spikes Koffing, Glare or Body Slam Dunsparce, Drakloak can opt to use Hex, which is more powerful than Shadow Ball against foes with status. Infiltrator can prevent Substitute users like Wartortle and offensive Gabite from being safe against Drakloak, allowing it to function more effectively as a revenge killer. A Modest nature can help Drakloak break more efficiently at the cost of being slower than Frogadier and Raboot; it does secure a 2HKO on Quaxwell with Draco Meteor after taking entry hazard chip damage, which can be valuable on sets without Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Choice Specs Drakloak functions best on balance and bulky offense teams that have Knock Off and entry hazard support, using its powerful STAB attacks to clean late-game once its checks like Dunsparce and Tinkatuff are worn down. Clefairy and especially Tinkatuff are excellent teammates for Drakloak, providing Knock Off and Stealth Rock support to go along with their immunity to Dragon-type attacks from opposing Drakloak and other threats like Choice Scarf Gabite and Frogadier. Monferno similarly provides Knock Off and Stealth Rock support while being able to threaten Tinkatuff. Quaxwell can provide hazard removal, check Piloswine, and give Drakloak safe entry points with its Flip Turn. Piloswine is a great teammate because it provides Stealth Rock support, while Drakloak can spinblock and check Quaxwell for Piloswine in return. Drakloak has to be wary of Dunsparce and Piloswine, as both can tank its attacks and use the opportunity to dish out high damage in return. Wartortle is another problem for Drakloak, as it can use the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor as an opportunity to set up with Shell Smash. Teammates that can help with these threats include Dunsparce, which can help sponge attacks from Piloswine, and Thwackey, which can provide safe entry points with U-turn and has the powerful Grassy Glide to take down Piloswine and Wartortle if they take some chip damage first. Pignite is a great teammate, as it can use its STAB attacks to help break through bulky Normal- and Steel-types, such as Dunsparce and Tinkatuff, while providing Knock Off support. Raboot can also help in these endeavors; it lacks Knock Off but can still use U-turn to give Drakloak entry points against Pokemon like Quaxwell. Koffing can help check Clefairy while boosting the damage of Hex by spreading Toxic Spikes, and other status spreaders like Glare Servine and Thunder Wave can Tinkatuff also provide this support.</p>"

Encore is a great tool to punish foes trying to take advantage of Quaxwell's passivity by setting up such as Fraxure, Gabite, and Wartortle. Surf can be used over Encore on teams that already have great counterplay to these setup users, giving Quaxwell a better way to punish the likes of Piloswine, Pignite, and Monferno without being forced to pivot with Flip Turn. Triple Axel can be used to punish Drakloak from trying to block its Rapid Spin and threaten out Grass- and Dragon-type switchins like Thwackey, Servine, Gabite, and Fraxure.

Its natural bulk and defensive typing make it a inherent switch-in to the tier's many offensive powerhouses, such as Servine, Girafarig, and Ivysaur, and it can simultaneously pressure the opposition with its vast array of utility moves. While Tinkatuff might face slight competition from Clefairy for the role of a defensive Fairy-type due to the latter's access to Magic Guard, reliable recovery, and Night Shade, Tinkatuff's additional Steel typing and Speed make it the more consistent option. In addition, it is an excellent Knock Off absorber thanks to Pickpocket stealing opposing Eviolites. Lastly, Tinkatuff can be an adept wallbreaker with its deep coverage movepool and acceptable offensive stats, beating out otherwise standard checks like Gabite and Piloswine. Despite Tinkatuff's excellent defensive capabilities, its lack of reliable recovery makes it very susceptible to being worn down over the course of a game, and its reliance on Knock Off for damage makes it passive and easily pressured by wallbreakers like Piloswine, Gabite, and Pignite. Offensively, Tinkatuff can be lacking if its moves don't hit for super effective damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mold Breaker over Pickpocket allows Tinkatuff to bypass Hattrem's and Naclstack's abilities, though these Pokemon struggle in the current metagame, and stealing items from physical attackers is preferred. Air Balloon on the defensive set can be useful for its one-time Ground immunity against foes like Piloswine and Gabite; however, it makes Tinkatuff much more reliant on stealing items via Pickpocket outside of those matchups. Swords Dance sets can surprise bulky walls like Clefairy and Hisuian Sliggoo, consistently achieving breakthroughs like 2HKOing the latter at +2 after Stealth Rock damage with Play Rough, though Tinkatuff's power is still relatively low compared to setup sweepers like Fraxure and Raboot.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Fire-types like Pignite, Monferno, and Raboot are some of Tinkatuff's worst matchups; though none of them appreciate getting hit with Thunder Wave, they can take any of its standard attacks with relative ease and fire back with devastating STAB moves, with the latter two taking back momentum with U-turn and the former two providing their own utility with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types like Piloswine and Gabite perform even better against defensive sets, stomaching anything Tinkatuff throws at them and retaliating back with powerful Ground-type coverage. However, they also must be aware of its offensive sets, as they are very vulnerable to the coverage it has, like Steel Beam and Ice Hammer.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Hisuian Sliggoo can stomach any of Tinkatuff's attacks with ease and can fire back with powerful Steel-type attacks. Opposing Tinkatuff can jeopardize its role as a wall through their own Knock Off and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Item Disruption</strong>: Removal of Tinkatuff's Eviolite makes it harder for it to check the Pokemon it wants to.

Thunder Wave stops Fire-types like Pignite, Monferno, and Raboot looking to easily force Tinkatuff out. Encore discourages utility moves from slower Pokemon like Piloswine and Clefairy and stymies setup sweepers like Dunsparce and Fraxure.

These Pokemon also benefit from Tinkatuff being the defensive glue to switch into opposing Girafarig, Grass-types like Servine and Ivysaur, and opposing Tinkatuff. Tinkatuff is heavily threatened by Fire- and Ground-types like Raboot and Piloswine; Quaxwell stands out as an excellent partner to stomach their attacks and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin.

While Air Balloon Tinkatuff maintains a one-time immunity to Ground-type attacks, it is still threatened by opposing Fire-types like Pignite and the aforementioned Monferno and Raboot; Quaxwell also makes for an excellent core alongside Tinkatuff, stomaching attacks and removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, potentially freeing up Thunder Wave and allowing Tinkatuff to use Encore, and pivoting with Flip Turn. Mareanie and Koffing can use Toxic Spikes to punish opponents for not having reliable hazard control or a Poison-type and discourage Piloswine and Pignite from switching in. If Tinkatuff is not running Stealth Rock, offensive hazard setters like Frogadier and Piloswine can help rack up additional residual hazard damage with their respective hazards.
