  "Victreebel": {
    "overview": "<p>Victreebel finds a niche in RBY Ubers thanks to its decent Speed and access to Wrap, dual status moves in Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, and a strong STAB Razor Leaf. Wrap makes it tricky for paralyzed Pokemon to block sleep, as Victreebel can use Wrap on them for free chip damage. Wrap can also make Victreebel dangerous late-game, heavily punishing teams that allow paralysis to spread throughout their Pokemon, as well as teams with many slow Pokemon, such as Snorlax, Chansey, Exeggutor, and Rhydon. Victreebel also enjoys the lower usage Alakazam and Starmie have compared to OU, as outspeeding and paralyzing it is one of the most consistent ways to take it out.</p> <p>However, Victreebel has several flaws that prevent it from being one of the top threats in the metagame. Wrap is only 85% accurate, which is troublesome, since Victreebel often needs to hit Wrap multiple times in a row, and one miss can get Victreebel paralyzed, effectively making it useless. Although its Speed is decent, it is still outsped by Mewtwo, Mew, Tauros, and Zapdos. This generally means Victreebel needs heavy paralysis support to function. Unparalyzed Mewtwo in particular is a terrible matchup for Victreebel, as it threatens both Thunder Wave and STAB Psychic. Mew carries Thunder Wave often, and Tauros threatens Body Slam paralysis. Victreebel is also completely blanked by Gengar, which is immune to Wrap and has a resistance to Razor Leaf. However, Victreebel still is able to threaten all of these Pokemon with status moves. Lastly, Victreebel faces competition from Pokemon like Exeggutor and Chansey as sleepers and from Dragonite as a wrapper.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Victreebel has seen fringe use as a lead, as it outspeeds Exeggutor and Hypno leads while still having access to a reliable way to spread paralysis in Stun Spore, which other fast sleep leads like Jynx and Gengar don't have. However, Victreebel struggles against faster leads such as Jynx, Gengar, Zapdos, and Mewtwo, making this quite niche.</p> <p>Victreebel can opt for a Swords Dance set, generally forgoing Wrap and Razor Leaf for Swords Dance and one of Body Slam or Hyper Beam. This set is able to put a foe to sleep then set up Swords Dance the next turn. If a faster foe, such as Mewtwo, tries to revenge kill this Victreebel set, it can sacrifice itself and use Stun Spore. However, this set is walled by Rhydon and Gengar, and Wrap is a huge part of Victreebel's viability, so it is difficult to justify dropping.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo gives Victreebel immense trouble, dealing a minimum of 73.5% with Psychic and only being 5HKOed in return with Razor Leaf. Many Mewtwo sets also carry Thunder Wave, which ruins Victreebel. Although trading status with Mewtwo is generally a good trade for Victreebel, Mewtwo's 25.39% critical-hit rate as well as Sleep Powder and Stun Spore's poor accuracy means Victreebel can easily be KOed without landing a status move.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Once paralyzed, Victreebel is generally deadweight, as Wrap relies heavily on it outspeeding foes. This makes a Wrap miss fatal against foes with Thunder Wave, such as Chansey. Even if the foe is also paralyzed, a paralyzed Victreebel's Wrap accuracy is effectively 63.75%, which is extremely unreliable considering Wrap needs to hit multiple times in a row.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Since Wrap relies heavily on Victreebel outspeeding a foe, faster Pokemon such as Zapdos, Alakazam, Jynx, Mewtwo, and Mew give Victreebel trouble. Although Victreebel can threaten them with Stun Spore, many faster Pokemon can paralyze Victreebel back, preventing it from taking advantage of Wrap. Although uncommon, Articuno deserves a special mention, as it is great not only against Victreebel but also its common teammates, such as Dragonite and mono-Earthquake Thunder Wave Mew.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Wrap and takes pitiful damage from Razor Leaf, making it a hard counter to Victreebel. However, Gengar hates getting paralyzed by Stun Spore, and Victreebel can still use Wrap to pivot on Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Ice-type moves run rampant in RBY Ubers, which Victreebel does not enjoy. Although it can comfortably wrap foes like Chansey, it has trouble switching in due to the threat of Ice Beam. This also makes Victreebel's matchup with Cloyster quite swingy. Although Victreebel 2HKOes it with Razor Leaf, Cloyster Speed ties with and 2HKOes it in return with Blizzard. Using Wrap on a paralyzed Pokemon like Articuno is also risky, since Victreebel gets hit hard by Blizzard if it misses.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: If Victreebel is running a Swords Dance set that lacks Razor Leaf, it is walled by Rhydon. However, the threat of Razor Leaf means the opponent will not send Rhydon in on Victreebel until all of its moves are revealed. Rhydon can also help PP stall Wrap if necessary thanks to its resistance to the move, though a Wrap miss is bad for Rhydon, since Victreebel can follow up with Razor Leaf.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wrap": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Sleep Powder in conjunction with Wrap makes Victreebel effective at forcing a foe to sleep. If a paralyzed Pokemon attempts to block Victreebel's Sleep Powder, then Victreebel can use Wrap to chip and force out the paralyzed foe and threaten sleep again. Victreebel's ability to push sleep past paralyzed Pokemon allows its teammates to spread paralysis before Victreebel lands Sleep Powder. Stun Spore allows Victreebel to spread paralysis after landing Sleep Powder, which is useful on faster foes such as Tauros and Mew. Razor Leaf lets Victreebel OHKO the Normal-resistant Rhydon and deal massive damage to Water-types, such as Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro. It is also a great tool at damaging neutral targets like Snorlax. Razor Leaf's near-guaranteed critical hit chance means it can bypass the Special boost from Mewtwo and Slowbro's Amnesia as well, although Victreebel should usually only do this if Mewtwo is already paralyzed and at low HP.</p> <p>Victreebel generally has trouble switching in due to a poor defensive typing and fear of getting paralyzed. It most commonly finds entry on a double switch or a predicted recovery turn from Chansey, Mew, or paralyzed Mewtwo. This is still risky, though, as a missed prediction can result in Victreebel taking paralysis or heavy damage. Victreebel's easiest entry point is on a Pokemon using Rest, such as Snorlax or Slowbro. However, Rest on Snorlax is uncommon in Ubers, making this hard to come by. In dire situations, Victreebel can switch directly into Body Slam from Snorlax or Earthquake from Rhydon, but the paralysis chance of the former and heavy damage of the latter make this option a last resort.</p> <p>Victreebel can use Wrap as a pivoting tool, switching out while the foe is immobilized so that Victreebel's teammates can hit the field safely. Though all of Victreebel's teammates appreciate being able to switch for free, those that have good offensive potential but trouble switching into moves, such as Tauros and Rhydon, benefit most heavily from this. Victreebel can also use Wrap's chip damage to get Pokemon into certain ranges for its teammates, such as getting Mewtwo into KO range of Snorlax's Self-Destruct, Water-types such as Starmie and Slowbro into KO range of Victreebel's own Razor Leaf, or Snorlax into KO range of +4 Mewtwo's Psychic.</p> <p>Victreebel's best teammates are those that can spread paralysis throughout an opposing team, as this enables its Wrap antics. Thunder Wave variants of Mew and Mewtwo are great teammates for Victreebel, since their high damage output often forces the opponent's Mew or Mewtwo in, which they can then paralyze. Zapdos is also an effective paralysis spreader, making it a good teammate. Victreebel helps Zapdos against Rhydon; although Victreebel cannot directly switch in, its Razor Leaf threatens Rhydon immensely. Chansey is able to switch into Alakazam, Starmie, and unboosted Mewtwo and threaten paralysis, while Slowbro can switch into Mewtwo sets that lack Thunderbolt. Dragonite can be used with Victreebel for a more Wrap-dedicated teamstyle, allowing Victreebel and Dragonite to enable each other and tear apart paralyzed teams. However, it is important to note that using Victreebel and Dragonite together stacks weaknesses to Ice-type moves, so having teammates that alleviate this is important.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>Golem stands out in RBY Ubers as a Ground-type with access to Explosion. This gives it a significant niche over Rhydon, letting it deal up to 80% to tier king Mewtwo. With unresisted QuakeSlide coverage, it's not just an Explosion that it offers; its coverage helps immensely against Rhydon, Zapdos, Gengar, and Jolteon. With adequate paralysis support, Golem can deal massive damage and blow up on a high-value Pokemon, providing its teammates with incredible momentum. Golem's typing also gives it a valuable Normal resistance and an Electric immunity, helping to check threats like Tauros and Snorlax and soundly beating Zapdos and Jolteon.</p> <p>However, Golem is only favored over Rhydon on offensive teams that look to overwhelm the opponent with Explosion. Rhydon fits on more team styles and offers added consistency that Golem simply canâ€™t muster. Self-Destruct Snorlax and Explosion Mew, while great partners on offensive teams, are also capable of compressing Golem's role while having potential surprise value and allowing for more consistent team options; notably, Snorlax also possesses a stronger self-KO move thanks to STAB. Ergo, the bulkier and harder-hitting Rhydon can often fill Golem's place just fine, 3HKOing Mewtwo with Earthquake, while Golem can only do so inconsistently. Additionally, Rhydon is capable of walling non-Earthquake Mew sets and making 103 HP Substitutes, which can absorb a Seismic Toss from Chansey. Thus, Rhydon is often recommended if Golem's Explosion isn't required. Furthermore, Golem shares all of Rhydon's flaws: it's slow, specially frail, and has common weaknesses to Ice and Water. Without paralysis support, Golem struggles to win consistently in one-on-one battles, which can't always be afforded in the harsh world of RBY Ubers.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>When customizing Golem's set, it's best to replace Rock Slide, Substitute, or Body Slam, but these come with caveats. Removing Rock Slide makes it difficult for Golem to damage Exeggutor and Zapdos, removing Substitute makes it impossible for Golem to set up in front of paralyzed foes, and removing Body Slam leaves Golem without a midground option while becoming more reliant on its team for paralysis. With this in mind, attempts to customize Golem are not recommended.</p> <p>If you must customize Golem, using Defense Curl or Harden isn't terrible, as these allow Golem to consistently wall non-Earthquake Snorlax variants. In the long run, however, this doesn't pan out, as most non-Earthquake Snorlax variants use Reflect + Rest or Amnesia, which overwhelm Golem through sheer longevity and firepower, respectively. Against the latter, Golem is likely to use Explosion anyway, as Amnesia Snorlax threatens severe damage to its team. Outside of this, Fire Blast is plausible for hitting Exeggutor slightly harder when it switches in and potentially burning it, removing the threat of its Explosion, but the risk of thawing a Pokemon and lack of utility outside of this makes it hard to justify.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: While Mewtwo does not appreciate taking Explosionâ€”which is a guaranteed KO after a single Earthquakeâ€”unboosted Psychic 2HKOes Golem and can force Explosion much earlier than desired. If Mewtwo has used Amnesia even once, it must be paralyzed for Golem to do anything. Ice Beam variants completely incapacitate Golem; high damage rolls do enough to even let Zapdos win out. While rare, an unboosted Blizzard from Mewtwo OHKOes Golem half the time. If Mewtwo is paralyzed, however, a single full paralysis lets Golem attempt to 3HKO it with Earthquake, which works a quarter of the time but otherwise leaves Mewtwo easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Thunderbolt + Submission Mewtwo sets actually struggle against Golem, failing to 3HKO it and getting 2HKOed in return by Earthquake + Explosion; thus, it is forced to repeatedly use Recover or switch out. Finally, Barrier Mewtwo completely stops Golem in its tracks, as after a single Defense boost, Earthquake becomes a 6HKO at best, while Explosion deals less than 40%. However, both aforementioned Mewtwo sets are rare.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Users</strong>: Reflect throws a spanner in the works for Golem, swiftly taking a Pokemon out of Explosion KO range; faster Pokemon using Reflect as Golem uses Explosion is particularly depressing. Mew isn't completely incapacitated by an Explosion if it's at full HP and walls Golem if using Reflect sets. If using Earthquake, Mew 3HKOes Golem consistently without having to boost. Golem cannot 3HKO non-Reflect Mew without prior chip damage. Thus, Golem is largely limited to using Explosion and hoping Mew doesn't switch out. Chansey isn't always OHKOed by Explosion, and if it's running Reflect Golem has no hope of winning outside of luck. Moreover, if Chansey is using Ice Beam, it can 2HKO Golem, and this is sometimes run on the same set. Reflect Snorlax is a similarly unfeasible matchup for Golem unless it gets extreme luck, especially if Snorlax is using Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor can switch in on Golem without much fear and put it to sleep. In the event sleep isn't an option, Exeggutor still 2HKOes Golem with Psychic a quarter of the time. However, Exeggutor can't repeatedly switch in on Rock Slide, as it tends to lose out against Seismic Toss users such as Chansey later or otherwise get forced into using Explosion sooner. If Exeggutor is paralyzed and at around half HP, Golem can win with Rock Slide.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Slowbro and the rarer Starmie and Lapras can all OHKO Golem with Surf. However, Slowbro dislikes having Golem switch in on a predicted Rest, as it forces it to Rest stall with repeated Earthquakes by threat of a 4HKO; a single critical hit can mean it loses outright. If Slowbro has set up prior, Earthquake + Explosion is a viable route to dispatch it.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: If Golem takes a super effective hit, it is normally forced into Explosion, which is a less than ideal situation. Mega Drain Exeggutor adores any opportunity to use it against Golem, recovering a minimum of 37.6%. Blizzard users such as Tauros, Jynx, Cloyster, and the rare Dragonite and Articuno also mortally threaten Golem, with the latter even OHKOing it. Tauros can switch in on Golem's Body Slam and threaten a 2HKO with Blizzard. Snorlax may use Blizzard alongside Amnesia to try to sweep, which OHKOes Golem at +2. The rare Victreebel can OHKO Golem with Razor Leaf or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. While it's not likely to win the interaction, Jolteon's Double Kick deals up to 19.8% each time, which can wear Golem down and force an early Explosion.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Explosion": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Earthquake and Rock Slide gives Golem unresisted physical coverage; when factoring in the threat of Explosion, this makes Golem very difficult to switch into. Golem's Earthquake may OHKO Gengar and Jolteon and 2HKOes Alakazam andâ€”rarelyâ€”Chansey. It also serves as Golem's best option against Mewtwo and Mew, 3HKOing Mewtwo about a quarter of the time and 3HKOing Mew if it's taken minor damage prior. Furthermore, just a single Earthquake puts Mewtwo in range for Explosion. Golem has a fair shot at wearing down any non-Ice Beam Mewtwo if it's paralyzed, though it's also 2HKOed by Psychic. Rock Slide potentially OHKOes Jynx and 2HKOes Zapdos, ensuring the latter can be consistently dealt with. It is also Golem's best option against Exeggutor, which likes to switch in on it and threaten with sleep. Substitute can allow Golem to place itself in a favorable position if it can set up against paralyzed foes, such as Mewtwo and Chansey. Alternatively, Body Slam allows Golem to be more self-sufficient in spreading paralysis, which can let it turn the tables on switch-ins.</p> <p>Explosion is Golem's claim to fame and should not be taken lightly. It OHKOes non-Reflect Chansey, Jynx, and Alakazam, as well as Starmie 38% of the time. It also deals up to 80% to Mewtwo and up to 75.9% to Mew. Golem itself holds little value once the opposing team's Electric-type has been removed, so using Explosion to incapacitate Mewtwo or Mew is very desirable. In practice, however, this is very difficult, as the threat of Explosion can be enough to force out Mewtwo and Mew if they're in range. Snorlax and Mew often succeed with their self-KO moves because of their set variety, allowing for more effective bluffs, which Golem cannot afford. Another ideal situation for Explosion is when threatened with an Amnesia Snorlax or Slowbro sweep, as it's one of the only consistent ways to prevent them from sweeping once they set up. Landing Explosion on Chansey can enable Mewtwo, and removing Snorlax can be similarly useful for preventing its powerful early-game offense, but this isn't ideal, as it may leave Golemâ€™s team vulnerable to opposing Electric-types late-game. It's recommended to account for opposing Gengar, Rock-types, and frozen or sleeping Pokemon that can switch in to absorb Explosion. Thus, it may be appropriate to keep Golem unrevealed for extended periods of time, whereas Mew and Snorlax generally don't imply their self-KO moves until they actually use them. As a rule of thumb, using Explosion should be a game of trades; understanding the value that each Pokemon holds to the opposing team is pivotal to succeeding.</p> <p>Golem is best played on offensive teams with multiple self-KO move users, such as Self-Destruct Snorlax, Explosion Mew, and Exeggutor; while prediction-heavy and thus inconsistent, these teams are capable of closing out games very quickly. In other cases, Rhydon tends to outclass Golem and should be looked to first. Golem also pairs well with Water-types like Slowbro and the rarer Starmie and Lapras, which appreciate its Electric immunity. Slowbro notably punishes non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo, and the combination of Slowbro and Golem is capable of muscling past it without compromising your own Mewtwo. However, both are painfully slow, which can be problematic on a poorly built team. Paralysis support is paramount so that the opposition doesn't recover out of KO range, so Pokemon like Chansey, Starmie, Stun Spore Exeggutor, and the aforementioned Slowbro are recommended. Golem tends to hold little value to a team due to its disposable nature, so sacrificing it against sleepers like Exeggutor and Sing Chansey isn't unusual. In fact, against Chansey, it's plausible to cut your losses and have Golem use Explosion in response to a missed Sing, potentially OHKOing it and enabling Mewtwo.</p>"

  "Slowbro": {
    "overview": "<p>In a time where Mewtwo ravaged the RBY Ubers landscape and players desperately searched for a good check to it, Slowbro came to answer the call. Slowbro's Amnesia set, known as \"TobyBro\" and first created by Wintermute in the early 2000s, is the best check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo in the tier while being a very strong Pokemon in its own right. Amnesia, along with a great typing and excellent bulk, gives Slowbro immense sweeping potential. A boosted Surf is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing almost everything in the tier, and even resistant foes are 3HKOed. Amnesia also helps Slowbro patch up its Electric weakness, since Special is used for both offense and defense. Slowbro can even use Thunder Wave to fix its miserable Speed, and it can also reapply the foe's Speed drops from paralysis by using Amnesia.</p> <p>However, Slowbro will take very heavy damage from a critical hit Thunderbolt regardless of boosts, forcing it to use Rest earlier, and many Electric-type Pokemon have very high critical hit rates courtesy of their high Speed. Slowbro's abysmal Speed, while mitigated by Thunder Wave, can give it trouble as it tries to boost against faster threats while also necessitating some amount of paralysis support from teammates. Slowbro is also very one-dimensional and predictable; however, it will always be one of the most dangerous sweepers, no matter how much the opponent might know it is coming.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Slowbro has the option of forgoing Thunder Wave to run any one of the following options. Withdraw is a very strong option to bolster Slowbro's Defense and allow it to take Explosions, removing a prime option for dealing with it. Withdraw also allows Slowbro to reapply paralysis Speed drops more easily. Its massive 61 PP, combined with Rest, allows Slowbro to PP stall almost any Pokemon it needs to, such as opposing Thunder Wave Slowbro. The Defense boost also lets Slowbro counter Snorlax and Mew, which would otherwise be able to hit Slowbro for decent damage. However, Withdraw Slowbro can be very passive, and teams can take advantage of that with faster threats that Slowbro cannot outspeed without Thunder Wave. Reflect is also an option, as an instant +2 in Defense can be crucial in certain situations, such as Snorlax and Tauros needing instant walling as opposed to permitting multiple turns of setup. However, lower PP, an inability to reapply Speed drops, and an inability to boost past +2 make Reflect less desirable.</p> <p>Slowbro can also run two attacks, Surf and either Ice Beam or Psychic. Ice Beam prevents Exeggutor from checking Slowbro and can freeze Mewtwo, Chansey, and opposing Slowbro. On the other hand, Psychic allows Slowbro to hit Lapras and pressure Mewtwo, Starmie, and Light Screen Chansey with Special drops. However, running two attacks makes Slowbro more reliant on paralysis support from teammates to be able to outspeed and threaten certain Pokemon like Tauros and Mew. Two attacks Slowbro also gets PP stalled by Thunder Wave Slowbro. Toxic is a niche option to win mirrors against Withdraw Slowbro, since using Rest does not reset the bad poison timer. Also, Toxic can allow Slowbro to effectively pressure and even remove Light Screen Chansey, which otherwise walls it.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode all carry Thunderbolt, which can stop Slowbro from setting up easily. All three of these Pokemon also have good critical hit rates, and a critical hit Thunderbolt from any of them will OHKO Slowbro outright. However, none of them can switch into a boosted attack, and all three are devastated by paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type coverage</strong>: Non-Electric types like Starmie, Gengar, and Mewtwo can all run Thunderbolt to pressure Slowbro. All three have good critical hit rates, and a critical Thunderbolt can ruin Slowbro. Chansey can also run Thunderbolt, but it is less common; it also has a mediocre critical hit rate, meaning it struggles to pressure Slowbro after it has set up.</p> <p><strong>Water-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Exeggutor and Lapras avoid the 2HKO from +6 Surf and can put Slowbro to sleep with Sleep Powder and Sing, respectively. Lapras also carries Thunderbolt and can deal heavy damage with a critical hit. However, +6 Ice Beam OHKOes Exeggutor, while +2 Ice Beam 2HKOes it, and +4 Psychic 2HKOes Lapras, meaning you must scout for these moves before using these Pokemon to check Slowbro. In a similar vein, Victreebel and Cloyster avoid the OHKO from +6 Surf and can remove Slowbro with Wrap + Razor Leaf or Clamp + Explosion, respectively. However, a single miss of their partial trapping moves can spell doom for either.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen Chansey</strong>: Slowbro cannot 3HKO Chansey after Light Screen with +6 Surf, and it will eventually PP stall Slowbro. However, Slowbro can win the interaction if it gets lucky with a few paralysis turns. Slowbro carrying Toxic also does not fear Light Screen Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Depending on the set, Slowbro can be checked by its other sets. Thunder Wave beats two attacks sets, Withdraw beats any set besides Toxic, and Toxic always beats every other set.</p>",

      "TobyBro (Amnesia)": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Surf is very strong after a few Amnesia boosts, achieving things like a high chance to 2HKO Chansey at +6 and 2HKOs on Mew, Mewtwo, and Snorlax at +4. Amnesia is what makes this set threatening, letting Slowbro become very bulky and very powerful. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to patch up its awful Speed and more effectively threaten faster Pokemon. This is amplified by the threat of Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops. Slowbro can also use paralysis to have a chance at beating its checks, like Light Screen Chansey and Starmie. Rest allows Slowbro to stick around for much longer and ensures that a single critical hit cannot end its sweep. It also protects Slowbro from chip damage, which is likely to accumulate while switching in and boosting with Amnesia. However, a sleeping Slowbro is very easy to take advantage of, and many opponents will use it as a chance to switch in their Explosion user or Thunderbolt Mewtwo.</p> <p>When using Slowbro, it is very important to scout your opponent's team for Electric-type coverage, especially Thunderbolt on Chansey or Mewtwo. However, Chansey very rarely uses Thunderbolt in Ubers, meaning it is usually safe to set up against. Slowbro is very good at setting up against and paralyzing Mewtwo, as it takes very little damage from Mewtwo's attacks even after it has boosted, unless Mewtwo reveals Thunderbolt or gets a critical hit. Either can force Slowbro to repeatedly use Rest and allow Mewtwo to win the interaction with some luck. Slowbro itself is a very good paralysis absorber, since its pitiful Speed means it is not affected much by it. Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops means even a paralyzed Slowbro can outspeed most foes after a few uses of the move. The most common way to remove Slowbro is with Explosion, so users such as Snorlax, Golem, Mew, Exeggutor, and Gengar should be watched carefully. Slowbro should be used with a good absorber of the move, such as Jynx, Rhydon, or your own Golem or Gengar. Absorbing Explosion with these Pokemon requires good prediction on when the foe is about to use the move to switch them in at the right time. Predicting wrong can result in Slowbro getting KOed or the opponent gaining momentum. Alternatively, you can choose to not reveal your Slowbro until later in the game, after the rest of your team has already dealt with opposing Explosion users.</p> <p>Slowbro especially appreciates Rhydon and Golem as Explosion absorbers, since they are immune to the Electric-type moves that give Slowbro so much trouble. However, Rhydon and Slowbro are both very slow, so using them together requires extra care. If your chosen strategy is to deal with Explosion users before revealing Slowbro, other Pokemon that attract the move such as Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo can be used. Slowbro can struggle to beat certain checks such as Exeggutor and Lapras, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as BoltBeam Chansey, are appreciated.</p>"

  "Cloyster": {
    "overview": "<p>Cloyster holds a niche in Ubers thanks to its combination of unique traits; it has fantastic physical bulk, letting it tank Snorlax's Self-Destruct, Mew's +2 Earthquake, and Tauros's Hyper Beam with relative comfort. Its Ice typing gives it a powerful STAB Blizzard as well as an immunity to freeze. It also has access to the mighty Explosion, a potent tool in Ubers, and its signature move Clamp can choke down slower foes and provide free switches for its teammates.</p> <p>However, Cloyster is weighed down by multiple detrimental traits that prevent it from being a true oppressive force in Ubers. Its matchup into unparalyzed Mewtwo is horrendous, only 5HKOing it with Blizzard while being 2HKOed by Psychic and Thunderbolt in return, letting Mewtwo switch in with little risk. It can't reliably switch into the physical attackers it wants to tank hits from, as it becomes much worse if it is paralyzed by Body Slam or Thunder Wave. Cloyster also finds it difficult to heal off the damage it takes, as its only way of healing is Rest, which forces it into complete passivity for two turns. Cloyster also relies on heavy paralysis support to effectively use Clamp and Explosion due to its mediocre Speed and weakness to special moves.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Hyper Beam can be used in place of Rest, as it allows Cloyster to finish off weakened Chansey and Ice-resistant foes. However, this leaves Cloyster completely unable to switch into physical attackers, as paralysis will permanently ruin it. Ice Beam has double the PP of Blizzard and better accuracy. However, it is significantly weaker than Blizzard, failing nearly every important KO range. Although incredibly niche, Reflect can replace Explosion to make Cloyster better into Mew and Snorlax, with Cloyster taking a paltry 30.6% maximum from Mew's +6 Earthquake and only 37.9% maximum from Snorlax's Self-Destruct. However, lacking Explosion leaves Cloyster much less threatening and much easier to answer, and physical attackers will usually just switch to a Water-type or Mewtwo to answer Cloyster, usually rendering Reflect useless.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Starmie, Slowbro, and Lapras switch into Cloyster with minimal risk and threaten it back with heavy damage or paralysis. However, Slowbro and Starmie have to worry about getting frozen, and all of them take heavy damage from Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outspeeds and 2HKOes Cloyster with Psychic or Thunderbolt, while it's only 5HKOed in return by Blizzard, though it must be wary of being frozen. Mewtwo becomes much worse at switching into Cloyster if it's paralyzed, as Cloyster can choke it down or pivot to a teammate with Clamp; it can also do heavy damage to it with Explosion while also preventing Recover that turn.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Cloyster despises paralysis, as it relies on its Speed and cannot afford to lose turns to full paralysis. Paralysis also makes Cloyster's chance of hitting Clamp a mere 56.25%. Cloyster's only means of removing paralysis is Rest, which is difficult to pull off successfully. This makes switching into Body Slam extremely risky.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Zapdos and Jolteon both outspeed and 2HKO Cloyster with Thunderbolt, with Zapdos even having a 23.1% chance to OHKO it. However, the former is 2HKOed by Blizzard and the latter is 3HKOed, so they cannot switch into Cloyster well.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can switch into Cloyster with ease, taking a mere 18.9% maximum from Blizzard and threatening it with paralysis and a 4HKO from Seismic Toss. However, Chansey has to be wary freeze as well as Explosion, as it is OHKOed by the move 74.4% of the time. Chansey is also quite passive and cannot do much to threaten Cloyster's team beyond using Thunder Wave. Cloyster can also choose to pivot out with Clamp, which denies Chansey the chance to recover HP or paralyze anything and can result in it slowly getting worn down over time.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: While Gengar cannot switch into Cloyster's Blizzard well, as it is 3HKOed 30.8% of the time, it 2HKOes Cloyster with Thunderbolt and can absorb Cloyster's Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Jynx</strong>: Jynx outspeeds Cloyster and 3HKOes it with Psychic, while Cloyster's Blizzard only 6HKOes in return, but Cloyster's Explosion OHKOes Jynx. However, this is often a bad trade for the Cloyster user.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blizzard is Cloyster's primary attacking option, OHKOing Rhydon 33.3% of the time, 2HKOing Exeggutor and Zapdos, and 3HKOing Tauros. Clamp can provide free switches for Cloyster's teammates. It can also be used to whittle down slower foes into KO range from another attack, but this is unreliable due to its poor accuracy. Explosion allows Cloyster to take out or do heavy damage to a foe, OHKOing frailer foes such as Alakazam and Chansey 74.4% of the time and doing a hefty chunk to bulkier foes, such as doing 60% minimum to Snorlax and 62.1% minimum to Mewtwo. Explosion also has the benefit of prematurely ending the turn, which can deny recovery on slower foes. Rest increases Cloyster's longevity and clears paralysis, but it is left completely helpless for two turns and cannot regain its Speed until it switches out, allowing Pokemon that threaten it, such as Mewtwo, Starmie, and Zapdos, to switch in and fire off strong attacks or set up.</p> <p>Cloyster necessitates paralysis support to function, so Thunder Wave Mewtwo and Mew make great partners, as they can spread paralysis across the opposing team, particularly to the opposing Mewtwo and Mew. Chansey is also good at spreading paralysis to support Cloyster, and it is a good switch-in to the special attackers Cloyster is afraid of, such as Mewtwo, Starmie, and Alakazam. Rhydon can make a good teammate, as it walls Zapdos and Jolteon, which both threaten Cloyster immensely; Cloyster also switches into Tauros's Earthquake and Blizzard well to support Rhydon. Rhydonâ€”much like Cloysterâ€”also benefits heavily from spreading paralysis across the opposing team. Cloyster can be paired with other Explosion and Self-Destruct users such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, Explosion Mew, and Self-Destruct Mewtwo to attempt to overwhelm the opponent and trade down Pokemon until a strong sweeper, such as Zapdos or Tauros, can win the game. Cloyster should be kept hidden until the opponent's Mewtwo is paralyzed, as once it is, Cloyster becomes far more offensively threatening. Cloyster should only use Rest if it absolutely needs to, as waking up is incredibly difficult.</p>"

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Gengar possesses the best Speed of any sleeper in the game, a unique Normal immunity, and the coveted Explosion. It outpaces relevant threats like Jynx, Mew, and Zapdos, allowing it to cripple them with Hypnosis before they can threaten it in return. Gengar's Normal immunity carries substantial utility, letting it absorb the plentiful Explosions in the metagame for free and walling Mew and Snorlax sets carrying only Normal-type moves. Additionally, it can come in handy against Persian and Wrap users like Dragonite and Victreebel, though these Pokemon do not see much use. Gengar can use its own Explosion, armed with a fearsome 21.47% critical hit rate, to significantly damage anything that is not Rock- or Ghost-type, making problematic foes simpler to dispatch and enabling offensive teammates like Mewtwo to make progress. Aside from this, Gengar packs Night Shade to do decent, consistent damage to all Pokemon and a powerful Thunderbolt to threaten Water-types like Slowbro.</p> <p>Gengar is hindered by its inconsistencyâ€”it has to rely on Hypnosis's low accuracy, and this is exacerbated by its poor physical bulk and unfortunate weaknesses to Psychic and Ground. Moreover, while Gengar is immune to Body Slam and thus its paralysis chance, other moves like Thunder Wave and Stun Spore can still cripple it, preventing it from outpacing naturally slower Pokemon and paralyzed Mewtwo and threatening them with Explosion. After Gengar gets off sleep, it can't do much to Rhydon and Golem unless it decides to drop a move for the otherwise useless Mega Drain, and it needs Explosion to threaten many other relevant Pokemon like Exeggutor, Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo. These flaws do not outweigh Gengar's unique utilities, however, and it is a solid pick on an RBY Ubers team.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Gengar's other moves are all niche at best. Mega Drain 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and restores some of its HP, but this move has no use otherwise, and they OHKO it with their Earthquakes, so it needs to hit them on a predicted switch-in. Confuse Ray might seem like an appealing option for paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo, as it further reduces their chances of threatening Gengar or healing off damage. Unfortunately, confusion is unreliable, it wears off after a few turns, and it can be removed by switching out. Moreover, Mew and Mewtwo can deal major damage to Gengar or cripple it with paralysis if they manage to hit it regardless. Seismic Toss has greater PP than Night Shade, but it isn't preferable, as it is subject to Counter and Gengar's lack of recovery means its PP advantage will not realistically matter.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis prevents Gengar from outspeeding naturally slower Pokemon and, importantly, paralyzed Mewtwo, making it more difficult to threaten with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Exeggutor</strong>: Alakazam and Exeggutor threaten 2HKOs on Gengar with Psychic, and they can cripple it with their status moves. Alakazam, particularly, is faster than Gengar, has Recover to shrug off Night Shade and Thunderbolt, and is fine with being sacked to Hypnosis. Exeggutor generally does not run a recovery move, and, although Night Shade only 4HKOes it, it doesn't appreciate the damage regardless, as it pressures it into using Explosion sooner.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: These Pokemon both OHKO Gengar and take little damage from all of its moves, aside from the niche Mega Drain. Rhydon's Substitutes survive a Night Shade, so it can set up on it. On the other hand, they would prefer not to take damage if it is not necessary, as their only option for recovery is Rest, and Golem is pressured into using Explosion earlier.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros shares its Speed with Gengar and 2HKOes it with Earthquake, with a solid critical hit rate backing it up. The two usually interact as leads, so Gengar can try to nullify it as a threat with Hypnosis, but this is dangerous, and Tauros doesn't mind taking sleep for its teammates. If sleeping Tauros is not possible, Gengar's next best option for it is Thunderbolt, which only 4HKOes.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Like Tauros, Snorlax 2HKOes Gengar with its Earthquake, but Gengar's Thunderbolt only 5HKOes it. However, Snorlax does not want to take its Explosion or be put to sleep by Hypnosis, or take chip damage in the event it is not running Rest.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew can use any of Earthquake, Thunder Wave, and Psychic to threaten Gengar, but it's outsped and it despises Hypnosis. Explosion is a major threat for it, too, as a critical hit can OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outpaces Gengar and OHKOes it with Psychic after an Amnesia boost or with a critical hit. Mewtwo must keep away from Hypnosis at all costs, though, and it wants to avoid Gengar if it is paralyzed: Explosion will more likely than not OHKO it on a critical hit, and a regular hit is still liable to leave Mewtwo in range for other Pokemon to finish it off.</p>",

      "Sleeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Hypnosis renders a foe almost useless. Night Shade deals consistent damage, and it's Gengar's best option against Exeggutor and Jolteon. Thunderbolt 2HKOes Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro. If Slowbro has boosted its Special, Gengar can switch in on its Rest and fish for a critical hit OHKO with it. Thunderbolt deals more damage to Tauros and Snorlax than Night Shade can, and a critical hit also deals more damage to Mew. Explosion lets Gengar remain relevant after it lands sleep, threatening sizable damage, preventing the victim from recovering if it is slower, and allowing one of its teammates to switch in for free and finish the victim off. A critical hit can notably OHKO Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Gengar is usually used as a lead, possessing favorable matchups against Exeggutor and the rare Jynx. However, Gengar stands to take severe damage from their super effective STAB Psychics or get crippled with status itself if it misses Hypnosis. It can avoid this risk against Jynx specifically by trading for it with Explosion. If paired with a backup sleeper, this can give Gengar's team room to get sleep off on a more valuable target. Explosion is generally not preferable over putting Jynx to sleep, though, as it means the team can't wall Mew or Snorlax carrying only Normal-type moves and absorb Explosions, and it can leave a more valuable teammate at risk of taking sleep itself. Gengar has worse prospects against other leadsâ€”Tauros is the most common in the metagame, and, although they share the same Speed, Tauros always carries Earthquake, which 2HKOes Gengar, or OHKOes it in the significantly likely event of a critical hit. Faster paralysis leads like Starmie and Alakazam scare Gengar out with the threat of Thunder Wave or a critical hit Psychic. If Gengar gets off Hypnosis, it can apply pressure with Night Shade or switch to a teammate that can scare the sleeping foe out. Sacking Gengar to sleep when facing a sleeper can be a wise choiceâ€”it can still take advantage of its Normal immunity asleep, and its good Speed means it is more likely to be useful if it wakes up later in the game. It should be noted that Gengar's presence on a team can dissuade opponents from using moves like Body Slam and Explosion. This can make predicting these moves and switching it in risky, as many Pokemon using these moves also have the coverage moves necessary to hit it for severe damage.</p> <p>Gengar's Explosion can help its partners make progress against the opposing team, but there a few points to consider before using it. First of all, the opponent's movesets on Mew and Snorlax should be scouted beforehand; if they carry only Normal-type moves, sacrificing Gengar makes them much more threatening. It is also important to check for any Ghost- or Rock-types such as other Gengar, Rhydon, and Golem, as they can render Explosion useless by switching in on it. Even if these Pokemon aren't present, sleeping or frozen Pokemon are often used to take Explosion, as they are not likely to be useful otherwise.</p> <p>Gengar appreciates backup sleepers to compensate for its unreliability. Exeggutor pairs well with it thanks to its resistances to Ground and Psychic and fair bulk. It can switch into Earthquake from lead Tauros and land sleep in Gengar's stead, while Gengar can break through certain threats Exeggutor has trouble with, like Slowbro and Starmie. Sing Chansey and Jynx take little damage from Psychic and can block sleep moves from the opposing team if they get paralyzed on the switch. In addition, they have Ice-type coverage to hit the Pokemon that wall Gengar. Chansey has instant recovery and Thunder Wave, letting it remain useful throughout the game, while Jynx is the next fastest sleeper after Gengar. They benefit from Gengar's immunity to Normal, especially Jynx, as its reliance on Rest for recovery can lure in physical threats like Mew and Snorlax. Offensive threats often work well alongside Gengar. Slowbro is another Pokemon that resists Psychic, and it OHKOes Rhydon and Golem with its unboosted Surf. It profits nicely from having Gengar as a teammate, as it tends to draw in Explosions and has difficulties dealing with other Water-types. Articuno and Zapdos are immune to Ground, and Gengar's immunity to Body Slam gives them room to come in safely through double switching. Articuno blasts through Rhydon and Golem, while Zapdos performs better against Chansey and has Thunder Wave to paralyze Pokemon that switch into it, like Mewtwo. Tauros can clean up foes that are put to sleep by Hypnosis and threaten anything that walls Gengar. In return, Gengar's Explosion can put Pokemon in its KO range and provide it an opportunity to switch in.</p>"

  "Hypno": {
    "overview": "<p>Hypno holds a niche in the tier as the fastest viable Pokemon that has access to both a sleep-inducing move and a paralysis-spreading move. This allows Hypno to outspeed and put Exeggutor to sleep with Hypnosis as well as paralyze faster foes such as Tauros, Gengar, and Zapdos and attempt to brute-force them with STAB Psychic. Hypno's biggest strength is its role compression, being a jack-of-all-trades lead that covers many matchups at least neutrally, with Thunder Wave being one of the main reasons to use it over Jynx. Thunder Wave even gives Hypno a slight edge over Exeggutor, which has to use the inaccurate Stun Spore; Submission also gives it a better time against Chansey. Hypno has decent bulk, being able to survive a couple stray hits from foes such as Tauros and Zapdos with relative ease. Hypno's mono-Psychic typing also grants it no common weaknesses, unlike Exeggutor, which has weaknesses to Jynx and Mewtwo's Blizzard and Zapdos' Drill Peck. It also has much better physical bulk than Jynx, which is incredibly physically frail.</p> <p>While Hypno does fill many roles decently, it fails to do any of these roles particularly well: it's fast enough to outspeed Exeggutor and Lapras but not fast enough to outspeed any other relevant threats, being outsped and completely shut down by Jynx. It's bulky enough to tank a few hits from foes such as Tauros and Zapdos, but it has little staying power due to its lack of recovery. Hypno also has to rely on Hypnosis to put something to sleep, making it somewhat unreliable in getting sleep off. Hypno has heavy competition as a Psychic-type lead, with Exeggutor being the objectively better sleeper, Jynx being faster than it and having STAB Blizzard, and Alakazam and Starmie having Recover. Finally, while Hypno has effectively no weaknesses, it also lacks many of the resistances that Exeggutor has, taking neutral damage from Rhydon's Earthquake, Gengar's Thunderbolt, and Slowbro and Starmie's Surf, making it much worse at switching into those threats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Meditate can be used in place of Psychic to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis and make Hypno's Submission more powerful, with +1 Submission 2HKOing Chansey and +2 Submission 2HKOing Snorlax 75.4% of the time. However, this set is walled by Gengar and does next to nothing to opposing Psychic-types such as Exeggutor and Mewtwo. Headbutt can be used over Submission on Meditate sets to attempt to paraflinch foes. Headbutt also has higher accuracy than Submission and does more than Submission to Psychic-types but does much less to Chansey and Snorlax and is incredibly unreliable due to only having a 47.5% chance to immobilize a paralyzed foe with Headbutt. Rest can be used in Hypno's fourth moveslot to try and stall out Chansey, Alakazam, and Exeggutor if Sleep Clause is activated, but this is easily exploitable, as Hypno is extremely vulnerable during its sleep turns, becoming setup fodder for Mewtwo, Mew, and Slowbro. Psychic can be dropped in favor of running Submission and Seismic Toss on the same set, as it deals with common Chansey and Exeggutor variants within the same build. It also forces Psychic-types with Rest to use Rest more predictably, which can provide safer switch-in opportunities for Hypno's teammates, although it has a much worse time against Gengar, Tauros, and Zapdos.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Faster Sleepers</strong>: Jynx and Gengar both outspeed and put Hypno to sleep with relative ease, with Jynx having the opportunity to attempt to freeze something with Blizzard as Hypno switches out. Gengar is less reliable at putting Hypno to sleep than Jynx, and it can be paralyzed and 2HKOed by Psychic if it misses Hypnosis, but it nevertheless is still favored to beat Hypno.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Recovery</strong>: Pokemon with recovery moves, such as Alakazam, Starmie, Mew, and Mewtwo, sit on Hypno and exploit its lack of recovery to KO it with ease. However, these Pokemon hate paralysis and will usually avoid a one-on-one interaction with Hypno. Chansey also checks Hypno if it lacks Submission.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Most physical attackers beat Hypno one-on-one, such as Snorlax and Mew if Sleep Clause is activated and Tauros if Hypno lacks Counter.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types with Rest</strong>: Slowbro can switch into Hypno with ease if Sleep Clause is activated, set up on it with Amnesia or paralyze it, and shrug off damage with Rest. Jynx outspeeds Hypno and 3HKOes it with Blizzard, Exeggutor with Rest also walls Hypno, although it can't do much damage to Hypno in return. Opposing Hypno with Rest also walls Hypno without Rest. Slowbro, Jynx, Exeggutor, and Hypno all avoid 3HKOes from Seismic Toss Hypno, letting them Rest loop Hypno and stall it out. However, these Rests are easy to exploit by Hypno switching out as the Rest Psychic-type sleeps.</p>",

      "Lead Sleeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Psychic is Hypno's main STAB move, notably 2HKOing Gengar while also doing decent damage to other common leads such as Tauros and Zapdos. Hypnosis is Hypno's only sleep-inducing move, letting it put foes to sleep and notably doing so before Exeggutor can do the same to Hypno. However, it is quite unreliable due to its low accuracy, and Hypno would rather paralyze most faster foes such as Tauros and Gengar with Thunder Wave and attempt to KO them with Psychic. Thunder Wave is a pivotal tool for Hypno, letting it come out victorious in many situations it may not have otherwise. For example, if Gengar misses its Hypnosis, Hypno can paralyze it and 2HKO it with Psychic, while Gengar is either forced to switch out, use Explosion, or attempt to land a second Hypnosis through paralysis, which only hits 44.8% of the time. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage to all foes, notably 4HKOing Exeggutor and Jynx, while Psychic and Submission do paltry damage to them. Submission 3HKOes Chansey, which switches into Hypno with ease if it lacks the move. The recoil from Submission can also be used in your favor, as Hypno can use it to knock itself out before Chansey can heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled, making it easily revenge killed by one of Hypno's teammates such as Snorlax or Tauros. Counter can be used to help against Tauros, as a countered Body Slam followed by a Psychic KOes it, letting Hypno beat Tauros in the one-on-one if it attacks with Body Slam, which Hypno can fail to do without Counter. It's worth noting that Tauros can still beat Hypno with Counter if it goes for Earthquake or flinches it with Stomp. Hypno without Counter also benefits from the mere threat of Counter, with Tauros being wary of using Body Slam on it. A Hypno with a Defense stat of 154 can OHKO Tauros with a countered Body Slam; this is achieved with a Defense DV of 1 and 29 IVs, although a critical hit Body Slam has a 59% chance to OHKO a Hypno with 154 Defense, and Earthquake followed by Hyper Beam KOes Hypno with this reduction in bulk. Hypno is the best anti-lead against lead Mewtwo and also a good anti-lead against the uncommon lead Lapras. Jynx is also a good anti-lead to Mewtwo, but it is OHKOed by Mewtwo's Self-Destruct and 2HKOed by the very rare Fire Blast.</p>"

  "Exeggutor": {
    "overview": "<p>Exeggutor is arguably the most reliable sleeper in RBY Ubers. Its relatively accurate Sleep Powder and good stats mean it will almost always manage to put a foe to sleep. This, alongside Stun Spore, allows Exeggutor to provide incredible team support that facilitates strong sweepers like Slowbro and Mewtwo. Exeggutor also has access to Explosion, meaning it will always pose a threat even after it has finished spreading its status, effectively making it a two-for-one in an ideal scenario. Exeggutor's stats are very well-rounded, boasting excellent bulk that allows it to check threats such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Mew under the right conditions. It can even check Mewtwo not carrying an Ice-type move. Moreover, Exeggutor's niche is unique, as no other Pokemon has the combination of a sleep move, a paralysis move, and Explosion. Exeggutor also hits very hard and can effectively pressure foes such as paralyzed Pokemon, Snorlax, and Chansey with Special drops from Psychic.</p> <p>However, Exeggutor does have a few flaws. It is forced out by strong Ice-type attackers such as Jynx, Cloyster, Articuno, and Lapras, as well as Mewtwo if it is carrying Ice Beam or Blizzard. Exeggutor's lack of coverage means it is reliant on Psychic and Explosion to deal damage, causing it to struggle to damage other Psychic-types and Chansey without using Explosion. Exeggutor is also very slow for Ubers, and it will usually take a hit before it can do anything, often forcing it to use Explosion earlier than it would like to. Also, Exeggutor lacks any kind of recovery, and players must be aware of the risks of switching Exeggutor in against attacks like Tauros's Body Slam.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Stun Spore can be replaced by a number of options. Double-Edge can damage Psychic-types like Jynx and Alakazam more reliably. However, Double-Edge's recoil causes Exeggutor to be chipped down even faster, meaning it will likely use Explosion earlier than desired. Mega Drain is an option to 2HKO Rhydon and Golem while also healing Exeggutor a little bit. However, Exeggutor already has a favorable matchup against the two, and Psychic is usually sufficient to handle them. Mega Drain also makes Exeggutor a good Starmie check, especially if Starmie lacks Blizzard. Even if Starmie uses Blizzard, Mega Drain can stop a paralyzed Starmie from absorbing Sleep Powder and prevents Starmie from staying in after it is put to sleep. Hyper Beam is useful for certain ranges where foes might take another Psychic but aren't worth using Explosion on. However, using Hyper Beam requires good prediction and calculations, as failing to KO will result in Exeggutor being forced out or revenge killed. Rest may seem good to provide Exeggutor with semi-reliable recovery; however, it is very easy to pressure a sleeping Exeggutor with strong attacks, and finding opportunities to wake up is a difficult prospect. Being asleep also makes it more likely that Exeggutor will faint before it has a chance to use Explosion. Furthermore, a sleeping Exeggutor is a prime opportunity for setup sweepers such as Mewtwo and Slowbro to come in and wreak havoc.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type attacks</strong>: Exeggutor's weakness to Ice means it is afraid of the common moves Ice Beam and Blizzard, especially STAB Blizzard from Jynx, Articuno, Lapras, and Cloyster, as well as coverage moves from Chansey, Mewtwo, and Starmie. Any of these Pokemon can force Exeggutor to switch out or take massive damage. Notably, any critical hit STAB Blizzard will OHKO Exeggutor.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggutor's lack of coverage options means it often cannot do much to Psychic-types after it has statused them. Against Alakazam, Slowbro, Jynx, Mew, Mewtwo, or opposing Exeggutor, Exeggutor will be forced to switch out or use Explosion earlier than it would like to. Alakazam also has Seismic Toss to quickly rack up damage, which usually cannot be recovered. Moreover, these Pokemon make fantastic sleep blockers if they are paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Because it uses its great bulk to switch in often, Exeggutor is very prone to getting worn down by chip damage to the point where it can no longer switch in. Exeggutor's low Speed compounds this issue, as it will usually be forced to take two hits before it can attack whenever it switches in.</p> <p><strong>Ice Beam Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo carrying Ice Beam or Blizzard can lure in Exeggutor and OHKO it with +4 Ice Beam or +2 Blizzard. For this reason, scouting Mewtwo's set beforehand is very important.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey reliably switches into Exeggutor and threatens it in a variety of ways in return. However, Chansey is likely to be OHKOed by Explosion and does not want to be put to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Exeggutor and can outright OHKO with a critical hit from Drill Peck. However, Zapdos hates being statused, and takes sizable damage from Psychic, so it cannot switch in safely.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Sleep Powder allows Exeggutor to disable a foe for a large portion of the game, creating opportunities for its teammates, particularly the tier king Mewtwo. Stun Spore allows Exeggutor and slower teammates to make more progress against faster foes such as Mew, Tauros, and Zapdos. Psychic hits Pokemon like Tauros, Rhydon, and Snorlax for solid damage, which can quickly turn into 2HKOs or 3HKOs with Special drops. Explosion makes sure Exeggutor will be useful at every stage of the game, always applying immense pressure even if Exeggutor is at low HP or paralyzed. Explosion should be used to remove Chansey and Alakazam and deal heavy damage to Mewtwo, allowing a teammate to come in and revenge kill.</p> <p>Exeggutor should be paired with teammates that appreciate the status it spreads. Setup sweepers like Amnesia Mewtwo, Amnesia Slowbro, and Swords Dance Mew can take full advantage of a sleeping foe. Slow, powerful attackers such as Rhydon, Snorlax, Golem, Slowbro, and, to some extent, Articuno enjoy having faster foes paralyzed by Stun Spore. Rhydon, in particular, greatly appreciates having its foes paralyzed, as this can sometimes allow it to use Substitute for free. Exeggutor can also paralyze and use Explosion against Mewtwo, opening an easy path for a teammate such as Snorlax or Tauros to KO it. This will make it much easier for your own Mewtwo to sweep with Amnesia later on. Zapdos is a particularly good teammate with Exeggutor, which handles Rhydon very well and induces sleep uncontested. Note that Exeggutor's generally good matchup against Rhydon is no longer safe after taking two Rock Slides while switching in.</p> <p>Exeggutor makes a decent lead because it can consistently put a foe to sleep on turn 1. Lead Exeggutor has a particularly good matchup against lead Tauros, as it can tank any hit from Tauros and easily put it to sleep. Against lead Gengar, Exeggutor can be used as sleep fodder; and against lead Jynx, it can simply use Explosion to remove it so long as Jynx misses Lovely Kiss. However, sacrificing Exeggutor too early could cause troubles later in the game when Mewtwo or another threat may need checking. Lead Exeggutor also has a poor matchup against other sleep leads. When using Exeggutor, it is important to not mindlessly use Thunder Wave or Stun Spore early game, as skilled opponents will switch in their Exeggutor check to absorb the paralysis, creating a sleep blocker. Exeggutor's lack of recovery means it should be on the lookout for safe ways to switch in, such as against the various users of Rest and Recover on the turns they heal. Such users include Snorlax, Mewtwo, and Alakazam. Exeggutor can also switch in against moves it resists, such as Psychic and Rhydon's and Tauros's Earthquake. Exeggutor should always be looking for opportunities to safely use Explosion and scouting for anything that could prevent it from doing so. Experienced players will be able to predict Explosion the majority of the time and will switch in their Rock-type, Gengar, or other fodder to absorb it. If Exeggutor faints before using Explosion, much of its utility and potential momentum is wasted. This mandates scouting for Ice Beam or Blizzard on opposing Mewtwo.</p>"

Its STAB Earthquake is the most powerful unboosted physical attack without a downside 2HKOing Chansey and 3HKOing tier titans Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax. Rhydon is incredible at threatening paralyzed teams and is very difficult to switch into. It's no slouch defensively either; its typing lets it wall Zapdos and Jolteon as well as Mew and Snorlax that drop Earthquake. Rhydon is also immune to Thunder Wave, which makes it much harder to paralyze reliably. Its typing also gives it a Normal resistance, which allows it to absorb Explosion for other team members and switch into Hyper Beam to force a recharge turn while taking minimal damage. Rhydon's outstanding HP stat ensures its Substitute survives a Seismic Toss from Chansey, further improving its matchup against it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon is held back by it necessitating paralysis support to function effectively, as its abysmal Speed leaves it outpaced by all viable Pokemon except for Slowbro and Snorlax. This, by extension, means it despises being paralyzed itself; though it's immune to Thunder Wave, it can still be threatened with Stun Spore and Body Slam. Rhydon's low Speed, alongside its poor special bulk and weaknesses to common attacking types such as Ice and Ground, means it will have trouble in most one-on-one matchups without paralysis support. To further worsen this issue, Rhydon only has Rest for recovery, which forces it into passivity for two turns and invites in threats that can apply pressure on it or set up, such as Mewtwo and Slowbro.</p> <p>Rhydon competes with Golem for a team slot due to Golem's access to the mighty Explosion, which also prevents slower Pokemon from recovering and gives opportunities for teammates to switch in. This isn't the only advantage it has to offer; it has slightly higher Speed and 2HKOes Rhydon with Earthquake, giving it the edge one-on-one. However, it lacks Rhydon's remarkable Attack stat, which prevents it from reaching key damage ranges that Rhydon can; for example, Golem 4HKOes Mewtwo, Mew, and Snorlax and is unlikely to 2HKO Chansey, while Rhydon 3HKOes the first three and always 2HKOes Chansey. Golem's Substitute is also unable to survive a Seismic Toss from Chansey. Moreover, Golem's worse physical bulk and lack of access to a Defense-lowering move make it inferior against Mew. Because of these problems, Rhydon is the superior choice on many competitive teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon has few other usable moves to its name, and they are difficult to fit on a moveset. Fire Blast is an arguable option thanks to its 30% burn chance, which lets Rhydon cripple Exeggutor and Mew on the switch. While Mew is able to use Swords Dance to remove the Attack penalty, boosting moves from Rhydon's teammates, such as Amnesia from Mewtwo, will reapply the stat drop, keeping its physical attacks ineffective for the rest of the game. However, Fire Blast is inconsistent, relies on its surprise factor to be successful, and carries the risk of burning foes such as Mewtwo and Starmie. Stomp's flinch chance can come in handy against paralyzed foes, as they will only have a 52.4% chance to move. However, it's unreliable, and even with Rhydon's mammoth Attack stat it's incredibly weak.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor possesses solid bulk and a rare resistance to Ground-type moves alongside a neutrality to Rock, making it one of the best Rhydon switch-ins in the game. Once it's on the field, it can threaten Rhydon with paralysis and sleepâ€”even if Rhydon is behind a Substituteâ€”or deal major damage with Psychic. Rhydon can only 5HKO it in return with Body Slam or 4HKO it with Rock Slide. That being said, it can threaten paralysis on Exeggutor with the former, preventing it from reliably checking Rhydon later on.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo outpaces Rhydon and 2HKOes it with Psychic and Ice Beam, while Rhydon can only 3HKO back with Earthquake. Mewtwo also has Recover to heal off any damage. Moreover, it packs Amnesia and a superb 25.39% critical hit rate, so Rhydon is at risk even if it is at full HP. Rhydon can try to paralyze Mewtwo as it switches in with Body Slam, making it easier for it and other physical attackers to pressure it. Afterwards, it can use Substitute to fish for a full paralysis turn and then apply pressure with Earthquake if it succeeds. A paralyzed Mewtwo is also much worse at switching into Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Although Rhydon is difficult to paralyze reliably thanks to its Thunder Wave immunity, it can no longer outspeed paralyzed Pokemon after it is paralyzed itself, severely hindering its offensive potential. If Rhydon has Leer, it can outspeed faster paralyzed Pokemon via reapplying the paralysis Speed drop, giving it another option, but remaining unparalyzed is still preferable by far. Rhydon can be paralyzed by Stun Spore from Exeggutor and Victreebel or Body Slam from Pokemon like Mew and Snorlax.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon</strong>: Cloyster, Articuno, and Lapras all outspeed Rhydon and OHKO it reliably with Blizzard except for Cloyster, which still manages to do so a third of the time. Lapras can use Sing, which bypasses Rhydon's Substitute and lets it try to put Rhydon or a switch-in to sleep, while Cloyster comes with Clamp, which destroys Rhydon's Substitute and prevents it from moving on the same turn. Rock Slide is a worry for these Pokemonâ€”especially Articuno, which it OHKOesâ€”but if Rhydon lacks it, they all make serviceable switch-ins, though they do not like being paralyzed by Body Slam. Jynx is another Pokemon that outspeeds and usually OHKOes Rhydon with Blizzard, but it's very difficult for it to switch in, as it is incredibly physically frail.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew has multiple effective moves against Rhydon at its disposal, 3HKOing it with Earthquake and the rare Psychic or 2HKOing it with the equally rare Ice Beam. It very frequently runs Swords Dance too, allowing it to 2HKO with Earthquake at +2 or OHKO it half the time at +4. Mew also has Soft-Boiled to remove any damage it takes in the process and Reflect to significantly reduce the effectiveness of Rhydon's attacking moves. However, it's not an ideal check; Rhydon can 3HKO Mew with Earthquake and is able to threaten it much more effectively if it is paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros has a staggering 21.47% critical hit chance as well as coverage moves in Blizzard and Earthquake that 2HKO and 3HKO Rhydon respectively, but Rhydon does significant damage to it with Earthquake, which it has no way to heal off, so it's limited as an answer. If Tauros lacks Blizzard, it becomes a much worse switch-in to Rhydon, as it cannot switch in and wi without a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Most of the time, Rhydon will only 3HKO Starmie with Earthquake, and Starmie threatens it with an OHKO with Surf or a 2HKO with Blizzard backed by a 22.46% critical hit rate along with the chance to freeze. Starmie's access to Recover might make it seem like an appealing switch-in, but it runs the risk of being paralyzed by Body Slam, which badly cripples it.</p> <p><strong>Reflect Snorlax</strong>: The uncommon Reflect Snorlax is capable of 3HKOing Rhydon with Earthquake and breaking its Substitute with Self-Destruct, and it walls Rhydon fairly reliably after it sets up Reflect. Snorlax can also paralyze Rhydon with Body Slam, forcing it to use Rest to regain its Speed. Being outsped is a major problem for Snorlax, though; Rhydon 3HKOes it with Earthquake until it sets up. Another issue is that Rhydon can run Leer, which can negate Snorlax's Defense boost while it is sleeping. Even if it doesn't, Rhydon can potentially break through it if it gets a single critical hit, which it has many chances to fish for. Snorlax also has to be wary of giving Mewtwo free setup turns as it is sleeping.</p> <p><strong>Dragonite</strong>: Dragonite is unaffected by Earthquake and 2HKOes Rhydon with Blizzard. Rhydon can switch out, but this carries the risk of Dragonite setting up Agility and whittling down Rhydon's team with Wrap. Rhydon has noway to reliably cripple Dragonite as it sets up, as Rock Slide only 2HKOes it,and Body Slam only has a 30% chance to paralyze it. Rhydon does have space to mitigate Dragonite thanks to its Normal resistanceâ€”it can switch into Hyper Beam, forcing a recharge turn and letting it either deal major damage or attempt to land Body Slam paralysis, and it can switch into and out of Wrap to stall out its PP.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro's Surf OHKOes Rhydon, and it can paralyze a Pokemon on a predicted switch. However, it's outsped and 3HKOed by Rhydon's Earthquake more often than not. In addition, Slowbro relies on Rest for recovery, giving Rhydon opportunities to switch in and either force Slowbro out or KO it.</p> <p><strong>Victreebel</strong>: Victreebel's Razor Leaf is guaranteed to OHKO Rhydon, and it has fearsome status moves in its arsenal to cripple switch-ins as well as Wrap to let it pivot to a teammate for free. However, Rhydon has a 59.6% chance to 2HKO Victreebel with Earthquake and can also cripple it with Body Slam paralysis, making it a temporary and risky switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Sandslash and Golem</strong>: Although they are rare, both of these Pokemon outspeed Rhydon and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Sandslash has some room to switch in, as Rhydon can only 3HKO it in return. That being said, it doesn't appreciate taking damage, as doing so could jeopardize its ability to sweep. Golem has much more difficulty finding a time to come in, as its Ground weakness means Rhydon will 2HKO it.</p>",

      "Physical Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Earthquake deals massive damage to anything that doesn't resist it. Body Slam lets Rhydon fish for valuable paralysis on switch-ins that are not Normal-type, including Exeggutor and Mewtwo. Substitute is Rhydon's primary utility move, allowing it to scout the opponent's choices. It can then take advantage of the free turn to pressure the foe with Earthquake or attempt to paralyze it with Body Slam. Caution is advised when doing this, however, as certain Pokemon, such as Exeggutor and Cloyster, can switch into Rhydon as it sets up Substitute and force it out using Sleep Powder, Stun Spore, and Clamp. Rhydon's gargantuan HP and Defense allow its Substitute to always survive a Seismic Toss from Chansey and survive a +6 Body Slam from Mew 79.5% of the time. Furthermore, it gives it the option to fish for full paralysis against Mewtwo, potentially giving Rhydon an opening to break through. However, Rhydon has to be careful not to overuse Substitute, as it values keeping its HP dearly. If Rhydon does become low on HP, its ability to switch into foes such as Mew and Chansey is severely compromised. Rock Slide OHKOes Jynx, Moltres, and Articuno, 2HKOes Lapras and Dragonite, 3HKOes Cloyster, and does more damage than other options to Exeggutor. Rock Slide also prevents Rhydon from being stalled out by Toxic Zapdos. It isn't mandatory, thoughâ€”these Pokemon are rare save for Exeggutor and Jynx, so Rock Slide is often less useful than Rhydon's other moves. Rest allows Rhydon to stonewall Mew and Snorlax using only Normal-type attacks. It also lets Rhydon switch into Chansey without getting worn down over time and prevents it from being stalled out by Toxic Zapdos. However, Rest invites in threats such as Mewtwo and Slowbro, which easily set up on Rhydon.</p> <p>Rhydon works best late-game when faster Pokemon on the opposing team have either been KOed or paralyzed. Once this support is provided, Rhydon can switch into Pokemon it walls, such as Zapdos, or foes that does not majorly threaten it, such as Seismic Toss Chansey. Rhydon is not exclusively a late-game Pokemon, howeverâ€”its mid-game utility is also a force to be reckoned with, as it can switch into the foes listed above and threaten paralysis on switch-ins with Body Slam. After Rhydon is first revealed, however, this can be quite predictable, and the opponent may switch these Pokemon out immediately rather than risk giving it free turns. Rhydon can also switch into a predicted Hyper Beam or Explosion, though it needs to be careful; Pokemon that carry these moves often have coverage for Rhydon. Finally, Rhydon can switch into Thunder Wave and recovery moves like Soft-Boiled and Rest. Substitute should be used carefully; Rhydon has no way to recover outside of Rest, and the HP reduction from using Substitute can put it into range of many threats after it's broken, such as Mewtwo's Ice Beam and a 2HKO from Exeggutor's Psychic. Rhydon should only use Substitute when it is more advantageous to set up one compared to just attacking, such as when the opponent is likely to sacrifice a Pokemon.</p> <p>Bringing paralysis inducers alongside Rhydon is essential given its poor Speed. Starmie and Chansey are excellent teammates, as they take little damage from Ice-, Psychic-, and Water-type moves and possess the coverage to help against Pokemon that trouble Rhydon, like Exeggutor and Slowbro. Slowbro has an identical typing to Starmie and is more effective at luring in Mewtwo and enemy Starmie to paralyze them. In addition, it appreciates Rhydon's ability to block Electric moves and take Explosion, a move Slowbro often attracts. Zapdos is effective against Water-types and Exeggutor and stops Mew carrying only Earthquake in its tracks. However, both Rhydon and Slowbro are very slow, making them somewhat shaky partners. Cloyster can be serviceable partner to Rhydon alongside Thunder Wave Mew and Mewtwo, as Cloyster can cover many matchups Rhydon struggles into, such as Tauros, while Rhydon walls the Electric-types that Cloyster struggles against. However, Cloyster + Rhydon is extremely weak to unparalyzed Mewtwo. Exeggutor is another decent choice that packs Sleep Powder, useful resistances to Ground and Psychic, and Explosion to give Rhydon another opportunity to come in. Rhydon helps these Pokemon in return by stonewalling Zapdos and breaking through paralyzed Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo. Though Tauros only has Body Slam for paralysis support, it boasts a great Speed stat, perfect coverage, and a considerable critical hit rate, and it tends to draw in and pressure Pokemon that cause difficulties for Rhydon, such as Mewtwo and Exeggutor. Rhydon makes a great partner to Mew with Earthquake as its sole attacking option, as Rhydon can switch into and wall Zapdos, which walls this Mew set, and Mew can spread paralysis across the opposing team, which Rhydon appreciates greatly.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey holds a strong niche in Ubers due to having the best Special bulk in the game; it's one of the best switch-ins available to special attackers such as Starmie, Alakazam, and particularly tier titan Mewtwo, taking a mere 21.4% maximum from its STAB Psychic and threatening it and its team with paralysis and sleep. It can also switch into Mew when healthy and threaten it with paralysis, as it survives all of Mew's regular attacks even at +2. It is one of the most reliable paralysis spreaders in the tier thanks to its access to reliable recovery and consistent entry points.</p> <p>However, outside of threatening status, Chansey is extremely passive, as Seismic Toss can only 4HKO or 5HKO most foes, and it completely thuds into Rhydon, failing to break its Substitute. Ice Beam, meanwhile, does not particularly threaten non-Ice weak foes. Chansey can't even wall Mewtwo well in the long term, as it takes 44.2% minimum from a +4 Mewtwo Psychic; even with Light Screen it can easily be overwhelmed by Special drops and critical hits. Mewtwo can also use Self-Destruct or Submission to break through Chansey. It also can very easily run out of Soft-Boiled PP in longer games. Its low base Speed, which leaves it outsped by every relevant threat outside of Snorlax, Rhydon, and Slowbro, along with its physical frailty, notably being 2HKOed by Rhydon's Earthquake and taking 38.1% minimum from a Snorlax Body Slam, can at times make Chansey quite exploitable and a potential liability on teams.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Sing can be dropped if there is already a sleeper on Chansey's team, such as an Exeggutor or Jynx, and Light Screen is droppable for teams that are not dedicated to stalling. Counter can be used to OHKO Snorlax and Tauros by returning damage from Body Slam, and it also OHKOes Mewtwo using Submission and Mew using +2 Body Slam. However, Counter becomes practically useless once it is revealed and can easily be scouted by Snorlax, Mew, and Tauros with Earthquake. Reflect makes Chansey far better into physical attackers such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Zapdos, and it also allows Chansey to survive Self-Destruct and Explosion. However, Reflect leaves Chansey without many tools to adequately deal with Mewtwo and other special attackers outside of paralysis. It also has a major Soft-Boiled PP issue, as it cannot stall Mewtwo or Slowbro at all. Thunderbolt can be used alongside Ice Beam to give Chansey perfect coverage and deal super effective damage to many threats, such as Water-types. However, Water-types are quite uncommon, so Chansey rarely has to give up a moveslot to cover for them. On top of this, this perfect coverage still does not threaten Mewtwo or Mew in the slightest. Flash allows Chansey to prevent Mewtwo and Mew from setting up safely in front of it and reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, but it is inaccurate and fishing for misses is inherently unreliable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Paralyzed Mewtwo can switch into Chansey and start boosting with Amnesia, 2HKOing Chansey with +4 Psychic 20.2% of the time while only being 5HKOed in return by Seismic Toss. Even with Light Screen, Chansey can be overwhelmed by Psychic Special drops and critical hits, especially if it's paralyzed. Chansey also has to be wary of the rare Submission Mewtwo, which 2HKOes it 86.7% of the time. Mewtwo can also use Self-Destruct, which does 80.3% minimum. However, if Mewtwo is unparalyzed, it should be wary of switching in due to Sing, and it becomes far more vulnerable to physical attackers if it becomes paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Paralyzed Mew can switch into Chansey quite easily, tanking Seismic Toss and Ice Beam well and threatening it in return with Thunder Wave and boosted physical attacks. UnparalyzedMew has to be cautious of Sing and dislikes paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax is only 6HKOed by Seismic Toss and Ice Beam, and it threatens Chansey back with a KO from Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam. It also OHKOes Chansey with Self-Destruct, but Snorlax hates paralysis if it lacks Rest.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Rhydon is immune to Thunder Wave and is only 5HKOed by Seismic Toss, letting it set up a Substitute in front of Chansey with ease and 2HKO it with Earthquake. However, Rhydon has to be conservative with its HP, as it lacks recovery bar Rest and can find itself worn down quickly. Rhydon also has to be wary of Ice Beam, as it's 2HKOed by the move.</p> <p><strong>Explosion users</strong>: Explosion and Self-Destruct users, such as Exeggutor, Snorlax, Mew, Mewtwo, Cloyster, Gengar, and Golem, all OHKO or do heavy damage to Chansey with the move. Snorlax's Self-Destruct and Golem's Explosion OHKO Chansey, while Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Mew's Explosion are heavily favored to OHKO it. Mewtwo's Self-Destruct and Gengar's Explosion never OHKO Chansey, but both still deal significant damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can switch into Chansey lacking Sing and Thunderbolt with ease, as it's only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and takes barely any damage from Ice Beam. Slowbro threatens Chansey with Thunder Wave and boosted Surf, 2HKOing it 76.2% of the time with +6 Surf and 4HKOing it 88.4% of the time if it has Light Screen up. Slowbro only has to be wary of its predictable Rest being exploited by the likes of Mewtwo, Snorlax, and Rhydon.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos outspeeds Chansey, can paralyze it, and 3HKOes it with Drill Peck 76.2% of the time. It also has Agility to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. However, Zapdos is 3HKOed by Ice Beam and 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, and it needs critical hits or full paralysis to break through Chansey. However, with the amount of turns Chansey needs to KO Zapdos safely, it is likely that Zapdos will break through it.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and Ice Beam and KOes Chansey in return with Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam. However, Tauros becomes far less threatening once paralyzed and can only reliably beat Chansey one-on-one if Chansey is also paralyzed, so it should only fight Chansey if it absolutely has to.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Sing": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Chansey can switch into Mewtwo and other special attackers and attempt to land Sing, as Mewtwo usually cannot risk being put to sleep. Seismic Toss threatens consistent damage on every foe in the tier, 4HKOing or 5HKOing most foes and forcing predictable recovery turns from the likes of Starmie, Alakazam, Mewtwo, and Mew, which can be exploited to switch in strong physical attackers, such as Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros. However, Seismic Toss can be exploited by Rhydon, as its Substitute is not broken by the move. Ice Beam 2HKOes Ground-types and threatens freeze on unparalyzed foes; however, it has far less PP than Seismic Toss and does pathetic damage to boosted Mewtwo. Chansey is usually better off just paralyzing the foe than fishing for freeze. Thunder Wave allows Chansey to spread paralysis across the opposing team, with Pokemon such as Tauros, Starmie, and Alakazam being completely crippled if they become paralyzed, and paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo becoming being far more vulnerable to physical attackers such as Snorlax and Rhydon.</p> <p>Chansey is one of the best status spreaders and Mewtwo switch-ins in the tier, so Pokemon that want Mewtwo and other Special attackers paralyzed, such as Cloyster, Tauros, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Sandslash, make great partners to Chansey. Exeggutor and Zapdos make good switch-ins to Mew, which may otherwise cause Chansey issues. Exeggutor can also switch into Rhydon, which threatens Seismic Toss Chansey immensely. Pokemon that get forced out by strong Psychic-types, such as Tauros, Rhydon, and Cloyster, also make good teammates to Chansey, as Chansey can switch into special attackers for them.</p>"
      },
      "Light Screen": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Light Screen lets Chansey be a proper wall to Special attackers, taking only 26.4% maximum from Mewtwo's +4 Psychic and only 27.8% maximum from Slowbro's +6 Surf, allowing Chansey to stall them out of attacking PP. However, Chansey can be overwhelmed by Special drops and critical hits from Mewtwo or potentially get stalled out of Soft-Boiled PP, as it does not have enough PP to stall both Mewtwo and Slowbro. Seismic Toss is Chansey's best option for solid damage across the entire tier and to force recovery turns for Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Alakazam, and Starmie, which can be taken advantage of by the likes of Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon. Ice Beam allows Chansey to hit Ground-types for super effective damage, notably 2HKOing Rhydon, which otherwise is only 5HKOed by Seismic Toss and can set up a Substitute freely. Ice Beam also lets Chansey fish for freeze against unparalyzed foes. Thunder Wave allows Chansey to hamstring fast threats such as Tauros, Starmie, and Alakazam, and paralysis makes the omnipotent Mew and Mewtwo much more vulnerable to strong physical attackers such as Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon.</p> <p>Light Screen Chansey makes a great partner to Pokemon that appreciate status on fast foes such as Tauros, Rhydon, Cloyster, and Snorlax. These Pokemon are usually threatened by strong Psychic-types, which Chansey can switch into. Light Screen Chansey is much more of a dedicated stall set than Sing Chansey, so Pokemon with high longevity, such as Reflect Snorlax, Cloyster, Exeggutor, and even Aerodactyl, can make good partners to it.</p>"

  "Starmie": {
    "overview": "<p>Despite being an OU staple, Starmie struggles to find an impactful niche in Ubers outside of the lead slot. Both its offensive and defensive presence are outclassed by other Pokemon in the tier. Still, Starmie can be a serviceable lead in specific team compositions that benefit from extra paralysis. Its high Speed enables it to outpace much of the metagame and threaten damage or paralysis. Lead Starmie can inflict high damage on common early-game sleepers like Gengar and Exeggutor while also threatening freeze or paralysis on any switch-ins. Its best role is disrupting the opposing teamâ€™s sleepers by inflicting damage and status and then taking sleep for its teammates. Additionally, its bulk and recovery fares well against physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon, provided its teammates are able to eliminate opposing special walls like Mewtwo and Chansey. Starmie fits well into team compositions that benefit an additional fast Thunder Wave user, such as compositions with Rhydon, Tauros, Dragonite, and Thunderbolt Mewtwo.</p> <p>However, the roles described above can be filled by other, more reliable options. While Starmie combines paralysis threat with special offense, Pokemon such as Chansey and Exeggutor are better at spreading status, and Pokemon like Mewtwo and Slowbro are more potent special threats. Slowbro specifically is an excellent option over Starmie in any role outside of the lead. Both share the same typing, weaknesses, and access to Thunder Wave, but Slowbro's access to Amnesia allows it to better withstand Mewtwo's assault while simultaneously threatening to sweep the opposing team. Alakazam also competes for the same role as a paralysis spreader, though both have merits. Starmie has valuable physical bulk to take on Tauros and Snorlax while also being stronger against Exeggutor and Rhydon. Alakazam, meanwhile, is better into Zapdos and Gengar, can better threaten paralyzed Chansey due to its higher Special, and can use Seismic Toss to deal consistent damage to Amnesia users. Starmie cannot threaten Mewtwo or Mew with anything beyond paralysis, and Starmie will crumble if Mewtwo carries Thunderbolt. Starmie also possesses no reliable tools to force paralysis past Chansey, meaning if it fails to secure a freeze, Chansey can prevent Starmie from making any progress in the game. Thus, Starmie will often fail to do more than paralyze something and take sleep. While Starmie can serve as a decent special attacker and status spreader, many teams are better supported by Pokemon that are more committed to either role.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Thunderbolt is a tempting choice to replace Blizzard in order to punish Slowbro, which will frequently switch into Starmie without it. However, the loss of Blizzard makes Exeggutor extremely difficult to deal with, and also leaves Starmie toothless against Zapdos and Dragonite. Thunderbolt may also be tempting for potential Starmie mirrors, but Starmie is generally not used enough to make it worth the moveslot. Running Blizzard and Thunderbolt together simply leaves Starmieâ€™s special offense minuscule without the benefit of STAB, and it cannot fight Gengar without Psychic.</p> <p>Surf or Hydro Pump could be considered over Blizzard or Psychic to empower Starmie as a special attacker, enabling slightly better damage ranges on neutral targets and scoring OHKOs on Rock / Ground types. Unfortunately, this will again leave Starmie unable to threaten either Gengar or Exeggutor, making these moves much more trouble than they are worth.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Thunderbolt Mewtwo</strong>: Thunderbolt is a common option on Mewtwo, and it can guarantee an OHKO on Starmie after one Amnesia. Since Thunderbolt Mewtwo does not usually mind paralysis, there is little Starmie can do to threaten it, and it has no trouble setting up Amnesia and threating Starmieâ€™s entire team. This is a hard counter, and Starmie must avoid this matchup at all costs.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Starmie struggles to progress through Chansey, and it can threaten status back. Sing variants will happily switch into Starmie and put it to sleep, putting Starmie in a difficult position to either paralyze Chansey or fish for a freeze. Non-Sing Chansey can still consistently switch into Starmie whenever it hits the field, enabling it to paralyze the Starmie and mitigate its threat all game.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>- Slowbro is both one of Starmieâ€™s biggest checks and one of the most common choices instead of Starmie in the teambuilder for any position outside of the lead. Slowbro has the same typing, access to Thunder Wave, and Amnesia, which makes it simultaneously more threatening offensively and defensively. Slowbro will frequently enter the field once Starmie has revealed it lacks Thunderbolt, and it will take minimal damage doing so and set up Amnesia for free. Not only will Starmie not be able to threaten it, but it must switch to something that can force it off the field before it executes a sweep.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Jolteon</strong>: Although neither is comfortable switching into Starmie, STAB Thunderbolt from Zapdos and Jolteon is guaranteed to 2HKO Starmie and OHKOes with a critical hit. While Zapdos does take heavy damage from Blizzard, it still has a 19.53% chance to OHKO Starmie. Jolteon, although less commonly seen, is also faster than Starmie and can survive 2 non-critical attacks, making it the better check.</p> <p><strong>Non-STAB Thunderbolt Users</strong>: Although rare in the Ubers metagame, a stray Thunderbolt from Chansey, Lapras, or Dragonite is still a significant threat. One of the most reliable ways to dispatch a Starmie is to paralyze and threaten it with Thunderbolt. Gengar's Thunderbolt is particularly notable, as it can 2HKO Starmie and OHKO on a critical hit. Usually, Starmie's greater Speed keeps Gengar at bay, but if Starmie is paralyzed and Gengar is not, this matchup is turned to Gengar's favor. Gengar players also have the option to risk Starmie's Psychic in exchange for a chance at a Thunderbolt critical hit, but this risk is not statistically favored and is generally not a preferred option in the Ubers metagame.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: While Mew certainly doesnâ€™t want to take paralysis early, in certain endgame states Mew can use Starmie to set up for a sweep. Starmie cannot threaten Mew once itâ€™s paralyzed, so it depends on another teammate removing Mew. If nothing can come in and quickly threaten or remove the paralyzed Mew, Mew can set up Swords Dance and clear Starmieâ€™s team.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Starmieâ€™s primary role on any team is to act as a fast Thunder Wave user, as the goal of a Starmie team is to spread paralysis through the opponentâ€™s team and open endgame sweepers. Outspeeding much of the metagame, Starmie can immediately paralyze an opponentâ€™s sleep lead and any potential switch-ins. However, the early paralysis can make it more difficult to secure sleep, so lead Starmie should be used on teams that prioritize paralysis over sleep or have a plan to push sleep past a paralyzed Chansey. Recover supports its role as a paralysis spreader and helps it take on physical attackers. Once it paralyzes the foe, Starmie will usually outspeed and be able to heal off damage.</p> <p>Psychic is a guaranteed 2HKO against Gengar and is capable of an OHKO on a critical hit, making this move essential on a lead Starmie set. Gengar is one of the most common leads in the Ubers metagame, and Starmieâ€™s primary role in the lead slot is to force Gengar off the field, giving the Starmie user the option to attack, immediately use Thunder Wave, or double switch to a sleeper and induce sleep to grab momentum. Further, Psychic is Starmieâ€™s best option to muscle past a paralyzed Chansey, as consecutive Special drops can force a switch, allowing a chance to spread paralysis onto one of Chansey's teammates. Combined with Starmieâ€™s significant 22.46% critical hit chance, STAB Psychic can deal significant damage to neutral targets; it will normally 3HKO Tauros and 4HKO Snorlax, and it can 2HKO both with the aid of critical hits and Special drops.</p> <p>Blizzard is Starmieâ€™s best choice for a fourth move when operating as a lead. Blizzard threatens a 3HKO on both Exeggutor and Zapdos, which are common partners to Gengar and are sometimes leads themselves. The damage on Exeggutor is especially significant, as this prevents Exeggutor from getting sleep for free, as it will take massive damage and risk freeze if it tries to fight Starmie. Blizzard also has a 38.5% chance to OHKO Dragonite, bolstered further by critical hit and freeze chances. A sleeping Starmie can attempt to wake on Dragonite using Wrap and threaten significant damage. However, unlucky wake attempts can be punished by the opposing team switching in potent threats for free, so this strategy must be used sparingly. Further, Blizzard can allow Starmie to fish for freeze early-game, potentially scoring a massive advantage in the opening. While Ice Beam could be considered for better freeze fishing due to higher accuracy and PP, the drop in damage is significant, as 3HKOs on Exeggutor and Zapdos are no longer guaranteed. The major drawback to freeze fishing is that it delays or prevents Starmie from spreading paralysis, which is more consistent. Since its role is primarily a paralysis spreader, Blizzard is usually chosen for the damage on the above targets.</p> <p>If Starmie does not take sleep early, Thunder Wave can allow it to switch into common threats and deal paralysis back. Mew, Tauros, and Dragonite, specifically, are slower than Starmie and do not appreciate paralysis, so Starmie can often force them off the field. A healthy Starmie can be a valuable check to Tauros, preventing it from breaking open the team. Starmie must be careful of taking paralysis from Body Slam or Thunder Wave, but it can still usually fire off Thunder Wave and outspeed again, allowing it to use Recover more effectively. However, offense in Ubers is more potent than in OU, and Starmie must be wary of threats that outpace Recoverâ€”Thunderbolt from Zapdos, Gengar, and Mewtwo is the most notable danger, but Swords Dance Mew can be equally threatening. Mew has a near-guaranteed 2HKO with +2 Earthquake. Once Explosion users have been cleared, Mew and Mewtwo can set up freely while Starmie cannot threaten them beyond paralysis. Once they have set up, they can easily clear through a paralyzed Starmie and win the game. Thus, Starmie is much less effective late-game, so it is greatly preferred to have it take sleep.</p> <p>It is best to pair Starmie with teammates that can take advantage of the opposing team being paralyzed. As special walls like Chansey will often switch in to stop Starmie's progress, physical attackers can take advantage of the now-paralyzed Chansey and force damage onto the opposing team. Pokemon like Snorlax, Tauros, and Rhydon are able to 2HKO a paralyzed Chansey, so they are great at removing it to allow teammates to spread status onto further targets. The slow, offensive ground types, such as Rhydon and Sandslash, make natural partners to Starmie. Their Ground typing is appreciated to cover Starmieâ€™s weakness to Thunderbolt, and Starmieâ€™s Blizzard can weaken Exeggutor early and prevent it from walling them. Further, the opponentâ€™s Mewtwo and Chansey often do not carry both Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, meaning one of the two will generally provide chances to gain momentum. Starmie and Rhydon together can be used to target the common Gengar + Zapdos team core; Starmie will generally force Gengar off the field early-game and paralyze the incoming Chansey, allowing Rhydon to cover the Zapdos threat and sweep late-game.</p>"

  "Jynx": {
    "overview": "<p>Jynx is a good sleeper in the RBY Ubers metagame, able to immediately pressure opposing teams with the fastest Lovely Kiss in the game. It has very powerful STAB moves in Blizzard and Psychic that give it good coverage to hit Rhydon, Exeggutor, and Zapdos for good damage while pressuring Chansey with Special drops. Jynx has decent Speed and a decent Special stat to back up its Lovely Kiss and strong STAB moves. Being an Ice-type even allows it to pivot into and wall Ice Beam Chansey, Mewtwo, and Slowbro before they set up with Amnesia.</p> <p>However, Jynx has very low Defense, taking heavy damage from most physical attacks. It is slower than several notable Pokemon such as Tauros, Gengar, Zapdos, and Mew. Jynx can also end up as setup bait for Slowbro, Mew, and the dangerous Mewtwo after it has put something to sleep and gotten its freeze, requiring very careful use after landing both statuses. Overall, Jynx finds its role as a strong sleep- and freeze-inducing lead with good matchups against standard Psychic-type leads.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Jynxâ€™s last moveslot has a few options available to it. One option is Ice Beam, which has more PP and therefore more opportunities to freeze than Blizzard alone. Another option is Seismic Toss, which allows Jynx to pressure threats it wouldn't otherwise be able to deal with, like Slowbro and Mewtwo after Amnesia. Body Slam can spread paralysis, but its inconsistency and Jynx's very low Attack stat make this mostly not worth it. Mimic is a gimmick that can give Jynx useful moves such as Recover, Thunder Wave, and Amnesia but is very matchup- and luck-based. Jynx has the option of dropping Psychic to run two other moves and potentially catch something off guard at the cost of not being able to pressure Chansey. An interesting option is running 7 DVs in Defense to OHKO Tauros with Counter after getting hit by Body Slam. However, this significantly hurts Jynx, as it already somewhat lacks longevity, and it can also be useless if the opponent is careful and uses Earthquake.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro sets up on Jynx, takes minimal damage from Psychic and Blizzard, can heal Seismic Toss damage, and doesnâ€™t care about Body Slam paralysis. However, it does fear a freeze. A Slowbro that is asleep from Rest can be chipped by Seismic Toss into the range of a teammateâ€™s Explosion. Keep in mind that Slowbro with only Ice Beam must be at +6 to even 3HKO Jynx.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: While less common, Starmie always walls Jynx's coverage and heals the little damage it may take. It can also effectively absorb Jynx's Lovely Kiss and use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, too many Psychic Special drops can force it out.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is a very common lead, is faster than Jynx, and carries Hypnosis. It can also use Explosion to OHKO Jynx, which can put Jynx's team at a big disadvantage if there is no backup sleeper. However, Hypnosis's chance to miss means Gengar should fear possibly being put to sleep itself or taking big damage from Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Pokemon that can use Thunder Wave such as Mew, Jolteon, and Alakazam can severely cripple Jynx, as it has very little use without the option of a fast Lovely Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes minimal damage from any of Jynx's moves and forces it out with Seismic Toss. It can also put Jynx to sleep with Sing or paralyze it with Thunder Wave. However, Jynx can freeze Chansey or drop its Special, forcing it out. Also, if Ice Beam is Chansey's only attacking move, Jynx can wall it and use Rest to heal damage.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo sets up on Jynx as long as it does not get frozen. Mewtwo can also use Thunder Wave to cripple Jynx. However, Jynx has a chance to beat Mewtwo if it gets fully paralyzed for a few turns before it sets up, or if Jynx lands some critical hits.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Lead Tauros versus lead Jynx is a gamble for both sides. Tauros is able to fish for Body Slam paralysis, a critical hit Body Slam that OHKOes 66% of the time, or Stomp flinches. On the other hand, if Tauros fails to get any of those, Jynx can try to put it to sleep, use Counter, or use Blizzard for heavy damage. However, Tauros can also use Earthquake on the first turn to avoid Counter and guarantee a KO with Hyper Beam on the next turn. Also, Tauros is able to come in later in the game and finish off a weakened Jynx with little issues.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Lovely Kiss is Jynx's best move, allowing it to likely disable one of the opponent's Pokemon for most of the game. Blizzard and Psychic hit the majority of the tier for solid damage. Psychic also has a chance to lower the foe's Special, helping Jynx deal a little bit more damage with subsequent attacks. Counter allows Jynx to fire off massive damage after taking a Normal-type move, usually Body Slam from Tauros, Snorlax, or Mew. However, it is very prediction reliant, as all three run Earthquake and can use it to avoid damage from Counter. Rest helps Jynx stall Chansey, eliminating an obstacle for your own Mewtwo, as well as increasing Jynx's overall longevity. One must be aware that many physical attackers and setup sweepers can take advantage of a sleeping Jynx, so Rest must be used carefully.</p> <p>Jynx sometimes gets an early-game freeze before it can try to freeze Mewtwo, so Light Screen Chansey is a premier teammate, as it provides one of the tierâ€™s best checks to Mewtwo. Light Screen allows Chansey to avoid the 3HKO from Mewtwo's Psychic and paralyze it with Thunder Wave. Another good option is Flash Chansey to PP stall opposing Mewtwo if Jynx is running Rest. Jynx is great both with and against Explosion. Teammates with Explosion such as Gengar, Mew, and Exeggutor, or Snorlax with Self-Destruct, appreciate Jynx chipping the opposing team into their range. Also, Jynx should be used to take Explosion or as sleep fodder after it has inflicted its status effects to prevent Mewtwo and Slowbro from using it as setup fodder.</p> <p>Teammates that can check Mew are very helpful, as Mew can come in against Jynx and set up for free with Swords Dance, especially if Jynx has used Rest. The best check to Mew is Mew itself; Transform Mew is a very solid counter to opposing Swords Dance Mew, as it can easily turn the opponent's strategy against them. Gengar is another good teammate that completely counters mono-Body Slam Mew. Rhydon and Golem are other good checks to mono-Normal Mew and can support Jynx by absorbing other Normal- and Electric-type attacks, both of which can be problematic for it. Rhydon is stronger and bulkier than Golem and can help pressure the opposing team more immediately. However, both Jynx and Rhydon are somewhat slow for the Ubers metagame, and Amnesia users can use them as setup fodder. Golem, while weaker and frailer than Rhydon, is slightly faster and has Explosion as a one-time nuke, which can take out almost anything on the opposing team and applies immense constant pressure.</p>"

  "Tauros": {
    "overview": "<p>With its combination of power, Speed, and movepool, Tauros shines as a wallbreaker, revenge killer, and lead. Just like in OU, Tauros's powerful Normal-type STAB moves and complementary coverage coupled with its high critical hit rate make it difficult to switch into and almost impossible to fully stonewall. While its bulk is passable, it lacks resistances and instant recovery, so it offers very little defensive value to a team. Also, the bulkier metagame of Ubers blunts Tauros's edge; the mandatory Mew and Mewtwo can withstand its hits and either retaliate hard or cripple it with paralysis, forcing it out. Tauros is therefore less valued, though this frees it to be used much more aggressively, as it isn't critical to preserve Tauros for late-game.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Double-Edge's increased Base Power over Body Slam greatly improves Tauros's odds to 3HKO Mew and Mewtwo. Two Double-Edges followed by a Hyper Beam will usually KO Mew and Mewtwo. A single critical hit Double-Edge may also put Mewtwo and Mew in range of Hyper Beam. It is guaranteed to OHKO Jynx on a critical hit, unlike Body Slam, and can secure KOs outside of Body Slam's range without Hyper Beam's recharge turn. While Double-Edge strengthens Tauros's matchups against Mewtwo and Mew, it does come at the cost of coverage, and the recoil from Double-Edge can compromise Tauros's bulk. Moreover, its utility compared to Leer's Defense drop and paralysis reapplication is limited.</p> <p>Thunderbolt 3HKOes Cloyster and inflicts more damage on Slowbro than Body Slam does before it boosts its Special with Amnesia; it also hits other Electric-weak Pokemon slightly harder, but these benefits are minimal, and Cloyster is less common in Ubers than OU. Fire Blast can be used to burn physical attackers, such as Snorlax and Tauros, but it has limited utility beyond that. Furthermore, Swords Dance users like Mew are unimpeded by the Attack drop after boosting, and special attackers like Mewtwo welcome a burn shielding them from all other status effects. Substitute can be used to fish for full paralysis against threats like Mewtwo. However, this move is rarely worth the loss of a fourth attack, as it does not protect from status moves. Overall, Tauros has little room to cover specific matchups, and its moveslots are generally better geared toward beating omnipresent threats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Tauros relies heavily on its Speed and Attack stats to function. Once paralyzed or burned, Tauros has much greater difficulty applying pressure and loses much of its value as a revenge killer. Status renders matchups that are otherwise favorable to Tauros, like Chansey and Alakazam, very poor and forces it to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro's high physical bulk makes it an excellent switch-in to Tauros, as it is able to survive even a critical hit Hyper Beam and cripple Tauros with paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew can cripple Tauros with Thunder Wave, greatly reduce its damage output with Reflect, set up in front of it with Swords Dance, and even punish Tauros's STAB attacks with Counter. Mew also has instant recovery with Soft-Boiled, outpacing Tauros's damage output unless it has Leer. However, Mew is more often than not forced out due to full paralysis, critical hits, Defense drops, and flinches, and it's generally not worthwhile to let Mew risk paralysis.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo can threaten Tauros out with its massively powerful special attacks, making it an effective offensive check. Mewtwo has a chance to OHKO Tauros with a critical hit or +2 Psychic. Mewtwo can sometimes run Thunder Wave, making Tauros much less threatening. However, switching Mewtwo into Tauros's attacks is generally not a good idea, as it risks paralysis, after which Tauros pressures it heavily with physical attacks.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Zapdos is a fairly common foe both as a lead and in the back. It can withstand Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam and can paralyze Tauros with Thunder Wave, and it does massive damage in return with Thunderbolt. However, Zapdos cannot safely switch into Tauros, as Body Slam paralysis greatly reduces its ability to pressure the opposing team, and a critical hit Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam has a 97.70% chance to KO it.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: With Thunder Wave to cripple Tauros with paralysis, enough bulk to survive Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, and Recover to heal off the damage, Starmie makes for one of the best available switch-ins to Tauros. However, with Body Slam's 30% paralysis chance and high critical hit rate, Starmie won't be able to deal with Tauros consistently.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax has enough bulk to switch into Tauros and retaliate with a couple of attacks before getting KOed. Self-Destruct KOes Tauros 15% of the time at full HP, so any attack followed by Self-Destruct will reliably take it down. Counter in tandem with Hyper Beam can also catch Tauros by surprise; landing Counter against Body Slam puts Tauros into Hyper Beam range or outright KOes it on a critical hit. Reflect Snorlax is incredibly frustrating for Tauros, forcing it to rely on critical hits to break through.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: While Exeggutor doesn't reliably beat Tauros one-on-one, it can switch into a predicted Hyper Beam or Earthquake and cripple Tauros with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore, then maim it with Psychic or take it down with Explosion.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster and Lapras</strong>: These bulky Ice-types can stomach multiple hits from Tauros and threaten it with STAB Blizzard. Cloyster's Blizzard falls short of a 2HKO, but it can take four hits from Body Slamâ€”requiring an exploitable Hyper Beam to finish it offâ€”and can also use Explosion. Lapras can 2HKO Tauros with Blizzard 25% of the time, gamble on Confuse Ray to make Blizzard a guaranteed 2HKO, or even use Sing to put Tauros to sleep, but Tauros can finish off Lapras with four hits from Body Slam a little over half of the time.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: While they fear Tauros's coverage, Rock-types can switch into Normal-type attacks and bait weaker coverage moves for a teammate to switch in more easily. If Tauros forgoes Blizzard, Rhydon and Golem are able to trade blows with it. Aerodactyl is also a potent check to Tauros if it has neither Blizzard or Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar can switch into predicted Normal-type moves freely and either threaten Tauros with sleep or bait Earthquake for a teammate to switch in safely. If Tauros lacks Earthquake, Gengar switches into Tauros with ease.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "The Bull": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam and Hyper Beam are Tauros's primary attacks and greatest sources of pressure. Would-be checks like Exeggutor and Snorlax can be overwhelmed by Body Slam critical hits and paralysis chance for non-Normal-types. A critical hit Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam has a 97.70% chance to KO Zapdos, Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam KOes Jynx, and a critical hit Body Slam has a 66.7% chance to OHKO Jynx. Tauros also forces bulky threats like unboosted Mew out for fear of being paralyzed by Body Slam and finished off by Hyper Beam. Earthquake threatens Gengar, which otherwise easily switches into Tauros, with a 2HKO and safely scouts for Counter from the likes of Chansey and Snorlax. Blizzard is Tauros's strongest attack against Rhydon, Golem, and the rare Aerodactyl, 2HKOing them while also inflicting heavy damage against other Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Exeggutor and Zapdos.</p> <p>Leer can be used to soften up boosting Pokemon such as Slowbro and Mew, forcing them out to reset their Defense stat. This is particularly useful when the opponent has only one Pokemon left, allowing other physical attackers, like Snorlax and Rhydon, to threaten them even more. Leer's paralysis reapplication is also very useful against faster, paralyzed boosting targets like Mewtwo and Mew, allowing physical attackers to outspeed them even when paralyzed themselves. Tauros can use Leer to enable paralyzed allies to outspeed a paralyzed Mewtwo or Mew, allowing them to set up, heal themselves, or threaten Explosion. This especially helps Tauros itself, increasing its damage and allowing it to always 3HKO Mew and Mewtwo. Stomp is another alternative to Blizzard, trading coverage to exploit Stomp's 30.1% flinch chance against slower, preferably paralyzed Pokemon. Stomp threatens Jynx and Exeggutor in the lead matchup as well as paralyzed Mew, Mewtwo, and Snorlax.</p> <p>Tauros is often used as a lead, utilizing its strong STAB moves and coverage to threaten common leads, forcing them out proactively and spreading damage and paralysis among the opposing team. For example, common sleepers like Jynx and Gengar are 2HKOed by Body Slam and Earthquake, making a miss or a critical hit from Tauros deadly. If Tauros opts for Stomp instead, Jynx's odds of hitting Lovely Kiss get worse, and Stomp's lower damage prevents Counter from OHKOing Tauros. Zapdos will generally either try to trade hits with Tauros or switch out for fear of Body Slam's paralysis chance and Tauros's high critical hit rate. Faster leads like Alakazam and Jolteon generally dislike facing Tauros due to its high damage output and ability to spread paralysis, putting high pressure on them. Against these leads, Tauros also has the possibility of switching out, which can offer a strong sleep blocker in the form of paralyzed Chansey, and keeping Tauros healthy will help it apply pressure later.</p> <p>Tauros can also be used outside of the lead slot, functioning as a strong late-game cleaner. Paralyzed Mewtwo, Mew, and Chansey are particularly vulnerable against Tauros, which can easily spiral out of control with the combined odds of full paralysis, critical hits, and potential flinches from Stomp. In this role, Tauros generally switches in on a predicted recovery move from a paralyzed target like Mewtwo, Mew, or Slowbro, or it can be used as a revenge killer. Leer's ability to reapply paralysis is particularly valuable in this role, allowing Tauros to consistently force out or significantly weaken paralyzed Mew and Mewtwo. Additionally, it enables slower attackers like paralyzed Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Mew to outspeed foes, which is crucial late-game to enable Self-Destruct and Explosion. Leer can also allow paralyzed Mewtwo and Mew to outspeed opposing paralyzed Mewtwo and Mew, providing safer opportunities to recover.</p>"

  "Lapras": {
    "overview": "<p>Lapras's STAB Blizzard and tremendous bulk give it positive matchups against many of the physical attackers of Ubers, namely Swords Dance Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax. Its Speed is just enough to outrun Chansey and Exeggutor, which it can potentially threaten with Sing, disrupting common sleep strategies. Because Lapras is so hard to wall as a result of BoltBeam coverage, absorbing its Sing with paralyzed Pokemon is also very difficult; it can blow past Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie easily when they're paralyzed. Furthermore, Lapras is generally not concerned with taking paralysis itself, and when it's paralyzed it can potentially switch in on sleep moves from Pokemon like Exeggutor and threaten massive damage thereafter. Lapras's quadruple resistance to Ice and immunity to freeze lets it switch into certain Ice-type moves, notably against Chansey, softening a somewhat common Mewtwo removal strategy. Lapras's ability to trade hits favorably against almost the entirety of Kanto's finest allows it to clear the way for even stronger allies, positioning them for a quick beatdown.</p> <p>However, Lapras's lack of reliability comes back to bite it very frequently. It's easily worn down over the course of a game, as its Speed often forces it to take a hit before it can make a move, and it crucially lacks reliable recovery. Being weak to Thunderbolt and neutral to Psychic doesn't help it either, and an untimely critical hit can significantly limit the impact it will have over the course of a game. Additionally, Lapras faces stiff Water-type competition in Cloyster and Starmie. Both are faster than Lapras, and Cloyster has access to Clamp and Explosion, while Starmie has Recover and Thunder Wave. While they can't replicate its power or Sing access, they usually bring more consistent utility to a team, which often pushes Lapras out during teambuilding.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Lapras has a massive movepool that's worth delving into; however, Blizzard and Thunderbolt are generally undroppable. Hyper Beam can be used on Lapras's Confuse Ray set over Body Slam, providing a better matchup against Jynx by allowing a KO with two Thunderbolts followed by Hyper Beam. Lapras has access to Psychic, which can trigger a Special drop overflow against a +5 Mewtwo with maximum investment, but it has little use outside of this. Ice Beam can be used for the additional PP and accuracy, but the drop in power noticeableâ€”for example, Ice Beam fails to reliably 2HKO Exeggutor or come close to 2HKOing Tauros. Since Lapras wants to win a single notable KO through sheer bulk and power, it tends to be counterproductive.</p> <p>Lapras can attempt to use a Rest set that allows it to try to repeatedly win trades, but this cedes momentum to Mewtwo and Thunderbolt users like Zapdos. This can be used alongside Reflect to make Lapras a pain for Swords Dance Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax to deal with, but this is performed more effectively by Pokemon like Zapdos and Aerodactyl. This set also ends up making it extremely weak against Mewtwo, which pressures it effortlessly with nuclear special attacks and the ability to set up while Lapras is asleep.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: While Lapras deals massive damage to Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode, notably 2HKOing the former due to its Blizzard weakness, Lapras will quickly get forced out if it can't KO them outright. They deal massive damage with STAB Thunderbolt, with Jolteon and Zapdos 2HKOing it and Electrode doing so after mild chip damage. Additionally, their high critical hit rates can turn a 2HKO into an OHKO. Lapras should only attempt to win if they are paralyzed and the team lacks adequate switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo frequently uses Thunderbolt, and while this can't 2HKO Lapras unboosted, Mewtwo will frequently be at +2 or higher. Lapras struggles to damage Mewtwo at all, with an unboosted Mewtwo only taking around a quarter from Blizzard. The maximum damage Lapras can deal to it is 29.8% with Hyper Beam. The best shot Lapras has of winning is via parafusion tactics.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: While Lapras can use Hyper Beam to KO Chansey from a range of 37.9% to 44.6% and has the potential to freeze it or put it to sleep, Chansey has numerous ways to beat Lapras. A paralyzed Chansey is generally not afraid of non-Confuse Ray Lapras, stonewalling it, and Sing variants can fire off uncontested sleep with little Lapras can do. Light Screen variants designed to beat Mewtwo can also nullify Lapras's main strength, its powerful STAB Blizzard. Chansey can also threaten Lapras with a 3HKO from Thunderbolt. Sing Lapras teams should not paralyze Chansey and instead aim to use Lapras's faster Sing to force sleep onto the opposing team. This can be done through switching in on a predicted Seismic Toss or Ice Beam, both of which Lapras shrugs off.</p> <p><strong>Amnesia Snorlax</strong>: The minute Snorlax scores an Amnesia boost, Lapras is incapable of making any meaningful progress against it outside of a lucky freeze or critical hit. Because Snorlax takes a chunk from Blizzard switching in or trying to set up on Lapras, it's not the worst matchup, but it can quickly become unwinnable if Snorlax gets a free chance to set up.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: While uncommon, Rock Slide Mew is a terrible matchup for Lapras, 2HKOing it at +2. Niche Mew variants may also use Thunderbolt to possibly 3HKO it. However, other sets are terrified of sustained assaults from Lapras, especially when paralyzed, as Lapras's Blizzard has a favorable chance to 3HKO Mew. Confuse Ray Lapras variants are very annoying for Swords Dance Mew to deal with, as confusion damage increases due to its Attack boosts. Confusion damage uses the opponent's Reflect in damage calculation, so if Mew has Reflect active, confusion damage will ignore it.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: While rarer in the Ubers landscape, these Pokemon can paralyze and trade blows with Lapras easily if not paralyzed themselves, mostly thanks to their access to Recover. Alakazam can 3HKO Lapras with Psychic if it lands a single Special drop or critical hit, which is likely in a prolonged interaction. Starmie is a particularly poor matchup, possessing Thunderbolt to potentially 3HKO Lapras.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar 3HKOes Lapras with Thunderbolt while only being 3HKOed by Blizzard, and it can switch into Lapras's Thunderbolt or Normal-type coverage and still win one-on-one. It also possesses a more accurate sleep-inducing move in Hypnosis.</p> <p><strong>Sleep Leads</strong>: When faced with a faster sleep lead, such as Gengar, Jynx, or Hypno, Sing Lapras tends to be nothing more than a free opportunity for the opponent to try to land sleep or KO Lapras, which is dissuaded from switching out and letting a teammate be put to sleep.</p>",

      "Confuse Ray": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Lapras's STAB Blizzard is no joke, OHKOing Dragonite and almost always OHKOing Rhydon and Golem. It also 2HKOes notable Pokemon like Zapdos, Exeggutor, Persian, and sometimes even Tauros. Tauros is a notable matchup, as few Pokemon are capable of beating it in a head-on fight; not only can Lapras potentially 2HKO it, but it can also survive two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. Thunderbolt ensures Water-types like Cloyster, Starmie, and Slowbro can't wall Lapras, as it 2HKOes Cloyster and 3HKOes the others. Body Slam allows Lapras to be more self-sufficient in spreading paralysis, which also supports parafusion with Confuse Ray. It also gives Lapras an effective move against Jynx, rarely 3HKOing it.</p> <p>Thanks to RBY's brutal confusion mechanics, when supported with paralysis, Lapras can position itself into a positive matchup against most Swords Dance Mew variants, including Reflect sets. A single +2 self-hit puts Mew into Blizzard 2HKO range, and from there, Lapras tends to win the interaction. Another application consists of disrupting paralyzed Mewtwo and Slowbro's Amnesia setup, but outside of this, it's generally quite weak.</p> <p>Confuse Ray Lapras works best as a mid-game threat that disrupts conventional offensive strategies. Progress-makers like Snorlax and Mew tend to have trouble combatting Lapras, as they cannot KO it quickly. However, this only works consistently from full HP: thus, Lapras should be kept for one single, favorable trade before going on its rampage. Lapras benefits from an allied Mew with Thunder Wave, which is one of the most consistent methods of landing paralysis against a myriad of threats, most notably including opposing Mew. Other paralysis support options include Alakazam, Chansey, Jolteon, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Slowbro. Lapras teams tend to struggle against Zapdos, so Jolteon is a suitable partner, though Rhydon is also suitable for a more definitive answer.</p>"

      "Sing Lead": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thanks to the presence of Exeggutor and Tauros in the lead slot, Lapras is capable of being a decent lead itself. It possesses the ability to outspeed and 2HKO Exeggutor with its STAB Blizzard or land Sing before getting put to sleep itself. Against Tauros, it is able to stomach two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam and is virtually never KOed without a critical hit. In return, it can attempt to put Tauros to sleep or fire off Blizzard, which will 2HKO a little over a quarter of the time. Lapras can use its excellent coverage and bulk to use Thunderbolt against Starmie and unboosted Slowbro mid-game. It also completely stonewalls Cloyster, forcing it to use Explosion or switch out in fear of being 2HKOed by said Thunderbolt. Blizzard's 10.2% freeze chance also means Lapras can potentially flip a game on its head by securing a freeze on the likes of Chansey or Mewtwo. Hyper Beam is used in the last slot as a decent finishing tool against Chansey, KOing from about 40%.</p> <p>While Lapras does have many qualities that make it enticing as a lead, it also suffers from some bad matchups. Jynx, Gengar, Jolteon, and Zapdos all are common leads that make the Lapras user start off on a terrible foot. Zapdos and Jolteon are massively threatening with STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes Lapras, and they have a good chance to OHKO outright thanks to their high critical hit rates. While Zapdos is 2HKOed by Blizzard, this is still a very favorable matchup for it. Jynx and Gengar both outspeed and carry their own more accurate sleep-inducing moves, threatening to put Lapras to sleep before it can do anything. Lapras also suffers from its lack of recovery, often being worn down very quickly while taking stray hits from Snorlax and Mew. This makes it quite difficult to facilitate Lapras, especially when common Pokemon like Chansey and Thunderbolt Mewtwo can switch in repeatedly and shrug off the damage with their reliable recovery, only fearing being frozen.</p> <p>Lapras and its traits make it somewhat matchup dependent, as it can be quite devastating against teams that rely on Exeggutor for sleep or Cloyster for their Snorlax check. It is best to maximize your gain early on, putting something to sleep and using Blizzard to aim for a freeze. If these goals are achieved, then sacrificing Lapras to the likes of Sing Chansey is often optimal. One additional benefit is the lack of Thunderbolt on Chansey in Ubers, meaning it is typically safe to stay in and fish for a freeze while Chansey tries to put it to sleep. Additionally, if threats such as Cloyster are revealed, Lapras should be kept healthy to repeatedly switch in and freely use Blizzard into incoming Chansey and Mewtwo.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Ditto is frankly a terrible Pokemon in Ubers; however, it holds a nanoscopic niche, as it can switch into paralyzed Mew that isn't attacking and threaten to transform into it, usually forcing it to switch out to a more passive teammate, such as Chansey or Mewtwo, dispelling any boosts it may have. It can also attempt to PP stall Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Chansey. However, it can't PP stall effectively because the first two are extremely hard to switch into once Ditto runs out of PP itself, and the latter 3HKOes Ditto with Seismic Toss due to its HP not changing after it's transformed. Ditto takes on the reduced Speed stat of the paralyzed Pokemon it's transforming into even if it isn't paralyzed itself. It also uses its own stats when landing or receiving a critical hit, making it extremely weak to them. Ditto is completely crippled by paralysis, and its niche of forcing Mew out is done far better by other Pokemon, such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Aerodactyl. Ditto doesn't do enough damage with any Amnesia boosts it may copy, and it doesn't have enough PP to stall adequately.</p>",

Ditto is much more threatening if the opponent is using an Explosion spam team, as it can transform into a Pokemon with Explosion to become actually threatening. It requires paralysis support to effectively fulfill the little niche it has, so the likes of Exeggutor, Thunder Wave Mew and Mewtwo, and Chansey can make good partners for Ditto. Ditto should preferably be kept hidden until Mewtwo, Chansey, and Slowbro are KOed, as these are its best switch-ins that prevent it from being threatening. If it is being used to stall, Ditto necessitates teammates that can switch into Mewtwo once it runs out of PP, such as Light Screen Chansey, Slowbro, and one's own Mewtwo. The easiest way to eliminate these foes is with Explosion users, making the likes of Snorlax, Self-Destruct Mewtwo, and Explosion Mew good teammates.</p>"

  "Aerodactyl": {
    "overview": "<p>Aerodactyl finds a niche on defensive teams in Ubers for its ability to completely stonewall standard Mew and Snorlax sets as well as some variants of Tauros thanks to its unique Rock / Flying typing. Once it sets up Reflect, it takes negligible damage from even a +6 Mew Body Slam. Aerodactyl is also gifted with an exceptional base 130 Speed, which gives it a sky high 25.39% critical hit rate and ties it with Jolteon and Mewtwo as the second fastest Pokemon in the game.</p> <p>However, Aerodactyl's flaws massively outweigh its benefits. Its damage output is mediocre at best, struggling to threaten strong special attackers such as Mewtwo and Slowbro even on a critical hit, while it gets 2HKOed or 3HKOed in return by most special attacks; this lets Mewtwo and Slowbro switch in with little issue. Aerodactyl also cannot meaningfully threaten physical attackers outside of trying to burn them with Fire Blast, which is extremely risky, as it risks accidentally burning a special attacker switching in. Aerodactyl's movepool is extremely shallow, forcing it to run Double-Edge as its main attacking option, and recoil combined with stray hits from Mew and Snorlax wears it down quickly. This chip damage will eventually force it to use Rest, and while it may be able to do so safely against standard Mew and Snorlax, it's forced out by strong special attackers, such as Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Starmie. Once forced out while asleep, Aerodactyl has difficulty getting back in safely due to its frailty and passivity.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast can be dropped within reason, as it has a mere 8 PP and will rarely ever burn its intended target, instead usually burning a special attacker that can shrug off the chip damage and block other status later on. Fire Blast is also completely useless in front of a paralyzed Mew, as Aerodactyl cannot burn it anymore. Sky Attack can be used, as it is Aerodactyl's only way of doing meaningful damage to bulky foes, as a critical hit Sky Attack does 79.2% minimum to Mewtwo and 72.7% minimum to Slowbro. However, Sky Attack is extremely exploitable due to the charge turn. Mimic can be used to attempt to copy a useful move from Mew, such as Swords Dance, Soft-Boiled, Thunder Wave, or Body Slam. However, Mewtwo and Slowbro can still switch in with little issue. Wing Attack has a whopping 56 PP, which, in combination with Reflect and Double-Edge, gives Aerodactyl 112 spare PP to slowly stall out Mew and Snorlax.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo switches into all of Aerodactyl's attacks with little issue, taking negligible damage from even a critical hit Double-Edge while forcing Aerodactyl out with the threat of a 2HKO from any of its special attacks. If Mewtwo gets burned by Fire Blast, this allows it to block other status later on. Mewtwo only has to fear a critical hit Sky Attack, which does 79.2% minimum to it.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro, much like Mewtwo, switches into all of Aerodactyl's attacks with ease and threatens it out with the threat of paralysis and a 2HKO from Surf. Slowbro does have to fear a critical hit from Sky Attack though, as it takes 72.7% minimum and, unlike Mewtwo, is slower than Aerodactyl and lacks immediate recovery.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Aerodactyl takes heavy damage from all Ice-type moves from the likes of Tauros, Chansey, and Amnesia Snorlax. Amnesia Snorlax can be a major issue for Aerodactyl, as Aerodactyl is OHKOed by a +2 Blizzard, preventing it from fulfilling its role as a Snorlax check.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Electric-types, such as Zapdos and Jolteon, deal significant damage to Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt, with Zapdos even having a 46.2% chance to OHKO it, whereas Zapdos takes negligible damage in return from Double-Edge and does not fear burn from Fire Blast. Jolteon Speed tying Aerodactyl means Aerodactyl can't attempt to break through it with critical hits, as it risks getting KOed by Thunderbolt after recoil from Double-Edge.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Gengar is immune to Aerodactyl's Double-Edge and is only 6HKOed by Fire Blast, while it 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt in return, although getting burned by Fire Blast limit's Gengar's longevity as a pivot. Burn also halves the power of Gengar's already middling Explosion. Gengar also has to fear Sky Attack, as it's OHKOed by a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie forces out Aerodactyl with the threat of paralysis and a 2HKO from any of its super effective coverage moves, while Aerodactyl can only 4HKO it with Double-Edge; however, Starmie has to fear Sky Attack, as it's OHKOed by a critical hit.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Rhydon and Golem both 2HKO Aerodactyl with Rock Slide and take next to no damage from Double-Edge and Fire Blast; however, they have to be wary of getting burned by Fire Blast, as a burned Rhydon or Golem is effectively decommissioned.</p> <p><strong>Non-standard Mew</strong>: Uncommon Mew sets, such as Rock Slide Mew, special attacking Mew, and Transform Mew can catch Aerodactyl off guard; +6 Mew 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Rock Slide even with Reflect up, and special attacking Mew 2HKOes Aerodactyl with super effective moves and 3HKOes with Psychic. Special attacking Mew also does not fear burn from Fire Blast. Transform Mew stalls Aerodactyl out of PP over time.</p>",

      "Defensive Wall": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>The combination of Rest + Reflect lets Aerodactyl comfortably switch into most Mew and Snorlax sets as well as Tauros lacking Blizzard. Aerodactyl can take up to 5 Body Slam hits from a +6 Mew and 11 Body Slams from Snorlax once it sets up Reflect, so it can use Rest very safely. This lets Aerodactyl stall these foes out of attacking PP, as it can switch in repeatedly to shut them down offensively; special attackers like Mewtwo and Slowbro will usually switch in, so Aerodactyl needs to be partnered with teammates that can switch into them consistently, such as Chansey, Slowbro, and Soft-Boiled Mew. Reflect is imperative on Aerodactyl, as without it, it can be broken through with ease by Mew carrying Body Slam. Snorlax and Tauros lacking Blizzard can also give Aerodactyl issues if it lacks Reflect. With paralysis from Body Slam and Tauros's 21.48% critical hit rate, Tail Whip Tauros can also break a chipped Aerodactyl quite easily if it lacks Reflect.</p> <p>Aerodactyl's main attacking move is Double-Edge, as it does serviceable damage to less bulky foes. However, Double-Edge deals poor damage to bulkier foes such as Mewtwo and Slowbro, which threaten it back with strong special attacks and paralysis. Fire Blast has a 30% chance to burn the foe, incapacitating physical attackers such as Mew, Snorlax, and Tauros. However, Aerodactyl has to be wary of burning foes such as Mewtwo and Starmie, as the burn damage is negligible to them and lets them switch in and block other status later on.</p>"

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its incredible bulk, offensive prowess, and varied movepool, Snorlax is a near-mandatory Pokemon for every RBY Ubers team. Its Body Slam is incredibly powerful, and few Pokemon can consistently handle it. However, Body Slam isnâ€™t the only weapon Snorlax has in its arsenal. Earthquake and its Ice-type coverage allows Snorlax to deal with Normal-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Rhydon, Golem, and Gengar. Snorlax also has access to STAB Self-Destruct, which, paired with its base 110 Attack, is the strongest unboosted move in the game. With Self-Destruct, Snorlax is one of the best Pokemon to deal with the kings of RBY Ubers: Mewtwo, Mew, and Chansey. Moreover, in order to increase its physical bulk and longevity, Snorlax can sometimes run Reflect and Rest, allowing it to consistently check opposing Snorlax and Tauros.</p> <p>However, Snorlax is incredibly slow. With base 30 Speed, itâ€™s slower than every other fully evolved Pokemon except Slowbro. Therefore, Snorlax has to take a hit before acting, meaning it will be easier to KO, especially if Snorlax doesnâ€™t run Rest. Rest is the only option Snorlax has to heal. Once Rest is used, Snorlax becomes passive, giving the opponent the chance to send anything in against it, especially special attackers like Exeggutor, Alakazam, and Mewtwo, which can effectively pressure it with the nuclear Psychic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A set with Amnesia is conceivable. Paired with Reflect and Rest, Snorlax becomes nigh unbreakable, but, in return, Snorlax has only one slot for an attacking move, severely limiting its offensive potential. Ice Beam and Blizzard are terrible against Ice-type Pokemon and only pressure Chansey and Mewtwo with the threat of a freeze. This is quite notable, as it will essentially KO them and free up your own Mewtwo, but this can be easily played around. On the other hand, opting for Body Slam leaves Snorlax helpless against common bulky answers like Cloyster, Mew, Slowbro, Mewtwo, Gengar, and Rhydon. You can also choose to pair Amnesia with Rest, Body Slam, and Blizzard, but this set has trouble with opposing physical attackers, which can exploit the fact that Snorlax is not an immediate danger. Unfortunately, this Snorlax combines both PhysLax and ReflectLax's problems, since it is weak to physical attacks and very passive once Rest is used. Finally, every Amnesia Snorlax can realistically lose against Mewtwo due to its very high critical hit ratio.</p> <p>Snorlax has access to plenty of Normal-type moves. Double-Edge and Mega Kick are stronger than Body Slam, but due to their negative aspectsâ€”namely, Double-Edge's recoil and Mega Kick's low accuracyâ€”Body Slam remains a better option. Headbutt lets Snorlax fish for flinches against paralyzed foes, which can be useful in some situations; however, itâ€™s hard to find the space for this move in Snorlax's moveset without compromising its offensive prowess.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Opposing Snorlax</strong>: With Reflect and Rest, Snorlax is able to nullify the action of opposing Snorlax without losing its offensive potential. However, it will eventually be forced to use Rest, leaving it open for setup sweepers like Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Mew to break it. To some extent, PhysLax can come in to wear down opposing PhysLax with Body Slam and Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Thanks to its natural bulk, Slowbro stomachs everything Snorlax can do, repeatedly using Rest to PP stall Body Slam. In addition, Slowbro can threaten Snorlax and the opposing team with Thunder Wave and Amnesia before it threatens to sweep. Slowbro will usually win one-on-one through sheer brute force, often forcing PhysLax sets to use Self-Destruct in a desperate bid to stop it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Many special attackers are able to inflict a lot of damage to Snorlax. However, these Pokemon, namely Mewtwo, Exeggutor, Alakazam, Zapdos, and Starmie, hate to eat take a Body Slam due to high damage and paralysis chance, the latter of which can completely flip the situation and possibly allow Snorlax to win outright. However, they can effectively pressure a Snorlax that has just used Rest, usually forcing it out. Mewtwo can also set up with Amnesia as Snorlax switches out, which can be monumentally difficult to check.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: With its base 180 Defense and Rest, Cloyster is able to handle Snorlax long-term, staving off its Body Slam. Its Blizzard deals a large amount of damage to Snorlax, 3HKOing it if even slightly chipped, all while backed by a small freeze chance. However, freezing Snorlax is often detrimental in RBY Ubers, as freezing Chansey or Mewtwo is often a priority. Cloyster's unique access to Clamp allows it to easily chip Snorlax into Blizzard 3HKO range or pivot to a more effective Pokemon to check Snorlax. Snorlax can situationally win against Cloyster if it lands Body Slam paralysis or gets lucky with critical hits, but this is often ill-advised, as it leaves Snorlax vulnerable to being PP stalled by opposing Reflect Snorlax or Chansey in the long-run.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Rhydon is faster than Snorlax, and its Earthquake 3HKOes Snorlax in 97% of cases. On the other side, Snorlaxâ€™s Earthquake also 3HKOes Rhydon. Rhydon's Normal resistance gives it many opportunities to come onto the field. However, Rhydon should be careful of paralysis from Body Slam, which can tip the outcome of the duel in Snorlax's favor. Finally, Rhydon with Rest totally walls a Snorlax without Earthquake, Ice Beam, or Blizzard, but these Snorlax sets remain uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Thanks to its Normal immunity, Gengar can easily switch on Snorlax, trying to absorb Body Slam or Self-Destruct and threatening it with Hypnosis or Explosion. Unfortunately, in most cases, Snorlax runs Earthquake in its moveset, making the task harder to complete for Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Porygon</strong>: Surprisingly, Snorlax is unable to beat Porygon without using Self-Destruct or having it paralyzed prior. Indeed, Porygon is faster and can repeatedly use Recover, waiting for Snorlax to run out of Body Slam PP. However, Porygon is very passive and totally useless against every other Pokemon, meaning Snorlax can just switch out without fear, although Thunder Wave can be irksome. However, the tables are turned if Snorlax uses Amnesia, which lets it muscle past Porygon completely. Snorlax shouldn't Self-Destruct, freeze, or really interact with Porygon at all, as its low value outside of checking Snorlax means every move spent trying to beat it is batter spent on anything else outside of forcing it to use Recover.</p>",

      "PhysLax (All-out Attacker)": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set, often abbreviated as \"PhysLax,\" is the most popular set in RBY Ubers. With this combination of moves, Snorlax is one of the most difficult Pokemon to switch in on. In addition to the terrifying power of Snorlax's Body Slam, foes must be wary of its paralysis chance on non-Normal-types. With the most powerful Self-Destruct in the game, Snorlax can take down almost any opposing Pokemon other than Rhydon, Golem, and the Normal-immune Gengar, creating a favorable situation; the threat of Self-Destruct forces out high-value Pokemon like Mew and Mewtwo, letting Snorlax make further use of its powerful Body Slam while spreading paralysis. Also, note that Body Slam immediately followed by Self-Destruct KOes Mewtwo and nearly KOes Mew. Hyper Beam has incredible wallbreaking potential after Body Slam, letting Snorlax score 2HKOs against Jolteon and paralyzed Chansey; after two Body Slams, Hyper Beam can even KO Mewtwo. Earthquake allows Snorlax to hit Gengar and Rhydon, which may switch into Snorlax's Normal-type moves. Against opposing Normal-types, Snorlax can use Counter on their very likely Body Slam. This will put Tauros into Body Slam KO range or KO it if Tauros lands a critical hit. Counter also allows you to pressure your opponent if they switch Tauros out after using Body Slam, doing good damage thanks to Snorlaxâ€™s massive HP stat. Unfortunately, Snorlax has to drop Earthquake or Hyper Beam to fit Counter in its moveset. If Snorlax is not running Earthquake, it is helpless against Gengar and Rock-types, whereas by choosing to drop Hyper Beam, Snorlax loses a great part of its offensive potential.</p> <p>Snorlax mainly acts as a wallbreaker, whch can tear holes in the opposing team with Body Slam. Once on the field, Snorlax is pretty self-sufficient, so it requires little support. However, it needs to switch in safely. At first glance, Snorlax eats low-damaging moves and can easily switch on them. Even though it takes low damage from many attacks, this Snorlax can't recover HP, and chip damage may be enough to wear it down, so be attentive to any damage taken. Paralysis support benefits Snorlax greatly, as switching in on a paralyzed Pokemon often gives Snorlax the opportunity to threaten the now-slower Pokemonâ€”and by extension, the opposing team that may want to protect itâ€”with heavy damage. One of the most appreciated switch-in opportunities is a paralyzed Chansey, as it lacks the firepower to contest Snorlax and is physically frail, being OHKOed by Self-Destruct and 2HKOed by Body Slam + Hyper Beam. Because many RBY Ubers teams rely on Chansey to duel Mewtwo, it's often not worth it to stay in on Snorlax, forcing it out. Another common way to safely bring in Snorlax is to force a paralyzed Pokemon to heal; this lets Snorlax come in safely on moves like Recover, Soft-Boiled, and Rest, granting immense momentum. Snorlax checks, such as Porygon and Cloyster, trouble the common paralysis gameplan. Cloyster is very bulky but is susceptible to Body Slam paralysis; with some luck, Snorlax can break through Cloyster, though there are alternative solutions such as having Mewtwo or Mew use it as setup fodder while it is asleep. Ways to play around opposing Porygon are similar: it's very passive, so you can send almost anything else in and usually force it out. Finally, a Reflect Snorlax might attempt to switch into Snorlax, trying to curb its action. If you can force it to Rest, you can then pressure it with your strong special attackers, such as Mewtwo, while also creating opportunities to switch in later.</p> <p>Self-Destruct can take down a very useful opposing Pokemon, opening doors for the rest of your team while bringing strong allies in with impunity. Self-Destruct is one way to deal with a paralyzed threat, such as a paralyzed Mewtwo, inflicting between 78% and 93% damage, which may KO it or allow you to revenge kill it with a faster Pokemon like Tauros or Mew. The threat of Self-Destruct may force out the opposing Pokemon, creating favorable momentum. Finally, at low HP, Snorlax can also use Self-Destruct, hoping to take down an opposing Pokemon with it. Keep in mind that Self-Destruct is very predictable, and an experienced player will try to predict it by sending in Pokemon like Gengar, Golem, and Rhydon, or they may opt to sacrifice a sleeping, frozen, or heavily weakened Pokemon. Moreover, be careful not to use Self-Destruct too early, as you might need Snorlax later.</p>"
      },
      "Reflect": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Body Slam is mandatory, being one of the most difficult attacks to switch into due to its power and paralysis chance. Reflect increases Snorlaxâ€™s physical bulk, giving it the ability to check opposing physical attackers like Rhydon, Golem, Tauros, and opposing Snorlax. With Rest, Snorlax is able to stay healthy to maintain its role throughout the game. Snorlax can either run Earthquake ro Self-Destruct in its last moveslot. Earthquake gives Snorlax coverage to beat Rhydon, Golem, and Gengar. However, Snorlax might lack an offensive presence, especially against Mew and Mewtwo, which love to use it as setup fodder. In order to compensate this lack of power, Snorlax can run Self-Destruct instead of Earthquake. With Self-Destruct, Snorlax threatens almost every Pokemon in the game. However, with this set, Gengar and Rock-types totally wall Snorlax.</p> <p>Reflect Snorlax can repeatedly enter the battle to sponge weaker moves. Since Snorlax carries Body Slam and other physical moves, it's able to put pressure on paralyzed Pokemon. With Reflect, Snorlax becomes the best answer to opposing Snorlax and Tauros, which inflict superficial damage while Reflect is active, and Snorlax strikes them back with a nuclear Body Slam. Mew sets lacking Earthquake are also walled by this Snorlax set, since Mewâ€™s Body Slam inflicts 30% to Snorlax at most. A huge drawback to this set is the passivity of Snorlax once it has used Rest. Like any sleeping Pokemon, Snorlax is fodder for both Amnesia Mewtwo and Swords Dance Mew.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Articunoâ€™s Blizzard is the strongest attack in RBY that is not Explosion or Hyper Beam. It can even outdamage Mewtwoâ€™s mighty Psychic against neutral targets if both are unboosted. Articuno specializes in tearing huge holes in opposing teams, achieving things like 3HKOs on Mew and Snorlax, 2HKOs on Tauros, Exeggutor, and Zapdos, and clean OHKOs on Rhydon and Golem. Blizzard is very easy to spam, as even resistant Pokemon usually take noticeable damage. The move also comes with a nice chance to freeze and disable a foe for the rest of the game. Articuno also is decently bulky and can take a few strong attacks. For example, Tauros's Body Slam usually takes less than a quarter of its health, assuming it does not get a critical hit.</p> <p>However, Articuno's movepool is abysmal, with almost exclusively Ice- and Normal-type moves to choose from. The latter come off of its mediocre Attack stat, leaving it unable to deal with certain bulky Pokemon like Cloyster and Starmie. Articuno is also rather slow, requiring paralysis support or an Agility in order to function effectively against faster Pokemon. Articuno's low Speed also prevents it from functioning as a good lead, as it is outsped by common leads like Gengar, Jynx, and Starmie. These weaknesses can make Articuno hard to fit on teams at times. Still, Articuno's devastating Blizzard will reward you handsomely for the compensation it needs.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Articunoâ€™s barren movepool leaves it with very few other options to choose from. Sky Attack is a decent option, being Articunoâ€™s only Flying-type STAB move and very powerful in its own right. It can be used over Articunoâ€™s Normal-type coverage, dealing huge damage to Chansey and more damage to Mewtwo. However, its two-turn nature makes it less reliable and harder to use than other moves, and Blizzard does more damage to Mewtwo over two turns. Another option is Ice Beam to save precious Blizzard PP in certain situations. Alongside Rest, it can be used to fish for a freeze, with about an 85% chance to get one with all of its PP used. However, Ice Beam Articuno is completely walled by Jynx and Chansey, since it must drop its Normal-type coverage.</p> <p>Articuno can also utilize Reflect, alongside Rest, to become a good tank that easily staves off hits from Tauros, Mew, and Snorlax. Reflect Articuno's main goal is to freeze a foe, so it should run Ice Beam to maximize that chance. If Articuno uses Reflect, it will likely forgo Agility. This means that, while not completely ruined by paralysis, Reflect Articuno is threatened more by it, since it is forced to use Rest and switch out to negate the Speed drop.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Cloyster completely walls Articuno, since it is 4x resistant to Ice, can't be frozen, and has huge Defense to make Hyper Beam deal next to no damage. Similarly, Lapras takes almost zero damage from Blizzard, can't be frozen, and threatens Articuno with Thunderbolt; however, it must watch out for Hyper Beam if it's at low health. Slowbro can easily set up Amnesia on Articuno but fears a stray freeze or critical hits from Blizzard. Starmie can hit Articuno hard with Thunderbolt and heal from Blizzard damage with Recover, but it too must be wary of a freeze.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: While Chansey must be somewhat healthy to switch in on Articuno carrying Hyper Beam, it takes relatively little damage from Blizzard and can scare Articuno away with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave + Seismic Toss. However, Chansey must be cautious to not be frozen in the process. Although rare, Articuno can use Sky Attack on a predicted switch to do massive damage the next turn; however, Chansey will likely just heal the damage off.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon and Zapdos</strong>: Jolteon outspeeds Articuno and will almost always 2HKO with Thunderbolt. Articuno also barely misses the 2HKO with Blizzard, meaning it needs a critical hit or a freeze to win one-on-one. Zapdos, albeit weak to Ice, outspeeds Articuno and threatens to 2HKO it with Thunderbolt while narrowly surviving one Blizzard. Jolteon and Zapdos can also paralyze an Agility-boosted Articuno with Thunder Wave to negate its Speed boost.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: None of Articunoâ€™s attacks hit Mewtwo very hard after it has used Amnesia, except a critical hit Blizzard, and Mewtwo has Recover to heal off any damage it does take. Even unorthodox Mewtwo sets can take at least two Blizzards, allowing Mewtwo to use Thunder Wave on Articuno followed by heavy-hitting moves like Psychic, Thunderbolt, and Self-Destruct.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Mew, Gengar, and Snorlax, among others, can finish off a weakened Articuno with their powerful Explosions even after Articuno has set up with Agility. However, an Articuno using Reflect does not fear them.</p>",

        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Blizzard will hit most everything harder than any other move in the game can, so Articuno will use it the most by far. Hyper Beam gives Articuno better odds to defeat Chansey, as Blizzard + Hyper Beam deals a minimum of 59% of damage to it, while also dealing massive damage to Jynx. Double-Edge can be used if Articuno wants to avoid Hyper Beam recharge mind games, but the recoil damage can easily put it into KO range of other threats. Rest allows Articuno to stick around for much longer and fire off more Blizzards. Agility lets Articuno outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. It also makes Articuno less reliant on team paralysis support.</p> <p>Articuno is best used early-game to rip holes into the opposing team with the sheer power of Blizzard, as even Water-types are afraid of switching into Blizzard because of its freeze chance. Switch Articuno in against weaker attacks, such as Chansey's attacks bar Thunderbolt, or on a predicted Earthquake from opposing Mew, Snorlax, or Tauros. It can also switch in against Earthquake from Rhydon or Golem, but it must be very careful, as Rock Slide from either can OHKO Articuno. However, if it manages to come in on their Earthquakes, Articuno will either OHKO them or force them out and do massive damage to something else. Articuno can also be used to absorb paralysis, since it can use Rest later to heal itself or use Agility to negate the Speed drop. Once Articuno is on the field, it should use Blizzard as often as it can and do as much damage to opposing teams as possible.</p> <p>Articuno greatly appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Exeggutor, Mew, and Zapdos. This allows it to be less reliant on Agility, letting it start doing damage faster and more consistently. However, one must be careful when using Thunder Wave, as a Water-type switching into it becomes immune to freeze, meaning Articuno cannot threaten it at all. Tauros can capitalize on holes Articuno makes in the opponentâ€™s team while supporting it by dealing with opposing Chansey, Starmie, and Jynx. It can also spread paralysis with Body Slam to assist Articuno. Articuno appreciates teammates that can deal with Slowbro, which it is helpless against most of the time. Zapdos, Jolteon, and Thunderbolt Mewtwo can use critical Thunderbolts to bypass Amnesia boosts and do huge damage to Slowbro, while Cloyster, Starmie, Lapras, and Light Screen Chansey wall Slowbro even after it has gained boosts. Light Screen Chansey can also check Amnesia Mewtwo, which Articuno struggles to damage after it has set up. Teams with Articuno tend to be weak to Electric-types, so a check to them like Rhydon, Golem, or Jolteon is appreciated.</p>"

  "Zapdos": {
    "overview": "<p>Zapdos is the premier Electric-type Pokemon of RBY Ubers, featuring impressive base stats and a versatile movepool. Its great bulk makes it especially good at spreading paralysis against common leads and threats like Tauros, Mew, and Mewtwo. Its good critical hit rate and good STAB options are also valuable in order to threaten important Pokemon like Mew, Chansey, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Starmie. However, in a metagame filled with strong attackers, Zapdos find trouble switching in safely, as it is sensitive to Ice-type attacks, which are extremely common, and it lacks recovery. It has little to no chance to beat Ground-types, like Rhydon, Golem, and Sandslash; thus, it absolutely needs its teammates to patch this weakness.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Reflect could be used to better deal with Mew, but Zapdos has no room to use it without sacrificing important moves like Thunder Wave or Agility. Moreover, a paralyzed Mew is put under pressure by Zapdos, and it will want to switch out anyway unless it is already set up at +6. Carving a similar niche, Light Screen can buy time against special attackers like Chansey, Slowbro and a paralyzed Mewtwo. Rest could be a good idea to recover some HP, but similarly to Reflect and Light Screen, it's at the cost of a crucial move, and Zapdos will have little to no room to wake up, as it can't switch in against most attackers. A sleeping Zapdos is also a free opportunity for Mewtwo and Mew to switch in and set up, making it setup fodder for the most important sweepers of the tier. Thunder could be used, because its higher Base Power lets Zapdos KO Tauros after a Thunderbolt, and Thunder can KO Mewtwo with two consecutive critical hits. However, it's a very unreliable strategy due to Thunder's low accuracy. Flash is an option that annoys a lot of paralyzed threat, such as Mewtwo, Mew, and Chansey, and comes in handy once there's only one remaining Pokemon. However, its low accuracy and the lack of room on Zapdos's moveset makes it an unreliable choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Zapdos has no way to deal with Rhydon and Golem. Both can use Zapdos to either set up a Substitute or use Body Slam on the switch and try to paralyze it. While it's way more uncommon and it does not resist Drill Peck, Sandslash can also be an issue, as it can freely switch in on Zapdos's Electric-type moves and poses a threat if Zapdos is paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Not only is Zapdos unable to 3HKO Mewtwo even with a critical hit, but Mewtwo can also use Zapdos as setup fodder with Amnesia and threaten it with Psychic and Ice Beam. Zapdos is also very sensitive to Pokemon like Alakazam, Gengar, Jolteon, and Tauros, which can all threaten it severely with either paralysis or sleep. Mewtwo should take care however, as it cannot paralyze Zapdos with Thunderbolt, and once it is itself paralyzed, physical wallbreakers like Mew, Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon can take advantage of its reduced Speed to put it under pressure with Explosion, Self-Destruct, or Stomp. Paralysis also hinders Zapdos severely if it doesn't have Agility, as slower Pokemon like Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Chansey can threaten it far more easily.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks</strong>: While they can't switch in on Zapdos's STAB moves, Jynx and Cloyster both 2HKO Zapdos with STAB Blizzard and prevent it from switching in. However, they are both likely to use Rest once they have been weakened, so Zapdos can use this opportunity to switch in safely. Zapdos also fears Ice Beam from threats it is supposed to deal with, such as Chansey, Mewtwo, and Slowbro, which all deal massive damage to it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey can shrug off a lot of Zapdos's attacks thanks to its high Special Defense and Soft-Boiled and can cripple it with paralysis or sleep. However, it cannot infinitely switch into Zapdos's attacks due to Drill Peck's high damage output and critical hit chance.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Mixed Attacker": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Thunderbolt and Drill Peck are Zapdos's best STAB options, and they are difficult to switch into thanks to Zapdos's high Speed, granting it a good critical hit rate. In particular, Zapdos easily 2HKO Water-types like Slowbro and Starmie, and has a chance to OHKO Cloyster with Thunderbolt. It has a 54.5% chance to 2HKO non-Reflect Chansey with one critical hit Drill Peck and a solid chance to KO Exeggutor with a critical hit after slight chip damage. It also has a possible 3HKO against Mew and Snorlax, which becomes guaranteed if it critically hits one Thunderbolt. Thunder Wave is an excellent tool to hobble most threats, and lets Zapdos spam its STAB moves even more. Paralysis also provides excellent support to teammates such as Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax. Agility suppresses the Speed drop from paralysis and lets Zapdos outrun the entire metagame, including Mewtwo and Alakazam. Against a paralyzed threat like Mew and Mewtwo, Agility also reapplies paralysis's Speed drop, helping slow teammates like paralyzed Snorlax to menace them. Hyper Beam can be used instead to beat Chansey and Jynx that would like to force Zapdos out; Chansey is left in KO range of Hyper Beam after a critical hit Drill Peck, and Zapdos has a 88.89% chance to KO Jynx with Drill Peck followed by Hyper Beam.</p> <p>Zapdos is usually seen as a mid- to late-game wallbreaker thanks to its ability to spread paralysis against staples like Tauros, Chansey, and Mewtwo. Its high critical hit rate and high offensive stats also make Zapdos very good at pressuring paralyzed foes; for example, spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave on predicted switch-ins is especially useful against Chansey, as it is one of the most common switch-ins to Zapdos, but critical hits, full paralysis chances, and low damage output from Chansey grant Zapdos far more chances to win the duel. Moreover, typical status absorbers like Starmie and Chansey cannot handle Zapdos very well; thanks to its sheer power and STAB moves, it can take advantage of them as well as Rest users such as Slowbro. This is essential because Zapdos has no way to recover its HP, so each hit it takes is permanent. The pressure Zapdos puts on the enemy team thanks to its high damage output and ability to spread paralysis can force fairly predictable switch-ins like Rhydon, Golem, Snorlax, or a paralyzed Pokemon, which can be punished by teammates like Mewtwo, Exeggutor, Mew, and Tauros. Paralyzing Mewtwo with Thunder Wave can also be a strategy to break it when Zapdos is paired with physical wallbreakers like Mew, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Stomp Tauros. Gengar is a notable teammate, as it synergizes well with Zapdos; as a lead, Gengar can switch into Zapdos to scout moves from Tauros. Zapdos can then proceed to threaten it with Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave. As a pair, they can also wall most Reflect + Swords Dance variants of Mew, as Gengar and Zapdos are respectively immune to Normal- and Ground-type attacks. With their respective immunities, Gengar and Zapdos can even play around Earthquake + Body Slam Mew to some degree, forcing it to predict correctly and threatening it with a status, whether it be Zapdos's paralysis or Gengar's sleep. Earthquake + Explosion Mew is hindered to an even more extreme degree, as it forces Mew to switch out or to try to trade with Explosion, allowing more space for powerful sweepers like Mewtwo and Mew.</p> <p>Zapdos can also be used as lead. Its Speed lets it outrun Jynx, while Thunder Wave and its STAB combination lets it threaten most common leads, including Chansey, Tauros, and Alakazam. It's important to notice that Drill Peck can never OHKO Jynx even with a critical hit, and that Gengar is a faster lead, meaning Zapdos can be put to sleep easily by these two threats via Lovely Kiss and Hypnosis, respectively. Hyper Beam is a good option for this set, as Drill Peck + Hyper Beam has a strong chance to KO Jynx, and a critical hit Drill Peck + Hyper Beam will always KO Chanseyâ€”both Jynx and Chansey are likely to stay in on Zapdos to put it to sleep.</p>"

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Everyone knows Dragoniteâ€™s claim to fame. While a wide move pool, a base stat total bested only by that of Mewtwo, and a unique Dragon typing are all distinguishing features, Dragoniteâ€™s true niche rests in its access to Wrap. With an unparalleled Attack stat and two excellent speed control options in Thunder Wave and Agility, Dragonite can immobilize and whittle away at its foes. In Ubers, Dragonite is much the same frustrating but effective Pokemon it is in other tiers.</p> <p>Dragonite is a powerful pivot and potential sweeper with a lot of utility options. It can meticulously prepare favorable endgames against paralyzed and slow teams for its teammates to sweep, or it can even painfully choke out entire teams itself. A wide pool of coverage moves makes Dragonite unpredictable and quite difficult to wall. Its Flying typing is also quite nice for slowing down Earthquake users, most notably Mew. Itâ€™s not terribly uncommon for Mew to run Earthquake as its only reliable attacking move, meaning that Dragonite can wall some variants indefinitely.</p> <p>Despite many positive traits, Dragonite has many limitations that keep it from dominating the tier. For starters, Dragonite relies heavily on paralysis to function. If Dragonite is slower than its foe, it cannot use Wrap safely. It is very vulnerable to paralysis itself, as it becomes incapable of using Wrap effectively or reliably given its already imperfect accuracy. Its typing, while useful for some matchups, also means that Ice-type moves from common Pokemon like Mewtwo are a terror. Thus, Dragonite requires strategic play to position such that it can actually make its way through teams with little risk. Another obvious issue is its reliance on Wrap, which, even in the best of circumstances, can miss and immediately result in Dragonite failing to pivot or sweep.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Dragonite has a lot of interesting moves that it can try, but few are practical and better than what can be found in the main set. Thunderbolt is likely Dragoniteâ€™s next best move, as it gives it a very strong option against Slowbro, Starmie, and Cloyster. Dragonite is not extremely likely to face these Pokemon, so Thunderbolt has fairly limited utility. Thunderbolt generally needs to be used alongside Blizzard so Dragonite will not struggle with Exeggutor or Ground-type Pokemon.</p> <p>Fire Blast is a novel option primarily because of its ability to burn foes. In addition to cutting the Attack stat of a Pokemon, the extra damage from burn synergizes well with Wrap. Notably, a burned Gengar can no longer stall out Dragonite's Wrap, as the damage will eventually cause it to faint, even though Wrap itself is doing no damage. The move is often outclassed by Blizzard, which hits a better array of targets and has a higher accuracy.</p> <p>Double-Edge can be an alternative to Hyper Beam that trades the higher Base Power for greater accuracy, more PP, and no risky recharge turn. The move is rather uncommon, as the drop in power is very noticeable.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves</strong>: Using Ice-type moves, Mewtwo, Starmie, Jynx, Lapras, Cloyster, and Articuno all have at least a chance to OHKO Dragonite outright. Aside from Lapras and Cloyster, they are all faster than Dragonite, meaning Dragonite cannot safely use Wrap against most users of Ice-type moves. Other Pokemon like Tauros, Chansey, and occasionally Snorlax can all 2HKO Dragonite with their common Ice-type moves as well. Tauros is particularly dangerous, as a critical hit will take Dragonite out immediately.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralysis often hampers Dragonite, as it heavily drops the consistency of Wrap. Faster users of Thunder Wave, such as Alakazam, Starmie, Mew, Zapdos, and Jolteon can all immediately threaten Dragonite. Other users of paralysis moves, like Chansey, Slowbro, and Exeggutor can all also heavily punish Dragonite on a switch or if Wrap misses. Users of Body Slam, especially fast ones, can also threaten Dragonite in a pinch.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that Resist Wrap</strong>: Gengar will generally beat Dragonite in a straight head-to-head, especially if Dragonite does not have Blizzard. Furthermore, Gengar is quite good at getting Dragonite to waste Wrap PP due to its immunity to its damage. While Surf and, to a lesser extent, Blizzard can threaten Rhydon and Golem, their resistance to Wrap can help them stall out Wrap PP as well. Both can also switch into Hyper Beam to punish it.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Wrap": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Wrap is Dragoniteâ€™s most important move, giving it the ability to both pivot and sweep. Wrap enables it to pressure slower foes like Chansey, Snorlax, and paralyzed Pokemon with chip damage and then switch out to a potent partner, such as Tauros, Rhydon, or Zapdos to finish the job without either Pokemon taking damage in the process. In general, Dragonite thrives on paralysis support and loathes being paralyzed. As such, Dragonite tends to favor the late-game, steadily mounting damage after paralysis has been spread or faster Pokemon have been knocked out.</p> <p>Teammates can spread paralysis for Dragonite, but Dragonite can also be quite good at spreading paralysis itself with Thunder Wave. Because Dragonite can theoretically use Agility at any time to set up for a sweep, few Pokemon will feel comfortable switching out against it and will often try to attack it first, even if a different move or switch seems likely. Additionally, trying to block paralysis by switching in an already paralyzed Pokemon is largely ineffective, as Dragonite can simply use Wrap with little risk. In most cases, Dragonite will aim to paralyze Pokemon that are quick and threatening but canâ€™t consistently paralyze or KO it in return. This includes Pokemon like Tauros and certain variants of Mew and Mewtwo. This creates a stronger position for both Dragonite and offensive teammates. While Dragonite must avoid paralysis to use Wrap consistently, it may occasionally risk trading paralysis with high value targets that may otherwise be dangerous in the endgame, such as Mew, Zapdos, and Alakazam, if it must. Moreover, Dragonite will be more willing to accept paralysis if the opposing Mew only has Earthquake as an attacking move, as Dragonite will still be able to fill an important role in checking it even after being slowed down.</p> <p>Using Agility allows Dragonite to become a powerful sweeper capable of outspeeding the entire metagame. With Wrap and strong attacks, a Dragonite can wipe out fairly healthy teams by itself after using Agility. Agility can also reverse the Speed-dropping effects of paralysis, but the 25% chance of immobilization is still very problematic if Dragonite plans on using Wrap at any point. The challenge with Agility, aside from Wrap misses, is finding an opportunity to use it safely. Dragonite canâ€™t comfortably set up on many common Pokemon in Ubers, as almost all of them have at least a chance to paralyze or KO it. This means Dragonite will most often be clicking Agility when risking a critical hit or paralysis chance from Body Slam is worth it, when the opponent is expected to switch out, or when the opposing Pokemon is asleep or frozen. Agility can be used with or without Thunder Wave; while Agility Dragonite does appreciate access to two attacking moves, the utility of Thunder Wave, sometimes even after Agility has been used, is too much to give up. While Agility is generally considered as an option to strengthen Wrap, it can instead occasionally be used to strengthen Thunder Wave when spreading paralysis is more important than chip damage or pivoting. This is most applicable if Dragonite is expected to check Earthquake Mew. While Dragonite will likely take a Thunder Wave in this scenario, it may be able to paralyze Mew and threaten the Pokemon that will switch in after. Agility can be used safely against Mew to give itself the Speed advantage against dangerous Pokemon looking to switch in, such as Tauros, Mewtwo, Rhydon, and Golem.</p> <p>Dragonite can round out its set with one or two of the many strong and diverse attacks in its arsenal. Surf has decent base power, hits every Pokemon in the game, and has a fair amount of PP, making it one of the safest choices for Dragonite. Surf also instantly takes out Rhydon and Golem, which otherwise take only a little damage from Wrap and can potentially PP stall it. Blizzard hits a bit harder than Surf but is less reliable. It is notably Dragoniteâ€™s strongest move against Exeggutor and Gengar, the latter of which can be quite difficult for Dragonite to handle given it takes no damage from Wrap at all. Hyper Beam is Dragoniteâ€™s strongest move and thus an excellent choice for finishing off foes. As with Blizzard though, Hyper Beam is not overly reliable, and it can also land Dragonite in a bad situation if it fails to KO. Body Slam is a reliable and fairly strong move with a good chance to paralyze foes, making it an excellent option to punish switches. It is, however, not the best for finishing Pokemon off during a sweep and it doesnâ€™t help much against Rhydon, Golem, and most notably Gengar. This means pairing Body Slam with Hyper Beam is generally not viable.</p> <p>Dragonite teams well with Pokemon that can spread paralysis effectively, such as Slowbro and Thunder Wave Mew. The strong offensive capabilities and boosting moves of these Pokemon can make blocking paralysis quite difficult. Thunder Wave Mewtwo can accomplish this as well, though the opportunity cost of running that set is often higher. Because Dragonite and its common teammates tend to spread paralysis well, offensive Pokemon tend to be good team options. Slow Pokemon like Rhydon and Golem appreciate gaining a Speed advantage after paralysis. Tauros becomes a lot more threatening after its teammates spread paralysis because the free turns from full paralysis can often allow Tauros to break through powerful foes like Mew and Mewtwo. Tauros can attempt to capitalize even further with Stomp. Paralysis and chip damage from Wrap can also do a lot to support Mew and Mewtwo. Pokemon like Mewtwo and Chansey become significantly less capable of switching into a boosted Mewtwo if they are paralyzed and have sustained some Wrap damage.</p>"

  "Mewtwo": {
    "overview": "<p>Feast your eyes on the most destructive Pokemon in any tier in history. Not one stat Mewtwo has can be called bad or even average, including the highest Special in the game and a tie with Aerodactyl and Jolteon for second-highest Speed. It's not just an offensive juggernaut: Mewtwo's bulk is absolutely titanic, stomaching even blows from the mighty Snorlax and Tauros. Its Psychic typing comes into this as well, giving it effectively no type-based weaknesses to exploit. Because of these qualities, taking Mewtwo down often requires a concentrated effort from multiple Pokemon. As if that wasn't enough, it has a plethora of fantastic moves, such as Amnesia, Recover, STAB Psychic, Self-Destruct, and more. If given even a single turn of breathing room, Mewtwo can immediately take over a game. There is no true way to defeat Mewtwo head-on other than sending in your own, statusing it, or getting plain lucky. Thus, many RBY Ubers games are decided by a Mewtwo mirror match. Mewtwo was designed to be the world's strongest Pokemon, and Game Freak certainly succeeded: Mewtwo has zero inarguable flaws and is an automatic pick on any RBY Ubers team that aims to win.</p> <p>Mewtwo's only arguable flaws stem from it being quite literally too powerful for a Game Boy to process. A maximum DV and EV Mewtwo can end up overflowing its Special if it's boosted to +4 or higher and subsequently sustains a Special drop, minimizing its Special and leaving it effortless to KO. Similarly, Mewtwo's Speed gives it a very high critical hit rateâ€”25.39%â€”which, combined with the fact that critical hits ignore the attacker's offensive boosts, means that +3 or higher Mewtwo will sometimes deal less damage than expected. Finally, while Mewtwo is incredible, it will always have some check it has trouble beating outside of brute force, as it often only has two moveslots available after Amnesia and Recover. However, brute force remains a fine option in a tight spot because Mewtwo is an utter juggernaut.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>To prevent Mewtwo's Special from overflowing, 8 EVs and 13 DVs in Special can make the stat 341 on any given Mewtwo set, which amounts to 1023 at +4, albeit capped at 999 in practice. This is known as the \"SafeTwo\" spread, pioneered by Enigami. Doing this, however, severely cuts into Mewtwo's bulk, making critical hits from special attacks deal noticeably higher damage. Thus, using this spread depends on whether your Mewtwo set aims for short-term reward or maximum mileage throughout a game.</p> <p>If a move is good in RBY, there is a good chance that Mewtwo learns it. Customizing Mewtwo usually consists of patching up offensive holes in a team while ensuring it doesn't leave itself open to its checks; in other words, without compromising its power level or making it more situational. Generally, Mewtwo's only free moveslot is one of its two attacking ones, as Amnesia and Recover are pivotal to its success.</p> <p>Rest is an interesting choice over Recover, especially on Barrier + Amnesia sets, which generally aim to last as long as possible, as it stalls for three turns at the cost of 1 PP, effectively amounting to 48 PP. It also comes with erasing the Speed drop from paralysis when switching out, though this can make Mewtwo somewhat difficult to wake up later if it hasn't woken up prior to switching; this is because Mewtwo regularly attracts self-KO move users like Snorlax and Golem, which it can't contest when asleep. Even worse, Swords Dance Mew can often set up and break through Mewtwo right away if not chipped or paralyzed, so it's recommended to incapacitate it with a teammate first. Rest also notably removes Mewtwo's paralysis, and paralysis arguably helps with PP stalling more, as it ensures it doesn't remain passive for extended periods of time.</p> <p>Mewtwo can potentially make use of the strong elemental attacks of RBYâ€”Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Thunderâ€”but they come with significant PP issues. Mewtwo mirrors often result in both losing a very large amount of PP, and putting your own at such a deficit right away frequently results in a loss. Additionally, each comes with its own disadvantage from a status perspective: Fire Blast's burn chance means it can thaw frozen Pokemon, while Blizzard and Thunder have less overall chance to inflict status because of their lower PP. Because Mewtwo often needs the superior status chances, the increased damage output is often just not worth it. This is to say nothing of the accuracy issues, which decrease the consistency of the one Pokemon that you can't afford to be inconsistent. However, the increased damage still leaves them situationally acceptable on teams able to PP stall Mewtwo without using their own Mewtwo; for example, +2 Blizzard or Fire Blast can OHKO Exeggutor, and an unboosted Thunder KOes Cloyster with even minor chip damage.</p> <p>Mewtwo's Attack is very usable, which makes Body Slam and Hyper Beam seem enticing. Body Slam can allow Mewtwo to spread paralysis while dealing physical damage, but compared to everything else Mewtwo can dish out, it's generally unimpressive. Hyper Beam is particularly interesting, as Mewtwo can then KO Chansey from a minimum of 44.6%. Against Mewtwo, a critical hit deals slightly more damage than Self-Destruct. Thus, it can be used as a substitute for BooM2 sets to try and get opposing Mewtwo in range for a critical hit or regular Hyper Beam instead of Self-Destruct. However, against any non-Psychic resistant Pokemon, including Chansey, the damage dealt is almost the same as +4 Psychic. Further, Psychic comes with the bonuses of not requiring a recharge, Special drops to further increase damage, and more attacking PP. Ergo, the only non-opposing Mewtwo reason to use Hyper Beam is for a better Light Screen Chansey matchup, which, while common, isn't omnipresent. If you're looking for a physical option, Submission is often the superior choice for hitting Chansey harder than Hyper Beam and having a significant PP advantage for Mewtwo.</p> <p>Mewtwo has fantastic physical bulk, making Counter appear viable. However, Counter is often best placed on Chansey, a Pokemon with higher potential damage that often draws physical attackers like Snorlax in more consistently. Mewtwo has little opportunity to use the attack, as it's often faced with opposing Mewtwo or Chansey before it even gets the chance to use it. Ergo, should these matchups come down to PP stalling, there is a very high chance that Counter will be revealed by force, ruining the gimmick entirely.</p> <p>BooM2 sets can arguably run Seismic Toss to make KOing opposing Mewtwo with Self-Destruct easier, making it a much more effective lure. However, fitting this into the set is extremely difficult and worsens its matchups against essentially anything other than Mewtwo, which it can't often afford. It's also possible to drop Amnesia entirely on these types of sets to add more coverage options or secure a slot for Recover, but this has seen little success.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: Mewtwo is arguably the best check to itself. The combination of Amnesia and Recover means your standard Amnesia set has a lot of trouble breaking through, requiring three critical hits in a row with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam to get the KO. Using Self-Destruct is one way to attempt to break through an opposing Mewtwo, but this requires sacrificing your own, and even then you only OHKO with a critical hit. This means even using Self-Destruct requires you to have the team support and setup necessary to finish Mewtwo off. Another option is having enough PP to successfully stall Mewtwo out; Submission is a great way to accomplish this, thanks to the 48 PP it offers. However, it oftentimes simply comes down to which Mewtwo will be frozen first, as getting a freeze often leaves nothing left to handle a boosted Mewtwo.</p> <p><strong>Freezing</strong>: Thanks to freeze being the virtual equivalent of a KO, freezing Mewtwo is often the best way to deal with it. Common Pokemon like Jynx, Starmie, Slowbro, and Chansey run Ice Beam or Blizzard, which both carry a 10.1% freeze chance. Additionally, these Pokemon are typically able to take a hit from even a boosted Mewtwo, meaning every turn spent against them carries a degree of risk. Managing to freeze the opponent's Mewtwo is a way to gain massive momentum, freeing up your own Mewtwo or Slowbro to wreak havoc with their biggest check out of the way.</p> <p><strong>Light Screen Chansey</strong>: As a testament to just how powerful Mewtwo is, the phenomenal special wall Chansey must run Light Screen to truly be a check. However, it's one of the most consistent Mewtwo checks in the game. A Mewtwo boosted to the 999 cap only possesses a 17.4% chance to 4HKO with Psychic through Light Screen. With Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, it's only a possible 6HKO. Chansey is one of the most consistent methods of overflowing a +6 Mewtwo's Special as well, using Psychic's Special drop chance and subsequently forcing a switch. Additionally, Chansey often has a significant PP advantage. This means Chansey can wall Mewtwo and force it to burn precious PP while healing off the damage it deals. However, even Chansey isn't safe. Psychic's 33.2% Special drop can degrade Light Screen and make Chansey much more vulnerable, making it arguably a temporary solution. Submission also 2HKOes it 86.7% of the time, making for a great anti-Chansey measure. Chansey is also a magnet for freeze attempts, which can be either a sigh of relief for your own Mewtwo or a catastrophic situation depending on your team's defensive integrity and Mewtwo set.</p> <p><strong>Mew</strong>: Mew has some interesting tricks that can allow it to check, set up on, or otherwise handle Mewtwo. With paralysis support and Swords Dance, it can set up to +4 Attack and then 2HKO with Earthquake while virtually never being 3HKOed in return by 999 Special Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. At +6, Mew is capable of OHKOing Mewtwo with Hyper Beam. Alternatively, some Mew variants simply opt to use Swords Dance and then Explosion to erase Mewtwo from the battle without any doubt. Defensively, Mew can use Transform to copy Mewtwo's stats and moves. Transform leaves Mew vulnerable for a turn, but the player gains crucial information about the opposing Mewtwo's set, walls it completely, and gains 5 PP for each move it holds. This 5 PP resets each time Mew uses Transform, meaning it is able to PP stall the opposing Mewtwo. It's not like Transform Mew only has the opposing Mewtwo's attacks either, as it can run other options to cripple it prior. These include Thunder Wave, Explosion to take a big chunk out of its health, Reflect to increase defensive integrity while transformed, and Soft-Boiled to stay healthy. Unless Mewtwo lands multiple critical hits or inflicts status, Mew is able to come in and check it somewhat consistently. However, Mew is far from an ironclad Mewtwo check; without paralysis support, Mewtwo is able to muscle through Mew on most occasions through brute force, as well as often ruining it completely with an untimely freeze.</p> <p><strong>PP Stall</strong>: Stalling Mewtwo out of PP is another way to deal with it, usually attempted with your own Mewtwo or Light Screen Chansey. Once it runs out of attacking PP, it's little more than a status absorber. However, accomplishing this is much easier said than done. With its monstrous Special, critical hit rate, and coverage, PP stall can sometimes be in vain, as crucial team members can fall to a freeze or massive damage. If Mewtwo lacks Thunderbolt, Slowbro is able to stand in its way, stalling PP while setting up its own brutal sweep. Thanks to its own Amnesia and Rest, Slowbro has a good chance to win one-on-one as well.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis</strong>: Paralyzing Mewtwo can open opportunities for powerful Pokemon such as Snorlax, Tauros, Mew, Golem, and Rhydon. Getting in on a paralyzed Mewtwo and being able to fire off big hits or threaten Explosion or Self-Destruct often forces it out. However, paralyzing Mewtwo can actually benefit it, as it can now no longer be frozen or put to sleep, and skipping turns with paralysis lets Mewtwo PP stall more effectively. Generally, Mewtwo despises being paralyzed early on, as it loses momentum against Mew, Snorlax, and Mewtwo specifically tailored to break through opposing Mewtwo. However, later on, when Mew and Snorlax have likely been taken out, Mewtwo tends to appreciate paralysis more. If you have the tools on your team to take advantage of a paralyzed Mewtwo early on, then it is absolutely worth it, as finding a way to break the opposing Mewtwo without risking your own is a key way to win consistently in RBY Ubers.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro is a fairly notorious check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo, being able to set up freely or even PP stall it if all goes well. The only risk to Slowbro in this scenario is a freeze from Ice Beam, which can be somewhat made up for with Rest preventing further status. Slowbro can also muscle past non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo through Thunder Wave and +6 Surf, which will eventually 4HKO a +6 Mewtwo and deal mortal damage otherwise. However, if Mewtwo has Thunderbolt, Slowbro will be 3HKOed even at +6 if Mewtwo is also at +6.</p> <p><strong>Self-KO Moves</strong>: The sheer power of Self-Destruct and Explosion makes them common methods of dispatching Mewtwo, primarily because it's often the highest-value Pokemon on its team and normally the most threatening. These strategies are at their most potent when Mewtwo is paralyzed, as it ends up becoming slower than the strongest users of self-KO moves in the game, namely Snorlax and Golem. While not even a STAB Self-Destruct from Snorlax will OHKO Mewtwo, it will often leave it in a position to be revenge killed by Pokemon like Tauros. Snorlax can also use Body Slam and then Self-Destruct, which is a guaranteed KO. Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets are often expressly made to trade against opposing Mewtwo too, and it's often paired with deadly sweepers like Slowbro, which become significantly more threatening with Mewtwo off the table. While their Explosions are quite weak, Gengar and Electrode also tend to Explode against Mewtwo, coming very close to OHKOing it on a critical hit.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mewtwo's defining set makes full use of the incredible Amnesia. With its astronomical Special, Amnesia leaves it almost impossible to switch into until it's scouted and just as hard to KO with special moves. A Mewtwo boosted up to the maximum of 999 Special can only fall to three or more critical hit special attacks. This tremendous bulk and Recover allow Mewtwo to stay healthy while hammering away. However, after these two mandatory moves, Mewtwo's coverage is impressive and has multiple viable options, making it a multifaceted threat able to plow through just about everything. The coverage options you choose will largely decide what your Mewtwo's primary role is.</p> <p>Mewtwo's STAB Psychic is one of the scariest no-drawback moves in the game. A 33.2% chance to drop Special as an added bonus can allow Mewtwo to muscle through something like Light Screen Chansey. The Special drops can also be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing paralyzed Mewtwo to outspeed an opposing paralyzed Mewtwo or incapacitate it for something else to handle; because of this, a paralyzed Mewtwo isn't out of the game just yet. Finally, Psychic has a significant benefit in causing an opposing +4 Mewtwo's Special to overflow if it doesn't have a \"SafeTwo\" stat spread, which consists of 13 DVs and 8 EVs in Special to ensure it starts at 341. Unfortunately, with the bevy of Psychic-types in Ubers, Mewtwo's targets are often resistant and thus take Psychic decently before striking back. Common examples include Exeggutor, Slowbro, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo.</p> <p>Slotting in Thunderbolt gives Mewtwo some unique coverage possibilities while bringing its PP up to 104. Mewtwo is now able to easily beat Slowbro; if both boost to the 999 cap, Mewtwo still 3HKOes with Thunderbolt, and that's to say nothing of its 25.39% chance to OHKO with a critical hit. Thunderbolt also gives Mewtwo access to paralysis. While the odds are slim, this can help Mewtwo and teammates immensely against opposing Mewtwo and Chansey. You're statistically likely to get at least one instance of paralysis from Thunderbolt's full PP, so it's fair to fish for it. On the downside, using it in the third moveslot means Mewtwo lets Exeggutor in for free, as it's only 3HKOed by a 999 Special Psychic from full HP; it can then use this opportunity to spread status or use Explosion. You also lose out on the potential to freeze by forgoing Ice Beam, which can really hurt against Chansey, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo. Also, paralyzed Mewtwo can inadvertently allow Rhydon a free switch should it use Thunderbolt or Recover, which puts it in a very difficult spot, as Rhydon can fish for Substitute on full paralysis and 3HKO with Earthquake from there.</p> <p>Ice Beam slots in nicely alongside Psychic, and the biggest reason is the 10.1% freeze chance. While the coverage is nice to help deal with Exeggutor, Ice Beam's primary draw is to freeze opposing Mewtwo or, less ideally, one of its major checks, like Chansey. This can open up the entire game and oftentimes win it outright. However, Slowbro is able to soak up this set's hits and use Amnesia, Thunder Wave, and Rest to have a good chance to beat Mewtwo head-on. Additionally, while Starmie doesn't pose much of a threat offensively, it can also paralyze Mewtwo or attempt to freeze it; it can take at least one hit from a Mewtwo with this coverage boosted up to 999. Opponents must be careful though, as +4 Psychic will 2HKO Starmie. Another drawback to this set is the mere 96 total PP, which can often become crucial when battling against other Mewtwo and trying to break down Chansey. This makes freezing the wrong Pokemon possibly quite deadly, as opposing Mewtwo tend to win from there through PP stall. When using Psychic + Ice Beam, it's best to avoid paralyzing the opposing Mewtwo in favor of winning by PP stall or freezing it.</p> <p>Even without a STAB option, Mewtwo still threatens the entire metagame with BoltBeam coverage. Instead of using its STAB Psychic, it can combine the coverage and benefits of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt while reaching 104 PP. While lacking Psychic means it no longer KOes the powerful and Self-Destruct-using Snorlax after some chip damage, the coverage allows Mewtwo to deal with almost everything else. It gains the advantage against both Slowbro and Exeggutor while bearing a 10.1% freeze chance for opposing Mewtwo, Mew, or Chansey. Since it handles almost the entire metagame besides these three Pokemon and Snorlax, it can blow the game wide open by freezing one of them. One drawback to this set is that, if your opponent has both Chansey and Mewtwo active, it will only be able to take out one while being walled by the other because of relying on a freeze. However, you can use Thunderbolt to attempt paralysis, meaning Mewtwo isn't completely shut down and can still help its team against these threats. Boosted up to 999, Mewtwo is able to OHKO Slowbro, Exeggutor, Tauros, and Starmie to name a few, making this combination a Swiss Army knife that is very difficult to deal with.</p> <p>A unique option that Mewtwo can run is Submission. First, Submission holds a whopping 48 PP, bringing the total to 128 if using Ice Beam or 136 if using Thunderbolt. This lets Mewtwo win PP wars against opposing Mewtwo consistently while having the advantage against Chansey. One must be careful of it getting frozen though. Submission destroys Light Screen Chansey, one of Mewtwo's most common adversaries, without risking PP stall. Submission Mewtwo has an 86.7% chance to 2HKO, and with its high critical hit ratio, it has a decent chance to OHKO. The primary drawback of this set is only running one special coverage option. Running Thunderbolt is the most common, as this allows Mewtwo to beat all of its most common checks, these being Chansey via Submission, Slowbro via Thunderbolt, and opposing Mewtwo via PP stall. However, this set struggles against Exeggutor and Rhydon, often allowing Explosion or status from the former and giving a free switch in to the latter. Ice Beam can be chosen over Thunderbolt to alleviate this, making the set weak to Slowbro but gaining the advantage against Exeggutor and Rhydon. Having a freeze chance is never bad either. Psychic, on the other hand, should not be chosen here; alongside Submission, it simply leaves Mewtwo vulnerable against too many common Psychic-types.</p>"
      },
      "BooM2 (Self-Destruct)": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>By bluffing the standard set with Amnesia and your chosen coverage option, this Mewtwo can lure in the opposing Mewtwo, occasionally paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and then use Self-Destruct after some chip damage. Self-Destruct also comes with the bonus of beating set-up Slowbro, which is otherwise a common check to the set.</p> <p>Self-Destruct will KO opposing Mewtwo from 52.2% minimum, which means two uses of +2 Thunderbolt will set it up. It's recommended to run Thunderbolt, as well as paralysis support, to make it harder for the opposing Mewtwo to heal its way out of Self-Destruct range with Recover. Other options tend to only make this set worse, as matching up worse against Slowbro usually forces Mewtwo to use Self-Destruct. The normally ubiquitous Recover can be dropped for Thunder Wave, which guarantees that Mewtwo can use Self-Destruct before the opposing one can heal out of KO range. Naturally, this also means Mewtwo itself should avoid getting paralyzed whenever possible, or it becomes very difficult to succeed.</p> <p>This set carries inherent risks, as Self-Destruct is naturally inconsistent: it being absorbed by Gengar or Rhydon can be a game loss, and less common Mewtwo sets using Flash or even Barrier match up extremely well against it. However, it remains viable for the sheer reward the trade can provide. If supported by Seismic Toss Chansey, the set can be more consistent at securing trades, as two uses of Seismic Toss can also put opposing Mewtwo in KO range.</p>"
      },
      "Staller": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mewtwo can focus on stalling, which can be approached in two ways: Flash or Barrier. While they play differently in practice, the aim is very similar, that being stonewalling opposing Mewtwo. Because of the long-term role of these sets, the \"SafeTwo\" Special stat is highly recommended; the given spread gives Mewtwo a Special stat of 341, which ensures that it hits 1023 Special at +4, meaning that a Special drop does not trigger an overflow. Mewtwo's attacking option on this type of set largely depends on the rest of the team, and it only has one, so care should be taken. Thunderbolt hits Mew and Slowbro while giving Mewtwo the best PP advantage; however, Rhydon becomes extremely threatening, especially if running Flash. Alternatively, Ice Beam lets Mewtwo muscle past Exeggutor and Rhydon, as well as providing the option of freezing the opposing Mewtwo, possibly cutting off the Flash interaction early. STAB Psychic can serve as a generic option on Barrier sets, being the strongest attack Mewtwo has and also giving it the best shot of beating Snorlax before it paralyzes with Body Slam or uses Self-Destruct.</p> <p>The Flash approach aims to gain the most advantage in the Mewtwo mirror match without making a trade, so it should be kept in waiting until that opportunity arises. It works most effectively against Ice Beam Mewtwo, as Flash can decrease the opposing Mewtwo's chance of freezing your own while also giving a PP advantage against all standard sets, totaling to 112 PP with Psychic or Ice Beam, or 120 if running Thunderbolt. This forces the opponent to either switch out and risk losing a Pokemon or stay in and inevitably lose if enough accuracy drops set in. Attacking the opposing Mewtwo is generally unnecessary; stalling its attacking PP is all you need, leaving yourself with a fully boosted Mewtwo to wreak havoc thereafter. This set isn't wholly opposed to being paralyzedâ€”skipping turns is arguably beneficial once the accuracy drops have piled on, though paralysis does drastically decrease its consistency prior to that.</p> <p>The combination of Barrier and Amnesia can be used instead to turn Mewtwo into a sweeper that also has a large PP advantage against opposing Mewtwo, which can be 112 PP with Recover added on, not factoring in offensive options. This alone is enough to PP stall any standard Mewtwo set, allowing you to end up with a fully boosted Mewtwo by the time they run out. It is strongly recommended to get this Mewtwo paralyzed as soon as possible, as this further improves its PP stalling capabilities and ensures it cannot get frozen later. With the assistance of Barrier, exploding on Mewtwo becomes an impossibility without something like Swords Dance + Explosion Mew, which forces the opposing team to PP stall it themselves. Even the mighty Snorlax, with the strongest physical move in STAB Self-Destruct, rarely hits for even a quarter of +6 Barrier Mewtwo's health. This set works especially well against Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets, as they cannot afford a PP war and lose the ability to KO it from half HP due to the Defense boost. While still vulnerable to critical hits, Mewtwo is very difficult to KO after boosting both Defense and Special, often surviving for astonishing periods of time.</p> <p>The main drawback to stall-centric Mewtwo sets is that they often require some momentum to function; Flash usually takes multiple hits to begin making your own Mewtwo difficult to hit, and Barrier sets add more turns of setup time. Ergo, any unfortunate luck during these sequences is often devastating, and making your own Mewtwo less consistent must be for good reason. Additionally, because of the aforementioned lack of coverage and specialized nature, stall-centric Mewtwo sets often end up being weaker to Pokemon other than opposing Mewtwo. Depending on the offensive option of choice, Mewtwo can become weak to any of Chansey, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Transform Mew. Slowbro is the most notable if not running Thunderbolt, being able to accumulate a sizable PP advantage through Rest while having high enough damage output to muscle past with repeated full paralysis. If running Thunderbolt, though, Light Screen Chansey becomes a big threat if not paralyzed, possessing a PP advantage and enough bulk to shrug off what Mewtwo throws at it. Regardless of offensive option and Mewtwo's sheer power, though, Barrier Mewtwo often has limited attacking PP to punish switch stalling, which is worsened when paralyzed. Ergo, teams using this set should make up for its shortcomings. Explosion Mew, Golem, and Self-Destruct Snorlax make fine choices, often making it easier to break through Chansey and Slowbro. Zapdos or Jolteon can also be effectiveâ€”especially the latter, which tends to have a more consistent Chansey matchup and has a high critical hit rate to break through Slowbro. Slowbro is also an excellent partner, profiting greatly from a Thunderbolt Mewtwo being incapacitated to set up and sweep later.</p>"

  "Mew": {
    "overview": "<p>Mew is recommended to feature on all of your RBY Ubers teams and is one of only two Uber Pokemonâ€”Pokemon banned from standard first generation play dating back to the earliest Nintendo sponsored tournaments. The mythical Pokemon may learn every TM, but it is uncommon in high-level play to see it without Swords Dance. Mew is the tier's premier physical sweeper; its base 100 stats all around let it outspeed Jynx and Speed tie with Zapdos, have an unboosted Attack stat equivalent to Tauros, and have bulk rivaling Snorlax's. Additionally, Soft-Boiled can capitalize on Mew's impressive bulk and Reflect can enhance it, which also makes Mew one of the top physical walls in the tier; conversely, it can sacrifice itself with Explosion to hopefully take another high-value Pokemon down with it. As a Special sweeper, it is outclassed by its clone, Mewtwo, which has Amnesia and a far superior Special stat, as well as by Amnesia Slowbro. Also, Mew's wallbreaking tool, STAB Psychic, is weaker than Alakazam's and Exeggutor's Psychics due to their higher Special stats.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Mega Kick and Double-Edge are single-turn attacks more powerful than Body Slam, but, in addition to their respective poor accuracy and recoil, they lack Body Slam's paralysis chance. Ice Beam or Blizzard used with Reflect threatens to freeze opposing Mew, and both inflict more damage onto Exeggutor, Golem, Rhydon, and Zapdos before Swords Dance boosts, but both force Mew to give up offensive potential.</p> <p>A couple of consecutive Seismic Toss used without reply can get paralyzed Mew not behind Reflect in Explosion's KO range.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Since Mew has to set up before inflicting heavy damage, even Pokemon with somewhat weak defenses can paralyze it with Thunder Wave before switching out the following turn. Like any Pokemon, Mew doesn't appreciate the sleep status either.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Mew</strong>: Any Mew set with both Reflect and Soft-Boiled is a good Mew answer. Thunder Wave paralyzes Mew, and Swords Dance combined with Explosion can take both Mew out of the picture. Swords Dance-boosted attacks also attempt to KO the other Mew.</p> <p><strong>Gengar</strong>: Mew without Earthquake generally lacks the means to deal any damage to Gengar, usually firing off a Thunder Wave at most.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Reflect Snorlax is particularly effective against Mew lacking Earthquake, as +6 Body Slam is only a 4HKO against Snorlax behind Reflect. Snorlax can use Rest to recover health and is immune to Body Slam paralysis. It can paralyze Mew with its own Body Slam, though, and can deal at least 74% damage with Self-Destructâ€”assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect's boost.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon and Golem</strong>: Both Rhydon and Golem can exploit Mew lacking Earthquake. Rhydon's Substitutes aren't broken by even a +6 Body Slam most of the time. In return, Rhydon is extremely likely to 3HKO with Earthquake, assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect up. Golem lacks the same power and bulk as Rhydon but can threaten with a 64% or more damage Explosion. Explosion's usage can be predictable though, and Golem finds Reflect Mew extremely tough to break down. Rhydon manages to dismantle Body Slam variants with Leer or stall with Substitute and Rest.</p> <p><strong>Articuno</strong>: Although considered to have low viability, Articuno makes for a solid check to the typical Mew; it is immune to Earthquake, and unboosted Body Slam from Mew isn't even a guaranteed 6HKO. Blizzard 3HKOes Mew in return. Articuno can also run Reflect; unlike Snorlax, it isn't immune to Body Slam paralysis, though.</p> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster functions similarly to Articuno, except for it not being immune to Earthquake. It notably suffers from a less-powerful Blizzard but instead has an improved Defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos</strong>: Mew is only a match for Reflect Zapdos when fully boosted. In the meantime, Zapdos can deal a minimum of 30% damage with Thunderbolt, forcing Mew to recover, while threatening possible critical hits. Mew recovering, especially from critical hits, gives extra opportunities for Thunderbolt's 10.2% chance of inflicting paralysisâ€”assuming Mew isn't already paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Exeggutor</strong>: Exeggutor is resistant to Earthquake and is usually only 6HKOed by Mew's Body Slam without boosts. It threatens Mew out with potential Stun Spore and Sleep Powder. It can also do 58% damage minimum to Mew with Explosion if Reflect is not up.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Slowbro can paralyze Mew with Thunder Wave or set up Reflect or Withdraw with paralysis support. Slowbro's Surf has a small chance of 2HKOing at +2 Special.</p> <p><strong>Tauros</strong>: Tauros, which is faster than Mew when not paralyzed, can take it out with enough critical hits or full paralysis triggerings. Tauros benefits from its immunity to Body Slam paralysis, though the matchup slowly reverses as Swords Dance Mew gains its Attack boosts.</p> <p><strong>Mewtwo</strong>: If necessary, Mewtwo can 2HKO Mew on average at +2 Special. Mew, on the other hand, only 3HKOes at +2 Attack unless it possesses Hyper Beam.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Traditional Sweeper": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>Mew's traditional aim is to set up with Swords Dance, recover from any damage via Soft-Boiled, and then attempt to sweep with its two attacks. Earthquake is generally Mew's most damaging attack, OHKOing Gengar and 2HKOing Golem and Rhydon at +2 Attack. Body Slam hits Zapdos and Exeggutor neutrally, albeit being initially weak; it also aims to paralyze targets including opposing Mew, using paralysis and damage to pressure it to recover or use Explosion. At +6 Attack, Body Slam has guaranteed 2HKOs on every Pokemon that isn't Cloyster, behind Reflect or Defense boosts, or a Rock- or Ghost-type. Hyper Beam provides a more powerful move to finish off targets besides Golem, Rhydon, or Gengar, but additional paralysis support and care to avoid being exploited by Transform Mew are advised. Another downside of Hyper Beam is the risk that +4 or +6 Attack Hyper Beam is weakened by one of Mew's 19.5% likely critical hits, which can cost it the KO and force Mew to recharge. Soft-Boiled is the choice for longevity, but often Explosion can be useful to cancel out an opposing Mew in an advantageous position.</p>"

      "GGMew (Reflect Sweeper)": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set was popularised during various RBY Ubers tournaments in 2016. It simultaneously performs well against opposing Mew and sets up to sweep. Thanks to Reflect, it can't be KOed by another Mew outside of a +4 Explosionâ€”given no status, enough PP, and consistent recovery. The downside is having to choose between Body Slam or Earthquake; however, when you consider the viable Pokemon in the tier, your opponent will probably have at most two Pokemon that your chosen move cannot hit neutrally or super effectively. Body Slam is the slightly preferred choice due to it hitting Exeggutor and Zapdos, which are collectively considered more viable than Gengar and Rhydon. It also has 8 more PP, and Gengar and Rhydon can be baited into weakening themselves fighting Mew's teammates prior to revealing the set. Earthquake is usually more effective as a counter-team option because, like the traditional sweeper set, opting out of Body Slam for Earthquake means it is best to search for paralysis support. Soft-Boiled is recommended to take advantage of Reflect more.</p>"

      "Explosive Lure": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set exists to nullify an opposing Mew. Once your Mew has landed a Thunder Wave, the opposing Mew is slowed down and vulnerable to full paralysis. Next, boost with Swords Dance so that, on any following turn, Mew is ready to take it down with Explosion. If the opposing Mew uses Reflect, boost your Mew's Attack stat all the way up to +6 if you can in order to guarantee an OHKO with Explosion. Alternatively, you can chip the opposing Mew with Body Slam or Earthquake before delivering a +4 Explosion. With enough paralysis luck, your Mew may be able to KO the opposing Mew and save its Explosion for another Pokemon. Reflect can be used in this set to stall needing to use Explosion, although, since Mew's only attack will be Explosion, it relies on your opponent not playing around it and either giving away a less valuable Pokemon or sending in Gengar, Golem, or Rhydon. This set can also function as an emergency Mewtwo check; it is only 2HKOed by 999 Special Mewtwo, so Mew can reliably paralyze Mewtwo, and it does a minimum of 63% damage with an unboosted Explosion.</p>"

      "Lutrew / PaRaSiTe Mew (Transform)": {
        "description": "<h4>Set Description</h4> <p>This set was created by Lutra in the mid-2010s to counter traditional Swords Dance Mew setsâ€”particularly the Hyper Beam variantâ€”and greatly departs from the traditional sweeper set. Once in against opposing Mew, use Thunder Wave and Reflect first as it sets up Swords Dance, use Soft-Boiled if needed to stay healthy, and, finally, use Transform. This sequence makes your Mew into the traditional sweeper set with the bonus of Reflect protection and an opposing Mew that can become fully paralyzed. If you make your Mew transform before its target reaches +6, it can use Swords Dance again to both boost itself and lower its target's Speed under paralysis. The Reflect sweeper set, unfortunately, ruins it plans, stalling it out by taking advantage of Transform's 5 PP. This set will also result in a stalemate with fellow Transform Mew, possibly resulting in an endless battle. Worse yet, its lack of offensive threat means the opponent can easily switch to another Pokemon.</p>"
