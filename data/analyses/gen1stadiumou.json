  "Nidoking": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoking manages to find a niche in the Stadium OU metagame as a mixed sweeper thanks to Focus Energy. The move boosts its critical hit rate to a fearsome 62%, which, alongside its perfect coverage and decent attacking stats to back them up, allows it to deal huge damage. In addition, Nidoking has a solid Speed tier that enables it to outpace everything up to Articuno. Its typing isn't entirely without merit, either, as it walls Jolteon and grants it an important immunity to Thunder Wave, a trait that is unique among viable Focus Energy users.</p> <p>Nidoking has its drawbacks, though. Its horrid defensive typing burdens it with weaknesses to Psychic, Ice, and Ground and leaves it without a resistance to Flying, making it a shakier Zapdos check than Rhydon and Golem. To make matters worse, it's outsped by metagame staples such as Alakazam, Starmie, and Tauros, all of which 2HKO Nidoking. This fragility makes paralysis support a necessity to get the most out of Nidoking. On that note, while Nidoking itself is immune to Thunder Wave, it still hates paralysis and can be crippled by Body Slam or Stun Spore. Additionally, Nidoking is unreliable, as it requires setup and, even after setting up, scoring a critical hit is inconsistent. Nevertheless, with the proper support, it can be an effective addition to a team.</p>",

      "Focus Energy Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Focus Energy significantly boosts Nidoking's critical hit rate, making it very difficult to switch into. Earthquake is Nidoking's most powerful attack; it needs just one critical hit to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Starmie and Chansey. Nidoking 2HKOes Tauros and Snorlax as well if it scores two critical hits, but it only has a 38.4% chance to do so. Blizzard is necessary in the third moveslot, as it gives Nidoking the best shot at muscling through Rest Exeggutor before it can retaliate. It has other uses besides this; a critical hit is guaranteed to OHKO Rhydon and Golem and will usually let Nidoking 2HKO Zapdos, and it has a small freeze chance, letting it KO Pokemon it normally would not be able to as a last resort. Finally, with a single critical hit, Thunderbolt 2HKOes Slowbro and OHKOes the rare Cloyster after a little chip damage.</p> <p>For Nidoking to fulfill its role effectively, it should be kept away from damage and status whenever possible, and faster Pokemon such as Alakazam and Starmie should be paralyzed before it attempts to set up for a sweep. This is easier said than done due to Team Preview, meaning your opponent will know that you have Nidoking on your team and will try to keep these Pokemon as healthy as is feasible so they can keep it in check. Getting Nidoking on the field is not a simple task either due to its horrific defensive typing allowing it to be hit for super effective damage by most metagame staples, but it still has some decent opportunities to switch in and set up with Focus Energy. The most obvious would be the aforementioned Jolteon, which is unable to do anything meaningful to it. Once again, though, your opponent will be aware of Nidoking and will be able to prepare for it by switching out. Another good chance to switch in is on a predicted Rest from Pokemon like Exeggutor. There is also an element of risk here, as most Rest users can predict the switch and deal major damage with their coverage moves, preventing Nidoking from setting up.</p> <p>Slowbro and Starmie are good partners for Nidoking, as they resist Ice, Psychic, and Water and provide paralysis support for it. Slowbro in particular is adept at drawing in enemy Starmie to paralyze it. In return, Nidoking can protect them from Electric-type moves. Exeggutor is another Pokemon that can spread paralysis, but it differentiates itself from Slowbro and Starmie with a handy resistance to Ground that can make the Rhydon matchup easier.</p> <p>Thanks to its immense movepool, Nidoking has plenty of room for customization. Substitute can be used in order to protect it from status and critical hits, but it can be difficult to set up alongside Focus Energy, and it puts Nidoking in OHKO range of Rhydon, Alakazam, and Exeggutor. Ice Beam is a more accurate alternative to Blizzard, but it requires an additional critical hit to 2HKO Exeggutor and almost never OHKOes Rhydon and Golem even with a critical hit. Thunder has poor accuracy, but it can be used instead of Thunderbolt; the greater power allows a critical hit to OHKO Cloyster and KO Starmie and Slowbro after minimal chip damage. Body Slam can paralyze switch-ins like Starmie. Rock Slide OHKOes the rare Articuno and Moltres with a critical hit, but Nidoking is OHKOed and 2HKOed by their Blizzard and Fire Blast and requires paralysis support to reliably outspeed them. Surf reliably KOes Rhydon and Golem without needing a critical hit if they are not at full health and has perfect accuracy, but it is inferior to Blizzard otherwise.</p>"

  "Persian": {
    "overview": "<p>Persian profits immensely from the Substitute mechanics in Stadium OU, which give it a degree of safety against the threat of Thunder Wave. With the strongest Slash in the game in addition to special coverage in Bubble Beam and Thunderbolt, Persian is well-equipped for dealing with Pokemon like weakened Tauros, Cloyster, Rhydon, and Reflect Chansey. Persian is also extremely fast, outrunning Tauros and boasting a 19% critical hit rate, giving it strong revenge killing utility and notable volatility. Because of this, when paired with Tauros, Persian forms a strong Normal-type attacking core that can be difficult for teams to stop.</p> <p>However, Persian should never be used over Tauros—only alongside it—and for good reason: its power is simply inferior. While Slash itself is very strong, Persian itself isn't, making it still struggle against bulkier Pokemon like Snorlax. Persian's special coverage deals middling damage to most targets, meaning it is very reliant on Slash; Tauros possesses Earthquake and Blizzard, allowing it to muscle past Gengar and Exeggutor, respectively. In fact, seeing Gengar in Team Preview often makes Persian dead weight for a majority of the game, forcing its teammates to remove it before it can make any progress. Like many fast Pokemon in the tier, Persian is ruined by paralysis as well, leading to it being forced out if it can't KO Thunder Wave users before they paralyze it. Paralysis also exposes its awful fragilty: critical hits from tier staples like Tauros, Alakazam, and Rhydon can outright OHKO it. Persian also competes with Kangaskhan as a \"second Tauros\", the latter possessing 101 HP Substitutes and superior bulk to better contest Chansey and Snorlax, as well as Earthquake to fight Gengar. However, Persian's Speed and Slash access give it much better qualities as a revenge killer, providing it with a strong niche in the metagame.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Substitute Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Slash is Persian's main outlet for damage, having a 99% critical hit rate to effectively ignore Reflect; it also 2HKOes Alakazam, preventing it from using Substitute if it's already used it once. Bubble Beam allows Persian to 2HKO Rhydon, which otherwise counters it. Common switch-ins to Bubble Beam—such as Alakazam and Starmie—can also have their Speed dropped switching in, which can potentially let Persian threaten them head-on. Thunderbolt lets Persian attempt to 3HKO Cloyster and Slowbro, the latter of which is also particularly vulnerable to critical hits if it tries to set up Amnesia. However, it should be noted that Thunderbolt deals less damage to Starmie than Slash without a critical hit. Finally, Substitute can be used against resting Pokemon like Exeggutor and Slowbro for free, guarding against status and poising Persian to get serious damage in. It can similarly be used against paralyzed Alakazam, Chansey, or Starmie to fish for full paralysis—especially on predicted Recover uses—foes which Persian can muscle past from there.</p> <p>Persian performs best as an expendable mid-game revenge killer, but thanks to Substitute, it can also be a successful late-game cleaner. Once a Pokemon is forced to use Recover, use Rest, or otherwise end up in KO range, Persian can usually come in and profit immensely so long as its checks have been removed. Late-game Persian also has a minor advantage against Substitute Tauros, which put themselves into Slash 2HKO range when using it, so there is value in holding it back to the point where a Tauros mirror would otherwise be appropriate. In terms of other moveset options, Body Slam can be used to let Persian scout while spreading paralysis, though giving up either Bubble Beam or Thunderbolt is often necessary, making Persian more easily checked. Thunder can be used instead of Thunderbolt for a guaranteed 2HKO on Cloyster, as well as dealing more damage to Starmie than Slash, but its consistency gives Persian its own trouble. While Hyper Beam can be used to squeeze 2HKOs on Chansey and Starmie alongside Slash, the forced recharge makes it a far cry from regular RBY and thus generally not recommended.</p>"

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Alakazam's great typing and stellar base stats give it the most threatening Psychic in the tier and more Speed than every viable Pokemon bar Jolteon. Even with Stadium's changes, it maintains a 19.1% critical hit rate; in conjunction with paralysis and Special drops, this allows Psychic to eventually break through even Chansey and Psychic-resistant foes. Alakazam has exceptional moves in Thunder Wave and Recover, granting it considerable utility against most threats. Alakazam can serve as a status spreader, special wall, and potential sweeper; its Speed allows it to use Substitute to block Thunder Waves and preserve its sweeping potential. It can also function well when paralyzed, as it becomes a reasonable status absorber. A paralyzed Alakazam has its limits, however—physical threats like Snorlax and Tauros can outspeed and 2HKO it or set up Substitute to thwart its Thunder Wave.  Alakazam faces another obstacle in the pervasive Rest Exeggutor, which can stall out its Seismic Toss and threaten it with Stun Spore and Double-Edge. Nevertheless, Alakazam is an extremely common sight thanks to its versatility and support capability.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reflect is a shaky alternative to Substitute; its benefits are outweighed by the fact it doesn't protect Alakazam from critical hits or status. Counter theoretically allows Alakazam to surprise physical attackers, but mechanics changes in Stadium reduce its utility. Alakazam's low HP also means it will rarely OHKO attackers and risks Body Slam paralysis, neutering it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Once Alakazam is paralyzed, Snorlax, Tauros, Rhydon, Persian, Kangaskhan, and other physically potent threats can switch in on Recover and threaten Alakazam. None of these like taking Psychics, though, and most despise Thunder Wave. However, attempting to paralyze physical Pokemon is risky once they are already in, as they can potentially block it with Substitute and become even more difficult to stop.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Exeggutor and Slowbro both check Alakazam; Exeggutor can threaten it with Double-Edge and Stun Spore, while Slowbro can set up Amnesia freely. Both also carry Rest to thwart Thunder Wave and heal off Seismic Toss. Despite this, Seismic Toss will eventually force them to use Rest, providing opportunities to pressure them with other attackers. Starmie and opposing Alakazam can also hamstring Alakazam with Thunder Wave, stall it with Recover, or force it to Recover and switch to a physical attacker, potentially catching Alakazam as it fully paralyzes. However, this comes at a cost, as Starmie and Alakazam will almost certainly be paralyzed in the process.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey's special bulk and access to instant recovery in Soft-Boiled allows it to sponge multiple Psychics from Alakazam, giving it room to use Thunder Wave or inflict chip damage so a physical teammate can switch in on its Recover. With some luck, though, Alakazam can break through paralyzed Chansey, particularly if it is already chipped prior to switching in. Chansey especially has trouble against Substitute Alakazam if it lacks Seismic Toss, as none of its other moves are capable of breaking Substitute in one hit.</p>",

      "Standard": {
        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Psychic is a threat to any non-resistant Pokemon—even Chansey cannot withstand extended exposure if it is paralyzed. Thunder Wave is irreplacable, as paralysis is what allows Alakazam to break down Chansey and opposing Psychic-types. Unlike in RBY, however, Substitute blocks Thunder Wave, making it a risky move if Alakazam is paralyzed itself—fast physical users like Tauros, Persian, and Kangaskhan become much more threatening if given the opportunity to set it up. Recover lets Alakazam heal off damage, but can invite in physical attackers if Alakazam is paralyzed. Seismic Toss is strongly recommended, as it allows Alakazam to pressure opposing Psychic-types effectively while saving Psychic PP, but Substitute can be used instead to protect Alakazam from status moves and critical hits, making it an effective late-game sweeper if opposing Psychic-types are removed. Chansey cannot break Substitute in one hit without Seismic Toss, so Alakazam can pressure BoltBeam Chansey safely. Furthermore, Substitute can help Alakazam PP stall some foes more effectively, as Alakazam won't be vulnerable to secondary effects from damaging moves when using it. Unfortunately, Substitute Alakazam itself is much easier to PP stall by switching between Psychic-types and Chansey to waste PP.</p> <p>Alakazam is better used in the back, but as a lead it sports fair matchups against Chansey and the rare Jynx, as it can paralyze them with Thunder Wave and then proceed to pressure them with Psychic or Seismic Toss. Unfortunately, Exeggutor is the most common lead and fares well against it, as Exeggutor can scout for Substitute with Double-Edge and hamstring it with Stun Spore when it is forced to use Recover. Snorlax performs well against Alakazam too; Body Slam 2HKOes and threatens paralysis simultaneously. Alakazam can choose to take paralysis and become a decent status absorber, providing an avenue to protect teammates like Reflect Chansey from paralysis so it can switch into and wall Snorlax for Alakazam. However, this forfeits its excellent Speed. Unparalyzed Alakazam can revenge kill fast offensive threats like Tauros, Zapdos, and the rare Persian, threaten them with Thunder Wave, and act as a sweeper.</p> <p>Psychic's ability to break past paralyzed Chansey can provide an opportunity for Alakazam to paralyze a Pokemon when Chansey switches out or use Seismic Toss to pressure paralyzed Psychic-types as they enter. In an Alakazam mirror match, the typical strategy is to paralyze the opposing Alakazam, use Seismic Toss to chip it down, and switch out to a physical attacker when it is expected to use Recover. Unlike in RBY, Special drops from Psychic no longer reapply the paralysis Speed penalty, so there is little reason to waste Psychic PP in the mirror match. The threat of Thunder Wave puts pressure on fast Pokemon, such as Starmie and Tauros, to switch out to a paralyzed teammate or Chansey to absorb it. While this means Alakazam will rarely paralyze multiple Pokemon, it can use Psychic or Seismic Toss instead to pressure and potentially overwhelm these status absorbers as they come in, or it can switch out to a physical threat that can deal significantly higher immediate damage to them, like Snorlax.</p> <p>Alakazam works well with teammates that can deal with other Psychic-types and Chansey. Zapdos' STAB moves 2HKO Starmie, Slowbro, and the omnipresent Exeggutor; Zapdos also 3HKOes Chansey and opposing Alakazam. In return, Alakazam can threaten Rhydon and take Psychic and Ice-type moves for Zapdos. Tauros and Persian can threaten most of Alakazam's walls, though care must be taken with them, as they despise being paralyzed. Notably, Persian 3HKOes Exeggutor with Slash, allowing it to switch in on its Rest and KO it or force it out. Alakazam returns the favor by providing valuable paralysis support and dealing with Gengar. Alakazam also appreciates teammates that can switch into physical attackers. Cloyster walls Snorlax and Tauros lacking Thunderbolt, 2HKOes Exeggutor with Blizzard, and leaves Starmie in OHKO range with Explosion. Gengar is another excellent partner, as it can wall Snorlax and Tauros should they lack Earthquake. Offensively, it carries a strong Thunderbolt to hit Starmie and Slowbro, and its Explosion can be used to deal significant damage to Chansey.</p>"

  "Golem": {
    "overview": "<p>While in heavy competition with Rhydon for a spot on a team, Golem has merit for its access to Explosion, letting it blow holes in opposing teams for its allies to exploit. Golem's higher Speed compared to Rhydon also pays dividends in Stadium, giving it a 12% critical hit rate that helps it break through opposing Reflect Snorlax and Chansey. These traits make Golem a fair pick on teams weak to Rhydon that need a consistent way to beat bulkier Pokemon like the aforementioned Normal-types, as well as Slowbro and Rest Exeggutor. When provided with paralysis support, Golem is a serious threat, dealing massive damage with its STAB moves while still maintaining the threat of Explosion, often securing the late-game for its team as a result.</p> <p>However, Golem's Explosion and Speed are all it has over Rhydon. Rhydon has superior overall bulk, 103 HP Substitutes to consistently beat Seismic Toss Chansey, and a better Attack stat that gives it more consistent KO ranges. Because of this, on top of Snorlax having a superior self-KO move in STAB Self-Destruct, Golem is very hard to fit onto teams. Golem still has Rhydon's flaws as well: it's very slow and specially frail, making it take mortal damage against special attackers like Starmie, Alakazam, and Lapras, forcing it to use Explosion earlier than one would expect. Its slowness also causes it to lose one-on-one matchups surprisingly frequently, such as against Tauros and Exeggutor. Like Rhydon’s, while Golem's defensive typing does provide a useful Electric immunity for combatting Zapdos and Jolteon, it also gives massive weaknesses to Ice- and Water-type coverage from Pokemon like Chansey and Snorlax, making it very difficult for Golem to successfully enter battle and do its job. These problems make Golem a rare sight in Stadium OU, but it’s still a serviceable pick for teams that need a better Rhydon matchup in addition to an Explosion user.</p>",

      "Explosion": {
        "description": "<p>The combination of Rock Slide and Earthquake lets Golem hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage. Rock Slide particularly hits Exeggutor for neutral damage, ensuring it can't repeatedly switch in, lest it be forced to use Rest early. It also hits Flying-types like Articuno and Zapdos for heavy damage, forcing them out and letting Golem scout with Body Slam. Earthquake has the potential to OHKO Gengar and Jolteon while serving as its strongest attack without a drawback. Body Slam serves as a midground option, letting Golem spread paralysis for itself while punishing potential switch-ins. Explosion allows Golem to trade with an important Pokemon; note, however, that it doesn't let Golem survive breaking a Substitute, unlike in regular RBY. This means that scouting the target for Substitute or paralyzing it is recommended.</p> <p>Stadium's Team Preview benefits Golem’s Explosion, as you will always know whether the opponent has a Zapdos, Jolteon, or Gengar on their team. If Zapdos or Jolteon is present, it's best to hold back the Explosion until late-game, where Golem can check them more effectively. Still, remember that Golem struggles to actually get in to check them, as it can be somewhat predictable. Similarly, in Gengar's case, saving Explosion until it’s used its own Explosion or otherwise been crippled is recommended, or it can be used to nullify Explosion completely. Rhydon poses a risk for similar reasons, but it struggles to switch in due to the threat of Earthquake, though it's notable regardless. If none of these Pokemon are present, Explosion can be used much earlier to KO important mid-game Pokemon like Snorlax and Chansey. It's also perfectly viable to use it as an emergency check to Slowbro if it's picked up too many Amnesia boosts.</p> <p>Golem has room for customization to further differentiate itself from Rhydon, but this is often a misguided effort, as it has to drop Body Slam or Rock Slide, opening it up to exploitation. Defense Curl or Harden can be used to make Golem more consistently check Snorlax, but this still loses to Amnesia variants. Fire Blast is a somewhat viable option for hitting Exeggutor and burning switch-ins, but this can backfire against Pokemon that prefer being burned, such as Starmie and Chansey. Substitute can potentially be used to guard against status and get more hits in, but Rhydon does this better by a long shot and it makes Golem inclined to use Explosion earlier, so it's not recommended.</p>"

With the exclusive STAB Crabhammer, its mediocre Special is largely made up for and gives it unresisted coverage, meaning Kingler is capable of dealing with common obstacles to its sweep such as Rhydon and Gengar. Furthermore, Kingler's Speed is just high enough to pose an offensive threat, being faster than defensive presences like Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax. Thus, stopping Kingler from steamrolling or breaking holes in a team can be quite difficult if the stage is set.</p> <p>However, Kingler is only barely viable in Stadium OU. Hyper Beam is massively nerfed in Stadium, so its offensive capabilities are noticeably worse. Furthermore, its low Special and middling Speed mean that any strong special attacker like Alakazam or Starmie can 2HKO and revenge kill it with ease; this also makes it very difficult to switch in. A somewhat related weakness is that Kingler's frailty and Speed reliance mean it cannot afford to be paralyzed at all. Its weakness to the abundant Thunderbolt only worsens this; many users can outright OHKO it. Kingler is monumentally reliant on paralysis support, which is very hard to provide. Due to these factors, finding opportunities for Kingler to succeed is very difficult; ergo, it is generally not recommended on conventional teams.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to deal massive damage to virtually any Pokemon in the tier; note that it cannot boost past +4. +2 Body Slam deals just enough damage to prevent Alakazam, Starmie, and even Chansey from using their recovery moves to stall it out; thus, they cannot switch in lest they get severely punished. Crabhammer backs this up with unresisted coverage, preventing Gengar from repeatedly switching in and threatening a 3HKO. It also OHKOes Rhydon and is Kingler's best option against Tauros even at +2; it also has a high chance to 3HKO Snorlax, meaning Reflect variants can't consistently Rest stall it. Kingler's final moveslot defines its role. Double-Edge acts as a potent finishing tool, as recoil is not sustained when it KOes in Stadium, including breaking Substitutes. Thus, Double-Edge makes Kingler more of a wallbreaker that can pressure Substitute users like Chansey. +2 Double-Edge also has a chance to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Exeggutor, which makes it a good opportunity to punish Rest. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to give Kingler safety against status and exploit resting Pokemon like Snorlax and Exeggutor.</p> <p>Kingler has a terrible movepool, but there is room for customization; usually, the fourth moveslot is the most replaceable. Stomp is the most compelling, letting Kingler fish for flinches on paralyzed Pokemon while using its strong Attack stat. Hyper Beam is technically usable at +2 for OHKOs on Alakazam, Chansey, Jolteon, and sometimes Starmie, but its forced recharge turn can completely ruin any chance of sweeping, defeating the purpose of using it.</p> <p>Kingler should be used on teams that can provide ample paralysis support, which can be a bit difficult given status protection being available in Stadium. Ideally, partners like Alakazam, Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Starmie should be used to consistently get uncontested paralysis. Jolteon is of particular note for luring in Rhydon very consistently while resisting Electric-type hits itself, thus giving it a decent Zapdos matchup. Special sponges like the ubiquitous Chansey make up for Kingler's terrible weakness to special attacks; Chansey also has access to Thunder Wave. Kingler should ideally be used when an opposing Pokemon is at its most vulnerable; paralyzed Pokemon using Recover, resting Pokemon, and those using Substitute are ample opportunities to bring it in. Generally, most of the opposing team should be paralyzed for it to be successful.</p>"

Stun Spore cripples threats, but note that it is blocked by Substitute. Double-Edge is an incredibly useful move that can pressure Chansey, Alakazam, and their Substitutes, which is ideal, as its recoil damage doesn't apply when it scores a KO or breaks a Substitute. Breaking their Substitutes prevents them from setting up Substitute again and gives Exeggutor an opportunity to land Stun Spore when they're forced to recover. Furthermore, Double-Edge also deals more damage to enemy Exeggutor than Psychic can, allowing it to wear it down and force its Rest more quickly. Pressuring other Exeggutor and Chansey into using their recovery moves lets you switch out to a teammate that can threaten them. Explosion can be run over Double-Edge to let Exeggutor trade for a Pokemon on the opposing team and allow a teammate to switch in. However, it is risky, because Rhydon is common and takes little damage from it, and Explosion KOes Exeggutor when it hits a Substitute in Stadium. Finally, Rest heals Exeggutor and wipes off paralysis and the Speed loss that comes with it, keeping enemy Exeggutor, Alakazam, Rhydon, Jolteon, Snorlax, and others in check long term. Be aware that using Rest gives offensive threats like Starmie, Zapdos, and Snorlax an opportunity to switch in and apply pressure.</p> <p>Exeggutor makes a potent lead choice in Stadium OU to status common leads like other Exeggutor, Chansey, and Snorlax and scout for Substitute on Alakazam with Double-Edge. In addition, leads that can threaten Exeggutor like Jynx are rare in Stadium OU. Later on, care should be taken if Exeggutor is paralyzed; though it can remove the status with Rest, Pokemon like Snorlax and Rhydon have an easier time putting pressure on Exeggutor, especially if they are behind a Substitute, as it will then not be able to paralyze them. Exeggutor should generally stick to the moves listed above, but it does have other options. Sleep Powder puts a foe to sleep, but it's a shadow of its former self in Stadium; it cannot hit Pokemon behind a Substitute, sleep is limited to 0-3 turns, and Rest is counted under Sleep Clause, making it useless if one of the opponent's Pokemon is sleeping from Rest. Mega Drain hits Starmie, Slowbro, and Rhydon while letting Exeggutor recover some HP in the process. Unfortunately, it is blocked by Substitute and does little damage to most other Pokemon. Egg Bomb is an alternative to Double-Edge that never causes recoil damage, but it's held back by its shaky accuracy. Hyper Beam has a surprise factor and will KO Chansey at 40%, but it's undesirable, as Exeggutor will always have to recharge after using it in Stadium.</p>"

Additionally, Stadium's Substitute offers Rhydon added utility, most notably blocking Exeggutor’s Stun Spore, and while allowing it to throw off strong attacks or attempt a Body Slam paralysis with little to no drawbacks. Rest is also used by many Pokemon in Stadium, including, Exeggutor, Snorlax, Slowbro, and Cloyster; this further helps Rhydon get on the field and get up a Substitute without risking damage or a status ailment. Rhydon’s defensive typing—while not great—allows it to also be a Thunder Wave and Explosion absorber.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Rhydon is slower than all OU Pokemon besides Snorlax and Slowbro. Despite its Normal resistance, its poor defensive typing and Special allow common Pokemon such as Chansey, Tauros, and Starmie to outspeed and 2HKO with Ice Beam or Blizzard, which they very commonly carry. This means Rhydon absolutely requires paralysis support to be effective, and while this may seem high-maintenance, with proper team support Rhydon is capable of busting massive holes mid-game or cleaning up late-game.</p> <p>Rhydon also competes with Golem, which has access to Explosion—and is slightly faster than Rhydon, at base 45—meaning it wins one-on-one with its own Earthquake. However, what Golem lacks is the ability to create Substitutes that survive Seismic Toss. This makes Golem’s gameplan very prediction reliant because wallbreaking and cleaning up is much less safe. Rhydon also has the edge offensively, as its higher Attack allows it to meet better KO ranges against common Pokemon in the metagame. Finally, while Golem does outspeed Rhydon, they effectively share the same Speed tier, being outsped by Chansey and thus both requiring paralysis support. For these reasons, Rhydon is preferred on most competitive teams.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Rhydon looks to capitalize on its opportunities and massive Attack stat with its standard Substitute set. Its Earthquake is the strongest physical attack in the game with no drawbacks. It can easily enter the field against Zapdos and Jolteon, as these threats fail to threaten Rhydon with significant damage or status, with it taking less than 20% from the super effective Double Kick seen on Jolteon. If Chansey is revealed to only have Seismic Toss for attacks, it can also act as a point of entry. However, it's still best to not switch into Seismic Toss, as you can switch in on a predicted Thunder Wave or Soft-Boiled for free, keeping Rhydon healthy to create Subsitutes and stay out of range of Starmie’s and Tauros’s Blizzard. Once it gets in, it can get a Substitute up for free—usually forcing a switch—to attack accordingly. Common checks in Starmie and Exeggutor risk Body Slam paralysis as they break your Substitute, which can help tremendously long term, although Exeggutor commonly runs Rest and can remove the paralysis if it manages to get it off. Not only does your team appreciate these checks being paralyzed, but next time they will be unable to beat Rhydon behind a Substitute one-on-one, as Body Slam chip damage means Earthquake 2HKOes Starmie and Rock Slide 3HKOes Exeggutor.</p> <p>It’s important to note just how devastatingly strong Rhydon is. For reference, with Earthquake it OHKOes Jolteon and the rare Gengar, 2HKOes Alakazam, Chansey, Rhydon, and the uncommon Persian and Golem, has a small chance to 2HKO Starmie, and 3HKOes Tauros and Snorlax. It’s also worth noting These are some of the most common Pokemon in the metagame. Also, if Tauros uses Substitute it will be in 2HKO range, meaning it can no longer switch into Rhydon behind a Substitute. With Rock Slide, it OHKOes Jynx and Articuno, 2HKOes Zapdos, and 3HKOes Cloyster. However, it still loses to all the threats listed above in a one-on-one situation where Rhydon doesn’t have a Substitute and the opposing Pokemon isn’t paralyzed, aside from Zapdos, Jolteon, and Gengar. Additionally, these Pokemon potentially 2HKOing or even OHKOing Rhydon means you must be very careful, as a stray critical hit or mistake is enough to put Rhydon down.</p> <p>Stadium's Team Preview is a double-edged sword for Rhydon. Knowing if your opponent has Zapdos or Jolteon is important to using Rhydon’s defensive utility most effectively. However, your opponent can plan around Rhydon, meaning a “free switch” can turn bad if your opponent double switches to a Rhydon check such as Starmie or Exeggutor.</p> <p>Rhydon is capable of fitting Rest, and it is no gimmick. With so many Pokemon often using Rest themselves or paralyzed, Rhydon can usually find a time to use Rest. It also completely walls Seismic Toss Chansey and Snorlax if it lacks Ice Beam, Blizzard, or Earthquake, using Rest to stay healthy in the face of these threats. If Rhydon happens to be behind a Substitute, you gain an extra turn at the minimum to wake up. If you do decide to run Rest, it will most likely be over Rock Slide, but Body Slam is also an option. Replacing Rock Slide gives Rhydon a worse Exeggutor matchup, as it only 5HKOes with Body Slam. However, Earthquake hits enough of your key targets, and Body Slam paralysis is very valuable to punish switch-ins and gain better one-on-one matchups. Leer and Tail Whip are plausible to negate Reflect, which Snorlax and Chansey often use. This isn’t reliable or necessary, as you’d drop a more consistent option in Body Slam, Rock Slide, or Rest.</p>"

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey's unrivaled special bulk and exceptional movepool make it a staple of Stadium OU and mandatory on most teams. Its ability to paralyze foes, heal itself, and steadily chip away at the foe's HP throughout a match grant it an outstanding defensive presence. Chansey can even set up Reflect to increase its physical bulk and take on strong physical attackers like Snorlax. Despite it lacking a Psychic-type resistance, its sheer bulk is more than enough to let it switch into the tier's various Psychic users and force them to waste valuable PP. Another benefit of Chansey's titanic special bulk is that it can serve as an excellent paralysis absorber, making further status attempts much more difficult. It's also a potential user of Stadium's buffed Substitute against paralyzed foes, as no unboosted special move can break its Substitute in one hit.</p> <p>Chansey's main weakness is its pitiful Defense stat, which leaves it easily overwhelmed by common physical attackers like Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon. This is compounded by its rather lackluster offensive presence despite its amazing movepool and high Special; without the right attacking move, like Ice Beam for Rhydon and Seismic Toss for Alakazam, it has the tendency to just sit there and eventually fall to critical hits, Special drops, or running out of Soft-Boiled PP. Chansey's Speed leaves it outsped by the majority of the tier, forcing it to usually take two hits when switching in. Despite it being an excellent paralysis absorber, a paralyzed Chansey is very susceptible to losing to RNG, as Alakazam and Starmie have decent odds of eventually breaking through Chansey with Psychic. Stadium's mechanic changes are a double-edged sword for Chansey; the nerf to Hyper Beam means Chansey is significantly less threatened by many physical attackers, especially Tauros. However, Rest and Substitute being more common means that Chansey is more susceptible to being walled or stalled out. The changes to critical hit rates makes some foes like Tauros weaker against Chansey, while others like Snorlax and Rhydon have a much higher likelihood of getting lucky against it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Counter can score some stylish KOs against Snorlax and Tauros on sets not using Substitute, but once the opponent is aware of it, it's much less useful. Defense Curl is an alternative over Reflect, with its massive 61 PP helping in prolonged PP wars. However, it requires extra turns to set up, leaving Chansey far more vulnerable. Sing can provide sleep support, but it's ill-advised due to Substitute and the nerfs to Sleep in Stadium OU.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: Snorlax's Body Slam 3HKOes Chansey, and its 24 PP will eventually beat Chansey's 16 PP of Soft-Boiled. In return, Chansey generally threatens a 6HKO with Seismic Toss, Thunderbolt, and Ice Beam. Sets carrying Reflect can PP stall Snorlax's attacking moves, though Snorlax still has good odds of breaking through with critical hits, as its rate is about 10.3% in Stadium. Hyper Beam also threatens Chansey considerably, as it does a minimum of 67.1% and thus OHKOes with a critical hit. If Chansey gets paralyzed, it tends to lose quickly, as a single full paralysis can end it and Snorlax can clear paralysis from itself with Rest to outpseed Chansey. In the short-term, however, an unparalyzed Chansey can usually force Snorlax to use Rest, and while Snorlax has little reason to switch out, it can be threatened by Chansey's teammates. Snorlax carrying Ice Beam can threaten to freeze an unparalyzed Chansey, though this goes both ways. Snorlax must also be wary of Counter. In a pinch Snorlax can use Self-Destruct to OHKO Chansey, though Reflect and Substitute can both prevent this.</p> <p><strong>Alakazam and Starmie</strong>: Alakazam generally wins one-on-one against Chansey with a combination of Psychic Special drops, critical hits, and full paralysis. Chansey paralyze Alakazam and can force it to use up valuable Psychic PP, but Alakazam will usually win PP wars due to Recover and Seismic Toss having 32 PP. Chansey lacking Seismic Toss also cannot break through Alakazam's Substitutes in one hit, allowing Alakazam to avoid getting paralyzed. Starmie is in a similar situation, though it might not always run Psychic, generally has fewer PP than Chansey in total, and loses to Chansey variants carrying Thunderbolt. However, it can try to freeze Chansey using Ice Beam and Blizzard. Chansey can also use Ice Beam to try to freeze an unparalyzed Alakazam or Starmie, however.</p> <p><strong>Rhydon</strong>: Rhydon's Earthquake almost always 2HKOes Chansey, and thus its boosted 11.3% critical hit rate will almost always OHKO; Chansey's Seismic Toss doesn't even break Rhydron's Substitute, making it favored to win in one-on-one. However, Chansey does outspeed Rhydon, so it must be wary of an unparalyzed Chansey carrying Ice Beam, which 2HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey carrying Ice Beam usually beat opposing unparalyzed Chansey lacking it. However, Seismic Toss variants beat Ice Beam variants one-on-one if freeze if off the table. Reflect Chansey also tends to be effective at PP stalling other Chansey variants, especially when paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Explosion</strong>: Explosion from foes like Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Golem can often OHKO Chansey outright. Gengar's Explosion fails to OHKO, though it still does 72% minimum. Reflect can allow Chansey to survive at least one Explosion when at full health, though many users can outspeed and attack before Chansey can set up. Explosion also immediately ends the turn, and thus Chansey is often easy pickings for a faster teammate afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Slowbro</strong>: Seismic Toss only 4HKOes Slowbro and Ice Beam does negligible damage, so Slowbro can paralyze Chansey with Thunder Wave and use it as setup fodder. However, Slowbro is threatened by Thunderbolt, and Chansey's higher critical hit rate gives it an easier time breaking through Slowbro in Stadium. Slowbro also cannot reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, so if it gets paralyzed it will still be slower than Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Fast Normal-types</strong>: Tauros's Body Slam and Double-Edge 3HKO Chansey, and even Reflect sets must be wary due to its massive critical hit rate; Double-Edge notably does upwards of 80% with a critical hit. Persian's Slash ignores Reflect and has a 53.8% chance to 2HKO. In return, Chansey can generally only 4HKO them with Seismic Toss, Ice Beam, or Thunderbolt. However, both Pokemon are reliant on their Speed, so they fear Thunder Wave, though both can run Substitute, sometimes leaving Chansey in an awkward 50/50. Chansey sets using Counter can also KO them outright.</p> <p><strong>Jolteon</strong>: Jolteon carrying Rest can use its high critical hit rate, paralysis from Thunder Wave, and Double Kick to PP stall Chansey's Soft-Boiled. However, it must be wary of Chansey's teammates when asleep due to its frailty.</p> <p><strong>Focus Energy</strong>: Users of Focus Energy like Flareon and Nidoking can 2HKO Chansey through Reflect and overwhelm it one-on-one. However, these options are extremely niche.</p>",

      "Reflect": {
        "description": "<p>Reflect lets Chansey take on physical attackers, notably Snorlax, more effectively. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage and puts pressure on paralyzed foes. Its 32 PP also helps it win certain PP wars, such as against opposing Chansey when paralyzed. Ice Beam is an alternative, letting Chansey fish for freezes on opposing Chansey, Snorlax, and other big threats. It also targets foes weak to Ice, notably threatening Exeggutor, which can otherwise use Rest to stall out Seismic Toss, and 2HKOing Rhydon, though it does minimal damage to foes with high Special bulk, like Snorlax and Alakazam, making Chansey extremely passive once Freeze Clause has activated. Soft-Boiled serves as reliable recovery, and Thunder Wave lets Chansey spread paralysis and assist with speed control. However, Chansey must be wary of Substitute.</p> <p>This set acts as a check to Snorlax, as Reflect and its immunity to Body Slam paralysis let it wall most variants; it can easily switch in, set up Reflect, and proceed to force Snorlax to switch out or use Rest, freeing up teammates for other roles. Given that Snorlax will be seen on every team, often as an early-game wallbreaker, Chansey is a natural partner to the variety of Pokemon that struggle against it, like Alakazam, physical-centric Snorlax sets, and Starmie. This is especially notable since Reflect Snorlax is a shakier check to Snorlax in Stadium OU given the increased prevalence of Ice Beam. However, Snorlax lands critical hits twice as often in this format, making Reflect less effective against it. Beyond Snorlax, Chansey naturally lures in a lot of physical attackers, so it can use the opportunity to set up Reflect and gain momentum to paralyze another foe or fish for a freeze. Tauros and Persian still threaten Chansey through Reflect thanks to their high critical hit chances, but these fast physical attackers rely on their Speed to function, so they are very afraid of Thunder Wave. If Chansey is running Seismic Toss, Rhydon is an especially bad matchup. Chansey cannot break its Substitute in one hit, while Rhyhdon can repeatedly hit Chansey with Earthquake until it gets a critical hit, which is about an 11.3% chance in Stadium and is an almost guaranteed OHKO. Chansey also doesn't enjoy facing Alakazam and Starmie: they can paralyze Chansey with Thunder Wave, and while it can force them to waste PP and threaten them with its own Thunder Wave, they will usually win one-on-one. Chansey must manage its status carefully. Once paralyzed, it's a very shaky answer to opposing physical attackers, including Snorlax, the Pokemon teams often rely on it to check; it also becomes extremely vulnerable to Rhydon. However, being paralyzed does make it immune to freeze, helping it beat opposing unparalyzed Chansey when carrying Ice Beam.</p>"
      },
      "BoltBeam": {
        "description": "<p>Thunderbolt and Ice Beam make up the classic BoltBeam combo, which provides unresisted coverage. Ice Beam notably 2HKOes Rhydon and hits common foes like Exeggutor and Zapdos super effectively. It's crucial in helping Chansey fend off opposing unparalyzed Chansey and Snorlax in freeze wars, allowing it to avoid getting PP stalled. Thunderbolt primarily targets Water-types like Starmie and Cloyster. Soft-Boiled serves as reliable recovery, while Thunder Wave lets Chansey act as speed control, notably preventing speedy physical attackers like Tauros and Persian from trying to break through Chansey freely.</p> <p>Chansey's combination of BoltBeam and Thunder Wave makes it threatening to the majority of Stadium OU and thus a natural fit for teams looking for the extra coverage. This set notably beats Starmie very consistently. Due to its lack of Seismic Toss, Alakazam takes minimal damage from Chansey's attacks and can easily break through Chansey with Special drops, critical hits, and full paralysis from Thunder Wave. Even if it runs out of Psychic PP, it will usually win a PP war. Variants carrying Substitute can be troublesome, as they can use it to dodge status and try to break through Chansey more safely. A check to Alakazam such as Double-Edge Exeggutor can assist in this matchup, but Substitute Alakazam has very limited attacking PP and is easily stalled. Chansey must be very careful about taking paralysis; as much as it likes the immunity to being frozen, it's completely destroyed by Snorlax afterwards, so it must manage its status carefully or have a partner that can switch into Snorlax for it.</p>"
      },
      "Substitute": {
        "description": "<p>With Stadium buffing Substitute to block status moves, notably Thunder Wave, Chansey can make use of it to improve many of its matchups at the cost of passivity. Since no unboosted special attack can break through its Substitutes in one hit, Chansey can wall paralyzed Alakazam and Starmie without risking paralysis or Special drops. It can then proceed to PP stall Psychic; its Substitutes also exceed 100 HP and thus require Alakazam and other Seismic Toss users to use up two Seismic Toss PP trying to break through them. However, Chansey is outsped by these Psychic-types, so it relies on its teammates to paralyze them, and thus unable it's to play in the early game much at all. Since Self-Destruct and Explosion KO the user when they connect with a Substitute in Stadium, Chansey can use it to block attempts by slower or paralyzed users. Seismic Toss is an excellent way for Chansey to spread consistent damage and pressure foes like the Psychic-types, though Ice Beam lets Chansey beat Rhydon with consistency. Ice Beam also allows Chansey to threaten foes like Chansey and Snorlax and avoid PP wars, while Substitute will prevent Chansey from getting statused by its foe. However, Ice Beam does negligible damage to Starmie and Lapras. Thunder Wave lets Chansey paralyze faster foes, primarily targeting speedy physical attackers like Tauros and Persian.</p> <p>Counter is a niche option on this set that can punish physical attackers. The most notable example is Snorlax, as sets lacking Earthquake or Amnesia can only break Chansey's Substitute in one hit by using Body Slam, forcing it to lose around 67% of its health. Additionally, Persian is OHKOed by Counter, and Tauros will only survive on one HP when at full health. Counter also OHKOes Snorlax and Tauros if they use Body Slam when Substitute is not up.</p> <p>Chansey is reliant on opposing Psychic-types and Chansey being paralyzed for its Substitute to protect it, leaving paralysis support essential. Thunder Wave from one's own Alakazam and Starmie as well as Stun Spore from Exeggutor work effectively in this regard. Chansey should avoid getting paralyzed, as paralysis makes it less consistent against Alakazam and Starmie and leaves Chansey easily overwhelmed by physical attackers like Snorlax and Rhydon.</p>"

The nerfs to sleep and addition of Team Preview make its main niche—the one-two punch of a speedy Lovely Kiss followed by a Blizzard freeze—far rarer and much less impactful. Regardless, being the most reliable sleeper available is still a decent niche to have, and Jynx can pave the way for teammates like Rhydon or Zapdos to bring down the hammer thanks to the status requiring a turn for the foe to wake up. Additionally, Jynx's other traits remain relevant: Ice-type STAB gives it a fantastic matchup against Pokemon like Exeggutor, and its Psychic resistance lets it handle opposing Psychic-types like Alakazam and non-Surf Starmie. However, its drawbacks remain; Jynx's limited offensive coverage and barely good enough Special leave it easily stopped by Pokemon like Chansey and Starmie, and it also struggles to break past Substitute, a somewhat frequent move in Stadium OU. Furthermore, its pitiful physical bulk means Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros can effortlessly exploit it to score big damage on Jynx's team as it's forced out. Double-Edge being much more common on Exeggutor also hurts it greatly, as it has a much harder time using Rest in front of it.</p>",

Given Stadium OU's penchant for long games, Ice Beam is a valid choice to fish for a freeze; if every hit connects, Ice Beam should score one around 82% of the time. However, Blizzard is superior in terms of raw damage, notably 2HKOing Exeggutor, which is especially effective if Jynx switches in on a predicted Rest. Psychic complements this for excellent neutral coverage, being Jynx's strongest attack against some uncommon foes like Cloyster, Lapras, and Gengar. Rest lets Jynx stay healthy throughout a game while triggering Stadium Sleep Clause and blocking paralysis attempts from Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Exeggutor. However, Rest must be used carefully, as using it too predictably will leave Jynx helpless against a foe that switches in as it uses Rest. Tauros is particularly problematic, as Jynx being a constant free Tauros switch is very dangerous even in Stadium's less offensive metagame.</p> <p>Outside of Rest, Jynx can use other options, but dropping Rest makes Jynx far more vulnerable to status. Given that Psychic generally hits uncommon foes, Seismic Toss is an alternative that puts more pressure on Psychic-types, making it harder for them to PP stall Jynx's attacking moves. Seismic Toss is useful for dealing with Jynx's Substitute issues, breaking Alakazam and Starmie's Substitute easily and also helping against Slowbro; however, because these are uncommon sights, the move is niche. 7 Defense DVs alongside Counter guarantees a KO if Jynx lands Counter against Tauros's Body Slam. Alternatively, Mimic can be used to take a potentially more useful move, such as Recover or Thunder Wave from Alakazam and Starmie. Substitute is usable for scouting switches and protecting Jynx from paralysis, but the offensive cost is quite steep. Jynx should generally be used on teams that appreciate its sleep-inducing prowess for high payoffs, such as those with Zapdos, Rhydon, or Slowbro.</p>"

In addition, its superb base 110 Speed lets it outpace most Pokemon in the metagame and grants it a noteworthy critical hit rate of 18%. However, Tauros has to avoid status at all costs to remain a threat. The reduced viability of Hyper Beam compared to standard RBY does it no favors either, as it now has more difficulty breaking through staples like Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Chansey, as well as knocking out status inducers before they can cripple it. Tauros can run Substitute to avoid status, but this drops Tauros's HP to the point of putting it in 2HKO range of many common threats. Despite these shortcomings, Tauros is a great pick for most Stadium OU teams.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Standard": {
        "description": "<p>Body Slam is Tauros's main attacking option; its paralysis chance on most Pokemon makes switching into it difficult. Blizzard 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and has a 32.1% chance to 3HKO Exeggutor. It also carries a small freeze chance, which gives Tauros the option to fish for an effective KO in a desperate situation. Substitute protects Tauros from status and critical hits and is a useful tool for sweeping. Double-Edge can be used instead; it is guaranteed to 2HKO Alakazam, and its greater power than Body Slam gives Tauros more room to finish off foes before they can threaten it. It comes at the cost of recoil damage, although this can be avoided if Tauros scores a KO or destroys a Substitute. There are a few moves that can fit in the last moveslot. Stomp's flinch chance allows Tauros to put threats in range of its other moves without taking damage. It is especially effective against paralyzed foes, as they will only have a 52.5% chance to move, and it is also safer if Tauros is behind a Substitute, as it won't risk paralysis or damage. Earthquake usually KOes Jolteon after a Body Slam and 2HKOes the rare Gengar, which walls Tauros otherwise. Furthermore, it hits Rhydon and the uncommon Golem and Kabutops for super effective damage while dealing decent damage to Chansey, should it switch in predicting Blizzard. Tauros can use it to avoid Counter from Chansey, though Counter sees little use. Alternatively, Thunderbolt 3HKOes Starmie, Slowbro, and the uncommon Cloyster and Kabutops. Cloyster is notably able to wall Tauros if it lacks Thunderbolt.</p> <p>Tauros wants to avoid damage and status whenever it can to best use its offensive abilities and avoid being disadvantaged in a potential mirror matchup. Thus, using Tauros means having it active whenever possible while keeping it as healthy as possible. A good way to get mileage out of it while keeping it safe is to switch it in on sleeping or frozen Pokemon, a predicted Rest, or a predicted switch. Another, slightly riskier option is to switch into a predicted Recover or Soft-Boiled from a paralyzed Pokemon; if they get paralyzed when trying to recover, Tauros can finish them off. Substitute should generally be saved for the late-game, as using it once puts Tauros in 2HKO range of common threats like Rhydon, Exeggutor, Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Starmie. Besides the listed options, very few other moves are worth considering on Tauros. Hyper Beam is still incredibly powerful and will allow it to reliably break through Chansey and Exeggutor, but it's much less appealing because it always forces a recharge turn, even if it misses. However, it can work if Tauros is behind a Substitute to protect it from paralysis on the following turn. Fire Blast has a high burn chance, which can be useful against enemy Tauros and Snorlax, but it's a weaker choice in Stadium, as the latter can wipe off the Attack loss with Rest.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Flareon experiences a stark shift from its original role in cartridge RBY, now functioning as a Focus Energy user in Stadium OU. Once boosted, Flareon becomes extremely threatening, with even Fire-resistant Pokemon like Slowbro and Starmie taking over 40% if Fire Blast lands a critical hit thereafter. It's not just a strong special attacker either; Flareon has a solid base 130 Attack stat to support it against Pokemon like Chansey, which it can 2HKO with consecutive critical hit Body Slams. If an opposing team has been paralyzed, Flareon can savagely rip into it with some of the strongest mixed offense available.</p> <p>However, that's about all Flareon can offer: its firepower is no joke, but it's terrible on the defensive, taking serious damage from any attack, having zero defensive utility in its typing, and lacking reliable recovery. Its Speed also leaves a bit to be desired, with it being narrowly outrun by Cloyster, often meaning it requires paralysis support to be effective; this also makes it terrified of receiving paralysis itself. Because it demands paralysis support and offers little defensive utility, Flareon is difficult to build around. Additionally, it has no consistent methods of handling Water-types like Starmie and Slowbro, forcing it out and giving these two powerhouses significant momentum. Furthermore, Flareon is extremely inconsistent, relying on consecutive critical hits to KO Pokemon, which tend to only happen around a third of the time at best even after Focus Energy. Ergo, Flareon is a rare sight in the metagame.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Boasting a 58% critical hit rate when Focus Energy is used, Flareon can deal massive damage to anything it hits with critical hit Fire Blast, even possessing chances to OHKO Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Tauros. In fact, even Rhydon can take up to 60% while being outsped, though that KO is extremely risky to go for. The burn chance is also very helpful, crippling Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros while also aiding in KO ranges; however, landing a burn against Pokemon like Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey can make it significantly harder to beat them in the long run. Body Slam complements Fire Blast well, making Flareon more self-sufficient with paralysis while 2HKOing Chansey and Starmie with consecutive critical hits; however, it's recommended to use Substitute first in this scenario to avoid paralysis. A single critical hit can also put Alakazam into sub-25% range, meaning it cannot use Substitute thereafter; this also puts it in range for Quick Attack to KO. Quick Attack can be used to pick off Pokemon that barely survive Flareon's attacks, or that alternatively have used Substitute to the point they're left with 1 HP. However, Flareon can use Substitute itself for additional safety against paralysis users like Chansey and Exeggutor. It's worth attempting to set up Substitute against paralyzed Pokemon to try and get it for free with full paralysis. However, this is inconsistent, as setting up both Substitute and Focus Energy naturally means giving the opponent free turns, meaning the turns spent can be for naught.</p> <p>Flareon has minor potential to be customized further; generally, the fourth moveslot is used. Double-Edge is a valid option, providing a good option to finish off limping Pokemon or pressure Substitute users while avoiding recoil. Additionally, a critical hit Double-Edge can KO Alakazam if it's taken minor damage or used Substitute. Flamethrower is also a fair option as an accurate Fire Blast alternative with far more PP, but the drop in damage is significant. While Hyper Beam's downsides are poor, a critical hit can OHKO Chansey, Jolteon, and Alakazam while KOing Starmie if it's taken even minute damage, though the recharge turn usually leads to Flareon taking paralysis right after.</p> <p>Flareon is best used late-game when the opposing team has likely been paralyzed, though it can also be used to punish a Snorlax or Exeggutor asleep from Rest, which are decently common sights in the Stadium OU metagame. From there, Flareon can set up Focus Energy with impunity and start firing off potentially nuclear blows at the opposing team. While its consistency is poor, the reward often means removing crucial parts of the opposing team, which Flareon's teammates should greatly appreciate. Flareon works best alongside Pokemon that can consistently land paralysis on the opposing team, such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Because it struggles to break past Slowbro, Starmie, and the rare Kabutops, it's recommended to use it alongside consistent checks to them, such as Thunderbolt Chansey alongside Exeggutor.</p>"

  "Articuno": {
    "overview": "<p>Articuno possesses the most powerful unboosted special attack in the game in its Blizzard, giving it offensive prowess rivaled only by the less consistent Moltres. This alone grants Articuno a strong niche in the tier, outspeeding and 2HKOing the mighty Exeggutor. This offense is backed by a reasonable 15% critical hit rate, with critical hit Blizzard OHKOing even Tauros. With Agility, Articuno can function as a late-game sweeper that is very difficult to stop when the stage is set. This is because it isn't just a strong offensive threat: it's also quite bulky, winning against Tauros one-on-one, or even Zapdos if at +2 Speed. Because of the increased presence of Rest Exeggutor, there are many opportunities for Articuno to switch in and turn the game on its head with nuclear damage output.</p> <p>However, Articuno has some deep pitfalls that make it difficult to use in Stadium OU. Team Preview is a massive hit to its viability, removing all surprise factor that helps set up for a sweep in cartridge play. Articuno only has Normal-type coverage and a poor Attack stat to use it with, so Pokemon like Chansey and Starmie, as well as the rarer Lapras and Cloyster, tend to wall it out. Additionally, its valuable Speed, while high relative to OU, means paralysis inducers force it out, which is worsened by Agility not negating the paralysis Speed drop, unlike standard play. It can use Rest to get rid of it, but this isn't ideal. Due to these flaws, Articuno can be seen as very linear, but its immense power is nothing to sneeze at.</p>",

      "Special Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>Articuno's Blizzard is the main reason it sees play, OHKOing Rhydon, Golem, and the rare Nidoking; it also 2HKOes a majority of the tier, notably Exeggutor, Tauros, Zapdos, Persian, Kangaskhan, and Alakazam after using Substitute once. The freeze chance also cannot be ignored, giving Articuno a degree of volatility that means even consistent checks like Chansey aren't safe. Double-Edge allows Articuno to consistently pressure Substitute without losing valuable PP against users such as Chansey and Alakazam. It also pressures Blizzard-resistant Pokemon like Starmie and Lapras. Rest is crucial for allowing Articuno to make use of its bulk, giving it staying power against Snorlax and Tauros while removing the Speed drop from paralysis.</p> <p>The third moveslot defines how Articuno will act for its team. Ice Beam acts as a weaker alternative to Blizzard with more PP while still finishing off Exeggutor, ensuring a sustained assault; it can also let Articuno fish for a freeze against big targets like Chansey. Reflect is a viable third option for a bulky approach, stonewalling Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros without much effort; they require two critical hit Body Slams to stop it from repeatedly using Rest if Reflect is active. Reflect doesn't protect Articuno from Persian, though, and it's threatened with a 3HKO from Slash. Agility lets Articuno take a late-game sweeping approach, which, combined with Rest, can be difficult for weakened teams to stop.</p> <p>Articuno cannot break through bulky Water-types, so it's best to cut your losses and have its teammates deal with them. Articuno is often used alongside Thunderbolt Chansey, Zapdos, or Jolteon, forming a two-pronged special offense that can be difficult for teams to counter; Jolteon also appreciates Articuno's Ground immunity. Additionally, Pokemon like Tauros and the ubiquitous Snorlax, which can muscle past physically frail Pokemon like Alakazam, are also of great assistance; Self-Destruct Snorlax also tends to help against Pokemon like Slowbro. Rhydon warrants consideration for reducing the holes opened up by Articuno's weaknesses to Electric and Rock. Gengar shuts down Persian offensively, has good Speed, and has access to Thunderbolt, all of which highly benefit Articuno; Gengar's Explosion also puts Chansey in KO range for Articuno's Double-Edge. Articuno functions best late-game when its bulky Water-type checks have been removed, though Team Preview often makes the opponent less inclined to use them, which frequently means aggressive double switching is necessary to force them in earlier than usual. Articuno can function as a mid-game tank if the opponent lacks a good check. If using Agility and intending to sweep, it's best to bring Articuno in upon a forced Rest from Pokemon like Exeggutor, letting it set up and attempt to muscle past. Articuno can arguably run Hyper Beam alongside Double-Edge despite the drawbacks, namely to finish off Starmie and Chansey from a minimum of 33.4% and 37.9%, respectively. However, it is somewhat difficult to fit into its moveset and comes at severe opportunity cost outside of these matchups.</p>"
