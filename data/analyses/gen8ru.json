        "description": "<p>Shiftry is the most viable Chlorophyll sweeper in the tier, being able to muscle past common checks to Grass-types and sweep with its near perfect coverage at +2. Solar Blade helps Shiftry wallbreak more effectively if run on full sun teams, although Leaf Blade is more consistent once sun runs out and against other weather teams. Knock Off provides wide neutral coverage, hitting Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Noivern, Metagross, and Galarian Slowbro. Low Kick hits most Steel-types harder and has a chance to 2HKO Incineroar. Heat Wave is boosted by sun, hitting Fairy-types like Galarian Weezing and Togekiss neutrally as well as OHKOing Chople Berry Cobalion and Heracross, but it misses out on Incineroar and hits most Low Kick targets such as Registeel for slightly lower damage. Protect is an option that significantly improves Shiftry's matchup against teams that rely on Golisopod to check sun, although it sacrifices a valuable move.</p> <p>Shiftry only fits on teams with sun setters, so Torkoal or Ninetales is a mandatory partner. Torkoal fits best on full sun teams, providing Stealth Rock and setup opportunities with Yawn, while Ninetales is more of a standalone wallbreaker that can form a semi-sun core with Shiftry. Darmanitan can also take advantage of sun, breaking down the opposing team's defensive structure and bring Shiftry into Water-types with U-turn. Heliolisk can similarly wallbreak under sun and pivot out of Ground-types. Entry hazard removal is necessary, as sun teams will often have multiple hazard-weak Pokemon, and Shiftry can get chipped into KO range of priority moves easily. Defog Noivern is a good utility option for this role, while Xatu can bounce back hazards and pivot with Teleport. Other hazard setters such as Rhyperior and Cobalion are needed if running Ninetales.</p>"

Earthquake hits Fire- and Steel-types like Chandelure, Registeel, and Metagross. Knock Off ensures it doesn't get walled by Bronzong and debilitates switch-ins like Golisopod and Milotic. A Jolly nature is preferred over Adamant, even with Slush Rush, to outspeed Choice Scarf Flygon. Wide Lens as the item allows all hits of Triple Axel to land more often. Alternatively, Alolan Sandslash can opt for power over accuracy with Life Orb, OHKOing threats like Registeel, Metagross, and Umbreon with boosted Earthquake and Triple Axel, respectively.</p> <p>On full hail teams, Aurorus and Abomasnow get hail up and further help Alolan Sandslash to set up and sweep, as they gift Stealth Rock and check Water-types, respectively. On said full hail teams, Arctovish is an amazing partner that breaks down bulkier walls like Umbreon and Gastrodon, paving the way for Alolan Sandslash late-game. Alolan Sandslash also works on semi-hail teams, with Vanilluxe as the hail setter instead. On semi-hail, Alolan Sandslash has a better defensive typing than Arctovish, making it more resilient to revenge killing from Golisopod and Gardevoir, alongside giving it a setup opportunity versus Crobat. Under hail, Alolan Sandslash can also outspeed Choice Scarf Flygon, unlike Arctovish. Alolan Sandslash struggles with breaking through bulky Water-types like Milotic, but Vanilluxe helps in this regard with Freeze-Dry. Electric-types like Raikou and Xurkitree also assist against bulky Water-types without having to risk your hail setter. Calm Mind Raikou can benefit from hail with an Ice-type Weather Ball to hit Ground-, Grass-, and Dragon-types in one move. As Steel-types like Bronzong and Registeel tend to wall Alolan Sandslash without any prior chip damage, it appreciates Fighting- or Ground-types like Heracross or Nidoqueen, or entry hazards like Spikes from Klefki and Golisopod, to soften them up for a viable sweep. Fire- and Fighting-types also threaten Alolan Sandslash, so it appreciates teammates than can take care of them like Milotic, Xatu, Crobat, and Nidoqueen. In return, it removes pesky Grass- and Ground-types for them.</p>"

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is both a premier offensive Stealth Rock setter and a devastating Sheer Force wallbreaker with few safe switch-ins. It can forgo Stealth Rock altogether to run a dedicated wallbreaker set, which can even get past some usual answers like Umbreon, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Bronzong with the right moves. Nidoqueen's typing lends it crucial resistances like Fighting and an immunity to Electric, which lets it check prominent Pokemon such as Lucario and Raikou. Most importantly, however, is having that Electric immunity without a Grass weakness, which lets it check Xurkitree and block its Volt Switch, a trait only shared by Steelix. However, Nidoqueen's lack of reliable recovery severely cuts into how long it can check a foe. At best, it might check a Pokemon like Xurkitree twice, but Nidoqueen can take full advantage of these opportunities to punish the opponent with an onslaught of Sheer Force + Life Orb boosted attacks. Nidoqueen's slightly below average Speed is just enough to get the jump on various threats such as Metagross and Bewear, but it barely misses out on a lot of other prevalent threats like Togekiss, Gardevoir, and Xurkitree. This often leads to worse matchups against fast-paced teams, as Nidoqueen will have fewer opportunities to set Stealth Rock or get an attack off against faster foes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A specially defensive set with Black Sludge is viable on balance and stall teams as a solid switch-in to Xurkitree, but it competes with Steelix and is harder to fit elsewhere, as more offensive teams heavily value Nidoqueen's wallbreaking ability. With Choice Scarf, Nidoqueen can outspeed and surprise KO revenge killers such as Flygon, Gardevoir, and Celebi, but outside of the surprise factor, it's generally outclassed by other Choice Scarf users due to its lower Speed tier. Nidoqueen can set Toxic Spikes, but the abundance of Poison-types such as opposing Nidoqueen and Roserade, Heavy-Duty Boots users, and ungrounded Pokemon, such as Crobat and Flygon, leaves few relevant targets for the move. Focus Blast with a Modest nature 2HKOes Umbreon and Porygon2 after Stealth Rock, but Nidoqueen already has more reliable methods to deal with both in Taunt and Toxic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Umbreon, and the rarer Porygon2 can comfortably switch into any of Nidoqueen's attacks; Reuniclus, in particular, does this well, as it out-heals any damage it takes with Regenerator. However, all of them need to watch out for Toxic, and Umbreon also fears Taunt. Snorlax can switch in with ease and use Nidoqueen as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Certain bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Jellicent, and Vaporeon sport high enough special bulk to comfortably switch into Nidoqueen. However, the former two will lose in the long run to sets with Toxic, and all of them fear the rare Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Common faster threats such as Flygon, Starmie, and Gardevoir can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen but can't safely switch in. Gardevoir can even copy Sheer Force with Trace to boost its moves and make it harder for Nidoqueen's teammates to deal with it.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong</strong>: Thanks to Levitate, Bronzong hard counters any Nidoqueen set without Fire Blast.</p>",

Ice Beam OHKOes Flygon and 2HKOes Crobat, both of which Nidoqueen can't touch without it. Sheer Force, alongside Life Orb, lets Nidoqueen OHKO or 2HKO most of the tier except the bulkiest of special walls. Still, Shuca Berry is a valid option to check Flygon and other Ground-types Nidoqueen lures in. 16 Defense EVs can be run with Shuca Berry so Nidoqueen isn't OHKOed by Outrage from Choice Band Flygon. 24 Special Defense EVs avoid the 2HKO from Xurkitree's Energy Ball.</p> <p>Heracross, Togekiss, and Pangoro can all take advantage of Nidoqueen's switch-ins such as Assault Vest Reuniclus and Umbreon. Pivots such as Crobat and Noivern can provide free switches with U-turn against Steel- and Rock-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Diancie. Crobat and Noivern also help check Fighting-types, which Nidoqueen can't reliably do on its own, as can Reuniclus and Galarian Weezing. Dark-types such as Umbreon, Incineroar, and Guzzlord can check Psychic-types such as Assault Vest Reuniclus and Celebi, while Steel-types such as Metagross and Escavalier can take on Calm Mind Reuniclus and Gardevoir. Umbreon deserves special mention, as it also keeps Nidoqueen healthy throughout the match with Wish. Electric- and Grass-types such as Xurkitree, Celebi, and Rotom-C take care of bulky Water-types, and Grass-types are also crucial for Electric-types like Xurkitree, Raikou, and Rotom-C, which can otherwise overwhelm Nidoqueen with either repeated strong attacks or super effective coverage. Water-types such as Milotic, Golisopod, and Vaporeon help with common Ground-types like Flygon. Golisopod also provides Spikes to help Nidoqueen out-damage Assault Vest Reuniclus's Regenerator healing and wear down other switch-ins like Umbreon, while, similarly to Umbreon, Vaporeon can heal it with Wish.</p>"

On the other hand, Taunt prevents one of its most common counters, Umbreon, from healing up with Wish and ultimately lets Nidoqueen beat it. Fire Blast 2HKOes Bronzong, which otherwise completely stonewalls Nidoqueen, but it's less prevalent than Nidoqueen's other counters. Thunderbolt is an option to 2HKO bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Jellicent, and Vaporeon after Stealth Rock. The 24 Special Defense EVs ensure Energy Ball from Xurkitree doesn't 2HKO Nidoqueen.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Heracross, Pangoro, and Bewear can take advantage of Nidoqueen's usual answers, primarily Reuniclus and Umbreon. Special wallbreakers such as Starmie, Xurkitree, and Celebi especially appreciate Taunt Nidoqueen because it prevents special walls like Umbreon from healing. Pivots such as Crobat, Noivern, and Tornadus can provide free switches with U-turn against Steel- and Rock-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Diancie. The former two also help Nidoqueen check Fighting-types, which it can't do on its own, while the latter can help break through Umbreon with Superpower. Steel-types such as Registeel, Metagross, Stakataka, and Bronzong halt any Psychic-types like Gardevoir and Celebi trying to take advantage of Nidoqueen. Water-types such as Milotic, Golisopod, and Vaporeon can soak up hits from Ground-types such as Flygon. Golisopod also provides Spikes, which lets Nidoqueen push past Assault Vest Reuniclus without needing Toxic and more quickly whittle down Umbreon if Nidoqueen is running Toxic. Meanwhile, Vaporeon is noteworthy for its Wish support, which keeps Nidoqueen healthy throughout the match. Grass-types such as Celebi, Dhelmise, and Roserade can deal with Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon, and they help Nidoqueen check Electric-types such as Xurkitree, Raikou, and Rotom-C, which can otherwise overwhelm it with either repeated strong hits or super effective coverage.</p>"

Unfortunately, Vileplume can get worn down quickly and is often forced to use its recovery to remain healthy, which gives openings to Pokemon it invites in like Chandelure and common Flying-types such as Noivern and Togekiss. Strength Sap is Vileplume's main recovery move and allows it to lower the Attack stat of an opposing physical attacker. Corrosive Gas is used to remove important items such as Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Choice items from Pokemon such as Registeel, Crobat, and Toxtricity. Alternatively, Sleep Powder can be used to put common switch-ins such as Crobat and Noivern to sleep, generating free turns for itself and its teammates. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 SpD can be used to avoid a 4HKO from Xurkitree's Thunderbolt. Vileplume is best suited for balance teams that need a check for prominent physical attackers such as Sharpedo and Mimikyu. Due to Vileplume's weakness to Fire-types, bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can be great teammates. In return, Vileplume can handle offensive Electric-types such as Xurkitree and Raikou. Since Vileplume often invites in Flying-types like Crobat and Tornadus, checks to these Pokemon such as Xurkitree and Raikou are good partners. Registeel and Steelix also make great teammates for Vileplume, since they are able to check offensive Psychic-types such as Gardevoir. Since Vileplume often switches into pivots, taking damage from entry hazards can quickly wear it down and limit its defensive capabilities, so entry hazard removal from Starmie or Crobat is important.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Shell Smash Cloyster's ability to potentially break past its checks through flinches make it a threatening setup sweeper. It also takes advantage of teams relying on Seismitoad and Gastrodon as their bulky Water-type, as neither is a suitable Cloyster check. Rock Blast hits Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune neutrally, helping Cloyster beat them with flinches. It also hits Volcanion and can be used against other Fire-types like Incineroar and Chandelure. Hydro Pump is the preferred last move due to its greater damage against Steel-types such as Metagross, Cobalion, and Steelix. Liquidation can be used instead to OHKO Diancie and potentially 2HKO Registeel after Spikes damage while also giving Cloyster a more reliable Water-type STAB move. However, it makes Cloyster more reliant on breaking past the aforementioned Steel-types with flinches. King's Rock gives Cloyster's Icicle Spear and Rock Blast an effective 41% flinch chance. A Naive or Jolly nature should be used, as they allow +2 Cloyster to outrun Choice Scarf Mienshao. Explosion can be used to take down Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune for a teammate. Focus Sash can be used to almost guarantee setup, but this requires solid entry hazard removal, and Cloyster loses out on the ability to break past its checks with flinches. Life Orb is another item option that allows Cloyster to KO notable threats such as Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, Metagross, and Doublade at +2 without prior residual damage. Spikes allows Cloyster, which beats most Defoggers, to give value to its team in a matchup where it doesn't do much else. However, Spikes also forces Cloyster to ditch its Water-type STAB moves, which worsens its matchup against Steel-types significantly.</p> <p>Cloyster's natural physical bulk is impressive even without investment and gives it some notable setup opportunities against Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Crobat lacking Taunt, and Mimikyu. Cloyster is potentially capable of breaking past its defensive answers with flinches, but this requires a fair bit of luck. Bulky Water- and Steel-types can halt Cloyster barring an ill-timed flinch, so efforts should be put into wearing these Pokemon down. Most of the tier's bulky Steel-types will get worn down by Spikes; offensive Metagross, Cobalion, and Doublade will be in KO range of +2 Hydro Pump after switching in with three layers of Spikes, while Liquidation variants will be able to reliably 2HKO Registeel after two layers. Therefore, Spikes setters like Klefki and Roserade are good teammates. Cloyster's ability to take advantage of Spikes and cause its targets to flinch makes it a great choice for hyper offense teams, as it can be a devastating wincon or a supportive wallbreaker for another sweeping teammate such as Necrozma, Mimikyu, or Polteageist. Cloyster is also capable of sweeping on standard offensive and bulky offensive teams. Teams utilizing Cloyster in this regard should attempt to wear down bulky Water- and Steel-types. Knock Off from the likes of Incineroar, Reuniclus, and Obstagoon can remove Leftovers from Pokemon like Registeel and Suicune, making it easier for Cloyster to break through them. Pivoting teammates, such as Mienshao, Incineroar, and Crobat, can get Cloyster into battle safely. Toxic from Diancie and Salazzle can help wear down Water-types to let Cloyster go wild late-game.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Although stiff competition from Pangoro, Golurk, and Heracross makes it niche, Alolan Marowak is an effective wallbreaker for offensive teams due to its combination of extreme power and defensive utility. Alolan Marowak's strong attacks, Thick Club, and offensive typing let it easily force out common slow, bulky Pokemon such as Registeel and Reuniclus, giving it opportunities to fire off powerful attacks or set up Substitute. A useful set of resistances and a great ability in Lightning Rod allow Alolan Marowak to take advantage of Xurkitree to come into play, as well as soft checking other threats like Roserade and Lucario. However, Alolan Marowak's defensive utility ends there. Its abysmal Speed and weaknesses to common offensive types such as Water, Dark, Ground, and Ghost leave it unable to check certain Electric-types such as Raikou, and it's vulnerable to dangerous wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Nidoqueen, and Chandelure and faster defensive Pokemon like Milotic. Furthermore, Alolan Marowak's lack of reliable recovery and Stealth Rock weakness limit its opportunities to come in, especially against Xurkitree.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flare Blitz can be situationally used alongside Rock Head to greatly increase Alolan Marowak's wallbreaking prowess; it notably allows Alolan Marowak to 2HKO Umbreon, almost always OHKO Steelix after Stealth Rock, and always OHKO Bewear after Stealth Rock. However, losing Lightning Rod forfeits what little defensive utility Alolan Marowak has. Alolan Marowak could use Swords Dance to reach nuclear levels of power, but it will rarely find worthwhile situations to set up due to its low Speed and bulk, and therefore Substitute and Stealth Rock are often more productive options. However, on Trick Room teams, Alolan Marowak employs Swords Dance with Rock Head and a moveset of Poltergeist, Flare Blitz, and Low Kick to become near impossible to switch into; regardless, it is worth noting that Trick Room teams are highly matchup reliant and inconsistent.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Alolan Marowak cannot run Heavy-Duty Boots and has no recovery, so Stealth Rock severely cuts into its health and, over time, chips it into KO range of Pokemon it checks, such as Xurkitree and Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Milotic outspeeds Alolan Marowak, can heal off from most of its attacks, and can respond with Scald. Suicune and Seismitoad also outspeed Alolan Marowak and can force it out to set up Calm Mind and Stealth Rock, respectively, but must be careful due to their lack of recovery. Vaporeon and Quagsire can take most of Alolan Marowak's attacks and attempt to stall out Poltergeist, though they cannot safely switch into a Ghost-type STAB move. Though they cannot switch in, offensive Water-types such as Sharpedo and Starmie force Alolan Marowak out easily with the threat of an OHKO.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Incineroar's great bulk and Intimidate let it switch into Alolan Marowak's STAB moves with ease and force it out with the threat of Knock Off; however, it must be wary of Low Kick. Umbreon, if fully healthy, can stall out any of Alolan Marowak's moves save for Flare Blitz and nearly OHKO back with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Flygon can OHKO Alolan Marowak with Earthquake and force it out to gain momentum with U-turn or set up with Dragon Dance. Nidoqueen and Golurk can easily OHKO Alolan Marowak and fire off powerful attacks on its forced switch, but they struggle to come in against it. Rhyperior and Steelix can each take a single hit from Alolan Marowak at full health and trade with it in a pinch, although Steelix's Earthquake fails to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Powerful special attackers, such as Choice Specs Gardevoir, have no problem forcing Alolan Marowak out and threatening its team in the process. Among these threats, Raikou and Toxtricity stand out as Electric-types that Alolan Marowak cannot reliably check due to their coverage moves in Scald and Snarl, respectively, while Togekiss can both survive a hit from Alolan Marowak and flinch it down with Air Slash.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal</strong>: Alolan Marowak relies on its Thick Club for its damage output, and therefore any Pokemon that can remove it is a great annoyance. Pokemon that Alolan Marowak would otherwise solidly check, such as Rotom-C, Vileplume, and Salazzle, can put a damper on its effectiveness with Trick, Corrosive Gas, and Knock Off.</p>",

Alolan Marowak uses Shadow Bone alongside Poltergeist because it is perfectly accurate and gives Alolan Marowak's teammates more freedom to carry Knock Off. Alternatively, Substitute eases prediction on forced switches and shields Alolan Marowak from faster Pokemon. Stealth Rock is a viable option in the last moveslot, if none of Alolan Marowak's teammates carry it, due to the amount of switches Alolan Marowak forces, but it makes Alolan Marowak less self-sufficient as a wallbreaker; additionally, Alolan Marowak can struggle to keep Stealth Rock up throughout a game due to its lack of longevity.</p> <p>Alolan Marowak appreciates partners that can relieve pressure on it to check Electric-types; Flygon and Nidoqueen are both good candidates for this role. Furthermore, the former can bring Alolan Marowak in with U-turn, while the latter can wallbreak alongside it. Other Pokemon that can pivot Alolan Marowak into battle safely, such as Crobat and Heliolisk, are great partners too. Heliolisk in particular is one of Alolan Marowak's best partners, as it can switch into Water-types and pressure faster threats such as Togekiss and Nidoqueen, while Alolan Marowak can crush Heliolisk's slower checks, such as Steelix. Other Water-type switch-ins, such as Starmie and Guzzlord, are important to cover Alolan Marowak's most common weakness; Guzzlord can also handle Ghost- and Dark-types such as Chandelure and mixed Sharpedo, which threaten Alolan Marowak. On the other hand, Alolan Marowak lures in bulky Water-types very effectively and forces damage on them, which helps faster attackers such as Aerodactyl, Flygon, and Sharpedo break through them more easily. Entry hazard control is necessary to allow Alolan Marowak to come into play more often; Crobat, Flygon, Tsareena, and Starmie are all excellent options that can account for some of its weaknesses and bring it into battle with U-turn or Teleport. Klefki, Heracross, and Golisopod all carry Spikes to augment Alolan Marowak's wallbreaking potential, letting it 2HKO Umbreon with Low Kick after only a single layer. The former two can additionally absorb Knock Off to preserve Alolan Marowak's Thick Club.</p>"

However, Galarian Weezing's mediocre special bulk, lack of consistent recovery, and general passivity make it harder to support and fit on teams than its Fairy-type competition of Togekiss and Diancie. Sludge Bomb is preferred over Sludge Wave for its higher chance of poisoning. Galarian Weezing can be used as a Defogger, though it dislikes some Stealth Rock setters such as Metagross and Nidoqueen. Toxic Spikes can be useful for crippling Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Milotic, and Diancie, but it's matchup-dependent due to the prevalence of Heavy-Duty Boots and the large amount of viable Poison- and Steel-types such as Roserade, Registeel, and Metagross. It additionally faces competition from Nidoqueen for this role who offers much less passivity at the cost of some defensive utility. Pain Split gives Galarian Weezing a form of recovery, albeit an unreliable one. Will-O-Wisp burns threats such as Bewear, Mimikyu, and Cloyster. Corrosive Gas can be used to remove items from the likes of Roserade, Registeel, and Chandelure. Rest is a viable option on stall teams, but stall is a rather unreliable playstyle as a whole. Black Sludge is preferred to give Galarian Weezing more survivability. Rocky Helmet can be used to force more damage onto the likes of Golisopod and Heracross, but should only be used with dedicated Wish support.

Wish passing from the likes of Umbreon is useful and practically mandatory on stall, as Galarian Weezing lacks reliable recovery. Variants running Toxic Spikes can be supported by bulky Calm Mind sweepers like Suicune. Threats to Poison-types such as Nidoqueen, Gardevoir, and Flygon are important on such teams.</p>"

Starmie's phenomenal Speed tier and ability to force foes out with its great super effective coverage also make it an exceptional wallbreaker and allow it to take advantage of Analytic. Its bulk uninvested is unimpressive however, limiting opportunities for offensive sets to come into battle or forcing Starmie to click Recover instead of attacking. Specially defensive walls like Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Umbreon also prove difficult to beat without Analytic boosts. Starmie has to fear being picked off by First Impression from Golisopod and other naturally fast Pokemon like Raikou and Noivern that can take advantage of Starmie's frailty and force it out.</p>",

It also has a good stall matchup because it can infinitely replenish PP and copy utility moves. Ditto's EVs just maximize its physical bulk and minimize Speed in case of the rare Ditto mirror matchup, while the Impish nature and 4 Speed IVs with a Choice Scarf allow it to outspeed Galarian Weezing, which can block Imposter by activating Neutralizing Gas. An alternative spread with 0 Speed IVs and a Relaxed nature maximizes Ditto's chances of winning mirror matchups.</p> <p>Ditto can fit on a team mainly looking for a revenge killer to deal with a range of threats that cannot be walled by a single Pokemon and could break through the team. Thus, it's a solid pick with a defensive backbone. In return, defensive teammates can switch into offensive foes for it. Ditto can also fit on offensive teams that have very little defensive backbone, revenge killing threats that could run through the team and patching up the stall matchup. Ditto in turn appreciates offensive breakers such as Toxtricity and Heracross helping its shaky matchup against balance teams. It also needs teammates that can beat Substitute users like Suicune; countermeasures to these Pokemon include Infiltrator Pokemon such as Toxic Crobat and Noivern. Entry hazard removers like Togekiss can also be helpful for Ditto to reliably switch into threats. Cleric support from Pokemon like Umbreon and Sylveon prevents Toxic from stopping Ditto against stall teams. Finally, Knock Off absorbers like Bewear and Galarian Weezing can be vital, as Ditto losing its Choice Scarf means it will be unable to revenge kill offensive threats.</p>"

Furthermore, Vaporeon faces heavy competition as a cleric from Umbreon due to its typing and superior bulk, which allow Umbreon to check Chandelure better, as an example. Wish provides recovery for both Vaporeon and its teammates, while Protect ensures it can take advantage of Wish while also scouting Choice item users like Chandelure. While Heal Bell is standard, Flip Turn lets Vaporeon pivot and safely pass Wish to its teammates instead. Leftovers provides Vaporeon with passive recovery, which can be crucial throughout a long game, while Heavy-Duty Boots gives it more longevity on teams with weak or no hazard removal. Alternate EV spreads are possible for Vaporeon: 56 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed maximum Speed Rhyperior, while 96 Speed EVs outspeed Alolan Marowak.</p> <p>Vaporeon fits best on bulky balance teams, as they have the staying power to take advantage of Wish and cleric support. Bulky Steel-types like Steelix and Registeel appreciate Wish and Vaporeon switching into Fire-type moves aimed at them, while they can take advantage of the Grass-types that come in on Vaporeon. Furthermore, wallbreakers such as Lucario, Alolan Marowak, and Choice Band Flygon also switch into Grass-types, as well as Electric-types. They can also take advantage of Vaporeon's Wish and Flip Turn support. Diancie can act as the team's cleric, freeing Vaporeon to use Flip Turn's slow pivoting, which is extremely potent combined with Wish.

Life Orb is preferred, but Heavy-Duty Boots does grant Aerodactyl Stealth Rock immunity and lacks Life Orb's recoil, which makes setting up easier.

  "Snorlax": {
    "overview": "<p>Snorlax either sweeps entire teams at team preview or does nothing of note, with the latter happening more frequently than the former. Simply put, Snorlax struggles against common top-tier Pokemon such as Metagross, Reuniclus, and Rhyperior, so pulling off a sweep will often be an uphill battle. Snorlax does, however, have some amazing upsides to justify building a team around it. Mainly, Snorlax is a behemoth of a special tank and can check and set up against some of the tier's most dangerous special attackers such as Nidoqueen, Calm Mind Raikou, and Chandelure. However, Snorlax's reliance on Rest somewhat negates this, as it's often forced out immediately after using Rest by the likes of Heracross, meaning it's hard to successfully burn sleep turns without taking significant damage in the process. If left unchecked, this can spiral out of control until Snorlax is overwhelmed, or it will be stuck in a Rest cycle and unable to set up and sweep. Entry hazards quickly rack up damage on Snorlax too, which only exacerbates the problem further with each time it's forced out. However, cleric support and entry hazard removal coupled with mindful teambuilding can remedy most of Snorlax's inherent flaws.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Double-Edge and Facade are other feasible STAB options. The extra power of Double-Edge lets Snorlax 2HKO Reuniclus, but the recoil forces it to use Rest much more often. With Facade, Snorlax won't have to worry about healing a burn, but it's an even less reliable option against Reuniclus than Body Slam, as Snorlax needs to be statused to 2HKO and can't paralyze it. Sleep Talk lets Snorlax act when asleep but gives up coverage, so it can't break Steel- and Rock-types and lets Mimikyu set up for free. Snorlax has a wide movepool with a colorful arrange of coverage options that more offensive sets such as Choice Band and offensive Curse can take full advantage of. For example, Seed Bomb can lure in and heavily damage Rhyperior, which can check standard CurseLax sets. Despite Thick Fat giving it a different yet useful defensive profile, Choice Band sets face stiff competition from Bewear, which is much faster, has more opportunities to wallbreak, and is harder to revenge kill thanks to Fluffy. Snorlax's low Speed also greatly hinders how effective it is as a wallbreaker. Offensive Curse sets such as Curse + three Attacks focus on wallbreaking rather than attempting to sweep but are even easier to wear down with entry hazards and are almost entirely shut down by a burn or Toxic poison.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Wallbreakers</strong>: Common Fighting-types such as Heracross, Lucario, Pangoro, and Bewear are the most straightforward answers to Snorlax. They might not outright KO Snorlax after a Curse boost, but they'll leave it low enough for their teammates to pick it off. Bewear can switch in and set up on Snorlax thanks to Fluffy. Other physical wallbreakers such as Grimmsnarl, Choice Band Metagross, and Golurk pack strong enough of a punch to overwhelm Snorlax. Grimmsnarl and Golurk can even use Trick to give Snorlax a Choice Band. Likewise, powerful special wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Gardevoir and Toxtricity can 2HKO Snorlax after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Jellicent</strong>: Jellicent completely shuts Snorlax down with Taunt and will slowly but surely defeat it with Scald. However, not all Jellicent carry a move to hit Snorlax with, but burning it with Will-O-Wisp and preventing it from setting up or using Rest will go a long way in beating it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Pokemon</strong>: Rhyperior more commonly handles Snorlax by forcing a Rest with Toxic and its strong Earthquake so a teammate can take advantage of the sleeping Snorlax, but Swords Dance Rhyperior is one of the best checks to Snorlax. The rarer Escavalier and Doublade can similarly comfortably withstand even boosted attacks from Snorlax and set up alongside it to overwhelm it with Swords Dance-boosted moves. However, all of them lack reliable recovery and thus can't check Snorlax for too long. Cosmic Power Metagross stands out as a hard counter to any Curse Snorlax without Darkest Lariat due to it avoiding the 3HKO from Earthquake and 3HKOing back with Body Press, guaranteeing it wins the exchange even when factoring in Rest turns. Nasty Plot Togekiss isn't 2HKOed by +1 Body Slam and induce flinching with +2 Air Slash to beat Snorlax. Reuniclus avoids the 2HKO from even +2 Body Slam and 2HKOes in return with 2+ Focus Blast. But, an untimely full paralysis will lead to Snorlax winning against either of them. Substitute + Protect Suicune can PP stall Snorlax and will 3HKO and beat it before it wakes up with +4 Scald if Snorlax ever uses Rest.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Snorlax is susceptible to all forms of entry hazards and is often forced out multiple times in any given game, so the damage will quickly rack up and can put Snorlax in a foe's KO range.</p> <p><strong>Item Displacement</strong>: Leftovers plays a crucial role in keeping Snorlax healthy, and it'll be much easier to pressure Snorlax with weaker attacks and residual damage once removed. Knock Off users such as Tornadus, Seismitoad, and Incineroar don't immediately scare Snorlax out, which makes it more willing to take the Knock Off. In a similar vein, Galarian Weezing and Vileplume can remove Leftovers with Corrosive Gas. Vileplume can also keep Snorlax at bay with Strength Sap. Pokemon such as Chandelure, Gardevoir, and Togekiss can Trick and hamper Snorlax with a Choice item.</p> <p><strong>Haze and Clear Smog</strong>: Haze Milotic can PP stall and eventually beat Snorlax with Toxic or pivot out to a teammate with Flip Turn once it's asleep. A paralysis from Body Slam can't even save it; not only is Milotic still faster, its Defense is also boosted by Marvel Scale. Similarly, Gastrodon can remove Snorlax's stat boosts with Clear Smog. Still, if paralyzed, it's outsped by Snorlax even after a Curse, which makes it a much shakier answer.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A paralysis from Body Slam slightly increases the odds Snorlax beats Calm Mind Reuniclus and Nasty Plot Togekiss. Earthquake ensures Snorlax has a shot at defeating Steel- and Rock-types such as Lucario, Rhyperior, and Diancie. Darkest Lariat, on the other hand, gives Snorlax a fighting chance against Cosmic Power Metagross and 2HKOes Reuniclus at +2. Rest heals off any otherwise crippling status condition like a burn or Toxic poison, which not only makes it harder to stop Snorlax in its tracks but also makes it a far more reliable counter to Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and Chandelure. Leftovers is crucial for avoiding the 3HKO from Nidoqueen so Snorlax can safely set up and use Rest against it. The EV spread is to avoid the OHKO from Flame Orb Heracross after a Curse and never be 2HKOed by Modest Choice Specs Toxtricity's Boomburst, which more importantly means that no special attacker can 2HKO Snorlax with a non-super effective move. 8 Speed EVs are to outspeed paralyzed Reuniclus even after using Curse twice, which gives Snorlax the highest odds to win the exchange. The leftover EVs are invested in Attack for a slight increase in damage.</p> <p>The key to successfully teambuild with Snorlax is redundancy. Snorlax eats up a lot of resources, and one might get the idea to use it as team compression to make up for that; however, Snorlax will crumble if it's assigned too many roles like the team's primary special wall, status absorber, and sweeper. With this in mind, Snorlax can be paired with other special walls such as Registeel and Diancie because they can check special attackers like Gardevoir, Noivern, and, in the latter's case, Chandelure all while Snorlax acts as a backup. Cleric support from Diancie, Togekiss, and Umbreon is another crucial puzzle piece to teambuilding with Snorlax, letting it use Rest more freely and less often because it can easily be woken up and cured of a burn or poison with Heal Bell. Togekiss also helps Snorlax by weakening shared checks like Rhyperior while also checking Fighting-types. Umbreon stands out because it can Wish pass to Snorlax, which doesn't heal it for much but still keeps it healthy enough to not need to use Rest. Likewise, entry hazard removal provided by Crobat, Flygon, and Dhelmise is a must to prevent it from being quickly overwhelmed. Crobat is also an excellent check to the many Fighting-types threatening Snorlax. Ground- and Grass-types such as Flygon, Gastrodon, and Celebi are crucial because Snorlax can't effectively handle Electric-types such as Xurkitree, Raikou, and Rotom-C due to them easily whittling it down with Volt Switch when aided by entry hazards. Bulky Water-types like Milotic, Gastrodon, and Jellicent are needed to answer Steel- and Rock-types like Escavalier and Rhyperior that Snorlax can struggle to get through. Jellicent is also particularly noteworthy for hard countering Lucario and Cosmic Power Metagross.</p>"

Crobat is the tier's premier entry hazard removal option, as it checks the Spikes users Roserade, Heracross, and Golisopod, and it's highly practical to fit Defog on a Pokemon with already-good role compression. Crobat possesses many other great support moves like U-turn to support wallbreakers, Super Fang to weaken the likes of Registeel and Rhyperior, Toxic for crippling bulky switch-ins, and Taunt to prevent setup and recovery attempts. Crobat also has an excellent Nasty Plot set that threatens to sweep, and it can turn the tables on typical Steel- and Rock-type counters like Steelix, Registeel, and Rhyperior with boosted Heat Wave and Giga Drain. However, as a Defogger, Crobat has poor matchups against most Stealth Rock setters like Registeel, Steelix, and Metagross. Spikes Klefki is also generally good at taking advantage of teams relying on it. Moreover, Crobat's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots leaves it vulnerable to Knock Off from Pokemon it checks like Heracross and Golisopod. Nasty Plot Crobat's sweeps can often fall short due to its lack of power. The likes of Metagross, Incineroar, and Registeel can take even boosted attacks and leave it damaged enough for revenge killers like opposing Crobat and Choice Scarf Flygon. Furthermore, Raikou, Xurkitree, and Nidoqueen are common offensive checks that can take a boosted attack and OHKO it.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Crobat can run slower, bulkier EV spreads with Toxic or Haze over U-turn on stall and semi-stall teams, which further helps against physical attackers like Heracross, Lucario, and Acrobatics Tornadus. 252 HP / 152 Def / 104 Spe with Jolly outpaces Tornadus and 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 Spe with Jolly outpaces Celebi.

Dragon Dance Tyrantrum and Aerodactyl use Crobat for easy setup.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou and Xurkitree can switch into pivot Crobat and scare it out, but they get worn quickly by Brave Bird and U-turn.

Choice Scarf Gardevoir outpaces and threatens to OHKO Crobat.</p> <p><strong>Other Poison-resistant Pokemon</strong>: Chandelure, Stone Edge Flygon, and Nidoqueen are good checks to Nasty Plot Crobat, though the former two dislike Sludge Bomb poison, and boosted Hurricane quickly beats them all.

Crobat is a great Defog user because it checks the Spikes users Roserade, Heracross, and Golisopod. Crobat can afford options over Defog if it's on a highly offensive team or the team is packing hazard removal elsewhere. Toxic cripples bulky switch-ins like Umbreon, Milotic, and Rhyperior. Sets with Toxic prefer Infiltrator to hit Suicune behind its Substitute. Taunt can prevent Stealth Rock from Crobat's switch-ins, setup from Pokemon like Dragon Dance Flygon and Nasty Plot Togekiss, and recovery from walls like Milotic and Jellicent. Super Fang is great for weakening Steel- and Rock-type switch-ins like Registeel, Steelix, and Rhyperior. Taunt can be run over U-turn alongside Super Fang or Toxic; this makes Crobat very effective at beating bulky Pokemon like Registeel, Milotic, and Umbreon. The given EV spread outpaces Noivern and grants bulk for checking Heracross and Golisopod.

If the team can cripple Grass-weak Pokemon via Knock Off or Toxic, Crobat can more afford the longevity of Roost, allowing it to accrue multiple boosts in the face of Registeel and Umbreon. Roost is also more justifiable alongside Hurricane, since boosted Hurricane hits Giga Drain targets like Jellicent, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad hard. Inner Focus prevents Choice Scarf Togekiss's Air Slash flinching.</p> <p>Xurkitree, Rotom-C, and Heliolisk can pivot on Grass-types like Roserade and Dhelmise for Crobat to set up Nasty Plot on. Ground-types like Nidoqueen, Steelix, and Flygon cover Crobat's Electric weakness. Grass-types and specially defensive Pokemon like Celebi, Roserade, and Registeel can also help check Electric-types. Nasty Plot Crobat weakening Steel-types like Registeel helps Pokemon like Mimikyu, Goodra, and Sharpedo, and they can weaken Steel-types themselves for Crobat. Dark- and Steel-types like Incineroar, Cosmic Power Metagross, and Escavalier check Reuniclus and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, though nearly any Steel-type is a good Gardevoir check. Crobat can double up with other Flying-types like Togekiss, Tornadus, and Sigilyph to exploit shared checks like Registeel, Raikou, and Rhyperior. Incineroar and Salazzle can cripple Water- and Rock-types with Knock Off or Toxic for non-Giga Drain Crobat, and Incineroar can outright take advantage of Jellicent. Toxic Rhyperior and Metagross are also good for crippling Water-types.</p>"

This, coupled with its ability to consistently pivot with Teleport, makes it a solid choice on offense teams. Still, even with maximum investment, Xatu's bulk is less than stellar. This can make it inconsistent against some hazard setters; for example, Metagross can 2HKO Xatu with a Meteor Mash Attack boost. Thus, Xatu may need to stay near full health to effectively perform its role. It can be risky to use Teleport, and Xatu depends on good predictions to keep hazards off the field. Xatu is also unable to beat certain setters like Stakataka, Golisopod, and Rhyperior, which considerably reduces its effectiveness.</p>",

Heavy-Duty Boots preserves Xatu's pivoting abilities in matchups where it fails to prevent Stealth Rock from going up, but losing Rocky Helmet can be detrimental against Stealth Rock setters like Metagross and Registeel. Thunder Wave can support slower wallbreakers such as Pangoro. Air Slash hits Pangoro, Roserade, and Golisopod in one attack, although it's weak. Calm Mind over Teleport could transform Xatu into a threat against slower teams, though losing Teleport is certainly not ideal.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Specific Entry Hazard Setters</strong>: Golisopod can remove Rocky Helmet with Knock Off and click Liquidation until it gets a Defense drop, forcing Xatu out and letting it set Spikes. Rhyperior will always beat non-Grass Knot Xatu. A healthy Stakataka will beat Xatu one-on-one. Roserade can't stay in on Future Sight but takes advantage of Xatu's weak Special Defense with Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types like Incineroar and Pangoro can either set up on Xatu or force it out to threaten potential switch-ins, and they can easily put a stop to Future Sight.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Raikou and Xurkitree can easily switch into Xatu and maintain momentum with Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: As Xatu finds itself on mostly offense teams, Ghost-types like Golurk, Dhelmise, and Decidueye can pressure it with Poltergeist or force a sack.

The combination of Heat Wave and Rocky Helmet allows Xatu to consistently block Steel-types such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Steelix from setting entry hazards. 16 Speed EVs let it outspeed Golurk, and investment in Defense allows Xatu to outlast Metagross with Rocky Helmet. Not running an item is feasible to avoid Poltergeist from Ghost-type wallbreakers like Golurk and Dhelmise, as well as reducing Knock Off damage from Pokemon like Golisopod, at the cost of effectiveness against most hazard setters. 60 Special Attack EVs allow Xatu to OHKO Nidoqueen with Future Sight after Stealth Rock but weakens the Metagross matchup.</p> <p>Xatu can weaken passive bulky Pokemon like Registeel by stalling them out, making sweepers like Sharpedo and Mimikyu significantly more reliable. Similarly, Pokemon with a vulnerability to Steel-types, such as Roserade and Gardevoir, can capitalize on this. These Pokemon can also take advantage of Teleport to safely set up. Entry hazard-weak Pokemon such as Tornadus and weather sweepers can forgo running Heavy-Duty Boots with Xatu, opening up teambuilding possibilities with other sets. Other pivots such as Flygon, Incineroar, Rotom-C, and Xurkitree can form a VoltTurn core with Xatu. Extra hazard removal from Flygon and Starmie can mitigate Xatu's inability to prevent entry hazards from certain setters. Volt Switch users like Raikou and Cobalion can capitalize on Xatu's weak Special Defense and Electric weakness, making Ground-types like Nidoqueen and Flygon great partners. They can also take advantage of any Rock-types Xatu forces in with Teleport. Wallbreakers like Bewear appreciate Teleport and can use it to capitalize on a setup opportunity.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Politoed enables a powerful but matchup-reliant archetype in rain due to being the only Drizzle Pokemon in the tier. However, outside of setting rain, Politoed is a generally underwhelming Pokemon that can’t provide much help to rain teams itself and often becomes a momentum sink due to its passiveness. Encore allows it to deal with bulkier threats that would wall it otherwise and discourage Pokemon from setting up on it. Toxic can break down walls in tandem with Encore, particularly bulky Water-types that pose a threat to rain teams like Milotic. Hypnosis trades some effectiveness against passive builds for the potential to shut down common roadblocks to rain teams like Gastrodon and Assault Vest Reuniclus, and maintain utility against more offensive teams looking to take advantage of Politoed’s passivity. Ice Beam chips Grass-types like Celebi, 3HKOes Dragalge, and OHKOes Noivern with the Special Attack investment. Perish Song forces bulky setup sweepers out, allowing Politoed to check Pokemon like Suicune, Snorlax, and Reuniclus. Finally, Rest allows Politoed to continue setting rain when severely weakened and in long matches against passive teams. Non-Ice Beam variants can invest the 76 Special Attack EVs into Defense, as they do nothing significant with Scald. 56 Speed EVs let Politoed outrun Alolan Marowak, but 92 Speed EVs can be ran for Milotic, which Encore + Toxic variants can beat.</p> <p>Politoed’s only niche is setting rain, so Pokemon that take advantage of it are necessary. Swift Swim Pokemon like Kingdra, Ludicolo, and Kabutops can offensively pressure the opponent and sweep once they are weakened. Electric-types of your own like Raikou and Heliolisk are able to run Thunder and Weather Ball as coverage and check Electric- or Water-types. Tornadus also enjoys fully accurate Hurricane and Weather Ball coverage. Toxicroak appreciates the Dry Skin recovery and can switch into Milotic with impunity. Steel-types like Metagross and Steelix can provide good defensive utility for rain teams and appreciate Fire-type moves being weakened under rain. Finally, entry hazard setters such as Klefki and Roserade can help pressure bulkier cores that threaten rain such as Suicune + Assault Vest Reuniclus, as well as synergizing with the surprising amount of switches Politoed can force from defensive Pokemon.</p>"

Since it has Unaware, it can afford to be passive and purely focus on not getting KOed, which is different from the playstyles of other bulky Water-types like Gastrodon and Milotic. Toxic hits Flying-types and other walls such as Togekiss or Porygon2, ensuring they do not take advantage of Quagisre's lack of offensive presence. Scald is used to threaten Pokemon such as Steelix and Bronzong and attempt to burn physical attackers such as Mimikyu, Flygon, and Cloyster. Despite being immune to stat changes itself, Quagsire can run Haze in order to beat Stored Power Reuniclus, which can otherwise set up and beat Quagsire one-on-one. Ice Beam can also be run in order to give Grass-types such as Celebi and Roserade a harder time switching in. Curse can be used to turn Quagsire into a late-game sweeper; however, it often struggles due to how vulnerable it is to special attacks. Heavy-Duty Boots are used to ensure entry hazards do not cripple it, which is often crucial since Quagsire's natural bulk isn't good enough to take multiple hits at lower percents. Running Haze over Toxic can also be effective, as Toxic isn't often necessary against what Quagsire checks.</p> <p>Quagsire is primarily used on stall teams because it allows them to not be overwhelmed by setup sweepers. Umbreon is a great partner for Quagsire, as it can tank the special hits that it can't, such as Toxtricity's Boomburst or Chandelure's Shadow Ball. Umbreon also often runs Heal Bell, which helps Quagsire clear any status it might receive from the likes of Metagross, Bronzong, or Raikou. Due to Quagsire's middling bulk, it often cannot deal with stronger wallbreakers of the tier such as Bewear and Guts Heracross; Galarian Weezing is a great choice of teammate, as it can wall these threats. Lucario and Pangoro can both 2HKO Quagsire with Close Combat, so having a Flying-type such as Crobat, Talonflame, or Xatu on the team to eliminate this weakness is helpful. Flying-types also help Quagsire by dealing with Grass-types such as Roserade and Celebi. Registeel also makes for a great partner as it too can wall the aforementioned Grass-types.</p>"

However, Umbreon's weaknesses to Fighting and Fairy leave it vulnerable to common threats such as Lucario, Heracross, and Gardevoir.

However, many teams prefer the specially defensive variant, since it counters more important Pokemon. 180 EVs can be invested into Speed to outspeed Adamant Golurk. However, this makes Umbreon worse against special attackers such Nidoqueen and Chandelure. Inner Focus with Toxic is an option to better deal with Togekiss, but it has less use outside of this matchup.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon like Bewear and Pangoro can take huge advantage of Umbreon, but they dislike Toxic. Heracross, Lucario, and Toxicroak take good damage from Foul Play but pressure Umbreon with their Fighting-type moves.

Klefki has nothing to fear from Umbreon, can set up Spikes freely, and pressures it with Toxic. Mimikyu can safely set up once due to Disguise and OHKO Umbreon with a boosted Play Rough. Although Gardevoir takes good damage from Foul Play, it 2HKOes Umbreon with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Calm Mind Suicune, Reuniclus, and Curse Snorlax easily use Umbreon as setup fodder, since they take little from Foul Play and negate Toxic through Magic Guard, Rest, or Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Strong physical attackers such as Choice Band Flygon and Metagross overwhelm or break through Umbreon, but most of them take a lot from Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Trick</strong>: Taunt and Trick users such as Noivern, Crobat, Gardevoir, and Chandelure restrict Umbreon to one move, allowing them to better deal with it.</p> <p><strong>Toxic-immune Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon that are immune to Toxic such as Registeel, Nidoqueen, and Steelix cripple Umbreon with their own Toxic and cannot be statused in return.</p>",

Raikou and Xurkitree are great to bring Heracross into Grass-types safely, and they additionally handle the Flying-types that give Heracross trouble. Spinners such as Starmie and Dhelmise work well for entry hazard removal, since Heracross greatly appreciates its own team's hazards staying up. Pokemon that can switch into faster Choice Scarf users like Flygon, such as Milotic and Gastrodon, are good partners. Hazard setters that can keep them up against Flying-types such as Diancie, Stakataka, and Metagross support Heracross well.</p>"

Hurricane is used so that Kingdra can beat Grass-type Pokemon like Roserade without Draco Meteor Special Attack drops. Hydro Pump's main use over the more accurate Surf is to 2HKO even dedicated special walls like Registeel, Umbreon, and Assault Vest Reuniclus in rain; Surf is already powerful enough to OHKO most offensive Pokemon it hits neutrally. Flip Turn can be used instead to grab momentum off of Kingdra's checks and ease prediction for Choice Specs sets. Life Orb is the preferred item because it boosts power without locking Kingdra into one move; however, Choice Specs gives Kingdra the best chance to 2HKO bulky Water-types like Suicune and Milotic with Draco Meteor while also avoiding Life Orb's chip damage. Kingdra can opt for a Timid nature in order to outpace Choice Specs Gardevoir, which copies its Swift Swim with Trace, and improve its matchups against the likes of Togekiss and Chandelure out of rain.</p> <p>Kingdra must always be supported by Drizzle from Politoed to activate Swift Swim. Without Drizzle support, Kingdra is outclassed by other offensive Water-type Pokemon like Starmie. Kingdra works best when used alongside other rain sweepers. Kabutops, Omastar, and Ludicolo can weaken bulky Water-type Pokemon like Milotic and Suicune. Toxicroak walls the aforementioned bulky Water-types and can also switch into First Impression attempts from Golisopod, making it an especially good Kingdra partner.

Ice Beam is generally the preferred attacking move because it OHKOes Noivern and Flygon, while also 2HKOing Roserade and Golurk. Tri Attack is a decent alternative that does more to the likes of Xurkitree, Raikou, and Starmie. Toxic cripples the likes of Milotic, Rhyperior, and Raikou, mitigating their long-term impact against Porygon2's teammates. Foul Play is an attacking option to hit Metagross and Alolan Marowak, while also letting Porygon2 check Polteageist much easier. A specially defensive spread allows Eviolite Porygon2 to blanket check many dangerous special attackers, such as Xurkitree, Toxtricity, and Roserade. Some Defense investment can be used to make Porygon2 a better pivot into the likes of Dhelmise and Flygon should its team need it.

Pokemon such as Dhelmise and Starmie can remove entry hazards, which otherwise hamper Porygon2's ability to pivot and forces it to use Recover more often. A pivoting core can also be powerful, especially with the likes of Flygon, Incineroar, and Raikou, as it can keep Porygon2 in favorable situations. Powerful Fighting-types such as Heracross, Pangoro, and Lucario can take advantage of Porygon2's inability to generally threaten them. The aforementioned Togekiss and Galarian Weezing fare well against Heracross and Pangoro, while Jellicent can handle Lucario. In turn, Porygon2 can easily handle most Toxtricity variants and other Electric types.

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Raikou is a solid offensive pivot thanks to its high Speed outrunning other threats like Heracross and Tornadus, which is its main advantage over fellow Electric-types like Xurkitree and Toxtricity. Heavy-Duty Boots makes it difficult to wear down passively, letting it use Volt Switch with great freedom, and its useful coverage across Shadow Ball, Extrasensory, and Scald keeps many Pokemon from confidently switching into it. It can put that coverage to even greater use with its Calm Mind wallbreaking set. Its biggest problem is its glaring inability to hit Gastrodon and Flygon very hard; the best it can do is use Toxic or try to burn Flygon with Scald, so they hold it off well early-game. Its attacks are generally a bit weak, so it often relies on teammates to actually break through bulky Pokemon like Registeel and Assault Vest Reuniclus, and its defensive typing isn't good for much beyond switching into Togekiss and Xurkitree; this means it's hesitant to take strong attacks. The Calm Mind set sacrifices Volt Switch, making it a worse team player and thus harder to fit. Stronger Electric-types like Xurkitree and Toxtricity are much better than pivot Raikou at breaking through cores by themselves, while others like Heliolisk and Rotom-Mow offer greater defensive utility due to their typings and abilities.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind punishes passive defensive cores but lacks room for coverage. Aura Sphere on pivot Raikou puts the most pressure on Steel-types like Stakataka and Registeel; their low Speed and Volt Switch vulnerability make this less important on average. Weather Ball makes Raikou a much bigger threat on weather teams; hail gives it the excellent combination of Electric and Ice, rain gives it stronger Water-type coverage, and sun lets it hit Steel- and Grass-types with a single move.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Certain Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types that aren't weak to Scald are the safest early-game switch-ins to Raikou. Gastrodon has Recover and Storm Drain, making it near insurmountable for Raikou even when badly poisoned. Quagsire also has Recover while handling coverage moves well, and Choice Scarf Flygon can immediately force Raikou out but fears Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon with a lot of special bulk, including Assault Vest Reuniclus, Registeel, Snorlax, and Umbreon, can take Raikou's attacks for a long time and immediately hinder it in return with Toxic or a strong attack. Pivot Raikou can just use Volt Switch the turn after they switch in, though.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: If Raikou lacks Extrasensory, Roserade, and Vileplume are good switch-ins to it, and if it lacks Shadow Ball, Celebi, Dhelmise, and Decidueye handle its attacks well. Decidueye and Dhelmise want to avoid Scald burns, however.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Raikou's average bulk and lack of resistances make it easy for most faster Pokemon to take out once weakened. Physical Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Heracross deal massive damage. Noivern and Salazzle are faster but struggle against Calm Mind boosts. Golisopod's First Impression also does the trick.</p>",

Furthermore, Entei can act as a revenge killer with Extreme Speed, letting it pick off many dangerous sweepers like Cloyster, Flygon, and Sharpedo. Entei also has a great Speed tier for a wallbreaker and outspeeds key offensive threats such as Mimikyu, Obstagoon, and Xurkitree. The team compression provided by being both a wallbreaker and revenge killer, as well as sporting great natural bulk and a key Speed tier, makes it particularly sought after on sun teams. Under sun, Entei's counterplay dwindles, as once hard stops like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Snorlax have a high chance of getting 2HKOed by sun-boosted Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock and burn. However, Entei's Stealth Rock weakness severely limits it, especially on sun teams, which generally lacks thorough entry hazard removal. Outside of sun teams, Entei faces far harsher competition from other wallbreakers, especially Darmanitan, which can afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots, is about as strong as Choice Band Entei, and can keep up momentum with U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots may seem tempting, but the loss of power compared to Choice Band is rarely worth it and makes it even harder to justify using Entei over Darmanitan. Similar to Suicune, Entei can attempt to run a Calm Mind + Substitute set, but such a set can't touch Chandelure, has few switch-in opportunities, retains Entei's Stealth Rock weakness, and still struggles with Water-types, especially Haze Milotic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Quagsire can switch into any attack and heal off burn damage with Recover; however, the latter two need to watch out if they're burned, as they have a high chance of getting 2HKOed by sun-boosted Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock. Suicune can also take any hit from Entei, but it doesn't enjoy a potential burn.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: In general, Entei is at the full mercy of entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock and Spikes, as it cannot afford to use Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Entei will rarely be at full health, which leaves it vulnerable to be revenge killed by faster threats like Noivern, Starmie, and Raikou.</p> <p><strong>Snorlax</strong>: While not the most common, Snorlax completely counters Entei thanks to Thick Fat and Rest.

Flare Blitz is much stronger than Sacred Fire and is a must on sun teams, as it has a good chance to 2HKO a burned Gastrodon or Quagsire after Stealth Rock in the sun. On non-sun teams, Iron Head is a viable option to OHKO Diancie; while it despises a burn from Sacred Fire, Diancie can easily switch into Entei and set Stealth Rock. Toxic is also an option to cripple bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Suicune, but with Sacred Fire's 50% burn rate, it can become useless if not played carefully. Inner Focus blocks Intimidate from Incineroar, so it can't switch into Entei's Fire-type attacks in sun.</p> <p>The playstyle that takes full advantage of Entei's strengths and plays to its full potential are sun teams. Torkoal sets Stealth Rock, sun with Drought, and can remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. On sun teams, Entei can either work as the team's sole wallbreaker or be run alongside others like Charizard and Heliolisk and act primarily as a revenge killer. Entei lures bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Milotic and forces them to use Recover, which can be exploited by Shiftry to get an opportunity to use Growth or a huge hit off. Choice Scarf Gardevoir provides Healing Wish support to heal up Entei after taking many rounds of Stealth Rock damage or attacks from the likes of Togekiss, Mimikyu, and Crobat. On non-sun teams, Entei needs more support to break past bulky Water-types. Assault Vest Reuniclus's Future Sight and lures to Water-types like mixed Metagross and offensive Starmie are effective ways of weakening or getting rid of Gastrodon and Milotic. Pokemon such as Raikou, Flygon, and Stakataka can cripple Gastrodon, Suicune, and Quagsire with Toxic, which greatly aids Entei. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Crobat, Flygon, and Starmie give Entei as many opportunities to wallbreak as possible.

Calm Mind makes it very hard for special attackers to break Suicune's Substitute and makes Scald much harder to switch into. Substitute provides Suicune with a way to protect itself from status effects, which will cripple sets lacking Rest, and is especially effective for PP stalling Pokemon unable to break its substitute in one hit. Note that Suicune must still be cautious not to switch into status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave from the likes of Registeel, Togekiss, and Klefki. Protect enables Suicune to scout Choice item users, stall out low PP moves, and gain additional Leftovers recovery. Ice Beam can be used to hit the likes of Zarude and Seismitoad after boosting, which are otherwise major threats. Roar is another option that allows Suicune to phaze out other setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. The EV spread allows Suicune to outpace base 80 Speed Pokemon like Chandelure and Togekiss, while giving it an 81% chance that Seismitoad's Earthquake will not break its Substitute. An alternative spread with maximum Speed will allow Suicune to Speed tie with Heracross, but lowers its chances of its Substitute surviving Seismitoad's Earthquake to about 56%. This set lacks recovery other than Leftovers, so Suicune must be careful not to take Knock Off from Pokemon like Incineroar and Obstagoon without a Substitute up. Suicune must also be careful not to get hit by Trick from the likes of Darmanitan and Gardevoir, as it completely cripples this set.</p> <p>Suicune's natural bulk and typing make it a great choice for teams looking to check threats like Darmanitan, Alolan Marowak, and Metagross. Suicune's best check is Zarude, which can use Jungle Healing to remove any Scald burns and threaten Suicune with Power Whip. Therefore, it pairs well with Zarude checks like Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, and Togekiss. Cobalion has the added bonus of being an excellent Knock Off absorber thanks to Justified, while Galarian Weezing and Togekiss check other threats to Suicune like certain Guts Fighting-types such as Machamp and Heracross. The aforementioned Guts users, along with Obstagoon, pose a notable threat to Suicune because they are powerful enough to threaten Suicune and unafraid of burns from Scald. Sylveon or Togekiss notably can provide Heal Bell support to remedy this set's weakness to status effects. Suicune is also threatened by Electric-types like Xurkitree, Toxtricity, and Raikou, so it should be used alongside Electric-type checks such as Roserade, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Zarude, and Vileplume. Finally, Suicune lacking Roar is unable to beat certain Calm Mind sweepers with Psyshock like Reuniclus and Sigilyph, so it is wise to pair it with checks to them like Obstagoon and Chandelure.</p>"

This set runs enough Speed EVs to outpace Adamant Golurk and Jolly Alolan Marowak, then invests the rest in Defense and HP to be as hard to break through as possible. This, along with reliable recovery in Rest, makes it a much better answer to the likes of Darmanitan, Sharpedo, Cobalion, and Stakataka.</p> <p>Rest renders this set much less vulnerable to status effects and Knock Off, but it still has one major nemesis in the meta: Zarude. Zarude can use Jungle Healing to easily remove Scald burns, and this set lacks the safety net of Substitute to allow moves like Ice Beam to be effective. Checks to Zarude include Pokemon like Cobalion, Incineroar, Crobat, Noivern, and Togekiss. This set has difficulty setting up Calm Mind against offensive Electric-types like Xurkitree, Raikou, Heliolisk, and Toxtricity, so checks like Roserade, Zarude, Celebi, and Porgyon2 work well with it. Heliolisk has the added danger of Dry Skin causing Water-type moves to heal it, so Suicune must be played particularly carefully against it.

Especially notable is Celebi's U-turn weakness; despite being a check to Raikou and Xurkitree, Celebi can simply get hit by Volt Switch and then immediately get forced out by U-turn from Pokemon such as Crobat and Flygon.

Celebi can run an effective utility set of Grass Knot, Thunder Wave, Recover, and U-turn. Thunder Wave dissuades faster switch-ins like Crobat, while U-turn can take advantage of slower bulky switch-ins for powerful wallbreakers such as Pangoro.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Crobat, Noivern, and Togekiss threaten Celebi for massive damage.

Ludicolo is also difficult to fit on many rain teams, as they prefer other Swift Swim sweepers like Kingdra and Kabutops or teammates such as Tornadus and Noivern that can handle problematic foes like Toxicroak and bulky Grass-types.</p>",

Leaf Storm allows Ludicolo to OHKO Suicune and potentially OHKO Milotic.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Porygon2 and Umbreon deal with Ludicolo by stalling out rain turns and Hydro Pump PP with recovery moves or, in Umbreon's case, the combination of Wish and Protect. Registeel and Bronzong can be 2HKOed by Weather Ball under rain after some chip damage, but they can cripple Ludicolo with Toxic. Once rain is over, these Pokemon deal with Ludicolo more easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority Users</strong>: Trace Gardevoir and Choice Scarf Flygon outspeed and revenge kill Ludicolo, even in rain. Golisopod OHKOes Ludicolo immediately with First Impression, while other priority users such as Lucario and Entei revenge kill Ludicolo once it is weakened enough. Klefki can be OHKOed by Ludicolo's Weather Ball under rain after some chip damage; however, it can keep Ludicolo in check with Prankster Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Toxicroak</strong>: Toxicroak is a huge threat to rain teams due to its typing, Dry Skin, and Sucker Punch. It is also a threat to Ludicolo, since it takes both of Ludicolo's STAB moves easily and can either OHKO it with Gunk Shot or revenge kill with Sucker Punch. However, Toxicroak is quite frail and can be 2HKOed by Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Opposing weather setters can be extremely annoying for Ludicolo, since it is dependent on rain. Abomasnow, Aurorus, and Vanilluxe replace the rain with hail, but don't comfortably switch into Weather Ball or Hydro Pump.</p>",

Hydro Pump, on the other hand, lets Ludicolo better deal with specially defensive Pokemon such as Umbreon and Porygon2 and also gives it a strong Water-type STAB move outside of rain. Giga Drain deals with bulky Water-types and negates passive damage like recoil from Life Orb. Ice Beam hits Grass- and Dragon-types such as Celebi, Roserade, and Noivern super effectively, which resist both of its STAB moves. Protect avoids First Impression from Golisopod, which is a common threat to rain teams, and also helps to scout for Choice-locked Pokemon such as Gardevoir. 196 Speed EVs with a Timid nature can be used to allow Ludicolo to be faster than Choice Scarf Flygon alongside 60 HP EVs to take opposing attacks a little better.</p> <p>Since Ludicolo's only niche is on rain teams, Politoed is a necessary teammate to set rain. Swift Swim sweepers like Kingdra and Kabutops pile on more rain-boosted offense and appreciate Ludicolo's ability to take on bulky Water-types like Gastrodon and Milotic. Flying-types like Tornadus and Noivern help rain teams deal with Toxicroak and bulky Grass-types like Celebi and Dhelmise. Klefki can act as a secondary rain setter, set Spikes, and check Gardevoir.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>Gardevoir's main niche comes from its useful utility moves in Trick and Healing Wish, which give it a notable advantage over other Choice Scarf users in the tier like Heracross, Xurkitree, and Flygon. Alternatively, Choice Specs lets it break past walls like Registeel and Assault Vest Reuniclus. However, Gardevoir is rather slow for a Choice Scarf user, so it can't revenge kill most other Choice Scarf users in the tier such as Heracross, which can easily pick it off with minimal chip damage. It struggles to directly switch into attacks, especially since its Speed can force it to take another attack before moving. Gardevoir faces competition from other Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Heracross, and Togekiss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Scarf Gardevoir can run Memento to let offensive teammates such as Barbaracle and Cloyster set up on offensive teams. Teleport is good when paired with a wallbreaker that threatens Steel-types, as Gardevoir has a tendency to lure them in.

Although Trick allows Gardevoir to cripple defensive Steel-types that resist its STAB moves, such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Stakataka, Mystical Fire directly and nicely damages Metagross, Steelix, and Escavalier instead. Healing Wish can support strong, frail wallbreakers like Sharpedo or defensive teammates that lack a consistent form of recovery such as Registeel or Guzzlord. Trace allows Gardevoir to copy useful abilities such as Regenerator from Reuniclus, Sheer Force from Nidoqueen, Beast Boost from Stakataka and Xurkitree, Swift Swim and other-weather variants, and Levitate from Flygon, allowing Gardevoir to check it consistently.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Gardevoir is a very good partner for Heracross, Goodra, and Sharpedo, as they are all powerful wallbreakers that get worn down by chip damage, so they appreciate Healing Wish support. These wallbreakers all threaten the Steel-types that prevent Gardevoir from cleaning late-game, while Gardevoir can revenge kill threats to them such as Noivern, Flygon, and weakened Raikou. Knock Off support is essential to remove items like Assault Vest from Reuniclus, Heavy-Duty Boots from Umbreon and Incineroar, and Eviolite from Porygon2, allowing Gardevoir to break through them with Spikes support from Golisopod and Heracross. Pivots such as Xurkitree, Incineroar, and Flygon can help Gardevoir get into battle safely due to its poor bulk.

Sharpedo can run either a specially-based mixed or physical set, which makes counterplay much more difficult. However, Sharpedo has awful defensive stats and bad defensive typing, meaning it depends heavily on team support and KOing foes in one hit to avoid being defeated in return. Even though many checks are dependent on its set, both sets still struggle against bulky Water-types, various offensive threats, and strong priority users.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flip Turn alongside Choice Band or Heavy-Duty Boots instead of Life Orb turns Sharpedo into an offensive pivot. However, Sharpedo is a poor pivot due to its bad defensive stats and missing Life Orb and a coverage move or Protect limits Sharpedo severely; Flip Turn also does very little damage to most of its checks, so it is better to use Sharpedo's teammates to weaken them. Destiny Bond is an option to remove an opposing Pokemon, but Sharpedo often has no space to run this move and it is also not a reliable strategy. Psychic Fangs over Close Combat is an option on the physical set to better deal with Toxicroak, Vileplume, and Galarian Weezing; however, without Close Combat, Sharpedo has a harder time breaking through bulky Pokemon such as Umbreon, Porygon2, and Registeel. Ice Beam better deals with Togekiss and Noivern, but it has less use outside of these matchups and makes Sharpedo helpless against special walls such as Porygon2, Umbreon, and Registeel.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Suicune check both Sharpedo variants well and wear it down with their STAB moves quickly due to its bad defensive stats. However, Sharpedo has a chance to break through these Pokemon with a lucky Defense drop from Crunch or flinch from Dark Pulse. Suicune only has Rest for recovery, making it less reliable.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Strong priority users such as Lucario and Entei easily revenge kill Sharpedo due to its bad defensive stats. Special Toxicroak can also revenge kill Sharpedo with Vaccum Wave; however, this move is not very common at all. Golisopod and Flygon fail in this role, since Sharpedo can always block their First Impressions with Protect.</p> <p><strong>Various Offensive Threats</strong>: Toxicroak is a good offensive check to Sharpedo, since it is immune to Sharpedo's Water-type moves, not 2HKOed by its other two moves, and able to OHKO Sharpedo in return. As long as Mimikyu's Disguise is intact, it can always prevent a sweep from Sharpedo. Fast Choice Scarf users such as Flygon  can still revenge kill a +1 Sharpedo. However, unless Sharpedo just used Protect, it can easily use Protect to be faster than them next turn. Even though Golisopod fails to revenge kill Sharpedo with First Impression due to Protect, it can slightly check physical variants, since Sharpedo's Crunch does not put it into Emergency Exit range.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Umbreon, Porygon2, and Snorlax take Sharpedo's special moves very well but are 2HKOed by Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Physical walls such as Galarian Weezing and Vileplume check physical sets very well and KO them very easily.

A Choice Band set gives more immediate wallbreaking power, but it is easier to play around due to both of its STAB options having immunities. When it comes to support, Flygon is one of the best Defoggers in the tier thanks to its favorable matchup against most prevalent entry hazard setters like Rhyperior and Metagross. Choice Scarf Flygon can proudly claim to be the tier's fastest Choice Scarf user and is a reliable revenge killer. Flygon excels as a pivot and almost always carries U-turn if lacking Dragon Dance. However, its average base Attack stat leaves it struggling to break through common defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Milotic, even when boosted. Flygon's typing also gives it an exploitable weakness to Ice-type coverage.</p>",

Flygon has an expansive special movepool and a passable Special Attack stat, but both fully special and mixed sets tend to struggle to push past Togekiss. A bulky Dragon Dance set with Roost can take advantage of Flygon's great defensive typing to accumulate multiple boosts, but it struggles to break through bulky Water-types even more than fully offensive sets already do. Scale Shot is an alternative STAB option over Outrage that boosts Flygon's Speed, which is especially useful on Choice Band sets to both wallbreak and clean up late-game, but its inconsistent power makes it a less desirable choice.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Suicune are bulky enough to take even boosted attacks from Flygon and can KO back with Ice Beam, but they are 2HKOed by Choice Band Outrage on the switch and don't enjoy Toxic. Vaporeon has Heal Bell to heal off Toxic but struggles to reliably check Dragon Dance sets without Ice Beam. Unaware Quagsire hard counters Dragon Dance Flygon and can win against Choice Band sets with Curse.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Togekiss can comfortably take on defensive and Choice Scarf Flygon, especially if it's carrying Heal Bell, but it struggles greatly with Dragon Dance and Choice Band sets. Rarer bulky Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Levitate Galarian Weezing can take on any set with relative ease.

Togekiss can check Golisopod while softening up the opposing team for Flygon with its Nasty Plot set or provide valuable support with Heal Bell and Wish.

U-turn takes advantage of its switch-ins like Bronzong by providing free switches to teammates, and it's a risk-free option against teams with multiple Pokemon immune to its STAB moves.

This is thanks to a great combination of mixed defenses, good movepool, decent Speed as a defensive Pokemon, and an ability that actually gives it a benefit from being hit by status moves. Flip Turn even allows Milotic to be used on faster-paced teams, as it becomes a bulky Pokemon that can actually build or maintain momentum. Milotic's ability to check powerful threats like Flygon, Rhyperior, Noivern, and Metagross is very welcome on many teams. However, Milotic finds itself in a tier where Electric- and Grass-types, such as Raikou, Heliolisk, Celebi, and Roserade, are incredibly potent. While Milotic's ability to take hits of all kinds is relatively uncommon for defensive Pokemon, it does mean that extremely powerful wallbreakers, such as Lucario and Heracross, can use their powerful STAB moves to brute force their way past Milotic.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A Competitive set can be a Defog deterrent on Spikes stacking teams, as the common Defoggers do not generally fare well against a Milotic with boosted Ice Beam. Marvel Scale might make Flame Orb strategies look appealing, but the constant chip damage forces Milotic to use Recover way too often.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: RU is not short on Electric-types, and all of them can simply push past Milotic's defenses with powerful STAB moves. Raikou and Xurkitree aren't scared of Scald nor hindered too badly by a potential Toxic, as they rarely stay in long. Toxtricity is more vulnerable to Flip Turns as it switches in due to its much lower Speed, but similarly threatens out Milotic if it safely switches in and is immune to Toxic. Heliolisk is perhaps the worst enemy of Milotic thanks to Dry Skin even cutting off Milotic's ability to pivot out with Flip Turn as Heliolisk switches in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Celebi, Roserade, and Decidueye easily handle Milotic. Celebi's Natural Cure can make Toxic and Scald burns a non-factor for it, while Roserade's Natural Cure and secondary Poison typing work similarly. Both can utilize their powerful Grass-type STAB moves to eliminate Milotic. To make matters worse, Celebi can set up Nasty Plot, while Roserade can litter the field with Spikes to undermine Milotic's bulk later on.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers</strong>: Milotic's good but not spectacular mixed bulk means that very powerful wallbreakers can push past it.

Flip Turn generally is preferred to generate and maintain momentum as a defensive Pokemon, something that is generally uncommon. This is especially helpful on faster-paced teams that would rather have Milotic stay a step ahead of threats like Raikou and Roserade. Ice Beam prevents Grass-types from switching into Milotic as freely, discouraging Roserade from using Spikes freely. It also OHKOs Noivern and Flygon. Toxic is able to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Gastrodon and opposing Milotic, which can help Milotic's more offensive teammates push past them. It also is great for chipping away at common switch-ins like Raikou and Xurkitree. Haze is a great alternative that allows Milotic to stall out Substitute + Protect variants of Suicune lacking Toxic as well as prevent Calm Mind Reuniclus and Cosmic Power Metagross from taking advantage of Milotic's low damage output. On more defensive teams, Haze is a solid option over Flip Turn or Ice Beam, as these teams generally don't care as much about momentum as they do about covering as many offensive threats as possible. Milotic's 88 Speed EVs enable it to outpace Adamant Incineroar and Bewear.</p> <p>As Milotic is a defensive Pokemon that can maintain momentum, it can work on faster-paced teams that appreciate having it as a defensive backbone when they're forced out by certain Pokemon. Xurkitree and Raikou are powerful Electric-types that can threaten the majority of the tier and appreciate Milotic being able to bring them in safely. VoltTurn cores with the likes of Flygon, Incineroar, Xurkitree, and Heliolisk are also powerful on more offensive teams that aim to maintain momentum. Roserade is a great check to most Electric-types, can spare Milotic from Toxic from bulky Water-types, and litter the field with Spikes to amplify the effects of Flip Turn. In return, Milotic is able to check offensive Steel-types and multiple Fire-types. Registeel is able to set up Stealth Rock, check Gardevoir and most Electric- and Grass-types, and appreciates Milotic being able to switch into most Fire- and Ground-types looking to take on Registeel. Crobat and Togekiss are able to take on the likes of  Heracross and Pangoro for Milotic. Crobat can even handle Roserade and clear the field of entry hazards, which can force Milotic to use Recover more often that it would like.</p>"

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<p>Metagross is one of the best and most versatile Steel-types in RU thanks to its great all-around stats, good offensive coverage, key resistances, and valuable utility options. What's more, Metagross has the game-changing combination of Cosmic Power and Body Press, which makes it one of the toughest bulky setup sweepers to stop in its tracks. Metagross will shrug off most attacks after just a single Cosmic Power and hit even harder in return with Body Press. But, it's not without its faults, as its Steel and Fighting coverage and reliance on Rest for recovery leaves it with solid, common answers in Haze Milotic, Nasty Plot Crobat, Chandelure, and Jellicent. Metagross also makes for a reliable Stealth Rock setter. While it doesn't provide as much defensive utility as Registeel, Steelix, and Bronzong, Metagross doesn't let up on the offensive pressure, making it an excellent pick for more offensive teams. But, Metagross's lack of reliable recovery means its good bulk and resistances can only take it so far when it comes to taking hits.</p> <p>Its resistances and natural bulk let it serve as a powerful Choice Band user, and its Speed is just high enough to make it an effective Choice Scarf user on specific teams. Choice Scarf Metagross often struggles to make headway against bulkier teams directly but can cripple a crucial defensive wall by giving it Choice Scarf. Because of Metagross's lower Speed, all other Choice Scarf users can revenge kill it, but few of them KO it at full. Choice Band Metagross 2HKOes its usual switch-ins in bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Jellicent. But because most common defensive Pokemon are either immune or resistant to at least one of its moves, Metagross has to lock itself into the correct move on the right turn to effectively wallbreak, unlike other wallbreakers such as Lucario and Pangoro. Metagross's average Speed is often its downfall, because it leaves Metagross vulnerable to a myriad of offensive Pokemon, including faster wallbreakers like Nidoqueen, Heracross, and Chandelure, once it has picked up a KO.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Agility with Meteor Mash, Earthquake, Thunder Punch, and Weakness Policy, Lum Berry, or Shuca Berry can allow Metagross to sweep late-game. However, such a set can't effectively capitalize on its bulk and typing to generate pressure in early- or mid-game. Protect can scout for potential Choice-locked attackers like Flygon and stall for Toxic damage. A set with Grass Knot and Expert Belt can 2HKO Gastrodon and Seismitoad with 56 SpA EVs, even with a Special Attack dropping nature. Outside of Gastrodon, Seismitoad, and the occasional Quagsire, though, Grass Knot doesn't hit many other targets for notable damage. Metagross can take mixed sets to another level with Power Herb and Meteor Beam. Meteor Beam not only boosts its Special Attack but also lets it lure in and KO Golisopod with minimal prior damage. Such mixed sets typically run some combination of Meteor Mash, Psychic, Earthquake, and Grass Knot alongside Meteor Beam. Explosion is a viable option on offensive Stealth Rock and Choice Band sets, taking a huge chunk out of some foe while providing a safe switch in for a frail, offensive teammate once Metagross has no more use.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Outside of Choice Band-boosted Zen Headbutt, bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Suicune, and Gastrodon can handle any attack from Metagross and stay healthy to switch in multiple times. Gastrodon and Seismitoad can even retaliate with STAB Earth Power and Earthquake. Starmie is particularly annoying to Stealth Rock sets, because Natural Cure and Recover generally ensure it can spin on Metagross throughout any game. However, Metagross's Toxic and Earthquake can potentially force Starmie out, letting Stealth Rock stay up for a while longer. Jellicent stands out as one of the best counters to Cosmic Power Metagross thanks to its Ghost typing, and with the combination of Will-O-Wisp, Hex, and Taunt, Metagross has no hope to outlast it. Milotic can keep Cosmic Power sets at bay with Haze and will eventually force them to use Rest with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types and Dark-type coverage</strong>: Umbreon switches comfortably into Stealth Rock and Choice Scarf sets, but Choice Band Metagross cleanly 2HKOes it and Cosmic Power variants set up for free. Incineroar and Pangoro can take advantage of Stealth Rock Metagross and Cosmic Power sets that can't outspeed them. Both can even deal with Cosmic Power Metagross after setup, as they set up with Swords Dance after Metagross's Rest and KO before it wakes up. Some Choice Band Pangoro and the odd Grimmsnarl carry Darkest Lariat to ignore Cosmic Power Metagross's Defense boosts; however, neither can OHKO it and they need to watch out for Body Press and Meteor Mash, respectively. Similarly, Bewear can muscle past a set-up Metagross with Darkest Lariat, and thanks to Fluffy and a potential Chople Berry to boot, it doesn't fear Body Press as much. Many common Pokemon such as Golisopod, Heracross, and Tornadus carry Knock Off, and Metagross's item is priceless on every set.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Metagross's base 70 Speed leaves it outpaced by many offensive Pokemon, which not only force it out after it gets a KO but also give it a hard time switching in at all. Sharpedo, Chandelure, and Flygon are all faster Pokemon that can threaten Metagross with powerful or super effective STAB moves, although none can switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Dhelmise, Golurk, and Mimikyu offensively threaten any Metagross set but are particularly effective against Cosmic Power sets, as they're immune to Body Press. Chandelure also resists Meteor Mash and can even overwhelm Metagross after setup with Hex or Choice Specs; if all else fails, Trick can incapacitate Cosmic Power Metagross with a Choice item.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Steelix has to worry about Choice Band-boosted Earthquake some, but its high Defense lets it take a couple when necessary, and it easily handles Meteor Mash. Flygon and Nidoqueen are shakier answers because they cannot take hits as well, but they have much stronger STAB attacks to threaten Metagross with.</p>",
    "sets": {
      "Cosmic Power": {
        "description": "<p>Body Press takes full advantage of the Defense boost from Cosmic Power, with it 2HKOing or at least 3HKOing most of the metagame after a turn or two of setup. Meteor Mash covers most of the Pokemon resistant to Body Press, such as Togekiss, Crobat, and Celebi. It's also pivotal to countering Calm Mind Reuniclus, as after two Attack raises, it always 2HKOes Reuniclus after Leftovers. Rest is Metagross's only recovery move and removes burns, which weaken Body Press. Rest leaves Metagross vulnerable for two turns, but with enough Cosmic Power boosts, most non-setup Pokemon won't KO Metagross before it wakes up. Clear Body prevents defensive stat drops from Reuniclus's Focus Blast and Golisopod's Liquidation, as well as stops Incineroar's Intimidate from dropping its Attack. The EV spread ensures that Reuniclus's Focus Blast is a 4HKO, even with Metagross's Leftovers removed. An Impish nature alongside 64 Defense EVs guarantees the 2HKO on Flygon with Body Press after a Cosmic Power. The remaining Attack and Speed EVs are to 2HKO Nidoqueen after Stealth Rock and outrun Adamant maximum Speed Rhyperior. However, the EV spread for Cosmic Power Metagross is highly customizable. First, Metagross can either invest less or more into its special bulk. Simply maximum HP is enough to avoid the 3HKO from Reuniclus's Focus Blast after Leftovers; meanwhile, a Careful nature with either 156 or 200 Special Defense EVs ensures Life Orb Focus Blast and Shadow Ball from Reuniclus, respectively, never 3HKO. Similarly, 136 Speed EVs outrun Golurk, 160 EVs do the same for Adamant Pangoro, and 176 Speed EVs are for Adamant Incineroar and Bewear. Remember, all Cosmic Power Metagross spreads need a minimum of 40 Attack EVs to always 2HKO Reuniclus after Leftovers with +2 Meteor Mash.</p> <p>Metagross is one of the best Steel-types to pair with Stealth Rock setters such as Rhyperior, Nidoqueen, and Seismitoad, because they sorely miss the defensive utility of the Steel typing; meanwhile, Metagross doesn't want to set Stealth Rock itself. Rhyperior is better for Nasty Plot Togekiss, while Seismitoad can check Fire-, Water-, and Ground-types for Metagross. Further, all three can reliably force in bulky Water-types and badly poison them with Toxic. In particular, Haze Milotic and Jellicent are key targets as full-on counters to Metagross, since neither can hope to outlive Metagross after Toxic. Other Pokemon such as Crobat, Entei, and Salazzle are likewise effective at badly poisoning Milotic and Jellicent, and Grass-types such as Celebi, Roserade, and Rotom-C can use these Water-types to set up, lay Spikes, or gain momentum, respectively. Even after setup, Metagross doesn't immediately threaten Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Dhelmise. They typically force it out with their powerful STAB moves, which Dark-types such as Umbreon, Incineroar, and Guzzlord can cover. Umbreon can also wake Metagross up early with Heal Bell and keep it healthy with Wish, making Rest less of a liability. Incineroar, on the other hand, hard counters most Jellicent sets and overpowers Milotic with Swords Dance-boosted attacks, while Guzzlord can land Toxic on Milotic. Pokemon such as Crobat and Galarian Weezing are sufficient switch-ins to Dark- and Fighting-types such as Pangoro, Bewear, and Heracross that plague Metagross. However, the former isn't an issue for faster Metagross EV spreads. Depending on what spread it runs, Metagross is somewhere between a solid and a shaky catch-all answer to any Calm Mind Reuniclus set. Pairing frailer Metagross spreads with other checks to it, such as Dark-types like Pangoro and Incineroar, Nasty Plot Togekiss, Heracross, and Haze Milotic, will shield against any Reuniclus set, while very bulky Metagross counters it all by itself.</p>"

      "Stealth Rock": {
        "description": "<p>Metagross's good typing, high Attack stat, and solid natural bulk combine to make it a reliable Stealth Rock setter that doesn't give up any offensive pressure. Earthquake reliably 2HKOes the likes of Incineroar, Registeel, and Stakataka. Toxic is a fantastic last move that allows it to outlast its counters in Milotic, Gastrodon, and Umbreon. Bullet Punch can pick off weakened foes in a pinch but doesn't offer much else. While Leftovers is generally preferred, Shuca Berry allows Metagross to much more easily take on Flygon and Nidoqueen. Similarly, Colbur Berry is an option for Dark-types such as Pangoro and Sharpedo. It bears mentioning that Metagross makes great use of Custap Berry on fast-paced teams, as it often falls into Custap Berry range after surviving a powerful attack. Clear Body prevents Incineroar's Intimidate from lowering Metagross's Attack stat. The EVs are designed to outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Alolan Marowak, with enough Special Defense to avoid being 2HKOed by Togekiss's Flamethrower after Leftovers recovery. 136 Special Defense EVs can be used should your team be particularly weak to Nasty Plot Togekiss.</p> <p>Metagross isn't able to effectively threaten bulky Water-types beyond Toxic, so it's very helpful to have teammates that can pressure or remove them. Roserade handles these bulky Water-types as well as Raikou and Xurkitree while forming a powerful entry hazard setting duo with Metagross, as it too doesn't give up offensive pressure to set up Spikes. Choice Band Flygon, Raikou, and Xurkitree are powerful offensive threats that can force out bulky Water-types while bringing Metagross into better matchups through U-turn or Volt Switch. Crobat and Umbreon can provide either Defog or Wish support to let Metagross take hits more freely. Late-game cleaners and powerful wallbreakers that appreciate Metagross's ability to reliably spread Toxic are great options as well. Heracross and Flygon are useful Choice Scarf users that appreciate Metagross's ability to comfortably take on their Fairy- and Poison-type checks like Togekiss and Crobat. Nidoqueen and Chandelure are great wallbreakers that have a much easier time breaking through bulky Water-types once Metagross has been able to cripple them with Toxic.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Metagross is able to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame aside from Crobat and Aerodactyl, thus allowing it to be much more effective against faster-paced teams. Earthquake threatens Electric- and Fire-types such as Raikou, non-Choice Scarf Xurkitree, and Chandelure with a KO after minimal prior damage. Ice Punch crucially OHKOes Noivern and Flygon while being an accurate move to hit Celebi and Roserade with. Trick cripples walls such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Steelix, and can also limit the effectiveness of bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus and Suicune. Clear Body is crucial to prevent the Attack drop from Incineroar's Intimidate and Speed drop from Sticky Web.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Metagross should be played as more of a fast wallbreaker rather than a late-game cleaner like other Choice Scarf users, although the boosted Speed can allow it to clean up late-game if the opportunity arises. Roserade is a great teammate to check bulky Water-types and Choice Scarf Xurkitree—the former of which can prevent Metagross from reliably revenge killing and the latter revenge killing a slightly weakened Metagross—while also setting up Spikes to wear down the opposing team. Powerful wallbreakers such as Heracross, Pangoro, and Golurk can wear down or remove most defensive Pokemon and appreciate Metagross's increased Speed to handle naturally faster Pokemon that trouble them, such as Raikou and Noivern. Metagross is slower than other Choice Scarf users, so teammates that can reliably check them can be very helpful. Togekiss and Galarian Weezing can comfortably check Flygon. Milotic and Incineroar can help Metagross switch in with Flip Turn and U-turn, and Incineroar also wears down defensive cores with Knock Off and Toxic. Choice Scarf Metagross can outrun but not KO Togekiss from full health, thus failing to reliably revenge kill it. Other checks, such as Rhyperior, Raikou, and Xurkitree, can help Metagross to check it. Naturally fast Pokemon, such as Raikou and Noivern, can also provide extra insurance against Pokemon that Metagross generally doesn't appreciate, such as Starmie. Should Metagross successfully cripple a wall with Trick, setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Flygon and Swords Dance Mimikyu can capitalize and sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Metagross's incredible Attack stat and good natural bulk make it a powerful Choice Band user. Earthquake crushes Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Registeel, Chandelure, and Incineroar. Bullet Punch can pick off weakened offensive threats such as Heracross and Flygon while also having a chance to clean up weakened offensive teams. Zen Headbutt is the preferred last move to 2HKO all bulky Water-types hoping to take one of Metagross's other attacks. With Clear Body, Incineroar can't lower Metagross's Attack with Intimidate, which ensures it can only switch into Metagross's Meteor Mash once before it's 2HKOed. Adamant is the chosen nature for extra power. Jolly can be used specifically for Modest Nidoqueen, Jolly Incineroar, and Bewear.</p> <p>As Metagross is able to consistently break down opposing defensive cores, late-game cleaners are ideal choices to capitalize on this. Heracross and Flygon are effective Choice Scarf users that capitalize on Metagross breaking through bulky Water-types. Sharpedo and Dragon Dance Flygon are good sweeping options that also appreciate Metagross reliably pressuring or outright removing bulky Water-types from the game. Roserade provides Spikes support to aid in wearing down the likes of Steelix and Suicune while also checking Xurkitree and Raikou, which can revenge kill a slightly weakened Metagross once it has KOed some foe. Other physical attackers such as Lucario, Mimikyu, and Heracross can team up with Metagross to overwhelm physical walls. Wish support from Umbreon can be helpful, as Metagross's average Speed will often mean it has to take a hit in order to strike back with a KO. Diancie and Nidoqueen are great Stealth Rock users to pair with Metagross. Diancie can weaken or KO Steel-types that resist Metagross's powerful Meteor Mash, while Nidoqueen can deny Volt Switch attempts from Xurkitree and can pressure shared checks with Metagross like bulky Water-types and Bronzong. On its own, Choice Band Metagross isn't a reliable check to Togekiss, as at full health, Togekiss avoids the KO from Bullet Punch, while Metagross is outsped and OHKOed with +2 Flamethrower. Therefore, it's wise to pair it with other Togekiss answers such as Rhyperior, Xurkitree, and Diancie.</p>"

This is supplemented by its great natural bulk, which allows it to also take powerful neutral hits from the likes of Xurkitree and Toxtricity. Registeel also has Stealth Rock, and its ability to annoy common Defoggers like Togekiss and Crobat makes it a good user of the move. Registeel is unfortunately reliant on its Leftovers to stay healthy, which makes Knock Off incredibly threatening to it. Registeel is also rather passive compared to other Steel-types, as it is much more reliant on the likes of Toxic to make progress than its Steel-type competition of Steelix and Metagross. Annoying weaknesses to Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves leaves Registeel open to common Pokemon such as Flygon, Nidoqueen, and Heracross.</p>",

Heavy Slam is the preferred last move, as it gives Registeel a decently strong STAB move that hits threats such as Togekiss, Roserade, and Mimikyu.

Ground-types such as Golurk and Gastrodon appreciate Registeel switching into Celebi and Roserade, and they in return can prevent Registeel from getting worn down by Volt Switch from Raikou and Xurkitree. Knock Off absorbers are very important for the Leftovers-reliant Registeel. Options such as Galarian Weezing and Vileplume can switch into Golisopod and Heracross, while Gastrodon can deal with Incineroar.

        "description": "<p>Grass Knot's Base Power is consistently average to high in a tier filled with heavy Pokemon like Metagross, Steelix, and Suicune. However, Leaf Storm is better at threatening offensive Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Flygon, as well as Diancie, which takes little damage from Grass Knot due to its low weight. Synthesis allows Roserade to more reliably check Xurkitree and Rotom-C. On the other hand, Sleep Powder can net free turns for wallbreakers or setup sweepers and is great for putting Crobat out of commission. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps entry hazards from pressuring Roserade into repeatedly using Synthesis. However, on teams with sufficient entry hazard control, Black Sludge can be considered for extra recovery, which can help it take attacks more comfortably. This recovery can be further bolstered by running Giga Drain as the Grass-type STAB move.</p> <p>Steel-types like Cosmic Power Metagross and Lucario easily set up against Roserade. Incineroar, Pangoro, and Haze Milotic check Cosmic Power Metagross, faster revenge killers like Flygon, Noivern, and Crobat can check Lucario, and Chandelure and Jellicent check both Lucario and Metagross. Late-game sweepers such as Sharpedo, Mimikyu, and Dragon Dance Flygon appreciate Roserade's Spikes support weakening their checks. They also like Roserade's ability to check Water-types. To increase the effectiveness of Spikes and cripple the common Defog Crobat, Knock Off users such as Incineroar and Heracross are necessary to remove Heavy-Duty Boots. Rock- and Steel-types such as Rhyperior, Steelix, and Registeel check Flying-types, which force out Roserade and remove Spikes with Defog. Fire-types such as Chandelure and Entei are a huge nuisance to Roserade, so bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Gastrodon complement it nicely. Haze Milotic, Heracross, and Cosmic Power Metagross check Reuniclus for Roserade.</p>"

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon has won its title as a strong blanket check in RU by solidly handling Raikou, Steel-types, certain Water-types, and certain Fire-types like Entei and Salazzle as well as by checking various weaker attackers like Noivern in a pinch. Recover gives it great longevity, and Clear Smog can be used to hold off bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus, which has pretty few surefire answers. Its solid coverage in Earth Power alongside Ice Beam or Scald keeps it from a being particularly easy wall for offensive teams to switch into. However, many of the Pokemon it can switch into run Toxic or Knock Off, so it will often be under pressure from passive damage, especially when used as a blanket check on more offensive teams. These conditions will force Gastrodon to use Recover at predictable times, which will give up offensive momentum. It's forced out by the powerful and common Grass-types Celebi and Roserade, which can set up Nasty Plot or Spikes.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Using Sticky Hold as Gastrodon's ability is feasible if you don't expect to face Water-types, or if your team's counterplay to them is very solid overall; it makes Gastrodon a solid Knock Off absorber against weaker users like Incineroar and Salazzle. Curse lets Gastrodon beat Psyshock + Calm Mind Reuniclus and present a late-game threat, but it's vulnerable to faster special attackers, status ailments, and critical hits.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Grass is naturally the best way to immediately threaten a Water / Ground type like Gastrodon. Roserade, Celebi, and Dhelmise are RU's main Grass-types and make various forms of progress as Gastrodon is forced out, though none like switching into Ice Beam and some fear Scald burns. Grass-type coverage on other Pokemon, including Energy Ball Xurkitree and Chandelure, easily takes Gastrodon out.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage and Offensive Pressure</strong>: Gastrodon's solid typing and bulk make it difficult for most Pokemon to quickly and safely defeat, but many of the Pokemon it checks can hit it with Toxic on the switch like Metagross and Rhyperior. Toxic poison limits how long Gastrodon can stay in, forces it to spend more turns using Recover, and makes it easier for Pokemon to 2HKO with neutral attacks. Using Leftovers or losing Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off causes entry hazard damage to similarly accumulate.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon with Recovery</strong>: Toxic Gastrodon is setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus and most Suicune, while Clear Smog Gastrodon cannot pressure other walls like Milotic and Togekiss. Note that Substitute + Calm Mind Suicune can stall Gastrodon out either way.</p>",

Toxic keeps walls with reliable recovery from holding Gastrodon off indefinitely, while Clear Smog puts a stop to bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Reuniclus. Scald is largely unnecessary to Gastrodon's role, but threatening Pokemon like Pangoro with burns can always be useful. Heavy-Duty Boots is usually the better item so Gastrodon can ignore Spikes, but teams with solid entry hazard control can let it save more HP with Leftovers.</p> <p>Steel- and Poison-types like Metagross, Salazzle, and Toxtricity can punish Roserade. Heal Bell support makes Gastrodon much more resilient against Toxic users; Togekiss is the overall best Pokemon with the move, but Diancie, Sylveon, and Umbreon are also options. Gastrodon is a Ground-type that loses to certain moves from Electric-types Xurkitree and Toxtricity; more consistent switch-ins to Xurkitree include Roserade, Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Celebi, while Toxtricity's Boomburst can be handled with Steel-types like Stakataka and Metagross.

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzong's unique access to Levitate sets it apart from its Steel-type competition and lets it check many top-tier Pokemon such as Metagross, Nidoqueen, and Flygon. Furthermore, Levitate prevents Spikes from wearing Bronzong down, and it resists Stealth Rock, which lets it fit and perform without issue on teams lacking solid entry hazard control. Bronzong's main appeal is the role compression it provides, but simultaneously serving as a bulky Steel-type, checking Ground-types, and maintaining Stealth Rock can quickly overwhelm it. Bronzong can struggle to keep Stealth Rock up against common Defoggers and spinners like Dhelmise and Starmie; however, it works wonders against others like Flygon and Crobat. Bronzong's typing has many upsides, but it comes with nasty weaknesses to the common Dark- and Ghost-types and the ever-so-prevalent Knock Off. On top of that, Bronzong's low Attack stat means that it's complete setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus and it gives wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Golurk, and Bewear free switches in. If Bronzong's Ground immunity isn't needed, then it's generally outdone by other bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Steelix, which have far greater Special Defense, more offensive presence, and better defensive typing, respectively.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>A fully physically defensive EV spread could be used to handle Pokemon like Metagross and Flygon even better but makes the matchup against Gardevoir, Noivern, and Electric-types significantly worse. Protect is an option to scout Choice-locked foes like Golurk and gain extra Leftovers recovery, but it's hard to fit over Toxic and Earthquake. Hypnosis can be used over Toxic on more offensive teams to provide either safe switch-ins or setup opportunities to its offensive teammates. It also prevents Bronzong from being completely helpless against Calm Mind Reuniclus, but it's generally too inconsistent to be worth it. Iron Defense + Body Press gives Bronzong a more offensive presence and can potentially sweep ill-prepared teams, but such sets are hard-pressed to choose between Toxic to cripple Ghost-types and a Steel-type move for Nasty Plot Togekiss. Bronzong has another stellar ability in Heatproof, but the most common Fire-types—Incineroar and Chandelure—all carry moves that get by Heatproof, and Pokemon such as Choice Specs Gardevoir can run other coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Psychic is an option to hit Poison- and Fighting-types like Crobat, Vileplume, and Toxicroak, but Bronzong most often prefers its listed attacks. Trick alongside Choice Band could cripple bulky switch-ins such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, but Bronzong sorely misses Leftovers recovery.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Calm Mind Reuniclus</strong>: Bronzong is complete setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus, as its attacks will barely leave a scratch and Toxic doesn't deal damage due to Magic Guard.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Incineroar, Guzzlord, Pangoro, and Sharpedo all pose a huge threat to Bronzong. The former three can even switch in on Bronzong to varying degrees. Incineroar's Intimidate reduces even Earthquake to pitiful damage, Guzzlord takes little from any attacks, and Pangoro takes next to nothing from Heavy Slam. Umbreon completely walls Bronzong, can heal itself of Toxic with Heal Bell, and can pass a Wish to a more offensive teammate.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Golurk, and Decidueye all threaten Bronzong with their strong STAB moves. Golurk also takes nothing from Heavy Slam, so it can often hard switch into Bronzong. Chandelure needs to watch out for Earthquake, but besides that, it can switch into Bronzong. Dhelmise can switch in and further remove Bronzong's Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Polteageist and Doublade can set up against Bronzong without much trouble. Mimikyu can set up on Bronzong due to Disguise. However, none of them, besides Doublade, enjoy getting badly poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off And Corrosive Gas</strong>: Bronzong's only form of recovery is Leftovers, so losing it is detrimental to its longevity. Golisopod, Tornadus, and Assault Vest Reuniclus can all threaten to remove its Leftovers with Knock Off. Corrosive Gas Vileplume is especially troublesome because a good amount of teams with Bronzong lack good additional switch-ins to it, thus forcing Bronzong to accept losing its item.</p> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie poses a real nuisance to Bronzong, as it can switch into any of Bronzong's moves without much care and remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Moreover, Starmie doesn't mind Toxic thanks to Natural Cure, heals off any damage it takes with Recover, and can threaten Bronzong with a potential Scald burn or safely switch a wallbreaker onto the field with Teleport.</p>",

On more offensive teams, Gyro Ball can be used instead for greater power against these heavier foes, which such teams often lack sturdy switch-ins to and therefore cannot let in for free. Earthquake dents Steel- and Fire-types such as Metagross, Registeel, and Incineroar. Toxic punishes switch-ins like Golisopod, Milotic, and Rotom-C.

In return, they offensively check Togekiss, which otherwise can break through a weakened Bronzong with a boosted Flamethrower and/or Air Slash flinches. Galarian Weezing can switch into Knock Off from the likes of Golisopod and Pangoro for Bronzong.

Its boosted Close Combat OHKOes bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Milotic, and Seismitoad after Stealth Rock, while booosted Extreme Speed KOs most revenge killers such as Flygon, Crobat, and Noivern with minimal prior chip. Lucario's frailty makes it hard to set up, and even when it does, its sweep often ends to the combination of damage taken while setting up and Life Orb recoil. Some of Lucario's best checks like Crobat and Mimikyu are very common, limiting its sweeping capabilities.</p>",

Aerodactyl and Choice Scarf Metagross are especially effective revenge killers because they are resistant to Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Gastrodon, Seismitoad, Milotic, and Vaporeon, are deathly afraid of +2 Close Combat and struggle to switch directly into Lucario, but they can somewhat effectively thwart Lucario one-on-one; the former two threaten Lucario with their Ground-type moves, and the latter can threaten to burn it via Scald. Starmie can take on Lucario's STAB moves and boosted Extreme Speed; however, it's reliant on Scald's burn chance to check Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Jellicent stonewalls Lucario and can burn it with Will-O-Wisp. Chandelure is only 3HKOed by Meteor Mash, making it a pretty solid check unless Stealth Rock is up and it lacks Heavy-Duty Boots.

Reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots means that Togekiss greatly dislikes taking Knock Off, making Incineroar, Golisopod, and Pangoro less favorable matchups than they would appear. Togekiss is a situational check to Fighting-type Pokemon despite its typing because most have a way to get around it, such as Lucario and Toxicroak threatening it with their other STAB moves; this forces Togekiss's team to find other checks to Fighting-types.</p>",

Toxtricity can also act as an offensive Togekiss check but is susceptible to flinching.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Stakataka and the rare Tyrantrum can shrug off Air Slash but must be wary of Aura Sphere and, if worn down, repeated flinching. Diancie can check Togekiss no matter what coverage it's running, but only Toxic variants can consistently beat Togekiss.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Steelix, Registeel, and Metagross can handle Air Slash while threatening Togekiss in return. Lucario can't switch in as comfortably but outspeeds Togekiss.

Defog can be run if your team necessitates it, but Togekiss isn't a great user of the move because it struggles to beat common entry hazard setters like Metagross and Diancie and doesn't have the speed to use Defog in emergencies like Crobat.

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-C serves as a great pivot, largely due to its fantastic offensive typing, as its Leaf Storm can threaten common Volt Switch blockers such as Gastrodon, Flygon, and Steelix. Rotom-C also possesses many key resistances that halt opposing Electric-types, such as Xurkitree or Raikou from sweeping. Along with good natural typing, Levitate provides additional defensive utility. Along with Rotom-C's defensive utility, it can become a dangerous wallbreaker with Nasty Plot, threatening even the bulkiest special walls such as Registeel and Umbreon. Despite this, it can face competition from other Electric-types, as it lacks the raw power of Xurkitree and the natural Speed of Raikou. Choice Scarf Rotom-C blitzes by most other Choice Scarf users, such as Gardevoir, Heracross, and Chandelure; however, Flygon, the most common one, can outspeed and give it trouble. Rotom-C can also sometimes be awkward to fit on a team, as it is an Electric-type that does not resist Flying-type attacks from Crobat and Togekiss.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Rotom-C can run a utility set that relies on status moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, and Defog; it should also be paired with Volt Switch and Leaf Storm to retain its excellent pivoting capabilities. This set switches well into a variety of Pokemon, such as Metagross, Raikou, and Starmie. The issue with this set is its lack of reliable recovery, being outclassed by other Pokemon and it only checking a small pool of Pokemon. Shadow Ball is an option to cover Celebi and Dhelmise but doesn't hit much else and Rotom-C can already indirectly deal with them with Volt Switch to bring in a teammate. Substitute can be used on Nasty Plot sets, but spending HP often isn't worth it against more passive teams. Most Nasty Plot Rotom-C checks can break through Substitute easily too. Choice Specs can give Rotom-C the extra power it might lack but is overall inferior to Xurkitree.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Rotom-C is completely walled by the many Grass-types in the tier, such as Celebi, Roserade, Dhelmise, Vileplume, and Tsareena. It can only hope to cripple the defensive ones like physically defensive Roserade, Eldegoss, and Ferroseed with Trick.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Despite being able to Trick them a Choice Scarf or set up with Nasty Plot, Rotom-C can still struggle to break through special walls like Registeel, Guzzlord, and Bronzong, as it is vulnerable to Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types, primarily those neutral to Leaf Storm such as Flygon, Steelix, and Nidoqueen, block its Volt Switch, which disrupts its otherwise seamless pivoting; this is crucial for Choice Scarf sets. Although Flygon still takes a hefty chunk from Rotom-C's Leaf Storm, it can heal off most of it with Roost and can pivot on it with U-turn, which does a large amount of damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority</strong>:  Although Choice Scarf Rotom-C outspeeds a large portion of the meta, including base 80 and 85 Speed Choice Scarf Users like Chandelure, Gardevoir, and Heracross, faster Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Indeedee-M can threaten it with U-turn and Expanding Force, respectively. Golisopod's First Impression also forces out Rotom-C while Lucario, Mimikyu, and Entei can pick it off after a little chip.</p>",

Thunderbolt is a consistent attack that is useful for cleaning, but it also gives Rotom-C the extra power to OHKO offensive Crobat and Tornadus, and it is necessary when facing Togekiss, as Volt Switch doesn't force it out. If a team needs entry hazard removal, however, Defog can be run over Thunderbolt, but it is not preferred.</p> <p>Flygon is Rotom-C's most common partner, as it can threaten the bulky Steel-types that it cannot, as well as create a VoltTurn core that can be difficult to manage for the opposing team. Flygon also covers up Rotom-C's Fire weakness, which can be taken advantage of by Chandelure and Salazzle. In return, Rotom-C takes down the bulky Water- and Flying-types Flygon struggles with. Rotom-C's fantastic pivoting can also be taken advantage of by strong wallbreakers, such as Pangoro and Heracross, which also help with Steel-types. Unlike other Electric-types, Rotom-C has a difficult time switching into Togekiss, so having Rock-types such as Rhyperior, Aerodactyl, and Diancie are recommended for balance teams.

Due to Rotom-C's Grass typing, U-turn from Flygon, Noivern, and Crobat can do serious damage, which makes it difficult to sweep with Rotom-C.

Taunt stops walls like Umbreon and Milotic from healing up or inflicting status upon Vanilluxe, while Aurora Veil can help your teammates set up more easily.

Diancie and Rhyperior are notable for their ability to handle Fire-types like Chandelure and Incineroar, with Diancie also providing cleric support, and cover Escavalier's shortcoming as a Steel-type that does not resist Flying-types. Jellicent and Milotic appreciate Escavalier's ability to check Grass-types like Roserade and Celebi. Jellicent is particularly valuable as a partner if Escavalier has Megahorn, as without Close Combat, it is setup fodder for Bewear and Lucario. Crobat is an especially good teammate, as it can lure in Rock- and Steel-types like Diancie and Registeel with U-turn for Escavalier. Electric-types like Raikou and Xurkitree can pivot Escavalier in against Grass-types with Volt Switch and also cover Flying-types.</p>"

  "Jellicent": {
    "overview": "<p>Jellicent largely serves as a physical wall, being able to handle Heracross, Rhyperior, and Golisopod, but unlike most other bulky Water-types, it prevents Calm Mind Reuniclus, Cosmic Power Metagross, Calm Mind Suicune, and other setup sweepers from boosting with Taunt. Similarly to Milotic and Vaporeon, it can also cover certain special attackers, such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Nidoqueen lacking Toxic and Taunt. Jellicent's Ghost typing helps it deal with Fighting-type wallbreakers like Lucario, Bewear, and Heracross that Seismitoad, Milotic, and Gastrodon can struggle with. It can stallbreak through passive walls with Taunt and status, including Registeel, Umbreon, and Gastrodon, and spinblock utility Starmie and Dhelmise, outright walling the former and burning the latter. Unfortunately, unlike most bulky Water-types, Jellicent does not serve as a Knock Off absorber, struggling to deal with Knock Off from Incineroar and Heracross. Jellicent also doesn't provide as much utility as other bulky Water-types, like Rapid Spin with Starmie or Stealth Rock with Seismitoad. Its poor Speed also restricts the pool of Pokemon it can stallbreak against, as Milotic, Metagross, and Seismitoad can use Toxic before Jellicent's Taunt.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Cursed Body can be used over Water Absorb if a team can deal with powerful Water-type attacks, which includes having a good matchup against rain teams, Suicune, and Milotic. Cursed Body can stop foes from breaking through Jellicent by disabling their best attacks—especially if said attack would ever critically hit—and helps it stallbreak by increasing the chance a foe is forced to use Struggle. Night Shade can be used to better deal with Dark-types like Umbreon and Pangoro, but losing Hex makes Jellicent worse against Reuniclus. Choice Specs Jellicent with Water Spout and Trick can also be used as a solid wallbreaker and surprise option, but such a set is usually outdone by other offensive Water-types like Starmie and Sharpedo.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Roserade and Celebi can switch in and handle a Hex or Scald and remove burn with Natural Cure. Other Grass-types such as Dhelmise, Tsareena, and Decidueye can also beat Jellicent, though they must fear Will-O-Wisp, as they are physical attackers.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Incineroar is one of the best Jellicent switch-ins if it lacks Scald, setting up with Swords Dance for free. Mixed Sharpedo switches in nicely too, as burns don't weaken its Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: Xurkitree, Raikou, and Heliolisk can all force out Jellicent and gain momentum. However, if Raikou and Xurkitree are statused, Hex can 3HKO and 2HKO them, respectively. Heliolisk, however, completely walls Jellicent unless it carries Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Although Ghost-types like Mimikyu, Chandelure, and Polteageist cannot directly switch in, they can very easily force Jellicent out.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Many common threats that Jellicent otherwise wall run Knock Off, such as Heracross and Golisopod. Aside from the super effective damage, Jellicent losing its item worsens its longevity and makes it more passive, as Jellicent will be forced to use Recover more often.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Toxic poison and burn from Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Milotic, and Galarian Weezing wear down Jellicent. Furthermore, if it lacks Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazards quickly rack up damage. This forces Jellicent to constantly use Recover to be healthy enough to take on Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Bewear.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Jellicent runs a burning move to complement Hex, typically Will-O-Wisp to reliably weaken physical attackers like Bewear, Golisopod, and Flygon. Taunt allows Jellicent to overcome setup sweepers like Calm Mind Reuniclus and Metagross while also stopping slower Steel- and Water-types like Registeel and Gastrodon from using Toxic, which could otherwise debilitate Jellicent. Scald can be used over Will-O-Wisp to prevent Fire-types like Incineroar and Entei from safely switching in. Toxic can also be used to better threaten Pokemon like Incineroar and Heliolisk, but it can't hit Steel- and Poison-types like Registeel and Crobat to boost Hex. Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers help Jellicent deal with chip damage, lowering its need to use Recover and thus lowering its passivity. Colbur Berry allows Jellicent to tank Knock Off from Heracross, Golisopod, and Tornadus and stall offensive Dark-types like physical Sharpedo and Pangoro to burn them. Alternatively, running no item also lowers Knock Off damage and makes Jellicent immune to Poltergeist, which is handy when dealing with Golurk and Alolan Marowak, but neither is particularly common. Jellicent runs 44 Speed EVs to outspeed Umbreon, which is crucial in denying Umbreon's Wish passing. When using Leftovers, Jellicent should use 36 Special Defense EVs to prevent a 2HKO from Nidoqueen's Earth Power after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Jellicent, like other bulky Water-types, works best on balance teams, but it can fit on bulky offensive teams. However, on these offensive teams, it competes with Seismitoad and Golisopod; they have more utility in Knock Off and entry hazards in Stealth Rock and Spikes, and they are less passive. Jellicent supports teams without Flying-types, as it can handle Fighting-types such as Heracross, Lucario, and Toxicroak itself. However, Jellicent enjoys having a Flying-type teammate like Crobat or Togekiss to take Knock Off from Heracross and Golisopod. Electric-types such as Raikou, Xurkitree, and Heliolisk punish Jellicent well; having a Grass-type such as Roserade or Celebi alongside a Ground-type such as Steelix, Rhyperior, or Flygon can mitigate this issue. Opposing Roserade can take advantage of Jellicent to put up a layer of Spikes. Crobat and Reuniclus can force out Roserade quickly and gain momentum with U-turn or set up with Calm Mind. Despite not enjoying Hex, Celebi can switch in too and potentially threaten any given team with Nasty Plot. Guzzlord or Umbreon can help force the Celebi out. Umbreon can also remove any status Jellicent might receive. Entry hazard removal from Crobat and Flygon will also help Jellicent when it's not running Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

    "overview": "<p>With tremendous Special Attack, a decent Speed tier, and excellent offensive typing, Chandelure solidifies itself as a dangerous wallbreaker in the RU metagame. Using Steel-types like Registeel as a wallbreaking opportunity, it finds ample chances to come in and wreak havoc. It also checks dangerous setup sweepers like Lucario and Cosmic Power Metagross. Heavy-Duty Boots Chandelure doesn't need too much entry hazard support thanks to its item, and it can weaken its checks like Incineroar and Milotic with Toxic while simultaneously strengthening Hex. Choice Specs Chandelure is a very powerful wallbreaker that nukes most of the metagame, notably 2HKOing even specially defensive Umbreon with Fire Blast after minimal damage. Choice Scarf Chandelure is a good revenge killer and strong late-game cleaner that retains usefulness against bulkier teams with Trick. However, Choice item Chandelure bears a harsh Stealth Rock weakness. In general, Chandelure struggles against Dark-types and special walls like Incineroar, Umbreon, and Snorlax, but these can be debilitated by Trick from Choice item Chandelure or, in the case of the Dark-types, overpowered by Choice Specs sets. Without Choice Scarf, it's also easily revenge killed by Pokemon like Flygon, Noivern, and Sharpedo thanks to its subpar Speed tier and mediocre defenses. Sharpedo can still outspeed Choice Scarf Chandelure thanks to Speed Boost, and Flygon commonly runs Choice Scarf itself.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind Chandelure is a dangerous sweeper that's excellent at tearing through slower teams, but its middling Speed leaves this set worse off against offense teams. Taunt stops walls like Umbreon and Milotic from healing up and stops Toxic from them and Registeel. Flame Charge can turn Chandelure into a late-game sweeper, but it still gets easily revenge killed by Flygon, Raikou, and Noivern after minimal chip damage. An EV spread of 48 Def / 208 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature can be run on any set to avoid the OHKO from Choice Scarf Heracross's Stone Edge; however, Stone Edge Heracross is uncommon, so the extra wallbreaking power from the listed spread is better overall.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Guzzlord and Incineroar switch into and offensively pressure Chandelure. However, Toxic easily wears them down, Trick debilitates them, and they struggle to take repeated Choice Specs-boosted attacks. Sharpedo easily revenge kills Chandelure.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Snorlax and Umbreon eat up and recover from any attack Chandelure sends their way. However, they must be wary of Trick, and Umbreon is 2HKOed by Choice Specs-boosted Fire Blast after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Raikou, Flygon, and Starmie force Chandelure out due to their superior Speed. Choice Scarf Chandelure can take care of these foes once they're at low HP, but it still gets revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users like Xurkitree and Flygon.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: If lacking Heavy-Duty Boots, Chandelure is easily worn down by entry hazards, so it must be used more carefully.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types like Milotic and Suicune can come in and eat up Chandelure's STAB moves consistently while forcing it out with their own.

Protect lets Chandelure scout Choice-locked switch-ins such as Flygon and stall statused foes.

Bewear and Heracross also work well with Chandelure, taking care of Dark-types. Chandelure appreciates U-turn support from the likes of Crobat and Celebi to bring it into battle safely against Steel-types. Its middling Speed means faster special attackers such as Raikou and Starmie can force it out; offensive checks to them such as Choice Scarf Heracross and Rotom-C can therefore be useful.</p>"

Fighting-type wallbreakers like Bewear and Pangoro work well with Chandelure, taking advantage of Dark-types like Guzzlord and Incineroar. Dropping Heavy-Duty Boots also mandates entry hazard control from partners such as Starmie and Crobat. Galarian Weezing provides a Knock Off absorber and checks Pangoro and specially defensive Incineroar. In return, Chandelure clears Psychic- and Steel-types like Reuniclus, Registeel, and Bronzong. Dark-types like Incineroar tend to wall Chandelure, so a check to them such as Gastrodon or Diancie is also appreciated. Hazards like Spikes from Roserade, Heracross, and Golisopod help with beating Dark-types as well. Due to Chandelure's ability to lure in and weaken Fire- and Water-types like Incineroar and Milotic, partners like Celebi and Flygon enjoy its presence. In return, Celebi takes advantage of Water-types, while Flygon pivots Chandelure in via U-turn.

  "Golurk": {
    "overview": "<p>Golurk has made a name for itself in RU as a fearsome wallbreaker with no true counters due its high Attack stat and powerful coverage moves, especially its Poltergeist. Unlike other Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Decidueye, Golurk easily breaks through common Ghost-resistant and -immune foes like Umbreon, Incineroar, and Snorlax with Close Combat and Earthquake. Even though Golurk is not a fast Pokemon, it is still fast enough to outspeed common defensive threats such as Reuniclus, Registeel, and Diancie. Nevertheless, Golurk's low Speed and weaknesses to common offensive typings such as Grass, Water, and Ghost make it struggle to find switch-in opportunities, and it is easily revenge killed by faster threats such as Roserade, Xurkitree, and Chandelure. Golurk also struggles against potential itemless Pokemon such as Flygon and Xatu due to Poltergeist failing against them. This complicates the teambuilding process due to its incompatibility with Knock Off users. Golurk faces competition from other Ghost- and Ground-types such as Chandelure, Dhelmise, and Flygon, as they are either faster, easier to integrate into the team, or provide more utility. Unlike other Ground-types, Golurk is unable to check common Electric-types like Raikou and Xurkitree due to their super effective coverage moves and higher Speed.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Ice Punch is an option to better deal with Flying-types and itemless defensive Flygon, but it does not have much use outside of this. A Rock Polish set with Life Orb turns Golurk into a strong late-game sweeper; however, it is often outclassed by Mimikyu and Polteageist, as they have more setup opportunities and are harder to revenge kill. Golurk can function as a Stealth Rock setter, but it prefers running coverage moves to punch holes in the opposing team. Dynamic Punch has a tempting secondary effect and can be used over Close Combat, but Golurk prefers the extra power from Close Combat to OHKO Ghost-resistant or -immune walls such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2. Choice Scarf Golurk has a good matchup against offense teams and can lure threats such as Xurkitree, Raikou, and Celebi. Unfortunately, this set loses much of its wallbreaking power and is often outclassed by other Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Chandelure due to their higher Speed stat and, in the case of Flygon, utility in U-turn.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Bulky Dark-types such as Umbreon and Incineroar can reliably switch into Golurk's Poltergeist and threaten it with their Dark-type STAB moves. However, Golurk KOes every Dark-type with Close Combat or, Incineroar's case, with both Earthquake and Close Combat, so they must be careful of switching in. Offensive Dark-types such as Swords Dance Incineroar and Sharpedo can easily revenge kill Golurk with their strong STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Golurk's low Speed and common weaknesses, faster Pokemon such as Pangoro, Roserade, and Chandelure can revenge kill it. Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Energy Ball Xurkitree, Shadow Ball Raikou, and Darkest Lariat Bewear can also revenge kill Golurk.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types</strong>: Normal-types such as Snorlax, Porygon2, and Bewear are immune to Poltergeist and take advantage of Golurk if it locks into that move. However, they must watch out for its coverage moves, specifically Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Itemless Pokemon</strong>: Golurk's greatest strength is its strong Poltergeist, which is why it struggles against Pokemon that run no item or lose it over the course of the battle. Defensive Flygon, Reuniclus, and Xatu run no item to better switch into Golurk. White Herb Polteageist and Barbaracle will lose their item over the course of the battle, which enables them to switch into Poltergeist or take advantage of Golurk once it is locked into this move. Lastly, if Golurk's team decides to have a Knock Off user, it is important to know that every opposing Pokemon will be immune to Poltergeist once they lose their item.</p>",

Therefore, a reliable check to them such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Celebi, or Roserade is recommended. These Pokemon also provide Future Sight or entry hazard support. Since itemless Flygon is the best defensive switch-in to Golurk, pairing Golurk with offensive answers to it, such as Noivern, Starmie, and Gardevoir, is recommendable.

Knock Off allows Tornadus to weaken its typical switch-ins such as Raikou, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Registeel by removing their items. U-turn allows Tornadus to gain momentum and pivot out of disadvantageous matchups. Tailwind is a great move to support slower teammates or give them more sweeping potential. Heat Wave, on the other hand, gives Tornadus a better matchup versus Steel-types such as Metagross, Steelix, and Klefki. Even though Tornadus is not the best defogger in RU, its ability to remove entry hazards safely due to its Prankster Defog can be useful in important situations. Taunt is an option to cripple passive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Umbreon and to prevent Pokemon such as Barbaracle and Snorlax from setting up on it. Rain Dance turns Tornadus into a secondary rain setter for rain teams.

Strong but fragile Pokemon such as Obstagoon, Toxtricity, and Indeedee-M appreciate Tornadus's U-turn support. In addition, these strong attackers are good examples of Pokemon that benefit from Tornadus's Tailwind support. Other pivots such as Raikou, Xurkitree, and Cobalion pair well with Tornadus, since they form an offensive VoltTurn core together.

Outside of rain, Focus Blast is Tornadus's strongest option against various targets like Umbreon, Snorlax, Diancie, and Stakataka. Grass Knot hits Milotic and Suicune hardest, while also being an accurate option for other threats like Gastrodon and Golurk. However, Grass Knot covers much less important targets than Tornadus's other coverage, notably even the lightweight Diancie takes negligible damage, and the aforementioned bulky Water-types are all hit hard by Hurricane anyways.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Tornadus has a niche in RU as a strong wallbreaker on many archetypes, especially on rain and hyper offense teams.

Tornadus fits well on rain teams, where Politoed is a necessary teammate. Kabutops and Kingdra as strong rain sweepers overwhelm bulkier Pokemon alongside Tornadus. In return, Tornadus checks bulky Water- and Grass-types. Lastly, Tornadus can also be used on dual screens teams, where the screens support give it more setup opportunities.

U-turn is helpful to keep momentum and bring in frailer wallbreakers and other teammates. Flare Blitz and Toxic can be run over Brave Bird and Will-O-Wisp to make Talonflame more immediately threatening to Steel-types and Electric-types; Toxic also makes it harder for Water-types to handle it.

Talonflame has the option to run a Swords Dance set with maximum Attack investment as well as Flare Blitz and Swords Dance over U-turn and Will-O-Wisp, which threatens common Flying-resistant Pokemon like Raikou and Steelix. Swords Dance Talonflame still struggles to break past most bulky Water- and Rock-types and loses immense utility by not having U-turn or Will-O-Wisp, however. 240 Speed EVs let Talonflame outspeed Ribombee. While an offensive EV spread is preferred, Talonflame can alternatively run a physically defensive EV spread of 16 HP / 252 Def / 240 Spe to more reliably check Lucario, Dhelmise, and Metagross, but it gives up the ability to guarantee a 2HKO on Chandelure.</p> <p>Talonflame cannot do much to the many Rock- and Water-type Pokemon like Diancie, Milotic, and Gastrodon in the tier, so Celebi, Milotic, and Roserade make good teammates that are able to switch in and threaten these Pokemon. Roserade and Celebi are especially notable, as they also handle Electric-types that threaten Talonflame like Raikou and Xurkitree. Talonflame's ability to lure in Rock- and Water-types such as Stakataka, Diancie, and Milotic can give free switches to teammates like Golurk, Decidueye, and Heracross thanks to U-turn. Talonflame appreciates cleric support from Diancie, Vileplume, and Sylveon to reliably handle Toxic users such as Metagross and defensive Stakataka. Talonflame isn't a reliable Fighting-type check on its own, so Mimikyu and Galarian Weezing make good teammates for it that are able to assist against Heracross and Pangoro. Knock Off can ruin Talonflame by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots, making it vulnerable to Stealth Rock; Knock Off absorbers like Galarian Weezing, Vileplume, and Gastrodon can take Knock Off for Talonflame. Frailer wallbreakers like Life Orb Starmie and Choice Specs Gardevoir appreciate Talonflame's ability to easily bring them in with U-turn.</p>"

  "Pangoro": {
    "overview": "<p>Pangoro is a great wallbreaker in RU. With its power, near-unresisted STAB combination, and coverage, it can 2HKO or OHKO the whole metagame, outright taking advantage of common Steel- and Dark-types like Registeel, Bronzong, and Umbreon. It's one of the tier's best Fighting-type wallbreakers, lacking hard counters unlike Lucario and Heracross. Pangoro also has another key advantage—priority in Bullet Punch, which revenge kills weakened setup sweepers. Choice Band Pangoro is the most immediately threatening set; it takes down the likes of Rhyperior and physically defensive Registeel with minimal prior damage and isn't worn down by Life Orb recoil. Alternatively, Swords Dance Pangoro deals with Umbreon and revenge killers like Gardevoir and Togekiss. Pangoro's low Speed and lackluster defensive profile make it poor against highly offensive teams, which are filled with fast Pokemon that OHKO it like Lucario and Sharpedo. Also, while Pangoro is near unwallable, Lucario and Heracross are faster, allowing them to better threaten offensive Pokemon like Xurkitree, Goodra, and Chandelure. Lucario is also a fearsome sweeper with Extreme Speed, and Bewear has superior defensive utility; Fluffy lets Bewear check Pokemon like Golisopod, makes it harder for Crobat to revenge kill, and even lets it help versus other Fighting-types if it holds Chople Berry.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Close Combat is an option over Drain Punch on Swords Dance sets that OHKOes Milotic and Gastrodon while boosted, as well as Rhyperior and physically defensive Registeel with minimal prior damage. Coba Berry is an option on Swords Dance Pangoro to turn the tables on revenge killers like Crobat and Togekiss. Black Glasses increases Pangoro's power without incurring recoil, which makes Close Combat more justifiable over Drain Punch with Swords Dance. Lum Berry heals burns from Starmie's or Milotic's Scald, Jellicent's Will-O-Wisp, and Toxic from Bronzong and Registeel. However, Lum Berry significantly compromises Pangoro's power, notably making it less efficient at breaking through Crobat.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Togekiss and Galarian Weezing can take both of Pangoro's STAB moves; however, they're both 2HKOed by Iron Head, and Togekiss becomes vulnerable to Stealth Rock after Knock Off. Galarian Weezing is an especially effective check to Swords Dance Pangoro without Iron Head, as Bullet Punch only 4HKOes it, while Togekiss falls to +2 Bullet Punch after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Crobat and Noivern can both pivot into Pangoro's Fighting-type moves, though Noivern is deathly afraid of Choice Band-boosted Knock Off or Life Orb-boosted Knock Off + Bullet Punch, and Knock Off leaves Crobat with little health and no Heavy-Duty Boots. Due to Crobat's Brave Bird recoil, either Pangoro set can then choose to trade with it or at least leave it in KO range of Stealth Rock. If Crobat uses Roost, Pangoro can potentially beat it with another Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Many faster Fighting-types like Lucario, Heracross, and Bewear revenge kill Pangoro. Bewear is also a decent switch-in, as it can take Knock Off comfortably, Life Orb-boosted Drain Punch fairly well, and even a Choice Band-boosted Close Combat in a pinch if it has Chople Berry.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Plenty of faster Pokemon like Sharpedo, Xurkitree, Toxtricity, and Choice Specs Chandelure easily revenge kill Pangoro.</p>",

Alternatively, Darkest Lariat gives Pangoro a better matchup against Defense-boosting sweepers like Cosmic Power Metagross and the uncommon Acid Armor Reuniclus. Scrappy allows Pangoro to use Close Combat without fear of Ghost-types like Chandelure and Dhelmise coming in.</p> <p>Pangoro loves pivot support from the likes of Xurkitree, Heliolisk, and Crobat to bring it in against Pokemon like Registeel and Steelix. Additionally, Xurkitree and Heliolisk check Togekiss. Fighting-types such as Heracross, Bewear, and Lucario revenge kill Pangoro. Togekiss checks the first two, Crobat checks Heracross and revenge kills Lucario, and Jellicent and Chandelure check Lucario and Bewear. Steel-types like Registeel and Steelix check Flying-types like Crobat and Togekiss. In return, Pangoro's Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Crobat and Togekiss, increasing the effectiveness of their Stealth Rock. Special attackers like Roserade and Nidoqueen take advantage of Galarian Weezing for Pangoro. Choice Band Pangoro can struggle to break through very defensive teams with Umbreon, since it can scout Pangoro's Choice-locked attack with Protect, so it likes teammates generally strong against such teams like Nasty Plot Togekiss and Taunt Nidoqueen.</p>"

However, Doublade struggles with its heavy reliance on Eviolite to augment its bulk and general competition with other Steel- and Ghost-types like Stakataka, Golurk, and Metagross. Doublade is also easily revenge killed because many faster threats like Xurkitree and Noivern easily avoid an OHKO from +2 Shadow Sneak. Shadow Claw is resisted by very few Pokemon and gives Doublade a more powerful Ghost-type attack to hit the likes of Toxtricity, Metagross, and Golisopod. Alternatively, Iron Head enables Doublade to threaten Fairy-types like Galarian Weezing, Togekiss, and Grimmsnarl. Close Combat hits Steel-types like Steelix and Stakataka as well as Dark-types like Umbreon, Incineroar, and Guzzlord.

Unfortunately, Slurpuff faces competition from other setup sweepers such as Mimikyu, Cloyster, and Dragon Dance Flygon, as they have an easier time setting up because of their respective speed and bulk, which allows them to break through teams more easily. Slurpuff also faces stiff competition as a Belly Drum sweeper from Linoone, which has an amazing movepool that is resisted by very few Pokemon. Drain Punch is used to hit Steel-types such as Registeel, Stakataka, and Steelix, while Facade is used to hit Poison-types such as Crobat, Vileplume, and Galarian Weezing.</p> <p>Because Slurpuff is a late-game sweeper, it belongs on hyper offensive teams. Galarian Weezing can support Slurpuff with Misty Terrain, preventing it from being crippled with status. In addition, Galarian Weezing can also provide Memento support, allowing Slurpuff to set up on a weakened foe. Entry hazard support from Roserade, Golisopod, and Metagross can ease Slurpuff's ability to sweep through teams. Other setup sweepers, such as Cloyster and Toxtricity, are good teammates, as they can set up on Pokemon such as Steelix, Vileplume, and Crobat. Slurpuff fails to break past Steel-types such as Metagross and Doublade, so checks to these Pokemon such as Incineroar, Chandelure, and Entei are important.

Yawn is used to force switches and prevent opposing Pokemon from using Slurpuff as setup fodder. Endeavor is used to bring down a foe's HP once Slurpuff's Focus Sash has been activated. Alternatively, Magic Coat can be used to bounce back entry hazards from Pokemon such as Bronzong, Golisopod, and Klefki. Finally, Misty Explosion is used to damage an opposing Pokemon while maintaining momentum. 0 IVs in HP, Defense, and Special Defense allow Slurpuff to activate its Focus Sash more consistently.</p> <p>Because Slurpuff's role is to set up Sticky Web, Pokemon that can take advantage of Sticky Web to sweep, such as Mimikyu and Lucario, make good teammates.

Grass Knot covers Gastrodon, which otherwise handles both STAB attacks. On the other hand, Protect is an option over Grass Knot because it allows Barbaracle to stop priority moves such as First Impression while also being able to scout Choice-locked Pokemon. Life Orb provides more damage output, allowing it to OHKO bulkless Celebi and Metagross via +2 Stone Edge and Liquidation, respectively. However, the Life Orb recoil coupled with the defensive drops from Shell Smash makes Barbaracle easy to wear down and revenge kill. White Herb can be used over Life Orb because it removes the Defense and Special Defense drops after a Shell Smash, which allows Barbaracle to not take as much damage when setting up. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Choice Scarf Flygon after a Shell Smash.</p> <p>Barbaracle mainly fits on hyper offense teams, as it appreciates it checks to be quickly run over for an easy sweep or breaks for its teammates to clean up.

However, Abomasnow being able to beat Water-types is generally far more important than Aurorus handling hazard setters like Klefki, Nidoqueen, and Metagross, making this set almost entirely unused.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Starmie</strong>: Starmie is the only entry hazard remover that Aurorus can't scare out, and it can even shrug off paralysis with Natural Cure.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types like Registeel, Steelix, and Bronzong don't appreciate Encore, but, with correct predictions, they can potentially set their own entry hazards and KO Aurorus with Heavy Slam or Gyro Ball. Cosmic Power Metagross can potentially set up on Aurorus with correct predictions and snowball out of control.</p>",

        "description": "<p>With a Modest nature, Blizzard OHKOes common entry hazard removers such as Crobat and Dhelmise, which Freeze-Dry fails to do. Encore discourages opposing hazard setters and setup sweepers such as Registeel, Metagross, and Reuniclus from taking advantage of Aurorus, and it potentially opens setup opportunities for its teammates. Earth Power hits Steel- and Fire-types like Lucario and Chandelure directly. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can cripple them, alongside problematic Pokemon like Choice Scarf Heracross and Gardevoir. Finally, Focus Sash guarantees Stealth Rock goes up against the majority of the metagame.</p> <p>Because of its place in dedicated hail teams, Aurorus is always paired with a secondary hail setter; Abomasnow is almost always preferred because it can deal with Water-types, which can be troublesome for hail teams. This secondary setter is especially important considering that Aurorus must be played offensively, so it's unlikely to survive into the late-game. Similarly, Arctovish and Alolan Sandslash are hail staples, forming a fearsome offensive core and wearing down their own checks together. Hail teams appreciate a lot of role compression in the last two teamslots; glue Pokemon like Xatu, Starmie, Flygon, and Crobat can check off several important requirements, such as checking Fire-, Fighting-, and Steel-types while removing entry hazards. Complements to the offensive hail core, like Toxicroak and Raikou, can be considered as well; Toxicroak sets up on Water-types and Golisopod, while Raikou, besides smashing Water-types, can use Weather Ball in hail to cover Grass- and Dragon-types in one move. Spinblockers like Mimikyu and Doublade can preserve Aurorus's Stealth Rock.</p>"

  "Goodra": {
    "overview": "<p>Goodra's solid Special Attack and high-Base Power moves with wide coverage give it a niche as a dangerous wallbreaker, capable of dismantling common defensive cores in the metagame. Its decent defensive typing, naturally great special bulk, and Sap Sipper give it good defensive utility and afford it ample opportunities to switch into special attackers such as Raikou, Celebi, and Rotom-C, or defensive Pokemon such as Vileplume. However, because Goodra relies on its array of coverage moves and defensive profile to be threatening, it usually runs Expert Belt over a stronger item such as Life Orb or Choice Specs; as a result, it is not powerful enough to bust through common specially bulky Pokemon such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Reuniclus, especially since Expert Belt rarely boosts its STAB Draco Meteor. Goodra also often relies on inaccurate moves like Thunder and Hydro Pump to properly wallbreak, making it inconsistent. Finally, while Goodra's Speed tier is good enough to outpace threats such as Nidoqueen and Metagross, it is outpaced by many powerful physical attackers that can prey on its subpar Defense, such as Heracross, Lucario, Mimikyu, and Flygon.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Flamethrower and Surf are fair options for more reliability than Fire Blast and Hydro Pump. However, the drop in power is costly, as Goodra will fail to 3HKO Registeel with the former move or OHKO Rhyperior and Chandelure with the latter. Sludge Bomb is a possible alternative to an Electric-type attack, as it 2HKOes Grimmsnarl and Gardevoir, which otherwise can take two hits from Goodra with ease, and still targets Togekiss. However, Goodra will then miss out on Milotic and be setup fodder for Suicune. Choice Specs can amp up Goodra's wallbreaking power, in particular making its Draco Meteor much more threatening, but makes it very prediction reliant. A Choice Band set with Outrage and coverage moves such as Power Whip and Earthquake can be a nasty surprise for some of Goodra's best checks, scoring 2HKOes on Snorlax, Umbreon, Milotic, and Registeel. However, relying on the very risky Outrage as Goodra's main move leaves it easily revenge killed and makes it far less reliable overall. Choice Scarf is also usable to catch faster Pokemon such as Noivern and Crobat off guard and revenge kill many of Goodra's usual offensive checks, while Assault Vest takes advantage of Goodra's huge natural special bulk to better check Pokemon such as Celebi, Nidoqueen, and Raikou. However, both of these options greatly diminish Goodra's wallbreaking potential.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Umbreon can take any attack from Goodra and hit back with Foul Play. Though rare, Cresselia and Porygon2 can also wall Goodra with ease and chip it down. If it has specially defensive EVs, Milotic can usually avoid the 2HKO from even Thunder and wear Goodra down with Ice Beam or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Registeel is only 3HKOed by Goodra's Fire Blast and can put it on a timer with Toxic. Bronzong can also debilitate Goodra with Toxic, but it must be careful when switching in, as Fire Blast has a significant chance to 2HKO it. Metagross can take one Fire Blast and heavily damage Goodra back with Meteor Mash, while Stakataka can survive Hydro Pump and nearly OHKO Goodra with Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Flygon OHKOes Goodra with Outrage and can freely pivot with U-turn or use Dragon Dance upon forcing it out. Mimikyu can take two hits from Goodra due to Disguise and its decent special bulk, letting it freely set up Swords Dance and usually OHKO Goodra with +2 Shadow Claw. Powerful Fighting-types such as Heracross, Lucario, and Toxicroak outspeed Goodra and threaten huge damage with Close Combat or Gunk Shot, while Sharpedo can take out a slightly weakened Goodra with Crunch and garner a free activation of Speed Boost.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers</strong>: Snorlax can switch into Goodra and use it as setup fodder with Curse. Reuniclus can't switch in as easily, as Draco Meteor will force it to use Recover, but it can just as easily use Goodra to set up with Calm Mind if it can get in safely. Suicune struggles to switch in safely, but it can similarly use Calm Mind to quickly become near-impossible for Goodra to break through.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Fire Blast hits Celebi and bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Steelix hard. Thunderbolt hits Milotic and Togekiss, which would otherwise comfortably wall Goodra, along with other Water- and Flying-types such as Starmie and Crobat. Thunder hits Togekiss notably harder and guarantees the 2HKO against Milotic, which Thunderbolt cannot achieve, at the cost of shaky accuracy. Hydro Pump OHKOes Rhyperior and Chandelure and deals excellent damage to Nidoqueen, Diancie, and specially defensive Incineroar. Sap Sipper allows Goodra to absorb Sleep Powder and Grass-type attacks from Roserade, Vileplume, and Rotom-C, giving it more opportunities to switch in safely. Expert Belt increases Goodra's power against the myriad of Pokemon that it can hit super effectively while not harming its versatility or longevity, like Choice Specs or Life Orb would. A Timid nature is necessary to outspeed Nidoqueen and Toxtricity and Speed tie with Chandelure.</p> <p>Physical attackers that can break down Goodra's specially defensive answers are excellent partners. Heracross and Bewear in particular can obliterate Snorlax, Umbreon, and Registeel with their Fighting-type attacks, and in return Goodra can soften up their checks such as Togekiss and Jellicent. Heracross also can also carry Spikes, which augments Goodra's wallbreaking power greatly. Mimikyu also pairs very well with Goodra, as it can sweep with greater ease once Goodra has weakened their shared switch-ins, such as Steelix, Registeel, and Galarian Weezing. Because of its middling Speed and poor Defense, Goodra is best paired with multiple pivots to enter battle safely. Milotic and Crobat can handle many of the physical attackers that trouble Goodra and pivot it in with Flip Turn and U-turn, respectively. Golisopod can support Goodra with Spikes and Knock Off, revenge kill fast threats such as Flygon and Gardevoir with First Impression, and bring Goodra in for free with Emergency Exit. Electric-type pivots such as Xurkitree and Rotom-C can bait in Grass-types for Goodra to take advantage of, check Milotic, and bother shared checks with Volt Switch and Trick. Finally, Stealth Rock support is valuable to chip Pokemon such as Milotic and Nidoqueen into range of Goodra's attacks; Steelix is a particularly effective partner in this role, as it pressures Registeel, checks Fairy-types such as Mimikyu and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and benefits from Goodra checking Raikou.</p>"

Toxic in the final slot ensures that Klefki has a way to threaten Ground-type Pokemon like Golurk and Electric-type Pokemon like Xurkitree and Raikou, though it is less valuable for faster paced offensive teams, as the gradual poisoning damage doesn't have as many turns to add up. Foul Play can be used over Toxic in order to give Klefki a way to punish a number of its checks, such as Golurk, Metagross, and Bronzong, as they switch in. Magnet Rise is an option that allows Klefki to continue setting Spikes even against certain Ground-type Pokemon like Nidoqueen and Flygon.

It also partners well with Celebi, as it's able to take on and cripple most of the Flying-types that check it with Thunder Wave.

    "overview": "<p>Noivern provides excellent utility to any team as an offensive pivot or Defogger. Its typing and sky-high Speed tier let it check and revenge kill a vast array of common Pokemon such as Heracross and Celebi. Noivern excels as a pivot, providing frequent free switches for wallbreakers while forming potent VoltTurn cores with Xurkitree, Raikou, and Flygon. As a Defogger, Noivern has some of the better matchups against common entry hazard setters, being able to threaten Golisopod, Steelix, and Roserade but struggling with Stakataka, Diancie, and Registeel. Noivern's defensive utility is greatly diminished by its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can't switch in on Pokemon such as Incineroar, Seismitoad, and Golisopod without the risk of getting hit by Knock Off. Furthermore, Noivern's mediocre Special Attack means it barely scratches special walls like Diancie, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Umbreon while also leaving it as setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus, Suicune, and Nasty Plot Togekiss. However, Noivern can circumvent its switch-ins by providing a free switch for powerful wallbreakers with U-turn.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Frisk can be chosen to scout items due to the situational use of Infiltrator. Toxic can cripple common switch-ins to Noivern such as Togekiss, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. With Toxic, Noivern can also act as a hard stop to Calm Mind + Substitute Suicune thanks to Infiltrator. However, using Toxic means giving up on the great utility provided by U-turn or Defog, which is difficult to justify on most teams. A stallbreaker set with Taunt prevents Bronzong and Registeel from setting Stealth Rock and walls like Milotic, Togekiss, and Snorlax from healing. Generally, Hurricane is the preferred STAB option alongside Taunt because it gives better odds of beating Calm Mind Suicune. Switcheroo can be run alongside Choice Scarf to cripple Noivern's switch-ins such as Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. Swapping items with bulky set-up Pokemon like Snorlax, Reuniclus, and Suicune neutralizes their attempts at a sweep. Noivern is also the fastest Choice Scarf user in RU and can even outspeed and revenge kill +2 Cloyster. However, Choice Scarf sets are greatly limited by Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn pivots like Crobat, Flygon, and Celebi. It can also be used alongside Taunt to always beat Registeel. The big downfall with Rocky Helmet is that it also leaves Noivern vulnerable to Stealth Rock.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Diancie, and Grimmsnarl wall Noivern. Diancie is especially troublesome for Defog Noivern because it can freely switch in on the turn Noivern uses Defog and set Stealth Rock again. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can revenge kill Noivern, and Mimikyu can use Defog sets as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Special walls such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2 take very little damage from Noivern's attacks. Reuniclus can set up Future Sight or remove an item with Knock Off, Umbreon gets a free Wish for itself or its teammates, Snorlax sets up Curse, and Porygon2 pivots out with Teleport or cripples something with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf users</strong>: Choice Scarf users such as Flygon, Gardevoir, Heracross, and Xurkitree can revenge kill Noivern from full or after a slight bit of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Certain Steel-types like Registeel, Stakataka, Bronzong, and Klefki can take Flamethrower from Noivern multiple times.

U-turn takes advantage of Noivern's switch-ins to provide a free switch for its teammates. Noivern can opt for Defog if the team is in need of entry hazard removal. Heavy-Duty Boots is necessary because Noivern is held down by Stealth Rock otherwise. With Infiltrator, Noivern can ignore Substitute from certain Raikou and Chandelure sets.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Lucario, and Entei appreciate the free switch provided by U-turn and take advantage of common switch-ins to Noivern like Assault Vest Reuniclus, Togekiss, and Umbreon.

Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Xurkitree and Gardevoir get ravaged by entry hazards and therefore appreciate Noivern as a Defogger. Noivern does next to nothing to Fairy-types like Togekiss and Diancie, so Fairy-type answers like Metagross, Steelix, and Registeel are crucial.

It is also a reliable Stealth Rock setter that pressures various Defoggers such as Crobat and Noivern with its powerful Diamond Storm, and it provides additional support with Heal Bell. Diamond Storm’s high chance of boosting Diancie’s Defense can make it difficult to revenge kill and strengthens its Body Press, making it less passive. However, Diancie's lack of reliable recovery and susceptibility to entry hazards and status moves make it easy to wear down over the course of the battle or at least force it to be more passive with Heal Bell. Its typing leaves it weak to common threats such as Metagross, Rhyperior, Flygon, and Roserade, as well as the common spinners Dhelmise and Starmie. In addition, Diancie often invites fearsome threats such as Nidoqueen and Golurk in, and setup sweepers such as Reuniclus, Celebi, and Toxicroak can turn it into setup fodder due to its mediocre offensive stats and movepool. Diancie faces competition from other specially defensive Stealth Rock setters such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Stakataka, which have more advantageous typings with important resistances to types like Fairy, Psychic, and Grass to better check threats like Gardevoir and Roserade.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Power Gem has more PP then Diamond Storm, making it better in the long term and against threats such as Xatu and Togekiss. However, Diamond Storm's Defense boosts make it usually better. Moonblast enables Diancie to better deal with Pokemon such as Heracross and Flygon, and its high chance of lowering Special Attack comes in handy against common threats such as Nidoqueen and Calm Mind Reuniclus. Unfortunately, Moonblast is hard to fit over another move. Earth Power is an option for the last moveslot to hit Nidoqueen, Doublade, Toxtricity, and Toxicroak super effectively. However, it does little else and only 3HKOes Nidoqueen, while Doublade and Toxtricity are rather uncommon. Encore better handles Calm Mind Reuniclus but is hard to fit over another move, since it has low use outside of this. More offensive sets such as offensive Trick Room, bulky Calm Mind, Rock Polish sweeper, and Meteor Beam + Power Herb are quite conceivable. However, Pokemon such as Stakataka and Reuniclus perform these roles much better due to their better offensive stats.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Offensive Steel-types such as Lucario, Escavalier, and Metagross put Diancie under immense pressure with their super effective STAB attacks. However, the former struggles to switch in, since it takes good damage from Diancie's Body Press. Defensive Steel-types such as Steelix and Bronzong take less from Body Press and OHKO Diancie with either Heavy Slam or Gyro Ball. If Registeel lacks Heavy Slam, the best it can do is weaken Diancie with Toxic. Despite being able to OHKO Diancie with Gyro Ball, Stakataka is slower then it and takes a lot from Body Press, especially offensive variants. However, every mentioned Steel-type stumbles as soon as Diancie has a Defense increase from Diamond Storm, since they take more damage from Body Press and cause less damage to it. Doublade easily uses Diancie as setup fodder due its typing and high physical bulk, but Doublade is very uncommon and must watch out for Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Nidoqueen and Golurk do heavy damage to Diancie with their powerful STAB moves and easily switch into it, since they take little from its attacks; only Golurk dislikes Toxic. Flygon can pressure Diancie with its strong Earthquake but can lose the matchup if Diancie's Defense is boosted through Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types such as Roserade and Rotom-C threaten Diancie with their powerful Grass-type STAB attacks but fail to OHKO Diancie and take a lot from its Diamond Storm. Nasty Plot Celebi with Recover uses Diancie as setup fodder, but utility variants have a rather shaky matchup against it, since Grass Knot does not do much to it. Dhelmise has a high chance to OHKO Diancie and can remove Stealth Rock through Rapid Spin. Bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume have nothing to fear from Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Milotic, and Suicune have little to fear from Diancie's attacks and threaten it with either a burn through Scald or Toxic. However, Gastrodon and Milotic dislike Toxic, though Suicune can play around it with either Rest or Substitute. Offensive Water-types such as Starmie, Sharpedo, and Golisopod take a lot from Diancie's attacks, but once they get a safe switch in, they can either KO a weakened Diancie or force it out with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers</strong>: Powerful wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Guts Heracross, and Choice Specs Chandelure easily overwhelm Diancie with their attacks. However, they all take a lot from Diancie's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Toxicroak take little from Diancie's attacks and do not care about Toxic due to their abilities or typing, which enable them to use Diancie as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage and Trick</strong>: Since Diancie lacks recovery besides Leftovers, it is easy to wear it down over time with chip damage from entry hazards and burn or poison. In addition, many Pokemon Diancie switches into can cripple it, such as Chandelure and Noivern with Toxic or Entei with Sacred Fire. Diancie can cure its status with Heal Bell, but this makes it more passive. Beyond that, Diancie is a team's main answer to Dark-types, meaning it will often lose its Leftovers quickly through Knock Off from Pokemon such as Incineroar. Trick users such as Chandelure and Gardevoir limit Diancie by giving it a Choice item with Trick and stealing its only recovery in Leftovers.</p>",

Heal Bell is also a great choice, since it makes Diancie less susceptible to status and can relieve a teammate from the cleric role. Toxic cripples bulky foes such as Gastrodon, Milotic, and Dhelmise and gives a better matchup against Togekiss, since bulky variants can stall out Diamond Storm with Roost. 20 Speed EVs allow Diancie to outspeed Sassy Incineroar.

Bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and defensive Flygon check offensive Steel-types like Metagross and Lucario. Fighting-types such as Heracross, Pangoro, and Lucario, on the other hand, check defensive Steel-types like Bronzong and Steelix for Diancie. They appreciate its ability to check Flying-types for them and lay down Stealth Rock. Umbreon and Vaporeon are great teammates for Diancie, since they provide Wish support and check various threats that Diancie cannot check such as Nidoqueen, Sharpedo, and Starmie. In return, Diancie relieves them of the cleric role. Ghost- and Dark-types such as Chandelure, Incineroar, and Guzzlord check Calm Mind Reuniclus, Nasty Plot Celebi, and the common spinners Starmie and Dhelmise reliably, which take huge advantage of Diancie.

Shadow Sneak is a useful priority move that can hit threats such as Polteageist and Chandelure. Alternatively, Spirit Shackle is a decent option with Knock Off support to pressure Flying-types such as Togekiss, in addition to giving free momentum.

Suicune is also capable of setting up on Incineroar, but it must be careful not to switch directly into Knock Off. Offensive Water-types, such as Sharpedo, Starmie, and Kingdra, are also threatening, although their frailty means they must be very cautious about switching in.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Stakataka and Diancie take Incineroar's STAB moves quite well and use it to set up Stealth Rock or fire off an attack.

Toxic can catch threats such as Gastrodon, Diancie, and Milotic, although Swords Dance can improve Incineroar's matchup against Calm Mind Reuniclus and Strength Sap Polteageist. Incineroar is quite effective at spreading Toxic, as most Steel- and Poison-types do not want to switch into Overheat or Knock Off. U-turn is preferred for pivoting because Clear Body and Magic Bounce users cannot block it and because most Rocky Helmet users aren't eager to switch into Incineroar. Parting Shot weakens foes instead, giving a bit more safety to frail attackers, such as Gardevoir, Heliolisk, and Starmie, and setup sweepers, such as Cloyster, Mimikyu, and Barbaracle. A Sassy nature is used because Incineroar is pretty slow already and it doesn't want to weaken either of its main attacks, while a specially defensive spread improves Incineroar's matchup against threats such as Chandelure, Salazzle, and Roserade. 20 Attack EVs ensure that Knock Off OHKOes Chandelure.</p> <p>Incineroar properly switching into Chandelure and being a great buffer against most Fire-types is appreciated by many Grass-types. These include Celebi, Roserade, Dhelmise, and Vileplume, all of which can check Ground- and Water-types such as Flygon, Gastrodon, Sharpedo, and Suicune. The latter three also provide a resistance to Fighting, which can prove very useful against threats such as Cobalion. Incineroar really wants to keep its Heavy-Duty Boots; Galarian Weezing and Rocky Helmet Cobalion can work as Knock Off absorbers. Psychic-type teammates, such as Reuniclus and Gardevoir, appreciate Incineroar pivoting into dangerous Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Mimikyu. Incineroar's ability to weaken foes with Parting Shot is appreciated by frailer offensive teammates, such as Xurkitree, Gardevoir, and Golurk, and gives setup opportunities to sweepers such as Cloyster, Barbaracle, Lucario, and Raikou.</p>"

Tsareena's vulnerability to Toxic and difficulty to fit Synthesis make it unable to naturally switch into Electric- and Water-types like Raikou, Xurkitree, and Gastrodon unlike other Grass-types such as Roserade, Vileplume, and Celebi.

Furthermore, most teams do not rely on their Water-types to defeat Mimikyu, so using Wood Hammer may ultimately be a fruitless endeavor. Lum Berry can be used to prevent Mimikyu from getting burned or badly poisoned by Suicune and Milotic, protecting it from having its sweep halted and allowing it to stay on the field longer. Red Card is an option to forcefully make setup sweepers such as Flygon exit the field. Thanks to Disguise, Mimikyu can also guarantee that it can set up Trick Room once. However, it should be noted that this is an inconsistent and niche playstyle, and Mimikyu doesn't have many tools to bring teammates in safely.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Mimikyu's best answer, Steelix, is able to come in on Mimikyu that do does not run Drain Punch and force it out. However, Drain Punch Mimikyu is able to prevent Steelix from countering it after Steelix has taken a little chip damage. Registeel, Escavalier, and Foul Play Klefki also check Mimikyu due to either their immense bulk or their neutrality to Drain Punch. Klefki that do does not run Foul Play can still take on Mimikyu, as it can paralyze Mimikyu with Thunder Wave and chip it between Dazzling Gleam and Rocky Helmet. Stakataka is also a notable mention, as it outright counters non-Drain Punch Mimikyu.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Once Disguise is broken, Crobat, Flygon, and other foes that survive +2 Shadow Sneak are able to revenge kill Mimikyu. Foes with pivot moves are especially notable, as Pokemon like the aforementioned Crobat as well as Raikou can pivot into Mimikyu and it.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Milotic, Suicune, and Tentacruel are all able to take Mimikyu's attacks and threaten to burn it with Scald. Milotic in particular is a great answer because it can wipe away Mimikyu's boosts with Haze and heal itself with Recover.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Galarian Weezing can thwart Mimikyu by burning it with Will-O-Wisp, while Rhyperior can simply damage it with Earthquake.

  "Xurkitree": {
    "overview": "<p>Of RU's three best Electric-types, Xurkitree, Raikou, and Toxtricity, Xurkitree is commonly considered the most restrictive and consistently dangerous for one simple reason: Grass-type coverage. Its Heavy-Duty Boots set singlehandedly makes Gastrodon, a strong Raikou answer, insufficient for covering the metagame's Electric-types, and other Ground-types like Steelix and Flygon shaky at best. With Ground-types so hesitant to face Xurkitree, it's free to use Volt Switch on switch-ins like Grass-types and special walls, which are rife with weaknesses for teammates to exploit. It's at its strongest against bulkier cores, which often use slower, exploitable Pokemon like Togekiss and Water-types and which struggle to pressure it with passive damage thanks to its Heavy-Duty Boots. While its Speed and bulk aren't great against offensive teams, it can usually find at least one opportunity to threaten them as well, either by forcing a switch or taking a hit. Should its team call for it, it can use Choice Scarf for greater use against offense and potentially cleaning up with Beast Boost at the expense of threatening defensive cores. What generally holds Xurkitree back is its aforementioned bulk and Speed; it can't switch into many direct attacks, and it often has very little breathing room against offense, areas where Raikou beats it out. Its Choice Scarf set suffers from prediction reliance against Ground-types and failing to outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Heracross and Flygon, limiting its ability to revenge kill and clean up. If you're looking for raw attacking power, you might prefer Toxtricity, whose Boomburst is easier to spam and much stronger than any of Xurkitree's individual attacks.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Endure + Salac Berry has merit on Sticky Web teams, giving Xurkitree the simultaneous benefits of heightened Speed and attack freedom while blocking First Impression and outpacing Choice Scarf users not named Flygon. If you build around Indeedee-M, its Psychic Surge lets Xurkitree run Nature Power to OHKO Roserade, Vileplume, and Nidoqueen.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Roserade, Celebi, Vileplume, and Dhelmise are popular alongside Ground-types to minimize the damage Xurkitree can do, given their Electric resistance and neutrality-at-worst to its coverage. They're vulnerable to Volt Switch, though, so Xurkitree's team will often stay at an advantage, and Vileplume's and Dhelmise's lower Speed means Xurkitree doesn't even need to predict them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Bulky Pokemon like Diancie, Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Porygon2, and Umbreon stand up well to Xurkitree's unboosted attacks but are total Volt Switch fodder. They need Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree statused or itemless to win a battle of attrition.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Steelix's Grass neutrality makes it the best Ground-type Xurkitree switch-in, though it quickly loses to repeated Grass Knot or Energy Ball. Flygon can take Dazzling Gleam once with the right EVs. Other Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Golurk usually switch out when Xurkitree appears in fear of Grass-type moves but can punish overeager uses of Volt Switch. Any Ground-type is a serious problem for Choice Scarf Xurkitree, creating a cost for locking into Electric-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: With resistance to Electric and neutrality to Grass and Fairy, other Electric-types like Raikou, Toxtricity, and Xurkitree itself make for decent early-game switch-ins to Xurkitree. Only Toxtricity threatens much damage back, however, and none of them are eager to keep losing HP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Offensive teams featuring a lot of fast Pokemon give Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree few easy entry points and seldom lose more than one Pokemon to it. Faster Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Heracross can revenge kill weakened Choice Scarf Xurkitree. The same goes for strong priority from the likes of Golisopod and Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak</strong>: Lighting Rod Alolan Marowak is unique in that it's immune to Electric and resistant to both Grass and Fairy, making it a major early-game obstacle to Xurkitree, but it's uncommon, very flawed, and fairly easy to wear down.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree uses its entry hazard immunity and great coverage to give bulky cores a hard time. Thunderbolt and Volt Switch are staple moves for an Electric-type pivot. A Grass-type move threatens Ground-types; Grass Knot also does the most damage to Steelix, Raikou, and other Xurkitree, while Energy Ball properly hurts the lightweight Diancie and always OHKOes Gastrodon. Dazzling Gleam covers Flygon and is Xurkitree's strongest option against certain Grass-types like Dhelmise and Celebi.</p> <p>Pivot Xurkitree is pretty good at its job by default, so it usually gets put on a proactive team later in the building process to support others and pressure Togekiss. Steel-, Flying-, and Fire-types such as Metagross, Noivern, and Salazzle like having Xurkitree use Volt Switch as Grass-types like Roserade and Celebi switch in, and Fighting- and Ground-types like Heracross and Flygon can take advantage of special walls such as Porygon2 and Registeel. Xurkitree is pretty slow and unwieldy against offense, so it should have at least a couple of fast teammates, some conventional examples including Noivern, Starmie, and Choice Scarf Flygon.</p>"

Given its focus on revenge killing and cleaning up, its teammates should include a wallbreaker or two like Flame Orb Heracross and Choice Band Metagross, which punish special walls and Grass-types. Water- and Grass-types like Milotic, Gastrodon, and Celebi can handle Ground-types when Xurkitree loses momentum to them. Roserade offensively checks them and sets Spikes, but it isn't a good Earthquake switch-in. Choice Scarf Xurkitree is still slower than other Choice Scarf users, so a priority user such as Golisopod or Bullet Punch Metagross will often be necessary on offensive teams using it.</p>"

  "Guzzlord": {
    "overview": "<p>Guzzlord is a solid Pokemon in RU, with its enormous bulk and defensive typing letting it check various common Pokemon like Celebi, Chandelure, Heliolisk, and Raikou. It's pretty good at taking even powerful special attacks, like Sludge Bomb from offensive Roserade and Ice Beam from Nidoqueen and wallbreaker Starmie. Knock Off has great utility, removing Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers from Pokemon like Milotic and Gastrodon. Offensive Guzzlord also has Heavy Slam, Earthquake, and Toxic for the Fairy-type, Steel-type, and bulky Pokemon that can take Knock Off. Guzzlord can also run a good RestTalk set that has better longevity and withstands Toxic users such as Raikou and Milotic. However, RestTalk Guzzlord is more passive, notably becoming setup bait for one of the tier's best Pokemon in Nasty Plot Togekiss. Guzzlord is destroyed by common Fighting-types such as Bewear, Heracross, and Lucario. Additionally, despite being Dark-type, it's potentially a liability against Psychic-type setup sweepers like Reuniclus, Cosmic Power Metagross, and Psycho Shift Sigilyph. All can take Knock Off, heal off the damage, and set up. RestTalk Guzzlord does beat Psycho Shift Sigilyph, but Metagross and Reuniclus can take advantage of a sleeping Guzzlord, as it'll need to get lucky with Sleep Talk rolling Dragon Tail to phaze them without taking significant damage.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Fire Blast is an option over Earthquake that puts more pressure on Steelix and defensive Roserade, and it 2HKOes Heracross. Guzzlord could function as a wallbreaker with Choice Band or Choice Specs that checks Grass- and Electric-types like Dhelmise and Heliolisk. However, as a wallbreaker it competes with Incineroar and Pangoro, which are stronger, get past Water-types more easily, and can take advantage of Umbreon with Swords Dance.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Lucario, Bewear, Heracross, and Pangoro can switch into and easily destroy Guzzlord. However, Lucario and Heracross dislike Earthquake and Heavy Slam, respectively, and all besides Lucario are crippled by Toxic—Lucario easily takes advantage of these variants. Sharpedo destroys a chipped Guzzlord with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off and Toxic</strong>: Knock Off and Toxic heavily cripple non-RestTalk Guzzlord because it lacks recovery outside of Leftovers. Salazzle and Seismitoad cripple Guzzlord with Knock Off and Toxic, and Milotic and Gastrodon cripple it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types and Fairy-type Coverage</strong>: Galarian Weezing and Klefki can take Guzzlord's attacks and threaten it with Fairy-type attacks, though they're 2HKOed by Heavy Slam and Earthquake, respectively. Gardevoir outpaces and OHKOes Guzzlord. Galarian Weezing, Klefki, and Togekiss cannot be phazed by Dragon Tail and wall RestTalk Guzzlord easily. Klefki and Togekiss can even set up Spikes or use Nasty Plot. Xurkitree's Dazzling Gleam OHKOes a slightly chipped Guzzlord.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Cloyster and Barbaracle take Guzzlord's attacks and set up Shell Smash; however, they dislike the combination of Toxic and Protect quickly wearing them down, and non-White Herb Barbaracle is left at low health after Earthquake. Guzzlord cannot break through Cosmic Power Metagross due to Defense boosts and Reuniclus due to its bulk, letting them set up. Sigilyph burns Guzzlord with Psycho Shift and Flame Orb, preventing Knock Off from outdamaging Roost, for easy setup. RestTalk Guzzlord counters Sigilyph and can temporarily check the other Psychic-type setup sweepers by phazing them, but it takes significant damage from all of their boosted attacks and cannot phaze them if they're the last Pokemon standing.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Noivern can switch into Guzzlord and thwart it with Draco Meteor, but it dislikes losing Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off and being hit by Dragon Tail. Flygon and Tyrantrum can use non-RestTalk Guzzlord to set up Dragon Dance, though Flygon being forced to use Outrage lets Guzzlord's teammates check it.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Heavy Slam 2HKOes Fairy-types like Togekiss and Galarian Weezing. Earthquake is Guzzlord's best option against Steel-types like Steelix and Registeel after they've taken Knock Off, and it keeps Lucario from setting up freely. On the other hand, Toxic cripples bulky Pokemon like Milotic, Gastrodon, and Incineroar. Protect scouts against Choice-locked Pokemon like Gardevoir, Flygon, and Pangoro, lets Guzzlord safely heal with Leftovers, and racks up damage if running Toxic. Dragon Tail could be run in the third moveslot to rack up entry hazard damage and soft check setup sweepers like Reuniclus and Nasty Plot Crobat. Earthquake and Toxic can be run together without Heavy Slam on teams adequate against Nasty Plot Togekiss. Because Guzzlord's HP stat is so naturally high, investing EVs in its defenses is far more efficient. 152 Defense EVs let Guzzlord survive Mimikyu's +2 Drain Punch with Stealth Rock, the Special Defense helps with Heliolisk, Nidoqueen, and Life Orb Sigilyph, and the other EVs are thrown into Attack, importantly being more than enough to OHKO Chandelure.</p> <p>Guzzlord pairs well with entry hazard setters like Roserade, Heavy-Duty Boots Heracross, and Steelix, since Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Gastrodon and Noivern. Checks to Fighting-types like Lucario, Bewear, and Heracross are critical; Togekiss and Galarian Weezing check Pangoro and Heracross, Crobat checks Heracross and revenge kills Lucario, Noivern effectively revenge kills all the Fighting-types, and Chandelure and Jellicent check Bewear and Lucario. Haze Milotic can check the setup sweepers that beat Guzzlord, like Psycho Shift Sigilyph, Cosmic Power Metagross, and Reuniclus. Electric-types like Raikou and Xurkitree also cover Sigilyph. Golurk and Chandelure check Reuniclus and Metagross. Nidoqueen, Roserade, and Salazzle take advantage of Galarian Weezing for Guzzlord. Klefki can be handled with Ground-types like Seismitoad and Steelix, or Rapid Spin Starmie. Steel-types like Registeel and Steelix switch into Gardevoir; Steelix is especially good because it also checks Xurkitree well, which can threaten Guzzlord with Dazzling Gleam.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Rest helps remedy Guzzlord's lack of recovery and lets it deal with Toxic users like Raikou and Milotic, while Sleep Talk reduces the passiveness of Rest. Guzzlord's extremely high HP stat means that investing EVs in its defenses is more effective. Special Defense investment is prioritized because Guzzlord is good against special attackers like Sigilyph and Nidoqueen that are difficult to check otherwise, but the Defense EVs still make Guzzlord notably more resilient against physical attackers like Crobat and Metagross. The Attack EVs are enough to OHKO Sigilyph and then further optimize the stat slightly. Heavy Slam could be run over Dragon Tail on teams that need to prevent Togekiss from setting up freely.</p> <p>Spikes and Stealth Rock users like Steelix, Roserade, Registeel, and Golisopod pair well with Guzzlord, since it uses Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Dragon Tail to accrue entry hazard damage. Electric- and Steel-types like Raikou, Stakataka, and Registeel are important to cover Togekiss. Steelix is a particularly notable teammate, because it also checks Xurkitree well, which threatens Guzzlord via Dazzling Gleam. Spikes Klefki and Galarian Weezing are other troublesome Fairy-types. Klefki can be checked by Pokemon like Incineroar and Dhelmise, while Nidoqueen, Roserade, and Chandelure can check Galarian Weezing. Covering Fighting-types is critical for Guzzlord. Togekiss and Galarian Weezing check Heracross and Pangoro, while Crobat switches into only Heracross but revenge kills Lucario. Jellicent and Chandelure cover Lucario, and Jellicent can also soft check Heracross.</p>"

It functions primarily as a Stealth Rock user for bulky offensive and balanced teams. Stakataka's main advantage over its Stealth Rock-setting competition in Metagross, Registeel, and Bronzong is its typing. Its combination of Fire neutrality and Flying, Fairy, and Psychic resistances means it checks many common threats utilizing Fire-type coverage like Togekiss and Noivern in addition to Chandelure. Unfortunately, since Stakataka's the slowest Pokemon in the tier, it's usually getting hit first and worn down easily, and it is forced to make predictions even when other defensive Pokemon are switching in. Its 4x Ground and Fighting weaknesses mean it finds itself offensively pressured a lot.</p>",
    "comments": "<h3>Other Options</h3> <p>Choice Band can be used to punch holes in opposing teams and catch the opponent off guard. However, due to Stakataka's slow Speed and Choice lock, it can easily be set up on. Shuca Berry or Chople Berry on the defensive set allows Stakataka to tank an attack from threats like Flygon and Metagross or Heracross and Mimikyu. Unfortunately, Stakataka sorely misses passive recovery, and taking a super effective attack will likely leave it with little HP remaining anyway. An offensive Trick Room set can work as a cleaner, although there are better sweepers that don't have to rely on Trick Room.</p> <h3>Checks and Counters</h3> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage</strong>: Due to Stakataka's 4x weakness to Fighting, threats like Heracross, Pangoro, and Lucario are just a few Pokemon that send it running. None of them want to switch into it, however. Body Press Registeel and Aura Sphere Raikou are just a couple of threats with coverage to also exploit this weakness.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types and Ground-type Coverage</strong>: Pokemon like Golurk, Nidoqueen, and Gastrodon have little to fear from Stakataka and force it out. Metagross, Aerodactyl, and even opposing Stakataka are just a few Pokemon that carry Earthquake as a coverage move and can severely hurt Stakataka.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Milotic, Suicune, and Gastrodon can come in safely on Stakataka and heal any damage, although they have to be wary of switching into Toxic.</p>",

    "overview": "<p>Choice Specs Toxtricity is one of RU's strongest sources of immediate damage thanks to its Punk Rock-boosted Boomburst, which has very few consistent switch-ins. Pokemon with the typing or special bulk to take Boomburst, like Stakataka and Porygon2, are vulnerable to Toxtricity's coverage or lose momentum to Volt Switch. Though slow, Toxtricity poses a massive early-game threat to offensive teams, as staples like Noivern cannot immediately OHKO it and fear getting OHKOed in return. Its resistances let it even switch into and punish Crobat, Roserade, and Raikou once or twice, especially if they go for utility moves. Once Toxtricity has taken some damage, however, it becomes much less of a threat, as its low Speed and bulk will make it easy for many Pokemon to pick off. Its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and Spikes worsens this issue, especially in a metagame full of pivots using Heavy-Duty Boots, which incentivizes conventional offensive teams to forgo entry hazard removal. It faces competition from RU's more reliable Electric-types, such as Xurkitree, Heliolisk, and Raikou; the former can use Choice Scarf to similarly threaten offense or Heavy-Duty Boots to wallbreak like Toxtricity without fearing entry hazards, while the latter two's naturally high Speed stats lets them remain a threat to offense all game long. The other Electric-types are always faster than offensive Togekiss, which can overcome weakened Toxtricity with Air Slash flinches.</p>",

Toxtricity's unremarkable bulk means this won't take long. Most aggressive teams will also give Toxtricity very few opportunities to directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: The presence of a Ghost-type forces Toxtricity to think twice about spamming Boomburst, limiting how much damage it can get out of its attack opportunities. Golurk and Lightning Rod Alolan Marowak are even immune to Electric, meaning Toxtricity has to risk using the generally mediocre Snarl or Sludge Bomb. Colbur Berry Dhelmise can take a hit from Toxtricity pretty well. Ghost-types generally work well with Ground-types by maximizing the number of predictions Toxtricity has to make.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Snorlax and Registeel can stand up to Toxtricity's attacks for a while, though they lose momentum to Volt Switch and are easily pressured.

Shadow Ball can be used for a stronger hit against Assault Vest Reuniclus, while maintaining coverage against Metagross and Bronzong, but in turn misses out certain Steel-types like Registeel and Klefki. Hyper Voice is an alternative STAB move that gives Indeedee-M a more reliable move to lock into if Dark-types like Incineroar or Pangoro are present, notably being Indeedee-M's strongest option against the former. Trick can cripple special walls like Umbreon and Registeel to make it even easier for Indeedee-M's team to deal with them, but losing its Choice Specs makes Indeedee-M much less effective at breaking down defensive cores. Dazzling Gleam OHKOes Guzzlord and can 2HKO Umbreon after some prior damage.</p> <p>Indeedee-M appreciates teammates that can handle extremely bulky Psychic-type answers, particularly Umbreon and Registeel. Fighting-types such as Lucario and Heracross can handle these threats and clean up late-game once Indeedee-M has broken down an opponent's defensive core. Spikes support from Roserade and Klefki is also appreciated, as it can allow Indeedee-M to push past Umbreon on its own with Dazzling Gleam while also exploiting Registeel's lack of reliable recovery on repeated switch-ins. Faster threats, such as Crobat, Choice Scarf Xurkitreee, and Choice Scarf Heracross have problems switching in but can easily revenge kill Indeedee-M. Pokemon like Metagross and Nidoqueen can check these threats and set Stealth Rock. Sharpedo and Cloyster are powerful late-game cleaners that benefit from Psychic Terrain protecting them from dangerous priority moves. Pokemon such as Milotic and Flygon can utilize pivot moves to effectively switch in Indeedee-M on favorable matchups.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Indeedee-M's good Speed and Psychic Surge-boosted Expanding Force allows it to revenge kill numerous RU staples, such as Noivern, Raikou, and Crobat, with a Choice Scarf equipped. Mystical Fire 2HKOes bulkless Metagross and can make it easier for teammates to switch into Psychic-resistant Pokemon, such as Reuniclus. Hyper Voice hits Incineroar the hardest and does more to Psychic-types like Gardevoir and Starmie. Trick is essential for crippling special walls like Registeel, Umbreon, and Porygon2.</p> <p>Indeedee-M has a very hard time with special walls, particularly Umbreon, Registeel, and Porygon2. This makes Pangoro, Lucario, and Heracross great teammates, as they can easily remove these special walls and weaken most defensive Pokemon in general with their powerful attacks. Flygon is a  troublesome faster Choice Scarf user that can revenge kill Indeedee-M, thus making Togekiss and Vileplume good teammate options. Togekiss can utilize a Nasty Plot set to weaken or outright remove Steel-types for Indeedee-M, while Vileplume can potentially punish U-turns with Effect Spore. Spikes from Roserade and Klefki is also appreciated, as all of the special walls Indeedee-M struggles with are vulnerable to the entry hazard. Late-game cleaners, such as Sharpedo and Cloyster, that appreciate Psychic Terrain protecting them from opposing priority moves are good choices to use with Indeedee-M as well.</p>"

      "Hail Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Slush Rush Arctovish uses its Fishious Rend and boosted Speed to plow through defensive and offensive threats alike. Fishious Rend's incredible power puts immense pressure on any Pokemon that does not resist it, OHKOing frailer Pokemon such as Raikou and 2HKOing bulkier Pokemon such as Registeel and Galarian Weezing. Freeze-Dry hits Water-types, OHKOing Gastrodon after Stealth Rock and Seismitoad from full health, 2HKOing Jellicent after some chip damage, and activating Golisopod's Emergency Exit. Icicle Crash 2HKOes Grass-types such as Celebi and Vileplume, as well as OHKOing Roserade. Substitute allows Arctovish to take advantage of forced switches and allows for easier prediction. Protect is an option to beat First Impression Golisopod and scout faster Choice-locked Pokemon such as Gardevoir and Flygon. The given EV spread allows Arctovish to OHKO Gastrodon and Seismitoad with Freeze-Dry after Stealth Rock and outspeed up to Choice Scarf Rotom-C under hail. A Choice Band set is a fine alternative, dishing out immense power with Fishious Rend. However, its inability to OHKO Seismitoad and Gastrodon and the availability of Water-immune Pokemon make it significantly more prediction reliant.</p> <p>Slush Rush Arctovish requires a hail-setting teammate. Vanilluxe can wallbreak independently and thus is best suited to semi-hail, while dedicated hail teams use a combination of Abomasnow and Aurorus to support its sweepers. Alolan Sandslash synergizes with Arctovish, as one can weaken or beat their checks to open the other up for a sweep. Because Arctovish is weak to Stealth Rock, it appreciates entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Xatu, Dhelmise, Starmie, Crobat, and Flygon. Flygon can check the Fire-type Pokemon such as Chandelure that threaten hail teams and bring Arctovish in safely with U-turn. Similarly, Starmie can pivot into Water-types and Teleport out while keeping hazard setters like Registeel, Bronzong, and Steelix at bay. Because Gardevoir can copy Slush Rush with Trace and counter-sweep hail teams, sturdy answers such as Metagross and Registeel are required on semi-hail. Because Arctovish is unable to break through some bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, Grass- and Electric-type teammates are important. On semi-hail, Pokemon like Roserade, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Calm Mind Raikou are highly valuable. Roserade can support Arctovish with Spikes, while Raikou and Celebi pair very well with Arctovish offensively. On full hail, Pokemon like Toxicroak or Heliolisk can deal with Water-types. Lastly, checks to Steel-types like Registeel and Cosmic Power Metagross are important, so Pokemon like Xatu and Doublade are good choices.</p>"

      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Regidrago is a solid late-game sweeper once key roadblocks are removed. Regidrago's average-to-good bulk and Dragon typing lend it many setup opportunities against bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, but also against passive walls like Registeel. However, even after a boost, Regidrago is slower than every common Choice Scarf user. The Speed raise from Scale Shot can prevent Choice Scarf users from revenge killing Regidrago after setup, but it's inconsistent due to its variability in power. After a Dragon Dance, Thunder Fang 2HKOes even bulky Togekiss. Substitute helps Regidrago set up by blocking Scald burns and Toxic. The passive recovery from Leftovers means Regidrago can use Substitute many more times throughout a battle. An Adamant nature is preferable to ensure the 2HKO on Togekiss with Thunder Fang after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Try as it might, Regidrago can't break through Steelix, Galarian Weezing, Diancie, and Stakataka. Luckily, wallbreakers like Starmie and Golurk can pick up the slack and blow past each one with relative ease. Fighting-types such as Guts Heracross, Bewear, and Pangoro can also overwhelm Diancie and Galarian Weezing while breaking Steelix and Stakataka. Crobat, Flygon, and Incineroar can safely switch Regidrago into the battlefield with U-turn. Flygon and Incineroar synergize particularly well with Regidrago, as they can bring it in against bulky Water-types for a setup opportunity. Disguised as Regidrago, Zoroark can lure Galarian Weezing, Sylveon, Steelix, and Doublade with coverage moves in Extrasensory, Sludge Bomb, and Flamethrower. Dragon Dance Regidrago fits well on dual screens hyper offense teams, as it can get multiple boosts with ease thanks to its titanic bulk under dual screens. One notable Pokemon commonly seen on dual screens hyper offense is Cloyster; after a Shell Smash, it can OHKO Galarian Weezing with Hydro Pump and can wear down Steel-types. Other hyper offense staples like Sharpedo and Mimikyu can also help with breaking bulky Steel-types.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragon's Maw-boosted Outrage is a sight to behold, but in a tier infested with Fairy- and Steel-types, Regidrago finds its effectiveness limited. Nevertheless, with good team support, Regidrago is a force to be reckoned with. Scale Shot is decently strong and doesn't lock Regidrago in like Outrage does. The Speed raise also makes it harder to revenge kill with faster threats like Noivern and Starmie. Hammer Arm is Regidrago's best move to hit Diancie as well as Steel-types such as Steelix and Registeel. Thunder Fang is a near-guaranteed 2HKO on max HP Togekiss. Explosion is an alternative over either Outrage or Scale Shot, as it opens the door for Regidrago's teammates by either severely weakening or outright KOing Togekiss, Grimmsnarl, or Galarian Weezing. Crunch is also an option to hit Doublade and 2HKO Metagross and Bronzong but has no other relevant targets.</p> <p>Regidrago can do next to nothing against Sylveon, Galarian Weezing, and Doublade. Toxtricity is noteworthy for dealing with the mentioned Pokemon and weakening Steelix, which repeatedly switches in on Regidrago otherwise. Fighting- and Dark-types like Heracross and Sharpedo can pair with Regidrago to overwhelm shared checks, such as Fairy-types. Regidrago can also lure and severely weaken Fairy-types with Explosion so its Fighting- and Dark-type teammate can clean up afterward. Zoroark can disguise itself as Regidrago with Illusion to lure and surprise Fairy-types with a super effective Sludge Bomb. Pivots like Raikou, Milotic, and Flygon are excellent for safely bringing Regidrago onto the field. Flygon and Fire-types like Entei and Incineroar are grateful for Regidrago breaking bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Gastrodon. Spikes support from Roserade and Klefki helps whittle down sturdy Steel-types like Steelix, Metagross, and Doublade.</p>"
