        "description": "<p>Charizard makes its name as one of the premier wallbreakers on sun teams with its ability to carve through most of the metagame with its obscene power, although Charizard is only as good as sun teams are, which can be an inconsistent team style at times. Charizard remains a solid pick for sun teams despite facing competition from Solar Power Heliolisk, which has a higher Speed tier and better defensive typing that grants a Ghost immunity and Flying resistance, as a wallbreaker. Solar Beam makes it so bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Milotic, as well as bulky Rock-types such as Diancie, cannot wall Charizard safely in sun. Scorching Sands hits Fire-types such as Volcanion, Chandelure, and Incineroar, as well as Dragalge, which could give its team grievances. Fire Blast provides a strong Fire-type STAB attack outside of sun, while Roost lets Charizard heal against Grass-types such as Vileplume and Roserade and Pokemon attempting to stall out sun turns with Protect, such as Umbreon, Suicune, and Chandelure. Heavy-Duty Boots improves Charizard's longevity, although Choice Specs is an option to increase its wallbreaking capabilities and secure KOs, such as OHKOing defensive Togekiss, at the cost of being less consistent due to the crippling Stealth Rock weakness and being Choice-locked.</p> <p>Charizard is only seen on sun teams, so its partners should reflect this. Torkoal sets sun and empowers Charizard, Chlorophyll sweepers such as Shitry can capitalize on Charizard's wallbreaking and ability to handle Togekiss and opposing Fire-types, and wallbreakers such as Darmanitan and Entei provide additional offensive pressure as well as pivot support and strong priority. Xatu makes a solid partner for Charizard thanks to its ability to block entry hazards with Magic Bounce with Teleport, for Charizard to take advantage of should especially if it opts to run Choice Specs. Klefki makes an excellent manual sun setter and provides Spikes to wear down bulky Water-types. Other partners include Choice Scarf Flygon, which can safely bring in Charizard with U-turn and provide a valuable Rock resistance, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, which provides Healing Wish and can cripple Pokemon like Snorlax with Trick or bring Charizard in safely with Teleport.</p> "

Unfortunately, Vileplume can get worn down quickly and is often forced to use its recovery to remain healthy, which gives openings to Pokemon it invites in like Toxtricity and common Flying-types such as Noivern and Crobat. Strength Sap is Vileplume’s main recovery move and allows it to lower the Attack stat of an opposing physical attacker. Corrosive Gas is used to remove important items such as Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Choice items from Pokemon such as Cobalion, Crobat, and Toxtricity. Alternatively, Sleep Powder can be used to put common switch-ins such as Crobat and Noivern to sleep, generating free turns for itself and its teammates. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 SpD can be used to avoid a 4HKO from Xurkitree's Thunderbolt. Vileplume is best suited for balance teams that need a check for prominent physical attackers such as Zarude and Mienshao. Due to Vileplume's weakness to Fire-types, bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can be great teammates. In return, Vileplume can handle offensive Electric-types such as Xurkitree and Raikou. Since Vileplume often invites in Flying-types like Crobat and Tornadus, checks to these Pokemon such as Xurkitree and Raikou are good partners. Registeel and Steelix also make great teammates for Vileplume, since they are able to check offensive Psychic-types such as Gardevoir and Necrozma. Since Vileplume often switches into pivots, taking damage from entry hazards can quickly wear it down and limit its defensive capabilities, so entry hazard removal from Togekiss or Crobat is important.</p> "

It also takes advantage of teams relying on Seismitoad and Gastrodon as their bulky Water-type, as neither is a suitable Cloyster check. Rock Blast hits Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune neutrally, helping Cloyster beat them with flinches. It also hits Volcanion and can be used against other Fire-types like Incineroar and Chandelure. Hydro Pump is the preferred last move due to its greater damage against Steel-types such as Metagross, Cobalion, and Steelix. Liquidation can be used instead to OHKO Diancie and potentially 2HKO Registeel after Spikes damage while also giving Cloyster a more reliable Water-type STAB move. However, it makes Cloyster more reliant on breaking past the aforementioned Steel-types with flinches. King's Rock gives Cloyster's Icicle Spear and Rock Blast an effective 41% flinch chance. A Naive or Jolly nature should be used, as they allow +2 Cloyster to outrun Choice Scarf Mienshao. Explosion can be used to take down Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune for a teammate. Focus Sash can be used to almost guarantee setup, but this requires solid entry hazard removal, and Cloyster loses out on the ability to break past its checks with flinches. Life Orb is another item option that allows Cloyster to KO notable threats such as Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, Metagross, and Doublade at +2 without prior residual damage. Spikes allows Cloyster, which beats most Defoggers, to give value to its team in a matchup where it doesn't do much else. However, Spikes also forces Cloyster to ditch its Water-type STAB moves, which worsens its matchup against Steel-types significantly.</p> <p>Cloyster's natural physical bulk is impressive even without investment and gives it some notable setup opportunities against Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Crobat lacking Taunt, and Mimikyu. Cloyster is potentially capable of breaking past its defensive answers with flinches, but this requires a fair bit of luck. Bulky Water- and Steel-types can halt Cloyster barring an ill-timed flinch, so efforts should be put into wearing these Pokemon down. Most of the tier's bulky Steel-types will get worn down by Spikes; offensive Metagross, Cobalion, and Doublade will be in KO range of +2 Hydro Pump after switching in with three layers of Spikes, while Liquidation variants will be able to reliably 2HKO Registeel after two layers. Therefore, Spikes setters like Klefki and Roserade are good teammates. Cloyster's ability to take advantage of Spikes and cause its targets to flinch makes it a great choice for hyper offense teams, as it can be a devastating wincon or a supportive wallbreaker for another sweeping teammate such as Necrozma, Mimikyu, or Polteageist. Cloyster is also capable of sweeping on standard offensive and bulky offensive teams. Teams utilizing Cloyster in this regard should attempt to wear down bulky Water- and Steel-types. Knock Off from the likes of Incineroar, Reuniclus, and Obstagoon can remove Leftovers from Pokemon like Registeel and Suicune, making it easier for Cloyster to break through them. Pivoting teammates, such as Mienshao, Incineroar, and Crobat, can get Cloyster into battle safely. Toxic from Diancie and Salazzle can help wear down Water-types to let Cloyster go wild late-game.</p> "

Body Slam inflicts paralysis, making it easier for Snorlax to get boosts from Curse while helping its teammates by slowing down faster threats. Earthquake provides great coverage against Normal-resistant and -immune Pokemon like Cobalion and Alolan Marowak. Rest is Snorlax's main recovery move while also being able to remove status effects. Thick Fat enables Snorlax to reliably switch into Fire-types like Chandelure and Volcanion. 12 HP EVs slightly increase recovery from Leftovers. Snorlax can opt for a spread of 12 HP / 116 Atk / 204 Def / 176 SpD to OHKO Cobalion with Earthquake after a Curse and a Defense drop from Close Combat and evade a 3HKO from Xurkitree's Thunderbolt and Volcanion's Steam Eruption. Alternatively, Snorlax can use a spread of 184 HP / 72 Def / 252 SpD to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Toxtricity's Boomburst after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Snorlax usually prefers to be on balanced and bulky offensive teams due to it checking major wallbreakers like Chandelure and its sweeping potential. Snorlax's weakness to Fighting-type attacks means it appreciates having Fairy-types teammates like Galarian Weezing, Gardevoir, and Togekiss. Galarian Weezing is particularly useful for switching into Guts Heracross, which can threaten to OHKO Snorlax even after a Curse. Cleric support from the likes of Sylveon and Umbreon is very helpful if Snorlax is forced out after using Rest. Snorlax enjoys having Toxic Spikes support from Dragalge and Galarian Weezing since it can pressure bulky Waters-types like Haze Milotic. Knock Off users like Incineroar and Obstagoon make great teammates because they are able to remove valuable items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers, making it easier for Snorlax to beat its checks such as Haze Milotic and Rhyperior. Snorlax likes to have Dark-type Pokemon such as Zarude and Drapion as teammates since they are able to check Ghost-types like Mimikyu and Doublade.</p> "

Crobat also has the potential to run stallbreaking sets that can bypass Pokemon like Cobalion, Milotic, and Sylveon. Crobat depends upon Heavy-Duty Boots for most of its defensive utility and is vulnerable to Knock Off from Golisopod and Heracross.

However, outside of setting rain, Politoed is a generally underwhelming Pokemon that can’t provide much help to rain teams itself and often becomes a momentum sink due to its passiveness. Encore allows it to deal with bulkier threats that would wall it otherwise and discourage Pokemon from setting up on it. Toxic can break down walls in tandem with Encore, particularly bulky Water-types that pose a threat to rain teams like Milotic. Hypnosis trades some effectiveness against passive builds for the potential to shut down common roadblocks to rain teams like Gastrodon and Assault Vest Reuniclus, and maintain utility against more offensive teams looking to take advantage of Politoed’s passivity. Ice Beam chips Grass-types like Celebi, 3HKOes Dragalge, and OHKOes Noivern with the Special Attack investment. Perish Song forces bulky setup sweepers out, allowing Politoed to check Pokemon like Suicune, Snorlax, and Reuniclus. Finally, Rest allows Politoed to continue setting rain when severely weakened and in long matches against passive teams. Non-Ice Beam variants can invest the 76 Special Attack EVs into Defense, as they do nothing significant with Scald. 56 Speed EVs let Politoed outrun Alolan Marowak, but 92 Speed EVs can be ran for Milotic, which Encore + Toxic variants can beat.</p> <p>Politoed’s only niche is setting rain, so Pokemon that take advantage of it are necessary.

Electric-types of your own like Raikou and Heliolisk are able to run Thunder and Weather Ball as coverage and check Electric- or Water-types. Tornadus also enjoys fully accurate Hurricane and Weather Ball coverage. Toxicroak appreciates the Dry Skin recovery and can switch into Milotic with impunity. Steel-types like Metagross and Steelix can provide good defensive utility for rain teams and appreciate Fire-type moves being weakened under rain. Finally, entry hazard setters such as Klefki and Roserade can help pressure bulkier cores that threaten rain such as Suicune + Assault Vest Reuniclus, as well as synergizing with the surprising amount of switches Politoed can force from defensive Pokemon.</p> "

However, many teams prefer the specially defensive variant, since it counters more important Pokemon. 180 EVs can be invested into Speed to outspeed Adamant Golurk.

Togekiss can even provide Defog and Heal Bell support, while Galarian Weezing can handle most Knock Off users. Powerful physical attackers such as Heracross, Darmanitan, Alolan Marowak, and Swords Dance Cobalion can take advantage of Porygon2's inability to generally threaten them. The aforementioned Togekiss and Galarian Weezing fare well against Heracross, while Suicune and Milotic can take on Darmanitan and Alolan Marowak. Healthy Noivern can switch directly into Cobalion and any Noivern can outspeed Heracross and Alolan-Marowak should Porygon2 predict their switch in with Teleport.</p> "

  "Raikou": {
    "overview": "<p>Raikou is a premier offensive pivot thanks to its high Speed forcing out other offensive staples like Cobalion, which gives it a clear advantage over fellow Electric-types Xurkitree and Toxtricity. Heavy-Duty Boots makes it difficult to wear down passively, letting it use Volt Switch with great freedom, and its useful coverage across Shadow Ball, Extrasensory, and Scald keeps many Pokemon from confidently switching into it. It can put that coverage to even greater use with its Calm Mind wallbreaking set. Its biggest problem is its glaring inability to hit Gastrodon and Flygon very hard; the best it can do is use Toxic or try to burn Flygon with Scald, so they hold it off well early-game. Its attacks are generally a bit weak, so it often relies on teammates to actually break through bulky Pokemon like Registeel and Assault Vest Reuniclus, and its defensive typing isn't good for much beyond switching into Togekiss and Xurkitree; this means it's hesitant to take strong attacks. The Calm Mind set sacrifices Volt Switch, making it a worse team player and harder to fit, and Xurkitree and Toxtricity are much better than pivot Raikou at breaking through cores by themselves.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind punishes passive defensive cores but lacks room for coverage. Aura Sphere on pivot Raikou puts the most pressure on Steel-types like Stakataka and Registeel; their low Speed and Volt Switch vulnerability make this less important on average. Weather Ball makes Raikou a much bigger threat on weather teams; hail gives it the excellent combination of Electric and Ice, rain gives it stronger Water-type coverage, and sun lets it hit Steel- and Grass-types with a single move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Certain Ground-types: Ground-types that aren't weak to Scald are the safest early-game switch-ins to Raikou. Gastrodon has Recover and Storm Drain, making it near insurmountable for Raikou even when badly poisoned. Quagsire also has Recover while handling coverage moves well, and Choice Scarf Flygon can immediately force Raikou out but fears Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Pokemon with a lot of special bulk, including Assault Vest Reuniclus, Registeel, Snorlax, and Umbreon, can take Raikou's attacks for a long time and immediately hinder it in return with Toxic or a strong attack. Pivot Raikou can just use Volt Switch the turn after they switch in, though.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: If Raikou lacks Extrasensory, Roserade, and Vileplume are good switch-ins to it, and if it lacks Shadow Ball, Celebi, Dhelmise, and Decidueye handle its attacks well. Decidueye and Dhelmise want to avoid Scald burns, however.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Raikou's average bulk and lack of resistances make it easy for most faster Pokemon to take out once weakened. Physical Choice Scarf users such as Flygon and Heracross deal massive damage. Noivern and Salazzle are faster but struggle against Calm Mind boosts. Golisopod's First Impression also does the trick.</p> ",

    "overview": "<p>Choice Band Entei is a solid wallbreaker that punishes conventional Fire-type answers such as Flygon, Diancie, and Suicune with a burn from Sacred Fire. Furthermore, Entei can act as a revenge killer with Extreme Speed, letting it pick off many dangerous sweepers like Cloyster, Flygon, and Sharpedo. Entei also has a great Speed tier for a wallbreaker and outspeeds key offensive threats such as Mimikyu, Obstagoon, and Xurkitree. The team compression provided by being both a wallbreaker and revenge killer, as well as sporting great natural bulk and a key Speed tier, makes it particularly sought after on sun teams. Under sun, Entei's counterplay dwindles, as once hard stops like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Snorlax have a high chance of getting 2HKOed by sun-boosted Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock and burn. However, Entei's Stealth Rock weakness severely limits it, especially on sun teams, which generally lacks thorough entry hazard removal. Outside of sun teams, Entei faces far harsher competition from other wallbreakers, especially Darmanitan, which can afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots, is about as strong as Choice Band Entei, and can keep up momentum with U-turn.</p> ",

Flare Blitz is much stronger than Sacred Fire and is a must on sun teams, as it has a good chance to 2HKO a burned Gastrodon or Quagsire after Stealth Rock in the sun. On non-sun teams, Iron Head is a viable option to OHKO Diancie; while it despises a burn from Sacred Fire, Diancie can easily switch into Entei and set Stealth Rock. Toxic is also an option to cripple bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Suicune, but with Sacred Fire's 50% burn rate, it can become useless if not played carefully. Inner Focus blocks Intimidate from Incineroar, so it can't switch into Entei's Fire-type attacks in sun.</p> <p>The playstyle that takes full advantage of Entei's strengths and plays to its full potential are sun teams.

Entei lures bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Milotic and forces them to use Recover, which can be exploited by Shiftry to get an opportunity to use Growth or a huge hit off. Choice Scarf Gardevoir provides Healing Wish support to heal up Entei after taking many rounds of Stealth Rock damage or attacks from the likes of Togekiss, Mimikyu, and Crobat. On non-sun teams, Entei needs more support to break past bulky Water-types. Assault Vest Reuniclus's Future Sight and lures to Water-types like mixed Metagross and offensive Starmie are effective ways of weakening or getting rid of Gastrodon and Milotic.

Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Crobat, Flygon, and Starmie give Entei as many opportunities to wallbreak as possible.

Calm Mind makes it very hard for special attackers to break Suicune's Substitute and makes Scald much harder to switch into. Substitute provides Suicune with a way to protect itself from status effects, which will cripple sets lacking Rest, and is especially effective for PP stalling Pokemon unable to break its substitute in one hit. Note that Suicune must still be cautious not to switch into status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave from the likes of Registeel, Togekiss, and Klefki. Protect enables Suicune to scout Choice item users, stall out low PP moves, and gain additional Leftovers recovery. Ice Beam can be used to hit the likes of Zarude and Seismitoad after boosting, which are otherwise major threats. Roar is another option that allows Suicune to phaze out other setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. The EV spread allows Suicune to outpace base 80 Speed Pokemon like Chandelure and Togekiss, while giving it an 81% chance that Seismitoad's Earthquake will not break its Substitute. An alternative spread with maximum Speed will allow Suicune to Speed tie with Heracross, but lowers its chances of its Substitute surviving Seismitoad's Earthquake to about 56%. This set lacks recovery other than Leftovers, so Suicune must be careful not to take Knock Off from Pokemon like Incineroar and Obstagoon without a Substitute up. Suicune must also be careful not to get hit by Trick from the likes of Darmanitan and Gardevoir, as it completely cripples this set.</p> <p>Suicune's natural bulk and typing make it a great choice for teams looking to check threats like Darmanitan, Alolan Marowak, and Metagross. Suicune's best check is Zarude, which can use Jungle Healing to remove any Scald burns and threaten Suicune with Power Whip. Therefore, it pairs well with Zarude checks like Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, and Togekiss. Cobalion has the added bonus of being an excellent Knock Off absorber thanks to Justified, while Galarian Weezing and Togekiss check other threats to Suicune like certain Guts Fighting-types such as Machamp and Heracross. The aforementioned Guts users, along with Obstagoon, pose a notable threat to Suicune because they are powerful enough to threaten Suicune and unafraid of burns from Scald. Sylveon or Togekiss notably can provide Heal Bell support to remedy this set's weakness to status effects. Suicune is also threatened by Electric-types like Xurkitree, Toxtricity, and Raikou, so it should be used alongside Electric-type checks such as Roserade, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Zarude, and Vileplume. Finally, Suicune lacking Roar is unable to beat certain Calm Mind sweepers with Psyshock like Reuniclus and Sigilyph, so it is wise to pair it with checks to them like Obstagoon and Chandelure.</p> "

Trace is the preferred ability to grab useful abilities from opposing Pokemon, such as Regenerator from Mienshao, Punk Rock from Toxtricity, and Water Absorb Volcanion.</p> <p>Choice Specs Gardevoir's wallbreaking prowess can be taken advantage of by a myriad of Pokemon that thrive late-game. This includes Pokemon such as Xurkitree and Choice Scarf Heracross. The latter two are capable of bashing through Steel-types, which is a good trait considering Gardevoir can sometimes struggle to break through them alone. Gardevoir is also quite frail, and it can struggle to properly switch into battle sometimes. Pivots such as Darmanitan, Rotom-Mow, and Crobat are good teammates that are capable of bringing Gardevoir in safely. The latter two are capable of teaming up with Gardevoir to eventually beat down Steel-types that don't have a reliable recovery option, such as Metagross, Registeel, and Stakataka, while Darmanitan can just outright force them out. Spikes setters like Klefki, Roserade, and Golisopod are another very useful way to pile on the damage to Steel-types. Knock Off support from the likes of Golisopod and Incineroar can also be useful, as it removes Assault Vest from Reuniclus, Eviolite from Porygon2, Leftovers from Steel-types like Registeel and Metagross, and Heavy-Duty Boots from Togekiss and Incineroar. This allows Gardevoir to make more progress against these threats, as the former two will take more damage from Gardevoir and the latter two will be more vulnerable to cumulative chip damage, therefore making it easier for Gardevoir to break past them.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gardevoir's main niche comes from its access to useful utility moves in Trick and Healing Wish, which give it a notable advantage over other Choice Scarf users in the tier like Heracross, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan. Trick allows Gardevoir to cripple defensive Steel-types such as Registeel, Steelix, and Stakataka. Healing Wish can be especially useful when paired with a strong, frail wallbreaker or a defensive teammate that lacks a consistent form of recovery. Memento can also be useful to give a teammate such as Barbaracle, Cloyster, or Linoone a setup opportunity. Teleport is also very good when paired with a wallbreaker that threatens Steel-types, as Gardevoir has a tendency to lure them in. Gardevoir can also use Mystical Fire over a utility move in order to hit Metagross, Steelix, and Doublade, but these utility moves give Choice Scarf Gardevoir its niche. Trace allows Gardevoir to copy useful abilities such as Regenerator from Reuniclus, Adaptability from Dragalge, Storm Drain from Gastrodon, and Beast Boost from Stakataka and Xurkitree. It also gives Gardevoir an excellent matchup against weather teams, as it can copy the Speed boosting abilities from the weather sweepers and revenge kill them as a result.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Gardevoir is a very good partner for powerful wallbreakers that are prone to being worn down throughout the course of a match. Alolan Marowak, Heracross, and Chandelure are all powerful wallbreakers that get worn down by entry hazards and can be crippled by assorted status moves. Healing Wish can heal these Pokemon back to full; many teams are not equipped to deal with these dangerous Pokemon getting what is essentially an extra life. These wallbreakers, as well as others such as Golurk and Bewear, all threaten the Steel-types that might prevent Gardevoir from cleaning late-game. Gardevoir can further help these Pokemon out by revenge killing threats to them, such as Roserade, Obstagoon, and Toxtricity. Pivots such as Noivern, Raikou, Darmanitan, and Crobat can help Gardevoir to get into battle safely. Gardevoir is rather slow for a Choice Scarf user, so it can't revenge kill most other Choice Scarf users in the tier. Having defensive answers to Choice Scarf users such as Heracross, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan is therefore useful. Heracross can be hindered with Flying-types such as Togekiss and Crobat, Xurkitree can be pressured via Ground-types like Steelix and Nidoqueen or Electric-types such as Raikou, and Darmanitan is annoyed by Water-types like Suicune, Milotic, Volcanion, and Gastrodon. A user of strong priority, such as Golisopod, can also help remedy this issue.</p> "

Close Combat covers threats such as Umbreon, Cobalion, and Registeel. Protect is needed to activate Speed Boost safely. It also foils attempts by Golisopod and Durant to KO Sharpedo with First Impression. Waterfall is preferred over Liquidation, because Liquidation does not achieve any notable KOs that Waterfall doesn't, and the flinch chance is largely more useful than Liquidation's chance to drop Defense given Sharpedo's need to avoid taking damage at all costs. A Life Orb is required to give Sharpedo maximum damage output while still allowing it to switch moves. An Adamant nature also helps Sharpedo hit as hard as possible, but it does mean that +1 Sharpedo is outrun by Choice Scarf Heracross and Choice Scarf Xurkitree, so these threats should be accounted for before committing to a Sharpedo sweep.</p> <p>Sharpedo is best utilized with entry hazard stacking offense or hyper offense teams that can chip down the opposition as much as possible before Sharpedo attempts a sweep. Sharpedo's extreme frailty means that it should ideally OHKO everything it faces, lest it get OHKOed in return. Stealth Rock setters such as Metagross and Cobalion are good partners as a result. Spikes is also quite useful for accumulating even more chip damage, so setters such as Klefki, Roserade, and Golisopod work well with Sharpedo. Knock Off support can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from annoying Pokemon such as Volcanion and Togekiss, letting them get chipped into Sharpedo KO range. Employing users of the move, such as Salazzle, Golisopod, and Incineroar can work wonders as a result. Completely removing users of strong priority that revenge kills Sharpedo, such as Entei and Lucario, is mandatory. Sharpedo can work on hyper offense teams to apply a ton of offensive pressure in conjunction with other powerful teammates. Options such as Necrozma, Mimikyu, Polteageist, and Toxtricity are all nice choices for hyper offense teams looking to keep the pressure on. Pivoting teammates such as Noivern, Toxtricity, and Raikou can use their pivoting moves to get Sharpedo in safely, which is important given its extreme frailty.</p> "

Dark Pulse is preferred to guarantee OHKOs onto the likes of Metagross and Doublade. It also has a chance to put Golisopod into Emergency Exit range. Crunch can be used, however, as it hits Assault Vest Reuniclus harder. Close Combat is necessary to hit Umbreon and Registeel hard, though both must be chipped down before they are outright KOed by the move. Protect allows Sharpedo to accrue Speed boosts, therefore making it easier for it to sweep, while also preventing Golisopod and Durant from revenge killing it with First Impression. Ice Beam can be used to OHKO Noivern and 2HKO Togekiss without having to rely on the inaccurate Hydro Pump, but it is hard to fit on the moveset. Maximum Special Attack EVs are preferred for the best KO odds on Galarian Weezing, Togekiss, and Doublade.</p> <p>Sharpedo can be employed on entry hazard stacking offense and hyper offense teams that are in need of a late-game option.

Stealth Rock can be set by partners such as Metagross, Cobalion, and Seismitoad, while Spikes from the likes of Klefki and Roserade is important. Mixed Sharpedo doesn't match up quite as well against a few common threats such as Registeel and Umbreon. Employing methods of chipping these threats down specifically is recommended. Knock Off from the likes of Incineroar, Seismitoad, and Heracross is crippling, especially to the former two, and hazards can help wear these threats down, therefore giving Sharpedo an easier time busting past them. Pivoting Fighting-types like Cobalion can force these threats to switch around constantly, therefore also keeping up the pressure and wearing them down into Sharpedo KO range. Knock Off is also generally nice to have on your side, as it makes wearing down threats such as Togekiss and Noivern much easier.</p> "

Its access to Stealth Rock provides all-important role compression for these teams and is one of the big reasons Torkoal is preferred over Ninetales. Yawn forces the opponent to switch Pokemon or give one of Torkoal's offensive teammates a free switch in. Toxic is an alternative option, as it puts bulky Water-types, such as Milotic and Gastrodon, on timers and gives Torkoal an edge against the rare Politoed in a weather war. Body Press works off of Torkoal's high Defense stat to significantly threaten the likes of Porygon2, Snorlax, and Incineroar. Heat Rock should always be used to maximize the amount of turns Sun is active for Torkoal's teammates. Rapid Spin looks appealing, but it's generally better to just let a teammate deal with entry hazards, with Torkoal being weak to Stealth Rock and thus easy to pressure. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 176 Def / 84 Spe can be used in order to outspeed Steelix. Although rare, this can prevent weakened Steelix from getting Stealth Rock up against Torkoal before fainting to Lava Plume.</p> <p>Powerful sun threats are the best partners to take advantage of the support Torkoal provides. Shiftry is a prominent Chlorophyll sweeper that can mow down opposing teams with its boosted Speed and high-powered attacks. Charizard and Entei are powerful Fire-types that become even more challenging to switch into when their STAB moves are backed by sun. Xatu and Klefki are worthwhile support options to ensure entry hazards are not a problem for Torkoal. Both can also manually set sun via Sunny Day in order to relieve some pressure on Torkoal. Heliolisk is a unique sun attacker by virtue of its type and can utilize the sun to slot in Weather Ball to reliably crush Steel-types like Registeel and Steelix. Although rare, Politoed is a rather troublesome opposing weather setter that Torkoal can only threaten with Toxic or repeated use of Body Press. Noivern enjoys having its Flamethrowers boosted by Torkoal's sun, can use Defog to keep the field clear of entry hazards, and reliably check Politoed throughout a game.</p> "

Stone Edge pressures Togekiss and 2HKOes Noivern, Crobat, and Tornadus without having to lock into Outrage. Outrage gives Flygon a means to clean late-game and more power against threats such as Noivern, Heracross, and Gastrodon. Toxic catches Togekiss, as it is usually not 2HKOed by Stone Edge. It also forces damage onto threats that handle Flygon's attacks well, such as Seismitoad, Porygon2, and Dhelmise.

This is thanks to a great combination of mixed defenses, good movepool, decent Speed as a defensive Pokemon, and an ability that actually gives it a benefit from being hit by status moves. Flip Turn even allows Milotic to be used on faster-paced teams, as it becomes a bulky Pokemon that can actually build or maintain momentum. Milotic's ability to check powerful threats like Darmanitan, Flygon, Noivern, and Metagross is very welcome on many teams. However, Milotic finds itself in a tier where Electric- and Grass-types, such as Raikou, Toxtricity, Celebi, and Roserade, are incredibly potent. While Milotic's ability to take hits of all kinds is relatively uncommon for defensive Pokemon, it does mean that extremely powerful wallbreakers, such as Lucario and Heracross, can use their powerful STAB moves to brute force their way past Milotic.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Competitive set can be a Defog deterrent on Spikes stacking teams, as the common Defoggers do not generally fare well against a Milotic with boosted Ice Beam. Marvel Scale might make Flame Orb strategies look appealing, but the constant chip damage forces Milotic to use Recover way too often.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: RU is not short on Electric-types, and all of them can simply push past Milotic's defenses with powerful STAB moves. Raikou and Xurkitree aren't scared of Scald nor hindered too badly by a potential Toxic, as they rarely stay in long. Toxtricity is more vulnerable to Flip Turns as it switches in due to its much lower Speed, but similarly threatens out Milotic if it safely switches in and is immune to Toxic. Heliolisk, though much less common than the others, is perhaps the worst enemy of Milotic thanks to Dry Skin even cutting off Milotic's ability to pivot out with Flip Turn as Heliolisk switches in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Celebi, Roserade, and Decidueye easily handle Milotic. Celebi's Natural Cure can make Toxic and Scald burns a non-factor for it, while Roserade's Natural Cure and secondary Poison typing work similarly. Both can utilize their powerful Grass-type STAB moves to eliminate Milotic. To make matters worse, Celebi can maintain momentum with U-turn on a forced switch out, while Roserade can litter the field with Spikes to undermine Milotic's bulk later on.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Milotic's good but not spectacular mixed bulk means that very powerful wallbreakers can push past it. Choice Specs Indeedee, Guts Heracross, Obstagoon, and Nasty Plot Togekiss are all strong enough to overcome Milotic with powerful neutral STAB moves.</p> ",

Flip Turn generally is preferred to generate and maintain momentum as a defensive Pokemon, something that is generally uncommon. This is especially helpful on faster-paced teams that would rather have Milotic stay a step ahead of threats like Raikou and Roserade. Ice Beam prevents Grass-types from switching into Milotic as freely, discouraging Roserade from using Spikes freely. It also OHKOs Noivern and Flygon. Toxic is able to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Gastrodon, which can help Milotic's more offensive teammates push past them. It also is great for chipping away at common switch-ins like Raikou and Xurkitree. Haze is a great alternative that allows Milotic to stall out Substitute + Protect variants of Suicune lacking Toxic as well as prevent Calm Mind Reuniclus from taking advantage of Milotic's low damage output. On more defensive teams, Haze is a solid option over Flip Turn or Ice Beam, as these teams generally don't care as much about momentum as they do about covering as many offensive threats as possible. Milotic's 48 Speed EVs enable it to outpace Adamant Golurk.</p> <p>As Milotic is a defensive Pokemon that can maintain momentum, it can work on faster-paced teams that appreciate having it as a defensive backbone when they're forced out by certain Pokemon. Toxtricity and Raikou are powerful Electric-types that can threaten the majority of the tier and appreciate Milotic being able to bring them in safely. VoltTurn cores with the likes of Cobalion, Incineroar, Xurkitree, and Raikou are also powerful on more offensive teams that aim to maintain momentum. Roserade is a great check to most Electric-types, can spare Milotic from Toxic from the likes of Porygon2 and bulky Water-types, and litter the field with Spikes to amplify the effects of Flip Turn. In return, Milotic is able to check offensive Steel-types and multiple Fire-types. Porygon2 is another great slow pivot move user on balance teams that can also run Toxic to allow Milotic to more easily use Haze for the likes of Snorlax and Suicune. Registeel, Togekiss, and Galarian Weezing are great options on slower teams. Registeel is able to set up Stealth Rock, check Indeedee and most Electric- and Grass-types, and appreciates Milotic being able to switch into most Fire- and Ground-types looking to take on Registeel. Galarian Weezing and Togekiss are able to take on the likes of Obstagoon, Pangoro, and Heracross for Milotic. Galarian Weezing can even set Toxic Spikes so Milotic doesn't have to waste a turn using Toxic, while Togekiss can use Defog to clear the field of entry hazards, which sometimes force Milotic to use Recover more often than it would like.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Registeel's excellent bulk and great defensive typing make it one of the most resilient defensive Pokemon in RU. Key resistances to Flying, Fairy, Grass, and Dragon allow it to pivot into threats such as Togekiss, Noivern, Roserade, Dragalge, and Gardevoir. This is supplemented by its great natural bulk, which allows it to also take powerful neutral hits from the likes of Xurkitree and Toxtricity. Registeel also has Stealth Rock, and its ability to annoy common Defoggers like Togekiss and Crobat makes it a good user of the move. Registeel is unfortunately reliant on its Leftovers to stay healthy, which makes Knock Off incredibly threatening to it. Registeel is also rather passive compared to other Steel-types, as it is much more reliant on the likes of Toxic to make progress than its Steel-type competition of Steelix and Metagross. Annoying weaknesses to Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-type moves leaves Registeel open to common Pokemon such as Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Heracross.</p> ",

Seismic Toss allows Registeel to dole out consistent damage to everything that isn't a Ghost-type, making it less passive overall. Body Press can be used instead, however, as it puts more damage onto certain threats such as Cobalion, Stakataka, and Pangoro. Heavy Slam is the preferred last move, as it gives Registeel a decently strong STAB move that hits threats such as Togekiss, Roserade, and Mimikyu. Protect can be used instead to get more Leftovers recovery and scout Choice-locked moves from the likes of Toxtricity and Darmanitan.

Fighting-resistant Pokemon are important for Registeel, so adding a partner like Togekiss, Noivern, or Galarian Weezing is recommended. Bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can help Registeel check Ground- and Fire-types, while Registeel can stomach hits from Electric-types like Xurkitree in return. Pokemon such as Dhelmise, Roserade, and Golisopod appreciate Registeel checking Flying-types such as Togekiss, Noivern, and Crobat. Ground-types such as Golurk and Gastrodon appreciate Registeel switching into Celebbi and Roserade, and they in return can prevent Registeel from getting worn down by Volt Switch from Toxtricity and Xurkitree. Knock Off absorbers are very important for the Leftovers-reliant Registeel. Options such as Galarian Weezing and Vileplume can switch into Golisopod and Heracross, while Gastrodon can deal with Incineroar. Registeel is also setup bait for bulky Calm Mind users such as Reuniclus and Suicune. Reuniclus can be dealt with via powerful Ghost-types such as Alolan Marowak and Chandelure, while Suicune can collapse under constant pressure from Grass-types like Roserade and Electric-types like Raikou and Toxtricity. Registeel can be supported via Wish users like Togekiss and Umbreon if you are not comfortable with it just relying on Leftovers to stay healthy. Togekiss can also take on the Ground-types like Flygon that Registeel dislikes, while Umbreon can aid Registeel against Toxtricity and Chandelure.</p> "

Grass Knot is an alternative Grass-type STAB move that provides consistent damage against Pokemon such as Stakataka, Suicune, and Raikou. However, it does not provide recovery like Giga Drain and does not have as much damage potential as Leaf Storm. Shadow Ball hits some of Roserade's conventional checks in Chandelure, Doublade, and Metagross, while Extrasensory hits Poison-types such as Crobat, Dragalge, Salazzle, and Toxtricity.

Recover gives it great longevity, and Clear Smog can be used to hold off bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus, which has pretty few surefire answers. Its solid coverage in Earth Power alongside Ice Beam or Scald keeps it from a being particularly easy wall for offensive teams to switch into. However, many of the Pokemon it can switch into run Toxic or Knock Off, so it will often be under pressure from passive damage, especially when used as a blanket check on more offensive teams. These conditions will force Gastrodon to use Recover at predictable times, which will give up offensive momentum.

Knock Off allows Tornadus to weaken its typical switch-ins such as Raikou, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Registeel by removing their items. U-turn allows Tornadus to gain momentum and pivot out of disadvantageous matchups. Tailwind is a great move to support slower teammates or give them more sweeping potential. Heat Wave, on the other hand, gives Tornadus a better matchup versus Steel-types such as Metagross, Steelix, and Klefki. Even though Tornadus is not the best defogger in RU, its ability to remove entry hazards safely due to its Prankster Defog can be useful in important situations. Taunt is an option to cripple passive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Umbreon and to prevent Pokemon such as Barbaracle and Snorlax from setting up on it. Rain Dance turns Tornadus into a secondary rain setter for rain teams. Defiant is the ability of choice if Heat Wave is used for the last move slot.</p> <p>Tornadus baits bulky Steel- and Rock-types as well as special defensive Pokemon such as Registeel, Diancie, and Umbreon into the battle and pivots out on them with U-turn.

Strong but fragile Pokemon such as Obstagoon, Toxtricity, and Indeedee-M appreciate Tornadus's U-turn support. In addition, these strong attackers are good examples of Pokemon that benefit from Tornadus's Tailwind support. Other pivots such as Raikou, Xurkitree, and Cobalion pair well with Tornadus, since they form an offensive VoltTurn core together.

Weather Ball is to be used on rain teams, as the boosted Water-type coverage lets Tornadus reliably break through Pokemon such as Xurkitree, Incineroar, and Diancie after a boost. Outside of rain, Focus Blast is Tornadus's strongest option against various targets like Umbreon, Snorlax, Diancie, and Stakataka. Grass Knot hits Milotic and Suicune hardest, while also being an accurate option for other threats like Gastrodon and Golurk. However, Grass Knot covers much less important targets than Tornadus's other coverage, notably even the lightweight Diancie takes negligible damage, and the aforementioned bulky Water-types are all hit hard by Hurricane anyways.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Tornadus has a niche in RU as a strong wallbreaker on many archetypes, especially on rain and hyper offense teams. Strong physical attackers such as Obstagoon, Metagross, and Heracross are great teammates, as they deal with specially defensive Pokemon such as Diancie, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Snorlax that Tornadus struggles with. Spikes and Toxic Spikes support from the likes of Klefki, Roserade, and Dragalge are also a great way to wear down these specially defensive Pokemon. The aforementioned two are also able to check Raikou and Xurkitree. Bulky Pokemon such as Milotic, Porygon2, and Assault Vest Reuniclus give Tornadus a reliable defensive backbone, since Tornadus is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users, such as Noivern, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan. Pivots like Raikou, Porygon2, and Milotic bring Tornadus safely onto the battlefield, and in most cases, against Pokemon it can beat such as Roserade, Cobalion, and Celebi. Strong late-game sweepers such as Choice Scarf Heracross, Xurkitree, and Sharpedo appreciate Tornadus' ability to weaken opponent's team. Tornadus fits well on rain teams, where Politoed is a necessary teammate. Kabutops and Kingdra as strong rain sweepers overwhelm bulkier Pokemon alongside Tornadus. In return, Tornadus checks bulky Water- and Grass-types. Lastly, Tornadus can also be used on dual screens teams, where the screens support give it more setup opportunities. Klefki can set up ideal conditions for Tornadus with dual screens and Spikes. Other strong setup sweepers such as Linoone, Cloyster, and Necrozma are great choices to overwhelm opposing teams.</p> "

However, Talonflame is able to check certain Steel-types such as Metagross and Steelix well, unlike its Flying-type competition. Talonflame is also able to stave off Fighting-types such as Cobalion and Heracross. Will-O-Wisp allows Talonflame to cripple common Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Diancie and Stakataka, Steel-types like Cobalion and Steelix, and setup sweepers like Swords Dance Doublade and Swords Dance Mimikyu. U-turn is helpful to keep momentum and bring in frailer wallbreakers and other teammates. Flare Blitz and Toxic can be run over Brave Bird and Will-O-Wisp to make Talonflame more immediately threatening to Steel-types and Electric-types; Toxic also makes it harder for Water-types to handle it. However, this leaves it without a move to hit Chandelure and is less threatening to Stakataka. Talonflame has the option to run a Swords Dance set with maximum Attack investment as well as Flare Blitz and Swords Dance over U-turn and Will-O-Wisp, which threatens common Flying-resistant Pokemon like Raikou and Steelix. Swords Dance Talonflame still struggles to break past most bulky Water- and Rock-types and loses immense utility by not having U-turn or Will-O-Wisp, however. 240 Speed EVs let Talonflame outspeed Ribombee. While an offensive EV spread is preferred, Talonflame can alternatively run a physically defensive EV spread of 16 HP / 252 Def / 240 Spe to more reliably check Lucario, Dhelmise, and Metagross, but it gives up the ability to guarantee a 2HKO on Chandelure.</p> <p>Talonflame cannot do much to the many Rock- and Water-type Pokemon like Diancie, Milotic, and Gastrodon in the tier, so Celebi, Milotic, and Vileplume make good teammates that are able to switch in and threaten these Pokemon.

Talonflame's ability to lure in Rock- and Water-types such as Stakataka, Diancie, and Milotic can give free switches to teammates like Golurk, Decidueye, and Heracross thanks to U-turn. Talonflame appreciates cleric support from Diancie, Vileplume, and Sylveon to reliably handle Toxic users such as Metagross and defensive Stakataka. Talonflame isn't a reliable Fighting-type check on its own, so Mimikyu and Starmie make good teammates for it that are able to assist against Heracross and Cobalion. Knock Off can ruin Talonflame by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots, making it vulnerable to Stealth Rock; Knock Off absorbers like Cobalion, Vileplume, and Gastrodon can take Knock Off for Talonflame.

In return, Sylveon is able to keep them healthy with its cleric support. Offensive threats like Necrozma can threaten Poison-types like Vileplume and Crobat that annoy Sylveon. Steel-types like Metagross and Cobalion are also useful, since they resist both of Sylveon's weaknesses, while in return Sylveon is able to keep them healthy with Wish.</p> "

Thunder Wave serves as a great form of speed control, allowing Klefki to shut down sweepers such as Polteageist and cripple the likes of Noivern and Crobat. Toxic in the final slot ensures that Klefki has a way to threaten Ground-type Pokemon like Golurk and Electric-type Pokemon like Xurkitree and Raikou, though it is less valuable for faster paced offensive teams, as the gradual poisoning damage doesn't have as many turns to add up. Defog can be used over a status move on teams that need emergency hazard removal; however, Klefki has poor matchups against common hazard setters like Cobalion, Steelix, and Metagross. Foul Play can be used over Toxic in order to give Klefki a way to punish a number of its checks, such as Golurk, Metagross, and Doublade, as they switch in.

    "overview": "<p>Noivern provides excellent utility to any team as an offensive pivot or Defogger. Its typing and sky-high Speed tier let it check and revenge kill a vast array of common Pokemon such as Volcanion and Cobalion. Noivern excels as a pivot, providing frequent free switches for wallbreakers while forming potent VoltTurn cores with Xurkitree, Raikou, and Flygon. As a Defogger, Noivern has some of the better matchups against common entry hazard setters, being able to threaten Cobalion, Steelix, and Roserade but struggling with Stakataka, Diancie, and Registeel. Noivern's defensive utility is greatly diminished by its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can't switch in on Pokemon such as Incineroar and Golisopod without the risk of getting hit by Knock Off. Furthermore, Noivern's mediocre Special Attack means it barely scratches special walls like Diancie, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Snorlax while also leaving it as setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus and Nasty Plot Togekiss. However, Noivern can circumvent its switch-ins by providing a free switch for powerful wallbreakers with U-turn.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can cripple common switch-ins to Noivern such as Togekiss, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. With Toxic, Noivern can also act as a hard stop to Calm Mind + Substitute Suicune thanks to Infiltrator. However, using Toxic means giving up on the great utility provided by U-turn or Defog, which is difficult to justify on most teams. A stallbreaker set with Taunt prevents Cobalion, Bronzong, and Registeel from setting Stealth Rock and walls like Milotic, Togekiss, and Snorlax from healing. Generally, Hurricane is the preferred STAB option alongside Taunt because it gives better odds of beating Calm Mind Suicune. Switcheroo can be run alongside Choice Scarf to cripple Noivern's switch-ins such as Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. Swapping items with bulky set-up Pokemon like Snorlax, Reuniclus, and Suicune neutralizes their attempts at a sweep. Noivern is also the fastest Choice Scarf user in RU and can even outspeed and revenge kill +2 Cloyster. However, Choice Scarf sets are greatly limited by Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn pivots like Crobat, Flygon, and Darmanitan. It can also be used alongside Taunt to always beat Registeel. The big downfall with Rocky Helmet is that it also leaves Noivern vulnerable to Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Sylveon, Diancie, and Togekiss wall Noivern. Diancie is especially troublesome for Defog Noivern because it can freely switch in on the turn Noivern uses Defog and set Stealth Rock again. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can revenge kill Noivern, and Mimikyu can use Defog sets as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2 take very little damage from Noivern's attacks. Reuniclus can set up Future Sight or remove an item with Knock Off, Umbreon gets a free Wish for itself or its teammates, Snorlax sets up Curse, and Porygon2 pivots out with Teleport or cripples something with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf users: Choice Scarf users such as Heracross, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan can revenge kill Noivern after a slight bit of prior damage. Less common Choice Scarf users such as Tyrantrum and Gardevoir can always OHKO Noivern.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Certain Steel-types like Registeel, Stakataka, and Klefki can take Flamethrower from Noivern multiple times. Klefki can also cripple Noivern with Thunder Wave. Steelix and Cobalion can threaten Noivern on the switch with a Rock-type coverage move in Head Smash or Stone Edge.</p> ",

U-turn takes advantage of Noivern's switch-ins to provide a free switch for its teammates. Noivern can opt for Defog if the team is in need of entry hazard removal. Heavy-Duty Boots is necessary because Noivern is held down by Stealth Rock otherwise. With Infiltrator, Noivern can ignore Substitute from Volcanion and rare Chandelure sets.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Heracross, Choice Band Metagross, and Toxtricity appreciate the free switch provided by U-turn and take advantage of common switch-ins to Noivern like Assault Vest Reuniclus, Togekiss, and Diancie.

Diancie can leverage its great matchup against most Defog users, including Crobat and Togekiss, to set Stealth Rock consistently. Diamond Storm's +2 Defense boost can suddenly make Diancie very difficult to KO with physical attacks and empowers Body Press, a key move that allows Diancie to immediately threaten Stakataka and Zarude along with dealing heavy damage to Registeel after a Diamond Storm boost. This Defense boost can also turn the tables on Flygon as Diancie can survive Earthquake with boosted Defense, and then deal massive damage with Body Press. Toxic cripples common switch-ins like Seismitoad and Milotic, while also pressuring Togekiss, the only common Defog user that can reliably stall out Diamond Storm's meager PP. The given spread allows Diancie to check the likes of Xurkitree and Chandelure comfortably. Should another member of its team already be using Stealth Rock, Diancie can opt to run Heal Bell or Protect in that slot instead. Heal Bell can give crucial cleric support for Diancie and its team, while Protect can stall for Leftovers recovery, rack up Toxic damage, and scout potential Choice item users, such as Toxtricity and Metagross, to ease switching into them.</p> <p>Diancie is generally a sitting duck against bulky Water-types, as it can only threaten them with Toxic, so it should have teammates that can switch into them easily. Roserade is particularly notable because it's immune to Toxic, can form an entry hazard-stacking core with Diancie, and can lessen pressure on Diancie to check Raikou and Xurkitree. As Diancie has no reliable recovery of its own, Wish and Heal Bell support from Umbreon can be very beneficial. Diancie is very vulnerable to entry hazards continually chipping away at it as it switches in. Noivern, Volcanion, and Crobat are notable Defog users that appreciate Diancie checking Toxtricity and Xurkitree. Volcanion can even switch into various Water-type moves aimed at Diancie, while Noivern and Crobat are great checks to Roserade and Zarude should Diancie not catch them with an offensive move as they switch in. Despite having Body Press, Diancie greatly appreciates Pokemon that can handle faster Steel-types, particularly Cobalion and Metagross. Bulky Water-types such as Seismitoad and Milotic generally do well against these Pokemon. Seismitoad can run Stealth Rock to free up a moveslot for Diancie or vice versa. Milotic is more vulnerable to Thunder Punch from Metagross, but it also has Recover to sustain itself throughout longer games. Zarude can reliably handle bulky Water-types, and it enjoys having Diancie to fall back on when threatened by faster Flying- and Fire-types.

However, Volcanion's low Speed and weakness to common typings in Electric, Ground, and Rock leave it vulnerable to common Pokemon such as Raikou and Flygon and coverage moves like Metagross's Earthquake and Cobalion's Stone Edge.

Drain Punch mitigates damage from tanking physical attacks and recoil from using Double-Edge. At +2 Attack, Close Combat gets OHKOs that Drain Punch misses out on such as against Steelix and Diancie after Stealth Rock. Darkest Lariat covers Ghost-types like Chandelure, Mimikyu, and Doublade while also providing a hard-hitting move without recoil for Psychic-types like Reuniclus and Celebi. Chople Berry prevents faster threats such as Heracross and Lucario from easily revenge killing Bewear, while Silk Scarf boosts Double-Edge for an almost guaranteed OHKO on Reuniclus and Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock.

Other Spikers such as Roserade, Golisopod, and Dragalge help wear down walls while providing additional support in Sleep Powder, Knock Off, or Flip Turn. Roserade and Dragalge also check Electric-types trying to revenge kill Bewear such as Raikou and Xurkitree. Pokemon such as Flygon, Noivern, and Sharpedo appreciate Bewear denting Fairy-types like Togekiss and Galarian Weezing.

In particular, its higher Speed stat is what differentiates it from Dhelmise and lets it outspeed the whole unboosted metagame after a Rapid Spin. Tsareena's vulnerability to Toxic and difficulty to fit Synthesis make it unable to naturally switch into Electric- and Water-types like Raikou, Xurkitree, and Gastrodon unlike other Grass-types such as Roserade, Vileplume, and Celebi. Knock Off removes crucial items like Heavy-Duty Boots from switch-ins such as Incineroar while not giving away any free switches to Chandelure and Metagross. Triple Axel catches Flying- and Grass-types such as Togekiss, Noivern, and Vileplume on the switch. High Jump Kick, U-turn, and Synthesis are all great options, but without either Knock Off or Triple Axel, Tsareena is left completely vulnerable to common threats like Metagross and Togekiss. With Heavy-Duty Boots, Tsareena can repeatedly switch into entry hazards to remove them with Rapid Spin. Queenly Majesty protects Tsareena from priority moves like Golisopod's First Impression, which lets it win the matchup and keep entry hazards off the field.</p> <p>Cobalion is the biggest thorn in Tsareena's side, as it switches into any attack with impunity, can raise its Attack through Justified, either sets Stealth Rock or Swords Dance for free, and can punish Tsareena for spinning with Rocky Helmet. Therefore, any Tsareena without High Jump Kick should be paired with a solid Cobalion answer such as Gastrodon, Noivern, or Reuniclus. On its own, Tsareena isn't a very reliable switch-in to Electric- and Water-types like Raikou and Milotic, but more reliable checks such as Gastrodon and Dragalge can pick up the slack. While Flying-types such as Togekiss, Crobat, and Tornadus need to watch out for Triple Axel, they all outspeed and threaten Tsareena with their STAB moves. Metagross, Raikou, and Diancie can check said Flying-types for Tsareena. Poison-types such as Roserade, Salazzle, and Galarian Weezing can either threaten or wall Tsareena. Roserade is especially a nuisance, as it's a Spikes setter that Tsareena loses to. Pokemon such as Crobat can check Roserade while Gastrodon helps with the latter two. Pokemon such as Cloyster, Toxtricity, and Heracross are ravaged by entry hazards and greatly appreciate Tsareena spinning them away.</p> "

Golisopod's typing and physical bulk allow it to check some strong threats such as Metagross, physical Sharpedo, and Flygon as well. However, after First Impression is used, Golisopod is easy to revenge kill due to its low Speed stat and mediocre special bulk. Golisopod also struggles against many common bulky Pokemon such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Vileplume, particularly the Water-types. Although its Emergency Exit might be helpful in some situations, getting forced to switch out is disadvantageous in most cases.</p> ",

Close Combat allows Golisopod to 2HKO Registeel and Cobalion as well as hit Water-types for decent damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Seismitoad, Milotic, and Gastrodon take very little from Golisopod's moves and threaten it with a Scald burn or Toxic poison.

Toxicroak deserves a special mention despite not being bulky, as it easily takes advantage of Golisopod due to its typing and ability. However, none of these Pokemon like having their items removed by Knock Off. Pokemon such as Dragalge and Bewear are easy to wear down due to their lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-types such as Noivern, Togekiss, and Crobat easily revenge kill Golisopod and switch into its First Impression.

Knock Off punishes Golisopod's typical switch-ins such as Noivern, Togekiss, and Milotic. In addition, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from grounded switch-ins such Gastrodon, Dragalge, and Volcanion enables Golisopod to wear them down with Spikes. Heavy-Duty Boots gives Golisopod more switch-in opportunities by negating its severe entry hazard weakness. The listed Speed EVs allow Golisopod to outspeed Pokemon with uninvested base 50 Speed such as Diancie, Registeel, and Vileplume.

Zarude can be checked by Crobat, Klefki, and Talonflame. Rhyperior can lure in Zarude and KO it with Megahorn, making it another good partner.

Synthesis improves Dhelmise's longevity and lets it check Xurkitree, Raikou, and Toxtricity, but it has low PP, which means Dhelmise should be wary of chip damage from attacks like Volt Switch. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Dhelmise to use Rapid Spin more effectively. 192 HP EVs allow Dhelmise to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Toxtricity's Overdrive, while 100 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Sassy Incineroar, as well as Golurk and Stealth Rock Metagross after Rapid Spin.</p> <p>Dark-types like Umbreon and Incineroar and Normal-types like Snorlax and Porygon2 are problematic for Dhelmise, as they make Poltergeist harder to spam.

  "Xurkitree": {
    "overview": "<p>Of RU's three best Electric-types, Xurkitree, Raikou, and Toxtricity, Xurkitree is commonly considered the most restrictive and consistently dangerous for one simple reason: Grass-type coverage. Its Heavy-Duty Boots set singlehandedly makes Gastrodon, a strong Raikou answer, insufficient for covering the metagame's Electric-types, and other Ground-types like Steelix and Flygon shaky at best. With Ground-types so hesitant to face Xurkitree, it's free to use Volt Switch on switch-ins like Grass-types and special walls, which are rife with weaknesses for teammates to exploit. It's at its strongest against bulkier cores, which often use slower, exploitable Pokemon like Togekiss and Water-types and which struggle to pressure it with passive damage thanks to its Heavy-Duty Boots. While its Speed and bulk aren't great against offensive teams, it can usually find at least one opportunity to threaten them as well, either by forcing a switch or taking a hit. Should its team call for it, it can use Choice Scarf for greater use against offense and potentially cleaning up with Beast Boost at the expense of threatening defensive cores. What generally holds Xurkitree back is its aforementioned bulk and Speed; it can't switch into many direct attacks, and it often has very little breathing room against offense, areas where Raikou beats it out. Its Choice Scarf set suffers from prediction reliance against Ground-types and failing to outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Heracross and Flygo, limiting its ability to revenge kill and clean up. If you're looking for raw attacking power, you might prefer Toxtricity, whose Boomburst is easier to spam and much stronger than any of Xurkitree's individual attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Endure + Salac Berry has merit on Sticky Web teams, giving Xurkitree the simultaneous benefits of heightened Speed and attack freedom while blocking First Impression and outpacing Choice Scarf users not named Flygon. If you build around Indeedee-M, its Psychic Surge lets Xurkitree run Nature Power to OHKO Roserade, Vileplume, and Nidoqueen.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Roserade, Celebi, Vileplume, and Dhelmise are popular alongside Ground-types to minimize the damage Xurkitree can do, given their Electric resistance and neutrality-at-worst to its coverage. They're vulnerable to Volt Switch, though, so Xurkitree's team will often stay at an advantage, and Vileplume's and Dhelmise's lower Speed means Xurkitree doesn't even need to predict them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Bulky Pokemon like Diancie, Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Porygon2, and Umbreon stand up well to Xurkitree's unboosted attacks but are total Volt Switch fodder. They need Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree statused or itemless to win a battle of attrition.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Steelix's Grass neutrality makes it the best Ground-type Xurkitree switch-in, though it quickly loses to repeated Grass Knot or Energy Ball. Flygon can take Dazzling Gleam once with the right EVs. Other Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Golurk usually switch out when Xurkitree appears in fear of Grass-type moves but can punish overeager uses of Volt Switch. Any Ground-type is a serious problem for Choice Scarf Xurkitree, creating a cost for locking into Electric-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: With resistance to Electric and neutrality to Grass and Fairy, other Electric-types like Raikou, Toxtricity, and Xurkitree itself make for decent early-game switch-ins to Xurkitree. Only Toxtricity threatens much damage back, however, and none of them are eager to keep losing HP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority: Offensive teams featuring a lot of fast Pokemon give Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree few easy entry points and seldom lose more than one Pokemon to it. Faster Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Heracross can revenge kill weakened Choice Scarf Xurkitree. The same goes for strong priority from the likes of Golisopod and Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak: Lighting Rod Alolan Marowak is unique in that it's immune to Electric and resistant to both Grass and Fairy, making it a major early-game obstacle to Xurkitree, but it's uncommon, very flawed, and fairly easy to wear down.</p> ",

Necrozma can use Autotomize to outrun the whole metagame and use Meteor Beam to boost its Special Attack and pose an extremely deadly threat; however, Meteor Beam needs Power Herb, so Autotomize Necrozma is often preserved to clean up late-game. It's also often forced into mind games against Incineroar, which can bait its Power Herb Meteor Beam, switch out, and wall it afterward. Necrozma's great bulk and power to weaken walls also make it one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters on offense teams.

Its combination of Fire neutrality and Flying, Fairy, and Psychic resistances means it checks many common threats utilizing Fire-type coverage like Gardevoir, specially offensive Necrozma, and Noivern in addition to Salazzle and Chandelure. Its quadruple Normal resistance makes it one of the tier's better ways to take Toxtricity's Boomburst as well. Unfortunately, since Stakataka's the slowest Pokemon in the tier, it's usually getting hit first and worn down easily, and it is forced to make predictions even when other defensive Pokemon are switching in.

Pokemon with the typing or special bulk to take Boomburst, like Stakataka and Porygon2, are vulnerable to Toxtricity's coverage or lose momentum to Volt Switch. Though slow, Toxtricity poses a massive early-game threat to offensive teams, as staples like Noivern cannot immediately OHKO it and fear getting OHKOed in return. Its resistances let it even switch into and punish Cobalion, Roserade, and Raikou once or twice, especially if they go for utility moves. Once Toxtricity has taken some damage, however, it becomes much less of a threat, as its low Speed and bulk will make it easy for many Pokemon to pick off. Its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and Spikes worsens this issue, especially in a metagame full of pivots using Heavy-Duty Boots, which incentivizes conventional offensive teams to forgo entry hazard removal. It faces competition from RU's other top Electric-types, Raikou and Xurkitree; the former's naturally high Speed lets it remain a threat to offense all game long, while the latter can use Choice Scarf to similarly threaten offense or Heavy-Duty Boots to wallbreak like Toxtricity without fearing entry hazards.

The Speed raise from Scale Shot can prevent Choice Scarf users from revenge killing Regidrago after setup, but it's inconsistent due to its variability in power. After a Dragon Dance, Thunder Fang 2HKOes even bulky Togekiss. Substitute helps Regidrago set up by blocking Scald burns and Toxic. The passive recovery from Leftovers means Regidrago can use Substitute many more times throughout a battle. An Adamant nature is preferable to ensure the 2HKO on Togekiss with Thunder Fang after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Try as it might, Regidrago can't break through Steelix, Galarian Weezing, Diancie, and Doublade. Luckily, wallbreakers like Starmie and Golurk can pick up the slack and blow past each one with relative ease. Fighting-types such as Guts Heracross, Bewear, and Pangoro can also overwhelm Diancie and Galarian Weezing while breaking Steelix and Doublade. Crobat, Darmanitan, and Incineroar can safely switch Regidrago into the battlefield with U-turn. Darmanitan and Incineroar synergize particularly well with Regidrago, as they can bring it in against bulky Water-types for a setup opportunity. Disguised as Regidrago, Zoroark can lure Galarian Weezing, Sylveon, Steelix, and Doublade with coverage moves in Extrasensory, Sludge Bomb, and Flamethrower. Dragon Dance Regidrago fits well on dual screens hyper offense teams, as it can get multiple boosts with ease thanks to its titanic bulk under dual screens. One notable Pokemon commonly seen on dual screens hyper offense is Cloyster; after a Shell Smash, it can OHKO both Doublade and Galarian Weezing with Hydro Pump. Other hyper offense staples like Necrozma and Mimikyu can help with breaking bulky Steel-types.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragon's Maw-boosted Outrage is a sight to behold, but in a tier infested with Fairy- and Steel-types, Regidrago finds its effectiveness limited. Nevertheless, with good team support, Regidrago is a force to be reckoned with. Scale Shot is decently strong and doesn't lock Regidrago in like Outrage does. The Speed raise also makes it harder to revenge kill with faster threats like Noivern and Starmie. Hammer Arm is Regidrago's best move to hit Diancie as well as Steel-types such as Steelix and Registeel. Thunder Fang is a near-guaranteed 2HKO on max HP Togekiss. Explosion is an alternative over either Outrage or Scale Shot, as it opens the door for Regidrago's teammates by either severely weakening or outright KOing Togekiss, Sylveon, or Galarian Weezing. Crunch is also an option to hit Doublade and 2HKO Metagross and Bronzong but has no other relevant targets.</p> <p>Regidrago can do next to nothing against Sylveon, Galarian Weezing, and Doublade. Toxtricity is noteworthy for dealing with the mentioned Pokemon and weakening Steelix, which repeatedly switches in on Regidrago otherwise. Fighting- and Dark-types like Heracross and Sharpedo can pair with Regidrago to overwhelm shared checks, such as Fairy-types. Regidrago can also lure and severely weaken Fairy-types with Explosion so its Fighting- and Dark-type teammate can clean up afterward. Zoroark can disguise itself as Regidrago with Illusion to lure and surprise Fairy-types with a super effective Sludge Bomb. Pivots like Raikou, Milotic, and Darmanitan are excellent for safely bringing Regidrago onto the field. Darmanitan and other Fire-types like Volcanion and Incineroar are grateful for Regidrago breaking bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Gastrodon. Spikes support from Roserade and Klefki helps whittle down sturdy Steel-types like Steelix, Metagross, and Doublade.</p> "
