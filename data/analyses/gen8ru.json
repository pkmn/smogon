    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is both a premier offensive Stealth Rock setter and a devastating Sheer Force wallbreaker with few safe switch-ins. It can forgo Stealth Rock altogether to run a dedicated wallbreaker set, which can even get past some usual answers like Umbreon, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Bronzong with the right moves. Nidoqueen's typing lends it crucial resistances like Fighting and an immunity to Electric, which lets it check prominent Pokemon such as Cobalion and Raikou. Most importantly, however, is having that Electric immunity without a Grass weakness, which lets it check Xurkitree and block its Volt Switch, a trait only shared by Steelix. However, Nidoqueen's lack of reliable recovery severely cuts into how long it can check a foe. At best, it might check a Pokemon like Xurkitree twice, but Nidoqueen can take full advantage of these opportunities to punish the opponent with an onslaught of Sheer Force + Life Orb boosted attacks. Nidoqueen's slightly below average Speed is just enough to get the jump on various threats such as Metagross and Bewear, but it barely misses out on a lot of other prevalent threats like Togekiss, Gardevoir, and Xurkitree. This often leads to worse matchups against fast-paced teams, as Nidoqueen will have fewer opportunities to set Stealth Rock or get an attack off against faster foes.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A specially defensive set with Black Sludge is viable on balance and stall teams as a solid switch-in to Xurkitree, but it competes with Steelix and is harder to fit elsewhere, as more offensive teams heavily value Nidoqueen's wallbreaking ability. With Choice Scarf, Nidoqueen can outspeed and surprise KO revenge killers such as Flygon, Gardevoir, and Celebi, but outside of the surprise factor, it's generally outclassed by other Choice Scarf users due to its lower Speed tier. Nidoqueen can set Toxic Spikes, but the abundance of Poison-types such as opposing Nidoqueen and Roserade, Heavy-Duty Boots users, and ungrounded Pokemon, such as Crobat and Flygon, leaves few relevant targets for the move. Focus Blast with a Modest nature 2HKOes Umbreon and Porygon2 after Stealth Rock, but Nidoqueen already has more reliable methods to deal with both in Taunt and Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Umbreon, and the rarer Porygon2 can comfortably switch into any of Nidoqueen's attacks; Reuniclus, in particular, does this well, as it out-heals any damage it takes with Regenerator. However, all of them need to watch out for Toxic, and Umbreon also fears Taunt. Snorlax can switch in with ease and use Nidoqueen as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Certain bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Jellicent, and Vaporeon sport high enough special bulk to comfortably switch into Nidoqueen. However, the former two will lose in the long run to sets with Toxic, and all of them fear the rare Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Common faster threats such as Flygon, Starmie, and Gardevoir can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen but can't safely switch in. Gardevoir can even copy Sheer Force with Trace to boost its moves and make it harder for Nidoqueen's teammates to deal with it.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong: Thanks to Levitate, Bronzong hard counters any Nidoqueen set without Fire Blast.</p> ",

Ice Beam OHKOes Flygon and 2HKOes Crobat, both of which Nidoqueen can't touch without it. Sheer Force, alongside Life Orb, lets Nidoqueen OHKO or 2HKO most of the tier except the bulkiest of special walls. Still, Shuca Berry is a valid option to check Flygon and other Ground-types Nidoqueen lures in. 16 Defense EVs can be run with Shuca Berry so Nidoqueen isn't OHKOed by Outrage from Choice Band Flygon. Timid lets Nidoqueen speed tie opposing Nidoqueen and outspeed Modest variants. Modest does not miss out on other prevalent threats however, and the power is appreciated if your team can handle other Nidoqueen. 24 Special Defense EVs avoid the 2HKO from Xurkitree's Energy Ball.</p> <p>Heracross, Togekiss, and Pangoro can all take advantage of Nidoqueen's switch-ins such as Assault Vest Reuniclus and Umbreon. Pivots such as Crobat and Noivern can provide free switches with U-turn against Steel- and Rock-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Diancie. Crobat and Noivern also help check Fighting-types, which Nidoqueen can't reliably do on its own, as can Reuniclus and Galarian Weezing. Dark-types such as Umbreon, Incineroar, and Guzzlord can check Psychic-types such as Assault Vest Reuniclus and Celebi, while Steel-types such as Metagross and Escavalier can take on Calm Mind Reuniclus and Gardevoir. Umbreon deserves special mention, as it also keeps Nidoqueen healthy throughout the match with Wish. Electric- and Grass-types such as Xurkitree, Celebi, and Rotom-C take care of bulky Water-types, and Grass-types are also crucial for Electric-types like Xurkitree, Raikou, and Rotom-C, which can otherwise overwhelm Nidoqueen with either repeated strong attacks or super effective coverage. Water-types such as Milotic, Golisopod, and Vaporeon help with common Ground-types like Flygon. Golisopod also provides Spikes to help Nidoqueen out-damage Assault Vest Reuniclus's Regenerator healing and wear down other switch-ins like Umbreon, while, similarly to Umbreon, Vaporeon can heal it with Wish.</p> "

On the other hand, Taunt prevents one of its most common counters, Umbreon, from healing up with Wish and ultimately lets Nidoqueen beat it. Fire Blast 2HKOes Bronzong, which otherwise completely stonewalls Nidoqueen, but it's less prevalent than Nidoqueen's other counters. Thunderbolt is an option to 2HKO bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Jellicent, and Vaporeon after Stealth Rock. The 24 Special Defense EVs ensure Energy Ball from Xurkitree doesn't 2HKO Nidoqueen. Timid is preferred for opposing Nidoqueen, but a Modest nature nets extra power while only making Nidoqueen slower than niche threats like Decidueye and Tsareena.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Heracross, Pangoro, and Bewear can take advantage of Nidoqueen's usual answers, primarily Reuniclus and Umbreon. Special wallbreakers such as Starmie, Xurkitree, and Celebi especially appreciate Taunt Nidoqueen because it prevents special walls like Umbreon from healing. Pivots such as Crobat, Noivern, and Tornadus can provide free switches with U-turn against Steel- and Rock-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Diancie. The former two also help Nidoqueen check Fighting-types, which it can't do on its own, while the latter can help break through Umbreon with Superpower. Steel-types such as Registeel, Metagross, Stakataka, and Bronzong halt any Psychic-types like Gardevoir and Celebi trying to take advantage of Nidoqueen. Water-types such as Milotic, Golisopod, and Vaporeon can soak up hits from Ground-types such as Flygon. Golisopod also provides Spikes, which lets Nidoqueen push past Assault Vest Reuniclus without needing Toxic and more quickly whittle down Umbreon if Nidoqueen is running Toxic. Meanwhile, Vaporeon is noteworthy for its Wish support, which keeps Nidoqueen healthy throughout the match. Grass-types such as Celebi, Dhelmise, and Roserade can deal with Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon, and they help Nidoqueen check Electric-types such as Xurkitree, Raikou, and Rotom-C, which can otherwise overwhelm it with either repeated strong hits or super effective coverage.</p> "

Unfortunately, Vileplume can get worn down quickly and is often forced to use its recovery to remain healthy, which gives openings to Pokemon it invites in like Chandelure and common Flying-types such as Noivern and Togekiss. Strength Sap is Vileplume's main recovery move and allows it to lower the Attack stat of an opposing physical attacker. Corrosive Gas is used to remove important items such as Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Choice items from Pokemon such as Registeel, Crobat, and Toxtricity. Alternatively, Sleep Powder can be used to put common switch-ins such as Crobat and Noivern to sleep, generating free turns for itself and its teammates. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 SpD can be used to avoid a 4HKO from Xurkitree's Thunderbolt. Vileplume is best suited for balance teams that need a check for prominent physical attackers such as Sharpedo and Mimikyu. Due to Vileplume's weakness to Fire-types, bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can be great teammates. In return, Vileplume can handle offensive Electric-types such as Xurkitree and Raikou. Since Vileplume often invites in Flying-types like Crobat and Tornadus, checks to these Pokemon such as Xurkitree and Raikou are good partners. Registeel and Steelix also make great teammates for Vileplume, since they are able to check offensive Psychic-types such as Gardevoir. Since Vileplume often switches into pivots, taking damage from entry hazards can quickly wear it down and limit its defensive capabilities, so entry hazard removal from Starmie or Crobat is important.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Shell Smash Cloyster's ability to potentially break past its checks through flinches make it a threatening setup sweeper. It also takes advantage of teams relying on Seismitoad and Gastrodon as their bulky Water-type, as neither is a suitable Cloyster check. Rock Blast hits Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune neutrally, helping Cloyster beat them with flinches. It also hits Volcanion and can be used against other Fire-types like Incineroar and Chandelure. Hydro Pump is the preferred last move due to its greater damage against Steel-types such as Metagross, Cobalion, and Steelix. Liquidation can be used instead to OHKO Diancie and potentially 2HKO Registeel after Spikes damage while also giving Cloyster a more reliable Water-type STAB move. However, it makes Cloyster more reliant on breaking past the aforementioned Steel-types with flinches. King's Rock gives Cloyster's Icicle Spear and Rock Blast an effective 41% flinch chance. A Naive or Jolly nature should be used, as they allow +2 Cloyster to outrun Choice Scarf Mienshao. Explosion can be used to take down Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune for a teammate. Focus Sash can be used to almost guarantee setup, but this requires solid entry hazard removal, and Cloyster loses out on the ability to break past its checks with flinches. Life Orb is another item option that allows Cloyster to KO notable threats such as Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, Metagross, and Doublade at +2 without prior residual damage. Spikes allows Cloyster, which beats most Defoggers, to give value to its team in a matchup where it doesn't do much else. However, Spikes also forces Cloyster to ditch its Water-type STAB moves, which worsens its matchup against Steel-types significantly.</p> <p>Cloyster's natural physical bulk is impressive even without investment and gives it some notable setup opportunities against Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Crobat lacking Taunt, and Mimikyu. Cloyster is potentially capable of breaking past its defensive answers with flinches, but this requires a fair bit of luck. Bulky Water- and Steel-types can halt Cloyster barring an ill-timed flinch, so efforts should be put into wearing these Pokemon down. Most of the tier's bulky Steel-types will get worn down by Spikes; offensive Metagross, Cobalion, and Doublade will be in KO range of +2 Hydro Pump after switching in with three layers of Spikes, while Liquidation variants will be able to reliably 2HKO Registeel after two layers. Therefore, Spikes setters like Klefki and Roserade are good teammates. Cloyster's ability to take advantage of Spikes and cause its targets to flinch makes it a great choice for hyper offense teams, as it can be a devastating wincon or a supportive wallbreaker for another sweeping teammate such as Necrozma, Mimikyu, or Polteageist. Cloyster is also capable of sweeping on standard offensive and bulky offensive teams. Teams utilizing Cloyster in this regard should attempt to wear down bulky Water- and Steel-types. Knock Off from the likes of Incineroar, Reuniclus, and Obstagoon can remove Leftovers from Pokemon like Registeel and Suicune, making it easier for Cloyster to break through them. Pivoting teammates, such as Mienshao, Incineroar, and Crobat, can get Cloyster into battle safely. Toxic from Diancie and Salazzle can help wear down Water-types to let Cloyster go wild late-game.</p> "

Crobat is the tier's premier entry hazard removal option, as it checks the Spikes users Roserade, Heracross, and Golisopod, and it's highly practical to fit Defog on a Pokemon with already-good role compression. Crobat possesses many other great support moves like U-turn to support wallbreakers, Super Fang to weaken the likes of Registeel and Rhyperior, Toxic for crippling bulky switch-ins, and Taunt to prevent setup and recovery attempts. Crobat also has an excellent Nasty Plot set that threatens to sweep, and it can turn the tables on typical Steel- and Rock-type counters like Steelix, Registeel, and Rhyperior with boosted Heat Wave and Giga Drain. However, as a Defogger, Crobat has poor matchups against most Stealth Rock setters like Registeel, Steelix, and Metagross. Spikes Klefki is also generally good at taking advantage of teams relying on it. Moreover, Crobat's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots leaves it vulnerable to Knock Off from Pokemon it checks like Heracross and Golisopod. Nasty Plot Crobat's sweeps can often fall short due to its lack of power. The likes of Metagross, Incineroar, and Registeel can take even boosted attacks and leave it damaged enough for revenge killers like opposing Crobat and Choice Scarf Flygon.

        "description": "<p>Subtitute + Calm Mind Suicune relies on Pressure to wage a war of attrition on a number of Pokemon that can wall it such as Seismitoad, Gastrodon, and Mantine. Calm Mind makes it very hard for special attackers to break Suicune's Substitute and makes Scald much harder to switch into. Substitute provides Suicune with a way to protect itself from status effects, which will cripple sets lacking Rest, and is especially effective for PP stalling Pokemon unable to break its substitute in one hit. Note that Suicune must still be cautious not to switch into status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave from the likes of Registeel, Togekiss, and Klefki. Protect enables Suicune to scout Choice item users, stall out low PP moves, and gain additional Leftovers recovery. Ice Beam can be used to hit the likes of Zarude and Seismitoad after boosting, which are otherwise major threats. Roar is another option that allows Suicune to phaze out other setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage. The EV spread allows Suicune to outpace base 80 Speed Pokemon like Chandelure and Togekiss, while giving it an 81% chance that Seismitoad's Earthquake will not break its Substitute. An alternative spread with maximum Speed will allow Suicune to Speed tie with Heracross, but lowers its chances of its Substitute surviving Seismitoad's Earthquake to about 56%. This set lacks recovery other than Leftovers, so Suicune must be careful not to take Knock Off from Pokemon like Incineroar and Obstagoon without a Substitute up. Suicune must also be careful not to get hit by Trick from the likes of Darmanitan and Gardevoir, as it completely cripples this set.</p> <p>Suicune's natural bulk and typing make it a great choice for teams looking to check threats like Darmanitan, Alolan Marowak, and Metagross. Suicune's best check is Zarude, which can use Jungle Healing to remove any Scald burns and threaten Suicune with Power Whip. Therefore, it pairs well with Zarude checks like Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, and Togekiss. Cobalion has the added bonus of being an excellent Knock Off absorber thanks to Justified, while Galarian Weezing and Togekiss check other threats to Suicune like certain Guts Fighting-types such as Machamp and Heracross. The aforementioned Guts users, along with Obstagoon, pose a notable threat to Suicune because they are powerful enough to threaten Suicune and unafraid of burns from Scald. Sylveon or Togekiss notably can provide Heal Bell support to remedy this set's weakness to status effects. Suicune is also threatened by Electric-types like Xurkitree, Toxtricity, and Raikou, so it should be used alongside Electric-type checks such as Roserade, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Zarude, and Vileplume. Finally, Suicune lacking Roar is unable to beat certain Calm Mind sweepers with Psyshock like Reuniclus and Sigilyph, so it is wise to pair it with checks to them like Obstagoon and Chandelure.</p> "

        "description": "<p>This Suicune set is capable of sweeping given the right conditions. Rest allows this set to be extremely resilient to status and provides it with reliable recovery. Sleep Talk prevents Suicune from being passive while using Rest. Roar can be used over Sleep Talk in order to more reliably defeat other Calm Mind sweepers like Reuniclus and rack up entry hazard damage. This set runs enough Speed EVs to outpace Adamant Golurk and Jolly Alolan Marowak, then invests the rest in Defense and HP to be as hard to break through as possible. This, along with reliable recovery in Rest, makes it a much better answer to the likes of Darmanitan, Sharpedo, Cobalion, and Stakataka.</p> <p>Rest renders this set much less vulnerable to status effects and Knock Off, but it still has one major nemesis in the meta: Zarude. Zarude can use Jungle Healing to easily remove Scald burns, and this set lacks the safety net of Substitute to allow moves like Ice Beam to be effective. Checks to Zarude include Pokemon like Cobalion, Incineroar, Crobat, Noivern, and Togekiss. This set has difficulty setting up Calm Mind against offensive Electric-types like Xurkitree, Raikou, Heliolisk, and Toxtricity, so checks like Roserade, Zarude, Celebi, and Porgyon2 work well with it. Heliolisk has the added danger of Dry Skin causing Water-type moves to heal it, so Suicune must be played particularly carefully against it. If running Roar, Suicune can phaze foes into Spikes provided by Roserade, making it a particularly notable partner.</p> "

Especially notable is Celebi's U-turn weakness; despite being a check to Raikou and Xurkitree, Celebi can simply get hit by Volt Switch and then immediately get forced out by U-turn from Pokemon such as Crobat and Flygon. Celebi should also be weary of Shadow Ball when trying to check Raikou.</p> ",

Pollen Puff lets Celebi break past Dark- and Pychic-types such as Reuniclus and opposing Celebi; however, Pollen Puff is generally worse than Celebi's other options given the higher relative importance of Steel- and Water-types. Celebi can run an effective utility set of Grass Knot, Thunder Wave, Recover, and U-turn. Thunder Wave dissuades faster switch-ins like Crobat, while U-turn can take advantage of slower bulky switch-ins for powerful wallbreakers such as Pangoro.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Crobat, Noivern, and Togekiss threaten Celebi for massive damage.

Escavalier completely walls Celebi and can use it for easy wallbreaking opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Psychic- and Dark-types: Healthy Umbreon forces out even boosted Celebi, but it is likely 2HKOed by +2 Aura Sphere after Stealth Rock. Reuniclus walls Celebi lacking Leaf Storm, with Assault Vest Reuniclus even checking Leaf Storm Celebi. Guzzlord and specially defensive Incineroar can take Aura Sphere and force Celebi out, although they can get quickly worn down by Life Orb Celebi.

On more offensive or balance teams that do not require Celebi's longevity, Recover can be dropped for Leaf Storm.

    "overview": "<p>Ludicolo is a niche pick on rain teams in RU as a Swift Swim sweeper due to its ability to threaten annoying bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Suicune, and Milotic with Giga Drain. It also has perfect coverage to hit the tier for at least neutral damage, making it sometimes difficult to deal with it. However, Ludicolo is very dependent on rain to make up for its mediocre offensive presence; otherwise, it is very easy to check and revenge kill.

Many Pokemon can also revenge kill Ludicolo such as First Impression Golisopod, Trace Gardevoir, and Choice Scarf Flygon, even under rain.

Registeel and Bronzong can be 2HKOed by Weather Ball under rain after some chip damage, but they can cripple Ludicolo with Toxic. Once rain is over, these Pokemon deal with Ludicolo more easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority Users: Trace Gardevoir and Choice Scarf Flygon outspeed and revenge kill Ludicolo, even in rain. Golisopod OHKOes Ludicolo immediately with First Impression, while other priority users such as Lucario and Entei revenge kill Ludicolo once it is weakened enough.

It is also a threat to Ludicolo, since it takes both of Ludicolo's STAB moves easily and can either OHKO it with Gunk Shot or revenge kill with Sucker Punch.

Dragon Dance Flygon is an immense threat that can set up against common Pokemon like Raikou. A Choice Band set gives more immediate wallbreaking power, but it is easier to play around due to both of its STAB options having immunities. When it comes to support, Flygon is one of the best Defoggers in the tier thanks to its favorable matchup against most prevalent entry hazard setters like Rhyperior and Metagross. Choice Scarf Flygon can proudly claim to be the tier's fastest Choice Scarf user and is a reliable revenge killer. Flygon excels as a pivot and almost always carries U-turn if lacking Dragon Dance. However, its average base Attack stat leaves it struggling to break through common defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Milotic, even when boosted. Flygon's typing also gives it an exploitable weakness to Ice-type coverage.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Throat Chop is an option to hit Bronzong and comes with the bonus of blocking Sylveon's Hyper Voice, but it has no other use, and it takes up a moveslot over Outrage. Flygon has an expansive special movepool and a passable Special Attack stat, but both fully special and mixed sets tend to struggle to push past Togekiss. A bulky Dragon Dance set with Roost can take advantage of Flygon's great defensive typing to accumulate multiple boosts, but it struggles to break through bulky Water-types even more than fully offensive sets already do. Scale Shot is an alternative STAB option over Outrage that boosts Flygon's Speed, which is especially useful on Choice Band sets to both wallbreak and clean up late-game, but its inconsistent power makes it a less desirable choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Water-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Suicune are bulky enough to take even boosted attacks from Flygon and can KO back with Ice Beam, but they are 2HKOed by Choice Band Outrage on the switch and don't enjoy Toxic. Vaporeon has Heal Bell to heal off Toxic but struggles to reliably check Dragon Dance sets without Ice Beam. Unaware Quagsire hard counters Dragon Dance Flygon and can win against Choice Band sets with Curse.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Togekiss can comfortably take on defensive and Choice Scarf Flygon, especially if it's carrying Heal Bell, but it struggles greatly with Dragon Dance and Choice Band sets. Rarer bulky Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Levitate Galarian Weezing can take on any set with relative ease. Gardevoir can copy Levitate with Trace, making it immune to both of Flygon's STAB moves, and has a good chance to survive even a +1 Life Orb-boosted Stone Edge. Mimikyu can safely revenge kill Dragon Dance Flygon thanks to Disguise, but other sets can break its Disguise scot-free with U-turn. Slurpuff can use Flygon as fodder to set up Belly Drum.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Golisopod can revenge kill Flygon with First Impression after it's been weakened a bit. Other priority users like Lucario, Toxicroak, and Entei can also revenge kill Flygon but need it to be even more weakened beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, Vileplume, and Porygon2 have enough physical bulk to win the matchup against any of Flygon's sets, but they can't directly switch into its Choice Band set.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong: Bronzong completely walls Flygon because Levitate nullifies Earthquake and it resists Flygon's other moves. However, Bronzong can get worn down by repeatedly switching into U-turn, especially from Choice Band sets.</p> ",

Stone Edge is necessary to stand a chance of breaking through the most common Fairy-type Togekiss and also OHKOes Flying-types like Noivern and Crobat, saving Flygon from having to lock itself into Outrage. Life Orb is the preferred item to guarantee the OHKO on maximum HP Togekiss with +1 Stone Edge, but a Lum Berry can be used instead to set up on Pokemon like Raikou without being crippled by Toxic or a Scald burn. An Adamant nature can be used alongside Lum Berry to OHKO offensive Togekiss with boosted Stone Edge, but it sacrifices the Speed tie after a boost with opposing Choice Scarf Flygon.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Milotic are major roadblocks for Flygon's sweeps, as they can take one hit and KO back with Ice Beam. Pokemon such as Raikou, Metagross, and Incineroar can put them on a timer with Toxic, making them easier to wear down into range of Flygon's boosted attacks. Grass-types like Roserade and Celebi can switch into Water-types while also making up for Flygon struggling to check Electric-types such as Raikou and Xurkitree. Roserade also provides Spikes support to whittle down Flygon's checks and counters. Celebi, on the other hand, appreciates Flygon removing Togekiss and can provide free switches with U-turn. Strong priority users like Golisopod and Lucario need to be dealt with before Flygon can attempt a sweep. Togekiss can check Golisopod while softening up the opposing team for Flygon with its Nasty Plot set or provide valuable support with Heal Bell and Wish. Crobat and Talonflame can help against Lucario, while also providing free switches with U-turn on Steel- and Rock-types that Flygon can force out and set up on. Chandelure, Golisopod, and Incineroar take care of Bronzong, which completely walls Flygon.</p> "

Leftovers negates the damage from Stealth Rock and helps Flygon stay healthy throughout the match. Flygon can also forgo holding an item to nullify Poltergeist, which lets it soft check Pokemon like Golurk. 224 Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature are used to outspeed Mimikyu, and the Attack EVs ensure the OHKO on Chandelure with Earthquake.

Steel-types such as Metagross, Registeel, and Bronzong can take on Fairy-types such as Togekiss and Gardevoir. Flygon is unable to check Volcanion, unlike other Dragon-types like Noivern—Assault Vest Reuniclus, Gastrodon, and Starmie can patch up this weakness. Pokemon such as Noivern, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Golisopod enjoy Flygon putting the likes of Togekiss, Gastrodon, and Milotic on a timer with Toxic. Toxic-less Flygon invites Pokemon such as Togekiss and Noivern in for free, which Pokemon like Xurkitree, Rhyperior, and Metagross can take advantage of off of Flygon's U-turn. Entry hazards often significantly limit Assault Vest Reuniclus, Suicune, and Heracross, so they appreciate Flygon as a Defogger.</p> "

U-turn takes advantage of its switch-ins like Bronzong by providing free switches to teammates, and it's a risk-free option against teams with multiple Pokemon immune to its STAB moves.

  "Milotic": {
    "overview": "<p>Milotic is a solid all-purpose bulky Water-type in the RU tier. This is thanks to a great combination of mixed defenses, good movepool, decent Speed as a defensive Pokemon, and an ability that actually gives it a benefit from being hit by status moves. Flip Turn even allows Milotic to be used on faster-paced teams, as it becomes a bulky Pokemon that can actually build or maintain momentum. Milotic's ability to check powerful threats like Flygon, Rhyperior, Noivern, and Metagross is very welcome on many teams. However, Milotic finds itself in a tier where Electric- and Grass-types, such as Raikou, Heliolisk, Celebi, and Roserade, are incredibly potent. While Milotic's ability to take hits of all kinds is relatively uncommon for defensive Pokemon, it does mean that extremely powerful wallbreakers, such as Lucario and Heracross, can use their powerful STAB moves to brute force their way past Milotic.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Competitive set can be a Defog deterrent on Spikes stacking teams, as the common Defoggers do not generally fare well against a Milotic with boosted Ice Beam. Marvel Scale might make Flame Orb strategies look appealing, but the constant chip damage forces Milotic to use Recover way too often.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: RU is not short on Electric-types, and all of them can simply push past Milotic's defenses with powerful STAB moves. Raikou and Xurkitree aren't scared of Scald nor hindered too badly by a potential Toxic, as they rarely stay in long. Toxtricity is more vulnerable to Flip Turns as it switches in due to its much lower Speed, but similarly threatens out Milotic if it safely switches in and is immune to Toxic. Heliolisk is perhaps the worst enemy of Milotic thanks to Dry Skin even cutting off Milotic's ability to pivot out with Flip Turn as Heliolisk switches in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Celebi, Roserade, and Decidueye easily handle Milotic. Celebi's Natural Cure can make Toxic and Scald burns a non-factor for it, while Roserade's Natural Cure and secondary Poison typing work similarly. Both can utilize their powerful Grass-type STAB moves to eliminate Milotic. To make matters worse, Celebi can set up Nasty Plot, while Roserade can litter the field with Spikes to undermine Milotic's bulk later on.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Milotic's good but not spectacular mixed bulk means that very powerful wallbreakers can push past it. Guts Heracross, Swords Dance Lucario, and Nasty Plot Togekiss are all strong enough to overcome Milotic with powerful neutral STAB moves.</p> ",

Flip Turn generally is preferred to generate and maintain momentum as a defensive Pokemon, something that is generally uncommon. This is especially helpful on faster-paced teams that would rather have Milotic stay a step ahead of threats like Raikou and Roserade. Ice Beam prevents Grass-types from switching into Milotic as freely, discouraging Roserade from using Spikes freely. It also OHKOs Noivern and Flygon. Toxic is able to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Gastrodon and opposing Milotic, which can help Milotic's more offensive teammates push past them. It also is great for chipping away at common switch-ins like Raikou and Xurkitree. Haze is a great alternative that allows Milotic to stall out Substitute + Protect variants of Suicune lacking Toxic as well as prevent Calm Mind Reuniclus and Cosmic Power Metagross from taking advantage of Milotic's low damage output. On more defensive teams, Haze is a solid option over Flip Turn or Ice Beam, as these teams generally don't care as much about momentum as they do about covering as many offensive threats as possible. Milotic's 88 Speed EVs enable it to outpace Adamant Incineroar and Bewear.</p> <p>As Milotic is a defensive Pokemon that can maintain momentum, it can work on faster-paced teams that appreciate having it as a defensive backbone when they're forced out by certain Pokemon. Xurkitree and Raikou are powerful Electric-types that can threaten the majority of the tier and appreciate Milotic being able to bring them in safely. VoltTurn cores with the likes of Flygon, Incineroar, Xurkitree, and Heliolisk are also powerful on more offensive teams that aim to maintain momentum. Roserade is a great check to most Electric-types, can spare Milotic from Toxic from bulky Water-types, and litter the field with Spikes to amplify the effects of Flip Turn. In return, Milotic is able to check offensive Steel-types and multiple Fire-types. Registeel is able to set up Stealth Rock, check Gardevoir and most Electric- and Grass-types, and appreciates Milotic being able to switch into most Fire- and Ground-types looking to take on Registeel. Crobat and Togekiss are able to take on the likes of  Heracross and Pangoro for Milotic.

Metagross's lack of reliable recovery means that its good bulk and resistances can only take it so far when it comes to taking hits.

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>Roserade has found its place in RU as a Spiker that is able to stand up to the top Electric-types Raikou and Xurkitree. Once it switches in, its good STAB combination can be difficult for teams without a particularly bulky Steel- or Poison-type to handle. Its Spikes support is greatly appreciated by wallbreakers and setup sweepers, as it helps to wear down their conventional checks. Additionally, Natural Cure Roserade is one of the best switch-ins to bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, being able to negate Scald burns. However, Roserade's low Defense and average Speed are easily exploited by physical attackers such as Metagross, Flygon, and Choice Scarf Heracross. While Roserade's main opportunities to switch in are against Pokemon such as Raikou, Xurkitree, and Milotic, these Pokemon can easily pivot out with Volt Switch or Flip Turn. Roserade is also pressured by common Flying-types such as Crobat and Noivern, which KO it with their STAB moves immediately or after a bit of prior damage.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb can be used with Leaf Storm to provide greater damage output and threatens to OHKO threats such as Nidoqueen and Bewear while also doing more damage against Steel-types such as Metagross and Steelix. However, this comes at the cost of being more vulnerable to Electric-types due to Life Orb recoil. Grass Knot is an alternative Grass-type STAB move that provides consistent damage against Pokemon such as Stakataka, Suicune, and Raikou. However, it does not provide recovery like Giga Drain and does not have as much damage potential as Leaf Storm. Shadow Ball hits some of Roserade's conventional checks in Chandelure, Bronzong, and Metagross, while Extrasensory hits Poison-types such as Crobat, Toxicroak, Salazzle, and Toxtricity. However, they require Roserade to give up an important utility move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Assault Vest Reuniclus: Assault Vest Reuniclus is able to switch into Roserade's attacks with impunity. However, it is susceptible to being worn down by Roserade's Spikes and poison from Sludge Bomb, and it has to watch out for Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Metagross and Registeel can switch into Roserade's attacks fairly freely and are immune to Sludge Bomb. However, they are prone to getting worn down by Spikes, have to watch out for Sleep Powder, and have no form of reliable recovery to offset any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Fast Flying-types: Fast Flying-types such as Crobat and Noivern can be huge nuisances to Roserade, as they outspeed it and can threaten it with STAB moves. However, Noivern is unable to switch in directly, as Sludge Bomb does a lot of damage and can poison it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Chandelure and Entei threaten Roserade massively with their Fire-type STAB moves, while it is unable to OHKO them. However, they cannot act as direct switch-ins, as Sludge Bomb does decent damage and can limit their effectiveness in the long run with poison.</p> ",

On the other hand, Leaf Storm pressures checks such as Metagross and Stakataka with Spikes up while also OHKOing offensive threats such as Xurkitree. Synthesis allows Roserade to more reliably check Raikou and Xurkitree. On the other hand, Sleep Powder is able to net free turns for teammate wallbreakers or setup sweepers. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps entry hazards from pressuring Roserade into repeatedly using Synthesis. However, on teams with sufficient entry hazard control, Black Sludge can be considered to provide Roserade with extra recovery, which can help it take attacks more comfortably.</p> <p>Roserade is unable to hit most Steel-types, including Metagross and Registeel, for any meaningful damage. Therefore, Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Pangoro and Heracross make for good partners. They also greatly appreciate Roserade's Spikes support and ability to handle bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune. Late-game sweepers such as Sharpedo and Tyrantrum also appreciate Roserade's Spikes support weakening their checks. In order to increase the effectiveness of Spikes, Knock Off users such as Incineroar and Heracross are necessary to remove Heavy-Duty Boots. Rock- and Steel-types such as Diancie, Stakataka, and Registeel check Flying-types, which threaten to easily KO Roserade and remove Spikes with Defog. Fire-types such as Chandelure and Entei are a huge nuisance to Roserade, so bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Gastrodon complement it nicely. Gastrodon's ability to check Electric-types and block Volt Switch alleviates pressure from Roserade and prevents it from getting too worn down throughout the course of the game, especially if it chooses to run Sleep Powder over Synthesis.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon has won its title as a strong blanket check in RU by solidly handling Raikou, Steel-types, certain Water-types, and certain Fire-types like Entei and Salazzle as well as by checking various weaker attackers like Noivern in a pinch. Recover gives it great longevity, and Clear Smog can be used to hold off bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus, which has pretty few surefire answers. Its solid coverage in Earth Power alongside Ice Beam or Scald keeps it from a being particularly easy wall for offensive teams to switch into. However, many of the Pokemon it can switch into run Toxic or Knock Off, so it will often be under pressure from passive damage, especially when used as a blanket check on more offensive teams. These conditions will force Gastrodon to use Recover at predictable times, which will give up offensive momentum. It's forced out by the powerful and common Grass-types Celebi and Roserade, which can set up Nasty Plot or Spikes.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Using Sticky Hold as Gastrodon's ability is feasible if you don't expect to face Water-types, or if your team's counterplay to them is very solid overall; it makes Gastrodon a solid Knock Off absorber against weaker users like Incineroar and Salazzle. Curse lets Gastrodon beat Psyshock + Calm Mind Reuniclus and present a late-game threat, but it's vulnerable to faster special attackers, status ailments, and critical hits.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon and Coverage: Grass is naturally the best way to immediately threaten a Water / Ground type like Gastrodon. Roserade, Celebi, and Dhelmise are RU's main Grass-types and make various forms of progress as Gastrodon is forced out, though none like switching into Ice Beam and some fear Scald burns. Grass-type coverage on other Pokemon, including Energy Ball Xurkitree and Chandelure, easily takes Gastrodon out.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage and Offensive Pressure: Gastrodon's solid typing and bulk make it difficult for most Pokemon to quickly and safely defeat, but many of the Pokemon it checks can hit it with Toxic on the switch like Metagross and Rhyperior. Toxic poison limits how long Gastrodon can stay in, forces it to spend more turns using Recover, and makes it easier for Pokemon to 2HKO with neutral attacks. Using Leftovers or losing Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off causes entry hazard damage to similarly accumulate.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon with Recovery: Toxic Gastrodon is setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus and most Suicune, while Clear Smog Gastrodon cannot pressure other walls like Milotic and Togekiss.

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzong's unique access to Levitate sets it apart from its Steel-type competition and lets it check many top-tier Pokemon such as Metagross, Nidoqueen, and Flygon. Furthermore, Levitate prevents Spikes from wearing Bronzong down, and it resists Stealth Rock, which lets it fit and perform without issue on teams lacking solid entry hazard control. Bronzong's main appeal is the role compression it provides, but simultaneously serving as a bulky Steel-type, checking Ground-types, and maintaining Stealth Rock can quickly overwhelm it. Bronzong can struggle to keep Stealth Rock up against common Defoggers and spinners like Dhelmise and Starmie; however, it works wonders against others like Flygon and Crobat. Bronzong's typing has many upsides, but it comes with nasty weaknesses to the common Dark- and Ghost-types and the ever-so-prevalent Knock Off. On top of that, Bronzong's low Attack stat means that it's complete setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus and it gives wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Golurk, and Bewear free switches in. If Bronzong's Ground immunity isn't needed, then it's generally outdone by other bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Steelix, which have far greater Special Defense, more offensive presence, and better defensive typing, respectively.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A fully physically defensive EV spread could be used to handle Pokemon like Metagross and Flygon even better but makes the matchup against Gardevoir, Noivern, and Electric-types significantly worse. Protect is an option to scout Choice-locked foes like Golurk and gain extra Leftovers recovery, but it's hard to fit over Toxic and Earthquake. Hypnosis can be used over Toxic on more offensive teams to provide either safe switch-ins or setup opportunities to its offensive teammates. It also prevents Bronzong from being completely helpless against Calm Mind Reuniclus, but it's generally too inconsistent to be worth it. Iron Defense + Body Press gives Bronzong a more offensive presence and can potentially sweep ill-prepared teams, but such sets are hard-pressed to choose between Toxic to cripple Ghost-types and a Steel-type move for Nasty Plot Togekiss. Bronzong has another stellar ability in Heatproof, but the most common Fire-types—Incineroar and Chandelure—all carry moves that get by Heatproof, and Pokemon such as Choice Specs Gardevoir can run other coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Psychic is an option to hit Poison- and Fighting-types like Crobat, Vileplume, and Toxicroak, but Bronzong most often prefers its listed attacks. Trick alongside Choice Band could cripple bulky switch-ins such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, but Bronzong sorely misses Leftovers recovery.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Calm Mind Reuniclus: Bronzong is complete setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus, as its attacks will barely leave a scratch and Toxic doesn't deal damage due to Magic Guard.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Incineroar, Guzzlord, Pangoro, and Sharpedo all pose a huge threat to Bronzong. The former three can even switch in on Bronzong to varying degrees. Incineroar's Intimidate reduces even Earthquake to pitiful damage, Guzzlord takes little from any attacks, and Pangoro takes next to nothing from Heavy Slam. Umbreon completely walls Bronzong, can heal itself of Toxic with Heal Bell, and can pass a Wish to a more offensive teammate.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Golurk, and Decidueye all threaten Bronzong with their strong STAB moves. Golurk also takes nothing from Heavy Slam, so it can often hard switch into Bronzong. Chandelure needs to watch out for Earthquake, but besides that, it can switch into Bronzong. Dhelmise can switch in and further remove Bronzong's Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Polteageist and Doublade can set up against Bronzong without much trouble. Mimikyu can set up on Bronzong due to Disguise. However, none of them, besides Doublade, enjoy getting badly poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off And Corrosive Gas: Bronzong's only form of recovery is Leftovers, so losing it is detrimental to its longevity. Golisopod, Tornadus, and Assault Vest Reuniclus can all threaten to remove its Leftovers with Knock Off. Corrosive Gas Vileplume is especially troublesome because a good amount of teams with Bronzong lack good additional switch-ins to it, thus forcing Bronzong to accept losing its item.</p> <p><strong>Starmie: Starmie poses a real nuisance to Bronzong, as it can switch into any of Bronzong's moves without much care and remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Moreover, Starmie doesn't mind Toxic thanks to Natural Cure, heals off any damage it takes with Recover, and can threaten Bronzong with a potential Scald burn or safely switch a wallbreaker onto the field with Teleport.</p> ",

    "overview": "<p>With an excellent Special Attack stat, decent Speed tier, and excellent offensive typing, Chandelure solidifies itself as a dangerous wallbreaker in the RU metagame. Its STAB moves hit almost the whole tier for exceptional damage, and it can help its own cause with utility moves like Toxic to further damage and strengthen Hex against threats like Togekiss and Milotic. Furthermore, despite a shallow movepool, Chandelure has access to Energy Ball, which lets it hit Pokemon like Gastrodon, Milotic, and Suicune. Unfortunately, it struggles against special walls like Snorlax and Umbreon and common Dark-types like Sharpedo and Incineroar either outspeed Chandelure or can take advantage of Hex and offensively pressure it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chandelure can run utility moves like Calm Mind, Substitute, Pain Split, and Taunt, but Calm Mind requires a difficult turn of setup, Substitute results in lost HP that Chandelure can't get back, and Pain Split and Taunt can directly or indirectly cost Chandelure HP. Choice Specs Chandelure can deal even more massive damage than normal; however, it's vulnerable to Stealth Rock and other entry hazards. Using Choice Scarf lets it outspeed threats like Obstagoon, Raikou, and Noivern, 2HKOing Noivern even if Stealth Rock isn't up. Flame Charge can be used to get a Speed advantage over threats like non-Choice Scarf Flygon and Crobat, but this means that Chandelure must give up either Toxic, Energy Ball, or Protect.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Sharpedo and Incineroar offensively pressure Chandelure with their respective STAB moves. The latter does not want to be poisoned by Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Snorlax and Umbreon eat up and recover from anything Chandelure sends their way.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Suicune and Milotic can shake even Energy Ball off, restore their HP, and force Chandelure out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers: Raikou, Flygon, and Starmie are just a few faster Pokemon that force Chandelure out due to their superior Speed.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Regidrago, Noivern, and Flygon use their Fire resistance to check Chandelure and either deal significant damage to it or set up on it.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Although its fragility and typing give it limited switch-in opportunities, Chandelure's exceptional Special Attack and nearly unresisted STAB combination make it extremely difficult to switch into, and it is effective at spreading status to wear down its checks. Shadow Ball is preferred for its immediate and consistent power, but Hex can be effective to break down Fire-resistant Pokemon more quickly, especially with teammates that can spread status. Either Toxic or Will-O-Wisp can be used, although Toxic is generally preferred for its ability to inflict more damage and hit Incineroar. Energy Ball is useful specifically for Gastrodon, OHKOing it; however, once it is statused, it requires only a little chip to KO with Hex. Protect lets Chandelure scout Choice-locked switch-ins such as Flygon and stall statused foes.</p> <p>Chandelure is extremely effective at forcing chip damage onto bulky Water-types, which teammates like Flygon, Sharpedo, and Barbaracle appreciate. Togekiss and Heracross can also switch into Dark-types that revenge kill it, and Celebi, Roserade, and Assault Vest Reuniclus can take on the Water-types that sometimes force it out. Since Chandelure's Hex is twice as strong against statused foes, teammates that spread status, such as Gastrodon, Togekiss, and Toxic Metagross, make it even more threatening. Chandelure also appreciates U-turn support, notably from Crobat and the aforementioned Celebi, to bring it into battle safely against Steel-types. Its middling Speed means it can be forced out by faster special attackers, such as Raikou and Starmie. Offensive checks to them such as Choice Scarf Heracross and Celebi can therefore be useful. Knock Off users like Pangoro and the aforementioned Heracross can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that rely on it to switch into Chandelure like Noivern.</p> "

Unlike other Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Decidueye, Golurk easily breaks through common Ghost-resistant and -immune foes like Umbreon, Incineroar, and Snorlax with Close Combat and Earthquake. Even though Golurk is not a fast Pokemon, it is still fast enough to outspeed common defensive threats such as Reuniclus, Registeel, and Diancie. Nevertheless, Golurk's low Speed and weaknesses to common offensive typings such as Grass, Water, and Ghost make it struggle to find switch-in opportunities, and it is easily revenge killed by faster threats such as Roserade, Xurkitree, and Chandelure. Golurk also struggles against potential itemless Pokemon such as Flygon and Xatu due to Poltergeist failing against them. This complicates the teambuilding process due to its incompatibility with Knock Off users. Golurk faces competition from other Ghost- and Ground-types such as Chandelure, Dhelmise, and Flygon, as they are either faster, easier to integrate into the team, or provide more utility. Unlike other Ground-types, Golurk is unable to check common Electric-types like Raikou and Xurkitree due to their super effective coverage moves and higher Speed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Ice Punch is an option to better deal with Flying-types and itemless defensive Flygon, but it does not have much use outside of this. A Rock Polish set with Life Orb turns Golurk into a strong late-game sweeper; however, it is often outclassed by Mimikyu and Polteageist, as they have more setup opportunities and are harder to revenge kill. Golurk can function as a Stealth Rock setter, but it prefers running coverage moves to punch holes in the opposing team. Dynamic Punch has a tempting secondary effect and can be used over Close Combat, but Golurk prefers the extra power from Close Combat to OHKO Ghost-resistant or -immune walls such as Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2. Choice Scarf Golurk has a good matchup against offense teams and can lure threats such as Xurkitree, Raikou, and Celebi. Unfortunately, this set loses much of its wallbreaking power and is often outclassed by other Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Chandelure due to their higher Speed stat and, in the case of Flygon, utility in U-turn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Bulky Dark-types such as Umbreon and Incineroar can reliably switch into Golurk's Poltergeist and threaten it with their Dark-type STAB moves. However, Golurk KOes every Dark-type with Close Combat or, Incineroar's case, with both Earthquake and Close Combat, so they must be careful of switching in. Offensive Dark-types such as Swords Dance Incineroar and Sharpedo can easily revenge kill Golurk with their strong STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Due to Golurk's low Speed and common weaknesses, faster Pokemon such as Pangoro, Roserade, and Chandelure can revenge kill it. Pokemon with super effective coverage such as Energy Ball Xurkitree, Shadow Ball Raikou, and Darkest Lariat Bewear can also revenge kill Golurk.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types: Normal-types such as Snorlax, Porygon2, and Bewear are immune to Poltergeist and take advantage of Golurk if it locks into that move. However, they must watch out for its coverage moves, specifically Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Itemless Pokemon</strong>: Golurk's greatest strength is its strong Poltergeist, which is why it struggles against Pokemon that run no item or lose it over the course of the battle. Defensive Flygon, Reuniclus, and Xatu run no item to better switch into Golurk. White Herb Polteageist and Barbaracle will lose their item over the course of the battle, which enables them to switch into Poltergeist or take advantage of Golurk once it is locked into this move. Lastly, if Golurk's team decides to have a Knock Off user, it is important to know that every opposing Pokemon will be immune to Poltergeist once they lose their item.</p> ",

On a team with Knock Off support, Stone Edge is an option to hit Flying-types such as Noivern and Togekiss. No Guard gives Golurk a perfectly accurate Poltergeist, while Iron Fist should only be run alongside Shadow Punch to increase its strength.</p> <p>Golurk is a great wallbreaker for balance and bulky offense teams, but it is important to keep in mind that these teams should have minimal Knock Off users. Golurk appreciates reliable pivots such as Xurkitree, Porygon2, and Heliolisk, since it struggles to find switch-in opportunities. Noivern and Crobat often lure bulky Steel- and Rock-types like Registeel, Bronzong, and Diancie for Golurk takes advantage of. They are also good checks to Grass-types like Roserade and Celebi. Normal- and bulky Dark-types such as Porygon2, Snorlax, Umbreon, and Incineroar prevents Poltergeist from being used freely. Fighting-types such as Lucario, Heracross, and Bewear are practical teammates to check these Pokemon offensively; Toxic Spikes and Spikes setters like Roserade, Klefki, and Golisopod also help punish them. Despite its typing, Golurk is not a great check to RU's best Electric-types in Raikou and Xurkitree. Therefore, a reliable check to them such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Celebi, or Roserade is recommended. These Pokemon also provide Future Sight or entry hazard support. Since itemless Flygon is the best defensive switch-in to Golurk, pairing Golurk with offensive answers to it, such as Noivern, Starmie, and Gardevoir, is recommendable. Strong late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Heracross, Gardevoir, and Sharpedo appreciate Golurk's wallbreaking capabilities, while Golurk appreciates their capability to deal with more offensive teams, which it struggles with.</p> "

Knock Off allows Tornadus to weaken its typical switch-ins such as Raikou, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Registeel by removing their items. U-turn allows Tornadus to gain momentum and pivot out of disadvantageous matchups. Tailwind is a great move to support slower teammates or give them more sweeping potential. Heat Wave, on the other hand, gives Tornadus a better matchup versus Steel-types such as Metagross, Steelix, and Klefki. Even though Tornadus is not the best defogger in RU, its ability to remove entry hazards safely due to its Prankster Defog can be useful in important situations. Taunt is an option to cripple passive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Umbreon and to prevent Pokemon such as Barbaracle and Snorlax from setting up on it. Rain Dance turns Tornadus into a secondary rain setter for rain teams.

Weather Ball is to be used on rain teams, as the boosted Water-type coverage lets Tornadus reliably break through Pokemon such as Xurkitree, Incineroar, and Diancie after a boost. Outside of rain, Focus Blast is Tornadus's strongest option against various targets like Umbreon, Snorlax, Diancie, and Stakataka. Grass Knot hits Milotic and Suicune hardest, while also being an accurate option for other threats like Gastrodon and Golurk. However, Grass Knot covers much less important targets than Tornadus's other coverage, notably even the lightweight Diancie takes negligible damage, and the aforementioned bulky Water-types are all hit hard by Hurricane anyways.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Tornadus has a niche in RU as a strong wallbreaker on many archetypes, especially on rain and hyper offense teams. Strong physical attackers such as Obstagoon, Metagross, and Heracross are great teammates, as they deal with specially defensive Pokemon such as Diancie, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Snorlax that Tornadus struggles with. Spikes and Toxic Spikes support from the likes of Klefki, Roserade, and Dragalge are also a great way to wear down these specially defensive Pokemon. The aforementioned two are also able to check Raikou and Xurkitree. Bulky Pokemon such as Milotic, Porygon2, and Assault Vest Reuniclus give Tornadus a reliable defensive backbone, since Tornadus is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users, such as Noivern, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan.

Strong late-game sweepers such as Choice Scarf Heracross, Xurkitree, and Sharpedo appreciate Tornadus' ability to weaken opponent's team. Tornadus fits well on rain teams, where Politoed is a necessary teammate. Kabutops and Kingdra as strong rain sweepers overwhelm bulkier Pokemon alongside Tornadus. In return, Tornadus checks bulky Water- and Grass-types. Lastly, Tornadus can also be used on dual screens teams, where the screens support give it more setup opportunities. Klefki can set up ideal conditions for Tornadus with dual screens and Spikes. Other strong setup sweepers such as Linoone, Cloyster, and Necrozma are great choices to overwhelm opposing teams.</p> "

However, Talonflame is able to check Mimikyu and certain Steel-types such as Metagross and Steelix well, unlike its Flying-type competition.

Will-O-Wisp allows Talonflame to cripple common Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Stakataka, Steel-types like Lucario and Steelix, and setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Flygon and Swords Dance Mimikyu. U-turn is helpful to keep momentum and bring in frailer wallbreakers and other teammates. Flare Blitz and Toxic can be run over Brave Bird and Will-O-Wisp to make Talonflame more immediately threatening to Steel-types and Electric-types; Toxic also makes it harder for Water-types to handle it.

Swords Dance Talonflame still struggles to break past most bulky Water- and Rock-types and loses immense utility by not having U-turn or Will-O-Wisp, however. 240 Speed EVs let Talonflame outspeed Ribombee. While an offensive EV spread is preferred, Talonflame can alternatively run a physically defensive EV spread of 16 HP / 252 Def / 240 Spe to more reliably check Lucario, Dhelmise, and Metagross, but it gives up the ability to guarantee a 2HKO on Chandelure.</p> <p>Talonflame cannot do much to the many Rock- and Water-type Pokemon like Diancie, Milotic, and Gastrodon in the tier, so Celebi, Milotic, and Roserade make good teammates that are able to switch in and threaten these Pokemon.

White Herb can be used over Life Orb because it removes the Defense and Special Defense drops after a Shell Smash, which allows Barbaracle to not take as much damage when setting up. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Choice Scarf Flygon after a Shell Smash.</p> <p>Barbaracle mainly fits on hyper offense teams, as it appreciates it checks to be quickly run over for an easy sweep or breaks for its teammates to clean up. Barbaracle likes to have dual screens support from the likes of Klefki so that it can get more opportunities to set up. Entry hazard support from Golisopod, Roserade, and the aforementioned Klefki can also be helpful so Barbaracle can wear down Pokemon Milotic and Sturdy Steelix, making it easier to secure an OHKO. Misty Terrain support from Galarian Weezing can be run alongside dual screens support because it negates the effect of status so Barbaracle can safely set up on Pokemon like Togekiss and Milotic. Water-types like Milotic and Suicune can stop Barbaracle's attempt at a sweep, so Pokemon to weaken or set upon them such as Lucario, Shift Gear Toxtricity, and Dragon Dance Regidrago make for great teammates. Pokemon that can threaten and set up on Grass-types like the aforementioned Toxtricity and Regidrago make helpful teammates. Fairy-types like Mimikyu are also helpful teammates, since they are able to use Fighting-types as setup bait.</p> "

Unfortunately, it has no reliable recovery, mediocre physical bulk, and a typing leaving it weak to common threats such as Metagross and Noivern. Flip Turn allows Dragalge to pivot out on its typical switch-ins such as Registeel and Klefki, gain momentum, and bring teammates safely onto the battlefield. Toxic Spikes helps to wear down bulky Pokemon such as Milotic, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Porygon2 for teammates. Scald can be used instead, however, to hit Steelix and Stakataka super effectively and have a good chance to punish switch-ins such as Registeel and Metagross with a burn. However, in most cases Dragalge will use Flip Turn against switch-ins rather than Scald. Protect alongside Black Sludge is an option to gain free turns of recovery and scout moves from Choice item users, although it makes Dragalge slightly more passive. 68 Speed EVs let Dragalge outspeed Incineroar, while 252 HP EVs enable it to better check special attackers such as Raikou, Xurkitree, and Chandelure. The remaining EVs alongside a Modest nature give Dragalge a better offensive presence. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazard damage to make Dragalge a more reliable pivot. However, Black Sludge can be used instead for extra passive recovery, even without Protect.</p> <p>Since Dragalge baits bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Klefki, and Metagross onto the battlefield and pivots out on them with Flip Turn, Pokemon that take advantage of said Steel-types such as Heracross and Chandelure are great teammates. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Celebi, Flygon, and Xurkitree form a good VoltTurn core with Dragalge and also bait Fairy- and Fire-types such as Togekiss, Galarian Weezing, Incineroar, and Roserade onto the battlefield, of which Dragalge takes advantage. Bulky Steel-types like Steelix and Metagross are good teammates to take on Dragon-, Psychic-, and Ice-types like Noivern, Indeedee, and Cloyster. Golisopod and Celebi can form a good hazard stacking core with Dragalge, and serve as Ground-type resistances. Pokemon such as Substitute + Calm Mind Raikou, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Suicune benefit from Dragalge's Toxic Spikes wearing down their typical checks and counters. An entry hazard remover like Noivern, Togekiss, or Starmie is helpful if Dragalge is not running Heavy-Duty Boots, since entry hazards limit its pivoting. Sylveon and Umbreon provide Wish support, increasing Dragalge's longevity.</p> "

Close Combat hits Steel-types such as Registeel, Steelix, and Stakataka as well as Bewear harder than any other move. Earthquake complements Close Combat nicely, hitting the other bulky Steel-types such as Klefki, Doublade, and Metagross as well as Nidoqueen super effectively.

Toxtricity in particular supports Tyrantrum with Volt Switch and can overwhelm Steel- and Ground-types that check Tyrantrum. Since bulky Steel-types like Registeel, Metagross, and Steelix discourage the use of Head Smash, Pokemon that weaken them such as Chandelure, Xurkitree, and Nidoqueen are important teammates. Grass-types such as Roserade and Celebi take on Gastrodon and Quagsire while Gastrodon, Milotic, and Togekiss take on defensive Flygon that complicate the use of Head Smash too. Spikes support from the likes of Roserade, Golisopod, or Klefki is also helpful to wear down the aforementioned bulky Steel- and Ground-types. Bulky Pokemon such as Reuniclus, Milotic, and Steelix take hits for Tyrantrum, since it's easily revenge killed once the opponent gets a free switch. A strong priority user like Golisopod, Entei, and Lucario can be useful to have in the background, since Choice Scarf Tyrantrum is unable to revenge kill faster setup sweepers such as Sharpedo, Dragon Dance Flygon, and Cloyster as well as opposing Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Flygon.</p> "

As a Defogger, Noivern has some of the better matchups against common entry hazard setters, being able to threaten Golisopod, Steelix, and Roserade but struggling with Stakataka, Diancie, and Registeel. Noivern's defensive utility is greatly diminished by its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can't switch in on Pokemon such as Incineroar, Seismitoad, and Golisopod without the risk of getting hit by Knock Off. Furthermore, Noivern's mediocre Special Attack means it barely scratches special walls like Diancie, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Umbreon while also leaving it as setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus, Suicune, and Nasty Plot Togekiss. However, Noivern can circumvent its switch-ins by providing a free switch for powerful wallbreakers with U-turn.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Frisk can be chosen to scout items due to the situational use of Infiltrator. Toxic can cripple common switch-ins to Noivern such as Togekiss, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. With Toxic, Noivern can also act as a hard stop to Calm Mind + Substitute Suicune thanks to Infiltrator. However, using Toxic means giving up on the great utility provided by U-turn or Defog, which is difficult to justify on most teams. A stallbreaker set with Taunt prevents Bronzong and Registeel from setting Stealth Rock and walls like Milotic, Togekiss, and Snorlax from healing. Generally, Hurricane is the preferred STAB option alongside Taunt because it gives better odds of beating Calm Mind Suicune. Switcheroo can be run alongside Choice Scarf to cripple Noivern's switch-ins such as Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. Swapping items with bulky set-up Pokemon like Snorlax, Reuniclus, and Suicune neutralizes their attempts at a sweep. Noivern is also the fastest Choice Scarf user in RU and can even outspeed and revenge kill +2 Cloyster. However, Choice Scarf sets are greatly limited by Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn pivots like Crobat, Flygon, and Celebi. It can also be used alongside Taunt to always beat Registeel. The big downfall with Rocky Helmet is that it also leaves Noivern vulnerable to Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Diancie, and Grimmsnarl wall Noivern. Diancie is especially troublesome for Defog Noivern because it can freely switch in on the turn Noivern uses Defog and set Stealth Rock again. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can revenge kill Noivern, and Mimikyu can use Defog sets as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2 take very little damage from Noivern's attacks. Reuniclus can set up Future Sight or remove an item with Knock Off, Umbreon gets a free Wish for itself or its teammates, Snorlax sets up Curse, and Porygon2 pivots out with Teleport or cripples something with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf users: Choice Scarf users such as Flygon, Gardevoir, Heracross, and Xurkitree can revenge kill Noivern from full or after a slight bit of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Certain Steel-types like Registeel, Stakataka, Bronzong, and Klefki can take Flamethrower from Noivern multiple times.

However, the former struggles to switch in, since it takes good damage from Diancie's Body Press. Defensive Steel-types such as Steelix and Bronzong take less from Body Press and OHKO Diancie with either Heavy Slam or Gyro Ball. If Registeel lacks Heavy Slam, the best it can do is weaken Diancie with Toxic. Despite being able to OHKO Diancie with Gyro Ball, Stakataka is slower then it and takes a lot from Body Press, especially offensive variants. However, every mentioned Steel-type stumbles as soon as Diancie has a Defense increase from Diamond Storm, since they take more damage from Body Press and cause less damage to it. Doublade easily uses Diancie as setup fodder due its typing and high physical bulk, but Doublade is very uncommon and must watch out for Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Nidoqueen and Golurk do heavy damage to Diancie with their powerful STAB moves and easily switch into it, since they take little from its attacks; only Golurk dislikes Toxic. Flygon can pressure Diancie with its strong Earthquake but can lose the matchup if Diancie's Defense is boosted through Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Roserade and Rotom-C threaten Diancie with their powerful Grass-type STAB attacks but fail to OHKO Diancie and take a lot from its Diamond Storm. Nasty Plot Celebi with Recover uses Diancie as setup fodder, but utility variants have a rather shaky matchup against it, since Grass Knot does not do much to it. Dhelmise has a high chance to OHKO Diancie and can remove Stealth Rock through Rapid Spin. Bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume have nothing to fear from Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Milotic, and Suicune have little to fear from Diancie's attacks and threaten it with either a burn through Scald or Toxic. However, Gastrodon and Milotic dislike Toxic, though Suicune can play around it with either Rest or Substitute. Offensive Water-types such as Starmie, Sharpedo, and Golisopod take a lot from Diancie's attacks, but once they get a safe switch in, they can either KO a weakened Diancie or force it out with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Powerful wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Guts Heracross, and Choice Specs Chandelure easily overwhelm Diancie with their attacks.

In addition, many Pokemon Diancie switches into can cripple it, such as Chandelure and Noivern with Toxic or Entei with Sacred Fire. Diancie can cure its status with Heal Bell, but this makes it more passive. Beyond that, Diancie is a team's main answer to Dark-types, meaning it will often lose its Leftovers quickly through Knock Off from Pokemon such as Incineroar.

Heal Bell is also a great choice, since it makes Diancie less susceptible to status and can relieve a teammate from the cleric role. Toxic cripples bulky foes such as Gastrodon, Milotic, and Dhelmise and gives a better matchup against Togekiss, since bulky variants can stall out Diamond Storm with Roost. 20 Speed EVs allow Diancie to outspeed Sassy Incineroar.

Incineroar counters Decidueye, so partners that can threaten it are near essential, such as Heracross and Starmie. Pokemon like Metagross and Flygon appreciate Decidueye's ability to threaten bulky Water-types; in return, Metagross checks Flying-types such as Togekiss and Crobat, while Flygon can pressure checks like Incineroar and Registeel.</p> "

However, Incineroar has no recovery to speak of. This is somewhat mitigated by Heavy-Duty Boots removing entry hazard damage from the equation, but it does make Incineroar very vulnerable to Knock Off and Toxic.

Offensive Water-types, such as Sharpedo, Starmie, and Kingdra, are also threatening, although their frailty means they must be very cautious about switching in.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Stakataka and Diancie take Incineroar's STAB moves quite well and use it to set up Stealth Rock or fire off an attack.

Synthesis improves Dhelmise's longevity and lets it check Xurkitree, Raikou, and Toxtricity, but it has low PP, which means Dhelmise should be wary of chip damage from attacks like Volt Switch.

Fighting-types like Bewear and Heracross can help take down these threats more reliably. Dhelmise is relatively slow, which allows many threats to revenge kill it. Bulkier threats such as Golisopod and Nidoqueen can take one of its attacks and do big damage in return. Pokemon like Gastrodon and Umbreon therefore pair well with Dhelmise, as they blanket check a lot of the tier. In return, it can apply offensive pressure and clear entry hazards for them. Dhelmise also struggles with status and is often crippled by threats it switches into, like Steelix and Bronzong, which reduces its ability to check Raikou, Xurkitree, and Toxtricity. Pairing Dhelmise with Heal Bell is a great way to prevent this issue; most Heal Bell users also provide Wish support, reducing Dhelmise's reliance on Synthesis.</p> "

  "Xurkitree": {
    "overview": "<p>Of RU's three best Electric-types, Xurkitree, Raikou, and Toxtricity, Xurkitree is commonly considered the most restrictive and consistently dangerous for one simple reason: Grass-type coverage. Its Heavy-Duty Boots set singlehandedly makes Gastrodon, a strong Raikou answer, insufficient for covering the metagame's Electric-types, and other Ground-types like Steelix and Flygon shaky at best. With Ground-types so hesitant to face Xurkitree, it's free to use Volt Switch on switch-ins like Grass-types and special walls, which are rife with weaknesses for teammates to exploit. It's at its strongest against bulkier cores, which often use slower, exploitable Pokemon like Togekiss and Water-types and which struggle to pressure it with passive damage thanks to its Heavy-Duty Boots. While its Speed and bulk aren't great against offensive teams, it can usually find at least one opportunity to threaten them as well, either by forcing a switch or taking a hit. Should its team call for it, it can use Choice Scarf for greater use against offense and potentially cleaning up with Beast Boost at the expense of threatening defensive cores. What generally holds Xurkitree back is its aforementioned bulk and Speed; it can't switch into many direct attacks, and it often has very little breathing room against offense, areas where Raikou beats it out. Its Choice Scarf set suffers from prediction reliance against Ground-types and failing to outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Heracross and Flygon, limiting its ability to revenge kill and clean up. If you're looking for raw attacking power, you might prefer Toxtricity, whose Boomburst is easier to spam and much stronger than any of Xurkitree's individual attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Endure + Salac Berry has merit on Sticky Web teams, giving Xurkitree the simultaneous benefits of heightened Speed and attack freedom while blocking First Impression and outpacing Choice Scarf users not named Flygon. If you build around Indeedee-M, its Psychic Surge lets Xurkitree run Nature Power to OHKO Roserade, Vileplume, and Nidoqueen.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Roserade, Celebi, Vileplume, and Dhelmise are popular alongside Ground-types to minimize the damage Xurkitree can do, given their Electric resistance and neutrality-at-worst to its coverage. They're vulnerable to Volt Switch, though, so Xurkitree's team will often stay at an advantage, and Vileplume's and Dhelmise's lower Speed means Xurkitree doesn't even need to predict them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Bulky Pokemon like Diancie, Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Porygon2, and Umbreon stand up well to Xurkitree's unboosted attacks but are total Volt Switch fodder. They need Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree statused or itemless to win a battle of attrition.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Steelix's Grass neutrality makes it the best Ground-type Xurkitree switch-in, though it quickly loses to repeated Grass Knot or Energy Ball. Flygon can take Dazzling Gleam once with the right EVs. Other Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Golurk usually switch out when Xurkitree appears in fear of Grass-type moves but can punish overeager uses of Volt Switch. Any Ground-type is a serious problem for Choice Scarf Xurkitree, creating a cost for locking into Electric-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: With resistance to Electric and neutrality to Grass and Fairy, other Electric-types like Raikou, Toxtricity, and Xurkitree itself make for decent early-game switch-ins to Xurkitree. Only Toxtricity threatens much damage back, however, and none of them are eager to keep losing HP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority: Offensive teams featuring a lot of fast Pokemon give Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree few easy entry points and seldom lose more than one Pokemon to it. Faster Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Heracross can revenge kill weakened Choice Scarf Xurkitree. The same goes for strong priority from the likes of Golisopod and Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak: Lighting Rod Alolan Marowak is unique in that it's immune to Electric and resistant to both Grass and Fairy, making it a major early-game obstacle to Xurkitree, but it's uncommon, very flawed, and fairly easy to wear down.</p> ",

Dazzling Gleam covers Flygon and is Xurkitree's strongest option against certain Grass-types like Dhelmise and Celebi.</p> <p>Pivot Xurkitree is pretty good at its job by default, so it usually gets put on a proactive team later in the building process to support others and pressure Togekiss. Steel-, Flying-, and Fire-types such as Metagross, Noivern, and Salazzle like having Xurkitree use Volt Switch as Grass-types like Roserade and Celebi switch in, and Fighting- and Ground-types like Heracross and Flygon can take advantage of special walls such as Porygon2 and Registeel.

Its combination of Fire neutrality and Flying, Fairy, and Psychic resistances means it checks many common threats utilizing Fire-type coverage like Togekiss and Noivern in addition to Chandelure. Unfortunately, since Stakataka's the slowest Pokemon in the tier, it's usually getting hit first and worn down easily, and it is forced to make predictions even when other defensive Pokemon are switching in.

    "overview": "<p>Choice Specs Toxtricity is one of RU's strongest sources of immediate damage thanks to its Punk Rock-boosted Boomburst, which has very few consistent switch-ins. Pokemon with the typing or special bulk to take Boomburst, like Stakataka and Porygon2, are vulnerable to Toxtricity's coverage or lose momentum to Volt Switch. Though slow, Toxtricity poses a massive early-game threat to offensive teams, as staples like Noivern cannot immediately OHKO it and fear getting OHKOed in return. Its resistances let it even switch into and punish Crobat, Roserade, and Raikou once or twice, especially if they go for utility moves. Once Toxtricity has taken some damage, however, it becomes much less of a threat, as its low Speed and bulk will make it easy for many Pokemon to pick off. Its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and Spikes worsens this issue, especially in a metagame full of pivots using Heavy-Duty Boots, which incentivizes conventional offensive teams to forgo entry hazard removal. It faces competition from RU's more reliable Electric-types, such as Xurkitree, Heliolisk, and Raikou; the former can use Choice Scarf to similarly threaten offense or Heavy-Duty Boots to wallbreak like Toxtricity without fearing entry hazards, while the latter two's naturally high Speed stats lets them remain a threat to offense all game long.

Toxtricity's unremarkable bulk means this won't take long. Most aggressive teams will also give Toxtricity very few opportunities to directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: The presence of a Ghost-type forces Toxtricity to think twice about spamming Boomburst, limiting how much damage it can get out of its attack opportunities.

Roserade can support Arctovish with Spikes, while Raikou and Celebi pair very well with Arctovish offensively. On full hail, Pokemon like Toxicroak or Heliolisk can deal with Water-types. Lastly, checks to Steel-types like Registeel and Cosmic Power Metagross are important, so Pokemon like Xatu and Doublade are good choices.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Regidrago is a solid late-game sweeper once key roadblocks are removed. Regidrago's average-to-good bulk and Dragon typing lend it many setup opportunities against bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, but also against passive walls like Registeel. However, even after a boost, Regidrago is slower than every common Choice Scarf user. The Speed raise from Scale Shot can prevent Choice Scarf users from revenge killing Regidrago after setup, but it's inconsistent due to its variability in power. After a Dragon Dance, Thunder Fang 2HKOes even bulky Togekiss. Substitute helps Regidrago set up by blocking Scald burns and Toxic. The passive recovery from Leftovers means Regidrago can use Substitute many more times throughout a battle. An Adamant nature is preferable to ensure the 2HKO on Togekiss with Thunder Fang after a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Try as it might, Regidrago can't break through Steelix, Galarian Weezing, Diancie, and Stakataka. Luckily, wallbreakers like Starmie and Golurk can pick up the slack and blow past each one with relative ease. Fighting-types such as Guts Heracross, Bewear, and Pangoro can also overwhelm Diancie and Galarian Weezing while breaking Steelix and Stakataka. Crobat, Flygon, and Incineroar can safely switch Regidrago into the battlefield with U-turn. Flygon and Incineroar synergize particularly well with Regidrago, as they can bring it in against bulky Water-types for a setup opportunity. Disguised as Regidrago, Zoroark can lure Galarian Weezing, Sylveon, Steelix, and Doublade with coverage moves in Extrasensory, Sludge Bomb, and Flamethrower. Dragon Dance Regidrago fits well on dual screens hyper offense teams, as it can get multiple boosts with ease thanks to its titanic bulk under dual screens. One notable Pokemon commonly seen on dual screens hyper offense is Cloyster; after a Shell Smash, it can OHKO Galarian Weezing with Hydro Pump and can wear down Steel-types. Other hyper offense staples like Sharpedo and Mimikyu can also help with breaking bulky Steel-types.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Band Dragon's Maw-boosted Outrage is a sight to behold, but in a tier infested with Fairy- and Steel-types, Regidrago finds its effectiveness limited. Nevertheless, with good team support, Regidrago is a force to be reckoned with. Scale Shot is decently strong and doesn't lock Regidrago in like Outrage does. The Speed raise also makes it harder to revenge kill with faster threats like Noivern and Starmie. Hammer Arm is Regidrago's best move to hit Diancie as well as Steel-types such as Steelix and Registeel. Thunder Fang is a near-guaranteed 2HKO on max HP Togekiss. Explosion is an alternative over either Outrage or Scale Shot, as it opens the door for Regidrago's teammates by either severely weakening or outright KOing Togekiss, Grimmsnarl, or Galarian Weezing. Crunch is also an option to hit Doublade and 2HKO Metagross and Bronzong but has no other relevant targets.</p> <p>Regidrago can do next to nothing against Sylveon, Galarian Weezing, and Doublade. Toxtricity is noteworthy for dealing with the mentioned Pokemon and weakening Steelix, which repeatedly switches in on Regidrago otherwise. Fighting- and Dark-types like Heracross and Sharpedo can pair with Regidrago to overwhelm shared checks, such as Fairy-types. Regidrago can also lure and severely weaken Fairy-types with Explosion so its Fighting- and Dark-type teammate can clean up afterward. Zoroark can disguise itself as Regidrago with Illusion to lure and surprise Fairy-types with a super effective Sludge Bomb. Pivots like Raikou, Milotic, and Flygon are excellent for safely bringing Regidrago onto the field. Flygon and Fire-types like Entei and Incineroar are grateful for Regidrago breaking bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Gastrodon. Spikes support from Roserade and Klefki helps whittle down sturdy Steel-types like Steelix, Metagross, and Doublade.</p> "
