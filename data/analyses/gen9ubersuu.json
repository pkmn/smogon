Clefable best fits on semi-stall as well as full stall and balance teams looking for a solid wall and Wish passer. Pokemon like Kyurem-W, Mewtwo, and Palafin that don't have reliable recovery appreciate Clefable providing Wish support to them, allowing them to excel better as offensive threats. Clefable struggles against Pokemon like Arceus-Poison, Gholdengo, and Dialga that can muscle through it with their super effective STAB moves, so Pokemon that can take these threats on like Landorus and Ogerpon-H can be helpful to have.</p>"

Mewtwo's final moveslot is customizable; Shadow Ball targets Giratina, Deoxys, and opposing Mewtwo. Fire Blast gives Mewtwo coverage against Pokemon like Magearna, Solgaleo, and Arceus-Grass. Flamethrower can be opted for instead, trading power for consistency. However, it misses out on some important benchmarks Fire Blast reaches, such as not guaranteeing an OHKO on Solgaleo and Arceus-Grass after a Nasty Plot. Recover can be used to give Mewtwo more chances to sweep throughout a game, at the cost of its coverage. Expert Belt is the preferred item of choice, as it gives Mewtwo a power boost on targets it hits super effectively. Heavy-Duty Boots can be opted for instead, giving Mewtwo an immunity to entry hazards. Tera Steel gives Mewtwo a resistance to Zacian's STAB attacks and also provides it a resistance to Extreme Speed from Arceus formes and Deoxys. Tera Fighting can be opted for instead, boosting Focus Blast and giving a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch as well as Solgaleo's and Great Tusk's Knock Off. Mewtwo fits best on offensive teams looking for a strong wallbreaker. Mewtwo struggles against faster threats like Zacian, Deoxys, and Choice Scarf Kyurem-W that can revenge kill it, so Pokemon that can take these threats on like Toxapex, Solgaleo, and Magearna can be nice to have as teammates.

Toxic allows Galarian Slowking to put switch-ins like Arceus formes and Mewtwo on a timer, whereas Toxic Spikes can support its team by spreading status, forcing foes to take passive damage, and poisoning Substitute users like Palkia-O. Tera Water allows Galarian Slowking to resist Palafin's Water-type attacks and handle Palkia-O better; it also removes its Ground-type weakness, making it better at handling Landorus-T.

Galarian Slowking pairs well with Pokemon that struggle to switch in safely, such as Kyurem-W and Chi-Yu, as it can slowly pivot them in. Galarian Slowking is relatively passive and is particularly weak to Mewtwo, Deoxys, and Arceus-Dark, so it forms a very strong core with Arceus-Dark and Zacian, which can check those three foes.</p>"

Heavy Slam deals heavy damage to Zacian and Hatterene thanks to Dialga's massive weight while also not being affected by Draco Meteor's Special Attack drop. Stealth Rock allows Dialga to aid its teammates, passively chipping their checks. Dragon Tail allows Dialga to stop sweeps from Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Calm Mind Arceus formes, but Roar can be opted for instead, as it ignores Substitutes from Cyclizar and Palkia-O and can phaze Fairy-types like Zacian and Magearna. Tera Flying grants a resistance to both of Dialga's weaknesses, Fighting and Ground, letting it check threats it otherwise couldn't like Great Tusk and Zamazenta-C, though this comes at the cost of increased damage from Stealth Rock. Dialga pairs well with Pokemon like Chi-Yu and Kyurem-W, which can beat many of its checks like Great Tusk, Landorus, and Zamazenta-C. Dialga checks Pokemon like Deoxys, Spectrier, and Hatterene, making it an excellent teammate for Pokemon weak to these threats like Palkia-O, Giratina, and Mewtwo. Dialga is also a solid phazer, with entry hazard setters like Skarmory and Magearna appreciating it forcing foes to take repeated bouts of chip damage from their hazards.</p>"

Earth Power gives Dialga a way to hit opposing Steel-types like Solgaleo and Magearna as well as Pokemon like Arceus-Poison and Hatterene, but Thunder Wave is an option to cripple Pokemon attempting to set up on it like Mewtwo, Zacian, and Zamazenta-C. Stealth Rock grants Dialga extra utility, giving Pokemon like Kyurem-W a difficult time switching in. Roar allows Dialga to phaze Pokemon attempting to set up like Sneasler and Zacian while also going through Substitutes from Palkia-O and Cyclizar, but Dragon Tail can phaze Taunt users like Arceus-Dark at the cost of not going through Substitute and being walled by Fairy-types like Hatterene and Magearna. If phazing is not a priority, Heavy Slam can be opted as a secondary STAB move, as it targets Pokemon like Hatterene and Kyurem-W. Tera Flying allows Dialga to flip the matchup against Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus and remove all of its weaknesses, although it does give Dialga a weakness to Stealth Rock. Spikes setters like Ogerpon-H can make Dialga's phazing more potent. Dialga struggles against strong physically offensive threats like Zacian, Kingambit, and Palafin, so physically defensive walls like Toxapex and Great Tusk that can take these Pokemon on make great partners. Offensive threats like Deoxys and Choice Scarf Kyurem-W appreciate Dialga crippling switch-ins with Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave.</p>"

Draco Meteor does huge damage to Pokemon like Palkia-O and Kyurem-W, while also activating Dialga's Eject Pack, allowing it to bring in a threatening teammate like Ursaluna or Hoopa-U. Earth Power gives Dialga coverage to hit Steel-types like non-Air Balloon Gholdengo, opposing Dialga, and Magearna. Trick Room allows Dialga to outspeed almost every opposing Pokemon while also providing support to teammates like Solgaleo and Kingambit. Eject Pack allows Dialga to switch out when it drops its own stats with Draco Meteor, which lets it bring a teammate like Kingambit in safely. Tera Flying is used so Dialga can flip its only two weaknesses, Fighting and Ground, to a resistance and an immunity, making it much better against Zamazenta-C, Great Tusk, and Landorus, allowing it to set up Trick Room in front of these threats. Dialga sets Trick Room, making it a natural ally to Pokemon like Ursaluna, Kingambit, and Hoopa-U, which it can wallbreak alongside. As a Trick Room setter, it struggles with Pokemon like Taunt Arceus formes and phazers like Dialga, Giratina, and bulky Arceus formes. This means it pairs well with Pokemon like Ursaluna and Hoopa-U, which can break through these obstacles with sheer power, or Fairy-types like Magearna and Zacian, which are immune to Dragon Tail. Other Trick Room setters Dialga is commonly paired with, like Solgaleo and Hatterene, are great partners too, as they can set Trick Room for it, and Hatterene is especially good at this due to being immune to Taunt and phazing.</p>"

Fire Blast lets Palkia-O more easily KO certain Fire-weak Pokemon, such as Magearna and Solgaleo, though it doesn't do significantly more damage than Hydro Pump without Tera Fire. Earth Power is a perfectly accurate, albeit slightly weaker, alternative to its STAB moves against foes like Dialga and Solgaleo. Substitute helps Palkia-O take advantage of switches it forces and eases prediction against Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Thunder Wave ruins Arceus formes Palkia-O Speed ties with and faster attackers like Mewtwo and Zacian. Tera Fire lets Fire Blast OHKO foes like Kingambit and non-specially defensive Magearna and 2HKO Solgaleo in addition to making Palkia-O better at taking on Fairy-types like Zacian and Dragon-types like opposing Palkia-O and Choice Scarf Kyurem-W. However, it does give Palkia-O a Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Fairy lets Palkia-O take Dragon-type moves with no fear while also improving its matchup against Fairy-types. Tera Ground should generally be used with Earth Power to 2HKO Dialga and Solgaleo, OHKO Kingambit, and OHKO Magearna with Spikes support; it also helps Palkia-O beat opposing Dragon-types and Magearna, gives it a resistance to Stealth Rock, and gives it an immunity to Thunder Wave. Palkia-O best fits on offense and balance teams looking for a potent wallbreaker, paring nicely with sweepers like Zacian and Kingambit. Palkia-O appreciates Steel-type pivots such as Solgaleo, Magearna, and Corviknight, which switch into the foes that beat it such as Zacian and maintain momentum. Solgaleo has the added benefit of checking many other foes that outspeed Palkia-O, like Mewtwo, while Magearna can set up Spikes to help Palkia-O put foes like Kingambit and opposing Magearna into its KO range. Corviknight and other forms of entry hazard control such as Great Tusk and Mandibuzz are helpful at keeping Palkia-O healthy given its vulnerability to hazards, especially if it's running Tera Fire.</p>"

Recover allows it to increase its longevity and set up on some physical attackers, such as Solgaleo and Kingambit. Tera Fairy grants Arceus-Dark a resistance to Fighting-type moves from the likes of Urshifu-S, Deoxys, and Mewtwo, along with an immunity to Dragon Tail, the only phazing move that cannot be prevented by Taunt. Tera Poison turns its Fairy, Fighting, and Bug weaknesses into resistances, which is incredible for setting up on Zacian, Magearna, and Zamazenta-C. Arceus-Dark greatly benefits from the help of Pokemon that can deal with physical attackers, as Zacian and Zamazenta-C both offensively check it, so Dondozo, Lugia, Skarmory, physically defensive Solgaleo, and Magearna form good defensive cores with it. Other Pokemon that pair well with Arceus-Dark are Zamazenta-C and Annihilape, as both are Defense-boosting offensive sweepers that can wall and eliminate physical attackers for Arceus-Dark to freely take care of special attackers. Arceus-Dark is very entry hazard weak, so Pokemon like Giratina and Great Tusk that can remove hazards for Arceus-Dark are greatly appreciated. Giratina appreciates Arceus-Dark's ability to check Dark- and Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Spectrier, and Great Tusk appreciates Arceus-Dark beating common checks to it like Giratina, Skarmory, and Deoxys.</p>"

Arceus-Dark can run Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers, like Zacian and Zamazenta-C switching in, or it can run Stealth Rock to give its team entry hazard support if a partner doesn't have the move. Roar phazes many setup sweepers, such as Arceus and Mewtwo, whereas Taunt blocks them from setting up altogether. Taunt also shuts down many lead Pokemon like Smeargle and Galvantula and can force your opponent on the back foot provided it wins a Speed tie against opposing Arceus-Dark. Tera Poison turns Dark's Fairy, Fighting, and Bug weaknesses into resistances, which is especially helpful versus Zacian and Volcarona. Tera Fairy gives similar resistances to Poison, but the neutrality to Psychic and Ground helps against Great Tusk and Deoxys, and the valuable Dragon immunity lets Arceus-Dark beat Kyurem-W. Arceus-Dark benefits from specially defensive partners like Blissey, Calm Mind Clefable, and Giratina due to being weak to special attackers such as Magearna and Palkia-O.

Roar or Dragon Tail is used to stop setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Mewtwo and Calm Mind Arceus variants. Roar can be prevented by Taunt; however, unlike Dragon Tail it can phaze Fairy-types and Pokemon behind Substitute. Taunt is an alternative option to prevent opposing Pokemon from boosting and allow Arceus-Dark to chip down passive wall Pokemon like Giratina and Solgaleo by preventing them from healing. The last moveslot is fairly flexible; Arceus-Dark can serve as an effective entry hazard setter with Stealth Rock, while Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave let it cripple offensive Pokemon like Palafin and Ogerpon-H. Tera Poison lets Arceus-Dark beat setup sweepers that can otherwise force it out like Zacian and Arceus-Fighting. Tera Fairy provides similar resistances as Poison while also providing an extremely useful immunity to Dragon, letting it better check threats like Palkia-O, while not causing a pesky weakness to the Psychic-type moves fired off from Pokemon such as Mewtwo and Deoxys. Arceus-Dark checks Pokemon like Chi-Yu and Kyurem-W, so it pairs well with Pokemon like Zamazenta-C, Mewtwo, Palkia-O and Solgaleo, which struggle against those threats. Physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk and Calm Mind Lugia complement Arceus-Dark well; the former can beat many Dark-resistant Pokemon that pressure it like both Urshifu formes while appreciating its ability to check Psychic-types, and the latter checks Fighting-types well and appreciates other setup sweepers being deterred from setting up. Giratina is another good teammate thanks to its typing letting it check sweepers that Arceus-Dark cannot, such as Arceus-Fire and Sneasler; in exchange, Arceus-Dark checks opposing Ghost- and Dark-types such as Spectrier and Chi-Yu and spreads status so Giratina can fire off powerful Hexes.</p>"

Will-O-Wisp gives Arceus-Dragon the ability to more comfortably take on physical attackers like Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Zacian, but if these threats are not an issue, Thunder Wave can cripple the likes of Mewtwo, Kyurem-W, and Lunala with paralysis. The third moveslot is incredibly flexible; most commonly, Stealth Rock is run to allow Arceus-Dragon to provide support for its team. Dragon Tail and Roar are also options, as both provide phazing capabilities, with Dragon Tail not being affected by Taunt and Roar bypassing Substitutes and hitting Fairy-types like Zacian and Magearna. Flash Cannon is an option to provide coverage for Fairy-types, allowing Arceus-Dragon to not be completely walled by them, but it is extremely difficult to fit. Tera Steel gives Arceus-Dragon a valuable defensive typing, allowing it to take on Pokemon like Iron Bundle, Gholdengo, and Deoxys better while also providing a Toxic immunity. Tera Fairy and Tera Water are alternative Tera types that let Arceus-Dragon take on Pokemon like Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and Kyurem-W better. The given EV spread allows Arceus-Dragon to be as bulky as possible while still outpacing Ogerpon-H. Arceus-Dragon generally finds use on defensive teams alongside other walls like Magearna and Toxapex. Fairy-types like Magearna, Zacian, and Clefable completely counter Arceus-Dragon, so checks to them like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex are valuable to have.

Recover allows it to shrug off recoil damage from Flare Blitz with minimal difficulty. Tera Normal is essential for Arceus-Fire to have the necessary damage output to complete a sweep, as it cannot run a boosting item instead of Flame Plate; Tera Normal also removes its weaknesses to Ground- and Water-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk, Landorus, and Palafin-H. 72 Speed EVs allow it to outspeed Timid Gholdengo. Arceus-Fire fits on a wide variety of teams, but it has a few notable partners. Arceus-Fire pairs especially well with Rillaboom, as it removes bulky Water-types like Dondozo for Arceus-Fire's sweep, and Grassy Terrain weakens Earthquake's damage and provides passive recovery. Hazard control from Great Tusk, Giratina, or Corviknight is also essential when using Arceus-Fire, as it suffers from a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, greatly limiting its longevity. Arceus-Fire is vulnerable to Taunt and Encore users like Cyclizar, Magearna, and Ogerpon-H and Haze users like Toxapex, which can all prevent it from setting up. Teammates like Gholdengo, which is immune to all status moves, and Rillaboom, which typically does not use status or setup moves, are good partners to remedy this weakness. Arceus-Fire struggles to break through physical walls like Toxapex, Giratina, and Garganacl that resist its powerful Flare Blitz while also being able to take Extreme Speed, so partners like Landorus, Kyurem-W, and Zacian that can break through these threats form potent offensive cores with Arceus-Fire.</p>"

Tera Poison gives Mandibuzz a useful Fairy-type resistance and is generally an excellent defensive typing, helping it take on Pokemon like Zacian and Magearna. Mandibuzz generally fits on more defensive balance teams looking for a solid switch-in to physical attacks from Pokemon like Kingambit, Ogerpon-H, and Sneasler. Mandibuzz struggles against physical attackers like Kingambit and Zamazenta-C that do not fear Foul Play, so Pokemon like Arceus-Poison and Landorus-T that can take them on are helpful. Pokemon like Landorus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Magearna form a powerful defensive pivot core with Mandibuzz.</p>"

U-turn allows Landorus to keep up momentum, pivoting out safely into Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Arceus-Dark on incoming walls like Blissey and Giratina. Stealth Rock is an option over U-turn, allowing Landorus to function as lead and take advantage of the switches it forces against Pokemon like Dialga, Magearna, and Galarian Slowking, but it generally is not preferred. Tera Water can be used to enhance Landorus's defensive profile, removing its crippling Ice weakness and enabling it to survive Wave Crash and Jet Punch from Palafin, while Tera Ground can be used to let it OHKO Zamazenta-C and Arceus-Electric after Stealth Rock. Landorus fits excellently on offensive teams that aim to wear down foes by trading KOs heavily, as it is an incredibly potent revenge killer; as a result, Sneasler, Palkia-O, and Ogerpon-H make for excellent partners. Landorus struggles to break robust special walls like Giratina and Blissey, so it enjoys the presence of strong physical wallbreakers like Zacian and Great Tusk.

        "description": "<p>Thanks to its good typing, stats, and ample movepool, Great Tusk can serve as both an effective entry hazard remover and wallbreaker. Knock Off helps Great Tusk punish Pokemon that wall it such as Giratina, Skarmory, and Landorus. Close Combat lets Great Tusk hit threats such as Arceus-Dark and Ursaluna hard, while Stealth Rock lets Great Tusk compress the roles of hazard setter, wallbreaker, and hazard remover. Tera Dark is used to bolster Knock Off and grant Great Tusk an immunity to Psychic-type moves from the likes of Deoxys and Mewtwo, letting it punish them with a super effective Knock Off. Tera Water can instead be used to grant Great Tusk a resistance to Palafin's Water moves and Arceus-Fire's Flare Blitz. Hazard-weak wallbreakers, such as Chi-Yu and Kyurem-W, appreciate Great Tusk removing hazards for them; in exchange, they target the physical walls that Great Tusk loathes. Kyurem-W in particular forms an excellent offensive core with it, being able to offensively pressure its checks such as Giratina and Lugia. Arceus-Dark also makes a good partner for Great Tusk, as it covers Great Tusk's weakness to special attackers while also enjoying hazards being removed. Furthermore, Arceus-Dark pressures the Ghost-types that block Great Tusk's attempts to use Rapid Spin.</p>"

Alternatively, Ice Shard finishes off low health targets and surprises faster Pokémon, which is very beneficial due to Baxcalibur's relatively low Speed. Tera Ground powers up Earthquake as well as makes Baxcalibur immune to Thunder Wave and blocking Volt Switch, which is very useful. Alolan Ninetales is a fantastic teammate with its ability Snow Warning, as Snow and Aurora Veil increase Baxcalibur's bulk to very high levels. Other good teammates are ones that can cover problems Fighting, Steel, or Fairy types, so Zacian, Mewtwo, Chi-Yu, and Solgaleo are notably appreciated.

Alolan Ninetales is one of the best teammates for Baxcalibur, as Aurora Veil and the Defense boost snow gives to Ice-types make it much easier for Baxcalibur to set up. Choice Scarf Chi-Yu and Choice Scarf Landorus are also good teammates for Baxcalibur, as they threaten Zamazenta-C and Magearna, which would otherwise beat it, and Landorus can pivot with U-turn. Magearna and Solgaleo can also be used as defensive teammates, as they have excellent synergy with Baxcalibur and can slowly pivot it in, positioning it to sweep.</p>"

Make It Rain allows Gholdengo to output huge damage and hit important targets like Kyurem-W, Baxcalibur, and Zacian, whereas Shadow Ball offers incredible neutral coverage while hitting Mewtwo, Giratina, and Galarian Slowking extremely hard. Recover allows Gholdengo to have incredible longevity alongside its immunity to status moves. Tera Water allows Gholdengo to turn its Fire weakness into a resistance, helping against Chi-Yu and Kyurem-W, while also providing a resistance to Water, which assists against Palkia-O and Palafin. Air Balloon gives Gholdengo a temporary Ground immunity, giving it more entry points through an immunity to Spikes, Earth Power, and Earthquake from Great Tusk and Landorus. Gholdengo pairs excellently with entry hazard setters such as Magearna and Skarmory, as it blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog. It can also break through some walls with its sheer power, like Clefable and Arceus-Grass, giving teammates like Zacian an easier time cleaning up. Gholdengo struggles with faster offensive Pokemon that can halt its sweep and revenge kill it, such as Dragapult and Tera Fire Zacian, so Pokemon like Deoxys, Palafin, and Rillaboom can help Gholdengo by handing them. Pokemon with strong priority moves, like Kingambit and Palafin, can also halt its sweep and revenge kill it, so teammates like Zamazenta-C and Palkia-O, which can take Sucker Punch and Jet Punch, respectively, provide excellent support for it.</p>"

Thunder Wave allows Gholdengo to disrupt the enemy team, power up its Hex, and cripple offensive Pokemon like Zacian, Palkia-O, and Chi-Yu. Nasty Plot turns Gholdengo from a wall into a potential sweeper with Shadow Ball, being able to boost on Pokemon that rely on status or phazing, like Arceus-Poison if its Air Balloon is intact and Clefable. Air Balloon gives Gholdengo a temporary Ground-type and Spikes immunity, allowing it to switch in on Great Tusk and Landorus easily, and keep entry hazards on the field against Great Tusk. Tera Water allows Gholdengo to resist Water- and Fire-type moves from the likes of Chi-Yu, Kyurem-W, Palkia-O, and Palafin. Gholdengo can paralyze and beat foes like Zacian and Zamazenta-C, helping teammates such as Arceus-Dark and Kyurem-W that appreciate being faster than opposing threats. However, Gholdengo struggles with Dark-types like Kingambit and Arceus-Dark, so Pokemon like Magearna and Zamazenta-C pair excellently with it. Additionally, Gholdengo has natural synergy with entry hazard setters like Magearna, Galarian Slowking, Galvantula, and Skarmory, as it blocks both Rapid Spin and Defog, making it the best Pokemon for keeping hazards on the opponent's field.</p>"

Trick cripples opposing Pokemon like Magearna and Dialga, which could otherwise wall Gholdengo. As Choice Scarf Gholdengo is unable to run a damage-boosting item, it sometimes lacks in damage. Tera Steel makes up for this by allowing it to OHKO Mewtwo after Stealth Rock and OHKO Great Tusk; Tera Steel also removes its weaknesses to the Dark- and Ghost-type attacks that would otherwise force it out like Sucker Punch from Kingambit, Shadow Ball from Mewtwo, and Judgment from Arceus-Dark. Tera Fighting is used exclusively on Focus Blast sets to turn Gholdengo's Sucker Punch weakness into a resistance while also allowing it to OHKO Zamazenta-C and offensive Dialga. Gholdengo is one of the most reliable forms of entry hazard control in the tier, as its immunity to both Rapid Spin and Defog allows it to keep hazards up with ease. Therefore, hazard setters like Magearna, Skarmory, and Deoxys-S make for excellent partners. Primarily used as a revenge killer, Gholdengo is excellent at enabling other premier offensive cleaners like Zacian, Ogerpon-H, and Kingambit by punching through their potential checks like Clefable and Dondozo, while also crippling Giratina with Trick. Gholdengo struggles against teams that contain strong priority users like Palafin and Kingambit, so Pokemon that can take hits from them, like Arceus-Grass, Archaludon, Toxapex, and Palkia-O are desirable partners.</p>"

Chien-Pao particularly dislikes Fairy-types such as Magearna and Zacian; some strong options that can deal with them are Landorus-T, Chi-Yu, and Arceus-Poison.

Flamethrower targets Steel- and Grass-types like Magearna, Zamazenta-C, Arceus-Grass, and Corviknight.

Walking Wake fits exclusively on sun teams and is mandatory on them. Torkoal is the most automatic partner for Walking Wake, as it sets the sun needed for Walking Wake to be at its fullest potential while also spinning away entry hazards and setting up Stealth Rock to wear down would-be switchins to Walking Wake like Magearna. Great Tusk is also a notable partner, as it removes entry hazards as well and can deal with the Steel-types Waking Wake can struggle against.

Power Whip and Horn Leech can be run as stronger Grass-type moves to hit Palafin and Great Tusk for super effective damage. Ivy Cudgel gives Ogerpon-H a strong, non-contact Fire-type STAB move to hit Magearna and Skarmory with while avoiding Rocky Helmet chip damage. Play Rough is for Dragon-types like Giratina and Reshiram that resist its STAB moves, whereas Knock Off is for general utility and hits Mewtwo and Lugia. Terastallizing Ogerpon-H gives it an Attack boost, letting it grab OHKOs on bulky neutral Pokemon like Zacian and Dialga without a Swords Dance boost. Ogerpon-H is best dealt with using offensive counterplay that takes advantage of its poor bulk, as Pokemon like Deoxys, Zacian, Choice Scarf Landorus, Chi-Yu, and Palafin can outrun and KO it. Defensively, almost nothing can take Ogerpon-H on, as Mold Breaker ignores Unaware, so only the likes of Moltres can safely handle it. Entry hazards are also a huge problem for Ogerpon-H, as it cannot hold Heavy-Duty Boots, meaning it will take significant chip damage when hitting the battlefield. Ogerpon-H especially appreciates support from Corviknight, which can help Ogerpon-H safely hit the field and remove hazards. Ogerpon-H also forms strong offensive cores with priority users like Rillaboom, Palafin, and Arceus formes due to them being able to eliminate the few faster threats in the metagame.

Tera Fairy allows Archaludon to resist Fighting-type attacks and gives it a Dragon-type immunity, flipping the matchup against Pokemon like Palkia-O and Zacian. Tera Flying can be used instead, giving it a Ground-type immunity to avoid getting revenge killed by Landorus-I or Great Tusk, although this comes with the significant drawback of making it weak to Stealth Rock.
